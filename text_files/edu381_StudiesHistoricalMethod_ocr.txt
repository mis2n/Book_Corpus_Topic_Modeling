AS TO THE INTENT OF THIS BOOK. 
THERE are many people who, perhaps, without being ambitious to 
write books or become college professors, would like to be careful 
and special students and teachers of the subject of history. For 
them I write, and especially for the teacher who wishes to special- 
ize his work, and to see the world from this particular point of 
view. For as the material world grows smaller, and time and 
space condense, our intellectual world grows greater, its points of 
view become more numerous, more unobstructed, and so much more 
extensive, that in order to have any point of view at all, or get on 
top of the earth in any direction, we must choose some particular 
height as our own; do the best we can, it will take a good part of 
life to attain any high outlook. 
To what can the teacher of history in the secondary schools 
aspire? In the field of information, to a fair general view of 
history plus a very special knowledge of some particlar topic, as 
the history of his own locality if he is in the country, or as the 
history of the Napoleonic era if he is in a great city where libraries 
are rich and generous; in the field of investigation he can add to 
the sum of human knowledge along the lines indicated by the sub- 
studies given in this book. The whole field of our study in the 
direction of connecting the subject vitally with the pupil, as Miss 
Kéhler has tried to do in her study entitled How Children Remem- 
ber History, or of exploiting the exact worth of this or that source, 
as Mrs. Willard has attempted in the sub-study on the ballad, or of 
determining with exactness the strength and form of the various 
elements of the historical sense, as Miss Patterson has done in her 
1

  2 AS TO THE INTENT OF THIS BOOK. 
study on notions of time, is quite new, and invites attention from 
the teacher who has either originality or leisure. 
If, however, the teacher is not so much by nature a student or 
investigator, but has rather the gift of adaptation, there is an- 
other field open in the way of preparing and presenting historical 
material in forms at once true to historical fact and to the nature 
of the child. Miss Nina Moore, in Pilgrims and Puritans, has 
given what seems an almost perfect model of this sort of work, — 
a piece of work scholarly, elegant, sympathetic alike to her sources 
and her audience. 
The curse of secondary teaching is often the fact that after a 
year or two it provides no free outlet for the mind; but with the 
rapid development of departmental and individual work, the day is 
not far off when every one who chooses to teach, and who can pro- 
tect himself from the insanity of overwork and the frivolity of 
scattered work, may hope to make his way out from the deadly 
treadmill of routine to join the life and motion of the greater world 
of knowledge. 
My acknowledgments are due to Professor G. L. Burr of Cornell 
University, to Professor A. B. Show, and Mr. F. J. Teggart of 
Leland Stanford Junior University, for assistance in the biblio- 
graphical notes.

METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE NATURE OF HISTORY. 
THE CONTENT OF HISTORY. 
History is past politics; politics is present history. — Freeman. 
History is but the record of individual action. — Froude. 
History is humanity becoming and being conscious concerning itself. — Droysen. 
‘Iorwp — one who knows law and right; a judge; a witness. 
‘Ioropia — a learning or knowing by inquiry.— Liddell and Scott’s Greek Dic- 
tionary. 
Wuar is history? Is there such a thing? After we have 
taken out political science, sociology, ethnology, the comparative 
study of literature, arts, and laws, does anything remain that we 
may call distinctively history? Is it the simple task of verify- 
ing the documents and dates on which these other sciences rest? 
Even in this field distinct bodies of scholarship have grown up 
about paleography, diplomatics, epistography, and chronology. The 
School of Charters in Paris, and similar schools in other centres 
of scholarship, are rapidly specializing all the study of evidence, 
so that about the sources of history legally trained specialists be- 
gin to swarm, and on them we must depend for the identification 
of documents and dates, the reading of manuscripts, the value of 
vocabularies. 
Is there anything left after subtracting all these specialties which 
may be called history? Let us subject the remains of Greece to 
the process. Here a philologist works his life out on the dialects, 
fixes their relationships, develops the subtler meanings of the Greek 
3
-P-A-G-E-8
4 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
vocabulary, discovers the origins of Homer with more certainty, and 
has something authoritative to tell us of the early migrations; here 
the archeologist grubs at Delphi, and from long-buried foundations 
and remains reconstructs life on its material side; the sociologist 
and the student of institutions dissect the social and political struc- 
ture distinctly out from the whole body of Greek literature and 
law; scholars edit exact texts from fragmentary inscriptions and 
palimpsests; every scrap of old Greek marble becomes inspiring 
and instructive for the art student and the critic; and yet in a 
general way we say these specialists all deal with and elucidate 
historical facts, as if there were some large inclusive unit called 
history. What, then, is that large inclusive unit which makes the 
buried tombs, the varying dialects, the Greek marbles, historic as 
well as archzologic, philologic, esthetic? That large inclusive unit 
is the authentic and related story of action progressive through time. 
When we know how the old Greek spoke, dressed, ate, governed, or 
worshipped, there is still something left for us to know; namely, 
what he did, how he came to do it, and what good or harm resulted. 
Neither sociology, political science, nor paleography, concerns it- 
self greatly with the Persian War, for instance. They leave aside 
all that class of events which we call action, that peculiar humam 
product which uses speech, art, government, faith, as tools with 
which to work out a destiny, a character, a continuous change for 
better or worse. These elements are but the stuff from which the 
tools are made by which he builds an Athenian democracy, a Hel- 
lenic empire, and makes himself a Greek, in short. The special 
scholar gives us details. It is for the historian to use these in tell- 
ing the story of the march, with its goal, its hardships and hero- 
isms, its success or failure, its continuity of cause and effect. The 
ethnologist, philologist, and so on, bring stone and wood. It is for 
the historian to build, to gather these studies on Greek dialects, 
Greek antiquities, Greek art, into one proportioned and related 
whole; to wit, the history of the Greek. He is not to repeat what 
they have told, but to relate it. To the philologist the Greek is
-P-A-G-E-9
    METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 5 
all mouth, — he hears only his speech in Attic, Spartan, or Beotian 
twang; to the student of political science the Greek is but the 
creature of the demos or the tyrant; for the student of literature 
and art he sits all day in the theatre, or works all day at the frieze 
of the Parthenon; to the student of comparative religion he is the 
worshipper of Zeus, Athene, Dionysius; to the historian he must be 
all this, — the Greek of Attic, Spartan, or Beotian twang, democra- 
tized or tyrannized; now sitting all day in the theatre, now working 
all day at the marble, now sacrificing to the great gods. But he is 
besides all this, and because he is all this, the man of Marathon, 
the support of Pericles, the forlorn hope of the Greek leagues, the 
listener to Socrates, adding to human life an increment of freedom, 
beauty, and temperance, acting as cause and effect back and forth 
between the Greek generations. 
History bears thus the same relation to the special studies of 
society that biography bears to the special studies of the individual. 
Anatomy, psychology, and a crowd of special inquiries, crowd about 
impersonal man. Biography takes hold of the personal man, studies 
this anatomy and psychology in its action, — studies motive, prog- 
ress, accomplishment, and method. So history deals with the social 
unit; it studies the progressive personality of a people, as it devel- 
ops through environment and action into social success or failure. 
Take a great historic fact, like the development of the German Em- 
pire, and we find ourselves compelled to study institutions, envi- 
ronment, heredity, it is true, but to study all these things in the 
play of action and motive, and, above all, in their relation to the 
initiative of such forceful characters as Bismarck, and such un- 
expected events as Waterloo. 
Is not, then, the stream of events the peculiar content of his- 
tory? The events are now literary, now political, now military, 
as the people fight, think, or feel; but all surge together in the flow 
of the great stream, always running on, bearing with it the freight 
of ages, to ages yet to come. 
But is the historian to be the impassive spectator and impersonal
-P-A-G-E-10
6 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
chronicler of the stream of events? Even so, he belongs to 
the ancient craft of Herodotus; a mirror clear and true of the 
sweep of the social stream. Better still if he have the power of 
art, the power to see relation, proportion, light, and shade; best 
of all if he have the power of insight, can see tendency and the 
subtle spirit of the time, the larger, clearer vision— the greater 
master. 
But the spirit of the modern age, which has specialized, which 
looks after every detail with sharpest criticism, which has broken 
up the old Greek philosophy into a hundred fields of science, seems 
ready to turn its back on the old narrative history, and gives us, 
instead, a mass of edited documents, a collection of verified frag- 
ments, and says: There is all of the past that there is; make what 
you can of it. The time is surely gone by when the study of his- 
' tory can be pursued otherwhere than where the sources of history 
spring; documents and monuments mark the way. And the public 
presses after the scholar; is never content to be put off with the 
remains of yesterday: but, since it cannot spend all its time in the 
great necropolis of humanity, it asks of the scholar: What have 
you found that is of interest to us all ?—what great mummied king, 
what great word in the manuscripts? How, then, work all these 
fragments into a connected and related whole? And yet is it not by 
the fragments alone that we know the course of the stream? May 
it not be that in the future the popular history will take the form 
not so much of the narrative as of the drama? A history of Greece 
will open with a series of pictures which will give us the setting 
of landscape and town in which the drama plays. Homer will begin 
the tale; Herodotus and Plutarch carry it on; Pericles, Socrates, 
Thucydides, will each take his turn before the audience in his own 
character and speech, while page after page pictures forth the glo- 
ries of Greek art. Such a history is conceivable, although it will be 
a new form of literature altogether, and the literary talent required 
to produce it will be of the sort that feels sympathetically and surely 
the type of life, the soul of an action, the harmony and proportion

of all parts, and which is dominated above all by the clear vision of 
the whole stream of life, with an eye not to be caught too long by 
flotsam and jetsam floating on its surface.! 
THE SOURCES OF HISTORY. 
Tue original materials from which historians work are called 
sources. They correspond to fossils in geology, to cases in law, to 
words in philology; they are the remains of the past, from which 
all our knowledge of that past is derived. They consist of the mass 
of traditions, books, manuscripts, papers, relics, monuments, and 
institutions in which a generation embodies itself tangibly and 
visibly. 
The animal mounds of Wisconsin, the graves at Gettysburg, the 
cathedrals of Europe, — these are monumental sources. All manner 
of relics — the Greek vase, the Irish bracelet, the old colonial uni- 
form — are intimate sources by which we reconstruct personal life. 
The English Parliament, the Russian mir, the ceremonies of religion, 
are institutional sources : while of original written sources, the world 
seems alarmingly full; for here are classed letters, sermons, maps, 
newspapers, church and town records, autobiographies, diaries, 
inscriptions, the archives of governments. In short, the whole 
embodiment of a generation in descendants, institutions, creeds, 
and laws, in literature, speech, and set histories, in handiwork 
and art, is our source for its history, even more than that set and 
conscious product which it names its history. In this latter the 
generation is reproduced according to some notion of it formed by 
itself or others; what seems unnecessary or undesirable is omitted, 
because a history is necessarily written from some one point of 
view, — political, social, or religious. But in the sources, history 
finds its immortal material for its ever-renewed product. For the 
content and direction of history changes with every generation. If

1895, with the kind permission of the publishers.

  8 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
our ancestors, if the last generation, cared for political history, and 
found in political history its needed pabulum, we who need a social 
history need not despair because we find none written for our 
need, for the sources still are ours, — the forest, mine, and quarry, 
whence every generation may hew and delve its own peculiar treas- 
ure with tools that grow the sharper for the using, anda hand that 
grows more deft and cunning; and when social history shall be 
outgrown, there we shall find at our need the embodied life of the 
intellect or the feelings. These sources are the mothers of history, 
on which all historical narratives and judgments must rest, and to 
which all historical narratives and judgments must appeal. 
It at once appears that, to make these sources accessible and 
intelligible, they must be collected and studied; we speak, therefore, 
first of collections, and second of schools. 
Since the beginning of the eighteenth century, collections of 
sources have been made in every country of Europe. Among the 
most famous are the monuments of Germany (Monwmenta Ger- 
maniae) and the Master of the Rolls series in England. These great 
collections are made only by governments, or by societies that com 
mand wealth and leisure. Their chief value is to advanced students 
of history, and they are only accessible in great and wealthy libra- 
ries. But within the last twenty years small collections of typical 
sources have begun to appear in every country. The following bib- 
liography of these select collections does not attempt to include Conti- 
nental publications, but is as complete as I can make it for English 
and American work. Additional titles will be gratefully accepted.

and its promoters believe that few things can contribute better to this end than the 
wide circulation of such leaflets as these. The aim is to bring valuable historical 
documents, often not easily accessible, within easy reach of everybody. There are 
at present fifty-five leaflets in the series, and others will rapidly follow. The fol-

toire de France racontée par les contemporains, covers the whole of 
French history down to modern times, and is sold, in spite of many 
original illustrations from the sources, at the price of half a franc a 
number. 
In American history, a bibliography of manuscript sources is 
given by Winsor in volume viii of his Narrative and Critical His- 
tory of America. The critical chapter following each narrative 
chapter in this same work gives the best bibliography of printed 
sources extant on the special topic treated. In English history, 
Green, in his Short History of the English People, gives at the 
head of each chapter short titles for the sources on which the chap- 
ter is based. Much more exhaustive is J. Bass Mullinger’s critical 
and biographical account of authorities given in the latter half of 
Samuel R. Gardiner’s English History for Students ... Kegan 
Paul, London, 1881. The catalogue of the Bohn libraries, fur- 
nished by Macmillan, will give a long and valuable list of trans- 
lated sources illustrative of Greek, Roman, Medieval, and English 
History. The best general bibliography of sources known to me is 
that of Bernheim, who gives a very exhaustive list of collections of 
sources, pp. 188-202, and 436-438 of his Lehrbuch der Historischen 
Methode, Leipsic, 1894. 
The study of the sources has developed new sciences: the com- 
parative study of words, or philology; of manuscript writings, or 
paleography ; of inscriptions, or epigraphy; of official documents, 
or diplomatics; of remains, or archeology. This growth of new 
sciences in turn demands new schools and new apparatus. In gen- 
eral, we may say that the German Seminarium is devoted to these 
studies of sources. The key-notes of this institution are two: first, 
that the material used consists of sources; and, second, that the 
work of the student is the independent, and, wherever possible, the 
original investigation of these materials. The seminary is now 
thoroughly adopted in our own country, and follows the same 
ideal as in Germany. Johns Hopkins University was the first 
to develop the seminary in the line of American local history, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  12 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
field where the American student can most readily obtain access 
to sources, and at the same time really add to the sum of human 
knowledge. In France, the Eeole des Chartes in Paris is organized 
with the aim of training young men who shall be able to edit, 
verify, and interpret the sources of history. 
Another form of school developed by the study of the sources 
appears in the Archeological Stations established at Rome, Athens, 
and other places. These are but the beginnings of a great develop- 
ment of such schools, to be stationed wherever the earth itself has 
much to yield to the historical student. Such stations should in 
our own country be established in Arizona, New Mexico, Guatemala, 
Peru, and wherever the mass of sources is immovably local. 
The worker in sources collects, classifies, dates, and places them, 
verifies their authenticity, gives them a legible, clean, trustworthy 
form. The historian then selects such materials as bear on his own 
set work; from these, in turn, he chooses the forms most typical 
and complete, and interprets them with such truth as his own 
genius and sympathy permit. For instance, if he is a Parkman, he 
will first collect all the relations of the Jesuits; from these he will 
take those which relate to old Canada; from these he will select 
those written by the most devoted and observing Jesuits, and by 
those who were longest in their chosen field. From these selected 
types he will render to the modern world that epic of heroism called 
the Jesuits in North America. 
THE STUDY OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY. 
Ir will readily be seen that if any one wishes to study history 
from the sources, he must either have recourse to collections ready 
made, or to the field of local and contemporary history. In fact, 
away from great libraries, these are the only possible openings for 
original historical work. Contemporary history has the great 
advantage of being living history, involving the questions of the 
day; its sources are those on which the adult citizen must contin-

  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 13 
ually construct his own judgments, — judgments which underlie the 
history of the future. The newspaper, the magazine, the living 
man and woman, the growing connection of events, —all these are 
our own constant sources of information; and if the teacher himself 
has had a good training in history, it is a part of his work to train 
his students as far as he can to weigh this contemporary evidence, 
estimate its comparative values, learn to judge of character, recog- 
nize the causes and forms of personal bias, and form independent 
and thoughtful judgments, or, what is sometimes more to the pur- 
pose, learn to suspend his judgment altogether for want of sufficient 
evidence. In such a course, too, the student should learn how to 
help himself in a great library to the material which bears on the 
most recent questions. He should learn the use of cyclopedias, 
atlases, catalogues, Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature, with its 
supplements, the Statesman’s Year Book, and similar aids. 
A former student of mine, Mr. Adrian Yarrington, has developed 
this field very successfully in the Pratt Institute of Brooklyn. I 
quote from the Brooklyn Citizen of May 22, 1895, the following 
passage descriptive of his work : — 
Another room, No. 13, is given up to history and civics, of which Mr. A. M. 
Yarrington is instructor. Almost the same system is adopted here, and the 
boys and girls are made to think. When they get through, they can tell why 
they are Democrats, Republicans, Mugwumps, Socialists, or Populists, or any- 
thing else. They take up the President’s speech, paste it on the edge of sheets 
of foolscap, and annotate it. They draw maps of countries referred to, and 
tell the history of those countries. Under the head of ‘‘ Who was He, and 
What did He do for Progress?” is a collection of biographies of Jefferson, 
Clinton, Madison, Lincoln, Jackson, and other well-known men; while down 
in the corner of the blackboard is tacked a paper on the “ Effect of High 
‘Wages and Shorter Hours of Production,” by ‘‘ Wells,” evidently a young man. 
From a hasty glance at the contents, the writer is satisfied that Mr. Wells is 
on the right path. There is exhibited a bunch of debates on ‘‘ Free Trade 
and Protection;’’ while a lot of charts show the ‘‘ Rise and Fall of Political 
Parties.” 
Mr. Yarrington has charge, also, of the News; and the exhibit in the As- 
sembly Hall is one of the most interesting in the school. Here is the Pratt
-P-A-G-E-18

Institute Daily News with illustrated blackboard supplements. The News 
is written by some boys and girls assigned as editors. They arrive at school 
early enough to read the papers, and write on the blackboard epitomes of 
the larger news of the day. Then the editors have to answer questions 
of history, and draw maps, and be subjected to criticism by the whole 
school, very much like real editors; the only difference being that real edi- 
tors have the advantage of their critics, for they have waste-baskets for let- 
ters and things. The visitor will see some examples of the news in the 
“Growth of Our Navy,” ‘‘ Troubles in the Far East,” ‘¢ The Cuban Insurrec- 
tion,” ‘‘ Trolley-Car Fenders,” etc. In this hall, also, are ballots, returning- 
forms, and voting-booths, used by the school in its annual election; for there 
is one held every year, previous to that of November, and it is usually a reflex 
of what the older people feel. 
I am inclined to think that some study of this sort should be 
made in every school where history is taught. For assistance in 
this work, the following bibliographical notes for helps in current 
history may prove useful.

short reviews of leading articles in the chief periodicals, and their 
tables of contents month by month. It should be owned and read 
by every teacher who undertakes any work in contemporary history. 
Of the great English reviews, I am inclined to think that the Con- 
temporary will be the most useful single one. Of newspapers, let 
me recommend the London Weekly Times to one who would sweep 
the world. 
THE STUDY OF LOCAL HISTORY. 
Srupigs in contemporary history are, from the nature of the case, 
tentative, general, and fitted to train citizens rather than scholars. 
The training for the scholar is rather to be looked for in the field 
of local history, where he can most nearly come face to face with 
all the sources, and obtain the best training that history has for 
him in accuracy, the nice weighing of evidence, the sympathetic 
interpretation of the past. In the second place, through local his- 
tory the citizen finds a close and intimate connection with general 
history. The hills and valleys of his childhood take on the glam- 
our of romance that always comes from the touch of a bygone life. 
Here the Indians smoked about their council-fires; here passed a 
Spanish knight, armed cap-a-pie; here a pioneer first broke the soil, 
and stood ready, gun in hand, to protect his home from all inva- 
ders, whether wild beasts or wild men; here men sprang armed to 
conflict; here they suffered and died for liberty, independence, or 
perchance for human freedom. Memories like these add beauty, 
pathos, and meaning to the poorest landscape, and give to common 
life the touch of poetry. The traveller in Europe realizes this as 
he sees the pride and love with which the common people look 
upon their historic monuments. The great Cathedral of Siena, the 
exquisite bronzes of Florence, the memories of Tell among the 
Swiss mountains, of Napoleon and Louis the Great in Paris, — 
from these spring poetry and wonder for the child, and environ 
life with an atmosphere of charm which always lingers in his mind 
and eye.
-P-A-G-E-21
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 17 
In America our local history has not yet received its full develop- 
ment. We have been careless of our monuments and relics, which, 
to be sure, are of a different sort from those of Europe, though no 
less interesting and important to preserve; we have as yet no 
growth of song and story clinging like green vines about the 
broken fragments of the past; worst of all, we do not know our 
local history. All this the teacher can do much to change. 
First, then, let him ask himself: What are the connections of 
my city, town, or vicinity with the general history of the country ? 
Take, for instance, my own native place, Oswego, a dull little city 
on our northern frontier, lying asleep by the blue waters of Ontario. 
Commonplace enough it looks, and no great man and no great deed 
has signalized it; but let me tell you its connections. First of all, 
its Indians were the fierce Iroquois, best of all the fighting tribes: 
their songs and traditions still live among their descendants; their 
manners and customs, their village and forest life, are minutely 
described in the relations of the Jesuits; in the soil are still found 
their arrow-heads, and on their reservations they still make their 
primitive wares and fabrics. In the Colonial period, we have con- 
nections with Champlain, the Jesuits, and the fur-traders. There 
was still a trace of the old French settlement left when I was 
a child. There are old maps to be seen, showing Oswego as a 
wilderness, with a fort, a river, a few canoes and huts. In the 
French and Indian War we were an important frontier post, for 
which the French and British fought back and forth. Of the old 
forts there still remain the well-authenticated sites. With the 
Revolution we had but little connection, but with its close the 
period of our growth began. We were in the current of the great 
commercial and industrial wave which came from the opening of 
the Welland and the Erie Canals. The lake was white with sails, 
and every wind blew us in the lumber of Michigan and the wheat 
of Ohio and Illinois. In memory of this time still stands our noble 
lighthouse and the long stone pier, badly fallen to ruin, the green 
grass springing up between the stones, and old wharves, grass-grown 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  18 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
too, where idle boys fish long afternoons in the sun, while the tall 
elevators have one by one been turned to other uses, or have fallen 
to decay; for our importance and wealth passed away with the 
opening of the railroad, whose great line of the Central passed to 
the south of us. Our fine canal, with its locks, suffered decay as 
well; and the old taverns, with their wide piazzas, were deserted 
and haunted places. Still life went on in Oswego, and when the 
Civil War came we sprang to arms with the North. Our fields 
were white with tents; in a long shed on the lake shore our soldiers 
ate their rations; along our streets they marched away with tears 
and loud huzzas. To many and many a house came back the story 
of its hero, freezing, fighting, starving, dying for what he deemed 
the right. We children picked lint for the hospitals; one of our 
women marched away with her husband, and became a nurse,, 
well remembered and much beloved. A stanch old preacher, 
white-haired and ruddy-faced, almost worshipped by his people, 
prayed every Sunday to the God of battles to strengthen the 
hands and the hearts of the North. 
But I need go no further, though this by no means tells the 
story of the dull little town. What I have said indicates the lines 
of inquiry; the next thing is to see what the Oswego teacher will 
do with all this wealth at his command. We have already seen 
the value and the power of the source in history; the Oswego 
teacher in Oswego can use this for all that it is worth. In the 
library he will find four great volumes of the documentary history 
of New York. In these volumes the old maps, the old Jesuit 
relations, the lists of New York governors, the old military reports, 
are all embodied. He will set the children hunting there; ask one 
to find the first map which has Oswego placed upon it; another to 
find who were the first people who came there, and what they came 
for; suck these books dry of all they can tell about Oswego. He 
will go with his pupils to the county clerk’s office, and see what 
they can find there of the early government, of the first mayor, of 
the first common council, the first board of education; above all,
-P-A-G-E-23
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 19 
they will hunt up the old maps of the city. He will take his 
pupils to the fort, let them see why it is placed well for defence; 
take them to the soldiers’ graveyard, lying desolate on the hill, and 
let them wander among the graves and read the old inscriptions ; 
_take them along the wharves and the pier, and, setting them in 
the sun, let them write out, pencil and paper in hand, as well as 
they can, a description of how it looked in 1830, — what features of 
the picture were emphasized then, and what have vanished; what 
have been added; or perhaps a contrast of 1830 with 1896. He 
will set them to ransack their own homes for old letters, old news- 
papers, old relics, old bits of pottery, old costume, old weapons. 
He will ask some old soldier of the Civil War to come to the school 
and tell his story of the camp and the field. 
This work with the sources must precede all else, and much of it 
is especially fitted to be the very first work done in history. Even 
young children will appreciate the expeditions to points of interest, 
and will get something of the feeling of history. The next work is 
for the teacher and his pupils to reconstruct the local history and 
give it its connections. After the material is all gathered, comes 
the time to question it, and embody the answers in essays, classi- 
fied collections, public exercises, note-books, and all the rest of the 
paraphernalia of study. 
The questions which should guide this last work in the case of 
Oswego would be something as follows : — 
What was the Indian population here? What were their man- 
ners and customs, their thoughts and beliefs? What was their 
welcome to the white man, and what has become of them now ? 
Who were the first explorers and settlers? Where did they 
come from, and by what routes? Why did they come? Why did 
they settle in this particular place? What was their character, 
their education, their ideals, their faith? How did they make a 
living in their new home ? 
Had we any connection with any of the wars of the Republic ? 
Were any of our people at Valley Forge, at Yorktown, at Lundy’s
-P-A-G-E-24
20 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
Lane, at Gettysburg? Who were our heroes in these wars? 
Again, What connections have we had with the political, intel- 
lectual, and artistic world? Has there been a scholar, a states- 
man, a poet, who was born in Oswego, or who loved Oswego as 
a home ? 
I have been thus particular about questions which should be 
asked, because I could thus most easily reveal the wealth which 
this vein of local history may possess. 
One important outcome of these local studies should be the for- 
mation of local historical collections. These should be the result 
of the joint labors of the pupils and teachers of the whole locality, 
working together in a club. This museum should gather to itself 
the visible remains of the whole history. It should contain Indian 
relics, pictures of native Indians, photographs of historic sites and 
buildings, all the historic maps of the locality, photographs or other 
pictures of citizens who have been prominent at critical periods, old 
costumes and uniforms, old dishes, utensils, tools, coins, stamps, 
and portraits, — everything, in short, which serves as a material 
link between then and now. ‘There, too, should be found the files 
of local newspapers, made as complete as possible, and as soon as 
possible firmly bound. Letters, diaries, manuscripts, which have a 
local historic value should be collected and bound, or preserved in 
legible and authentic copies, the originals being preserved for the 
occasional reference of scholars. All the literature that has gath- 
ered about the place should also be gotten together, — any poems, 
novels, biographies, which celebrate the place or its citizens. The 
old people, the old soldiers, should write out or dictate their recol- 
lections, and these manuscripts be added to the local collections. 
There is still another class of sources we should save from obliv. 
ion, — those of our foreign immigrants. In every town, in every 
place, there is a large body of European immigrants. Where did 
they come from? Have they any pictures of their old homes? 
Why did they select this for their new home? What differences 
do they find between the old and the new? Perhaps they were
-P-A-G-E-25

Trish driven out by famine, Germans driven out by the conscrip- 
tion, Italians by heavy taxes and an extreme of poverty of which 
we do not dream. In nine cases out of ten their stories will be 
found to have interest and meaning, and should find a niche of 
their own in the museum and library of local history. 
But should we, in local history, deal with all the dull periods, 
make it a point to know the history thoroughly year by year, or 
deal with the salient points, the vital connections? Are we to 
mention such details as the smuggling of a dozen silk handker- 
chiefs or a bushel of salt, or the complaint of a citizen that his 
street is not kept in good order, or that there was a squabble in 
the court-room on such a day, or that John Mulligan, a native of 
Tullybamman, Ireland, came to live in Syracuse ? 
As teachers, we must deal with salient points, with points of 
vital growth and large connection. But in order to gain these 
points, to make these connections, somebody must search through 
large masses of material that may seem of very little use, and may 
yield little of significance. But there lies the way. If we are to 
know that at a certain time, in a certain place, men lived without 
law and order, until their misery and confusion drove them to some 
effective government, you can only reach this conclusion, if you are 
working with the sources, by reading in detail about this bushel of 
salt smuggled in, that fatal quarrel that ended with a shot, the dis- 
appearance of this herd of horses, rifling and murder on this or that 
lonely ranch. Or if you would know that the population of a cer- 
tain place came mostly from Ireland or from Spain, how can you 
know it except from just such details as you may learn from the 
tombstone or the marriage record, —in short, from such details as 
that John Mulligan, native of Ireland, came to live in Syracuse ? 
The pettiness disappears when the petty detail is one of a thousand 
strokes that paints a great and true picture. Or supposing that 
the petty detail is essentially petty, has no significance in propor- 
tion to the general whole, is but a splash of paint on the wall, — 
is it not worth something to learn what to reject as well as what to
-P-A-G-E-26
  22 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
accept? to know what has no worth as well as to know what has a 
story to tell, a place in a picture ? 
So local history has its place in study and teaching, —a place which 
nothing else can fill. There lies, finally, the labor, the reality, the 
very ground of history. There the citizen finds his home in the 
great world of time as well as in the great world of space. There 
he learns how to interpret history through the toil and heroism of 
some few men whose works he has seen, whose words he has read, 
in whose footsteps he himself daily treads. 
The Old South Work is the pioneer and feeder of all this local 
work in connection with the schools and the general public, as 
Johns Hopkins University has been for such work in the universi- 
ties. Its founder, Mrs. Mary Hemenway of Boston, saw that the 
life of history lay in its personal connections with what is here and 
now and still alive in us. The Old South lecturers have told their 
story in the very places where the story was enacted; the Old 
South Leaflets have given into every hand the very words of those 
who saw or acted it; and historical pilgrimages and historical 
explorations are following in the track of the lectures and the 
leaflets. But local work, from its very nature, demands many 
centres of independent life; and perhaps we are waking even now 
to the idea that not alone in Boston and Virginia, and not alone 
by Puritans and Cavaliers, has our great past been lived; but that 
the hunters of Kentucky, the zealots of Kansas, the fur-hunters of 
St. Louis, the miners of California, the farmer-pioneers of an ever- 
advancing frontier, have also been our founders; that not alone 
to courtesy and thrift and upright piety were we born, but also 
to independence, daring energy, bold invention, and adventure. 
But shall we begin history here and now with the local and con- 
temporary ? On the one hand, such reasons urge for it as have 
been given above, — reasons of interest, nearness, completeness, and 
training. On the other hand, the logical connection of events 
appears most simply and clearly in following their evolution 
through time. So they happened; so we wish to see them. The
-P-A-G-E-27

inquiry after cause and effect, the sense of time, find a far greater 
satisfaction in beginning as far back as possible, and in watching 
the simple unit widen its life through generations. Again, early 
life is simpler and more primitive, and so nearer the simpler, more 
intense life of the young. The child can understand Jason going 
after the golden fleece far better than he can the Tammany Tiger. 
Again, local and contemporary history have no meaning without 
some view of their connections through the long course of time, 
and on the wide field of the whole earth. The teacher at least 
must know these connections before making the least attempt at 
local or contemporary history. But, after all, this is @ priori rea- 
soning; and the question is one to be settled by experiments and 
observations, which capable persons are most sincerely urged to try. 
According to Stubbs, even from the point of view of training citi- 
zens, it is better to deal with ancient and medieval history, where 
the judgment may strengthen itself outside the reach of prejudice. 
SPFCIAL STUDY ON BALLADS AS HISTORICAL MATERIAL. 
Report By Mrs, HATTIE MAsoN WILLARD. 
Amone the tempting and accessible sources in English history 
are the ballads. They are stirring and interesting; they -purport to 
be historical,—but are they? How far are they safe to use as 
sources? One of my advanced students, Mrs. Hattie Mason Wil- 
lard, made a special study of this question last year, taking nine 
authentic ballads of the age of Queen Elizabeth, and comparing 
each of them carefully with the most trustworthy historical sources 
accessible. This study is based entirely on her work. 
The comparative character of ballad and history appears clearly 
in the following comparison of the ballad of Andrew Barton with 
the parallel passages taken from the most authentic chronicles of 
the period for the events treated. The material is taken from 
Part vi. of Zhe English and Scottish Popular Ballads, edited by 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
  24 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
Francis James Child, Boston (1889), pp. 335-342. The ballad runs 
as follows : — 
1. As itt beffell in m(i)dsumer-time, 
When burds singe sweetlye on euery tree, 
Our noble king, King Henery the Eighth, 
Ouer the riuer of Thames past hee. 
2. Hee was no sooner ouer the riuer, 
Downe in a fforrest to take the ayre, 
But eighty merchants of London cittye 
Came kneeling before King Henery there. . 
4. ‘To Ffrance nor Fflanders dare we nott passe, 
Nor Burdeaux voyage wee dare not ffare, 
And all ffor a ffalse robber that lyes on the seas, 
And robb(s) vs of our merchants-ware.’ . . . 
6. ‘He is a proud Scott that will robb vs all 
If wee were twenty shipps and hee but one.’ 
7. The king looket ouer his left shoulder, 
Amongst his lords and barrons soe ffree : 
‘Haue I neuer lord in all my realme 
Will ffeitch yond traitor vnto mee ?’ 
8. ‘Yes, that dare I!’ sayes my lord Chareles Howard, 
Neere to the king wheras hee did stand ; 
‘If that Your Grace will giue me leaue, 
My selfe wilbe the only man.’ 
9. ‘Thou shalt haue six hundred men,’ saith our king, 
‘And chuse them out of my realme soe ffree ; 
Besids marriners and boyes, 
To guide the great shipp on the sea.’.. . 
17. With pikes, and gunnes, and bowemen bold, 
This noble Howard is gone to the sea 
On the day before midsummer-euen, 
And out att Thames mouth sayled they... . 
[As for Andrew Barton : —] 
27. ‘Hee is brasse within, and steele without, 
And beames hee beares in his topcastle stronge ; 
His shipp hath ordinance cleane round about ; 
Besids, my lord, hee is verry well mand. ‘  
-P-A-G-E-29

28. 
40. ‘He hath a pinnace, is deerlye dight, 
Saint Andrews crosse, that is his guide ; 
His pinnace beares nine score men and more, 
Besids fifteen cannons on euery side... .” 
‘Now by my ffaith,’ sais Charles, my lord Haward, 
‘Then yonder Scott is a worthye wight.’ 
‘Take in your ancyents and your standards, 
Yea that no man shall them see, 
And put me fforth a white willow wand, 
As merchants vse to sayle the sea.’ 
But they stirred neither top nor mast, 
But Sir Andrew they passed by : 
*Whatt English are yonder,’ said Sir Andrew, 
‘That can so little curtesye ? 
‘I haue beene admirall ouer the sea 
More than these yeeres three ; 
There is neuer an English dog, nor Portingall, 
Can passe this way without leaue of mee. 
‘But now yonder pedlers, they are past, 
Which is no little greffe to me: 
Ffeich them backe,’ sayes Sir Andrew Bartton, 
‘They shall all hang att my maine-mast tree.’ 
With that the pinnace itt shott of, 
That my Lord Haward might itt well ken ; 
Itt stroke downe my lords fforemast, 
And killed fourteen of my lord his men.... 
But att Sir Andrew hee shott then ; 
Hee made sure to hitt his marke ; 
Vnder the spole of his right arme 
Hee smote Sir Andrew quite throw the hart. 
  Yett ffrom the tree he wold not start, 
But he clinged to itt with might and maine ; 
Vnder the coller then of his iacke, 
He'stroke Sir Andrew thorrow the braine. 
‘Ffight on, my men,’ sayes Sir Andrew Bartton, 
‘I am hurt, but I am not slaine : 
T’le lay mee downe and bleed a-while, 
And then I’le rise and ffight againe.
-P-A-G-E-30
26 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
66. ‘Ffight on, my men,’ sayes Sir Andrew Bartton, 
‘These English Doggs they bite soe lowe ; 
Ffight on ffor Scotland and Saint Andrew 
Till you heare my whistle blowe!’ 
67. But when the[y] cold not heare his whistle blowe, 
Sayes Harry Hunt, I’le lay my head 
You may bord yonder noble shipp, my lord, 
For I know Sir Andrew hee is dead. 
68. With that they borded this noble shipp, 
Soe did they itt with might and maine: 
The ffound eighteen score Scotts aliue, 
Besids the rest were maimed and slaine. 
69. My lord Haward tooke a sword in his hand, 
And smote of Sir Andrews head ; 
The Scotts stood by did weepe and mourne, 
But neuer a word durst speake or say. . . . 
71. With his head they sayled into England againe, 
With right good will, and fforce and main, 
And the day beffore Newyeeres euen, 
Into Thames mouth they came againe. ... 
Three contemporary chronicles record the same event. These 
chronicles relate as follows : — 
I. Hall’s Chronicle, 1548. In June (1511), the king being at Leicester, 
tidings were brought to him that Andrew Barton, a Scottish man and a pirate 
of the sea, saying that the king of Scots had war with the Portingales, did 
rob every nation, and so stopped the king’s streams that no merchants almost 
could pass, and when he took the Englishmen’s goods, he said they were 
Portingales’ goods, and thus he haunted and robbed at every haven’s mouth. 
The king, moved greatly with this crafty pirate, sent Sir Edmund Howard, 
Lord Admiral of England, and Lord Thomas Howard, son and heir to the 
Earl of Surrey, in all the haste to the sea, which hastily made ready two ships, 
and without any more abode took the sea, and by chance of weather were 
severed. The Lord Howard, lying in the Downs, perceived where Andrew 
was making toward Scotland, and so fast the said lord chased him that he 
overtook him, and there was a sore battle. The Englishmen were fierce, and 
the Scots defended them manfully, and ever Andrew blew his whistle to 
encourage his men, yet for all that, the Lord Howard and his men, by clean

strength, entered the main deck; then the Englishmen entered on all sides, 
and the Scots fought sore on the hatches, but in conclusion Andrew was 
taken, which was so sore wounded that he died there; then all the remnant 
of the Scots were taken, with their ship, called The Lion. All this while was 
the Lord Admiral in chase of the bark of Scotland called Jenny Pirwyn, 
which was wont to sail with The Lion in company, and . . . he laid him on 
board and fiercely assailed him, and the Scots, as hardy and well stomached 
men, them defended; but the Lord Admiral so encouraged his men that they 
entered the bark and slew many, and took all the other. Then were these 
two ships taken, and brought to Blackwall the second day of August, and 
all the Scots were sent to the Bishop’s place of York, and there remained, at 
the king’s charge, till other direction was taken for them. . . . 
II. Buchanan, about twenty years later, writes to this effect... . Henry 
was easily persuaded, and dispatched his admiral, Thomas Howard, with two 
of the strongest ships of the royal navy, to lie in wait at the Downs for 
Andrew, then on his way home from Flanders. They soon had sight of the 
Scot, in a small vessel, with a still smaller in company. Howard attacked 
Andrew’s ship, but, though the superior in all respects, was barely able to take 
it after the master and most of his men had been killed. The Scots captain, 
though several times wounded and with one leg broken by a cannon-ball, 
seized a drum and beat a charge to inspirit his men to fight until breath and 
life failed. The smaller ship was surrendered with less resistance, and the 
survivors of both vessels, by begging their lives of the king (as they were 
instructed to do by the English), obtained a discharge without punish- 
ment. ... 
Ill. Bishop Lesley, writing at about the same time as Buchanan, openly 
accuses the English of fraud. ‘In the month of June,” he says, ‘‘ Andrew 
Barton, being on the sea in warfare contrar the Portingals, against whom 
he had a letter of mark, Sir Edmund Howard, Lord Admiral of England, and 
Lord Thomas Howard, son and heir to the Earl of Surrey, past forth at the 
king of England’s command, with certain of his best ships; and the said 
Andrew, being in his voyage sailing toward Scotland, having only but one 
ship and a bark, they set upon at the Downs, and at the first entry did make 
sign unto them that there was friendship standing betwix the two realms, and 
therefore thought them to be friends; wherewith they, nothing moved, did 
cruelly invade, and he manfully and courageously defended, where there was 
many slain, and Andrew himself sore wounded, that he died shortly ; and 
his ship, called The Lion, and the bark, called Jenny Pirrvyne, which, 
with the Scots men that was living, were had to London, and kept there 
as prisoners in the Bishop of Yorks house, and after was sent home in 
Scotland.”

  28 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
On comparing this ballad with the chronicles, it is seen that the 
accounts differ widely in form and content. The chronicle has 
the form of prose historical narrative, the ballad that of rhythmic 
drama. The content of the chronicle is bare of personal and pic- 
turesque detail, aims to explain carefully how it happened; the 
ballad consists largely of this personal and picturesque detail, 
and aims to convey a picture and a feeling. We note certain inac- 
curacies, too, in the ballad when we bring it to the square of 
the chronicle. For instance, the name of the hero of the ballad 
is Charles Howard, who stands for the Thomas and Edmund 
Howard of the chronicles; the number of ships engaged on either 
side is one in the ballad as against two in the chronicles. Both 
these changes can be explained on the ground of the greater unity 
and simplicity demanded by the dramatic form. A third inaccuracy 
seems simply careless, —we can hardly see why the ballad should 
date the return of the ships just before New Year’s Eve, while the 
chronicle brings them back on the second day of August. The bal- 
lad, too, lets Sir Andrew go on in heroic speech in innocent uncon- 
sciousness of the fact that he is shot through heart and brain. 
Again, the ballad does not give the year, and it takes the Portu- 
guese complication for granted as known, which may be forgiven to 
a song sung for the men of the day, and forgetful of posterity. In 
the incident of the whistle, the ballad sides with the older chronicle 
as against the later, and is more likely to be right. 
But how is it when the comparison turns to larger matters of 
time, to the general causes and results of events? Here the ballad 
repeats the history. In England, in the days of Henry the Eighth, 
a Scotch pirate named Andrew Barton wofully harassed English 
ships and merchants; so that the king sent forth a nobleman, well 
fitted out, to chase and catch this pirate. After a most manful fight 
on either side, the pirate was suppressed. So far do ballad and 
chronicle agree. The ballad supplies, besides, the “birds singing 
sweetly on every tree,” the passing of the Thames, the “brasse 
within, and steele without,” “Sir Andrew’s crosse,” the threats of
-P-A-G-E-33
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 29 
Sir Andrew, the blowing of his whistle shrilly until death, and the 
bringing of his head up the Thames,— things which might have 
happened so, or otherwise, without affecting the main course or 
point of the narrative; that is, they are details not necessarily 
historical in their nature. 
On the side of actual history, many facts are given incidentally, 
such as that in the time of Henry the Eighth there were many 
merchants in London who traded by sea to Flanders and France; 
that this trade-was-molested by pirates, and that it was the king’s 
business-to protect it. Again, we see many details of_living which 
the chronicle takes for granted. Thus the merchants kneel before 
the king; the sailors are armed with pikes and guns and bows, the 
ships with ordnance; the Scot sails under St. Andrew’s cross; the 
merchants sail with white willow wands in sign of peace. 
Mrs. Willard then comes to this conclusion: that, where pictu- 
resque and dramatic history is in order, the ballad will furnish it; 
that it will, besides, serve as a source even for the main narrative, 
which it claims to give; while for such matters as language, dress, 
manners, equipment, range of trade, and all the contemporary envi- 
ronment from which these details are necessarily drawn, and which 
more serious chronicles neglect, the ballad takes its place as a rich 
and accurate source. By its very nature it draws such matters as 
these into its content; just as more serious history, by its very 
nature, draws into its content such matters, as names, dates, num- 
bers, political relations, and terms of war and peace. 
THE RELATION OF TRAVEL TO HISTORICAL STUDY. 
Puoptx often used to ask me, Why do you want to go abroad ? 
and I had some difficulty in finding a respectable answer. Of course 
it would be a great pleasure, and I thought I could see that the 
sight of objects would clinch the scientific or historical information 
which I happened to have about them; and I might even add to 
   
-P-A-G-E-34
  80 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
this stock. Still, although I felt, and everybody said, that there 
was some peculiar educative value in foreign travel, I could never 
exactly define in what it consisted; and of course the idea of 
going for pleasure only was entirely out of the question. 
If, however, I were now asked the question, Of what use is 
travel to the student of history? I should say, To bring him into 
contact with the sources of his subject. Not only books, but lands 
and peoples, contain these records of the past. Travel instructs us 
in environment, as books instruct us in thought and feeling. It 
shows us, first, the physical environment of a people, —the lay of 
the land, its gifts of sun and air, of food and shelter; further 
travel shows us the industrial environment, — the roads and cities, 
the markets and factories, by which a people weaves its nest into 
the wild tree of nature; best of all, we see the people themselves, 
as they move and speak and look. And here we come on the 
prime source of all —on the vital mass which makes history, which 
urges itself through all this inert environment, forcing from it 
product, action, organization. The land, the people, the body of 
life and product evolved by their interaction, —these are the 
sources with which travel acquaints us. 
There is a large class of facts about these sources which books can 
give us much more quickly and surely than travel; indeed, all that 
class of facts which may be described as exact information. The 
traveller who hopes to depend upon what he sees or hears for this 
kind of knowledge misses the value both of books and of travel, 
and is deservedly a laughing-stock for gods and men. Travel gives 
us something of a totally different sort; something to be seized 
by the heart and the senses rather than the intellect. For instance, 
the books will tell me all I want to know, — all I can know, — about 
the pyramids, — their size, history, use. I can become so learned 
about them in any great library, that seeing can add nothing to 
my intellectual knowledge of them. What is it, then, I gain as I 
stand among the palm-trees by the Nile, and see them far across the 
desert, clear outlines of pure form and warm color; or as, drawing
-P-A-G-E-35
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 31 
nearer, they tower above me, silent and solitary, on the edge of 
Sahara, while the Sphynx crouches near? What do I gain but 
some entrance into the spirit and sense of the old Egyptian, as he, 
too, saw them shining and towering there four thousand years ago, 
the self-same Sphynx crouching near? His spirit and mine mingle 
there by Sphynx and pyramid; and I am richer, not in learning, 
but in life. Or we are in France, in the midst of cheerful, con- 
tented, happy people thronging the streets, chattering and laughing ; 
or in Germany, running against boys with botany cases, and men 
' with spectacles, and always and forever against the army; or here 
on the desolate moor, with Stonehenge looming through the mist 
alone in the wide horizon. What is it we are gaining? Ten to 
one we know all we see beforehand; but now our knowledge 
enters through the senses, —the common highway of the human 
spirit, the same for all times and places, —and a breadth and eleva- 
tion of life itself, a widening of the personality, result. 
But another thing results from this wealth of spiritual experi- 
ences. Having acquired, we compare, test the spirits to know of 
what manner they are. So we grow critical, learn to know more 
exactly the worth and place of objects and people. Our standards 
change, and change upward and outward. For instance, as soon as 
we reached Rome we went to see Raphael’s Transfiguration, a can- 
vas famous through the world; but in our secret hearts we only 
wondered before it, and had dim suspicions that the genius of 
Raphael was a kind of myth kept sacred by a tradition that no one 
dared attack. But day after day passed, and not a day without its 
vision of high art. The antique, in all its simple majesty, took us in 
hand; silently the great gods and heroes of the Vatican and Capitol 
stood before us and said, “Look, look!” and we looked until, little 
by little, their beauty grew alive in our souls. At last, after two 
months of such schooling, we went again to the little upper room 
where the Transfiguration stood; and lo, the canvas was blazing 
with life and motion and color, and we knew that Raphael was 
in deed and truth the Raphael men said he was, —an archangel of 
high art. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
32 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
This rising standard of art carried other standards with it. 
Raphael and his great peers taught us to seek and demand every- 
where that same unity, purity, and strength which the classic pro- 
ductions of art embody. So came another advantage of travel, — 
the growth of powers of comparison and criticism, and the forma- 
tion of a higher standard. 
To the child, too, we should bring such benefits, and plan little 
journeys as part of his historical course. Hardly any school is 
so placed as not to be within excursion distance of some site or 
some collection of historical interest. Such sites, pictures, or col- 
lections are precious additions to the historical apparatus of the 
teacher. The way to the spirit of the child, as to that of the man, 
lies through the sense and the thing. 
THE TOOLS OF HISTORY. 
Authorities. —The authorities are based on the sources. If no 
history of England had ever been written, the man who would write 
it must go to the original sources: what is more, he must bring 
these sources into evidence through the whole of his work; for no 
authority to-day is considered trustworthy unless he refers to his 
sources. If he so bases his work, and does it well, he rises into 
the first rank of historical workers; if he bases his work on other 
authorities instead of on sources, his work takes second rank, and 
has no value for the scholar, except possibly as a handbook. A man 
who writes without references, composing his history from unknown 
or secondary authorities, is no longer respectable. A first-rate author- 
ity should give an accurate, interpretative account of what he finds 
in the sources, and he should give us references by which we may 
review or extend his work for ourselves. By the accuracy, com- 
pleteness, and character of these references, the scholarly quality of 
an author is largely determined; his power as an interpreter can 
be-judged only by those who know his sources as well as he, and 
who have an equal or greater power of interpretation.
-P-A-G-E-37
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 383 
Libraries. — Libraries, as is often remarked, are the laboratories 
of history ; therefore, the teacher or student of history should make 
it his first business to learn the library facilities of his own imme- 
diate vicinity, and to urge on every movement for their extension 
and improvement. A library has two uses: one, to collect and pre- 
serve books; the other, to give them the greatest possible circulation 
among the people. Fortunately, the second function of the library is 
much emphasized lately, so that in our leading libraries not only are 
monthly bulletins issued containing timely lists of books on current 
topics, and of new accessions, but, thanks to the lead of the Worces- 
ter library, the books on any special subject are lent in a body to 
any public school for a limited period; and, thanks to the lead of 
certain British libraries, the experiment of admitting the public 
directly to the shelves is being tried, —it is to be hoped success- 
fully. In addition to the facilities of public libraries, every teacher 
of history should try to build up a select collection of books under 
the direct ownership of the school itself. His own library should 
serve as an extension of this, and vice versa. In general, it may be 
said that the school library should contain general books of refer- 
ence for his subject, while his own library should grow along some 
particular line of interest, forming a special collection which will 
grow in time to be a very desirable addition to any general library. 
To effect this, one should look over the catalogues of second-hand 
dealers as well as over the notices of new books. The reviews of 
The Critic, The New York Nation, and The London Spectator, and 
The London Weekly Times may be recommended. For statistics and 
facts about American libraries, see the special report of the Bureau 
of Education for 1876, A new one will appear the current year 
(1896). 
Bibliographies. — The great need of bibliographies now appears. 
The teacher cannot go far without asking, What are the books on 
this topic? What are my best sources, what my best authorities ? 
In general, it may be said that the classified catalogue of any great 
library will furnish a fair bibliography under its headings of coun-
-P-A-G-E-38
34 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
tries and men. The catalogues of the Boston Atheneum, of the 
Brooklyn Public Library, of the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, 
and the Catalogue of History, Biography, and Travel, issued by the 
Boston Public Library, may be named as very valuable. The last- 
named catalogue contains a topical classification of books and arti- 
cles, often with notes indicating the point of view. The monthly 
bulletins, already referred to, often contain good special bibliog- 
yaphies, like that lately issued by the Providence library on the 
subject of Napoleon. 
Many of the articles in the Encyclopedia Britannica, in John- 
son’s Cyclopedia, and in Lalor’s Cyclopedia of Social and Political 
Science, close with a selected bibliography of books bearing on the 
topic treated. 
The following bibliographical aids will prove of special use: — 
Adams, C. K., A Manual of Historical Literature. Comprises brief descrip- 
tions of the most important histories, in English, French, and German, to- 
gether with practical suggestions as to methods and courses of historical study 
for the use of students, general readers, and collectors of books. Omitting the 
sub-heads, the chapters are entitled: Introduction, On the Study of History, 
Universal Histories, Histories of Antiquity, Histories of Greece, of Rome, of 
the Middle Ages, of Modern Times, of Italy, of Germany, of France, of Russia 
and Poland, of the smaller Nationalities of Europe, of England, and of the 
United States. New York. $2.50.

is indispensable for the beginner.

Exposition. This will prove of use to those selecting the beginnings of a 
library. For history, see pp. 114 and 402. 
Maps and Atlases. — Three sorts of maps are needed for use in 
history, — outline maps, to record the results of study; reference 
maps, containing the data for study ; and illustrative maps, which 
are diagrammatic in character, and which result from filling in 
an outline to illustrate a particular point. Thus an outline map for 
the thirteen English colonies should contain merely the tracing for 
the coasts, and the chief rivers and mountains, of the Atlantic sea- 
board; a reference map for them should contain, besides, every 
named settlement, mountain, road, whose site can be determined. 
A number of illustrative maps might be made for the thirteen 
colonies: for instance, a simple outline, colored red over the 
territory possessed by the English, and marking in bold lines the 
charter-boundaries, would illustrate their territorial extent; another 
outline might indicate with various colors the race-elements enter- 
ing into the settlement; another, the lines which settlement took 
from the seaboard to the interior. The maps described below 
are of all three kinds; maps of special countries and periods are 
not given, except for England.

perhaps, the most satisfactory general work of its class.

The Note-Book. — But how connect one’s self with all this appa- 
ratus of history? How make it applicable to one’s special aim 
and circumstance? Through some carefully arranged scheme of 
taking and keeping notes. Each teacher, each student of history, 
must make his own books of history, in which are his own special 
knowledge, his own special point of view, his own ideas and experi- 
ences embodied and accessible. Notes are not to be relegated to 
the top shelf, nor the disorderly drawer, nor to be written on odd 
pieces of paper with smudgy lead-pencils. Thought and money 
must be expended upon them. The merchant might as well expect 
to keep his accounts, or the curator of a great museum to catalogue 
his objects, in this way, as the student of history to classify and 
keep track of his notes in such careless and haphazard fashion. 
The keeping of notes presents many serious difficulties; but the 
following results of experience may help to solve them. 
Notes fall into four general classes : — 
Bibliographical notes. 
Copied extracts. 
Summaries. 
Reflections. 
As for the bibliographical notes, the form generally accepted con- 
tains four items,—author, title, date, and place, arranged as follows: — 
Renan, Ernest, Recollections of My Youth. New York. G. P. Putnam’s 
Sons. 1883.  
-P-A-G-E-42
  38 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
Wherever the bibliographical note refers to a book or article 
which has been examined, it is useful to add short notes, like the 
following : — 
Important article. Covers early part of period only. Romantic. 
Useless. 
If the book is not in your library, it will be also useful to add 
the name of the library where it can be found. For the keeping 
of bibliographical notes the teacher will find it perhaps most satis- 
factory to adopt the same system of library cards as that in vogue 
in most of our libraries. These cards are of uniform size, and in 
three colors, and can be obtained from the Library Bureau, 146 
Franklin Street, Boston, or from their agents in New York, Chicago, 
Philadelphia, or London. They come from $1.60 to $3.75 a thou- 
sand, according to style. 
The sample on opposite page will show their size and arrange- 
ment when filled. 
These should be arranged alphabetically, under topical division 
cards, in a long box or drawer placed conveniently for reference, 
or on adjustable sheets in a binder. These also can be bought, if 
desired, of the Library Bureau. 
The three other sorts of notes should be kept on sheets of paper 
of some uniform size, or in a series of indexed books. In the former 
case, the sheets of paper on a single topic should be kept together 
in some sort of neat portfolio, and thus index themselves; they 
can be easily shifted, rearranged, and superseded to suit the devel- 
opment of the subject in your own mind. Stiff sheets of manilla 
paper once folded make very cheap and handy covers for these 
notes. The following general rules for their handling may prove 
useful : — 
1. Write only on one side of the paper. 
2. Write only on one topic on one sheet. 
3. Never copy or summarize anything without making an exact 
bibliographical reference to the place where you found it.

-P-A-G-E-44
  40 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
4. Keep all your notes on one topic together. 
5. Leave sufficient margins for additional jottings. 
6. By underlined words or marginal headings call attention to 
the contents of your page. 
If you choose to keep a series of books instead of loose sheets in 
covers, the above rules also apply; but in order to carry out 4, it 
will be necessary to have the note-book paged, and to run an index 
of some sort. Nearly all those whose experience I have consulted 
prefer the system of cards and loose sheets; many make more or 
less use of color to indicate different varieties or sets of notes. 
But while there is great room for variation, yet the general rules 
here laid down are followed by nearly all those who make a serious 
business of history. 
THE RELATION OF ADJUNCT SUBJECTS TO HISTORY, 
NOTABLY BIOGRAPHY. 
Broararuy is so easy and so tempting, and so frequent an 
approach to history, that it becomes important to define its rela- 
tion to our subject. The subject-matter of history is woven by 
the interacting lives of multitudes of men and women. Its value 
lies in the chance it gives us to see how these lives evolve into 
freedom and power; its sources are the products of human lives. 
Then, do we not find in a concrete human life of a given epoch the 
most significant source of all? Through the biography of Colum- 
bus do we not most easily realize the actual conditions of his epoch? 
Do we not through him experience the government of kings and 
courts ? through him become acquainted with noble, monk, burgher, 
and serf? through him see on one side of the water monasteries, 
cathedrals, medizval towns with narrow streets and strong-built 
walls, and on the other side of the water primitive America? 
To all this varied medieval setting his life gives unity and mean- 
ing. At that one point we enter alive into a living world. 
This argument leads to the use of biography quite apart from 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY NATURE OF HISTORY. 41 
the less pertinent ones of ease and interest. But in this use of 
biography the nature of history must be strictly kept in mind. 
One should dwell on those biographies which are historical or 
typical, and should emphasize in these biographies their historical 
and typical side, passing lightly over the accidental or personal. 
Biography becomes historical in its value where it touches the 
common life, or contributes to the social progress of its time. 
Thus, the costume, the house, the ship, of Columbus, are historical 
in their interest, because they are typical, and illustrate the mode 
of life which he shared with his contemporaries. Again, all the 
events leading up to the discovery of America are historical, be- 
cause they show the evolution of an event of the highest impor- 
tance to social progress. On the other hand, the portrait of 
Columbus, certain relations with his family, certain details of his 
death, are personal in their interest, are neither typical nor im- 
portant from our point of view. Even these matters are often 
valuable from the teacher’s point of view, because, before histor- 
ical connections are formed, they serve as personal points of con- 
tact between Columbus and the pupil, and become attachments for 
the memory. 
Selected in this way, typical lives, like that of Benvenuto Cel- 
lini, or lives which lead and collect the thought and will of masses 
of men, like that of, Luther, are perhaps the most valuable of 
all the connective tissues of history, embodying as they do in a 
single living person like ourselves in many ways the civilization, 
tendency, and product of a different age. But the fact that these 
lives are valuable because they are embodiments or instruments of 
great societies should never be forgotten. Columbus was depen- 
dent on the sum of human discovery and invention which he 
found already in existence, — on the mariner’s compass, on Tosca- 
nelli’s map, on the ship developed by the Levantine trade, on the 
discovery of printing, which gave him the books of Ptolemy, 
D’Ailly, and Marco Polo; dependent, too, he was, on a mass of 
human belief and support sufficient to fit his ships and man 
 
-P-A-G-E-46

them. He was dependent on society, past and present, for his 
means. To these means he applied an individual genius and char- 
acter. Thus history works. The past gives a treasure of invention 
and product ; the present gives a workman, to whom invention and 
product are but stuff and tools. From this union of treasure 
and genius, history springs. If the treasure is rich and manage- 
able, if the man has insight and power, and thousands of human 
spirits at his call, the future springs mightily forward, and we get 
an age like that of the Renaissance. If the treasure is meagre and 
difficult of access, or if men’s minds are sluggish and unbelieving, 
a spirit of equal power, like that of Roger Bacon or Rienzi, may 
move the world but little; yet only so does the world move at all 
—by the application of individuals to the mass of historic and 
natural environment. From this point of view, again, biography, 
in its relation to human progress, gives us the vital chain by which 
generations take their place in the evolution of humanity. 
These same principles apply in using geography, literature, and 
art in their contact with history; those parts of these subjects 
must be chosen which belong to social progress. The prologue of 
the Canterbury Tales is historical, because it is a faithful contem- 
porary record of typical forms of the social organism. William 
Blake’s poetry, on the other hand, has little historical importance, 
since it is the record of a solitary and peculiar spirit. I say 
“little,” rather than “no;” since in the final analysis every human 
product, every human life, finds its place, and much of its expla- 
nation, in the social organism in which it grows. But some lives are 
caught in the main current, while others are swirled off into 
eddies more or less accidental in their nature; and we must 
never lose sight of the main current if we are to understand the 
stream of history, even in its eddies. 
And geography ? We often forget one main fact in regard to 
geography ; namely, that it is only a part of the environment of 
society, and is important for history only in this relation. As en- 
vironment, geography is vastly more important to primitive than
-P-A-G-E-47

to cultivated man. The Mississippi River was of immense impor- 
tance to the Indians; they could not develop life far from its 
shores. To us, with our abundant means of transportation and 
our engineering power, it makes little difference whether the Mis- 
sissippi runs north or south, east or west, a thousand miles away, 
or close at hand; to us the transcontinental railroads, part of our 
artificial environment, are much more important items. Much of 
what is called historical geography is accidental and unimportant. 
It mattered little whether the treaty that closed the Crimean War 
was signed at Paris or London, whether the battle which ended 
Napoleon’s career was fought at Waterloo or Aix-la-Chapelle. 
Geography should be insisted upon in history where it has been 
a people-making power, as in Greece, or where it has become a 
record of growth and achievement, as in the British Empire. 
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD DEDUCED FROM PRECEDING 
STUDIES. 
Tue materials of history are peoples, their environment, and their 
products; and since books are the great treasure-houses in which 
peoples have stored the records of their past, the library becomes 
the chief laboratory and workshop of the historian. But, after all, 
the student must remember that even books are but second-hand 
records, ill understood without living contact with men and things. 
“ For men and things are records, too, and the truest record of the 
progress of humanity. We can neither understand the man of the 
past without knowing the man of to-day, nor the man of today 
without knowing the man of the past. 
Since sources are the material from which historical judgments 
are formed, since their value depends solely on their nature as evi- 
dence, and since no historical judgments are permanent or complete, 
but only relative to circumstance and knowledge, we should not 
only work with sources as much as possible, but train ourselves as 
carefully as possible to a critical consideration of their nature as  
-P-A-G-E-48
  44 sftUDIES IN- HISTORICAL METHOD. 
evidence, as well as to a critical estimate of judgments based upon 
them. 
He should enter the field of history who understands and cares 
for people, who has a good sense of proportion and a judicial mind. 
Equipped thus by nature, the historical student should add as train- 
ing the study of the rules of evidence and the ability to handle the 
tools of his trade; namely, sources, authorities, bibliographies, li- 
braries, the knowledge and practice of the use of books. He 
must not only be able to handle these tools, but with them to ex- 
tract the answers to special problems; an art which he will only 
acquire by following up some particular problem to its sources. 
In this sort of work he can be trained in any good university semi- 
nary; but if he does the work he will get the training, whether in 
or out of a university, and from such work he should never allow 
himself to be parted. The teacher must never cease to be a stu- 
dent. By study alone can he keep his mind alert, his interest alive, 
his companionship with scholars unbroken. A teacher who is a 
student at fifty should be taken as a matter of course, and not as 
a phenomenon. 
History is not much longer destined to sleep while little books 
and dogmatic teachers tell weary souls what history was and did. 
Presently she will wake and enter into life. Then shall we see 
that the past lives in the present, and only there ; that into the pres- 
ent we must look, and look again, until we can discern the forms, 
ideas, institutions, of the past in their vital connections with the 
present. And as science has pushed her way out of the narrow 
text-book and the common schoolroom, with its dogmatic teacher, 
into the world of phenomena, and into special laboratories fitted 
with work-tables, collections, and apparatus, with specialist-students 
always at hand to assist and direct, so history is destined to push 
its way out of that same narrow text-book and common schoolroom, 
with its dogmatic teacher, into the world of human nature, and 
into special seminaries, fitted with maps, pictures, and books, with 
a work-table for every student, the whole presided over by a special-

ist who can guide the student to his sources, and show him how to 
interpret them truly and critically. The college will realize this 
first; but in time the seminary is as surely destined as the labora- 
tory to work its way in modified forms into every place where his- 
tory is taught. One aim will take us surely to this ideal end; 
namely, the endeavor to see, to feel, the real thing.

METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 
THE HISTORIC SENSE AMONG PRIMITIVE PEOPLES. 
Srupies of method have been in the past mostly deductive in 
character. This study is inductive, and seeks to find principles 
by the observation and comparison of such facts as relate to the 
historic sense among children and primitive peoples, 
The historic sense, as we have seen, has its elements. It is born 
wherever the human mind attains the conception of making a true 
record of real and concerted human action, progressive through 
time, and connected by cause and effect. Take the Sagas of the 
North, Herodotus, the Books of the Kings, Mommsen’s Rome,— 
take anything you will that men call history, and you will find this 
to distinguish it from myth and story, —that it is considered as 
true; this to mark it off from biography, — that it relates to groups 
of men; this to separate it from sociology, philosophy, or literature, 
—that actions are its theme, and these actions are related by 
cause and effect acting through continuous time. Wherever, then, 
in our examination we are led toward the ideas of a true record, 
of continuous time, of cause and effect, of the social unit, we are 
led on toward the historic sense. 
According to its desire and objects, this historic sense embodies 
itself in different forms. If it wishes a record for the memory, it 
appears as mnemonic or reference history, as lists of kings, priests, 
in some sort of chronology, embodying what is striking or easily 
46
-P-A-G-E-51
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 47 
memorable. If it wishes for glory or power, it appears as esthetic 
narrative or incident, choosing what is splendid, terrible, appealing 
to the senses. If it wishes to instruct, or develop a certain type of 
character, it becomes didactic history, choosing such material as 
may serve the purpose of its ideal; it becomes the history of the 
good and bad. If it wishes to explain, to connect the social unit 
with the world of being, it becomes philosophic or theologic history. 
If it wishes to discover simply what is true, it becomes scientific. 
We have hardly yet become conscious of the value and power 
of the historic sense. Yet it is the sense by which we enter into 
the life of universal man; by which we see him crunching his 
half-burned bones in his hidden cave, —see him sitting on thrones 
of gold, exulting in slaughter, —or by which we join the heroes of 
Thermopylae. Wherever man has lived, we live and feel and know: 
our own personality is widened by the personality of ages and races, 
until we run back for thousands of years, and out into thousands 
of souls; and equipped with this wider personality, this new en- 
vironment of intellectual and spiritual existence, we find ourselves 
able more deftly and certainly to understand the present and fore- 
see the future. Through the historic sense humanity becomes self- 
conscious and self-directing. 
How, then, does this precious historic sense arise, this self-con- 
sciousness of humanity, this organ by which we seize on the past 
and future of man? How shall we discover its dim, psychologic 
origins, its overgrown path? We must look in two ways, — to 
primitive peoples and to children. 
The Bushmen are reckoned as being in the lowest known stage 
of culture. Yet even among them, traditions of origin exist, and 
the missionary Bleek collected eighty-three volumes of their myths.’ 
Other Australian tribes rarely count beyond three, although they 
can go as high as seven. They have no way of marking time ; they 
have traditions of origin, and represent past events by dramatic 
dances. Here we find a general sense of past time, a notion of   
1 Daniel G. Brinton, in a letter to the author.
-P-A-G-E-52
48 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
a swarm of men hanging together, while the dramatic dance gives 
a primitive record of single events. In this case, then, we get all 
the beginnings of the historic sense, in vague ideas of time, of a 
social unit, of cause and effect, and of a record. 
The Veddahs of India count as high as five, have a tradition of 
origin, and worship their ancestors. Here, again, we meet the 
notions of cause and effect, and of a social unit enduring through 
time. This latter idea here enters the domain of faith; an impor- 
tant point to note later on. 
Let us strike a little higher in the range of culture, among the 
Polynesians, The Sandwich Islanders counted by tens, and recorded 
time by knotted cords or quipos, divided the year into months by 
the moon, worshipped their ancestors, deified national heroes, whose 
relics they sacredly preserved, had dramatic dances and epic songs 
representing incidents in the lives of their kings. Here we get the 
idea of continuous time, marked into definite periods which are 
recorded. The idea of the social unit has broadened from the tribe 
to the nation; the power to record appears in quipos, dances, and 
fixed epics, all under sacred guardianship, in order to keep them 
true and fixed from generation to generation. 
Let us try the Dakotas. They have a decimal notation going as 
high as a thousand. They have a calendar called a winter-count, 
divided into winters, marked by events and running back a hundred 
years, kept by pictographs on hides; they divide the year itself 
into moons; they have dramatic dances and legends of origin. 
Here we get all the beginnings of history; but more strongly than 
before, they appear to be bound together into a large unit of contin- 
uous time. The Chippewas, Creeks, Iroquois, were about equally 
advanced. 
How is it with the Esquimaux? They can count by tens into 
thousands. They reckon time by winters and nights; reckon the 
time of night by the position of the constellations; keep count of 
time by notched sticks; have traditions running back for hundreds 
of years; celebrate the heroic deeds of their ancestors by poems. 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 49 
Here history has become conscious of itself, and the poem gives a 
record fixed more or less firmly by its rhythmic nodes. 
Let us rise to another stage of culture. The ancient Mexicans 
counted on by fives indefinitely. They marked months and years 
by astronomical observations, and recorded them by a highly devel- 
oped calendar; had a geographical knowledge as extensive as the 
range of their merchants; recorded past events by picture-writing, 
which aided and fixed the oral tradition, while their calendar fur- 
nished exact dates. They worshipped national heroes, while songs 
and hymns embraced mythical legends. 
The peoples of Yucatan, Guatemala, and Peru were similarly 
advanced. Among the Peruvians, ancestor and hero worship was 
highly developed into a national cult, preserving fixed records of 
origin, and of sacred events and persons. Such are the facts which 
appear. What do they tell us of the evolution of history ? 
The first attempt at historical narrative appears in the myths of 
origin. In these, three elements of the historic sense appear, — 
the notion of past time, the notion of the social unit, and the notion 
of cause and effect. The notion of time is obscure and vague. The 
social unit appears in the conception of a tribe or people hanging 
together by itself. The idea of cause and effect appears in the 
attempt to explain this common swarm, who speak and look and 
act alike, by reference to some common origin. In its form this 
myth must be classed as philosophical. 
Let us see how each of these ideas grows. The notion of the 
social unit develops through ancestor worship into the worship of 
national heroes or gods, who embody themselves as national and 
divine rulers. This line of development embodies itself mostly in 
esthetic history, the history that adorns the individual by the glory 
of his family, tribe, or nation; that adorns him with an aureole of 
antiquity, splendid deeds, heroic character. Didactic history also 
springs from this same root, — the sense of the social unit, and the 
wish to keep it a unit bound together by the same ideals. Thus 
Clavigero tells us of the ancient Mexicans: — 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
50 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
“ We cannot express too strongly the care which parents and masters took 
to instruct their children and pupils in the history of the nation. They made 
them learn speeches and discourses which they could not express by the pen- 
cil; they put the actions of their ancestors into verse, and taught them to sing 
them. This tradition dispelled the doubts, and undid the ambiguity, which 
paintings alone might have occasioned; and by the assistance of these monu- 
ments perpetuated the memory ot their heroes and of virtuous examples, their 
mythology, their rites, their laws, and their customs.’ — Clavigero, ii. 11. 
The second notion which appears in the myth of origin, that of 
cause and effect, cannot be claimed by history alone; this attempt 
to answer how and why is the mother of science as well, and along 
this line finds a rich development in a whole range of nature myths, 
developing into natural philosophy, and finally into natural science. 
On the side of attempted history, it gives us all the myths of the 
culture-heroes, — stories of migrations, of the founding of towns, 
of the making of laws; a mass of pure fancy, most of it, historical 
critics discover. Yet this is the most creative of the historic 
notions; the myths exploded, the old stories discredited, — the 
mind still asks how and why, and so develops, first, historical 
philosophy, and at last, and painfully, historical science. 
The notion of continuous time appears later than either of the 
other historic notions, and seems more difficult to attain. The first 
step toward it is taken by the power to count; the next, by the 
continuous observation of sun, moon, and stars, reaching over peri- 
ods of not less than a year; and the last, by the invention of some 
way of recording time. This invention appears as a notched stick 
or bone, a knotted cord, a winter-count kept by events. This last 
form of the invention is of a special interest, as it is at the same 
time a calendar and a chronicle, sure to lead, if uninterrupted, to 
mnemonic and chronologic history. The Homeric catalogue of ships 
in the second book of the Iliad is a familiar example of this form. 
But how does that special element of the historic sense, the idea 
of a truthful record, develop? From three needs, —the need of 
recording property, the need of remembering ancestors, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 51 
need of conveying information. The notched stick may tell you 
how many oxen you own, how many ancestors you reckon, or how 
many enemies are on the warpath. In all these cases the record 
may be false; but its value depends on its being considered true, 
since it forms a last court of appeal. Hence the pains that are 
taken in early times to keep a record fixed, by giving it a permanent 
material like bone or stone, by embodying it in rhythmical songs 
and dances, or in conventionalized groups of knots or lines or pic- 
tures. Asa further development, these are placed under the guar- 
dianship of priests and temples, where they may be protected by 
superstitious awe. In every such attempt we recognize a sense of 
truth, a sense of the value of evidence, of the preciousness of the 
relic, the song, or tradition that was once contemporary. 
All the elements on which history is founded appear, then, among 
primitive peoples, — the sense of the social unit, the power to 
reason, the sense of continuous time, the invention of a true and 
permanent record, as well as the sense of its value. 
Let us test our conclusions by some special instances. Let us 
study first the winter-count of the Dakotas. This was a chrono- 
logical calendar, invented by the Dakota, Lone Dog, and consisted 
of a buffalo-skin, on which were painted pictographs, each repre- 
senting the most notable event of one year. About seventy years 
were reckoned backward, and the events to mark them were chosen 
by consultation with the oldest and most influential men of the 
Dakotas. What material did they choose as worthy of remem- 
brance? Of the seventy years, nineteen are marked by biographic 
details concerning warriors or unusual men of some sort; twenty- 
one by events that concern the tribe as a whole. Among these we 
note two years of famine, two of epidemics, two of dancing and 
feasting, a great eagle-catch, a great buffalo-catch, the building of a 
great lodge. Thirty-three years are marked by inter-tribal wars; 
five by inter-tribal peace; one by a pestilence striking many tribes 
in common; three by inter-tribal stealings. Three years are marked 
by notable events among white men; and these are specially note- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
52 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
worthy, as leading towards extra-tribal history. One year is marked 
by the appearance of Spanish blankets; one by the first distribu- 
tion of beef to the Indians by the United States government. The 
year of Custer’s Massacre takes no note of this event, but of the 
fact that the United States took their horses away from the In- 
dians! Another year is marked by the coming of the. whites; 
another by the first appearance of shod horses; one only by a 
supernatural event, although extraordinary natural phenomena, 
such as extreme cold, an eclipse, or a falling star, mark six years. 
The points revealed by this analysis are, that in the material 
chosen the main interest attaches itself to the tribe in its inter- 
tribal relations, although slight but important traces of an interest 
in other tribes and the whites appear. The historical character 
of the calendar is sharply defined by the fact that only one super- 
natural event appears. The very object of the calendar reveals the 
consciousness of continuous time, and a serious effort to mark it as 
such; the method of comparative consultation reveals a sense of 
truth. We get, then, in this winter-count all the elements of the 
historic sense but the idea of cause and effect, which, from the 
nature of the material, is lacking. On the side of form we have 
here a reference list of dated events; that is, the mnemonic or 
reference form, just on the eve of chronicle. 
Let us look in another direction, — at the clan-songs of the Poly- 
nesians of the Hervey group. Gill, who has collected them on the 
spot, and who resided among the people for many years, says : — 
‘*T soon found they had two sets of traditions, — one referring to their gods, 
and the supposed experiences of men after death; another relating veritable 
- history. The natives themselves carefully distinguish between the two.” — 
GILL, p. 7. 
In examining this collection of historical clan-songs, we find that, 
out of thirty-eight stories preserved, twenty-five commemorate some 
ancestor. In some cases this is the ancestor of a whole tribe; if 
not, of some notable family in the tribe. Eleven commemorate the
-P-A-G-E-57
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 53 
deeds of a hero of the tribe, not an ancestor; in one remarkable 
case this is of a culture-hero. Nine celebrate the collective action 
of the tribe; five seem to be told simply as interesting stories of 
love and adventure ; one seems to keep its place for simple beauty ; 
and one seems to have a distinct ethical purpose. Five only have 
a touch of the marvellous: this appears once in the form of a giant; 
once as a giant-oven; in a third and fourth the wonder is the com- 
ing of Captain Cook; and in the fifth, the first iron axe. It will be 
noted that in none of these cases does the marvellous depend on 
the supernatural. 
In these songs the historic interest centres itself almost entirely 
about individuals, related to those who tell their deeds and suffer- 
ings. These deeds and sufferings are almost always of interest 
and importance to the tribe, and are remembered with two objects 
apparently: one is to hearten the survivors and frighten their ene- 
mies by deeds of daring or terror; the other object is a very 
practical one, — namely, to keep alive feelings of revenge by re- 
counting past woes and sorrows. Add to these objects the desire 
to remember, and we get history; not in the form of a list, but 
in the form of a song, whose rhythms and refrains impress the 
memory and please the sense. You remember; you are struck; 
you are taught. 
Aside from these songs, these same tribes have pure mnemonic 
history, as seen in three lists of priests, including a succession of 
from nine to twelve men, and two lists of thirteen chiefs each. 
On reading the Bible to them, Gill notes that these Polynesians 
were greatly interested in the genealogies, and explains it by the 
fact that among them “the chief with the longest pedigree is most 
respected.” In fact, he further notes that the Bible has taken the 
place of their old songs and myths as a body of history (Gill, pp. 
352-353). 
In the Bible we get a body of history dealing with a people 
far advanced on the road to civilization. The genealogies give us 
a long vista of backward-running time; the events cluster always
-P-A-G-E-58
54 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
about the chosen people of God as the historic unit or swarm. But 
the interest is carried into Egypt and Assyria with the journeys 
and wars of their heroes; the narrative is carried on in chrono- 
logic order by the names and deeds of a genealogic succession of 
patriarchs, kings, and prophets; it is kept true and unchanged by 
records on stone, skin, and brick, placed under the guardianship 
of priests. It is mnemonic in its genealogies, esthetic and didac- 
tic in its narrative. These narratives, then, display the furthest 
development of primitive peoples in the field of history ; and fur- 
ther we will not look. 
To sum up: First, the knowledge which we call history rests 
upon the sense of cause and effect, the sense of the social unit, 
the sense of time, the sense of the value of a true record. These 
all appear early in vague forms, as in myths of origin; and all 
advance together, now this idea, now that, leading, but no one idea 
allowed to get positively ahead. Of the four, the idea of time and 
of the true record lag; and yet we find even these well developed 
among peoples as advanced as the Polynesians. 
Second, the whole mass of primitive historic material is essen- 
tially personal and actual; it commemorates the tribe, the hero, the 
ancestor, with which there is a personal connection. This inter- 
est widens as actions and events connect the tribe with the larger 
world. Thus the Indians become interested in the whites through 
their horses; the Polynesians in the English through Cook; the 
Jews in the Egyptians through Joseph. 
Third, the mass of primitive history appears in three character- 
istic forms: in myths, explaining the reason why,—a primitive 
philosophy, often permeated with primitive theology; in lists, used 
as a chronologic string to assist the memory; in esthetic and di- 
dactic narratives, intended to dazzle, terrify, or instruct. A most 
pointed instance of this last purpose is given by Gill (p. 336), 
where he tells us that one of his deacons confessed to having pro- 
voked a fight “in order that his name might go down to posterity 
with glory.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-59
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 55 
But how can scientific history evolve? The notions on which it 
is based, — time, the social unit, cause and effect, the true record, 
—all exist among primitive peoples; but how do they learn to 
combine these notions ? 
Mnemonic history cares only for memorable events, and pays 
little atiention to cause and effect; didactic and philosophic his- 
tory selects those events which are useful as examples for conduct, 
or which illustrate a theory of history; while esthetic history 
preserves only what is beautiful, glorious, and striking. Add to 
that, that the three last forms are often protected by the whole 
force of a faith and a social and moral system, and you have some 
notion of the difficulty in the way of the development of scientific 
history. A primitive people feels that the story must be beautiful 
and worthy, the great man wholly admirable—a divine ideal, 
beyond question. The story thus becomes fixed and sacred, so 
that it may be preserved in its pure and original form. But, alas! 
that original was not true; and now, confirmed by the faith of gen- 
erations, it is an almost impossible task to change, alter, or add in 
behalf of what may prove to be the truth. How, then, does the 
truth arrive? Through war, trade, and those endless questions of 
the critical mind, why and how. The sacred quiet of the tem- 
ple is broken by conquest and the rude irruption of the unbeliey- 
ing heathen. Once broken, the clashing of national myths and 
legends arouses scepticism, the mother of truth, and history be- 
comes broader in its outlook and truer to its records. The trader 
goes afield with his wares and his traditions. He finds other tra- 
ditions, upheld with as sacred energy as his own, perhaps more 
reasonable on their face; he doubts, he modifies, he questions his 
facts, and so comes to have a sense of evidence which enables him 
to distinguish between the false and the true. After the Greeks 
trade to Egypt they begin to be historians; the father of history 
was a traveller living in the days of the Persian wars. 
Trade and war are two ways which lead to historic criticism. 
The development of natural science brings us into a third way.  
-P-A-G-E-60
56 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
From the beginning, men try to account for things, to give a reason. 
If they do not know one, they invent one. If they find huge fossil 
bones in the earth, they tell stories of giants; if they live in a land 
called Hellas, they invent a first settler called Hellen; if they 
find themselves sowing wheat in a land where no wheat grows, 
they tell of the goddess who brought it from heaven and showed 
them how to sow it. These myths, half history and half science in 
their form, are a large part of tradition; and as they are tested by 
long experience, by wider knowledge of geography, zodlogy, phys- 
ics, they break down, knowledge supplants belief, and men trust 
more to law, to reason, to experience; and so the scientific spirit 
comes to the aid of the sense of evidence, and both develop that 
sense of truth which is sooner or later applied to history.

THE HISTORIC SENSE AMONG CHILDREN. 
What is true of the historic sense among children? Thanks 
to the kindness of the superintendents and teachers of Oakland, 
Santa Rosa, Napa, and Santa Paula, Cal., we have been allowed the 
opportunity to make tests of some 1,250 school children, in order 
to answer this special inquiry. 
The first test was given to discover what questions children would 
spontaneously ask if given a story without a date, a place, a name, 
oramoral. This test is supposed to throw light upon the compar- 
ative curiosity of children as to personalities, time, cause and effect, 
and truth. The story was the following, given verbatim, without 
remark on the part of the teacher, the children writing down the 
questions they would like to have answered : — 
There was a king who had a beautiful wife whom he dearly loved. Buta 
fair prince came and took her away to a far country. Then the king and all 
his men went to fight the prince, who lived in a great city, all walled about 
with stone.. For many a day the king and his men tried in vain to enter it; 
but at last, by a clever trick, some of his men got into the city, and burned 
it to the ground: and so the king got his wife once more. 
The following sample lists of questions, printed exactly as 
worded and spelled, will give an idea of the sort of returns which 
we obtained : — 
1. Average set from boy of eight. — How did the king get his wife when 
town was burning, wouldn’t she get burnt? Did the first king fight with 
the second? Why did the second king want wife. Did the First king go 
strait after the other king as soon as he got the wife? Did the king weep. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  58 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
2. Average set from girl of nine. —Did the king have a beard? How 
many years was the king married when his wife was taken away? What 
kind of a dress did the wife wear when she was married ? What was the name 
of the city that the prince lived in ? What was the name of the stone that was 
put around the great city ? What was the name of the prince ? 
8. Very complete set from girl of ten. — What was the skillful trick done ? 
What did the second king want with the first king’s beautiful wife that he 
took her to a far country ? Was the wife vain of her beauty ? Was she kind 
and good to her husband ? How long did the king fight to get back his wife ? 
Where was the wife when they were fighting ? Where was the first king when 
the second king was stealing his wife ? Couldn’t the king see the other taking 
her away ? Or was he not strong enough to fight the king ? Or was it night ? 
Was it night or daytime when the soldiers burned the city? In what year 
was this when they fought ? How long was it before he commenced to fight ? 
Did the king cry or feel sorry when he found his wife taken away ? What 
were the two kings names ? 
4, Average sets from (a) boy of thirteen and (6) girl of fourteen : — 
(a) Where did the King live ? What was hisname? Over what country 
did this King reign ? What was the Prince’s name ? Where did he take the 
King’s wife ? What kind of a trick did the King’s men make up to get into 
the city? Is this Story a fable ? What did the Prince take the King’s wife 
for ? 
(6) What right had this prince, to take the king’s wife away ? For what 
reason did this prince take her? Who was this king? Did the king’s wife 
want to go with the prince? Wheat country did this king rule? Where did 
the prince take this Queen ? What was the prince’s name ? How long were 
the men and the king trying to get into the city ? What man discovered the 
way into the city ? Why did they burn down the whole city ? How did the 
king get his wife from the prince ? 
On collating the answers, we found that they classified themselves 
under the headings, — who, where, how, why, result, personal detail 
and feeling, general detail, ethics, time, number, truth. The results 
of the classification appear in the accompanying charts 1-9. 
On examining our catch, we note the following phenomena: 
that the bulk of the questions appear under the rubrics of who, 
where, and cause and effect ; how, why, and result being massed 
under this latter heading. Of the three, cause and effect lead in 
point of interest; who comes second, and where follows as a close

| third. The interest in time is comparatively slight, but very steady. 
The same is true as to the interest in the truth of the narrative. 
The interest in general and personal detail is very much less than 
one might previously expect. The main interest, after all, follows 
the strong lines of action, and asks for a clear presentation of per- 
sons, places, relations of cause and effect; to which may be added 
in due but slight proportions, time, ethics, expansive detail. 
This point of interest has also been examined in our experi- Chart 9. Truth of Narrative.

  1 Since these tests were made, two new studies have been made which throw 
a decided light upon the interest which children have, not only in persons and 
places, but in names as such. Clara Vostrovsky, in a study on children’s own 
stories, and Agnes Holbrook, in a study on memories of things read, both found 
names to be a very prominent element. This relates itself, again, to the interest 
which primitive peoples have in names, and the great importance they attach 
to them. This is a subject which will repay further investigation. The indica- 
tions are at present that names should by all means be emphasized in our histor- 
ical work. See Studies in Education, ed. by Earl Barnes, Stanford University, 
Calif., July, Aug., 1896-
-P-A-G-E-68
  64 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD, 
mental school at Stanford in another way. A new story was told 
the children containing all the above particulars, fully expanded. 
After the lapse of a week or two the children were asked to re- 
produce it. The result of this test was very confirmatory of 
the test of the tale of Troy. A full account of it is given in her 
special study on the historic memory of children, by Miss Anna 
Kohler, p. 81. 
Not only does this test reveal the comparative interest in histori- 
cal elements, but it seems to indicate certain sex differences in 
the matter of curiosity. Boys appear more curious in regard to 
who, where, and how; girls show a greater curiosity as to why; 
and the curiosity of boys, with this one exception, is not only 
greater than that of girls, but culminates later. In regard to 
matters of time, truth, and general detail, we cannot see any differ- 
ence between the sexes. 
In order to make a special test of the power of inference, the 
children were asked to write down their answers to the following 
question : — 
If you were shipwrecked on an island in the middle of the sea, and you 
found in one corner of the island an old house of logs, and part of an old 
wooden boat, with broken arrows in the bottom of it, what would these things 
tell you? 
The following are typical examples of our returns : — 
1. Inferences of a boy of eight. —If you was shipwrecked on a island you 
would be in a fix. Were there Indains on the island. and Soldiers might have 
been on to. 
2. Inferences of girls of nine. —(a) If I saw a house on the island it would 
show me someone lived there; and if I saw a boat I would think it was a 
fisherman’s house, and the broken arrows lookes like the fisherman had been 
whaling. (b) The old boat I would of taken away and form the house some 
logs to fix the bottom of the boat and sailed to shore but if the tide was to high 
I would of taken the logs of the house and build it higher so as not to let the 
waves get over the boat and with the rest of the logs made oars. 
8. Inferences of girl of ten (somewhat above average).—I should think 
that there were Indians wrecked and that they built a log house for shelter until  
-P-A-G-E-69
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 65 
somebody might come to rescue them, and the boat was theirs; the arrows 
were the only weapon they had to defend themselves. They might have lived 
there a good many years and might have been rescued or they might have died 
of starvation, before I had started with my crew of men and before I had been 
wrecked. 
4. Inferences of boy of eleven. — The house of logs would tell me that some 
civilized person lived there that knew how to build. The arrows would tell 
me that they had no firearms and had to have some kind of a weapon. The 
wooden boat would tell me that whoever lived there was not afraid of drowning 
and that he had some means of fishing. All of them together would tell me 
that some one else had been shipwrecked before that he had been gone a long 
time by the decayed look. 
5. Inferences of girls of twelve and thirteen. — (a) I could tell by those 
things that there have been people living on the island. I can tell by the logs, 
trees have been growing there. I can tell by the boat there have been people 
that go out in the boat and catch things. I can tell by the arrows they have 
shot something. (b) If I were shipwrecked on an island in the middle of the 
sea, and found a log house and part of an old wooden boat with broken arrows 
in the bottom of it, I would think that many years ago, some one had been 
cast on the island and built himself the house. For the presence of the arrows, 
I would account by saying, that part of the crew of a ship had gone on anisland, 
for the purpose, —as the captain thought, —of gathering cocoanuts, but in 
reality of planning how to take the ship. One man, suspecting their intentions, 
waits till they have gone into the interior of the island, then springs into the 
boat, reaches the island in safety; and; having found out the mutineers’ plans, 
is about to return secretly to the ship, when he is discovered, and pursued. He 
reaches the water’s edge, jumps into the boat, and escapes the flying arrows 
shot after him. Darkness falling, he cannot determine the position of the 
ship, and after being tossed fora few days on the waves, he reaches this island, 
builds himself a house, and lives here until he is rescued by a passing ship. 
6. Inferences of boys of twelve and thirteen. — (a) If I was shipwrecked on 
an island and saw these things they would tell me that some man many year’s 
ago was shipwrecked and had built a hut to live in. He built a boat and very 
often went out for a sail. One day when he just pulling in his boat, a band of 
indians sprang out from the bushes and sent a volly of arrows at him. Thé 
only weapon he had was a revolver, running behind a tree beat them back. 
A few days after thinking all was well he launched his boat, when, as suddenly 
as before a much greater body rushed in on him. Before he had time to load 
the indians had sent hundreds of arrows, he fought bravely with sticks and 
stones but it was no use and was soon killed and his body taken to another 
island and eaten. (b) These things would tell me that somebody had lived 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  66 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
there a long time ago. I think that they had been partly civilized because the 
log house would be made by a civilized person. The arrows might and they 
might no‘ indicate that they were savage because people a long time ago used 
arrows before guns were ever thought of. 
7. Good critical inference of girl of fifteen. — That somebody had been there 
before me. That they must have been there a long while ago. That they 
must have been warriors, or else contended with some people who were war- 
riors. That they knew how to build houses out of logs, and must have had 
something to cut the trees down with. That they knew how to build boats, 
and had probably explored a little in one. That they must have known how 
to cultivate the land and to raise grain or such things. 
8. Good critical inference of boy of fifteen. —It had been inhabited by 
Indians. That they knew something about houses. That they knew how to 
make boats. That the island had trees on it. That they had no fire arms. 
That the people had tools. 
9. Poor critical inference of girl of sixteen. —I should at first think some 
other poor creature had shared my fate, but on further consideration, my 
thoughts turn to pirates and Indians, and I wonder which of these three, I am 
correct about. The last two are more probable, as a shipwrecked man would 
have a hard time making these things, without tools, which would have been 
impossible for him to bring with him. So I come to the conclusion that this 
island was either inhabited, at one time or other, by pirates or Indians. 
Every one of these papers would repay critical individual study ; 
but looking at the mass, the inferences class themselves under 
the following rubrics: — 
1, As to persons formerly on the island, — shipwrecked, savage, civilized; 
indefinite, special, and imaginary characters. 2. As to the house, — built, 
found. 38. As to the boat, — built, used for hunting or fishing, used for pleas- 
ure, brought people to shore. 4. As to the arrows, — made, used in fighting or 
inhunting. 5. As tothe desertion of the island, — on account of violent death, 
departure, natural death. 6. As to time. 7. As to a personal relation to 
objects. 8. Imaginary inferences. 9. Miscellaneous. 
The accompanying chart, No. 10, shows the result of this test as 
to the number of inferences made. It will be noted that this num- 
ber rises decidedly at the ages of twelve for boys and thirteen for 
girls, to an average which is kept fairly steady within the ages 
examined, with a constant tendency to rise, which calls for further
-P-A-G-E-71
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 67 
investigation within the higher ages. As to the character of infer- 
ence, Chart 11 shows the number of legitimate inferences decidedly 
pronounced at twelve for boys and thirteen for girls, and this devel- 
opment continues fairly steady, with some superiority on the side 
of boys, until the age of fifteen, thus supporting the curves showing 
number of inferences.

Aside from the common, legitimate inferences, such as, “Some 
savage race must have lived here because there are arrows,’’ there 
are three classes of inferences which deserve special attention: The 
personal, as in examples 1 and 26 ; the imaginative, as in examples 
56 and 6a; the critical, as in examples 6 3, 7, and 8. 
One may say that the personal inference, strongest with young 
children, disappears, to all intents and purposes, by the age of ten 
or eleven. Even at the age of eight it does not compare with the 
impersonal and legitimate inferences. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  68 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
The appearance of imaginative inference, as we might expect, fol- 
lows the general rule for inference, developing strongly at eleven 
with boys, and steadily increasing with girls, with no marked vari- 
ation. (See Chart 12.) . 
The cases of violent death may also be taken as inferences, 
which show the presence and development of the fancy. The 
——Boys Chart 11. Legitimate and Critical Inferences

  legitimate inference is that the people have disappeared in some 
way: without further evidence, we cannot say how; and if we do 
say how, as that they were killed by savages, or starved to death, 
or drowned, it is by force of fancy. The series of figures for this 
particular run as follows : —

This series confirms the notion that the imagination and the 
power of inference run parallel. Here, again, we find a series in- 
creasing up to the age of sixteen more regularly with girls, more 
’ irregularly in boys, and superior in the latter. 
As for critical inferences, such as we find in examples 7 and 8, 
their number is small; and within the ages examined, the boys are 
slightly but distinctly superior to the girls. (See Chart 11.)

One day we tried this same test orally in the experimental school 
at Stanford. I had expected interest from my former experience, 
but I was greatly struck by the eagerness which the children dis- 
played. It was as if I had opened a gate, and they ran wildly 
out hither and thither, making new discoveries. They not only 
wanted to tell me that there were people who lived there before, 
but that they were civilized, that they fished and hunted, and went
-P-A-G-E-74
  70 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
in boats on the sea. They also wanted to tell me how they might 
have disappeared, —by drowning, starvation, or slaughter. One 
boy said that perhaps we could find their bones, and then we would 
know how old they were. I assented to this, and happened to 
speak of the teeth, whereupon another boy capped the climax by 
saying quite soberly that perhaps they had false teeth. Their 
minds simply ran from inference to inference without effort, but 
with very little critical power. These children were mostly below 
twelve years of age. 
Summing up our evidence as to inference, then, the power is 
present at the earliest age examined; it develops strongly into 
legitimate and imaginative inference at the ages of twelve and thir- 
teen. On the critical side the power is rare, but, when present, 
clear and strong from the age of thirteen upward. 
In general, I have noticed this point in regard to this study in 
inference: that it varies more from school to school, in regard to 
number and character of inferences, than any other test set; from 
which I take it that inference is subject to great modification by 
teaching. 
A study by Mr. M. A. Tucker of Stanford University on this 
same subject shows that doubt begins to show itself about the age 
of thirteen, which is another way of saying that criticism begins at 
that age. His work also confirms the observation that personal 
inference ceases about twelve or thirteen. 
The sense of evidence was examined by the two following tests : — 
1. Write down something that happened before you were born, and that you 
know is true, and tell me how you know it is true. 
2. How do you know that such a man as George Washington ever lived ? 
Even at the age of eight the children seem to show in hazy forms 
all possible variations of the sense of evidence. The following ex- 
amples will illustrate : — 
1. Girl's evidence from family hearsay or tradition. — My mother’s grand- 
father got killed in the battle of waterlue. I know it is true because my 
mothers mother told her when she was a little girl and she told me.
-P-A-G-E-75
  
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. T1 
2. Girls evidence from general hearsay. — Because I have heard things 
about things that he did. 
3. Girl’s evidence from a relic.—I know that George Washington lived 
because I saw a picture of him. 
4, Girl’s evidence from general reading. —I know that George Washington 
lived because it was in the geography. 
5. Girl’s evidence from logic. —I know that my mother was in Berkeley 
before I was. The reason I know it is because she is older than me. 
6. Boy’s evidence from logic. —I know that such a man as George Wash- 
ington lived because he fought bravely in many battels. And another reason 
he never told a lie. 
Another amusing example of this is the following: — 
I know that George Washington lived because he did not get killed by the 
Indins. 
7. Boy’s evidence from eye-witness. — This school was built before I was 
born. Because I know a lady went to this school before I was born. 
The following are typical answers from children above the age of 
eight : — 
1. Evidence from the Bible by a girl of nine. — Before I was born Adam 
and Eve died, and thats why everybody else dies. The way I know it is true 
because it tells in the Bible. 
2. Evidence from an anniversary by a boy of ten. —I know that George 
Washington lived because if he dident they wouldnt celebrate his birthday. 
8. Evidence from logic by a boy of ten. —I know why such a man as 
George Washington lived, because he was so good and true, and would sooner 
die than stain his lips to tell a lie. 
4, Evidence of a boy of ten drawn from reason, hearsay, and reading. — 
I know because there are so many books written about him, and I’ve heard 
so much about him, and it must be true. 
5. Evidence of boy of ten resting on family hearsay or tradition.— My 
mother had to brothers fighting in North and South war, to get slaves free. 
One of them got wounded and died but the other got out all write but he only 
lived about one year after he came out of the war. Ino that was true because 
my mother told me. 
6. Evidence from relics of boy of eleven. —I know that such a man as 
George Washington lived because I saw his knives and forks and all such 
things that belonged to him at Smith’s Sonian Instute in Washington D.C. 
and he is the farther of our country because he at war wone it.  
-P-A-G-E-76
  72 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
Another example is the following : — 
I know that such a man as George Washington lived, because while coming 
from the east we went past Mt. Vernon and we seen the place where he used 
to live. 
1. Evidence from history by a boy of eleven. —I know that George Wash- 
ington lived because it tells us in history about him and history tells the truth. 
8. Evidence from relics of boy of twelve.—I know that Indians inhabited 
our land before I was borne because I have seen Indians skulls in wells and 
have found old arrows in the hills. 
9. Critical treatment of evidence by a boy of twelve. — The Battle of Ticon- 
derago, that happened before I was born, I don’t know it is so only what 
people have told me. I didn’t see it so I had to believe what people tell me. 
10. Evidence from relics of a girl of twelve. —I know that the War of 
1812 is true, because my grand-father fought in it, and before he died, he had 
badges remaining, which he wore at the time. 
11. Critical sense as to authorities expressed by a girl of thirteen. — Before I 
was born, the Acadians were banished from Acadia because our best historians 
say they were. We know that Washington lived because our very best his- 
tories say that he did. 
12. Evidence from eye-witnesses and relics by a boy of thirteen. — The war 
of the Rebellion was fought before I was born. ‘I know this to be a fact, 
bacause I know several men who fought in it, and my father was a boy when 
it was fought, and I have an old piece of Confederate money. 
18. Critical treatment of evidence by a girl of fourteen. —I know that such 
a man as George Washington lived, since all histories, books of any foundation, 
and all people agree upon that fact. This is the only proof that I have. 
14. Evidence from relics by a girl of fourteen.—A thing that happened 
before I was born was the Civil War. I know it is true for my uncle was 
in the war and we have a peace of the American flag and my uncle’s badge 
and we have the papers to show also. 
The whole mass of material was classified under the rubrics, and 
gave the results seen in Charts 13, 14, 15. 
The results of this study, then, appear to be the following : — 
1. That even at the age of eight the dependence on hearsay is not strikingly 
greater than the dependence on eye-witnesses and relics; and that this depen- 
dence constantly declines, being from the age of nine onward distinctly less 
and less than the dependence on historic sources. 
2. That the dependence on an expert authority, as shown in distinguishing

  histories from other books, and in distinguishing the very best from inferior 
histories, grows steadily and rapidly from the time of its first appearance. 
8. That the dependence on original sources, such as eye-witnesses, relics, 
documents, decidedly present at the earliest age examined, constantly develops 
until, at the age of thirteen, it takes and keeps the lead over all other sorts of 
evidence. 
4, That there is no marked sex-difference in regard to the sense of evidence. 
The sense of evidence was still more exactly examined by the 
following test. The children were given the two following ac- 
counts of the fall of Fort Sumter: — 
(a) The defence of Fort Sumter by Major Anderson was brave and stubborn. 
The garrison was under fire for thirty-four hours, the quarters being entirely 
burned, and the powder-magazine surrounded with a ring of fire; starvation, 
too, was staring them in the face. Anderson therefore surrendered, saluting 
his flag, as he marched out, with guns and drums and flying colors.

(b) Despatch from Major Anderson to Washington: — 
Sir: Having defended Fort Sumter for thirty-four hours, until the quarters 
were entirely burned, the main gates destroyed, the powder-magazine sur- 
rounded by flames, and no provisions but pork remaining, I accepted terms of 
evacuation offered by General Beauregard, and marched out of the fort with 
colors flying and drums beating, saluting my flag with fifty guns. 
Rosert ANDERSON. 
After writing down these two tests, the children were asked to 
write further in answer to the questions: Which of these two ac- 
counts is the better, and why? Which of these two accounts would 
you keep if you could only keep one, and why? It was found that 
children below the age of nine could do nothing with this test. The 
following are fair samples of answers received above that age : — 
1. From boys of ten.—(a) I think the second account is the best and 
should be kept because it is the best. (b) I think it would be best to keep 
Anderson’s because he knew more about it and because he was in the war 
and was the Captain. 
2. From girls of eleven. —(a) I think the first account is the best because 
the men are the bravest. (6) I think that Robert Anserson’s aought to be 
kept. Because Anderson was the General and he would know more about it 
so I think Anderson aought to be kept. (c) If these were the only two 
accounts in the world, about this matter, I think I would like to keep “B”, 
because Major Anderson wrote it. I think it would give me pleasure, to think 
that I own’d something, which one of the brave men who fought in battle, 
wrote. 
8. Critical answer of girl of twelve. —I think the second one is the best, 
because we don’t know who wrote the first, and we know that Major Anderson, 
who was in the battle, wrote the second. 
The following answers show a discriminating critical sense be- 
tween an original document and a narrative drawn from it : — 
1. From a boy of fourteen. —I would keep Major Anderson’s dispatch tell- 
ing about it because it isthe base upon which the other is obtained from. 
2. From a girl of fifteen. — The dispatch is also the very words of the gen- 
eral himself while the other might contain incorrect statements, as it is simply 
a discription written by some one no one knows whom, 
   
-P-A-G-E-80
  
76 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
A boy of fifteen discusses the matter at length: — 
If these were the only accounts published, I should accept the last, because, 
coming as it does, from one who had the best chance of knowing about every 
part, it is more likely to be correct. Then again, it is, apparently, the official 
report of Major Anderson to headquarters, and such a report is sure to be true. 
And also, the well known fine character of Major Anderson would insure its 
truthfulness, while, not knowing the authorship of the other, I do not know

_whether to believe it or not, without additional testimony, while the latter 
needs nothing but Major Anderson’s word. 
The development of the feeling for the relic is thus well expressed 
by another boy of fifteen : — 
I like the dispatch from General Anderson to Washington, better than the 
historian’s story about it, for the reason that General Anderson put it in his 
own words and was there and in danger of his life every moment and saw every-

thing and done everything, and the historian only heard about it. I would 
rather hear a story from a man who has been there and seen it all, that to 
hear one from a man who has heard it, and then told me. 
The results of this study are clearer and more satisfactory than 
of any other, probably because the test is so simple that its results 
are not clouded by obscuring sidelights on a variety of other sub- 
  
owe Chart 17. Chosen for Style   
             
ge 9 i 17   
  jects; they appear graphically in Charts 16-19, and may be summed 
up as follows : — 
1. We find very slight traces of sex-difference. 
2. From the age of nine onward, original material is preferred to secondary. 
3. This choice rests on three bases: — 
(a) The love for a relic, a visible connection with the past. 
(b) The desire for a genuine piece of evidence. 
(c) The critical sense of difference between an original and a de- 
rived account.
-P-A-G-E-82
  78 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
The first two bases shade into each other imperceptibly; the 
third is rare, but present in clear and definite form from the age of 
thirteen upwards, being slightly superior in boys. Its rapid in- 
crease upward indicates that it does not reach its limit within the 
ages examined. This curve confirms those given in connection with 
critical inference, as well as those resulting from the general test 
on evidence.

The following questions of reminiscence and observation were 
also sent out with the tests to be answered by adults :— 
1. Describe any plays which you have seen children play, into which his- 
torical scenes, characters, or events entered; as playing war, making a voyage 
of discovery, playing George Washington, and the like. 
2. Note any historical questions which you hear children ask : as, What 
made the people come here to live ? How long have people lived here ? Note 
any remarks or questions which show a total misconception of historical facts.
-P-A-G-E-83
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 79 
8. Note any historical poems, pictures, stories which you have known a 
child to produce naturally. What themes were chosen ? 
4, Note any cases of the preservation of relics in a child’s collection, and 
what reason he gives for their preservation. Are they there as mere curiosi- 
ties, or because he feels that they are old, and belong to a past time ? Notice 
particularly what reasons are given for keeping Indian arrowheads, stamps, 
coins. The contents of a child’s scrapbook may also be investigated from

this point of view, to see what selections are historical. A list of such selec- 
tions as are historical, together with the statement of their comparative num- 
ber, and the age at which they were selected, would be very useful. 
The material collected in answer to this request was very meagre, 
but indicates three things: First, a clear discrimination on the part 
of children between true and made-up stories, and a keen interest 
as to which class any particular story belongs; second, a tendency  
-P-A-G-E-84
  80 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
among children to picture, poetize, or dramatize their history ; and 
third, a keen interest on the part of children in historical relics. _ 
This last observation is further confirmed by a reminiscent study 
on children’s collections made here at Stanford University by Earl 
Barnes. Mrs. Dubois of Oakland, and Mrs. Hattie Mason Willard 
of Pasadena, have contributed to our collections interesting poems 
written by children under twelve years of age. Mrs. Willard and 
Miss Wilmattie Porter have given us some original historical pic- 
tures by children of the same age; while the tendency to dramatize 
history appears in numerous historical plays of the Indians, Brit- 
ishers, and the like. The following charming instance is given in 
Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett’s story of The One I knew the Best 
of All : — 
“What tragic historical adventures the Doll passed through in these days ; 
how she was crowned, discrowned, sentenced, and beheaded, and what horror 
the Nursery felt of wretched, unloved, heretic-burning, Bloody Mary! And 
through these tragedies the Nursery Sofa almost invariably accompanied her 
as palfrey, scaffold, dungeon, or barge from which she ‘stepped to proudly, 
sadly, pass the: Traitors’ Gate.’ ”? — Scribner’s Monthly, January, 1893, p. 77. 
Of the interest in relics Miss Alma Patterson contributes the 
following instances : — 
1. The children of the second and third grades, seven to ten years old, 
evinced a lively interest in the old cannon which had been used in taking San 
Diego from the Mexicans. Several told me of the fortifications on Mission 
Heights, of seeing the cannon half-buried in earth, and what they had heard 
of the Mexican life at Old Town at the time of the siege. They asked who 
took Old Town, how many ships he had, where he landed, and how he reached 
the town, and if any one was killed. 
2. In response to a request for flags for a special occasion, a little boy of 
eight years brought me a flag which his father had carried through the Civil 
War. He recounted the battles in chronological order, told me a little of the 
geography, and related an incident which I knew to be true. He seemed much 
interested in the flag, and very proud of the fact that his father had held it 
when one of the bullet-holes was made in it. The class of forty boys and girls, 
seven tonine years old, asked questions eagerly about the flag; ‘‘ Where did it 
come from?” ‘ What makes it so dirty?” ‘‘ What made the holes in it ?”  
-P-A-G-E-85
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 81 
“Were they real bullets out of a gun?’’ ‘What did they want to shoot at 
the flag for?’ ‘Do you think it was right to have a war?” One boy said 
afterward, ‘‘Couldn’t it tella lot of stories, though!” The children seemed 
to feel still more interest after I had given them a brief account of it, and sev- 
eral lingered to see it more closely, and one to “‘ touch the old flag.” 
The results of this study indicate — 
1. A main interest in persons and actions, causes and results. 
2. A good power of inference developing at about the age of thirteen. 
8. A strong interest in original sources, developing into a conscious sense 
of evidence about the age of thirteen. 
Conclusions as to method are summed up on pp. 100-105. 
SPECIAL STUDY ON THE HISTORIC MEMORY OF CHILDREN. 
BY 
ANNA K6HLER. 
For a year past a little class in history has been taught in the 
Experimental School connected with the Department of Education 
in Stanford University under the direction of Mary Sheldon Barnes. 
Tests have been given from time to time to show the progress 
of the children and the success of the methods employed. One of 
these is here presented as illustrating a method of investigation, 
and as throwing some light on the question as to what elements 
in an historical story most strongly appeal to children and take 
most lasting hold upon their memories. 
The story of Charlemagne was first carefully written by the 
teacher, and then told to the class on two successive days, taking 
a half-hour each day. After an interval of a week, during which 
time no mention was made in the class of Charlemagne, the chil- 
dren were asked to reproduce his story. All the time desired was 
given to them, the class finishing in an hour and a half. Five 
children took the test, three boys and two girls. It is to be noted 
that this test differs from those before reported on, in being given 
to a small number of children, each well known to the teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  82 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
The following is the story as given to the children : — 
All of the country called France, and part of Germany and 
Switzerland, was ruled over by a people called Franks. In the 
year 750 the king of this country died, and left the empire to be 
divided between his two sons, Carloman and Charlemagne. Charle- 
magne, of whom we are to learn the most, was at this time thirty 
years old, and seven times as tall as his foot was long. He was 
a very strong man, with light hair and beard, and a laughing ex- 
pression on his face. He wore a linen shirt and trousers, shoes 
and stockings, and over his linen suit a tunic trimmed with silk. 
On cold days he wore an extra coat made out of the skins of otters, 
and then over all this he wore a blue cloak with his sword at his 
belt. This was his everyday dress — for of course on festive days 
he would dress better, with jewels and more silk. When the 
country was divided, he received the part which is now Germany, 
and part of north-eastern France; and Carloman, his brother, had 
the land in the north and south of France. The western part of 
France was divided equally between them; but there were some 
people there who did not like to be ruled'over at all, so they re- 
volted, and Charlemagne had to march to the western part of 
France with an army to make them behave. Carloman went too, 
as part was his land; but he got mad on the way down, and went 
back, leaving Charlemagne to fight all alone. He quieted the 
people, and soon after this his brother died; and the brother’s wife, 
who thought Charlemagne did not like her, took her two little sons 
and went into Italy to live. The people now made Charlemagne 
king over all the empire of France. About this time Charlemagne 
promised to marry a princess who lived in the northern part of 
Italy ; but he changed his mind, and said he wouldn’t marry her. 
This made the people in northern Italy, or Lombardy as the place 
was called, very angry that their princess should be treated thus; 
and they asked the Pope of Rome, Hadrian, who was the head 
of everything, to put one of the sons of Carloman back on the 
throne of his father, and take it away from Charlemagne. But  
-P-A-G-E-87
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 83 
Pope Hadrian would not do this, and the Lombards marched down 
and began to attack Rome. The Pope had to send for Charle- 
magne to come to help him; and with an army Charlemagne 
marched over the Alps, and conquered the Lombards, making many 
of them prisoners. Charlemagne was now king over Italy as well 
as France, and this added much to his power. To the Pope, Char- 
lemagne gave some cities and presents, and made him think that 
he had more power than he really had. 
Charlemagne was a Christian, and built a beautiful church at 
Aix-la-Chapelle, with doors of gold and silver, marble and granite 
pillars, and he hired a great many men to do this work for him. 
There were so many things to do in this big empire that Charle- 
magne could not stay at one place to see that things were going 
on as he wished, so he had to give the work into the hands of 
some one else. The building of the church he left to a monk, who 
was to pay the workmen, and furnish the gold and silver needed. 
But this monk discharged a lot of the men, and kept the money, 
and piled it in chests until he had a big fortune. One day the 
house where he kept all his wealth caught on fire, and he came 
running in to save some of his chests. He was not satisfied with 
taking out one, but piled three on his shoulders, and on going out 
a beam of the burning house fell upon him and killed him; so Char- 
lemagne got all of his gold and silver again. Another time Charle- 
magne wanted a beautiful bell for this church, and one man told 
him he would make the most beautiful bell in the world if he 
would give him silver enough with which to make it. Charle- 
magne, not caring for money, gave the man all he needed to make 
a fine silver bell. But the man used only a little of the silver, and 
made the bell mostly of copper. When it was finished, Charle- 
magne was called to sound it; and, as it sounded very well, the 
men raised it up in the belfry, and one man tried to ring it by 
pulling the rope. He couldn’t make the bell ring, and many other 
men tried: no one could make it sound, so the man who made the 
bell was sent for; and when he pulled the rope the bell fell down
-P-A-G-E-88
  
  84. STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
on his head and killed him. Then Charlemagne found all of the 
silver that had been stolen. Charlemagne furnished the church 
with beautiful things, and no one was allowed to work around the 
church with poor clothes on; for all were furnished with good 
things to wear. 
In the part of Germany bordering on eastern France lived the 
Saxons, and they were not Christians. They made raids upon the 
Franks, and tormented them so, that for thirty years Charlemagne 
was fighting them. Finally they agreed to become Christians if 
Charlemagne would not fight any more. 
In the year 800 Charlemagne went to Rome to pray in the 
great church of St. Peter’s; and, when he entered the church, 
Pope Leo, who was the Pope after Pope Hadrian, placed a crown 
on his head, and all the people shouted, “ Long live Charles the 
Great, crowned Emperor Augustus of Rome.” 
When he was seventy years old he died, and was buried in a 
tomb in the beautiful church at Aix-la-Chapelle, and a gilded tower 
was erected over his tomb. 
This story consists of nine general groups of detail : — 
Personal description of Charlemagne. 
Division of empire between him and Carloman. 
Revolt of people, death of Carloman, and sole reign of Charlemagne. 
. Charlemagne’s relations with Italy. 
. Chapel of Aix-la-Chapelle. 
Story of bell. 
Relations of Saxons to the Franks. 
. Crowning of Charlemagne. 
. Charlemagne’s death and burial. SKINS AASyH 
These groups, analyzed and collated with the reproductions of the 
children, are to be seen in the accompanying table of groups. The 
total number of details contained in these nine groups, and col- 
lated from the original story, is one hundred and thirty-two. Forty- 
nine of these is the highest number remembered by any one child, 
and nineteen the lowest number, thirty-three being the average ;

88 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
sixteen details (marked with a +) were remembered incorrectly, 
and six new ones were added. 
In the first group there are fifteen items, as given in the table. 
Comparing these with the details remembered, we find that all the 
personal details are omitted by every child except one, who notes 
the age. All remembered the name Charlemagne; four remem- 
bered the father; three remembered his death; three remembered 
the time; two remembered the place; one remembered Carloman, 
but only as brother of Charlemagne, — ‘Charles had a brother; 
they became kings after their father died.” 
The second group contains five details relating to the division of 
the empire. All but one recall the items, and two errors occur. 
The revolt and the establishment of Charlemagne’s rule is the 
third group, and contains twelve details. Only three make an 
attempt to recall these details, four of which are given incorrectly 
by Reginald, who, in addition to his mistakes, puts the whole 
group at the end of his story. 
The fourth group, in regard to Charlemagne’s relations to Lom- 
bardy, and his becoming King of Italy, containing in all twenty 
details, was not dealt with connectedly by any one; and, of the 
sum of seven details remembered collectively, two were errors. 
Melvin and Reginald confused this group with the crowning of 
Charlemagne; and Helen made one error in regard to the Lom- 
bards attacking Rome. 
Twenty-eight items made up the fifth group, —the building of 
the chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle. All but one reproduced this group; 
and the details remembered by the children stand as follows : — 
Charlemagne built a chapel. 
Put man in charge. 
Gave him money to pay the men. 
Man put the money in a house. 
House burned. 
Saved three chests. 
. Beam fell. 
. Killed man. DTS

In the sixth group, giving the story of the bell, the details are 
twenty-five in number, of which from twelve to sixteen were 
remembered, as seen in the table. 
It will be noted that the mass of detail omitted in this group is 
connected with the description of the chapel. This reminds us of 
the omission of the personal description of Charlemagne, and is 
further emphasized by a previous study on Alfred the Great, where 
all detailed descriptions of Alfred and the peasant’s hut were 
omitted. : 
The next group, relating to the Saxons, was omitted by all. 
The eighth group, relating to the crowning of Charlemagne, 
although it must be said that it consists mainly of dramatic action, 
is but lightly touched by two. 
The ninth group, in regard to the death and burial, is entirely 
omitted. 
We can conclude from the facts revealed by the above study :— 
1. Children remember that which is necessary to the progress of 
an action, rather than word-pictures descriptive of conditions. Thus, 
details connected with personal appearance seem to make a slight 
impression on children. Has this any relation to their contentment 
with rude drawings of people ? 
2. It will be seen by the accompanying chart that the children 
remembered items by groups; the details were not related to the 
story as a whole, but to the groups in which they occurred. This 
is seen again in the fact that whole groups are omitted. As with 
details in the groups, so with the groups, those containing the most 
action are the best remembered. 
3. The chart also shows that what the children remember at all 
they remember quite accurately. 
4. In examining the sort of details remembered, the chart indi- 
cates that those are best remembered which are connected with the 
objects or actions within the children’s experience. A further test 
might well be made of this point. 
In turning from the general to the particular study of the chil-
-P-A-G-E-94

dren, we note first the number of details given by each child. The 
record stands as follows : —

details; he also confuses this story with that of Haroun-al-Raschid, 
given some days before. He puts the division of the empire at the 
end of his story, showing he had not a clear idea of the sequence 
of events; and he begins the story, “There was once a King who 
had two sons,” instead of using the original form, thus throwing 
the story at. once into the natural personal form it assumes in his 
memory. 
Anita remembers twenty-six details, of which one is a mistake. 
She changes “once he wanted a fine bell made” to the more dra- 
matic form, “Charlemagne told the man to make a fine bell.” 
She makes an inference when mention is made in regard to the 
bell being all right, saying, “it rang clear and sweet” when they 
sounded it. She particularizes the man who made the bell as a 
monk. In one instance she adds a definite time-limitation, “one 
Sunday,” and adds as a moral, “so some bad people get the worst 
of it.” 
Darwin makes five errors in the thirty-nine details remembered. 
He and Helen speak of the man putting the silver into a house, 
and complete the description, Helen by “locking the house,” and 
Darwin by making it a “little house.” Darwin inserts the word 
dishonest before monk; he makes the doors of the chapel of tin in- 
stead of gold and silver. In speaking of the man who made the 
bell, Darwin, as well as Anita, describes him particularly as a 
“monk.” Darwin adds in reference to the bell, “the man wanted 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 91 
to keep the silver;” also “at one time they couldn’t get the bell 
to ring.” He, as well as the others, shows a tendency towards 
dramatic action, as seen in such expressions as, “He thought to 
himself,’ “‘ Hurrah for Charlemagne!” 
Melvin is next to Helen in the number of details remembered, 
recalling forty. Of these, two are errors: he makes the doors 
of the chapel of copper instead of gold and silver; and the bell of 
brass instead of copper and silver. In order to explain matters, 
he uses such turns of phrase as, “Charlemagne had to go down 
to fight,” “the man did not want to put all the gold in the chapel,” 
“People liked Charlemagne,” “the man thought he would keep the 
silver.” He further defines the relationship of the parties by say- 
ing, “he gave the man who was at the head of his workmen a lot 
of silver.” 
Helen remembers the highest number of details. She has a 
tendency to note the element of time, as seen in the phrases, “after 
a while,” “came right away,” “once.” As a reason for discharging 
his assistants in the chapel story, she inserts, “the man thought he 
would like the gold and silver;” in the story of the bell, again, she 
says, “the man thought he would keep the bell.” She gives as a 
cause of Carloman’s return, “Carloman got afraid.” Helen calls 
the man who pulled the rope the “sexton,” and adds, “servants 
to bring the man who made the bell to Charlemagne.” Further 
additions are the expressions, “So he came and said, ‘Oh it’s all 
right,’” and, “the man pulled hard.” Helen not only remembers 
most, but most accurately. In the division of the empire she states 
definitely the share of each, and where an exact term is not given 
she is inclined to supply one; as, “when Carloman was half there.” 
She also shows the greatest desire for understanding the causation 
of events. This, together with the facts noted above, indicate that 
Helen is the child with the best natural historic sense. 
The value of these special studies of individual children lies in 
learning how each of them is related to the general statements 
as to'average, so that we may know how to apply our generalities
-P-A-G-E-96
  92 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
of method to each particular case. Thus, we learn that in the 
ease of Helen we have little to do save in the way of furnishing 
opportunity; with Reginald, we will insist not on his remember- 
ing much, but on his remembering well, and will take particular 
pains to see that he understands what he reads or is told in this 
subject. 
This study of the individual children has also revealed two or 
three other general points: one is, a tendency toward dramatic 
expression ; another, that where reasons are not given, the children 
seek to supply the deficiency ; and possibly a fondness on the part 
of children for definite detail is seen in such changes as that of 
man to “monk” or “sexton.” 
The points as to the historical memory developed by this study 
as a whole are : — 
The number of details which a child can carry away from a con- 
nected narrative is not much above fifty, and their number should 
be accordingly limited. In the story of Charlemagne, as at first 
told, nearly three times as many details were given as could be 
remembered ; the name, however, was not forgotten. 
Be careful to tell the story accurately the first time, since the 
memory of the children is remarkably exact in the field covered 
by it. 
Mass the details in groups about central characters or incidents, 
since the memory holds them in these connected units. 
Let action lead the story, which should be dominated by some 
leading character or event; omit detailed descriptions of buildings, 
dress, and persons which are aside from the main line of the story. 
Make the connections of cause and effect, since the minds of the 
children demand this sort of connection, and this connection will 
undoubtedly assist the memory. 
Dramatize the form wherever possible, since the children natu- 
rally remember the action in this form. 
The original story, modified by these criticisms, stands some- 
thing as follows : —  
-P-A-G-E-97
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 93 
In the year 750 there was a king who ruled over the countries we snow 
now as France, Switzerland, and part of Germany. He had two sons, called 
Charlemagne and Carloman. Before he died he called these two sons to him, 
and said, ‘‘Carloman, you are to have the northern and southern parts of 
France for yours; and, Charlemagne, you are to have all the eastern kingdom. 
I leave the western part to both of you;”’ and then he died. 
The people who lived in the western part of France did not like to be ruled 
over by these young kings, so they wouldn’t do anything they were told to do; 
and Charlemagne and Carloman marched there with some soldiers to make 
them behave. Soon after this Carloman died; and his wife, thinking Charle- 
magne did not like her, took her two sons and went to live in Italy. Then 
the people said, ‘‘We will make Charlemagne king over all the country.” 
After a while Charlemagne built a beautiful chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle, and, 
having more work to do than he could himself attend to, he put the building 
in charge of amonk. He gave the monk money to buy things for the work- 
men to use, and to pay the men when they were through. But the monk 
piled the money in some chests, and put it away in a house for himself, 
instead of using it as Charlemagne told him. One day the house where the 
chests were caught on fire, and the monk ran to save the money. He caught 
up one chest, but that was not enough; a second and a third one he took, 
and, piling them all on his shoulders, was just going out when a beam of the 
burning house fell upon him and killed him. 
It was for this same chapel that Charlemagne wanted a bell. A man came 
to him, and said, ‘‘I can make you the finest bell in the world, King Charle- 
magne, if you will give me silver enough to make it of.’’ This pleased Charle- 
magne. He wanted the finest bell in the world, and he had plenty of silver, 
so he said, ‘‘ Here is silver. Make me a fine bell, and use all you want.” 
The man went to work on the bell; but he used copper, and made only the 
outside of silver. When it was finished it looked like silver, and when Char- 
lemagne sounded it no one would have guessed it was not silver. The bell 
was raised to the belfry, and a man pulled the rope to ring it. But the bell 
would not ring; another man tried, and still another, and finally a lot of men 
pulled the rope, but not a sound came from the beautiful bell. What was to 
be done? ‘Send for the man who made the bell,’’ suggested some one; so 
off they went, and brought back the man. He stepped up to the rope, and 
said, ‘‘ This bell is all right; I’ll make it ring,” and with this he pulled very 
hard, and down came the bell with a great crash right on top of his head, and 
killed him. 
In the year 800 Charlemagne went to Rome to pray in the church of St. 
Peter’s. While he was in church Pope Leo III. put a crown on his head, and 
the people about all shouted, ‘‘ Long live Charles the Great, crowned Emperor 
Augustus of Rome.”

[The following questions in connection with the historic memory 
present themselves as matter for further investigation : — 
Are the errors and additions of children’s reproductions in the 
direction of vagueness or definiteness ? That is, are such changes 
and errors as the following typical: “bell of tin;” “monk” in- 
stead of “man;” the addition of a sexton to pull the bell, and a 
servant to call the man ? 
Do children remember best what is told them last, or what is told 
them first, in a story ? or simply what is best connected ? 
What further modifications will the last form of the story of 
Charlemagne receive in some school where it is entirely new?

SPECIAL STUDY ON CHILDREN’S SENSE OF HISTORICAL 
TIME. 
BY ALMA PATTERSON. 
One of our advanced students, Miss Alma Patterson, has during 
the past year examined the general subject of the time-sense as a 
special study in the department of education; and with her permis- 
sion I publish here that part of her work which bears particularly 
on the sense of historical time. In order to test this, the question 
“What does 1895 mean?” was sent to teachers of California 
through the medium of an educational journal. Answers were 
sent in from the city and country schools in various parts of the 
State, so that all classes of children were represented. One hun- 
dred and twenty children who could not write gave individual oral 
answers to the teacher who made the test. Miss Patterson reports 
as follows on the results of these papers: — 
Papers were collated from 2,237 children, 974 being boys ranging 
in age from six to twenty-two, and 1,263 from girls of six to nine- 
teen years. The answers, when classified, fall under five general 
heads: 1. Don’t know. 2. Name or number of the year. 3. Cor- 
rect historical knowledge. 4. Incorrect historical ideas. 5. Mis-

cellaneous. The miscellaneous answers were so few that it seemed 
unnecessary to chart them. 
Under the heading “Don’t Know,” summarized in Chart 1, are 
included those papers that frankly state, “I don’t know;” those 
that say, “1895 is a number,” or, “The number of our house ;” and 
those that number and leave space for the answer, but omit it. 
The striking thing that appears in this chart is the increase of 
knowledge during the first school-years, shown by the rapid fall of 
the “ Don’t-know ” line between six and eight years. There seems to 
be no legitimate reason for the rise of the boys’ line at eight, unless 
self-consciousness and timidity influence them, which may have 
been the case, as answers at that age were many of them taken 
orally, and by a stranger. Another noticeable fact is the closeness 
with which the two lines coincide. At fifteen years the papers of 
both boys and girls contain many omitted answers, owing to lack 
of confidence in the correctness of their ideas, or perhaps to indif- 
ference to so simple an inquiry. The rise of the line at fifteen 
years is almost wholly due to these omissions, so that in all the 
charts the lines are scarcely reliable after that age. Chart 2, en- 
titled, “The Name or Number of the Year,” is based upon those 
papers that recognize the time element in 1895, and attempt to 
identify it by saying: “1895 means the year,” “this year,” “The 
New Year,” “It is the name of the year,” “The number of the 
year,” “The date of the year,” “ Present time.” The state of mind 
which produces these papers shows no trace of the sense of histori- 
cal time, except as seen in a vague notion of named time. The 
chart shows that boys of six years have this idea more clearly than 
girls of that age. The fall of the boys’ line at seven corresponds 
in part with the rise of the “ Don’t-know” line; and it is to be 
noticed that as a rule from that time the girls’ line runs above 
that of the boys’, except from eleven and a half to thirteen and a 
half. Does this indicate that on the whole the girls take hold of 
the name more readily than boys, and that a name seems an ex- 
planation to them? Or does it indicate an agreement with other 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
  98 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
studies of this sort, which show the more rapid development of 
girls at certain ages ? 
Chart 3, entitled “Correct Historical Knowledge,” includes such 
answers as, “1895 means the number of years since the birth of 
Christ ;” “It means the nineteenth century and 95th year A.D. ;” 
“1895 years ago it was not Christ-time, and now it is;” “It is the 
age of Christ.” At six years none of these answers appear, but 
from that time up to the age of fourteen for girls, and fifteen for 
boys, the lines show a uniform rise. The following table shows the 
exact numbers giving these answers at each age : — 
Age 7 8 O20. Ld, 12 13 yy 15 
Boys 3 9 16 20 37 48 52 66 19 
Girls 3 6 12 28 37 46 56 66 66 
According to the proportions shown on the chart, the boys lead 
up to nine and a half years; the girls are then ahead until eleven ; 
the lines almost coincide at twelve ; the girls are again ahead up to 
fourteen. The boys’ line now soon crosses that of the girls’, keep- 
ing above it as far as the indications go. 
A chart to comfort teachers is No. 4, entitled, “ Incorrect Histori- 
cal Ideas,” indicating, as it does, that the historical ideas of children 
are largely correct. At six years, as we have seen, no histor- 
ical knowledge, right or wrong, exists. At seven, the interest of 
the children in George Washington is apparent, 8 boys and 2 
girls stating that 1895 means the number of years since George 
Washington was born, or lived, or died. The rise of the boys’ line 
at ten comes from their interest in the creation of the world, men- 
tioned by 5; and in the discovery of America, mentioned by 4. One 
says 1895 “is the number of years since the war;” and another, 
“since George Washington was born.” Of the girls of this age, 4 
mention the creation of the world; 2, the discovery of America; and 
1, the Flood. At twelve years the highest point of incorrect histori- 
cal ideas is reached for both boys and girls, the girls leading. At 
this age 5 boys and 7 girls mention the creation of the world; 2
-P-A-G-E-103
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 99 
boys and 2 girls, the discovery of America; and 2 girls, George 
Washington. Of boys at sixteen years, 3 give discovery of Amer- 
ica; 3, “The people became civilized ;” and 3, “ Adam and Eve.” 
In all, 31 boys and 31 girls mention the creation of the world; 
16 boys and 8 girls, the discovery of America; 5 boys and 4 girls, 
Adam and Eve; 13 boys and 2 girls, George Washington; making 
a total of 65 incorrect answers for boys, and 45 for girls. It is 
to be noted, however, that even in these answers the idea always 
appears that the year is reckoned from some very great event. 
In the miscellaneous class, 53 answers are given by boys of all 
ages, and 36 by girls. These answers fall into two groups, one of 
indefinite time, as that “1895 means days,” “A month of days,” 
“February,” “Easter.” These indefinite answers are frequent 
with boys of six, and disappear entirely at thirteen. Among girls 
these answers, most frequent at seven, have disappeared at nine. 
The second group of miscellaneous answers shows an unexpected 
moralizing tendency: 2 girls of seven, 2 of nine, and 1 of ten, say, 
“1895 means that we must die;” 4 eight-year-old boys say, “It 
means that the year is going;” 1 boy of nine gives the same 
answer. <A girl of eleven writes, “1895 means that more years have 
passed from our life than we think; ” and 2 twelve-year-old girls 
reflect, “One more year of life is gone.” A girl of thirteen says, 
“1895 means that I am getting old;” 3 boys of seventeen and 
older express a similar thought. This pensive, half-moralizing 
tendency appears most frequently before the thirteenth year, and 
more noticeably with boys than girls. 
In conclusion, these charts indicate that the sense of historical 
time is altogether lacking with children of seven, and may be de- 
scribed as slight up to the age of twelve. They also show that 
dates are understood by few before that age; by boys rather better 
than by girls, and that they are not demanded by the children. 
The sense of historical time on the whole seems somewhat stronger 
with boys than with girls before nine and a half and above four- 
teen and a half.

    100 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD DEDUCED FROM PART I. 
To sum up, — What do these studies on children and primitive 
peoples indicate as to the development and treatment of the his- 
toric sense, granting that this sense was correctly analyzed in the 
beginning as consisting in the notions of time, of cause and effect, 
of the social unit, and of a truthful record? The way is long, the 
goal is but a point; the study is tedious, the conclusion short. 
1. As to the order in which these notions appear, we see that 
among savages they appear all together in the rudimentary form 
of the myths of origin, which, unplaced in space, vaguely placed in 
time, attempt to give some true account of the beginnings of man 
and of the world. Such are the tales of Prometheus, of the Under- 
World of the Zuni, the Midgard and Ygegdrasil stories of the 
North. As the notions appear together, so they progress, none 
of them missing, now this one, now that one leading; but within 
the forms of primitive history we find small indication of a 
critical sense. History, then, appears early as a consciously sepa- 
rate field of human knowledge. 
Among children we find the same fact. From the age of seven 
onward we find them inquiring after time, cause and effect, the 
social unit, and the truthful record, —that is, all the elements of 
history lie within the field of the child’s curiosity; and it is inter- 
esting to note how early they inquire after origin: Who made us? 
Where did we come from ? 
The plain conclusion as to method here is that history is a suit- 
able subject for children from the age of seven at least. 
2. As to the sense of time, we see that this sense with savages 
is based on the power to count, and the power to record that count 
concretely, either with the fingers, the notched stick, or the knotted 
cord, and that it develops along with the development of the in- 
ventions for keeping count; in other words, that this sense requires 
much objective assistance. With children we have seen that the
-P-A-G-E-105
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 101 
sense seems slight, and that time is badly understood until the age 
of twelve or thirteen. The conclusion as to method is that the 
child should be assisted, as the savage was, by some concrete sym- 
bol or invention by which he can keep his counts in sight, and 
reckon time visibly. I think, then, that in teaching history one 
should always have by him a chart or net of centuries, as one has 
a map of the world, so that the children may place their heroes 
in time, as they do in space. In the Stanford experimental school, 
when such a chart for time was made by each child, one little girl 
of nine made the following enthusiastic statement to her mother 
about it: — 
“*T shall always try to keep my history book, because it has something very 
precious in it. It has a long line running through two or three pages all 
marked off in pieces, and each piece is a hundred years, and it tells you just 
where people are. The first part has Christ and Paul in it, and Rollo is in 
one part and a lot of other people.” 
3. As to the notion of cause and effect, or, to put it differently, 
the power to infer, we see that both with savages and children it 
is present from the beginning, but that it is unconscious with 
primitive peoples, and that with children the power does not be- 
come at all critical before the age of twelve or thirteen, and that it 
seems then to receive a positive impulse, becoming stronger as well 
as more exact. The conclusion as to method is clear, that children 
should not be especially trained or urged in inference until the 
ages of twelve or thirteen, and that then we may reasonably en- 
courage them to draw independent and correct conclusions from 
given premises. 
4. As to the sense of the social unit, we have seen that with 
primitive peoples this sense concentrates itself about ancestors, 
heroes, kings, developing into a sense of wider personality as their 
history, that is, their experience, widens. The interest of children, 
according to the indications, follows the same order; but, since 
education partially takes the place of experience, we cannot yet 
say positively at what age we may develop the larger interest; at
-P-A-G-E-106
102 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
present we may say not before the ages of eleven or twelve. The 
application to method is that history should first interest itself 
with the biographies of heroic and striking characters who are 
connected with the previous knowledge or life of the child; they 
may be connected with the myths he already knows, like those 
of the Greek or Norse heroes; they may be connected with the 
country, as Charlemagne with France, Columbus with America; 
they should always be connected with that life of action which 
belongs to children and primitive people alike. These biographies 
should be of men who fight and hunt and build, rather than of 
men who write or think or legislate. John Smith is nearer to the 
child than William Bradford. This biographic life may be drawn 
from many different sources, and thus lay the foundation for that 
comparative and critical history which is the next stage of vision. 
With children, we may allow instruction to take the place of war 
and trade in widening their narrow world. 
5. The sense of a truthful record seems to be quite positive with 
savages, although it does not occur to them to substantiate that 
truth by any searching criticism of evidence. Children, too, are 
very anxious to know whether a record or a story is true or not, 
although they are largely contented with being told that it is true 
by a person in whom they have faith, not showing a tendency to 
inquire critically into the matter until the ages of twelve or thir- 
teen. The efforts of savages, however, to preserve the original 
record or relic by every means in their power, as well as the in- 
terest shown by children in an original record or relic, indicates 
strongly the possibility, if not the desirability, of connecting his- 
tory from the beginning with original records, scenes, and objects, 
thus giving the children that material tie with the past which they 
desire as much as savages, and, in fact, as much as any one who 
has the least historic sense. 
6. As to the forms of history, we have seen that critical history 
develops last in the history of the race, being preceded by beau- 
tiful history, moral history, and mnemonic history, all these forms 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 103 
running along contemporaneously. With children we see that his- 
tory finds natural expression in stories, pictures, dramatic plays 
and poems, with or without a moral. From both these sets of 
facts I conclude that we should seek our history for children in 
Plutarch, Homer, and Shakespeare, before seeking it in edited 
documents with notes and criticisms of the modern school of his- 
tory. Nor must we forget that primitive history shows a large 
mnemonic element, appearing in lists and genealogies. This arises 
from the fact that the memory requires an artificial cog, and these 
lists and genealogies supply the place of the earlier knotted cord. 
Here, again, we are supported in the opinion that the teacher of his- 
tory to children should not neglect this indication, but should al- 
ways have at hand some form of chart or list or century calendar 
which can constantly be used, as a map would be, for reference 
in matters of time, until it becomes, as maps or words themselves 
become, a part of our symbolic mental equipment. The wide 
employment of esthetic and didactic forms of history indicates that 
they should form a large element in the early presentation of our 
subject. On the esthetic side, Homer, Ossian, the Nibelungenlied, 
on the didactic side, Plutarch and the Bible, give us plenty of 
appropriate material. The scientific forms must wait on the de- 
velopment of material, and also on the development of the critical 
sense ; that is, until the ages of twelve and above. 
7. As to the content of history, the instant widening of interest 
and curiosity among primitive peoples when brought into contact 
with new objects and people, and the instant awakening of interest 
in children at the sight of a strange relic or picture, indicate 
that we may widen the field of history as fast as new experience 
or knowledge can widen it. 
8. As to the sex-difference revealed in the directions 0. curiosity 
and inference, they are not pronounced enough to warrant a separa- 
tion of boys and girls; in fact, it is probable that no artificial 
method of stimulating these powers will equal the natural rival- 
ries of the schoolroom and the sexes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  104 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
The points as to succession of methods revealed by this in- 
ductive investigation are as follows: — 
Introduce the subject of history into the curriculum as early 
as the age of seven or eight, or soon after children can count and 
read, making no difference between boys and girls. Up to the age 
of twelve or thirteen, history should be presented in a series of 
striking biographies and events, appearing as far as possible in 
contemporary ballads and chronicles, and illustrated by maps, 
chronologic charts, and as richly as possible by pictures of contem- 
porary objects, buildings, and people. This series should appear in 
chronologic order, the biographies themselves forming the basis of 
the chronology. These biographies should be chosen from the field 
of action and interest allied to children’s lives; that is, they should 
be chosen from the personal, military, and cultural aspects of his- 
tory, and scarcely at all from the political or intellectual life. Great 
pains should be taken with the first presentation, since it plays so 
important a part in the historic memory. The whole field of gen- 
eral history should be covered in this way, and should be taken 
from such sources as the Bible, Homer, Plutarch, the Norse Sagas, 
tales of Indian warfare and pioneer life, voyages of great discov- 
erers. These should be given in their original forms, only modified 
by such omissions as are demanded by youth and inexperience. 
These primitive texts should be illustrated as richly as possible 
by portraits, pictures of relics and monuments, maps, charts, bal- 
lads, stories. : 
At the age of fourteen or fifteen another sort of work should 
appear. Original sources should still be used, selected with the 
utmost critical care, so as to furnish pure material; these sources 
should illustrate, however, not the picture of human society moving 
before us in a long panorama, but should give us the opportunity 
to study the organization, thought, feeling, of a time as seen in 
its concrete embodiments, its documents, monuments, men, and 
books. Now come the statesmen, thinkers, poets, as successors to 
the explorers and fighters of the earlier period; and they speak
-P-A-G-E-109
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE HISTORIC SENSE. 105 
more seriously in documents and literature: so once more the mind 
reviews the great field, but applies new powers to new material. 
Sources, of course, should still be used, but used with reflection; 
and the children should be encouraged not only to understand and 
remember them, but to interpret and criticise them. They should 
learn to read with increasing accuracy and fulness between the 
lines for the life and thought of the people they study, and for 
, the standpoint of the narrator. They may also be led more and 
| more to answer the questions: How do we know that this is 
true? What part is true, and what not? and how do you distin- 
guish between these true and untrue parts? 
Again, the fact that scientific history is based in the actual 
course of development upon comparative history as presented by 
trade and war, shows us that we must prepare the way for scientific 
history in education by separate special studies; while the study 
of children shows that we must not begin the work of compari- 
son before the age of twelve or thirteen, and probably not until 
fifteen or sixteen, since the constantly rising curve of the critical 
power indicates that it is still in rapid evolution at the latter age. 
In college still more advanced work follows, — the collection, com- 
parison, criticism of sources themselves, as well as their most 
critical interpretation. It is the age of monographic special study. 
This is the work that feeds the former sorts, giving purer, clearer 
sources for our service, and more and more sympathetic interpre- 
tations. The former sorts of work, in turn, give a background and 
an atmosphere for the latter; add warmth, color, distance, light and 
shade. How many a child longs to know something true and old; 
how many a college student finds his thesis a disconnected fragment, 
torn he cannot clearly see from where, and related he scarcely 
knows to what.

PAR eer 
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF HISTORIOAL STUDY. 
As we have seen, method has limitations imposed upon it by the 
nature of our study, and it has limitations imposed upon it by 
the laws of the historic sense. These two limitations are fixed ; 
but a third limitation is one which varies from place to place, and 
from time to time, according to the stage of culture and the ideal 
sought. It is the limitation of use or aim. 
The aims with which we study history to-day may be classified 
as follows: To add to the sum of human knowledge; to add to the 
diffusion of human knowledge; to form intelligent and patriotic 
citizens. In other words, we study history in order to discover 
new truth, to popularize truth, or to shape character and action; 
with the last aim the teacher actively deals. Let us take the ex- 
ample of a teacher in London, since he is far enough away to 
be seen in due perspective, and let us see how these considerations 
of action and character will determine his answers to a number 
of questions. 
First, What history will he choose? English history, because 
he wishes to form the character and guide the action of English 
people; and evolution teaches that we must connect what is with 
what has been if we are to determine what shall be. 
Second, What period will he choose ? The immediate past and 
the present, because out of these the immediate future is to grow. 
Third, What aspect of history will he take, — political, military, 
intellectual, social, industrial? Industrial and social, because the 
106
-P-A-G-E-111

questions of our age primarily concern themselves with these as- 
pects, and the problems upon us are industrial and social. 
These are rude and narrow answers; but I have put them rudely 
and narrowly in order to call attention to their essence. But let 
it be understood that the better English people understand their 
Norman and Saxon and Celtic forbears, the better they will under- 
stand themselves; and the more they see of the Frenchman and 
the German, the Roman and the Greek, the better they will know 
the virtues, vices, powers, and limitations of the Englishman. The 
better the English boy understands the methods by which politi- 
cal and religious peace and freedom have been won, the better he 
can see how to win social peace and freedom. So I would answer 
again, keeping the gist of the former reply, Let the English boy 
study the social and industrial history of his own England without 
fail; let him join to that, without fail, enough other history to 
make that history intelligible, and to connect it with the great 
movements and the great peoples of the whole world; added to 
that, let him study all the history there is time for, but study it 
all from the point of view of the young Englishman who is about 
to encounter social and industrial problems at the beginning of the 
twentieth century. 
Strange to say, our teachers of history, even college professors, 
never seem to sit down thoughtfully for an hour, and ask them- 
selves such fundamental questions as, What is history? Why 
do I teach it? and, How can I attain my aim? The result of 
this thoughtlessness is that the student too often leaves school 
without even the knowledge of the problems of his own day, to 
say nothing of his ignorance of those parts of history which apply 
to those problems, or of his ignorance of how those parts of his- 
tory which he has happened to study do apply. It is as if we 
had been called on important business from Boston to New York, 
and went by way of the Canaries. 
But to return once more to our London teacher. If he is to 
guide action and form character, will he present his history from
-P-A-G-E-112
  108 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
the sources or from the authorities? Will he try to have his 
pupils see how things really happened, or will he conceal certain 
actions and motives as immoral and cowardly, and unbefitting an 
Englishman? In other words, will he have his pupils learn by 
investigation or by authority? Here, again, his aim determines 
his method. His pupils are to be English people, surrounded by 
men and actions both moral and immoral, heroic and cowardly. 
They will read the last bill before Parliament, and the discussions 
upon it, which will contain arguments partly inane and partly to the 
purpose. He will read the last news from Africa, part of it true 
and part of it false; he will read the popular books of the day, 
some of them enervating, some of them manly. From these vari- 
ous scattered sources of his own time he must help to make the 
history of England in the twentieth century. Good and bad will 
not be served up on special and separate dishes, but will grow in 
some great common field, from which he must select for himself 
what is food and what is poison. So the London teacher of his- 
tory must bring to his pupils the sources as he finds them, choos- 
ing those most apt to the present. He will take his pupil to the 
Houses of Parliament, the Tower, to Whitehall. He will visit 
the British Museum to see Magna Charta, the Roman mosaics 
dug up in Kent, the plunder of India and the Pacific, so as in 
every possible way to connect the life of the past and the distant 
with that of the present and the near. He will bring in the con- 
flicting contemporary accounts of Cromwell and his Ironsides, and 
the various judgments of men as to the marriages of Henry the 
Kighth, or the life of Mary Queen of Scots; and through the inter- 
pretation of such conflicting sources of the past he will train his 
pupils to interpret the conflicting sources of the present. 
The advantages which these sources of the past have over those 
of the present, are, first, that they eliminate the element of passion, 
and help to form a judicial habit of mind; second, that we know 
with greater certainty how to interpret them, because we have, in 
the succeeding age, the answers to the problems they present. 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF sTuDy. 109 
But how much are these interpretations worth ? and what is the 
nature of the historical judgments in which they are embodied ? 
As we have seen, the worker in the laboratories of history must 
elaborate a product quite his own, with his own tools, from his own 
materials, and according to his own needs and powers. He must 
reach his own conclusions, solve his own problems, make his own 
book; his history of England will be no other man’s. Of course 
he will agree that Henry the Eighth was King of England in the six- 
teenth century ; but, according to his need or interest, he will study 
Henry the Eighth as the first head of the English Church, as the king 
struggling with Parliament, or as the husband of a series of wives; 
according to his knowledge of the other parts of history, he will 
form his judgment of Henry the Eighth, —a judgment which will 
necessarily change with every new perspective, and which has no 
absolute, but only a relative value as a part of the tissue of his indi- 
vidual knowledge. It follows from this point of view, then, as well 
as from former points of view, that we should work with sources 
as much as possible, and that we should learn to criticise them as 
carefully as possible, since they are the lasting bases on which all 
historical judgments rest. The judgments, on the other hand, are 
temporary and changeable, but are not on that account to be 
despised. They are rather to be recognized as the living product 
which history leaves in our minds. They are what we see; they 
are influences working on ourselves and others; vital things destined 
in their turn to shape and measure progressing history: made, they 
become, like every other human product, a source of human history. 
They are partial, but to that extent they may be true, if based on 
sound and truly criticised sources; and these partial truths become 
the vital path in which fuller truth may follow. Browning, in The 
fing and the Book, gives us a noble illustration of the relations of 
human judgment to fact and truth, and shows us how alone history 
can be justly wrought to the perfect ring. 
To sum up, the consideration of aims then leads the teacher to : — 
1. Choose history which develops from local and contemporary 
needs.
-P-A-G-E-114
  110 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
2. Teach that history from the sources. 
8. Train his pupils to form their own judgments, and to recognize 
these judgments as necessarily partial, and only to be improved by 
wider knowledge of the sources from which they are drawn. 
SPECIAL STUDY ON THE MAKING OF PATRIOTS. 
First of all, what is a patriot? He appears dumb and uncon- 
scious in the man who loves his land and folk; that is, the soil that 
feeds him, the roof that shelters him, the parents, children, comrades, 
that come and go about him, the church, the marketplace, the long 
roads out into the world, that have become a part of his every-day 
life. All this he loves, he clings to, and in time of need will fight 
and die for, — why not? it is his life, his world. But this love of 
land and folk is but a sort of vegetable inertia of the spirit, fed from 
the soil and air, inevitable to the creature who feeds and breathes. 
Even so we give the name of patriot. But there is a higher patri- 
otism in the hearts of men to whom life has come to mean, not 
only food and home and love, but self-government and justice; that 
is, independence and fair play, a chance to embody their own labor 
and thought, untrammelled by outside interference. To patriots in 
this sense, not merely land and folk are dear, but the nation, which 
embodies land and folk in a conscious, self-governed brotherhood, 
living securely under free and equal laws, by which it can develop 
their own peculiar character and work. This is what Fichte calls, 
in his famous lectures on the German nation, “the consuming flame 
of the higher patriotism which conceives the nation as the embodi- 
ment of the eternal.” How can such a flame be lighted ? How does 
the concept of the nation rise? How was it that France, Italy, 
England, Germany, and Spain came to be inhabited by homogeneous 
peoples, each people marked with its own physique, temper, and 
style, and each developing a distinct, valuable, and attractive type ?

ruary, 1887.

How was each people bound together in intimate union py common 
sympathies and common “points of view,” and, above all, by that 
common devotion to the “fatherland” and the “mother-tongue” ? 
Did it all come about through some resistless natural law, beyond 
the shaping of human energy? Or were these strong, fine nation- 
alities partly artificial, and so far imitable by so young and bright 
a folk as we Americans? Such questions are of value as well as 
interest. 
France and Spain were from the first noble natural estates for 
noble nations. They had mountains for miners and shepherds, 
valleys and plains for herdsmen and farmers, harbors for merchants 
and sailors; and all their rich resources were rendered interchange- 
able within by long and easy waterways, and defended without by 
barren wastes of sea and mountain. Nature having thus provided 
place, Rome came and added to the network of rivers a network of 
roads; gave the uneasy, fighting tribes a common speech and faith, 
and, above all, a peaceful, fixed abode in which she held them and 
defended them till generations of intermarriage brought forth the 
Frenchman and the Spaniard. 
Roman dominion faded and fell, barbarians harried and tore away 
whole provinces for themselves, a thousand barons cut the land into 
petty fiefs, but still the common race, the common speech and faith, 
survived; and when the greater medieval wars arose, and the Moors 
grew strong in the better part of Spain, and England tried to wrest 
away the half of France, the names of France and Spain sprang into 
powers, the people knew and felt the stir of patriotism, and roused 
in healthy hatred against “ outlandish” foreigners. National heroes 
appeared; the “Cid” became a name of Spanish pride; the faith 
and loyalty of France rallied about the Maid of Orleans; a thou- 
sand songs and stories began to gather about and glorify national 
deeds and names, and dignified and inspired the popular dialect in 
every countryside and mingled marketplace, until, from the Alps 
to Brittany, and from Gibraltar to the Pyrenees, two great nations 
had each its own common stock of glorious tradition and stirring 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
112 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
song. It was now that the kings began to embody the national name 
and the national unity. Sprung from some strong stock of the com- 
mon race, their saintly, brave, or gay and gallant figures became 
more and more the centres of common interest and devotion. Con- 
centrating the forces of the people, they won their way alike against 
the foreigner and the feudal lord; and by the end of the fifteenth 
century France and Spain were fully formed, consolidated nations. 
In wind-bound, sea-bound England, nature provided a national 
retreat even more complete than in France or Spain; there, even 
earlier than on the Continent, Alfred gathered all hearts in common 
love for a single English name, while constant war with Kelt or 
Dane compacted the folk into thorough, conscious distinctness. 
Song and story wrought their magic here as on the Continent, 
while a long succession of strong, if not always upright, sovereigns 
boldly sustained the name of England in all men’s sight. 
But England, Spain, and France were medieval growths, and 
must yield in vivid interest to Germany and Italy, which have 
nationalized in our own generation and before our very eyes. In 
the long peninsula of Italy, Alp-defended northward, we find again 
a natural unit, full of varied industry and resource, and long ago 
unified in faith and speech by Roman occupation; a land, too, rich 
beyond all others in great names, great deeds and songs. Material 
unity existed in the highest degree; but the spiritual unity of a 
national consciousness was lacking, nor had the people any centre 
about which to rally. For Italy was full of proud and disunited 
powers, each sustaining long historic memories of its own; and the 
larger Italy was overborne by the local interests and glories of 
tome and Florence, Venice and Genoa. Thus it came about that 
she became the common plunder of Europe, and was torn asunder 
by pope and king and emperor. Napoleon was the first to rouse 
her to genuine national consciousness, and to show her the vision 
of a united Italy, free from foreign intermeddling. But with 
Napoleon’s exile, Austria and Spain fell again upon their ancient 
booty; sword and spur rattled through the peninsula; the hated
-P-A-G-E-117

foreigner was everywhere, with his treacherous, boorish tyranny. 
But little Piedmont still nestled at the foot of the Alps, indepen- 
dent under the native rule of Savoy; in Victor Emmanuel and 
Piedmont, Italy found at last a true national centre, as in Austria 
she found a true national foe. Then, at last, local hate and jeal- 
ousy vanished in the larger hate and jealousy of Austria; then, at 
last, local pride was merged in the larger pride of Young Italy, 
while all names yielded to the first of great Italian names, — the 
name of Victor Emmanuel. 
The story of Germany is most significant of all. Through causes 
too long to deal with here, Germany had, in the eighteenth century, 
become a loose congeries of stubborn, petty states, of all sizes and 
sorts. In the days of Napoleon, the conqueror had dictated terms 
to Austria and Prussia, while the remaining German states formed 
the Confederation of the Rhine under his protectorate. It was 
just then that the conscious naturalization of Germany began, and 
that, too, in Prussia. Now, Prussia was in impossible debt to Na- 
poleon. French troops were quartered in her fortresses; her army 
was reduced to a paltry forty-two thousand ; half her land had been 
torn away and divided as booty. Since the days of Frederick the 
Great the upper classes had admired and followed all that was 
French in fashion and thought, and had not merely ignored, but 
had been ashamed of, all that was distinctively Prussian; to the 
lower classes the name of Napoleon stood for “ Liberty, Equality, 
Fraternity.” These were the circumstances under which men, 
whom events proved neither fanatics nor fools, dreamed of resist- 
ing Bonaparte, and, stranger yet, dreamed of a united Germany. 
That the dream should come true is hardly more wonderful than 
that it should be dreamed at all. But the dreamers were active, 
resolved, and silent in the time for silence; among them Stein was 
first and greatest. His first measures were in memory of the fact 
that a land must be lovable to be beloved. Prussia, like France 
before the Revolution, was under the “Old Régime” of an absolute 
king and a feudal aristocracy; there was no free trade in land; the
-P-A-G-E-118
    114 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
peasants were serfs; no man could leave the trade or the station 
of his father. By a few strokes of the pen, Stein accomplished 
a revolution; the serfs were freed, land was thrown into an open 
market, men were free to choose their own work without limit of 
rank or heritage. Thus, at one stroke, every available economic 
resource was opened to the poverty-stricken state, and the reason- 
able desires of men for a French Revolution were a long way met 
by the government itself. Scharnhorst made similar reforms in 
the army, abolished degrading punishments, and opened every 
honor to merit, and merit alone. Meanwhile, one of the Hum- 
boldts undertook to organize a system of public and universal edu- 
cation, by which all the members of the state might become its 
intelligent citizens; “Father Jahn” founded the Turnverein or 
gymnastic unions, which rapidly became ardent centres of patriotic 
enthusiasm; Fichte lectured in Berlin on German history and phi- 
losophy with set purpose of rousing a distinctive pride in German 
thought and action. Such the men and such the powers that began 
to form a modern Prussia as the worst foe of the Napoleons; and 
again, as at ancient Marathon, justice, skill, intelligence, spirit, 
overcame the tyrannous material might of arms. The “War of 
Liberation” proved the strength of the new-born state. From that 
day on, a united Germany passed out of the realm of dream, and 
became the talk of the streets, the teaching of universities, the 
agitation of courts; secret societies gathered their forces about 
the names of Teutonia and Germania; the great generation of 
poets, scholars, and thinkers that closed the eighteenth century 
gave to all who spoke and read the German tongue a common stock 
of thought and feeling; now, moreover, men needed no longer to 
look to France or England for the splendor of human achievement ; 
the names of Goethe, Schiller, Humboldt, and Kant—the heroes 
and honors of the epic War of Liberation — were already immor- 
tally and gloriously German. 
It was not for that generation to see the completion of the form- 
ing state; but men’s minds were riddled with ideas of a united
-P-A-G-E-119
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF sTuDY. 115 
fatherland, their hearts were full of feeling and longing; and when 
Bismarck’s policy ended at Sadowa the long strife of Austria and 
Prussia, the time was fully ripe. Then came the call to war against 
a new Napoleon. Germany coalesced against France, in the su- 
preme hour of victory elected Prussia as her leader, and the Ger- 
man Empire stood revealed to all the world, a fully equipped, 
patriotic, conscious nation. 
We are ready now to return to our prime inquiry, What can 
America learn of the making of nations from the peoples over the 
sea? In reviewing the making of France, England, and Spain, 
of Italy and Germany, certain common facts or laws appear: — 
1. Each of these national units has been based upon a more 
or less well-defined geographical unit; and the more isolated and 
complete this unit, the more rapidly has the nation formed itself. 
Thus England consolidates first, while the wavering boundaries of 
Germany eastward, and the long-disputed borders of the Rhine, 
show how hard it is to nationalize an indefinite frontier. 
2. Before their nationalization, the people in each of these units 
have acquired or possessed a common faith, speech, and blood. 
8. In each case national consciousness has been aroused by a 
struggle against some foreign foe attacking common possessions or 
interests. Thus Spain hardens against the Moor; thus France de- 
fines herself against England, Italy against Austria, Germany 
against France. 
4. This national pride and consciousness centres about some 
name, place, or office, embodying itself in tangible, speakable form ; 
this form again, reacting on the nation, consolidates and inspires 
its heavier masses into organic unity and life. Thus Frederick 
the Great stands for Prussia, Victor Emmanuel for Italy, the 
Republic for France, 
5. This consciousness has been strengthened and developed into 
national pride by the possession of common songs and traditions ; 
by memories of heroic deeds and dangers shared together; and by 
the possession of a common stock of glory arising from national 
heroes, poets, statesmen, and scholars.
-P-A-G-E-120
  116 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
But the most precious possession of all is national independence 
and free self-government. The Russian peasant burning Moscow in 
the face of Napoleon is a splendid example of human nature in 
heroic but unconscious struggle for individual existence; more 
splendid yet is the Italian at Novara, fighting, not for hearth and 
home, but for a free, self-governed state. How essentially this ele- 
ment of freedom enters the mind of the conscious patriot, appears 
in the famous message of Athens to Xerxes : — 
“There is not so much gold anywhere in the world, nor a country so pre- 
éminent in beauty and fertility, as to persuade us to side with Persia in en- 
slaving Greece. For there are many and powerful considerations that forbid us 
to doso, even if we were inclined. First and chief, we must avenge to the ut- 
termost the images and dwellings of the gods now burned and laid in ruins. 
Secondly, the Grecian race being of the same blood, and the same language, 
and having the temples and the sacrifices of the gods in common — for the 
Athenians to betray these would not be well. Know, therefore, that so long 
as one Athenian is left alive, we will never make terms with Xerxes.” ! 
On the other hand, Rome, —that Rome which in her heroic days 
did not despair of the republic, though Hannibal was at her gates, 
but poured life and treasure forth like water in tempestuous and 
effective flood, that Rome once turned imperial could find no 
patriot, but only hirelings, to defend her against Goth and Hun and 
Vandal; a case which shows that even a foreign foe cannot arouse 
a patriot if he have no free state in which to move, no free land to 
eall his own. 
Nowhere is patriotism better expressed than in its greatest song, 
La Marseillaise. 
“ Awake, ye sons of France, to glory! 
Now dawns the day of liberty! 
Against us flaunt the banners gory 
Of Europe’s hateful tyranny. 
O France, with sacred passion fire us, 
Ennerve our vengeful arms with might! 
O liberty divine, inspire us, 
And with thy sworn defenders fight, 
And with thy sworn defenders fight!” 
1 Herodotus, viii., ch. 144, Bohn’s edition.
-P-A-G-E-121
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF stuDYy. 117 
There you have it all, —the brotherhood of race and speech and 
Jand, the passion for the free and independent state, the hatred of 
the foreigner. 
Turning to our own land, we find her already following these 
same laws : — 
1. She possesses one of the grandest geographic units on earth, 
—grand by its imposing size and ocean-bound frontiers, and grand 
again by its wealth of easily interchangeable resource. 
2. Within these boundaries the dominant race is Anglo-Saxon, 
the dominant speech English, and the dominant faith Christian ; 
and immigration after immigration has but added to this domi- 
nant race excellences derived from long-tested European types, 
thus producing already a distinct Americo-Saxon. 
3. After a hundred and fifty years of loose colonial growth, our 
people were roused to national consciousness by a War of Indepen- 
dence which defined at once and forever America and the Ameri- 
cans from Europe and the Europeans. This consciousness and 
separation have been confirmed by two foreign wars, and by a 
constant play of international repartee and criticism, perhaps not 
always as weighty, but quite as sharp, as the sword of Bunker 
Hill. 
4. More and more does the nation tend to centre itself about its 
presidents as personal centres of Americanism. Washington, Lin- 
coln, Garfield, —these are already American names with which to 
conjure up loyalty and pride and devotion to our country’s flag; 
and we have but to note the attention which the papers paid to 
the sickness and death of Grant, and more lately to the most in- 
timate domestic affairs of Cleveland, to realize that strong human 
interests are drawing about our chief executives, thus concentrating 
our diffused patriotism on living, practical entities. 
5. Our stock of heroic national story is already large: first of 
all, the heroes and the deeds of the Revolution; while from our 
founders and pioneers, pushing their way westward against famine 
and flood, and a turmoil of Indian war and strange adventure, comes 
   
-P-A-G-E-122
118 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
a host of exciting and inspiring tales. Nor should our great 
engineering conquests be forgotten; the steamboat, the Morse tele- 
graph, the Atlantic cables, and the transcontinental railways are 
genuine American achievements, and are among the greatest and 
proudest possessions of the modern world. Nor do we lack our 
common fund of song and thought and story. Longfellow, Whit- 
tier, Lowell, Irving, Emerson, Hawthorne, are not merely national 
in the sense of being American-born, but in that they have poetized 
and illustrated American themes and American points of view, — 
have struck a distinctively American note in the great literary 
chorus of our age. 
But most significant of all, we have never passed through the 
state of unconscious patriotism; from the first our patriotism was 
rather distinctly for principles of government, for freedom and in- 
dependence. Of poets, statesmen, heroes, we are proud, and justly ; 
but prouder yet of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitu- 
tion, and the laws. No blind and dumb force, we face the world 
open-eyed, and, speaking clearly, say to each and all: “We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, 
that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. 
That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among 
men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, 
that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of 
these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and 
to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such princi- 
ples and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem 
most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” 
In spite of the fact, however, that America thus hitherto seems 
to have followed the general laws of nationalization, much still 
remains for the conscious effort of every citizen; holding in mind 
these general laws, he can favor more or less actively all means 
that tend toward the following results : — 
1. A firmer geographic union. Could our South and North be
-P-A-G-E-123
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF sTuDY. 119 
so thoroughly matted together with railroads as our East and West, 
we should soon see sectional peculiarities vanish, and populations 
mingled in interests, ideas, and manners. Railroads can do more 
than schools to Americanize our “ poor white trash,” and mutually 
unite estranged sympathies. The telegraph and newspaper, too, 
cement this union, which, in the final analysis, is one of knowledge, 
interest, and ideas, by keeping our whole people in daily touch with 
the same events from coast to coast. 
2. A distinct American type — an Aryan blood, an English 
speech, a Christian faith — should be the endless heritage of our 
people. In this blood, speech, and faith lie the deep springs of our 
civilization, and of our own individual life. Here are reasons for 
the discouragement of mixtures of Oriental and African with Amer- 
ican, for the teaching of our mother-tongue in every school, and for 
the adjustment of our laws by the standard of Christian as against 
that of Mormon, pagan, or atheistic morality. 
3. We must have the most intimate and universal acquaintance 
with our own history, biography, and literature; and, finally, must 
endeavor that American character and ideas be ably displayed in 
the persons of our successive presidents. 
The common school can do much to secure these ends. In the 
first place, it gives a common training to all the children of the 
State; in the next place, it is intrusted with the treasure-house of 
the American speech. And in that treasure-house are held the 
poems and the stories of Longfellow and Lowell, of Cooper and 
Irving — American possessions, smacking of the soil; and in that 
treasure-house are stored the records of heroes from Washington 
to Grant and Lee, the records of the great achievements of our 
common people in our Revolution, in our Civil War, in our pioneer 
march from the Alleghanies to the Golden Gate; there, best of all, 
are stored our constitutions and our laws. In this literature, in 
these records, we find the historic body and spirit of America; 
here we find the food on which to nourish Americans. 
The examples of Victor Emmanuel and Stein show what con-

scious action can do against most fearful odds; and there is no 
doubt but that in our own country the conscious action of our 
more intelligent citizens can save any part of our nationality from 
being swamped in the European or the Oriental current. Precious 
and sacred as the heritage of our national character is, it is by no 
means safe. The influence of the European mode of thought, style 
of life, and relation of classes, upon our educated and travelled 
people is enormous and increasing; thence threatens the love of 
luxury, the shame of labor, the feeling and style of the aristocrat. 
On the other hand, a force of ignorant, restless anarchy sweeps 
through our lower classes with a tide swelled fast by daily immi- 
gration. Meanwhile, in sections of our cities, and even in sections 
of our country, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia, China, seem to have 
settled bodily, with the weight of resistless generations behind 
them. Yet Heaven avert the omen that our America should be- 
come a cosmopolitan museum of races and opinions and manners, 
jostling one another in unrelated proximity! An ideal is that of 
the strong organic nation, compacted of interdependent states, 
bound together by a network of material interests and spiritual 
sympathies. In preserving the “sacred palladium of liberty,” we 
have perhaps forgotten the primal duty of self-preservation. Free- 
dom and happiness are not the only ideals for a people to set be- 
fore itself. It should quite as jealously guard its independence, 
its character, its individuality among nations; for therein lies its 
power and worth in that great congress of Aryan peoples, to which 
the Englishman brings sense and grit and dominion; the French- 
man, a clear vision and an undying enthusiasm; the German, an 
endless learning, and that steady capacity for labor that knows 
“nor haste, nor rest,” and to which we have brought invention, 
enterprise, and wit, and to which, if the gods of our destiny per- 
mit, we owe a still higher gift, —the gift of the ideal citizen. 
But we cannot teach children to be good patriots or citizens by 
telling them over and over to be such; but we must show them 
a country great and fair, with a thousand picturesque associations

with the past, sacred to liberty and happiness, the home of heroes; 
love for such a country will take care of itself. Such a love is not 
to be aroused in young minds by the bare study of abstractions 
such as constitutional history demands; the Indian, the soldier, the 
fur-trapper, the sailor, are the guides who must take him in hand 
at first, and attach his interest and his love to the mountains, 
plains, and lakes of his native land. Here lies the great use of the 
study of wars, which shows us a people under the stress and strain 
of great and painful circumstance, acting together, enduring and 
daring for a common good. Wars thus become watchwords of 
heroism, banners of memory, bonds of blood-kinship to a people. 
In the study of the heroic deeds of peace and war we lay a con- 
crete basis for patriotism, without saying a word about it. We 
love what is great and fair in spite of ourselves. Do not tell us, 
then, to love, but show us what is great and fair. 
SPECIAL STUDY ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 
“Truth is the daughter of time.” — MIRABEAU fo Bishop of Chartres. 
Ir is popularly supposed that the philosophy of history, be- 
decked in eighteenth-century dignity of robe and wig, has left the 
stage altogether, never to return; and that in his place has come 
a very painstaking young fellow, whose chief business in life is to 
dig, and who quite despises those who stop to look around them. 
I am well aware that respectable historical students are apt to 
shrug their shoulders and smile when a callow freshman comes 
to urge, “But what I want is a course in the philosophy of his- 
tory;” and I am as well aware that this callow freshman will not 
easily find his wished-for course, and that he must bear his growing- 
pains as best he may. Yet having a certain respect for youth, I 
am going to ask this callow freshman to look over the philosophies 
of history which have been presented in the past, note their num- 
ber and variety, examine their content, and see whether, in the face 
of the varying medley, he can see any fixed features which speak 
of life and truth.

Perhaps the earliest tangible philosophy of history which we can 
find is that of the Jews, thus expressed by Josephus : — 
“Upon the whole, a man that will peruse this history may principally 
learn from it, that all events succeeded well . . . and the reward of felicity is 
proposed by God ; but then it is to those that follow his will, and do not ven- 
ture to break his excellent laws. ... God is the father and Lord of all 
things, and sees all things, and . . . hence bestows a happy life upon those 
that follow him; but plunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into 
inevitable miseries.” 1 
This is the philosophy which pervades all the historical writings 
of the Jews, and finds its poetic expression in such passages as, “I 
have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” 
A clear expression of the philosophy of history among the 
Greeks is to be found in the Politics of Aristotle, who strikes the 
key-note of his theme in the first sentence of his first book : — 
“ Every state is a community of some kind, and every community is estab- 
lished with a view to some good; for mankind always act in order to obtain 
that which they think good. But if all communities aim at some good, the 
state or political community which is the highest of all, and which embraces 
all the rest, aims, and in a higher degree than any other, at the highest 
good,” 2 
He then examines the various forms and the various theories of 
the state, historically and logically, in order to discover the best 
form and the best ideal, and thus concludes in chapter eighteen 
of his third book :— 
“We maintain that the best [government] must be that which is adminis- 
tered by the best, and in which there is one man, or a whole family, or many 
persons, excelling in virtue, and both rulers and subjects are fitted, the one to 
rule, the others to be ruled, in such a manner as to attain the most eligible 
life.” & 
Here the philosophy of history sees how a people develop their 
own state through appropriate instruments of government until

THE RELATION OF TRAVEL TO HISTORICAL STUDY 123 
they reach an harmonious balance, which enables each individual, 
through his connection with the whole, to live his own best life. 
Among the Roman historians, we find in Polybius the clearest 
expression of a philosophy of history. This first of men to conceive 
of a general history in its modern sense says, in his introduction : — 
“Can any one be so indifferent or idle as not to care to know by what 
means, and under what kind of polity, almost the whole inhabited world was 
conquered and brought under the dominion of the single city of Rome? .. . 
“My History begins in the 140th Olympiad. . . . Now, up to this time the 
world’s history had been, so to speak, a series of disconnected transactions. 
. .. But from this time forth History becomes a connected whole: the affairs 
of Italy and Libya are involved with those of Asia and Greece, and the ten- 
dency of all is tounity. . .. Just as Fortune made almost all the affairs of the 
world incline in one direction, and forced them to converge upon one and the 
same point; so it is my task as an historian to put before my readers a com- 
pendious view of the part played by Fortune in bringing about the general 
catastrophe.”’ 1 
To the mind of Polybius, the affairs of the world are forced by 
Fortune, the divine necessity of antiquity, into the single path 
marked out by Rome. 
The Christian philosophy of history starts out from the old faith 
of Josephus: “All things work together for good to them that love 
God,” modified by an afterthought of fate, expressed in the addi- 
tion, “who are the called according to his purpose.”’ But the per- 
secutions and woes of the early church drive its thinkers on to the 
pessimistic view expressed by St. Augustine in his City of God: 
« All things work together for good to them that love God,” indeed, 
but this good may not be found in Rome, the city of the world, the 
‘centre of antique life, but in the city of God, the New Jerusalem. 
This world is but a trial-place for a more enduring, real world 
beyond. Looking at this world alone, we can see neither order 
nor meaning, because they do not exist. The explanation of its 
chaos is only to be found by him who looks at eternity as well 
as time; nor must the view be confined to a single people. All

humanity is involved either as called or not called to the enduring, 
happy city of those who love God. 
This philosophy, which ignores the present world, dominated 
the Middle Age, and dominates much of Christendom to-day. But 
in the fourteenth century another form of Christian philosophy of 
history arose among the Franciscans and mystics : — 
“ According to these men and their adherents, universal history ought to be 
divided into three great periods or ages: the age of the Old Testament, or 
kingdom of the Father ; the age of the New Testament, or age of the Son ; 
and the age of the eternal Gospel, or kingdom of the Spirit. In the first, God 
manifested Himself by works of almighty power, and ruled by law and fear ; 
in the second, Christ has revealed Himself through mysteries and ordinances 
to faith ; and in the third, for which the others have been merely prepara- 
tory, the mind will see truth face to face without any veil of symbols, the 
heart will be filled with a love which excludes all selfishness and dread, and 
the will, freed from sin, will need no law over it, but be a law unto itself.” 1 
With the Renaissance and Reformation, new forms of the philos- 
ophy of history were to be expected; and we find them in Machia- 
velli, and later in Montesquieu, Vico, and Condorcet. These men 
seek their philosophy by approaching the problem on its historic 
side, while Herder and Kant seek theirs by approaching the prob- 
lem analytically and a priori. 
Men like Montesquieu ask after the influences entering into 
human history, and seek, by looking at the facts, to discover some 
law. Even by an imperfect use of the inductive method they 
seem to perceive that human affairs are determined by inherent 
causes, that spring partly from man and partly from external 
nature. In this course of thought, Montesquieu enunciated what 
Flint calls “the epoch-making principle,” that history is shaped 
not by single units or men, but by a general course of affairs, a 
trend of ideas the causes of which may be analyzed and understood 
by the human reason. Hardly any one has expressed this thought 
1 Robert Flint, Historical Philosophy in France and French Belgium and Switz- 
erland, New York, 1894, p. 103,

METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF sTuDY. 125 
more clearly than Condorcet. ‘The sole foundation of belief,” he 
says, “in the natural sciences, is the idea that the general laws, 
. which regulate the phenomena of the universe, are necessary 
and constant; and for what reason should this hold less true of the 
intellectual and moral faculties of man than of the other operations 
of nature? ... Why should it be deemed chimerical to attempt 
to picture the probable destiny of the human race in accordance 
with the results of its history?” ? 
Turning to the German line of thinkers, we find the attempt to 
define the problems of history. Herder asks, What are the factors 
of history? and answers that its factors are the desires of man 
and the limits of external nature. These two playing on each other 
produce history, — the development of humanity. Kant, and still 
more definitely Hegel, follow, asking, How can the individual free 
will be reconciled with the limitations of law in nature, one of 
these limitations being the desires of other men? They answer, 
Through the state; the {organ by which man may, as far as pos- 
sible, reconcile the jar of clashing human desires with each other 
and the external world.? 
All of these views summarize in Comte, who is regarded as the 
father of scientific sociology, and who in his scheme saw the 
‘whole human race advancing at varying rates of speed through 
three stages of life and thought. In the first, they supernaturalize 
the universe, — this is the religious stage ; in the second, they build 
great systems of metaphysics, by which they explain, through gen- 
eral abstractions, what they see about them,—this is the meta- 
physical stage, which is passing into the scientific stage in our 
nineteenth century through the attempt to discover the natural and 
necessary laws by which all phenomena are governed, and by means 
of which we can modify the world to our own ends. 
With the development of the Darwinian theory, we find our-

selves in the midst of new forms of the philosophy of history. 
In Bagehot’s Physics and Politics, in Spencer’s Principles of Soci- 
ology, in Kidd’s Social Evolution, in Ward’s Psychic Factors of 
Civilization, we find philosophies of history which seek to explain 
human history by the play of natural selection acting upon strug- 
gling societies, and which regard every factor in history from this 
point of view, —as to how it fits a society to survive or perish in 
the particular circumstances in which it finds itself. Almost con- 
temporaneous with this bionomic philosophy of history we find a 
socialistic philosophy, clearly enunciated by St. Simon, who saw in 
history the story of the successive amelioration of the proletariat.? 
This philosophy is developed by Marx in his Das Kapital, and 
clearly by Paul Wiesengriin in his Entwickelungsgesetze des Mensch- 
heit. According to this school of thinkers, the conditions of 
production have driven men on through a necessary series of his- 
torical epochs, so fixed in their course that Marx declares: “The 
country that is more developed industrially, only shows to the less 
developed the image of its own future.... And even when a 
society has got upon the right track for the discovery of the natural 
laws of its movement .. . it can neither clear by bold leaps, nor 
remove by legal enactments, the obstacles offered by the successive 
phases of its normal development. But it can shorten and lessen 
the birth-pangs.”* These birth-pangs over, the new society will 
find itself able to determine its own progress by the conscious 
employment of the natural laws discovered by all the sciences, 
historical sciences among the rest. 
These modern philosophies of history, whether bionomic or social- 
istic, find a comprehensive expression in the following passage 
from Lotze :— 
“Science has introduced into even the most familiar departments of human 
thought the idea of universal laws to which reality is obedient in all particu- 
1 Bernheim, p. 539.

-P-A-G-E-131

lars, and a lively conviction that results can only be obtained by using things 
according to these laws. . .. It gave rise to that progressive spirit of con- 
scious calculation that is not content to continue passively in any instinctive 
condition of being or doing, but must actively mould the future by independent 
use of all available means.” ! 
Lotze also believes that this human progressive spirit is acting 
and working in parallelism with the immanent and eternally moving 
spirit of the universe. 
This cursory view of the philosophies which have dominated our 
views of history reveals a number of general laws: — 
Each philosophy of history has grown out of the peculiar point of 
view and circumstances of the people enunciating it. Thus, Josephus 
interprets history as the theocratic Jew; Aristotle, as a Greek who 
has seen the bloom of Athens; Polybius, as a Greek who has seen 
the bloom of Athens fade before the fateful power of Rome; St. 
Augustine, living in the age of the decadence of Rome, and the 
weakness of the church, interprets events in the light of another 
and more enduring world; the mystics of the thirteenth century, 
who saw Europe emerging into a quickening life, happier and 
freer than any the world had seen before, seize upon a new view 
of history, and see in the kingdom of the Holy Spirit a promise 
for the earth itself of a New Jerusalem. After men broke with 
authority in the age of the Reformation, and learned to use their 
own eyes and their own minds on very things, they applied the 
method to history as well, and began to perceive in it some natural 
laws. This scientific point of view, as we call it, has dominated 
the leading thinkers in this field until our own day; and yet these 
modern men have seen these laws differently, according to their 
own points of view. Thus, the sceptics of the eighteenth century 
looked to natural laws alone, and were inclined to ignore the inter- 
ference of incalculable human choice; the biologists seize upon the 
struggle for existence as the only key to the situation; the social- 
ists see in history only the play ofthe laws of production, leading 
1 Microcosmos, Book VII., ch. v.
-P-A-G-E-132
  128 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
to the inevitable goal of the dominion of the proletariat. One of 
the most clear and interesting instances of variation due to point 
of view is to be seen in German history. At the close of the 
last century, Kant and Goethe saw with some clearness, as they 
thought, that universal history tended toward a cosmopolitan 
mass of civilization, and that Germany’s history had especially 
fitted her to lead toward this mass, since she had not been shaped 
like France and England into a particularistic nation. But since 
the events of the nineteenth century have made Germany also into 
a great nation, Von Sybel and her other historians see that nation- 
ality, not cosmopolitanism, was the hidden aim of the ages, and 
that modern civilization is not to be a cosmopolitan mass, but 
rather a symposium of highly developed nations, each bringing its 
own gifts of nature and art.t 
A second law which presents itself is, that there is an advancing 
content contained in the philosophy of history. This advancing 
content develops from the particular states seen by Josephus and 
Aristotle, through the Roman empire seen by Polybius, the whole 
of Christendom seen by St. Augustine, and the civilized world 
seen by Montesquieu, to the whole of mankind in the views of 
Spencer, Marx, and Lotze. This content not only broadens as to 
its personal element, but also in the directions of environment 
and action; so that it includes now not only the religious and 
military life seen in Josephus, but the whole circle of human 
thought and action, — political, intellectual, spiritual, — and the 
whole mass of human environment, — physical and social, — with- 
out dropping from view anything ever seen before. 
But while there is this advancing content of history, there is also 
a fixed content of basic ideas. One of these ideas is wnity. To 
Josephus, all that he knows of the world relates itself to the Jews. 
The unity of Aristotle is the philosophic state; that of Polybius, 
1 The Nation, New York, Dec. 3, 1891, in review of Jastrow’s Geschichte des 
deutschen Einheitstraumes und seiner Erfiillung, Berlin, 1891, in which book the 
national view of the philosophy of history is strongly developed.
-P-A-G-E-133
METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF STUDY. 129 
Rome, which will draw the world to itself by irresistible fate. To 
St. Augustine, all relates itself to the church; to us, humanity 
is the unit. 
A second idea which appears in all these varying forms is that 
of some directive force. To Josephus this directive force was 
Jehovah; to Aristotle, the philosopher; to Polybius, fate; to St. 
Augustine, God, but a greater, more inscrutable, more slowly movy- 
ing deity than that of Josephus; to the mystics, the Holy Spirit, 
moving to its ends through the agencies of inspired men scattered 
everywhere. To the moderns, this directive force has appeared, 
first, as unconscious external law of nature, as with Buckle; second, 
as human society becoming self-conscious and self-directive through 
the control of the laws of which it has become conscious, as in 
Ward ; and, third, as an immanent spirit. 
A third idea which underlies our various philosophies is that 
of progress toward ends of goodness and happiness by means of 
conscious human action. According to Josephus, this progress 
follows obedience to Jehovah; according to Aristotle, by living in 
harmony with the teachings of philosophy ; according to Polybius, 
through obedience to the laws of Rome; St. Augustine seeks it 
for the individual through loyalty to the church; the mystics, 
through the guide of inspiration; while the moderns believe it can 
be obtained through the conscious control of sociologic and natural 
law by the will and intelligence of man, or, as others put it, by 
living in harmony with the immanent Spirit of the universe, in 
whom we move and live and have our being. 
If this is the character of the philosophy of history, what shall 
we say of it? Is it something to be reckoned with in the field 
of thought, or is it not? Since we perceive in it fundamental ideas 
which are constant, it would seem to have a fixed body; since its 
content has advanced with time, and was never so great nor so 
unified as now, it would seem to have life. But what of that 
variability which we have seen, that tendency to adapt itself to 
various circumstances and points of view? ‘This variability, far
-P-A-G-E-134
STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
  from condemning the philosophy of history, should recommend it; 
since it shows again that this philosophy is alive, and organically 
connected with advancing life. 
On all these counts, then, it would appear that there is a phi- 
losophy of history ; that it is the most important thing in history, 
the most permanent and most interesting, and that the time is 
always present for formulating it anew. For this philosophy of 
history, owing to its plasticity and progress, is no absolute thing 
to be discovered once for all, but has varied in the past to suit 
the needs of every individual, age, and country; and so will it 
vary in the future. This variability is what has given it a bad 
name. Because it was plastic, people have suspected that it did not 
exist; but one might as well say that life does not exist because it 
ranges through endless variations of form and age and power. 
Precisely in this plasticity, this quality of clinging to and suiting 
the advancing thought and knowledge and circumstance of man, 
lies the life of the philosophy of history, as there lies the life of 
any philosophy at all. Facts to us are dead until they relate them- 
selves to us and to our world. This relation of facts to life 
and the world is what every soul and every generation demands 
as light upon its pathway. This relation varies because of our 
advancing points of view: it grows with knowledge; and if at 
present we are agnostic and pessimistic, it is simply because masses 
of facts have poured in upon us for half a century with such rapid- 
ity and force that we have had no time to relate them, hardly time 
to see them. But are we, then, to say that that universe which we 
have seen proceeding by the most exact and rigid law from the 
simple to the complex is, in the field of human history, aban- 
doned to caprice and lawlessness? If not, we may reasonably 
look for a philosophy; nor should we be impatient if the most 
complex of sciences has to wait on simpler sciences for its ad- 
vancing development. 
As we look again at this succession of philosophies, we are struck 
with the fact that in each of our instances we get the expression of
-P-A-G-E-135
  METHOD AS DETERMINED BY THE AIM OF sTUDY. 131 
a philosophy which has dominated history itself in the contem 
porary period. The most striking instance is perhaps to be found 
in the philosophy of St. Augustine, who regarding this earth but 
as a place of broken fragments, a battleground whose results can 
only be seen in the hereafter, naturally felt that it was foolish to 
pay much attention to mundane events; so history fell into des- 
uetude, and historical action itself was more or less paralyzed by a 
view which placed all interest outside of the world itself. In con- 
trast to this, we note the flood of living interest that has poured 
into history since it has been believed that we could discover its 
laws; an interest still further heightened in the case of those who 
believe not only that we may come to know the laws of social life, 
but that we may control them for the good of society, just.as we 
have learned consciously to bend the laws of electricity to our own 
desires. Many of us, again, add to this the belief that by so shap- 
ing natural law we are co-workers with a spirit immanent through 
all the living universe. However we believe, if we hold any 
modern view save that of the pessimist, the hope of paradise 
springs up again in our human hearts, and we find ourselves build- 
ing anew on the old foundations a philosophy of history, but 
building higher and more gloriously than ever before; our unit, the 
world of living men through all time; our directive force welded 
from natural law, conscious human action, and possibly a conscious 
divine influence; our aim,'the progressive strength and excellence 
of human life. Such is our latest achievement in the philosophy 
of history; but we know well that it will not be our last, unless, 
indeed, it should prove exactly in conformity with reality; for 
“Truth is the daughter of Time.”

PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PRINOIPLES OF METHOD TO 
HISTORY IN THE HIGH SOHOOL.' 
Tue teacher of history in the high school has ever before his 
eyes the two horns of his dilemma: on the one hand, history in 
the high school must still partake of the nature of general infor- 
mation; on the other, the method of presenting it should be concrete 
enough to develop a certain amount of historic sense. The every- 
day world demands that he shall give his student some clear notion 
of what Greek, Roman, Jew, Kelt, and Teuton each have done to 
change the howling wilderness of prehistoric Europe into the civil- 
ized centre of the world; demands, beyond that, a good clear view 
of the history and meaning of our own America. Then comes the 
Republic, with her demand for a thoughtful citizen who can read 
the history of to-day, and shape the policy of the morrow, from the 
tough-hewn logic of fact, the endless prattle of the press, the stir- 
ring words of living men, the creaking, heavy machinery of govern- 
ment. Neither demand can he gainsay; how can he meet both? 
One demands generalities which are the commonplaces of every 
scholar; the other, fresh and independent study of historic detail 
from historic sources. 
It would seem at first as if there were no compromise; as if the 
generalities must be learned by heart, and the detail on which they 
rest taken for granted, or as if the method of research must lead 
endlessly on, until the student is assured of his ignorance of the 
1 Reprinted from the Academy, Syracuse, N.Y. June, 1889. 
132

  PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF METHOD. 133 
campaigns of Charlemagne and the landfall of Columbus. The 
former method leaves him dogmatic and conceited; the latter, 
sceptical and discouraged. The former leaves him with no proper 
conception of the living reality of the historic world, of the labor 
which its discoveries involve, or the foundation on which they rest; 
the latter leaves him too often without one single commanding view 
of that divine unit of historic progress which draws to itself ever- 
widening areas of land and folk. 
Hard as the problem is, I have come to think that there is a_ 
solution for it; that the solution lies perhaps here, — in teaching 
the general truth through the special fact, and in making each indi- 
vidual pupil judge the special fact for himself in its general aspects. 
I will illustrate my meaning by two or three examples. Suppose 
the topic in hand to be the Spanish discoveries in America: first of 
all, what are the general facts we wish to impart in regard to these 
events? We will say,—the lands and seas opened by Spanish 
exploration, the time over which it extended, the motives and char- 
acters of the explorers, their relations to the natives. Now, there 
are two ways in which one can teach these points; one is, to have 
the pupil read or recite, either verbatim, or, preferably, in his own 
language, the contents of some such paragraph as this :— 
“The Spanish discoveries began with Columbus, and during the next one 
hundred and fifty years had covered the length of the American coast from 
Newfoundland to Patagonia on the east, and from Chili to Upper California 
on the west. The discoverers were either Italian or Portuguese sailors, trained 
from boyhood to the boldest navigation of their time,—or Spanish cavaliers, 
trained in court and camp, men of dauntless courage, of boundless energy and 
determined will, but cruel and perfidious in their relations with the natives; 
ever drawn on from region to region by the love of gold, and the wish to gain 
new realms for the king and the church. Their settlements were precarious 
and their lives adventurous.” 
This is the one way, — to give the generalities just as they stand, 
the accepted commonplaces of history, and wait for time and chance 
to make their meaning clear. The other way is to give into the 
hands of the student a collection of concrete materials in which he 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  134 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
himself may read these general facts. A desirable collection would 
be as follows: First, the pictures of a cavalier and a friar. These 
are simply to give objective reality to the men with whom he is 
to deal, and may be dismissed with this remark. Second, a bare 
chronological list of discoveries, each item reading something as 
follows: 1492, Columbus, a Genoese captain, sailing in service of 
the King of Spain, to find a western way to India, discovers some 
of the West Indian Islands. From such a list the student can see 
for himself of what occupation and rank the discoverers were, in 
whose behalf the discoveries were made, what area they covered, 
and the time they took. Third, extracts from the letters and nar- 
tatives of the time. Let him read from the narrative of Zhe Gentle- 
man of Elvas, one of the companions of De Soto, how on reaching 
Florida, De Soto at once began to ask the Indians “if they knew 
. any rich country where there was gold or silver;” how they 
told him that “towards the west there was a province —called 
Cale— where the most part of the year was summer, and that 
there was much gold .. . that . . . these inhabitants of Cale did 
wear hats of gold;” how then De Soto, with all his men, “took the 
way to Cale,” but when he came thither, “found the town without 
people, and his own men were sore vexed with hunger and evil 
ways, because the country was very barren of maize, low, and full 
of water, bogs, and thick woods; and the victuals they had brought 
with them ... were spent.” Again, let him read this from Las 
Casas : — 
“The main care was to send the men to work in the gold mines and to 
send the women to till the ground; the men perished in the gold mines with 
hunger and labor, the women perished in the fields; and as for the blows 
which they gave them with whips, cudgels, and their fists—I can hardly be 
able to make a narration of those things.” 
From such extracts as these one makes the nearest possible ap- 
proach to speech with the time itself, comes to understand how the 
actors themselves thought and felt and did; in other words, one

gains historic sympathy, that prime requisite to historic under- 
standing. 
This, then, is the first step, —to give the student a little collection 
of historic data, and extracts from contemporary sources, together 
with a few questions within his power to answer from these materials. 
Then let him go by himself, like Agassiz’s famous student with the 
fish, to see what he can see. The work of the class-room is to col- 
lect, criticise, and summarize the individual results into those same 
general statements which, after all, must finally remain in the 
mind, but which must depend for their living reality on. the spe- 
cial fact. 
For instance, again, if I wanted to teach the great differences be- 
tween the military system of medieval Europe and modern times, 
I would give my pupil two photographs, — one of a thirteenth cen- 
tury castle, islanded by a moat, beset by high, blind walls, watching 
the world cautiously from narrow loopholes or from lofty towers ; 
and one of a modern English country-house, inviting approach 
through sunny vistas and flower-set lawns, while its walls smile 
welcome from many a generous window and door, —and I would 
ask, “How does it happen that the thirteenth century man built 
such a house as this, while we build houses like these?” And, 
after some reflection, the pupil would see that the castle must have 
been built by a man who feared enemies from whom he must defend 
himself in his own house, while the country-house was built by a 
man who lived in peace, and was taken care of. That is the point; 
and the photographs teach it better than words, and are longer 
remembered. 
One illustration more, of still a different kind. Supposing it is 
the character of a civilization that you wish to impress, —what are 
your realities here? The lives, the deeds, the works, of men. Let 
us take, for example, the century after the so-called fall of Rome; 
how can you manage to impress the character of this obscure, diffi- 
cult, but important period upon the minds of your pupils? Here, 
again, the list can be used to advantage. The bare alphabetic list  
-P-A-G-E-140
136 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
of the famous names of those obscure centuries, with a brief note 
of birth and circumstance, work done, and language used, will tell 
a distinct story. Such a list is, in fact, a collection of short biog- 
raphies, and will read something like this : —

library of manu- scripts. 
Clovis. War-chief andking of agreat | Conqueror of Visigoth | Barbarous band of Franks. and Burgundian. Latin. 
  
  
So the list goes on through monks and warriors to the end. With 
the list before him the student goes to work, and finds two conspic- 
uous facts,—one, the spread of Christianity without the empire; 
the other, the spread of barbarian power within. He sees that the 
great men of the age are warrior-barbarians or civilizing monks; 
that with the latter go the Latin language, the beginnings of art, 
literature, and law; that over all Europe they are fixing little cen- 
tres of civilization. He sees that it is a shifting, settling age; that 
its heroes are the conquering war-chief and the ascetic monk. So 
much for what the list can teach. Add now, on the one hand, that 
rough old song of Lodbrok, each stanza ending with the barbarous 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
nen wee 
PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF METHOD. 137 
war-cry, “We hewed with our swords.” In that short but telling 
original the barbarian speaks for himself, the brave but untamed 
Teuton. Add for the other aspect of the time, the words of St. 
Jerome : — 
“T sat alone ; I was filled with bitterness ; my limbs were uncomely and 
rough with sackcloth, and my squalid skin became as rough as an Ethiopian’s. 
Every day I was in tears and groans ; and if ever the sleep which hung upon 
my eyelids overcame my resistance, I knocked against the ground my bare 
bones, which scarce clung together. I say nothing of my meat and drink; 
since the monks even when sick use cold water, and it is thought a luxury if 
they ever partake of cooked food. Through fear of hell, I had condemned 
myself to prison ; I had scorpions and wild beasts for my only companions. 
My face was white with fasting, my body was cold; the man, within 
his own flesh, was dead before his time.’ 
In this brief extract your pupil may discover and touch, as it 
were, the very soul of the ascetic, —his manner of life, his fears, 
his hopes. 
The advantages of such a method are, that it brings the mind 
of the pupil into contact with life-giving reality, and trains him 
to think; to see in the form the home of the advancing spirit; to 
see in the word and act the force and quality of character. Leoni- 
das dying at Thermopyle, the brave, obedient, laconic warrior, 
is the embodiment of Sparta. When Socrates says, “The proper 
jewels of the soul are temperance and justice, courage, nobility, 
and truth,” you see the blossom of a long growth of philosophic 
thought. When you hear the Romans of the empire address their 
emperor as “lord and master,” “your eternity,” and “your magnifi- 
cence,” while that emperor is at the same time the public example 
of every weakness and vice, how much farther must you go to learn 
that here you have a despot and his slaves? Look at the me- 
dizval cathedral, towering high above all else, the work of cen- 
turies, adorned with every art: there you have in visible form the 
power and wealth of the church of the fourteenth century ; but you 
must hear Wiclif too, and the witty author of Reynard the Fox,
-P-A-G-E-142
  138 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
and then you shall know that within the bosom of that rich, «s- 
thetic, cathedral-building power, beats a discontented, restless heart 
that threatens deeds anon. 
What should be insisted on is that our pupils do, as far as pos- 
sible, hear and see the very products of the time and people; that 
they form their own opinions at this fountain-head of reality before 
they hear or know the opinions of another: but when they have 
once done it, the wide world of men and books and action will open 
to them as never before. 
But how can we get such original materials into the hands of our 
pupils? That is the main question. In Germany and France they 
have answered it pretty completely by popularly compiled collec- 
tions of original documents and narratives; even in our own coun- 
try such reprints are beginning to make their appearance. Still, 
the teacher must largely depend on his own exertions, and the local 
library. But if the teacher keeps his eyes open, he will find, now 
a picture, now an extract, pamphlet, or booklet; and, before he 
knows it, will have quite a serviceable little collection. Even 
Plutarch and the Declaration of Independence are better than noth- 
ing; and it is a good starting-point to know what you would do if 
you could. 
But it takes more time ? Good friend, it does; and it takes more 
time to solve a problem in arithmetic than to read its answer; and 
more time to read a play of Shakespeare than to read that Shake- 
speare was the greatest dramatist of all the ages; and more time 
to read the American Constitution and the American newspaper, 
and make up your mind how to vote your own vote, than it does 
to be put into a “block of five.” But what is time for?

DESORIPTIVE AND SELECT BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORKS ON 
METHOD. 
Tus Bibliography contains only English titles of which I can 
speak from personal knowledge; all the more important modern 
titles are included. I have omitted those of purely historical inter- 
est, whose ideas have been outgrown or embodied in recent works. 
Those who wish to read more deeply on this subject will find the 
best assistance in English from the books and references of Hall 
and Hinsdale. If he can read German, he will find his best guide 
to be Dr. Ernst Bernheim’s Lehrbuch der historischen Methode, 
published in a second edition at Leipsic in 1894, and containing in 
its footnotes and bibliographies a full guide to the Continental 
authorities. It can be imported directly from the publishers, 
Duncker und Humblot of Leipsic for about $3.00, or through Wes- 
termann of New York City. 
Adams, Charles Kendall. Recent Historical Work in Colleges and Universi- 
ties of Europe and America. In papers of the American Historical 
Association, January, 1890. 
The title is sufficiently descriptive of this paper, which is detailed enough 
to be of great practical value in higher instruction. President Adams, who 
began his career as Professor of History at Michigan University, was called to 
Cornell as its president in 1885, and is now at the head of the State University 
of Wisconsin. His work as a scholar has been entirely in the field of history, 
and he will be remembered as the first to introduce the German Seminarium 
into the historical work of the American college. Valuable essays of Presi- 
dent Adams on method will be found in the Introduction to his Manual of 
Historical Literature, and in Hall’s collection noticed below.

  140 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
Adams, Herbert B. Methods of Historical Study. In Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity Studies. Baltimore, January and February, 1884. 
This is an extensive description of actual methods employed in seminary 
work in colleges and universities abroad and in the United States. The 
essay noted below in Hall’s Methods is but a condensation of this. <A still 
more extensive and exhaustive study of this same subject, by the same author, 
appears in the Circular of Information No. 2 of the Bureau of Education, 
Washington, 1887, under the title, ‘‘The Study of History in American Col- 
Jeges and Universities.” Herbert B. Adams has been for many years at the 
head of the department of history in Johns Hopkins University, and has had 
the training of many of the stronger young men in the field. He has given a 
great impulse to studies in local American history, has greatly developed the 
seminary method, and may be regarded as the founder of the American His- 
torical Association. 
Andrews, EH. Benjamin. Institutes of General History. Boston, 1887. 
In the first chapter of this book will be found a philosophical discussion of 
the subject of history and its study, and a useful bibliography of the best 
German works on these aspects of the subject. President Andrews, now of 
Brown University, was formerly Professor of Economics at Cornell, and has 
made history aid economics special studies for many years. 
Droysen, Johann Gustav. Principles of History. Grundriss der Historik. 
Translated by E. Benjamin Andrews. Boston, Ginn, 1893. 
This is a most valuable exposition of the deepest philosophical considera- 
tions as to the content, the relation, and the method of history. It is the 
work of the elder Droysen, who died in 1884, and whose long life was devoted 
to the study of history. He was successively professor at Jena, Kiel, and 
Berlin ; at the latter university he spent a quarter of a century. 
Foster, F. H. The Seminary Method of Original Study in the Historical 
Sciences, Illustrated from Church History. New York, 1888. 
This book will not disappoint those who wish clear and detailed directions 
for advanced and original study. For this purpose there is no better guide.

the Pacific Theological Seminary in Oakland, Cal.

Fredericq, Paul. The Study of History in Germany and France, translated 
from the French by Henrietta Leonard. In Johns Hopkins University 
Studies, vol. viii. Baltimore, May and June, 1890. 
Fredericq is professor in the University of Ghent, and these essays were 
written from personal observation of the most advanced methods. This 
paper is of great value as an exposition of actual practice in the highest insti- 
tutions of learning. Law schools are not dealt with. In the same volume is 
an essay on ‘‘ The Study of History in Holland and Belgium,” and in vol. v. 
of this same series an essay on ‘‘ The Study of History in England and Scot- 
land,” both by the same author. But their importance is slight compared 
with that of the first title. 
Freeman, Edward A. Methods of Historical Study. Eight lectures read 
before the University of Oxford, 1884. London, 1886. 
This book should be thoroughly read by the teacher of history, partly be- 
cause its large views illuminate and organize the subject, partly because Free- 
man, as perhaps the greatest of recent historians, has dominated historical 
thought and method for many years. These lectures were delivered while 
Freeman was Regius Professor of History at Oxford, and were the ripest re- 
sult of his thought and work. All his essays have the qualities of breadth, 
lucidity, and strength, and should be read whenever they apply to the work 
in hand. 
Froude, James Anthony. Short Studies on Great Subjects. New York, 
1868. 
The first of these studies, on ‘‘ The Science of History,” is a plea for the dra- 
matic, biographic presentation of history, and is full of suggestion and inspira- 
tion. Froude succeeded Freeman at Oxford as Regius Professor of History, 
a position held by Gardiner since Froude’s death. 
Hall, G. Stanley. Methods of Teaching and Studying History. Boston, 
Heath. $1.50. 
The first edition of this work contained a translation of Diesterweg’s “‘ Weg- 
weiser,” which is regarded as a classic on the subject of method in history in 
Germany. The essay is of a decidedly philosophical character, and not so 
practical in its assistance to teachers as the books of Hinsdale and Foster, 
or as the other essays of this same volume, which are by H. B. Adams, C. K. 
Adams, John W. Burgess of Columbia, E. Emerton of Harvard, Thomas 
Wentworth Higginson, and W. F. Allen, formerly of Wisconsin University. 
This edition is now out of print; but a second edition has been published, 
without the Diesterweg, which is a most valuable collection of contributions 
from American scholars and teachers, and a third is now under way.

142 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
Harrison, Frederic. The Meaning of History, and Other Historical Pieces. 
London and New York, Macmillan & Co., 1894. 
These essays will prove rather suggestive and inspiring than directly help- 
ful in matters of detail. Those who cannot see them will find their gist em- 
bodied in an article in the Fortnightly for October, 1893, entitled, ‘‘ The Royal 
Road to History,” by the same author. This essay is reprinted in Mr. Har- 
rison’s book, and embodies, in a delightful conversation between an Oxford 
freshman and an Oxford don, the most evident criticisms on the respective 
views and methods of Freeman and Froude. Harrison’s own view is ex- 
pressed by a London L. C. Oxonian, who maintains that history can only 
be known in the large by its noteworthy types. 
Hinsdale, B. A. How to Study and Teach History. With particular refer- 
ence to the history of the United States. New York, Appleton, 1894. 
International Education Series. $1.50. 
States uses of history, defines the field, gives criteria for choice of facts, 
shows how to organize them, indicates sources of information, describes quali- 
fications of teacher, illustrated from American history. Mr. Hinsdale is 
Professor of the Art and Science of Teaching at the University of Michigan, 
and approaches his subject, therefore, much more from the pedagogic side 
than any of our other authors, except G. Stanley Hall ; although he has also 
made an historical contribution of some importance in the book entitled The 
Old Northwest, and as editor of Garfield’s Works. This’ work on method, 
as the title-page indicates, is of especial use to the teacher of American his- 
tory, for which it gives a good deal of general guidance as to organization of 
material, and many references to authorities. 
Howard, George E. The Place of History in Modern Education. In 
Trans. of the Nebraska State Historical Society, i. 202. 
Dr. Howard, now Professor of History in the Leland Stanford Junior Uni- 
versity, was formerly in charge of the history work in the University of 
Nebraska, where he gave a great impulse to the study of local Western his- 
tory. His essay strongly defines the comparative element in scientific history, 
and the nature of an institution as an historical object.

Women and Higher Education. Edited by Anna C. Brackett. New

dent Adams’s seminary students, and is well known among American scholars 
by her excellent monographic work. She formerly taught history in the Terre 
Haute Normal School, and is at present Professor of History at Vassar College. 
She is, therefore, well fitted to speak upon the subject of her essays, which, 
although short, are among the best contributions to our subject. 
Seeley, Sir J. R. History and Politics. London and New York, Macmillan. 
Reprinted in Littell, xxvii. 707. 
Professor J. R. Seeley, who became famous by his Ecce Homo, and who 
spent the latter half of his life as Regius Professor of Modern History at the 
University of Cambridge, tries in this essay to define carefully the difference 
between literary and scientific history. 
Stubbs, William. The Study of Medisval and Modern History. Seventeen 
lectures delivered in the University of Oxford. The following lectures 
may be particularized: I. Inaugural; Il.-III. On the Present State 
and Prospects of Historical Study ; IV. On the Purposes and Methods 
of Historical Study; V. Methods of Historical Study; VI.-VII. On 
the Characteristic Differences between Medieval and Modern History. 
Bishop Stubbs delivered these lectures after he became Regius Professor of 
Modern History at the University of Oxford, and they deal rather with the 
higher method, therefore rather with the problems that present themselves to 
the university professor ; especially suggestive, however, in his discussion of 
the relative value of the various periods of history to the student as citizen. 
White, Andrew D. European Schools of History and Politics. In Johns 
Hopkins University Studies. Baltimore, 1887. 
A very detailed statement of what is done in Europe to prepare young men 
definitely for political careers, and a plea for the establishment of similar 
courses and schools in our own country. See by the same author: “On Stud- 
ies in General History and the History of Civilization.” New York, 1885. 
(Papers of the American Historical Association.) Mr. White’s experience 
as historical professor at Michigan University, as president of Cornell for 
twenty-five years, as our minister to Germany and later to Russia, and as his- 
torical student and writer during his whole active life, gives the highest value 
to his utterances on the subject of history in its practical relations. He stands, 
besides, as the leader of those who in America have turned attention rather 
to the lines of intellectual history. He also looks at history very decidedly 
from the point of view of the man of affairs, who seeks in history an argu- 
ment, an example, or a warning.

  144 STUDIES IN HISTORICAL METHOD. 
For the bibliography of this subject in periodical literature, see 
Poole’s Index, under the headings, History, Teaching of, Method in, 
etc. In files of the Academy and of the Educational Review will 
be found especially good papers; the Johns Hopkins University 
Studies, and the Papers of the American Historical Association, 
will be most useful in keeping the teacher abreast of the most ad- 
vanced work of the country. The American Historical Review, just 
begun in October of 1895, published by Macmillan, and edited by a 
board chosen from the historical faculties of Brown, Yale, Harvard, 
and other leading colleges, promises much. 
I much regret that I cannot refer to some work of Ranke’s on 
the subject of method, for Ranke is the master of us all in this last 
half of the nineteenth century; but from the Appendix to his His- 
tory of England in the Seventeenth Century, I quote the following 
passage, which gives the key-note to his philosophy, aim, and method. 
“Tn our days historical studies have been directed as never before to the 
original monuments of the past inevery century. The deciphering of Assyrian 
and Egyptian monuments, the collecting of Greek and Roman inscriptions, 
the publishing of the records and literature of the Middle Ages, the ransacking 
of modern archives, — however different may be the objects, the means of 
study, and even the intellectual capacities employed, — have all the same end; 
viz., to get free from the trammels of established tradition, to gain a mastery 
over the immediate circumstances and issues of life, to see the past as a pres- 
ent, as it were with our own eyes... . 
“All hangs together, —critical study of genuine sources, impartial view, 
objective description. The end to be aimed at is the representation of the 
whole truth.” 
For Ranke’s life and work the following articles are the most 
useful in English: —

sketch with bibliographical notes.) Papers of American Historical As- 
sociation, iii, New York and London, 1889.

ruary, 1887; also an article on Ranke’s pupil, Wilhelm von Giesebrecht,

  PREFACE 
In America, raising farm animals does not receive the recogni 
tion that is accorded it in Europe. Because of this relative neg- 
lect, when in search of animals with which to improve our studs, 
herds and flocks, we still look largely to foreign lands. Conti- 
nental Europe provides us with blood to improve our draft horses, 
dairy cattle, and fine-wool sheep, while the British Isles furnish 
improved blood for our beef cattle, mutton sheep, bacon swine, as 
well as for horses, both light and heavy, and for dairy cattle. 
A comparison of European methods with those employed in 
America reveals the fact that our methods are lacking and en- 
tirely inadequate to produce the greatest improvement. The 
live-stock farmers of Europe exercise much careful judgment in _ 
choosing their animals, in feeding, in breeding, and in the care 
and management. It has been with a view of aiding to promote 
such interest in the daily work with farm animals that this 
volume is written. This has been done with the thought that 
increased interest will lead to improved care, which in time, it 
is hoped, will produce a better and more useful class of farm 
livestock. It is well recognized that a good animal husbandry 
lies at the bottom of a good agriculture. 
From the above, it will be seen that the author’s purpose is 
to discuss the general care and management of farm animals 
rather than the breeds. However, a knowledge of the breeds is 
necessary. To economize space and the reader’s time, the writer 
has adopted the method of freely inserting pictures of good: 
animals of many breeds, with liberal legends, letting them run 
as a minor motive throughout the book. By this plan it is hoped 
that some of the main characteristics of the breeds may be taken 
away by the reader with little effort on his part.

  vi PREFACE 
In a book of this range, many kinds of advice must be given. 
This advice may not all be of equal value, even though it be the 
product of actual experience. The author gives it for what it is 
worth, and it is the responsibility of the reader to apply it and 
to work it out as best he can. In the discussion of diseases, par- 
ticularly, it is very difficult to give formal advice that will apply 
to all cases; and the statements are meant to be used as guides 
and suggestions and not as “doctor book” prescriptions or as 
substitutes for the help of a trained veterinarian. It is hoped 
that by calling attention to the diseases and ailments, the reader 
will see the importance of securing reliable aid when the subject 
is beyond his knowledge or skill. 
The book is a manual, and therefore it considers the common 
practical matters in much detail. No doubt much information 
which we now accept in the breeding and feeding of animals is 
very imperfect; but the writer has tried to discuss the daily 
handling of farm live-stock in the light of such knowledge as 
is at present best accepted and most capable of application. 
Recognizing the importance of such a work, the writer will be 
glad to correspond with those into whose hands the book may 
fall, concerning difficulties in the management of animals, and 
also to receive suggestions that will make future editions of the 
Manual— if such should be called for— more useful as a practical 
guide in raising farm animals.

MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
CHAPTER I 
CHOOSING A HORSE— JUDGING 
In choosing any class of animals, there are three faculties 
that should be well developed — familiarity with what is 
wanted, powers of observation, and good judgment. 
One must first consider the use for which the animal is 
desired and the type or breed that will best accomplish the 
given purpose. If the animal is wanted for light trucking 
and to deliver produce at the market, it might be a mistake 
to choose a heavy draft horse; whereas if the object is to 
deliver heavy freight from the car to the freight-house, it would 
be none the less a mistake to choose a running horse. Again, 
if the animal is demanded for a farm where there is consider- 
able heavy work, such as breaking the land, especially if the 
soil is heavy, the type of horse should be unlike that for a 
dairy farm, where the team work is ordinarily light. The 
more familiar one is with the demand and the type best suited 
to meet it, the better his chance of success. 
The power of observation should be well developed. The 
eye must see quickly and accurately, so that there may be no 
mistake in the observations that are to form the basis for a 
conclusion. Not only should one see things as they are, but 
there should be dispatch in detecting deviations from the cor- 
rect form. There is much difficulty in this. One may be fa- 
3
-P-A-G-E-32
  
  4 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
miliar with the fact that a few white hairs on the knee may 
indicate that the animal stumbles, and yet when examin- 
ing the horse entirely overlook them; in like manner, he may 
know that gray hairs on the inside of the pastern may indicate 
that the animal interferes, and yet the white hairs go wholly 
unnoticed. The difficulty is often increased by the salesman 
attempting to cover up such signs, and this should serve to put 
the prospective purchaser on his guard. 
Having noted the desirable and undesirable qualities of the 
animals under consideration, a mental picture of each should 
be retained, for it often happens that in the choice of a horse 
many. animals are examined before one is found that is accept- 
able. Many live-stock judges, particularly poultry fanciers, 
have this faculty developed to a marked degree. It often 
happens that they are called on to judge large rings of ani- 
mals, fifty or more in a single class, and to be able to place 
these animals properly they must remember each of the ani- 
mals, as it is impossible to see them all at a glance. Again, 
retaining such a picture of horses is of value in matching 
teams. A well-matched team is far more valuable than if 
each animal is sold separately. There are those who make a 
business of buying animals singly, matching them, and selling 
the team thus matched. This is a very profitable business, 
a few transactions each year often netting a good sum. 
After having examined a number of horses, good, bad, and 
indifferent, some of them filling the demand in part only, and 
some not at all, the judgment is brought into play to decide 
on the price. Perhaps one animal answers every demand, but 
the price is high; another does not please so well, but the price 
is low. Again, when judging a ring of animals, one must use 
the judgment as to which of two defects is the more serious. 
The judgment can and should be trained in much the same 
way as the power of observation and the ability to retain mental. 
pictures.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
CHOOSING A HORSE & 
In choosing a horse, efficiency depends much on practice 
and experience. The type to fill a certain demand, and the 
value of the animal for such purpose, are recognized much more 
quickly and accurately by one who is buying many horses 
daily than by those who buy one only occasionally. 
There are a few considerations that apply with equal force to 
all classes of animals, such as the examination in general, esti- 
mating age, detecting unsoundness, and the like.’ These will be 
discussed first; then we will pass to the choice of the individual. 
GENERAL EXAMINATION OF THE HORSE 
In examining a horse, some system should be followed in 
order that no point go unnoticed. To facilitate this and “to 
aid in establishing uniform values for the various points of the 
animal, the score-card was devised. Official score-cards have 
been adapted for many of the breeds, and while of little prac- 
tical value in choosing or judging a horse, they do aid in estab- 
lishing a uniform standard for the breeder. The examination 
of the horse cannot always be made at leisure, but’ enough 
time should be taken, if possible, to make the task complete. 
Examination in the stable. — When possible, the horse should 
first be examined in the stable. Note the way in which the 
animal is tied to the manger; whether he has been chewing 
the tie-strap or the fixtures; how he stands in the stall; and 
his general behavior, when you step to his side. Note the 
horse’s conduct while grooming, particularly along the belly, 
the backs of the forelegs, and the fronts of the hind legs and 
about the flank. Harness the animal. Note the manner’ of 
taking the bit; the behavior when placing the headstall over 
the ears; the harness over the back; the crupper -under the 
tail; and when buckling the girth. 3 
The horse may now be taken from the stall.. Note the action 
_as he is being turned around. In many sale stables there is a 
contemptible practice of introducing ginger into the rectum as 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  6 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the animal is being taken out, as this serves to stimulate the 
animal and he shows to advantage. As the horse passes into 
the yard, the door-way affords a very good place to examine the 
horse’s eyes, nostrils, mouth, and noting the age.

Newburg, N. Y. 
The Arab horse, named after his native country, is particularly noted as being the 
animal that gave the English Thoroughbred running horse its speed and endur- 
ance. Arabs are full of quality, very intelligent, and docile. They are chiefly 
used as officers’ chargers, or for siring polo ponies. 
Examination of the horse in action. — First, note action while 
being led by the halter. Without regard for type, observe the 
walk. This is a much neglected though very important gait 
for all types and breeds of horses. Next note the trot, and,
-P-A-G-E-35

with the saddler-the various saddle gaits. These trials should 
take place on pavement or hard surface, as solid footing affords 
the best conditions to detect the existence of lameness. These 
gaits should be noted from the front, from behind, and from either 
side. Second, note the action when hitched to the kind of 
vehicle for which the horse is intended. Observe the horse first 
at the walk, then the trot from in front, behind, and either side. 
Notice manner of starting, turning, stopping, backing, and the 
like. The prospective purchaser should now mount the vehicle 
and drive the horse, observing his action, general behavior, 
manner of taking the bit, ease with which he is driven and 
guided this way and that. When satisfied in all respects, stop 
the horse and observe him standing after the exercise, especially 
with respect to the regularity of breathing and his manner of 
standing. Third, if the horse is intended for saddle purposes, 
in part, he should be tried out under the saddle, observing his 
behavior when mounting, the ease of movement and the like, 
with even more caution than when being led or hitched to a 
vehicle. 
HOW TO ESTIMATE THE AGE OF A HORSE 
The age of a horse is an important factor in determining his 
present and prospective value. Familiarity with the characters 
that indicate age are, therefore, often extremely useful. A 
knowledge of these characters is not difficult to secure, but skill 
in their application depends much on continued practice. 
General considerations. —In estimating the age- of a horse, 
the teeth furnish the best index, yet there are other general con- 
siderations that play an important part, especially in the case 
of young and very old animals. In estimating the age of young 
animals, size is the principal factor to be considered. In very 
old horses, white hairs make their appearance around the temple, 
the eyes, the nostrils, and elsewhere; the poll or top of the head 
\\ becomes more pointed; the sides of the face more depressed ;
-P-A-G-E-36
  8 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the hollows above the eyes deeper; the backbone becomes more 
prominent and often strongly curved downward, and the animal 
does not stand squarely on his legs, which show more wear. 
Examination of the teeth. — While the order of the appearance 
of the teeth and their method of wearing are considered the most 
important and accurate means of estimating the age of domestic 
animals, and are the means employed by all horsemen, these are 
not absolutely accurate, and much depends on the condition as 
well as the individuality of the animal. The teeth of animals 
that have bones of somewhat open structure are likely to in- 
dicate that the animals are older than they really are; while 
the teeth of those whose bones are of fine close texture may 
indicate them to be younger than they are. Again, animals fed 
on soft and succulent food are likely to show a younger mouth, 
whereas those fed on hard, dry food are likely to show an older 
mouth. 
The horse when full grown has forty teeth, twenty on either 
jaw, divided as follows: six nippers, two canines, one on either 
side, and twelve molars, six on a side. In the mare the canines 
are usually absent. Since only the nippers or incisor teeth are 
inspected in estimating the age, they alone will be considered. 
It is the order in which the nippers make their appearance that 
enables us to estimate the age of the horse up to five years, 
and the manner in which their surface is worn that aids us in the 
estimation from five to eleven years of age. After the horse has 
passed the eleventh year it is difficult to determine the age. In 
practice the age is designated as eleven, twelve, or fifteen past, 
as the case may be, but how much past cannot be told with any 
degree of accuracy. ; 
The colt is provided before the end of the first year with a set 
of temporary or milk teeth, the first or middle pair appearing 
at about two weeks of age; the second or intermediate pair at 
one to two months of age ; and the third or lateral pair appearing 
at about ten months of age. The difference in size of the jaw-
-P-A-G-E-37
CHOOSING A HORSE 9 
bone between the foal and the grown horse makes a change from 
milk to permanent teeth necessary. The permanent replace 
the temporary teeth at two and one-half or three years of age 
up to five years. It is seldom that one is called on to esti- 
mate the age before two and one-half years because the ani- 
mal has not yet reached the period of usefulness, and even if 
the age must be estimated, size is considered more than any 
other factor. 
Three years old. — At about two years and nine months of 
age the permanent pair of center nippers replaces the temporary 
ones, and by the time the animal is three years of age they are up 
and ready for use. They will have deep cups and are much 
larger than the temporary teeth. If the colt be a male, small 
tusks will appear at about this time. 
Four years old. — At about three years and nine months, the 
intermediate pair of permanent nippers appear and is up and 
ready for use at four years of age. The center pair shows much 
wear and the cups are about one-third gone. The tusks, if 
any, have enlarged, but are still sharp on their points and flattish 
on the inside. 
Five years old. — At about four years and nine months, the 
permanent corner nippers make their appearance and are up 
and ready for use at five years of age. At five years of age the 
horse has a full mouth of permanent teeth; the center nippers 
show two years’ wear and have changed slightly in shape, having 
become rounder on the inside, the cups being two-thirds gone ; 
the intermediate nippers show one year’s wear, the cup being one- 
third gone. Five years is the age preferred on the market, and 
occasionally horsemen extract the temporary nippers, which 
hastens the appearance of the permanent teeth. 
Six years old. — The cups in the center pair in the lower jaw 
have disappeared, or nearly so; they» have become much 
smaller in ‘the intermediates and show one~year’s-wear-in the 
corner nippers.

Seven years old. — At seven, the cups are gone from the inter: 
mediate pair in the lower jaw, and have become quite shallow 
in the corner nippers. There is a notch in the upper corner 
nipper where it overlaps the lower one. Marked changes in 
shape have taken place in thenippers; they are becoming thicker 
from inside out, rounder on the inside, and meet at a sharper 
angle than when they first made their appearance. 
Eight years old. — At eight years, the cups are gone from all 
the nippers of the lower jaw. They are present in all of the 
upper jaw. 
Nine years old. — The cups in the center pair of nippers of 
the upper jaw have disappeared, but are still present in the 
intermediate and corner nippers. The cups are not likely to 
disappear at as regular intervals in the upper jaw as they did 
in the lower. Therefore it is not always possible to tell the age 
of the horse so accurately. 
Ten years old. —At ten years of age, the cups have disappeared 
from the upper intermediates, but are still retained in the corner 
nippers, though shallow. The teeth are more triangular in 
shape, and those of the upper and lower jaw meet at a sharper 
angle as the age increases. 
Eleven years old. — At eleven years, the cups are gone from 
all the nippers of the upper jaw. However, because of the fact 
that some horses have denser bones than others, it is not un- 
common to find shallow cups in the upper corner teeth as late 
as the twelfth or the fifteenth year. 
Aged horses. — After the horse has passed the twelfth year, 
the matter of a year or two amounts to little. Much depends 
on the individuality of the animal, as some animals are worth 
more at fifteen than others at twelve. One’s judgment of the 
value of a horse at these ages should be formed on general ap- 
pearances and activities rather than on age. 
In old horses, the nipper teeth have become nearly triangular, 
showing long wear and meeting at an acute angle. The tusks

are large, blunt, and round. The 
nippers may have grown out so long 
as to prevent the grinders from 
meeting, in which case a horse will 
spit out his food after masticating a 
part of it. If the nippers are rasped 
off, the grinders will meet, and the 
horse’s life will be somewhat pro- 
longed. 
Irregularities in the teeth.—It 
often happens that the teeth are 
not regular, in which case the horse 
is said to have afalse mouth. These 
irregularities may occur in the 
number: there may be more or less 
than the regular number — thirty- 
six in mares or forty in horses; they 
may occur in the form of the teeth or 
the uniting of two teeth; they may 
occur because one jaw happens to 
be longer or shorter than the other ; 
they may come as the result of 
cribbing, some horses have the bad 
habit of biting the stall fixtures or 
other surrounding objects, thus break- 
ing off the free borders of the teeth, 
which make the teeth irregular and 
which must not be confused with 
normal wear. Such cases can usu- 
ally be recognized by the broken-off 
particles and the roughed surface. 
Irregularities may result from the 
employment of fraudulent means,

mouth the characteristics of that period of life in which the 
horses have their greatest value, thus endeavoring to make the 
young appear old and the old appear young. It is ordinarily 
easy for one of experience to detect a mouth that has been tam- 
pered with. While many are very skillful at bishoping, it is a 
hard matter very materially to alter the mouth without detec- 
tion. After the teeth have once been interfered with they can 
no longer serve as an index in estimating age, the dental tables, 
the cups, and the like having been partly or wholly destroyed. 
DETECTING UNSOUNDNESS 
A satisfactory definition of soundness or unsoundness is not 
easily given. The term “unsound” as used by horse dealers 
in this country is often loosely applied. It may mean anything 
from a mere bad habit to a defect that renders the animal 
absolutely worthless. The best usage warrants dividing these 
imperfections into two classes — blemishes and unsoundness. 
A blemish may be defined as something that depreciates the 
value of a horse without interfering with his usefulness, such as 
wire cuts, car bruises, and the like which mar the appearance of 
a horse but do not limit his functions. 
An unsoundness may be defined as an imperfection of so serious 
a nature as to interfere with the usefulness of the horse, such as 
ring-bones, side-bones, splints, curbs, and the like. 
The ability to detect unsoundness depends largely on practice; 
yet some imperfections cannot be detected by an ordinary ex- 
amination, and it is only after becoming familiar with the animal 
that these will be observed. In examining a horse for unsound- 
ness, it is well to follow a regular order beginning with the head 
and ending with the feet. There are a great number of im- 
perfections to be found among horses, too many to be catalogued 
here. The following list contains the more important : — 
Decayed and broken teeth.—A foul odor indicates decayed 
or unsound teeth. This can easily be detected, as it attaches

itself to the hand on being introduced into the mouth. Nippers 
with broken edges indicate that the horse is addicted to cribbing.

by J. Crouch & Son, Lafayette, Ind. Sold to W. 8. Corso, Whitehall, IIL, 
for $10,000. ‘‘Champion Percheron Stallion of America.’’ 
The Percheron draft horse, a native of La Percha, France, is noted for his massive 
size, quality, endurance, and action. In weight, stallions usually average 
from 1700 to 2000 pounds and mares from 1400 to 1800 pounds. In height, 
stallions range from 1514 to 17 hands and mares from 15 to 1614. The color 
is exceedingly variable, though black and dapple gray predominate. This is 
the most common breed of heavy draft horses in the United States. 
Discharge from the nostrils. — There should be no discharge 
from the nostrils, which should be fresh pink in color. A profuse
-P-A-G-E-44
16 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
colored discharge suggests glanders, distemper, shipping fever, 
and similar diseases. This may be only temporary, but one can- 
not afford to take the risk. 
Impaired vision. — A horse by its action will usually betray 
imperfect eyesight. Blind horses have a peculiar high stepping 
gait or are inclined to shy readily and often without cause. The 
ears are exceedingly active, as if trying to aid the eyes. Blind- 
ness may be discovered by moving the hand gently in front of the 
eyes or by closing the eye with the hand and excluding the light 
for a moment; the pupil should dilate to its utmost capacity ; 
when the hand is removed and the light strikes the eye, the 
pupil should rapidly contract to its normal size. This shows 
that the eye is sensitive to light. 
Defective hearing. — When the horse’s ears are rigid, it in- 
dicates that the hearing is defective. The animal is unre- 
sponsive when spoken to, and the eyes are active. Defective 
hearing is more common than supposed. 
Poll-evil is a disease located at the top of the head and is in- 
dicated by the parts being exceedingly tender. Its causes are 
many, and it is very serious. 
Sweenied shoulders is a wasting away of the muscle on the out- 
side of the shoulder blade. This can be readily detected as 
the shoulder appears flat and the blade bare of muscle. 
Fistule. — Exceeding tenderness at the withers may in- 
dicate that the horse has fistule, though at the time there may 
be no external signs. 
Capped elbows.—Sores formed on the elbows while the ani- 
mal is lying down are unsightly and can readily be seen. 
Unsound knees. — The knee should be examined for bony 
enlargements, wind-puffs, scars on the front, and speed-cuts. 
Scars on the front indicate the horse is a stumbler. 
Splints. — Bony bunches on the inside of the cannon are 
called splints.. These must not be confused with the two small 
bones associated with the cannon. Splints located on the back
-P-A-G-E-45
  CHOOSING A HORSE 17 
part of the leg near the tendon or close to the knee joint are con- 
sidered most objectionable, as they are likely to interfere with 
the action and cause the animal lameness. When located on 
the side, they are less likely to cause lameness and not so objec- 
tionable. Splints may disappear from young draft horses. 
Ring-bones. — Bony bunches on the fetlock and pastern are 
called ring-bone. There are two forms, called high and low, 
depending on the location. 
Side-bone. — Just at the top of the hoof, on either side, the 
cartilages should be examined to see that they are not ossified, 
forming side-bones. These are common on the front feet only. 
Scratches is located on the back of the pastern, and can be 
easily detected; it often causes the horse a great deal of pain 
and annoyance. 
Unsound hoofs. —'The hoofs should be closely examined for 
quarter cracks — cracks extending from the coronary band 
downward; for sand cracks — 
cracks extending from the bot- 
tom upward; for seedy toe — 
a softening of the wall at the 
toe of the hoof; for thrush — 
a diseased condition of the foot 
in the region of the frog, which 
makes its presence known by 
a disagreeable odor ; for quitter

in animals with weak low heels; for laminitis or founder — 
congestion of blood in the region of the toe, common in heavy 
horses; and for navicular disease — caused by overworking 
the tendons that pass to the navicular bone, common in 
light and very active animals.

Thoroughpin occurs between the tendon and the upper point 
of the hock. It consists of a soft swelling and may be easily 
detected, as it can be pushed from side to side. 
Spavin. — There are three kinds of spavin—bone, bog, and 
occult. Bone-spavin is the most common, and consists of a 
bony growth on the inside and 
front of the hind leg just below 
the hock. To detect bone- 
spavin, stand in front and to the 
side of the animal so the inner 
outline of the hind leg may be 
clearly seen. Bog-spavin occurs 
in the natural depression on the 
inner and front part of the hock 
and consists of a soft swelling, 
on eae a formed by the oil, which accumu- 
“Coco.” A noted prize winner. lates from the joint. The term 
“blood spavin” is sometimes 
applied to the enlargement of the vein that passes across the 
hock from the front. Occult-spavin is located in the joint and 
is hard to detect. The usual method of detection is to lift the 
suspected leg and then start the horse off quickly. 
Stringhalt is a marked jerking of the hind leg as the horse 
travels. In some cases it is seen only when the horse first starts 
and disappears after a few steps have been taken. 
Curb occurs on the back of the cannon just below the hock. 
It may be easily detected by looking at the leg from the side, 
as it is a variation from a straight line that should run from 
the point of the hock to the fetlock joint. 
Forging-and_overreaching. — A horse is said to forge when 
the shoes of the hind feet strike those of the fore feet, 
making a characteristic sound. Overreaching is the striking 
of the fore and hind feet in such a way as to injure the 
horse. 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
CHOOSING A HORSE 19 
Interfering. — A horse is said to interfere when he strikes his 
fore or hind feet together in such a way as to injure them. 
Locating lameness. — When standing, a horse troubled with 
sore feet will extend them as far as possible. If only one is 
sore, he puts the lame one forward and is often spoken of as a 
pointer. When the trouble is in the shoulder, the leg will be 
flexed at the knee. When in motion, the horse puts the sound 
foot down with confidence and makes an effort to ease the ailing 
one by throwing the head up as it strikes the ground. 
Unsound in wind. — There are three common defects in the 
wind — unsound wind, roaring, and heaves. To detect these, 
drive the horse rapidly for half a mile, then stop quickly and 
listen to the breathing by placing the ear near the lungs or by 
standing near the neck. If the horse gets his breath with 
difficulty, he is thick winded. If in breathing he wheezes and 
whistles, he isaroarer. If the breathing is irregular, it is likely 
he is troubled with heaves. To detect this, observe the flanks 
for the characteristic double movement, as the air from the lungs 
seems to be half expelled when the respiration stops for a brief 
period and then the expulsion of the air is completed. 
If a horse has passed through many hands in a short period, 
it is safe to conclude that there is some radical blemish or 
unsoundness that is not easily discovered. 
TYPES OF HORSES 
There are two distinct types of horses. First, is the light 
type, useful for light work and for speed. This group is further 
ivided into running, trotting, pacing, saddling, coaching, ex- 
pressing type, and the like. Second, the heavy type for heavy 
work and is further divided into light draft, medium draft, and 
heavy draft type. Horses belonging to the first type are usually 
designated light horses; those belonging to the second, draft 
horses. As the form or conformation best adapted for one is 
different from that of the other, we cannot find both united in
-P-A-G-E-48
  20 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the same animal. It is a physical impossibility to have maxi~ 
mum speed and maximum draft in the same engine, and such 
is none the less the case among horses. 
The light type. — In conformation, horses belonging to the 
light type vary considerably, depending on the purpose for which 
they are adopted. For example, the saddle horse differs in 
many respects from the running horse, and the trotter or pacer 
has many characteristics unlike either. However, since horses 
belonging to the light type are each intended for light and rather 
fast work, they possess many points in common. 
In general conformation, the light type of horse is rather tall, 
upstanding, the limbs long, the distance from the chest to the 
ground is more than one-half the height of the horse from the 
withers to the ground. The distance from the withers to the 
knee and from the hips to the hock is great. The animals are 
somewhat narrow but rather deep in front. In general form 
the light type resembles the greyhound. 
Heavy type. —In general conformation, the heavy type of 
horse is massive, blocky, low set, the limbs short, the distance 
from the chest to the ground one-half the height of the animal 
from the withers to the ground. In general form, this type 
resembles the bull-dog. Weight is important. In order to © 
pull heavy loads the draft horse must possess plenty of weight. 
A draft horse in fair condition at maturity weighs from 1500 to 
2400 pounds, according to the class. 
CHOOSING A LIGHT HORSE 
Having considered the method of procedure and the type, we 
will now discuss the desirable and undesirable characters of each 
type. For convenience these are divided into two classes: 
first, the general appearance, those characters having to do with 
the horse as a whole, such as form, quality, and action; and 
second, the detail characters, having to do with each point in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
CHOOSING A HORSE 21 
dependent of the others, such as the head, neck, shoulder, and 
the like. 
General appearance in light horses 
The form, action, quality, color, and temperament are very 
important characters among light horses, and add to or detract 
from their desirability. 
Form. — One of the first characters to attract attention 
among light horses is the general form. In those of good form 
there is a peculiar balance and harmony throughout the make-up 
which is difficult to describe and must be observed to be appre- 
~ ciated. The form varies according to the object sought, that 
of the coacher being full and plump, while that of the trotter 
or runner will be lean and angular. The position and direction 
of the limbs should receive special consideration. They should 
be viewed from in front, behind, and either side. In this con- 
nection, it will prove helpful if one will bear in mind that the 
limbs should be so formed as to meet the following requirements : 
the fore leg when viewed from the side should be so formed 
that a plumb line dropped from the elbow joint would pass 
through the middle of the knee, the cannon, and the fetlock, and 
fall a short distance behind the heel ; when viewed from in front, 
the line lowered from the point of the shoulder would divide 
equally the knee, the cannon, and the foot, leaving between the 
two feet an interval equal to the width of the hoof. The hind 
leg when viewed from behind should be so formed that a plumb 
line lowered from the point of the buttock will pass through the 
middle of the hock, cannon, pastern, and foot, leaving between 
the two feet an interval almost equal to the width of the hock. 
This line should also just touch the back of the hock and the 
fetlock joint. 
Action. — In the market for light horses there is no single 
feature held in higher estimation than that of good action. 
Desirable action varies according to the object sought, but to
-P-A-G-E-50
  22 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
sell ,vell a light horse must possess as much as may be displayed 
and used to advantage. Excellence at a walk is a very desirable 
quality in all types of horses. The feet of the active walkers 
leave the ground with a quick snap, and move straight away, 
swerving neither to the right nor to the left, nor should the folding 
of the knees or the flexing of the hocks result in an outward 
pitching or spreading. In addition to being snappy, regular, 
and straight, it should be fast. This is a point often neglected, 
and many good acting horses are provokingly slow walkers. 
Action at the trot will vary according to the class. In the 
roadster a strong, long-reaching knee-and-hock action, with the 
feet picked up 
snappy, is most es- 
sential. The stride 
should be long and 
not too high. In 
the coacher, a rather 
high, bold knee-and- 
hock action is the 
most sought. In 
all classes the move- 
ment should be 
straight and regu- 
lar. There must 
be style and dash

  planting of the feet. 
The foot should be snapped from the ground and carried for- 
ward, while the limb unfolds, as if following the rim of a 
wheel. The hind feet should leave the ground with the same 
quick movement, and at no time should be allowed to hang 
back and give the horse the appearance of not gathering him- 
self well together. 
Quality is a term rather loosely applied and has reference to 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
CHOOSING A HORSE 23 
the bones, skin, and hair. Evidences of desirable quality are 
clean-cut features, soft skin, silky hair, and clean dense bone. 
In those horses possessing quality the lines of the face are 
clearly defined, the veins in the skin show clearly, and there is 
a complete absence of coarseness. Freedom from coarseness in 
the joints and tendons emphasizes soundness and guarantees 
durability. Another evidence of quality is seen in those ani- 
mals whose muscles stand out clearly defined and distinct. The 
best way to determine quality is to run the hand down the leg 
over the knee and cannon bone. The hair and skin should feel 
soft and pliable'to the touch and the bone firm and smooth. 
The fingers should seem almost to touch each other as they 
pass between the tendon and the bone. 
Coarse hair is associated with coarse thick skin which indi- 
cates an abundance of connective tissue which in turn is asso- 
ciated with soft, spongy bones that cannot endure strain or 
hard usage. 
The temperament is reflected in the action and manners. It 
should be lively and pleasant. When possible, the purchaser 
should know something of the ancestors of the horse under 
consideration, as a horse may inherit characteristics which can- 
not be discovered until he has been used some time, and 
peculiarities of temper are among these characters. 
Detail characters of a light horse 
Having considered the general appearance of the light horse, 
then pass to a detailed examination of the characters; and in 
order that none go unnoticed they should be observed in the 
following order : — 
Head. — Among light horses the head should be lean, with 
broad forehead tapering towards the nostrils, and the features 
of the face should be distinct. The nostrils should be large, 
open, and of pink color. The eye should be large, full, clear, 
and bright, indicative of a kind, generous disposition and good
-P-A-G-E-52
24 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
health. The jaw-bones should be strong and wide, providing 
ample room for a large wind-pipe. The ears should be active, 
refined, neither large nor small, carried close and erect and turn- 
ing slightly in at the tips. Lop ears indicate laziness. A 
smooth neat attachment of head to neck is highly essential, a 
fullness at the throat and about the wind-pipe being most 
undesirable. 
Neck. — A nicely arched and well-muscled neck of sufficient 
length, carrying the head gracefully, is a highly desirable feature. 
  
  Fic. 22.— An American Trotter. A driving horse of good form. 
The American Trotting breed of horses developed in United States. The breed 
is the outgrowth of a demand for a light road horse possessing speed and en- 
durance. The weight and height are exceedingly variable. The body is light, 
narrow, but deep, and the legs are long, but clean, and free from coarseness. 
All colors are found, but solid colors such as browns and bays are preferred to 
grays, roans, and the like. 
of the light horse. Much of the style and symmetry of the 
coach horse is observed in the make-up and carriage of the 
head and neck. The wind-pipe should be large, and the outline 
appear distinct from the rest of the neck. Many excellent road 
horses have a ewe neck, but it detracts very much from the. 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
CHOOSING A HORSE 25 
general appearance. The neck and body should blend smoothly 
at the attachment. 
Chest. — Among light horses the chest should obtain its 
capacity more from depth than width. A deep chest permits 
a freer play of the shoulders, and indicates staying power. 
A wide chest throws the fore legs out of line with the hind ones 
and causes the horse to paddle or roll in his action. The chest 
should be not only deep, but the breast should be carried forward 
with some prominence. 
Shoulders. — To give elasticity to the movement and to per- 
mit of quick and clean action the shoulder should be long and 
sloping well into the back, thus strengthening the back and 
extending the length of the underline. The high action of the 
coach horse and the long-reaching clean action of the roadster 
depend much on a long oblique shoulder. A steep shoulder 
prevents a strong rapid movement and results in hard stilted 
action, leading to defects of feet and legs. 
Arms. — Among light horses the arm should be short and 
comparatively upright, giving the animal an upstanding ap- 
pearance. 
Elbows. — The elbow should work snugly alongside the 
animal; if too closely “tied in,” as it is termed, the toes are 
usually thrown out; if turned out, the toes are likely to be 
thrown in. 
The fore-arms should be long, wide, and well muscled. The 
capacity of the animal to cover much ground at a step depends 
on the direction of the shoulders and the length of the fore- 
arms. Long sloping shoulders, upright arms together with 
long fore-arms, give much distance from the withers to the knee, 
which is considered very essential in animals of speed. -The 
muscles should be well developed and stand out distinctly just 
below the junction of the leg and body and taper gracefully 
downward. The fat accumulates very little at this point, and 
it is a safe guide to the muscular development of the animal.

  26 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The knees should be wide, deep, and straight. They should 
be much broader in front than the rest of the leg, either above 
or below. Breadth is desirable because the concussion is more 
evenly distributed among the several bones forming the knee 
joint. The bone forming the projection at the back of the 
knee should be prominent, since this gives a better attachment 
for the muscles and tendons which pass over it, thereby giving 
the leg a deeper appearance and increasing the efficiency. The 
knees are subject to many defects more or less serious, such as 
calf knees, knock knees, spring knees, open knees, speed cuts, 
sears, and the lik i Bnae/ 
The cannons/should be short, wide, clean, and the tendons 
well detached. The back tendons should be parallel to the 
cannon-bones, and there should be no shrinking below the 
knees, as it indicates weakness. This defect is spoken of as 
“tied in,” and is quite common among light horses. The cannon 
should be free from bony growths and puffiness. Evidences of 
firing or blistering to remove such growths are series of lines 
on the cannons or roughened places caused by blistering. On 
running the hand oyer the cannons they should be free from 
gumminess, puffs, and bony growths. 
The fetlock joint should be clean, free from fullness due to 
wind-galls, and should be wide, giving favorable attachments to 
the tendons. 
The pasterns should be sloping and strong. When the horse 
is standing, they should form an angle of 45 degrees with the 
floor and 135 degrees with the cannons. The upright pasterns 
cannot resist concussion, and bone diseases, such as ring-bones, 
side-bones, and the like, are the result. Again, it lessens the 
usefulness of the light horse, especially the saddler, as the step 
is short and stilted and very disagreeable to the rider. On the 
other hand, the pasterns are sometimes too long and slanting, 
especially among thoroughbreds, which weakens them, and occa- 
sionally ends in snapping the suspensory ligaments, resulting in
-P-A-G-E-55
  CHOOSING A HORSE 27 
the animal “breaking down.” There should be freedom from 
wind puffs and bony growths, as in the cannon. 
The feet should be round, dense, fine in texture, of good size, 
and perfectly sound. They should be of equal size and shape 
and in line with the pastern. The hoof should have an oily 
coat of natural wax, and should not appear flat, brittle, shelly, 
or contracted. The heel should be rather vertical and about 
one-half length of toe. The sole should be concave; the bars 
strong, and the frog large, elastic, and bear the mark of natural 
usage as a buffer. The dark-colored feet seem to be in favor. 
The ribs should be well sprung from the spine, of good length, 
and well inclined to the rear. The well-sprung rib gives lung 
capacity, the deep rib gives digestive capacity, and the ribs 
well inclined to the rear add much to the strength of the back. 
Body. — The back should be short, strong, and well muscled. 
The body should have a short back with a long underline 
which not only adds strength to the back, but gives the legs 
free play and insures freedom of movements. The long back, 
the roach back, and the sway back are all very objectionable. 
The loin should be wide, short, thick, and strongly joined. 
This combination results when the ribs are directed well back- 
ward. If the distance from the last rib to the hip is great, the 
horse is likely to be weak in the coupling and irregular in his 
action. 
The croup should be long, muscular, and fairly straight. The 
croup of light horses should be more horizontal than in heavy 
horses. This in connection with its length allows greater play 
of the main muscles, which is favorable to the production of 
speed. The short, oblique croup interferes with the utility of 
the light horse and detracts from the general appearance. While 
examining the croup, the hips should also be observed to see 
that they are of equal prominence and squarely placed. 
The thigh should be muscular, long, and deep. It should be 
so situated as to extend the muscles as far down towards the
-P-A-G-E-56
  28 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
hock as possible, without giving the leg too straight an appear- 
ance. Some horses are so straight in this respect that the 
muscle extends to the hock, giving it a thick appearance. Horses 
show much variation in the muscling of the quarters; some are 
full and heavily muscled, some decidedly lacking and called 
“cat hammed,’’ while others are fairly full in this region, with 
deep, hard muscles. 
The hind legs from the. thigh to the hock should be long, 
fairly straight, and well muscled, though they must not be too 
straight, thereby causing either thoroughpin or bog-spavin. 
On the other hand, if the legs are bent too far forward, it is 
likely to develop curb. The position of the croup and thighs, 
together with the long legs, should be such as to give length 
from the hip to the hock, as this is the conformation desired 
among animals of speed. 
The hocks should be wide, properly set, and clean. They 
should also be free from gumminess, fleshiness, and puffs of all 
kinds, and the bone firm without the least indication of unsound- 
ness. The bone forming the point of the hock should be 
prominent, since this gives a better attachment for the muscles 
and tendons which pass over it, thereby giving the hind leg a 
deeper appearance and increasing its efficiency. The hocks 
are subject to many defects more or less serious, such as cow 
hocks, capped hocks, open hocks, crooked hocks, and the like. 
The hind cannons should be short, wide, clean, with tendons 
well detached and parallel to cannon bones, which gives 
better attachments and strengthens the cannon. Slender hocks 
and narrow cannons, especially at the top, indicate a predis- 
position to curbs on account of the weakness thus produced. 
The cannon should be free from all evidences of unsoundness. 
The hind pasterns should be sloping and strong. When the 
horse is standing, they will be more upright than the front 
pasterns, and this is not so objectionable as there is less con- 
cussion on the hind foot, the weight borne being only four-
-P-A-G-E-57
  
CHOOSING A HORSE 29 
ninths that of the total weight, and in addition the hind limbs 
are not intended to break concussion as are the fore limbs. 
The hind feet should be oval, dense, fine in texture, of good 
size, and perfectly sound. They are inclined to become 
narrow, the sides often appear sunken, leaving them rather flat, 
thus causing the foot to appear narrow. The hind feet should 
have the characteristics that have been described in the refer- 
ence to the desirable points of the fore feet. 
CHOOSING A HEAVY HORSE 
In choosing a heavy horse, it must be borne in mind that the 
fatter the animal the more difficult it is to detect many of the 
defects which would stand out clearly were the animal not 
padded with a thick coat of fat. A horse in serviceable condi- 
tion will often show many defects, especially in the body, that a 
thick coating of tissue will hide. By changing the food one can 
increase or diminish the size of the abdomen: thus by feeding 
food containing much bulk, the shape of the narrow-gutted horse 
is modified; by feeding concentrated foods, such as oats, the 
cow-belly can be made to disappear. By regulating the light 
in the stable and increasing the temperature, the coat can be 
made to assume brighter shades and to reflect a more brilliant 
luster. By removing or clipping the hairs scattered over the 
face, around the mouth, nostrils, eyelids, along the lower jaw; 
in diminishing the thickness and length of the mane and tail; 
in clipping the thick hairs along the cannons and pasterns; and 
finally in cutting the hairs on the inner surface of the ears, the 
apparent quality of the horse can be greatly changed and a 
rough, coarse animal can be made to take on a rather refined 
appearance. 
General appearance in heavy horses 
The same general method should be followed in examining a 
heavy horse as in the light, with the difference, that we place 
much stress on weight.

The Clydesdale draft horse originated in Scotland. An active breed, though 
not so heavy as the Shire or so massive as the Percheron. In weight stallions 
average 1600 to 2000 pounds, the mares 1400 to 1700 pounds. The height 
ranges from 15 to 16% hands. Bay or brown with white on forehead and on 
the legs below the knees and hocks is the most popular color, though there are 
many blacks, grays, and chestnuts. As with the Shire, the long hair on the 
back of cannons below the knees and hocks is a breed characteristic. 
close to the ground, strong, and heavy. In animals of speed we 
find long bones, long muscles, and slightly angular joints; in 
animals of strength we find heavy bones, heavy muscles, and a 
comparative freedom from angularity about the joints.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
CHOOSING A HORSE 31 
The weight. — Among draft horses, weight is a very impor- 
tant consideration; in fact, a horse must weigh at least 1500 
pounds to be classed as a draft animal. Draft horses are 
divided into three classes according to their weight: light draft, 
1500 to 1600 pounds; medium draft, 1600 to 1800 pounds; and 
heavy draft, 1800 pounds and up. This weight must be due 
to strong bone, heavily muscled, as well as to large proportions, 
and not the result of excessive fatness. 
The importance of bulk is well illustrated in the case of 
the freight engine, in which the efficiency depends upon the 
weight to such an extent that engines are graded according to 
their weight ; thus we have the hundred ton freight engine on a 
certain section of the road and the hundred and twenty-five 
ton engine on another section. The engine must have much 
weight to keep the wheels from slipping on the track. Such is 
none the less the case among draft horses. This is well illus- 
trated in the rather common experience of the teamster whose 
team is stalled, and observing that the animals seem too 
light to push into the collar, conceives the idea of mounting 
one of the animals, when to his satisfaction they are able to 
pull the load. Illustrations of this principle are very common 
in parts of the country where the heavy cart is used in which 
the animal carries a part of the load on its back. It frequently 
happens with vehicles of this kind that when the animal is 
stalled, if a part of the load is moved forward so that a larger 
portion rests on the back, it can pull the load with comparative 
ease. 
The heavy horse is in very great demand for draft work 
in the cities. In our large cities the busy streets have be- 
come so crowded that it is necessary for the traffic to move 
slow. This has led to the use of larger loads and fewer trips, 
whereas formerly more trips were made and the loads lighter. 
To draw these heavy loads requires heavy horses; thus 
within the past few years there has arisen a great demand  
-P-A-G-E-60
  82 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
for the heavy horse. For this extra weight the market is will- 
ing to pay. It is estimated that the heavy horse is worth 50 
cents a pound for each additional pound that it weighs over 
1400 pounds. In other words, a thin horse weighing 1400 
pounds and worth $200 would be worth $250 if put in good 
condition and weighing 1500 pounds. 
The action. — While action in the heavy horse is not con- 
sidered as desirable as in the lighter types, yet it should receive 
much attention. The walk de- 
serves special notice since it is 
the principal gait of the draft 
horse. It should be observed 
in much the same manner as 
in the lighter types — from 
before, behind, and either side. 
The horse should lift the feet 
clear of the ground with much 
. snap, and the stride should be 
Fic. 24.—Cuypespare Mare. First regular. Observe the fore 
  pe International Live-Stock and hind legs to see if they 
work in unison. Horses with 
long backs and weak loins often drag their feet in a discon- 
nected manner. Observed from behind, the movement should 
be straight away and regular. The hocks are often turned 
outward, or bent inward when raised, both of which are very 
undesirable. The flexion of the hock should be free and 
straight. 
While action at the trot is not so essential as in light horses, 
yet the draft horse in trotting should go level, straight, and 
regular. The feet should be picked up with snap and carried 
clear of the ground. High knee and hock action is not 
essential, but a strong, full, true movement without paddling, 
dragging, or stiffness is very desirable. Good trotting action 
is not only valuable in itself, but it indicates many other 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
CHOOSING A HORSE 83 
desirable qualities, such as temperament, conformation, and 
soundness. 
Quality among heavy horses is as essential as among light 
ones, and the evidences are the same — clean-cut features, soft 
skin, silky hair, and clean, dense bone. The lines of the face 
will not be as clearly defined nor the veins in the skin show as 
prominently as in the light type. Quality is determined in the 
same way, and in running the hand over the cannon the bone 
should be flat, firm, and free from roughness and the tendons 
should stand out distinct from the bone. Among draft horses 
the mistake is sometimes made of considering small bone to bean 
indication of quality, which should be guarded against, as small 
bone is a very undesirable feature in a draft horse. 
Detail characters of heavy horses 
In considering the characters in detail among heavy horses 
the same general order should be followed as in the lighter 
types, in order that no character go unobserved. Only the 
differences are here pointed out, and those characters that are 
the same in both types are omitted. 
The head should be lean and of medium size. The heads of 
draft horses are as a rule larger, fuller, and coarser proportion- 
ately than in the light type. Many of the breeds of draft 
horses have a characteristic Roman nose. The assertion is often 
made that small nostrils is associated with a Roman nose, and 
consequently the respiratory or breathing organs lack develop- 
ment; also that animals with very prominent Roman noses are 
self-willed. Both statements seem to lack sufficient evidence, 
and the opinion may owe its origin to a few observations made 
on Standard-bred animals. The nostrils, eyes, jaws, and ears 
should be observed as among light horses. 
The neck should be short, strongly muscled, and massive. A 
well-arched neck is preferred. The neck of a draft horse is 
more horizontal than in horses of speed.

34 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The chest should be deep, wide, and full. Its depth is about 
one-half height of horse. Horses slack in the heart girth are 
generally of weak constitution. Exceptional width in the chest 
is likely to result in rolling and paddling motion of the fore legs. 
Shoulders. — Among heavy horses,*the shoulder should be 
moderately sloping into the back and heavily muscled. The 
statement is made that upright shoulders give increased power, 
but such a conformation increases the concussion of the bones 
and may result in unsound limbs; it also increases the length 
of the back, which may result in weakness; and the step is 
short and the action stilted. 
The arm should be short, heavily muscled, and sloping well 
to the rear, thus giving the animal a massive and low-set ap- 
pearance. 
_ Fore-arms. — Among draft horses, the fore-arms should be 
wide, heavily muscled, and large. As in the light type, the 
muscling affords a safe guide to the muscle development of the 
animal, as it is not padded with fat. 
The knees should be broad and well defined. While the knees of 
heavy animals may not be as clean cut as among lighter horses, 
yet there should be a freedom from puffiness and gumminess. 
The cannon should be short, wide, clean, and the tendons 
well detached. The Clydesdales and Shires have a fringe of 
hair, called ‘‘feather,” starting from the knee and hock behind 
and extending to the fetlock. The “feather” often furnishes 
an index to the quality, as coarse hair is associated with coarse, 
thick skin, which indicates coarse, porous bone. On the other 
hand, fine, soft hairis commonly accepted as an indication of good 
quality. : 
Pasterns. — Among draft horses the pasterns should be slop- 
ing, strong, and of medium length. Horses of this type often 
possess pasterns that are too short and too straight. This con- 
formation lacks springiness, the concussion comes more on the 
ends of the bones, resulting in ring-bones, side-bones, and the
-P-A-G-E-63
    CHOOSING A HORSE 35 
like, also in a short stilted movement of the legs. Again, pas- 
terns that are too straight often become more so with age, and 
the usefulness of the animal depreciates in proportion.

The Shire draft horse was developed in England. This breed has long been 
noted as the ‘‘Cart Horse”’ ; for heavy draft it is unexcelled. In size, Shires 
are equal to the largest stallions, ranging from 1700 to 2200 pounds, with the 
mares-correspondingly less. In height stallions average from 15 to 17 hands. 
The preferred color is bay or brown with white on the forehead and on the legs 
below the knees and hocks. Grays, blacks, and chestnuts exist in abundance. 
Long hair on the back of the cannons below the knees and hocks is a breed 
characteristic. 
The feet of the heavy horse deserve special attention, as sound 
feet are rather the exception. The feet should be round, dense, 
fine in structure, of equal size and shape, and perfectly sound. 
The hoof should be dark in color, and have an oily coat of 
natural wax. Common defects of the feet of heavy horses are: 
   
-P-A-G-E-64
86 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
soft hoof, dry and broken hoof, flat hoof, low or sloping heels, 
and large hoof. 
The body should be short, the back broad, and the ribs well 
sprung, deep, and inclined well to the rear, thus giving a short 
loin, which should be broad and thick. The upright shoulder 
gives undue length to the back, which may become roached or 
sunken. 
The croup should be broad, thickly muscled, and moderately 
sloping, although there is considerable difference in draft horses 
in this regard. A moderately sloping croup gives a favorable 
attachment of the muscles for the production of power. In 
some strains of draft horses, the croup is so very sloping that it 
detracts from their general appearance. 
The thighs and quarters should be heavily muscled. The 
direction of the thigh should be such as to give the muscles 
the most favorable attachment for the development of power. 
This means perhaps that the lower part of the thigh should 
be inclined well forward, and that the leg should be moderately 
sloping from the thigh to the hock. 
The hock of the heavy horse should be closely observed, for 
in this joint there is perhaps more work done than in any other 
single part of the body. The hock should be wide, properly 
set, and clearly defined. The tendons extending from the 
hocks downward should be lean and well detached, thus giving 
a deeper-appearing hock and a more favorable attachment of the 
muscles for developing power. Crooked, narrow, and tied-in 
hocks are subject to curbs, spavin, and the like. The hocks of 
draft horses are likely to be fleshy or gummy, thus indicating 
a liability to hock troubles and a general coarseness of the 
organization.

  CHAPTER II 
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS— GENERAL DISCUSSION 
Tue economic feeding of farm animals involves a knowledge 
of the principles underlying the practice. The better knowl- 
edge one has of the food, its source, use, composition, and di- 
gestibility, the more familiar he is with the function of the 
various food materials, and the balancing of rations, the more 
intelligently can he choose the foods that constitute the ration. 
FOOD 
Food may be defined as any material that an animal can 
take into its digestive organs and from which it can absorb 
matter for the nourishment of its own body. Plants and their 
products and by-products constitute the food of farm animals, 
although some farm animals are in part carnivorous, feeding 
on other animals or parts of animals. Matter is transferred 
directly from the food to the tissue with or without.chemical 
or physical change. Materials is not, however, the only thing 
the animal gets from the food. The plant during growth absorbs 
heat from the sun, which is held in latent form in the plant 
compounds. When these compounds are taken into the ani- 
mal body and broken apart by digestion, some of this stored 
heat may be transferred to energy. The animal therefore gets 
from the food both matter and energy. 
Use of food. The matter and energy the animal collects 
from the food are put to three distinct uses: first, to support 
life; second, to reproduce life; and third, stored up in some 
37
-P-A-G-E-66
  
38 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
form. The animal must maintain its existence, and for this 
both energy and matter are required. A large part of the energy 
of the food goes to the maintenance of the body temperature. 
The body temperature of farm animals is considerably above that 
of the surrounding atmosphere, and its maintenance requires 
much heat, as the body is continually giving off heat. The 
body tissues become worn out and must be constantly renewed. 
This must be supplied by the matter and energy from the food. 
In the case of young animals, there is a constant formation of 
new tissue. This requires more matter than energy. Again, the 
muscular function of vital processes require much energy, which 
must be supplied by the food. Of the total amount of food 
that an animal will ordinarily consume, a very large proportion 
goes to support life and a small amount to production. 
Composition of food. — The value of a food depends, among 
other things, on its composition. There is a tendency to ig- 
nore the fact that a food should be considered with reference to 
its composition. It is assumed that a pound of timothy hay, 
for example, is equivalent to a pound of clover hay, when as a 
matter of fact their composition is such as to make them widely 
different, so that one will not take the place of the other. The 
number of compounds found in the food is very large, and many 
of them very complex in their nature. For convenience in 
comparing foods, these compounds are grouped into classes. 
‘These classes are few in number, easy to comprehend, and serve 
the purpose well from a practical point of view. We recognize 
five distinct groups, one of which is divided into two sub-groups. 
They are as follows: — 
1, Water 
2.. Ash (mineral compounds) 
3. Protein iu rogencts leprnpounds) x Dry.

-P-A-G-E-67
  
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 89 
except the water, and to speak of them collectively as. dry- 
matter, and not with respect to their total weight. Ash is also 
eliminated, and the remaining three constituents are called nu- 
trients. Each of these groups has its part to perform in the nu- 
trition of animals, the function of one being different from the 
others. There are a few foods containing these several constitu- 
ents in the proper proportions to meet the needs of the animal, 
but in most foods there is an excess of one and a deficiency of the 
others. This makes it desirable to add two or more foods of 
different composition in order to supply the proper balance for 
the best development of the animal. 
Water. — Water is present in all foods, even the driest. It 
varies widely in different foods, running as low as 8 or 10 per cent 
in the case of grains or concentrates, such as corn, oats, or cotton- 
seed meal, and dried brewers’ grains, to 85 or 90 per cent in the 
more watery foods, as silage, roots, tubers, and the like. Even 
dry hay varies considerably in this respect, alfalfa containing as 
low as 9 per cent.and some clovers as high as 20 per cent. Water 
not being a nutrient, its presence or absence is an important fac- 
tor in determining the usefulness and therefore the value of afood. 
Ash. — Ash or mineral matter is present in all plant food, 
although it forms but a small part, shelled corn containing only 
1.5 per cent, and alfalfa, one of the highest, containing only 8 
per cent. The leaves and the region of the germ in grain contain 
the most ash. The animal secures the ash from the food directly 
by transfer. Most plants contain sufficient ash to meet the 
needs of the animal, corn and certain prepared foods being the 
only exceptions. In young animals, because of the large bone 
development that is taking place, in milk and egg production 
and the like, it is of special importance to have sufficient 
mineral matter supplied by the food. 
Protein. — Of the three nutrients — protein, carbohydrates, 
and fats — the protein is considered to be the most important: 
This is perhaps due to two factors; first, protein is absolutely
-P-A-G-E-68
40 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
essential to the animal body, and second, the percentage of pro- 
tein is relatively small in most plants. Like the other nutrients, 
the protein group contains 
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, 
and in addition it also con- 
tains nitrogen, which is the 
characteristic element of the 
entire group. It is on the 
element nitrogen that the im- 
portance of this group de- 
pends. Protein enters largely 
into the composition of the 
Fic. 26.—Cuampion ENGLISH SHIRE bones, muscle, lean meat, 
Srauion “Mazumore Harowp.” White of egg, and the curd of 
milk. The only source from 
which the animals can procure this protein is the protein of 
the food. 
The amount of digestible protein in various foods varies 
within rather wide limits, corn containing only 8 per cent, while 
cotton-seed meal runs as high as 32 per cent, but the larger 
number of food materials contain rather small amounts of pro- 
tein. There are comparatively few foods that are relatively 
rich in protein. The value of the food turns very largely on 
the protein which it contains. Protein is not, however, as 
digestible as some of the other nutrients. 
Carbohydrates. — There are two sub-groups of carbohydrates 
— nitrogen-free extract, and crude fiber. The carbohydrate 
group contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but no nitrogen. 
The nitrogen-free extract is composed largely of starches and 
sugars, and constitutes the larger part of the dry-matter of most 
plants. Starch alone forms as much as 75 per cent of the dry- 
matter of corn, wheat, potatoes, and some other foods. It is 
easily digested, more so than any of the other three constituents, 
and therefore foods rich in nitrogen-free extract are ordinarily 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 41 
classed as most readily digestible. Fiber or crude fiber consti- 
tutes the tough woody part of plants. The stems of all plants 
contain more fiber than does the leafy part. Variation in the 
digestibility of foods depends largely on the amount of crude 
fiber, which is mostly insoluble and hence largely indigestible. 
Crude fiber is the least valuable of the four nutrients, because 
of its indigestibility. Young plants contain less crude fiber 
than plants that have matured and formed seeds, and hence are 
more digestible. 
Fat. — Plants also contain fat or oil. It occurs in largest 
quantities in the seed, and varies widely, running less than 2 per 
cent in rye to 30 and 35 per cent in flaxseed. Fats like carbo- 
hydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but no nitrogen. 
The oil content of food is determined by extracting the fat by 
ether; hence in tables giving composition of food the fat is often 
designated as ether extract. A given weight of fat will develop 
24 times as much heat energy as an equal weight of carbohy- 
drates. If we multiply fat, therefore, by 24, it reduces it to the 
starch or carbohydrate equivalent. Fats are not so readily di- 
gested as nitrogen-free extract. 
Functions of various food materials 
A knowledge of the function of the various food materials 
wilienable one to choose and balance a ration more economically, 
and to adapt it tc the needs of the animal. A very satisfactory 
ration for a race horse may be entirely inadequate for a dairy 
cow. 
Water. — The water of the food takes the place to a certain 
extent of the water that an animal would otherwise drink. In 
the case of food containing a large amount of water, the total 
consumption of water by the animal will be greater than other- 
wise. Watery foods will not, however, satisfy the animal in this 
respect, as it will still drink water. In many cases the large 
consumption of water is of advantage to the animal; this is
-P-A-G-E-70
  42 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
particularly true of the dairy cow, which, in addition to the 
water needed for her own body, secretes large amounts in the milk. 
The animal body requires much water, particularly the younger 
ones; their bodies are more than 50percent water. Again, water 
adds succulence to the food, which increases its palatability. 
The great importance of an abundance of good water for all 
animals is often underestimated. 
Ash. — The ash or mineral matter is chiefly used in the for- 
mation of bone, but also to some extent in the tissues, blood, 
digestive fluids, and the like. Young animals fail to develop if 
given no mineral matter, and mature animals become weak and 
inactive if deprived of only one substance, that of common salt. 
Hogs, if closely confined and fed on corn alone, are likely to be 
weak-boned because of the lack of mineral matter in the food. 
If to the corn ration some food rich in mineral matter, such as 
alfalfa, or even wood ashes, is added, no difficulty is experienced. 
Hens always require more lime than is found in the food. This 
is strikingly illustrated when we compare the composition of 
eggs and corn, for example, the former containing 12.2 per cent 
ash, the latter only 1.5 per cent. The ash in the food of the 
milk cow also deserves special consideration on account of phos- 
phoric acid, lime, and potash so abundantly found in the milk 
which she secretes. In short, the ash or mineral matter in the 
food of all animals, young and old, deserves much consideration. 
Protein. — So far as is known, the proteids of the food are the 
only source of the proteids of the body. In other words, the 
muscles, the connective tissues, the blood, the skin, the hair, 
the horn, the hoofs, and the larger part of the tissues of the 
secretive and excretive organs owe their formation to the protein 
of the food. Since these are the tissues that largely determine 
the vigor and quality of the animal, and since they are formed 
rapidly in the early stages of growth, a normal and continuous 
development demands an abundant supply of protein food. In 
addition to this, protein is a source of fat and can serve as fuel, or
-P-A-G-E-71
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 43 
asa source of energy. The amount appropriated as fat and 
energy depends on the quantity fed to the animal. A pound of 
protein, however, is worth more than a pound of carbohydrates 
on the market. Then to use protein substances largely as a 
source of fat and energy, where cheaper substances would do 
fully as well’and perhaps better, as we shall presently see, is not 
economical. On the other hand, if the protein in the food is in- 
sufficient fully to supply the needs of the animal, the very best 
development will not be attained. The economy of feeding, 
therefore, depends largely on the balance between the protein 
on the one hand and the remaining nutrients on the other 
hand. It is to secure sufficient protein and yet not to useit waste- 
fully that so much attention is given to the proper balancing of a 
ration. 
Carbohydrates. — Carbohydrates are used to maintain heat 
and. in the production of fat. Formerly it was thought that 
carbohydrates are used for that purpose only, but it is now 
well established that the animal fats may have their source 
in the carbohydrates. Again, experiments with milk cows 
show clearly that milk-fat may also be derived from carbo- 
hydrates. The fact that carbohydrates can be used as heat- 
producers and as fat-formers, connected with their ease of digestion 
and cheapness of production, tends to magnify the importance 
of this group of nutrients. 
Fat. — Fat, like carbohydrates, serves as a source of heat and 
of animal fat. The differences are that the supply of carbohy- 
drates is much the larger, and the heat value of a similar weight 
of fats much the greater, —as we have already seen 2} times as 
great. Moreover, there seems to be experimental evidence 
showing vegetable fat to become deposited in the animal without 
change, whereas fat formed from carbohydrates involves com- 
plex transformation. 
From the foregoing statements, it is evident that the water 
taken into the animal serves as the water of the animal body.
-P-A-G-E-72
  44 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The ash or mineral matter taken in serves as the mineral matter 
of the animal body. The protein acquired may serve a three- 
fold purpose; it must serve as the proteid supply of the animal 
body, as, so far as known, there is no other source ; it may serve 
in heat production; and it may serve as a fat-former. The 
carbohydrates serve a double purpose, that of heat-production 
and fat-forming. The fat serves asimilar purpose as the carbohy- 
drates — forming fat and producing heat — and is 2} times as 
efficient as the carbohydrates. 
DIGESTIBILITY OF FOOD 
The value of a food depends on the digestibility of the 
various materials of which it is composed, and not alone on its 
composition as shown by a chemist. Because of the importance 
of the digestibility of the various food materials, and in order 
to get a clear conception of digestion, it will be necessary to 
review briefly the process through which the food materials 
must pass on their way from the food as such to the flesh or 
energy of the animal body. 
Digestion. — The process of digestion is largely a process of 
solution, aided to a certain extent by chemical changes that take 
place through the influence of various ferments with which the 
food comes in contact as it passes through the digestive tract. 
The digestive organs form a canal through the body, and the 
food in its passage through this tract or canal is acted upon by 
various fluids. Each fluid has a special work to do in the pro- 
cess of digestion. To begin, the food is taken into the mouth, 
where it is reduced to fine particles in order that the digestive 
juices may better do their work and to put it into condition to be 
swallowed. During this mastication there is a digestive fluid, 
called saliva, poured upon the food, which moistens it and changes 
a part of the starch. After leaving the mouth the food passes 
down the esophagus into the stomach, where the digestive 
fluid, called gastric juice, is poured upon it and which changes.a
-P-A-G-E-73
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 45 
part of the protein. When the food leaves the stomach, it enters 
the small intestines, where it comes in contact with two digestive 
fluids — the bile from the liver, 
and the pancreatic juice from the 
pancreas. The bile prepares the 
partly digested food for the ac- 
tion of the pancreatic juice and 
changes the fats. The pancreatic 
juice has a more complex func- 
tion. It contains at least three 
distinct ferments, one changing 
the proteids, another the starch, vo 
and the third the fats. As the ae aoe sie 
material passes along the intes- 
tines it comes in contact with a juice secreted by the walls 
of the intestines and which acts upon the starch, but there is 
little action on the proteids or fats. From the time the food 
enters the stomach, during its entire course along the digestive 
tract, in some way not wholly understood, the digested food has 
been absorbed and. received into vessels, through which it is 
distributed to the various parts of the body. A part of the food 
materials, however, in passing through the digestive tract, es- 
cape digestion. The amount of food digested depends on the 
kind of food, the amount fed, the class of animal, and on the 
condition of the animal’s health. 
Size of digestive organs. — The length and capacity of the di- 
gestive organs of the various farm animals differ widely. Among 
ruminating animals, — those capable of re-chewing the previ- 
ously swallowed food, — the cow, sheep, and goat, the stomach 
is a very complicated organ. It has four divisions or sacks 
called paunch, honeycomb, many-plies, and rennet. The 
paunch is very large and may be considered as a reservoir for the 
storage of bulky foods. Because of this provision, ruminating 
animals can be fed on foods containing much more bulk than can 
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  
46 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the pig or horse. The food during its retention in the paunch 
becomes thoroughly softened and undergoes some fermentation, 
then it is re-chewed, —called chewing the cud, — and swallowed. 
The stomach of the horse and pig isa single sack and has not 
nearly so much capacity. 
The varying length of intestines and capacity of stomach 
in farm animals is illustrated in the following table : —

It requires three to four days for food to pass’through the di- 
gestive tract of farm animals. Since animals of the same class 
and in good health are fairly uniform in the amount of material 
they extract from a given class of food, it is practicable to 
make digestion trials to determine the amount of the various 
food materials digested and to use these figures as a basis of com- 
putation for all animals of the same class. 
Digestible nutrients. — Digestible nutrients are those parts of 
food materials that are digested and appropriated to the ani- 
mal’s use. Our knowledge of the amount of the food materials 
that are digested is based on experimental data, and while not 
absolutely accurate, is sufficiently so for practical purposes. 
The method of determining the digestible nutrients is as fol- 
lows: The animal is fed for a sufficient length of time on a 
certain food or combination of foods, so that the digestive or- 
gans contain only the food under test. Then for a certain length 
of time the animal is fed a carefully weighed allowance of some
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 4) 
food, the composition of which has been previously determined 
by.a-chemist. Provision is then made for collecting all excreta. 
By making an analysis of this waste matter, the undigested 
protein, carbohydrates, and fat are found. This, deducted from 
the total in the food, gives the digested part. The amount of 
each constituent digested divided by the total in the food gives 
the percentage digestible. Thisis called the ‘‘coefficient of digesti- 
bility.” The grains are more highly digestible than the coarse 
fodders; for example, in corn the protein is 76 per cent digestible, 
the crude fiber 58, the nitrogen-free extract 93, and the fat 86 
per cent digestible, while in timothy hay the protein is 56 per 
cent, the crude fiber 58, the nitrogen-free extract 63, and the fat 
57 per cent digestible. 
Among the various food materials the carbohydrates as a 
rule are the most digestible, running as high as 95 per cent in case 
of corn, while the crude fiber is the least digestible, and between 
these lie fat. and protein. In general the fat is more digestible 
than the protein. As a rule, the digestible coefficient falls 
when large amounts of foods are used. If we crowd the con- 
sumption of food, the animal does not digest it as thoroughly as 
it would if fed smaller amounts. On the other hand, we cannot 
secure a greater digestibility by limiting the consumption. 
Animals under a starving ration do not digest any more than 
when fed a normal amount. 
Having the composition of the food as determined by the 
chemist, and the digestible coefficient as determined with the 
animal, it is an easy matter to calculate the amount of digestible 
nutrients in the various food-stuffs. It is with the digestible 
nutrients, and not the total food materials, that the feeder is 
concerned in choosing a ration. A great deal of work has been 
done at the various experiment stations to determine the digesti- 
bility of food-stuffs. For ready reference Table II, showing the 
amount of digestible nutrients in a large number of fonda is 
published in the Appendix of this manual. 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  48 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
CONDITIONS INFLUENCING DIGESTION 
The changes that the food undergoes in the digestive tract 
during digestion are beyond the control of the feeder. They 
proceed in accordance with fixed laws. The feeder, however, 
can manipulate the food or change the conditions under which 
it is fed so that the completeness of digestion is modified. 
Palatability. — In the case of most foods, anything that adds 
to their palatability will promote digestion. While an agreeable 
flavor or taste adds nothing to the energy of a food, the more it is 
relished the greater will be the flow of the digestive juices, the 
more thoroughly the food will be acted on by them, and the 
more completely the nutrients will be dissolved and digested. 
Palatability, therefore, is an important factor in feeding, as it 
promotes a more vigorous action on the part of the digestive 
organs, which result in a more complete digestion of the food. 
Time of harvesting. — The effect on digestibility of the time 
of harvesting plants is great. The time to harvest a plant so 
as to get the maximum amount of digestible material will depend 
much on the part of the plant that is to be used for food. In the 
case of hay, much of the food material is transferred from the 
stalk to the seed as the plant ripens. These seeds are so small 
and hard that they are not digested by the animal; hence hay 
that is cut when ripe is not so digestible as that cut before the 
seeds ripen and while the food materials were yet in the growing 
parts. Again, the riper the plants the more crude fiber they 
contain, and this we have already seen is mostly undigestible. 
In the case of corn, it is the seed that is used as food, and in this 
case the plant should not be harvested till the food materials 
have passed from the stalk into the seed. Therefore hay plants, 
or those plants of which the stems and leaves are used, should be 
cut when green, and grain plants, or those plants of which the 
seeds are used, should be cut when ripe. 
Grinding the food. —Grinding certain kinds of foods promotes 
digestion by increasing the surface exposed to the action of the
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 49 
digestive juices. It is a well-known fact that when grain is. fed 
whole, many entire grains pass through the tract. Grinding also 
saves the animal the energy of crushing the grains. Many 
experiments have been conducted, comparing the feeding of 
ground grain with whole grain, with the results in favor of grind- 
ing. The profit from grinding grain hinges, in part at least, 
upon the relation of the cost of grinding to the loss from not 
grinding. If the cost of grinding amounts to one-tenth the 
value of the grain, the probability of profit from grinding is 
small. 
Curing food. — The method of curing food may result in a 
loss of a part of the digestible nutrients. The mere curing, 
drying, or preserving of food will not alter its digestibility. If, 
however, hay is cured under adverse conditions, such as exposure 
to rain and the like, when leaching occurs, or fermentation sets 
in, or when many of the finer parts of the plants are lost, then 
the digestibility is very much lessened. 
Various processes, such as wetting, steaming, cooking, fer- 
menting, and the like, are used with the several foods prepara- 
tory to feeding, with the view of rendering them more acceptable 
to the animal. When increased efficiency occurs, it is due to 
more complete digestion rather than to added nutritive value. 
It has been fairly well proved that cooking renders some parts 
more undigestible, particularly the protein. On the other hand, 
cooking certain foods changes the mechanical condition so they 
are more readily eaten. The advantage of cooking is greater 
for swine than for any other class of animals. The addition of 
water, in the form of wetting, soaking, or even steaming, is often 
advantageous because it increases the palatability and to a cer- 
tain extent restores the succulence that the food lost in drying. 
The addition of salt will cause an animal to eat food that it would 
otherwise reject. The presence or absence of agreeable vege- 
table oils is a matter to be considered. It is difficult to under- 
stand why animals will readily eat clover and alfalfa hay, but 
2
-P-A-G-E-78
  
50 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
reject sweet clover, and why weeds, which often impart a bad 
flavor to the product, are sometimes readily eaten. 
MAINTENANCE RATIONS AND PRODUCTIVE RATIONS 
A ration may be defined as the quantity of food that will 
be consumed by an animal weighing one thousand pounds in 
twenty-four hours. In forming rations, it is necessary to take 
into account the purpose for which the animal is intended. For 
a given purpose an animal will require a given amount and 
kind of food. Thus a one-thousand-pound cow yielding 
twenty pounds of milk per day will require a certain kind and 
a certain amount of food. This is called a standard ration. For 
convenience of study, rations are divided into two general 
classes, — rations for maintenance and rations for production. 
Maintenance rations. — A maintenance ration is one that sup- 
plies the needs of a resting animal without producing any 
kind of labor and with no loss or gain of body substance. We 
have already seen that a certain amount of the food consumed 
by the animal goes to support life, maintain body temperature, 
repair waste tissue, and to provide muscular activity of vital 
processes. Since the demands on the body for maintenance 
are largely for the production of muscular energy and heat, 
nine-tenths or more of the maintenance ration may consist of 
carbohydrates. This fact has much significance in the winter- 
ing of idle animals. Strictly speaking, no farm animal should be 
fed only a maintenance ration. Animals receiving maintenance 
rations are yielding no product. All farm animals should be 
producing something at all times. 
Productive rations. — Productive rations may be looked upon 
as made up of two parts: that which is needed to maintain the 
animal, and that which may be applied to production after the 
bodily needs have been supplied. It is the food consumed in ex- 
cess of the amount required for maintenance that enables the 
animal to produce. The question, then, is as to the quantity of
-P-A-G-E-79
  
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 51 
food the animal will consume and make sufficient returns for in 
production. The more an animal consumes in excess of the 
amount required for maintenance, the more it can produce. 
While it is true in a sense that the amount of production is in 
proportion to the amount of food consumed in excess of that 
required for maintenance, it is only within rather narrow limits 
that this relation holds strictly true. The individuality of the 
animal plays an important part. All farm animals will eat and 
digest more food than is required for maintenance, but the 
amount of product that comes from this excess of food is very 
variable, and in many cases this makes the difference between a 
profitable and an unprofitable animal as well as a successful and 
an.unsuccessful feeder. This variation among individual ani- 
mals is so great that standards for production can be used only 
as mere guides. The economical and profitable feeding of farm 
animals depends much on the feeder’s observations of the 
animals directly in charge, to determine their capacity for the 
use of food. 
Feeding-standards for farm animals. — A feeding-standard is a 
rule to which all rations should conform for a given purpose. 
The Germans have done much work in establishing such stand- 
ards, which have long been in general use as guides in computing 
rations for farm animals. There is now, however, a prevailing 
impression among American investigators that these standards 
call for more protein than is needed for best results. Under 
conditions as they exist in this country, a reduction of the protein 
seems advisable, although just how much it is impossible to say. 
A reduction of 10 per cent has been recommended as not un- 
reasonable. 
BALANCED RATION 
A balanced ration is one that contains the food nutrients 
in the proper proportion to meet the needs of the animal for a 
given purpose. Skill in balancing a ration depends much on 
‘one’s knowledge of the composition and digestibility of the more 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
52 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
common foods. It is not now considered necessary to balance 
rations with the mathematical exactness that was formerly in 
vogue. Yet it must conform in a general way to the standard. 
A great number of experiments demonstrate conclusively the 
practicability of feeding the balanced ration. Balancing ra- 
tions is, however, a tedious undertaking, as there is no mathe- 
matical formula, and one must add to or take from his trial 
ration until the desired standard is obtained. 
Nutritive-ratio. — The nutritive-ratio is the proportion between 
the digestible protein in a given food and the digestible carbo- 
hydrates and fats. It is ascertained in the following manner :, 
Multiply the digestible fat by 24, add the product to the 
digestible carbohydrates, and divide their sum by the digestible 
protein. 
The method of calculating the nutritive-ratio of corn, the diges- 
tible nutrients of which are protein 7.9, carbohydrates 66.7, and 
fat 4.3, is as follows : — 
Far Heat Equivalent 
4.3 x 2% = 9.67 
CARBOHYDRATES 
9.67 or 66.7 = 76.37 
PRorein 
76.37 + 7.9 = 9.6 
Nutritive-ratio 1: 9.6 
This gives anutritive-ratio of 1 : 9.6 for corn, and it means that 
for each pound of digestible protein in the corn there are 9.6 
pounds of digestible carbohydrate and fat equivalent. A 
nutritive-ratio may be distinguished as “narrow” or “wide.” 
A narrow ration is one in which the proportion of protein is 
quite large, say 1: 4.5, whereas a wide ration is one where the 
carbohydrates are large, say 1:8 or 1:10. These terms do not 
represent exact values, but are used in a general way. 
To illustrate the method of calculating a ration for a given 
   
-P-A-G-E-81
      
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 53 
purpose, we will assume the case of a horse weighing approxi- 
mately 1000 pounds and at moderate work. From the discus- 
sion on food requirements for the horse, p. 57, we learn that the 
standard ration is as follows : —

      Let us choose from Table II of the Appendix such foods as will 
supply the conditions. For a trial ration, we will take 14 pounds 
of timothy hay, 10 pounds of oats, and 2 pounds of bran. The 
digestible nutrients in these are calculated as follows: —

This trial ration falls considerably below the standard in dry- 
matter and is too wide. We must therefore add a food rich in 
protein. We will try one pound of linseed meal, old process: —

The second trial ration is still slightly too low in dry-matter 
and protein, and somewhat too wide in the ratio. From these 
trial rations we learn the method of calculating ratios. The 
standard only serves as a general guide from which to estimate; 
then one must adapt the ration to suit his conditions. It often 
happens, as in our trial ration for the horse, that one will have an 
excess of certain nutrients and it will be of advantage to feed it 
even though it is not quite so well balanced because of the ex- 
pense of making the change; in the case above one would have 
to dispose of food containing much carbohydrates and procure 
one rich in protein. 
In cases, however, where there is a great departure from 
the standard, it would pay to make the change, as has been 
proved by many experiments at the various experiment stations 
and by the experience of our successful stockmen. 
Other methods of computing rations. — There are two other 
methods of computing rations for farm animals; one is some- 
what simpler than the above and the other much more difficult. 
In the former the ration is computed on the total amounts of
-P-A-G-E-83
  
THE FEEDING OF ANIMALS 55 
nutrients. A 1000-pound cow yielding 22 pounds of milk re- 
quires 29 pounds of dry-matter, of which at least 16 pounds 
should be digestible and 2 to 24 
pounds should be digestible pro- 
tein. The ration is calculated 
simply on the digestible matter 
and the protein. The other 
method of computing rations 
for farm animals is by the use 
of energy values of the food. 
In this method one must know 
the energy values of the vari- 
ous constituents; also amount : ) Fic. 28.— Wrypevanps “STar- 
of energy required to produce a LigHT,” Campion SHIRE Mare. 
unit of whatever is wanted. 
In other words, it is essential to know the energy required to 
produce one pound of beef, pork, mutton, or milk. Knowing 
the energy of the food and the energy required for produc- 
tion, the ration is calculated accordingly. 
Using balanced rations. — The nutritive-ratio may vary from 
the standard without serious results. Milk cows have produced 
good results on rations with a nutritive-ratio as wide as 1:8,and 
horses have fared well on rations with a wider nutritive-ratio. 
Much depends on the individuality of the animal, the conditions, 
and the individuality of the feeder. It must be remembered that 
no rules can be given that will apply in all cases, and that our 
feeding-standards are guides and not laws. 
   
-P-A-G-E-84
  CHAPTER III 
THE FEEDING OF HORSES 
Frepine the horse presents a problem of as wide interest as 
any in connection with farm animals. Practically all farmers, 
whatever branch of farming they may be engaged in, have oc- 
casion to feed horses. In addition to farmers, commercial firms 
of various kinds keep horses in large numbers, business men and 
sportsmen keep many horses for pleasure, all of whom have a 
deep interest in methods of feeding as well as the proper food. 
The farmer, the business man, and the sportsman each derive 
much pleasure in having their horses presentable at all times. 
The farmer’s relation to his horse may not be the same as that of 
the sportsman, but his interest is as great and his care as pains- 
taking. 
FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR WORK 
The work horse may be compared to a steam engine in which 
such foods as grain and hay serve as fuel, but it differs from 
the engine because fire and steam are not used toconvert the fuel 
into work or energy. In the horse the food is converted into 
energy in a different way. 
It is of interest to note that the horse makes better use of the 
energy in the food than does the steam engine of the energy in 
the fuel. It appears that about one-third of the total food 
energy can be converted into useful work with the horse, while 
the steam engine may recover as much as one-tenth of the 
energy contained in the fuel. 
Many experiments have been made to determine the exact re- 
lation between the amount of muscular work performed and the 
pa 56

amount of nutrients required per day. And as a result of such 
work the following standards have been suggested : —

These standards were arranged to meet the need of the average 
horse under normal conditions. They are to serve as guides, to 
be modified to meet conditions, and not as laws, fixed and 
absolute. 
Regularity in feeding. — The importance of regularity in every- 
thing that pertains to the management of the horse cannot 
easily be ierinarn og This applies particularly to feeding. 
Whatever feeding-stuffs are employed in the ration, the horse 
should be fed regularly and uniformly at all times. The horse 
anticipates the feeding hour, and becomes nervousif it is delayed. 
He neighs and coaxes for his food with great regularity. The 
horse’s digestive system and his vital activities become accus- 
tomed to a certain order, which should be followed. To change 
the order for even a single meal produces more or less digestive 
disturbance. The horse’s digestive system is not so large pro- 
portionately as that of a cow or sheep; he has no rumen, no place 
to store his food to be masticated at will; hence, when at work 
the horse must be fed regularly and often. Undue fasting is 
followed by taking an excessive supply of food, which in turn 
calls for excessive drinking with consequent digestive difficulties. 
Order of supplying food. — Because of the small size of the 
horse’s stomach, the order of supplying grain, hay, and. water

assumes much importance, Investigators have shown that the 
stomach of the horse must fill and empty itself two or three times 
for each meal given. It appears that during the fore part of the

The Belgian draft horse is a native of Belgium. This breed varies widely in 
weight and height, stallions from Flanders weighing 2000 pounds, those from 
Ardennais weighing about 1200 pounds, with the height varying accordingly. 
In color chestnuts are the most popular, although bays, browns, and roans are 
numerous. The Belgians lack the heavy hair on the limbs possessed by the 
Shires and Clydes. 
meal the material is pushed into the intestines almost as soon as 
it enters the stomach by the food which follows, while toward 
the end of the meal passage is slow and the digestion in the 
stomach more perfect. This being true, it would seem that the
-P-A-G-E-87
THE FEEDING OF HORSES 59 
more nutritious foods should be fed toward the end of the meal, 
especially since some of the very important nutrients are largely 
digested in the stomach and at the entrance of the small intes- 
tines. 
Watering the horse.— Many feeders think that the horse 
should be watered before feeding, while others are equally certain 
that feeding should precede watering. Each of these methods 
is probably equally good for the horse, and the one employed 
will be determined by circumstances. Certain conditions may 
make it necessary to adopt one, other conditions the other. For 
example, after severe loss of water, such as occurs in consequence 
of long-continued, severe exertion, the animal may perhaps be al- 
lowed to drink before he is fed, otherwise he will not feed well. 
On the other hand if permitted to drink to excess, this method 
of watering affects the appetite, and the horse will not consume 
so much food as he otherwise would. Again, it has been very 
clearly demonstrated that if a horse is fed his grain first and then 
watered, much of the food is carried by the water into the in- 
testines. Since the grain of the ration is rich in digestible nu- 
trients, it should stayin the stomach as long as possible, since the 
digestion of one of the most important of the nutrients is more 
complete there. From this it would seem that the horse should 
‘be given water first of all, and that should be followed by hay, 
the grain being withheld until at least a part of the hay has been 
consumed. There are, however, very serious objections to this 
practice, as the horse is unsatisfied, is anxious, and very nervous 
till fed his grain, and should not be compelled to wait for the 
grain. A middle ground should be taken by watering first, feed- 
ing the grain sprinkled with a small allowance of moistened, 
chopped hay, if possible, and watering again after the ration has 
been consumed. If this practice is followed, it will satisfy the 
desires of the horse by supplying the most palatable part of his 
food early, and yet insure the retention of the grain in the stom- 
ach for a considerable time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
    60 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Salt in limited quantities should be kept before the horse at all 
times. While little is known from investigations on this subject, 
it is evident from the extreme fondness of the horse for salt that 
it should be regularly supplied him. It is best not to place too 
much before him at a time as some horses will eat it to excess. 
The successful horseman will study each individual and modify 
the ration according to the varied needs; one horse should have 
a little more than the regular allowance, and the next possibly a 
little less, because some horses are more difficult to keep in con- 
dition than others doing the same work and under similar con- 
ditions. 
In handling horses we should remember that they are very 
sensitive animals and that we cannot be too quiet in our treat- 
ment of them. Striking them or shouting commands at them 
is an inconsiderate practice; it causes the animals to lose con- 
fidence in their master, thereby rendering them less teachable, 
and destroys nervous energy, making them less economical pro- 
ducers than if they were protected at all times from these ner- 
vous shocks. 
FEEDING THE WORK HORSE 
The work horse has a very hearty appetite, a vigorous 
digestion, and responds more readily, than any other animal, 
to intelligent care. He should be fed liberally and frequently, the 
quantity given being regulated by the size of the animal as well 
as the amount and kind of work he is required to do. In gen- 
eral, the horse should be supplied with something over two 
pounds of provender daily for each hundred pounds of weight. 
Of this about two-thirds, the exact quantity depending on the 
severity of the labor performed, should be grain in some form. 
If the work is exceedingly heavy, the grain in the ration should 
be increased and the hay diminished; whereas, if the work is 
light, the grain should be diminished and the hay increased. 
The morning meal should be comparatively light, consisting 
mostly of grain. It should not possess much bulk. In many of
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  THE FEEDING OF HORSES 61 
the larger stables in the city the mid-day meal is omitted. But 
most horsemen hold that some grain should be given at noon, 
which seems reasonable from 
our knowledge of the horse’s 
stomach. In any case, the mid- 
day ration should not be large. 
The heavy feeding should come 
at night, after the day’s work is 
over and when the animal has 
ample time to masticate and di- 
gest his food. A very good 
practice is as follows: For the ‘i i Fic. 30.—Importep Breiaian STat- morning ration, feed one-fourth Lion. ‘Three years old. 
of the daily allowance at least 
one hour before going to work. It should be in condition to be 
easily and rapidly consumed, so as to be well out of the way when 
the animal is led from the stable. After being watered, he is 
ready for the morning’s task. If the work is exhaustive and 
exacting, he should be fed after five hours of labor. When he 
comes to the stable at mid-day, he should have a drink of fresh, 
cool water, taking care that he does not drink too rapidly or 
gorge himself if very warm. At this time give him another 
quarter of his daily allowance. No greater service can be ren- 
dered the horse at this time than to remove the harness so that 
he can eat his meal in quiet and comfort and gain a few minutes 
of much-needed rest. If possible, he should have one hour to con- 
sume his meal. He should be watered again before going to 
work. He is now ready for the second half of his day’s labor. 
When the horse comes to the stable in the evening, tired and 
warm, he should, first of all, be allowed a fresh, cool drink, care 
being taken as before that he does not drink too rapidly. He is 
now ready for the remainder of his day’s allowance. Unharness 
at once, and when the sweat has dried, give him a thorough 
brushing. If for some reason the horse is forced to stand idle 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  62 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
in the stable for a few days, the ration should be decreased. 
Otherwise he will become stocky and his legs become swollen and 
stiff. 
During cold weather a more carbonaceous ration may be used. 
When more food goes to furnish heat for the body, it is reason- 
able that a horse needs a large proportion of heat-making food. 
Equal parts of corn and oats by weight would be more satis- 
factory and ordinarily much cheaper than a larger proportion of 
oats. 
  Fic. 31.—A Goop Farm Tam or Grape Betarans. Wericur 3500 Pounps 
In providing a ration, whether for summer or for winter use, 
due consideration should be given to the cost. Roughage is 
ordinarily much cheaper than grain, but a horse at work is un- 
able economically to dispose of a large proportion of bulky food. 
If considerable time and energy must be expended in masticating 
rough feed, the usefulness of the horse for work is lessened 
thereby. The more concentrated the food, within proper limits, 
the less percentage of energy will be needed to make it available. 
The proportion of grain to roughage depends on the amount 
and kind of work to be performed. A horse at hard work should
-P-A-G-E-91
  
  THE FEEDING OF HORSES 63 
never be expected to consume more roughage than grain by 
weight. 
FEEDING THE DRIVING HORSE 
The driving or carriage horse is more difficult to keep in con- 
dition than the work horse. The periods of enforced idleness, 
occasioned by lack of business engagements of his master or by 
inclement weather, are often followed by long drives and hours 
  
  Fic, 32.—A Drivine Team or Sprrir anp Goop Form. 
of over-exertion. This irregular work weakens the constitution 
of the driving horse, which generally has but a brief career. 
When daily driving cannot be practiced, underfeeding is con- 
sidered the safe course. 
In feeding this class of horses, the same general plan that has 
been suggested for the work horse should be followed. When
-P-A-G-E-92
  64 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the horse is not taken from the stable during the day, the con- 
centrates, or grain part of the ration, should at once be reduced 
by one-third and the normal allowance should not again be given 
until the work is resumed. Driving horses are usually overfed, 
because of the desire of the owner to keep them in the pink of 
condition. This overfeeding and irregular exercise are the cause 
of most of the ills of the driving horse. Oats leads easily among 
the grains. When it is fed, the horse exhibits mettle as from no 
other food. If at any time the animal should seem constipated, 
a bran mash should be given. Timothy is the preferred hay. 
While a certain amount of roughage must be fed to give bulk or 
volume to the ration in order that the digestive functions may 
be properly maintained, yet we must remember that a large ab- 
domen cannot be tolerated in a driving horse. Another factor 
that the feeder of this class of horses must ever be on his guard 
against is the feeding of laxative foods, such as clover or alfalfa 
hay or bran, in too large quantities, for when the horses are put 
on the road and warmed up, they will prove very draining on the 
system as well as disagreeable to the driver. Style and action 
are prerequisites, while economy in feeding and sometimes the 
health of the animal are held to be but secondary. Profes- 
sional drivers may not be the safest persons to advise on 
feeding. 
WINTERING THE IDLE HORSE 
On the average farm most of the work comes during the grow- 
ing season. It is more economical, and perhaps advisable, that 
the idle horse be turned into a lot, if it is well protected, to be 
roughed through the winter rather than confined too closely in 
the barn. As winter comes on the horse will grow a heavy coat 
of hair, which will afford excellent protection. Such a horse 
may be maintained wholly or nearly so upon hay, oat straw, or 
corn fodder, as it has time to masticate food, and not being 
taxed by labor, it is able to subsist on food containing a large 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
THE FEEDING OF HORSES 65 
percentage of crude fiber. It is better to have the digestive tract 
of the idle horse well distended with coarse material rather than 
contracted, as would be the case if grains possessing only the 
requisite nutrients were supplied. If the protected area is kept 
dry and well bedded, the horse can be comfortably wintered in 
this way at much less expense than by stabling. Some grain 
should, however, be fed at shedding-time, even if the horses are 
idle. Light grain feeding, together with some work, should 
begin six weeks before the spring work starts, to put the horse in 
condition. 
FEEDING THE BROOD MARE 
Many farmers are so situated that they may raise a team of 
colts each year without seriously interfering with farm operations. 
This is a good practice, as there is a demand for good horses for 
both city and farm use. A team of mares in foal can be worked 
until the day of foaling if the work is not too severe and the 
driver is careful. In fact, moderate exercise is necessary for the 
mareinfoal. Idleness is the bane of horse-rearing, and should be 
avoided whenever possible. The Arabs have a saying, “Rest 
and fat are the greatest enemies of the horse.” Mares in foal 
should be fed much as suggested for work horses with perhaps 
the addition of more protein foods, as bran and oil meal. The 
ration should be such as will supply the demands for energy and 
in addition allow abundant nourishment for the development of 
the foal both before and for a time after birth. A very good ra- 
tion for the pregnant mare is as follows: Four parts ground 
oats, four parts wheat bran or its equivalent, and one part lin- 
seed meal, with bright clover or alfalfa hay for roughage. 
Pregnant animals have a tendency to fatten as pregnancy ad- 
vances. This must be guarded against as the mare may 
become so fat as to interfere with the development of the foal, 
cause abortion or other troubles at parturition, such as milk- 
fever and the like. The ration of the mare should be reduced 
F
-P-A-G-E-94
  
66 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
just before and for a short time after foaling. If she is consti- 
pative, bran mash may be given occasionally. By the use of 
proper foods the bowels 
should be kept in good 
condition and they 
should be a little loose, 
rather than otherwise, 
at the time of parturi- 
tion. While the mare 
may be worked up to 
the time of foaling, she 
should be given a few 
days rest after foaling 
to enable her to gain her 
strength and give the 
foal the proper start. 
For the first few days of 
recuperation a hot bran 
mash fed once a day has 
both a cooling and a 
laxative effect on the

for market. Fed by H. D. Snyder & Sons. mare, and it is very 
beneficial. If all has 
gone well with the mare and foal, the mare may be put to 
work at the end of one week from the time of parturition. 
Some dams, especially those with their first foals, fail to supply 
the proper amount of milk, and the young foals do not thrive. 
In this case the mare should be provided with food which 
stimulates the milk flow. Corn and timothy hay fed alone 
are not good milk-producing foods. The ration suggested for 
the pregnant mare is better, and it could be much improved if 
a little succulent food were fed with it, such as carrots. 
Whenin season, good pasture grass is best. If there is an over- 
supply of milk, or if the milk is too rich, the food may berestricted

and themare milked, in part, by hand; otherwise the foal will not 
do well. 
FEEDING MULES 
Mules should be fed similarly to horses. The statement is of- 
ten made that a mule requires less food than a horse to do a given

amount of work. Such is not the case. True, a mule is less 
likely to overfeed and gorge himself than a horse, and will make  
-P-A-G-E-96
68 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
use of coarse foods that the horse will not eat unless forced to do so 
by neglect. Mulesare often preferred by large business concerns, 
not that they consume less food for a given amount of work than 
a horse, but that their feeding can be trusted to less skillful hands 
without seriously endangering the mule’s health. If an extra 
large mess is given him, he eats what he wishes and leaves the 
rest; not so with the tired horse, as he will eat all the grain that is 
given him up to the point of seriously endangering his health. 
For best results the ration of the mule should be comprised of 
easily digested and nutritious feeds which should be varied from 
time to time as no animal loves a variety better than the mule. 
The ration should be suitable to the kind of work. For light 
work a small quantity of grain and a relatively large quantity of 
hay is best, but when the work is severe and exacting, the quantity 
of grain should be increased and the hay decreased. As among 
all other farm animals there is much difference in individuals, 
and the successful feeder will make a careful study of each and 
modify the ration accordingly, as some should have a little 
more than the regular allowance, others less. In all essential 
features the mule is very similar to the horse, and what we sug- 
gested for horses applies with equal force to mules.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 
Tue breeding of farm animals is perhaps the most interesting 
problem connected with their propagation and care. While 
farm animals have been undergoing improvement from the time 
that we have authentic history, it is only within the last one 
hundred years or so that very great progress has been made in 
their improvement. During this period practically all of our 
breeds, as we now know them, have been formed, and great dif- 
ferentiation has taken place in the production of the various 
classes. Only recently have we paid much attention to the 
milk-producing capacity of our cattle, although cattle have 
been kept for milk: since the beginning of history ; only recently 
have we selected horses for strength, though they have been used 
én war and sport for four thousand years; and the same is true 
of all the specialized breeds. Formerly, breeders had no system 
of selection. Their standards constantly changed, so that no 
real progress in the development of the most valuable qualities 
could be made. 
Shortly after the middle of the eighteenth century, Robert 
Bakewell of Dishley Grange, Leicestershire, England, originated 
a system which le practiced in the improvement of Leicester 
sheep, Long-horn cattle, and the English cart-horse. His 
method was taken up and successfully practiced by other men; 
and we now have as the result of their labors a variety of im- 
proved breeds, each differing from the others in the particular 
characters for which they have been selected and that adapt 
70
-P-A-G-E-99
  ' 
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 71 
them to special conditions and purposes. Thus we have a strain 
of cattle that, having been selected from generation to generation 
for their milk yield, have become so profuse in the secreting of 
milk that we call them by a certain breed name. The object 
sought being milk yield and through several generations se- 
lected for this one purpose, the ability to secrete a large flow 
became fixed and capable of transmission to the offspring. 
This increased milk flow is not to be understood as a new 
character, as all cows give some milk, but merely an increase in 
the ability to secrete milk in large quantities. 
Like produces like. — Everything brings forth after its kind. 
In order that the offspring be a high-producing heifer, it is neces- 
sary that the dam and sire before her be of a high-producing 
strain of cattle. In other words, the offspring will bear a close 
resemblance to the parents in all important essentials. This 
Bakewell recognized, and he shocked the modest people of his 
time by uniting animals that possessed the characters he wished 
to propagate without regard to the relationship of the animals. 
If a cow and her son possessed the characters he wished to retain, 
he united them, and in this way secured an offspring possessing 
the desirable characters to a greater degree than either parent. 
It has been said of Bakewell that he regarded his animals as 
wax out of which in time he could mold any form that he desired 
to create. All farm animals have been molded to a great degree 
by man. It is now thought that the Percheron draft horse and 
the Shetland pony have descended from the same original type 
of horse, and that the Shorthorn and the Jersey descended from 
the same type of cow. In one case there was a continuous selec- 
tion, whether natural or artificial, for a large animal with the re- 
sult that to-day we have the ponderous draft horse; in the case of 
the pony the selection was for the smaller animal with the result 
that we have a diminutive horse. This selection has been going 
on for ages, and now the two types are fixed under their present 
sonditions. Bear in mind, however, that a reversal of the con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  72 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
ditions might result in a reversal of the type. In other words, 
if one wished to enlarge the Shetland ponies all he need do is to 
feed them abundance of nutritious feed and unite the largest to 
the largest in breeding and in time they would no longer be 
known for their small size. On the other hand, if one wishes to 
retain the small size of the pony, or to diminish it still farther, 
all that need be done is to restrict the food and unite the smallest 
to the smallest in breeding. The same is true of any character 
one wishes to propagate. From this it can be readily observed 
that we have two forces operating. The first is that like tends 
to produce like, and the second that if any improvement is 
brought about, it is through variation. 
VARIATION IS THE BASIS OF IMPROVEMENT 
If characters were absolutely fixed and unchangeable, then no 
improvement could be secured. The size of the pony could 
neither be increased nor diminished and the milk flow of cattle 
would remain constant from generation to generation, and the 
offspring would be no better than the parent. Variation, then, 
is the basis of improvement among farm animals. 
Variation universal among farm animals. — No two animals 
are alike. To those unfamiliar with swine, each pig of a litter 
may look exactly like the others, yet the trained eye readily 
recognizes differences and can describe each so that those with 
equal training may recognize them. These differences extend to 
all characters. Two cows of the same breed may differ widely 
in the richness of their milk; two steers of like breeding differ 
widely in their ability to fatten and the beef may also differ, 
the loin of one being fine and tender while the other may be 
coarse in grain. Of two sheep of the same breed, one may 
possess wool of bright luster, fine crimp, and even throughout; 
the other may have wool rather coarse, no crimp, and differ 
much in various parts of the body. There is free variation 
among living things, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 73 
Kinds of variation. — Since variation extends to each char- 
acter, it may aid us in a clearer understanding of variation among 
farm animals if we consider the subject from four points of 
view. First, we will consider that variation may be expressed 
only in form and size. This is quantitative variation, having to 
do with degree only. Such variation is the simplest form, and 
we observe evidences of it on every hand. For example, of 
two horses of the same breed, one may be large, the other small ; 
on the same animal one foot may be larger than the others; the 
two ears may not be of the same size; one eye may be larger 
than the other. Between two dairy cows of the same breed, 
one may have a very large, well-proportioned udder, the other 
small and irregular in shape. Illustrations of the first class are 
without number. The second class of variation is that which is 
expressed in the quality, as distinct from form and size. This 
is qualitative variation; that is, having to do with characters 
only. Evidences of this are also abundant. For example, of 
all the cows in existence, no two yield milk containing the same 
amount of fat; in fact, the individual cow varies widely from day 
to day. in the percentage of fat contained in the milk. Again, 
no two pieces of beef are exactly alike in flavor, tenderness, 
juiciness, and the like. The quality of no two horses is alike, — 
one has coarse, rough hair and a thick hide, the other has smooth, 
soft hair and a smooth, pliable hide. The third class of varia- 
tion has to do with the function or with the activity of the vari- 
ous organs and parts of the body, such as muscular activity, 
glandular secretions, and the like. There are many examples of 
this, such as variation in the milk flow, some cows yielding as 
high as 128 pounds in a single day; variation in the fertility, 
some cows producing only four or five young in their lifetime, 
while the Angus cow Old Granny (No. 1 of the Angus Herd 
Book) produced twenty-five, the last one in her twenty-ninth 
year; variation in speed, scent, and in fact all functions. 
The fourth class of variations has to do with deviations from 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  74 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the pattern, especially as regards repeated parts, such as ex- 
tra toes, extra teats on swine, and the like. This class is not so 
common among animals, but evidences are everywhere observed 
among plants, as stooling in wheat, oats, corn, and the like. It

It will be comparatively simple to recognize variation and to 
make improvement in any of the breeds of farm animals if these
-P-A-G-E-103
  
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 75 
classes of variation are kept clearly in mind. Not all kinds 
of variation are desired. The qualitative variations are most 
sought. 
PROXIMATE CAUSES OF VARIATION 
The conditions that bring about variation are worthy much 
consideration since one, by modifying these conditions, can aid 
in producing variation in a desired direction. For example, if 
we want to increase the milk flow of cattle, the conditions 
that will cause them to vary in that direction are of much im- 
portance and should be well understood. In general, variation 
results from environment, from crossing dissimilar animals, and 
from use or disuse, all of which are under the control of man. 
Environment. — Of all the external conditions bringing about 
variation in farm animals, those influences that we sum up 
under the term “environment ” are by far the most important. 
As a matter of fact, it is through the ability to change the 
environment of animals that man is able to induce variation and 
improvement. Among animals in a state of nature, we define 
environment as those conditions of climate and food that con- 
cern the life of the animal. Among farm animals the conditions 
of environment are somewhat changed or enlarged, and we are 
accustomed to think of it as the sum of all of those conditions 
that are influenced through association with man. The chief 
factors of environment through which man seeks to control or 
improve farm animals are those of climate, food, and care. The 
environment means the “‘ surroundings.” 
The climate and the kind of animals that exist in it are closely 
related. The characters that are most often affected are those 
that have to do with size and the external covering of the animal. 
The natural relation of climate to size is that animals inhabiting 
cold climates are usually small as compared with those of the 
same species inhabiting warm climates. Man modifies the 
natural effect of climate through the housing that he affords farm  
-P-A-G-E-104
  76 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
animals ; hence he can move animals from one climate to another 
without serious results. Many animals show ease of acclima- 
tization to wide changes of climate. 
Climate has a marked effect on the external coat of the animal. 
When farm animals are exposed to cold, damp weather, the hair 
becomes longer and thicker than if protected. This heavy 
coat is produced at the sacrifice of flesh. In some instances 
the exposure produces a double coat of hair, an upper one 
being long and wavy and an under one short, fine, and fur- 
like. The Galloway cattle furnish a good illustration. 
The food supply is of prime importance in effecting variation 
and improvement among farm animals. In general, full feeding 
increases size. No other conditions influence development to 
a greater extent than the food supply. Large breeds are devel- 
oped from small ones largely by increasing the food supply. 
In addition to the increase in size, there is also an increase in the 
constitutional vigor when the animal is well fed. Withholding 
the food supply not only arrests development but weakens the 
capacity for future development as well. Thus it is that ani- 
mals passing through such periods of arrested development 
may never attain the development which they otherwise would 
reach. In order to secure increased development—develop- 
ment of productive function—the animal must be supplied 
with more food than is required for the performance of the nor- 
mal function. Again, there is a correlation between the food 
supply and the kind of product. The Islands of Great Britain 
have developed more hign grades of flesh-producing animals 
than any other country, and we find nutritious pastures over 
almost all of that country. 
The care that farm animals receive will go a long way towards 
determining the extent of variation they are likely to undergo. 
Farm animals that are well cared for, that is, properly housed, 
fed, watered, groomed, exercised, and the like, cannot fail to 
respond to such treatment. Many a man has fallen short of

success in breeding by depending upon blood alone for improve- 
ment of his stock. He has forgotten that all of our improved 
breeds are the product of adequate nutrition combined with 
intelligent breeding, suitable environment, sufficient shelter, 
and kindly care. 
Crossing. — The uniting of dissimilar animals is another 
cause of variation. Up to the time of Bakewell, cross-breeding 
was one of the chief means by 
which improvement was sought. 
This was before the time of 
pedigree books, and crossing 
was made easy from the fact 
that no record of the breeding 
was kept. It was also observed 
that the uniting of two animals 
that were unrelated, or that 
had existed under different pe Fia.36.—Surrotk Mare “ Bawpsry

constitutional vigor andin many 
cases in greater prolificacy, and often individual improve- 
ments. The great difficulty came when they attempted to 
breed these cross-bred animals. The offspring of cross-bred 
animals varied widely, some were good, more poor, and no 
one could foretell which way the offspring would tend to de- 
velop. While crossing is a cause of much variation, the results 
are usually disappointing in theend. The fact must be recog- 
nized, however, that the abundant crossing practiced by the 
early British breeders gave to the animals a plasticity of con- 
formation that prepared them for quick improvement when 
subjected to the Bakewell method. 
SELECTION 
The purpose of selection is to modify the type to suit our 
purpose, to prevent as far as possible the production of unde- 
   
-P-A-G-E-106
  78 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
sirable individuals, and to encourage the production of those 
individuals that meet the demand. In choosing farm animals 
for breeding purposes, there are at least three factors to be taken 
into consideration: First, the perfection of the individual as a 
representative of its race or type, or the individual merit of the 
animal as a specimen; second, the capacity of the individual 
to reproduce itself or to show improvement, or the pedigree of 
the animal; and third, the suitability of the two individuals 
to be mated. 
Individual merit. — It is often a question as to whether we 
should pay more attention to the individual merit of the animal 
or to its pedigree. It cannot be said that they are equal, or that 
one is more important than the other. There are two general 
principles in this connection that should always be borne in 
mind: the offspring of an inferior individual with a good pedi. 
gree is very likely to possess merit; many of the offspring of a 
superior individual with a poor pedigree will, in all probability, 
be distinctly inferior in merit. In other words, no matter 
what the individual merits of an animal may be, unless he has 
inherited these qualities equally from his cncestors, we can- 
not expect him to transmit them with any degree of cer- 
tainty. 
Pedigree. — The capacity of the individual to reproduce itself 
or to show improvement depends much upon his ancestors; that 
is, upon his pedigree. Pedigree is a record of the ancestry 
of an animal; it furnishes, therefore, a guaranty of the purity 
of the stock. The book in which such records are kept is 
called a herd-book. The mere fact that the lineage of an animal 
is known, is a certain indication of the quality of the animal, 
but this fact does not indicate the capacity of the individual to 
reproduce itself. The knowledge of the individual quality of 
the animals making up a pedigree is an important factor. Char- 
acters will be transmitted in proportion to the degree with which 
they have become fixed in the parents. We are accustomed to
-P-A-G-E-107
  
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 7 
associate great length of pedigree with high breeding quality. 
Historical evidence goes to show that we place too high value 
on extreme length of pedigree. Many of our pure breeds that

The Hackney coach horse originated in England, in the counties of Suffolk, 
Norfolk,and York. This breed is noted particularly for style and high action. 
In height there is much variation. There are Hackney ponies under 14 
hands, Hackney cobs that are larger than the ponies, and Hackney coaches 
over 16 hands, the weight varying accordingly. Chestnut is the most 
popular color, although bays, blacks, browns, and other colors are of frequent 
occurrence. This is the most popular breed of coach horses when high-step- 
ping action is desired.

80 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
show a high tendency to reproduce their characteristics have 
secured these qualities from a comparatively short line of 
animals noted for their breeding qualities. It would be difficult 
to trace the actual influence of the parents back of the fourth 
or fifth parents, in a number of cases. It is the individuals 
making up the pedigree for the last four or five generations that 
are of great influence in giving any individual the power to trans- 
mit qualities; and if all of the individuals constituting the 
pedigree for these generations have the qualities that we rec- 
ognize as good, we may count upon the animals transmitting 
their qualities with such a degree of certainty that it makes 
little difference what the individuals were back of that point. 
Of late there has been much discussion as to the part 
each ancestor contributes in the total heritage. Galton was 
one of the first to answer this question. While he answered it 
with much hesitation, his suggestions received considerable 
support and have come to be knownas “ Galton’s Law of ancestral 
heredity.”” Galton set forth the idea that one-half of the full 
heritage comes from the parents; one-fourth from the grand- 
parents ; one-eighth from the great grandparents ; one-sixteenth 
from the great, great grandparents, and so on to infinity. 
This being true, an offspring will procure 3} of its full heritage 
from the five nearest generations of ancestors. 
In selection, the performance of the animal, when available, 
as it is in race horses and dairy cows, should also be considered. 
The record of performance affords very valuable information 
as to what the offspring will probably be like. When breeding 
dairy cows, if one unites two animals of low-producing strains, as 
shown by the records, his chance of procuring a high-producing 
result are not very great. On the other hand, if one unites 
two animals of high-producing strains, as shown by the records, 
his chance of procuring a high-producing offspring are very good, 
although not sure, as there may be a certain influence of the 
heritage from the very early ancestors whose records were not so
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 81 
good. There is no factor of more use than the record of per- 
formance, although some breeders push it to an extreme. If 
one wishes to increase the performance, he must select the indi- 
viduals upon their performance rather than on fancy. If ani- 
mals are selected, however, wholly by performance, without 
regard to form, we are likely to lose the best conformation. 
There is another reason for selecting animals with a pedigree 
and a record of performance, which is entirely a commercial 
one. Animals registered in a herd book and that have a rec- 
ord of performance back of them are more likely to reproduce 
themselves and will command a higher price in the market ; 
and there is always a good market for such stock, as the 
supply is limited. 
Mating. —In selecting animals, we must consider the suit- 
ability of the two animals to mate together. We have already 
seen that no two animals are alike, and since two animals are 
essential in the reproduction, the offspring can never be exactly 
like both parents. We must 
strike an average between the 
characteristics of the parents 
and what we expect to get in 
the offspring. As compared 
with its parents the offspring 
of two individuals will fall 
into one of the following three 
classes: First, a perfect com- 
bination of the qualities of 
both parents; this is called 
breeding true. Second, a pre- 
ponderance of characters of Tie $8. Hacer Sesion Shae either parent; this is called 
prepotency; and third, the offspring may exhibit none or few 
of the characters of either parent ; this is called reversion. 
When the offspring shows equal blending of the qualities of 
G 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  82 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
both parents, the mating is considered to be most successful. 
At the same time it is almost never fully attained. It is 
approached in proportion to the similarity of the parents. 
Uniformity of type and characteristics in a herd or flock is one 
of the very desirable things, for many reasons. The uniformity 
that is secured by reason of the equal degree of characters secured 
from each parent is the most desirable type of uniformity. 
More often the offspring will resemble one parent more than 
the other, and in this case one parent is said to be prepotent 
over the other. This resemblance will vary from a very slight 
preponderance of the characteristics of one parent, up to a great 
over-balance, amounting almost to a complete exclusion of the 
characteristics of the other parent. This question of prepo- 
tency is one of the most important having to do with selection, 
and one which will be further discussed in the chapters on 
breeding the various classes of farm animals. 
When the offspring shows no resemblance to either parent, 
but to some near ancestor, it is called atavism; if to some of the 
far removed ancestors it is called reversion. Examples are often 
seen: as, in the case of a pure Angus cow, which is naturally 
black, giving birth to a red calf; the case of Poland China 
swine, naturally black, occasionally possessing a sandy tint on 
the hair. 
Two animals to be suitable for mating must be alike in gen- 
eral physical characters. Otherwise the outcome of a union 
cannot be foretold. When the offspring shows good qualities, 
the mating of the parents is considered a fortunate nick. The 
history of farm animals is full of such nicks. The success or 
failure of a stock breeder very often depends on his ability to 
discover these nicks and to make use of them. Some breeders 
become very skilful in these matters, even though they may 
not be able to give reasons for their choice or to instruct 
others in the same methods. Very often these are untaught 
and unread men.
-P-A-G-E-111
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 83 
HEREDITY 
For our purpose, we will define heredity as the transmission 
or passing down of characters from parents to offspring. We 
have already noted two great forces underlying our breeding 
operations; like tending to beget like, which has to do with 
heredity ; the other the great run of variation through which 
improvement is sought in our farm animals. On heredity all 
successful breeding operations depend. We have just noted the 
kinds of variation, as well as the causes that lead to their 
appearance, and now come to the question whether and to what 
extent such variations are hereditary or transmissible to the 
offspring. 
The extent to which these variations are transmitted is a 
very important matter, because variations that are not re- 
tained are of no importance in breeding, though they may be 
of much consequence to the individual possessing them. If 
they are transmitted, they influence the race for good or bad, 
depending on whether desirable or undesirable. Practical men 
work on the supposition that these variations or so-called 
modified characters are transmitted. All recognize the neces- 
sity of the highest development of the individual for the specific 
purpose for which it is intended. If one is to breed the 
best kind of beef animals, he must unite animals of the best beef 
strains. If one is to breed the highest class of trotting horses, 
he must unite horses that can trot fast. If one is to 
produce cows yielding a high milk flow, he must unite animals 
with high records of performance. Working breeders are uni- 
versally of this opinion. All of our improved breeds of ani- 
mals are comparatively recent. It is difficult to see how we 
could have secured such development in so short a time, unless 
it came through the inheritance of modified characters. 
Inheritance of disease. — In all of the early writings on hered- 
ity, there is much discussion on the heredity of disease, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  84 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
nearly every disease has at one time been classed as transmis- 
sible. In a good many cases, diseases seem to pass from gen- 
eration to generation with regularity or even certainty and are 
often classed as hereditary diseases, whereas the facts are that 
such troubles are germ diseases and are due to infection. 
Again, there are diseases peculiar to certain conformations, 
such as a curb or a spavined hock on the horse. The peculiar 
conformation may be hereditary, and the animal contracts 
the disease because of the conformation, but the disease as 
such was not transmitted. The results are the same, but it is 
best to state it correctly. 
Prepotency is the power that one parent has over the other 
in determining the character of the offspring. It is usually 
considered from two points of view; first, “race” or “breed” 
prepotency, when all the individuals of the race or breed are 
possessed of such power in transmitting their characters; and 
second, ‘“‘individual’’ prepotency, when the individual possesses 
the power to transmit its own characters to the offspring to 
the exclusion of the other parent. 
Breed prepotency is clearly exhibited when two distinct 
breeds are crossed, as the offspring will more clearly resemble 
one breed than the other. Among cattle, the Galloways are 
noted for being prepotent in color and in the polled charac- 
ter, for when crossed upon other breeds, the offspring are 
nearly all black and hornless. The Herefords are prepotent in 
transmitting their white face to the offspring when crossed on 
other breeds. 
Individual prepotency is a very great factor in breed im- 
provement. Many of the modern breeds of farm animals owe 
their existetice to the individual characters of the animal that 
founded the line. Hambletonian 10 among trotting horses 
is an example. He sired horses who in turn sired animals of 
great speed, with the result that most of the Standard Bred 
horses trace either directly or indirectly to Hambletonian 10.
-P-A-G-E-113
  
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 85 
Again, the breed of American saddle horses owes much of its 
excellence to the individual prepotency of Denmark. The 
families of the various breeds of farm animals that owe their 
existence to the individual prepotency of the animal that founded 
them are almost without number, such as the St. Lambert 
family descended from Stoke Pogis, 1259, and the Eurotas family 
descended from Eurotas, 2454, among Jerseys; the Johanna 
family descended from Johanna, 1421, and the De Kol family 
descended from De Kol 2d, 734, among Holsteins; the Perfec- 
tion family descended from Chief Perfection, 32144, and the 
Corwin family descended from Tom Corwin 2d, 2037, among 
Poland China swine. 
Since prepotency is of so great importance in improvement 
among farm animals, those influences that tend to produce it 
in the individual are worthy of note. While many of the 
factors surrounding prepotency are not well understood, yet 
those that do aid and are under the control of man are: purity 
of breeding, strong constitutional development, and in-breeding. 
Purity of breeding strengthens prepotency in individual as well 
as in the breed or race. It strengthens prepotency because it 
makes for stability. The introduction of outside animals 
becomes a disturbing factor in the stability of the characters of 
the individual and therefore a disturbing factor in the cer- 
tainty of transmission. On the other hand, each generation of 
pure breeding adds to the stability of the type and to the cer- 
tainty of transmission. 
Vigor in the individual is a very important factor when 
selecting for prepotency. This is sometimes lost sight of, as 
in selecting hens for high egg production when nothing but 
production is considered, and always with serious results, for 
without vitality all else will fail. 
In-breeding aids prepotency, for it strengthens dominant 
characters. The more inbred the animals the more intense 
their power of transmission. This applies, however, to good
-P-A-G-E-114
  86 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and bad characters alike, and will be discussed in the para- 
graph on in-and-in breeding (p. 92). 
These three factors acting in conjunction, and when properly 
manipulated, give the highest degree of prepotency attainable, 
and all are under the control of the breeder. 
The prepotency of the male is given more consideration than 
of the female. This is due to the fact that it is more noticeable, 
as the sire is the parent of many more animals than the dam. 
A stallion may sire fifty or more foals in a year, whereas the 
dam can give birth to but one. This is a fortunate view of the 
matter, since improvement can be much more cheaply brought 
about through a good sire from the mere fact that he is 
represented in more progeny. 
Prolificacy or fecundity. — For our purpose we will assume 
that these terms have the same meaning, and that they refer 
to the fruitfulness or the number of young brought forth. 
This is a very important consideration in practical operations. 
Breeds vary widely in this respect, it being a characteristic of 
some to give birth to more than they can raise, whereas others 
are not so fruitful. Under “functional variation” (p. 73) we 
have noted the Angus cow Old Granny (No. 1 in Angus Herd 
Book). She produced twenty-five calves, the last one in the 
twenty-ninth year of her life. Old Fanny Cook, the English 
Thoroughbred mare, produced fifteen foals, giving birth to 
twins at twenty-two years of age. The Thoroughbred mare 
Pocahontas also produced fifteen living foals and lived to the 
old age of thirty-three years. In this connection it is interest- 
ing to note the number of performances some of the leading 
males of the various breeds have sired. Among Holstein cattle, 
the bull Hengerveld De Kol, 23,102, is the sire of ninety-eight 
daughters with advanced registry records; Paul Beets De Kol, 
22,235, of ninety-three ; and Lord Netherland De Kol, 22,187, of 
eighty-nine. The Jersey bull Exile of St. Lambert has ninety- 
four daughters in the Register of Merit. Among Standard

The French coach horse is a native of France. This breed is similar to the

one hundred. The importance of this high fertility, from a 
profitable point of view, need not be dwelt upon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  88 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
In these cases much depended upon the opportunity. The 
better the sire the better will be the class of dams offered and 
hence the better the offspring, all of which leads to further 
opportunities. Another fact in this connection well worth re- 
membering is that imported animals are seldom fertile until 
acclimated. In general, distance makes less difference than 
altitude, temperature, sunlight, and food supply. 
Sterility. — One of the breeders’ greatest difficulties is ste- 
rility among animals. The causes which lead to sterility are 
very many, some of which are well understood and are more 
or less preventable, while others are not so well understood 
and beyond control. If due to the male, then all the females 
put to him will be sterile, whereas if due to the female, she alone 
fails to breed. Some of the causes that can be easily controlled 
are as follows: confinement and lack of exercise; irregular 
supply of food and lack of uniformity in conditions; food lack- 
ing the proper nutrients or containing too much sugar; animals 
in too fat condition ; and in-and-in breeding, close breeding, ex- 
cessive breeding; and the like. Again, the tendency to sterility 
or lack of fertility is often hereditary. The Duchess family 
among Shorthorns affords a good example. This family was 
always known as ‘“‘shy breeders,” and this was considered one 
of its valuable attributes. The breeders. argued that this 
diminished the numbers and kept the price very high. The 
results were that this most excellent family of Shorthorns dis- 
appeared because of its infertility. 
Relative influence of parents. — No question in the bron 
of farm animals has given rise to more discussion than the 
influence that each parent exerts on the offspring. As one 
reviews the literature on the subject, he collects the following 
ideas: the male controls the external and the female the in- 
ternal organs of the offspring; the male controls the forward 
and upper parts of the body and the mental qualities of the 
offspring; that parent which has the stronger nervous and
-P-A-G-E-117
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 89 
sexual organization controls the characters of the offspring ; 
the female controls the characters because of her close asso- 
ciation with the offspring; and so on, almost without number. 
So far as is now known, the parents play an equal part in 
their control of the characters of the offspring. This, of course, 
is aside from the question of prepotency discussed above, and 
in which case either parent is likely to dominate over the 
other. In general, that parent possessed of the purer breeding 
and whose vnaracters are the most intensified and most stable, 
will control the characters of the offspring, be it male or 
female. 
SYSTEMS OF BREEDING 
The system of breeding to be employed will depend on 
the purpose of the breeder. In the breeding of farm animals 
the breeder has one of two objects in view, — the one herd im- 
provement, the other breed improvement. These purposes are 
separate and distinct. In herd improvement, the object is the 
betterment of the individual herd. It is perhaps the cheapest 
and most convenient of all forms of breeding and productive 
of the most rapid results. In breed improvement, the object 
is the betterment of the entire race. It is perhaps the most 
expensive, and calls for much intelligence on the part of the 
breeder as well as much patience and painstaking labor. 
Grading consists in mating unimproved farm animals with 
those more highly improved or with those that are purely 
bred. The pure-bred may be either sire or dam, but for eco- 
nomic reasons the sire is usually the pure-bred parent. This 
mode of breeding can be used only in herd improvement, and is 
the one to be recommended to the great mass of stockmen ; and 
if it could be generally adopted and followed, it would add 
millions to American agriculture. It is the safest for beginners 
even though they intend to engage in the business of breeding 
pure-bred animals, as it will bring out clearly the strong and 
weak points of the breed, and after becoming familiar with the
-P-A-G-E-118
  
  90 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
work they may undertake the breeding of pure-bred animals 
with much better prospects of success. 
The great advantage of grading is that it is cheap, particu- 
larly when accomplished with the male. For example, a 
pure-bred bull, ina herd of twenty-five cows, will make half- 
bloods of the entire crop of offspring, whereas if the grading 
was attempted in the other way, it would require twenty-five 
pure-bred cows and the calves would show no more improve- 
ment. Furthermore, if the improvement were accomplished with 
the cows, it would be in twenty-five lines, each with its shade 
of difference, and not in one line as would be the case were the 
grading done with the bull. This is a very important factor 
when we consider the value of uniformity among all classes of 
farm animals. i 
Crossing, as we have seea (p. 77), consists in mating two 
distinct breeds or families, and is a powerful means of inducing 
variability. Because of its strong tendency to produce varia- 
tion, crossing is very seldom em>loyed as a system of animal 
breeding. Attention is directed to *t in this connection because 
it is the mode employed in breeding mules, the offspring of a 
jack and mare. The reciprocal cross, or the stallion on the 
jennet, gives an offspring called hinny. It is interesting to 
note that the mule more nearly resembles the jack, having 
long ears, large head, no hairs in mane and tail, and very 
small feet, whereas the hinny resembles the stallion, having a 
rather small head, rather short ears, hairs in mane and tail, and 
large feet similar to the horse. 
While we have mules and hinnies of both sexes, they are 
sterile; that is, one cannot produce mules by mating a male 
with a female mule, nor will the mule breed with either the jack 
or stallion. The only way to produce a mule is to mate jack 
and mare. 
Line-breeding consists in mating animals representing a 
single line of descent. This system of breeding is used either in
-P-A-G-E-119
  
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 91 
herd improvement or in breed improvement. Few of the many 
breeds of farm animals, as well as few of the more noted strains 
of the various breeds, have been formed without more or less 
line-breeding. Experience has shown that it is not enough to 
confine selection to the limits of the breed, for all breeds are 
exceedingly variable, and for best results one must restrict his 
selection to those lines that most nearly approach the object 
sought. 
Line-breeding combines animals very similar in their charac- 
ter, narrows the pedigrees to few and closely related lines of 
descent, intensifies characters both good and bad, and thus gives 
stability to the strain or breed. It is a very strong factor in 
securing uniformity, and increasing the prepotency among farm 
animals. 
No method is equal to that of line-breeding for the improve- 
ment of farm animals. It is conservative and safe. It is free 
from many of the objections that attach to other methods. 
There are, however, two factors that must not be lost sight of : 
both good and bad characters 
alike are intensified, and the 
importance of the individual in 
selection is great. Formerly 
much was said against line- 
breeding, but since the time of 
Robert Bakewell it has been a 
recognized factor in live-stock 
improvement (p. 77).

will be intensified by this method of breeding just as rapidly as 
will desirable characters (p. 78). 
In-breeding consists in mating animals closely related. It is 
line-breeding carried to its limits, and consequently it intensifies 
all the advantages and disadvantages of that system of breeding. 
In-breeding has been used successfully in the improvement of 
practically all of the present breeds of farm animals. The sys- 
tem was first put into regular practice by Robert Bakewell, 
and since that time has been employed more or less by all 
successful breeders. 
The objects of in-breeding are twofold: First, more quickly 
to secure desirable characters in the offspring; and second, 
to render these characters more stable that they may be uni- 
formly transmitted. Thus a certain parent, for example, a sire, 
is found to possess an unusual degree of excellence in some 
particular which he transmits to the offspring. To retain the 
excellency this offspring, if a female, when of the proper age is 
mated with her own sire, and this product, if a female, is in turn 
mated to the same male that was her sire as well as her grand- 
sire. This method is resorted to for three and often four genera- 
tions with the view of intensifying and perpetuating a desirable 
character for which the sire is especially noted. 
There are three forms of in-breeding: First, mating sire with 
daughter, giving rise to an offspring containing three-fourths of 
the blood lines of the sire. This method, if followed up, pro- 
duces offspring with but one line of ancestry and eliminates the 
characters of the dam. It is practiced when it is desired to in- 
tensify the characters possessed by the sire. Second, mating son 
with dam, which gives rise to offspring containing three-fourths 
of the blood lines of the dam. This method is practiced when it 
is desired to intensify the characters of the dam. Third, mating 
brother with sister, a method which preserves the characters of 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
THE BREEDING OF ANIMALS, IN GENERAL 93 
both sire and dam. It is inferior to either of the other two in 
strengthening characters, and is not so safe because nothing is 
known of the breeding of either parent. 
There are many advantages that follow this system of breed- 
ing: it intensifies characters, gives stability to the family, 
increases the prepotency, and favors uniformity. In-breed- 
ing results in the highest possible percentage of the desired blood 
being retained in the offspring, and is therefore recognized as the 
strongest of all breeding. It also gives rise to the simplest 
form of pedigree. Since the infusion of new strains shatters 
existing characters, no system equals in-breeding for perpetu- 
ating characters, doubling up existing combinations, as well 
as retaining all there is of good in the exceptional individ- 
ual. Capable of producing the great improvement that it 
is, in-breeding is not without its disadvantages. It does not 
tespect characters; it does not separate the good from the bad, 
but intensifies both good and bad alike. In-breeding, if per- 
sisted in, results in loss of fertility as well as vigor, which may 
quickly lead to race extinction. These are two most common 
defects resulting from this method of breeding, and they come 
about naturally. Few animals are regular breeders, and a still 
fewer number are both vigorous and regular breeders. Hence, 
when such animals are in-bred, the tendency is still further to 
lower both the vitality and the fertility. When practicing 
this method, therefore, too much cannot be made of selecting 
for high fertility and much vigor. 
There are two situations under which it may be desirable to 
practice in-breeding. One is in grading, where, if we have a 
proved sire, one that is known to get excellent offspring, it may 
be entirely permissible to mate him with his own daughters 
rather than to procure a new sire, in which the breeding power 
is not known. Again, such an exchange of sires as would be 
necessary to prevent in-breeding often calls for a considerable 
outlay of time and money.  
-P-A-G-E-122
    94 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The other condition under which in-breeding is permissible 
is when one finds himself in possession of a very limited su- 
perior blood and is at a loss to know how to retain it. If he 
breeds out, the desirable characters will be obliterated. In this 
case, the only way he can retain the desirable characters is to

breed in. Often the risk is great, but it is the only way 
the desired blood can be retained. In such case it is best to 
strike out boldly and know the worst at once. Many breeders 
have found themselves in just such position and by in-breeding 
have not only retained the good characters but have increased

and intensified them by in-breeding, and in a few generations 
have succeeded in building up the best herds in the breed. 
Breeding from the best. — The advisability of breeding from 
the best depends on the situation. When one is grading, it is 
advisable to procure the very best obtainable. On the other 
hand, when one is building up a pure herd, it is equally import- 
ant to give due regard to the strain with which one is working. 
That is to say, in actual practice the breeder who breeds from 
the best without regard for blood lines is likely to bring to- 
gether a confused herd, out of which nothing of note can be 
established. Crossing family lines brings about much the same 
condition as crossing the breeds, only on a more limited scale. 
From this it must be apparent that if one is to secure the best 
results from any system of breeding whatsoever, he must have 
due regard for ancestral lines. He must keep the strains pure, 
intensify the desirable characters, thus increasing prepotency 
and securing uniformity. If the purpose is herd improvement, 
grading is practicable, as it is a cheap, quick, and conserva- 
tive method, and if persisted in for a few generations, develops 
animals about equal to pure breds for production. If the pur- 
pose is breed improvement, then line-breeding or even in- 
breeding will be found to be most effective, for by these 
methods the ancestral lines can be kept true.

  CHAPTER V 
THE BREEDING OF HORSES AND MULES 
WHILE we have no data available in the United States on the 
number of horses and mules consumed, or used up in a year, 
yet a very conservative estimate would be approximately two 
million, this to include export animals as well as those consumed 
at home. These horses must be replaced as consumed, or there 
will be a horse famine. There are approximately ten million 
mares in the United States, of which we will assume one-half, 
or five million, are of breeding age. If we are to raise these 
two million colts, both horse and mule, it means that at least 
one-half, or 50 per cent, of these mares should be bred each 
year. 
It must be remembered that the horses that supply this 
demand are produced on the farms. Their production is the 
work of the general farmer, who is primarily a grain raiser, a 
dairyman, or whose main business is general farming, and who 
raises horses because he is so situated as to be able to propa- 
gate them with but little inconvenience to his main work. 
Such farms usually possess three advantages: they grow large 
amounts of cheap food; they contain abundant range for the 
proper exercise of growing animals; and there is considerable 
team work to be done. On such farms horses can be grown 
with little extra labor and at a good profit. 
PLAN OF BREEDING 
A clearly defined plan of procedure should be thought out 
before the farmer makes the attempt to breed horses. To do
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE BREEDING OF HORSES 97 
this a good knowledge of horses and horse-breeding should be 
secured. Breeding establishments and horse-producing farms 
should be visited. One should familiarize himself with the 
methods of successful horse-breeders, should note the condi- 
tions that lead to success and those that cause failure. The 
    
Fig. 42.—‘Caroxina.” The American Saddler owned by John B. Castle- 
man, Louisville, Ky. 
The American saddle horse is a native of the United States, principally the 
states of Kentucky, Virginia, and Missouri. This breed is noted for its easy 
gaits, endurance, and intelligence. The weight varies from 900 to 1200 pounds 
and the height from 1514 to 16 hands. Saddlers are of two classes : (1) walk- 
trot-canter horse ; (2) the five-gaited horse ; walk, trot, canter, rack, and run- 
ning walk or fox trot or slow pace. 
intending horse-breeder should take account of his likes and 
dislikes. He may prefer the light active horse to the heavy 
phlegmatic drafter. The horse-producer should study his con- 
ditions. Some conditions will be favorable to the production 
of one class, some to another. It should be kept clearly in 
H
-P-A-G-E-126
98 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
mind, whatever the type or class chosen, whether it is light ot 
heavy, or for speed or draft, that none but superior horses will 
sell at remunerative prices. There will always be an over- 
production of common horses, which will be the first to be 
affected by oversupply and other business depressions, and the 
last to be revived. The market should also be studied. In 
some sections the demand will be for a certain class and in other 
sections another class will be in most demand. 
Coéperative breeding. — From observations made in localities 
where horses are bred in a commercial way, it would seem ad- 
visable to breed on the codperative plan. It is apparent that 
the formation of horse-breeding associations in townships and 
counties would do much to advance the progress of the industry. 
Such associations should be formed of breeders who possess the 
same class or breed of mares. It would be the work of such 
an association to protect the interests of its members, provide 
suitable stallions each year for use on the mares owned by the 
members, advertise stock, attract buyers, hold sales, make 
exhibits at the county, district, and state fairs, hold meetings 
for discussion of horse-breeding matters, and educate the far- 
mers of the locality to better methods of breeding, feeding, and 
developing marketable horses. 
Securing stallions. — The fact that mares are often bred to 
unsuitable stallions is, in many instances, due more to the diffi- 
culty of finding the right horse close at hand than to indiffer- 
ence or carelessness on the part of the breeder. A fitting start 
may be made in grading up in a certain district, and in a few 
years no horse of the same blood is to be found to continue the 
good work in the right direction. The consequence is that a 
horse of different breed, unsuitable in many respects, is used 
until a more suitable sire can be secured, or happens to enter 
the district. 
It often occurs that a stallion is unexpectedly thrust on a 
district by a salesman of some importing firm. A company is 
Sees same 
Pathe. AERO 4
-P-A-G-E-127
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 99 
formed for the purchase of the horse, and the price is usually 
high, as it must contain many and sometimes questionable ex- 
penses. The “company plan” of purchasing a stallion is 
therefore objectionable. It is much better for the farmers 
interested in horse-breeding to get together and choose one of 
their own members and send him to the importing stable or 
horse-breeding firm to purchase the stallion. He will have an 
opportunity to choose and will get one much cheaper. 
Undoubtedly, any reputable breeder or importer of horses 
would be glad to send into any district the horse desired by 
a company of farm-breeders and in close accord with their re- 
quirements as regards pedigree, character, quality, size, and 
price. It is equally likely that the same firm would be willing, 
for a certain consideration in price, to replace the stallion when 
he could no longer be used in that particular district. If such 
a plan were followed persistently, each district so acting would 
secure much better results than at present. 
SELECTING BREEDING STOCK 
In the selection of breeding stock, we must keep in mind the 
principle of heredity that “like produces like.” This applies 
to the brood mare as well as to the stallion. Bad qualities in 
the mare are as likely to appear in the colt as are bad qualities 
possessed by the stallion. The influence of the mare in the trans- 
mission of qualities to the foal is often very much underestimated, 
and frequently ignored entirely by horse-breeders. This can- 
not be other than a serious mistake, and the farmer who 
keeps worthless mares for breeding simply because he can- 
not sell them, will not be able to compete with his neighbor 
who keeps only the best brood mares, even though they both 
patronize the same stallion. The mare has as much influence 
on the colt as has the stallion. Once in a while we may get 
a very fine colt from an inferior mare, but such is very rarely

the case, and no man can afford to breed horses for this excep- 
tional case. 
It is a serious but common error in breeding horses to suppose 
that the bad points in one animal can be fully offset or overcome 
by the good points inthe mate. The statement that the stallion 
controls the outward characters and the mare the internal 
characters has led many breeders to think that the offspring 
would resemble the paternal parent irrespective of the mother. 
Such is not the case. The foundation of successful horse-breed- 
ing is to mate two animals each of which is as nearly perfect as 
possible. 
The breed and type-— Choose the breed which best suits the 
conditions, the markets, and the tastes of the breeders. There 
isno best breed or type for all conditions. Light horses naturally 
belong on land devoted to grass, to dairy industry, and to market- 
gardening, where but little plowing and other heavy horse work 
is required, and the necessity of reaching the market, the station, 
or the creamery requires quick-moving horses. 
On farms devoted to fruit-growing and the like, where the 
horse work is somewhat heavier than on the dairy farm, the 
coach horse may be used. Coach horses are well adapted to 
fruit farms with one exception — they are rather too tall to be 
used to best advantage in tilling under trees in the orchards. 
On grain farms, where there is much plowing and the work to 
be done is hard, heavy horses are needed. On general farms 
the draft horse finds his true place. Draft horses can be reared 
with less risk than the lighter and more active types, such as 
the roadster and the coachers. They do not require so much 
training, and can be put to light work younger. The draft horse 
is in great demand for city traffic. Again, the roadster and the 
coacher require much training before they can be marketed, if 
good values are to be secured. This training requires skill, 
time, and money, which should be taken into account. A well- 
bred and well-trained coach or driving team will bring a good

  THE BREEDING OF HORSES 101 
price, but the skill, time, and money required to breed and train 
hem is too great for the general farmer. 
Uniformity. — Each community should produce horses uni- 
form in type. As it is now, each district produces a number 
of types. For this reason, buyers in search of a particular type 
or breed of horse do not know where to find it, and buy, here and st

& Son, Lafayette, Ind. 
there throughout a wide territory and at a great outlay for 
traveling expenses, individual horses of the right type, until 
the lot has been gathered together. When each farmer in a 
district is breeding according to his individual ideas, he has to 
find a separate and individual market or buyer for his product, 
and the price paid is consequently small. Such districts may 
sell large numbers of horses annually, but they are of non- 
descript type and character. These horses neither make a name 
for the district as a horse-breeding center nor attract buyers 
willing to pay appreciative prices. The individual farmer will do 
better to cast in his lot with the majority of his neighbors, and 
breed the same type as they are breeding, even though this type
-P-A-G-E-130
  
102 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
may not be the one that suits his fancy best or even the one that 
is best suited to the district. 
Under the system suggested, the buyer of any particular type 
or breed should be able to go to a district noted for the produc- 
tion of the class of animal required and there find it in sufficient 
numbers, uniform in type and quality, to meet all needs. Could 
this be done, buyers would save much time and expense and 
would be ready and willing to pay better prices for the full supply 
of horses thus easily found. 
Soundness. — It is of great importance that the stallion should 
be free from all forms of unsoundness or disease that are heredi- 
tary, transmissible, or communicable to the offspring. It is 
equally important that the mares bred to him should be sound 
in the same way, for not until both mare and stallion used for 
breeding purposes are free from unsoundness can we hope to 
raise the excellence of our horses to the degree possible as the 
result of intelligent breeding and development. 
Many imported and home-bred stallions are unsound and 
transmit to their progeny the predisposition to like unsoundness. 
This is equally true of mares used for breeding purposes, as many 
breeders have fallen into the grievous way of considering any 
broken-down, halt, maimed, blind, or otherwise unsound mare 
fit for breeding purposes when no longer able to work. 
THE STALLION 
The stallion is of prime importance in horse-breeding. We 
have already seen that the male is concerned with many more 
individual offspring in a given season than the female and that 
his influence is much more extensive because of the increased 
number he influences. To secure the improvement in the horses 
of a given community through the females would require the 
use of fifty or more superior mares to accomplish the same result 
as might be secured by the use of a single stallion, and even then 
there would be less uniformity in the progeny. This has no
-P-A-G-E-131
  
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 108 
reference to the relative influence of the two parents over the 
offspring, but is simply because the stallion controls one-half 
the characters in the entire crop, whereas the mare controls but 
one. Often one has no choice of stallions when mating the mares 
because there is but one male in the vicinity, and this no doubt 
is responsible for much of the mixed breeding among our horse 
stock. On the other hand, usually there are several stallions 
available, and one must choose among them. While there are 
many things to be taken into account, the following are among 
the most important: individuality, type, soundness, and 
breeding. 
THE MARE 
The most fertile period in the mare’s life is usually at four to 
twelve years of age. In exceptional cases, this period may be 
extended both ways. Just how young it is safe to breed fillies 
or young mares is a question concerning which there is great 
difference of opinion. In some cases it is perfectly safe to 
breed a two-year-old filly, and in many cases it is far from safe 
and positively detrimental to both the young mare and her 
offspring. 
The advisability of breeding a two-year-old filly depends on 
at least three important factors: First, the breed. Horses 
of draft breeding mature much earlier than the lighter and 
more active breeds, so that a draft filly at two years old is 
often as forward as a trotting or running filly at three years 
of age. Second, the individual animal. There is consider- 
able difference in the way mares mature. Usually a. smoothly 
turned, neat, and well-finished filly makes its growth earlier 
than a rougher, more vigorous individual. Again, the feed 
and care have much to do with the early maturity of the filly. 
One that is kept growing continuously will mature earlier than 
one imperfectly cared for and which receives a set back each 
winter. Third, the object sought. Is the question to improve  
-P-A-G-E-132
  104 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the strain of horses with which one is breeding, or only to 
market the greatest possible number of animals? If the ob- 
ject is to improve the strain, one should never attempt to breed 
a two-year-old filly. 
The practice in certain draft-horse producing countries, Great 
Britain for example, is to breed the draft fillies the spring they 
are two years old and allow them no work whatever that season. 
After weaning their foals, they are taken as three-year-olds and 
put to work, and not bred again until they are four years old. 
This system is worthy of adoption when one wishes to know 
the breeding qualities of his mare as early as possible; otherwise 
there is no advantage, as one will secure just as many colts if he 
waits till the mare is three years old and then breeds her. 
When draft horses are wanted only for marketing, there is 
no reason why fillies cannot be bred at two years of age, provided 
they are mature, have been well grown, and their owner is 
willing to feed and care for them properly during their pregnancy. 
Nor is there any reason why they should not be bred each year 
thereafter. They should not, however, be put to work till over 
three years of age. 
At about twelve years, the productive powers of some draft 
mares will begin to wane, although many of them are reliable 
breeders to about fifteen years, especially if they have been bred 
continuously from their maturity. Above this age, it is rarely 
profitable to keep them for breeding. Perhaps it is best to 
dispose of draft brood mares at ten or twelve years old unless 
they are exceptionally good breeders, in which case they should 
be kept as long as they will breed. 
Season of the year to breed. — The natural time for foals to 
arrive is in the spring, and under ordinary conditions, especially 
on breeding farms, this is customary. However, on most farms 
the mare must do the season’s work in addition to raising the colt. 
This often necessitates breeding the mares so as to have the 
colts arrive in the fall. With good stables, abundance of food,

  106 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and the necessary help, there is no reason why mares should not 
be made to foal in the fall if it is more convenient to have them 
do so. In fact, if one is forced to choose between a spring foal 
with no chance properly to favor the mare and a fall foal which 
arrives and is suckled while the mare is laid by, the latter would 
be more desirable. During winter, however, both mare and 
foal will require more attention than if bred to foal in the spring. 
  Fig. 45.— A Cross-Brep Coacu anp American Trortinc Horse. A type 
used by the New York police. 
By fall foaling, the youngsters can be given a good start before 
they are set back by the short pastures and flies of midsummer. 
The mare is not so likely to breed in the fall and winter as in 
the spring. She is often thin in flesh after the summer’s work. 
But by increasing the food, especially the grain rations, by 
regular and moderate exercise, and by blanketing, the desired 
results can often be brought about. The bowels should be 
kept free from constipation by feeding moderate amounts of 
succulent foods.
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE BREEDING OF HORSES 107 
Breeders of race and show horses take every advantage of the 
age limit, and therefore favor early foaling. There are also un- 
questionable benefits to be derived from the life in the open, and 
the new grass, to commend springtime for foaling, but the 
prejudice against fall colts is not altogether warranted, and cir- 
cumstances may be such as to make it most advantageous. 
According to the table (p. 108), a mare bred on January 1 
should foal on December 6; one bred on March 27 should foal 
on March 1 the following year. 
When mares should be tried. — There is great diversity of 
opinion as to when and how often a mare should be tried after 
she has been served by the stallion. It can be accepted as a 
general rule that if the mare is perfectly normal and healthy, 
she will conceive. If she is not normal or is unhealthy, she 
either will not conceive at all or only occasionally at best, and 
even then there is likely to be difficulty. We should see to it 
that her organs are perfectly normal and that she is in good 
health. We should not change her diet or her mode of life so 
suddenly as to upset her general health. 
Some mares are shy breeders. If a mare is unwilling and it 
is desired to breed her, she can occasionally be brought about 
by hobbling her securely and then breeding her. Then she 
will behave more or less peaceably for eighteen to twenty-one 
days, when she may be bred again. There are other mares, and 
they are numerous, that will freely be served when they are in 
foal, in some cases almost up to the time of foaling. 
A mare will almost invariably breed on the ninth day, or 
thereabouts, after foaling, and if she is healthy and has received 
no injuries in giving birth, it is the practice to breed her at this 
time. Just when mares should be returned to. see whether 
they have conceived is a much discussed question. Mares differ 
greatly in the recurrence of their periods. It is best for each 
breeder to study the individual differences among his mares. 
The common practice is to return them fourteen to eighteen

days after the first service, and to return them each week there- 
after for at least one month: 
Barrenness in mares. — It often happens that mares are 
served normally, yet fail to conceive. Some of the causes of this 
difficulty are readily 
understood and eas- 
ily prevented, while 
others are not so 
well known and are 
perhaps beyond the 
control of breeders. 
Mares that are not 
served till late in 
life are often diffi- 
cult to impregnate 
at the first time. 
This is often noticed 
in mares that have 
spent a good part of 
a lifetime at hard 
work. In such cases 
it is due perhaps to 
the long inactivity 
of the generative organs. An excess of rich and stimulating foods 
is a common cause of non-breeding; and the dangers attend- 
ing parturition are more than trebled in the case of fat animals. 
Milk-fever never occurs in mares that are kept actually at work 
and are in only moderate flesh at the time of foaling. On the 
other hand, barrenness may be due to poor feeding and hard 
work, the system being weakened by the lack of sufficient 
nutrition. Undue sexual excitement at the most active stage 
of heat is often responsible for the mare not conceiving. In 
addition to these, there is a long line of causes of barrenness in 
mares over which the breeder has little or no control, such as

derangement of the female organs, diseased ovaries, tumors, and 
the like. 
Abortion in mares. — Abortion is the expulsion of the fetus 
at any period from the date of impregnation until the foal can 
survive out of the womb. It is produced by any cause operating 
to disconnect the union of the fetal membrane from the uterus. 
The mare may abort by reason of almost any cause that very 
generally disturbs her system, as the influence of too stimulating 
diet or the reverse, wet seasons, a previous miscarriage, and 
all circumstances opposed to efficient nutrition and respiration. 
The more direct mechanical causes are falls, blows, violent 
exertion, severe illness, large draughts of cold water or eating 
iced grass, ergot of rye, the smut of corn or other grain, and 
drinking filthy stagnant water ; also, traveling on heavy muddy 
roads, soft plowed ground, or jumping over fences, ditches, and 
the like. 
The prevention of abortion is the avoidance of all causes which 
may have a tendency to produce it. When abortion has once 
occurred, the greatest care in subsequent management is neces- 
sary. The breeder must avoid all causes of constipation, 
diarrhea, indigestion, and the like. When all measures fail and 
miscarriage results, all that can be done is to assist in the removal 
of the fetus and its membranes as in ordinary parturitions. 
The mare should have extra care at this time. She should have 
a roomy, well-lighted stall, with plenty of air and easily digested 
food. The mare should not be served again for a month or 
longer, and in no case till after all discharges from the vulva 
have ceased. 
Parturition time. — The average period of gestation in the 
mare is popularly placed at eleven months, more accurately 
perhaps three hundred and forty days, but it may vary greatly. 
(See page 108.) Because of the uncertainty of the period, themare 
should be closely watched from the tenth month till parturition. 
There are certain signs of the near approach of parturition that
-P-A-G-E-139
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 111 
rarely fail. The udder often becomes greatly distended some 
time before foaling, but the teats seldom fill out full and plump 
to the end more than two or three days before the foal is born. 
About one week or ten days before foaling, there is a marked 
shrinking or falling away of the muscular parts at the top of the 
buttocks back of the hips. Another sign is the appearance of 
the wax on the ends of the teats. This generally appears not 
earlier than three days before the foal comes. In some cases, 
however, the foal may be born without any of these signs. 
  Fic. 47.—A Farm Group or French Drarr Horsns. This breed was 
developed in France and is similar to the Percheron. 
About the three hundred and thirtieth day, or when the mare 
begins to show signs, the work should be much lightened and 
the grain ration reduced, although for best results the mare 
should be kept at light work up to the day of foaling. Bran 
mash will prove very beneficial now, as it will keep the bowels 
in good condition and allay any tendency to feverishness. She 
should have a roomy, well-lighted, and ventilated box stall, 
thoroughly clean and freshly bedded. 
If birth is easy and normal, let both mare and foal alone. 
They will come through the ordeal all right. It may be neces- 
sary that a caretaker be near by at night to render assistance if
-P-A-G-E-140
  112 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
need be, but the mare must not know of his presence. Most 
mares will not give birth to their young in the presence of per- 
sons if they can help it. 
If the mare shows after a reasonable time that she cannot de- 
liver the foal, or if examination discloses that there is an ab- 
normal presentation (normally the fore feet appear first, then 
the nose), a veterinarian should be summoned at once. Do 
not wait too long, for her strength rapidly fails. Difficult par- 
turition among horses is much more likely to result fatally 
to the offspring than among cattle, sheep, or swine. 
The mare and the young foal. — After foaling, if all is normal, 
the mare will usually get up and tend to her foal. After she is 
on her feet, offer her a drink of gruel made from a pound of fine 
oat meal in half a bucket of water from which the chill has been 
taken. While the mare should be lightly worked up to the day 
of foaling, it is essential that she have a few days’ rest after foal- 
ing; how long will depend on the condition of the mare and 
foal, and the financial circumstances of the breeder. Strong 
mares that have come through satisfactorily will be able to 
do light work in three or four days if need be, whereas others 
will need at least two weeks to recover from the shock. 
Two things require attention at this time so far as the mare 
is concerned: she must be properly nourished, not fed too 
much or too little and with the right sort of food; if able, 
she must have light exercise or the foal will suffer. 
The foods given the brood mare when nursing her foal should 
be such.as have a tendency to produce milk. Corn and timothy 
hay fed alone are not good milk-producing foods. Foods rich 
in protein and ash, such as oats, bran, clover, and alfalfa hay, 
are preferred, and they could be improved by the addition 
of a succulent food such as carrots. Many mares are poor 
milk-producers at best, and they must be encouraged. Plenty 
of good fresh grass is one of the best aids to healthy and abun- 
dant nutrition for both mare and foal.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 113 
One should keep close watch on the mare’s udder and the 
condition of the colt’s bowels. If the colt is not taking all the 
milk, the udder will be greatly distended, become sore, and 
possibly cake, when there will be difficulty with both mare and 
foal. Itis then necessary to milk the mare. If the bowels of 
the colt are loose and he is scouring, it may be due to the fact 
that he is getting too much milk. In that case, the mare 
should be partly milked by hand. 
THE FOAL 
It is essential that the new-born foal get the first milk from 
the dam. This fore-milk looks thick and yellow and is a natural 
purgative for the removal of the material that has accumulated 
in the foal’s digestive tract during the last few days of its de- 
velopment. Its prompt removal is essential to the life of the 
colt. Sometimes this fore-milk, or colostrum, is drawn off as 
unfit for the colt, but such practice is a common cause of death 
to the foal two or three days after birth. 
The young foal that makes its appearance normally and is 
bright and active needs only to be let alone as long as both mare 
and foal are doing well. The infant foal will be better for it. 
By giving proper attention to the food and exercise of the mare, 
the foal may be kept thriving and in the pink of condition with- 
out any special care or attention. Not all foals, however, are 
so fortunate. Occasionally one loses its life through want of 
attention at the time of birth. Occasionally foals are troubled 
with digestive disorders that must be attended to and remedied 
at once before they prove fatal. Again, they are sometimes 
troubled with an infectious navel disease which may be due to 
unsanitary conditions at the time of foaling. 
It sometimes happens that the new-born foal cannot breathe 
— does not establish the function of respiration. In this case, 
steps must be taken quickly to establish respiration by blowing 
violently up the muzzle and into the mouth, and by briskly 
1
-P-A-G-E-142
  114 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
rubbing the body. If breathing is slow, a few tablespoonfuls 
of brandy and water, given after the first few respirations, will 
be of material service in invigorating the low vital process. 
As soon as the mare has recovered from the shock of giving 
birth, she should be allowed to tend the foal, for it will be phys-

ically benefited thereby. If she refuses to dry and caress it, 
a little flour sprinkled over the back of the foal will often attract 
her to it. Should she still refuse, the foal must be dried with a 
soft flannel, aided to find the teat, and assisted to obtain its 
first nourishment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 115 
Ills of the young foal. Constipation.— Notwithstanding the 
purgative effects of the colostrum or first flow of milk, the 
young foal frequently suffers from constipation, especially if 
the mare has not been in good health during the latter periods 
of pregnancy. Then again, the dam may have something 
wrong with her first milk, or the young foal through weakness 
may not get a good draft. Whatever the cause, if the digestive 
tract has not been cleaned of its contents within twenty-four 
hours and the foal presents a droopy, listless appearance, eyes 
not bright, ears lopped over, something must be done to stimu- 
late the action of the bowels. The bowels will ordinarily be 
stimulated actively by administering two ounces of olive oil 
or castor oil and an injection of warm water into the bowels. 
The water should be at blood heat and have added to it a little 
glycerine — a teaspoonful of glycerine and enough warm water 
to make two or three ounces, not more. Never try to fill the 
little foal with copious douches of soap-suds, as is often done. 
Plain cold water is better than soap-suds. Only a very little 
is needed. Inject gently into the rectum with a common two- 
ounce hard rubber syringe, taking care not to rupture the tender 
membrane. This will lubricate the passage and induce the foal 
to endeavor to pass the fecal matter, which is a yellowish, rather 
hard, waxy substance. If given as directed, the injection can 
do no harm, and it may be repeated every hour. In five 
hours, relief will usually have been gained and the appearance 
‘ of the youngster will have changed greatly for the better. 
Diarrhea or scours. — This disease is rather prevalent among 
suckling animals, and is often fatal. Although less subject to 
it than calves, foals often die from diarrhea within a short 
time after birth. The causes are not certainly known. It is 
ordinarily attributed to changes of an unknown character in the 
composition of the milk. Two facts, however, have been proved: 
First, that the causes of scours are many and varied; second, 
that their potency is increased by unclean surroundings, espe-  
-P-A-G-E-144
116 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
cially unwholesome stables. Apparent causes are the non: 
removal of the fecal matter; also anything that very materially 
affects the health or condition of the mare, such as becoming 
fretful when kept away from the colt for a time soon after partu- 
rition. The mare becomes feverish, the quality of her milk 
materially altered, and the foal coming to her hungry, gorges 
itself with this changed milk which induces indigestion and 
diarrhea. Very rich foods may stimulate the flow to such an 
extent that if the foal is permitted to take it all, digestive dis- 
orders and diarrhea will result. The same often happens in 
early spring when the mare is pasturing on a rank growth of 
succulent grass. Confinement in close buildings is objectionable 
to mare and foal alike. In both it induces a weakened condition, 
and leaves the system an easy prey to disease. A cold damp 
bed, exposure to cold rain storms, and the like are to be avoided. 
-A passing shower may do no harm, even if cold, but a prolonged 
exposure to rain with a low temperature is hard on a new-born 
foal and often leads to disorders of the digestive organs and fatal 
diarrhea. 
The best treatment is to avoid conditions likely to cause such 
disorders. If the dam is properly fed and exercised, there is 
very little danger. One should attend the foal at the first 
appearance of digestive disorders and remove the cause; even 
then it may be too late. If it is due to an oversupply of rich 
milk, the dam should be milked in part by hand. One should 
be cautioned against giving an astringent with a view to cutting 
off the discharge. The best policy in all such cases is to expel 
the disturber with a laxative, such as two ounces of castor oil, 
and later when the irritant has been expelled, to check the dis- 
charge by a weak solution of gum arabic, of slippery elm, or by 
well-boiled linseed tea or starch, or the like. But even this road 
is beset by many a difficulty. 
Navel infection.— Another disease common to young foals 
is the so-called navel infection, or joint disease. It should be 
     
-P-A-G-E-145
  
  THE BREEDING OF HORSES 117 
understood that this disease is due to filth germs that gain access 
to the body of the foal by way of the open umbilical vein of the 
navel at birth. When these germs enter, they set up irritation 
and inflammation; pus forms and is absorbed into the circula- 
tion from the navel abscess, and other abscesses are formed 
in all parts of the body, notably in the joints. The foal is 
seen to have a swollen joint and one is likely to think the mare 
caused the injury ; but soon other joints will be affected, and it 
may extend to the throat and poll. It is comparatively rare 
that an infected colt can be saved after the disease has reached 
the pus-forming stage.

Shetland team of stallions. 
The Shetland Pony, a native of the Shetland Islands, is the smallest breed of 
domesticated ponies. In height they range from 36 to 44 inches. They 
are built like miniature draft horses, being thick-set and strong, and 
so very docile as to require hardly any training. These ponies are com- 
mon in the United States, where they are used for children to drive. 
It has been proved that simple hygienic measures will prevent 
the disease. The stall in which the mare foals should have 
every bit of old bedding, litter, anc dirt removed, and the young 
foal should be born only on clean fresh bedding. Perhaps it 
would be safer to wash the stump of the umbilical cord, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  118 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
should never be cut but allowed to break of its own accord, with 
a saturated solution of boracic acid and then dust it with boracic 
acid powder. 
Feeding the young foal. —It often happens that the milk of 
the mare is insufficient to promote healthy, vigorous growth in 
the foal, and occasionally it becomes necessary to raise a foal 
entirely independent of the dam. In such cases the best addi- 
tion or substitute for the milk of the mare is that of the cow. 
The milk of the mare has more sugar and less fat than the milk 
of the cow. One should get milk from as fresh a cow as possible, 
and the poorer in fat the better, as mare’s milk will average only 
about 1.2 per cent fat, while the milk of most cows runs above 
3 per cent. Do not use Jersey milk for colts, as it is too rich in 
fat. 
A little patient effort will soon teach the colt to drink milk 
readily, but one must be careful not to give it too much at first. 
A half pint is enough for a foal two or three days old, but the 
ration should be repeated often. If it is necessary to feed the 
foal cow’s milk from the beginning, the milk should be modified. 
To a dessert-spoonful of white granulated sugar add enough 
warm water to dissolveit. Then add three tablespoonfuls of lime 
water and enough milk to make a pint. Warm the mixture to 
blood heat. Let the foal have a half teacupful every hour at 
first. This takes time, but must be done. If the colt scours, 
give a dose of two ounces of castor oil and discontinue the feed 
for two hours. As the colt grows older, the amount of food 
should be increased and the frequency of feeding decreased, 
first to twelve, then to nine, six, and lastly four times a day. 
The purpose is to give the foal all it will drink, and to feed so 
often that it will not require much at a time. 
Gruels, made by boiling beans or peas and removing the skins 
by pressing the pulp through a sieve, or oil meal and shorts 
made into a jelly by boiling, are excellent for the motherless 
colt.
-P-A-G-E-147
  
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 119 
As soon as the foal is old enough, it should be encouraged to 
nibble at grain, preferably ground oats. It will begin to munch 
in the grain and hay at three or four weeks of age, and should be 
encouraged to eat. It will eat only a very little at first. If it 
is necessary that the foal have milk after it is two months old, 
skimmed milk should be substituted for fresh cow’s milk. 
Never feed a colt sour milk. Never feed milk from unclean 
vessels. Should there be any trouble from constipation, it 
will be well to add about one-half pint of oil meal per day to the 
ration. Oil meal can be fed with profit to growing colts, as it 
furnishes a large proportion of muscle-forming and bone-form- 
ing food. The effect of such a ration — sweet skimmed milk, 
ground oats, and oil meal — on the growth and development 
of a foal is remarkable, and in all cases when the foal is likely 
to enter winter in low flesh such a ration cannot be too highly 
recommended. 
Many breeders advise leaving the colt in the stable while the 
mare is at work; others allow the colt to follow the mare into 
the field. Much depends on the kind of work that is to be done. 
Never let a colt drink from a warm mare ; allow her to cool off 
and perhaps draw some of the milk by hand, when she may be 
turned into the stall with the foal with perfect safety to both 
mare and foal. 
Weaning the foal. — Weaning is more a question of prepara- 
tion than of the absolute removal of the foal from the dam; and 
the simplicity of the weaning process depends on the thorough- 
ness of the preparation. If the foal has been accustomed to 
grain as suggested, if it has been permitted to take increasingly 
more as it grew, then the process will not be difficult, for as the 
ration increases-in amount of grain it will decrease in the amount 
of milk consumed. When the time arrives for complete separa- 
tion, there will be very little if any set back or disturbance to 
either foalordam. On the other hand, if the foal must learn to 
eat after being deprived of its accustomed source of supply, it
-P-A-G-E-148
  
120 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
will require time to get used to the new condition; and’the 
mare will demand special care because of the removal of 
the colt before her milk supply has been diminished to any 
extent. 
Foals are usually weaned at four to six months of age, depend- 
ing on conditions. Ifthe mare was bred soon after foaling and 
conceived, it is best to wean the foal early, so that the mare will 
have time to recuperate and nourish the fetus. If for any 
reason mare and foal are not doing well, it is perhaps best to 
wean comparatively early. If, on the other hand, the mare has 
a full flow of milk and her services are not needed, there is no 
reason for weaning the foal under six months of age. When 
dam and foal are separated, it is better for both that the separa- 
tion be complete. If, after both have become reconciled to the 
separation, they are permitted to see, hear, or smell each other 
again, all that has been gained is lost, and it will be necessary 
to begin over again. Care should also be taken to see that 
the new quarters where the weanlings are confined are so con- 
structed and arranged that they cannot injure themselves 
while fretting over the separation. 
At this time the food and the udder of the mare require extra 
attention. Work the mare right along if she has been at work, 
but reduce her grain ration till she is dried off. When the udder 
becomes so full as to cause her uneasiness, part of the milk 
should be drawn, but she should not be milked dry. If the milk 
is all withdrawn each time, it will take longer to dry her. 
Skimmed milk may still be given to the colt, especially if it 
is not in good condition to enter the winter. Clean, sound oats 
well ground constitute the best of all grains for the weanling. 
As cold weather approaches, one-fourth in weight of corn meal 
may be added, as it helps to produce fat and keeps up the animal 
heat. If to this a little oil meal, say a half pint a day, is added, 
the weanling will make good gains in spite of the cold weather 
and the fact that it has just been separated from its mother.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
THE BREEDING OF HORSES 121 
Do not be afraid of feeding too liberally. Many colts are per- 
manently injured the first six months after weaning by too 
scanty supply of food. 
BREEDING JACKS, JENNETS, AND MULES 
Because of the increasing importance of the mule, it seems 
desirable to point out some of the peculiarities connected with 
its breeding. In general, the same suggestions apply to horses, 
jacks, jennets, and mules, yet there are a few characteristic 
differences. 
Jacks and jennets. —In selecting breeding stock, choose those 
with long, thin, bony head and long, well-tapering ears, sitting 
gracefully on the head, and with large, flat, clean limbs, big feet 
deeply cupped. As to color, it should be a good black with dis- 
tinctly light points. Breadth in hips and pelvis is very essential, 
particularly in jennet. Many jennets are so deficient or narrowin 
the pelvis that they have great difficulty in giving birth to their 
offspring. In size they should be large and well proportioned. 
The action should be snappy and straight away. Perhaps the 
most important characters are color, size, action, and boniness. 
The jennet carries her foal somewhat longer than the mare, 
perhaps well up to twelve months. At foaling time the jennet 
must be closely watched. This is essential. When the colt is 
born, it sometimes has the membrane over its head and nostrils; 
if this is not torn and removed, it will smother the young foal. 
Usually, the navel cord is tough and does not give way or 
break. If it is pulsating after the colt is born, it should be tied 
with a silk or flax thread and then cut three or four inches from 
the navel. Never cut the navel before tieing. Jack colts are 
liable to have troutle with the navel; hence the importance of 
beingon hand when the colt is foaled. Again, foaling jennets are 
often troubled with sore, tender, and inflamed udders, due to 
the large amount of milk they contain. When such is the case, 
they will not allow the colt to suck, but kick and bite it, and

it will starve if not looked after properly. The jennet must 
be carefully milked and the udder bathed in warm salt water to 
relieve the inflammation. 
Some jennets give great quantities of milk. It is a good plan 
not to give much stimulating food before she is due to foal, and 
not have her too fat. Therefore, the food should be reduced 
for a short time just before and after foaling.

When it is desired to re-breed mares, we have stated that they 
should be mated about the seventh or ninth day after foaling, 
for should they fail to breed then, they are likely not to come 
in again while nursing the colt. On the other hand jennets 
breed much later, about the twelfth to fourteenth day, and if 
they fail to breed then, are not likely to mate while nursing.
-P-A-G-E-152
  124 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Jack colts should be cared for and weaned much as suggested 
for horses. Because of the length of jack colts’ limbs, they seem 
to be more liable to spring their fore legs when feeding on pas- 
ture than the horse colt. They are required to put too much 
weight on the fore legs to enable them to reach the grass, and 
there is a giving way in the joints; usually the knee springs in 
or out, but often the ankle gives way. Again when the dams are 
low, thus compelling the colt to stoop and suck, the fore limbs

are often cramped in such position as to increase their liability to 
injury. These difficulties are so serious that Knight gives the 
following advice: When short grazing is the cause of the trouble, 
put the colt in the stable and feed with suitable food; when 
caused by a low dam, the difficulty may be obviated by the colt 
being put in the stable and fed on modified cow’s milk, or milk 
from the dam. 
Mules and hinnies. — The mule is the product of a jack and

mare. A hinny is the product of a stallion mated to a jennet. 
The latter is seldom seen in this country. It resembles the 
mule. It is asserted, however, that the hinny takes more the 
characters of the horse, the head is neater and ears shorter 
than the mule, the hair in mane and tail heavier and the foot 
larger. The bray is like the horse. Hinnies are scarce because 
  Fia. 53.— A Parr or Premium Mcttes. Owned by C. F. Cook, Lexington, Ky. 
the stallion has an aversion to the jennet, and will not mate 
with her unless he has been reared with jennets. 
The jack is likewise peculiar in his habits. Jacks will not serve 
both mares and jennets. Nor will a jack serve a mare at all if 
reared along with a jennet. In the rearing of mule-breeding 
jacks, this is a factor of much importance and cannot be im- 
pressed too strongly. To mate with mares, in order to breed 
mules, a jack must be raised along with mare colts and 
not permitted to see or smell a jennet until well broken
-P-A-G-E-154
    126 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and trained to mate mares properly. If permitted to serve a 
jennet, he will not again serve a mare, and his usefulness as a 
mule breeder is at an end. 
It is best to have a stallion to tease the mare when a jack is 
to be used. Some mares are afraid of jacks and will not show 
signs to them, hence the importance of having a stallion as a 
teaser. After the mare is bred, her subsequent treatment 
should be the same as suggested for brood mares.

CHAPTER VI 
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 
Mucu attention has been given the feeding as well as the breed- 
ing of horses, yet each of these will fail wholly or in part to bring 
about the desired results unless animals thus fed and bred receive 
proper care and attention. Many a person has fallen short of 
success in breeding by depending on blood alone to improve the 
stock. He has forgotten that all of our improved breeds of 
horses are the product of adequate nutrition as well as intelli- 
gent breeding, suitable environment, sufficient shelter, and 
kindly care. To make a success with horses, one must be indus- 
trious, patient, and untiring. He must have a fidelity that is 
unswerving. He must have a genuine love for his work. 
GROOMING 
Nothing contributes so much to the beauty and the luster of 
the coat as grooming. As a consequence, the body receives 
much attention and the legs entirely too little, whereas the 
legs should receive the more attention. On arriving at the 
stable, if the animal’s legs are muddy, they should be roughly 
cleaned by using a half-worn common broom. The animal 
should then be placed in the stable, fed, unharnessed, given a 
thorough grooming, and blanketed. The legsshould not then be 
neglected, but be given a thorough and rapid brushing. Time 
spent in cleaning and rubbing the horse in the evening after the 
day’s work is done is worth much more than time thus spent 
in the morning. 
127
-P-A-G-E-156
    
128 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
If the animal is working in the mud, it is desirable that the hair 
be clipped from the limbs. It is then all the more important 
that they should be thoroughly cleaned and rubbed each even- 
ing after work. The hoofs should be examined and the cleft 
between the sole and the frog cleaned. 
Animals cared for in this way will pay for the extra care 
many times over inthe satisfaction in having the team come from 
the stable in the morning in the best of spirit, as indicated by the 
pleasing appearance, the snap and vigor with which they lift 
their feet, and by the complete absence of any stiffness in the 
joints. Again, animals whose limbs are thus cared for will re- 
main comparatively free from the many diseases to which the 
legs and feet are subject. This care will greatly increase an 
animal’s efficiency and prolong his usefulness. 
CARE OF THE HORSE’S TEETH. 
Occasionally a horse does not feed well, due to irregularities of 
his teeth. If the first, or milk teeth, are not looked after, they 
are likely to remain, causing the second, or permanent teeth, to 
grow in crooked. The young horse’s mouth should be closely 
watched and the persistent milk teeth removed with forceps. 
Again, it must be remembered that the upper jaw is somewhat 
wider than the lower, and as the teeth are not perfectly op- 
posed, a sharp edge is left unworn on the inside of the lower 
molars and on the outside of the upper, which may cut the 
tongue or cheeks. This condition can readily be felt by the 
hand, and the sharp edges when found should be filed down 
by a guarded rasp; otherwise the tongue and cheeks be- 
come sore, the food irritates them, and the horse will not feed 
well. 
CLIPPING 
'_Clipping consists in cutting the hair over the entire surface of 
the horse’s body. Several advantages are secured from clipping ;
-P-A-G-E-157
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 129 
it improves the appearance of the horse and makes his coat more 
easy to keep clean ; a clipped horse is less liable to take cold than 
a long-coated one because the evaporation is more rapid and the 
animal does not get sowarm ; the natural process of shedding the 
hair is a draft on the vitality of the animal, the appetite is dimin- 
ished and the horse runs down in flesh. Clipping accomplishes 
in a very short time what nature requires much time to do. 
From this it would seem that horses with long thick coats should 
be clipped. The long coat causes them to become warmer, they 
sweat more, and the coat holds the moisture, and then when 
permitted to stand, they are likely to catch cold. 
If horses are to be clipped twice each year, the operation 
should be performed the first time soon after the hair has grown 
out in the fall. When thus cared for, they become used to the 
change before cold weather, and there is some growth of hair 
before winter. The second clipping should be in early spring 
as soon as the weather begins to get warm and before the winter 
coat begins to shed. Horses thus treated will be much more 
easily kept in presentable condition, and if protected by blankets 
and properly groomed, will pay many times over for such extra 
care. ; 
When horses cannot be protected from the cold and wet, 
either in the stable or outside of it, they should not be clipped in 
the fall. Animals exposed to the weather grow a long coat for 
their own protection. 
BEDDING THE HORSE 
A horse at hard work needs rest at night, and much more 
rest is had when the animal is given a good liberal bed. The bed- 
ding should not be permitted to become foul, as this will not only. 
lessen the comfort of the animal but promote disease as well. Of 
bedding materials, straw leads the list, but when high in price, 
may be replaced by other materials, such as shavings from the 
planing mill, rejected parts of corn stalks, tan bark, leaves, and 
a : 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  130 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the like. Old straw is preferred to new, as it is dryer and more 
elastic. The more broken and bruised the straw the less its 
bulk and elasticity and the more of it needed. 
BLANKETS 
In cold climates the use of blankets is indispensable. The 
horse will prove more efficient and will endure much longer if 
reasonably protected against sudden changes in temperature, the 
cold rains, and heavy winds. 
Stable blanket. — The proper use of the stable blanket is of 
first importance. It is a common practice after the day’s work 
to hurry the horses into their stalls, unharness, blanket them at 
once, feed and leave them for the night; in the morning it is 
desired to get to work early, the horses are fed, the blankets re- 
moved, the animal’s body curried a very little, the harness is put 
on, and in a few minutes the horses are at work. Animals thus 
treated stiffen in the joints, develop leg and foot diseases, and soon 
become useless, and may be sold or traded as part payment on 
others to undergo the same treatment. 
The usefulness of a horse can be prolonged and his efficiency in- 
creased by proper blanketing and grooming. On arriving at the 
stable very warm and sweating, the horse should not be blank- 
eted until he has ceased to steam, nor should he be left in a draft 
If blanketed at once, little opportunity is given for him to dry 
off, the blanket will become damp, and the hair remain so all 
night. In case the blanket is not used until the animal has 
ceased to steam and is somewhat cooled, which will be in a 
quarter of an hour, the hair will be dry and smooth the following 
morning. Stable blankets may be dispensed with in the hot 
summer months if the flies are excluded by screens or by some 
other means. If blankets are used at this time, they should be 
of light material and kept clean. As soon as the nights begin to 
get cool, the blankets should be resumed, as an early use will 
arrest to a marked degree the growth of hair. This may obviate
-P-A-G-E-159
  
CARE. AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 131 
the necessity of clipping. In case the horse is clipped, he should 
be covered with an extra heavy blanket, or with two blankets, 
for a time. 
Outdoor blanket. — The use of the outdoor blanket is as im- 
portant as the use of the stable blanket. If the horse is allowed 
to stand outdoors, either for a short or for a long time, he should 
be well blanketed. If one is going to stop but a short time, the 
temptation is strong not to blanket the animal. The horse cools 
off rapidly and may chill, so that it is best to blanket if only for a 
moment. Again, in the spring when the weather is fair, one is 
likely to think that no ill will result from leaving the animal un- 
blanketed ; and yet he may chill as before. It is best, on stop- 
ping the animal, to see that he is well protected at all times. 
CARE OF THE FEET 
Because of the great importance of the foot it should be 
carefully cared for throughout the active career of the horse. 
Each evening after returning from work as well as in the morning 
before being sent out, the sole of the foot should be examined and 
all foreign materials removed. For this purpose a small hay 
hook with the point sharpened is excellent. It is very common 
to find foreign bodies, such as nails and stones, either driven into 
the wall or sole of the foot, or collected in the clefts along the 
frog, and it is very essential that they be removed if the hoof is 
to remain in healthy condition. 
Occasionally the hoofs have a tendency to dry out, thus be- 
coming hard and brittle. Such hoofs should be oiled with some 
good oil, as linseed or olive oil, or with hoof ointment, of which 
there are many kinds on the market. This will soften the wall 
of the hoof and make it less likely to crack or break. It often 
happens that a piece is worn or broken from the side of the hoof, 
which throws the weight of the body in such a way as to bring a 
strain upon the joints of the leg, which often causes deformity 
anddisease. Whensuch hreak occurs, the hoof should be leveled
-P-A-G-E-160
  132 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
with a rasp. When horses are closely confined in the stable, 
the hoofs grow out long, and if not trimmed, will deform the 
limb and make traveling difficult. 
The rate of growth of the hoof is of much importance, for we 
are often interested to know how long it will take a crack, such 
as quarter-crack, side-crack, or toe-crack, a cleft, or a calk to dis- 
appear. On the average, the hoof grows one-third of an inch 
a month. Hind hoofs grow faster than fore hoofs and unshod 
ones faster than shod. While influenced to some extent by work 
or exercise, grooming, moisture, and food, the time required for 
the horn to grow from the coronet to the ground varies in-propor- 
tion tothe distance of the coronet to the ground. The toe, there- 
fore, depending on its height, grows down in ten to thirteen 
months, the sides, six to eight, and the heel in three to five months. 
Shoeing. —The horse’s hoof wears off faster than it grows out, 
and it becomes sore. In order to prevent the hoof from wearing 
too rapidly the feet are shod. ‘While there are many reasons for 
applying shoes, the most important are as follows : — 
First, to prevent wearing away of the hoof in order that it 
may not get sore. Horses show need of shoeing first in the fore 
feet, and in some parts of the country only the fore feet are shod. 
For this purpose the light shoe is preferred. Second, to prevent 
slipping, as on ice or mud. — For this purpose, when the work is 
hard, one needs heavy shoes with large calks, but for easy work 
theymaybelighter. Inthis connection it must be borne in mind 
that a smooth-shod (shoes without calks) horse slips more on the 
ice than though he were bare-footed. There are several makes 
of shoes with removable calks. Third, horses are shod to 
modify their action. 
Of the many things to be considered in fitting a shoe perhaps 
the most important is to keep the foot perfectly level, thus pre- 
venting undue weight being thrown on one side, and other attend- 
ant injuries. The frog should be left.in its natural size and 
shape to serve as a cushion for the foot. Make the foot normal. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 133 
Then make the shoe fit the foot. In fitting a shoe, nothing will 
aid one as much as a careful examination of the wear of the old 
shoe. The shoe should be fitted cold or not so hot as to burn the 
sole when placed against it in fitting. In nailing the shoe to the 
foot, the nail holes should not be too near the edge of the sole, 
for in such case it is necessary to drive the nails too far up into 
the wall to make them hold. On the other hand, the nail holes 
should be well back, the nails small in size, and when driven, 
should be brought out well down on the hoof. If driven high, 
when the shoes are reset, or the animal reshod, the former nail 
holes are near the edge and serve to weaken the hoof and interfere 
with driving the new nails. After driving the nails, they are to be 
clinched in a small groove fitted for that purpose. Smooth with 
rasp, but never rasp the outside of the hoof as it will remove the 
natural protective covering. This natural covering should not 
be removed, as the hoof will absorb water in the wet season and 
dry out much more rapidly in the dry season. 
TRAINING THE COLT 
The colt should be taught subordination at the very start and 
not be allowed to become headstrong. The usefulness of the 
future horse will depend much on his courage and fearlessness, 
and it is to promote these that the coft should become familiar 
with man at as early an age as possible. If taken in time and 
properly handled, he need never know fear. A colt should never 
be frightened. Too many persons thoughtlessly try to make 
the young colt show off by doing something to startle it, by run- 
ning at it, throwing sticks, “shooing”’ it, and the like, which 
should never be done if a reliable animal is to be developed. 
Teach the colt useful lessons only. Because colts are bright and 
very susceptible to training, they are often taught tricks and al- 
lowed to become mischievous — to bite, rear, kick, or anything 
else that may seem “‘cute.”” These very things later become a 
“great annoyance and are very hard to overcome. One should not  
-P-A-G-E-162
  134 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS’ 
make the mistake of trying to teach the colt too much at a time; 
he should understand each lesson thoroughly before a second is 
attempted. On the other hand, colts should be worked con- 
tinuously day by day and not simply at the convenience of the 
trainer. The trainer should be gentle and firm at all times and 
go through with whatever is attempted. 
Training to the halter. — The foal should be taught very early 
the uses of the halter; first to lead, then to drive. But even 
before haltering the 
youngster may be 
taught to “stand 
over,’ to have his 
foot raised, to back, 
and the like. In 
handling the colt 
be careful about the 
ears, the back of the 
fore legs, and the 
flanks, as these are 
often very sensitive. 
Catch the colt by 
putting one hand 
under the neck and 
the other under the 
hams or around the 
buttocks (Fig. 54). 
Never catch a colt 
around the neck 
only — if this is done, the colt will go backwards and perhaps 
fall — but instead catch him around both ends, as described ; 
then if he attempts to go forward, press back with the hand 
under his neck, and if he attempts to go backwards, press for- 
ward with the hand that is around the buttocks. Colts caught 
in this way will let one walk up to them, whereas if they are 
  Fie, 54.— Meruop or carcuinc 4 YounG Foat.
-P-A-G-E-163
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 185 
caught around the neck, there may be difficulty in coming near 
them. 
When ready to halter the foal, choose a strong, well-fitting 
halter and not a new one that smells of a lot of things that are 
new to the colt, but one that has recently beenused. Care should 
be taken not to pull heavily on the nose-band at any time. 
Oceasionally deformed face lines and necks are caused by this 
means. It is not necessary to drag a colt by the halter in order to 
suggest to him that his business is to follow. As a matter of fact, 
the reverse effect is usual, and the harder a colt is pulled, the 
harder he holds back. If, on the contrary, he is coaxed along the 
accustomed route, as to the water trough and back, he will soon 
follow promptly. If he resents, however, other means must be 
tried. Secure a small rope, the size of a light clothes line, about 
ten feet long, tie a noose or fasten a ring on one end, place this 
gently over the colt’s back just in front of the hips with the noose 
or ring on the under side of the body, so that when the other end 
of the rope is run through the noose, the rope can be closely 
drawn around the flanks; pass the rope along under the body, 
then between the fore legs, then up through the ring in the halter. 
Hold the halter strap in one hand, the light rope in the other, pull 
gently in the halter strap, and as the colt begins to shake his head 
give the light rope a sharp pull and the colt will immediately step 
forward. Do not be in a hurry, but give the colt time to get 
used to the lesson. Soon he will follow wherever you lead. 
After the colt understands the uses of the halter and will lead, 
he may be taught to drive with'lines (Fig. 55). To do this 
successfully a surcingle properly adjusted is required. The sur- 
cingle must be provided with loops or rings on each side, placed 
well below the center of the body, the lines passed through these 
and fastened to the rings on either side of the halter; never use 
a bit in the mouth of a very young colt. Now the lines will 
pass the hind quarters low down, and thus prevent the colt from 
turning with his head towards the trainer. It is very
-P-A-G-E-164
  
136 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
important to keep the reins low in turning to make the guid- 
ing process easy. After a little, as the colt becomes accus- 
tomed to being driven, he can be touched up with the lines, 
guided to the right or left, but he should be stopped often to 
assure him he is doing well. 
Training to the uses of the bit. — It is best perhaps to train the 
horse to the uses of the bit when he is about two years of age. 
The manner in which the horse is educated to know and mind

to Drive. 
the bit will go far towards determining his usefulness. Inas- 
much as the conveyance of the master’s desire to the horse’s mind 
for execution is through the hands, reins, bit, and mouth, no 
progress can be made and none should be attempted until 
this means of communication has been well established. 
Importance of a good mouth. — No factor contributes so much 
to the pleasure, comfort, and safety of either rider or driver as a 
responsive mouth in a horse — one that always obeys promptly 
the slightest instruction from the master, A good mouth to a
-P-A-G-E-165
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 187 
large extent is natural to the horse. Tender and bad mouths 
usually result from improper handling. Bad mouths are very 
aggravating and often the cause of many other imperfections — 
tongue lolling, crossing the jaws, hobbling, irregular and un- 
steady gaits, and the like —many of which when well established 
are very difficult to overcome. 
Bitting the colt.— The young animal can usually be made 
familiar with the uses of the bit by the application of the bitting 
  Fia. 56.— ARRANGEMENT OF “Bitrinc HARNESS’? TO FAMILIARIZE (HE CouT 
with THe Brr. 
harness or “dumb jockey.” This harness consists of an open 
bridle with a large smooth bit and check-rein, a surcingle and 
crupper, and two side-lines running from the bit to buckles on 
either side of the surcingle (Fig 56). The adjustment of the 
bridle is important. The length of the head-stall must be so
-P-A-G-E-166
138 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
adjusted as to bring the bit in mild contact with the bars of the 
mouth. If the head-stall is too short, the bars and the corners 
of the mouth soon become sore, and the animal may become 
vicious; on the other hand, if it is too long, the bit drops down 
in the mouth and the animal becomes careless. With the bit- 
ting harness properly adjusted, turn the colt into the familiar 
open paddock to get used to having the bit in his mouth. The 
check- and side-reins should be left slack at first. Gradually 
from day to day the reins should be shortened, care being taken 
that they are never made so short as to place the head in an un- 
comfortable position, or draw the b’t so tightly as to make the 
corners of the mouth sore. The colt should be subjected to the 
use of this apparatus for a few hours each day for perhaps a week 
or less, depending on the individual. Real lines may now be 
substituted for the side-reins and the colt driven until he knows 
how to guide this way and that; to stop at the word “whoa,” 
and to step forward at the command “get up.’”’ Train the colt 
to stand absolutely still when being harnessed, saddled, or 
when it is desired that he should stand. A horse that is con- 
tinually stepping about while one is working with him is but half 
trained at best. 
Harnessing the colt. — After the colt has become familiar with 
the bitting apparatus and has learned to obey simple commands 
he may be harnessed. Do not use new harness, smelling of 
things unfamiliar, but one that has been in constant use, pref- 
erably by a horse that the colt knows. After being driven with 
the bitting apparatus for a time and the colt is rather tired, put 
him in his stall, bring the collar to him, let him smell of it if he 
likes, then put it right on as if he were an old horse. Now get 
the harness, walk up to him, and lift it gently over his back. 
Do not stand off and throw the harness over his back, for the 
loose straps hitting his back and abdomen will be resented, and 
he may kick. Walk behind him, put the crupper strap on, then 
step to the side and fasten the bands.
-P-A-G-E-167
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 139 
The harness should be of good quality and in good repair ; if a 
part breaks, there may be trouble and the colt ruined for all time. 
See to it that it fits perfectly. The collar should receive atten- 
tion, as it is by means of this that the horse exerts his power. 
The colt’s shoulders are likely to be tender and easily abraded, 
and we must see that the collar fits him well. The collar must 
be kept scrupulously clean. When the colt is fleshy, we must 
watch to see that he does not lose flesh, and the collar, which 
fitted perfectly in the beginning, become too large. A breast- 
collar is admissible when the load is light ; it must not be ad- 
justed so high as to choke the horse nor so low as to interfere 
with the action of his limbs. The saddle and the crupper also 
need careful attention. Care should be taken to have them fit, 
neither too loose nor too tight, and then to keep them clean, lest 
they abrade the back or tail and produce a vicious horse. 
Hitching double. — With the harness properly adjusted, the colt 
is ready to be hitched to a vehicle. Get a well-trained, gentle, 
but active horse if the colt is active, for it is a mistake to hitch a 
quick, active colt with a slow, lazy horse. The vehicle to which 
they are attached should be provided with a good brake. The 
colt should be attached to the “‘off side” and the team be 
driven at first in a closed field till the colt learns what is wanted 
of him. When hitching the colt double for the first few times, it 
is well to keep a pair of single lines on the colt’s bridle which can 
be handled by an assistant. 
Hitching single. — When the colt is desired for single use, it is 
often advisable to train him to go single from the first. This 
may be done after he has become familiar with the bit, harness, 
and use of the lines. When training the colt to go single, a train- 
ing-cart — one with long shafts, substantially constructed, and 
the seat so arranged that the driver can get off and on quickly — 
should be employed. Such a cart can easily be constructed from 
the rear wheels and the axle of a buggy or carriage by fastening 
two long poles, — hickory or any tough, springy wood, — to the
-P-A-G-E-168
  140 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
axle, securing a cross-bar and whippletree in front, and a board 
seatintherear. Theshaftsshould be twelve or fourteen feet long, 
with provision at the ends for the attachment of a strap across 
from point to point to prevent the colt in rearing from throwing 
his front leg over the end of the shaft. At first a kick-strap at- 
tached to each shaft and passed over the colt’s rump should be 
used, at least till the colt is accustomed to the shafts (Fig. 57). 
When the colt is first hitched, an assistant should hold him until 
  Fig. 57.— Cour HITCHED FoR THE First Time, SHOWING ARRANGEMENT OF 
Kicx-Srrap over Rump. 
the driver is ready, then he should be allowed to go. As soon as 
he has become familiar with the vehicle he should be compelled 
to stand still until he is wanted to start. 
Training to mount. — In training a colt to mount, one must be 
very careful that the colt does not succeed in throwing the 
trainer, for if he once succeeds in getting the man off, one will 
never be able to convince him that he cannot do it again. The 
best time to take the colt is after he has been exercised vigorously 
and while tired. The best place is on soft. ground where he can 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 141 
hurt neither himself nor the rider. Put on the saddle in the same 
way as we did the harness; see that it is fastened securely. 
Have an assistant hold the colt’s head while you mount. The 
horse may rear, bound forward, buck, or liedown. In anyevent, 
the rider must stay on, remembering that the colt is already tired 
and on soft ground. It is often an endurance trial, and this is 
  Fig. 58.— ARRANGEMENT OF THE “‘DouBLE SaFETY”’ FOR CONTROLLING VICIOUS

When the horse strikes or rears, the trainer pulls the safety and the horse

the reason why one must have the colt tired to begin with, for 
otherwise he may be able to bound and buck till the rider is so 
exhausted that he can no longer hold to the saddle. 
HARNESS AND HARNESSING 
In harnessing the horse, much care should be exercised in prop- 
erly adjusting the various parts of the harness. Properly fitted 
harness adds much to the efficiency and comfort of the horse. 
This is well emphasized by the sore mouth, shoulders, neck, back, 
and tail produced by poorly fitted harness. The tension on 
these parts is rather great, and as they are very tender they are 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  
142 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the places likely first to show abrasion. Sores thus produced 
give the horse much pain and are likely to become a cause of 
viciousness. Sore mouth thus often provokes a horse to run 
away; sore shoulders and neck often provoke balking ; and sore 
tail often provokes kicking. Since the efficiency and comfort of 
the horse depend so largely on the adjustment of the bit, lines, 
collar, saddle, and crupper, it seems desirable to discuss each of 
these separately. 
The bit and the bridle. — When one recalls the extreme tender- 
ness of the mouth, the cruel manner in which it is often bitted, 
the irritation from the sores, he can understand why a horse may 
lag behind till the parts become numbed, then begin to pull, 
holding the head to one side, going with mouth open, lolling the 
tongue, slobbering, tossing the head, crossing the jaws, and 
in many other ways showing evidence of the discomfort he is 
suffering. 
The bit. — Bits of many types have been devised to meet the 
various and peculiar habits of horses, most of which have been 
designed to punish the horse and irritate the sensitive parts. 
With the punishment of the whip at the rear and a harsh and 
severe bit at the front the horse is between two goads, and if he 
does not balk, rear, plunge, or run away, he is exceptional. 
A good-sized straight bit covered with leather or rubber, if the 
mouth is tender, cannot be improved on in most cases. One 
must be careful to get a bit of the proper length for the horse’s 
mouth. Many bits are too long and are pulled out of adjust- 
ment in the mouth, so that the pressure on either side is not 
equal. The bit must be of the correct length for the particular 
animal, and properly adjusted. 
Some horses work better with the jointed or snaffle bit. It 
gives more room for the tongue, and the pressure is more evenly 
distributed on the jaws than with the straight bit. Severe bits, 
of which there are many in the market, and which are intended 
for punishment, should never be used unless it is absolutely
-P-A-G-E-171
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 143 
necessary. Such bits in the hands of a novice are responsible 
for much of the viciousness of horses. The tendency of the 
nervous horse to loll his tongue can often be cured by the use 
of the “‘tongue-lolling bit.” This is a straight-bar bit with 
a plate fastened on the bar, and is just as easy in the horse’s 
mouth as the plain straight-bar bit except for the annoyance of 
the plate. : 
In the training and driving of high-acting horses the curb-bit 
may be used. A horse properly bitted with this shows himself 
to better advantage than with any other kind of bit. The curb- 
bit should be used only by those who are familiar with it, as it 
may become an instrument of torture in the hands of the in- 
experienced. 
The choice of the proper bit for each horse can be determined 
only by trial, and if several changes are necessary, one should not 
be discouraged. However, when it has been determined which 
bit best serves the purpose, no further change should be made. 
After becoming used to a certain kind of bit a horse does not take 
kindly to a change. It makes him uncomfortable and may in- 
terfere with his action. 
Head-stall. — The bridle should be so fitted to the horse’s 
head as to let the bit rest easily in the mouth. The head-stall 
should be neither too long nor too short. If it is too long, the bit 
drops so that the rings are drawn into the mouth. The horse 
becomes careless and unmindful of the driver’s wish. On the 
other hand, if the head-stall is too short, the bit is drawn up- 
wards into the angles of the mouth and becomes a constant 
source of annoyance to the animal and may produce a sore 
mouth. 
Blinds. — As to the advisability of using blinds on the bridles 
there is diversity of opinion. Some persons contend that they 
are of benefit to the horse, while others are just as certain that 
they are cruel. Here much depends upon the individuality of 
the animal. Some animals work better with them; some work 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  144 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
better without them. If the horse works better with blinds on 
the bridle, use them; if he works better with the open bridle, 
discontinue the blinds. If blinds are used, they should be firmly 
adjusted to the bridle so they cannot swing back and forth. 
Both should be of the same height on the horse’s head, as it is 
very unsightly as well as annoying to the horse to have one 
placed low and the other high on the face. 
Center-pieces, ear-bobs, and tassels. — It is said that such fix- 
tures add to the appearance of the turnout. While fashion and 
custom seem to demand a certain amount of unnecessary fixtures 
to worry and annoy the horse, the use of them cannot be too 
strongly condemned. 
The check-rein. — The check-rein should be properly adjusted. 
In common practice there are two methods of checking the horse’s 
head — by means of the side-rein and by the over-check rein. 
The former is used more often on work horses, the latter on driv- 
ing horses. The side-rein is used with and without check hooks 
at the throat-latch. This rein is not so effective in compelling 
the animal to hold his head up, but is much more comfortable to 
the horse and enables him to handle himself more efficiently. 
Horses checked with the side-rein are not so likely to stumble 
as those with the over-check rein, and will pull a much heavier 
load. This is because they have more liberty with the head, 
thereby enabling them to see the ground immediately in front 
and to lower the head and thus throw more power into the collar. 
The over-check rein was devised for trotting horses, but has 
become so popular that it is used almost exclusively for driving 
horses. Originally it was used on the track where the surface 
is as smooth as a floor, and was employed only for short periods. 
To-day it is used on roads of all sorts and for indefinite periods. 
There are many strong objections to its use if drawn too tightly, — 
as is the tendency. It holds the horse’s head in such position 
that he is unable to see the ground immediately in front of him, 
so that he is very likely to stumble. It also holds the head
-P-A-G-E-173
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 145 
in such a way that he cannot pull efficiently. This is particu- 
larly true in ascending a steep grade. The animal is unable to 
lower his head and hence can put little power into the collar. 
An animal that is stalled when thus reined can often pull the load 
if unreined or if the driver will ride him, thus bringing forward 
the center of gravity and enabling the animal to get a firmer hold 
on the ground and to put more power into the collar. The 
over-check rein is also very hard on the animal’s back and front 
limbs in descending a grade. Again, it holds the head and neck 
in such an unnatural position that they soon become numbed, 
and the horse is seen to toss his head from side to side and to 
take other characteristic attitudes in search of relief. 
The horse should always be reined mildly. Without the rein 
he is likely to become careless in his habits, shambling in his 
gait, and to yield to the temptation to eat grass when standing. 
When the animal lowers his head and neck the lines, collar, and 
breast-harness slip down and he is likely to become tangled in 
the harness and may get into difficulty. 
Fitting the collar. — The service of the horse is largely accom- 
plished by the shoulders, and it is of the utmost importance that 
the collar fit the neck and shoulders perfectly. Poorly fitted 
collars cause the horse much pain, result in sore necks and 
shoulders, and are a common cause of viciousness and bad habits. 
Because of the extreme importance of having a well-fitting collar, 
many makes have been put on the market, such as the leather, 
the sweeny, the half sweeny, the pneumatic, the steel, and the 
humane, each asserting superiority over the others (Fig. 59). 
Each has its advantages and disadvantages. No attempt is 
made here to favor any style or make; only general suggestions 
are given. 
Fitting the collar is a rather difficult task. It is so firm and 
stiff that usually it is impossible to buckle the harness tight 
enough to bring it to the shape of the animal’s neck, and the 
shoulders are therefore adjusted to the collar rather than the 
L
-P-A-G-E-174
  146 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
collar to the shoulders, with sore shoulders as the result. To 
avoid this soreness, it is necessary that the stiff collar be adjusted 
to the shoulders of the horse for which it is intended. To do this, 
take the poorly fitting collar, new or old, place it in three inches 
of water and let it remain over night. In the morning put the 
collar on the horse, and with hame-straps draw it snugly to the 
sides of the neck; be sure that the hame-straps are properly 
adjusted, then work the horse moderately through the day. 
After soaking in this way the collar will adjust itself to every 
inequality of the shoulder, and the horse will seldom be troubled 
with soreness. 
A0680 Fic. 59. — Types or Cottars: (1) common leather; (2) half sweeny; (3) steel; 
(4) pneumatic; (5) humane. 
Every horse should have his own collar. It should fit close 
to the neck along its entire width and should never be tight in 
some places and loose in others. The hame-straps should be 
properly adjusted at top and bottom to suit the shape of the 
horse’s neck. Be sure at all times that the lower hame-strap is 
buckled as tightly as the thickness of the neck will permit. Oc- 
casionally the careless driver fails to buckle the hames tightly, 
and when the horse is backed, the hames slip off the collar. This 
may not be noticed at the time, and the animal be compelled to 
pull the load with the hames resting on the shoulders. 
Adjusting the hame-tug. — The adjustment of the hame-tug is 
also an important matter and should receive the closest attention. 
If the draft is too low, the action of the shoulder while walking
-P-A-G-E-175
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 147 
gives too much back-and-forward motion to the collar, which 
is noticeable at the hame tops. This is likely to cause sore 
shoulders either at the points or at the top. If the draft is too 
high, the likelihood of injury will be equally great. There is a 
proper place for the draft, varying with the conformation of the 
horse. When the hame-tugs are at the proper place, there will 
be very little motion at the top of the hames as the horse walks. 
Again, the tugs should be so adjusted that they are both of the 
same length. Often careless drivers hitch one tug longer than 
the other, which is very hard on the horse, and a source of much 
extra exertion as well as sore shoulders. 
Breast harness. — For light driving, breast harness is admissible 
and is to be preferred for such light rigs as runabouts and buggies. 
In the adjustment of breast harness, care should be taken that 
the neck strap is not so long as to let the breast harness drop and 
interfere with the action of the fore limbs. On the other hand, 
the neck strap should not be so short as to draw the breast 
harness up and choke the animal. The breast harness is in- 
tended for light work only, and if the load is heavy, the horse 
may choke. This is particularly true in ascending a steep 
grade. Much care should be exercised in its use. 
Fitting the back-band and crupper. — Perhaps next in impor- 
tance to the bit and collaristhecrupper. If the back-band or the 
check-rein is too short and the crupper is drawn too tight against 
the tail, it is likely to cause soreness; since this is a very tender 
part, it may lessen the reliability of the horse. A horse with a 
sore tail is hard to manage. At any time he may get his tail over 
the line, become excited through fear that the abraded part will 
be injured, clamp his tail down on the line, and be difficult to 
control. If the back-band is too long and the crupper too loose, 
it is likely to result in the back-band, crupper, hip-straps, and 
breeching all slipping off to one side of the horse, with the result 
that the animal may become excited and difficult to manage. It 
is therefore necessary that the back-band and check-rein be so
-P-A-G-E-176
148 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
adjusted that the saddle is in the proper place on the back and 
the crupper fits snugly under the tail; then there will be no 
trouble from sore back or sore tail. 
Fly-nets. — The use of fly-nets often brings much comfort 
to working animals. Such horses should be provided with 
throat-latch cloths when the bot-flies are present, as these pests 
are very annoying, and the animals in fighting them will often 
become excited, with a consequent lessening of their usefulness. 
Whether to use fly-nets or fly-blankets may depend on con- 
ditions. The use of the fly-blanket is not advised by many per- 
sons, but there are conditions in which it proves very desirable, 
particularly on horses whose color is such as to fade on being 
exposed to the direct rays of the sun. The fly-blanket, while 
very efficient in retaining the color and keeping out the flies, is 
not so presentable and is much warmer than the open net. 
Leather fly-nets are the most presentable and the most desired by - 
horsemen. But fly-nets and fly-blankets are rather annoying to 
the teamster and are more or less expensive, for which reasons 
they are often discarded entirely. 
To do away with the use of fly-nets a number of “fly-! killer” 
preparations have been compounded. ‘These materials are ap- 
plied with a small sprayer, and to be effective must be used often. 
It is said that they ‘‘do not soil or injure the hair and, all things 
considered, are cheaper and more satisfactory outdoor fly pro- 
tectors than are blankets.” 
Caring for harness. — The proper care of the harness should 
receive much consideration, as care will increase the length of its 
usefulness and lessen the liability of its injuring the animal. It 
is very important that the bearing parts be kept scrupulously 
clean at all times. This applies particularly to the parts in con- 
stant contact with the animal, as the collar, saddte, and crupper. 
It is not possible to. prevent sore shoulders, sore back, and sore 
tail if these parts are permitted to become dirty, which they 
will, because of the sweat and dandruff. They must be carefully 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF HORSES 149 
watched and frequently cleaned. It is best to clean these parts 
each morning before harnessing the horses or, better still, 
immediately after removing the harness. 
Harness should be thoroughly cleaned and oiled at least once a 
year, preferably in the spring. This will cause it to retain its 
fiber and to last longer. While there are many ways of cleaning 
and oiling harness, the following is as#imple and effective as any: 
Take the harness apart and soak the parts in a wash-tub of luke- 
warm water containing a handful of washing soda. Let the 
harness soak for fifteen or twenty minutes, then scrub the parts 
on a board with an ordinary scrub-brush. When the leather 
is nearly dry, blacken with edge blackening, which can be ob- 
tained at any harness shop. Unless the harness is thus black- 
ened or lamp black put in the oil, it will turn red. When dry, 
take a cotton cloth and rub the harness thoroughly. Always 
rub straps with the grain. This lays down the fiber and gives 
a smooth edge. Take a quart of neatsfoot oil, add a small 
quantity of kerosene, mix and warm, then give the leather two 
coats, using the oil freely. Hang up to dry, taking care not to 
hang in the sun. When the oil is well dried, sponge with white 
castile soap and buckle the parts together. Harness treated in 
this way will neither turn red nor become gummy, and if often 
sponged with white castile soap, can be kept looking like new. 
A number of oils may be used if neatsfoot oil is not at hand, 
such as olive, codliver, or castor oil, all of which are considered 
good for harness. In case the edge blackening cannot be pro- 
cured, put enough lamp black in the oil at the time the kerosene 
is added to turn it black. The lampblack will prevent the 
leather from turning red. 
Harness room. — Another factor that must not be overlooked 
in the care of harness is the place where it is kept. It frequently 
happens that the harness is hung on hooks just back of the horse 
in the stable. There are at least two very strong objections to 
this practice. In the first place, gases escaping from the manure 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
150 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
are very destructive to the harness ; and in the second place, the 
harness is frequently knocked down under the animal’s feet and 
becomes soiled with manure. It is much better to have a har- 
ness room convenient to the horse stable where all harness can 
be kept. When it is kept in a separate room, it is much less 
difficult to keep in order. If one has a hanger for each horse’s 
harness and hangs it there each time, the work will be much 
lighter than otherwise. A well-kept harness room will pay for 
itself each year because of the ease with which the harness is 
kept in condition and the increased time that it will last.

CHAPTER VII 
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 
Tue horse is a robust animal and with proper care is easily 
kept in health. Like all other farm animals, however, he is 
subject to ills and accidents, many of which can be prevented if 
taken in time, while if they go unnoticed, may become serious and 
render the animal useless. Every one who owns a horse should 
know how to care for the simpler difficulties, and when to call for 
the advice ofa veterinarian. Thischapter will not take the place 
of a veterinarian; it may tell you when to callone. Nowthatwe 
are giving so much attention to feeding and breeding we should 
also give additional thought to the difficulties and ailments. 
The horse is subject to a very large number of ailments, 
some of which are simple and easily cared for, more of which are 
complicated and require skillful treatment. Little more than 
a catalogue of the more common ailments is given in the follow- 
ing pages; to discuss them fully would require a volume larger 
than this manual.' 
TREATING SICK HORSES 
Horses that are ailing should receive much care. In many 
cases good care is to be preferred to the use of medicine. In 
other cases rest is to be preferred to both. The aim is to hasten 
recovery from the ill effects of the ailment; and to be most 
efficient one must understand the horse thoroughly and be able 
1The reader may consult Mayo’s “ Diseases of Animals” for fuller 
popular description and treatment. 
151
-P-A-G-E-180
  
152 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
to supply his every need. He must be careful, painstaking, and 
patient. The first thing to be done is to look for the cause of the 
trouble, and if possible, to remove it. If the disease is con- 
tagious, the ailing animal should be put away from other 
animals equally susceptible to the disease. Whether contagious 
or otherwise, the quarters should be comfortable. Note care- 
fully the surroundings of the animal, the work it has been 
doing, the exercise, general care, food, water, and the source 
of infection if the disease is contagious. 
The food should receive much attention. When the horse 
can eat, a small quantity of easily digestible and nutritious food 
should be given. The food should not contain much bulk and 
should be rather laxative, as sickness often brings constipation. 
It should be as attractive as possible, as the appetite is usually 
poor and sometimes lacking. When it can be prevented, medi- 
cine should not be put in the food or water, unless tasteless and 
odorless, as the horse is likely to refuse the food when it is im- 
portant that he should have it. Natural foods, such as fresh 
grass, roots, bran mash, and milk, are to be preferred to prepared 
foods, though the use of patent stock foods may prove beneficial 
in certain minor ailments, when a tonic is valuable. The feed 
boxes should be kept clean, and if any food is left, it should be 
removed and not left until the next meal. 
In certain ailments, it is necessary to protect the horse against 
the cold or from drafts. This can be done by the use of blankets. 
To protect the limbs, bandages may be applied. The bandage 
should be made from strips of woolen cloth about three inches 
wide and five to eight feet long. Make it into a neat roll, then 
apply by beginning at the lower or smaller part of the limb 
and wind upwards. This requires considerable patience and 
skill, but after a few attempts it will stay in place. 
Tn those ailments in which the horse cannot stand, yet should 
remain in an upright position, a sling is used. A sling consists 
of a wide strip of stout canvas, placed under the animal and
-P-A-G-E-181
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 153 
supported from above by means of a chain and tackle, so that 
the weight of the animal may be taken off its limbs and still be 
kept in an upright position. It is rarely advisable to attempt to 
carry the entire weight of the horse. The sling should be so 
placed under the animal that he can settle into it of his own ac- 
cord. 
In other ailments, when the horse is unable to lie down for a 
considerable length of time, much relief may often be had by 
  
  Fic. 60.— A Poto Pony or Goop Form. 
arranging a “lean to.” This consists of supports so arranged 
that the horse can lean up against or settle down on them and 
“thus relieve his weight. The supports in a “lean to” are 
placed about the animal much like shafts, with the addition of 
a piece across in front for the chest, and another cross-bar 
behind for the haunches to rest upon. These supports should 
be covered with cloths or blankets. Animals are quick to
-P-A-G-E-182
  
154 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
take advantage of such supports and will get much relief by 
leaning against them. 
ADMINISTERING MEDICINE 
In giving medicine the rule should be to give only for a definite 
purpose. This rule must be strictly followed or more ill than 
good will result. While medicine may be given in many ways, 
we will discuss only a few of the more simple, such as drench- 
ing, hypodermic medication, external medication, and enemas 
(or injection into the rectum), and counter-irritants. 
Drenching. — A very convenient way to give medicine to the 
horse is by ‘‘ drenching.”” The medicines are first dissolved in 
water or other suitable liquid. Just enough liquid should be 
added thoroughly to dissolve the medicine, as more than this 
makes the drench bulky and isunnecessary. Insoluble medicine, 
if not irritant or corrosive, may be given simply suspended in the 
water. The bottle should be well shaken immediately before 
giving the drench. It should be clean, strong, and have 
a smooth long neck. The head of the horse should be slightly 
elevated. To do this, place a loop in the end of a rope and in- 
troduce this loop into the mouth just behind the upper front 
teeth, then place the free end over a beam and draw the head up, 
not too high, for in such cases the horses cannot swallow. Gradu- 
ally pour the medicine into the horse’s mouth at the corner. If 
the horse strangles, lower his head. 
Hypodermic medication. — Medicines are frequently given by 
the hypodermic syringe under the skin. In this method much 
smaller quantities of medicine are required to produce given 
effects than when given by the mouth, there is less liability to 
waste, and the action of the medicine is much more rapid and 
certain. The use of the hypodermic syringe, however, requires 
more skill, and one should understand it thoroughly before at- 
tempting to use it. The medicine should be sufficiently diluted, 
otherwise it will injure the tissue and cause severe pain. It must
-P-A-G-E-183
    
  155 
  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 
be free from sediment and germs. When all is ready, the syringe 
should be taken in the right hand; the skin in the region of the 
neck and shoulder is firmly grasped with the left, and with 
the right the needle is quickly pushed through in a slanting 
direction and the medicine injected into the loose tissue beneath 
the skin. In older animals or those with tough skin considerable 
force is required to push the needle through the skin. It is 
of greatest importance that the instrument be perfectly clean 
and sterile, otherwise infection may be introduced along with 
the medicine. 
External medication. — Medicine is often administered to the 
horse by applying to, or rubbing on, the skin, in the form of 
liniments, ointments, lotions, or salves. Applications are also 
made in the form of poultices and bathing. Liniments, of 
which there are many kinds, are solutions containing some irri- 
tating substance such as ammonia or turpentine. They should 
never be applied to fresh wounds or sores, but are useful in 
chronic cases of inflammation. Liniment is often mixed with oil 
and applied to the part by rubbing. Care should be taken not 
to apply too frequently or rub too hard, as it will blister the part. 
Ointments, of which there are many kinds available, are medi- 
cines mixed with waxy material and are used to soften, soothe, 
and heal inflamed parts. Blisters are ointments containing 
irritating substance, and are used to reduce inflammation. 
Lotions are medicines in solution and are used to soothe, cool, 
and heal. 
Poultices are soft, moist substances. ‘They should be applied 
hot, but should not remain long, as the tissues become soft and 
flabby. Poultices are applied to soften and soothe and are very 
useful to relieve severe inflammation. In old chronic sores they 
soften the tissues, arrest the irritation, and hasten recovery. 
They should be changed frequently; and a part should seldom be 
poulticed for more than forty-eight hours continuously. There 
are many substances used in making poultices, chief of which are    
  
-P-A-G-E-184
  156 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
flaxseed meal, bran, bread and milk, and mashed boiled turnips. 
Whatever the substance, it should be clean, soft, and capable of 
retaining heat and moisture. To keep them clean and sweet, 
add a teaspoonful of carbolic acid to a pint of poultice. 
Bathing the parts in hot or cold water often proves very bene- 
ficial. The application should continue for fifteen minutes to 
half an hour. When warmed, it may be as hot as can be com- 
fortably borne. The bathing should take place two or three 
times a day. It is much used and with good results in lessen- 
ing inflammation, pain, and swelling of recent injuries, and the 
like. 
Enemas, or injections, into the rectum. — Medicines are given 
by injections into the rectum when they cannot be given by the 
mouth; when they are not retained by the stomach; when it 
is desired to empty the bowels; to destroy small worms infecting 
the large bowels ; and to stimulate action. Foods may also be 
given in this way. Six to eight quarts of warm water is suffi- 
cient for an adult horse, and if to this is added a half teacupful 
of pure glycerine, much better results will be obtained. In- 
jections are best given by means of a rubber hose four feet 
long to which a funnel is attached. Oil the hose, insert gently 
into the rectum about two feet, then pour the liquid into the 
funnel and by raising it above the animal, it will force itself 
into the bowels. 
Counter-irritants. — This is a class of practices applied for 
the purpose of setting up a local and artificial inflammation in 
order to cure or counteract a disease or injury. Their appli- 
cation requires some skill and much experience. The counter- 
irritants most used are liniments, blisters, and burning with a 
hot iron or “firing.” 
Blisters. — Two substances are commonly used for blisters: 
pulverized Spanish flies makes “fly-blister,” and the biniodide 
of mercury makes “red-blister.” Both are poisonous and should 
be cared for accordingly. They are.made by mixing one part 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 157 
by weight of the drug to eight parts of fresh lard or vaseline. 
For ordinary use the fly-blister is preferred, but to remove a 
bunch, the red-blister is most used. 
Clip the hair from the area, then rub in blister with a cob 
from three to ten minutes, depending on the severeness of the 
irritation and the thickness of the skin. As a rule a light blister 
repeated is more effective than a single severe one. Much care 
should be taken to see that the horse does not succeed in scatter- 
ing the blister. To this end his head and tail should be so tied 
that the animal cannot reach the substance. After twenty- 
four to thirty-six hours, or when a watery, gummy fluid 
exudes from the skin, the area should be thoroughly washed 
with warm water and soap, then wiped dry, and greased with 
fresh lard or vaseline. 
Mustard plasters are often used when large surfaces must be 
treated, as in pleurisy, inflammation of the lungs, and a few 
other diseases. This plaster is made by stirring up finely ground 
mustard with warm water into a thin paste, then applied to the 
area and rubbed in well with a cob or stick. Mustard will prove 
more satisfactory than fly-blisters when large areas are to be 
treated, as the latter often irritates the kidneys, and as a result 
there is painful passage of the urine. When such symptoms 
appear, the fly-blister should be washed off and the part 
greased. 
Firing. — This consists in burning the skin with a red hot iron. 
The firing-iron is rather heavy so as to hold heat, but has 
a sharp point. Firing is used to remove bunches, ring-bones, 
spavins, and the like. The hair is clipped from the area, the 
irons heated in a stove, the horse is blindfolded, a twist applied 
to the nose, and the opposite foot is lifted and in this way the 
one to be operated on is confined. At first the skin is barely 
touched and the lines marked, then the lines are burned to a good 
russet brown by drawing the hot irons through the former lines. 
A fly-blister is then rubbed on the fired area and the case treated
-P-A-G-E-186
158 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
as for blistering. The horse should be given plenty of time 
to recover before being put to work. 
There are two methods of firing in common use: One consists 
of making a number of parallel lines, and is known as “line- 
firing.” The other consists in burning a number of little holes 
over the part to be treated, and is known as “‘point-firing.” It 
is held that point-firing sets up a deeper inflammation. Oc- 
casionally both methods are combined, and after the line-firing 
a few points are made over the most diseased part. 
LAMENESS: ITS CAUSE AND TREATMENT 
The horse is used largely for locomotive power. Anything 
that interferes with his travel and pull materially lessens his 
usefulness. Of all farm animals, the horse is the most exposed 
to accidents and injuries leading to lameness. Lameness inter- 
feres with his usefulness more than with that of any other farm 
animal. A lame horse cannot work, whereas a lame cow may 
give as much milk, a lame pig take on fat, and a lame sheep 
shear as much wool as though it were sound. The causes of 
lameness among horses are numerous and varied. Only a few 
of the more important are discussed here, as a complete list 
would fill a volume. 
Lameness due to ailments of the bones 
The bones of the horse’s legs are particularly subject to 
ailments causing lameness; this is especially true of the bones 
below the knees and hocks. The most important ailments of 
the bones likely to cause lameness are splints, ring-bones, 
side-bones, bone-spavin, bony enlargements, and fractures of 
the bone. 
Splints, ring-bones, side-bones, bone-spavin, and bony enlarge- 
ments.—These ailments are caused by severe strains, concus- 
sion, blows and hurts; by poorly kept hoofs; and by certain 
diseases of the foot as corns, cracks, quittor, and the like.

160 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The treatment is to let them alone as long as the horse 
suffers no inconvenience. If slightly lame, remove shoes and 
give rest. If lameness persists, try cold water bath and hand- 
rub thoroughly ; then try astringent lotion. If still lame, try 
tincture of iodine. Paint on twice daily until skin becomes 
sore, then withhold a few days. If still lame, try Spanish-fly 
or red-blister. Lastly, the firing-irons may be resorted to. 
Such operations should be performed only by those familiar 
with the work. 
Fracture. — A fracture is a break in a bone. Fractures are 
caused by blows, falls, collisions, and the like, as well as by sud- 
den muscular contractions such as a violent effort to move a load, 
a quick jump, a sudden stop or too sudden start, and like causes. 
The treatment of fractured bones consists in replacing the 
broken bones in their natural position and keeping them there 
without movement until they grow fast together. This is easiest 
accomplished by covering with two layers of flannel bandages, 
smoothly applied. Over this bandage place thin strips of wood, 
or other light material, so as to hold the bones in place, then bind 
with bandages. These wooden strips or splints should be as long 
as convenient. In the place of splints, plaster of Paris bandages 
can often be used to advantage. Such bandages may be ob- 
tained from the drug store or made from cheese cloth and plas- 
ter of Paris. After applying splints, they should be carefully 
watched to see that they do not shut off the circulation below 
the break. If the horse is to be maintained in a standing posi- 
tion, a sling and “lean to” must be supplied to rest the animal. 
Lameness due to ailments of the joints 
There are three classes of injuries due to ailments of the joints. 
These are, affections of the synovial sacs of the joint structures, 
or of the bones and their articular surface, and dislocations of the 
joints. The most important ailments of the joints likely to
-P-A-G-E-189
  
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 161 
cause lameness are wind-galls or wind-puffs; bog, blood, and 
occult spavin, and thoroughpin. 
Wind-galls, blood-spavin, bog-spavin, and thoroughpin. — 
Wind-galls usually occur between tendons where small sacs, 
containing synovial fluid or joint-oil, are situated to lubricate 
the tendons as they play over each other. They appear in the 
form of soft and somewhat rounded or elongated puffs of vary- 
ing size. They may be located on either side of the leg. Usually 
wind-galls are painless and cause lameness only under certain 
conditions. In rare cases they solidify into hard masses. The 
blood-spavin is situated in front and on the inside of the hock. 
It is merely a dilated condition of the vein and is soft and yield- 
ing to pressure. The bog-spavin is a round, smooth, well-de- 
fined puff situated in front and a little inward of the hock. 
On pressure it disappears from this joint to reappear on the out- 
side and just behind the hock. Thoroughpin is found at the 
back and on the top of the hock in the part known as the “hol- 
lows” just behind the shank bone. These rarely cause lameness, 
but may under certain conditions. They are rather unsightly. 
These ailments are usually due to strains and overexertions. 
In colts they may disappear. The treatment is to cause the 
puff to be absorbed. Rest, cold water baths, followed by hand- 
rubbing, will usually bring about the desired result. If they 
persist, paint with tincture of iodine twice daily until sore. 
Later try a dull red-blister, but never a sharp one. 
Lameness due to ailments of muscles and tendons 
Diseases and ailments of the muscles and tendons are a fre- 
quent cause of lameness among horses, the most important of 
which are sprains, shoulder lameness, hip lameness, knuckling, 
sprung knees and curb. 
Sprains is the name applied to the injury of the muscles, 
tendons, or ligaments whereby their fibers slip or yield. It is 
very common, as none of the muscles or tendons are exempt 
M
-P-A-G-E-190
  
  162 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
from liability to sprains. Severe lameness usually comes on 
suddenly after the injury. The parts become inflamed, swollen, 
and tender. 
The usual cause of a sprain is external violence, such as a fall 
or a powerful exertion of strength and sudden twisting and 
bending of the joints. 
The treatment depends on the conditions. If there is severe 
pain, hot baths will soften, soothe, and relax the part. If there 
is much inflammation, cold baths will prove beneficial. The 
animal should be given rest and kept quiet; hence the box 
stall is preferable in this case to the pasture. If the lameness 
persists, apply liniment and perhaps fly-blisters. 
Shoulder lameness, the result of a sprain, is of common occur- 
rence. It is by the shoulder that the horse does his work, and 
for this reason the part is particularly exposed to injury. 
It would be difficult and not worth while to name all the 
forms of violence by which the shoulder may be injured. 
The chief causes are falls, violent efforts in starting heavy 
loads, balling the feet with snow, and colliding with other 
objects. : 
If not severe, time and rest will cure. When there is pain 
and swelling, bathe in hot water for half an hour three times 
daily and apply some astringent lotion. Warm wet blankets 
are of great service. Anodyne liniments, camphor, belladonna, 
either in the form of tinctures or oils, are beneficial. Lastly, try 
dull blisters. 
Sweeny shoulder is a rapid wasting away of certain muscles 
on the outside of the shoulder-blade. While met with in horses 
of any age, it is more common in young animals. If neglected, 
it ruins the animal. 
Sweeny is caused by straining, by severe pulling, and by 
jerking movements. Idle horses when put to work are most 
liable. The nerves or blood vessels of the affected part seem 
to be injured by the pressure of the collar.
-P-A-G-E-191
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 163 
The treatment is to remove the cause. Rest the horse if pos- 
sible; if not, procure a perfect fitting collar. Rub and manip- 
ulate the skin and muscle. Later apply a mild liniment, and 
hand rub. Two months should be allowed for a complete cure. 
Light fly-blisters three weeks apart may be used. 
Sore shoulders and neck, and galls are of frequent occurrence 
among horses and are due to poorly fitting collars and harness 
as well as to certain kinds of work when the load borne by the 
neck is great. 
The remedy is to remove the cause. Keep the parts dry. 
Wash in cold or hot water, depending on conditions, three times 
daily, and apply white lotion. If nothing else is at hand, and 
the galls not bad, wash the parts in hot or cold salt water. 
Dust on finely pulverized air-slaked lime. Oxide of zine oint- 
ment is good. If the parts become calloused, apply a dull red- 
blister, which will absorb the callous. It will be necessary to 
give the animal rest while applying the blister. 
Curb is a thickening or bulging of the ligament on the back 
part of the hock, and just below the point, giving the cannon 
a curved, protruding outline. A curb is easily noted when 
viewed from the side. 
The cause may be a sprain of the tendon which passes over 
the back part of the hock. Hocks of certain conformation, such 
as overbent, coarse, thick, or those too narrow, are liable to 
this ailment. The tendency seems to be hereditary (see dis- 
cussion in Chapter IV). 
The treatment for curb is to give cold bath on the first 
appearance of inflammation. Allow the animal to rest. Shoe 
the foot of the affected leg with high-heeled shoe. This will 
raise the heel and slacken the ligament. Apply ointments of 
iodine. Later the application of dull red-blister repeated in 
two or three weeks may prove beneficial. In cases in which 
animals have a natural curby hock and it does not cause lame- 
ness, it is best to let it alone.
-P-A-G-E-192
  164 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Lameness due to capped-elbows or shoe-boils 
Capped joints and shoe-boils first appear as a soft, flabby 
bag containing a little watery fluid. 
Capped-elbows are caused by the irritation due to the horse 
lying on the shoe when the foot is bent back under the body. 
The treatment of capped-elbows is to devise a means for its 
prevention. This is often difficult. The horse should be well 
bedded. If the heels of the shoe protrude, they should be 
shortened. A good method of preventing a horse from lying 
on the heel of the shoe is to fasten a piece of wood, say two by 
two inches, across the stall about one foot back of where the 
horse usually stands. This prevents the animal from doubling 
his fore feet back under the body when lying down. 
Capped-knee is an enlargement on the front of the knee and 
is somewhat similar to a capped-elbow. Capped-knees may 
prove a great source of annoyance because of the unsightly 
blemish they constitute. 
While there may be many causes of capped-knees, they are 
most common among horses addicted to the habit of pawing 
while in the stable and striking the front of the stalls with their 
knees, and among naturally weak-kneed animals which are sub- 
ject to falling and thus bruising their knees on the ground. 
The treatment is first of all to remove the cause. This, of 
course, cannot be accomplished among animals with weak 
knees, and this class is difficult to treat. The enlargements can 
be reduced in size by hot baths and by rubbing with liniment. 
A warm poultice of oil-meal or ground flaxseed enveloping the 
entire joint and held in place by bandages is often followed by 
an absorption of the enlargement. 
Capped-hock is an enlargement of the point of the hock and is 
somewhat similar to capped elbows and knees. It is commonly 
caused either by the horse lying on the hock or by irritation due 
to the repeated hitting of the hock against a whiffle-tree or
-P-A-G-E-193
TA thr c— 
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 165 
similar object. The treatment should be much the same as that 
suggested above for capped-knees. 
The shoe-boil should receive attention. It should be bathed 
in hot water twice daily, followed by a stimulating liniment well 
rubbed on the parts. In some cases, however, astringents are 
used in the form of poultices or pastes. An excellent astringent 
for such cases is a putty made of powdered chalk and vinegar, 
  Fig. 62.—Sranparp Brep CarrRIAGe STALLION ‘‘CARMON” AT THE HEAD 
OF THE GOVERNMENT Stup av Forr CoLiins, CoLorapo. 
and the entire swelling is then covered with a thick coating of 
soft clay made into a mass with water. This will dry and fall 
off, after which it should be reapplied. 
Lameness due to ailments of the foot 
Since the value of a horse depends largely upon his ability 
to do labor, which in turn depends largely on the condition of 
his feet, it is, therefore, important that the feet be kept sound ;
-P-A-G-E-194
  166 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and to accomplish this end it is necessary not only to know how 
to cure ailments to which they are liable, but, better still, how 
to prevent them. 
Interfering. — This is the name given to the condition when 
one foot strikes the opposite leg while traveling. The inner 
surface of the fetlock joint is the part most subject to this injury, 
although it may happen along the cannon, when it is usually 
called “speedy cuts.” The hind legs are more liable than the 
fore legs. As a result of interfering the skin and deeper tissues 
are bruised, which often causes lameness and thickening of the 
injured parts. It is often caused by faulty conformation; from 
the feet growing too long; from defective shoeing; from rough 
or slippery roads; from exhaustion; from high knee action; 
from fast work; and because the chest or hips are too narrow. 
The treatment is often difficult, and perhaps impossible when 
due to deformity or faulty conformation. When due to fatigue, 
fetlock- and ankle-boots may be used. Proper shoeing will often 
prevent interfering. The outside heel and quarter of the foot 
on the injured leg should be lowered enough to change the posi- 
tion of the fetlock joint, by bringing it farther away from the 
center, thereby permitting the other foot to pass by without 
striking, at the same time setting the shoe that is causing the 
injury well under the hoof. 
After removing the cause, apply cold water bandage to the 
injured parts to remove the soreness and swelling in recent 
cases. In older cases, when the parts have become calloused 
from long-continued bruising, apply a fly-blister to the parts, 
repeating in three weeks if necessary. 
Overreaching is the condition when the shoe of the hind foot 
strikes and injures the heel or quarter of the fore foot. It 
seldom occurs except when the horse is traveling fast. It is 
most common in trotting and running horses. Animals 
that are subject to overreaching should not be driven 
fast without quarter boots. It can sometimes be remedied 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 167 
by shoeing treatment, the same as for interfering mentioned 
above. 
Calk wounds. — These are wounds near the top of the hoof 
and are caused by sharp-shod horses either trampling on them- 
selves or on each other. Heavy draft horses are more subject 
than lighter ones, and the fore feet more liable to injury than 
the hind ones, though they often result in the hind feet from thy 
horse resting one foot on top of the other. The treatment is the 
use of boots properly to protect the top of the hoof, and shoeing 
the foot causing the injury with blunt calks. When the wound 
is not deep and soreness slight, cold water bandages and a pro- 
tective dressing, such as carbolized vaseline, will be all that is 
needed. 
Corns result from bruises of the sole. They occur on the in- 
side half of the sole of the front feet. Corns often accompany 
weak flat feet, and often result from poor shoeing. The treat- 
ment is to discover the cause and if possible remove it. Give 
the horse rest. Horses subject to corns should be shod with 
wide-webbed bar shoes, as these protect the foot. As to a cure, 
the blood or pus that has collected needs to be removed. Todo 
this cut a hole through the sole of the foot, allowing the fluid to 
escape. Wash in warm water and apply a 5 per cent solution 
of carbolic acid, turpentine pure or white lotion. When the 
discharge has ceased, apply pine tar to the opening to keep out 
the dirt. 
Punctured wounds of the foot.— The foot of the horse is 
liable to wounds made by some sharp object puncturing the sole 
or the frog and injuring the soft tissues. Such wounds may 
become serious and hence should receive close attention. Te- 
tanus or lockjaw often follows such wounds in the horse. Such 
wounds are caused by nails, sharp rocks, glass, wire, and the like. 
They often cause lameness. The treatment is first of all to 
withdraw the object.. If pus and blood has collected, the hole 
must be enlarged to facilitate drainage and the sole washed with
-P-A-G-E-196
  168 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
5 per cent solution of carbolic acid. Where there is much sore- 
ness,. the foot must be poulticed for a day or two. Keep the 
horse in a clean, dry stable, as otherwise dirt will get into the 
wound. 
Cracked hoofs. — Cracks occur in the wall of the hoof. They 
are designated by three names depending on the location. A 
“quarter-crack” is when the crack begins at the top of the hoof 
and extends downward in the wall; a ‘‘sand-crack”’ when the 
crack begins at the bottom and extends upward; a “‘toe-crack”’ 
when the crack is in the front of the hoof. They may be due 
to severe work, injuries at the top of the hoof, and to a dry, 
weakened condition of the walls of the hoof. When the cracks 
extend to or from the top of the hoof, they may cause severe 
lameness. As the horse steps the hoof spreads and the soft 
tissues are pinched in the crack. Sand and gravel may get into 
the crack thus increasing the trouble. The treatment is to 
clean out the crack neatly. If “proud flesh” has formed, swab 
with butter of antimony. Wash with 5 per cent solution of 
carbolic acid, then apply pine tar to keep out the dirt and to 
aid in healing. Draw crack together by shoeing nails driven 
across the crack and clinched. Small clips can be procured 
for this purpose. The hoof should be kept well oiled. 
DISEASES OF THE LEGS 
Scratches is an inflammation of the skin, especially in the 
region of the heels, and by some is called ‘“‘grease heel.” This 
ailment is usually due to nud and filth. The hind heels being 
more exposed to the manure are more subject. The treatment 
is to clean the parts. First clip the hair close to the skin, bathe 
in warm water, then apply a warm poultice of scalded bran or 
linseed meal, changing twice in twenty-four hours. After scabs 
are removed wash, wipe dry, and apply an antiseptic as boric 
acid, dusting into the sores, then cover with some oily dressing 
as vaseline, glycerine, castor oil, or fresh lard. 
   
-P-A-G-E-197
  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 169 
Mud fever is an inflammation of the skin of the legs. It is 
caused by the irritation of the mud and water in the spring of the 
year, and occasionally by spattering urine against the fore legs in 
the case of geldings. The treatment is to keep the parts clean. 
Clip the hair, cleanse by washing with tar soap, wipe dry, then 
rub with vaseline, castor oil, or glycerine. 
Eczema is an inflammation of the skin. It usually occurs 
among horses in good flesh, especially in the spring when the hair 
is long. It is characterized by small eruptive blisters that dis- 
charge a gummy substance. This dries about the roots of the 
hair, causing intense itching, especially when the animal sweats. 
The treatment is to clip the hair, cleanse by washing with tar 
soap, wipe dry, then rub the skin with some bland oil as vaseline, 
glycerine, or castor oil, or better still, oxide of zinc ointment. 
DISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS 
In considering ailments of the digestive organs, it must be 
remembered that by far the greater number of these difficulties 
are due to improper food or to careless feeding. Hence in the 
treatment of the various diseases of the digestive organs, the 
method of feeding as well as the kind of food should receive 
careful attention. 
Ailments of the mouth 
The mouth is subject to many injuries which may have a 
serious effect upon mastication and digestion. When the horse 
does not masticate his food, the mouth should be closely ex- 
amined. 
Sore mouth may result from irritating foods, injuries, and 
germs of diseases, from severe bits and irregular or diseased 
teeth, also from vicious habits. The treatment is to locate 
the cause and remove it. Wash the mouth thoroughly with 
warm water, then apply three times daily a healing lotion, such 
as a strong solution of alum. Do not use poisonous remedies.
-P-A-G-E-198
  170 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The horse should be fed soft foods, such as gruels and 
mashes. 
Abnormal and diseased teeth. —'The outer edges of the upper, 
and the inner edges of the lower, back teeth may become sharp 
and cut the cheeks or tongue. With a guarded rasp, remove 
the sharp points, taking care not to rasp the grinding surface of 
the teeth. 
Decayed, ulcered, split, and broken teeth should be removed. 
This should be done with forceps. Never punch teeth out if 
it can be avoided, as the tooth is likely to be broken and some 
of the pieces remain in the jaw where they cannot be removed, 
and thus cause much trouble. Occasionally, however, it will be 
necessary to cut a hole through the jaw bone and punch the 
tooth out. In all cases the opposite tooth should be filed off 
at least once a year. 
Lampas is a swelling of the mucous membrane covering the top 
of the mouth. It is caused by some irritation of the mouth, 
and is more troublesome at teething time, after which it will 
disappear. The treatment is to remove the cause when pos- 
sible. In very bad cases a few pricks with a suture needle, 
then bathing the mouth in alum water, will prove helpful. If 
the mouth is pricked, the horse should be fed on soft food for 
a time. In mild cases the feeding of ear corn will suffice. 
Burning lampas is cruel and injurious and should never be 
tolerated. 
Ailments of the throat and gullet 
Diseases and derangements of these organs are not common 
except choking, the result of the introduction of foreign bodies 
or of giving some irritating medicine. 
Choking is the closing of the gullet with some foreign body. 
It often happens when the animal attempts to swallow an 
apple or turnip and similar objects without crushing them. 
Some horses choke from feeding too rapidly. The treatment is
-P-A-G-E-199
  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 171 
to remove the object by getting it up if possible; if not, by 
pushing it down. If the object is in the beginning of the gullet, 
it can be worked up. To do this it is necessary to use a mouth- 
gag in the horse’s mouth to protect the hand, then as some one 
presses upward and forward on the object from the outside of 
the gullet, pass the hand into the mouth and if possible, with- 
draw the offending object. It may require some effort to work 
the object up in this way, but it should be done if possible. If 
all attempts to work the object up fail, then it should be pushed 
down with a probang, — a smooth, flexible tube or rod. A piece 
of three-fourth inch rubber hose is good. 
Ailments of the stomach and intestines 
Because of the small size of the horse’s stomach, it is often 
difficult to distinguish between the diseases of the stomach and 
intestines. While the stomach and’ intestines of the horse are 
subject to a great many ailments, we shall discuss only the 
more important, which are indigestion, colic, diarrhea, and con- 
stipation. 
Indigestion is one of the most common ailments of the diges- 
tive organs among horses. It may be due to both the stomach 
and small intestines failing to digest the food properly. Some 
of the more important causes are the feeding of indigestible food, 
improper feeding, bad teeth, which prevent proper mastication 
of food, hard work immediately after feeding, and any cause 
that profoundly disturbs the system. It may occur in either 
mild or acute form. If the attack is mild, the animal refuses 
his food, lies down, and immediately after gets up, looks toward 
the flanks, and frequently paws the ground. In such cases the 
treatment is not difficult. Give the stomach and intestines a 
few days’ rest in which to recuperate, feeding only a light laxa- 
tive diet, such as bran mashes and fresh grass. Drench the 
horse with two ounces of Jamaica ginger, dissolved in a pint of 
fairly hot water, three times daily. In acute indigestion the 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  172 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
animal suffers much pain. The symptoms are much the same, 
The animal, lying down frequently, paws the ground, looks 
towards the flanks, stands stretched out, and shows evidence 
of the pain he is suffering. Treat much the same as for mild 
indigestion, but repeat the Jamaica ginger drench every three 
hours. If there is much pain, an ounce of laudanum may be 
given three times daily. 
  Fic. 63.— An American Trorrinc Brep Carriace Horse possessine Goop 
Form anp SryiisH AcTION. 
Colic. — This term is often loosely applied to almost any 
ailment of the digestive organs that is accompanied by pain. 
For our purpose we shall consider it under two forms: spas- 
modic or cramp colic, and flatulent or wind colic. 
Spasmodic colic is a violent and painful contraction of the 
coats of the intestines. It is caused by some irritant in the 
intestines, such as undigested food, large amounts of cold water 
when the horse is tired and warm, sudden changes in the food, 
such as changing from dry to green food, and similar changes. 
The pain is severe and often comes on suddenly. The horse 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 173 
stops suddenly, looks towards the flanks, stretches, and strains 
as if trying to pass urine, paws the ground, kicks at his belly, 
throws himself down, and rolls. He sweats, and the respiration 
and pulse are increased in rapidity. After a time the pain 
ceases, only to be renewed by another attack in a few minutes. 
The treatment is to get the horse into a comfortable place 
where he can roll without injury. Inject into the rectum eight 
quarts of warm water, containing half a teacupful of glycerine. 
This should be injected slowly so as to allow the animal to retain 
it as long as possible. Drench with two-ounce doses of Jamaica 
ginger as in indigestion. Sweet spirits of niter in ounce doses is 
also good, as is a tablespoonful of common baking soda dis- 
solved in warm water. To relieve the pain, give one ounce of 
laudanum and half an ounce of spirits of camphor mixed in half 
a pint of water. Rubbing the belly vigorously also relieves 
the pain, as do blankets rung out of hot water and applied to 
the belly. 
In flatulent or “wind” colic the pain comes on more gradu- 
ally and is continuous. The pain is due to the accumulation of 
gas in the stomach and intestines, resulting from the fermenting 
of food. Sometimes the pain is severe, other times it is not. 
The large intestines are often extended with gas; in fact the 
bloating may be severe enough to interfere with the horse’s 
breathing. The animal acts much the same as in spasmodic 
colic. He often attempts to lie on the back as this seems to 
favor passing of the gas. The treatment is much the same as 
in spasmodic or cramp colic. 
Diarrhea or scouring. — This is an effort of nature to remove 
some irritant from the bowels. The discharges are frequent, 
the matter thin and watery, and often characterized by a very 
foul-smelling odor. Often there is severe straining. Diarrhea 
may be caused by overfeeding, by bad food, by sudden changes 
in the food, by eating too rapidly, by drinking bad water, and 
by driving immediately after feeding. Again, some horses are
-P-A-G-E-202
  174 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
predisposed to diarrhea, especially when driven on the road. 
Since diarrhea is caused by an irritant, the treatment is first 
_to locate the cause and remove it. The discharge must not be 
checked too suddenly. A half teacupful of castor oil, combined 
with an ounce of laudanum and given as a drench with a little 
linseed gruel, is excellent. Oak-bark tea, made by steeping the 
inner bark of white oak, is good for persistent cases. A teacup- 
ful of this tea combined with an ounce of laudanum should be 
given as a drench twice daily. Horses that are subject to 
diarrhea while on the road should be watered and fed as long 
as possible before put to work. Water sparingly immediately 
before and during the drive. 
Constipation is the opposite to diarrhea. The discharge is 
not frequent, the matter hard and dry and often passed with 
much effort. The causes are rather numerous and varied. 
Constipation may be due to bad food, lack of exercise, insuffi- 
cient water, improper feeding, and is often due to other dis- 
eases. The treatment is to reach the cause and remove it, 
then feed laxative foods, such as thin bran mashes, linseed 
-gruels, and if possible, green grass. Injections of warm water 
and glycerine are good to empty the bowels. If the ailment 
persists, give small doses of castor oil or raw linseed oil, say 
one pint, and if this is not effective, repeat. This is more satis- 
factory than one large dose. 
| DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS 
The stable is the source of many respiratory ailments. Poorly 
ventilated, poorly lighted, poorly drained, and poorly kept 
stables are perhaps the source of more ailments among horses 
than all other agents combined. Pure air, light, dryness, and 
cleanliness are essentials to the horse’s well being. These can 
be procured with small cost and should not be neglected in the 
arrangement of a stable in which to care for the horse. 
Catarrh is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the
-P-A-G-E-203
  
‘DISEASES OF THE HORSE 175 
nostrils and nasal chamber. There are two well-recognized 
forms; the acute and the chronic. Catarrh is often associated 
with distemper. Acute catarrh comes on rather suddenly. 
The animal appears dull. There is often a chill in the early 
stages, followed later by fever. The membrane is dry and 
rather red. Soon a watery discharge flows from the nostrils, 
the eyes may be affected and tears flow down the cheeks. 
The discharge from the nostrils becomes thicker and pus-like. 
The bowels are often constipated. The cause is exposure to 
cold and wet. The treatment is to give rest, provide comfort- 
able quarters, blanket the animal, and feed laxative, easily 
digested food, such as bran mashes, linseed gruel, and grass, if 
inseason. A few days’ quiet rest, with pure air and good food, 
will be of greater benefit than most medication. Give a table- 
spoonful of saltpeter in the drinking water once daily. Often 
much benefit can be derived from the inhalation of steam. 
To do this throw a blanket over the horse’s head, place under this 
a pail of boiling water containing a tablespoonful of earbolic acid. 
Chronic catarrh comes slowly ; in fact is usually due to some 
other disease such as a cold, though there are other causes. 
The animal appears much the same as in acute catarrh, the 
discharge being thicker, often yellowish to white. It may be 
discharged in lumps. In some cases it clogs, and the face may 
bulge from the pressure of the pus inside. Occasionally the 
parts become diseased and the pus cuts through and is dis- 
charged to the outside. Sometimes there is a cough. The 
treatment so far as rest and food is concerned is the same as 
in acute cases. Give the horse a tonic. Steam the head. 
After steaming spray the nostrils once daily with the following : 
two drams of boric acid dissolved in one quart of warm water. 
Occasionally the pus collects in one of the cavities, and it is neces- 
sary to cut open and wash out the cavity. The boric acid solu- 
tion makes a good wash for this purpose. This may greatly 
hasten the cure.
-P-A-G-E-204
    
176 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Heaves, broken wind, asthma.— Many loosely apply the term 
“heaves”? to all ailments where the breathing is difficult and 
noisy. While the veterinarians define these ailments as if well 
understood, yet they seem to be unable to do much for such 
diseases. Heaves is often associated with indigestion, or to an 
error in the choice of food. Overfeeding, especially with dusty 
or moldy hay, is a common cause. Severe work immediately 
after feeding may bring on the ailment. Again the tendency 
to the disease seems to be hereditary, hence animals thus dis- 
posed should not be used in breeding. Heaves is readily rec- 
ognized by the deep, moist, grunting cough; by the peculiar 
movement of the flank during expiration and by the dilated 
nostrils which frequently discharge a thick mucus. These 
are more noticeable immediately after feeding or watering. 
“ Heavy” horses are very common. 
When the disease is established, there is no cure. Proper 
attention should be paid to. the quarters and diet. Provide 
light, dry, clean, and well-ventilated quarters. Feed easily 
digested, nutritious, and not bulky food. Moisten the hay 
— and do not feed too much. Molasses as well as carrots, pota- 
toes, or turnips chopped and mixed with oats and corn, are a 
good diet. For medicine give arsenic, in the form of Fowler’s 
solution, at first two teaspoonfuls in the food or water three

Roaring, whistling, thick wind. — These are due to an obstruc- 
tion in some part of the respiratory tract which prevents the 
free passage of air. The causes are numerous and not well 
understood. It often follows distemper or injury to the throat. 
The tendency is hereditary. Some animals seem more dis- 
posed than others, especially those with long slender necks.

by way of treatment. In certain forms of the ailment, light 
blistering over the larynx will give relief.

  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 17 
MISCELLANEOUS DISEASES 
There are many ailments of the horse, more or less general 
in their nature. Some of them involve more than one of the 
systems of the animal body. Many of them are not well under- 
stood. It has seemed best, therefore, to set these ailments out 
by themselves and discuss under one general heading. 
Wounds are injuries to the living tissue. Their causes are 
varied and numerous. First examine the wound to find the 
depth and direction and to see that there is no foreign substance 
in it. All foreign materials, such as dirt, hair, and the like, 
must be carefully washed out with water to which a little car- 
bolic acid has been added, about a teaspoonful of the acid to a 
quart of water. Where there is much bleeding, this must be 
stopped, at least in part. If the bleeding is from an artery, it 
may be necessary to tie the end of the artery towards the 
heart. In ordinary wounds the treatment is to hasten the 
formation of a clot. To do this bring the edges of the wound 
together and bind them there. If this is not convenient, apply 
some material, such as absorbent cotton, to the wound; this 
serves to gather and hold the blood, thus hastening the clot. 
Ordinary wheat flour applied to the wound is good to hasten 
clot formation. So is bathing in alum solutions. Cold water 
is also good. In large wounds it may be necessary to sew the 
edges together. In doing this much care must be exercised to 
keep everything perfectly clean. The parts must be brought 
together evenly so that the edges will not pucker. In stitching, 
if possible use silk thread, but whatever material used, it should 
first be dipped into a solution of carbolic acid. Make the 
stitches independent, tying the two ends across the wound. 
Place stitches one-quarter to one-half inch apart. Bathe in 5 
per cent solution of carbolic acid. Protect the wound and re- 
strain the horse so it cannot rub or bite the injured part. 
Distemper, often called strangles, colt ill, catarrhal fever, or 
N 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
      MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
| shipping fever, is peculiar to the horse, mule, and ass, and it 
is common. It appears as a fever lasting a few days, with 
formation of matter or pus, in the air tubes, and often the for- 
mation of abscesses in other parts of the body. It usually leaves 
the horse perfectly healthy, but may leave it a roarer. The 
disease is infectious and passes from one animal to another, 
and few are the animals that escape it. Ordinary light cases 
require but little treatment beyond proper protection and feed- 
ing nutritious, easily digested food, such as bran mashes. They 
must have protection from exposure to cold and damp or the 
disease will be complicated with bronchitis or similar ailments. 
If the case becomes serious, more care is required. To reduce 
the temperature the safest and simplest plan is to inject large 
quantities of cold water into the rectum; or give a table- 
spoonful of nitrate of potassium, as a drench or in the drinking 
_ water once daily. To ease the cough and allay the inflammation 
_ of the mucous membrane, place a blanket over the head, and 
steam with the vapor of warm water poured over a bucket of 
bran and ‘hay in which belladonna leaves or tar have been 
_ placed, as in catarrh. If the bowels are constipated, give in- 
jections of warm water and glycerine. Physic should not be 
given. If an abscess forms, poultice with warm linseed, chang- 
ing daily, open and wash with 3 per cent solution of carbolic 
acid. 
| Influenza, sometimes called pink-eye, bilious fever, grippe, 
and various other names, is also peculiar to the horse, mule, and 
ass. It usually appears as a fever; the animal seems greatly 
depressed, the mucous membranes of the eyes are very fre- 
quently enlarged and inflamed, giving rise to the name pink-eye. 
One attack usually protects the animal from future ones of the 
same disease, but not always. The disease is infectious and 
contagious, passing from one animal to another. The treat- 
ment is to give rest, provide comfortable quarters, and feed 
éasily digested and nutritious foods, such as bran mash, roots, 
   
-P-A-G-E-207
  DISEASES OF THE HORSE 179 
apples, good oats, and grass in season. The animal must have 
protection and warmth or complications will develop. If the 
cough is troublesome, steam the head as suggested for distemper, 
using a piece of camphor about the size of a walnut in a pail 
of boiling water and hold the animal’s head over it for fifteen 
minutes at a time at least three times daily. To reduce the 
temperature, inject cold water as suggested for distemper, or 
give a tablespoonful of nitrate of potash, as a drench or in the 
drinking water once daily. If the throat is sore, rub on a little 
mustard once a day for a few days. Care must be taken to 
avoid complications.

Azoturia is a form of poisoning resulting from high feeding 
and lack of exercise. It is often called “bloody water” because 
of the dense reddish or brownish urine. Azoturia occurs only 
among horses that are in good flesh, when they are exercised’ 
after standing in the stable for a few days. It often comes on 
quickly, attacking the animal after traveling only a short dis- 
tance. The horse becomes stiff, particularly in the hind part, 
and in severe cases sweats profusely, the muscles tremble, his

_hind parts difficult to control, and he goes down and is often 
unable to rise again. This ailment varies much in severity ; 
_ in some cases the animal goes lame and if stopped and blanketed, 
the disease passes away; in other cases the animal goes down 
and dies in a few minutes. The treatment in mild cases is a 
laxative, and graduated daily exercise. Sudden attacks will 
sometimes promptly subside if taken on the instant and the 
subject kept still and calmed by a dose of bromide of potassium 
in half ounce dose and sweet spirits of niter in ounce dose. If 
_ the animal does not calm, the bromide may be repeated in five 
_ hours and the niter twice daily. Blankets wrung from warm 
water and placed over the loins are also good to quiet the 
animal. After the animal has calmed, iodide of potassium in 
dram doses may be given three times daily in place of the 
bromide. The horse should be given all the water he wants, 
and if unable to stand, must have a thick soft bed, and should 
be turned from side to side at least every twelve hours. It is 
often necessary to draw the urine with a catheter. 
Foul sheath. — Geldings are occasionally troubled by an 
accumulation of the material from the glands of the sheath 
which often hinders the free passage of urine. The sheath 
may become stopped up and the retained urine increase the 
trouble. In such cases the sheath should be well cleaned, and 
then greased with fresh lard or vaseline. 
Diseases of the eye. — The value of sound eyes among horses 
cannot be overestimated. While there are many diseases and 
injuries to which the eye is subject, we shall consider only the 
three common ailments: simple inflammation, ‘moon blind- 
ness,” and “pink-eye.’’ Simple inflammation is usually due 
to an injury, or to some foreign bodies in the eye, such as hay 
seed, chaff, cinders, sand, and the like. Strong light irritates 
the eye. The eye becomes red and inflamed, the eyelids 
swollen, and the tears are discharged freely. The treatment is 
to locate the cause and remove it. Such bodies as hay seed 
   
-P-A-G-E-209
  
DISEASES OF THE HORSE 181 
and chaff can be removed by wiping the surface of the eyeball 
with a piece of soft silk. To do this it is often necessary to put 
a twitch on the animal. If any substance should stick into the 
eye, it is best removed with the forceps. After the cause is 
removed, bathe the eye with cold water and apply cold cloths 
to reduce the inflammation. If this does not reduce the in- 
flammation, bathe three times daily with hot instead of cold 
water. Follow this by applying a few drops of a solution of 
boric acid, a teaspoonful to a cup of water. This may be ap- 
plied with a medicine-dropper. 
In some parts of the country, moon-blindness is a very 
common disease of the eye among horses. Its causes are not 
known, though the disease tends to be hereditary. The eye 
behaves much as in simple inflammation. The eye becomes 
red and inflamed, the tears are profuse, the lids swollen and 
kept partly closed to shield the eye. In a week or two the in- 
flammation goes down, the eye clears up, save there remains 
around the iris a yellow band. In a few weeks the attack 
comes on again. These attacks continue until the animal 
becomes permanently blind. The sight can, however, be pro- 
longed by careful treatment. When the attack comes on, 
keep the animal in a moderately dark stall and treat as in simple 
inflammation. Bathe with hot water and apply boric acid solu- 
tion. In addition give internally as a drench one teaspoonful 
of iodide of potassium. Continue for five days, then withhold 
five days, and repeat. 
Pink-eye, as we have seen (p. 178), is a sort of influenza. 
The disease affects the entire system and is contagious. The 
treatment is to isolate the horse and disinfect his stall. Bathe 
with hot water and apply boric acid solution as in simple in- 
flammation. In addition give internally as a drench a heaping 
teaspoonful of nitrate of potassium, twice daily, as this stimu- 
lates the kidneys and reduces the fever.

CHAPTER VIII 
CHOOSING CATTLE — JUDGING 
In the choice of a cow, one must cultivate the same general 
faculties as in the choosing of a horse. Familiarity with what 
is wanted, powers of observation, and good judgment are 
equally as important in the choice of a cow as in that of any 
other animal. These can be gained only by study and prac- 
tice. The importance of these faculties cannot be overesti- 
mated in the choice of a cow, either for the dairy or for beef. 
TYPES OF CATTLE 
There are two distinct types of cattle: first, the dairy type, 
adapted to the production of milk; and second, the beef type, 
employed for the production of beef. These types are con- 
trolled by the demands made on the body of the animal. 
For example, in milk production the udder is perhaps as im- 
portant an organ as any, whereas in beef production it is needed 
only to sustain the young. Again, in the case of beef pro- 
duction it is very important that the animal take on flesh and 
that the body be plump and full, whereas in the production of 
milk this would be considered an objection, as the food should 
go to the production of milk and not to fat. These two 
types are of necessity widely different and one can no more 
have maximum milk production and maximum beef produc- 
tion in the same cow than he can have maximum speed and 
maximum force in the same horse, or in the same machine. 
185

  186 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The dairy type. — When we reflect upon the purpose fot 
which dairy cows are kept, the type becomes apparent. They 
are useful for the milk they can 
secrete, and not for the flesh of 
their bodies; and as the food 
should go to produce milk and 
not fat, therefore the body will 
be spare and not fleshy. The 
secretion of milk takes place in 
the udder and allied organs; 
therefore, the rear development

without a large factory; thus a 
large secretion of milk calls for a large digestive tract, which 
adds to the rear development (Fig. 65). 
In general appearance, the form of the dairy cow resembles 
that of a triple-wedge. Viewed from the side, she shows greater 
depth of body behind than in front. Viewed from the rear and 
top, she gradually widens from 
the chest to the hips. Viewed 
from the front and top, she 
gradually widens from the 
withers backward and down- 
ward to the abdomen. While 
this is the desired form and 
many superior cows possess it, 
yet exceptions occur, and 
many heavy milkers are not yo, 66,—Anavs Sremr. Grand cham- associated with this form. pion at the International Live Stock

tinctly objectionable in the milking cow. 
The beef type. —In the beef type, the food goes to the pro- 
duction of flesh; hence a tendency to fatten is desired. The 
   
-P-A-G-E-215
CHOOSING A COW 187 
quality of the flesh in different parts of the body varies widely. 
In the meat-market, flesh forming certain parts of the body is 
worth many times that from other parts. We demand there- 
fore in the beef type not only an animal with a tendency to 
take on fat, but this tendency must be accelerated: in the 
region of the valuable cuts. 
In general appearance, the form of the beef type resembles 
that of a brick set on edge. Viewed from the side, the top and 
bottom lines are parallel. There is no wedge shape; the ani- 
mal is as deep in front as behind. Viewed from the rear and 
top, the withers and chest present an appearance almost as 
wide as the hip and rump. The animal is compact and broad 
of back from shoulders to hips. Cattle of the beef type are 
often referred to as “blocky,” indicating compactness and 
squareness of form (Fig. 66). 
HOW TO ESTIMATE THE AGE OF A COW 
The age of a cow is a very important factor in determining her 
present and prospective value. Familiarity with the characters 
that indicate age, therefore, are often extremely useful. As in 
the case of the horse, a knowledge of these characters is not 
difficult to secure, but skill in their application depends much 
on continued practice. 
General consideration. —In estimating the age of a cow, 
the order of the appearance of the permanent teeth furnishes 
the best index, especially from two to five years of age. There 
are, however, other general considerations that aid in estimat- 
ing age, especially in the case of young and very old animals. 
Size is the principal factor in determining the age up to a year 
and one-half. In old animals the top of the head becomes 
more prominent, the sides of the face more depressed, and the 
hollows above the eyes deeper. With age the backbone be- _ 
comes more prominent and often strongly curved downward. 
Examination of the teeth. — While the order of the appearance

‘ather than less. 
  sidered the most accurate means of estimating age among cattle, 
yet they are not absolutely accurate 
nor are they as dependable as in 
the horse. Teeth in cattle vary in 
much the same manner as in the 
horse. See page 8 for variation in 
teeth among horses. 
As in the horse, there are two 
sets of teeth, —first, the temporary 
or milk teeth, and later the perma- 
nent teeth. The latter differ from 
the former in their greater size. 
This replacement of the temporary 
by the permanent is made neces- 
sary by the increased size of the 
jaw as the animal grows older. 
The calf is often born with the 
central pair of milk teeth, and the 
remaining pairs appear within the 
first month after birth. The calf 
is provided with four pairs of in- 
cisor teeth. There are incisors 
in the lower jaw only, the upper 
being provided with a cartilaginous 
pad. 
When the animal is approxi- 
mately eighteen months of age, 
the middle pair of milk teeth is replaced by permanent ones, 
which are fully twice as broad as the milk teeth, hence easily 
The intervals between the appearance of 
he succeeding pairs varies much according to the conditions, 
ut can be stated as approximately nine months, perhaps more

each pair is up and in full wear may be estimated as 
follows : — 
First or middle pair of permanent teeth  . ‘ . . 18 months 
Second or first intermediate pair of permanent teeth . . 27 months 
Third or second intermediate pair of permanent teeth. . 36 months 
Fourth or lateral pair of permanent teeth. . . . . . 45 months 
If there is a variation for this table, the cow is likely to be 
older rather than younger than the teeth indicate according to 
the ages. In fact, some authors say the first pair of permanent 
teeth appear at two years of age; the second pair at three; the 
third pair at four; and the fourth pair at five years of age. 
The permanent teeth of the cow differ in many respects from 
those of the horse. After they are up and in wear there is com- 
paratively little change for a few years. They are never firmly 
fixed in the jaw, as are the permanent teeth of the horse. 
As the animal grows older the teeth become narrower, and 
by the ninth year there is much space between them. They 
shrink away from each other and often become more or less 
discolored and finally drop out one by one. 
Examination of the horns.— The horns of cattle are often 
used in estimating the age. During the first two years the horns 
grow rapidly, and in this time they make approximately their 
entire growth. After two years of age, the growth is slow, and 
each year’s addition is marked by a more or less distinct ring. 
The first ring does not make its appearance until the animal is 
approximately three years old. The age is estimated, there- 
fore, by adding two to the number of rings present. 
CHOOSING A DAIRY COW 
The dairy cow is desired for her ability to secrete milk at a 
profit. In estimating the value of a dairy cow there is no 
method so satisfactory as the actual record of her performance 
as determined by the scales and the Babcock test. Having
-P-A-G-E-218
    190 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
a record of the quantity of milk, the percentage of fat, and the 
approximate food consumed, the value of a cow for dairy pur- 
poses may be determined very accurately. If in addition to her 
own record, we have a record of the performance of both her 
dam and her sire’s daughters, we can speculate with some 
degree of certainty her prospective production, as well as that 
of her daughters and her sons’ get. Such records, however, 
are seldom available, and in their absence we estimate the pro- 
duction by those signs that most certainly indicate it. While 
these signs are not always true indications of high production, 
yet in the absence of more accurate information they are the 
best we can do. 
As in the choosing of a horse, it is essential that we examine 
the animal in systematic order, otherwise some very valuable 
character may go unobserved. Perhaps the most convenient 
and simplest method is to note the general appearance of the 
animal first, that is, the form or shape, weight, quality, and 
constitution, and if these are satisfactory, then make a more 
detailed examination, studying each character in relation to 
milk production. 
General characteristics in dairy cows 
By carefully observing the general appearance of the dairy 
cow, one can gain a fair knowledge of her desirability. Very 
often the general features are not given much consideration 
and we pass to a detailed examination, with the result that 
many very important characteristics go unconsidered. Some 
persons have such an accurate ‘eye’ for appearances that 
they are able to judge a cow very surely by a general look; 
but for most people this method is unsafe. 
Form. — The general form should be considered from two 
points of view: First, with respect to angularity; second, 
freedom from beefiness.. It will aid us to gain a clearer under-
-P-A-G-E-219
  
CHOOSING A COW 191 
standing of the form among dairy cows if we will remember 
that there is extra heavy demand made upon four systems. 
These are the milk-secreting system, the digestive system, the 
circulatory system, and the nervous system. It is because of 
the extreme activity of these centers that the dairy cow is in- 
clined towards a given form. The milk-secreting organs and 
the digestive organs having an undue amount of work to do 
tends towards extreme development, while the other parts, be- 
cause of their inactivity, are inclined to be narrow. 
The typical form of a dairy cow is that of a triple wedge, as 
already indicated. Viewed from either side she should show 
greater depth of body behind than in front. The shoulder 
should be lower than the hips and the floor of the chest higher 
than the bottom of the udder. If a straight edge were laid 
along the back and allowed to project forward, and a second 
straight edge placed along the under line touching the bottom 
of the udder, the abdomen, and the floor of the chest, and allowed 
to project forward, it should meet the one from the back a short 
distance in front of the animal. Viewed from the rear and top 
the dairy cow should gradually widen from the chest to the hips. 
Straight edges placed along either side and projecting forward 
should meet a short distance in front of the animal. Viewed 
from the front and top she gradually widens from the withers 
backward and downward (Fig. 68). This illustrates the typical 
dairy form and the one towards which most good milk cows tend, 
though it does not follow that a cow, to be a good dairy animal, 
must be of this type. Occasionally a good milker can be found 
not of this form, but since most good milk cows tend towards 
this shape, and in the absence of more accurate data, such as 
the actual records, the choosing of animals possessing such 
configuration is to be recommended. 
If the cow tends naturally to take on fat, she is worth just so 
much less as a milk cow. The dairy cow should be spare. 
There should be an absence of fleshiness throughout, partic-

ularly in the region of the shoulders, the back, the rump, and 
about the tail-head, places likely first to show fat among animals 
possessing such a tendency. While this is the form ordinarily

The Guernsey dairy cattle originated on the island from which they take their 
name, one of the Channel Island group. They possess similar characteristics 
to the Jerseys, but are somewhat larger, and the milk is hardly so rich. The 
weight will run 900 pounds and upward. The color is either yellowish, brown- 
ish or reddish, fawn, and white.

sionally be found. A cow may be found that is so efficient 
with her food that she can take on fat and in addition secrete 
more milk than another and less efficient cow can secrete alone,
-P-A-G-E-221
CHOOSING A COW 198 
be she ever so spare. But in the absence of more accurate in- 
formation, the spare form is to be preferred. 
Quality. — The quality is a very important factor in the choice 
of a dairy cow. It is well determined by the condition of the 
skin, hair, and bone. The skin should be soft, mellow, oily to 
the touch, and comparatively thin. Care must be exercised in 
respect to the thinness of the skin, as a thin, papery skin as such 
is usually associated with weakness of constitution. The skin 
lining the ear, as well as that in the region of the udder, inside 
the thighs, and at the root of the tail, should be of a golden color 
and the secretions abundant. The hair should be soft, silky, 
and comparatively short. Black hairs will usually be harsher 
than white hairs, even on the same animal. While many good 
milking cows are loose in form, possessing an open conformation, 
yet the bone should be dense and of fine texture. Dairy cows 
possessed of a tight, heavy skin, coarse, harsh hair, and of a heavy, 
rough, coarse bone are deficient in quality. 
Constitution. — Because of the peculiar conditions under 
which most dairy cows are kept, the constitutional vigor de- 
serves much attention. Vigor is estimated by the expression, 
by the condition of the hair and hide, and by the chest capacity. 
The expression of the eyes, ears, and head should be mild and 
lively, and the animal should be on the alert. The chest ca- 
pacity should be large, particularly across the floor. A good way 
to note the width of the floor of the chest is to place the hand 
along the chest between the front legs, as the width between 
the front legs should be great. Narrowness between the front 
legs is objectionable for the reason that it indicates lack of 
constitution. 
Temperament. — The dairy cow should have a good tempera- 
ment. Among cattle there are two divisions of temperament : 
the nervous and lymphatic. In a cow of the former tempera- 
ment, the nervous organization is strong and well developed, 
while a cow of lymphatic temperament is sluggish in disposition 
°
-P-A-G-E-222
  194 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and inclined to fatten. Hence, for the dairy we desire a cow 
of nervous temperament, one that is sensitive and active, pos- 
sessing greatest vitality, and that is capable of giving all organs 
the greatest producing powers. 
Detail characters of a dairy cow. 
Having considered the general appearance of the dairy cow, 
we should pass to a more detailed examination of her characters 
before choosing. ‘In order that none of these characters go 
unobserved, they should be considered in order. 
The head of a dairy cow should be long, lean, and feminine in. 
appearance. There should be freedom from coarseness and 
heaviness. The face should be prolonged, lean, and the fea- 
tures distinct. The poll should be prominent and the forehead 
broad. The eyes should be mild, bright, and full. The nostrils 
should be large, permitting of the free passage of air. The ear 
should be of medium size, fine quality, and of an orange color 
inside. The horn should be rather small and free from coarse- 
ness, especially at the base. 
The neck should be rather long, slim, and fine, carrying the 
head gracefully. There should be freedom from fullness and 
heaviness. The windpipe should be rather prominent, especially 
up near the throat. While the neck should have a neat attach- 
ment at the head and shoulders, yet it should not blend so 
smoothly as in beef cattle because of the lack of flesh. The 
animal should not have a “ bull neck.” 
Fore-quarters. — The shoulders should be prominent, free 
from beefiness, and rather angular. The withers should be 
lean, thin, and refined. Both withers and shoulders should be 
free from meatiness and heaviness. The legs should be straight 
and short with fine shanks (Fig. 69). 
Body. — The producing powers of the dairy cow depend 
largely on the depth and volume of the barrel. We have already 
noted theimportance of the digestive, circulatory, and respiratory
-P-A-G-E-223

systems in the dairy cow. In order that these systems perform, 
their functions most efficiently it is necessary to provide them; 
ample room. The chest should 
be deep, with large heart girth, 
and broad on the floor, partic- 
ularly as noted between the 
fore legs. The ribs should be 
long and sufficiently arched to 
provide a capacious body. 
The abdomen should be large 
and deep, indicative of much 
capacity, and should be well Fic. 69.—Gumrnsey Cow, “Im- porteD Hayes Rosig.”’ Dam of

be lean, backbone rather promi- 
nent and strong. In many good dairy cows there is much 
distance between the spinal processes, and the cow is said to 
be ‘open jointed.” The loin should be broad, although the 
space between the last rib and hip may be rather open. 
Hind-quarters. — As a whole, the hind-quarters in a dairy. 
cow should be wide, long, and deep. There should be freedom: 
from fullness and meatiness, particularly at the tail-head. In 
many very good cows there is a slight raise from the hips to the 
attachment of the tail. The hip bones should be rather sharp, 
prominent and wide apart, thus giving ample room for the gen- 
erative organs. They should not be lower than the spine. The 
rump should be long and wide, with the thurls and pin-bones 
high and wide apart. From the points of the hips to the tail- 
head there should be a marked hollow, due to the absence of 
flesh. The thigh should be outcurved and thin, as this provides 
room for the udder. A thick thigh and a full twist are de- 
cidedly objectionable in a dairy cow. The legs should be 
comparatively short. 
Udder. — Too much stress cannot be placed on the impor- 
tance of thoroughly examining the udder when choosing a, dairy 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  196 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
cow. If one can say that one organ is more important than 
another, the udder is perhaps the most important organ in the 
dairy cow. The udder should be considered from two points 
of view: the size and form, and the quality. 
The udder should be large. In form it should be moderately 
thick, attached high and full behind, extending well down, 
though not pendulant, and extending far in front. The quar- 
ters should be comparatively even, with the teats of convenient 
size and well placed. The length of the udder is important 
since it gives a long line of absorption. It should be approx- 
imately thirty inches from the attachment at the back to * 
where it joins the belly. 
More important than the size and form of the udder is its 
quality. Many persons have purchased a cow because of her 
large udder, only to learn that it was large because fleshy 
and not because of containing much milk. Perhaps the best 
way to determine this is to see the udder milked out. When 
empty, the udder should almost lose its form. It should appear 
to consist of folds of soft, pliable, and loose skin. The im- 
portance of this cannot be overestimated. Those of large 
experience can determine by the touch whether the udder is 
large because fleshy or large because filled with milk. When 
filled with milk, the udder yields to pressure somewhat as a 
sponge when filled with water. On the other hand, when large 
because fleshy, the yielding is more like soft rubber. There is 
a characteristic difference which can be learned only by ex- 
perience. 
While there are many defects of the udder, the most common 
are small front quarters, with the teats much higher above or 
elose to the hind ones; fleshy udders which reduce but little 
with milking and yield a small flow; udders entirely deficient 
in size and often with very unequal quarters. One must be 
on the alert for small teats, so deficient in size as to be very 
inconvenient when milking. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  
CHOOSING A COW 197 
The milk-veins should be large, tortuous, long, and branching. 
These veins are considered important as they indicate the 
amount of blood that has passed through the udder. The veins 
usually lack development in heifers with their first calf. In 
a cow that has recently dropped her calf, the milk veins should 
be very prominent and full, extending well forward, and much 
crooked, passing into the body through large holes called 
“ milk wells.” 
Milk signs. — In the cow, as in the bull, there are a consider- 
able number of so-called milk signs that are relied upon more 
or less in the choice of a dairy 
animal. First among these 
is the “open” organization. 
It is said that an animal in 
which the joints of the skele- 
ton are loosely knit is likely 
to have good powers of secre- 
tion and assimilation. This 
loose-jointedness or lax organ- SRO Sa eet Gone 
ization is well indicated by  f, Ames, 
the distance between the 
vertebre in the spinal column, and this open or loose chine — 
the jointing of the spinal column — is taken to indicate good 
capacity to secrete milk. When the edges of these spinal pro- 
cesses are very prominent on either side, it is called a double 
chine, and this is supposed to be even a better indication of milk 
production. A long tail is also thought by many to indicate 
good powers of secretion, and we find many cattle judges who 
criticize the animal if the tail does not reach to the hock and the 
longer the better. 
On the back of the thighs and above the udder, it will be 
observed thatthe hair runs in the opposite direction from that 
on the other parts of the body. This up-growing hair upon 
the rear of the udder, thighs, and perineum constitutes what 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
    198 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
is called “ the escutcheon ” or ‘“ milk mirror.” It is asserted 
that the larger the area covered by this up-growing hair, the 
better producer the cow will be. Guenon, a Frenchman, held 
that the shape of the escutcheon was indicative of the quantity 
of milk and that the size was an index of the length of milk 
flow. Another character which Guenon associated with large 
production was the “thigh ovals.” These are circular patches 
of hair often found on the rear of the udder and just above 
the hind teats. They are not present in all udders, but their 
presence is considered to indicate large milk production. 
There are many more of these so-called milk signs which have 
from time to time and by different men been considered to be 
a true index to the value of a dairy cow as a milk producer. 
While it is no doubt true that many large-producing milk cows 
have possessed all of these signs, it is also true that many more 
and higher producers have been lacking in them, one and all. 
CHOOSING BEEF CATTLE 
In beef production there are two classes of cattle to be 
considered: the breeding animals and the fattening animals. 
We are concerned here in the selection of cattle to fatten for 
beef. The beef animal at various times in his life is designated 
by three names: store animal, feeding animal, and fat animal. 
Cattle are spoken of as store animals when merely being carried 
along, as through the summer, or winter, and before feeding 
begins; they are called feeding animals during the process of 
fattening; and fat animals after they are “finished” and 
ready for market. 
For fattening purposes steers are preferred to heifers. All 
things being equal, steers will feed out better than heifers. 
This is due in part to the fact that steers are quieter in the feed 
lot than are heifers. The females are often restless for three 
or four days every three weeks on account of their periods of 
heat. For this reason it is objectionable to have even a few
-P-A-G-E-227
  
CHOOSING FOR BEEF 199 
heifers in with a lot of steers as they disturb the steers at such 
times. Furthermore, too, the market discriminates against 
heifer beef, and the butcher will not pay as much for a drove 
of heifers as he will a lot of steers. 
General characteristics of beef cattle 
In choosing feeding cattle one should note carefully their 
general appearance. The form, the quality, the condition, the 
uniformity, and the age are each important, and should re- 
ceive due consideration. 
Form of the feeder.—In form the feeder in general should 
resemble a brick set on edge. It should fill out a parallelogram. 
The top and bottom lines should be parallel. The shoulders 
and chest should be almost as wide as the hips and rump. 
Feeders should be “blocky,” indicating compactness and 
squareness of form. Those with long bodies are termed 
“rangy,” while those with long legs showing too little depth and 
fullness of body are termed “‘leggy,’’ both of which are objection- 
able in a feeder. Steers standing high from the ground, light 
in the flanks, and shallow in the heart girth rarely make good 
feeders. 
The quality of the feeder. — Quality in feeders is determined 
in the same way as in dairy cattle, that is, by a soft, mellow 
hide, silky hair, and a fine bone. The condition of the skin is 
thought to be an important indication as to the probable feed- 
ing qualities of a steer. If the skin is mellow and elastic to 
the touch, it indicates good “handling.” Animals possessed of 
such skins usually fatten rapidly, whereas those with heavy 
stiff skins often fatten slowly. 
The food influences the handling to a marked degree. When 
liberally fed, especially on oily laxative foods, the skin is soft 
and elastic and the hair usually silky and fine. On the other. 
hand, if scantily fed or with improper foods, the skin often 
becomes tightly attached to the body, and it feels dry 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  
  200 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and paper-like. Feeders possessed of rough, coarse hair, 
tight, harsh skin, rough, heavy bones with coarse joints, 
prominent hips, and rough, open shoulders are objectionable 
as feeders. 
Condition of the feeder. — In inspecting a lot of cattle with 
a view to choosing feeders, it is important to note their condition 
in respect to thrift and fleshiness. The indications of thrift 
are a good coat of silky hair; soft, pliable skin; a clean and 
mild eye; absence of discharge from the nostrils; and the 
dung or excreta of proper consistency, neither too loose nor too 
hard and dry. Thriftiness is of much importance if steers are 
to make economical and profitable beef-producing animals. 
Other things being equal, the thinner the steer at the time of 
beginning the feeding operations, the more rapid and the more 
economical as well as the more profitable the gains will be pro- 
viding, of course, that the animal is thrifty and that he has 
not been stunted in his growth. If the animal has been 
stunted, it is likely to prove a disappointment in the feed lot. 
Uniformity among feeders. — Cattle chosen for feeding pur- 
poses should be of uniform age, color, type, breeding, condi- 
tion, and quality. While such uniformity will not add to their 
ability to take on flesh or to make economical gains, yet it 
will add very materially to their general appearance when on 
the market. Such a lot of fat steers will command a much 
higher price than a similar lot of mixed colors, or of mixed 
types, or of mixed breeding, or even of mixed ages. 
Detail characters of beef cattle 
Beef cattle are as a rule not so well trained as are dairy 
cattle, and it is not so possible to handle them effectively, 
yet a consideration of details is essential if one is to make a 
success of choosing animals to feed for beef production. 
The head is usually considered a good index in the choice of 
a feeder. It should be broad and short, as such accompanies a
-P-A-G-E-229
  
CHOOSING FOR BEEF 201 
low-set, thick, and wide body; whereas a long, slim face is usually 
associated with a long, slim body. The face and cheeks should 
be full and deep with a broad, strong lower jaw. The nostrils 
should be large, indicating that there is an abundant lung 
capacity. The eyes should be large, prominent, and mild, in- 
dicating a quiet temperament. The feeder should be quiet, as 
a restless, nervous animal usually proves unsatisfactory. The 
forehead should be somewhat prominent and covered with a 
mass of wavy hair. The ear should be of medium size, pointed, 
and covered inside and out with fine silky hair, and should be 
neatly attached to the head. If horns are present, they should 
be of fine texture and free from coarseness. 
The neck should be short and thick, tapering gradually from 
the shoulders to the head. It should be neatly attached to the 
head and smoothly blended with the shoulder. 
The fore-quarters. — The shoulders should be well laid in, 
smoothly covered with flesh, compact, and blending neatly with 
the body. The crops or withers should be full, thick, and broad. 
Both shoulders and crops should be covered uniformly with 
flesh. Rough, angular shoulders, unevenly covered with flesh, 
are among the most common defects of feeding cattle. 
The body. — The chest should be wide, deep, and full, with light 
development of brisket, yet sufficient to fill out the squareness 
of the body. Narrow-chested animals are as a rule poor feeders. 
The ribs should be well sprung and long, giving an abundance 
of room for the vital organs, such as lungs and heart, and to 
provide large digestive capacity. The back should be broad 
and straight from the shoulder to the tail-head and covered with 
thick, even flesh. The loin should be wide and joining the 
body to the hind-quarters, with little or no departure from a 
straight line. 
The hind-quarters. — As a whole the hind-quarters in the 
feeder should be wide, long,and deep. The hips should be wide 
and in proportion with the other parts, but not prominent. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
202 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
rump should be long from the hips to the tail-head, with pin- 
bones and thurls rather high and wide, but not prominent. The 
rump should be level and free from hollowness. The thighs 
should be full and fleshed well down to the hock, with twist full. 
The fat steer. — In choosing a fat steer, one must keep in mind 
the demands of the butchers. They desire a steer to dress with 
a relatively small percentage of offal; with a relatively large 
percentage of meat in the region of the valuable cuts; and an 
animal that is in the proper condition to slaughter, that is, 
neither over nor under fed. Fullness at the base of the tongue 
and just in front of the point of the shoulder, a full twist, a 
large mellow cod (scrotum), a full, thick flank that stands out 
and rolls as the animal walks, fullness at the tail-head and along 
the rump, indicate that degree of fatness essential to the highest 
quality of beef.

CHAPTER IX 
FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE 
Prruaps no other question in connection with the propagation 
and care of farm animals has received so much consideration as 
that of feeding the dairy cow. Many and difficult are the prob- 
lems involved. To catalogue and discuss them all would require 
a work larger than this manual. It is not, therefore, in this 
connection, proposed to enter into an elaborate discussion, but 
only to call attention to some of the more important items in 
connection with the most successful practice. 
FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR MILK 
The quantity of food required by a milking cow depends on 
many factors, chief of which are the kind of food, the quantity 
of milk yielded, the quality of the milk, as well as the individual- 
ity, the weight and age of the animal. 
We have already observed, in connection with feeding the 
horse, that foods vary widely in the amount of energy they con- 
tain. In addition to this they also vary greatly in their in- 
fluence upon milk secretion; that is to say, certain foods act 
favorably on the secreting glands, whereas other foods tend 
towards the production of fat. The exact'action of the foods in- 
fluencing secretion is not understood, nor is their ultimate effect: 
upon the animal definitely known. Chief among the foods 
tending to economize milk production are succulent foods, such 
as green forage crops, silage, and roots; by-products such as 
bran, brewers’ grains, and dried distillers’ grains, and the legu- 
minous hays, such as clover and alfalfa. 
203

  204 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The quantity of food which the milking cow requires will be 
influenced by the amount of milk which she yields. 
taken into account by Wolff and Lehman in their standard. 
Thus we notice that a 1000-pound cow yielding 11 pounds of 
milk daily requires 25 pounds of dry-matter, whereas one yield- 
ing 22 pounds of milk per day requires 29 pounds of dry-matter 
in her ration : — This was 
Wolff-Lehman standard, showing the amount of food required per 1000 
pounds live weight for the growing and the mature cow yielding varying 
quantities of milk

much criticism by investigators in the United States, who feel 
that they call for more protein than is needed, especially by 
those animals giving a rather large flow of milk rather poor in 
butter-fat. These investigators object to the fact that the 
standards do not take into account the quality as well as the 
quantity of the milk.

The Holstein-Friesian breed of dairy cattle originated in Holland. While the 
Jersey is noted for the quality of milk, the Holstein is noted for the quantity or 
the large flow of milk. It is often spoken of as “the milk cow.” In size they 
are the largest dairy breed, mature bulls weighing 1700 to 2200 pounds, the 
cows 1400 to 1800 pounds. The color is black and white. In America this 
breed is very popular for milk production to supply the cities. 
The quality of the milk as well as the quantity bas an in- 
fluence on the amount of food required by a milking cow. For 
example, the daily production of 22 pounds of 3 per cent 
milk involves the elaboration of approximately 2.5 pounds 
of milk solids, whereas if the milk contained 6 per cent fat, it
-P-A-G-E-234
  206 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
would require approximately 3 pounds of milk solids, or an actual 
secretion of one-half pound more solid matter in the milk. Thus 
the cow yielding the 6 per cent milk would require more food 
than the cow giving only 3 per cent milk. 
Haecker has conducted many experiments in an endeavor to 
gain some knowledge of the relation between the percentage of 
fat in the milk and the food required to produce the same. 
From these experiments he has calculated the nutrients — 
protein, carbohydrates, and fat — required for the production 
of a given amount of fat, and using this as a basis, has con- 
structed standards for milk production :—

To illustrate the method of using the table to determine the 
amount of food required in milk production, choose the case of a 
1000-pound cow yielding 22 pounds of milk daily. Let us as- 
sume that in one case it contains 3 per cent fat and in a second 
that it contains 6 per cent.

Thus we see that even though the flow was 22 pounds in either 
ease, the food required is much greater in the case of the milk 
rich in fat. By comparing these with the Wolff-Lehman stand- 
ards we note that they are approximately the same, except in the 
case of the protein. According to Haecker the protein required, 
even in the 6 per cent milk,is much less than that called for in 
the Wolff-Lehman standard.
-P-A-G-E-236
  208 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
While no doubt some such formal standard as the Wolff- 
Lehman or the Haecker should be followed in calculating the 
amount of food required for milk production, yet it is well to 
remember that there are many difficulties encountered in feeding 
dairy cattle that standards cannot decide. Chief among these 
are the digestibility of the food and the individuality of the ani- 
mal. Our methods of arriving at the digestibility of foods are 
crude, and foods vary widely in their digestibility,and either of _ 
these difficulties may seriously interfere with such close figuring 
as is recommended in the Haecker standards; that is to say, the 
digestive values assigned the foods may easily be so erroneous as 
to offset any saving that seemingly occurs from such calcula- 
tion. 
The individuality of the cow is a factor which standards can- 
not take into account. Cows vary widely in the amount of food 
they will consume for the production of milk, some requiring 
twice as much food to produce 
a given product as others. 
Some hold that this variation 
is due to the fact that the cow 
will consume the feed, though 
she does not need it, and that 
by limiting her ration she can 
often be made to produce at 
a profit. That there is a vast

for a given product must not 
be lost sight of if one is to succeed in the dairy business. 
The age of the animal also has an influence on the amount of 
food required for milk production. This subject has also been 
investigated by Haecker. His experiments show that the heifer 
requires considerably more nutrients for the production of a 
given amount of fat than the mature cow. From these experi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-237

ments he constructed a standard similar to the one for mature 
cows: —

To illustrate how these differ from the mature cow we will 
take the same example, that of a heifer weighing 1000 pounds 
and yielding 22 pounds of 3 and 6 per cent milk. While a 
heifer might not weigh as much as this, the figuring is on a per- 
centage basis and the results will be the same.

According to this standard, the heifer needs considerably more 
nutrients than the mature cow, and in the case of high produc- 
tion calls for more nutrients than the Wolff-Lehman standards 
provide. This is due to the fact that she needs nutrients in 
building up her own body as well as for the production of milk. 
It is worthy of note, however, that in all these cases the Wolff- 
Lehman ratio is much more narrow than the Haecker ratio. 
Feeding-standards merely guides. — From the foregoing discus- 
sion of the food requirement for milk it must be apparent that 
while one should use a standard, it should be considered only as 
a guide and be modified to meet the conditions, such as the indi- 
viduality of the animal and the prices of foods. It is not prac- 
ticable to attempt to follow standards with strict mathematical 
accuracy, any more than to follow them slavishly with fer- 
tilizers or with quantities of seed per acre. 
EFFECT OF FOOD ON COMPOSITION OF MILK 
Of all the problems connected with the feeding of dairy cattle, 
perhaps none has received more attention than the effect of food 
upon the composition and quality of the milk. There is a pre- 
vailing opinion among practical dairymen that one can improve 
the composition of the milk, particularly with respect to the per- 
centage of fat, by liberal feeding. This, however, is one of the
-P-A-G-E-239
  
FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE 211 
results that careful investigations have been trying to secure for 
the last three decades, and so far they have met with little or no 
success. 
It is asserted that the food may affect the milk in many 
ways, the two most important being its composition and its 
flavor. There are three ways in which the composition 
might be affected: First, by changing the proportion of water 
and total solid matter; second, by changing the proportion of 
fat, sugar, and proteids; and third, by changing the constitu- 
ents or consistency of the fat. 
Effect of food on total solids. — In the great siesiieniig of cases 
the conclusion of experiments is that no consistent relation 
seems to exist between the quantity or character of the food 
and the composition of the milk. In a few cases a temporary 
change occurred in the milk immediately after changing the 
food, but in most cases the milk soon returned to its normal 
composition. While in a very small number of experiments the 
milk appeared to undergo slight permanent change, yet one is 
forced to the conclusion that the quality of the milk cannot be 
changed at will by the feed. It would seem that the treatment 
of the cattle has a greater influence upon the character of the 
milk than does the food consumed. 
Effect of food on the percentage of fat.— The idea prevails 
that it is possible to feed fat into milk. This problem has been 
the subject of careful experimentation. After a painstaking 
perusal of the work one is forced to conclude that it is not pos- 
sible materially and permanently to increase or diminish the 
percentage of fat by changes in the amount and character of 
the food, providing, of course, that the animals receive sufficient 
nutrition in all cases. It may be possible with a cow that has 
been insufficiently fed and has never had a chance to develop, 
to feed her such.an abundance of rich milk-producing food as 
slightly and permanently to increase the percentage of fat in 
her milk; but beyond this we probably cannot go.

  212 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Food and flavor of milk. — It is definitely known that certain 
foods, especially if fed in large quantities, impart bad odors to 
the milk. Chief among the foods producing such deleterious 
effects are cabbage, turnips, onions, silage, wild leeks, and the 
like. It is held that such odors may be imparted to the milk in 
two ways: First, by transference through the animal, and 
second, by absorption from the air of the stable. Concerning 
many of these points we have little definite evidence, and 
there is great difference of opinion as to what odors are absorbed 
from the air and what are transferred through the animal. 
There can be little doubt, however, but that the feeding of certain 
foods before milking imparts certain flavors to the milk, and that 
such flavors are not detected when the food is given after milk- 
ing. It is advised particularly that silage be not fed just be- 
fore milking. 
Order of supplying food. — Because of the supposed ill effect 
of some foods in giving odors to the milk, the order of supplying 
certain of these foods assumes much importance. In the case 
of cabbage, turnips, and the like, it is perhaps best that they be 
fed after milking. In the case of hay, which is likely to contain 
more or less dust, it is perhaps best to feed this after milking 
also, and in either of these cases it would necessitate the feeding 
of grain first. Perhaps the ideal way, when the food is of such 
a nature to permit, is to feed the grain and succulent food to- 
gether, sprinkling the grain over the succulent food, and then 
when these are both cleaned up, to feed the hay. A good-order 
for the day’s work is as follows: In the morning milk first, then 
feed grain, then silage, clean stable, water, feed hay, groom the 
animals, then on pleasant days turn out for an hour or so. In 
the afternoon water, clean stables, feed grain, milk, feed silage, 
arrange bedding, and lastly feed some long hay. Sufficient 
attention is not given to the day’s program, in the dairy 
business. 
Effect of food on quantity of milk. — Occasionally the state-
-P-A-G-E-241

ment that we cannot increase the percentage of fat in the milk 
by feeding is taken to mean that we cannot increase the total 
fat yield. This, of course, is not true. We can very materially 
increase the total yield of fat by increasing the total flow of 
milk by liberal feeding. This is demonstrated on every hand. 
On the farms where no succulent food is fed during the winter 
and very little grain, it is well known that the cows will give a 
much larger flow when turned to pasture in the spring. On the 
average the percentage of fat will remain the same. 
WATERING THE MILKING COW 
The milch cow requires a liberal supply of water. Shenot only 
has the demands of her body to meet, but must supply that in 
the milk as well. When we recall that cows have yielded over 
129 pounds of milk in a single day, we can see the urgent need of 
a large supply of water. The question is often raised as to meth- 
ods of watering: whether to make provisions for a constant 
supply of water, or to supply the animal at certain intervals, two 
or three times daily. It has been fairly well proved that cattle 
provided with water constantly give a slightly larger yield than 
when watered twice daily, though the difference ‘is not marked. 
This observation has led to the placing of small troughs or vessels 
in the stable immediately in front of the animals (Fig. 78). 
If these vessels can be kept clean and free from odor, the practice 
is a good one. In many instances, however, these individual 
watering devices are traps of filth and foul-smelling water, and 
produce anything but good results. 
There are two factors that must not be lost sight of in water- 
ing the milking cow: regularity and temperature of water in 
winter. Whatever method of watering is employed, the animal 
should be watered regularly and uniformly. When we recall the 
large amount of water necessary to meet the needs of the high- 
producing cow, it becomes apparent that she should not be com- 
pelled_to drink ice-cold water. There are many objections to  
-P-A-G-E-242
  214 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
such practice; in the first place it requires much food to heat this 
water up to the body temperature, and the animal will not 
drink the required amount. Such large drafts of cold water may

cause indigestion and in some cases may lead to abortion. To 
take the chill off drinking water in winter is now an accepted 
practice with progressive dairymen. 
FEEDING THE MILKING COW 
Since the quantity of milk produced by a cow depends largely 
on the amount and character of the feed supplied, it is of the 
utmost importance that the feeding be given careful considera- 
tion. Developing the milking cow calls for skill second to none 
other among farm animals. The milking cow should be fed 
liberally, frequently, and regularly, the amount given being regu-
-P-A-G-E-243
  
FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE 215 
lated by the size of the animal and by the quantity as well as the 
quality of her milk. We may say, in general, that a good dairy 
cow in full flow should receive approximately two and one-half 
pounds of dry-matter for each hundred pounds of weight. Of 
this, at least. one-half to two-thirds should be digestible matter. 
Cows giving very large yields may be fed considerably larger 
quantities to advantage, while the low-producers should receive 
less. The reader may recur to the general discussion of food 
requirements as detailed on pages 203 to 210. 
Feeding dairy cattle naturally divides itself into two parts: 
the summer period when the cows are at pasture, and the winter 
period when they are stabled and fed their entire ration. 
Summer feeding of dairy cattle. — Pasture is one of the essen- 
tials of successful dairy farming. The favorable influence of 
early spring pasture on the secretion of milk is well known. The 
flow is materially increased, as is the total yield of fat, though 
the percentage of fat is perhaps not materially altered. True, 
some years the percentage of fat seems to increase, but other 
years it decreases in the same animal; and the food is prob- 
ably not the cause. 
As a rule, in the early part of the pasture season, the cows will 
obtain sufficient food from the pastures alone, but later in the 
season it will often be necessary to supplement the pasture. 
This may be done by soiling, — cutting the forage and feeding it 
to the cattle green, — with silage, or with grain. 
Experiments seem to indicate that the feeding of grain to cows 
on pasture is profitable only when there is scarcity of pasturage. 
In fact, they will consume but little while the pasture is abun- 
dant and nutritious. It would seem wise, however, in case the 
animals eat it, to provide a few pounds of wheat bran or bran 
and oats mixed particularly in the case of heavy milkers, as 
this will insure maximum production. 
Protecting cows from flies. — The marked falling off in the milk 
flow of the dairy cow in the late summer and fall is looked upon  
-P-A-G-E-244
  216 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
as unavoidable and is attributed to the worry of the stock by 
flies. This conclusion is not borne out by the experimental data 
available. Many experiments have been conducted to deter- 
mine to what extent the worry caused by the flies affects the yield 
of milk and fat. In these experiments the flies were excluded 
from the animals at intervals and a careful record kept of the 
production. These records show that the flies had very little if 
any effect upon the yield either of milk or fat. The failure to 
provide an abundance of succulent forage to supplement the 
parched pastures, thus compelling the animals to graze over 
large areas in the hot sun, seems to be the principal factor in 
causing a decreased production in the later summer. 
Winter feeding of dairy cattle. — Winter feeding is the most 
expensive, and the profit to be derived from a dairy cow will 
depend, in a large part, upon the economy of the winter ration. 
This does not mean that she should be fed sparingly; on the 
other hand, the good dairy cow should be fed abundantly 
with a variety of nutritious feeds. Feed a variety whenever 
possible. A good dairy cow should make economical use of 
seven to ten pounds of grain 
per day, and fifteen to twenty 
pounds of dry forage, or better 
still, thirty to forty pounds of 
succulent food and five to ten 
pounds of dry forage or hay, 
the exact amounts to be varied 
to meet conditions. 
ee eM occa SOPSTEIN: FRTEBTAN CO Grain, or concentrated feeds. 
Owned by John Arfman. — The more common grains fed 
to dairy cattle are the cereals 
—corn, oats, wheat, barley, and rye — and the mill refuse, of 
which there is an almost endless variety upon the market. 
The amount of grain that can be fed with profit to a dairy 
cow will depend on the price of the food, the yield of the cow, 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  
FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE 217 
and the price obtained for her products. Some have suggested 
the feeding of as many pounds of grain per day as the cow 
produces pounds of butter-fat per week. In determining the 
amount and kind of grain it is necessary to take into account 
the forage that is to go with it. For example, in many dairies 
it is felt that bran may be replaced ton for ton by carefully 
cured alfalfa hay, or by five tons of pea-vine silage when not 
too succulent. 
Dry forage. —The more common dry forage crops fed to 
dairy cattle are clover, alfalfa, or mixed hays and corn stalks. 
Occasionally pure timothy hay is fed, though this is not to be 
recommended, particularly if cut late. Straws of the various 
small grains are also used, but they are even more worthless as 
a dairy cow feed than is timothy hay. Hay cut early is more 
valuable ton for ton, though the yield obtained per acre will 
not be so great. It is preferable to feed the hay long, if 
fed in connection with silage. The exact amount of dry 
forage that should be fed cannot be stated, as it will depend 
on the amount of grain and whether or not silage is being 
used. Let the rule be to feed all the hay the animal will eat 
with relish. 
Succulent feeds. — Some kind of succulent food should be 
fed the dairy cow during her entire lactation period. The 
common succulent foods used in feeding dairy cattle are silage, 
roots, or tubers. Silage is preferable, but if the herd is not 
large enough to warrant the construction of a silo, roots make 
a good substitute. The amount of succulence it is profitable 
to feed will depend much on the attendant conditions. Thirty 
to forty pounds serve most conditions. If the supply is limited, 
it is perhaps best to make it last throughout the winter period ; 
that is to say, if one has enough succulent food to feed twenty 
pounds throughout the season or forty pounds for half the 
season, it would be preferable to feed the twenty throughout 
the season. This again might be modified by conditions; for
-P-A-G-E-246
  218 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
example, if one had a few cows only and fed but twenty pounds 
per head and day, the silage would be likely to spoil on top, 
in which case it would be necessary to feed it faster. 
There are many ways of procuring succulent foods, such as 
preserving green foods in the silo, raising of roots and tubers, 
procuring refuse from the breweries, distilleries, and sugar fac- 
tories, and soiling. 
Silage. — Green food preserved in the silo is coming to be a 
very common succulence for the dairy cow. While there are 
many green plants, such as alfalfa, clover, cowpea vines, and 
the like, preserved in this way, yet corn is by far the most im- 
portant silage crop. No other plant will furnish nearly so much 
silage per acre as corn. All silage contains a very high per- 
centage of water, and for this reason is bulky. As a succulent 
food for milking cows, good corn silage is hard to improve on. 
It is very palatable, readily digestible, and stimulates the flow 
of milk second only to grass. 
Roots and tubers. — When the construction of a silo is not 
convenient, one can procure a very good succulent food by 
raising roots and tubers. While there are many roots and 
tubers, such as potatoes, beets, flat turnips, rutabagas, and the 
like, that may be grown, mangels are by far the most important 
root-crop as a succulent food for cattle. These roots all possess 
a very high percentage of water, even more than silage. As a 
succulent food for the milking cow they are excellent, being 
palatable, almost entirely digestible, and stimulating the flow 
of milk. While the amount that may be fed varies according 
to conditions, the same as in silage, one may feed from 35 to 50 
pounds daily per 1000 pounds of live weight. 
Soiling. — As we have already seen, soiling consists of cut- 
ting green crops and feeding them fresh. Successful and 
economical soiling means furnishing to the milking cow a sup- 
ply of green forage during the growing season. It means that 
crops and areas must be so arranged that one green crop will
-P-A-G-E-247
  
FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE 219 
succeed another during the entire season. There are many 
advantages of soiling, such as increased food production from a 
‘given area, providing three times that of pasturage ; less waste, 
as the cattle are not constantly tramping and lying on the 
forage; greater variety of food, as the succession of crops 
provides many changes; increased milk and butter production 
when prices are high, as in the fall; less discomfort of animals, 
as they are fed in the cool stables; and less fencing required. 
One great objection is the increased labor; such as preparing 
the soil for the crops, seeding every few days, cutting the crop 
of green material and hauling to stables,—the food being 
green and heavy, —and the extra labor of carrying for the 
cattle in the stable. 
Soiling crops vary widely in their composition and as a suc- 
culent food for the milking cow. As a rule, they contain more 
waste than silage. They are very palatable, readily digestible, 
and stimulate the flow of milk. It is customary to feed some- 
what larger quantities of soiling crops than of silage, 60 pounds 
being considered a fair daily allowance for a 1000-pound cow. 
In addition she must have her grain ration, the same as when 
silage is fed, and a small allowance of hay of good quality, 
clover, or alfalfa when possible. Instead of choosing ‘coarse 
grains, such as bran, distillers’ dried grains, and the like, it is 
preferable to feed the more concentrated, such as middlings, 
oil meal, corn meal, gluten meal, and the like. 
When soiling is practiced, the area required to the cow and 
the rotation of crops are interesting problems. Both vary widely 
in different sections of the country, but on the average one acre 
should support two cows, when grain and some hay is fed in 
connection, as suggested. While the crops to be used in rota- 
tion vary as does the time of planting, yet the following examples 
will serve as a basis to be varied according to conditions :—

FEEDING FOR HIGH PRODUCTION 
Those who are raising breeding animals are often interested 
in high records of production. As we have already seen, the 
major dairy breeders’ associations — Holsteins, Jersey, Guern- 
sey, and Ayrshire — encourage this by establishing registers in 
which only those animals that make certain records may be 
recorded. The feeding of a cow in order that she may make 
an “advanced registry record,” as it is often called, is a 
different problem from that of feeding a cow in a commercial 
dairy. In this case, all is sacrificed for a high record of pro- 
duction. The high record serves as an advertisement, and the 
breeder is enabled to sell his animals at a much higher price 
than otherwise. 
While the methods of feeding as well as the food used by the 
different breeders vary widely (in fact no two are the same), 
yet the general procedure is somewhat as follows: have the cow 
very fat at calving time. To do this she should be dried off 
some time before calving and receive extra care and feéd. It 
is true that a very fat cow is more subject at calving time to 
difficulties, such as milk fever, garget, difficult parturition, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-251
       FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE 223 
the like, but these will be cared for by a painstaking and fa- 
miliar attendant. The argument here is that the cow will use 
this extra body fat to repair the waste of the body, thus en- 
abling her to use a larger part of her food in the elaboration of 
milk, some going so far as to say that a part of the extra fat is 
used in the manufacture of the milk. While just what processes 
take place in the animal’s body are not known, yet it is true 
that such an animal will produce more than as if she were in 
average condition. 
When extreme high production is sought, the cow is fed and 
milked four times daily. The time varies somewhat, but the 
more common is 5 a.m. and 11 a.m.; 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. The 
reason for choosing these hours is that the 5 a.m. and 5 P.M. 
feeding and milking are at the same time the rest of the herd 
is being fed and milked. Everything about the stable should 
be quiet, and the milking carefully and well done (see page 260). 
The feeds composing the rations vary widely, no two breeders 
using the same. In all cases, however, the secret of success is 
variety. Sometimes the grain part of the ration is composed 
of a half dozen or more different kinds of grains; the dry 
forage of two or more kinds of hay and three or four kinds of 
succulent foods. The amount given is limited only by the 
appetite of the cow. 
FEEDING THE HEIFER 
As the time of calving approaches, the feeding of the heifer 
should receive careful attention. Do not feed too stimulating 
or decayed foods, as they are likely to cause abortion. Clean 
sweet clover or mixed hay or corn stalks and corn silage or roots 
with a small allowance of grain, such as ground oats, bran, 
shorts, or corn, will prove very efficient. Just previous to calv- 
ing it is best to discontinue the feeding of grain, or at most 
only a couple of pounds per day, and not increase again till the 
heifer freshens. Immediately after calving, a warm thin gruel   
       
    
  
-P-A-G-E-252
  224 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
consisting of oatmeal or bran should be given. Feed sparingly 
with rather loosening foods for a few days or until the dangers 
of milk fever are over. Then increase the ration gradually until 
she is receiving a full feed. 
It must be remembered that the heifer is doing double duty: 
in addition to elaborating milk, she is growing rapidly, and if 
bred, she must supply the fetus; 
hence the importance of extra 
care and, above all, liberal feed- 
ing. To meet the requirements 
of her growing body, the devel- 
~oping fetus, and the milk a good 
supply of protein must be fur- 
nished. Protein the young

N.Y. ing cow. The treatment given 
the heifer will largely determine 
the usefulness of the future cow. Heavy feeding should con- 
tinue throughout the entire lactation period, which should be 
extended as long as possible, for the developing of a persistent 
milking habit is favored by a long continuance of the first 
lactation period.

BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 
Tue breeding of dairy cattle offers a greater field of opera- 
tion than any other in connection with the propagation of 
farm animals. Perhaps in no other class is variation so great 
or improvement so easily accomplished as in the improvement 
of dairy animals, providing proper methods are used. The in- 
creasing population is making increasing demands for milk and 
its products, — butter and cheese ;— and while the supplying 
of this demand, particularly in our large cities, is a very com- 
plex problem, improvement in the production of dairy cattle 
cannot be said to be a difficult task. In the past we have bred 
dairy cattle without regard to their record of production. In 
fact records of production were wanting, as none such were kept. 
True, we have kept pedigrees of our dairy cattle for many 
generations, but these pedigrees tell us only: the color, the 
date of birth, the owner and his address, the sire and the dam, 
none of which supplies us with information as to the merits 
of the cow. What is equally true, we have estimated pro- 
duction of dairy cattle from time immemorable by saying one 
cow gives so many quarts, another so many quarts more, and 
still another so many quarts less; but such estimation is almost 
worthless because of the great variation in the yield of in- 
dividual cows from day to day. Perhaps two days a week a 
cow will yield 15 quarts, the other five days only 10 quarts; and 
in our estimation we are likely to remember the 15 quarts and 
227
-P-A-G-E-256
  228 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
forget the 10 quarts. Again, for many years we have kept 
a more or less accurate record of the show-yard career of our 
leading dairy animals, but this in turn gives us no information 
as to their producing powers, for it is now well known that ani- 
mals with brilliant show-yard careers are not among the best 
producers.

The Ayrshire dairy cattle originated in the county of Ayr, Scotland, where they 
are used chiefly in cheese-making. They are trim and neat in appearance. 
In weight the cows run about 1000 pounds and the bulls 1500 pounds. The 
color includes red, brown, and white. 
As has been noted in the chapter on general breeding, 
variation is the basis of improvement. Without variation 
there can be no improvement, and when great variation exists 
much improvement is possible. Dairy cows vary widely both 
in respect to the quantity and the quality of their milk. To
-P-A-G-E-257

illustrate the variation in the quantity, we may compare 
average production of all cows in the United States with two 
of the high-producing ones. It should be borne in mind that 
this is not a comparison of the poorest and the best, as we 
have no record of the poorest cows :—

From the table we note that the monthly record of our high- 
producing cows is approximately equal to the average yearly 
record of all cows in the United States. Colantha 4th’s Johanna 
yielded 27,432 pounds of milk in one year, or approximately 
eight times that of the average cow. 
MILK-RECORDS 
Record of performance among dairy cattle constitutes the 
only method of determining their value. Without such records, 
we would not be able to choose the very high- or the very low- 
producing, or the profitable from the unprofitable animals. At  
-P-A-G-E-258
230 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
present, many dairy herds possess cattle producing at a loss — 
not yielding sufficient milk to pay for the food consumed — 
yet in the absence of accurate records the fact goes unobserved 
and the owner does not know the profitable from the unprofit- 
able animals. No person is able to go into a herd of ten cows 
and pick out all the best by examination. Records are abso- 
lutely necessary to determine profit and loss. 
Method of keeping records. — Records are more easily kept 
than is generally supposed. The time and cost of keeping a 
record of the amount of milk and butter-fat yielded by each 
cow is quite insignificant, especially when compared with the 
value of such records. The materials needed are a pair of scales, 
a hand Babcock tester with outfit, and a blank milk-sheet. 
The scale should be graduated to tenths of a pound instead of 
ounces, as the records are much more easily added. Chatillon’s 
Improved Circular Spring Balances are ordinarily used. 
The scales should be hung in a convenient place and each 
cow’s milk weighed separately and set down on a Record- 
Sheet, similar to table on p. 231. 
Once each month the milk from each cow should be tested 
for the percentage of butter-fat. To do this, one should take a 
careful sample of the milk for two successive days. The sample 
need not be large, but the quantity should be in proportion 
to the flow. One-half pint saved from the two days’ milk- 
ing is sufficient. This should be placed in a jar and covered 
to prevent evaporation. In warm weather it is necessary to 
put some sort of preservative into the milk, otherwise it will 
sour, and in that case cannot be tested. For each cow there 
should be a jar with her name pasted upon it, thus avoiding any 
possibility of getting the samples mixed. By placing the per- 
centage of fat thus obtained on the record-sheet beneath the 
flow, one has a complete record of each animal each month. By 
multiplying the total milk by the per cent of fat, one gets the 
total amount of fat. This completes the record for the month.

  232 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The length of time required to weigh the milk and take 
the sample will depend much on the activity of the one 
doing the work. On the average it will require less than one- 
half minute a day for each cow to weigh the milk and set the 
weight down on the record-sheet. On the two consecutive 
days that the samples are taken, it will require the same time 
daily to the cow as weighing and making the record. Then an 
hour or two once a month is all that is required to make the 
Babcock test for percentage of fat. With this length of time, 
one can obtain a reasonably accurate record of the performance 
of every cow in his herd. 
Value of milk-records.— The highest degree of success 
cannot be attained unless we know the production of each 
individual cow. In addition, such records serve a much larger 
usefulness because they enable us to mate the animals more 
judiciously. Not only are the low-producers unprofitable in 
themselves, but in the absence of a record of their production, 
they are propagated, and their offspring in turn prove un- 
profitable. 
TESTING MILK FOR BUTTER-FAT 
The materials needed in testing milk for butter-fat are a 
centrifugal tester, test-bottles, a 17.6 c.c. (cubic centimeter) 
pipette to measure the milk, a 17.5 c.c. acid measure, and sul- 
furic acid, all of which can be purchased for about five dollars 
from any dairy supply company (Fig. 77). They may be 
ordered of a hardware dealer. Sulfuric acid is sold at any 
drug store. 
Sampling the milk.— The milk to be tested should be 
thoroughly mixed just before sampling. To do this, pour back 
and forth between two vessels several times. With the pipette, 
measure out 17.6 c.c. of milk and place in the test-bottle. To 
do this, suck the milk up above the 17.6 c.c. mark. Quickly 
place the index finger over the upper end of the pipette, then 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 233 
by releasing the pressure allow the milk to run down to the 
17.6 ¢.c. mark. Place the point of the pipette into the test- 
. bottle neck, holding both pipette and bottle at an angle, then 
remove the finger to allow the milk to flow into the bottle. 
To be sure that every drop is out of the pipette blow through 
it into the test-bottle. The sampling should be done in dupli- 
cate to make sure of the results. 
Using the acid. — Much care should be exercised not to 
spill the sulfuric acid on the hands, clothing, or floor. Should 
any be accidentally spilled, pour on plenty of water, then add a 
little lime or baking soda. Always keep water and lime at 
hand for this purpose. 
After all the samples of milk to be tested have been meas- 
ured, the acid should be added. To do this, fill the acid meas- 
ure to the 17.5 c.c. mark and gradually pour into the test- 
bottle, holding the bottle in a slanting position. By turning 
the bottle the acid will carry down all particles of milk left in 
the long neck. Hold the bottle by the neck and give it a cir- 
cular motion for a few moments, thus mixing the milk and acid 
until no milk or clear acid is visible. The contents of the 
bottle should be dark colored and hot. Do not allow the bottle 
to stand too long before mixing or the test will not be clear. 
Whirling the bottles. —The bottles and machine should be 
hot; and if not a steam machine, use boiling water to warm up 
the machine. Place the bottles in the machine so that each 
will have another directly opposite to keep the machine in 
balance. Whirl fiveminutes. Then stop, and with the pipette 
or cup with small spout, add hot water to each bottle until the 
contents come up to the bottom of the neck. Whirl two 
minutes. Add hot water sufficient to bring the top of the fat 
nearly to the top of the graduation on the neck of the bottle. 
Whirl one minute. The fat should form a clear column free 
from black or white patches in the neck of the bottle. 
Reading the percentage of fat.— Keep the fat. warm. Hold

the bottle by the upper end of the neck, letting it hang in a 
perpendicular position on a level with the eye. Read the mark 
at the top and bottom of the column of fat. The difference 
between these is the percentage of fat in the milk. For example, 
if the top reading is 8.2 and the bottom 5.0, then the milk tests 
3.2 per cent. 
Much care should be exercised in cleaning the test-bottles 
as they should be perfectly free from dirt when used. 
TESTING ASSOCIATIONS 
In those sections of the country in which dairying is extensively 
practiced, the forming of testing associations will prove very 
advantageous. Cow-testing associations are organizations of 
farmers having for their object the determination of the pro- 
duction of the individual cow in the herd. While the methods 
of procedure of these associations vary widely in different 
localities, yet the following plan gives a general idea and may 
be modified to suit the conditions. 
General plan. — A number of dairymen, twenty to twenty- 
five, having a total of 300 to 600 cows, effect an organiza- 
tion, elect officers, adopt a constitution and by-laws, and 
give the officers power to employ a man to do the testing. 
This tester visits each of the herds once a month, weighs the 
milk of each cow for a period of twenty-four hours, takes — 
samples of the same and tests for percentage of fat. In some 
cases the tester weighs the feed of each cow and figures the 
cost of the ration. The tester makes a complete record of the 
amount of milk, the percentage of fat and total fat, and the food 
consumed, for each cow in the herd, leaves a copy of this record 
with the dairyman, and proceeds to the next herd, to return 
again in about one month. In addition he gives all the helpful 
suggestions possible, such as the successful practices of the 
other members of the association. The entire cost to the
-P-A-G-E-264
  236 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
dairyman is approximately one dollar per cow in addition te 
boarding and providing passage for the tester. 
RECORDS OF PERFORMANCE AND OF BREEDING 
In order to mate dairy cattle judiciously, it is absolutely 
essential that we know not only something of the performance 
of the animals thus mated, but the records of production of 
their ancestors as well. Such records enable us to mate the best 
with the best, and in so doing improve the strain with which we 
are working. 
In all breeding operations, it must be remembered that like 
produces like, with the trend of the race downward. That is to 
say, the offspring will resemble the parents in general, though on 
the average they will be slightly inferior. While on the average 
the offspring are inferior to their parents and while in general 
they resemble their parents, yet individual offspring will vary 
widely, some far superior to their parentage, while others will be 
equally as inferior. This is where the successful breeder is 
able to mold the destiny of his herd by selection. Possessing 
a record of the production of each individual, inferior and superior 
alike, he mates the superior to the superior and discards the in- 
ferior. 
In this connection it may be well to call attention to a rather 
widespread but incorrect idea. We have certain breeds of 
dairy cattle that are recognized as heavy milkers but rather 
low testers, and we also have high testing breeds but rather light 
milkers. Many a breeder of daity cattle has fallen into the 
grievous error of thinking that if he mates a heavy milker with 
a high tester, the offspring should give a fairly heavy flow of 
milk with a liberally high test. Such breeders have forgotten 
that the drag of the race is downward, and that by crossing a 
heavy milker but low tester on a high tester but light milker, 
that on the average the offspring will be both a light milker 
and a low tester.
-P-A-G-E-265
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 237 
The individual animal the unit of improvement. —In the 
improvement of dairy cattle by breeding, the individual must 
be considered as the unit. This applies to sire and dam 
alike. The longer the line of high-producing ancestry, the more 
certain are we that the offspring in turn will be a high producer. 
The importance of this individual record of performance backed 
by ancestors with similar records cannot be overestimated. 
Having satisfied one’s self as to the individual excellency of 
both sire and dam, he must even then be prepared to accept 
some low-producers, for such is the law of chance, which accom- 
panies all breeding operations. One may, however, rest as- 
sured that on the average the offspring of individuals thus care- 
fully selected will be equal to their parents, and that he will be 
rewarded by obtaining a few that will exceed the records of 
their parents. 
PLAN OF BREEDING 
If one is to succeed in breeding dairy cattle, he must proceed 
according to some well-adapted plan. Before deciding on 
a plan, one should familiarize himself with the details of the 
business. This can best be done by visiting and making a study 
of dairy farms both successful and unsuccessful. Compare all 
farms thus observed, note the difference, the causes that led 
to success on one, and to failure on the other. No sugges- 
tions can be given as to a working plan, as all will depend 
on the local conditions. The intending breeder should take 
into account his likes and dislikes. Some may prefer the heavy 
milking breeds, others the high butter-fat-producing breeds. 
It should be kept clearly in mind, whatever the class or breed 
chosen, that none but superior cattle are to be considered if 
highest success is to be attained. 
Raise the heifer calves from the best cows. — Many dairymen 
are not raising their heifer calves. They are sold for veal, 
whether from high- or low-producing cows. Near large cities 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  238 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the dairies are so crowded for room that there is often not 
space enough to raise these calves; yet when possible provision 
should be made for perpetuating the high-producing cows. 
The practice of buying all the cows has a tendency to lower 
rather than raise the average production of the herd, for the 
reason that few of the kigh-producing cows are for sale, and the 
dairyman is obliged to take rather inferior producers to supply 
his customers with milk. 
Coéperative breeding. — A very successful method of improv- 
ing the dairy cattle of a community is to breed them on the 
coéperative plan. In the localities where cow-testing associa- 
tions exist, this is a very easy matter. It is also apparent that 
the formation of cow-breeding associations, in connection with 
cow-testing associations, would do much to advance the prog- 
ress of the dairy industry. Each association should have for 
its object the production and improvement of high-grade and 
pure-bred dairy cattle, and should be formed of breeders who 
possess the same class or breed of cattle. It would be the work 
of such an association to protect the interests of its members, 
provide suitable bulls each year for use on the cows owned by 
the members, advertise stock, attract buyers, hold meetings for 
discussion of cow-breeding matters, and educate the farmers of 
the locality to better methods of breeding, feeding, and develop- 
ing high-producing dairy cows. 
FORMATION OF THE DAIRY HERD 
Perhaps one of the most-discussed questions in the formation 
of a dairy herd is whether to begin with pure-bred or grade 
cows. By purely bred animals are meant those that are re- 
corded in the herd books of their respective breeds; by grade 
is meant the produce of a pure-bred sire upon a native or com- 
mon dam. Opinions differ widely as to which is the more 
profitable. Pure-bred animals are much sought for breeding 
purposes; their offspring are therefore more valuable and com-
-P-A-G-E-267
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 239 
mand a higher price than do the offspring of grades. There 
fore, if the value of the calves is taken into consideration, a 
pure-bred herd is a more profitable one, other things being 
equal, than a grade herd. On the other hand, by the grading- 
up process, that is, by continually selecting and breeding the 
cows that are the best producers to a pure-bred bull, it is 
entirely possible and by no means difficult to establish a herd 
of grade cows that will equal in the production of milk any 
herd of pure-bred animals. If, therefore, milk-production alone 
is sought, a grade herd may produce as largely as a pure- 
bred; but if the offspring is taken into consideration, a purely 
bred herd certainly has an advantage over a grade herd of 
equal productive capacity. 
The enterprising and progressive owner will hardly be con- 
tent with grades only. In the beginning, his bull will be pure- 
bred; presently he will want a pure-bred cow to match, then 
one or two more. Thus he will be steadily and properly work- 
ing towards a pure-bred herd and gaining in knowledge and 
experience at the same time. This will be found a much 
better plan, especially with the beginner or those unaccustomed 
to handling registered stock, than to purchase a pure-bred 
herd in the beginning. 
GRADING-UP THE HERD 
We remarked just above that by the grading-up process it 
is entirely possible and by no means difficult to establish a 
herd of grade cows that will equal in the production of milk 
any herd of pure-bred animals. This may seem a bold state- 
ment, but it is the one that it is desired to impress on the 
average dairymen. While the methods of accomplishing this 
vary greatly, careful selection and judicious mating furnish 
the key to the situation. There are no secrets in herd im- 
provement. In this discussion it is proposed briefly to indicate 
the lines along which an attempt to breed up and improve a
-P-A-G-E-268
240 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
herd of common cattle is most likely to prove successful. For 
it must be remembered that the large majority of dairymen 
seeking to improve their herds must depend largely on the 
individual animals they have already on hand, as the basis from 
which to start the improvement. 
The first essential is a record of the performance of each 
cow comprising the herd. In herd improvement it is funda- 
mental, and without it advancement cannot be made. No 
one, not even the experienced dairymen, can afford to do this 
upon guesswork alone. 
The second essential is the selection of a suitable bull. Three 
factors in order of their importance are: his pedigree based 
upon a record of performance, his individuality, and his ability 
to get uniform offspring. Greatest improvement is not possible 
with any one of these factors wanting. 
The first generation.— If the sire has been well chosen, the 
calves in the first generation are likely to be an even and uni- 
form crop, even though their dams be of mixed breeding. If 
the sire be a pure-bred, the first crop of calves will be half-bloods. 
If convenient, all of the heifer calves should be retained. A 
great advantage in the rapid improvement of a herd of cows 
under this grading-up process is the ability to raise a large num- 
ber of individuals up to the time that they begin to produce, so 
that a greater number may be available from which to select. 
If often happens, however, that the circumstances of the owner 
do not admit of rearing a large number, and some selection 
must be made at the time of birth. 
Select heifer calves from high-producing dams. — If some 
calves must be discarded, owing to lack of facilities for rearing 
them, let it be those from the low-producing dams. Retain the 
heifers from the high-producing cows. This is in keeping with 
our law that “like produces like.” Some have recommended 
retaining the heifer calves from those cows that show variation, 
particularly toward improvement, basing their argument on 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 241 
the fact that such an animal is not likely to be prepotent, and 
that such being the case, the calves more nearly resemble the 
sire. There may be two objections to this. In the first place, 
animals that show much variation are as likely to vary toward 
the bad as toward the good; and in the second place, if the dam 
has at some time made a low record, as she probably has if she 
shows much improvement, it means that we are oftentimes 
selecting our heifer calf from a low-producing dam. Such a 
course is as likely to lead to failure as to success. There are 
many experiments and an abundance of experience going to 
show that greatest success is attained by retaining the heifers 
from the high-producing dams and discarding those from the 
low-producers. 
The second generation. — There are many perplexing questions 
arising in the second generation of this grading-up process. In 
the first place, there is the question of the sire. If the original 
sire was young at the time of his purchase, there will be a 
number of his half-blood offspring ready to breed while he is 
still in the height of his power. If the bull has proved a good 
one, the owner does not wish to sell him, and he does not feel 
able to buy another to breed the heifers. The owner is at a loss 
to know what to do, as he has heard much against the practice 
of in-breeding. In a majority of such cases, if the sire is vigor- 
ous, he is the very best bull to breed to a lot of high quality, 
uniform, and half-blood heifers, if it is desired to receive greater 
uniformity as well as greater average production, even though 
he be their own sire. On the other hand, suppose the owner 
wishes to change bulls and procures an animal equal in produc- 
tive capacity, but of slightly different type from the original sire. 
In all probability these second-generation calves, even though 
they are three-fourth blood, will not be nearly so uniform a crop 
as the first-generation or half-blood calves. Experience has 
shown that the second generation is not nearly so uniform as 
the first, and frequently shows little if any increase in average 
R
-P-A-G-E-270
  
242 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
production, although a few individuals may show marked 
improvement. This will prove the skill and patience of the 
breeder. 
Continued judicious selection the means of improvement. — 
The few individuals of the second generation that show the 
marked improvement are the ones to be relied on to carry 
the herd forward in the improvement. Their female offspring 
will in turn show many inferior to themselves, with only a few 
superior ones. It is the continued and judicious selection from 
the high-producing and the discarding of the low-producing 
that improves the general average of the herd. As generations 
come and go, characteristics of the pure-bred sire will become 
more and more fixed and uniform. Reversions towards the 
low production of the common-bred ancestors will be less and 
less frequent. The herd will be practically pure-bred from the 
standpoint of the capacity of the individual animals to re- 
produce their characteristics, although they can never become 
eligible to registration in a herd-book. 
This plan of grading-up has been successfully practiced in the 
improvement of a large number of herds of dairy cattle, and is 
entirely within the reach of any one. As an example of this 
plan there is shown in the table (p. 243) the improvement that 
was secured in the case of a herd descending from a single in- 
ferior cow. 
The table shows a very rapid improvement for the first two 
generations, and for the next three it just about holds its own. 
There are two reasons why the third, fourth, and fifth genera- 
tions do not equal the second: first, because they contain many 
heifers which have not yet reached maturity and serve to pull 
the general average down; and second, there are a large number 
of animals taken into account. 
While the plan has been applied to the improvement of a herd 
starting with a common cow, it should be remembered that the 
same principles apply equally well to any herd. There are very

few herds, even the best, in which the intelligent application of 
these principles will not result in marked improvement. 
THE DAIRY BULL 
The bull is of prime importance in breeding dairy cattle. We 
have already observed that the male is concerned with so many 
more individual offspring that his influence is much more ex- 
tensive because of the increased number he influences. To 
secure the improvement in a herd of cattle through the females 
would require the use of twenty-five or more superior cows to 
accomplish the same results that might be secured by the use 
of a single bull, and even then there would be less uniformity 
in the offspring. This is due merely to the fact that the bull 
controls one-half the characters in the entire crop and not to any 
special prepotency on his part. 
Choosing a dairy bull. — In choosing dairy bulls, it may be 
noted that they have many points in common with the dairy 
cow, particularly features of type, such as were fully discussed 
in the chapter on choosing a dairy cow, page 189; but it is a 
much more difficult task to choose a bull than it is to discrimi- 
nate between cows. 
The first and most important attribute is good pedigree, 
based on a record of performance. Not only should the dams 
in the pedigree have good records of performance, but the 
males should also be getters of performers. The longer the 
line of high-producing ancestry, the more certain are the off- 
spring to be high producers. 
After having satisfied ourselves with respect to the pedigree, 
as based on records of performance, then we may take into 
account the individuality of the bull. In no case should one 
sacrifice individuality, no matter how perfect, for performance. 
It would be unpardonable to choose a bull, if he was so weak 
as to be unable to propagate his kind. The constitutional 
vigor and prepotency are indicated to a certain extent by the  
-P-A-G-E-273
  BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 245 
individual. The bull should possess a masculine appearance. 
The features of the head should be strong, with the eyes mild 
and clear. The chest should be deep, the heart girth large, 
the hide loose and pliable, and the hair fine and silky, as these 
are associated with constitution, vigor, and thrift.

The Jersey breed of dairy cattle, a native of the Island of Jersey, one of the 
Channel Islands, near England, is unexcelled in the quality and richness of the 
milk. By many it is considered the “butter cow.” In size the animals are 
small, weighing 700 and upward. ° The color is fawn, being of many shades, 
yellowish, reddish, grayish, brownish, and silver fawn. This breed is popular 
in the United States. 
Uniformity of get. — The importance of uniformity among 
the calves sired by a bull is of much importance. At the present 
time, lack of uniformity among our dairy cattle is one of the most 
noticeable defects. This is due in a large measure to our 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
. » 
  246 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
utter lack of system in breeding. When once we have decided 
on the breed, there should be no further change. Were this 
done for a few generations, until certain breeds became identi- 
fied with certain localities, then we could depend on uniformity 
of the entire crop of calves sired in any given season. 
Number of cows to the bull.— The number of cows that it is 
safe to breed to a bull in a season depends much on the breed. 
The bulls of the heavy phlegmatic beef breeds are not so prolific 
as the lighter more active dairy breeds. The same is true among 
the various dairy breeds, but to a less marked extent. It is 
entirely safe to count on a bull serving twenty-five cows, and 
when the bulls are exceedingly strong and vigorous, they may 
far exceed this number. 
THE DAIRY COW 
While all dairy cows must be bred in order that they may 
freshen, the cows to which we look to replenish the herd should 
be carefully selected. The first and by far the most important 
factor to take into consideration is pedigree based upon the 
record of performance. After having satisfied ourselves as to 
the performance, then we may look to the individuality, as 
suggested in the chapter on choosing a cow (p. 189). 
Productive period in dairy cattle. — The most fertile period in 
the cow’s life is usually from two to eight years of age. In ex- 
ceptional cases this period may be extended both ways. Just 
how young it is best to breed heifers is a question concerning 
which there is great difference of opinion. Some argue that. 
secreting milk is a kind of habit, and the sooner the young ani- 
mal becomes accustomed to it the better it is for her; whereas 
others say that the cow should not be bred until she gets her 
growth, contending that the demands made on the young 
animal by the growing fetus and her own growth are too severe, 
and that she is likely to be stunted. 
The advisability of breeding a heifer so as to have her drop
-P-A-G-E-275
  
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 247 
the calf at two years of age depends much on the individual. 
If she is vigorous, healthy, and well grown, it will probably be 
better to breed her rather young, and encourage the milking 
habit from the beginning. Once giving milk, keep her at it as 
long as possible, for the cow that dries off after secreting milk a 
few months is unprofitable at best. Do not breed her a second 
time till rather late, as the effect of the animal again becoming 
pregnant is to decrease the flow of milk. This practice has much 
to recommend it. In the first place, unbred heifers are in heat 
two or three days every three weeks, and these constant recur- 
ring periods are. as much of a check on the growth of the heifer 
as that of the growth of the fetus. Again, if the cow is let run 
in this unbred state, the reproductive organs are likely to be- 
come deranged and the animal barren. The animal bred young 
in life will prove a more regular breeder. The condition of 
pregnancy seems to have a marked stimulating effect on the 
system of the heifer. The assimilation is much better, and if 
provided with an abundance of nutritious food, she will make 
a greater growth during pregnancy than otherwise. It is easier 
to develop the milk-secreting organs at this early period. 
Therefore, if the heifer is thrifty and well grown, it would seem 
best from a practical point of view to breed her young. 
At about eight or ten years of age, the productive powers 
of most dairy cows begin to wane, although many of them are 
reliable breeders well into the teens. Above twelve years of 
age, however, it is rarely that they will breed, and when an 
animal of this age persistently fails to conceive, it is perhaps 
best to dispose of her as the chances of her propagating are 
exceedingly remote. 
Season of the year to breed. — The natural time for calves to 
arrive is in the spring. Under ordinary farm conditions this 
is the customary time for having the cows drop their calves. 
There are many advantages in having the calves come at this 
time. The pregnant cow can be turned to grass, which is the  
-P-A-G-E-276
248 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
natural food for pregnant animals, and need not receive so close 
attention as would be necessary were she confined to the stable 
and fed dry foods. The warm weather approaching, the calf 
is more easily cared for than in the winter. There is natural 
grass for the calf to feed on, and nothing is better. 
Fall calving is much to be preferred on dairy farms or where 
high production is desired. There are many reasons for this. 
By having the calves dropped in the fall the cows are giving 
their maximum yield when the price of dairy products is high. 
While the calf is more trouble to care for in winter, this is the 
idle season, and more attention can be givenit. Again, on the 
average the flow can be kept up longer, and the total produc- 
tion made much more when the cow freshens in the fall. This 
is due, in part, to the fact that she is turned to pasture just as 
her flow begins to wane, which causes it to rise again. On the 
other hand, if the cow freshens in the spring, the animals give 
their maximum yield when the price of dairy products is low, 
and then the dry fall coming on cuts their flow, then later they 
are put on the dry food of winter, which still further reduces the 
yield, so that at the time dairy products are high, the animals 
are giving very little or no milk at all. 
A cow bred Jan. 1 should calve Oct. 10, or one bred June 23 
should calve April 1, according to the table on next page. 
Parturition time.— The average period of gestation in the cow 
is properly placed at nine months, more accurately perhaps two 
hundred and eighty-three days, but it may vary either way. 
A calf born at the two hundred and fortieth day may live, and 
a case is reported where a thrifty calf was dropped on the three 
hundred and thirty-fifth day. Because of the uncertainty of the 
period, the cow should be closely watched from the eighth month 
until calving. There are certain signs of the near approach of 
parturition that rarely fail. The udder becomes enlarged, firm 
and resistant to the touch, with more or less swellingin front, and 
secretes_a milky fluid; the vulva becomes enlarged and swollen,

and should not be ruptured until they do so naturally. The 
after-pains come on later and expel the afterbirth which 
should not be left longer than twenty-four hours.

wheat bran, or shorts. Increase the grain ration gradually 
until on full feed. 
    THE CALF 
The young calf that makes its appearance normally and is 
bright and active needs only to be let alone as long as both cow 
and calf are doing well. Not all calves, however, are so fortu- 
nate. Occasionally one loses its life through want of atten- 
tion at time of birth. It sometimes happens that the new-born 
calf cannot breathe — does not establish the function of respi- 
ration. Steps must be taken quickly to establish respiration.
-P-A-G-E-279
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 251 
If detached membranes cover the air passage, remove them. 
Wiping out the nose deeply with a feather, or even with the 
finger, excites sneezing and starts breathing. Blowing violently 
into the nose and mouth has a similar effect. Slapping the 
chest with the palm of the hand or with a towel dipped in cold 
water is good to start breathing. 
As soon as the cow has recovered from the shock of giving 
birth, she should tend the calf, for it will be physically bene- 
fited thereby. If she refuses to lick and caress her ealf, a little 
flour sprinkled over the back of the latter will often attract her 
to it. Should she still refuse, the calf must be dried with a,cloth 
or wisp of straw, and if necessary, assisted to get its-first meal. 
It is especially important for the calf that it get the first or 
colostrum milk of the dam. This milk is rich in mineral matter 
and ash, is a powerful laxative, and is effective in removing the 
fecal matter from the alimentary canal, and in addition serves 
as a tonic. The calf should be allowed to suck the dam a few 
times; some recommend until the milk is fit for human con- 
sumption, usually about the eighth or ninth milking, while others 
recommend separating them on the second day, providing the 
calf is strong and the cow’s udder in good shape, as the cow is 
more easily reconciled to the separation, and the calf can be 
taught to drink more easily than if it has sucked the cow for 
some time. If, however, the calf is weak, it is better to have 
it with the cow, as it will feed oftener and grow stronger ; or if 
the cow’s udder is inflamed, the calf will help to bring it back 
to the proper condition. The calf may be placed in a near-by 
pen and in sight of the dam, as it is thought she will be less ex- 
cited and not attempt to “hold up” her milk. 
Feeding the dairy calf. — On account of the high price of milk 
it becomes necessary to feed the dairy calf by hand. This calls 
for extra labor and sometimes entails extra difficulties, but if 
proper precautions are taken, these may in a large measure be 
avoided.  
-P-A-G-E-280
  252 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Teaching the calf to drink. — When the calf is taken from the 
cow, it may not drink at first, but after the omission of a feed 
it becomes hungry and as a rule can be taught to drink very 
easily. A calf is much more tractable when hungry. The calf 
will not learn to drink any younger by being forced to breathe 
  Fic. 80.—Imrorrep Brown Swiss Buuu. A first prize winner. Owned by 
Sedgley Farms, Hinsdale, Ill. 
The Brown Swiss cattle, natives of Switzerland, are classed as dual-purpose ; 
that is, they yield a fair quantity of average quality milk and the steers when 
fattened make average beef. In size the bulls weigh from 1500 to 2000 pounds ; 
the cows 1200 to 1500 pounds. The color is usually light or dark brown, fading 
to gray along the backbone to the tail and about the belly. 
the milk into its lungs. It should be remembered that instinct 
teaches the calf to look up for its food, and the feeder must 
change this by teaching the calf to look down. There is great 
difference among breeds as well as among individuals in the ease 
with which the calves are taught to drink from the pail. Some 
are taught to drink at the first trial with little or no sucking of
-P-A-G-E-281
  
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE 253 
the fingers, whereas others require much more persistent effort 
and considerable patience as well as common sense. 
Danger of overfeeding. — When feeding by hand, there is 
much danger of overfeeding and gorging the calf’s stomach, 
thereby causing digestive disorder, scours, and death. When 
permitted to run with the cow, the calf sucks many times daily, 
— ten to twenty,— taking only a little milk at atime. When 
removed from the dam and left from eight to twelve hours, it 
gets exceedingly hungry, and when offered milk in large quan- 
tities, will gorge itself and bring digestive disorders that may 
prove fatal. If there are two or more calves in the same pen, 
it will be very necessary to fasten them, so that in case one gets 
through drinking before the others it cannot rob them of their 
supply, for if it should, it may prove fatal. 
The calf on whole milk. — For the first few weeks, the calf 
should be given the milk from its own dam rather than from an- 
other cow, as changing from one to another is likely to throw 
the digestive system out of balance, and result in digestive dis- 
orders such as scours, colic, and the like. When convenient, it is 
best to feed the calf three times a day for the first few days. 
The milk should be fed from a clean pail, directly after milking, 
while still at the body temperature. The amount of milk fed 
should be carefully regulated. A good plan with the average 
calf is to give four pounds — two quarts — of whole milk three 
times daily. If the cow’s milk tests high in butter-fat, it is ad- 
visable to feed that part of the milk which is first drawn from the 
udder, as it possesses a lower fat content, and is less likely to 
cause digestive disorders. In a state of nature, a calf gets milk 
containing about 3 per cent fat, whereas some of our improved 
breeds give almost twice that amount. The amount fed should 
be increased gradually, taking much care to avoid overfeeding. 
In case scours develop, the feed should be immediately reduced. 
The calf on skim-milk. —Whole milk, being rather expensive, 
should not be fed longer than is necessary. The time for begin- 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  
  254 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
ning to substitute skim-milk will vary according to conditions. 
In general the change should begin when the calf is four weeks of 
age. This change should be made gradually, so that the calf may 
adjust itself to the new feed without trouble. A good plan is to 
increase the skim-milk one pound each day and decrease the 
whole milk by the same amount, and thus requiring about one 
week to.make the complete change. The skim-milk should 
always be sweet and as nearly the same from day to day as is 
possible. The amount fed may be gradually increased to 20 
pounds daily, but it is not considered advisable to feed more 
than that amount. 
When two or three weeks old, the calf should be taught to eat 
alittle grain. This is best accomplished by placing a handful in 
the pail immediately after the calf has finished drinking the milk. 
It is not a good practice to put the grain in the milk, as the calf 
will swallow it with the milk and not learn to masticate it prop- 
erly. After the calf has learned to eat the grain, a box should 
be provided in which to feed the grain. If for some reason the 
calf fails to eat the grain,it must be removed and not left in the 
box to decay. The grain should be kept fresh and clean. At six 
weeks of age, the calf should be eating one pound daily of the 
following mixture: 3 parts corn meal, 3 parts ground oats, 3 
parts wheat bran, and 1 part linseed meal. 
The young calf should be taught to eat hay along with the 
grain. If sweet nutritious hay is put within its reach, it will 
soon learn to eat it. Whole hay is preferred to chopped. 
Among the various hays, alfalfa holds first place, but if not avail- 
able, bright clover hay of fine quality is excellent for the calf. 
The hay should not be overripe, as such hay contains too much 
crude fiber and is coarse and woody. The calf may have all the 
hay it will consume, providing it gets grain and skim-milk in 
addition. It is doubtful whether it is advisable to feed silage or 
roots while the calf is getting skim-milk. 
Fall .calves. may be turned to grass the following spring,
-P-A-G-E-283
  
BREEDING DAIRY CATTLE © 255 
but grain feeding should also be practiced, as stronger and larget 
calves will result. Later in the summer, when the grass is short 
and dead, the flies bad, and weather very warm, some green feed, 
if available, would be a valuable addition. After the first or 
second month the calves should have access to cool, clear water, 
as the milk furnished will not be sufficient for them to drink, 
particularly if the weather is hot and the flies troublesome. 
Milk substitutes for raising calves. — Whole milk is the nat- 
ural food for the calf. On it the average calf will thrive better 
than on any other food. Because of the high price of milk 
many substitutes for milk as a calf food have been put upon 
the market from time to time. From a careful perusal of the 
literature, both with respect to experiments and practice, it 
seems that skim-milk, grain, and hay make the best substitutes 
for whole milk in raising calves. Skim-milk, however, is seldom 
available, and this has led to trying the substitutes found upon 
the market. While skim-milk, grain, and hay are the best sub- 
stitutes for whole milk, it is true that healthy calves can be 
raised without milk of any kind after the first four weeks. In 
general calves so raised will be inferior in size, but they can be 
brought through strong and healthy. 
Removing horns from young calves. — When dairy cattle are 
desired without horns, the removal is very easily accomplished 
while the ealf is very young. As soon as the horn can be located 
by examining the head with the hand, clip the hair away from 
the budding horn. Wrap a stick of caustic potash in paper to 
protect the hand, dip the end of the stick in water, and rub this 
upon the tip of the horn until the skin or scurf begins to loosen up 
and gets red, taking care all the time that none of the potash 
comes in contact with the skin surrounding the horn. In a few 
days the place will scale over. One application is sufficient. 
Castrating the male calf. — The age at which castration is per- 
missible varies, but usually is performed during the second 
or third month. If done in early life, there is less danger of
-P-A-G-E-284
  256 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
complications, as the organs are not fully mature; and if 
let go too long, the animal becomes “staggy” in appearance 
and will not make as good a feeding calf as otherwise. Castrat- 
ing a calf at so early an age is not a difficult task. The operation 
may be performed with the calf standing, if one is provided with 
“stocks” to hold him; or in the absence of stocks, by throwing 
the calf upon his side and holding him firm. When ready, hold 
the testicle in the left hand, and with a sharp instrument in the 
right make a good free incision, remembering that there are two 
thick coats that must be cut through. Now the testicle may 
be removed by simply cutting it off, though this may be followed 
by a hemorrhage. To avoid this, take the cord in the left hand, 
having the cord between the thumb and the index finger. 
Now twist the testicle several times with the right hand and 
push with the left hand towards the body of the animal. This 
will do away almost entirely with the bleeding. If, however, 
this seems too difficult, scrape the cord in two instead of cutting. 
Let the animal up, and in a few days he will be all right again.

CHAPTER XI 
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 
THERE are many factors to be considered in the formation and 
management of a dairy herd, some of which are personal in their 
nature and do not lend themselves readily to discussion, while 
others are more general, of interest to all,and may be discussed 
intelligently. The two most important factors in a dairy herd 
are of course the owner and the cows. A discussion of the 
qualities of a good dairyman, further than that he should be 
in love with his work, have faith in it, be industrious, and pains- 
taking in selecting, breeding, and caring for his stock, is a difficult 
task, as all kinds of men on all kinds of farms are making a suc- 
cess with dairy cattle, whereas other men similarly placed are 
constantly failing of success. The cow, on the other hand, 
with her desirable and undesirable qualities more easily defined 
and more uniform in their nature, may be intelligently discussed. 
SANITARY MILK PRODUCTION 
By sanitary milk is meant a clean, wholesome product pro- 
duced under healthful conditions. The principal factors to be 
considered in its production are the cows, the stable, the milk- 
house, the milking, and the cooling and storing of the milk. 
The cow. —In the production of clean milk, extra care must 
be given the cows. They must be curried daily to remove the 
loose hair and dirt. The udder and rear parts of the animal 
should be clipped, thus removing the long dirt-catching hair and 
rendering the parts much more easily cleaned. The udder

should be wiped with a damp cloth just before milking. Hay 
should not be fed previous to milking, as it fills the air with 
dust. Care should be taken to 
feed clean, nutritious foods and 
such as will not contribute an 
undesirable flavor to the milk. 
The drinking water for the cows 
should be clean, fresh, and the 
tanks protected from possible 
contamination. Furthermore,

ora: nes at Sedgley Farms, cannot produce sanitary milk 
and keep diseased cows. Each 
animal composing the herd should be tested for tuberculosis 
once each year and the diseased cases removed. 
The stables. — If one is to produce sanitary milk, the stable 
must be kept clean. This applies to dust, cobwebs, and the like, 
as well as to the manure and litter. Much light and good ven- 
tilation are essential. The floors should be of cement. The 
gutters and litter should be cleaned out twice daily, and the 
material hauled to the field, or placed in a protected water- 
tight pit outside the barnyard and of sufficient. distance to pre- 
vent odors from reaching the stable. The covered shed, if one 
is used, and stable-yard, must be clean and well drained. It 
is a rather common practice to house other animals, such as 
horses or sheep and sometimes swine, in the same stable with 
cattle. If sanitary milk is to be the product, no other animals 
should be placed in the same stable with the cows. 
The cows should be bedded liberally, particularly if the floor 
is of cement. The bedding should not be permitted to become 
foul, as this not only lessens the comfort of the cattle, but makes 
it more difficult to keep them clean and it promotes disease. 
Old straw makes the best bedding material, but when high in 
price, it may be replaced by many other materials, such as shay-

ings from the planing mill, — which make a clean and sweet 
bedding, — by tan-bark, by leaves, and the like. 
Milk-house. — Preferably the milk-house should be separate 
from the barn and located at a safe distance from all sources of

contamination, yet convenient to the cows. It should be divided 
into two rooms, one for heating water and cleaning the utensils, 
and the other for weighing, sampling, cooling, and storing the 
milk. The milk-house should be well lighted and well venti- 
lated, the floors should be constructed of cement, and the wall,
-P-A-G-E-288
260 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and ceiling made tight and smooth ‘n order that they may be 
easily cleaned. The windows ana doors should be screened to 
exclude the flies. 
The utensils, such as the milk-cooler, the pails, cans, strainers, 
and the like, should be thoroughly cleaned by first soaking in 
warm water, then washing in boiling water containing some 
cleaning material, rinsed in clean hot water, and then sterilized 
with steam. After thoroughly cleaning, they should be inverted 
in the pure air, preferably in the sunlight. 
Milking. — The milker should be cleanly in his habits, and 
should milk with dry hands. A small-top milk pail should be 
used to exclude the dirt as far as possible. As soon as each 
cow is milked, the milk should be taken directly to the milk- 
house and there weighed, a record made of the weight, a sample 
taken to, test for the fat, then it should be strained, and im- 
mediately run over a cooler, reducing its temperature as low as 
possible (Fig. 82). The milk should then be kept at as low a tem- 
perature as possible. A good plan is to set the cans in a vat 
containing ice, and cover the vat with a lid. If thisis not con- 
venient, set the cans in running well or spring water. During 
transportation cover the cans with a blanket. In summer the 
blanket should be wet, in winter dry. 
MILKING MACHINES 
Perhaps the most important factor retarding the development 
of dairying is the difficulty of securing milkers who can be de- 
pended on to do their work satisfactorily. In general the size 
of the dairy is restricted to the number of cows that the owner 
can attend to at such times as his help fails him. If the question 
of milking the cows, without being so dependent on hired help, 
could be satisfactorily solved, the number of animals kept on 
many dairy farms would increase up to the limit of the acreage 
to feed the animals. Any possibility, therefore, of milking cows 
by machinery is likely to appeal strongly to the dairy farmer.
-P-A-G-E-289
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 261 
There are now machines on the market that will milk cows. 
There are, however, many questions relative to their use that 
cannot be answered with much positiveness; chief of which are 
the efficiency with which they milk, the effect on the cow, the 
effect on the milk, and their economy. 
It is well known that one milker may secure more milk than 
others from the same cow, and that after a cow has become 
accustomed to a milker, a change results in a decrease in the 
production. It may be expected, therefore, that the immediate 
effect of changing from hand to machine milking will be at- 
tended by the same results. The question as to the practicability 
of machine milking is, therefore, whether or not cows can be 
milked satisfactorily by this method for an extended period of 
time. Furthermore there comes the question of the effect upon 
succeeding generations, whether the machine milking will have 
a tendency to discourage the transmission of milking qualities. 
The milking machine is of so recent invention that there are 
not data enough at hand to answer these questions. The data 
available go to show that by taking the year through, the 
average cow yields approximately as much milk to the machine 
method as to the hand method of milking, particularly if she is 
stripped by hand after the machine milking. 
Mechanically, the machine seems to do its work efficiently. 
There are, however, certain difficulties encountered which hin- 
der the working of the machine and over which it can have 
no control. Chief among these are the shape, size, and other 
peculiarities of the cow’s udder and teats. The quality of 
the udder as regards fleshiness or flabbiness and unevenness 
of the quarters, teats abnormally small, warty, those that milk 
down, and those that are very close together, are likely to give 
much difficulty. 
The effect of the machine on the milk, particularly the 
bacteria content, depends much on the manipulation of the 
apparatus while in operation as well as its care between the milk-  
-P-A-G-E-290
  
262 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
ings. If the teat-cups slip from the teats while the machine is 
working, many germs are likely to be drawn into the milk pail. 
The machines are provided with air filters, and the efficiency 
in keeping the germ content low depends much on the condition 
of these filters. The milk in its passage from the teats to the pail

These teat-cups and tubing are likely to crack, and these mi- 
nute cracks become laden with germs, which are hard to wash 
out, and if the rubber is steamed sufficiently to kill the germs, 
it soon wears out. To obviate this difficulty it is recommended 
to keep the teat-cups and rubber parts in a 10 per cent solu-
-P-A-G-E-291
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 263 
tion of common salt. This treatment proves very effective. 
If, therefore, the workman is skilled in the manipulation of 
the machine and cares for it properly, the germ content of the 
milk can be kept low and a clean product secured. The avail- 
able data seem to indicate that the machine has no effect on 
the fat content of the milk, particularly if the cows are stripped 
by hand, as is usually advisable. 
MANAGEMENT OF THE BULL 
The bull calves must be removed from the heifers when four 
to six months old. In rearing a bull, accustom it to being 
handled from calfhood. From the very beginning it should 
be gently but firmly managed and not fondled or permitted 
to frolic. Give it kind, quiet, firm, and unvarying treat- 
ment. Always keep it under subjection, that it may never 
know its strength and power. Place a ring in its nose before it 
is a year old. This ring should be frequently renewed, in order 
that it be always strong. If this is neglected, the ring will come 
in two when most needed. Always lead and handle the bull 
with a staff. The bull should never run loose in the yard or 
pasture. It should be provided with abundant and regular 
exercise. At such times it should be under restraint and full 
control. For exercise, some recommend placing the bull in a 
tread-power and use the power thus generated to grind thegrain, 
run the fodder cutter or cream separator, and the like, but this 
does not seem practicable. A very good plan to provide exer- 
cise for the bull is to arrange a wire overhead and attach the 
bull’s halter strap to it. This will enable him to take exercise 
at will and still keep him under control. As age and strength 
increase, a second ring should be placed in the nose in which to 
attach a strap, chain, or rope to supplement the staff when the 
animal is let out for service. Let there always be a double hitch- 
ing device, so that the bull may never by accident find himself 
free when he should be tied. In the management of a bull, it is
-P-A-G-E-292
  264 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
well to remember that one physically tired may be depended 
on to be quiet and easily managed; hence the importance of 
much exercise. 
When possible, it is much better to keep the bull in the 
presence of the herd than stabled by himself, in a lonely place, 
as is so often the case. 
It is a common practice among dairymen to use immature bulls 
and to dispose of them before their merits as sires are known. 
This is because bulls of some age are likely to be vicious and 
dangerous. Many a good bull has been sold for beef only be- 
cause he was not easily managed and it was thought desirable 
to dispose of him before some one was injured. A bull that 
is known to get good offspring should be kept as long as he 
is useful as a sire. 
Ringing the bull. — Many neglect to ring the bull calf under 
the erroneous impression that it is a difficult task. On the other 
hand, it is very easy. All one needs to do is punch ahole through 
the membrane between the two nostrils, insert the ring, and screw 
it together. If one has a bull-ringing punch to make the hole, it 
is much easier, but in the absence of the punch the hole may be 
made with a knife, placing the ring in as the blade is drawn 
out. To restrain the calf it must be tied up securely by the 
head. The ringing of an older bull is more difficult because of 
the difficulty of restraining him. 
THE DAIRY BARN 
The dairy cow is perhaps the most difficult of farm animals 
to stable properly. The purpose for which she is kept, that of 
supplying milk; the use to which the milk is put, that of 
human food; the condition in which it is used, being raw; the- 
place from which it is drawn, being exposed to greatest filth ; 
the manner in which it is drawn, by hand and often by unclean 
milkmen; and the condition of her dung or manure, as well as 
the fact that if maximum production is to be obtained, she
-P-A-G-E-293
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 265 
must be fairly warmly housed, yet provided with an abundance 
of light and much fresh air;—all serve to complicate the 
problem of providing suitable quarters for the dairy cow. 
There are certain fundamentals that should be provided in 
every building in which the dairy cow is stabled. Chief among 
these are light, ventilation, sufficient room, smooth and light 
walls and ceilings, a good floor, a comfortable and convenient 
tie, and properly constructed mangers. 
    
Fig. 84.—Darry Barn, New York State Coiuece or AGRICULTURE 
MILK-HOUSE IN THE FoREGROUND. 
Light in abundance should enter the dairy barn. — Sunlight is 
nature’s disinfectant. With sufficient light and proper ventila- 
tion, germ diseases are not likely to occur. It is said that 
direct sunlight will kill the growing tuberculosis germ in a very 
few minutes. Hence, cattle kept in well-lighted and well-ven- 
tilated quarters are not so likely to contract this much 
dreaded disease. Again, light shows dirt and makes it easy to 
keep the barn clean. Dark stables are likely to be dusty or 
dirty and damp, thus providing conditions for germ growth. 
In addition to freedom from germ disease, health, cleanliness, 
and the like, a barn in which the sun shines freely furnishes a 
cheerful place in which to work.
-P-A-G-E-294
    
266 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Sunlight, the most efficient disinfectant as well as the most 
powerful of all medicines, is free, and provision for its admit- 
tance into any cow barn need cost but little. Window glass is 
inexpensive. Old barns that are dark and dismal may easily 
be provided with sufficient light by cutting holes in the walls 
and putting in windows. Best results are obtained by cutting 
the windows long from top to bottom and low, as more direct 
sunlight will fall on the floors. 
Ventilation essential to health. —'The importance of pure air 
in a cow stable cannot be overestimated. It is essential to 
the well being of the herd; without it, disease will surely work 
destruction. While there are many methods of ventilating a 
dairy barn, the King system in some of its modified forms 
is admitted to be the most efficient. If in addition the 
windows are arranged as suggested on page 268, ample ven- 
tilation can be procured. 
King’s system of ventilation. — While there are many meth- 
ods of arranging this system, it consists essentially of two 
parts: the inlets and the outlets, in the form of flues. This 
system will not work if the walls of the barn are full of cracks 
or the floor is made of loose boards. ‘The floor, walls, ceilings, 
and windows must be so constructed as to prevent any large 
quantity of air from leaving or entering. 
The inlets must be so constructed as to meet two condi- 
tions; first, they must admit the fresh air near the ceiling, 
where the barn air is warm, in order that the fresh air may 
mingle with the warmest air of the stable and raise the tem- 
perature before descending to the floor, thus not allowing 
the animals to lie in cold air. In the second place, they must 
not permit the warm air to pass out instead of the cold fresh 
air to come in. This is accomplished by constructing the inlet 
flue so that it begins near the ground on the outside and ends 
near the ceiling on the inside. All that is necessary is to have 
the outer end of the flue several feet lower than the inner end.
-P-A-G-E-295
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 267 
The inlets should be numerous, of small size, and constructed 
on all four sides of the stable in order to take advantage of the 
wind, regardless of the direction from which it blows. In this 
way a large quantity of air is admitted and evenly distributed 
throughout the stable. A convenient size for these inlets is 
4 x 12 inches, as this permits the flue to be built between two

4-inch studdings. There should be one such flue to each three 
cows. The flues should be lined with building paper, and this 
covered with matched lumber. All openings, and especially 
the outside ones, should be securely covered with heavy wire 
netting. 
The outlets must be so constructed as to meet three con- 
ditions. First, the ventilators should reach to near the stable 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  268 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
floor in order to remove the air from that point. This is 
desirable because the refuse gases from the animals being 
heavier than the other air of the stable remain near the floor. 
The animals not only lie down, but they breathe the impuri- 
ties from the floor when standing. The colder air is at the floor, 
and it is desirable to remove this, particularly in the winter, in 
order that the warmer air at the ceiling may move downward. 
In the second place, these ventilators should be provided with 
an opening near the ceiling for the removal of the warm air when 
the stable becomes too warm, particularly if the animals are to 
be kept in the stable most of the time. This opening must be 
provided with a door or slide to be closed or opened at will. In 
the third place, it is important that these ventilators be so con- 
structed as to afford as little inconvenience as possible, particu- 
larly when they extend through the hay loft, where they are 
sometimes in the way of the hay fork. The ventilating flue 
should be as large as convenient. The essentials of a good 
ventilating flue are similar to those of a good chimney. In 
addition to their being of air-tight construction and as straight 
as conditions will permit, it should rise above the highest 
part of the roof so as to get the full force of the wind. 
Window ventilation. — If it is not possible to install the King 
system in one of its many forms, the windows can be so ar- 
ranged as to form a fair system of ventilating the cow stable. 
To do this, hinge them at the bottom, allowing the top to 
open inward. Place a board edgewise along each side of the 
window, so that the air will not enter at the bottom and blow 
directly on the animals when the window is open. By leaving 
several of the windows open an inch or two at the top they will 
provide fair ventilation without producing serious drafts. 
When this plan is employed, it is best to open the windows on 
the side of the barn away from the wind and to regulate the 
size of the opening according to the severity of the weather. 
Floors are best made of cement. — While many objections have
-P-A-G-E-297
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 269 
been raised to the use of cement, such as its cost, its being cold 
and damp, injuring the cattle and the like, it is nevertheless 
the most desirable material from which to construct floors 
for the cow stable. The gutters and mangers should likewise

TER, AND ARRANGEMENT OF WinpDows. New YorK State CoLLEGE oF

be laid in cement. Cement has two very great advan- 
tages over all other materials: it is easily kept clean, and if 
properly put down, is durable. If desired, plank may be laid 
over the cement where the cows stand. This, however, is not 
necessary, as cement can be made dry and fairly warm by
-P-A-G-E-298
  
270 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
placing a layer of some non-conducting material, such as build- 
ing paper, an inch or so beneath the surface. This may be 
done as follows: lay the cement as usual until within one and 
one-half inches of the desired thickness. Now lay down one 
thickness of heavy building paper, leave a strip at least six 
inches wide, along the edge next to the gutter. Paint this build- 
ing paper with asphaltum paint, then lay down another thick- 
ness of the paper. Spike this paper down, leaving the heads of 
the spikes sticking up about one-half inch above the paper: Put 
on the remainder of the cement and proceed as though the 
paper was not there. This paper need be put only where the 
cattle lie. Figs. 85 and 86 show good cement construction. 
Watering device. — There are many devices on the market 
for keeping a constant supply of water before the animal. 
The question of their use depends largely on the ease of 
keeping them clean. In many cases they are provided with 
tops which the cow soon learns to raise and which fall down 
and cover the device when she is not drinking, but these do 
not keep the water clean. The cow with her mouth partially 
full of grain or hay often opens the lid and slobbers the grain 
into the water. This material soon decays and the device 
becomes a trap for foul-smelling water. Perhaps the safest and 
most convenient plan is to have a large tank located near by. 
This can be easily cleaned, the water kept fresh and cool in 
summer, and the chill easily driven off in winter. 
THE SILO 
The silo has passed the experimental stage, and the economy 
as well as the practicability of preserving fodder in it has been 
fully demonstrated. Silage is a valuable food, and is relished 
by all classes of farm animals, but is more particularly adapted 
to ruminating animals like the dairy cow. In fact, in order 
to secure maximum production, some kind of succulent food is 
necessary, and ordinarily silage will be found the most efficient 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF DAIRY CATTLE 271 
as well as the most economical form of succulence that can be 
provided. 
The fundamental principle in the preservation of green 
forage when placed in a silo is the exclusion of air. To pre- 
vent the air from reaching the silage, the silomust be constructed 
with air-tight walls. These walls must be rigid enough to pre- 
vent springing out of shape by the pressure of the silage, for in 
this case air will enter next to the wall. The pressure is greatest 
from the second to the sixth day after filling. The silage at 
this time begins to heat and settle, and if the walls are not 
sufficiently rigid to prevent any bulging, a considerable loss of 
silage is likely to result. The walls should be perpendicular, 
and the diameter the same from the bottom to the top. 
The size of the silo.— On being exposed to the air, silage 
spoils rapidly, and to avoid this must be fed off at the rate of 
one and one-half to two inches 
daily in the winter and three 
inches in the summer. A good 
plan is so to construct the silo 
that the horizontal feeding area 
for each cow will be approxi- 
mately six square feet daily. If 
we feed six square feet off the 
top and two inches down, this 
means one cubic foot to the cow. Fic. 87.—Dorcn Brurep Cow 
The approximate weight of acu Ghee 27, A.A pte inet bic foot of silage is forty pounds, N. H. 
though this varies much between 
the top and the bottom. As this is about the proper quantity 
to feed daily, it becomes evident that six square feet is the 
proper area for each cow. 
The table that follows gives the capacity of a silo of various 
widths and depths; also the area required to fill it, and the

criticized, whereas the fault may be found in the method of

filling. It is essential to the preserving of silage that it be 
well packed, keeping it level and thoroughly tramped. This 
very important task is often intrusted to a lad who spends his

that the silage comes out of the silo somewhat molded the

In filling with corn there is a tendency toward an uneven 
distribution of the ears; these, being heavier than the other 
parts of the plant, are blown to the opposite side of the silo. 
To obviate this, many devices are employed, perhaps the most 
simple of which is a long bag open at both ends and fastened 
to the end of the carrier. By means of a small rope attached 
to this bag the corn may be deposited in any part of the silo 
desired.

CHAPTER XII 
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 
Frepine beef cattle differs considerably from feeding dairy 
cattle, as well as from feeding horses. In the case of horse feed- 
ing, the product sought is energy in the form of work; in the 
case of dairy cattle the product is milk; whereas in the case 
of beef cattle the product is flesh. This calls for special 
methods of feeding, special foods or food combinations, and 
special management. Much discussion was devoted (in Chap- 
ter IX, page 203) to the production of milk in which it was 
treated largely as an independent industry because of the 
fact that the successful dairymen have time for little if anything 
else; whereas beef _preduction is not a special industry and 
does not require all of the feeder’s time, and on the average 
is conducted successfully only in connection with grain farm- 
ing. Among successful beef producers, beef-raising is regarded 
as a convenient way of marketing grain, as well as a means 
of conserving soil fertility, and hence the ability to grow more 
grain to feed more stock and also a profitable means of utiliz- 
ing much coarse forage which otherwise would be largely wasted. 
ESSENTIALS OF FEEDING CATTLE 
In feeding beef cattle one of the most important factors is 
the kind of cattle, for on the choice of them will turn in a 
large measure the possibility of success. In considering the 
cattle with a view of estimating their profit as beef producers, 
there are a number of essentials to be taken into account. 
276 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
. 276 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Chief among these are the age, form, condition, quality, uni- 
formity, and the price. 
Age at which to feed cattle. — In recent years no question has 
been more discussed, or the object of more experimentation 
among cattle feeders, than the most profitable age at which to 
fatten cattle. This interest has been due in part at least to 
the fact that writers on agricultural topics strongly advised 
feeding young cattle, whereas the professional feeder, whose 
livelihood depends upon his success, has shown a decided 
preference for older cattle. To secure some idea of the age at 
which gains can be made most cheaply, let us examine the com- 
position of the body of an old and young steer. In Jordan’s 
“Feeding of Animals,’ we note the composition of the body 
of an aged fat steer and of a fat calf to be as follows : —

Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent 
Aged fat steer. . 49.5 44 15.6 30.5 
Fat calf. . . | 64.6 4.8 16.5 14.1 
  
From this we observe that the body of the fat calf con- 
tains 15.1 per cent more water and 16.4 per cent less fat than 
that of the aged fat steer, the ash and protein being practically 
the same. This would seem to indicate that the aged steer 
in fattening required considerably more solid food, particu- 
larly those. foods rich in fat, whereas the calf requires less 
fat, and less dry-matter to the pound of gain. As water is 
cheaper than fat we would expect the calf to make the cheaper 
gains, and such is the case. , 
Not only does the age influence the cheapness of the gains, 
but it affects the rate of gain as well. Here, too, the younger 
animal has the advantage ; that is to say, all things being equal, 
the younger animal will make more rapid gains for 1000 pounds

live weight than the aged one. This is due in part no doubt 
to the fact that the younger animal’s digestive organs are likely 
to be in better condition, the teeth are sounder, the glands 
more active, so that the food is better masticated, more 
thoroughly digested and assimilated than in the aged steer.

The Shorthorn, a native of England, is the most popular beef breed all over the 
world. Though not so early maturing, they attain the largest size of any of the 
beef breeds, cows weighing around 1500 pounds, bulls 2200, and finished steers 
from 1200 to 1500 pounds. The bulls are noted for the excellency of their 
get when bred to native cows, while the finished steers are noted for their good 
quarters. In color they are red, white, and roan. 
Form for feeding cattle. — The form of the steers must be 
such as to meet two conditions: those demanded by the cattle 
feeder, and those demanded by the butcher. The cattle feeder 
wishes an animal that will make rapid and economical gains in 
the feed lot, while the butcher wishes one that will dress a rela-
-P-A-G-E-306
  
  278 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
tively high percentage of edible meat, particularly of the high- 
priced cuts, such as prime of rib, porterhouse, sirloin, rump, 
and round, which are taken from the back, loin, rump, and 
quarters. In general the form that best fills these conditions 
will be low set, deep, broad, and compact, rather than high up, 
gaunt, narrow, loosely made. The cattle should be low set, 
standing on short legs, as animals of this form are likely to 
prove good feeders capable of maturing early. The top and 
bottom lines should be straight and nearly parallel, the flanks 
should be low, thus giving much depth and great capacity. 
WA Cattle possessing such a form are likely to prove rapid and 
economic producers while in the feed lot, thus making a profit 
for the feeder, and when slaughtered to dress a relatively high 
percentage of edible meat, particularly of the high-priced cuts. 
Such an animal should dress out 55 to 60 per cent or better with 
approximately one-half of the edible meat in the region of 
the valuable cuts, and this will sell for about 75 per cent of 
the value of the entire carcass, leaving the other half from the 
region of low-priced meat to bring the other 25 per cent of the 
valuation. 
Condition of feeding cattle. —In considering steers to feed, 
their condition should be carefully scrutinized from two points 
of view: their thrift, and the amount of flesh they possess. 
Feeding cattle should be thrifty but not coarse. Thrift is indi- 
cated by a wide, deep chest, by fullness in the heart girth, by 
depth and breadth of body, and by good handling quality. 
While the cattle should not be coarse, too much refinement is 
likely to prove disappointing, as it often means delicacy or 
lack of thrift, and no animal lacking in thrift should find its way 
into the feed lot. 
To make rapid and economic feeders the cattle should not 
possess much flesh at the beginning of the feeding period. 
All things being equal, the thinner the steer at the beginning 
of the feeding process the more rapid and economical gains it
-P-A-G-E-307
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 279 
will make, providing there is no lack of thrift. It is easily pos- 
sible, however, for a steer to be so low in flesh as to lack thrift. 
Such animals require time to get back into normal condition, 
and there is a possibility of their being stunted permanently. 
If we examine the bodies of the thin and fat steer, it may give 
us an insight as to why the animal gains in flesh more rapidly 
and on less feed when in a thin condition) In Jordan’s “ Feed- 
ing of Animals”? we note the composition of the bodies of 
such steers to be as follows: — 
  Water Asn PROTEIN Far 
Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent Per Cent 
Thin steer =. . . 66.2 5.9 19.2 8.7 
Fat steer. 2. . . 49.5 4.4 15.6 30.5 
It seems that the body of the thin steer contains a relatively 
high amount of water and low fat,-whereas the fat steer’s body 
contains a relatively small amount of water and high fat con- 
tent. This may have a bearing on the fact that a thin steer 
gains more rapidly and on less feed than a fat one, and also 
on the fact that as the full feeding proceeds the gains are made 
less rapidly and require more feed. 
Quality of feeding cattle. — Quality should be considered from 
two points of view: general quality, and handling quality. By 
general quality is meant that general refinement of external form 
found in the neat head, fine horn, dense bone, smooth outline, 
and compact body. This quality is affected by nothing so much 
as breeding. General quality and good breeding are closely 
associated, well-bred animals being likely to possess quality, 
whereas it is often wanting in the common-bred steers. The 
importance of general quality in feeding cattle cannot be over- 
estimated, as steers possessing it will give higher profit to both —
-P-A-G-E-308
  280 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the cattle feeder and the butcher, not because such animals 
will necessarily make more meat from a given amount of food, 
but because they will dress out better and bring a higher price 
on the market. 
Good handling quality indicates that the steer is a good 
feeder. By good handling quality is meant a fine silky hair 
and a loose mellow skin. These are associated with thrift and 
the ability to take on flesh rapidly and economically, whereas 
a heavy stiff hide is considered to indicate slower fattening. 
The previous care that the steers have received has a marked 
influence on the hair and skin, and hence on the handling quality. 
‘The importance of good handling quality is not to be over- 
looked if one is to succeed in feeding cattle. 
Uniformity in feeding cattle. — Feeding cattle should be uni- 
form in age, weight, color, type or form, condition, breeding, 
and quality. As we have observed, young steers gain more 
rapidly than aged ones, and, as we shall see, aged steers fatten 
more rapidly than young ones; hence it is not likely that a lot 
of steers of mixed ages would all be ready to market at the 
same time. If some of the animals are fat, while others are 
only half fat, they will not command as high a price on the 
market as though they were uniform in flesh. Not only must 
they be uniform in flesh, but they must be approximately uni- 
form in weight if the highest price is to be obtained. Butchers 
and packers desire cattle uniform in weight, so that the cuts 
of meat will run uniform, as their trade demands. While uni- 
formity of color does not add to the animal’s capacity to take 
on flesh economically or to his ability to dress out well, yet 
the butchers desire such similarity and are willing to pay 
for it. The cattle should be uniform in type or form. If they 
vary in type, the weight of the cuts of meat will likewise vary, 
and to this the butcher objects. The butcher also demands 
animals equal in condition and quality, to meet the demands 
of his trade calls.

FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR BEEF 
The quantity of food required to fatten a beef animal depends 
on many factors, chief of which are the kind of food and the age, 
weight, and condition as well as the individuality of the animal. 
Some foods promote the formation of flesh and bone, and as a 
result the animal tends to grow, whereas certain other food en- 
courages fat formation and the animal tends to fleshen rather 
than to grow. The age, weight, and condition also have much 
influence on the amount of food required to fatten the animal.

The younger the animal the less food will be required to produce 
a given gain in flesh. The thinner the animal, providing it is 
thrifty, the less food will be required to produce a given weight. 
Perhaps most important of all is the individuality of the steer. 
Some steers will gain three pounds daily, while others receiving 
the same amount and kind of food will gain but one pound. 
The only method of distinguishing the animal that makes three

pounds from the animals that make but one is by external 
appearance. The external indication of a good feeder is a 
low-set form, being deep, broad, and compact, with low-down 
flanks, showing that the animal possesses great capacity for 
digestion and assimilation (p. 278-279). 
No definite quantities can be given that will apply ta all 
animals, to all conditions, and to all foods. The Wolff-Lehman 
standards furnish us a guide to be modified by the judgment

WINTERING STOCKERS AND FEEDERS 
Large numbers of feeding cattle are purchased in fall and 
early winter for the special purpose of economically disposing 
of such roughage as corn stalks, straw stack, second-class clover 
hay, clover chaff after the seed has been removed, and the like. 
Wintering cattle with a view to fattening the following summer 
on pasture is a very convenient way of converting such feeds 
into cash. The cattle feeder is now confronted with the question
-P-A-G-E-311
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 283 
as to how well he shall winter these animals. That is to say, 
he is often at a loss to know whether to feed a small allowance of 
grain along with the roughage or to feed the roughage alone. 
If he feeds the roughage alone, it is doubtful whether the steers 
can be wintered without loss in weight, unless the roughage is 
of good quality and a legume, such as clover, alfalfa, or cowpea 
hay. On the other hand, if he feeds grain, then comes the ques- 
tion as to how much shall be fed, for it is well known that if 
steers are grained too liberally through the winter, they will 
not do so well the following summer on pasture. 
While different systems of feeding should undoubtedly be 
recommended for cattle of various ages and quality, there are at 
least three conditions that should be kept clearly in mind: first, 
cattle wintered on roughage alone, providing they retain their 
thrift, will make more economical beef producers the following 
summer on pasture than when they receive grain along with 
the roughage; second, cattle wintered on a too liberal grain 
ration may fail to make a profit the following summer on pas- 
ture; and third, other things being equal, cattle wintered on a 
ration containing a liberal supply of protein, particularly if this 
protein is contained in the roughage, as clover, alfalfa, or cow- 
pea hay, will make greater and more economical gains during 
both winter and summer than if this nitrogenous roughage is 
wanting.) Itis true that animals receiving this nitrogenous 
roughage will not finish or fatten so quickly, but they will make 
gains more economically, and the quality of the flesh will 
be better than otherwise. From practical experience, there- 
fore, it would seem best to provide considerable protein 
in the ration of the wintering stocker or feeder. If this 
protein is lacking in the roughage, in which it should be 
provided if possible, then supply the needed protein by 
feeding such grains as cotton-seed meal or linseed-oil meal 
in rather limited quantities in the grain ration. In case 
the grain is fed no suggestions can be given as to the exact
-P-A-G-E-312
    
284 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
amount, but when one is simply wintering the steers without 
any attempt to fatten them, the maximum amount should not 
exceed six pounds daily, and perhaps better results can be 
obtained by feeding two to four pounds daily. 
Roughage increases feeding capacity. — It is conceded by ex- 
perienced cattle feeders that roughing steers preparatory to put- 
ting them on full feed requires much skill. The feeding of an 
abundance of roughage encourages the enlargement and develop- 
ment of the digestive organs, thus increasing the capacity for 
handling more concentrated feeds later on. This, of course, 
gives the thin animal a large paunch, which must certainly be 
reduced before the animal is ready for market. A large- 
paunched steer is not wanted on any fat-cattle market. From 
this it would seem that before beginning to feed, or in the early 
part of the feeding process, the enlarging of the paunch should 
be encouraged in order to increase the capacity, while the latter 
part of the feeding period should be devoted to reducing this 
paunch and smoothing up the steer. 
SUMMER FEEDING ON PASTURE 
Fattening cattle in the summer on pasture is usually more 
profitable than winter fattening. By such feeding the labor is 
reduced to a minimum, there is no handling of bulky foods, no 
bedding to provide, no lots to clean of manure, and no outlay for 
an extensive plant, such as sheds, lots, and the like. Approxi- 
mately the only labor in summer fattening is that of feeding the 
grain, when such is fed. 
There are two methods of fattening beef cattle on pasture: 
pasturing alone with no grain, which is called “grass fatten- 
ing”; and feeding grain, often all they will eat, in connection 
with the pasturage. Which of these methods should be em- 
ployed will depend on conditions. When land is cheap and 
there is an abundance of pasture, one may secure fairly good 
returns from pasturing without grain. On the other hand, if
-P-A-G-E-313
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 285 
the pasture is limited, the land high in price, and one has the 
grain, no doubt it will be more profitable to feed grain in con- 
nection with the pasture) The previous treatment of the cattle 
may likewise have an influence. (To get good results from 
fattening cattle on pasture alone, the cattle should be wintered 
very largely on roughage and should be rather thin in flesh 
though not lacking in thrift. Cattle that are accustomed to 
grain and in the habit of depending on it very largely for their 
nourishment will shrink heavily if the grain is refused them. 
While cheaper gains can usually be made from pasturing alone, 
the cattle cannot, as a rule, be made very fat, and hence will not 
command a high price on the market, which will often offset the 
advantage of cheap gains. (There are, however, many ex- 
perienced cattle feeders who rely on grass fattening, particularly 
on the edge of the corn-belt. Cattle feeders in the corn-belt J 
will, as a rule, secure greater returns from a liberal grain feed 
in connection with the pasture. 
How to turn to grass. — As cattle are very subject to bloating 
if turned to succulent grass, especially if wet with dew or rain, 
much care should be exercised. This is particularly true on 
clover or alfalfa. If it is convenient, one should turn the cattle 
out for an hour or so in the afternoon and then take them up 
for the day, turning them out the following day at noon and 
leaving a few hours longer, then taking them up again, when on 
the third day they may be allowed to remain. 
Feeding grain to cattle on pasture. — The amount and kind of 
grain that should be fed to fattening cattle on pasture will de- 
pend much on the previous treatment, age, condition, and 
quality of the cattle as well as the time of marketing them. 
Young stock, that are to be made thick fat, will need grain con- 
tinually throughout the summer. Older cattle, that are not in- 
tended for market until fall, may well have their grain withheld 
until the pasture begins to get short, say along in July. On the 
other hand, many cattle feeders prefer to ‘‘ warm the cattle up”
-P-A-G-E-314
  
  286 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
in the feed lot before going to grass, and then to finish them on 
pasture, disposing of them by the middle of July before the 
hottest of the weather and just about the time the pasture begins 
to fail. Under this system it would be necessary to feed grain 
liberally from the beginning of the pasture season. While this 
method has much to commend it, there is the serious objec- 
tion of turning cattle to succulent pasture when they are receiv- 
ing a liberal supply of grain. On account of the very succulent 
grass so early in the spring such cattle “‘drift”’ or shrink con- 
siderably, even though the grain is continued. This drift is 
so serious that if the cattle are intended for market by, say, 
the middle of June, it will be more profitable on the average to 
finish them in a dry-lot. In addition to the disadvantage of 
the heavy drift it is poor economy to turn cattle to pasture 
before the grass gets a good start; this is particularly true 
if the grass was closely cropped the preceding fall. 
There is difference of opinion as to the kind of grain that 
should be fed cattle of the various ages on pasture. In some 
cases perhaps corn alone cannot be improved on, particularly 
if there is some leguminous grass, as clover or alfalfa, in the 
pasture. Some contend that with young stock especially, it is 
advisable to supplement corn with a food rich in protein, as 
linseed or cotton-seed meal, whereas in the experience of others 
the addition of this extra protein food has caused the young 
stock to grow and not fatten so readily as if the extra food 
was withheld. Among this class of cattle feeders, when they 
supplement corn, it is more likely to be for the older cattle. 
The pastures. — There are two general plans for providing 
pasture land: permanent pastures; and pastures in rotation 
with other crops. Permanent pastures are rapidly disappear- 
ing from those sections of the country suitable for growing grain, 
because of the increased value of the land for grain raising, but 
there are vast areas unsuited for grain growing which can be 
very profitably utilized for permanent pasture. In fact much
-P-A-G-E-315
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 287 
of the land east of the Sciota, south of the Ohio, and west of 
the Missouri rivers is suitable for permanent pasture. This 
cheap land, much of it, could be laid to permanent pastures and 
yield a very creditable return as pasture for beef cattle. In 
fact, if conditions continue in the future as in the past, much 
of our beef must come from these cheap outlying lands. The 
grains grown on the grain farms are rapidly becoming too valu- 
able as food for human consumption to permit of their being 
fed to animals. 
No definite suggestions can be given as to the choice between 
permanent pastures and pastures in rotation further than to say 
that all depends on the location. If those farms or parts of farms 
that are unsuited for growing grains can be laid to permanent 
pasture, it will, on the average, be profitable to do so. Each of 
these systems has certain advantages. For example, permanent 
pasture simplifies the fencing, provides the water supply, the 
shade, and the feed racks or bunks, while pastures in rotation 
give a much better opportunity to distribute the manure to 
all parts of the farm. Permanent pastures even if seriously 
affected by drouth are not likely to be a failure, while pastures 
in rotation occasionally do fail. Properly managed permanent 
pastures will increase in value with age. 
The pasture crop is perhaps the most neglected of farm crops 
at the present time. Many pastures that are now supporting 
one animal to two or three acres can with proper care be made 
to support twice the number. First, secure a good stand. Many 
pastures do not now possess more than one-half a crop. Blue- 
grass should form the basis of all permanent pastures in the 
East, but should be reénforced by white clover, orchard-grass, 
and red-top. The pasture should be harrowed and reseeded 
each spring until a stand is secured. Second, keep down the 
weeds. Animals eat the grass and leave the weeds. To ob- 
viate this, pastures should be mown twice each year. This 
not only-keeps the weeds down, but keeps the pasture in such
-P-A-G-E-316
    288 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
condition that the animals will feed more evenly over the entire 
field. Animals are likely to feed where the grass is rather 
short and tender, and leave the ranker growth. Third, drain 
pastures well. This is often entirely neglected, and the parts of 
the farm that are too wet to grow crops are left to pasture. 
Fourth, top-dress permanent pastures with manure when con- 
venient. Often corn stalks or straw scattered over the north

slopes when the land is broken will materially improve the 
pasture. Another factor which often reduces the total yield of 
a pasture is the fact that the grass is pastured too early in the 
spring, which hinders the growth of the young plants before they 
get a good start, whereas if they were left a week longer, they 
would return a much greater total yield. Pastures thus treated 
will increase in value with age, as has been practically demon- 
strated, as far east as Central New York and as far west as

FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 289 
Western Missouri, where there are permanent pastures vary- 
ing in age from one-third to one-half of a century, and are now 
supporting one animal to each acre from four to six months 
each year without extra feed, and supporting two animals an 
equal length of time when grain is fed in addition. (Fig. 91.) 
WINTER FEEDING IN DRY-LOT 
While feeding steers in the summer time on pasture may be 
the most profitable for those cattle feeders possessing the pas- 
ture, there are many farms, especially in the corn-belt, lacking 
in pasture and yet possessing an abundance of grain and dry 
forage that the farmer desires to convert into beef. On sudh 
farms winter feeding in the dry-lot is the common practice. This 
system of feeding beef cattle is not without its advantages. For 
example, the feeding is done at a time of a year when there 
is little other work, and if the cattle are measurably protected 
from the wind and rain, they suffer less from the weather than 
from the heat of summer, and especially if the flies are trouble- 
some. When the steers are purchased in the fall and fattened 
during the winter, the cattle feeder has his money tied up 
a much shorter period, resulting in correspondingly quicker 
returns. Furthermore, such a aed affords a very convenient 
method of converting the previous crop, grain and dry forage, 
into ready cash to finance the farm the coming season, a8 the 
steers are marketed and out of the way before farm work begins 
‘in the spring. — , 
Feeding grain to cattle in the dry-lot. — The amount and kind 
of grain that should be fed to fattening cattle in the dry-lot will 
depend much on the age, condition, and quality of the cattle 
as well as upon the kind of dry forage. Young stock will need 
a heavy grain ration from start to finish if they are to be 
made fat, whereas older cattle may be fed grain rather spar- 
ingly at first, gradually increasing to a full grain feed sixty days 
before marketing. With the older cattle already having their 
U
-P-A-G-E-318
  290 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
growth, they have but to fatten; whereas with younger cattle 
there is continued growth, and to fatten them requires an extra 
effort, as increasing the grain in the ration.) With steers rather 
rough and coarse in quality that cannot be made prime in any 
event, there is not the necessity for the heavy grain ration re- 
quired by steers of finer quality that can be made prime and thus 
command a premium on the market. This heavy grain ration 
for the steers of finer quality is likely to increase the cost of gains, 
making them even more expensive than the lighter grain ration 
for the coarse steers, but the extra premium commanded on the 
market will make the finer bred steers the more profitable. | The 
amount of grain that can be fed economically to fattening cattle 
depends much on the kind of dry forage. On the average 
animals receiving a leguminous forage, such as clover, alfalfa, 
or cowpea hay, will make economical use of a larger grain ration 
than when other forage, such as timothy, red-top, corn stalks, 
and the like, is fed. In fact, fattening farm animals will make 
more economical use of a larger grain ration if the grain also 
contains a high percentage of protein. The length of the fat- 
tening period will also have much to do with the amount of 
grain that should be fed. If it is intended to market the 
steers in 100 days or less, they will have to be full-fed grain from 
the beginning if they are to be made reasonably fat, whereas if 
the feeding period is to last 150 days or more, the cattle may be 
fed grain rather sparingly at first. 
As to the kind of grain to feed fattening cattle, this likewise 
depends largely on the cattle and the kind of dry roughage. 
When rather young steers are being fattened, it is the com- 
mon opinion that a more nitrogenous ration should be used; 
hence it is considered the better plan to provide much protein 
for the young animals, whereas in the case of older and more 
mature cattle the grain ration often contains less protein. 
While this plan is usually recommended, it is well to remember 
that a ration rich in nitrogenous material has a tendency to
-P-A-G-E-319
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 291 
keep the young cattle growing rather than to fatten them.) 
While it is true that young stock thus fed will make gains more 
rapidly and more cheaply, the cattle will oftentimes lack in finish 
because they have been growing rather than fattening. /The 
kind of roughage determines, in part, the kind of grain that 
should be fed. When the cattle are being fed a dry roughage 
containing much protein, as clover, alfalfa, or cowpea hay, the 
grain may contain a correspondingly less amount of protein. 
On the other hand, when the dry forage lacks the protein, the de- 
ficiency should be made up by feeding a grain rich in protein, 
as cotton-seed or linseed meal. In addition, the length of the 
fattening period will have an influence on the kind of grain to 
feed. If the period is short, it will be necessary to feed very 
fattening foods, such as corn and cotton-seed meal, from the 
beginning; whereas if the cattle are to be fed 150 days or more, 
they may be given foods containing less fat during the early 
stages of the feeding period. 
BABY-BEEF 
By baby-beef is meant fat cattle between one and two years 
of age and weighing from 800 to 1100 pounds. Of recent years 
much has been written concerning the advantages of producing 
this class of beef. A general perusal of the recent literature on 
beef production would lead one to think that it is far more 
profitable to produce beef from young animals than from ani- 
mals possessing some age, and yet the practical cattle feeder has 
continued to employ two-year-old cattle in his feeding opera- 
tions. The experiment literature has in a large measure 
fostered the idea that beef could be more profitably produced 
by feeding younger cattle. These recommendations are based 
largely on the fact that the younger animal will make much 
more economical gains than older animals. There are, however, 
many factors besides economic gains entering into profitable beef 
production.  
-P-A-G-E-320
  292 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS k 
Cattle used_in baby-beef production. — First of all, the cattle 
must be young. They must be well bred and of fine quality, 
as such cattle can be finished for the market at a much younger 
age than the plainer kinds. The cattle to be used in the pro- 
duction of baby-beef should not be permitted to lose their calf 
fat. They must be kept fleshy from start to finish, for if once 
they get run down in flesh, it is very difficult to make them 
prime under eighteen months of age. 
Feeding for baby-beef production. — If young animals are to 
be made fat, they must be fed liberally on fat-producing feeds, 
particularly grain. Heavier grain feeding is required in the 
production of baby-beef than of older beef. Calves and yearlings 
have a tendency to grow rather than to fatten, and to overcome 
this they must be fed a heavy ration of grain, a fact not to 
be lost sight of in figuring the cost. In the beginning the calf 
should be fed considerable quantities of dry forage, such as 
clover, alfalfa, or cowpea hay, as such foods have a tendency 
to increase the digestive capacity of the calf, thereby enabling 
it to handle large quantities of grain later on. If heifer calves 
instead of steers are fed, they wil! finish more quickly and 
hence should be marketed earlier. The younger the prime 
heifers are at the time of the marketing, the less discrimination 
in price the butcher will make between them and steers. In 
feeding for baby-beef, the most common mistake is to market 
the animals before they are fat enough. There is little likeli- 
hood of getting them too fat to meet the demands of the 
market. 
Advantages of baby-beef production. —'The production of baby- 
beef has two very distinct and outstanding advantages over that 
of older beef. First, young animals require less food for a given 
gain than older animals. Second, the same capital invested in 
young animals produces more meat than in older animals. 
During recent years these two advantages have been much 
heralded by experimenters, and while at first sight they may
-P-A-G-E-321
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 293 
seem to be the beginning and the end of beef production, they 
are nevertheless far from it. While, possibly, each advantage 
has been exaggerated, they are both certainly true, and since 
there is an abundance of experimental data to prove them, 
we will let them stand as unimpeachable. 
Disadvantages of baby-beef production. — The production of 
baby-beef is not without its disadvantages, most of which have 
been lost sight of because of the lack of practical knowledge on 
the part of its exponents. Chief among the disadvantages are: 
first, the difficulty of obtaining cattle possessing sufficient quality 
to make choice baby-beef. Second, the marked difficulty in 
making the younger animals fat, it requiring a heavy grain 
ration. Third, since much baby-beef finds its way to market 
lacking in finish, it fails to command a high price. Fourth, 
cattle possessing sufficient quality being scarce, the cost price of 
such animals is high and because they lack finish on the market 
the selling price is low; hence the margin between cost and selling 
price is small. Fifth, the initial weight of the calf is small; hence 
in the production of baby-beef the cattle feeder cannot depend 
for his profit on the advance in value to the hundredweight on 
the initial weight.J From the foregoing it must be apparent 
that there are mahy questions involved in the production of 
baby-beef, and that the profit is not in proportion to the cheap- 
ness of the gains. 
FEEDING CATTLE FOR THE LOCAL MARKET 
Feeding cattle for the local meat market varies greatly from 
feeding for a large central market. The agricultural writers 
and practically all of the experiment literature give advice on 
feeding cattle by the car-load and for the large central market, 
yet according to the best figures obtainable nearly one-half 
the cattle slaughtered in this country are slaughtered by local 
butchers. 
The local butcher in small places cannot charge enough for
-P-A-G-E-322
  294 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
meat to warrant his paying a high price for the cattle he kills; 
hence he usually purchases plain butcher cattle. As a rule, 
the local slaughter houses are 
not equipped to handle heavy 
cattle; the cuts of meat are 
usually retailed in small 
amounts; therefore, the local 
butcher demands a_ rather 
small animal, weighing from 
600 to 1000 pounds. The 
local butcher cannot pay for 
Fic. 92.—A Sreer roar maps ex- high finish. Thick fat cattle 
Seaplane Laney pemeie on 4 SIX Garry too much waste. Grass- 
fat cattle can be made to 
carry sufficient flesh for the local butcher. While no con- 
sumer, rich or poor, wishes to pay for waste fat, yet highest 
quality of beef is impossible without considerable quantities 
of such waste. There is, however, no demand in the local 
market for beef carrying waste fat, no matter how excellent its 
quality. 
From the foregoing it is apparent that the cattle feeder who 
plans to feed cattle for the local market and make a profit should 
procure heifers, young cows, or low-grade steers as his feeding 
stock, since such cattle can be purchased at a low price. These 
cattle must be fattened as economically as possible, largely on 
dry forage or on pasture, and then sold before they become too 
fat to meet the demands of the local market. This class of 
butcher cattle can be very profitably produced on farms lying 
east, south, and west of the corn-belt. Perhaps the greatest 
handicap to profitable beef production in these regions is lack of 
suitable pasture land. That much of the land in these regions 
can be made to grow pastures suitable for the profitable 
production of this grade of beef no longer admits of doubt 
(page 286). 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 295 
HOGS FOLLOWING GRAIN-FED CATTLE 
Among grain-fed cattle, hogs are considered indispensable to 
profitable beef production. Cattle receiving a rather heavy 
grain ration fail to digest the grain completely, and hogs, if 
- given a chance, will pick up this grain and convert it into pork. 
So great is the saving thus effected that beef production is sel- 
dom profitable without the hog. The principal questions in 
connection with hogs following grain-fed cattle are: the kind 
of hogs to use, the number of hogs to a steer, the advisability 
of feeding the hogs grain in addition to what they get from the 
droppings, and the gains that the hogs may be expected to 
make. 
The most satisfactory hog to follow grain-fed cattle is one 
weighing approximately 100 pounds and thin in flesh. If the 
hogs are too heavy or too fat, they do not make good rustlers, 
and will fail to find all the droppings, especially in pasture. 
On the other hand, it is not good practice to use pigs too young 
because of the danger of injury from the cattle. Brood sows 
are oftentimes used to follow cattle. They are not likely to 
be good rustlers, however, and will fail to find many of the 
droppings, especially if heavy with pig. 
The advisability of feeding grain in addition to that ob- 
tained from the droppings will depend much on the conditions. 
If the price of cattle is high and that of hogs low, one would 
prefer to allow the hogs only what they gather from the drop- 
pings; whereas if the price of hogs is high and cattle low, 
then it would no doubt be more profitable to feed the hogs 
in addition, especially since hogs are more economical feeders 
than cattle. The great majority of cattle feeders use grain in 
addition to that secured from the droppings. 
The number of hogs to follow each steer will depend on two 
conditions: the form in which the grain is fed, whole or ground; 
and whether extra grain is fed in addition to that obtained 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    296 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
from the droppings. When grain is fed extra, the number of 
hogs to each steer will depend on the amount of grain thus fed. 
The common practice is to put a 100-pound hog behind each 
steer and feed grain in addition. If, however, grain is not fed 
in addition, one hog to two steers will be sufficient to pick up 
the grain of the droppings when the grain is fed to the steer in 
the whole form, and one pig to four steers when the grain is fed in 
the form of meal. There is much less available material for the 
hogs when the grain is fed in the form of meal than when fed 
as shelled or ear corn. 
The gains that may be expected from hogs following steers 
will depend on the method. When meal is fed, the gains will 
be less than when the grain is fed whole; and when grain in 
addition is fed, the gains will depend entirely on the amount 
of grain that is fed to the hogs. When one 100-pound hog is 
placed behind each steer and grain fed in addition, as is the 
common practice, the cattle feeder expects to secure at least 
. one pound gain on each hog daily for a period of 100 days. By 
this time the hogs are weighing over 200 pounds and are too 
heavy to make good rustlers, so they are withdrawn from the 
feed lots and another drove of 100-pound hogs placed with 
the cattle. The 200-pound hogs may be marketed at once or 
fed extra grain for two weeks, by which time they average 
better than 225 pounds each when they are put on the market. 
GETTING CATTLE ‘‘ON FEED” 
There is no more important question connected with cattle 
feeding than that of getting the cattle on a full feed of grain, 
meaning by full feed all the grain they will consume. Opin- 
jon differs widely as to the time that should be required, some 
very successful cattle feeders employing the so-called short 
method, that is, getting the cattle on full feed in one to two 
weeks, whereas others equally as successful employ the long 
method, taking one to two months. Which of these methods
-P-A-G-E-325
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 297 
one should choose will depend somewhat on the length of the 
feeding period and the amount of grain that the cattle feeder 
plans to feed. 
LENGTH OF FEEDING PERIOD 
The length of the cattle feeding period is extremely variable, 
ranging from ninety days to fifteen months. Either of these ex- 
tremes or any intervening time may be profitable under certain 
conditions. There are several factors affecting the length of 
the feeding period, chief of which are the kinds of foods, the 
quality and condition of the cattle, and the age of the cattle. If 
the cattle feeder wishes to feed a relatively large proportion of 
dry forage and a small amount of grain, the fattening process 
will be slow and the feeding period prolonged; whereas if he 
wishes to feed a maximum amount of grain and a correspondingly 
small amount of dry forage, the fattening process will be acceler- 
ated and the period shortened. If the steers are rough and of 
such poor quality that they cannot be made prime, the feeding 
period may be of shorter duration than if the steers are of finer 
breeding, and of good quality; the extra finish requires much 
time, but it is considered profitable because of the premium 
commanded in the market. Furthermore, the age of the cattle 
affects the length of the feeding period, as in common practice 
it requires from ninety to one hundred and fifty days to finish 
mature cattle and approximately fifteen months to finish 
calves, with intervening ages ranging between these extremes. 
MARKETABLE CONDITION 
The cattle feeder is often at a loss to know just when to mar- 
ket his cattle. The problem is complicated all the more by the 
fact that the finishing process is a very expensive one, and yet 
this extra finish is what commands the premium of the market. 
The butcher at the large central market demands excessive fat- 
ness, and for it he is willing to pay an extra price, whereas the
-P-A-G-E-326
  
298 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
local butcher fails to appreciate such finish and may even 
discriminate against it, saying that his patrons will object to the 
waste fat. Much depends on the market also; if there is a light 
demand and a heavy run of extra fat cattle, the butchers will

The Aberdeen Angus breed of beef cattle developed in northeastern Scotland. 
Like the Hereford, Angus mature early, but lack the size of the Shorthorn, 
cows weighing around 1400 pounds, bulls 2000, and finished steers 1000 to 
1400 pounds. The steers are unexceled for fattening in the feed lot and are 
held in high esteem by the butchers, although if made too large they are likely to 
become coarse. They are all black and hornless. 
take advantage and bid down the price, whereas if there is a light 
run and a heavy demand for cattle showing much finish, the 
butchers will bid up the price accordingly. Therefore, the ques- 
tion as to when the cattle are ready for the market cannot be 
answered without a knowledge of, first, the age of the cattle ;
-P-A-G-E-327
  
FEEDING BEEF CATTLE 299 
second, the quality of the cattle; third, the relative cost of put- 
ting cattle in prime condition compared with the cost of merely 
“warming them up”; and fourth, a knowledge of the condition 
of the market. 
The more prominent indications of a finished steer are fullness 
at base of tongue, a roll of fat in front of the point of the 
shoulder, a full thick flank that stands out as the animal walks, 
a large mellow cod, a full twist, and fullness at the tail-head. 
When to market cattle. — As to where and when to buy feeders, 
no definite statement can bemade. The demand for extra prime 
beef, such as is used by the high-grade hotels and restaurants, 
is fairly good every month. There is an extra demand for 
such beef during the Christmas season, beginning about Novem- 
ber 20 when the Christmas order for export beef begins to come 
and continuing to about the middle of December. ‘There is 
good demand for prime baby-beef the year round, with an 
extra call during the Christmas season. Export cattle are in 
greatest demand in the winter and spring months; Canada 
supplies the demand in the late summer and fall. Common 
cattle are in greatest demand in the spring months, as after the 
first of July they corhe into competition with the cheap western 
range cattle. 
SHIPPING CATTLE 
There are some precautions that should be taken in getting 
cattle ready for shipment. The object sought is to ship the cat- 
tle with as little “drift” or loss in weight as possible. While 
there are those who manage the cattle in such a way as .to induce 
them to drink an unusual amount of water when they reach the 
market, thus securing an abnormal fill, such practice is far from 
commendable. _ Cattle buyers are always on the lookout for such 
cattle and discriminate heavily against them. On the other 
hand, it is perfectly legitimate for the cattle feeder to take such 
precautions as will insure his animals against the likelihood of 
scouring and to prevent abnormal shrinking in weight.
-P-A-G-E-328
  300 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Preparing cattle for shipment. — Since there are certain foods 
that have a tendency towards loosening the bowels, such should 
be withheld for at least 24 hours before shipment. Chief among 
the foods likely to scour cattle are shelled corn, corn meal, oil 
meal, clover, alfalfa, cowpea hay, and green grass. In fact, a full 
grain ration of any kind is likely to loosen the bowels. There- 
fore, for 24 hours before shipment the cattle should be shut up 
in a dry lot, fed grain sparingly, but may have all the timothy 
hay they like. Oats make a very good grain to feed at this 
time. Water should be withheld four hours before shipment. 
The car in which the cattle are to be shipped should be well 
bedded with straw. If in addition to these precautions it is 
not overloaded, the cattle should arrive at the market fresh and 
clean. Cattle thus treated will make a normal fill. Several car 
loads of cattle thus treated have been shipped a 36 to 40 hour 
journey without unloading on only a 3 per cent drift or loss. 
Drifting cattle for the local market. — When the fat cattle are 
sold on the local market instead of shipping, it is customary in 
some localities to sell them on a 3 per cent drift, taking the 
weight at the farm. From the fact that cattle can be shipped 
40 hours on a 3 per cent drift, this would seem to be the maxi- 
mum that should be allowed the local buyer, and this should be 
on weights taken at the farm where the animals are fed.

  CHAPTER XIII 
BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 
Tue breeding of cattle for the production of beef should re- 
ceive more attention from the general farmer than is being ac- 
corded it at the present time.. During the past decade the breed- 
ing of beef cattle on the common farms has been on the decline, 
especially in the north and central part of the country. For- 
merly, in traveling over this section, it was not an uncommon 
sight to see large herds of well-bred beef cattle grazing, often 
on permanent pasture, while at present such a herd is so un- 
common as to elicit much comment. As has been pointed 
out in the discussion on purchasing feeding cattle, the reasons 
for this decline in beef breeding are many, the chief one being 
that there is more money to be made in other branches of 
farming. Along with this decline in breeding there has been 
an increase in consumption, until the problem of supplying the 
demand for beef has taken on a serious aspect. The remedy 
for this is only to breed more and better beef-producing animals. 
No doubt other branches of farming are more profitable for 
that section of the country lying west of the Sciota, north of the 
Ohio, and east of the Missouri rivers, yet such may not be true 
of the immediate surrounding territory. In this outlying ter- 
ritory there is land not well -suited to growing grain that with 
proper management can be turned to the profitable production 
of beef cattle (pages 276, 290). 
The chief defect of the common cattle is their lack of quality 
and uniformity. This is due both to the lack of good blood and 
x 305
-P-A-G-E-334
  306 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
to the indiscriminate admixture of the blood of the several breeds 
of both beef and dairy types. Proof of this is not wanting. In 
traveling about the country one notes a great variation in the 
type, form, and especially the color of the animals in each herd. 
In many small herds one often sees red, white, black, brindle, 
and all conceivable combinations of these colors, as well as in- 
  Fic. 94.—Herrerorp Cow. First prize winner, International Live Stock Show. 
The Hereford beef cattle originated in the county from which they take their 
name in England. In size this breed is a close second to the Shorthorn. 
Herefords are noted for their early maturing qualities and for their good 
grazing qualities; on the ranges they are often preferred to the Shorthorn. 
This breed lacks the full quarters of the Shorthorn. The color is red, with 
white markings. Herefords are often called ‘“ White Faces.” 
dividual animals that conform in a measure to the strictly beef 
form, others of the dairy form, with all gradations between the 
two. There is lack of uniformity in all respects. Before any 
community can improve its cattle, it must decide upon a plan, 
and each person must proceed largely along the lines of this 
well developed idea. 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  
BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 307 
PLAN OF BREEDING 
Before deciding upon a plan of breeding beef cattle one should 
make a careful study of his conditions; he should visit farms. 
where beef cattle are successfully bred, noting conditions and 
comparing with hisown. Such improvement as he may be able 
to bring about must be upon the common native cattle of the 
community. To dispose of the native cattle and purchase well- 
bred uniform cattle would be very expensive and in most 
cases very unprofitable. The task is then to adopt some plan 
of breeding that will result in an improvement of the native 
stock. In most cases this can be most profitably accomplished 
by the grading-up process; that is, by the use of pure-bred 
bulls on the native common females. 
Coéperative grading-up. — A very successful plan to improve 
the beef-producing qualities of the cattle of a locality is by the 
coéperative grading-up method. The formation of beef-breed- 
ing associations throughout a given locality would do much to 
advance the progress of the industry. Each association should 
have for its object the production and improvement of high- 
grade and pure-bred beef cattle, and should be formed of breed- 
ers who possess the same class or breed of cattle. It would be 
the duty of such an association to protect the interest of its mem- 
bers, provide suitable bulls each year for use on the cows owned 
by the members, advertise stock, attract buyers, hold sales, call 
meetings for the discussion of beef breeding and feeding matters, 
and to educate the farmers of the locality to better methods of 
caring for live-stock. 
Raise heifer calves from best cows. — Because of the excellency 
of the heifer calves from the good cows, the cattle feeder is 
tempted to fatten them for beef. This should not be done. 
They should be reserved for breeding purposes. Many catile 
breeders are actually reducing the quality of their beef-produc- 
ing herd by fattening the best calves and reserving the poorer 
ones for breeding because they will not make good feeders.  
-P-A-G-E-336
  308 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
SELECTION OF BREEDING STOCK 
The best cattle should be retained and propagated and the 
poorer animals discarded. In a very few generations, by em- 
ploying such a method, the common cattle of the country 
could be greatly improved. It is the application of haphazard 
methods that has resulted in the lack of character that exists 
among our common native cattle. 
The breed. — Choose the breed that best suits the conditions, 
the markets, and the fancy of the breeders. There is no best 
breed of beef cattle for all conditions. There is much variation 
in the temperament, size, and 
quality of product among the 
leading beef breeds. Whether 
Shorthorns, Herefords, Angus, or 
Galloways should be chosen de- 
pends on the attendant condi- 
tions and the personal preference 
among the breeders and feeders. 
The Shorthorns have excellent 
Fis. 95.— Campion HEREFORD hind-quarters and nick well with

fords mature early and are excellent grazers. The Angus ma- 
ture fairly early, produce a high quality of beef, and are much 
sought on the markets. They are hornless though rather 
nervous. The Galloways produce high quality beef, are 
hornless, and often possess good coets of hair; the hides are 
much sought for tanning, and are used in manufacturing 
coats, robes, and the like. The breed itself is never so 
important as is the individuality and the uniformity. 
Crossing. — For the propagation of animals intended solely for 
beef many experienced cattle breeders and feeders prefer a Short- 
horn-Hereford cross, contending that the cross-bred steer in-

BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 309 
herits the good grazing and early maturing qualities of the Here- 
ford and the desirable hind-quarters of the Shorthorn. But it 
must be understood that this cross-bred offspring should not 
be used for breeding, no matter how excellent an individual, 
for the second generation is very likely to inherit the poor 
qualities or other qualities of both ancestors. 
The dual-purpose cow. — By dual-purpose cow is meant one 
capable of yielding a good flow of milk, and in which the offspring 
will make a fair quality of beef as will the cow when dried off. 
This is the so-called ‘‘farmer’s cow,” concerning the profitable- 
ness of which there is much discussion. Because of the high 
price of land over much of the grain belt, it is no longer profit- 
able to keep a cow merely for the calf she raises. This has led 
to the opinion that it is possible to develop a strain of dual- or 
double-purpose cattle, one that while raising a calf that would 
make a fair quality of beef would also yield milk sufficient to pay 
for her keep. 
The demand for such double-purpose animals has led a few 
of the breeders, of at least three of the established breeds, Short- 
horn, Red Polled, and Devon, to endeavor to breed such animals. 
In the breeding of such cattle there are two very pertinent ques- 
tions to be considered: First, the amount of milk or butter-fat 
that should be expected; and second, the degree of excellency 
in beef production that should be sought among the offspring. 
These questions assume much importance, for, aswe havealready | 
seen, the type suited to the production of milk is ill adapted to 
the production of beef, and the type that takes on beef economi- 
cally is not likely to make good milkers. Dual-purpose cattle 
breeders vary widely in their opinion as to the amount of milk 
and fat that should be expected as well as the excellency sought 
-in the calves. While the flow and fat required to make a profit 
will vary according to conditions, yet if one can secure 5000 to 
7000 pounds, yielding 200 to 250 pounds of butter-fat yearly, 
and a calf of sufficient quality to reach a weight of 350 pounds

  810 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
by the time it is 6 months of age, there should be no difficulty in 
realizing a handsome profit, providing, of course. that the prod- 
ucts are marketed to advantage (Fig. 96). 
Instead of procuring dual-purpose strains of cattle, some 
persons suggest breeding the dairy cows to a beef bull, thus 
producing a half-blood beef animal. They recommend the 
following plan: Since a good 
cow, properly cared for, may be 
profitably milked for a period of 
six to eight years, during which 
time she is likely to produce 
three or four heifer calves, only 
one-third to one-fourth of the 
cows need be bred to a dairy 
bull; or the breeding of the

ample of a dual-purpose cow. sired by a beef bull. Such a plan 
is likely to encounter practical 
difficulties that would render its serviceability doubtful. It 
would no doubt result in the production of calves of little value 
to maintain a dairy herd and with doubtful value as feeding 
cattle. It would also be extremely hazardous to attempt to 
maintain a dairy herd with only one-fourth to one-third of 
the calves to select from. 
Uniformity. —Lack of uniformity is one of the greatest faults 
connected with breeding common cattle. As it is now, each 
locality is producing cattle of a number of types and breeds. 
Such cattle are not desirable feeding animals, as they will 
not finish or fatten evenly and must be sent to market 
lacking in uniformity in type, color, weight, quality, and con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 311 
ditions. Mixed droves of cattle of this kind are not desired 
on any market, and hence are discriminated against and 
must sell for an exceedingly low price. On the other hand, if 
each farmer in the locality would conform with the majority 
of his neighbors and codperate in propagating the same breed, 
even though this breed may not be the one that suits his fancy 
best or even the one that is best suited to the district, until 
the community became noted for the production of such a 
breed, then a cattle feeder in search of any particular type 
should be able to go to the district noted for the production of 
the breed required and there find cattle in sufficient numbers 
to meet all needs. 
THE BEEF BULL 
To the bull we must look for the improvement of the 
common cattle. To secure the improvement in a herd of 
cattle through the females would require the use of forty 
or more superior cows to accomplish the same results as 
might be secured by the use of a single bull, and even then 
there would be less uniformity in the offspring. This is be- 
cause the bull controls one-half the characters of the entire 
crop of calves. This has led to the assertion that ‘the bull 
is half the herd.” This assertion is misleading in a way, for 
when it comes to herd improvement, he is even more than 
one-half the herd. 
The cost of a bull. — Among dairymen who keep a record of 
the production of their cows, there is a fair knowledge of the 
value of a good bull, while those who breed feeding cattle seem 
to lack such information, or at least ignore it entirely. From 
this it must not be inferred that one should pay a fancy price 
for a beef bull. Many general farmers are depending on 
practically worthless grade and scrub bulls to head the herds 
of grade cows. Properly cared for, a bull should sire forty 
calves in a season. Suppose the bull is of sufficient quality

    312 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
to increase the value of each calf $5, a very conservative 
estimate, then he makes $200 with his first crop of calves. 
One-half of this sum will bring a very desirable bull of any of 
the leading beef breeds into any locality. Such a bull in- 
troduced into a locality can be made to pay for himself the

The Galloway breed of beef cattle originated in southwestern Scotland, adjacent 
to the sea, where the breed developed much hardiness. Though neither so 
early maturing nor so large as the Angus, the flesh is of good quality. This 
breed is particularly noted for its fine coat of hair, which seems to be com- 
posed of two parts, a very fine, short under growth and a long, wavy outer 
growth. The hides are often used to manufacture coats, robes, and the like.

first year. When once a desirable bull is procured, he should 
be retained as long as he remains a true breeder. Bulls 
possessing some age are likely to be difficult to control, and 
many an excellent sire has been sold for beef simply because 
the owner was afraid he would injure some one.
-P-A-G-E-341
BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 813 
THE BEEF COW 
While all common cows must be bred in order that they 
may freshen, yet the cows to which we look to replenish the 
herd should be carefully selected. The heifer calves from the 
best cows should be retained for breeding. By using a good 
pure-bred sire and retaining the best heifers to replenish the 
herd, in a few generations one can have a herd of cows equal 
to any pure-bred herd for the production of feeding cattle. 
The production-period in cattle. — As in the dairy cow, the 
most fertile period is two to eight years of age. In exceptional 
cases this period may be extended both ways (see page 246). 
Season of the year to breed.— While it seems desirable to have 
dairy calves dropped in the fall, it is equally desirable to have 
beef calves dropped in the spring. With dairy cattle, a some- 
what larger flow can be ob- 
tained when calves come in the 
fall. With beef cattle the milk 
flow is not so important. Cows 
may be wintered more cheaply 
when not in milk, requiring less 
room, less careful attention, 
and less food. Calves dropped 
in the spring get a good start 
on pasture. They need be car- . . Fic. 98.—Gattoway Hetrers. True

they can be fattened or finished 
the following fall when approximately eighteen months of age, 
if it is so desired; or if desired to fatten them during the 
winter, they can be finished the second winter and put on 
the market at two years of age. Fall-dropped calves are 
more trouble to care for during the winter, although the advo- 
cates of fall-dropped beef calves say that better steers can be 
produced and developed by fall calving, as the cow in the fall 
   
-P-A-G-E-342
  314 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
is in better condition; they also say that the increased flow 
of milk caused by turning the cow to pasture in the spring is 
a good thing for the calf, and that the fall-dropped calf is 
better able to endure the heat and flies the following summer. 
After a careful consideration of both practices, the writer 
thinks it desirable to have the beef calves dropped in spring. 
A very important factor in the breeding of calves for feeding 
is to breed the cows in such a way that the calves will be as 
nearly uniform in age as possible. This applies to both fall 
and spring bred calves that are intended for feeding. Farmers 
who possess only a few cows have them freshen at intervals 
throughout the year in order that they may be well supplied 
with milk the year round. This, of course, makes the calves of 
unequal age, and they are not so desirable as feeding cattle. 
The pregnant cow. — The pregnant cow should receive some 
attention, particularly when she is to drop her calf in the 
spring. Cows are often carried through the winter on a 
ration of dry forage, such as corn stalks with no grain 
in addition, with the result that they are in very poor 
condition at calving time. This often leads to trouble at 
parturition time, the cow being so weak she cannot bear the 
calf, which is likely to be very small, thin, and weakly. 
The cow may not have milk for it at first, or if she does, 
it will be thin and scant. Such a condition must be avoided 
if profitable feeding calves are to be propagated. If the 
pregnant cow may have succulence in the shape of corn 
silage, with clover, alfalfa, or cowpea hay in addition, no 
grain need be fed. These feeds should be free from mold. 
On the other hand, if non-nitrogenous dry forage is to be fed, 
she should have grain in addition. Corn and wheat bran with 
a small amount of linseed meal as a conditioner cannot be 
improved upon. This may be fed at the rate of six pounds 
daily per 1000 pounds live weight. Shelter from the storms 
and rain should be provided; for this a common shed open to 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 315 
the south is sufficient except in very cold climates. Pregnant 
cows thus cared for will come through the winter in good con- 
dition and give birth to a strong thrifty calf that, if bred right, 
will make a profitable feeder. 
Cow with calf at foot. — The cow that is to suckle her young 
need not receive the extra care that must be accorded the 
dairy cow. When the calves are dropped in the spring and 
the pasture is of good quality and abundant, the cows and 
calves will require very little attention during the pasture 
season. If, however, the pasture becomes short in late sum- 
mer and fall, extra feed, such as clover, alfalfa, green forage, 
or grain of some kind, should be given. Cows and calves at 
pasture should have free access to fresh water. Salt should 
be supplied at regular intervals.or kept before them at all 
times. Shade of some kind should be provided in the absence 
of trees. 
As soon as convenient the calves should be taught to eat 
grain. This may be done by arranging a small pen with 
small gates or passages through which the calves may enter 
but the cows cannot. The pen may be placed near the water 
tank. By all means calves should be taught to eat grain 
before being weaned, as this will prevent shrinking at weaning 
time. For suckling and weanling calves, the following grain 
mixture proves satisfactory: 3 parts of corn meal, 3 parts 
ground oats, 3 parts of wheat bran, and 1 part of linseed meal. 
When the calves are dropped in the fall, the cow and calf 
will require more careful attention; this, however, comes during 
the winter when there is little urgent work on farms where 
cows are thus kept. The object sought is so to feed and manage 
both cow and calf that they may be brought through the win- 
ter in a healthy and thrifty condition; the cow in order that 
she may properly nourish the suckling and be in condition to 
breed again when so desired, the calf in order that it may make 
a profitable feeding animal, as its future development depends
-P-A-G-E-344
316 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
much upon its growth during the first six months of its 
life. 
If possible, the cow should have some succulent food, as 
corn silage, as such food improves her physical condition and 
encourages the milk flow, thereby giving the calf a more liberal 
supply. Clover, alfalfa, cowpea, or mixed hay should con- 
stitute at least a part of the dry forage, with some grain fed in 
addition. For the grain, a mixture of corn and bran with a 
little linseed meal added cannot be improved upon, and if a 
leguminous dry forage with silage is fed, a small amount of this 
grain, say four pounds daily, will prove ample to keep the cow 
and calf in thriving condition. If the dry forage consists of 
non-leguminous plants only, such as prairie or timothy hay or 
corn stalks, then a somewhat larger grain ration should be fed 
and the proportion of linseed meal may be increased. Pro- 
tection from the storms and rain must be provided. While a 
common shed open to the south will serve where the mercury 
seldom goes below zero, it is not sufficient in colder climates, 
particularly if very moist. On the other hand, the quarters 
must not be dark, damp, and poorly ventilated, as such is the 
ideal place for the propagation of all kinds of calf ills. The 
quarters should be measurably protected, well lighted, well 
ventilated, and dry. Cows and calves thus cared for will come 
through the winter in a thrifty and healthy condition. As on 
pasture, the calves should be taught to eat grain as soon as 
convenient and by all means at least one month before 
weaning. 
The calf that is permitted to suckle its dam can be raised 
with little extra care. It should have attention at birth to 
see that the function of respiration is started, and that it gets 
some of the first or colostrum milk of the dam. If the calf 
scours badly, some of the dam’s milk should be drawn off, 
remembering that the last milk is richer in fat, and is the part 
likely to cause the trouble, After the calf gets a start by proper
-P-A-G-E-345
  
BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 3817 
feeding of the dam, both cow and calf can be kept in healthy 
condition. 
Male calves should be castrated before they have reached 
the age of three months, and this may be done any time after 
the calf is one week old. If hornless animals are desired, the 
herns should be removed with caustic potash as soon as they 
begin to appear (page 255). 
Calves should be weaned at five to eight months of age. 
Weaning is rather a question of preparation than of the 
absolute removal of the calf from the cow, and the simplicity 
of the weaning process depends on the thoroughness of the 
preparation. If the calf has been accustomed to the grain as 
suggested, if it has been permitted to take increasingly more 
as it grows, the process will not be difficult, for as the ration 
increases in the amount of grain it will decrease in the amount 
of milk. With such precaution, there will be very little if any 
set-back or disturbance to calf or dam. On the other hand, 
if the calf must learn to eat after being deprived of its accus- 
tomed source of food supply, it will require time to get used to 
the new condition, and the cow will demand special care, be- 
cause of the removal of the calf before her milk supply has 
been diminished to any extent. 
Weanlings should be well cared for during their first winter 
if they are to make profitable feeding cattle. They sbould 
have snug quarters, with opportunity for exercise, and be well 
fed. Weanling calves are often let run with the stock cattle 
and compelled to subsist entirely on dry forage, with the result 
that they run down in condition and sometimes are stunted, 
from which they never fully recover. A calf that is once 
stunted will not make a good feeding animal. On the other 
hand, if these weanlings are fed a liberal allowance, say four 
pounds daily per head, of the grain mixture suggested for the 
sucking calf, with clover, alfalfa, cowpea, or mixed hays in 
addition, they will come through the winter strong and thrifty
-P-A-G-E-346
  818 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and will give a good account of themselves when fattened the 
following summer. 
Calves cared for as suggested should reach a weight of 
375 to 450 pounds by the time they are six months of age. 
While such calves make very excellent beef when well fed, they 
are nevertheless very expensive, for the breeder must keep the 
cow one year for the production of this 400-pound calf. No 
exact figures can be given as to the cost, for much will depend 
on the conditions. It is true that formerly many calves were 
thus raised in the grain belt, whereas at the present time prac- 
tically none are so raised. It would seem then to be no longer 
profitable on land suited for grain growing. In view of recent 
developments it seems unlikely that the price of beef will go 
high enough to make it a profitable industry. That producing 
such calves can be made a profitable industry in the outlying 
territory of cheap pasture lands, however, admits of no doubt. 
Feeding the beef calf.— If the cow’s milk is desired, the calf 
should be weaned on or before the ninth milking, when the 
milk becomes fit for human consumption. As a rule the earlier 
the calf is weaned the more easily it can be taught to drink 
from the pail. On the other hand, it is better for both cow 
and calf to have the calf suckle as long as possible. The beef 
calf can be taught to drink and changed from whole to skim 
milk much as suggested for the dairy calf (pages 251 to 255). 
There has been much discussion from time to time, among 
beef producers, as to the possibilities of the skim-milk-fed calf 
as a beef-producing animal. In fact, the skim-milk calf as a 
beef producer is not likely to be considered seriously by the 
experienced beef producers of the middle West. To these men 
the skim-milk calf means a stunted, pot-bellied animal with 
papery skin, lacking in quality and thrift, a fit subject for ridi- 
cule, but hardly worth while in the feed lot. That these ex- 
perienced men are justified in their opinion there can be no 
doubt, for the average skim-milk calf has not much to recom-
-P-A-G-E-347
BREEDING BEEF CATTLE 319° 
mend him as a beef-producing animal. On the other hand, 
conditions are rapidly becoming such that we are obliged to 
rely, in part at least, on these skim-milk calves for the coun- 
try’s beef supply. Furthermore, it has been proved that by 
giving the skim-milk calf proper care a fair kind of beef-produc- 
ing animal may result. Such a calf should have extra care 
and be encouraged from the beginning, for it must be remem- 
bered to attempt to make beef from a stunted calf will prove 
an unprofitable venture. They must be kept strong and 
thrifty.
-P-A-G-E-348
  CHAPTER XIV 
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF BEEF CATTLE 
Tue ability to fatten cattle rapidly and quickly is to be 
increased and strengthened by careful study and experience. 
All that may be spoken or written will not make one suc- 
cessful, nor cover his defects, if he does not take kindly to 
the work. Study, observation, and especially practice add to 
the ability of the cattle feeder. The ability to carry a steer 
through a one-hundred-and-eighty-day fattening period without 
once getting him ‘‘off feed’’ is the end to be attained. 
The importance of regularity in everything that pertains to 
the management of feeding cattle cannot easily be overesti- 
mated. This applies particularly to administering feed and 
water. Cattle anticipate the hour of feeding and become 
nervous if it is long delayed; they bellow, coax, and become 
much excited, all of which operates against the economical pro- 
duction of beef. 
Sudden changes in the food are to be avoided, as the digestive 
system is unable to accommodate itself at once to such changes, 
and digestive disorders are likely to follow. Such shifts 
sometimes result in scours, other times in colic, and in fact may 
result in various kinds of indigestion. When necessary to 
change from one food to another, the transfer should be made 
slowly and gradually, replacing the old with the new. 
Scouring is very disastrous and should be carefully avoided, 
as a single day’s laxness may offset a week’s gain. The 
inexperienced feeder is likely to overfeed because of the 
320
-P-A-G-E-349
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF BEEF CATTLE 3821 
desire to push the cattle to better gains, which not only 
often induces scours, but has a tendency to throw the 
cattle off feed. Cattle of about the same size and strength 
should be fed in the same lot or pasture, while weak animals 
and those unable to push their way to the feed-rack and get 
their share should be placed where they can be supplied in 
quiet. Strong animals often push the weak away from the 
feed-troughs, which not only prevents the weaker from feeding, 
but enables the stronger to get an overfeed, resulting in scours 
or other digestive disorders. Unwholesome food, or a fault in 
the feeding mixture, may result in scours. 
At a glance, the successful and experienced cattle feeder 
recognizes the shortcomings among his fattening cattle. By 
going through the feed lots, noting the condition of the 
manure or droppings, their general appearance and odor, by 
noting the feed-boxes and the general conduct of the cattle, he 
is able to discern their needs, and governs himself accordingly. 
The droppings of the steers are an excellent index to the prog- 
ress of fattening cattle. While these droppings should never 
be hard, they should, however, be thick enough to pile up and 
have that greasy or bland appearance that indicates a healthy 
action of the liver. The droppings from steers that are not 
fattening well, or suffering from indigestion, have a disagreeable 
odor. Sour-smelling odors, and thin watery droppings indicate 
something wrong with the feeding cattle. 
The behavior of the cattle is a further index to their general 
thrift and progress in fattening. Their quiet pose while rumi- 
nating; their peculiar loud breathing when lying down, due 
no doubt to the cramped position of the internal organs be- 
cause of a well-filled paunch; the quiet and prominent eyes; 
their manner of approaching the feed-box; the way in which 
they feed; their mellow skin and oily coat; and in fact each 
movement, gives the experienced cattle feeder a clew as to their 
general condition.

  822 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
FARMS FOR FATTENING CATTLE 
While cattle feeding may be conducted on any farm, there 
are two general types of farms on which it is likely to prove 
the more profitable. First, grain farms that grow large quan- 
tities of dry forage incidental to the grain and which would be 
otherwise largely wasted; second, pasture farms, where for 
some reason grain cannot be successfully grown and where 
the land is suitable for pasture. 
EQUIPMENT FOR SUMMER FEEDING 
In considering the profits likely to result from steer feeding, 
among the first items to be taken into account is the equip- 
ment. While the equipment for beef production is not nearly 
as extensive as for milk production, there are, nevertheless, a 
few necessities to be provided. Since the equipment for sum- 
mer feeding on pasture differs from that of winter feeding in 
the dry-lot, each will be considered separately. 
The necessary equipment for summer feeding on pasture 
consists of the pasture, the feeding-boxes or bunks, water, 
shade, and salt. 
Pasture. — The importance of properly managed pastures 
cannot be overestimated. The general management, such as 
the importance of a good stand of grass; of keeping down the 
weeds; of providing suitable drainage; of top dressing with 
barnyard manure when convenient; and of not turning to 
pasture too early in the spring, was discussed on pages 284 to 
289. It was there shown that many pastures that are now 
supporting one animal to three or four acres could, with very 
little extra care, be made to support an animal to the acre with- 
out feed in addition, or two animals to one acre by the use 
of additional feed, such as is commonly practiced in the beef- 
producing localities of the central West.
-P-A-G-E-351
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF BEEF CATTLE 328 
Feed-bunk.— While any kind of durable box or trough, slightly 
elevated, may be used in feeding grain, a feed-bunk similar 
to those illustrated in Fig. 99 will prove the most efficient. 
These feed-bunks are three feet wide, fifteen feet long, inside di- 
mension, and two and one-half feet high. They are constructed 
as follows: From a 4” X 4” scantling cut six posts two and 
one-half feet long, bevel off the top of each so as to shed water 
and prevent the sharp corners from injuring the cattle. Cut 
three 2’ X12” plank sixteen feet long and six 2’’X4’”’s four feet 
long. Place two of the 2” X 4’”s, edges up, ona level place, in 
such a position that when the sixteen foot plank are placed upon 
them, the plank will project over one inch on either end, thus 
leaving the 2’ X 4’”s fifteen and one-half feet apart, inside 
dimensions. Spike or, better still, bolt the three 2’” X 12’ plank 
to these 2” X 4’”s, leaving six inches clear on either end of the 
2” X 4'"s. Place a third 2’ X 4” under the three planks two 
inches to one side of the middle, and spike or bolt fast, leaving 
six inches on either end of the 2” X 4” projecting as before. 
Cut two 2” X 8” plank sixteen feet long and place one, edge up, 
either side of the platform, thus making a box; spike fast to the 
2” X 12’’s and to the 2” X 4’”s. Elevate the box thus con- 
structed, and with six 8” bolts, bolt fast to the 4” X 4’ posts, 
thus making a bunk as illustrated in Fig. 99. Cut two 
2” X 6’’s approximately three feet long for the ends. This 
should be accurately measured in order to fit tightly. Place the 
remaining three 2’’ X 4’”s under the box on the opposite side 
of the 4” X 4” posts, bolt and spike all together. Invert the 
bunk and batten the cracks with 1” x 3’”s, otherwise the timber 
in the bunk will dry out, leaving cracks through which the grain 
will leak. This bunk can be materially strengthened by plac- 
ing three 4’ rods across, one at either end and one in the 
center. One bunk of the dimensions given will be sufficient to 
accommodate fifteen to twenty cattle, depending on their size. 
Any kind of lumber may be used, but oak is the more durable

and will make a stronger bunk. Such a bunk can be moved 
from place to place. 
The self-feeder is a feed box or bin holding a large amount of 
grain and so arranged that part of the grain is accessible to 
the cattle at all times. The great advantage stated for self- 
feeders is that they save labor. They have been used with vary- 
ing success, some cattle feeders using them continuously, others 
using them one or two years and then abandoning them. In 
some localities the self-feeder is common, in others not known. 
Shade. — When there are trees in the pastures, the matter of 
shade need receive no attention, but in the absence of natural 
shade, some provision should be made for it especially during 
the hot, dry weather when the flies are troublesome. Droves 
of fattening cattle occasionally become so excited, due to the 
excessive heat and flies, that they bunch up or stampede and 
sometimes injure each other, or whoever comes in their way. 
Water. — Fattening cattle must be supplied with an abun- 
dance of fresh water at all times. Many pastures through- 
out the country are not thus supplied. As a rule beef 
cannot be produced economically on such farms. The hotter 
and dryer the weather, the more the cattle need, and this is just 
the time there is likely to be a shortage. In the absence of 
running water, perhaps the most efficient source is a good well, 
equipped with a wind pump. When the water is pumped by 
hand and the drove of cattle large, the water supply is likely 
to be deficient. It is also important that the water be fresh 
and clean. Hot, stale, and muddy water, laden with mosquito 
larve and other impurities, is not fit for cattle to drink. 
Something better than mud-holes should be supplied. 
Salt should either be kept before the feeding cattle at all 
times or supplied them regularly twice each week. A very 
-good plan is to cut a common salt barrel in two at the middle 
and place one-half where. the cattle can have free access to it. 
This should be under a shed, as rain dissolves the salt.

The equipment for feeding cattle in the winter deserves 
special attention; not that it is difficult or expensive but 
that the proper kind of equipment is often neglected and 
much money expended for items that are not only unnecessary 
but positively objectionable. The most particular item is 
that of efficient shelter. Other items are the feed-lot and its 
location, the racks from which to feed dry forage, and the 
like. 
Shelter for winter feeding. — While it is essential to provide 
warm winter quarters for the dairy cow, because she is thin in 
flesh and because of the nature of her product, such warm 
quarters are not necessary for the fattening steer. The fat- 
tening steer possesses a coat of fat or flesh which serves to 
protect him from the cold, and when on full feed the heat gen- 
erated in the body by masticating, digesting, and assimilating 
the food is sufficient to maintain the body temperature. No 
doubt the needs of the fattening animal are such as to make a 
reasonable amount of cold air beneficial rather than detrimental. 
But it is very desirable that the fattening steer be kept dry 
and provided with a comfortable dry bed. Dry quarters are 
far more important than warm quarters. A structure which 
protects the animals from the rain and snow and provides 
them with a dry comfortable bed is sufficient. ( 
Waters, who has thoroughly investigated the shelter prob- 
lem, concludes his work as follows: ‘Apparently then the only 
shelter required for cattle of this class is that which will protect 
them from rain and snow and break the northwest winds and 
furnish a dry place in which the animals may lie down. It is 
more important that the fattening animal lie down regularly 
and during a large portion of the time than that he be pro- 
tected from the cold. An abundance of sunshine and fresh air, 
a comfortable place in which to lie, and freedom from external
-P-A-G-E-355
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF BEEF CATTLE 321 
disturbances furnish ideal conditions for rapid and economic 
gains.” 
The feed-lot.— Relatively too little attention is given the feed- 
lot. In choosing the location of the lot, consideration should 
be given to drainage and the natural protection. A south 
slope is the most desirable, as the water will drain off quickly 
after a rain, and the full benefit of the sun’s rays will be received. 
A muddy lot is one of the greatest objections to winter feeding. 
Over much of the grain belt the soil is rather impervious to 
water, which is held at the surface. The cattle in walking 
mix the water with the soil, which is often clay, thus making 
a most disagreeable mud. 
The only known corrective for such lots is to pave them, or 
at least in part, particularly where the animals must lie and 
where the feed-bunks and racks are placed. For this purpose 
various materials are used, chief of which are cobble stones, 
bricks, cement, and plank. Before laying the pavement a 
grade should be established slightly higher than the sur- 
rounding surface, to eliminate the surface water. The grade 
should have a slope of at least one inch to six feet. The surface 
should then be covered with six inches of gravel rolled and 
tamped down solid; over this place a one-inch covering of fine 
sand on which the brick or cobble stone may be laid. Roll, 
or better still, tamp down solid. Over this should be placed a 
cement mortar of the consistency of cream made by thoroughly 
mixing one part clean sharp sand and one part of Portland 
cement. This mixture should be thoroughly swept into the 
joints and cracks. A second coat of the cement mortar may be 
laid in ten days to insure the complete filling of the cracks and 
joints. A feed-lot thus paved will be free from mud, can be 
cleaned with team and scraper, and makes a very desirable 
place on which to feed catile. 
Platform for feed-bunks. — On soils that are porous and from 
which the water drains off rapidly, the mud gives little incon-
-P-A-G-E-356
  328 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
venience except about the feed-bunks, dry-forage-racks, and 
water-tank. About these and extending back six feet, may 
be placed a few loads of coarse gravel or, better still, a pave- 
ment similar to that described above, or a plank platform. 
Whatever the material used in construction, it should be so 
arranged that the farmer may drive alongside the bunk or rack 
with a load of feed. Such platforms will save feed bills enough 
each year to pay for their construction, to say nothing of the 
extra annoyance caused by the mud in case they are not used. 
The same feed-bunks suggested for feeding on pasture may be 
moved to the lot and used for winter feeding as well. As a 
rule, it is not desirable to place the feed-bunk under the shed 
except when the winters are extra severe. 
Dry-forage-rack. — It is not advisable to have the feed-bunks 
and the dry-forage-racks combined, since the litter from the 
dry forage falling upon the grain renders it distasteful to cattle, 
particularly when on a full grain ration. Neither is it advis- 
able to construct such racks under the shed except where the 
climate is very disagreeable, though they should be placed to 
the south of the shed or barn to protect them measurably from 
the winds and driving storms. The form and shape of the dry- 
forage-racks will depend on the condition in which dry forage 
is fed, corn stalks calling for one form, hay for another, and 
chopped hay or shredded fodder for still another. As these racks 
are likely-to be permanent, they should be constructed to meet 
the particular conditions under which they are to be used. 
Water-tanks. — A liberal supply of fresh water is as essential 
for winter feeding as for summer feeding. While water is 
likely to be more plentiful in winter than in summer, it is often 
allowed to freeze for days at a time, so that the cattle are wholly 
deprived of a supply and often compelled to eat snow or lick 
the ice to get the water needed for their bodies. In very severe 
weather cattle are not likely to drink much ice water; this ob- 
servation has led the rather careless cattle feeder to think the
-P-A-G-E-357
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF BEEF CATTLE 3829 
cattle do not need much water at such times. This is a mis- 
taken idea, as fattening cattle need a liberal supply of fresh 
water at all times, even though they will not consume as much 
as in the hot, dry weather of mid-summer.

The Red Polled cattle, natives of Norfolk and Suffolk counties, England, are 
classed as dual purpose. They give good returns in both beef and milk, but 
do not equal the beef cattle for beef or the milk cattle for milk. In size the 
bulls range from 1500 to 2000 pounds, the cows 1200 to 1400 pounds. The 
color is always red, and the horns wanting. 
When the water-tanks are not too large, a very good way to 
prevent freezing, except in very severe weather, is to encase 
the tank in a box or frame and fill this frame with litter from 
the horse stable. The frame should be so constructed as to 
permit the use of a layer of this manure at least one foot 
thick all around the tank. By covering all, both frame and 
tank. with a large lid which is to be shut down at night, and

during a part of the day when the weather is severe, there 
is not much likelihood of the water freezing. A little labor 
spent in constructing such a frame will save many times its 
cost in food, as it requires considerable heat to warm up the 
ice water that cattle drink.

CHAPTER XV 
DISEASES OF CATTLE 
CaTr.E are very subject to certain diseases which render 
their usage for domestic purposes questionable. Milk from 
diseased cows, or meat from diseased carcasses, may endanger 
the lives of those who consume it. While these diseases are 
properly classed as incurable, it should be remembered that 
they are communicable germ diseases and are therefore pre- 
ventable. Therefore, some space will be devoted to their pre- 
vention. In addition to these diseases, cattle are subject to a 
number of ailments, some of which are simple and easily cared 
for, but more of which are somewhat complicated, requiring 
skilled treatment. 
The sick cow should receive much care, as in many cases good 
care is to be preferred to the use of medicine (see page 151). 
This chapter is intended merely to serve as a guide and to 
make suggestions; it is not designed to take the place of a 
good veterinarian, who should always be called in case of 
serious difficulty or doubt. The dosages here advised, except 
when otherwise noted, are for mature animals. 
DISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS, AND DIFFICULTIES OF 
PARTURITION 
There are few diseases to which cattle are subject that are 
of wider interest than those of the generative organs. This is 
particularly true of those herds that are being kept for breed- 
ing purposes and when the principal product is the offspring.

332 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Cattle are particularly subject to a contagious form of abortion 
which destroys many young before they can live out of the womb. 
The principal diseases or difficulties are barrenness ; abortion, 
both contagious and non-contagious; difficult parturition; re- 
tention of the afterbirth; milk-fever; garget. 
Barrenness in cows. — It often happens that cows are served 
normally, yet fail to conceive. Some of the causes of this diffi- 
culty are readily understood and easily prevented, while others 
are not well understood and are beyond control of the breeder. 
An excess of rich and stimulating foods is a common cause of 
non-breeding, especially if the animals are denied exercise. 
The dangers attending parturition are often more than tre- 
bled in the case of fat animals. This excessive fat, however, 
may be of much advantage once these dangers are past. On the 
other hand, barrenness may be due to poor feeding, the system 
being weakened by the lack of sufficient nutrition. Undue 
sexual excitement at the most active stage of heat is often 
responsible for the cow not conceiving. Cows that for some 
reason have missed a season are often difficult to impregnate. 
Animals that are too closely inbred are also likely to be 
barren. In addition to these, there is a long line of causes of 
barrenness in cows over which the breeder has little or no con- 
trol, such as derangement of the sex organs, diseased ovaries, 
tumors, and the like. 
Abortion in cows. — Abortion in cows is either contagious or 
non-contagious. Because of the great differences as to cause 
and subsequent treatment, we consider them separately. 
Non-contagious abortion. — This is produced by any cause 
operating to disconnect the union of the fetal membrane from the 
uterus. A cow may abort by reason of almost any cause that 
very generally disturbs her system, as from the influence of a too 
stimulating diet or the reverse, as when the nourishment is so 
deficient that the fetus dies in the womb; damp, unhealthy 
stables; worms in the bowels, lungs, or liver; indigestion of all
-P-A-G-E-361
  
DISEASES OF CATTLE 333 
kinds; the drinking of putrid, stagnant water; of ice water; 
the eating of iced grass; of ergot, of smuts on corn or other 
grains; and severe illness. The more direct mechanical causes 
are falls, strains, violent exertion, and blows; also traveling on 
icy ground, muddy roads, or jumping over fences, ditches, and 
the like. 
The prevention of non-contagious abortion is the avoidance 
of all causes that are likely to produce it. All causes of excite- 
ment, of constipation, of diarrhea, of indigestion, and the like 
must be avoided. With cattle, non-contagious abortion may 
often be prevented, although the first signs have appeared. So 
long as the fetus has not perished, the waters not discharged, nor 
the water-bags presented, attemvts should be made to check the 
progress. Place the cow alone in a quiet stall and check the 
labor pains if possible. To do this, laudanum given in one ounce 
doses for small cows and two ounce doses for large ones is good. 
Repeat the dose in three or four hours should the labor pains 
recur. When all measures fail and miscarriage results, all that 
can be done is to assist in the removal of the fetus and its mem- 
branes, as in ordinary parturition. 
Contagious abortion in cows. —Though not well understood, 
contagious abortion is known to be due to an organism. The 
germ producing the disease is conveyed by infected bulls, by the 
tongue or tail of infected animals, or by the external genital 
organs coming in contact with the wall, fence, rubbing post, 
litter, or floor which has been previously soiled by an infected 
animal. 
Cows should be kept in fair flesh and in vigorous condition. 
The method of preventing contagious abortion differs from non- 
contagious only in the separation of the infected animals and in 
free use of disinfectants. When a cow shows signs of aborting, 
or when she has aborted, she should be separated from the other 
cows and the stable or stall she occupied thoroughly disinfected. 
For this purpose, use a 5 per cent solution of carbolic acid or a
-P-A-G-E-362
334 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
1 to 1000 solution of corrosive sublimate. All litter and the dead 
fetus should be burned. After the cow has aborted, she must 
be kept thoroughly clean by use of a disinfectant. Dissolve 1 
dram of corrosive sublimate, 1 ounce each of alcohol and glycer- 
ine, shake this up in a gallon of water, and use as an injection 
into the vagina and wash the parts about the vulva and root of 
the tail. Disinfect the animal each day as long as the discharge 
continues. Do not breed aborting cows for two or three months. 
For two days before breeding, the vagina should be washed out 
with the sublimate-alcohol-glycerine-solution, but on the day 
of breeding warm water only should be used as the corrosive 
sublimate will destroy the semen. The disease seems to run 
out and disappear from the herd after a time. 
The best methods of combating contagious abortion are 
cleanliness, the free use of disinfectants, isolation of infected 
cows, and precautions against using infected bulls. Many pre- 
ventive remedies have been suggested, of which the following is 
as good as any: Mix one pound of pulverized hyposulfite of 
soda, one pound of sulfur, and ten pounds of common salt. 
Give a small handful to each pregnant cow two or three times 
a week. 
Difficult parturition. — There are a number of causes of diffi- 
cult parturition among cattle. Cows, however, have an ad- 
vantage over mares, in that the fetus and fetal membranes are 
more strongly attached and not so likely to be disconnected and 
may, therefore, be left alone longer with practically no danger 
to the young. Among cows the maxim may be: Do not inter- 
fere too soon. Bruising, tearing of the passages, and bleeding 
from the uncontracted womb may follow the too rapid extrac- 
tion of the calf. If there is no obstruction, let the calf be ex- 
pelled slowly by the unaided efforts of the cow. 
If, however, after the cow has labored some time, there 
seems to be some mechanical obstruction, she should be ex- 
amined. As this is likely to be much of a task, the operator 
   
-P-A-G-E-363
  DISEASES OF CATTLE 335 
should prepare himself for it by dressing in a shirt from which the 
sleeves have been cut off at the shoulder. This avoids danger 
of soiling the clothing or of exposure, as is the case when the 
shirt is removed, and yet leaves the whole arm free for the work. 
The hand and arm should be smeared with oil, lard, or vaseline. 
This grease should be fresh, neither salted nor rancid, and 
should be purified by boiling or rendered antiseptic by the 
addition of a tablespoonful of carbolic acid to the pound of 
grease. This should always be done, as it protects both the cow 
and the operator from infection. 
After the labor pains have lasted some time without any signs 
of the fetus, the hand should be introduced to examine; if the 
water-bags have burst and neither feet nor head appear for some 
time, if one fore foot only and the head appears, or both fore 
feet without the head, or the head without the fore feet, and 
if one hind foot appears without the other, make very careful 
examination. In normal presentation the fore feet, hoofs down, 
should first appear, then the nose. In any of these abnormal 
presentations, secure the presented limb or head by a rope with 
arunning noose, so that in case it should slip back into the 
womb it will not get lost during the examination, but may be 
retained in the vagina or easily brought up again. This 
examination can be made much easier if one turns the cow 
with head down hill, as the internal organs gravitate forward 
into the belly of the cow thus making more room in which to 
bring up the missing limb or head and to manipulate the 
fetus. In case the cow is lying down, turn her on the side 
opposite to that on which the limb is missing, so that there 
may be more room to arrange the fetus or to bring up the 
missing member. 
Do not attempt to arrange the fetus, limb, or head, during 
the labor pains, but wait until the pain has ceased and then 
straighten out the part before the next pain comes on. One 
must be patient and painstaking, remembering that the fetus 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  336 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
will not come until properly arranged, and when so arranged, 
it is likely to come fairly easy. The task is all the more difficult 
because it is very trying on the arm of the operator, as the arm 
of the strongest man is likely to become numb working in such 
positions. If the passages have lost their natural lubricating 
liquid and become dry, smear the interior of the passages, the 
womb, and the surface of the calf as far as can be reached with 
fresh lard or sweet oil. In pulling on the fetus, draw only 
while the cow is straining. When pulling, draw downward 
toward the hocks as well as backward, as the natural curvature 
of both fetus and passages are thus followed and the extraction 
of the fetus rendered easy. If the pains of the cow are violent 
and long continued, they may be checked by pinching the back 
or by placing a tight surcingle around the body in front of the 
udder. If the pains continue, one to one-and-one-half ounces of 
chloral hydrate in a quart of water may be given to check them. 
Retained afterbirth. — The cow of all farm animals is especially 
subject to this difficulty. When the afterbirth is retained it 
decomposes and is discharged as a yellow or reddish fluid, 
having an extremely offensive odor. This discharge is most 
apparent when the cow is lying down and while she ruminates. 
The rear parts of the cow, rump, tail, and vulva are soiled by the 
discharge, which often contains lumps of decomposing material. 
To avoid this, the afterbirth should be removed within twenty- 
four or thirty-six hours after calving. To do this, a simple 
method which is often effective is to hang a small weight, not 
to exceed one or two pounds, to the hanging portion of the after- 
birth and allow this by its constant dragging and by its jerking 
effect as the cow moves along to pull the membranes from their 
attachments and to stimulate the womb to expulsive contrac- 
tions. In neglected cases when the hanging mass is already 
badly decomposed this cannot be done, as the membrane is 
liable to tear under the added weight, leaving a part of the 
material in the womb. If the bowels are constipated, a physic
-P-A-G-E-365
DISEASES OF CATTLE 837 
consisting of one ounce of ginger given with a quart of sweet oil 
will prove advantageous. If the afterbirth remains, it is neces- 
sary to remove the membrane by hand. This should be done 
within twenty-four hours after calving, since the mouth of the 
womb may be so closed that it becomes difficult to introduce 
the hand. The operator had better dress as suggested for diffi- 
cult parturition (p. 334). The arm should also be greased as 
suggested for that operation, as otherwise the operator may 
become infected from the decaying membrane. It is a good

plan to wind the free portion of the hanging membrane around 
a small stick and roll up until it reaches the vulva. An assistant 
should hold the tail and membrane to one side while the operator 
introduces the greased arm which he passes along until the places 
of attachment are reached. These places of attachment will 
be found to resemble mushroom-shaped bodies and are detached 
one by one by pushing the hand between the membrane and 
the womb and slipping the membrane from the heads of these 
bodies, taking care not to rupture the womb. As the membrane 
is released, the assistant should keep rolling it up on the stick.

    338 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
After the whole membrane is removed, it may be well to disin- 
fect the womb with a two per cent solution of carbolic acid. 
Eversion of the womb. — This ailment is commonly called 
“casting the wethers,” and is rather common among cattle. 
It often follows difficult parturition, the cow continuing to 
strain until the womb is forced out and hangs in a large mass 
from the vulva. The womb can be instantly recognized from 
the other membranes by the presence of the mushroom-shaped 
bodies, each two to three inches in diameter and attached by 
a narrow neck. There are a large number of these bodies, fifty 
to one hundred. 
The displaced womb should be carefully washed with cold 
water containing a one per cent solution of carbolic acid. The 
cold is useful to drive out the blood and reduce the bulk. Now 
with the closed fist planted in the rounded end of the largest 
horn of the womb, push back so as to reinvert the womb into 
place. This must be done gradually. The cow will strain 
while this is being done, but the womb is to be firmly held until 
the straining is over. This straining may be overcome in part 
by pinching on the back. 
The holding of the womb in place is the next point. This is 
perhaps best accomplished by the use of a rope truss. This 
truss can be made from a long one inch rope. Double the long 
rope at its middle and place over the neck of the cow; bring the 
ends, one on either side of the neck, down between the fore legs, 
twist them together to make firm, carry back between the hind 
legs and up to the vulva, here cross them and tie firmly with 
a string, then, just before the tail is reached, cross back and tie 
firmly, thus making a ring which when drawn tight will press 
the vulva; then carry the ropes forward along the back and tie 
into the middle of the rope at the top of the neck. The rope 
should be drawn so tight that the rope ring is made to press 
firmly all around the vulva. 
Milk-fever.— This disease is also known as parturition
-P-A-G-E-367
  
DISEASES OF CATTLE 339 
apoplexy and parturition fever. There is, however, very little if 
any fever connected with the disease, as temperature is usually 
below normal. High-producing, fleshy, aged cows that have 
been closely confined are likely to be attacked. In fact, the best 
and heaviest milkers are most subject to the disease. It is 
more likely to occur when the birth has been comparatively 
easy and quick, and from one to ten days after calving. There 
is a sudden dullness, hanging back in the stall, drooping of the 
head, uneasy movement of the hind limbs, unsteady steps; and 
the cow staggers, lies, or falls down and is unable to rise. At 
this time there may be some temperature. At first the cow lies 
with her head turned around with nose resting on the right 
flank; later she may stretch full on her side. She soon becomes 
unconscious, the eyes are glazed, their pupils widely dilated and 
their lids not movable when the ball of the eye is touched with 
the finger. Treatment must follow quickly or she will soon 
expire. 
While this disease was formerly considered very fatal, with 
the air-treatment it is seldom so. This air-treatment consists 
simply of injecting air into the udder and carefully kneading 
the udder at the same time. Care must be taken that the air 
be sterile. There are Schmidt-Kolding sterile-air milk-fever 
outfits on the market with which to force the air into the udder, 
yet if one of these is not near at hand, a very convenient ap- 
paratus can be made from a common bicycle air-pump and a 
milk-tube. In fact, this simple apparatus will prove as efficient 
as any. Attach the milk-tube to the pump, insert the tube 
into the teat and as the air is pumped in, knead the udder well. 
In two hours milk the air out, rest a few minutes, and pump up 
again. This may be repeated every two hours until the animal 
is relieved. If the animal is badly bloated, puncture the paunch 
in the left loin with a canula and trocar as suggested for bloating 
(page 351). This treatment should be pursued while there is 
life, irrespective of how low the cow may seem. Do not let the 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  
340 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
cow die. In case the milk-tube is not at hand, use a medicine 
dropper to get the air into the udder. If the canula and trocar 
are not at hand, stick a knife into the paunch. This is recom- 
mended only in the absence of something better. Many a cow 
has been saved by these crude methods. 
Garget is perhaps one of the principal forms of mammitis, of 
which caked-udder is a second. The udder often becomes highly 
inflamed soon after the young is born, and occasionally before 
when the glands are active, congested with blood, and the udder 
over-distended with milk. In addition to this, inflammation of 
the udder is often due to mechanical injuries such as blows, 
kicks, scratches, and being horned by other cows; and especially 
by germs entering the udder. 
The treatment is to relieve the congestion by drawing the 
milk frequently. This should be done before calving if the udder 
is distended. After the milk is drawn gently but thoroughly, 
rub the udder. Bathe the parts with hot water for fifteen min- 
utes at a time, rub dry, and apply an ointment made as follows: 
Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of gum camphor in a teacupful 
of melted fresh lard. This can be greatly improved by the 
addition of one ounce of the fluid extract of belladonna. The 
udder should be bathed three times daily and the ointment well 
rubbed in. It is often advantageous to support the udder by 
the use of a wide piece of cloth with holes cut for the teats and 
this held in place by arranging a band over the back. When 
the trouble is due to germs entering the udder, a two per cent 
- solution of carbolic acid should be injected into the udder; leave 
this in ten to fifteen minutes; milk out and bathe as before. 
This solution may be injected by fastening a milk-tube on a 
syringe with a small rubber tube. 
ILLS OF THE YOUNG CALF 
The young calf, even though it establishes the function 
of respiration and gets its first meal without difficulty, is still 
ae 
fpr 
TB
-P-A-G-E-369
DISEASES OF CATTLE 341 
subject to many ills, chief of which are digestive disorders of 
some kind. These digestive defects are likely to be more 
numerous among dairy calves or those that are weaned while 
young and fed from the pail. This is often due to the difficulty 
in keeping the conditions just right: the milk may get cold, the 
pails may be unclean, the calf may drink too fast, and many 
cther irregularities. 
Constipation. — Notwithstanding the purgative effects of 
the colostrum or first milk, the young calf occasionally suffers 
from constipation, especially if the cow has not been in good 
thrift, or has been fed on dry innutritious foods during the 
latter periods of pregnancy. Whatever the cause, if the calf is 
costive, straining violently without passing dung, lying down 
and rising at once as in colic, and failing in appetite, no time 
should be lost in giving relief. First remove the cause, if it can 
be located. The bowels will ordinarily be stimulated to action 
by administering one to two ounces of olive or castor oil. An 
injection of warm water into the bowels will prove helpful. 
The water should be at blood heat and have added to it a little 
glycerine, — a teaspoonful of glycerine and two or three ounces 
of water. It is not advisable to inject too much, or to use soap 
suds as is often done. Inject gently into the rectum with a 
common hard rubber syringe, taking extra care not to rupture 
the tender membrane. This will induce the calf to try to pass 
the fecal matter and in addition will lubricate the passage. 
The injection may be repeated every hour. 
Diarrhea or scours. — This disease is prevalent among calves . 
and occurs in two forms: simple; and contagious or “white 
scour.” The causes of simple diarrhea are many and varied; 
bad food, over-feeding, and too rapid feeding are the most 
common. The surroundings of the calf often bring on the dis- 
ease. -Calves kept indoors are more liable to attacks than those 
in the open air and having exercise, pure air, and sunshine. 
Closely crowded, filthy, foul smelling buildings are likely to
-P-A-G-E-370
  842 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
bring on an attack. Whatever the cause, it should be removed 
and the case treated at once, as the calf is not likely to live long 
if the diarrhea continues. Perhaps the first thing to do is to 
reduce the feed from one-half to two-thirds. In treating, one 
must keep in mind the nature of the disease, that it is caused by 
an irritant in the stomach or bowels which must be removed 
before a cure can be effected. For this reason one should be 
cautious about giving an astringent with a view to cutting off 
the discharge. The best policy in all such diseases is to expel 
the disturber with a laxative, such as one to two ounces of castor 
oil. Later when the irritant has been removed by the oil, check 
the discharge by a weak solution of gum arabic, or by adding a 
little lime water, not to exceed one-third to the milk each meal, 
or by adding parched flour to boiled milk, or by the essence of 
Jamaica ginger well diluted with hot water, and in persistent 
cases by the use of such astringent as oak bark tea, which is 
made by stripping the inner bark of white oak. 
White scour is a violent and deadly form of diarrhea, frequently 
attacking young calves. This may appear immediately after 
birth and is likely to show itself within the first or second day. 
It often occurs as a contagious disease, attacking all the calves 
that are dropped in the stable for some time. For this reason 
it is often called ‘“ contagious scours.’’ The disease is caused 
by a germ that enters in most cases through the navel. The 
calf appears dull and weak, the eyes are sunken, the belly 
retracted, the breathing is short and rapid, the temperature 
very low, and the calf soon becomes unconscious. The dis- 
charge from the bowels is rather profuse, of a yellowish white 
color and very offensive odor. As a rule the calf dies within 
twenty-four to thirty-six hours. 
As there seems to be no treatment, we must rely on pre- 
vention. A week before calving the pregnant cow should be 
placed in comfortable quarters where no sick calves have been 
confined. This seems to be the only safe course, for after tha

DISEASES OF CATTLE 348 
disease breaks out in a stable, often the most thorough disinfect- 
ing fails to stop future calves from infection. As soon as the 
calf is dropped, the cord should be tied close to the navel and 
the parts thoroughly wet with a twenty per cent solution of 
carbolic acid, or better still, with a solution of the tincture of 
iodine. Fresh milk, diluted with lime water, not to exceed one- 
third, in which a teaspoonful of dried blood has been dissolved, 
should be given the calf in small quantities and at frequent in- 
tervals. The stable in which the first attack occurred should be 
thoroughly disinfected, and to do this perhaps nothing is better 
than corrosive sublimate; however, if this seems undesirable 
and ordinarily disinfectants are used, they should be used strong 
and flushed into every nook and corner of the stable. 
TUBERCULOSIS 
Perhaps no disease to which cattle are subject is more dis- 
cussed than tuberculosis. This is due in a large measure to the 
use of cattle to provide food for the human race. There are 
perhaps few diseases so common among cattle as tuberculosis, 
particularly among those animals that are kept closely confined. 
Tuberculosis is a communicable germ disease, and is, therefore, 
preventable. The disease is caused by a small germ or bac- 
terium known as Bacillus tuberculosis. This germ is, of course, 
invisible to the naked eye. 
Methods of infection. — As tuberculosis is a communicable 
germ disease, the methods of infection should receive much at- 
tention. This can be made clear by considering from two points 
of view: first, how the small germs escape from diseased ani- 
mals; and second, how sound animals become infected. All 
diseased animals possess the germ. This germ escapes when 
the tissues it has destroyed are being discharged from the 
body. Thus, if the lungs are affected, the animal on coughing 
dislodges the germs, which may be forced directly out of the body 
or lodged in the mouth, when they leave the body with the saliva. 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  344 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
In the cases in which the germs are found in the saliva they are 
left in the watering troughs, on the bottom of the mangers, on 
the grass, on other animals when licked by diseased ones, and 
in fact spread wherever the diseased animal goes. If the dis- 
ease happens to be in the glands of the intestinal walls, the germ

The Devon cattle originated in the counties of Devon and Somerset, England. 
They are variously classified, sometimes as beef cattle, at other times as dual- 
purpose animals. They tend more toward beef than milk. The animals are 
symmetrical and trim. In size the bulls weigh from 1500 to 2000 pounds, the 
cows from 1300 to 1500 pounds. The color is red, although the shade is 
often light. 
escapes with the dung. If the glands of the udder are diseased, 
the germ passes out with the milk. If the disease is located 
in the glands of the skin, the germs may escape through the 
openings of the skin. 
When the germs have escaped into the watering troughs, 
mangers, on the grass, and the like, they are readily taken up by
-P-A-G-E-373
DISEASES OF CATTLE 845 
healthy cattle. In case the germs escape in the milk, whatever 
feeds upon it is liable to infection. The length of time that 
will pass after infection and before the disease visibly appears 
varies widely, even to months or years. The length of time 
the animal may possess the disease varies equally as much. 
With some it may prove fatal in a few months; others may 
carry it for years. 
The tuberculin test. — Often it is not possible to tell by a phys- 
ical examination which animals are infected with tuberculosis 
and which are not. The most accurate means of detecting the 
disease in cattle is by noting the temperature of the animal 
following the injection of a small amount of tuberculin be- 
neath the skin. The tuberculin is prepared by sterilizing, 
filtering, and concentrating the liquids in which the tubercle 
bacillus has been allowed to grow. It contains the cooked 
products of the growth of these germs, but not the germs them- 
selves. Hence when this liquid is injected under the skin of 
cattle, it is absolutely unable to produce the disease, but it sets 
up a characteristic reaction or symptoms. 
Any intelligent owner of cattle, who will make a little effort 
to familiarize himself with the test and its limitations, can use 
it on his own cattle with safe results. It does not require 
the trained veterinarian. The operator must, however, be 
familiar with the method, be very careful, painstaking, and 
patient. 
The testing outfit. — The testing outfit consists of five things: 
(1) tuberculin, (2) syringe, (3) thermometer, (4) disinfectant, 
(5) vaseline. 
1. Tuberculin.— Tuberculin can be procured from the ex- 
periment stations in the various states. If the Experiment 
Station fails to provide it, the Bureau of Animal Industry, Wash- 
ington, D.C., can tell where to secure it. 
2. Syringe. — A hypodermic syringe of 6 c¢.c. to 10 c.c. 
capacity, such as is commonly used to inject liquid vaccine, is  
-P-A-G-E-374
  346 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
necessary. This syringe should be provided with short, stout 
needles, well reénforced at the base. 
Any druggist will procure the syringe and needles and show 
how to use them. 
3. Thermometer.—A guaranteed clinical thermometer is 
necessary. If a large number of animals is to be tested, it will 
facilitate matters to provide two or three thermometers. Any 
druggist will provide a thermometer and show how to adjust 
or shake down and how to read it. A string should be tied 
around the thermometer, at the other end of which should be 
fastened a wire hook, or a small bull-dog clamp. After inserting 
the thermometer in the rectum, the clamp or wire hook is fastened 
to the long hairs at the base of the tail, or the wire wound around 
the tail so that if the thermometer is thrown out, it will not be 
broken by dropping to the ground. Cows are likely to void dung 
soon after the insertion of the thermometer, and unless this 
precaution is taken, the thermometer is very likely to drop to the 
floor before many temperatures are taken. 
4. Disinfectant.— A small bottle of strong carbolic acid 
(95 per cent), to be used in disinfecting the syringe before begin- 
ning the test and to disinfect the needle-point before injecting 
each animal, is essential. This can be procured at any drug 
store. 
5. Vaseline. — A small can of vaseline or lard should be pro- 
vided to grease the thermometer before insertion. A vaseline 
jar also affords a safe and convenient place to keep the ther- 
mometer between times of taking temperature. 
Directions for making the tuberculin test. — While making the 
test is not difficult (in fact easier done that told), one should 
be exceedingly careful, going about the work methodically 
and keeping everything neat and clean. The test may be 
divided for convenience into five essential parts: (1) keep- 
ing records, (2) taking the normal temperature, one day, 
(3) injecting the tuberculin same day, (4) taking temperature
-P-A-G-E-375
DISEASES OF CATTLE 847 
after injection, second day, (5) interpretation of the tempera- 
ture records. 
It is very essential that the animals be well known or num- 
bered, for in no case should they get mixed. It is not advisable 
for the beginner to attempt to test more than twenty animals 
at one time. 
Cattle suffering from such diseases as garget, retained 
afterbirth, and the like, or those that are in heat or far along in 
pregnancy, should not be tested. 
1. Keeping records. — An accurate record of each tempera- 
ture must be kept. To do this procure a large sheet of paper, 
writing the names or number of each animal down the left side, 
and the hour at which the temperature is taken across the top. 
As each temperature is taken, record it under the hour and op- 
posite the name. 
2. Taking the normal temperature. —On account of the 
variation in temperature it is essential to take the temperature 
of each animal at intervals of two hours until at least four 
temperatures are taken, before the tuberculin is injected. These 
temperatures must be carefully recorded to compare with the 
temperatures of the same cow after injection. After becoming 
familiar with the method of reading the thermometer, shake it 
down, smear it with vaseline and insert full length into the rec- 
tum. Attach the thermometer to the base of the tail by means 
of the clamp of wire, and allow to remain in the rectum for three 
minutes. Withdraw the thermometer, read the temperature, 
record on the sheet at once, shake the thermometer down, and 
proceed as before. 
Because of the ease with which variations in temperature 
are caused, it is important to keep the animals that are being 
tested under normal conditions. They should be fed, watered, 
and milked as usual. 
3. Injecting the tuberculin. — This is preferably done in the 
evening, say eight hours before the time of milking in the morn-
-P-A-G-E-376
  848 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
ing. For example, if the cows are milked at 6 a.M., inject the 
tuberculin at 10 p.m. The syringe should be disinfected by 
drawing it full of carbolic acid, emptying it, and then rinsing in 
boiling water before beginning the injection. In addition to 
this, just before injecting each animal, dip the needle in strong 
carbolic acid to disinfect it. Carefully fill the syringe through 
the needle from the bottle of tuberculin. Set the burr on the pis- 
ton-rod of the syringe so that not more than the dose intended 
can be injected. The druggist will show how this is done when 
the syringe is purchased. The size of the dose will be stated on 
the tuberculin bottle. With the cow restrained in a stanchion, 
or tied short in a stall, take hold of the skin with the left hand 
along the side of the neck where it is thin and loose and with the 
syringe in the right hand quickly insert the point in the 
pocket thus formed and inject the dose. Occasionally some 
force is needed to insert the needle into the skin. Before in- 
jecting another cow, see that the syringe is working properly 
and the needle is in good shape. 
4. Taking temperature after injection. — Begin taking tem- 
peratures eight hours after the injection of the tuberculin and 
continue every two hours until six temperatures are taken, and 
continue those cases showing a rise in temperature. For ex- 
ample, if the tuberculin was injected at 10 p.m., begin taking 
temperatures at 6 a.M., then at 8 am, 10 am, 12 Mm, 
2 pm., and 4 p.m., and make a careful record of each 
temperature as taken. When an animal shows a rise above 103, 
it is well to take the temperatures at more frequent intervals. 
5. Interpretation of the temperature records. — The tem- 
peratures after injecting the tuberculin must be carefully studied 
and compared with those taken the day before. In typical 
cases of tuberculosis, an elevation of temperature usually comes 
on gradually, although in the more pronounced reactions, when 
the temperature goes above 105.5 degrees, the rise is often rapid. 
This elevation usually occurs between the eighth and sixteenth
-P-A-G-E-377
DISEASES OF CATTLE 849 
hours after injection. It should remain practically at a maxi- 
mum for two hours or more and gradually subside. When it 
reaches 104 degrees or more and is maintained for some hours, 
the animal is regarded as tubercular, if no fever was shown 
before the injection. Sudden rises for a short time only do not 
indicate a reaction. The rises of less than 1.5 degrees do not 
indicate a reaction. In all cases of doubt, the animal should be 
separated from the herd and retested not sooner than four to six 
weeks (the test will not give reaction under this time). 
Retesting. — A single test of a diseased herd cannot be relied 
upon to detect every tuberculous animal. If animals are found 
by the first test to be affected, they should be tested again in four 
to six weeks. Even in those herds in which no reacting animals 
are found, it is a good plan to test once each year. 
Tuberculin not infallible. — While tuberculin is the best 
method known for detecting tuberculosis, it is not infallible. On 
the average if properly handled, it will detect 97 per cent of the 
cases. In some cases, especially when the animals are.badly 
diseased, it fails to react, and in a very few cases it seems to cause 
a rise of temperature in healthy animals. 
Prevention of tuberculosis. —In the beginning of this discussion 
it was stated that tuberculosis is a communicable germ dis- 
ease, and therefore preventable. In order to prevent, infected 
animals must not be brought into healthy herds, for as we have 
observed diseased animals spread the infection wherever they go. 
Much space has been given to methods of locating the disease in 
order that those herds already free may not be infected by the 
addition of an infected animal. If a herd is known to be healthy, 
never bring a new animal into the herd until it has been tested, 
and if there is the slightest doubt about its being tubercular, it 
should be excluded. 
If in addition to the tuberculin test and the exclusion of all 
diseased animals, the quarters where the cattle are kept are well 
ventilated, and well lighted, admitting the direct rays of the sun,
-P-A-G-E-378
  
  350 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
the chance of the herd’s being infected is very slight. Since the 
trouble and expense of making the test are so slight, it is well 
worth while to make it in order to have the assurance that the 
herd is entirely free and there is absolutely no danger in the con- 
sumption of their products, either milk or meat. 
Eradication of tuberculosis. — The eradication of tuberculosis, 
once it gets a foothold, is not so easy or at least not so inexpen- 
sive. There is of course no curefor the disease, so other methods 
of eradication must be sought. It has been suggested that all 
diseased animals be slaughtered, but this would mean untold 
waste and were it enforced, might lead to a national calamity, 
for it is doubtful if the nation could spare all of its tubercular 
cattle at one time. There is one plan, however, which, if it could 
be employed, would seem to bridge the difficulty and in a few 
generations would result in bovine tuberculosis being practically 
swept from the land. This plan, however, requires extra 
labor, as well as the expense of extra equipment, and its em- 
ployment is purely economical; but since, from the nature of 
the disease and the importance of the animals concerned, it 
seems to be the only avenue of hope, the plan is here given. 
The Bang method of eradicating bovine tuberculosis. — This 
method, recommended by Dr. Bang of the Copenhagen Veteri- 
nary College, is being successfully employed in Denmark. The 
object of the method is to replenish a tuberculous herd with as 
little loss as possible. The original method has been modified 
from time to time and at present stands thus: Immediately 
after testing the herd divide it into two parts, placing the sound 
animals in one and the diseased animals in the other, thus mak- 
ing two herds, one diseased, the other sound. At once remove 
the sound herd to new and uninfected quarters, and keep it 
away from the infection. The difficulty of this is that it means 
two sets of equipment, barn, lots, pastures, and the like; for if the 
plan is to succeed, the sound herd must be kept entirely away 
from the infected barn, lots, and pastures. They must even have
-P-A-G-E-379
  
DISEASES OF CATTLE 351 
different care takers. Since calves at birth are free from tubercu- 
losis, those from the diseased herd may be put with those from 
the sound herd. No animals should be admitted to the sound 
herd without first being tested and the sound herd itself should 
be tested once each year, and if any animals react, they are to be 
put with the diseased herd and the stable thoroughly disin- 
fected with corrosive sublimate. 
If dairy cattle, the milk from the tuberculous herd must be 
handled in entirely separate utensils and pasteurized at 185° F., 
after which it is considered harmless both for stock and human 
food. 
This method, though it involves much expense, seems to be 
the only feasible one for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. 
It is being successfully conducted on several farms in this coun- 
try at the present time. The painstaking and careful cattle 
owner can eradicate tuberculosis from his herd in a very few 
years by the Bang method, or some modification, if he so desires. 
BLOATING IN CATTLE 
Bloating, or “hoven,” is the distention of the paunch or 
rumen with gas. It is liable to occur when cattle are first 
turned to young clover or alfalfa, especially if the growth is 
rank, as they eat it so greedily that gas formation results. 
Turnips, potatoes, and cabbage may likewise set up fermenta- 
tion, which proceeds rapidly; the gas does not escape, and 
soon the rumen becomes distended to a large size. Bloating 
is easily recognized by the distension of the rumen, particu- 
larly on the left side, that part bulging outward and upward 
very noticeably, and when struck with the tips of the fingers, 
giving a drum-like sound. Breathing is very difficult, the animal 
reels, and soon may lie down or fall. 
The treatment varies according to the severity of the case. In 
mild attacks, driving the animal at a walk often gives relief, or 
dashing cold water by the bucketful against the sides may suffice.
-P-A-G-E-380
  852 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
If the animal is bad, it may be necessary to put a gag in the 
mouth as follows: Take a piece of inch rope, smear it with pine 
tar, wagon grease, or other unsavory substance, place it in the 
animal’s mouth as a bit, and fasten by tying around the horns; 
or, take a stick the size of a fork handle and eight or ten inches 
long, place this in the mouth as a bit and secure with a string by 
tying around the head. It will try to dislodge these objects by 
movements of the tongue, jaws, and throat, thus stimulating the 
secretion of saliva and swallowing, which opens the esophagus 
and permits the gas to escape. At this time a little salt thrown

into the mouth often proves advantageous. In severe cases, how- 
ever, the gas must be allowed to escape without delay, and this is 
best accomplished by the use of a trocar and canula. On the left 
side, about halfway between the last rib and the hip, make an in- 
cision through the skin about three-quarters of an inch long with 
asharp knife; through this incision insert the trocar and canula, 
directing downward, inward, and slightly forward, and thrust 
the point into the paunch. If this happens to be a fat animal, 
it will be some distance through, but thrust it home. Remove 
the trocar, leaving the canula in place, through which the gas
-P-A-G-E-381
Se ee rr me 
DISEASES OF CATTLE 353 
may escape. This should be left in place as long as the gas is 
generating. In the absence of a trocar, a sharp knife may be 
thrust through to let the gas escape. Do not let the animal die 
of bloating. Give internally two ounces of aromatic spirits of 
ammonia in a quart of cold water. Repeat every half hour. 
Turpentine in two-ounce doses is also good, but it must be well 
diluted with milk to prevent injuring the animal. After bloat- 
ing has subsided give physic; one pound of Glauber’s salt is 
good. 
Since there is danger of bloating in turning cattle to luxuriant 
pasture, especially if wet with dew, they should always be well 
fed and turned to pasture in the afternoon when the grass is dry. 
Some advise taking them up the first night, feeding them well 
the next morning, and not turning in pasture again till after- 
noon. A little dry hay put in the pasture is excellent to prevent 
bloating, as the cattle seem to crave it. 
IMPACTION OF THE RUMEN 
This difficulty often occurs among cattle and is due to the fill- 
ing of the third stomach with indigestible material, such as frozen 
grass, weeds, or foreign materials. The animal refuses to eat, 
stands with back slightly arched, breathes rapidly, and may 
bloat, though not always. Often the mass of undigested food 
can be felt on the left side. The animal on lying down usually 
lies on the right side. 
For treatment give a mild purgative, three-fourths to one 
pound of Epsom salts and two ounces of ginger dissolved in 
warm water, and administer in the form of a drench. Feed gruels 
and bran mashes if the animal will eat, and allow plenty of 
water. To aid the bowels in moving one may give an injection 
of warm water. 
Cattle off feed.— Often cattle are thrown “off their feed” by 
overfeeding, by irregular feeding, or by consuming indigestible 
things such as frozen grass, weeds, and perhaps by eating foreign 
2a 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  854 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
matter, particularly if it be salty. Such animals are simply in- 
disposed, do not eat, and stand around with a dejected look. If 
no attention is given them, they may remain in this condition 
for some time. This is to be avoided if possible, as animals that 
are not doing well are sure to prove unprofitable. The treat- 
ment is to give pound doses of Epsom salts dissolved in warm 
water to which a little ginger has been added. If they will eat, 
give gruels or mashes, and allow all the fresh water they will 
drink. 
DEHORNING 
In case the horns were not removed when the calf was small, as 
suggested on page 255, and it is desired to remove them later, it 
will be necessary to remove them with either a saw or a pair of 
dehorning clippers. The animal must be confined in a chute or 
stocks made for such purposes, a rope placed around the head, 
which should be pulled to one side and held firmly while the horn 
is removed. Whether sawed or clipped, remove the horn so close 
to the head as to take a ring of hair off at the base of the horn, 
otherwise the horn will grow out asastub. If in fly time, apply 
tar to keep the flies away. The bleeding will stop of its own 
accord. The pain of the operation is slight, and whenever 
animals are disposed to be vicious the horns should be removed. 
It is not a good plan to dehorn when the flies are bad, nor should 
dehorned animals have access to straw or hay stacks where they 
can get the chaff into the wounds. 
VICES OF DAIRY CATTLE 
There are a few bad habits or vices to which dairy cattle are 
subject. They are often serious and lessen the usefulness of the 
animal. Most of them, however, can be remedied with a little 
patient effort, or by the arrangement of inexpensive apparatus. 
Kicking cow. — To prevent a cow from kicking, procure a 
half-inch rope long enough to reach around the cow’s body and
-P-A-G-E-383
DISEASES OF CATTLE 855 
tie; place the rope, with slip noose on one end, around the body 
of the cow, just in front of the udder and back of the hip bones. 
Draw tight and tie. Repeat each milking, always treating the 
cow gently. After a time one need only lay the rope over the 
cow’s back. Finally the rope may be discarded. 
Another method recommended by some is to take a hame strap 
and buckle the two hind legs together, but this is not efficient as 
she is likely to get one leg loose or throw herself endeavoring to 
do so. 
When the cow is tied by the stanchion, the experienced milker 
will be able to milk almost any cow by crowding her over as far 
as the stanchion will let her go, then by placing his knee in front 
of her hock and his head in her flank she is not likely to try to 
kick ; in fact she cannot, if the milker understands holding her 
in the proper position. 
Sucking cow. — Occasionally a cow develops the habit of 
either sucking herself or another cow. While there are many 
ways of preventing this, perhaps as efficient way as any is to 
procure a stiff piece of old leather, say one and one-half inches 
wide and eight inches long, drive through this several eight- 
penny wire nails with the ends filed down to a point and fasten 
to the nose-band of a common halter and place this halter on the 
sucking cow. With this she cannot reach her own teats or those 
of any other cow without injuring the flanks, and she not likely 
to try more than once.

CHAPTER XVI 
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SHEEP 
Famiuiariry with what is wanted, powers of observation, and 
good judgment are equally as important in choosing sheep as in 
choosing cows or horses. These can be gained only by careful 
study, and more especially by practice, as sheep are often de- 
ceptive. The importance of these faculties cannot be overesti- 
mated in the choice of any class of farm animals. 
The wool-covering of the body of the sheep makes an examina- 
tion of the form rather difficult. The wool is often so trimmed 
as to deceive. An expert trimmer, possessing much skill with 
the shears, can give a rather inferior sheep the appearance of a 
plump full form; thus animals with sway backs, narrow, flat 
ribs, narrow, peaked rumps are often so trimmed as to conceal 
such defects. To facilitate the inspection and hasten the work, 
to avoid being deceived and to enable the examiner to discover 
all defects, the following method of examining sheep is 
suggested : — 
After noting the general appearance, the age, the teeth, 
the eyes, and the like, then, with the open hand, as shown 
in the illustrations (page 369), proceed to a detailed examina- 
tion. Do not depend on the eye alone, but fortify it with the 
touch, carefully noting each character as described under detail 
examination (page 368). During this examination keep the 
fingers and thumb together and the hand flat. Never stick the 
fingers into the wool. When it is desired to examine the wool, 
open up the wool with the hand flat (Fig. 121),

Catching and holding sheep. — There are two places to catch 
sheep: First, the hind leg above the gambel joint; second, by 
  Fig. 104.—Drzaine Merino Ram “Beacon.” <A prize winner, owned by 
C. Marshall, New London, Ohio. 
   The Delaine Merino sheep are of American Merino ancestry, bred mainly by 
selecting from varieties free from folds. This breed resembles the American 
Merino except lacking the heavy fold, and the fleece is not so heavy. There are 
several families of Delaines, such as National, Standard, Dickinson, and Black 
Top. Rams shear from 12 to 20 pounds, the ewes from 8 to 15 pounds of 
strong, fine wool. In weight the rams vary from 130 to 200 pounds, the ewes 
from 100 to 140 pounds. This breed is popular in the United States. 
  placing the hand underneath the jaw and around the neck. Do 
not catch a sheep by its wool, as this not only pulls and injures 
the wool, but leaves a black mark or bruise on the body which
-P-A-G-E-389
  
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SHEEP 861 
interferes very much with the sale of the carcass of mutton. If 
the shepherd’s crook is used in catching the sheep, the aim 
should be to catch above the gambrel joint, as there is danger of 
injuring the leg if caught below this joint. 
To hold a sheep, stand on the left side and place the left hand 
under the animal’s jaw, keeping the right hand free to place 
behind the sheep in case it attempts to move backward. Do 
not attempt to keep the sheep from moving backward by pull- 
ing on the head or the wool, as either of these methods will 
be quickly resisted, which will result in injury to the wool and 
carcass. Gently place the right arm around back of the thighs, 
and the sheep will stop the backward movement at once. Like- 
wise do not attempt to keep the animal from going forward by 
pulling on the wool, but place the left hand gently under 
the jaw. 
HOW TO ESTIMATE AGE OF SHEEP 
The age of sheep is a very important factor in determining 
their present and prospective value. Familiarity with the 
characters that indicate age are, therefore, often extremely use- 
ful. As in the case of the horse a knowledge of these characters 
is not difficult to secure, and skill in their application depends 
much on continued practice. 
In estimating the age of sheep the order of the appearance 
of the permanent teeth furnishes the best index, especially from 
one to four years of age. There are, however, other general 
considerations that aid in estimating the age, especially in the 
case of young and very old animals. Size is the principal factor 
in determining the age up to one year. In very old animals 
the poll becomes more prominent, the sides, of the face more 
depressed, and the hollows above the eyes deeper. With 
age the backbone becomes more prominent and often strongly 
curved downward, the sheep loses its plumpness, and in many 
ways shows the effects of age.

Examination of the teeth. — While the order of the appear- 
ance of the permanent teeth and their subsequent method of 
wearing are considered the most accurate means of estimating 
age among sheep, they are not absolutely accurate nor are 
they as dependable as in the horse. Teeth in sheep vary much 
according to the conditions, as in the case of the horse (see 
page 8). 
Sheep, like cattle, are provided with two sets of teeth; first, 
the temporary or milk teeth, and, later, the permanent teeth. 
The permanent teeth differ from the temporary in their greater 
size. The replacement of the 
temporary teeth by the perma- 
nent is made necessary by the 
increase in size of the jawbone 
as the animal becomes older. 
As in the case of cattle, sheep 
have incisor teeth in the lower 
jaw only, the upper being pro- 
vided with a cartilaginous pad. 
The number likewise is the 
same, eight in either case,

narrow and peg-like in appear- 
ance. When the animal is approximately fifteen months of age, 
the middle pair of milk teeth is replaced by permanent ones, 
which are fully twice as broad as the milk teeth, hence easily 
recognized (Fig. 105). The interval between the appearance 
of the succeeding pairs varies according to conditions, but can 
be-stated as approximately eleven months. In general the age 
of the animal at the time each pair is up and in full wear 
may be estimated as follows: —

Second or first intermediate pair of permanent renin . . 26months 
Third or second intermediate pair of permanent teeth . 37 months 
Fourth or lateral pair of permanent teeth. . . . . . 48months 
After the teeth are up and in wear, there is comparatively 
little change for a time, but as the animal grows older the teeth 
become narrower, and by-the eighth or ninth year there is 
much space between them. They shrink away from each 
other, become more or less discolored, and finally drop out one 
by one. 
TYPES OF SHEEP 
There are two distinct types of sheep: the wool type, 
adapted for the production of much wool, and the mutton 
type, adapted for the production of meat. These types are 
controlled to a considerable extent by the demands made upon 
the body of the animal. Thus in the case of wool production 
as much skin surface as possible is desired, and the skin is 
thrown into folds. Large wool yields depend much on the con- 
stitution, the vigor, and the condition of the skin; hence much 
consideration is given these characters in choosing wool sheep. 
Likewise much attention is paid the skin secretions, which should 
be oily in appearance This oil is commonly called “ yolk.” 
The wool should be fine, with a natural bright luster and a 
clean white color. On the other hand, the mutton type calls 
for a form similar to that of beef cattle. The carcass is the 
product, and a plump full body is desired. The energy of the 
food should go to the production of mutton and not of wool. 
These two types, therefore, are of necessity widely different, 
and one can no more expect maximum wool production and 
maximum mutton production in the same sheep than he can 
have greatest milk flow and greatest yield of beef in the same 
cow. 
The fine-wool type. — There are three important breeds of
-P-A-G-E-392
364 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
fine-wool sheep, the American Merino, the Delaine Merino, 
and the Rambouillet. The fine-wool, or Merino and Ram- 
bouillet type, may be compared to that of the dairy cow. The 
body is spare, lacking in fullness, in breadth of back, and in 
general thickness throughout. The wool is rather short, very 
thick over the entire body, and exceedingly fine. 
  Fic. 106.—Cuampion Merino Ram. A type. Photograph from National 
Stockman and Farmer. 
Owing to the difference in type, as shown by the folds or wrinkles on the neck 
and over the body, fine-wooled sheep are divided into three classes. Class A, 
Merino, represents the class or type with very heavy folds; Class B, Merino, 
has a smoother body ; Class C, Merino, has a smooth body with only a few or 
no folds at all about the neck and breast. 
There are three classes of fine-wool sheep, grouped according 
to the folds or wrinkles on the neck and body. By common 
consent these forms are distinguished by letter as follows: 
Class A. — Merino, representing those with heavy folds at the 
neck and over the body and hind-quarters, and possessing an

representing those with fewer and smaller folds on neck and 
body and carrying less yolk in 
the wool (Fig. 107). Class C. — 
Merino, representing those with 
comparatively smooth bodies, 
possessing less yolk than Class 
B, though the wool is, as a rule, 
somewhat longer (Fig. 108). Of 
the three classes A is perhaps 
  the heaviest shearer, a case being Fic. 107.—Cuamrion Murino

divided into two general groups, known as the medium-wool 
and the long-wool; each, however, in the main possesses the 
characteristic mutton — type.

CHOOSING SHEEP 
In choosing sheep, whether 
for the production of mutton or 
fine wool, they should be care- 
fully examined. It is essential 
that the examination be syste- 
matic. Perhaps the most con- 
venient and simplest method is 
to note, first, the general ap- 
pearance, the form, weight, con- 
dition, quality, and constitution, and if these are satisfactory, 
to make a more detailed examination.
-P-A-G-E-394
  
  366 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
General appearance 
By carefully observing the general appearance of a sheep, 
one can gain a fair knowledge of its desirability. Very often 
the general appearance is not given much consideration, with 
the result that many important characters go unobserved. 
Before proceeding to a detailed examination one should ‘care- 
fully note the form; this applies with equal force when selecting 
for mutton or wool; if for mutton, the weight and condition 
are important and the quality as well as the constitution are 
of vital importance to both types and should receive much 
careful attention. 
The form will vary according to the object sought. In the 
fine-wool sheep the form may differ materially from that desired 
for mutton. Class A, fine-wool, should have very heavy folds 
over the entire body. Great depth of body is often more 
sought than width, and the animals are often quite angular in 
appearance. The form sought is that which indicates great 
vitality and gives much surface for the production of wool. 
Fine-wool sheep are therefore often high-standing; deep of 
chest, though narrow; long of body, though well supported ; 
light in the hind-quarters with skin fold varying according to 
the class. 
On the other hand, the form of the mutton sheep should be 
comparable to that of the beef animal. They should be low 
and condensed in organization. The top and bottom lines 
should be parallel, the shoulders and chest almost as wide as the 
hips and rump. The body should be short and thick, as long 
bodies lacking in depth and fullness are objectionable to the 
sheep feeder and to the butcher. The region of. valuable cuts 
of mutton are the same as those of beef, that is, along the 
back, loin, rump, and thigh; hence these regions should be ex- 
ceedingly strong and well developed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SHEEP 367 
Condition and weight. — Since the weight depends much on 
the condition of the sheep, they will be considered together. 
As weight is a breed characteristic, no definite figures can be 
suggested, but the animals chosen should be fairly large for the 
particular breed to which they belong. Among wool sheep the 
condition should be such as to indicate thrift and health; exces- 
sive fleshiness is not essential. In general, the condition must 
be determined by the touch, as the wool often deceives the eye. 
Among mutton sheep a fair amount of flesh is desirable, even 
in the breeding stock, as the tendency to fatten quickly is a 
very important consideration in this type. 
Quality. — Sheep possessing much quality are desired for 
both mutton and wool production. With sheep, as with other 
farm animals, quality is determined by the bone, skin, and hair. 
The bone should be dense, clean, and of fine texture. The skin 
should be soft, pink in color, and comparatively thin. Care 
must be exercised in respect to the thinness of the skin, as a 
thin paper skin is often associated with weakness of constitu- 
tion. The hair on the ears, face, and legs should be soft and 
silky. These are important features in sheep intended for 
wool or for mutton, for breeding or for feeding. Sheep possess- 
ing a tight, heavy, pale skin, coarse, harsh hair about the face 
and on the legs, and heavy rough, coarse bone are deficient in 
quality. 
The constitutional vigor deserves much attention, for in its 
absence the wool will be of poor quality and the mutton sheep 
an unprofitable animal. Vigor is estimated by the general 
expression, by the condition of the skin, and by the chest ca- 
pacity. The expression of the eyes, ears, and head should be 
mild and lively, and the sheep should be on the alert. The skin 
should be deep pink and not pale. The chest capacity should 
be large. A good way to estimate the chest capacity among 
sheep is to note the distance between the front legs along the 
floor of the chest. If the distance between the legs is small, it
-P-A-G-E-396
  868 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
denotes a narrow chest. A narrow chest is always objection- 
able, as it may indicate lack of constitutional vigor. 
Uniformity. — The importance of uniformity in a flock of 
sheep chosen either for wool or mutton cannot be overestimated. 
They should be uniform in type, size, and breeding. While ~ 
such uniformity may not add to the production of wool or to the 
ability to take on flesh, it materially improves their general 
appearance and increases their market value. Either the 
butcher or the sheep breeder will pay more for a uniform flock 
than for one in which such regularity is wanting: 
Detail characters of sheep 
A detailed examination of the characters of sheep is of 
greater importance than that of any other class of farm ani- 
mals. This is due to the wool covering many defects. In 
order that none of the characters be overlooked, they should 
be considered in order. 
The head should be short, with strong jaws and large nostrils. 
The mouth should be examined to note the age and whether any 
teeth are missing. Sheep with missing teeth are undesirable at 
any price, either for mutton or wool. ‘The eyes should be mild, 
bright, and prominent; the forehead broad and full. The ears 
should be refined, short, and active. Coarse, leathery ears are 
objectionable, as they indicate poor quality. The horns, if pres- 
ent, should be strong, rather angular at the base, and have a 
spiral shape turning backward and around, sometimes making 
two complete turns (Fig. 110). 
Neck. — With the flat hand note the length and fullness of 
the neck. Among mutton sheep the neck should be full, short, 
and neatly attached to the head and shoulders. In fine-wool 
sheep it may possess some length, deep folds, and lack the full- 
ness, though it should be neatly attached at both head and 
shoulders (Fig. 111). 
Shoulders. — Among mutton sheep the shoulder should be

  370 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
full, neat, and closely rounded along the sides and over the top. 
Sharp, angular shoulders are very objectionable. They should 
be smoothly curved with flesh (Fig. 112). " 
Chest. — With the flat hand note the capacity of the chest 
as follows: kneeling on the left side of the animal, place the 
left hand on the floor of the chest, between and just back of 
the fore legs, at the same time placing the right hand on the 
back just to the rear of the shoulder-tops. In this position one 
ean note lack of depth as well as the narrowness of the chest 
at both top and bottom. Next note the heart girth and width 
of chest by placing one hand on either side at the same time. 
The importance of a wide, deep chest, indicating great vitality, 
cannot be overestimated. In no other way except by the 
touch can these dimensions be determined, as the wool covers 
the parts so completely (Fig. 115). 
Body. — With the hands in the same position, one either side 
of the animal, note the width of the body. Next place the 
flat hand on the back at the shoulder-tops and note the width 
and straightness of the back from the shoulder-tops to the tail- 
head, by pressing down gently as the hand is drawn to the rear. 
In so doing one must observe that the sheep does not move his 
back as the hand is passing over and make the back appear 
swayed when in reality it is not. Since the back, loin, and 
rump contain the valuable cuts, a close examination of this 
region is important, and, as in the chest, this can be noted only 
by the touch (Figs. 114 and 117). 
The rump should be long, wide, and level. This can be ascer- 
tained only by the touch. The fleshiness should be carried 
well down to the hock, and the twist should be plump and full 
(Figs. 118 and 119). 
The leg of mutton, which includes the rump also, is the most 
valuable cut of mutton; therefore, the thigh should be heavily 
meated. This can be determined only by the touch, and to do 
this one places the left hand around the leg at the flank and 
the right around the rear at the thigh (Fig. 120).

872 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
The legs should be carefully observed. Sheeps’ legs are at 
best far from straight. As a rule, the fore legs of fine-wool 
sheep are too close together, the knees often almost touching. 
This is objectionable, for, as we have already observed, fore legs 
placed close together indicate a narrow chest, which in turn 
signifies lack of constitutional vigor. Fine-wool sheep also 
have very crooked hocks, which is equally as objectionable. 
Often the legs below the hocks are carried too much under the 
body, the shanks being too slanting. The toes are often neg- 
fected and let grow out too long, which throws the legs still 
farther out of their proper position. 
Examining the fleece 
In the examination of the wool the chief factors to consider 
are the quantity, the quality, and the condition. In consider- 
ing the quantity the entire body must be examined. To note 
the quantity along the belly 
and arm pits, the sheep 
should be turned up and 
placed on itsrump. To turn 
the sheep, stand on the left 
side of the animal, place the 
left arm around under the 
neck at the shoulder points, 
with the right hand reach 
under the sheep, seize the 
right hind foot, gently lift the 
animal off his feet, and place 
him on his rump, belly up. 
One should have a mat or gunny sack on which to place the 
sheep to prevent soiling the wool of the rump, particularly if 
in the show ring. With the sheep in this position, the wool 
along the belly and arm pits can be carefully noted. These 
places should be densely covered, though such is seldom the 
  Fig. 121.— ixamininc THE FLEECE 
FOR THE FINEST OF THE WOOL. 
   
-P-A-G-E-401
  
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SHEEP 873 
case among many of the mutton breeds. In considering the 
quality, the best method is to open the fleece along the side 
just back of the shoulder and 
in the region of the thigh. 
With the hands placed in a 
flat position, open the wool just 
back of the shoulder (Fig. 121). 
It is in this region that the 
finest and soundest wool of the 
fleece is found. With the 
hands in like position, open 
the wool along the thigh (Fig. 
122). In this region the poor- Fic. 122;—Exammine THe Frauce 
est and coarsest wool of the FoR THE CoarsEst or THE Woot. 
entire fleece is to be found. 
Quantity of fleece. —'The chief factors to be considered in 
determining the quantity of fleece are the density and length, 
and the evenness of both over all parts of the sheep’s body. 
By density is meant the closeness of the fibers or the number 
of fibers that grow on a square inch. As a rule the greater the 
number, the finer the fibers will be; hence the fleece will not 
only be heavier, but more valuable as well. A dense fleece is 
desired, as it affords the animal more protection than one that 
is loose and open; hence sheep with dense fleeces suffer less 
from catarrhal and other disease:. A dense, oily fleece is im- 
pervious to rain, snow, and wind, as well as dirt, dust, and 
pieces of hay. On the other hand, the loose open fleece becomes 
saturated with water on exposure, the sheep catch cold, suffer 
from catarrh, running at the nose, scouring, and various other 
diseases, and the fleece becomes loaded with dust, dirt, and 
chaff. 
The length of the fleece is one of the important features in . 
considering the quantity. The length is a breed characteristic, 
and the only suggestion that can be made is that it should be 
   
-P-A-G-E-402
  374 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
long tor the particular breed concerned. The length will vary 
from approximately two inches in the case of the fine-wool to 
twenty and even more inches for a single year’s growth in the 
case of some of the long-wool breeds. 
Quality of fleece. — The chief factors to be considered in de- 
termining the quality of the fleece are the softness, crimp, and 
the soundness. Quality and quantity are not associated; that 
is to say, as a general rule the shorter-wool breeds of sheep 
possess the finest quality of wool. As stated, the finest quality 
of wool is located over the heart region and the poorest quality 
on the thigh. 
The softness is estimated by pressing the fleece with the closed 
hand. The amount of oil or yolk influences the softness to a 
considerable extent; also the management, the kind of food, and 
the nature of the soil. Providing the sheep suitable quarters, 
feeding foods rich in fat, and pasturing them on clay soils, all 
have a tendency to increase the softness of the fleece. Chalky 
soils, on the other hand, are noted for emphasizing harshness of 
the fleece. Harshness is due in a large measure to the absence 
of yolk, which results from exposure, lack of proper food, ill 
health, and the like. 
Crimp refers to the folds or spirals of the fiber. The crimp 
should be fine, close, and regular from one end of the fiber to 
the other, as this indicates wool of finest quality. If the crimp 
is irregular, short and close in places, long and wavy in others, 
the fiber is probably unsound. In all coarse wool, the crimp is 
open and wavy. 
Soundness indicates that the fiber should be strong from end 
to end, as it usually will be if the crimp is fine, close, and 
regular. To furnish an additional guide in locating unsound- 
ness, remove a small lock of the wool and stretch evenly and 
gently until the strength becomes apparent. If the fibers each 
break in approximately the same place, it indicates an un- 
sound place in the wool. When such break occurs near the
-P-A-G-E-403
  
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SHEEP 3875 
bottom, it is spoken of as “weak bottoms”; when near the 
middle, ‘“‘weak middles,”’ and when near the top, ‘“‘ weak tops.” 
If the fibers are resistant, each breaking in a different place, and 
the crimp fine, close, and even, the fiber is sound. 
Condition of the fleece. —'The chief factors to be considered 
in determining the condition of the fleece are its purity, luster, 
brightness, and the oil or yolk. The condition of the fleece is 
influenced by breeding, feeding, and management, some breeds 
possessing much brighter wool than others, some foods produc- 
  Fic. 123.— American Mertno Ewes. Owned by W. M. Staley, Marysville,

The American Merino developed from the Spanish Merino, although they have 
been much improved in America. This breed is noted particularly for the 
strong, fine, and heavy fleece. Ewes shear from 10 to 15 pounds, while rams 
easily attain 20 pounds of fine wool. In weight the ewes reach 100 pounds 
and up, while the rams weigh 130 pounds and up, often attaining 200 pounds. 
This breed is very popular in the United States. 
ing more yolk than others; and providing suitable quarters 
and giving proper care keeps the wool much more clean than 
otherwise. 
Purity refers to the freedom of the fleece from foreign ma- 
terial. In the absence of proper management, where sheep are 
long exposed to conditions opposed to thrift, the wool has a 
tendency to revert to its original form. Hairs and dead fibers, 
often called ‘‘kemp,’’ make their appearance. The fleece 
that is loose and open often accumulates much chaff, pieces of 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  
  376 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
hay, and the like. This foreign material is very injurious to 
the fleece, as it is difficult to remove, does not absorb dyes, 
and interferes in the manufacture of cloth. 
Luster refers to the glistening appearance of the fiber. On 
being held in the light the fiber appears as if it were varnished. 
Luster is independent of oil, as fibers possessing a small amount 
of oil or yolk may be very lustrous, while other fibers possessing 
much oil may be rather dull. The significance of this luster is 
that wool possessing it more readily takes delicate dyes. 
Brightness refers to the color of the fibers. Wool is spoken of 
as bright or dark, the former signifying a clear white color, the 
latter signifying the darker colors. 
Yolk refers to the oil or grease that is found in the wool. 
This oil is readily recognized by running the hand over the 
wool. The various breeds differ widely in the amount of oil 
secreted and the amount is influenced by the food. Yolk is 
desirable as the fleece is much softer, more compact, as well as 
brighter and cleaner, and in addition it indicates thrift in the 
sheep. Excessive quantities of yolk are of no advantage, and 
may be a source of direct loss, especially in the manufacturing 
of woolens. 
Summary.—In the examination of wool, therefore, one must 
consider first the quantity, second the quality, and third the 
condition. Under quantity note the covering over the entire 
body, including the belly and arm pits, also the density and 
length which should be even over the entire body; under 
quality note the softness, crimp, and soundness; and under 
condition note the purity, luster, brightness, and yolk.

CHAPTER XVII 
FEEDING SHEEP 
SHEEP are among the most difficult of farm animals to feed. 
Thorough familiarity with their habits is essential to success. 
No other farm animal is less understood by the masses of 
American farmers. A knowledge of their peculiar characteris- 
tics can be gained only by a careful study and much experience 
in handling the animals. Sheep are naturally very timid in 
their disposition, very dainty feeders, and are easily frightened 
out of their appetite. A sudden noise or disturbance of any 
kind, as the bark of a dog, will often greatly frighten them and 
sometimes create a stampede or panic in the entire flock. 
Sheep have a natural aversion for strange dogs, and one coming 
near the flock will cause the sheep to run, which excites the 
dog to the chase, not necessarily because he is a vicious dog 
but because of his nature to give chase to whatever flees from 
him. In thé excitement of the chase, the dog may tear the 
skins of the sheep with the teeth, sometimes inflicting fatal 
wounds. Sheep thus chased may die of exhaustion, and the 
entire flock will shrink badly in weight. In most cases if the 
sheep would stand their ground, the dog would not give chase. 
As goats do not ordinarily run from dogs, one or two placed in 
the flock often prevents the sheep from becoming frightened. 
The difficulty is to get the goats to stay with the flock. It 
may be necessary to raise the goats with the flock to teach 
them to remain with it at all times. It is very apparent that 
if sheep are to be profitable, they must be kept free from all 
3877
-P-A-G-E-406
  
378 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
such excitement, and all unnecessary noise must be avoided 
To avoid startling the sheep, herdsmen often make it a prac- 
tice to whistle or talk to them as they approach. 
Sheep are the most susceptible of farm animals to the 
ravages of parasites, both internal and external. These para- 
sites in some one or more of their many forms are responsible 
for the larger number of failures in this country. No part of 
our land is free from them all. In certain localities one form 
will be the more destructive, in other localities another form is 
to be dreaded: For example, in the corn-belt the stomach 
worm (Strongylus contortus) is by far the most serious, while 
in the far West, scab is the more troublesome. As arule little 
attention is given these parasites; the flock becomes infested, 
many of the sheep become ill and die, and the others fail to 
thrive, and sometimes the owner does not know what causes the 
trouble. 
Sheep possess a very dainty appetite. The food must be at- 
tractive when placed before them or they are likely to refuse it. 
Any food left in the feed boxes must be removed as soon as the 
sheep are through feeding. If such food is left, it undergoes 
slight change, becoming sour, and when the fresh food is placed 
in this, the sheep refuse it entirely. Sometimes the trough in 
which the grain is fed is placed beneath the hay-rack in such a 
way as to collect the dust, dirt, and chaff that sifts from the 
hay. This construction, while economical of material and 
space, is objectionable because the grain trough cannot be 
kept clean as it should be, with the result that occasionally 
the sheep refuse the grain. 
While sheep can withstand the cold without suffering much 
inconvenience, they cannot endure the rain or snow that satu- 
rates their wool, nor dark, damp, and poorly ventilated quar- 
ters. Such conditions lead to colds, running at the nose, 
catarrh, inflammation, diarrhea, and all kinds of sheep diseases. 
From this it follows that if sheep are to prove profitable, they
-P-A-G-E-407
FEEDING SHEEP 3878 
must be kept quiet; all unnecessary excitement avoided, prop- 
erly nutritious foods and suitable quarters provided. 
FOOD REQUIREMENTS OF SHEEP 
The quantity of food required by sheep depends on many 
factors, chief of which are the kind of food, and the age, weight, 
condition and individuality of the animal as well as the chief 
product sought, whether wool or mutton. 
Since foods vary widely in the energy they contain as well as 
in their influence upon wool or mutton production, and since 
young animals, for an equal weight, require more food, and of a 
different kind than older animals, it is not possible to state exact 
amounts. The Wolff-Lehman standards, however, will serve as 
a guide to be modified to suit the foods, animal, and conditions. 
These standards (p. 380) were arranged to meet the need of 
the average farm sheep under normal conditions, and as general 
guides to be varied in practice as circumstances suggest. 
Sudden changes in the food of sheep are to be avoided for the 
reason that the alimentary system, in many cases, is unable to 
accommodate itself at once, and digestive disorders follow. 
Such changes sometimes result in bloating, as when sheep are 
transferred from a dry to a watery diet, from the dry-lot feed- 
ing of winter to the early spring pasture where the grass is 
very succulent. Some pasture grasses are very likely to pro- 
“duce bloating, particularly alfalfa and clover. In regions of 
considerable rainfall and much dew, alfalfa is serious in this 
respect. 
Fresh cool water should be available at all times. In winter, 
when it is exceedingly cold, sheep are not likely to drink very 
much, but if one is to succeed with them, they must have free 
access to water. Sheep are peculiar in their habit of drinking as 
well as eating, and if watered at intervals, do not do so well as 
when the water is available at all times. 
Salt in limited quantities should be kept before the sheep

FEEDING THE FLOCK 
The feeding of the flock deserves special attention. The 
flock is often sadly neglected; it is pastured along lanes and 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
  FEEDING SHEEP 381 
highways, in woodland and marshland, or in hilly land in 
summer; given the protection of the woodland or straw stack; 
and fed at intervals during the winter; and as a result of such 
treatment the sheep become affected with parasites, both exter- 
nal and internal, many may die; all are unthrifty, and the owner 
becomes discouraged, selling the animals for little or nothing.

The Rambouillet breed of fine-wool sheep developed in France, although tracing 
to Spanish origin. This breed is similar to the Delaine, but possessing more 
size, the rams weighing from 150 to 225 pounds, the ewes 125 to 175 pounds. 
The fleece is the lightest of the fine-wool sheep, the rams shearing from 10 
to 20 pounds and the ewes from 8 to 12 pounds. 
The flock in summer 
Unlike stock cattle, the flock must receive careful attention 
in summer as well as in winter, particularly in those regions 
infested with stomach worms,— the sheep’s greatest enemy.
-P-A-G-E-410
  382 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
These worms have done more to discourage the propagation of 
sheep than all other causes combined, especially on the fertile 
farm lands in the central states. These pests seldom trouble 
sheep in cool regions, or in cold weather. Lambs are espe- 
cially susceptible to attack, the older suffering much less and 
being more easily managed in summer. Because of the cool 
weather, the New England states, northern New York, 
Ontario, upper Michigan, and northern Minnesota and Wiscon- 
sin are comparatively free from these pests. Only occasionally 
do stomach worms trouble sheep west of the corn-belt, and 
there they may be avoided by clearing up the watering places. 
Much of the cheap farm land throughout this section could be 
put to the profitable production of sheep. 
Pasture for sheep. — Pastures for sheep need similar care to 
those suggested for cattle. The stand of grass, the drainage of 
the soil, and keeping down the weeds deserve much attention. 
It is even more important that they be kept free from weeds, 
particularly burrs of various kinds, as they are especially inju- 
rious to the wool (page 286). 
Sheep thrive on pasture as nowhere else. They are particu- 
larly adapted to grazing short forage, and prefer it, as it is tender 
and juicy. In fact, sheep often keep parts of the pasture grazed 
so closely as to injure the plants, while the grass in other parts 
of the same field is left to grow up and seed. This can be pre- 
_ vented in part by mowing the entire pasture twice each year. 
The sheep will then pasture on the tender second growth. 
Turning to pasture. — Care should be exercised in turning 
sheep to pasture, otherwise some of the flock may be troubled 
with bloat. The extent of the trouble depends much on the 
condition as well as the kind of grass, young succulent grass 
being more troublesome than older and riper grass, and alfalfa 
or clover more thab blue-grass or orchard-grass. In regions of 
much dew, alfalfa is likely to be the most troublesome of all. 
After alfalfa becomes woody there is not so much danger from
-P-A-G-E-411
FEEDING SHEEP 383 
bloating. Mixed grasses are also less dangerous. There are 
many methods suggested for turning sheep to pasture. The 
following is as good as any; when the grass is very succulent, 
make the change from dry forage to pasture gradually ; that is, 
after feeding the sheep, turn to pasture say two hours during the 
middle of the first day, taking the sheep off the pasture before the 
dew falls. The second day leave them on a little longer, and by 
the fourth or fifth day they may remain in the pasture over night. 
When the sheep are familiarized with the pasture in this way, 
they must be carefully noted the next morning to see that none 
is suffering from bloat. 
Tagging the sheep. — When sheep are first turned to pasture, 
the succulent grass often induces a more or less lax condition of 
the bowels. The soft dung soils the wool below the tail-head, 
causing the parts to become foul, and may produce troublesome 
and vicious sores unless given attention. Such troubles are not 
likely to occur when the sheep have been shorn previous to turn- 
ing to pasture. If, however, it is desired to turn to pasture 
before shearing, the wool should be carefully clipped away be- 
neath the tail-head and along the inside of the thighs behind. 
Change in pasture. — When convenient, an occasional change 
of sheep from one pasture to another will prove advantageous. 
On farms heavily stocked with sheep there are two reasons for 
this: first, the change gives a chance for the fresh grass to 
grow, thereby preventing the sheep from cropping parts of the 
pasture too closely; and, second, it lessens the danger from par- 
asitic germs by allowing the larve to die before finding lodg- 
ment in the sheep’s body. More satisfactory results would be 
obtained by dividing large pastures into several small ones, and 
pasturing them in turn from the time warm weather sets in until 
the cool weather of the fall. While this system would no doubt 
largely enable the sheep to escape parasite infection, it involves 
extra equipment in the way of fencing, shade, water supply, and 
the like, and there may be other means of accomplishing the
-P-A-G-E-412
  384 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
desired end without the extra expense, such as by the use of 
sown pastures. 
Providing shade. — Sheep on pasture should be given pro- 
tection from the sun. They are fond of shade and will seek it, 
  Fig. 125.—Sournpown Ewe. First prize ewe, International Live Stock Show,

The native home of the Southdown breed of mutton sheep is in England. This 
breed is noted for its rapid maturing qualities, and its delicious mutton. In 
outward appearance the animals are perfect. In weight the rams average 
about 175 pounds, and the ewes 135 pounds. As a wool breed it occupies a 
subordinate place, the fleece not weighing much over 4 to 8 pounds. 
even though all they can find is that provided by the shade of a 
wire fence-post. They will spend much of the time in the shade 
during the heat of the day. Unlike cattle, the shade tree is not 
sufficient for sheep, artificial shade being much preferred. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-413
    FEEDING SHEEP 385 
great objection to the shade tree as a resting place for sheep 
is the danger of parasite infection. (There is also danger from 
lightning.) There is an accumulation of droppings, which 
either bear or afford a convenient brooding place for such 
harmful parasitic germs as ‘“‘grub in the head,” throat worms, 
stomach worms, nodular disease, and the like. The droppings 
encourage the growth of sweet rich grass near the tree. The 
germs are harbored about the base of this sweet grass. 
When the pasture is near the shed.or barn, no better shade 
can be provided than to give the sheep the freedom of these 
quarters, which should then be slightly darkened by hanging 
blankets or gunny sacks over the windows. A blanket may be 
so hung over the door that the sheep in passing into the shed will 
brush the flies off their backs. The shed or barn should be kept 
well bedded, as this preserves the manure which otherwise would 
be largely wasted. Hay kept in the racks will prove advanta- 
geous, as the sheep will eat much of it and be benefited thereby. 
If small sheds are provided in the field, they should be placed 
on runners in order to move them from place to place as the 
sheep are changed from one field to another. This plan scat- 
ters the manure more thoroughly and does away with much of 
the evil caused by parasites. These shades need be only a 
roof and may be made of pine boards, as it is not essential 
that they be rain-proof. They need not be high. Such a 
roof sixteen feet square will provide shade for a flock of forty 
sheep. 
The use of sown pastures. —- The best way to care for the flock 
in summer, in order to avoid parasite infection, particularly with 
a flock of lambs, is to sow special pasture crops for the flock. In 
this way the owner may have various green forage crops coming 
on regularly at different times, and thus avoid having the 
sheep graze on the same area for any considerable time. It 
avoids practically all danger from the many parasites that at- 
tack sheep during the summer season. There are many plants 
2c
-P-A-G-E-414
  3886 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
that may be used as green feeds for summer pasture, chief of 
which are rye, oats, alfalfa, clover, rape, kale, cabbage, turnips, 
and pumpkins. 
While it is less trouble to provide permanent pastures and 
grow the common farm crops for the sheep, and while sheep may 
be maintained upon them alone, it is nevertheless essential to 
highest and healthiest development. Such food aids in escap- 
ing the ravishes of the parasites. Rape, kale, cabbage, and 
turnips add to the healthfulness and soundness as well as the 
quality of the wool, and pumpkin seeds are among the best 
vermifuges known. The owner who is to attain greatest success 
with sheep will find it necessary to grow such supplementary 
foods. They need not necessarily occupy extra land, as both 
rape and pumpkins may be grown in the corn field and the 
corn not be injured thereby ; or they may be grown similarly 
to soiling crops for dairy cattle (page 220). There will be extra 
labor connected with harvesting and feeding, but the ad- 
vantage will pay many times over. It is these little things 
that make sheep farming profitable. 
The flock in winter 
In winter the flock is entirely dependent on the care of the 
owner, and it must receive more careful attention than during 
thesummer. This is the season of catarrhs, running at the nose, 
inflammation, diarrhea, and the like. When convenient, the 
change from the fields to the yards should be made gradually. 
The flock should be yarded at night as soon as the pastures be- 
come crisp from night frosts, as frosty forage is likely to lead to 
digestive disorders. Hay should be provided in the lot, so that 
the sheep will not go to pasture hungry in the forenoon. If on 
permanent pasture or where there is much old grass, such yard- 
ing is not so necessary, as the sheep will feed on the dead grass in 
preference to the frosty succulent grass. 
The winter ration. — The feeds that should enter into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-415
FEEDING SHEEP 387 
winter ration will depend on the kind available. If convenient, 
succulence of some kind should be provided. On farms where 
there are silos, nothing is better than corn silage. In the absence 
of silage, roots will serve, some sheep owners even preferring 
roots to silage. The roots suggested for late fall use, such as 
mangels and ruta-bagas, will serve admirably. When such suc- 
culence is available at the time of changing from pasture to dry- 
lot, the sheep will suffer no loss whatever. In the absence of 
silage or roots, a little wheat bran, oats, linseed meal, or similar 
grain should be fed, particularly to the ewes that are to lamb in 
the spring. The advisability of feeding grain when succulence 
is available will depend on the kind of dry forage being fed and

on the use to which the lambs are to be put. If winter lambs 
are desired, grain should be fed. On the other hand, if ewes are 
not to lamb until time of going to grass, and the dry forage con- 
sists of clover, alfalfa, or mixed hay, then the grain may be dis- 
pensed with at least until the sheep show signs of falling off in 
flesh. It may be of advantage to begin grain feeding four to 
six weeks before lambing time. 
Exercise. — In order to keep the sheep healthy and thrifty 
they should take exercise daily. This often becomes a serious 
problem in the cold climates when the ground is covered with 
deep snow much of the winter season. It may be advisable ta 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  
  388 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
remove the snow from parts of the lot and feed them some dry 
forage in some spot not too near the winter quarters. 
Care of the feet. — During the winter season when the sheep 
are rather closely confined, it is important to watch the feet and 
see that the toes do not grow out too long, as they very often do 
at this season of the year. Long toes should be trimmed. The 
aim in trimming should be to keep the feet natural, so that the 
sheep stands squarely upon them. Lack of trimming is some- 
times responsible for diseases of the feet. The toes may be 
trimmed with a sharp knife, a chisel and block, or better still a 
sharp hand pruning knife; take care not to cut them too short, 
for if the quick is cut, the feet will get very sore and prove very 
annoying. If the hind parts become foul tag as suggested on 
page 383. 
Bedding should be used liberally, otherwise the floors will be- 
come damp and foul smelling. Sheep lying on damp, filthy beds 
are subject to the same ills as those exposed to draughts. Fresh 
bedding is of greatest importance during the lambing season, 
as damp, filthy quarters are particularly hurtful to lambs and will 
soon prove fatal to them. At this time, fresh bedding should 
be put down daily. This not only increases the healthfulness 
of the sheep-fold, but increases the quantity of valuable ma- 
nure as well. 
FATTENING SHEEP 
Feeding sheep to fatten them differs considerably from feeding 
the flock in general or feeding for the production of wool; it 
is somewhat similar to feeding cattle for the production of beef. 
Growing winter lambs 
In recent years a considerable demand has developed for 
winter lambs, particularly in the eastern cities. Because of the 
forced methods of feeding adopted in pushing the lambs forward 
so as quickly to prepare them for market, they are spoken of as
-P-A-G-E-417
FEEDING SHEEP 889 
“hot-house”’ lambs, a term which has misled many as to the con- 
ditions under which the animals are raised. The high price that 
these lambs command on the market has led many to think 
the demand only a fad that will soon pass. While the de- 
mand could no doubt be oversupplied, it has managed to take 
care of the supply and bids fair to continue to do so for some time 
to come, particularly all that can be supplied from Christmas to 
Easter. Many sheep owners have not attempted to raise winter 
lambs because they did not know where to find a market, not 
realizing that such lambs are a regular product upon the 
provision market and can be sold through any commission 
merchant. Some persons have not gone into the business be- 
cause they think it difficult to prepare the lambs for market; 
but this is an easy task, as any one can prepare a carcass who 
is willing to exercise a little care. 
Foundation stock. — There are two characteristics that the 
foundation flock must possess for the production of winter lambs: 
the ewes must drop the lambs in the fall and early winter, and 
this is perhaps the greatest difficulty in winter lamb production; 
and the ewes must be good milkers in order to nourish the 
lambs well, as they should weigh fifty to sixty pounds at ten to 
twelve weeks of age. All things considered, it is thought best 
that the sheep composing the foundation flock, for the produc- 
tion of winter lambs, be grades rather than pure-bred animals. 
The mutton breeds would, of course, produce the best lambs, 
but they will not breed at the proper season. The Merino 
bears lambs fairly early, but the lambs grow too much wool 
before they have size or are fat enough for the market. 
The best plan is to choose a grade Merino flock. Put it on 
good pasture and mate the ewes with a good, vigorous pure-bred 
Horned-Dorset ram. The lambs of this mating will probably be 
dropped in January, February, and March. This crop will come 
too late for winter lambs. The ewe lambs should be saved for 
breeding and the others may be fattened for spring lambs. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
  
890 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
grade flock should be shorn rather early, in March or before if the 
quarters can be well protected for a few days. In May turn the 
sheep to pasture and in addition feed considerable stimulating 
grain, such as ground oats, or bran, and, at the same time, mate 
to a thrifty, vigorous pure-bred Horned-Dorset ram by turning 
the ram to the flock each morning, as suggested on page 407,

The Shropshire Down breed of mutton sheep originated in the county of Shrop- 
shire, England. This breed is similar to the Southdown, but somewhat larger, 
the standard weight for mature rams being 225 pounds, with 150 for the ewes. 
It, also, is noted for its early maturing qualities and delicious mutton. 
As wool-producers this breed excels the Southdowns, bearing from 5 to 10 | 
pounds of medium-length wool. This breed is extremely popular in the United 
States. 
rather than letting him run with them all the time, and at the 
same time marking the ewes served for identification. This 
system of mating should result in the lambs being dropped in 
October, November, and December. It is not considered a
-P-A-G-E-419
  
FEEDING SHEEP 391 
good plan to have the lambs dropped before the ewes go into 
winter quarters, as the lambs then entirely escape danger from 
stomach worms and as a rule can be taught to eat grain much 
younger. 
After purchasing the grade Merino flock, some persons prefer 
to give the ewes a year’s rest, shearing them in March and begin- 
ning the breeding in May. This has the advantage that the 
ewes are not nursed down in flesh as a result of raising a crop of 
lambs. Whatever system is used, the ewes must have weaned 
their lambs sometime previous to going to pasture, they must 
have been shorn for some time, and they must be gaining in 
flesh while mating. With such a flock thus treated, there 
should be no difficulty in having the lambs dropped in the 
late fall and early winter months. 
The winter quarters for winter-lamb production. — In the discus- 
sion on care and management will be found a statement of the 
method and equipment for housing sheep (page 483). The term 
“hot-house” lambs has led many to think that extra warm 
quarters must be provided, some thinking that artificial heat 
must be used, others that the roof or side of the sheep barn 
should be of glass construction resembling a green-house. Not 
only is such extra equipment unnecessary, but if the quarters 
are too warm, neither the ewes or lambs will thrive. On the 
other hand, winter lambs cannot be grown if the ewes are ex- 
posed to the rain, snow, or storm. The winter quarters must 
be well lighted, well ventilated, and free from draughts. There 
should be sufficient window space to make the quarters light 
and comfortable. Artificial heat is entirely unnecessary. 
Feeding the lambs. — The ewes should be fed milk-producing 
foods, such as wheat bran, silage, and clover hay, in order that 
the milk flow be large, but in addition to the dam’s milk the lambs 
should be taught to eat grain as soon as they will take to it. 
Some lambs will begin to nibble grain when only ten days or two 
weeks old, and they should be encouraged to do so. A lamb
-P-A-G-E-420
    
892 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
creep should be provided. This “‘ creep” consists of a little pen 
with openings so small that the lambs may pass in and out at 
will, but through which the sheep cannot pass. These openings 
may be made of vertical slats placed seven inches apart, and the 
edges of the slats rounded. These must be conveniently placed 
for the lambs or they will fail to find them, as the young lamb is 
largely a victim of circumstances. The grain boxes within the 
creep should be flat-bottomed and placed rather low. The first 
feed put into the trough may be wheat bran, to which has been 
added a little brown sugar. At first it may be necessary to aid the 
lambs by placing some of this mixture on their lips. The troughs 
  Fic. 128.—Cuampion SHropsHirE Ewxs. An almost perfect flock. Owned 
by Dr. G. H. Davison, Millbrook, N. Y. 
must be cleaned daily and the food kept fresh. After the lambs 
have learned to eat grain, the following mixtures should be used : 
50 parts of cracked corn, 50 parts of wheat bran, and 10 parts of 
oil meal, coarse ground. This may be varied by adding oats, 
barley, or gluten feed as circumstances demand. A fresh sup- 
ply should be provided each day. Lambs thus cared for should 
grow rapidly and fatten at the same time, so that by the time 
they are ten to twelve weeks of age they will weigh from 50 to 60 
pounds, when they should be slaughtered. The most desirable 
weights vary somewhat on the different markets, and the owner
-P-A-G-E-421
  
FEEDING SHEEP 893 
should find out what weights are mostly in demand. The weight 
demanded will range from 45 to 65 pounds, — not more, as they 
will not sell for hot-house lambs if larger. The lambs must in 
all cases be fat, as it will not pay to ship a thin carcass to a 
winter-lamb market. 
Dressing winter lambs. — Dressing winter lambs requires 
some skill, — not more, however, than dressing a squirrel, — and 
any one can develop the required skill after carefully reading the 
directions and practicing on a few lambs. The methods vary 
somewhat, but the following is as simple and efficient as any: 
Suspend the lamb by 
fastening a rope around 
the hind legs so that 
the head comes within 
a foot of the floor. 
With a sharp-pointed 
knife sever the artery 
and vein in the neck 
close above the head. 
It is very important 
to have the lamb thor- 
oughly bled out. 
Bright red blood gives 
this assurance. It is 
  well to hold the head, Fig, 129.—Dressine Hot-nousr Lams, sHow- 
otherwise the lamb will = 1a Merrnops or removine THE Hipp FROM

operator and may soil the wool. As soon as the lamb ceases to 
struggle, remove the head. This can be easily done if severed 
at a vertebra. Place the carcass on a table. Remove the 
front feet and cannons at the knee. Loosen two or three 
inches of hide along the front of the cannons to cover the joints. 
Remove the hind feet at the pastern joints. Slit the skin from — 
the tail to the brisket. Loosen and remove the skin along the

floor of the abdomen and for 
about four inches up the inside 
of the hind-quarters (Fig. 129). 
Suspend the carcass by the 
hind legs. Open the lamb 
and carefully remove the caul 
fat, —a sheet of fat surround- 
ing the intestines. Save the 
caul fat to cover the openings, 
and if the weather is cold, put 
in warm water. Remove the 
intestines, stomach, and esoph- 
agus, and in warm weather 
the liver, heart, and lungs, 
though these may be left in 
when the weather is cold. Pro- 
cure two spreaders or back-sets 
twelve or fourteen inches long, 
depending on the size of the. 
lamb. These back-sets should 
have shoulders about one inch 
up from the pointed end to 
prevent them from entering 
the flesh too far. Insert one 
in the outer and upper part 
of the hind flank, then cross 
the back diagonally, entering 
the opposite side nearly or 
quite as far forward as the 
chest. The second crosses the 
first at right angles across the 
back. Carefully spread the 
eaul fat over all exposed flesh, holding in place by means of 
tooth picks (Fig. 130). Make small slits in it over the kidneys
-P-A-G-E-423
FEEDING SHEEP 
and pull them _ through. 
Hang the carcass in a cool 
place for twelve to twenty- 
four hours. As soon as the 
animal heat is given off wrap 
in two separate wrappers. 
The first may be of cheese- 
cloth or muslin, which should 
be drawn tight to prevent 
soiling when handling. The 
outer covering may be of bur- 
lap or sacking and must be 
well secured. The lamb is 
now ready for consignment to 
a provision commission mer- 
chant (Fig. 131). When the 
lambs are to be shipped a long 
distance, they are often crated, 
placing three carcasses in a 
crate. In warm weather ice 
may be put between the 
lambs but never in them. 
The lambs should be dressed, 
as they are ready for market, 
preferably sending a few each 
week during the season which 
runs from Christmas to 
Easter. 
After the lamb is removed, 
the udder of the ewe must be 
watched closely and not per- 
mitted to spoil. If necessary,

Growing spring lambs 
Because of the difficulty in getting ewes to conceive suffi- 
ciently early for the growing of winter lambs and the disad- 
vantages of dressing and marketing, many sheep owners prefer 
to grow spring lambs. There is much profit in selling lambs 
afoot in May and June. Usually the highest prices are obtained 
in June, as at this time the supply of winter-fed western lambs 
is exhausted and the summer-fed lambs are not yet on the 
market in any considerable number. 
The foundation stock and the management should be much 
the same as that suggested in growing winter lambs. The 
ewes should be mated in August, September, and October, as the 
lambs should be dropped in late January, February, and March, 
not later than March. The lambs should be provided with 
creeps and fed grain in the same manner as advised for winter 
lambs; for if they are to be marketed in a thick fat condition at 
the age of four or five months, they must be forced from the 
beginning. It is rather difficult to fatten lambs for the spring 
market if they once lose their baby fat. Lambs thus cared for 
should be able to make a vigorous start before grass comes and 
be in condition to make the most of it when turned to pasture. 
Lambs dropped in February and thus cared for should make 
a weight of approximately eighty pounds by the middle of June. 
As this is the weight demanded of this class of mutton, it should 
be the aim of the sheep owner to supply it. When there are 
several lambs or when one is located convenient to market, it 
may be advisable to make two drafts, selling the larger and fatter 
ones say the first of June and the remainder of the lamb flock 
the latter part of the month. 
Feeding lambs in the fall 
Lambs may be fattened at almost any season, but ordinarily 
the fattening period extends from September until the follow-  
-P-A-G-E-425
  
FEEDING SHEEP 897 
ing May. Fall feeding is extensively practiced both by the 
farmer who raises his own lambs and by the sheep feeder who 
buys his lambs either locally or from the western range and 
fattens them in seventy to one hundred days. Fall feeding is 
practical on pasture, either permanent or sown, when supple- 
mented by feeding grain. The various pastures that may be 
used for this purpose are the same as those suggested for the 
flock in summer (pages 382 to 386). 
Getting the lambs on full feed. — Much care must be exercised 
in getting a flock of lambs on full feed, particularly if they are 
from the range and not familiar with grain. Furthermore,many 
of the plants used in fall pastures for fattening lambs are likely to 
produce bloating, and for thisreason much care must be exercised 
in turning the flock to pasture, particularly if the grass is com- 
posed of alfalfa, clover, or rape plants. These are most ex- 
cellent crops for fattening lambs in the fall, but due care must 
be exercised in turning on the sheep. The grain should be fed 
sparingly at first and gradually increased from day to day until 
the full amount is being fed. Most satisfactory results can be 
obtained by feeding the grain twice daily. Care must be ex- 
ercised never to feed more than the lambs will consume; or if 
there is any grain remaining, it should be removed before a new 
supply is placed in the troughs. 
Lambs thus cared for should make rapid and economical 
gains. Under such feeding, 60-pound lambs should attain a 
weight of 85 pounds in 75 days and be sufficiently fat 
for the market. Thus, lambs put on feed September 1 
would be ready for the market November 15. As suggested in 
the case of spring lambs, when the flocks are sufficiently large 
and the sheep feeder is located conveniently near to market, it 
will, as a rule, pay to make two drafts, selling the fattest at the 
end of about 75 days and the remainder of the flock in 90 to 
100 days. This keeps the two flocks more even and avoids 
holding those already fat for the slower maturing ones to
-P-A-G-E-426
  398 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
fatten, and avoids selling a few thin in flesh after the majority 
have fattened. 
Fattening lambs in winter 
By far the greater number of lambs are fattened during the 
winter season. The methods employed differ fundamentally 
in different localities. In the West little or no attention is paid 
to shelter, and exercise is considered essential; in the corn-belt 
much attention is given to the shelter, at least to protect the 
lambs from the rain, snow, and storm, and to provide them dry 
footing and exercise; in the East, where lamb-feeding is 
rapidly developing, shelter is considered essential, though 
exercise under the methods employed is likely to prove fatal, 
and the sheep must be kept absolutely quiet or trouble will result. 
Feeding in the semiarid West.— Large flocks of lambs are 
shipped from the ranges to points where alfalfa hay is available. 
Here the sheep are confined in corrals which are divided into 
lots containing approximately 500 head. No shelter is provided 
other than that furnished by the fence or the alfalfa hay which 
is often stacked near by. Rain and snow storms are rather in- 
frequent, and it is felt that the loss occasioned by the lack of 
protection is less expensive than shelter. These corrals provide 
accommodations for many thousands of sheep. To save labor 
in feeding, the lots are arranged in rows with feeding lanes be- 
tween. In these lanes the hay is stacked and fed out each 
morning and evening. Sometimes the fence has a space be- 
tween the first and second boards large enough for the sheep 
to introduce its head, and the rack is arranged on the stack side 
of the fence. In each lot are placed rows of grain troughs 
sufficient to accommodate the entire flock. These lots are pro- 
vided with water, often pumped by windmills, though sometimes 
by hand or with an engine. Salt is kept before the animals at 
all times. In this way five men can care for 10,000 or 12,000 
head of sheep. 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
FEEDING SHEEP 399 
Feeding in the corn-belt.—In the corn-belt the practice is 
entirely different; in the West sheep are fed in larger numbers 
and by few men, while in the corn-belt few sheep are fed by 
great numbers of farmers. Here feed, both grain and hay, is 
very abundant, but the climate is the objectionable element. 
Sheep need dry coats and dry footing. The dripping skies of 
the corn-belt makes this impossible without providing shelter 
from the rain and snow. Hence, before attempting to feed 
lambs ample provision must be made to shelter them. 
Much care should be exercised in getting the lambs on full 
feed. The lambs may be fed hay liberally, but the grain must 
be fed sparingly, beginning with one-fourth pound to the head 
daily and gradually increasing the ration to one pound by 
the time the sheep have been on feed three weeks, and 
continuing until they are getting all they will consume. The 
lambs should not be fed more grain than they will clean up at 
each feeding. As the grain is increased, less hay will be required. 
Lambs thus cared for should make a gain of 25 to 30 pounds 
in 100 days, when they should be fat and ready for the 
market. If desired, two droves of lambs may be fed each 
winter, purchasing the first drove in November and fattening 
by the last of January, immediately purchasing a second and 
fattening by the first of May. This system is extensively 
practiced when feeds are comparatively low and mutton high. 
Feeding in the East. — During the recent high price of mutton 
many lambs have been fed in the eastern part of the United 
States, and the methods are peculiar to the East. 
The feeding pens are usually rectangular in shape, with hay- 
racks and grain-troughs the entire length of either side. These 
grain-troughs are protected with vertical slats so arranged that 
there is just room for one lamb to feed in each opening, and there 
are just as many of these openings as lambs and not one more. 
When the lambs are feeding, they are packed solid along either 
side of the pen. The space allowed each pen is approximately
-P-A-G-E-428
  
400 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
twice the room on which they stand while feeding. Water and 
salt are supplied in this pen, and the lambs do not leave it 
from the time they are put in until they are finished and ready 
for the market. The lambs are put on full feed in about three 
weeks and forced untii fat.

The native home of the Hampshire Down breed of mutton sheep is in Hampshire 
County, England. This breed is noted for its large size and its mutton quali- 
ties. Mature rams should weigh about 240 pounds and the ewes 180 to 200 
pounds. In general appearance this breed is somewhat coarser than either 
the Southdown or the Shropshire, but in quality of the mutton is not inferior 
to either. As a wool producer the breed does not rank high, the average yield 
being about Seven pounds, which is inferior in quality to wool of either the 
Southdown or the Shropshire. 
Two factors deserve special attention, and they are at vari- 
ance with accepted ideas. First, there must be no more feeding 
space than lambs; and second, the lambs must be prevented from 
being excited. A violation of either of these will prove fatal in
-P-A-G-E-429
FEEDING SHEEP 401 
this method of feeding. Formerly those engaged in lamb feed- 
ing lost many lambs without apparent cause. They were the 
thriftiest and fattest lambs, and the loss was often very heavy, 
for when one lamb died, others were sure to follow. This led to 
experimentation which brought out the following facts: the lambs 
died of apoplexy, the result of overeating or of excitement. 
When one lamb died, this left an extra feed space, another lamb 
overate and died of the same cause. When the feed space was 
closed as a lamb was removed and the amount fed was cut 
down accordingly, and when the animals were kept perfectly 
free from excitement, no fatalities occurred. In all other re- 
spects, such as the feeds used, watering, salting, and the like, 
the lambs were treated the same as suggested for corn-belt 
feeding. 
SAMPLE RATIONS FOR FATTENING SHEEP 
The following rations are collected from various sources, to 
furnish a guide in determining the kind and amount of feed that 
should be allowed fattening lambs. In all cases the rations are 
calculated for 100 head:

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 
TueERE are fewer sheep bred in America than of any other of 
our farm animals. This is due in a large measure to the average 
American farmer’s lack of knowledge in propagating sheep. 
He is wont to treat them as swine, and under such care sheep fail 
to thrive. Sheep breeding is a very profitable branch of farm- 
ing in England and France, where entire farms are devoted to 
the industry. These farms are profitable because in charge of 
a competent flock-master, who does no other work, but makes 
a very careful study of the needs of his flock and supplies 
every want. On many of these farms the soil was formerly very 
poor, but through sheep farming they have been restored to 
fertility, and at present many of them grow very luxuriant crops 
of forage. 
In America conditions are somewhat different, though there 
is no reason why our cheap pasture lands cannot be made to 
yield a handsome profit if slowly converted into sheep pastures. 
Lack of suitable labor is the greatest drawback to sheep farm- 
ing in America. We have no flock-masters, as do the English, 
and the average American seems to be too nervous and unsteady 
to tend sheep with perfect assurance of success. Properly 
cared for, sheep are among the most profitable of farm animals, 
and restore fertility to the land as do no other animals. Every 
farm devoted to general agriculture should possess a small flock. 
While they will need considerable care, on such a farm, the food 
they consume will be largely that which otherwise would be 
wasted. ‘ 
403
-P-A-G-E-432
  404 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
At present, the farmer should start with a small flock, increas- 
ing it gradually as he learns its habits and needs. The unex- 
perienced should begin with a grade flock of ewes, which should 
be mated to a pure-bred ram. The sire is as important in the 
flock as in the herd of dairy cattle. The second year a few pure- 
bred ewes, of the same breeding as the ram, may be purchased; 
and with these as a basis, start a pure-bred flock. Some of the 
best flocks in America have been started in this way. 
PLAN OF BREEDING 
A clearly defined plan should be outlined before the farmer 
makes an attempt at breeding sheep. The intending sheep 
breeder should make a careful study of successful sheep farms, 
noting the conditions wherein his differs, and the modifications 
that must be adopted. The farmer who rushes into sheep 
breeding blindly because the price of wool or mutton seems 
to warrant it is likely to pay dearly for his experience. 
Coéperative breeding. — The value of united effort cannot be 
overestimated in breeding sheep. This does not mean that 
the farmers should be partners from a financial point of view, 
but all should help to advance the interests of each other’s flock. 
Free conversation on all matters relating to the flock will prove 
of common advantage; the owner will improve in sheep knowl- 
edge, and the flock improve in excellency. There are many 
things that a few sheep breeders would be able to do that one 
alone would hardly undertake, and not least among these is 
the purchasing of a pure-bred ram of much excellency. The 
influence of such a ram is left in the flocks of several breeders, 
and uniformity is promoted. The old saying, ‘in unity there 
is strength,” applies to the sheep industry, as to others. 
CHOOSING BREEDING STOCK 
In choosing the foundation flock, the farmer must have in 
mind the demand that he means to supply, wool or mutton, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 405 
if mutton, whether he means to raise hot-house lambs or older 
mutton. He should bear in mind that in general “like pro- 
duces like” and that ‘blood will tell.” This applies to the 
ewes as well as to the ram. Bad qualities of one are as likely 
to appear in the lambs as bad qualities of the other. Even after 
using the greatest care in finding the breeding stock, the breeder 
must be prepared to expect many lambs inferior to both parents. 
The type or breed should depend on the individual preference 
of the breeders. The advisability of selecting wool or mutton 
sheep will depend on the conditions. Mutton is preéminently 
adapted to the corn-belt, although a great many wool sheep are 
found there. Where hot-house and early spring lambs are to be 
produced, Merino and Horned-Dorset blood must predominate. 
Where the grazing land is much broken, some breed other than 
the pure mutton is likely to give best results. For such lands 
a good grazing breed is demanded. Whatever breed is chosen, 
there should be no further change, 
for it is indiscriminate and zigzag 
crossing that has produced our 
present common stock. 
Uniformity. —In choosing the 
foundation flock of breeding ewes, 
no single factor is‘of greater im- 
portance than uniformity. The 
ewes should be uniform in type, Trattaa He 
weight, quality, and breeding. Champion, International Live 
Such lock wll epstslghtly more | Gk or 8 Pinar than one not uniform in these 
characters, but will prove much the more profitable in the 
Jong run. As we have already observed in the discussion of 
mutton production, uniformity is a market requirement, and 
when it is wanting in the breeding ewes, it will also be lacking 
in the crop of lambs. When one is producing wool, an even, uni- 
form clipping is to be desired. Furthermore, if the breeder 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  406 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
wishes to sell his surplus ewes for breeding purposes, they will 
command a much higher price if uniform in all features, both 
because of their intrinsic worth, and because of their improved 
general appearance. 
The ram 
The ram is by far the most important member of the flock. 
Successful sheep breeders rely on him for much of the improve- 
ment of the flock. What has been said about the stallion (page 
102) and the bull (page 244) also applies here. 
The ewe flock 
If the farmer is just beginning, the best time to purchase the 
foundation ewes is in the early fall; the best place to purchase 
is in the locality in which the flock is to be kept. Breeding ewes 
on the large markets are often discarded from other flocks or 
from the western ranges. Such ewes are usually sent to market 
because of their age or failure to breed, and are to be avoided 
when possible. Local ewes will give much better satisfaction 
when they can be procured; they are adapted to climatic 
conditions and parasite dangers. Western ewes do not resist 
parasites as do native ewes. By purchasing the flock in the 
early fall, the new owner has time to become familiar with it 
before winter; he can see to the mating, and thus know exactly 
what time to expect the lambs. 
In choosing foundation ewes, too much attention cannot be 
given the individual animals. They should each be carefully 
considered. If purchased on a large market, the condition of 
their teeth should be especially noted, as a ewe without teeth, 
even though she breeds, is likely to give much trouble at lamb- 
ing time. Moderately heavy fleeces are to be preferred, as they 
indicate stronger sheep and greater feeding capacity. When 
possible the condition of the udder should be noted, as many 
ewes have spoiled udders and imperfect teats. 
 
-P-A-G-E-435
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 407 
THE BREEDING OF THE EWES 
Productive period. — There is a strong tendency on the part 
of beginners to breed yearling lambs, particularly if they are well 
grown. The yearling ewe should not be bred, as the drain on 
her system weakens her condition and leaves her an easy prey 
to parasite infection. Furthermore, if breeding the yearling 
is persisted in, it will lessen the size of the ewe. The ewe 
may remain in the breeding flock as long as she continues to 
breed true. She will be unreliable after her teeth drop out, as 
it is difficult for her to nourish the fetus in winter when dry 
forage is the main feed. Unless a valuable ewe, a better plan 
is to fatten her as soon as she begins to lose her teeth. Ewes 
vary widely in the age at which they stop breeding, some being 
unreliable at four or five years, while others will continue to 
breed until eight years, and even longer. 
Season to breed. — The season to mate the ewes will depend 
on the time the lambs are wanted. In this country, on the 
average farm, the breeding season begins in September ot 
October. To encourage breeding early, the ewes are often fed 
a very stimulating ration, a practice sometimes spoken of as 
“flushing” ; and some owners hold the ewes while the ram 
serves them, then in a few days the ewes come around natu- 
rally, when the ram serves them again in the natural way. 
When spring lambs are to be produced, the mating must be 
done in August, September, and October, as the lambs should 
be dropped in January, February, and March. To get the lambs 
to mate in August requires similar treatment to that suggested 
for winter lambs (page 389). On the average farm the mating 
should all be done before Christmas, as lambs dropped after the 
middle of May are not likely to thrive without much extra care. 
Method of mating. — The common practice is to let the ram 
run with the flock during the breeding season. This is not a wise 
practice. A better plan is to keep him away from the ewes,

  THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 409 
bringing them to him each morning while it is cool. The ewes 
should be placed in a small pen and the ram turned in, when he 
will single out those ready to be mated. As soon as mated, 
the ewe should be marked and placed in a quiet pen, where she 
should remain for about two days before returning to the flock.

The Oxford Down breed of mutton sheep originated in Oxford County, Eng- 
land. This breed is similar to the Hampshire except in size, when it occupies 
first rank, rams weighing 275 pounds and the ewes 200 pounds. When large 
mutton is desired, this breed is unexceled. In wool production it excels the 
Hampshires, shearing from 5 to 10 pounds of combing wool. 
One service is sufficient. The ram will search out another, and 
she should be treated likewise. The ram should not be per- 
mitted to serve more than four in asingle morning; if more are 
ready, return them to him in the evening. All ewes that are 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
  410 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
served in the same week should receive a similar mark. Those 
served one week may be marked on the back, or top of head, 
with red paint, the second with black, those served during the 
third week with green, and so on, using a different color each 
week. By this method one can tell the week the ewe was 
served, when the lamb may be expected, and when the entire 
flock of ewes has been mated. 
Managing the ram. — During the day the ram should be kept 
in a quiet cool place, and out of sight of the ewe flock. He should 
be fed liberally on stimulating food, such as oats, bran, and 
clover or alfalfa hay. In the closed season, when not in use, 
he should have the run of a paddock. In summer this should 
contain sufficient grass for much of his feed, although he should 
be fed grain in addition. In winter he should be treated much 
as the flock, but kept in a quiet place and away from all un- 
necessary noise and excitement. 
The pregnant ewe. — The proper care of the ewe flock during 
pregnancy will do much to lessen the difficulties at parturition 
time and subsequently. The ewes must be kept in fair flesh, 
neither too fat nor too thin. The wool deceives, and one is likely 
to think the ewes in good condition when in reality they may 
be thin. Being thin, the ewe has no milk, and will not own 
the lamb, which must be raised by hand,—a very difficult 
task, and entirely impracticable when there are many lambs. 
On the other hand, if the ewes are fed abundantly on oats, 
wheat bran, and clover or alfalfa hay, the lambs get so large 
that there is much trouble in giving birth. In such cases, ewes 
are likely to perish at lambing time, although such as do 
survive will raise thrifty, vigorous lambs. Better results will 
follow taking a middle course. 
The pregnant ewe flock should be liberally fed such foods as 
will develop bone and muscle, but not to excess. If the dry 
forage is cornstalks, then feed wheat bran and oats for the grain 
part of the ration; and if the dry fodder is clover or alfalfa hay,
-P-A-G-E-439
  
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 411 
then cracked corn may constitute the grain. If at all possible, 
succulent food, either roots or silage, should be provided, as 
such food serves to keep them in good physical condition, and to 
encourage the flow of milk.

The Suffolk Down mutton sheep originated in Suffolk County, England. They 
are similar in many respects to the Hampshires, though perhaps a little under 
them in weight. They are inferior to the Hampshire as wool producers, 
shearing only 5 to 7 pounds of fair-quality wool. 
Lambing time. — The period of gestation in the ewe is popu» 
larly placed at five months, more accurately 150 days (page 
408). Previous to the lambing time the sheep owner should 
make ready for this eventful season. The ewes should be neatly 
tagged, all wool being removed from the udder, as otherwise a
-P-A-G-E-440
412 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
lamb might nurse a tag instead of a teat. A number of small 
panels three feet high and four feet long, made from light wood, 
should be provided. Two of these panels should be hinged 
together like the letter L, so that when placed in the corner of 
the barn they make a pen four feet square. Enough of these 
should be provided so that a row of four-foot pens may be placed 
along the side of the barn or shed. When not in use, these panels 
may be folded up and laid away. As soon as a ewe has lambed, 
she and her lamb should be placed in one of these small pens, 
thus preventing the lamb from straying away, as it is very 
likely to do if not restrained. 
Ewes that have been well cared for during pregnancy are 
likely to have a good supply of milk. They should be separated 
from the flock at once, and given extra care. For a time they 
should be sparingly fed on grain, as it is not considered best to 
force the milk flow until the lambs are able to take care of it 
without danger of digestive disorders, such as scouring. The 
grain ration may consist of 50 parts chopped corn, 50 parts 
wheat bran, and 10 parts linseed meal. For dry forage, clover or 
alfalfa hay is preferred, and if possible a small amount of silage 
or roots should be fed, as in the case of the pregnant ewe. 
Difficult parturition. — Ewes that are not properly fed during 
pregnancy, and are thin and weak, often have difficulty in deliv- 
ering the lamb. Young ewes, even though well kept, often have 
trouble in dropping their first lamb. Whenever there is difficult 
parturition, an attendant of experience should be near by to 
render assistance. When the ewe shows signs of lambing, such 
as teats filling out to end, the vulva swelling and becoming deeply 
colored, and in some cases the ewe looking for her lamb before 
it is born, she should be placed in a pen away from the flock, and 
closely watched. In natural parturition the lamb comes with 
front feet first and nose just between. Non-interference is 
recommended until it is evident the ewe needs aid. The head 
and shoulders are the hardest part to deliver, and after these are  
-P-A-G-E-441
  THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 413 
through, there is not likely to be further trouble. In wrong 
presentation it is usually necessary to place the parts in the 
right position before the lamb can be delivered. The method is 
much thesame as that suggested for difficult parturition in cattle 
(see page 334). In such cases the attendant is fortunate if he 
possesses a small hand, which should always be annointed or 
greased before attempting to manipulate the parts. Forceps 
are sometimes used, because of the small size of the opening, 
but their manipulation requires some experience, though their 
use is to be recommended in preference to permitting both ewe 
and lamb to die unaided. In all manipulations extra care should 
be taken, drawing gently, during labor pains only. The traction 
should be downward as well as backward. 
After delivery, if the ewe is weak, there is nothing better for 
her than a drink of warm oatmeal gruel. If she will not drink 
without aid, the gruel may be given from a long-necked bottle, 
similar to drenching. This may be fed three or four times daily 
until she gains strength. 
THE LAMBS 
Young lambs are very delicate things, and their treatment 
the first few hours after birth will go a long way toward deter- 
mining the kind of sheep they are to make. If they make their 
appearance naturally, and get their first meal unaided, they are 
not likely to give much trouble. Not all lambs are so fortunate. 
Occasionally one is born without difficulty, but fails to establish 
respiration, — does not breathe. In such cases assistance 
must be given at once, or the young lamb perishes. Respiration 
may be established by blowing into the mouth and nostrils, 
by rubbing the lamb, or by gently slapping the sides with the 
open hand. Other lambs may establish respiration, but be so 
weak they cannot find the maternal teat, and perish in a few 
hours if not assisted to the first meal. 
The first meal. — It is very essential that the lamb get the first  
-P-A-G-E-442
  414 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
milk of the ewe. When the lamb is too weak to move, it must be 
assisted. To do this, gently set the ewe on her rump, as though 
you were going to shear her. Place the lamb on its side under 
her hind limbs, with one hand open the lamb’s mouth, and with 
the other milk a small 
quantity of the dam’s 
milk on the lamb’s 
tongue, at the same 
time placing the teat 
into the lamb’s mouth, 
when it will usually 
begin to suck at once. 
The ewe and lamb 
should be watched 
closely to see that the 
lamb gets its second 
meal, for it may be nec- 
essary to aid it a second 
time and even a third 
(Fig. 136). 
If the ewe perishes 
during the parturition, 
and there is no other 
ewe the lamb can be put with, it will be necessary to give the 
lamb its food from a bottle with rubber nipple. Modified cow’s 
milk should be given. Feed the milk at about body tempera- 
ture, 103° F., giving a very small amount, but often, every two 
hours at first. 
A chilled lamb. — Occasionally lambs get separated from their 
dams and become chilled. This is very likely to happen unless 
ewe and lamb are confined to a small space. A hot bath is the 
best thing for a chilled lamb. Immerse the lamb in water as 
hot as one can bear the hand. Keep the water hot by adding 
more of it, taking care not to scald the lamb. When warmed, 
  Fic. 136.—Meruop or TEACHING HELPLESS 
Youne Lams to Suck. 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 415 
wipe dry with flannel cloth and restore to the dam. Aid the 
lamb to get its first meal, and watch closely. Sometimes 
a few drops of whisky in warm water is given chilled 
lambs. It is surprising how much a hot bath will revive 
cold wet lambs, and the method is worth trial, no matter how 
limp the lamb. 
It is a good plan to make some provision in advance, to care 
for twin lambs; for often one will chill while the dam is nursing 
the other. To do this provide a box, say two feet square and 
eighteen inches deep, placing five inches of bran in it. While 
the ewe is nursing one lamb, the other may be placed in the warm 
bran, and all covered but the nose; this will keep the lamb warm 
and help to dry it. After a time return to the ewe. In licking 
off the bran she will own it. In the absence of the bran, a jug 
of hot water may be placed in the box with the lamb, and a 
blanket thrown over the top of the box. 
A disowned lamb. — Occasionally a young ewe, or an old one 
very thin in flesh, will neglect or disown her lamb, and refuse 
to care for it. Usually the ewe will take to the lamb if she is 
held while the lamb nurses. To hold the ewe, a small stanchion 
should be constructed. The stanchion may consist simply of 
two green stakes, one and one-half inches in diameter, driven 
into the ground and held at the top with a piece of rope or strap. 
Sometimes a little meal placed on the lamb will induce the 
ewe to nurse it and to claim it. 
Occasionally a ewe will lose her lamb, and have her udder 
filled with milk. At the same time, there may be other ewes in 
the flock with twins, and it is a good plan to give one of the twins 
to a ewe that has lost her lamb. Sometimes difficulty is experi- 
enced in getting her to own it. The ewe may be placed in 
a stanchion; if she still refuses, the lamb may be washed to re- 
move its odor, then some of the ewe’s milk placed on its head 
and back, at the same time placing some of the ewe’s milk on 
her own nose, when she will often own the lamb.

Lamb ills | 
Having made its appearance into the world, with or without 
difficulty, the lamb is still subject to many troubles, chief of 
which are diarrhea, constipation, sore mouth, and contagious 
sore eyes. The extent of these troubles will depend largely on 
the care given the ewe while she is nursing the lamb. By proper 
management these troubles may be materially reduced, and in 
many cases entirely avoided. The ewes should be kept in dry, 
well ventilated, well lighted quarters, permitted to take exercise 
in a dry or well bedded lot, and fed healthy, nutritious foods. 
Constipation may be caused by the lamb getting too much 
milk, or to difficult teething, in which latter case the gums 
should be rubbed until the teeth are through. When constipa- 
tion prevails, reduce the ewe’s grain ration. It may be necessary 
partly to milk the ewe. If this does not afford relief, inject in 
the rectum a small amount, not to exceed two ounces, of warm 
water, to which a little glycerine has been added. Do not inject 
too much, and do not use soap suds. 
Diarrhea is often caused by overfeeding. When the lamb is 
troubled with diarrhea or scouring, the treatment is to milk the 
ewe, in part, remembering that the last milk is the richer in fat, 
the element causing the disturbance. The ewe’s grain ration 
should be reduced. If the ewes are running on pasture, feed some 
timothy hay scattered on the grass or placed in racks conven- 
iently located. If the scours persist, or if the discharge is white, 
then a mild, healing laxative and tonic should be given. Mix 
one-fourth ounce of common cooking soda, one ounce of sulfate 
of magnesia, and as much ground ginger ascan be taken up on a 
penny, with one-half pint of gruel, and give as a drench. In four 
hours follow with a dose of one ounce of linseed oil. 
“Pinning” is due to an accumulation of excrement at the 
vent and tail in such a manner that the proper function of 
the bowels cannot be performed. The treatment is to remove 
the filth from the parts, and dust with powdered chalk.  
-P-A-G-E-445
  
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 417 
Sore mouth.—Often lambs are troubled with a kind of conta- 
gious sore mouth, which affects the teats of the ewes as well. 
These sores form scabs along the edges of the mouth, and small 
sores on the teats of the ewe. This often becomes so serious 
as to interfere with the thrift of the lamb. The treatment is 
to rub off the scabs and apply undiluted coal-tar dip, of which 
there are many kinds on the market, such as are mentioned on 
page 426. This will effect a complete cure. 
Sore eyes. — Like sore mouth, this is a contagious disease; 
and, while often interfering seriously with the thrift of the lambs, 
is very easily cured. One of the coal-tar dips diluted with forty 
parts water used as a wash will work a rapid cure. It is well 
to see that a little of the diluted dip gets into the eyes; this may 
start the tears, but it has the desired effect. 
General care of lambs 
Feeding the lambs. — Lambs early begin to nibble at hay and 
grain, and advantage should be taken of this to encourage them 
to eat solid food. During lambhood the digestion is more 
thorough, and lambs make larger gains from a given quantity 
of food, than at any other time. Encourage the lamb to eat 
food in addition to that furnished by the dam. Furthermore, 
this extra feeding renders weaning a very easy task. At the 
age of ten days to two weeks lambs will begin to eat grain, and 
special provision should be made for them. For this construct 
a creep (page 392). Grain should be put down twice daily, 
and no more than the lambs will consume, as it will become 
stale if left in the boxes. Lambs that have been well fed in 
every way always mature to be much larger and stronger with 
heavier fleeces than the others. 
Weaning the lambs. — Weaning is more a matter of prepara- 
tion than of actual separation. When lambs have been accus- 
tomed to grain as suggested and when they can have access 
to the creeps after the ewes are removed, there will be very little 
25
-P-A-G-E-446
  
  418 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
shrinkage. When practicable, the ewes should be removed, leav- 
ing the lambs in their accustomed place. All things considered, 
it is better that the separation be complete. The ewes should 
be carefully watched to see that none suffer from caked udder. 
The age at which lambs should be weaned will depend on the 
  Fie. 137. — Hornep Dorset Ram. First prize and champion ram at four State 
* Fairs, 1909. Owned at Heart’s Delight Farm, Chazy, N. Y. 
The Horned Dorset, a native of Dorset County, England, while noted for the 
production of both mutton and wool, is more especially noted for prolificacy 
and the production of lambs at any season of the year. No breed excels the 
Dorsets in the production of winter lambs. As a breed the animals are 
hardy and good grazers. The ‘rams average 200 pounds and the ewes 160 
pounds. They shear from 5 to 10 pounds of wool. This breed is popular in 
the United States, 
object sought. When spring lambs are sought, the lambs may 
run with the ewes until sold, but for other lambs it is better to 
wean at three or four months of age. In such cases the lambs 
should be weaned and removed from the old pastures before 
 
-P-A-G-E-447
  
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 419 
there is danger of parasite infection. As soon as weaned, the 
lambs should be placed on sown pastures as suggested in the 
discussion on feeding the flock in summer (page 381). While 
this is often neglected, it is very important, for after the young 
lambs once become infected with germs, they are not likely to 
thrive, and will prove a failure. Some forethought is required 
in arranging and sowing the pastures, but if sheep farming is 
to prove profitable, it is very essential, especially throughout 
the corn-belt and those regions subject to parasites. 
Castrating male lambs. — The male lambs should be castrated 
at ten days to two weeks old, as they will suffer less if operated 
at this time. Lambs intended for hot-house trade should not be 
castrated, as the exposed testicles add to the appearance of the 
carcass when on the market. The operation is not difficult, 
and there is practically no danger of injuring the lamb. An 
assistant should hold the lamb in such a position as to expose the 
scrotum. Sever the end of the scrotum, pinch the testicle out, 
and remove with the adhering cords. The scrotum may be 
rubbed with a mixture of tallow and turpentine, half and half, 
and the lamb returned to the dam. 
Docking the lambs. — Unless the lambs are to be sent to market 
under three months of age, they should have the tail removed. 
The tail is of no use to the sheep and is likely to become foul. 
Docked lambs thrive better than undocked, and they present a 
fuller and squarer appearance. The lambs should be docked 
at ten days to two weeks of age, or even younger if strong. 
This may be done by severing the tail with a sharp knife, cut- 
ting from the under side, by the use of a mallet and sharp chisel; 
or, better still, by the use of docking pincers. These pincers 
resemble the ordinary shoeing pincers and may be made by any 
blacksmith. The edges should be rather thin, with the back 
heavy in order to hold heat, for by heating them to redness and 
then severing the tail the stump will bleed but little, whereas if 
the tails of lambs in very good condition are severed with a
-P-A-G-E-448
  420 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
sharp instrument, such as a knife or chisel, a few of the lambs 
may bleed to death. Bore a hole of sufficient size to admit the 
lamb’s tail in a board, and when ready for use, heat the pincers 
to redness, pull the tail through the hole to protect the lamb’s 
rump, and sever the tail quickly. 
' Wing suggests to make the pincers large enough to admit a 
grown ram’s scrotum, and when it is desired to castrate such a 
ram, protect the body with a board as before and hold up the 
scrotum and slowly sever with the pincers heated to redness.

UNTIL PERMANENT TAGS CAN BE INSERTED INTO THE Har. 
Marking lambs. —To avoid errors and mistaken identity 
the young lambs should be marked as soon as possible after 
birth. Identifying unmarked lambs is a difficult task and one 
which experienced flock-masters are often unable to do, hence 
the importance of marking the young lamb. The young lamb’s 
ear is very tender and will not carry a label until well grown, 
so a temporary marking must be used. There are two
-P-A-G-E-449
    
THE BREEDING OF SHEEP 421 
successful methods of marking sheep,— by the use of water- 
proof ink, and by notching the ear. Procure a small brush 
and some waterproof ink, or regular sheep-marking fluid, and 
place on the lamb the number on the ear tag of the ewe. If 
this method is used, it will be necessary to renew the number, 
as it will fade as the lamb grows. 
Some persons prefer to notch the ear of the lamb, as it is 
likely to be more permanent. The ordinary ear punch is 
used to mark the ear, and the following method is as good as 
any :— The first lamb would have one notch in the top of 
the left ear next to the head; the second, one notch in the 
middle; the third, one notch in the end; the fifth, one notch 
on the lower side, and so on, up to 400. Then when permanent 
ear markings are desired, they may be inserted when convenient 
and the record inserted in the flock book. (See Fig. 138.)

    CHAPTER XIX 
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 
Tue ability to care for sheep successfully is a faculty to be 
increased and strengthened by careful study and experience. 
All that may be written is of no consequence without practice. 
The timidity of sheep, dainty appetites, inability to endure 
dampness, draughts, mud lots, as well as their liability to para- 
site infection, must be well understood by those who expect to 
make sheep growing profitable. The knowledge is very easy 
to obtain, and methods of combating are not difficult, but they 
demand persistent effort on the part of the sheep owner. 
Sheep may be successfully grown on any general farm or where 
there is an opportunity for changes in grazing. When the 
farm has the equipment and is conveniently located to a rail- 
road leading to one of our larger cities, winter-lamb production 
may be most profitable, whereas if the farm lacks equipment 
and has much cheap grazing land, some other form of sheep 
production would doubtless yield the greater profit. Each 
farmer must make a careful study of his conditions, such as 
location, facilities for shipping, demands of his market, condi- 
tion of the soil, and the like, then lay his plans accordingly. 
Wherever the farm, whatever the conditions, whenever sheep 
growing is to be practiced, ample provision must be made for 
change in pasture. Sheep may live, or at least the older ones 
may, without change, but if put into a pasture in the spring, 
and compelled to remain there until fall, they will never attain 
the size they would have attained had there been a frequent 
change of pasture. Where sheep are thus pastured, the lambs 
422
-P-A-G-E-451
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 423 
often perish as a result of parasites. Sheep profit by a change 
of pasture even if, so far as the pasture is concerned, the 
change is from a good to a poor one. 
DIPPING SHEEP 
Dipping the sheep is an essential part of sheep growing. 
No farmer should attempt to raise sheep without planning to 
dip the sheep, not only upon their arrival at the farm, but 
twice annually thereafter. Fortunately the process is very 
simple as well as inexpensive. 
Importance of dipping. — There are two essential reasons why 
all sheep should be dipped: first, to free them of ticks; and 
second, to free them of scab 
germs. It is absolutely impossi- 
ble for lambs infected with ticks 
or other parasites to thrive. A 
good dip cleanses the skin, in- 
creases the quantity and im- 
proves the quality of the wool. 
From this it is apparent that all 
sheep, whether foundation stock 
or lambs intended for fattening, 
should be dipped immediately 
REO et ar at CC a STL eg 190. He ten Danae nea! Sheep ticks can be entirely Owned by Heart’s Delight Farm. 
overcome by dipping. Sheep 
ticks inhabit no other farm animals, and once eradicated, there 
is no possible chance of their reappearing unless brought to the 
flock on infested sheep, or carried in some manner, as in the 
clothing of shearers, from an infested flock. 
Sheep scab can likewise be prevented by dipping. This scab 
is caused by a minute parasite, too small to be seen by the naked 
eye, which irritates the skin, causing a watery exudate. This 
exudate forms a crust beneath which the scab mite burrows, 
 
-P-A-G-E-452
  424 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
greatly irritating the animal, causing loss of flesh, intense itch- 
ing, loss of wool, and frequently results in death to the sheep. 
Sheep affected with scab are uneasy, pawing with the foot and 
biting at the affected parts, which are usually along the neck and 
shoulders. If such an animal be carefully examined, the wool and 
skin will appear abnormal at the affected parts. A slight exu- 
date is noticed which later forms a scab, which rapidly spreads. 
The mite is transferred from one sheep to another and soon the 
entire flock is affected. 
Common places for sheep to become infected with the scab 
mite are in the stock-yards, railroad stock-pens, and in stock- 
cars, unless well disinfected. As they multiply very rapidly, 
a few parasites gathered up in this way will soon run through 
an entire flock. When once the sheep become affected and 
scabs formed, the disease is hard to eradicate. If taken in 
time, prevention is very easy. Hence the importance of dip- 
ping all newly purchased sheep before they infect the farm or 
the flock. 
The dipping vat. — The nature of the dipping vat or tank will 
be determined largely by the size of the flock. For a small 
flock such as is kept on the average farm, a simple trough of wood, 
metal, or concrete, 16 inches wide at the top and 6 inches at the 
bottom, 4 feet deep, and 8 to 12 feet long, will prove ample. 
The vat must be narrow so the sheep cannot turn around; must 
be deep so they can be plunged clear under and no spot escape the 
dip; and the longer the vat, the quicker the dipping can be per- 
formed, as each animal should remain in the dip at least one 
minute. The end of the vat at which the sheep enter should be 
perpendicular, so that they may be made to jump in the dip and 
thus be completely submerged. At the other end, there should 
be a gradual incline up which the sheep can walk. Here an in- 
cline platform should be constructed, so that the drippings of the 
dipped sheep may be returned to the vat, otherwise much of the 
dip will be wasted, particularly if the wool is long. On farms

CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 425 
where sheep are to be kept continuously the vat should be con- 
structed in the ground. This will facilitate getting the sheep in 
and out, and in many clay soils will last a lifetime. In the ab- 
sence of such a vat, do not neglect to dip the sheep upon their 
arrival at the farm, for trouble will surely follow. In the ab- 
sence of anything better, use an ordinary water-trough, one man 
holding the sheep by the forelegs, another by the hind legs, and

The Cheviot breed of sheep originated in Scotland. The breed is noted for the 
production of wooland mutton. The sheep are comparatively small, but very 
hardy and excellent grazers. In appearance the animals are neat and trim.

shear from 6 to 11 pounds of medium-length wool. 
dip backs first. See that the head is immersed. The dip 
will run down the legs when the sheep are permitted to stand. 
This is crude but to be preferred to no dipping and the farm 
becoming infested with ticks and scab, which it surely will if 
dipping new arrivals is neglected. 
How dips are used. — The dip must be hot. The best tem- 
perature is that which a man can endure with the bare arm. 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  426 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
If the dip is too hot, it will scald; if too cold, it will be less 
effective. The water may be heated in a large kettle and kept 
hot by throwing red-hot irons or heated stones into the tank. 
This is a very convenient way to heat the dip if any remains in 
the tank. The water should be softened by the addition of 
enough concentrated lye to give it an oily feeling like soap 
suds, or by the addition of wood ashes. 
The best dip to use is some one of the coal-tar preparations, as 
Zenoleum, Naptholeum, Daytholeum, Milk Oil, and the like. 
These are fairly cheap, very effective, cleansing to the:skin, heal- 
ing to diseased eyes and mouth, pleasant to use, and sure death 
to all forms of parasite life. The direction given on the cans in 
which the coal-tar comes is to use at a strength of one part 
of dip to 100 parts water. While this is strong enough to kill 
ticks, it is not sufficient to remove scab germs. When the sheep 
have first arrived or when dipping for scab, use one part dip to 
40 parts water. 
When dipping for ticks, one minute is sufficient length of time 
for the sheep to remain in the solution. When dipping new ar- 
rivals or for scab, the sheep should remain in the dip two minutes 
and the head should be immersed twice. With the dip hot, the 
water softened, the dip used at a strength of 1 to 40, and the 
sheep left in for two minutes, all external parasitic life will be 
destroyed. If scab is suspected, the dipping should be repeated 
in eight to ten days, as the dip will not kill theeggs, and a second 
dipping is essential completely to eradicate the scab mites. 
Frequency of dipping. — All sheep arriving at the farm should 
be dipped before they infect the lots. In addition to this the 
entire flock should be dipped at least once a year, and it will be 
the better for it if dipped twice annually. One dipping should 
take place soon after shearing, as less dip will be required. It 
should not, however, follow too closely after shearing. <A 
pleasant day should be selected, and the sheep should be well 
protected until dry. It will take them several hours to dry
-P-A-G-E-455
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 427 
out. At this time it should not take more than one quart of 
the mixture to a sheep, whereas if the sheep is not shorn, it 
will take approximately one gallon. The second dipping should 
be in the fall, some fair day just before the sheep are placed 
in their winter quarters. This second dipping will pay be- 
cause of its invigorating influence, even though the sheep are 
free from ticks. By all means, the sheep should be dipped at 
once on the outbreak of scab unless in the very severest of winter 
weather. 
SHEARING SHEEP 
Formerly it was the custom to wash the sheep before shearing 
and shear later in the season than at present. This was in the 
days of the spinning wheel and hand loom. The practice of 
washing the wool was continued somewhat later, for it was 
thought that it prepared the wool for the manufacture. This 
it did not do, but it did rerider the wool lighter by removing the 
natural oil and hence was a distinct disadvantage to the farmer. 
Washing sheep.— At the present time comparatively few 
sheep are washed before shearing, though in some localities it is 
still profitable, as buyers discriminate against unwashed wool. 
The washing is usually done in a brook. The water should be 
about waist deep, the bottom of the brook sandy, gravelly, or 
rocky, and free from mud, and the shore firm, clean, and grassy. 
There should be sufficient current to carry the dirt away when 
pressed out of the wool. A small inclosure near the shore re- 
strains the sheep; one man catches the sheep, a second tags 
them and removes the filth from the hind-quarters, while the 
third man washes. The washer leads the sheep into the water 
beyond its depth. The sheep is easily handled. Attention 
should be given all parts of the fleece. The wool is pressed 
between the open hands, which removes the dirt and discolors 
the water. When no further discoloration can be produced, 
the sheep is removed to the shore. The animal should be held
-P-A-G-E-456
    
428 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
until slightly drained to prevent it from falling as a result of 
the weight of the water in the fleece. The flock should then 
be kept in a clean place for at least one week to permit the 
yolk or oil to be replaced. 
When to shear. — The time for shearing will depend somewhat. 
on the conditions. If winter lambs are sought, the shearing 
should be done in March or before, whereas if there is no hurry 
about the lambs and the sheep are not well protected, the wool 
may be left on until warm weather. With the coming of warm 
weather the wool must be removed or the sheep will not thrive. 
When at all practicable, early shearing is to be recommended, as 
the sheep will do much better. If troubled with ticks, they will 
leave as soon as the sheep are shorn, though in this case it is well 
to see that the ticks do not go to the lambs. The amount of 
wool taken off will be greater if the sheep are shorn regularly in 
March or April than if shorn in June. Where washing the wool 
is practiced, the sheep cannot be shorn until warm weather as 
it is unsafe to wash the animals in the late winter or early 
spring. 
Hand shearing. — Hand shearing requires much skill and con- 
siderable practice. A good man will shear from 40 to 100 sheep 
in a day, using common hand shears. Many experts shear upon 
the floor, though some prefer a platform. The work should 
be done in a light, airy place. While each shearer has his own 
method, it is some modification of the following: The sheep is 
placed on its rump with its back to the shearer supported by 
the left arm, with the shears in the right hand. The wool is 
then removed from the brisket and neck down to the shoulders. 
The fleece is then opened down the abdomen and first clipped 
on the left side as far around as the back bone and then on the 
right side in a similar manner, all the time exercising much care 
in keeping the fleece together. Care must be exercised not to 
cut too deep at one stroke or the sheep will not be smooth. The 
points of the shears must be kept close to the hide, otherwise a
-P-A-G-E-457
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 429 
second stroke will be necessary, which injures the wool and takes 
much time. 
In some regions it is customary to tie the fore and hind legs 
of the sheep to a board in such a manner that the animal cannot 
kick, placing it on a low platform, and in this position reliev- 
ing it of its wool. Such practice is condemned by all experi- 
enced sheep owners. 
For the beginner to shear a sheep by hand is really a very 
difficult task, and if the sheep be a fine-wool, the task is still 
greater. 
Machinery shearing. — Shearing sheep with a machine is a very 
much more easy task than shearing by hand, and the beginner 
can do very much better work with it. On the market there 
are both hand and power machines, but on the average farm 
the hand machine is, of course, the one to use. To operate the 
machine requires two men or a man and boy, — one to turn the 
machine, the other to shear the sheep. If available, the be- 
ginner should take a coarse-wooled sheep, as the fine-wools are 
more difficult to shear. With a rather coarse-wooled sheep one 
can follow the directions and shear the sheep, even though he 
has never seen the operation. Most sheep are now shorn by 
a machine. 
With the sheep before you and facing to the left, grasp it by 
the right hind leg with the left hand and gently but firmly place 
it on its rump, in an upright position, the shoulders resting against 
the shearers knees, with the machine to the right. It is impor- 
tant to remember that the sheep should always be turned to the 
right. With a little experience this can be done with the feet, 
leaving the hands free for the real work. Another essential 
always to be borne in mind is to hold the sheep in such a way 
that the skin is stretched tight on the part of the body that is 
being sheared. Never place the left hand in front of the shears, 
as you will surely cut the sheep (if you are right-handed). 
With the sheep held firmly between the knees, part the wool at

Gather up the wool, as in illustration (Fig. 151). With a 
little practice the task of shearing with a good machine will 
be more easily accomplished than it is to explain. 
Tying the wool. — The fleece is rolled with the belly and loose 
ends inside, the cut ends out. All very dirty pieces should be 
removed and never tied up in the wool. Special wool twine 
should be used to tie the fleece, as binder twine greatly injures 
the wool, for small bits of the fiber often get into the fleece and, 
not taking the dyes, must be picked out by hand. There is no 
need of a wool-box for tying a compact bundle, as buyers prefer 
the fleece loosely tied. 
For those who prefer the wool-box, a very convenient one is 
made as follows: Secure five pieces of boards; three, each one 
foot square, the other two each three feet long and one foot wide. 
Of the three pieces one is to serve as the bottom of the box, the 
other two as the ends, and they should be hinged together. ac- 
cordingly. The other two boards are likewise hinged to the 
bottom piece, so that when all are raised, they form a neat wool- 
box. 
Later the wool is packed in large sacks for shipment. In filling 
the large bags care should be exercised to see that the wool is 
well packed and the corners all well filled. After being packed 
full the bags are sewed at the top. If stored, the wool should be 
put in a dry place where there is no danger of mice cutting the 
bags and building nests of the wool. 
PRACTICAL SHEEP BARNS 
Proper shelter for the flock adds greatly to its comfort and 
thrift. It need not, however, be either elaborate or costly. In 
the sheep barn there are several factors that must be provided 
for, but extra warmth not being one of the factors, the rest 
is comparatively simple and inexpensive. Chief among the 
factors. for which provision must be made are ventilation with- 
out draughts, sunshine, drainage, convenience for feeding, ar- 
2F
-P-A-G-E-462
  434 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
rangements for separating the ewes at lambing time, storage 
for grain and hay, and, if possible, a root cellar. 
The ventilation of the sheep barn should receive careful 
consideration. This must be so arranged that there are no 
draughts, as such will result in colds, running at the nose, ca- 
tarrh, and like troubles. Many experienced sheep owners pre- 
fer to ventilate the sheep quarters by placing doors across one 
side of the barn. These doors are divided in halves horizontally, 
the lower part of the door swinging as an ordinary gate swings, 
while the upper half is hinged at the upper edge. The top half 
is opened by lifting to a horizontal position and held by props 
or pendant chains. By raising the upper halves and closing the 
lower, the ventilation can be made so thorough that the inside air 
is as pure as that on the outside, and since the doors are all on one 
side of the barn, there is freedom from draughts. If the sheep 
have the run of these quarters in summer, it is well to open both 
top and bottom doors, arranging a slat door on the inside to re- 
strain the sheep. During the heat of summer, a blind is fastened 
over the windows and doors to keep out the sun’s rays and 
slightly to darken the quarters, as sheep prefer this to the 
daylight. 
An abundance of sunshine is essential to the well being of the 
breeding flock in winter. Sunshine is nature’s greatest disinfec- 
tant, and keeps the quarters light and cheery. If the row of 
doors arranged for ventilation is on the south side of the quar- 
ters, as it should be, it will admit sufficient sunshine on days when 
thedoors can be keptopen. It is oftennecessary to closethem on 
account of the severity of the weather, just after shearing, or just 
after dipping, and in such cases extra windows are very conven- 
ient. These may preferably be placed along the south side be- 
tween the doors, as then they will serve their maximum efficiency. 
In selecting a site for the sheep barn, due consideration should 
be given to drainage. Sheep cannot survive damp and muddy 
footing. Wet floors and muddy lots are to be avoided. If
-P-A-G-E-463
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 435 
possible, select ground from which there is a little slope in all 
directions, facing the barn to the south and arranging the lots 
on the south slope. It would be of much advantage to have 
the place protected on the north and west by a grove or bluff. 
In arranging the sheep quarters, convenience of feeding must 
be kept in mind. This factor is often complicated by the desir- 
ability of having provision for separating the ewes at lambing 
time. Asa rule, it is more difficult to feed the sheep in two lots 
than in one. This difficulty can often be overcome, in large

RACK AND METHOD OF DIVIDING THE PENS. 
part at least, by using the feed-rack as a partition for the two 
pens. Such an arrangement also saves the material otherwise 
necessary for the partition. To facilitate labor in feeding, ample 
provision should be made for storage of all feed, hay, and straw 
in the loft, grain in a bin on the ground floor, and if possible, 
a cellar for the storage of roots. Where convenient, water should 
be placed in the barn. 
The size of the sheep barn will depend entirely on the number 
of sheep in the flock. Experienced sheep owners do not agree as 
 
-P-A-G-E-464
  436 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
to the amount of space required, some stating that ten square 
feet is sufficient, others that they desire eighteen square feet for 
each animal. In practice, twelve square feet of floor space will 
be ample for each breeding ewe. 
The feed-racks. — Movable feed-racks are to be preferred. 
They should be comparatively long and narrow and, as suggested, 
may be used as partitions between the pens, thus economizing 
on material, and the racks may be used in different places if 
desired. A very good combination hay-rack and grain-trough 
is made as follows: With 1X8” boards for the bottoms and 
1X4" boards for the sides and ends, construct two grain- 
troughs. Place these side by side and fasten together. Or 
make one shallow trough 16 inches wide and put a partition in it 
longways, thus making two shallow grain-boxes. With 2’ X 
4” scantling and 1’’X10” boards construct a frame 2 feet 
wide at the top and as long as the grain-troughs, to serve as the 
top of the hay-rack. Now on the center partition of the grain- 
boxes nail 1” X 2” slats 30 inches long, placing them V-shaped 
and nail to the frame above, thus making a hay-rack. These 
slats may be placed 7 inches apart in order that the sheep may 
thrust their heads clear into the rack to feed. If the slats are 
placed closer together, say 3 inches apart, as is often the case, 
the sheep pull the hay through the cracks and drop much of it 
under their feet. We now have a combination grain- and hay- 
rack which, when properly braced, makes a very efficient feed- 
rack for the breeding flock. When it comes to forced feeding, as 
in fattening lambs, such a rack has the objection that more or 
less dirt filters down into the grain-troughs, and the sheep with 
their dainty appetites do not feed as well as when the grain- 
troughs and the hay-rack are separated. 
Quantity of bedding. — Bedding should be used very liberally 
in both the sheep barn and at least a part of the lot. A fresh 
supply should be put down every few days. There is much dis- 
agreement among experienced sheep owners as to the frequency
-P-A-G-E-465
CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF SHEEP 437 
of cleaning the sheep barn. Some state that they would rather 
keep adding fresh bedding and not remove the litter from the 
time the sheep go into the winter quarters in the fall until’ 
turned to pasture in the spring. Their chief objection to remoyv-

ing the litter is the foul odor and the annoyance occasioned the 
sheep at the time the litter is removed. There are others, how- 
ever, who insist that the sheep barn should be cleaned out just 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
  438 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
previous to lambing time. The work should be done rapidly so 
as to annoy the sheep as little as possible. After the manure 
has been removed it is a good plan to scatter some air-slaked 
lime over the floor. This serves as disinfectant and deodorizer. 
Fresh bedding may then be put down, and the barn will be 
clean and pure for the advent of the lamb crop. 
The sheep lot. — If possible, the sheep should at all times, 
except in the very severest of winter weather, have free access 
to a small lot. If this is dry and a part well bedded, the sheep 
will spend much of their time outside and will be much benefited 
thereby. Above all things the lot should not be muddy. 
Where sheep are allowed to wallow in the mud, trouble from” 
foot-scald is likely to result; particularly is this true if there is 
much sheep manure mixed in the mud. Foot-scald is usually 
known as foot-rot. This disease is hard to eradicate. The 
sheep lot is very much easier kept free from mud than the fat 
steer lot, and it will pay the sheep owner well to take ample 
precautions. 
A straw stack in the sheep lot has many advantages, such as 
keeping the sheep out of the wind, providing them a clean place 
to lie; and they will eat of the straw to some extent. It has the 
disadvantage, however, that the chaff gets in the wool, and for 
this reason is objected to by many good sheep owners. Yet ewes 
and lambs delight in lying alongside such a stack, and they will 
be found there more often than in the barn, except in very severe 
weather.

CHAPTER XX 
DISEASES OF SHEEP 
Tue common diseases of sheep are not numerous, but they 
are mostly incurable. This is particularly true of the ravages 
of internal parasites. Prevention is better than cure. There 
seems to be no good reason why nearly every contagious and 
infectious disease to which sheep are subject cannot be eradi- 
cated in two or three years with proper precautions, yet these 
diseases result in nine-tenths of the failures in this country. It 
seems that farmers cannot realize that diseases so easy to prevent 
will work such destruction once they break out in the flock. In 
this Manual much has been made of the importance of dipping 
all sheep immediately upon their arrival at the farm and thus 
preventing an outbreak of any kind of external parasites; also 
of the absolute importance of frequent changes in pastures, es- 
pecially with the lambs, in order to prevent internal parasites. 
In addition, there are the hygienic conditions, such as proper 
shelter and dry lots, that must receive careful attention. 
TREATING SICK SHEEP 
Sick sheep should be removed from the flock at once, not only 
that they may receive extra care and attention, but to prevent a 
spread of the ailment in case the disease should prove contagious. 
The sick animal should be removed to comfortable quarters and 
given the benefit of good care, for in many cases good care is 
to be preferred to medicine. The food should be given careful 
consideration. The general management, the food, and the 
methods of administrating medicine should be much the same 
439
-P-A-G-E-468
  440 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
as suggested on page 161, modified to meet the attendant con- 
ditions. 
For convenience in discussing the common diseases of sheep, 
we may divide them into four classes: those due to external 
parasites, as scab, foot-rot, sore eyes, sore teats, tick, lice, and 
the like; second, those due to internal parasites, as stomach- 
worms, tape-worms, and the like; third, derangement of di- 
gestion, due to improper feeding; and fourth, other diseases, 
as caked udder, garget, catarrh, and the like. : 
EXTERNAL PARASITES 
The cure for external parasites is dipping. When done as sug- 
gested in pages 423 to 427, it will completely eradicate such 
parasites as ticks and lice as well as the pests that cause scab, 
foot-rot, sore eyes, and sore teats. The prevention of any of 
these parasites is a very simple matter. 
INTERNAL PARASITES 
Treating internal parasites is much more difficult. In many 
cases the parasites are located where medicine cannot reach 
them, as in the brain or liver; and even when located where 
medicine can reach them, as in the stomach, the medicine is of 
very little value as it is so diluted with digestive juices by the 
time it reaches the worms. The only practical treatment is 
prevention. This involves some trouble, and in order to make 
the necessity for such clear, we will consider a case in detail. 
Of course, dipping is of no avail for the internal parasites. 
The stomach-worm. — This worm (Strongylus contortus) is a 
small, thread-like worm about three-fourths of an inch in length. 
It lives in the fourth stomach, and especially afflicts lambs, at- 
tacking them at any age after they begin to nibble grass until 
cold weather in the fall. This stomach-worm is by far the most 
destructive of parasites, doing more damage than all others 
combined. When the fourth stomach of the lamb becomes filled

with these small worms, digestion is greatly interfered with, the 
lamb looks dejected, the skin loses its pink color, the wool appears 
  Fig. 154.—Corswotp Ram. Owned by F. W. Harding, Waukesha, Wis. 
The Cotswold, a native of England, is noted for the production of both mutton 
and wool. The animals are rather large, rams averaging 250 pounds and the 
ewes over 200 pounds. The breed is noted for the production of very long 
wool of fine quality. The wool averages 10 to 14 inches in length and 6 to 10 
pounds in weight. This breed is extremely popular in the United States,
-P-A-G-E-470
    
442 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
dead, and the animal takes on a starved appearance. Scour- 
ing is more or less frequent. The best evidence, however, that 
the lamb is afflicted with stomach-worms is the presence of the 
small worms in the droppings. Older sheep also become affected, 
but seem to withstand the ravages of the worms better than 
lambs, due no doubt, in the lambs, to the more tender condition 
of the stomach wall and to the milk diet. 
The life history of these small worms seems to be simple and to 
furnish a clew to the means of prevention in lambs. The worms 
become mature in the body of the older sheep and, laden with 
eggs about to hatch, pass out with the excreta. Just what the 
worms do outside the sheep’s body is not known. When it is 
moist and warm, in some way the worms find their way into the 
lamb’s stomach. Perhaps the small worm is taken in while 
eating, perhaps by drinking surface water. We know that 
warmth and moisture are necessary for the transfer, hence 
there is little danger in the North, on mountain uplands, and but 
little danger in the dry regions of the West. The method of 
prevention is to remove the lambs and place them on fresh or 
preferably sown pastures before there is danger of infection. 
Lambs receiving no other food than grass and the dam’s milk are 
much more likely to be attacked than those fed grain in addition, 
particularly if the grain contains linseed-oil meal. The only 
safe way, however, is to remove the lambs to new pastures before 
infection. 
In case lambs become infected, treatment should be resorted 
te, though many practical sheep owners state that the treatment 
at best is not satisfactory. Circular No. 35, the United States 
Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Industry, reports 
that satisfactory results were obtained from the use of coal-tar, 
creosote, thymol, and gasolene. The following is taken from

goats, and cattle for the twisted wireworm (Strongylus contortus) 
has been obtained with a 1 per cent solution of coal-tar creo- 
sote. The medicine is easily prepared and inexpensive. It may 
be purchased of a druggist in small quantities of 1 ounce, or in 
pound bottles. One ounce is sufficient for about 20 adult sheep, 
and the cost of the treatments less than one-half acent per head. 
If creosote is called for at the drug store, beechwood creosote 
will be usually dispensed. This is more expensive than the coal- 
tar creosote and not so satisfactory in expelling worms. 
A 1 per cent solution of coal-tar creosote is made as follows : — 
Coal-tar creosote. : ‘ + 1 ounce 
Water . . 99 ounces 
99 ounces =6 pints and 3 ounces 
Twisted wireworms taken directly from the stomach of sheep 
or cattle die in one-half to one and a half minutes when immersed 
in this solution. 
If, in drenching, this liquid enters the lungs, the animal may 
succumb in a few minutes. If the dosing is performed carefully, 
as much as 6% ounces may be given to a full-grown sheep with- 
out fatal results. In some cases, however, the animal shows ill 
effects, from which it usually recovers within half an hour. Six 
ounces were given to a number of sheep without the slightest ill 
effects. The following table gives the doses of the 1 per cent 
mixture which were used in about 400 cases without ill effects : — 
Lambs 4 to 12 months old . . . 2 to 4 ounces (about 60 to 120 c.c.) 
Yearling sheep and above . . . 3 to5 ounces (about 90 to 150 c.c.) 
Calves 3 to8 months old . . . 5tol0ounces (about 150 to300c.c.) 
Yearling steers . . . . 1 pint (about 480 e.c.) 
Two-year-old cattle and over . . IL quart (about 960 e.c.) 
Sheep, goats, and calves which received this treatment showed 
a marked improvement a few days after receiving a single dose. 
If an overdose is given by mistake, and if the sheep appears 
severely affected by it, the animal should be placed in the shade. 
Even in some cases of very severe overdoses, where the animal is 
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  444 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
given up for dead practically, it may entirely recover in an hour 
or so. 
Coal-tar Creosote and Thymol.—TIf, in addition to the 
stomach-worms, the animals are suffering from a severe infection 
of bowel worms, such as the hook worms, better results are ob- 
tained in the treatment when powdered thymol is added to the 
creosote. In cases of this kind, the creosote solution is prepared, 
as already directed, and 30 to 80 or even 100 grains of thymol 
added to each dose after it has been measured, giving 30 grains 
to lambs, 50 to yearlings, and 70 to 100 grains to older sheep, 
according to size. 
The tape-worms. — The digestive tract of sheep is occasionally 
infested with tape-worms. There are several kinds of tape- 
worms, but only two infesting sheep in this country. The 
common one (Tenia expansa) varies in length from ten to 
twenty feet and in breadth from one twenty-fifth of an inch 
at the head to one-half an inch at the tail. The life history 
is somewhat similar to that of the stomach-worm. Sheep 
become infested in the same way, the most common source 
being old infested sheep pastures and the most susceptible 
animals being those rather run down in flesh. 
The best method of combating tape-worms is prevention by 
changing from one pasture to another and by the use of sown 
pastures, as suggested in the discussion on summer care of the 
flock (page 382). Wing recommends liberal feeding of pumpkins 
in the fall. Pumpkin seeds are well-known vermifuges. By 
the frequent use of sown pastures and the feeding of pump- 
kins almost every fall he reports entire freedom from this 
disease. Tape-worms are easily prevented but very difficult 
of eradication. 
In case the sheep are affected with tape-worm, treatment 
should be given, though the results will depend in a large meas- 
ure upon the degree of infection. From Bulletin No. 19 and 
Circular No. 35, Bureau of Animal Industry, we take the fol-

lowing: Dissolve one ounce of copper sulfate in two quarts of 
boiling water. Use only copper sulfate of a uniform blue color. 
Avoid that which is in conglomerate lumps with white patches 
and covered with a white crust. The owner is cautioned against 
guessing at the weights and measures, for this is likely to result 
in too strong a solution, which will kill the animal, or in too 
weak a solution, which will fail to be effective. Prepare the 
animals for treatment by fasting from twenty to twenty-four 
hours. The dose is as follows : —

The medicine is given in the form of a drench as suggested for 
stomach-worms. If, after dosing, any of the sheep seem to be 
suffering from an overdose, indi- 
cated by lying apart from the 
flock, not feeding, manifesting a 
painful, excited look, and a 
spasmodic movement in run- 
ning, walking with a stiff gait, 
or purging with a dirty brown

mal from the flock to a shady 
place and dose with laudanum and

of laudanum in a tumbler of 
milk. Repeat half the dose in two or three hours if necessary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-474
446 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
After treating, the sheep should not be allowed water for 
several hours. 
Each animal in the flock should be treated at the same time. 
While some sheep may be able to withstand the presence of the 
parasite, they serve as a source of infection. While the tape- 
worms are being voided, the flock should be confined to one place, 
and the droppings with the segments of worms destroyed. 
DIGESTIVE DISORDERS 
Among sheep, digestive disorders arising from overfeeding, 
from irregular feeding, and the feeding of food too dry and woody, 
are of rather common occurrence. First of all, however, we will 
consider bloating, as it may be of frequent occurrence, unless 
extra care is taken, when turning to clover, alfalfa, and rape 
pasture. 
Bloating. — When bloat occurs among sheep, treatment to be 
of any avail must be prompt, as the gas generated often causes 
death from suffocation in a very few minutes. If the animal is 
in much distress when found, the paunch should be punctured 
where the distension is greatest, in order that the gas may escape. 
For this a trocar and canula is best, but in the absence a long- 
bladed pen knife will serve. After relief has been had, disin- 
fect the wound. If there was not sufficient time to remove the 
wool from the spot before the puncture, it should be removed 
now and a little pine tar applied to repel the flies. (See page 
351.) 
If the bloating is not so severe, relief may be obtained by tying 
astick or corn cob in the mouth similar to a bit, thus holding the 
mouth open, and the sheep, in rubbing the cob or stick with the 
tongue, often struggles in such a way as to prevent further bloat- 
ing. If the sheep are noticed when first distressed, give them 
three tablespoonfuls of raw linseed oil to which has been added a 
teaspoonful of turpentine. Slowly pouring cold water over the
-P-A-G-E-475
  
DISEASES OF SHEEP 447 
distended paunch often gives relief by stopping the accumulation 
of gas. 
Constipation. — In winter when, the ration is composed largely 
of dry woody food, sheep often suffer from impaction, which 
often leads to constipation and in some instances to inflamma- 
tion of the bowels. This condition of the digestive tract ma- 
terially weakens the animal, and it becomes susceptible to 
various ailments. All tendencies to impaction, constipation, 
inflammation, and the like should be avoided by feeding daily 
some laxative food, such as roots, silage, oil meal ‘pea size,” 
along with the dry food. If sheep growing is to prove profit- 
able, some such foods must be used. 
When impaction occurs, it may be relieved by giving Epsom 
salts. The size of the dose should vary somewhat according to 
the size of the animal ; a 150-pound animal may be given from 4 
to 6 ounces dissolved in a pint of hot water. If not relieved 
within 10 hours, repeat the dose. 
Disorders caused by overfeeding. — As indicated in the discus- 
sion on feeding lambs in winter (page 399), digestive disorders due 
to overfeeding are likely to prove fatal. Occasionally fatalities 
will occur from this cause on the best regulated farms. Many 
remedies have been suggested to relieve such disorders, but they 
fail. Death is almost sure to follow, no matter what may be 
done. In fact, among sheep suffering from apoplexy, the result 
of overfeeding, little time will be given to do anything. The 
lambs die in a few minutes. This sometimes can be impressed 
only by experience. The lambs will seemingly be in the best of 
condition, when, for some reason, one gets an overfeed, and fatal 
results rapidly follow. It is usually the largest and strongest 
lambs that are attacked, as they are the ones likely to crowd the 
smaller ones away and consume too much feed. The ration, 
particularly the grain, should be increased very slowly. While 
it is very important that the sheep be fed all they will consume, it 
is even more important that they be not fed more than they will 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  448 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
clean up from meal to meal, as this is likely to result in one or 
more of them overeating. 
While water, salt, and succulent food of some kind are neces- 
sary to the well being of sheep, care must be exercised in feeding 
them, as otherwise they are likely to produce kidney and bladder 
troubles. Drinking too much hard water, the result of eating 
large quantities of salt, causes the deposit of limy substance in 
the bladder, which becomes washed into the urethra, where 
it lodges, causing stoppage of the urine, inflammation, followed 
by distention of the bladder, which after a time results in death. 
The long-continued feeding of too many mangels, rich in lime, 
is likely to give similar results. 
OTHER DISEASES 
Caked udder. — This trouble often occurs among heavy milk- 
ers. In most cases it is due to neglect at lambing time. The 
udder becomes greatly distended, inflamed, and swollen. The 
treatment is to relieve the congestion by drawing the milk, fre- 
quently. Bathe the parts with hot water and apply camphor 
ointment, as in caked udder among dairy cattle. Some 
prefer an ointment made of lard and turpentine, equal parts. 
The ointment should be well rubbed in and applied three 
times daily. 
Garget often proves serious in certain localities. It is said 
to be due to mechanical injuries, such as a blow, a scratch, or the 
udder being horned ; to the udder becoming distended with milk; 
and to germs entering the udder. The udder becomes hard, 
distended, and the milk is often watery and may contain 
blood. The treatment usually recommended is the hot water 
bathing and the camphor-belladonna ointment treatment, as 
suggested for cows (page 340). 
Among sheep, however, garget seems to be due to other causes 
as well, and when such is the case, the above treatment often fails 
of relief. A typical case is somewhat as follows: A strong ewe

The native home of the Lincoln breed of sheep is in the county of Lincoln, in 
England. This breed is particularly noted for its large size and great length 
of fleece. In weight the rams average about 300 pounds and the ewes 
275 pounds. The wool often attains a length of 18 to 20 inches, and at 
shearing time gives a fleece weighing 10 to 12 pounds, for the ewes, and 12 to 
20 pounds, for the rams.

few days milk secretion stops, the sheep has fever, the flesh of the 
udder is red, and on pressure is dented with the hand. The sheep 
seems in great distress and may soon die. If she lives, the udder

never regains its consistency and after a time sloughs off, leaving 
a slow healing sore. In such cases, physicking the animal and 
treating the udder are of no avail. There seems to be a relation 
between the disease and the food supply. The grain part of the 
ration seems to have been increased too rapidly immediately 
after lambing. When the grain ration was increased more 
slowly and when it contained oats and linseed meal, no such diffi- 
culty was experienced. From this it would seem that the treat- 
ment should be prevention by increasing the grain ration slowly 
after lambing.

CHAPTER XXI 
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SWINE 
Swine are grown for a single purpose, that of pork pro- 
duction; yet the successful swine breeder will give the selection 
of his animals much serious consideration. In choosing swine, 
as in all classes of meat animals, the butcher’s preference must 
be the leading guide. The butcher’s preference is determined 
by the demands of the market. Uniformity in size and quality 
is the most urgent demand. 
TYPES OF SWINE 
There are two distinct types of swine: the lard type, noted 
for the production of thick fat; and the bacon type, known 
for the production of bacon. 
The lard type far outnumbers the bacon type in America. As 
a type, the lard-hog has reached its highest development in the 
corn-belt of the United States. This is often called the American 
type of hog, and is not looked upon with favor by people of other 
countries because of its extreme fat development. 
The lard-hog should be compact, with the body very wide 
and deep. The shoulders should be full although not coarse, 
with the hind-quarters or hams carried out straight to the tail- 
head and well fleshed down to the hock. Since the valuable cuts 
lie along the back, rump and quarters, the general conformation, 
of the lard-hog should be similar to that of the fat steer. The 
flesh covering should be thick and evenly distributed throughout 
the body, particularly over the shoulders and quarters. The size
-P-A-G-E-482
  454 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS " 
and weight are determined largely by the market conditions. 
Formerly very heavy hogs were in demand, but at the present 
time pigs weighing from 225 to 250 pounds will command the 
highest price, all other conditions being equal. 
The true bacon type of hog is little grown in the United States. 
Denmark, Great Britain, and Canada furnish most of this class 
of pork. In recent years the American breeders, particularly 
those east of the corn-belt, have given this class of swine some 
active consideration, but its production is not likely to make 
much headway in America. We prefer the rapid-fattening, 
heavily fleshed, and early-maturing lard type. In contrasting 
the general appearance of the bacon type with the lard type, we 
note that the body of the former lacks the width of the latter, 
the shoulders and hams are lighter and longer, the body is some- 
what longer, and the animal stands on somewhat longer legs. 
The weight of the bacon hog is not so great as of the lard type, 
American markets preferring 155 to 195 pounds and the Danish 
markets 160 to 220 pounds. 
Because of the extreme difference in type we will consider 
the desirable features of the lard- or fat-hog first and then con- 
trast with it the bacon type, first pausing to discuss the age.    
     
  AGE OF SWINE 
In choosing other classes of farm animals age enters largely 
into the choice, but in market hogs it is seldom considered except 
in the case of old sows and stags. The weight and condition of 
the animal determine the value. As in other farm animals, the 
age is indicated to acertain extent by the teeth, but the difficulty 
of catching, holding, and examining is so great that the teeth are 
seldom, if ever, used to determine the age of swine. Among 
breeding stock the matter of age is of considerable importance, 
but even here it is estimated more by a general examination than 
by any specific character. The older the boar the coarser and 
heavier the “shields” — outside of shoulder — and the longer
-P-A-G-E-483
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SWINE 455 
or larger the tusks as well as the larger and more wrinkled the 
body throughout. The older the sow the more pendulent the 
belly, the coarser and more wrinkled she becomes. 
CHOOSING LARD-HOGS 
The lard- or fat-hog is desired for full shoulders and heavy 
hams. These points must be kept clearly in mind. The 
  Fie. 157.— Pouanp Curna YeAruine Boar. First prize, Wisconsin State

The Poland China breed of swine originated in Warren and Butler counties in 
southwestern Ohio. The breed is noted particularly for its early maturing 
qualities and for the ability to take on fat economically. This breed repre- 
sents the extreme development in lard production, and because of this it lacks 
in fecundity and prolificacy. In size the breed is classed as a middle-weight. 
The color is black with white markings, the ears drooping, and face straight. 
The breed is very popular in America. 
sides and especially the belly produce a cheap grade of meat, 
and there should be a minimum of these parts with maxi- 
mum loin, rump, and quarters. In choosing lard-hogs, or any 
other for that matter, the most convenient and simplest method
-P-A-G-E-484
  456 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
is to note the general appearance first, then pass to a more 
detailed examination. 
General appearance of lard-hogs 
By carefully noting the general appearance of a hog one can 
gain a fair knowledge of its value. Carefully view the hog or 
the drove of hogs from a distance before moving up closely to 
the animals. This gives one a good knowledge of their uniform- 
ity, temperament, and their general form. The butcher will 
base his estimate of their value largely on the uniformity and 
form, and the feeder will base his estimate mostly on their tem- 
perament, as a mild-tempered pig is likely to be a good feeder. 
Such an examination will give one a good idea of the weight, 
quality, and constitution, all very important factors in swine 
growing. 
The general form of the fat-hog is of primary importance. 
It should be compact, with the body deep, broad, smooth, and 
symmetrical. The length should be medium, as a too long 
back is likely to result in weakness just back of the shoulders. 
As with the steer, the hog should have the larger part of its 
weight in the region of the most valuable cuts; that is, along 
the back, loin, and hams. While the fore-quarters, neck, and 
head are parts of lesser value, they must show much develop- 
ment in order to insure constitutional vigor and vitality, which 
is largely controlled by chest capacity. The chest, therefore, 
should be broad, deep, and carried well forward. This develop- 
ment gives the hog a parallelogram development similar to that 
desired for beef cattle. 
The weight and condition. — The weight will depend largely 
on the condition, and as these determine the market value 
they will be considered together. Formerly heavy hogs, those 
weighing from 400 to 500 pounds, commanded the highest price, 
but at the present time the market demands a much lighter 
hog. While market demands are exceedingly variable, in
-P-A-G-E-485
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SWINE 457 
general the most desirable weight is from 180 to 275 pounds, 
though heavier hogs sometimes command a premium on the 
market. Very heavy hogs are often spoken of as “fat backs” 
because of their broad, heavily fleshed backs. <A lard pig in 
good condition should weigh from 175 to 200 pounds when six 
months old, and 350 to 400 pounds when one year old. Some 
hogs under the best of conditions may weigh much more, many 
others will weigh much less, but those are the weights one can 
reasonably hope to attain. 
Quality. — The indications of quality are fine hair, freedom 
from bristles, and a comparatively light, dense, and clean bone. 
Fineness of the parts in general is an evidence of quality. This 
is often overdrawn, as too 
much fineness leads to delicacy, 
which is sometimes observed in 
the hogs being too small, facial 
features too fine or small, and 
the bone fine to the point of 
weakness. On the other hand, [E gia 
hogs with coarse bone, coarse Fic. 158.— Poranp Crna Boar. 
hair, and coarse hide are likely So 
to be poor feeders, and the butcher objects to them because 
of the large percentage of offal which they dress. The qual- 
ity of bone, hide, and hair should lie between these two 
extremes. In addition to being rather fine and free from 
bristles, the hair should lie close to the body and the skin be 
free from wrinkles and undue roughness caused by scurf. 
Constitution. — The indications of a good constitution and 
much vigor are a deep, broad, and well-advanced chest, thus 
giving capacious chest capacity and good heart girth. The 
chest should be deep from the top of the shoulder to the brisket, 
which should be placed low down; it should be wide, as indi- 
cated by much width between the front legs, and the brisket 
should be well advanced between the front legs. The real 
 
-P-A-G-E-486
  
458 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
width of the chest is often difficult to estimate, as the external 
width depends much on the thickness and the way the shoulders 
are attached; thus an animal wide from shoulder to shoulder 
might have a small chest capacity, which would not leave suffi- 
cient room for the organs to do their work as they should. 
The flank, both front and rear, should be full and well let down, 
as this also indicates good constitution. 
Uniformity. — One of the most important general considera- 
tions in choosing a herd of swine, either for breeding or feeding, 
is the uniformity. While this adds nothing to their ability to 
make economic gains, it does add materially to their selling value. 
This is one of the most neglected factors in American pork pro- 
duction. The first thing the commission merchant does on re- 
ceiving a mixed drove of hogs is to separate them into bunches 
uniform in all important characters, as age, weight, and con- 
dition. The butcher will very often pass by a mixed drove of 
hogs, even though they are of good quality and in good flesh, 
refusing to place a bid on them merely because he lacks the 
facilities for handling such mixed lots. Separate them into uni- 
form droves, and he is attracted to them at once and will pay an 
extra premium for the same stuff he refused to bid on 
before. 
Uniformity in color is perhaps not so essential as age, weight, 
and quality, although a drove alike in color will command a 
better price than mixed droves. White is not considered well 
adapted to southern conditions, as it is likely to sun-scald or 
blister, and this introduces skin diseases of various forms. For- 
merly, by far the larger part of the hogs sent to the market 
were black, but recently blacks have been decreasing and reds 
increasing, with the whites remaining practically stationary. 
From information gathered from the ten largest packing houses 
in the United States, the color ran as follows: black, 55 per 
cent; red, 35 per cent; white, 10 per cent; all others, 5 
per cent.
-P-A-G-E-487
  
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SWINE 459 
Detail characters of the lard-hog 
Since the individuals are small and the drove often composed 
of a large number, the beginner is likely to neglect the detail 
examination, with the result that many poor individuals find 
their way into the beginner’s herd. Individuality among swine 
is just as great as among fat cattle. The breeder or feeder in 
choosing his swine should carefully observe each character, and 
in order that none go unnoticed they may be considered in the 
following order : — 
The head should be short and broad. No facial character 
among any class of farm animals is more variable than the hog’s 
snout. In some breeds, notably the Tamworths and Hamp- 
shires, the snout is very long and straight from the ears to the 
tip of the nose; in other breeds, as the Yorkshires, it is long and 
dished ; while in others it is short and straight, as in the Poland 
China; and in still others it is short and very much dished, as 
in the Berkshires. The eyes should be wide apart, clear, and 
prominent. Folds of fat about the eyes, while rather common, 
are very objectionable. In heavy fat-hogs these patches of 
fat are often so prominent as entirely to close the eye. The 
ears should be of medium size for the breed and fine in texture. 
The way the ear is carried depends on the breed, being erect 
in the Berkshire and Yorkshire; half drooping in others, as the 
Poland China and Duroc Jerseys; and wholly pendent in still 
others, as the Chester White breed. Whatever the carriage, 
ears should be neatly attached to the head. Large and coarse 
ears are usually associated with heavy coarse bone and are, 
therefore, objectionable on any breed. 
The jowls should be firm, smooth, of medium size, and not 
pendulous. Jowls that are flabby, owing to the excessive amount 
of fat, are very objectionable. They should be firm, indicating 
an intermixture of lean meat. The size of the jowls is rather 
a breed characteristic, being rather large in the Poland China  
-P-A-G-E-488
  460 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and Berkshire, and rather small in the Tamworths and Hamp- 
shires. The statement is often made that large jowls indicate 
great feeding capacity. This is not true, as Tamworths and 
Hampshires feed as well as Poland Chinas or Berkshires. The 
medium-sized jowls for the breed are to be preferred. They 
should be free from heavy folds and not pendulous and loose.

The native home of the Berkshire breed of swine is in England. Like Poland 
China, this breed is noted for its early maturity and for its ability quickly to 
attain marketable condition. This breed lacks the extreme fat development 
of the Poland China, and for this reason the quality of the meat excels the 
Poland China. In prolificacy and fecundity the breed ranks fair. In weight 
the animals are classed with the middle-weight breeds. The color is black, 
with white markings, ears erect, and the face dished. The breed is very popu- 
Jar in America. 
The neck should be of medium length and possess sufficient 
width and depth to swell smoothly into the shoulder-vein and 
pass back without any noticeable depression. It should narrow 
toward the nape and join smoothly with the cheeks. It should 
join the head and shoulders smoothly without undue thickness, 
as a neck too thick and too heavy is objectionable because it
-P-A-G-E-489
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SWINE 461 
indicates general coarseness and increases the relative percent- 
age of cheap meat. 
The shoulders should be long, full, and level on top. They 
should be long, extending down even with the underline of the 
body. While long shoulders are not necessarily correlated with 
a deep chest or constitutional vigor, they give the hog a more 
symmetrical appearance. They should be full, especially at 
the lower end, which is often a weak point, and just forward of 
the shoulders in the region known as the shoulder-vein. The 
shoulders should not be too heavy, as it is a comparatively 
cheap cut, nor should the skin be too thick and heavy, as such 
indicates reversion to ancestral types, because these parts were 
abnormally developed in the wild hog as a protection in fighting. 
The back and loin should be of moderate length, straight, 
broad, and evenly fleshed throughout. They should be very 
carefully considered, as the back and loin furnish some of the 
most valuable cuts. Here pork chop and pork roasts are se- 
cured. The back should be strong, and this can best be ob- 
tained by moderate length, as a too long back is likely to be 
weak, particularly just back of the shoulders. It should be 
straight or, better still, slightly arched, gradually rising from 
the neck to the center of the back, and from there sloping very 
gradually to the tail. There certainly should be no depression 
or sway in the back from the shoulder to the tail. The back 
should be broad, and this breadth should be evenly maintained 
from the shoulder to the tail. It should be as broad on the 
rear as it is in front. Tapering towards the rear —that is, 
narrower across the loin and rump than across the shoulders — 
is objectionable. The flesh covering should be even and firm, 
giving a smooth carcass when slaughtered. 
The sides should be as long as possible and yet maintain suf- 
ficient strength of back, which is best accomplished by medium 
length. They should be deep and thick. The ribs should be 
well arched and continue low down, giving great feeding

capacity. The underline should run straight from front flank 
to rear flank, giving the side an even width throughout its 
entire length. Sides should be firm and smooth, and free from 
wrinkles and flabbiness. Wrinkles and creases, particularly 
just back of the shoulders, are of common occurrence and are 
usually objectionable, as they indicate uneven fattening and 
poor quality of flesh. While the development of the shoulders 
and hams is usually much greater than the sides, thus leaving 
a marked depression just back of the shoulder and in front of 
the hams, this should not be; the sides should be even with the 
hams and shoulders and carry the fullness well down, giving 
the animal a symmetrical and well-balanced appearance. 
The belly should be low, giving the side good depth and in- 
dicating great feeding capacity; it should be straight from fore 
to rear, giving an even cut to the sides, and it should be firm 
and smooth, as wrinkles indicate lack of lean and general flab- 
biness. The width of the belly should be in proportion to the 
hog in general. A very narrow belly is objectionable. 
The hips should be as wide as the body in general and smoothly 
covered with flesh. Narrow hips are very objectionable, as this 
is the region of valuable meat. The hips should be so smoothly 
covered that their location is not apparent to the eye. It is 
commonly held that the hips should be rather low, as a very 
high hip is not likely to be well covered. 
The rump should be long, wide, and fairly level. It should 
be long so as to increase the length of the ham. The width 
should be carried back proportionately with the back, as a 
peaked rump is very objectionable. Narrow, peaked rumps 
mean thin hams, which do not sell well on the market. As 
a rule hogs droop considerably from the hips to the tail; never- 
theless the nearer the rump approaches the level, the better 
the cuts of meat will be; for this reason extremely drooping 
rumps are to be avoided. The rump should be evenly and 
smoothly fleshed from hips to tail.
-P-A-G-E-491
CHOOSING AND JUDGING SWINE 463 
The hams should be wide,,deep, and plump. Viewing the pig 
from behind, the hams should be wide from between the legs 
to the outside; viewing from 
the side, they should be deep, 
that is, long from the tail down- 
ward and fleshed well down to 
the hock. Such a conformation 
will give a long, wide, and 
plump ham when slaughtered. 
Often the hams lack fleshing 
above the hocks, the region be- F1¢. 160.—Cuamrion Berxsuire Pra, 
ing bare and thin, which results 
in a poor ham when slaughtered. The flesh should be firm, 
indicating that there is not too much fat, as very fat hams 
are not desired on the market. Extra fat hams sell at low 
prices. 
The legs should be straight, strong, tapering, and well placed. 
Knees that are considerably bent, or ‘‘bucked knees,” and 
hocks that are very much cramped, are common defects among 
swine. Crooked knees, those which come too close together, 
and hocks too close, are all too common. Another very serious 
objection, particularly among fat-hogs, is the tendency of their 
pasterns to break down, leaving the animal to walk on the dew- 
claws. Although common, and often among the very best bred 
hogs, this is very serious and always to be guarded against. 
Sometimes the underline slants upward from the front to the 
hind flank, due to the hind legs being longer than the fore legs. 
This should not be. 
The legs should be short, strong, and placed wide apart, and 
when the hog walks, the hind and fore legs should pass forward 
in a straight line. Although inward and outward movements 
of the legs are common, they are objectionable and account for 
the awkward gait of many hogs. This is a common defect 
among well-bred swine.

464 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
CHOOSING BACON-HOGS 
The bacon-hog differs materially from the fat- or lard-hog, 
particularly in type and flesh covering. The bacon type 
originated to meet the demand for lean meat. Excessive fat- 
ness is objectionable in this type and does not bring as high 
price as when the lean and fat are well interspersed, giving the 
meat a marbled appearance. The bacon-hog is extensively 
grown in the Old World and Canada, but has never become 
popular in the United States, although considerable bacon is 
produced in the Eastern States. 
In general appearance, the bacon type differs from the lard 
type in the animals being more upstanding, much longer of 
limb, the bodies considerably longer and not so wide, and the 
hams and shoulders much lighter. The animals lack the heavy 
flesh covering of the lard type. 
Condition. — The flesh is not so thick as on the lard type of 
hog, rarely exceeding one and one-half inches, but it must be 
firm, smooth, and even over all parts. It should be firm, as 
this indicates the presence of lean meat; it should be smooth 
and free from wrinkles and seams, as smoothness indicates even 
fleshing and good quality; and the flesh covering should be 
even over all parts of the body in order that the cuts of bacon 
may be uniform. 
The form should be long, level, and deep. It should be long 
in order to give length to the side cuts; it should be level and 
free from sway back; and it should be deep in order to increase 
the percentage of side meat.. The shoulders and hams should 
be light and the animal of uniform width from the shoulders 
to the hams. Width is not sought, but both length and 
depth are of prime importance. The form should appear 
trim and neat, and the animal be free from all coarseness in 
hair, hide, and bone. 
The shoulders should be smoothly laid-in before, behind, and

on top; compact, indicating quality and firmness; and they 
should be light, lacking the bulge of the lard-hog. The shoul- 
der should fit closely to the body and not show more width on the 
back; it should be free from coarseness; and the fleshing should

The Large Yorkshire or Large White breed of swine developed in England. 
This breed is noted particularly for its bacon qualities. The quality of the 
meat is unexcelled, being well marbled ; that is, the fat and lean are well mixed, 
although the animals are rather late maturing. In size the breed is classed as 
large. The breeding qualities are excellent. The color is white, the ears in- 
clined to droop forward, and the face dished. 
extend well down the legs, indicating muscular development 
and giving a long shoulder cut. 
Sides. — Among bacon-hogs the sides are of prime impor- 
tance, as the choicest bacon comes from this region. It is, 
therefore, essential to have as much as possible of the desired 
weight in this region. The sides should be long, smooth, and 
level. From shoulder to ham should be as long as possible 
without increasing weakness, thus giving long side cuts; they

should be smooth and free from wrinkles and seams; and they 
should be level from shoulders to hips. A swaying back or a 
too pendulous belly are very objectionable. 
Hams. — The rump should be long, and the fleshing should 
be carried well downward toward the hock. Fullness and 
plumpness are not essential, while good length, with smooth 
muscular development, is of prime importance. The fleshing 
should be firm and tapering towards the hock, thus giving a 
neat and trim “gammon,’’ which is a cut very similar to the 
ham.

CHAPTER XXII 
THE FEEDING OF SWINE 
UNLIKE cattle feeding, in which it is the common practice 
for the animals to be bred on cheap land and later shipped to 
the corn-belt to be fattened, swine are largely bred and fed on 
the same farm. The swine feeder must breed and grow his 
own stock. The dangers from hog cholera and other swine 
plagues are too great to make the buying of feeding swine in 
the open market practicable. The breeding herd does not re- 
quire much space, and in addition the sows are very prolific, 
thus making it possible for a comparatively small number of 
sows, maintained on a small 
area, to produce many stock 
hogs. Swine feeding, therefore, 
is inseparable from swine breed- 
ing. 
No farm animal equals the 
hog in turning food quickly into 
marketable meat; and none has 
yielded more profit to the aver- Fic. 162.—Larce Yorxsuren, or 
age American farmer. In health ae Sen OM so uO LaeraL 3 rom Farmers’ Advocate. 
no farm animal is more easily 
cared for than the hog; it requires little shelter and will eat 
almost any article of food placed at its disposal. From this 
it would seem that the hog is the most economical meat pro-. 
ducing animal. This is true during health. The effort should 
be, then, so to feed and manage the herd as to keep it in good 
thrift at all times.

FOOD REQUIREMENTS FOR SWINE 
The food required for a given gain among swine varies with 
the kind of food and the age and weight of animals. Foods 
vary largely in the energy they contain. 
larger the animal the more food required for a given gain. 
Wolff and Lehman, after much experimentation along this line, 
have given us the following standards : — The older and the

THE FEEDING OF SWINE 469 
PREPARING FOOD 
Foods for swine are often prepared by grinding, soaking, 
or cooking. There have been many experiments to deter- 
mine the efficiency of each of these methods. These tests 
zive more or less contradictory results, and it is difficult to 
determine from a perusal of the literature to what extent the 
food is rendered more efficient by such preparation. There 
ean be little doubt, however, but that each of these methods 
increases the efficiency of certain foods under given conditions. 
Grinding feed. — The advisability of grinding feed for swine 
depends much on the kind of food and to some extent on the 
age of the animals. Most of the experiments have been with 
the grinding of corn, and the results have been varying. With 
smaller and harder seeds and grains, such as peas, beans, millet, 
and the like, there is a much better showing in favor of grind- 
ing. The Canadian Central Experimental Farm conducted ex- 
periments which show a saving of 17 per cent in favor of grinding 
these smaller and harder seeds. The same may be true of corn 
when the grain is very hard and dry. 
Grinding some foods increases the palatability and thus favors 
larger consumption. Swine fed ground food in the form of mash 
are not likely to masticate it, but simply swallow it, and in 
case the grain is not ground fine, the coarse particles are not 
so readily or thoroughly digested. In masticating their own 
grain swine will usually reduce it to rather fine particles, par- 
ticularly if fed in the natural state. Thus it would seem that 
if the grain is to be ground, it should be ground fine. 
Soaking the feed.—It is a rather common practice to soak 
whole grains and to wet meals before feeding. Soaking is a less 
expensive process and in many instances may be as good as 
grinding. One rather strong objection to feeding soaked grains, 
especially when the animals are used to eating the grains whole, 
is that they are likely to swallow the grains entire without mas-
-P-A-G-E-498
    
470 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
tication. Soaking or wetting is, however, a very cheap method 
of preparing hard grains for swine, by rendering them more 
palatable and adding succulence. 
Grains should be soaked long enough to make them soft. 
They should not be permitted to sour. While sour food, as 
such, is not injurious to swine, there is risk of feeding it one 
time sour and the next time sweet, as digestive disorders will 
surely follow a changing from one to the other. 
Cooking the feed. — As a general practice, cooking food for 
swine is no longer regarded as profitable. In fact, cooking 
certain foods renders some of the nutrients less digestible. 
Cooking feeds for swine, however, has many advantages, chief 
of which are that it softens small and hard seeds; increases the 
succulence and to some extent the palatability of certain dry 
grains, such as peas and beans; reduces the water content of 
certain other feeds, such as roots and tubers, which contain 
more water than swine can economically use; and renders foods 
more uniformly mixed. Furthermore, cooked foods do not sour 
so readily, and the hard grains or particles of feed become 
thoroughly softened. It is considered best to put a variety 
of foods into the cooker. This serves a double purpose: since 
the small grains usually contain more protein, they form a more 
nearly balanced ration; and they add variety to the ration, and 
thus increase the palatability. 
MAKING UP A RATION 
The ration is ordinarily not given much consideration in 
swine feeding, but at the same time it is of great importance. 
The several factors considered in determining the desirability 
of a ration for other farm animals are of equal importance in 
swine feeding. The dry matter, digestible nutrients, protein, 
palatability, variety, suitability, and cost of foods should be 
carefully considered. 
Feeding capacity among swine.— As with steers, it is desirable
-P-A-G-E-499
  THE FEEDING OF SWINE 471 
to develop capacity while the animals are young. A rather 
bulky ration fed during the early part of the pig’s life will in- 
crease the feeding capacity so that later in life he can consume 
more than would be possible if he received only a concentrated 
ration at first. Furthermore, there is great danger of overfeed- 
ing a pig; and if concentrated foods are used, this danger is 
greatly increased. If once a pig is overfed, he will never con- 
sume as much feed thereafter as he otherwise would. 
Young animals grow much more rapidly than older ones. 
The young pig should be encouraged to consume as much as 
he can use to the best advantage. If the animal is fed too 
small an amount at this time, he not only fails to develop 
capacity, but does not make the most of that period of his life 
when he is the most economical producer. 
Later, as the time approaches for fattening and after the ca- 
pacity has been developed, the animals should be put on a full 
feed of rather concentrated food. This change should be made 
gradually, as swine cannot endure a sudden change without dis- 
orders following. 
Giving swine their feed. — When foods are fed in the form of 
mash, there is always much crowding about the trough, which 
makes it very difficult for the feeder. To avoid this crowding, 
place the trough alongside the fence and parallel to it, so that 
the feeder may approach the trough from the outside and the 
animals from the inside. A very good plan is to hang a panel 
immediately above the trough, suspended from either end of 
the upper side. By placing a latch in the center of the lower 
side of the panel, it may be swung in and fastened to the 
side of the trough in the lot, thus shutting the swine out of the 
trough and giving the feeder an opportunity to put in the feed. 
The panel may now be swung back and fastened to the out- 
side of the trough, giving the swine access to the entire meal at 
once. If there is more than one trough in the lot, the feed 
should be placed in all before any of the panels are swung back.

    Cote POD G AL og, age 
472 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Salt in limited quantities should be kept before the swine at all 
times. A very good plan is to provide a shallow strong box, 
with slats nailed across the top, so the pigs cannot lie in the box, 
then place charcoal and salt in the box. The box should be 
placed under a shed and in a clean place. It is best not to 
place too much before them at a time, but to keep renewing 
the supply often, as this keeps the food clean and sweet. 
Fresh, cool water should be available at all times, even though 
the animals are being fed mash or slops. The trough should 
be so arranged that the hogs cannot lie in the water and thus 
litter up the trough. During the winter, hogs often fail to drink 
a sufficient amount of water and fail to do well simply for this 
reason. To obviate this difficulty, the chill should be driven off 
the water and the supply should be fresh. 
FEEDING THE BREEDING HERD 
Feeding the breeding herd differs so essentially from the fat- 
tening of swine that it is desirable to treat each separately. In 
feeding the herd the object is to keep the animals in a healthy 
and thrifty condition. Flesh formation is to be encouraged and 
fattening discouraged. If the breeding herd is permitted to be- 
come too fat, the animals fail to breed regularly, the litters are 
small, and the dangers from difficult parturition are increased. 
Feeding the breeding herd naturally divides itself into two parts, 
summer and winter feeding. Each of these divisions calls for 
widely different practices. Furthermore, the common practice 
of breeding swine so young makes it necessary to consider feed- 
ing the younger animals separately from the older ones, as the 
young and growing breeding animal calls for very different 
foods from the older and mature ones. 
Feeding the herd in summer 
It is the common practice to confine the breeding herd in 
too crowded quarters. This close confinement and a too exclu-
-P-A-G-E-501
THE FEEDING OF SWINE 473 
sive grain feeding account for much of the shy breeding among 
many of the more prominent breeds. Hogs will live and breed 
under such confinement, but greatest success cannot be attained 
under these systems of management. Another serious mistake 
is the too liberal use of corn. While no food equals corn for 
fattening swine, it is not a good grain for the breeding ani- 
mals, and its too exclusive use is a common cause of barren- 
ness or of small litters. 
  Fig. 163.— Duroc Jersey Boar. First prize, Wisconsin State Fair, 1908. 
The Duroc Jersey breed of swine is a native of the United States. This breed, 
like the Poland China, is noted for its fat production and early maturing 
qualities. The breeding qualities of the breed are considered good, as the sows 
are fairly prolific. In size the breed is classed as medium. The color is red, 
the ears drooping, and face straight. The breed is increasing in popularity 
in America. 
Ample room’ should be provided. Nothing is better than 
pasturing or soiling. Soiling is likely to involve too much labor 
on the average American farm, but in such cases there is usually 
an abundance of pasture. Sometimes hogs are denied the run 
of a pasture because they require a rather tight fence, and if  
-P-A-G-E-502
474 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
not properly ringed are likely to root up the sod. While hog- 
tight fencing is expensive, it must be remembered that greatest 
success cannot be attained without pasture. In most local- 
ities, woven wire will prove the most effective in restraining the 
herd. It need not be high, although all things considered, the 
four-foot fence with a barb-wire on top will be found the most 
practicable. 
With an abundance of pasturage, the breeding herd need 
receive no grain until a short time before farrowing, when grain 
should be fed sparingly in addition to the pasture. The well- 
fed sow will be more quiet at farrowing time and be less likely 
to injure her pigs than will the lean gaunt one lacking in milk. 
When grain is fed, the kind will depend somewhat on the kind 
of pasture; but as a general rule nothing is better than wheat 
bran or middlings, as it is rich in protein and mineral matter, 
two elements much needed by the developing pigs. Further- 
more, bran stimulates the flow of milk, which is very essential 
for the sow with a large litter. 
Ringing to prevent rooting. — Nothing is more natural than 
for swine to root, and if the pastures and meadows are to remain. 
uninjured, the animals must be 
restrained by placing rings in 
their noses. This applies par- 
ticularly on permanent pastures. 
On clover or alfalfa pastures, 
there is not so much danger of 
the sod being injured, as swine

the desire to root up the sod as

plant. The object should be to ring whenever the swine begin 
to injure the pastures. The operation of placing the rings in 
the nose is not difficult, a hog ringer, some rings, and a short

THE FEEDING OF SWINE 475 
rope being all the apparatus that is necessary. Tie a small loop 
in one end of the rope, slip the loop into the animal’s mouth 
and draw the head up. With the ringer pincers, firmly insert 
the rings into the nose, but not too deep, for if set so deep as 
to bind or pinch the muscle inside the ring, they will always be 
an annoyance to the animal. One or, in the case of old brood 
sows, at most, two rings are all that are needed for each animal. 
Pasture for swine. — Swine may be turned to any pasture 
land that is available,—permanent or sown pasture. When 
properly ringed, they are no more injurious to pastures than any 
other farm animal. Swine thrive much better when they have 
access to green forage plants. Since the common pasture plants 
are not available before warm weather, it is often of advantage 
to provide an earlier forage. Rye sown somewhat early in 
the fall makes an excellent substitute for pasture grass, early the 
following spring. Among the permanent pasture grasses, blue- 
grass comes on very early and provides much succulence through- 
out the season. Clover, alfalfa, and cowpeas are unexcelled as 
swine pasture in the regions where they thrive. For a quick 
growing crop, rape is probably to be accorded first place. 
Roots for swine. — Roots are valuable as a food for swine 
during the late fall and winter months. They are mainly 
desired because of their stored succulence and to serve as a sub- 
stitute for pasture. In the United States, roots have not been 
so commonly used as in Canada or the Old Country, though of 
late years they have increased in favor, and their usefulness, 
especially in the corn-belt, is being recognized. Sugar-beets, 
mangels, rutabagas, turnips, and carrots are grown as food for 
swine. Of these, many prefer mangels largely because of their 
high yield per acre, although they will not give as good results 
as sugar-beets. 
The Jerusalem artichoke, a tuber belonging to the sunflower 
family, is often grown as a succulent for swine. This tuber is 
highly esteemed for-fall, winter, and spring use. It is planted  
-P-A-G-E-504
476 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
in much the same way as the potato and grows from the eye 
of the tuber, which may be planted whole, or cut, usually whole 
if planted in the fall and cut if planted in the spring. By re- 
moving the hogs before all the tubers are secured, this crop 
may be grown successively for many years without replanting. 
  Fig. 165.—Curster Wurtte Boar. Photograph by C. 8. Plumb. 
The Chester White breed of swine first became prominent in Chester County, 
Pennsylvania. This breed is noted for its fat production. The breeding 
qualities rank high. It may be regarded asone of the most prolific of the fat- 
producing hogs. In size the breed is classed as the largest of the middle 
weights. The color is white, the ears drooping, and the face straight. 
Many swine breeders and feeders do not grow artichokes 
because of the opinion that when once established they are 
difficult to destroy. This is not true. To destroy the crop, 
let the hogs root out every tuber, then plow and plant to corn 
or some other cultivated crop. 
Pumpkins and squashes are much relished by swine in the late
-P-A-G-E-505
  THE FEEDING OF SWINE ATT 
fall and early winter. The custom of planting the pumpkins 
in the corn results in being able to grow them at almost no ex- 
pense; and their keeping qualities add to their value as a suc- 
culent food for winter feeding. In addition to their succulence 
the seed is very rich in protein; thus they make a very good 
supplement for corn. Pumpkin seeds are a natural vermifuge. 
When many pumpkins are fed, the animals should be watched 
closely to see that they do not get an overfeed of seed and di- 
gestive disorders follow. 
Feeding the herd in winter 
More care must be given the feeding of the herd in winter 
than in summer; although if roots or other succulent food has 
been provided, the matter will be less difficult than if the 
feeder is obliged to rely entirely on dry feeds. The cheapness 
and the great abundance of corn really adds to the difficulty 
of wintering the herd. The great temptation all through the 
corn-belt is to feed a too exclusive corn ration. This difficulty 
is increased by the fact that no food equals corn in the fatten- 
ing of swine; and the majority of swine feeders let the herd run 
with the fattening swine, with the result that the breeding 
herd gets so fat that its breeding powers are materially lessened, 
the sows often become barren, and those that do breed farrow 
small litters of pigs lacking thrift and vigor. 
To avoid such difficulties, the herd must be separated from 
the fattening swine and fed a growing ration rather than a 
fattening ration. The object should be to keep the herd thrifty, 
but not fat. This can best be done by feeding such grains as 
wheat bran, middlings, and the like, also roots, pumpkins, and 
skim-milk for succulence. Alfalfa, clover, or cowpea hay in small 
quantities may be fed with profit. Hayshould be fed from a rack 
and not thrown upon the ground, as the animals will tramp it 
under their feet. When the hay is clean and sweet, and slightly 
salty, the swine will eat it and be much benefited thereby.
-P-A-G-E-506
  478 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
When the grain is fed in the form of meal, better results will 
be secured by mixing with water, or better still skim-milk, and 
fedasa mash. If skim-milk is used, much care should be taken 
not to feed the animals too much, as they will take on flesh 
rapidly and may become too fat. A very good mixture is made 
by using one part meal to five parts of water or skim-milk. 
Another common mistake is confining the herd too closely in 
the winter season. The quarters become very muddy. While 
it is not possible to keep swine from rooting when the ground 
is soft or from wallowing when the weather is warm, they 
should be given sufficient room for exercise, and provided with 
quarters free from mud where they may eat and sleep, although 
the platform on which they feed should be separated from the 
one on which they sleep. 
Feeding the young and old herd. — Since the young animals 
are building bone and flesh for their own bodies, they need a more 
nitrogenous ration than the older animals that have attained 
their growth and need only enough protein to supply the waste. 
While the feeding of the young herd will depend much on the 
age at which the animals are bred, it may be said in a general 
way that the young herd needs a narrower ration than the old 
herd. Thus if the feeder has only sufficient skim-milk for a 
part of the herd, it would prove more profitable to feed the 
young herd the milk in connection with the grain and give 
the old ones water with their other food. In this way the 
younger animals will get the necessary mineral matter. The 
importance of well-chosen nourishment for the young herd 
cannot be overestimated. 
FATTENING SWINE 
Feeding swine for fattening differs essentially from feeding 
the breeding herd. -In fattening, the sole object is the economic 
production of pork. As a rule the animals are forced to the 
limit of their ability as feeders, fattened and marketed under one 
 
-P-A-G-E-507
  
THE FEEDING OF SWINE 479 
year of age. In this respect pork production is somewhat similar 
to beef production. The same general factors apply in both 
cases. Pork production is as much of a business as beef pro- 
duction and should be conducted accordingly. 
Feeding the lard-hog 
If light hogs are to be the product, the fattening process 
will begin much earlier in the life of the animal than if heavy 
hogs are to be produced. If lard-hogs are to be produced, the 
feeds will be much different from those required if bacon is to 
be the product. In the lard-hog, thick fat is desired, while in

the bacon-hog the flesh covering is rather thin and well inter- 
spread; that is, the lean and fat are placed in layers, giving the 
meat a marbled appearance, when cut crossways. In the lard- 
hog, fattening foods are to be fed, while in the bacon-hog flesh- 
ing foods should be used. 
Feeding the lard-hog in summer.— As a rule, swine should be 
fed in comparatively small droves. It is very important that 
the drove be made up of individuals of the same age as well as 
the same size. If a few of the individuals are larger and stronger, 
they will crowd the smaller and weaker ones back and get more 
than their allotment of the food.

Whatever food-stuffs are used, the swine should be put on 
full feed slowly. Much care should be exercised not to throw 
them off their feed in the beginning, as it will take some time for 
animals to recover. For best results swine should never be fed 
more than they will clean up at each meal. Fattening swine 
make better returns for the food consumed when their appetites 
are kept keen; they wait eagerly for their food and relish it 
much better than when overfed. If convenient, they should be 
fed both mash and dry grain. Nothing makes a better food 
for swine in the fore part of the fattening period than meal and 
skim-milk mixed in the proportion of one part of meal to five 
of milk. As the period progresses the portion of meal should 
be gradually increased until towards the close the proportion 
may be one part to three parts of skim-milk. If the skim-milk 
is not available, water may be used to make the mash. If water 
is used, the mash should be fed much thicker, using only enough 
water to mix the meal, as it is useless to fill the fattening animal 
up on water and thus prevent the consumption of nutritious 
foods. When such is the case, some linseed meal should be 
used, say 10 per cent of the meal. In either case, dry grain 
should be fed in addition. 
Swine will make much better returns for the food consumed 
if they have access to green forage. Where fattening hogs are 
turned to pasture, it must be so arranged that they need not 
graze over too large an area. If at all convenient, it will be more 
profitable to cut the green forage and feed to the hogs. In 
this way a smaller area will support a larger number of hogs, and 
the swine need not rustle to get the much needed succulence. 
The number of hogs that may be pastured on an acre will de- 
pend on the age and size of the animals, the quality and kind 
of crop, and other conditions. For an average it may be said 
that an acre of blue-grass will support eight to ten hogs for 
two months or more in the spring, and for two months in the 
fall; red clover should support six to ten hogs for three or four 
 
-P-A-G-E-509
THE FEEDING OF SWINE 481 
months; alfalfa from ten to fifteen for five months; cowpeas 
six to eight for two or three months; and artichokes should 
support from six to ten hogs to the acre for a considerable length 
of time in the late fall. Clover, alfalfa or cowpea pasture is 
to be preferred. Alfalfa in those sections where it will thrive 
is regarded as the leading pasture plant for swine. It should 
not be grazed so closely as to make mowing unnecessary. To 
keep alfalfa in the best condition it should be mowed from one to 
three times in a season. These estimates are to be modified 
according to conditions. 
It is very important that fattening swine be provided with 
shade and an abundance of cool, fresh water. The sebacious 
glands of the hog are very rudimentary, and the animal can- 
not perspire and therefore must keep cool by radiation. This 
is one reason why hogs desire mud wallows, and for best results 
these must be provided, particularly for thick, fat animals, which 
suffer greatly with the heat during the warm summer months. 
To avoid the extreme heat of summer, many swine feeders plan 
to have the animals fat by the first of July, when they are sold. 
Feeding the lard-hog in winter.— When roots or other succu- 
lence is available for winter use, much better results can be 
obtained than if dry feed alone must be depended on. Sugar- 
beets, roots, turnips, potatoes, artichokes, and pumpkins are 
often used. No succulence exceeds skim-milk for winter feed- 
ing. In the absence of any other succulent food, mashes 
should be made, as suggested for summer feeding. For best 
results,mash or succulent food, grain, and a small amount of dry 
forage should be fed. Sweet, clean clover or alfalfa hay should 
constitute the dry forage. It should be fed from a rack. 
Care should be exercised in providing dry quarters and lots 
as free from mud as possible. The warmth of the quarters best 
suited for fattening swine may depend somewhat on the feeds 
used. When corn, in one of its many forms, as ear corn, shelled 
corn, corn meal, and the like, constitutes the major part of the 
21
-P-A-G-E-510
    482 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
ration, the quarters need not be so warm as when an abundance 
of more succulent food is fed, such as skim-milk. It has been 
proved that for best results, when skim-milk or other very suc- 
culent food is freely employed, the quarters should be rather 
warm yet very well ventilated and well lighted. Fattening 
swine are not likely to spend much time in poorly ventilated, 
dark, and foul-smelling quarters. They prefer the cold to

such places, and for this reason swine are often known to build 
a nest or bed out in the open lot, illustrating that they prefer 
exposure to foul quarters. When sweet, well lighted, and well 
ventilated quarters are provided, swine will be found to occupy 
them except when feeding and taking exercise. Hogs are not 
dirty animals by nature, except as they like to wallow in 
warm weather.
-P-A-G-E-511
  
THE FEEDING OF SWINE 483 
During the cold winter season, swine often fail to drink suffi- 
cient water to meet their needs. This often seriously in- 
terferes with their fattening. To avoid this difficulty, they 
should be encouraged to drink water. That contained in 
skim-milk, slop, or other succulence is not sufficient. When it 
is at all possible, the chill should be taken off before the water 
is offered the animals. Swine compelled to eat snow or lick ice 
to get water will surely fail to fatten profitably. The importance 
of this cannot be overestimated, for in addition to not gaining 
rapidly the system becomes weakened and the animals contract 
diseases more readily. 
Feeding the bacon-hog 
In the production of bacon, the foods must differ from those 
used in feeding the fat-hog. In some cases the same food 
stuffs may be used in part, but the mixture must be varied. 
Corn, the mainstay in the production of the fat-hog, can- 
not be used with success in larger proportions than one-third 
of the grain ration. A larger proportion is likely to produce 
an undesirable quality of bacon. The foods very largely used 
are shorts, oats, peas, barley, and skim-milk. Barley is perhaps 
the food most used, especially in Canada, where bacon production 
finds much favor. It is often fed ground or soaked. Usually 
it is fed in connection with small amounts of other food, as peas, 
oil meal, finely ground oats, tankage, and the like. Peas are 
used to a considerable extent in the production of bacon in 
Canada. ‘Canada pea-fed bacon” has good market repu- 
tation. Among some large bacon feeders, however, peas are not 
held in high estimation, the statement being made that they give 
dry, rather hard, and flavorless bacon. Oats are often objected 
to because of their hulls, which contain little nutrition and 
much crude fiber; yet when the price is low, they are extensively 
used. Crushing the oats is considered the best method of 
preparation.
-P-A-G-E-512
  484 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Skim-milk is held in high esteem by the bacon feeder ; 
therefore localities devoted to dairying other than market 
milk are admirably adapted for the production of bacon. It 
may be fed in the same proportion as to the fat-hog, —that is, 
three to five parts milk to one of meal. 
Summer feeding on pasture. — Clover, alfalfa, cowpeas, or 
rape are excellent pastures for bacon production. Less protein- 
rich grain or less skim-milk is required when the swine have 
access to such ranges. No cheaper or more economical gains 
can be obtained than from a light grain ration when the animals 
have these pastures. 
Winter feeding in dry-lot.— Bacon production during the 
winter season is approximately 25 per cent more costly than 
feeding on pasture. For best results, some succulent food 
should be supplied. This may be furnished by growing roots, 
such as sugar-beets, mangels, turnips, and the like, and storing 
them for winter use. When the animals are confined to a dry- 
lot, more protein-rich food is required, which calls for larger 
amounts of oil meal, shorts, tankage, or skim-milk, most of which 
must be purchased. This balancing is very essential in the 
production of bacon, as quality is what commands the extra 
price. The lean and fat must be well interspersed, and this can 
be secured only by properly balancing the ration. 
SAMPLE RATIONS FOR SWINE 
To give sample rations for horses, cattle, and sheep is a com- 
paratively simple matter, but such is not the case with swine. 
The composition and amount of the ration are influenced by 
the age and weight of the animal. For 100 pounds live weight, 
the younger the animal the more food required, and in addition 
it should contain more protein than for the older animal. To 
illustrate the ration for fattening swine of increasing size the 
following data is made up from Bulletin 106 of the Iowa Ex- 
periment Station : —

CHAPTER XXIII 
THE BREEDING OF SWINE 
As previously stated, pork production differs from beef pro- 
duction in the fact that swine are bred and fed on the same 
farm, whereas feeding cattle are frequently bred on the cheap 
lands and shipped to the corn-belt to be fed. Since swine are 
reared and finished in one place, if success is to be attained, the 
feeder must be a breeder as well. Many good swine feeders 
often fail to exercise proper judgment in breeding. Breeding 
swine is as much a business as feeding swine, and should be 
conducted with that understanding. When the price of hogs 
is high, the tendency is to rush into swine raising, forgetting 
the advantages of good quality, with the result that in a few 
months the hog market is glutted with animals of inferior 
quality which, of course, command only a low price. This is 
discouraging, and the enthusiast of a few months quits the 
hog business. With proper management, no line of farming 
will prove more profitable than pork production, especially if 
continued over a long series of years. 
PLAN OF BREEDING 
Before beginning to breed swine, one should decide on a plan. 
Before formulating the plan one will have to decide upon the 
kind of hog he is going to breed. Some will wish to breed market 
hogs only, others breeding hogs only, while still others may wish 
to produce both market and breeding hogs. When market 
hogs only are to be produced, grades may prove as profitable as 
487  
-P-A-G-E-516
    
488 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
pure-bred animals, especially if much care is taken in the pro- 
duction of the grades and a pure-bred boar is used. On the 
other hand, if breeding hogs are to be produced, pure-bred ani- 
mals only can be grown with profit. This calls for much knowl- 
edge of the principles of breeding, such as selection, mating, and 
the like. Another question that will also modify the plan 
is the amount of capital available for the establishment of the 
business. When the capital is small and the experience want- 
ing, the grade herd is to be preferred. The beginner may well 
  Fig. 168.—Cuampion Hampsuire Swine. Bred and owned by John Good-

The Hampshire breed of swine was developed in the United States. Like the 
Poland China, this breed is noted for its early maturing and economic fattening 
qualities. As breeders the sows rank high. In size the breed is classed with 
the middle weights. The color is black, with a white belt about the body. 
The breed is increasing in popularity, and animals of the breed are in much 
demand by the packers. 
start with not more than two or three sows, in pig when pur- 
chased, as he can acquire much valuable experience with even so 
small a number, while his risk will not be great. The second year 
he may add to the number of sows, secure a suitable and pure- 
bred boar, and each succeeding year carefully increase the 
number of sows bred. In this way, one should soon find 
himself in possession of a large herd, and of sufficient knowl- 
edge to put it to profitable use.
-P-A-G-E-517
    
  THE BREEDING OF SWINE 489 
Coéperative breeding. — Pure-bred boars are likely to be 
costly, and to get the most out of them should be kept in con- 
stant use. Since the average farmer does not possess sows 
enough to get the maximum use of the boar, it is often a 
good plan for a number of farmers to codperate in the purchase 
of a boar. Such coédperation not only reduces the cost of service, 
but aids in increasing the uniformity of the animals in a locality. 
Furthermore, when a number of farmers codperate in the pur- 
chase of a hog, a much better animal can be secured than if each 
purchases in his own account. 
SELECTING BREEDING STOCK 
Many practical questions enter into the selection of swine for 
breeding purposes. As a general rule, the animals chosen should 
be rather large for the breed to which they belong. In the past 
few years there has been a tendency to reduce the size of mar- 
ket hogs, and this has extended to the brood sows, with the re- 
sult that many of the sows now used for breeding are decidedly 
too small for the farrowing and raising of two large and strong 
litters of pigs each year. Probably the greatest fault of im- 
proved swine breeding is the striving for too great refinement. 
If large litters of strong pigs are to result, the sows must possess 
much size and length and a good constitution, as shown in suffi- 
cient width and depth of the chest region. 
The type. — A consideration of prime importance in the selec- 
tion of a breed or type is the likes and the dislikes of the breeder. 
One is much more likely to succeed with the animals he likes and 
to fail with other animals of equal merit that he dislikes. Other 
than this there is little to choose, as each breed has its weak and 
strong points. In some sections, however, certain breeds will 
remain the most popular because of their adaptability to the 
climate. Thus in certain parts of the United States, especially 
the West and South, white hogs are not looked on with favor 
because they are more liable to be sun-scalded, to have scurvy
-P-A-G-E-518
  490 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and often mangy skins. Again, in the corn-belt, bacon types 
doubtless will never be most popular because the available food 
is not such as to produce bacon. 
Uniformity. — In selecting animals for the breeding herd it is 
very important that they be similar in age, size, color, condi- 
tion, and quality. The importance of this similarity among 
market swine cannot be overestimated. To get animals that 
will remain uniform, it isessential to know something of the herd 
from which they come. A herd noted for its uniformity is 
likely to produce animals that are uniform. In addition to the 
uniformity, the herd should be prolific. The sows should farrow 
and raise two litters of six or more pigs each year. Prolificacy 
is hereditary. A prolific herd is likely to produce prolific 
animals. 
THE BOAR 
The boar is sire of the pigs from many dams, and his general 
influence, therefore, is much greater than that of any sow can 
possibly be. Therefore, for general improvement the boar 
should be largely relied on, as he can effect change either for good 
or bad much more rapidly than the sows. The boar should be 
the best that the number and quality of the sows or the circum- 
stances of the breeder will permit. The ordinary breeder can- 
not afford an extremely high-priced boar and is compelled to do 
the best he can with the money at his command. This may be 
a blessing in disguise, for it should be the work of the ordinary 
breeder to grow market hogs, and when the boar is used to sire 
market hogs, there is a limit beyond which one cannot go and 
realize a profit from swine breeding. Only the man who is 
breeding show animals can afford to pay a large sum for a boar 
and make a profit on his investment. In any event, however, 
the animal that is chosen should be a pure-bred, for if not 
pure-bred he cannot be depended on to stamp his own 
qualities on his offspring. If the boar should be put to service
-P-A-G-E-519
    
THE BREEDING OF SWINE 491 
too immature, he cannot be expected to get vigorous pigs. 
He should not be used before eight months of age, and it will 
be more profitable in the long run to defer using him until one 
year of age. When once a satisfactory boar is found, he should 
be kept in service as long as he gives satisfaction. When of no 
use as a boar, he should be castrated, and fattened for the 
market. 
THE SOWS 
As suggested for the boar, when at all possible the sows that 
are to form the foundation herd should be chosen on the farm 
where raised. This personal inspection may call for an extra 
outlay in expense, but it will be well worth while, as it enables 
one to know the herd from which they sprang and in this way 
gain an idea as to the kind of offspring that may be expected. 
Furthermore, if the sows are purchased from a successful 
breeder, the beginner can get much information as to the care 
and management of swine. 
The age at which to purchase foundation animals is a much- 
discussed question, many preferring to buy as soon as the pigs 
are weaned, since usually they can be purchased more cheaply, 
others preferring to wait until the animals are bred and to 
purchase sows in pig. Purchasing sows already in pig will save 
to the beginner a considerable outlay at the start, and, all 
things considered, it is perhaps the most desirable time to 
acquire them. 
A good brood sow is a roomy animal, with rather long deep 
body and well-developed pelvic region. The back should be 
strong and well supported, as a weak or sagging back is very 
objectionable in breeding or market swine. There should be 
evidence of thrift and constitutional vigor, as these indicate 
prepotency. A good brood sow will have many of the char- 
acteristics of a good milk cow. She should be motherly, with 
a gentle quiet disposition; she should be a good milker, thus 
 
-P-A-G-E-520
  492 geese OF FARM ANIMALS 
providing much nutrition for her offspring ; and she should be 
prolific in farrowing healthy, quick-growing pigs. She should 
have six or more functional teats on either side. When inspect- 
ing the teats, one should see that there are no blind teats either 
in the front or in the rear. 
Productive period. — On the average farm, sow pigs are bred 
too young. Well-kept sows will often breed as young as three 
months of age. They should not, however, under any con- 
sideration, be bred under six months, eight months being as 
young as it is proper to breed them. Sows bred too young 
will remain not only underdeveloped, but small litters of weak 
pigs will result. There is a rather widespread and growing 
practice of breeding sows at six to eight months of age, rais- 
ing one litter of pigs and then fattening the sows for market. 
This is not good practice, for once a good brood sow is found 
she should be kept as long as she continues to breed true and do 
well. Some sows will remain productive until five or six years 
of age, while others will become clumsy or vicious before that 
time. 
Season to breed. — Throughout the United States the main 
crop of pigs should come in the warm days of March to May, 
and the second crop in September to November. Since the 
period of gestation in sows is approximately 112 days, this 
means that they should be mated in December, January, and 
February for the first crop and in June, July, and August for 
the second crop. As a general rule in the northern states, a 
sow should not be bred so as to farrow her pigs in the spring 
before March, nor later in the fall than October. Both early 
spring litters and those of early fall will pay the best on the 
average, as the care of the pigs in the mild season is not so 
difficult, and such pigs are likely to make larger and more 
economic gain than litters farrowed in the hot days of summer 
or the cold days of winter. 
Method of mating. —As a rule sows come around every three
-P-A-G-E-521
  
THE BREEDING OF SWINE 493 
weeks ; hence if the sow has been mated and for some reason has 
failed to conceive, she should make the fact known in 20 to 21 
days after coupling. <A careful record should be kept of the 
date of mating so that the probable time of farrowing may be 
known. 
Often one wishes to mate a large heavy boar to a small sow 
or a small short-legged boar to a large sow, and to facilitate this

The Cheshire breed of swine originated in New York. The breed is noted for 
occupying a position between the true lard and the true bacon types. It is 
rather slow maturing, but the quality of flesh is unexcelled. The breeding 
qualities are excellent. In size the breed is classed as small. The color is 
white, the ears erect, and the face slightly dished. 
the construction of a breeding-crate will be found extremely 
useful, if not a necessity to insure a successful service. This 
crate is simple, resembling a strong shipping-crate with one 
end out. A very convenient size is 6 feet in length, 2 feet 
4 inches inside width, and 3 feet high. The frame should be 
constructed of 2” X 4’ scantling, closed in front and open
-P-A-G-E-522
  494 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
behind. Through the scantling, on either side of the crate, 
should be bored 14” holes, so that an inch iron bar may be 
slipped behind the sow above the hocks to prevent her from 
backing out of the crate. On the inside, on either side of 
the crate, 2’ x 4” strips should be fastened, placing the front 
end about where the sow’s head comes, and then extending to 
the rear and bottom. These strips are for the boar’s front feet 
to rest upon, thus holding his weight from the sow. When mat- 
ing a small boar to a large sow, a small platform may be con- 
structed and placed in the crate for the boar’s hind feet to rest 
upon; or the sow may be placed in a pit. 
The pregnant sow. — The pregnant sow may be ponmeated to 
run with the herd to within two weeks of farrowing time, 
when she should be separated and given special attention. In 
the case of ill-natured sows, they should receive extra care 
during the entire period in order to familiarize them with the 
herdsman. Brood sows should be trained much as dairy cows. 
During the last two weeks of pregnancy, the sow will need 
less exercise than formerly, but should have the best possible 
attention as to feeding. She should be well nourished up to a 
few days before farrowing, when the feed may be slightly 
reduced. Sows that are well fed before and after farrowing are 
less likely to injure the pigs, as they will usuallylie quiet. This 
does not mean to overfeed, as this will bring troubles at pigging 
time; but it does mean that the sow should not be compelled 
to go far afield to find her food. If at all possible, succulence 
of some kind should be provided; in summer nothing is better 
than clover or alfalfa pasture, and in winter roots may be fed 
with good results. 
If the sow is due to farrow in winter, the quarters should be 
warm, comfortable, well ventilated, protected from dampness, 
and so arranged that they may have plenty of sunlight. The 
floor may be of earth, but should be dry and hard and free from 
dust. The sow’s bedding need not be great in quantity, enough

only to provide a clean and dry nest. Sometimes pigs are lost 
when the nests are too deep. If convenient, the nest should be 
so situated that the sun can warm it during a portion of the day. 
Straw, chaff, leaves, or hay make good nests. When at pasture 
the sow will build her own nest, in which case she gathers grass 
and leaves and provides a very shallow place. When the sow 
is to farrow in the hog-cot or pen, the little pigs may be kept 
from danger of being crushed by the mother by a fender made of 
a pole or scantling securely fastened, say eight inches from the 
floor and the same distance from the wall. The young pigs 
soon learn the protection furnished by this device when the 
mother lies down. 
Farrowing time. — For several hours before farrowing, the 
sow will be very restless and spend much of her time in collect- 
ing material and making it into a nest. At this time the feed 
should be reduced. The signs 
that indicate the near approach 
of parturition are a distended 
udder, an enlarged vulva, and a 
relaxation of the muscles on 
either side of the tail. During 
the summer season the pigs will 
of their own accord usually find 
their way to the teats and begin 
nursing; but in the winter season 
the young pigs often need assistance in finding the teats, other- 
wise they may become chilled and perish. If for any reason the 
pigs become chilled, they should be treated similarly to that sug- 
gested for chilled lambs (see page 414). Occasionally a sow will 
be found that is very nervous and unquiet at farrowing time, 
and it will be nec pe 510 keep the pigs from the teats to prevent 
the youngsters ‘. being crushed. When such is the case 
the pigs should be kept warm, as suggested for lambs. 
When permitted to nurse, care should be taken to see that the

  THE BREEDING OF SWINE 497 
young ones do not overfeed and that each pig receives its share. 
Extra attention should be given the pigs at the, “, they make 
their choice of teats, to see that the weaker pigs %.’ their share, 
as they usually continue to use the teats first chosen. The 
stronger pigs, however, are very likely to take a few pulls at the 
teats of their less robust mates. To reduce this difficulty, each 
sow and litter should be placed in a lot by themselves. 
Brood sows, like all other farm animals, often need assistance 
at farrowing time. Difficult parturition among sows should be 
handled much as suggested for difficult parturition among sheep 
(see page 412). Feeding a heavy corn ration to the pregnant 
sow is likely to increase the troubles at farrowing time. A 
better plan is to use food containing more protein and mineral 
matter, as such foods strengthen the sow, while corn has a 
tendency to produce fat and thus to weaken her. 
The brood sow eating her pigs. — The causes that induce a sow 
to eat her own young are perhaps numerous, though not well 
understood. This abnormal appetite may be due to the failure 
to remove the afterbirth promptly. If left in the farrowing pen, 
the sow scents it and is likely to devour it; and since the scent 
of the young pigs is similar, they too may be eaten. If the 
sow has not been properly fed during pregnancy, if the ration 
lacks flesh-producing and bone-making material, she may have 
an appetite for blood. 
Sows that have access to clover or alfalfa pasture in summer, 
or those that are provided with roots in winter, seldom eat their 
pigs, especially if a box of charcoal and salt is kept before them 
at all times. When the sow possesses the abnormal appetite, 
it has been recommended to feed her pork, preferably salt pork. 
The salt pork causes her to drink water, which allays the fever. 
The assertion is made that when the appetite is satisfied she 
will leave the pigs alone. 
The sow after farrowing. — The sow is in a feverish condition 
after farrowing and should be provided with an abundance of 
2K

lukewarm water. Never give her ice-cold water. In a few 
hours she will show signs of wanting to eat, when she should be 
given a little thin mash or gruel made from shorts, bran, or oat- 
meal. This should be given warm, in cold weather. For the 
first week the feed should be light, consisting mainly of mashes, 
but no corn should be given at this time. Milk-producing foods, 
such as skim-milk, shorts, bran, oat meal, and a little clover or 
alfalfa hay, should be given, while fattening foods, such as corn, 
are to be avoided. 
Occasionally the sow’s udder is injured on account of an 
unusual development of the pig’s- teeth. This condition causes 
the sow to withhold her milk, produces a bad temper, and 
often excites her to injure the pigs. When such is the case, take 
the pigs under the arm and hold the mouth open with one 
hand while the sharp teeth are broken off with small pincers. 
To do this remove the pigs out of hearing distance from the 
sow, as she is likely to object and create a disturbance. 
THE PIGS 
The pig that is safely born and within a few minutes gets a 
firm hold of a teat full of milk, has made a good start in life. 
Not all pigs are so fortunate, and many perish for want of care 
at farrowing time. When at all convenient, one should be near 
by to give assistance if need should arise. Often pigs must be 
assisted to find the teat, especially in cold weather. Sometimes 
the sow is nervous, and the pigs should be removed as farrowed, 
otherwise she may crush them; and sometimes it is necessary to 
help dry the pigs to keep them from chilling. 
The first meal. — It is important that the young pig get his 
stomach full of the first milk of the sow. This should be accom- 
plished within a few minutes after farrowing, otherwise the pig’s 
strength will rapidly decrease. If for any reason the sow has 
no milk for the pigs and it is desired to raise them by hand, they 
should be given a very small quantity of cow’s milk warmed to
-P-A-G-E-527
  THE BREEDING OF SWINE 499 
body temperature. This may be given from a bottle and nipple. 
Great care should be taken not to feed the little fellows too much 
at a time, but they should be fed often, every two hours for a 
while, then every three hours, then every four hours, and later 
they should be fed four times daily. This involves much work, 
but is essential if the pigs are to be raised, as hand-fed pigs often 
die from overfeeding following a long period during which they 
received no food whatever. 
Pig ills. — The young pig is very subject to digestive dis- 
orders, the result of overfeeding, underfeeding, or otherwise 
  Fic. 171.— Group or Enauish Smaty YORKSHIRE OR SMALL WHITES. 
The Small Yorkshire, or Small White, was developed in England. This breed is 
noted for its fattening qualities, not particularly early maturing. The breed- 
ing qualities are only fair, the sows medium in fecundity. In size the breed 
is classed as small. The color is white, ears erect, and face greatly dished. 
improperly feeding its dam. The brood sow should be fed in 
such a way as to encourage a good flow of only medium rich 
milk. If her food is too rich, consisting of skim-milk, linseed-oil 
meal, corn, and the like, the pigs are likely to be attacked with 
thumps, diarrhea, or constipation. On the other hand, if the 
sow is underfed, the pigs are likely to suffer. A better plan is to 
feed the brood sow regularly on a ration consisting of moderately 
rich food, such asmashes made from ground oats, shorts, and bran.
-P-A-G-E-528
500 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
When the pigs are troubled with thumps or scours, cut down 
on the ration of the sow; and if the pigs are valuable, it may be 
well to milk the sow at least in part by hand, remembering that 
the last milk drawn is the richer in fat. 
Feeding the pigs. — At about three weeks of age, the pigs are 
likely to begin to nibble at their mother’s food, to bite at the 
grass, and perhaps try to root. This indicates that they are 
acquiring an appetite, and they should be encouraged to take 
food other than that supplied by the mother. Place a small 
trough in one corner of the lot or pen, and arrange a fence across 
the corner so the old sows cannot have access to it, but the young 
pigs can. Into this trough a little sweet milk may be poured 
three times daily. Do not provide more than the pigs will 
drink at once, and never leave the milk to sour in the trough, as 
digestive disorders and death are sure to follow. In a few days 
replace the milk with a small amount of bran and shorts, scalded 
and made into a gruel. Later corn soaked for 24 hours may be 
placed in the trough. For best results the young pigs should be 
fedavariety. Whatever food-stuffsare used, care must be taken 
not to feed more than they will clean up. Pigs fed in this way 
will make a much more rapid growth than if the extra trough 
had not been provided. 
Weaning the pigs. — With pigs fed as suggested above, the 
weaning process is easy and simple. As the pigs learn to rely 
more on the extra food, the mother’s milk-producing food should 
be cut down so that she will not be in the height of her flow when 
the pigs are taken away. The age to wean pigs varies: with the 
youngsters that have made a rapid growth they should be 
weaned at about eight weeks of age; or in case the pigs and 
mother are not doing well, it may be wise to wean at a much 
younger age even though the pigs are small. As a general rule, | 
it is safer to say the best age for weaning is between seven and 
ten weeks. Some advise turning out the most thrifty pigs first, 
leaving the weaker ones to nurse a few days longer, the state: 
 
-P-A-G-E-529
  
    THE BREEDING OF SWINE 501 
ment being made that in this way there is no danger of the 
sow’s udder spoiling, as the weaker ones will take the milk. 
This practice is of doubtful merit ; it is perhaps best to take the 
sows entirely away from the pigs, thus leaving the youngsters 
in their own pen. If the sows have previously had their food 
reduced as suggested and the pigs are fed extra, this will surely 
give best results. 
Castrating the pigs. — The boar pigs not desired for breed- 
ing purposes should be castrated. This should be done rather 
early in order that the pigs may recover from the resulting sore- 
ness before weaning, say from three to six weeks of age. 
At this age, the operation is very simple. Have an assist- 
ant hold the pig by the hind legs, placing the pig’s back against, 
the assistant’s breast, and holding the hind legs apart in such a 
way as to expose the scrotum. Simply slit the end of the scro- 
tum and remove the testicles by pulling them out ; smear a mix- 
ture of fresh lard and turpentine half and half on the scrotum, 
and let the pig go. With ridglings and hernia there is more dan- 
ger and more care should be used. A ridgling is an animal in 
which one or both testicles have not descended into the scrotum. 
Marking pigs. — When one is breeding pure-bred animals, 
some system of identification is necessary, as even an expert 
cannot identify pigs when they are reared in large droves. 
The method suggested in Fig. 172 is very good. 
Pigs after weaning. — Many pigs are stunted for want of 
proper care the first month after weaning. If in summer, they 
are frequently turned out to hot dry pasture to forage for them- 
selves; or if in winter, they are placed in close, dark, cold and 
muddy quarters, and they are likely to fail to develop. An- 
imals thus treated, of course do not make satisfactory gain. 
For best results, if in summer, the pigs just weaned should 
be provided with shade, a clean mud wallow, and receive grain in 
addition to the pasture; if in winter, dry, well lighted, well 
ventilated, and protected quarters should be provided, and if at  
-P-A-G-E-530
  502 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
all possible the animals should receive succulent food in the 
shape of roots in addition to the grain, which grain should 
not consist entirely of corn. 
The breeding hogs and the fat hogs may run together until

when the breeding ani- 
mals should be taken 
out. At this age the 
sows will begin to show 
up, so that those likely 
to make the best an- 
imals may be chosen 
for breeding. If later 
on some of the sows not 
chosenshould show good 
form, they too may be 
taken out of the fat 
herd. Those animals 
chosen for breeding 
should be fed a nitrog- 
enous ration. In addi- 
tion, they should be permitted to take abundance of exercise. 
If they are confined too closely and fed a fattening ration, their 
breeding powers are likely to be weakened.

CHAPTER XXIV 
CARE AND MANAGEMENT 
Asinz from the various practical points on care and manage- 
ment discussed in the chapters on feeding and breeding, special 
attention is now given to sanitation and equipment. Many of 
the common diseases that often prove so very fatal to swine are 
due entirely or in a large measure to carelessness or indifference 
in management. It is well known to swine breeders that few 
hogs are free from lice. These vermin are blood suckers, and 
in a very short time they produce a weakened condition of the 
animal, thereby rendering it far more susceptible to other dis- 
eases; even cholera is more virulent and more deadly when the 
herd is infested with lice. 
DIPPING SWINE 
To free the hogs from lice or other vermin, all newly ac- 
quired hogs should be dipped immediately upon arriving at 
the farm in much the same way as suggested for sheep (see 
page 423). The hogs should not be permitted to infect the 
quarters or lots before dipping. The same dipping-vat as that 
suggested for sheep may be used, as well as the same coal-tar 
preparation, although the solutions may be used somewhat 
weaker for swine. AIl stock hogs should be dipped at least 
twice each year, or whenever they become infested with lice 
(Fig. 173). 
Good results are reported from the use of a self-dipping device. 
This device consists of a shallow vat about ten inches deep and 
eight to ten feet square. It is built of two-inch plank and placed 
503  
-P-A-G-E-532
  504 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
near by or convenient to the well or large water-tank. The vat 
is filled about three-fourths full of water and one quart of dip 
added. The dip is renewed about once in two weeks and the 
water supplied as needed. During the muddy season the tank 
should be cleaned and a fresh start made. The liquid may be 
removed in a few minutes with a scoop shovel. The hogs

wallow in this at will, and they do not seem to mind the dip; 
when the water is fresh they often drink small quantities of the 
liquid. This keeps the hogs free from lice and skin diseases 
and helps to keep down worms, cholera, and other swine plagues. 
SHELTER FOR SWINE 
Some one has fittingly said, ‘The hog does not need a palace 
or an upholstered cage, nor does he prosper in a dungeon.” 
Occasionally much money is uselessly expended in the construc- 
tion of a large and expensive building which is in use only a 
part of the year; more often, however, swine are housed in a hole 
in the straw stack or in a shed constructed from fence rails or 
poles and covered with straw or fodder. Such places are dun-
-P-A-G-E-533
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT 505 
geons. There is no ventilation, they are dark and damp in 
wet weather, and soon become filthy dens of infection. 
As with the barn for other farm animals, the hog barn should 
be well ventilated, well lighted, well drained, and dry, serviceable, 
and sanitary. Any structure that answers these conditions will 
prove fairly satisfactory. Convenience and adaptability should 
be considered in constructing the hog-house. In general, 
hog-houses are of two types: large houses, or those accommo- 
dating a considerable number of hogs; and small individual 
houses or cots. 
The large hog-house. — There are almost as many types of 
large hog-houses as there are swine breeders or feeders who have 
built them, each having its advantages and disadvantages. 
When properly constructed, the large hog-house is serviceable, 
sanitary, and convenient; but, if properly constructed, they 
are expensive, especially since they are only used a part of the 
year. It is difficult to locate them accessibly to the pastures, 
particularly in case sown pastures are used, as they are likely to 
be on various parts of the farm. Furthermore, when many sows 
are housed in close proximity to each other, if one is disturbed or 
molested in any way, all the others are likely to become fretful; 
and when feeding is begun in one part of the house the other 
animals become uneasy and often injure their litters. 
The individual hog-house. — Of late years the small individual 
hog-house has become very common. ‘These small houses are 
constructed on runners so they can be moved from one field 
or lot to another. They are well adapted to accommodate a 
sow and her litter, and a few of these “cots,” as they are often 
called, set side by side afford excellent shelter for a drove of hogs. 
The Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station has issued a 
bulletin devoted chiefly to the construction of these small houses, 
and from which we quote: ‘The portable hog-house is 
easily and economically constructed; it can be easily moved 
and located wherever desired ; it is useful to the general farmer
-P-A-G-E-534
  506 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
and to the breeder of pure-bred stock; and of all systems of 
housing swine it is the most natural and sanitary. Only the 
simplest workmanship is necessary to build the portable house, 
and much old lumber can be worked into it. 
“The portable house is peculiarly advantageous, since it can 
be readily moved. The renter who finds it impossible to pro- 
vide expensive quarters for his hogs can well afford to construct 
portable houses, which can be retained as personal property. 
It is useful on any sized farm as the number can be regulated to 
the size of the herd. With separate paddocks to accommodate 
swine of different ages and sexes the portable house is practically 
a necessity. Swine will never pile up in a damp, poorly venti- 
lated quarter and come out steaming in the cold morning air, 
unless compelled to do so. Where a large number of animals 
are continually housed in one hog-house, the surroundings are 
sure to become more or less filthy and unsanitary. If feeding 
is done on the inside, it keeps a portion of the floor wet, and gives 
the entire building an offensive disagreeable appearance. On 
the other hand, by using the portable house, moving it occa- 
sionally to a fresh piece of ground, and feeding the hogs at dif- 
ferent places, one avoids those unsanitary conditions. These 
portable houses can be built to accommodate from four to six 
mature animals or ten to twenty shotes. This method of 
housing keeps them much cleaner and more thrifty than when 
allowed to congregate in large numbers, and individuals of a 
herd showing evidence of a contagious disease can be readily 
isolated.” 
The A-shaped individual hog-house. — These portable houses 
are usually constructed of two types, the A-shaped and the shed- 
roof-shaped. A convenient size for the A-shaped house is eight 
feet square and seven feet high. It may be constructed with or 
without a wood floor, as desired. If one has paved or very dry 
lots where the cots are to remain in winter, perhaps they will give 
better satisfaction without the wood floor. On the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-535
  
CARE AND MANAGEMENT 507 
if the lots where they are kept for winter use are muddy, a wood 
floor should be provided. A ventilator should be provided, 
which may be made by 
sawing off the ends of 
two roof boards and cov- 
ering the hole thus formed 
with a V-shaped hood 
(Fig. 174). In order to 
provide light a window- 
glass ought to be placedin 
the front above the door 
and a second in the rear. 
A door two feet wide and 
two feet and six inches eee 
high should be provided Fig. 174,— A-Suapep Inpivipva Hoc-nouss. 
at one end. The door itself may be suspended by a rope and 
arranged to slide up and down as it will need to be used only in 
very cold weather. For summer use a gunny sack may be 
hung over the door, as this will serve to brush the flies off as 
the hog enters and to keep the cot cool. To facilitate moving 
from lot to lot, the structures should be placed on runners. If 
brood sows are due to farrow in very cold weather, these cots 
can be made very comfortable by standing fodder or placing 
straw about them. 
Theshed-shaped individual hog-house. —In Fig. 175 isshown the 
front elevation of a shed-roof hog-house eight feet wide, twelve 
feet long, and seven feet high in front and three behind, which 
is sometimes preferred to the A-shaped house. It is provided 
with doors in the rear, the same size as the lower front doors, 
and placed diagonally opposite, so that by opening all the doors 
it makes a cool house in summer. On the other hand, by closing 
the lower doors and opening the upper doors, for ventilation, it 
makes a warm house for cold winter weather. The upper front 
doors are arranged with wooden ratchets on the back side, 
 
-P-A-G-E-536
  508 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
which holds them in any desired position. By having the hinges 
on the top, the storm and hot sun cannot enter and yet by ad- 
justing the opening, air may circulate freely without causing a 
draft on the animals. These top doors are very important. It 
is a serious mistake to build these houses with but one opening, 
as is sometimes done. There is no ventilation whatever, and 
the house in warm weather becomes a suffocating quarter. 
  Fic. 175.—Suep-suarep Inpivipuat Hoa-House, with SHapE ATTACHED. 
The illustration of the shed-roof portable hog-house shows a 
shade at the rear under which the pigs can lie in comfort. This 
shade is five feet wide, made of inch boards placed upon remoy- 
able supports which rest on cleats nailed to the ends of the 
house (Fig. 175). 
Disadvantages and advantages. — The individual hog-house has 
the disadvantage of requiring more labor to feed and care for 
the herd. With each sow and litter in a pen or cot by them- 
selves it takes considerable time to make the rounds, and this 
must often be done in the storm. Furthermore, vicious sows are 
more difficult to attend, and the feeder is often obliged to enter
-P-A-G-E-537
  CARE AND MANAGEMENT 509 
the cot to arrange the bedding and clean the quarters. These 
small houses, however, are very inexpensive and very efficient, 
and all things considered, answer the general farmer’s conditions 
much better than the large and expensive hog-house. 
THE HOG LOT 
The lot in which hogs are quartered should be such as can be 
kept clean. A filthy and carelessly kept lot encourages disease 
by providing lodgment for the germs; and constant cleanliness 
is the most effective means of preventing germ dissemination. 
Where disease germs have once been established, an absolutely 
thorough disinfection is essential to eradicate them. To facilitate 
cleanliness and disinfection, at least a part of the lot should be 
paved with brick, stone, or concrete. On this pavement the cots 
may be placed during the winter season and on it the feeding 
may be done. 
Hog-wallows. —Some very successful breeders heartily favor 
hog-wallows, while others equally as successful are much 
opposed to their use. Those who are outspoken in opposi- 
tion to the wallow have perhaps been influenced from 
infections due to a filthy wallow, or from infections at the time 
of an outbreak of cholera. There can be no doubt that filthy 
wallows are often a sourceof danger, nor can there be any doubt 
that once a cholera hog wallows in the water, however clean, all 
other hogs wallowing in or drinking this contaminated water 
are likely to contract the dreaded disease. 
On the other hand, with the bealthy herd there can be no ob- 
jections to a clean mud wallow, and there are many advantages 
to be derived from it. During the heat of summer the hog 
cools mainly by radiation, and a cool mud bath is very soothing ; 
it cleans the scurf from the skin and enables the hog to find 
protection from the flies. This wallow or mud bath should be so 
arranged that fresh water may be added as needed, and to insure 
absolute freedom from all germ life a quart of coal-tar dip may be 
poured in the wallow occasionally (see also page 504).

CHAPTER XXV 
DISEASES OF SWINE 
WHILE swine are not ordinarily considered as being subject 
to so great a variety of diseases as horses, cattle, or sheep, they 
are very often attacked by ailments far more serious than afflict 
any other class of our farm animals. Chief of these diseases are 
cholera, swine plague, and tuberculosis. Throughout the corn- 
belt of the United States, the loss caused by these diseases among 
swine is not equaled by any other class of diseases to which 
farm animals are subject. These very deadly diseases are all 
contagious or infectious and therefore, with proper sanitary 
methods, can be prevented, although when the animal once 
becomes afflicted, there is no cure. It is the ravages caused 
by these diseases that makes pork production such a hazardous 
business. Sometimes the swine breeder or feeder will have a 
drove of swine ready for the market when they will contract 
one of these diseases and the entire herd be taken in a few 
weeks. 
Quarantine lot. — On every farm where hogs are kept in con- 
siderable numbers, a small quarantine lot should be provided. 
This lot should be located at some distance from the other lots, it 
should be tightly fenced and at least a part of it should be paved. 
When a new animal arrives, it maybe dipped as suggested (page 
503) and then placed in this quarantine pen for at least three 
weeks. Cholera or any other diseases will be apparent before 
this. If all is well, it may then be turned with the herd. 
Such a pen could be used by any of the animals of the herd 
that may become sick, as all ailing hogs should at once be

DISEASES OF SWINE 611 
separated until the nature of the disease is determined. Such 
a lot set apart for this purpose may prevent outbreaks of very 
serious diseases. 
HOG CHOLERA 
Hog cholera is an infectious disease of swine. It exists in all 
sections of the United States, but is particularly prevalent 
in the corn-belt. In that section it is the most dreaded 
disease to which swine are subject. Not so many animals 
are condemned at the large packing houses because of this 
disease, as of tuberculosis, but this is due to the nature of the dis- 
ease. With cholera the hogs die or recover quickly, while with 
tuberculosis they may linger for months. Cholera varies in its 
virulence; sometimes comparatively few hogs that have it will 
die, while at other times nearly every animal in the entire herd 
will succumb to the disease. When the disease once appears, it 
spreads very rapidly, not only among the animals of a herd, but 
across the country from one farm to another. 
Manner of spreading the disease. — Cholera is a germ disease 
and may be spread in many ways. These germs are very hardy 
and vigorous. They are able to live for a long time in the 
water of ponds and streams; they may live in the soil for at 
least three months and in accumulations of straw and litter for a 
much longer time. The hog, taking in these germs either by in- 
haling with the breath or by ingestion with the food, is likely 
to contract the disease. Only the very smallest particle is 
necessary to convey the germ. Thus, an attendant passing 
from a lot of infected hogs to a lot of healthy ones may carry 
the infection on his shoes; dogs, chickens, pigeons, and even 
birds are known to have carried the germs. The wind 
blowing particles of dust from place to place will also carry with 
it sufficient of these germs to produce the disease. A cholera 
hog having access to a stream may contaminate the water 
sufficiently to infect animals miles below.  
-P-A-G-E-540
  512 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Prevention of the disease. — Up to the present time, there has not 
been discovered any means by which hog cholera can be cured, 
the only safeguard being prevention. All that is necessary to 
prevent the disease is to keep the germs of the disease away 
from the herd. In the vast majority of cases the germ 
is transported mechanically, in the bodies of sick hogs and 
on the feet of men or animals, including birds. It follows, 
therefore, that the chances of an outbreak of hog cholera will be 
greatly lessened, if not completely avoided, if the herd is pro- 
tected from these sources of infection. To do this the herd 
should be placed on a part of the farm that will be least accessible 
to men or animals from other farms. The hogs should be con- 
fined to a dry lot free from running water or wallows, unless one is 
constructed as suggested on page 509, and the disinfectant added 
every two weeks. Careful attention should be given the feed 
and water. The hogs should be provided with shade and clean 
dry sleeping places. 
If at any time any of the animals show signs of sickness, they 
should be separated from the healthy ones. Air-slaked lime 
should bescattered about the lot, and the feed troughs thoroughly 
disinfected or replaced by new ones. For a condition powder 
prepare the following : —

Dace 
Completely pulverize and thoroughly mix. This powder is 
mixed with the feed in the proportion of a large tablespoonful 
to each 200 pounds weight of hogs, and given once a day. When 
hogs are suspected to be affected with cholera, they should not 
be fed on corn alone, but have, at least once a day, soft feed made 
by mixing bran and middlings, or middlings and corn meal, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-541
  
DISEASES OF SWINE 513 
ground oats and corn, or crushed wheat, and then stirring into 
this the proper quantity of the medicine. 
After an outbreak of cholera the yardsand pens should be thor- 
oughly cleaned, all dead hogs should be burned, the litter should 
be collected and burned, and quicklime scattered freely over the 
ground. The houses should be washed thoroughly with a coal- 
tar preparation before new stock is brought in. The troughs 
should be burned, or if this is not practicable, they should be 
thoroughly soaked in coal-tar preparation and then washed out. 
The lots and houses should not be used again for some time. 
Prevention of cholera by immunization. — The Bureau of Ani- 
mal Industry, Department of Agriculture, has developed a serum 
which by means of vaccination will render hogs immune to chol- 
era. While its preparation and use are attended with difficul- 
ties, the method is briefly given here because of the feeling that 
if it is to prove practicable, it must be so simplified as to be used 
by any careful workman. Furthermore, a drove of cholera hogs 
affords a very good opportunity to practice, as their value is not 
likely to be great, especially if the attack is virulent. 
In order to make the method clear it will be divided into two 
main parts: the preparation of the serum, and the use of the 
serum. 
Preparation of the serum. — To prepare the serum one must 
first procure an immune hog with a long heavy tail, since it is 
at this point that the serum is drawn, and it may be necessary 
to clip the end two or three times in drawing the serum. This 
may be a hog that has recovered from an attack of cholera, 
as such animals are immune to further attacks, or it may be 
one rendered immune by the method herein described. This 
hog we will call the supply animal. This animal must now be 
hyper-immunized. This consists of inoculating him, in the mus- 
cles of the thigh, with about 10 c.c. (cubic centimeters) of 
virulent hog cholera blood, from which the clot has been re- 
moved by stirring or whipping with a clean stick, to the pound 
2u
-P-A-G-E-542
  514 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
liveweight of hog. Thus a 100-pound hog should receive 1000 
e.c. of virulent blood taken from a hog sick with cholera. 
This virulent blood may be obtained by allowing the cholera 
hog to bleed to death, taking care to collect the blood free from 
particles of dirt; or it may be obtained by clipping the end of the 
tail and allowing it to flow slowly into a jar well protected from 
dirt. If the tail stops bleeding, thump it or cut the end again. 
After collecting the blood, gently stir it with a clean stick, or 
better still a glass rod to remove the clot. The clot will collect 
on the rod while stirring. This diseased blood from which the 
clot has been removed is now ready to inject into the muscles of 
the supply hog. This is done with a hypodermic syringe and 
inoculated into the inner side of the thigh after placing the pig 
on his back. There are two methods of inoculating, — the 
slow method, and the quick method. By the slow method, in- 
creasing amounts of virulent blood are injected at regular inter- 
vals, which requires so much time that it is seldom used. By the 
quick method, the virulent blood is all injected at one time. 
After the injection of this blood, the supply animal is said to 
be hyper-immunized. 
One week after the injection of the virulent blood into the 
supply animal, the hog is ready to have his blood drawn for 
the purpose of protecting hogs from cholera. This blood may 
be drawn in two ways: the supply animal may be killed and the 
entire supply of blood taken at once, or he maybe bled at the tail. 
The tail should be thoroughly cleaned, disinfected, and then the 
end is cut off and the blood caught in a clean jar. Much care 
_ should be used to keep everything clean and free from germ-laden 
dirt. In this way, 500 c.c. of blood may be drawn at one time. 
This may be repeated three times at intervals of one week, after 
which the blood gradually loses its protective properties and 
should not be used. 
The blood thus collected is allowed to clot, after which it is 
filtered through sterilized gauze in order to get the serum or the
-P-A-G-E-543
  DISEASES OF SWINE 515 
liquid part of the blood separated from the clot. Then add suffi- 
cient carbolic acid to make a one-half per cent solution; that is, 
if there is 500 c.c. of the serum, add 214 c.c. of carbolic acid. 
Use of the serum. — There are two methods of using the 
serum for the prevention of hog cholera: the serwm-alone 
method, in which the serum only is used; and the serwm- 
  Fic. 176.— First Prize Tamworrs Sow ar Inurnors Farr. 
The Tamworth breed of swine is a native of England. This breed is similar to 
the Large Yorkshire and is noted for bacon production. The quality of pork 
is unexceled, although the animals are rather late maturing. The breeding 
qualities are excellent, the sows being very prolific. The breed is classed as 
large. The color is red or sandy, the ears almost erect and the face long and 
straight. 
simultaneous method, in which the serum and virulent blood 
from a hog infected with cholera are used. 
Serum-alone method. — With the hypodermic syringe, inject 
into the arm and thigh pits 20 c.c. of serum for each 100 pounds 
weight of pig. That is, if the pig weighs 50 pounds, inject 10 ¢.c.
-P-A-G-E-544
516 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
of the serum, whereas if the pig weighs 150 pounds, inject 
30 c.c. of serum. This method gives immediate but tempo- 
rary immunity lasting perhaps four or five weeks, possibly 
longer. It is recommended for use in herds where cholera 
already exists, but to be used on seemingly healthy pigs only. 
Pigs already sick will probably not benefit by its use, 
although if the animals should be infected with the disease 
germ immediately after the serum is injected, the immunity 
will last much longer than otherwise. There is no danger 
attending this method. 
Serum-simultaneous method. — With the hypodermic syringe, 
inject simultaneously into the arm and thigh pits 20 c.c. of 
serum and 1 c.c. of virulent hog cholera blood for each 100 pounds 
weight of pig. The virulent blood must be obtained from a hog 
sick with cholera and the clot removed. Pigs treated by this 
method are immune for six months to one year. This is the 
method usually employed, but is attended with greater danger 
than the serum-alone method; however, the resulting immunity 
is much longer. 
Objections to the serum method.— There are two objections to 
this method of vaccinating hogs to protect them against cholera: 
it is expensive and somewhat dangerous. It is expensive because 
a 125-pound hog will furnish a comparatively small amount 
of blood, perhaps 500 ¢.c. at each four bleedings and 1000 c.c. 
more at death, making a total of only 3000 c.c., from which 
the clot must be taken. Furthermore, this animal must be ren- 
dered hyper-immune, which involves much labor and expense. 
The process of immunization is dangerous because it requires 
the use of the virulent hog cholera blood containing the living hog 
cholera germ. When this is used without the protective serum, 
an outbreak of hog cholera is immediately started. With proper 
precautions, an attendant that takes an interest in the method 
can prevent serious outbreaks of hog cholera and thus reduce the 
tisk in pork production. 
Soa. 
 
-P-A-G-E-545
  DISEASES OF SWINE 511 
SWINE PLAGUE 
Swine plague is an infectious germ disease of swine. It is 
frequently associated with hog cholera, which it resembles. In 
fact, the two diseases resemble each other so very closely that it 
often requires a post mortem examination by an expert to dis- 
tinguish between them. From this it follows that the manner 
of spreading the disease as well as its prevention are practically 
the same as in the case of hog cholera. While these two diseases 
cause untold loss among swine, it must be remembered that by 
proper sanitary methods they can be practically prevented. 
This calls for better treatment than is ordinarily given swine. 
Well-lighted, comfortable quarters; clean, dry lots free from 
filthy wallows, but provided with a self-dipping device ; a liberal 
use of disinfectants in the houses and of air-slaked lime in the 
lots, will go a long way towards apne the ravages of these 
two diseases to a minimum. 
TUBERCULOSIS 
Tuberculosis is most prevalent among swine in those sections 
where cattle are most affected. Great numbers of hogs are 
condemned by the large packing-houses because of this disease, 
more than from all other diseases combined, and the percentage 
is increasing year by year until at present it is thought that about 
three per cent are being thrown out. 
Manner of spreading the disease. — The tubercular germ gains 
entrance to the bodies of various animals in different ways. 
Thus in the case of man and also cattle, the germ may be either 
inhaled or taken in with the food, while in the case of swine the 
germ gains entrance by the food alone. It is very seldom that 
the disease starts by the germs being inhaled. This being true, 
the disease should be very easily controlled in swine. The chief 
sources of infection among swine are the skim-milk from a tuber- 
cular cow, the grain in the droppings of a cow or steer infected
-P-A-G-E-546
  518 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
i 
with the disease, hogs eating carcasses of animals that aave died r 
with the disease, foods containing sputum of the human affected _ 
with tuberculosis, and like causes. 
Prevention consists in the avoidance of all foods containing the 
tubercular germs and in providing quarters similar to those 
suggested for hog cholera, for poorly ventilated, dark, damp, 
and filthy quarters furnish ideal quarters for the breeding of 
tuberculosis germs. The direct rays of the sun and cleanliness 
provide conditions impossible for the lodgment of these germs. 
Care of a tubercular herd. —Tuberculosis in swine is considered 
as not curable. Furthermore, its detection is often difficult. 
A hog may be affected with the disease and not show the marks 
of it until after he is slaughtered. Asarule, pigs are more subject 
to the disease than older animals, and weak animals more liable 
to attack than strong and vigorous ones. The difficulty of de- 
tecting the diseaserenders the care of the tuberculous animal haz- 
ardous. The general signs are coughing, losing in weight rather 
than gaining, and a swelling of the glands about the neck. When 
the disease is discovered, all animals showing external indications 
should be immediately destroyed and the carcasses burned. The 
remainder of the herd should be put upon the market at once and 
passed upon by a government inspector. Any animals that are 
so diseased as to render their carcasses unfit for food will be con- 
demned. Not all hogs affected with tuberculosis are condemned. 
When the disease is present only in the first stages and only a few 
of the organs of the body are affected, these parts only are con- 
demned; whereas if the disease is general throughout the car- 
cass, the entire animal is condemned. 
After an outbreak of tuberculosis and the animals have been 
disposed of, the quarters should be thoroughly disinfected. To 
do this, use a five per cent carbolic acid solution, or a 1 to 1000 
corrosive sublimate solution, and then whitewash with fresh lime. 
The pastures and lots which are exposed tothe sun are not soseri- 
ous a source of infection as the buildings. When at all possible, 
 
-P-A-G-E-547
DISEASES OF SWINE 519 
neither the house nor the lots should be used for a time, thus 
giving the sun sufficient time to destroy all the germs. 
WORMS 
Internal worms are of frequent occurrence in swine. They in- 
habit both the stomach and intestines. These worms interfere 
with digestion; in consequence the pigs fail to thrive and become 
pot-bellied, rickety, profitless runts, or quickly succumb to the 
effects of the worms. Swine infested with worms become an easy 
prey to more deadly diseases because of their weakened condi- 
tion. 
Prevention of worms. — Well-fed swine, in general, are not sub- 
ject to worms. The strong thrifty pig is usually able to resist 
the parasites. Hogs having free access to wood ashes, charcoal, 
air-slaked lime, and coal cinders are not likely to be troubled. 
The alkali in the wood ashes, together with the grit in the cinders, 
have a tendency to destroy the 
worms. Pumpkins, fed seed and 
all, in the fall also help to keep 
swine free from worms. 
Stagnant surface water, in 
which hogs wallow, are ideal 
places for the incubation and 
development of worms. For 
this reason old pens and pas- Fic. 177.—Tamworrn Pic owNnep 
tures, if wet, should not be used BU Ly Se eo 
for hogs. The pens and pastures should be well drained and 
all stagnant water fenced out or the ponds filled in. The drink- 
ing water should come from a deep well, and it should be kept 
_pure by using clean troughs so constructed or protected that

Treatment for worms. — The average herd of pigs is kept 
under such conditions that it is desirable to dose them at least 
once during the year with some remedy that. will destroy the

worms or drive them out of the intestines. Turpentine is the 
most popular remedy and perhaps the least dangerous. It is 
given in the mash for three successive mornings at the rate of 
one teaspoonful for each 80 pounds live weight of pig. With- 
holding all food should be practiced for a short time before 
giving the remedy. 
Sulfate of iron or copperas is a more effective remedy, 
and is given as follows: Dissolve half a dram of cop- 
peras in warm water and mix in the mash for each pig 
for five consecutive mornings, the food being withheld for a 
short time before giving remedy. In very bad cases and 
when immediate action is desired, the affected pigs may be 
given 5 grains of calomel and 8 grains of santonin for 
every 100 pounds of live weight. The food should be 
withheld for at least 12 hours before administering the 
medicine, which is best given in a little mash. Santonin is 
somewhat dangerous and should be given in the proportion 
mentioned. 
LICE 
The hog louse is a common cause of lack of thrift in young 
pigs, and when numerous, it tends to retard fattening. It 
is advisable and profitable to keep swine free from lice at all 
ages. To this end the houses and pens should be frequently 
cleaned and disinfected, the woodwork whitewashed, the 
bedding material kept fresh, clean, and dry, and the yards 
free from accumulations of litter and filth. The hogs should 
be dipped twice each year in a coal-tar dip, 1 part of dip to 
50 of warm water, and the treatment repeated in 10 days 
to 2 weeks. 
To destroy lice, when dipping is not possible, mix equal 
parts of kerosene and machine oil, or one part of turpentine 
and two parts of machine oil, and apply to every part of the 
hog by means of a rag, or swab of cotton waste. It may be 
applied along the back, from ears to tail, with a common ma-

DISEASES OF SWINE 521 
chine-oil can and allowed to run down the sides of the hog, 
Repeat the application in ten days. 
SCOURS 
Scours in pigs results from two causes, —improper feeding and 
contagious infection. Often the trouble comes from overfeeding 
on corn, or other rich food just after farrowing. Sudden 
changes in the food or feeding sour decomposing slops, or food 
from dirty troughs, sour swill barrels, and the like, tend to cause 
diarrhea. 
The best treatment for scouring pigs is to feed properly the 
sows. The food should consist largely of rather thin mash 
made from bran, middlings, crushed oats, and the like, which 
should be fed regularly. In ordinary cases, treatment consists 
in giving the nursing sow parched corn or scalded milk in her 
food night and morning. After the trouble has been checked, a 
little limewater placed in the mash often proves advantageous. 
The best cure for the contagious form of scours is a physic: 
one tablespoonful of castor oil in the form of a drench, after 
which the pens should be cleaned and thoroughly disinfected. 
CONSTIPATION 
Constipation frequently occurs among pregnant sows and 
other hogs when given too little exercise and too much food. 
Brood sows troubled with constipation are likely to farrow 
weak, puny pigs. This trouble seldom occurs when hogs are 
fed laxative foods, such as bran, linseed-oil meal, or roots, and 
in addition are made to take exercise. When it becomes neces- 
sary to treat the animals, a very simple method is to mix two 
to four ounces of raw linseed oil once daily in the food; or if 
more active treatment seems necessary, give four ounces of 
Epsom salts at one dose in the same way. Swine that will not 
eat the food thus medicated should be drenched. Great cara 
should be exercised in drenching hogs or they will suffocate.
-P-A-G-E-550
522 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
Drive the animals into a small pen where they have little room 
to move about. To hold the animal, secure a quarter-inch rope, 
place a noose about the upper jaw well back towards the angle 
of the lips, and elevate the head. Wait until the animal stops 
struggling. Pull the cheek away from the teeth so as to form 
a pouch into which the medicine may be slowly poured. It 
will flow from the cheek into the mouth, and when the hog 
finds out what it is, he will stop squealing and will swallow. A 
very easy method is to cut off the toe of an old shoe, insert the 
cut end into the hog’s mouth, and pour the medicine into the 
shoe. é 
THUMPS 
Thumps is the term applied to that ailment of young pigs 
which is indicated by a jerking motion of the flanks. In 
thumps there is usually a derangement of the digestive organs, 
due to overfeeding or lack of exercise. The tendency towards 
the disease seems to be hereditary. When once the trouble 
occurs, the treatment is prevention by decreasing the sow’s 
milk-producing food until the pigs are older. Compel the pigs 
to take exercise by driving them from their nests. A very good 
method when one has the time is to place the little pigs in a 
lot near the mother and let them worry about getting back. 
They must be separated but a very short time, for they may 
nurse too much when turned back. 
SORE MOUTH 
Pigs are often troubled with sore mouth. Large white 
blisters occur about the mouth and snout, and later thick 
brown scabs appear, which open into deep cracks. These scabs 
extend over the face and later to all parts of the body if not 
treated. These sores are due to a germ, and are likely to attack 
pigs kept in filthy quarters. Prevention consists in providing 
comfortable quarters for the youngsters. Treatment is not
-P-A-G-E-551
  
  DISEASES OF SWINE 523 
difficult, but should be prompt and thorough. Prepare a solu- 
tion of permanganate of potash, using one and one-half ounces 
of the crystals dissolved in one gallon of warm water. Dip 
the young pig, head foremost, into this solution and hold it there 
afew seconds. Repeat three times, giving the pig time to catch 
his breath in the intermission. The treatment should be re- 
peated for four days, after which the quarters should be dis- 
infected. 
GARGET 
Inflammation of the udder is rather common among heavy- 
milking brood sows, and is usually caused by the milk not 
being removed. The udder thus becomes congested, sore, and 
later cakes. The treatment is to relieve the congestion by 
drawing off the milk. This should be done before farrowing, 
if the udder is distended. After the milk is drawn, gently but 
thoroughly rub the udder. Bathe the parts with hot water 
fifteen minutes at a time and rub dry and apply an ointment 
made as follows: Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of gum camphor 
in a teacupful of melted fresh lard, to which add one ounce of 
the fluid extract of belladonna. The udder should be bathed 
three times daily and then the ointment well rubbed in. 
REMOVING THE TUSKS 
After one year old, all boars should have their tusks removed 
twice a year. To hold the hog, place a noose around the upper 
jaw (as suggested in drenching, p. 522) and tie to a post. Then 
with strong nippers or sharp blacksmith’s pincers remove the 
tusk. In older boars, when the tusks are hard and will not 
cut, they should be filed and then broken off as follows: after 
tying the boar to the post, an assistant stands astride the 
animal and places a stick in his mouth, takes hold of either 
end, and pulls back as far as he can and holds steady. With a 
three-cornered file notch each corner of the tusk, then put the  
-P-A-G-E-552
    524 MANUAL OF FARM ANIMALS 
point of an iron wedge in one of the notches, and tap the tusk 
with a hammer, and it will break squarely off. The tusk may 
then be filed off rounding. 
CHICKEN-EATING SWINE 
While not a disease, chicken eating is a vicious habit often 
contracted by swine kept near chicken yards. The habit 
once acquired is often difficult to overcome. A very good device 
to prevent the hogs from catching the fowls is a common four- 
inch ring hung before the hog’s snout. This may be held in 
place with the ordinary hog-ring placed around the four-inch 
ring and into the nose, as when ringing to prevent rooting. 
Thus the large ring hangs in front of the hog’s snout and pushes 
- the chicken away as the hog reaches for it.

DIGESTIBLE NUTRIENTS IN FEEDING STUFFS 
In calculating a ration for any class of farm animals, the 
digestible nutrients of the foods must be known, as it is 
the digestible part only that is of use to the animal. The 
following table, adopted from Bailey’s Cyclopedia of American 
Agriculture, Vol. III, gives a very complete list of American

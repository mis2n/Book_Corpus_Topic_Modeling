INTRODUCTION 
Arkansas was never more interested in her teacher-training 
problem. She wants to know the best way to solve it. The 
time is ripe for the State Department of Education to propose 
a state program for the training of teachers. 
This study is made for the purpose of collecting data that will 
guide one in making a state teacher-training program. Before 
making such a program one must be able to answer many ques- 
tions. Among them are the following: 
1. How many teachers has Arkansas in the different public 
school positions? 
2. What is the educational qualification of these teachers? 
3. How many new teachers does Arkansas need annually? 
Where does she get them? 
4. What is the number of new teachers needed for each kind 
of position? : 
5. What is being done now to meet the annual demand for 
new teachers? 
6. What should Arkansas do to meet this annual demand? 
This is a state problem, one which all the teachers want to 
help solve. Being a member of the State Department of Educa- 
tion, the author was assured of the co-operation of the school 
people before he undertook the study. To get this information, 
four questionnaires were sent out: (1) to county superin- 
tendents, (2) to town and city superintendents, (3) to heads of 
normal training departments, and (4) to students now in the 
nor val training departments. These questionnaires will be 
found in the study. 
About 98 per cent of the questionnaires were filled out and 
returned. Information has been collected from many sources, 
but the data obtained from these four sources have served as 
the basis for this study. 
This study is divided into four parts. As is shown in the 
Contents, Parts One, Two, and Three senve as a basis for the 
proposed state teacher-training program which is found in Part 
Four.

THE INFLUENCE OF EARLY CHURCHES AND 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
Arkansas became a territory in 1819, a state in 1836, but not 
until after the Civil War did she vote a school tax, or have a 
state superintendent of public instruction. Until 1853 there 
were no teachers’ examinations. Anyone who could gain the 
confidence of the patrons and get a few “tuition” pupils signed 
up, could teach school. Sometimes a family employed a pri- 
vate tutor, but more often the community employed the min- 
ister, who was usually looked upon as an authority on all 
questions. 
In these early days Arkansas was being settled by people from 
many of the states, both north and east. Many of these “new 
comers” had been to school and were able to read, write and 
cipher. When this information got to the patrons, this edu- 
cated man, if his morals were unquestioned, was regarded as 
being qualified to teach the community school. 
“The first schools in Arkansas were church schools under the 
direction of the Jesuits.” During this period the church was 
the principal power in setting up teacher-standards. 
In 1820 the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign 
Missions, located at Bradford, Massachusetts, sent Cephas Wash- 
burn to Arkansas as a minister and teacher. Mr. Washburn was 
a graduate of the University of Vermont. This educated Chris- 
tian leader spent forty years as a minister and teacher in cen- 
tral and northwestern Arkansas. His influence was state-wide. ° 
He often had as many as seven teachers on his faculty. He did 
not want teachers on his faculty until they met the following 
standard: 
“A teacher must be conscientious. A sense of the precious- 
ness of the charge committed to him, and his awful responsi- 
bility, should take an abiding and almost overwhelming hold on 
his mind. In all his instructions, his discipline and corrections, 
in a word, in all his conduct toward his pupils, he should act as 
if in the immediate view of the judgment and eternity. He 
should have a live sense of the worth of immortal souls. * * * 
He must be persevering, never undertaking what he is unable 
to accomplish. He must have a good knowledge of the human 
heart. He must be industrious.” 
After referring to the work of the Jesuits and to Washburn, 
Shinn says: “Other denominations now entered the state and 
founded private country schools in certain neighborhoods.’”?

10 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
There were, of course, many private schools. The following 
contract made in 1847 will throw light on the nature of these 
early schools: 
“This article, entered into on this the 27th day of December, 
1847, between Josiah H. Shinn, of the county of Pope and State 
of Arkansas, of the first part, and we the undersigners, of the 
county and State aforesaid, witnesseth: The said Shinn doth 
bind himself to teach a school in the new school house on the 
Jand of B. D. R. Shinn for the term of three months, Saturdays 
and Sundays excepted, and during said term to instruct all pupils 
committed to his charge in all branches usually taught in com- 
mon English schools to the best of his ability. Strict rules of 
morality are to be enforced during school hours and while the 
pupils are under the care of the teacher. And we the under- 
signers do bind ourselves to pay said Shinn for his services $3 
for each scholar we subscribe, and what the said Shinn needs 
for his family we will deliver at his residence, or at the house 
of B. D. R. Shinn. When produce is taken it is to be at the 
price for which a like article can be procured for the cash. Many 
articles will be needed during the school for the use of the family, 
such as meal, flour, pork, beef, sugar, and coffee. School to 
begin on the 3rd day of January, 1848.1 
Prior to 1860 there were about ninety ‘“‘academies” incorpo- 
rated. Many of them taught only the elementary grade subjects, 
but it was in these academies that most of the state’s teachers 
_were trained. 
In 1831 Thomas B. Malone advertised his academy, empha- 
sizing the fact that he would admit girls to his school. Mrs. 
Malone taught the girls and he taught the boys. He instructed 
the boys in the following subjects: “Spelling, reading, writing, 
arithmetic, grammar, rhetoric, elocution, geometry, natural and 
moral philosophy, chemistry, Latin and Greek.” Mrs. Malone 
instructed the girls in “reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, 
geography, history, natural philosophy, drawing, and painting.’? 
The charters granted to these academies showed four things: 
(1) Boys and girls were educated separately; (2) There were 
no free schools. (3) The way to have a free school was by 
endowment and not by taxation. (4) Each student was guar- 
anteed religious freedom.? 
There were three colleges in Arkansas prior to 1860. St. 
John’s College, established at Little Rock in 1850, was financed 
by the Masons. ‘Every student who entered this college had to 
sign an agreemerit that he would teach primary schools in:

Arkansas for at least two years after graduation. Cane Hill 
College, established at Cane Hill, 1852, and Arkansas College, 
established at Fayetteville, 1852, also helped to furnish the state 
with teachers. While these academies and colleges furnished the 
state with many teachers, none of them had normal training 
departments. 
Weeks makes the following summary of public education in 
Arkansas up to 1861: ’ 
“It is evident that the income from the land funds had accom- 
plished little toward universal education in Arkansas. It is 
equally true that much had been accomplished in an educational 
way, but it was mainly through the instrumentality of the pri- 
vate academy supported by private endowment and tuition fees. 
The State, so far as it had entered at all into the educational 
field, performed only the duties of administration. The public 
lands donated for schools had been badly managed in the main. 
They had often been sacrificed; the money received had some- 
times been badly invested, and in part lost in the financial panic 
of 1837 and succeeding years. The State still regarded the busi- 
ness of education as private, personal, optional, patriarchal, aris- 
tocratic, and religious. The conscientiousness of social solidarity 
had not dawned, and the State felt itself under little educational 
obligation to the rising generation. This was not peculiar to 
Arkansas. It was the spirit of the time. 
“The question of taxation as the main source of school sup- 
port had, perhaps, hardly been seriously considered. There had 
been, however, a small income from this source, and that the 
modern idea was dawning is found in the recommendation of the 
State school commissioner and of the Governor in 1854, that the 
general assembly authorize the county court to appropriate the 
poll tax for school purposes. But this proposal did not become 
a law until the promulgation of the constitution in 1868.”

Cuapter II 
DEVELOPMENT OF STATE AND COUNTY DEPART- 
MENTS OF EDUCATION 
In 1843 we notice, for the first time, laws that point toward 
a school system. The legislature passed a law providing for a 
State Board of Education, consisting of the Governor, the presi- 
dent of the senate, the speaker of the house, the supreme judge 
and ten members of the general assembly. There was not a pro- 
fessional school man on the board. There was also to be a 
county board of education in each county composed of the county 
judge, the county clerk and three elective members. The law also 
provided for three local school trustees who should employ a 
“competent teacher” for at least four months. This was an 
excellent system for a seven-year-old state, but the system failed 
because the legislature provided no money with which to run it. 
In 1853 we find the first idea of a state superintendent of pub- 
lic instruction. The secretary of state was made ex-officio state 
commissioner of education. The people of each county elected 
a county superintendent, called the “county school commissioner.” 
The commissioner in each county prepared his own questions 
and examined his teachers whenever and however he thought 
best. He made annual reports to the secretary of state. 
In 1854 the Secretary of State, David B. Greer, saw the big 
task that he had assumed. After reporting to the Governor how 
slow the county commissioners were in sending in their annual 
reports, he strongly recommended that the Governor appoint a 
state superintendent of public schools, “‘a man of ability and edu- 39 66 cation”. “an enlightened and zealous supe: intendent.” 
In 1867 the legislature passed an educational bill that has 
since been the basic law for Arkansas’ public school system. It 
provided for a state superintendent of public instruction, elected 
by the people; for a county commissioner in each county, elected 
by the people ; and for a state and local school tax. This was the 
state’s first introduction to a school tax and to a state superin- 
tendent of public instruction. 
In 1868 the new constitution provided for a state superin- 
tendent of public instruction. This same year the legislature 
abolished the office of county superintendent and created the 
office of circuit superintendent for each of the ten districts. The 
Governor appointed these circuit superintendents at a salary of 
$3,000 each. This salary and the traveling expenses took a 
large part of the state’s $80,000 school fund. The people objected’ 
to giving more than half the state school fund to these ten men. 
In 1868 the poll tax was given to the school fund for the first. 
time.
-P-A-G-E-13
Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 13:   
In 1873 the office of circuit superintendent was abolished and 
the office of county superintendent again created. The county 
superintendent was to be appointed by a convention of school 
trustees. 
J. C. Corbin, a negro graduate of Oberlin College, Ohio, was 
state superintendent of public instruction from January 6, 1873, 
to October 30, 1874. The framers of the Constitution, 1874, did 
not include the office of state superintendent of public instruc- 
tion. This left J. C. Corbin out of office. He then became prin- 
cipal of the Branch Normal at Pine Bluff, a position which he 
held for many years. 
The state had no superintendent of public instruction after 
October 30, 1874, until the legislature passed a law providing 
for one December 7, 1875. The Governor immediately appointed 
George W. Hill, who assumed the duties of the office December 
18, 1875. The Constitution of 1874, with a few amendments, 
is still the basic law for all educational legislation. 
In 1875 the legislature abolished the office of county super- 
intendent and created the office of county examiner. The county 
examiner was to be appointed by the county judge every two 
years. This law was not changed until 1907. The law of 1875 
providing for the election of a state superintendent has never 
been materially changed. : a 
In 1907 the legislature allowed the electors of each of the 
seventy-five counties to vote, biennially, at the May school elec- 
tion on the question “For County Supervision” and “Against 
County Supervision.” The law goes on to say: “If a majority 
of the voters want county supervision, a county superintendent 
will be elected at the next general election.” 
In torr the legislature provided for a State Board of Educa- 
tion to be composed of the state superintendent of public instruc- 
tion and one member from each of the seven congressional dis- 
tricts, to be appointed by the Governor. This law is still in 
effect. 
In 1919 the legislature passed a state-wide county superin- 
tendency bill, providing for a county board of five members to 
be elected in each county. The board shall elect a county super- 
intendent who shall meet the qualifications set up by the State 
Board of Education. 
The following requirements are now observed (adopted by 
the State Board of Education, 1920) : 
1. All persons hereafter elected county superintendent of 
schools shall have had at least eighteen months’ successful teach- 
ing experience, and must, within the two years immediately pre-
-P-A-G-E-14

ceding their election, have taught or been engaged in adminis- 
trative work in the public schools for not less than nine months. 
2. All persons hereafter elected county superintendent, before 
being granted a county superintendent’s certificate, shall hold a 
diploma (L. I. certificate or equivalent requiring two years’ work 
above high school) or degrees from a recognized college, univer- 
sity or normal school in addition to the requirements stated 
above, and 
Provipep FurtHer, That.any and all persons who have 
already been regularly elected county superintendent shall not 
be disqualified fron serving as county superintendent for re- 
election. 
Before this general bill was passed the following counties had 
already voted for county supervision: 
Arkansas, Ashley, Benton, Boone, Chicot, Cleburne, Conway. 
Craighead, Crawford, Crittenden, Desha, Franklin, Garland, 
Izard, Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Lee, Lonoke, Miller, Mis- 
sissippi, Monroe, Montgomery, Newton, Perry, Phillips, Poin- 
sett, Polk, Prairie, Scott, Searcy, Sebastian, Sevier, St. Francis, 
Washington, White, Woodruff, Yell. 
During the last twelve years the General Education Board has 
had a great. part in building up the State Department of Educa- 
tion. It has made it possible for this department to send into 
the state four or five field workers who have had a great influence 
on the state’s educational program. Among these field men 
have been the high school supervisor, two rural school supervisors 
and a negro school supervisor. It would be difficult to study 
any phase of the state’s educational program without seeing the 
results of one or more of these workers. The General Educa- 
tion Board has recently added a state school architect to the De- 
partment of Education. His work is already being felt. On July 
1, 1925, the General Education Board will discontinue its aid 
for two of the field workers, but the recent legislature appro- 
priated funds to carry on this work.

NCE OF DISTRICT AND COUNTY 
INSTITUTES 
Arkansas was admitted into the Union in 1836. For thirty 
years she had no teacher-training program. For the next half 
century she relied mainly on the short-term local institute for 
this training. As is shown elsewhere, there were a number of 
schools during this time that claimed to give “normal courses,” 
but they were independent of state control. In 1868 a bill was 
passed providing for the county to pay $50 annually for insti- 
tute expenses, but this law did not live through the reconstruc- 
tion period. 
The state passed a law, 1875, requiring the state superin- 
tendent to hold annually twelve district normals. Besides these 
each county superintendent was required to hold an institute 
for one week annually. In 1876 the state superintendent held 
twelve district normals lasting from two to three days. The law 
imposed no penalty for non-attendance, and nine teachers out of 
ten were absent. 
In 1877 the State Superintendent was instrumental in getting 
the legislature to pass a bill compelling teachers to attend the 
district normals, and providing for their salary to continue while 
they were in attendance. The law excused all who had good 
excuses. In 1878 there were ten district normals held, but a large 
per cent of the teachers did not attend. The state had made no 
plans for financing either these ten district normals or the county 
institutes. There was a general lack of interest in free schools. 
This feeling made it difficult for teachers to create much enthu- 
siasm in their self-supported and self-managed institutes. 
“Many of our teachers attend the county institute to save the 
lives of their certificates, To them the institute is an occasion 
to be endured simply because the law requires them to attend. 
Of course, they receive little or no help from these meetings, and 
return to their work entertaining still less favorable considera- 
tion of the real value of the institute. True, many of our insti- 
tutes are dead with formalism, deprived of strength by common- 
place discussions, hobbyriders and methodizers, and conducted 
on the theory that the chief function is to get poorly qualified 
teachers prepared to pass the quarterly examination successfully. 
So long as our institutes are conducted along these lines, so long 
shall we find a great number of teachers who object to attending 
them.”! : 
In 1879 the trustees of the Peabody Education Furid ‘émipl THE INFL

Professor Ladd to work with the State Department of Educa- 
tion in carrying out a teachers’ institute program. In 1880 State 
Superintendent James L. Denton wrote to the trustees of the 
Peabody Fund as follows: 
“The policy adopted in 1879 of holding normal institutes and 
delivering addresses in the various towns of the state has been 
productive of incalculable good.”! 
It was in 1880 that the trustees of the Peabody Fund began 
to give financial aid to the institutes. This aid came annually 
for twenty years. It came at an opportune time. The part 
which this fund had in promoting teacher-training in Arkansas 
would be difficult to over-estimate. 
“The chief provision for the training of white teachers in 
Arkansas is in the Peabody Institutes held throughout the state 
and the Peabody normal scholarships at Normal College, Nash- 
wille, Tennessee.’”? 
“The institute expenses have been paid by the generous dona- 
‘tions from the Peabody Education Fund. The state has never 
appropriated a dollar for this purpose. The appropriation from 
the Peabody Fund, though a liberal one, is not sufficient for the 
work that ought to be done. Remote counties ought to be 
reached, more institutes in charge of experts should be held, and 
for a longer period than one week. There should be one held 
in each congressional district for four weeks, so as to give more 
time for actual and necessary institute work. As reconmended 
in a former report, I again respectfully ask for an appropria- 
tion of a reasonable sum, annually, to aid in supporting. these 
training schools for teachers.’ 
During the last half of the nineteenth century the institutes 
and summer normals were the state’s teacher training institu- 
tions. No better view can be had of what these institutes and 
normals have meant to the teachers of Arkansas, than by study- 
‘ing the reports made by the state superintendents of public in- 
struction to the Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. For 
this reason I am quoting at length from some of these reports, 
which show a long fight for state normal schools. They are 
taken from reports made by Trustees of Peabody Education 
Fund. 
“During the summer I held thirty-three institutes of one week 
each, twenty-three for whites and ten for negroes. The attend- 
ance this year was larger than in any previous year. * * * * 
As a representative of the Free Schools of Arkansas, we ten- 
der you, Honorable Board, our thanks, with the assurance that

the aid you have given us is fully appreciated by teachers. citi- 
zens, and children.’ 
“The Peabody Institute has done more to improve our schools 
than all other agencies combined. The question of a normal 
school is before our people and is being discussed by all classes.’ 
“The liberal appropriations from your board have enabled me 
to double the number of institutes. * * * * I do not believe 
a better investment of the amount could have been made to im- 
prove the standard of our common school teachers.” 
“The demand for better teachers led our Legislature to em- 
power me to hold eight normal schools of three months each in 
different parts of the state for the special development of teach- 
ers. An appropriation of $2,000 per annum was made for two 
years to hold six white and two colored normal schools. The 
aid from the Peabody Trust Fund will enable me to make these 
schools of five months duration. These two sums, coupled with 
the requirements I make of each locality as to further supple- 
mentary funds, will enable me to hold ten of these schools for 
five months—six white, and four colored. Two years of this 
work, if successfully accomplished, will revolutionize the school 
sentiment in the state and give us one or more permanent normal 
schools. 
“T have tried to concentrate the institute work this year. The 
other reforms I have set on foot took much time; but I still had 
some left for the development of this work, but not enough. I 
have tried both kinds of institutes this year, and give my opinion 
that the short one should be discontinued. Less than two weeks 
is a waste. 
“The institute held at Nashville: for four weeks by Professor 
Alexander Hogg, of Texas, was a success in every particular. 
It represented eight counties, was conducted as a school, and 
won the Southwest to the normal school idea. Four towns in that 
neighborhood are vigorously competing for the location of the 
five months school for that district. 
“The Mount Nebo Summer Normal School ran for six weeks 
under charge of Professor Baldwin of the Texas Sam Houston 
Normal College, and was also a success. There was a large 
enrollment, and the leading teachers from a large number of 
counties remained for the whole time. In addition to these long 
terms, I held sixteen others for two weeks each with excellent 
results, and have several others yet to hold. 
“T have engaged several teachers by the year for the normal

school work which is just ahead, and believe that their labors 
will result in greater good. 
“Thanking you and your Board for the interest always taken 
in Arkansas, and asking its continuation in the better and more 
systematic work of the next two years, I am, etc.”? 
“The Institutes of two, three, and four weeks had an average 
attendance of nearly one thousand. I send you announcements 
for three state normal schools, which will run nine months, on 
a three years’ course. Nineteen professors and teachers have 
been engaged for the year. I have $2,000 from the state and 
$4,500 from the three towns. The course comprehends three 
years. The minimum age for students is sixteen years, and over 
four hundred are already evrolled. Your Board will almost make 
three permanent normal schools by helping me as liberally as 
possible this year. I fully expect to have them adopted and 
maintained by the lesgislature.””? 
The state no longer questioned the value of a teacher-training 
program, but it was not ready to establish and maintain a per- 
manent normal. It is interesting to notice how the state helped 
finance the county institutes for the next six years, beginning 
with 1893, also why this institute aid was discontinued. 
“At no time in the history of the state has the demand for good 
teachers been so prominent; and as a consequence the demand 
for better institutes and a real normal school has grown to be a 
dominating question. Two years ago I asked the legislature to 
aid this movement by creating and sustaining eight schools for 
both races, with terms extending from three to five months. The 
legislature enacted a law creating these schools and appropriating 
an annual stipend for their support. The following year these 
schools were opened at ten points in the state, and kept open for 
the required time. Six of them were devoted to the training of 
white teachers, and four to the blacks. * * * * 
“The ten district normal schools were successful, and did far 
more for the systematic training of six hundred teachers than all 
the short-term institutes that had ever been held. Still, they 
were not the thing needed. The second year the idea suggested 
itself to the superintendent of consolidating these five months’ 
schools in part into three Normal Schools, with a term of nine 
months and a course of study running through three years. 
“Another year passed away under this management, yielding 
still larger results. The Normal Schools were well attended 
for the full term. The attendance exceeded five hundred, of 
which the greater part took the first year’s course. Quite a num-

ber were qualified to take the second year’s work; and there 
were a few who took the third year’s work, and graduated. Fif- 
teen teachers were employed to do this work. 
“In addition to these schools three other schools were main- 
tained, with terms extending from three to five months, for 
whites and blacks, which were largely attended. 
“When the legislature met, I asked for an appropriation suffi- 
ciently large to maintain three permanent Normal Schools, with 
all appropriate legislation. The legislature denied my request, 
but registered its approval of the work by increasing the appro- 
priation for the district Normal Schools fifty per cent. I now 
propose to consolidate these schools again, and to maintain two 
schools for the whites, and a third one at some favorable point 
for the blacks—the term in each case to be nine months, and the 
course of study extending through three years. Two of these 
schools are already advertised, and will open the third Monday 
in: September, © /* > * * 
“A large number of County Institutes were held, with an 
attendance reaching the phenomenal number of five thousand, 
one hundred and three—fully ninety per cent of the teachers of 
the state. The movement for better schools is not only for- 
warded by the institutes and normal schools, but by a wise sys- 
tem of uniform examinations.’’! 
In 1894 there were nine-months normal schools held at Jones- 
boro and Morrilton. Each school got $1,450 to carry on this 
work. There were thirty-six graduates from these normals and 
all of them taught in 1895. The remainder of the state aid and 
Peabody Fund was used in conducting twelve district normals 
three months each, and a ten-day county institute in each county. 
Never before had the state carried out such a teacher-training 
program. 
“The state, at the last session of its legislature, appropriated 
ten thousand dollars per annum for two years for establishing 
a county: normal school of one month’s duration in each county 
of the state. Some of these normal schools were so crowded, I 
used a part of the Peabody Fund to supplement the state fund. 
The law allowed only one instructor to each normal school, to 
be paid from the state fund. The rural schools have been more 
benefited than ever before, and there have been awakened a 
thorough educational enthusiasm and zeal in every county. Each 
community where the normal schools were held took an earnest 
interest in the work. The reports and resolutions from all the 
counties showed an indorsement of the work and of the system 
far beyond my expectations. It was an experiment, but so posi-

tive and practical have been the results that those who heretofore 
opposed the normal work now give it their hearty support. Our 
reports show that seventy-five per cent of the teachers attended 
the normal schools, and they ask for a longer term of normal 
work next year. I hope, with assistance from the Peabody Fund, 
to have a five-weeks term hereafter, and in addition to carry 
on a state normal school for nine months. 
“The Jonesboro Normal School was organized with a force of 
three teachers; but, owing to a lack of patronage caused by local 
troubles, I discontinued the work of two teachers the second 
term and used the services of the principal alone for the remain- 
der of the time. The school worked through with twenty-five 
very interesting, hard-working, and promising teachers. The 
Prescott Normal School was continued two months under the 
management of Prof. W. C. Parham and two assistants. Sev- 
enty-two teachers attended, and the work was of the same high 
grade as at Jonesboro, embracing thorough academic and college 
training,” 
“Each county, save two, has had one month’s normal, as pro- 
vided by law, though in several the term was prolonged by the 
use of the Peabody Fund. The attendance of the county nor- 
mals in a majority of instances was so full that one, and some- 
times two, assistants were employed by the use of the Peabody 
Fund. The state law establishing county normals, appropriating 
$10,000 annually, authorized the employment of only one in- 
structor, and where the attendance was from 60 to 120, it was 
absolutely necessary to employ well-equipped help. The Peabody 
Fund enabled me to do this. By this means we secured a division 
of labor, better classification and system, and more efficient 
results. Without this help, fully one-fourth of the teachers would 
have been deprived of the proper normal instructions. Here the 
fund was most opportune and invaluable. * * * * TI also 
maintained a Peabody School of Methods for a month by the 
aid of this Fund. The success was gratifying; it being the first 
of this nature ever held in Arkansas, where the work was set 
forth by ‘model classes.’ 
“Tt is my pleasure to state that the normal work for the past 
two years has shown most gratifying results. Out of a regis- 
tered teaching force of 6,286 white and colored, in 1895, we had 
an attendance of 85 per cent. In 1896 this was increased to 90 
per cent. There seems to have been awakened an educational 
enthusiasm théughout the state, and citizens as well as teachers 
have shown #éal and interest in the work. ‘In each county the 
school patrons as well as members of the learned profession have

Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 21   
given attention to the system, and aid and encouragement to the 
teachers. It appears to me that our county normal system has. 
tended in a large degree towards the solution of the problem 
‘How to Improve Our Rural Schools.’ Last year we had sev- 
enty-four white normals and fifteen colored normals; this. 
year (1896) we have had seventy-five white normals and twenty- 
six colored normals, and patrons have given assurance every- 
where that their schools have improved greatly. 
“In addition to the new life and power given the teachers of 
the state by the county normal system, the people heretofore 
ignorant of the merits of normal schools have been educated to 
apreciate them. It has been truly an educational campaign for 
citizens as well as for teachers, and I believe that this has proved 
a necessary step towards securing the establishment, in the 
near future, of two permanent, well-organized and thoroughly 
equipped state normals, to last each year for a term of nine 
months.” 
“The legislature of 1897 continued for two years the appro- 
priation of ten thousand dollars per annum for the support of 
county institutes for white and thirty-three for colored teachers 
Were organized and conducted during the spring and su nmer. 
* * * It is now conceded that the county normal system: 
tie reached and benefited over 95 per cent of the regular active 
teachers in the common schools, Healthful instruction has reached 
that class of teachers who, by reason of their three months’ term 
and short wages, were unable to attend regularly organized nor- 
mal institutes elsewhere. It has also given them a systematic 
course.of study and improvement. It has taught the good teacher 
how to teach better, and the poor teacher how to improve him- 
self and teach well. It has given method and grading in com- 
mon school work, and established a uniform course of study, 
instruction, and teaching, when before all was confusion and 
heterogeneity in purpose and in action. * * * * 
“These good results are largely and primarily due to the steady 
and unfailing power infused into our educational world by the 
great philanthropist, Mr. George Peabody. His blessing came 
to the South at the time of her greatest need, and we gladly 
accord to hin and his agents the full measure of praise. His 
thought has engendered thought, his faith has inspired faith, and 
the gathering richness of years of useful expenditure is greeting 
us with bounding life and matchless results. These blessings 
have come to 80 per cent of the teachers and 8714 per cent of 
the children who live, study, and work in the rural schédls. The 
solution of the rural school problem we know lies in the efficiency   
tReport of Supt. Junius Jordan, 1896, Vol. V, pp. 216, 217.

22 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
of the teachers, and the Peabody Fund was the first agency estab- 
lished for their improvement. Arkansas has responded to the 
action of Mr. Peabody, and the teachers, who have so long been 
financially unable to help themselves, have had opportunities 
presented to them, and gladly have they availed themselves of 
the blessing. Should the donations be centralized in the future, 
the country schools must suffer a paralyzing influence. The 
greatest good to the greatest number is being accomplished by 
the present system, and should the trust be discontinued and 
made into endowments of central institutions in state and else- 
where, then the majority of the teachers and pupils in the South 
will be deprived of the blessings they are now receiving. States, 
too, would to some extent be inclined to centralize their appro- 
priations, and thus the well conditioned and already prosperous 
teacher would secure the results, while his more unfavored 
brother in the country would become the victim of indifference 
and discontent and 8714 per cent of the children suffer from this 
impoverishment. Save the country from such discouraging and 
dangerous conditions. Continue the trust in the future as in the 
past along the same lines, and the sunlight of education will soon 
flood the valleys and illumine the hilltops of the country at 
large: * 
“The state law setting aside ten thousand dollars per annum 
for two years to maintain in each county summer normal schools 
of one month’s session each, for the white teachers and for the 
colored teachers, enabled us to continue the work in 1898 with 
increased energy and satisfaction. * * * * 
“The conductors of the county normals were carefully selected 
from experienced workers and, in most instances, assistance was 
required, as the attendance was too large for one instructor to 
handle. A uniform system of instruction was put in the hands 
of each teacher, and a thorough system established. A system 
of study for the teachers was likewise presented, and a plan for 
grading country schools. Instructions were given as to school 
architecture and sanitation. The normals were graded, usually 
in three departments—primary, grammar, and academic—and an 
instructor placed in charge of each division. The work was 
thus made not only methodical, but logical and practical. In 
furtherance of this system of enlargement, and in continuing the 
schools in many cases for a longer term than one month, as 
urged by the teachers, the Peabody Fund was an invaluable help. 
It enabled this department to employ special workers, and to 
present, through model classes, the schoolroom work as it should 
be carried on. The value of the county normal system has bee 
evidenced in many ways: First, an elevation of the standard of 
*Report of Supt. Junius Jordan, 1897, Vol. V, pp, 264-267.
-P-A-G-E-23

teaching and the arousing of a professional spirit. Second, in- 
creased efficiency in the rural school teacher. Third, unity of 
plans and purposes in state educational work. Fourth, systematic 
organization and grading of the majority of the country schools. 
Fifth, improved school rooms and healthier activity and zeal on 
the part of the public. Sixth, an education of the voter, by pre- 
senting to him the teaching force of his county: He could insti- 
tute comparisons, and know the necessity for improving the 
teachers. Seventh, the promotion of the spirit of harmony 
between the: races. ~~. +) ae 
“The county normal system in Arkansas, aided by the Peabody 
Fund, has done more than any other agency for improving the 
teaching force. The larger number of our country schools have 
only a three-months session, and professionally trained teachers 
cannot afford to accept these insufficient rewards for their ser- 
vices. The thorough graduates in technical normal schools must 
seek employment in the city schools, where the pay will be com- 
mensurate with their outlay for self-improvement. The fact 
confronts us that 8714 per cent of our common schools must con- 
tinue to employ the teacher who can afford to teach a short term 
at a low salary and afterwards engage in other work in the sup- 
port of himself and family. It is thus left to the state to con- 
sider how at least 8714 per cent of her teachers and children can 
be improved to such an extent as will keep us from falling 
behind the general spirit of progressive education. The best 
method yet devised is to bring these advantages to the teachers, 
not as a right due them, but as a patriotic duty to the children. 
The education needed should be based upon a proper conception 
of the pupil’s relation, obligation, and destiny in the common- 
wealth. This is to be effected by efficient agencies, and the state 
must provide these for every child within its borders. There is 
no question that the Peabody Fund was the first instrumen- 
tality that enabled the state to reach down into the masses and 
seek to establish better types and stronger personalities in 
teachers. The results called forth new and more impassioned 
energies on the part of the state.’ 
“Permit me, in the name of the citizens of Arkansas interested 
in education, and of the teachers who are alive to the needs of 
our state along this line, and, consequently, are striving to ren- 
der themselves more proficient, to thank the Trustees for the aid 
extended in the Peabody appropriation. 
“While our legislature, at its last session, failed to make any 
appropriation for the maintenance of summer normals, it must 
not be concluded that the majority were not deeply interested in 
the success of our schools, and were not willing to do all that 
3Report of Supt. Junius Jordan, 1898, Vol. V, pp. 315-317.

24 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
seemed to them best for the support and advancement of the 
same. Many causes militated against the renewal of the appro- 
priation; especially were three elements at work potently: The 
politician, the demagogue, and the low-grade teacher. In the 
four years past, in which the state set to work to aid the teachers 
in self-improvement, and required that they take advantage of 
this assistance and attend the summer normals, the grading of 
teachers has undergone quite a change for the better. Thus in 
1895, the first year of the summer normals, there were in the 
state 3,074 first-grade teachers; in 1898 this number had been 
increased nearly 1,000. Our state contains seventy-five counties. 
Owing to the limited fund at my disposal, it was impossible to 
hold an institute in each county, and thus the counties were 
grouped as nearly as practicable into twos, and a place, con- 
veniently situated. was selected in each of the thirty-four groups 
for the institutes for white teachers, with an enrollment of 1,547, 
and in the fifteen groups for colored teachers, with an enroll- 
ment of 761. To each of these institutes a competent instructor 
“was sent, who for five days conducted the work after an outline 
prepared by the Department. 
“T found the teachers active and interested, and in each of the 
forty-nine institutes resolutions indorsing the institute, and 
thanking you for the kindness shown, were passed. In many 
counties in which no Peabody Institute was held, the teachers 
arranged for institutes to be paid for by them, while in several 
counties in which these Peabody Institutes were held the session 
was extended to two, three and, in some instances, four weeks, 
the teachers bearing the additional expense. This determined 
effort on their part to do for themselves, at a sacrifice, what the 
state had been doing for them, augurs well for their success in 
their profession. The legislature appropriated for the Branch 
Normal School at Pine Bluff for the next two years, $9,300, and 
for the Normal Department at the University $4,250.”! 
“In submitting my report of the institute work in this state, 
permit me again to assure you of the high appreciation that the 
teachers of Arkansas and the people generally feel for this gen- 
erous aid. In addition to the Peabody Institute held in forty- 
one counties for white teachers, and twelve for colored teachers, 
many counties not so favored held private institutes and employed 
instructors who were paid for their services by the teachers 
themselves. In many instances the Peabody Institutes were ex- 
tended from one to three weeks by the same means. I feel sure 
that the interest manifested shows an improvement. 
“x x %* * We hope that the next legislature will provide 
*Report of Supt. J. J. Doyne, 1899, Vol. V, pp. 373, 374,

for county superintendency, a State Normal School, and an 
increase in school revenues.’”? 
“TI regret that I have no special report to make to you this 
year, owing to the fact that the Peabody aid was withdrawn from 
the state on account of the failure of our legislature to make 
any appropriation for summer normal work for the present year. 
Through the earnest effort of our county examiners, however, 
the teachers were given the advantage of short-term institutes 
under competent instructors, the teachers themselves bearing the 
expense of the same. The reports from these institutes are en- 
couraging, and the sentiment is more than ever before in favor 
of trained teachers. In these institutes there were enrolled about 
4,000 teachers, while the attendance of those who were not 
teachers, but who were simply interested in the work, was 
unusually large.’ 
“Dr. Curry (Secretary Board of Trustees, Peabody Education 
Fund) informs Superintendent Doyne that he will help us just 
this once more in giving money to carry on summer institute 
work: for our teachers, and then if our people and the teachers 
themselves do not show more interest in tiese institutes and 
make provision for carrying on such work, then further appro- 
priations will be withheld.”? 
“The institute has been, and will be, the training school toy 
many of our public school teachers in Arkansas. * * * 
The institute is the only opportunity for professional instruc- 
tion within reach of the great mass of our teachers.’ 
“To the Teachers of the State: (May 30, 1903.) 
“Information has just been received that the Peabody Board 
has granted a small appropriation for teachers’ institutes in 
this state, and notice is hereby given that institutes of ten days’ 
duration will be held at Jonesboro, Arkadelphia, Morrilton, Mon- 
ticello, and Mena, beginning at 9 o’clock on the morning of 
June 3. 
“The assignment of conductors of institutes for white teachers 
is as follows: 
“Jonesboro, J. H. Witherspoon and W. H. Watkins: Monti- 
cello, D. T. Rogers and W. A. Crawford; Arkadelphia, J. D.

26 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
In 1904 the institutes were put back on the “self-supporting” 
basis. The following action taken by the teachers of Yell county, 
1904, shows an interest that was common to a large number of _ 
counties: “At the teachers’ institute at Danville, June, 1904, a 
“resolution was adopted recommending that the teachers of Yell 
county arrange for a four weeks’ normal in June, 1905. A com- 
mittee was appointed to raise funds, select a place, set a date for 
beginning, hire an instructor, and make all necessary arrange- 
ments. This committee employed Prof. W. D. Crawford, presi- 
dent of the Ozark Normal, at Green Forest, Carroll county, 
Arkansas, to give us twenty days’ instruction, beginning May 
29, 1905, at Rover.” 
In 1905 the examiner of Jackson county made the following 
report to the state superintendent: “You will see that there 
were twenty-five teachers who did not attend the institute. I 
revoked the licenses of sixteen of them, they having not presented 
excuses which seemed reasonable to me. Since the meeting of 
the institute I have reinstated four of them, as they have since 
the revocation filed with me reasonable excuses in writing for 
non-attendance.” (State Superintendent’s Biennial Report, 1905- 
1906, p. 81.) 
The following institute suggestions from the state superin- 
tendent, John H. Hinemon, 1906, to the county examiners, will 
help one to understand the aim of the institute: “It is intended 
that each teacher shall be furnished a copy of this outline of 
institute work. The outline will not only be of service during 
institute work, but it will greatly aid earnest teachers who will 
use it as a guide and test of their work in the school room. 
“Tt is particularly desired that the grading of schools accord- 
ing to the state course of study be fully and clearly explained 
to all teachers at the institute, so that it may be intelligently and 
effectually used in every district school in the state.”

“At the present the only summer training schools for our 
teachers in their respective counties are the five-day county exam- 
iners’ institutes provided by law, except where the teachers them- 
selves pay for a longer term by subscription. 
“These institutes have been popularized to a great extent 
through the enactment authorizing county exa uiners to renew 
certificates for an attendance of not less than three days by the 
teachers. This has resulted in the teachers, desiring their licenses 
renewed, attending these institutes for at least three days. How- 
ever, the question has arisen whether so brief an attendance in 
training schools gives the state sufficient returns in added effi- 
ciency of its teachers to justify the extension of licenses. Indeed, 
it seems that the working of this provision, in some instances, 
has been a subterfuge to permit teachers of doubtful qualifica- 
tion to continue with licenses.” 
During the last ten years, 1915-1925, the State Department of 
Education has been especially active in promoting the county 
institute program. The field workers have not only gone in per- 
son to conduct the institutes, but they have often helped the coun- 
ties to secure primary teachers who conducted demonstration 
schools for the entire five days. ° wowdd+

CHaApPTER IV 
THE INFLUENCE OF STATE TEACHERS’ 
ASSOCIATION 
The State Teachers’ Association was organized in 1869 and 
has since that time had a continuous existence. It has done much 
to promote the cause of education. Its annual resolutions for 
normal schools, for better trained teachers, for more supervision, 
for more revenue, for longer terms, better school houses, etc., 
have served to keep before the people high educational stan- 
dards toward which the state should strive. 
For many years the state was divided into four sections and 
in each section there was a teachers’ association. The Arkansas 
School Officers’ Association was organized in 1901. This organ- 
ization lived only a few years, but it did much toward the estab- 
lishment of a state normal. 
“Just a few days after the last session of the Northeast Arkan- 
sas Teachers’ Association there was held at Little Rock the sec- 
ond annual session of the Arkansas School Officers’ Association. 
Here was assembled the flower of Arkansas’ educators. * * * 
These veterans recognized many defects in our educational 
system.” 
“Other sectional associations have seen fit to disband, but the 
teachers of the northeast and eastern division are so intensely 
loyal to their association that they purpose to keep it growing 
in usefulness and power. * * * * The next meeting will 
be held at Searcy on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of Thanks- 
giving week, 1905.” 
This Northeast Association soon went the way of the others 
and all joined in one state-wide association. In the year 1921 the 
membership of the Arkansas Educational Association reached 
8,000. In view of this it is interesting to recall that in 1901 there 
was a great effort made to reach a membership of 300, but the 
goal was not reached. 
The following historical outline of meetings, taken from an- 
nual reports of the Arkansas Educational Association, is an 
indication of the continuous efforts which this association has 
put forth for higher school standards.

CHAPTER V 
PRIVATE “NORMAL” SCHOOLS 
In 1853 Arkansas began to examine and certificate her 
teachers. From that time until the establishment of the State 
Normal, 1908, the state was full of schools offering “normal 
work” to teachers. One of the most common meanings for “nor- 
mal work” prior to 1908 was a review of the common school 
branches for the purpose of preparing the student to pass the 
teachers’ examination. As a rule the county examiner taught 
in the “normal school.” Sometimes he was the principal. There 
were usually other schools in the county where “normal work” 
could be had, but, things being equal, the prospective teacher 
selected the school where she could be in classes taught by the 
county examiner. 
Not many of these schools kept permanent records, and none 
of them kept continuous records. In fact, not many of these 
schools continued long. It often happened that the newly elected 
county judge appointed a new -county examiner. This usually 
meant the birth of a new “normal school” and the dwindling 
away of another. 
The following data were taken from reports which these 
schools made either to the State Department of Education or to 
the United States Commissioner of Education. So far as was 
possible to obtain, they include all the teachers that received 
training from 1893 to 1903, inclusive. As teacher-training insti- 
tutions, the first seven still hold important places.

  This period was taken for no special reason. Another period 
would show some different schools. Some of the schools named 
above would also be seen in another period, but the general lack 
of a state-controlled teacher training program would be as evident 
as it is in the period taken. 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
82 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
Twenty-five years ago such statements as the following were 
not uncommon: 
“Under the management of Prof. B. H. Caldwell, the Pea 
Ridge Normal College of Pea Ridge, Ark., has become the largest 
normal and business college in the state. Normal, classical, 
scientific courses, bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting, etc., not 
surpassed by any business college. Strong faculty of teachers 
in charge. Three hundred students enrolled last year—a large 
increase this vear. Those who wish to attend where many 
teachers attend should enter this school. Take the teachers’ 
course, prepare yourself professionally, and know how, what 
and when to teach. Take three students with you and your 
tuition will cost you nothing. Teachers’ course, $2.00 a month. 
Board, room, heat and light in private families, $8.00 a month. 
This school was chartered in 1894.” 
In 1871 the state, for the purpose of training colored teachers, 
established the Branch Normal at Pine Bluff. Apparently there 
was no opposition to it, but in the main the teacher-training pro- 
gram for white teachers had to mark time until 1908. There 
were so many “tuition” schools in the state that offered “normal 
training” to teachers that it was difficult to create a real demand 
for a “free” state normal school. 
A SUMMARY OF PART ONE 
1. Prior to 1853, teachers were not certificated. The church 
was the greatest factor in determining the qualification of 
teachers. 
2. 1867 is to be remembered as the year in which Arkansas 
first provided for a school tax. This same legislature provided 
for the first State Superintendent of Public Instruction. There 
has been some form of county organization since 1853. 
3. For almost a half century, prior to 1908, the normal insti- 
tute was the state’s “‘teacher-training school.” 
4. Since 1869 the State Teachers’ Association has had an 
important part in Arkansas’ school program. 
5. The state has never lacked for schools that offered “normal 
courses.” These normal courses have, for the most part, been 
reviews in the common school branches.

PART TWO 
ROWTH OF’PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND THE 
INCREASING DEMAND FOR MORE 
TEACHERS 
Cuaprter VI 
A’ GRADUAL GROWTH OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL 
SYSTEM 
In Part One we studied the forces that brought about a demand 
for. better teachers. In Part Two we are to study, briefly, the 
development of “free” schools and the demand for more teachers. 
In 1843 the legislature provided for a public school system, 
but made no provision whereby the people could tax themselves 
for school purposes. Each township was authorized to sell the 
sixteenth section, to invest the proceeds in a permanent school 
fund, and to use the income for establishing schools. The income 
was so small that the good system could not operate. 
We have already noticed Arkansas’ first “free school act,” 
1867. The ‘rebel’ legislature was bold enough to pass a law 
taxing the people for school purposes. The new Constitution 
of 1868 provided for a free school system. The Constitution of 
1874 kept the free school idea and the legislatures have made it 
possible for the people to vote on themselves a school tax. 
The public school systen has always had its enemies. We 
can better understand our present problems by studying some of 
the early struggles of the public school system. Much could be 
written on the problems that have confronted the school people 
in every year since 1867, but we shall study conditions as they 
existed in the 70’s and in 1880. To see the problems we quote 
from three sources: (1) Reports made by county superin- 
| tendents to the State Department of Education, 1880 ;* (2) Reso- 
| lutions of the State Teachers’ Association, 1880, and (3) A 
statement made by State Superintendent J. L. Denton, 1880. 
“Tn common with the views held by the masses in Arkansas, 
the people of Lonoke county, upon its organization in 1873, 
regarded the public school law almost as an imposition and a 
nuisance. They considered the tax levied for general school pur- 
poses unjust and oppressive. They regarded the salary paid the 
county superintendent as so much money wasted. Such a thing 
as voting a special tax for the support of public schools was 
almost unknown.* * * * Very few took any interest in pub- 
*These are taken from State Superintendent's Report. 1880.

  lic school affairs, or voted at annual school elections. Pubs 
schools were considered as tending to injure private schools. In 
some cases communities felt that the conduct of their teachers, 
both of public and private schools, was inconsistent with the 
character desired in those proposing to elevate the youth of the 
land to a noble manhood. Hence, teachers did not have the 
influence with the people which their position demanded.” 
“This was the state of affairs when the school law of 1875 
was adopted. From that time till 1878 the growth of interest in 
public education was slow but deeply rooted. A hindrance to 
its more rapid growth was the fact that some of our principal 
teachers, having been educated in private institutions, were un- 
able, perhaps, fully to appreciate the necessity of educating the 
masses.” 
“There is a growing demand for a better class of teachers, text- 
beoks and school houses in the country districts. More sym- 
pathy is being felt for the orphan and the children of the indi- 
gent. It is coming to be understood that public schools, properly 
conducted, can be made better than private schools. The more 
intelligent class of voters is coming to understand that the 
perpetuity of this republic and the independence of the nation, 
depends upon whether or not the masses are educated.” 
‘oe 3 % * For the year ending June 30, 1880, there was 
employed in this school (Lonoke) five teachers, and three hun- 
dred and seven pupils were enrolled.’ 
“In the year 1870 there were only about ten or twelve school 
districts in this county, with bounds not known to half the peo- 
ple who resided in them. Many things conspired to make the 
system obnoxious to our people, and it continued so until long 
after a new state of affairs was established. * * * * I 
think a few live and energetic first-class teachers would develop 
a great deal of interest among the people. * * *  *”2 
“The system has been started in an entirely new ground, and. 
therefore, is encumbered with some disadvantages. The chief 
difficulty is the want of good and efficient teachers, and a proper 
recognition of such by directors and communities. Added to 
this, just at this time, when the system needs most careful and 
skillful oversight, the county examiner has no means of visiting 
and influencing the districts of his county. I am confident that 
a very marked improvement would be effected by paying the 
county examiner a small salary, and by requiring him to visit the 
districts of his county.

tion, and where other circumstances are more favorable, far bet- 
ter results have been reached. There are employed in the city 
schools one superintendent, thirty-three teachers and two -special 
teachers. The city school property is valued at about $60,000. 
The school board is now receiving bids for the erection of a very 
handsome and convenient building. It is estimated that this 
building will cost about $20,000.”1 
“Much of the success of the free school system in this county 
is due to the fact that it is a permanency, made so by a Constitu- 
tion adopted by the votes of the people themselves. Much oppo- 
sition at first came from private institutions of learning and their 
patrons. Many persons thought free schools more expensive and 
not so efficient as private schools, but it is being demonstrated 
that the private school and the free school can work in har- 
mony.’”? 
“I have to report that the public school system of the state 
is gradually growing in favor with the better class of people. 
Many intelligent persons, formerly opposed to the system, 
have ceased their opposition, others become cordial co-operators 
Wor te oF eo 
  “T can safely say that the free school system in this county is 
growing in favor. Last year only about one-half the districts 
voted a special school tax. This year about three-fourths of all 
the districts voted the tax. The schools are taught, as a gen- 
eral thing, by better teachers and at better salaries than formerly. 
Many of the schools continue six months in the year. I think 
the interest in free schools will continue to grow.’ 
“Several years ago the school districts of this county were run 
in debt by paying exorbitant salaries to teachers. Salaries 
ranged from $75 to $150 per month. This squandering of the 
school revenues was under the circuit superintendency. It dis- 
couraged the people greatly. A school taught at Perryville for 
ten months cost so much that it took the district eight years to 
pay out. The people were so disgusted with the condition of 
things that they refused to vote a special tax. 
“We are now out of debt, I am glad to say, with some money 
in the treasury, and have voted the district tax twice. This year 
there were seventeen public and ten private schools in the county. 
Four years ago one public and two private schools were taught 
in the county. I am of the opinion that county examiners-should 
_have supervisory control of the schools, and that they should be 
required to visit the schools of their respective counties. An

amendment to this effect would be w The school law does 
not need any material change. ,The people are just beginning to 
understand it, and to know how to work under it.””+ 
  “The people are more interested in education. Many districts 
that heretofore yoted no tax for school purposes, voted the tax 
cheerfully this year. Men who always opposed free schools have 
become enlightened on the subject, and are assisting in the great 
work of educating the children. 
“In the spring of 1876, when I entered upon the duties of 
county examiner, I found few schools, and no éncouragement. 
1 was met by opposition on every hand. Opposition has gradually 
yielded, and popular interest has taken its place. A few years 
ago we had no school houses; now we have a neat building in 
almost every community. The educational spark that a few years 
ago was almost extinguished, has, been kindled into a blaze of 
enthusiasm,” 
  “At the beginning of the year 1878 there were but few schools 
in good working order, the large majority having refused to vote 
a tax, and the revenues derived from the state were insufficient 
to maintain the schools. 
“* % %* * The amounts spent in maintenance of schools 
for the past five years are as follows: 
1876.

“The number of schools taught in the year, 
1878 was 23, with 23 teachers 
1879 was 37, with 43 teachers

“There is one graded public school in the county, located at 
Conway, which, in the present year, has sent to the rural dis- 
tricts nine teachers fron among its pupils, most of whom have 
succeeded in the schools admirably, and are living testimonials 
to the people that the children of Faulkner county can be edu- 
cated and trained in the public schools of the state.’ 
  “Four years ago there was considerable opposition to free 
schools; now, if they have an enemy in the county I am not 
aware of the fact.”4

“After a careful retrospect of the public schools of this county, 
a steady increase in their favor has constantly prevailed up to 
the present time. At no time do I find they were ever regarded 
with disfavor by the masses, but, on the contrary, fostered and 
encouraged. * * * * At the last annual school meeting a 
more liberal school tax was voted for building purposes, more 
generally, in the different school districts, than heretofore. * * 
Record the fact that Crawford county is all right on the subject 
of free schools.” 
The reports from many other counties could be given, but they 
do not differ materially from those given above. 
The committee on resolutions, State Teachers’ Association, 
1880, submitted the following resolutions, which were adopted: 
“Resolved, That we regard the common schools, the norma! 
schools and the University as parts of the public school system 
of the state, and also concede to the private schools, academies 
and colleges an appropriate and dignified place in our educational 
work. We, therefore, deem it possible, and of the greatest im- 
portance, that the entire educational system of the state be 
reduced to more perfect harmony. * * * * 
“Resolved, That a system of county normal institutes, regu- 
lated and controlled by law, will contribute much to the cultiva- 
tion and training of teachers, and to the improvement and eleva- 
tion of the district schools; and we earnestly recommend that, 
as soon as possible, they shall be provided for as a part of our 
school system, under the supervision of the Superintendent of 
Public Instruction. 
“Resolved, That the maintenance of training schools, and of 
the higher education, directly promotes the interests of primary 
and district school education, and that it is, therefore, economical 
and wise to appropriate liberally for the support of normal 
schools and the State University.” (S. T. A. Proceedings, 1880.) 
State Superintendent J. L. Denton, 1880, makes the following 
statement (Biennial Report, 1880, p. 54): 
“A serious blunder is sometimes made in the election of direc- 
tors. Careless and incompetent men are put into this responsible 
office, and the most sacred interests suffer. Men avowedly hos- 
tile to free schools, sometimes maneuver for places on the school 
boards, that they may the more effectually stab the cause. They 
must surrender their self-respect before adopting a mode of war- 
fare so dishonorable. If they want to array themselves against 
the peace and welfare of society let them have the manliness to 
employ more honorable tactics.   
4Crawford County, John J. Burrow, Examiner, p. 30. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
“A wakeful popular interest is the cure for this evil. The 
people have the remedy in their own hands. Let them feel suf- 
ficient solicitude for the prosperity of the schools to use nice 
discrimination in the choice of officers. Directors should not only 
be zealous advocates and earnest defenders of the free school 
policy, but they should be men of fair intelligence—the more the 
better-—sound judgment, strong common sense, progressive views 
and business experience. The school affairs of many districts 
are thrown into chaos by indifference and mismanagement. 
“Much friction is caused in the practical operations of the 
school system by looseness and irregularities in transacting school 
business. Directors frequently sign contracts in their individual 
capacity—at home, in the field, and in the store, in the street, at 
the school house or on the highway—or two directors sign, with- 
out the knowledge of the third, and strife and litigation ensue. 
A majority of the directors can transact business if the third has 
received proper notice. The law contemplates action by the di- 
rectors in their aggregate capacity, when duly and properly 
assembled. Neither two nor all of the directors acting sepa- 
rately can bind the district. All business should be transacted 
in regular meetings of the board.” 
The foregoing statements enable one to see that interest in 
public education fifty years ago was lagging. We have seen 
how the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund helped Arkan- 
sas to carry out an institute program. Table, page 37, shows how 
the trustees of this same fund came at a most opportune time 
and gave aid to public education in Arkansas. During the sev- 
enties the idea of free schools had many influential enemies, but 
that was only one of the hindrances. The war and reconstruc- 
tion still held an important place in the minds of the people. A 
few citizens were able to aid in public education, but too often 
they were unwilling to do so. Many were willing to help sup- 
port public education, but were unable to do so. This fund was 
given to help pay teachers’ salaries, but it was not given until 
the towns made a strong effort to have free schools.

During the last half century the population of Arkansas has 
increased almost 300 per cent. The question naturally arises, 
has our public school system kept pace with this growth? The 
following data will answer the question (no races omitted) :

These data were taken from the United States census reports 
and from the biennial reports of the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction. In the main they are self-explanatory. The 
poor showing for 1880 has already been explained. Since that 
time there has been a steady growth. The decrease in the per- 
centage of men teachers is in keeping with that throughout the 
United States. It is encouraging to notice the increase of per- 
centage in men teachers during the last four years. The steady 
increase in the length of school term is encouraging’ and the

average term of 131 days looks good until we realize that in 1920, 
when Arkansas had an average term of 126 days, the United 
States as a whole had an average term of 164 days. 
The gain that has been made since 1920, in enrollment, average 
daily attendance, and length of term, shows that the public school 
system is steadily growing. We see, too, that during the last 
four years an average of 400 teachers have been added to the 
state’s teaching force annually. In making the state teacher 
training program, this annual increase must be considered. 
These additional teachers cause only a small part of the annual 
demand for teachers. 
The next chapter is devoted to a study of the state’s annual 
need for new teachers.

PART TWO Crapter VII 
THE PRESENT DEMAND FOR NEW TEACHERS 
I. The Demand in Rural Schools. 
According to the U. S. Census of 1920, Arkansas is 83 per 
cent rural. Of the 2,192 beginning teachers employed in Arkan- 
sas for the school year 1924-25, 1,768, or 85 per cent, of them 
were employed in the rural schools. It is not enough to know 
the number of new teachers employed annually in the rural 
schools, but the question naturally arises, how many teachers 
are needed for each kind of position in the rural school sys- 
tem? The excellent co-operation on the part of the county 
superintendents has made it possible to answer this question. 
In November, 1924, after all teachers had been employed, the 
questionnaire given below was sent to each of the seventy-five 
county superintendents. Seventy-four of them answered all, the 
questions found in the following questionnaire:

Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 43   
We are interested here in replies made to questions a, b, c, and 
d, under 1. In the seventy-four counties, 7,236 rural teachers 
were employed for the year 1924-1925. 1,784, or 24.6 per cent, 
of these were new teachers. They were employed in the fol- 
lowing positions:

The need for rural teachers in any one year may be mis- 
leading. Therefore the county superintendents were asked to 
give their number of new teachers employed for each of the 
past two years, and the number which they expect for the year 
1925-1926. Many of them admitted that their number of new 
teachers for next year was more or less guesswork, but all sev- 
enty-four of them gave estimates. With but few exceptions the 
county superintendent had been in the county for three or more 
years. This, with their records, made it possible for them to 
tell the number of new teachers employed in 1922-1923 and 
1923-1924. Those who had not been in the county three years 
found records that made it possible to give these data fairy accu- 
rately. The sum of their replies regarding the number of new 
teachers for four years gives the following results:

2. The Demand in Town and City Schools 
As we study the needs for new teachers in towns and cities, 
we shall keep in mind that we are dealing with only 17% of 
Arkansas’ population. This study has been made to find out 
the number of new teachers that towns and cities need annually 
(1) in grades one through four, (2) in grades five through 
- eight, and (3) in the high schools. 
To secure these data a questionnaire was sent to sixty-two town 
and city superintendents. These represented the only schools 
not included in the report made by the county superintendents. 
All sixty-two towns and cities replied except Little Rock and 
Eureka Springs. In these two systems there are a little more 
than 300 white teachers. 
In November, 1924, after all the teachers had been employed, 
the following questionnaire was sent to each of the sixty-two 
superintendents :

  46 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
The need for town and city teachers in any one year may be 
misleading, therefore the superintendents were asked to give 
the number of new teachers which they employed for each of 
the past two years, and the number they expect next year. The 
sixty superintendents answered the questions regarding the new 
teachers for the years 1922-23 and 1923-24. Only fifty-seven 
estimates of their new teachers for 1925-26 were made. Three 
said they had no way of estimating. 
A summary of all sixty replies, regarding the new teachers 
for each of the four years, is as follows:

  Little Rock. which is not included in this study, has 313 
teachers, divided as follows: 187 in grades 1-6, 78 in junior 
high school, and 48 in senior high school. It has been shown 
for the year 1924-25 that 16 per cent of the lower grade teachers, 
20 per cent of the upper grade teachers, and 34 per cent of the 
high school teachers are new. If these percentages hold true for 
Little Rock she has employed about 62 new teachers, divided as 
follows: 31 in lower grades, 15 in upper grades, and 16 in high 
school. It is conservative to say that each year the towns and 
cities of Arkansas employ 400 new teachers. This number added 
to the 1,900 rural teachers makes a total of 2,300 new teachers 
that Arkansas employs annually. 
Keeping in mind the fact that since 1920 the state’s teaching 
force has been increasing at the rate of about 400 teachers 
annually, it is conservative to say that Arkansas needs 2,500 new 
teachers annually. 
‘To what extent is the state prepared to train 2,500 teachers? 
To answer this question we shall make a brief study of all insti- 
tutions in Arkansas that claim to train teachers.

Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 47   
PART THREE 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
The second part of the questionnaires to both county and city 
superintendents show that the 2,300 new teachers are secured 
from the State University, the State Teachers’ College, the four 
state agricultural schools, the thirteen state normal training 
high schools, the church colleges, and by examinations. The 
purpose of Part Three is to show how they are helping the state 
to meet her teacher-training problem. 
Cuapter VIII 
THE STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF 
EDUCATION 
The University of Arkansas was established 1872, and since 
that time it has done much toward the professional development 
of teachers in Arkansas. The Board of Trustees provided a 
normal department in 1872. So far as the records show, this 
department has had a continuous existence, but its influence was 
felt very little until near the close of the nineteenth century. 
Some people object to looking at their baby pictures, but the 
following is a picture of the “College of Education” fifty years 
ago. “The literary requirements for admission are not high, but 
they embrace a thorough knowledge of the four fundamental 
rules of arithmetic, with decimal fractions, ability to read well 
in the fourth reader, a knowledge of primary English grammar 
and geography, the rudiments of penmanship, and the ability 
to spell ordinary words of the grade of the fourth reader. The 
course of study covering four years in addition to instruction 
in the branches taught in the public schools, includes training in 
the methods of instruction, in organizing and governing schools, 
and in the legal duties of teachers. Fifty-six are reported in the 
normal department.” 
In his biennial report, 1883-84, page 15, the United States Com- 
missioner of Education reported that the normal department was 
alropped. The University records are meager, but they do not 
show that this was done. Relative to this period, Professor J. R. 
Jewell, Dean of the College of Education, says: “A search 
through the records of the University as far back as 1884 indi- 
cates that the Normal Department was not dropped at any tine. 
It is not possible to tell from the old records how many students 
were taking that work.” 
1Report U. S. Commissioner of Education, 1882, p. 11.
-P-A-G-E-48
45 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
“No normal school has yet been established in Arkansas. 
Under the late reorganization of the University there is some hope 
of a Normal Department for the training of white teachers.”! 
Dr. Junius Jordan was head of the Department of Philosophy, 
Psychology, and Education from 1898 to 1902. During these 
years the United States Bureau of Education reports the fol- 
lowing annual enrollments in the Normal Department: 1898, 6; 
1899, 14; 1900, 16; 1901, 18; 1902, 21. 
The present efficiency of the College of Education had its 
beginning in 1902, when Dr. W. S. Johnson became head of the 
“Department of Philosophy and Education.” He served in this 
capacity for eleven years. By request Dr. Johnson has made the 
following statement relative to the Normal Department from 
1902 to 1913: 
“When I went there I inherited six students in the Department 
of Pedagogy. The first year I was there I established the training 
school by charging a tuition fee, and put Miss Gussie Nelkin, 
from the Louisiana State Normal, in charge. After a couple of 
years it was changed to support by the state and I employed Miss 
Rose Bland, who was in charge of the department when I left 
the University in 1913. 
“We started in with having only four primary grades, giving 
the cadet teachers the usual daily training work and gradually 
increased it until we had one year of the high school work when 
1 left. 
“The year before I left I got in correspondence with the sec- 
retary of the Peabody Fund and got them to build the educational 
building, which is there at the present time. 
“Beginning with six pupils in the L. I. course, the first year, 
1902, the enrollment continued to increase every year until in 
1912, the last year that I was actively in charge of the depart- 
ment, we enrolled 237 students, a little over one-third of the 
students attending. the University at that time, which also 
included some of the preparatory department.” 
Dr. J. R. Jewell succeeded Dr. W. S. Johnson, and under his 
management the Department of Education has developed into a 
standard College of Education. The emphasis has gradually 
shifted from training elementary teachers to the training of high 
school teachers and administrators. The training school is now 
limited to the junior and senior high school grades. 
The Fayetteville Daily Democrat, June 12, 1922, has an article 
on the Development and Work of the College of Education, by 
Dean Jewell. It says in part:   
1Report for Peabody Education Fund, 1885, Vol. III, p. 224.
-P-A-G-E-49
  
Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 49   
“Until the year 1913-14, at which time the trustees of the 
University of Arkansas decided to make the Department of Edu- 
cation a separate division of the University, that department had 
been maintained with a personnel consisting of an assistant pro- 
fessor and two instructors, though for some time previous to this 
they had a staff consisting of a full professor and assistant pro- 
fessor and an instructor. In the fall of 1913 Dr. J. R. Jewell was 
elected Professor of Education and Psychology and was given the 
responsibility for the reorganization of all the work in that 
department. Up to that time the number of courses offered had 
been limited to eight and the amount of work in all these courses 
together amounted to twenty hours. 
“By the end of that year (1913-14) the Department of Educa- 
tion had been elevated into a School of Education and a‘year 
later it was made one of the integral colleges of the University 
with a complete four-year course. By the inclusion of Professor 
J. R. Grant, who had up to this time had the title of Assistant 
Professor of Philosophy, the personnel of the faculty was 
brought up to six. A year later Professor A. M. Jordan came into 
the department from DePauw University as instructor in psychol- 
ogy. For some years Professor B. W. Torreyson, at that time 
State High School Inspector, was technically a member of the 
departmenta! faculty, although he gave courses in residence only 
during the summer schools. 
“In the fall of 1917 the University of Arkansas was made a 
teacher-training institution for Smith-Hughes teachers for the 
entire state, and during the ensuing year full professors were 
added in agricultural education, home economics education and 
education in trades and industries. 
“That part of the life of the University given over to the 
training of teachers, that for such a large part of the fifty years 
of its existence functioned as a department, has grown until it 
now includes full professors of Education, Psychology, Sec- 
ondary Education, School Administration, Teacher-Training, 
Home Economics Education, Education in Trades and Indus- 
tries, and Agricultural Education, an Associate Professor of Agri- 
cultural Education, an Assistant Professor of Education, three 
instructors in Education, and two instructors in Home Economics 
Education. The students of the College of Education number 
approximately 200, while almost as many more students of the 
colleges of the University are doing elective work in that depart- 
ment. The total number of courses offered by them now exceeds 
forty. The Department of Education is now one of the three 
most popular departments in the entire University in the number 
of correspondence courses being taken, from it by students over 
the state‘at large’ °“* * * *
-P-A-G-E-50
50 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
“The College of Education has been the first to inaugurate the 
teaching of classes for college credit by its regular faculty mem- 
bers at other towns and cities than Fayetteville. During the 
past year regular classes have been held each week in Batesville, 
Bentonville, Fort Smith, Harrison, Rogers, and Van Buren, in 
which between 150 and 200 regular students have been enrolled. 
“Tt is during the summer, of course, that by far the largest 
enrollment of teachers comes. Last summer the attendance was 
seven hundred. * * * * Many of the teachers take this 
opportunity to get more subject matter, while a large part of 
them add to their professional equipment. Something more than 
twenty school superintendents are working toward their Master’s 
degree, summer by summer. All in all, the College of Education 
each year gives work directly to about 1,200 actual or prospective 
teachers residing in every county of the state. * * * * 
“The head of the Department of School Administration pre- 
pares and distributes to the county superintendents and their 
leading teachers a set of bulletins on the latest and best approved 
methods of school management. Several times a year he makes 
a tour of the state, holding conferences with county superin- 
tendents at convenient points.” 
Dean Jewell is right when he says that the College of Educa- 
tion has its greatest opportunity during the summer school. The 
University was slow about taking advantage of this method of 
serving the teachers. Long before the state had a normal school, 
teachers had worked for a summer school at the University. The 
following report is an illustration. 
“The teachers of Washington county, in their County Insti- 
tute, passed an important resolution which should meet with a 
hearty response from the teachers of the state. In substance, it 
provides for holding a summer normal school at the State Univer- 
sity next summer, which shall be as strong as money and brains 
can make it, and especially adapted to the wants of Arkansas 
schools and teachers. This is certainly a good move in the right 
direction. The summer school of the South held at Knoxville 
this year is a striking example of what can be done in this direc- 
tion when consecration and effort are put forth in its accom- 
plishment. We can have a summer normal at Fayetteville which 
will be a ‘tower of strength’ to us if we will but take hold of 
the measure and push it vigorously. The teachers of Wash- 
ington county have pledged the measure substantial aid. The 
University Board may be induced to contribute to its support. 
We believe the necessary money can easily be raised to insure the 
enterprise a success. We here and now predict that during the 
summer of 1903 we will have at least a six weeks’ normal school
-P-A-G-E-51
Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 51   
at Fayetteville that will enroll at least one thousand teachers. 
What a mighty up-lift this would be to our schools in Ar- 
kansas !”"1 
It was more than ten years after this date before the University 
summer school became a factor in the state’s teacher-training 
program. 
The following information taken from the University Summer 
School Catalog for 1915 indicates the nature of the service that 
was, and is, rendered by the summer sessions: 
“The Sunimer School of the University of Arkansas for the 
year 1915 will be organized especially to serve the following 
classes of people: 
“(1) Those students who seek help in preparation for the 
examinations offered by the state for first, second and third grade 
licenses, and state and professional licenses. Practically every 
subject included in the examinations for these certificates will 
be taught. 
“(2) Those who desire better preparation for teaching the 
various high school subjects. More than a dozen different sec- 
ondary subjects will be taught. 
“(3) Those who wish to study methods of teaching in all 
grades of school work. The University Training School will be 
operated during the entire Summer School, and students may 
observe skilled teaching done by experts. 
“(4) Superintendents and principals of schools who wish 
additional help in school organization and administration. 
“(5) Those who may wish to make special preparation for 
work in the county institutes of Arkansas. 
“(6) University students who have entrance conditions and 
desire to remove them by summer work. 
“(7) Applicants for admission to the School of Law, or to 
the freshman class of the University, who are unable to pre- 
sent the required number of entrance units.” 
REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION 
Except in the cases of those seeking college or entrance credits, 
there will be no specific requirements for admission to the Sum- 
mer School. Applicants will be expected to give evidence that 
they are prepared to profit by the courses taken. All such appli- 
cants will be admitted.

GRADUATES 
The records tell very little about the seniors or graduates prior 
to 1905. The United States Bureau Report for 1876 says that 
there were three graduates from the University Normal Depart- 
ment and that two of them taught. From this same source we 
find that there were occasional graduates prior to 1906. The 
graduates received diplomas, not degrees. According to the 
catalog for 1904, the Board of Trustees authorized the giving 
of the teachers’ certificate—Licentiate of Instruction, which was 
to be based on a full two years collegiate course. The first cer- 
tificates recorded were issued in 1906. The B. S. E. degree was 
first conferred by the College of Education in 1916. Below is a

Craprer IX 
THE STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE 
The Legislature of 1907 provided for Arkansas’ first and only 
State Normal School. It took more than three decades of agita- 
tion to establish this institution. The State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion has consistently stood for “A trained teacher in every school 
room.” Its annual resolution committees almost resolved them- 
selves “hoarse” on this one issue. The Association did not stop 
with resolutions, but its legislative committees worked faithfully 
for a State Normal School. The president’s address was not 
complete until he had emphasized the need of a teacher-training 
institution. 
“Tet us pray that come it may, as come it will for a’ that,” 
the day when a person can no more go into the school room 
without normal training than he can go into the practice of medi- 
cine without having attended a medical college. The most care- 
ful training should be offered by the state to those who are to: 
become the teachers of its youth. On every side, the states which 
border on Arkansas have provided well for the establishment of 
teachers’ training schools.” 
_ “Out yonder on a hill is the penitentiary; on another the new 
capitol building, necessary and noble institutions, both of them; 
but Arkansas would do better if, on another hill, with another 
million, she would build and equip a great school for the train- 
ing of her teachers. We need a reform school, county super- 
vision, consolidation of rural districts, but more than all we need’ 
teachers. It is not apparatus or equipment or fine buildings or 
courses of study that make the school ; the teacher is the school.” 
The legislature of 1907 appropriated $15,000 for the establish- 
ment of a State Normal School. Many cities bid for this state 
institution. All of them made attractive offers, but Faulkner 
county and the city of Conway convinced the Board of Trustees 
that the normal should go to Conway. This method for selecting

54 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
a site for a state enterprise is dangerous. When a state estab- 
lishes an institution for the purpose of serving, not only its cit- 
izens today but for generations to come, it is false economy to 
let “enterprising citizens” of one community determine the loca- 
tion of the institution. 
In this instance no harm was done. The State Normal could 
not have been better located. Conway is a good town and is 
easily reached from all parts of the state. It is only seven miles 
from the state’s geographic center. 
Faulkner county and the city of Conway donated eighty acres 
of land and fifty-one thousand dollars. With the money donated 
the Board of ‘Trustees erected a brick building containing eighteen 
class, rooms and a small auditorium. Since then the state has 
built the following: 
Two dormitories accommodating 140 women 
A small frame building for the training school; 
A central heating plant; 
A splendid, but unfinished administration building ; 
A frame gymnasium building; 
A $100,000 building is now being erected for the training 
school. 
These buildings, the furniture, teaching equipment, heating and 
lighting appliances, together with the small farm of thirty-five 
acres and a frame farm house, a frame combination barn, a 
frame hay barn, a frame sweet potato house, hog and chicken 
houses, live stock and farming implements, making a total valua- 
tion of the property of the state on the premises, of $500,000. 
“Through many years the teachers of the state have worked 
faithfully to’ secure a Normal School for Teachers. We rejoice 
that the legislature has heard our call and that now our efforts 
are to be crowned with success. We have long felt that only by 
providing better preparation for those who are to instruct the 
youth can we realize the best results from our teaching. We 
congratulate the Association that our united and harmonious 
effort has helped to bring about this wished for result.”! 
‘Tur NorMat’s DEVELOPMENT 
The State Teachers’ College today would not recognize its 
picture of 1908, or even of 1912. The State Normal opened in 
1908. The catalog of 1909-10 gives a faculty of twelve. Work 
was offered in pedagogy, science, history, mathematics, English, 
music, reading, agriculture, and Latin. The same catalog, page 
14, says: “Students who attend must be at least sixteen years

of age, in good health, and of good moral character. They must

In 1912 President Doyne of the State Normal made the fol- 
owing report to the State Superintendent of Public Instruc 
tion :1 
“In the arrangement of the courses for the student body the 
thought was clearly in mind that the province of the Normal 
School primarily is to prepare teachers for the rural, schools. 
It is true that many of our students are filling acceptably posi- 
tions in high schools, and this will continue for a long time to 
be the case. 
“A four years’ high school course with a pedagogical course 
covering three years, under specialists in their work, has been 
thought sufficient to furnish such scholarship and training as 
will equip the student for his work, and this has been the plan 
of the State Normal School. The following lines of study have 
therefore been incorporated:

The State Teachers’ College has gradually grown into a larger 
field of service. Not only has the enrollment outgrown the fac- 
ulty, but the Teachers’ College has added extension courses until 
the energy of the faculty has, at times, been dissipated. A recent

admitted to the equivalent list of colleges in the North Central 
Association this does not mean that we are not interested in 
the teachers of rural schools. It is our purpose to reach out 
and touch in some way every teacher in the state whatever the 
grade or license or the kind of school in which they are em- 
ployed.” The following data show recent developments of the

CHAPTER X 
NORMAL TRAINING IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
Arkansas is one of the twenty-three states that provide for 
teacher-training in the high schools. The Legislature of 1911 
authorized the State Board of Education to designate certain 
standard high schools as normal training high schools. Each 
school gets a minimum of $600 and a maximum of $1,800 from 
the state to help establish the normal training department. This 
aid means that no tuition can be charged to students taking this 
course. This feature has caused some of the best high schools 
to refuse to give normal training. According to the law, “The 
object of said teacher-training department is to instruct teachers 
in the best methods of organization, teaching and managing the 
rural and village schools of the state.” 
When normal training departments were established in the 
high schools, Superintendent George B. Cook wrote the following 
letter to the teachers: 
“A very important feature of state aid is the advantages thus 
afforded to those who will become teachers in our rural schools 
to receive professional preparation for this work and scholastic 
training above the grades they are expected to teach. In this 
way state aid helps, more than any other factor, in solving the 
great problem of securing competent and trained teachers for 
our rural schools.”’! 
The following report, after one year’s trial, shows how one 
normal training “high school” felt about it: 
“Vhe greatest progress in high school work has been made in 
the last year since Mountain Home College has been designated 
a Normal Training School with state aid. Teachers are taking 
advantage of this by attending, and are encouraging their pupils 
to do so. The enrollment at Mountain Home is larger this year 
than ever before, and the enthusiasm. manifested by the faculty 
and the community promises much.” 
For fourteen years Mountain Home College has had a normal 
training department. She has lost none of her enthusiasm. 
The state usually has from ten to fifteen of these schools each 
year. At present there are thirteen that receive state aid. The 
normal training department at Batesville is typical, though its 
enrollment is above the average. Superintendent Pickens of 
Batesville, makes.the following report of this work: 
“Our high school is one designated by the State Department 
of Education as a Normal Training School, and the students

who complete two years of normal training work receive at grad- 
uation a state-wide certificate to tea 
“There are 74 students enrolled in the normal training depart- 
ment this year. During the first semester courses in Psychology 
and in school management are be 
offered during the second semester 
and one in methods of teaching the

importance to the welfare of the commonwealth, and pledge our- 
selves to the support of every legitimate means for the solution 
of the rural school problem. To that end we especially recom- 
mend that teacher-training in high schools be encouraged and 
advanced in every possible way, and we respectfully request the 
support of the state authorities and the legislature in a broad and 
statesmanlike view of this matter to the end that the rural teacher 
may be better prepared. 
The law empowers the State Board of Education not only to 
designate the high schools in which normal training shall be 
given, but to “prescribe the course of study for teacher-train- 
ing,” “determine by proper examination or otherwise, the quali- 
fication of all teachers of professional subjects employed in said 
teacher-training department,” and to make other regulations. 
The Board has made the following regulations: 
1. The school must offer a full high school course of not less 
than four years of work. 
2. It must employ at least three teachers who give their whole 
time to high school work (work above the eighth grade) and, in 
addition, a normal training teacher approved by the State Board 
of Education. 
3.. It must equip laboratories for the teaching of at least two 
natural sciences; or one science and one industrial subject. 
4. It must provide a school term of not less than nine months. 
5. It must provide facilities for observation and _ practice 
teaching in all the grades of the elementary school. 
6. State aid will be granted for normal training in class “A” 
high schools only. 
7. State aid will not be granted unless at least ten eligible 
pupils ask for the work and remain in attendance upon the 
course. If the number falls below ten, state aid cannot be 
granted for the semester in which the number has fallen below 
the requirements. This, however, will not prevent students who 
do the required work from receiving certificates. 
8. Students of the teacher-training course who have not made 
a grade of “C,” or 85, should not be allowed to take more than 
four studies. Only exceptionally bright pupils may be allowed 
to take five studies. 
9. High schools will not be approved for teacher-training 
work unless the grades below the high school are taught by com- 
petent teachers. Teachers will not be considered qualified to 
teach in the grades of school systems maintaining teacher- 
training high schools unless 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
(a) Said teacher has completed at least one year of 
college or.normal work above a high school ; or 
(b) Teachers already in the service who have not 
done the required work above the high school may be 
continued, provided such teacher attends summer school 
at least six weeks every two years till the necessary 
amount of work is finished. This advanced work may 
also be done by correspondence. 
STANDARDS 
A. LIBRARY 
1. The school must have a teacher-training library of at 
least thirty volumes approved by the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction. It must expend at least ten dollars each 
year for the purchase of books for reference on teaching. 
2. It should take at least three of the leading educational mag- 
azines, and the students of the teacher-training classes should be 
encouraged to read them. 
B. QUALIFICATIONS OF NORMAL TRAINING TEACHERS 
1. After September, 1925, all teachers of normal training 
subjects shall have a minimum professional training of fifteen 
semester hours in Education in a recognized institution. 
2. The normal training teacher shall teach the normal train- 
ing subjects, including the major and minor reviews, except when 
they are taught by the superintendent. 
C. REQUIREMENTS FOR MATRICULATION 
1. Pupils registering for normal training subjects must have 
completed two full years of high school work. 
D. REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION 
1. The State Superintendent is authorized to give those who 
complete the teacher-training course in’an approved high school 
a licence to teach in the state, valid for two years and not re- 
newable. 
2. Teacher-training certificates will not be granted until the 
full teacher-training course is completed. The two-year cer- 
tificate is granted only to those who are graduated by the high 
school granting the certificate or to those who are graduates of 
a high school approved by the State Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-67

3. No certificate will be granted to any pupil 
(a) Under 17 years of age; 
(b) Who does not make an average of “C” (rela- 
tive) or 85.

CHAPTER XI 
THE FOUR STATE AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS 
In 1909 the Legislature passed a bill dividing the state into 
four districts and providing for the establishment in each of 
these districts a school, to be known as “The State Agricultural 
School.” The Legislature appropriated $40,000 for each school. 
Many towns in each district bid for the school. Local contribu- 
tions in land, buildings, equipment and cash were expected to 
supplement this $40,000 for a period of two years. The fol- 
lowing quotation from the law shows the outstanding purpose 
of these schools: “After the first buildings are erected and 
teady for temporary use, all work in, on and about said schools, 
whether it be farming, building, care of stock, or whatever kind 
of work, shall be performed by students of said school.” To 
govern each school the Governor appoints a board of five mem- 
bers, “who shall be intelligent farmers.” The purpose of these 
schools was, and is, to educate rural people for rural life. Work 
is given in the grades, but a student must be fifteen years old 
before entering. 
The seventy-five counties are divided about equally among 
these four schools. Each school is fairly well equipped with 
administration buildings and dormitories. The annual enroll- 
ment is between 300 and 400 students. 
During the first ten years of their history these institutions 
saw many of their graduates and undergraduates take up teach- 
ing. The demand for normal work in these schools continued 
to become urgent. About 1918 each institution began giving 
attention to the training of teachers. Three of the institutions 
have strong teacher-training departments as a part of the regu- 
lar work. Russellville is near the State Teachers’ College and 
has not emphasized teacher-training except in the summer 
courses. The following curriculum for the training of rural 
teachers is offered in the other three schools:

Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 71 
Entrance requirements: Eighth grade diploma; 16 years of 
age. 
These four agricultural schools render a much greater service 
in teacher-training during their special summer normals. In 
February, 1921, the presidents of these schools, the president of 
the State Normal, and members of the State Department of Edu- 
cation held a conference for the purpose of organizing a summer 
normal for each of the four agricultural schools. The result of 
this conference has meant much to the state’s teacher-training 
program. The following program was launched: 
1. Each agricultural school would give its entire plant and 
faculty to the training of rural teachers, beginning some time in 
May and continuing for at least six weeks. 
2. All the county superintendents would be urged to bring 
their teachers and to offer courses. 
3. The president of each institution would be the adminis- 
trator, but a member, or representative of the State Department 
of Education, should be the director of the summer normal. 
4. The curriculum should be prepared by the State Normal 
faculty and the State Department of Education. This curriculum 
should cover the common school branches, emphasizing both 
subject matter and method. 
5. The State Department of Education should select a pri- 
mary specialist who should conduct a demonstration school dur- 
ing the six weeks normal. 
For four years these four summer normals have been run on 
this plan. Some members of the regular faculty who are good 
in their special fields are not prepared to do good work in these 
normals. The county superintendents, the primary demonstrators, 
and occasionally other successful teachers, have helped the regu- 
lar faculty to make these summer normals a greater force than 
was anticipated. These superintendents and teachers have done 
much toward giving to these four schools a real normal school 
atmosphere. 
Besides the primary demonstration work the school at Mon- 
ticello has a one-room rural demonstration school taught ten 
months in the year by a trained teacher. In this.school the nor- 
mal students do apprentice work and regular teaching. Jones- 
boro and Magnolia are planning to have such a school. 
These four normals have been increased from six weeks to 
twelve weeks. The curriculum is no longer limited to the com- 
mon school branches, but the main purposes are the same. Be- 
sides preparing students to stand examination on the common 
branches for county license, the curriculum now includes courses

It was thought by some that these four normals might decrease 
the attendance at the State Teachers’ College, but they have 
apparently increased, rather than decreased, the enrollment. 
Thy have also caused other six-weeks normals to be organized 
“closer to the people.” There is a danger now that the state 
may have too many “local” normals.

CuHapter XII 
THE CHURCH COLLEGES 
Ever since Arkansas has had schools, the private colleges 
have played an important part in the preparation of teachers. A 
great deal of this preparation has been unintentional, both on 
the part of the students and the institutions. 
The census of 1850 shows that Arkansas had three colleges 
with a total enrollment of 150 students. The annual income for 
these institutions was $3,100. The census of 1860 shows that 
there were four colleges with a total enrollment of 225 students. 
The total incomes for these four institutions was $5,585. Such 
a program today would mean very little, but three-quarters of 
a century ago standards were lower, demands for teachers was 
not so great, and $5,585 would do much more than it will today. 
During the next quarter of a century there were many short 
lived colleges and academies, but we are concerned here with 
those colleges which still live and whose influences are felt as 
“teacher-training” institutions. In making a study of the insti- 
tutions whose graduates have had a marked influence on the 
teaching profession in Arkansas, the following cannot be 
omitted :

With the exception of Little Rock College and Subiaco Col- 
Jege, these institutions have played ati important part in fur- 
nishing teachers to the public schools of Arkansas. Many of the 
graduates from the two Catholic institutions teach in the paro- - 
chial schools. 
In 1920-21 Mr. George F. Zook, Specialist in Higher Educa- 
tion, Bureau of Education, Washington, D. C., made a study 
of a number of these colleges. He found that a large per cent 
of the graduates from, these institutions have become teachers. 
The occupation of the alumni from 1916-21, inclusive, is so pre- 
dominantly teaching that the state can not overlook the work of
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
these colleges. The following is a part of Mr. Zook’s report: 
“As yet the higher institutions in Arkansas, with the excep- 
tion of the State University and the normal school, have given 
relatively little attention to courses in education. To be sure, 
in most instances, some work along this line has been provided, 
but.it has been for the most part subsidiary to other interests 
such as psychology, philosophy, and religious education. These 
interests and many others deserve the heartiest encouragement 
possible. In fact, it should not be forgotten that colleges of lib- 
eral arts and science exist primarily for the purpose of instilling 
that culture and those qualities of good citizenship which will 
enable young men and young women to enjoy the best in life 
and become leaders among their associates. Professional prepa- 
ration should, therefore, for the most part follow the broad foun- 
dation laid during the four years’ course in college. 
“On the other hand, we must always keep the present situa- 
tion in sight. ‘It is a condition, not a theory, that confronts us.” 
Therefore, it is well to point out what number and proportion 
of the graduates of the Arkansas higher institutions have become 
teachers. According to figures furnished by eleven of the col- 
leges, it appears that, of the 1,120 graduates of these institutions 
during the last five years, 432, or 32.1 per cent, are now in the 
teaching profession. [Excluding the State University and the 
State Normal School, it appears that, of the 809 graduating dur- 
ing the past five years, 280, or 25.7 per cent, are now teaching— 
many more than have entered any other occupation. Some of 
the Arkansas colleges have outlined work preparatory to the pro- 
fession of medicine. Many of them consciously aim their cur- 
ricula in part toward the preparation of young men to enter the 
ministry. Teaching is a profession which ought to be dignified 
not only by generous increases in salary, but by a higher degree 
of professional preparation. The colleges of Arkansas may there- 
fore well consider not only the outlining of better programs or 
subject-matter preparation for the several fields of high school 
teaching, but also the establishment of an adequate and reason- 
able number of courses in teacher-training. 
“Table 7 shows for the last five years the proportion of grad- 
uates from the several higher institutions in Arkansas who are: 
now engaged in the teaching profession.”

This study shows that the private colleges of Arkansas are 
largely teacher-training institutions. After Mr. Zook made this 
survey and recommended the “establishment of an adequate and 
reasonable number of courses in teacher-training,” the State 
Board of Education and college representatives worked in har- 
mony for a solution to this common problem. Without excep- 
tion the private colleges are now offering courses in education. 
They have gladly accepted guidance from the State Department 
of Education in the selection of these courses. Most of them are 
meeting the regulations made by the State Board of Education, 
and their graduates receive the state teachers’ certificate. 
In order to find out what the private colleges have been doing 
in teacher-training since Mr. Zook’s report, the following letter, 
dated April 25, 1925, was sent to the presidents of all the church 
colleges of Arkansas: 
“T am making a study of our state’s teacher-training problem. 
I am writing to all the church schools for the following infor- 
mation:

Arkansas” Teacher-Training Problem 79   
Ail these questionnaires were filled out and returned during the 
months of December and January of the present school year, 
1924-25. Some of the more important answers given by the dif- 
ferent institutions are found on page 78. The table shows that 
three-fourths of all 1924 graduates are now teaching. The 500 
seniors who hope to be 1925 graduates are classified as follows: 
19] two-year normal school graduates, 40 four-year normal 
school graduates, 153 four-year high school graduates, and 116 
graduates from church colleges. 
Many states will not certificate a teacher who has had less 
than two years’ normal work above the high school, but if we 
consider these 500 graduates as normal trained teachers we are 
still 1,800 short of the state’s annual demand. If all the normal 
training departments in Arkansas had as many seniors as they 
have students taking courses in the normal departments, they 
would still be 800 teachers short of the state’s annual demand. 
The question naturally arises, where does Arkansas secure her 
teachers? Section 2 of the questionnaire sent to the county, town 
and city superintendents was for the purpose of securing sufficient 
data to answer this question. 
We shall notice first the replies that were made by the seventy- 
four county superintendents. The following is a copy of Sec- 
tion 2 of the questionnaire, with a summary of all replies re- 
ceived.

This summary shows where the state in 1924-25 secured. 1,768 
of its 1,784 new rural teachers. When we see that 1,433, or more 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  40 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
than four-fifths of all the new rural teachers, were certificated 
by passing an examination on the common school branches, we 
can better understand how the state is meeting the demand for 
teachers. Boys and girls, who pass the examination, must be 
given a teacher’s certificate regardless of age or training. 
Below is a copy of Section 2 of the questionnaire sent to the 
sixty-two town and city superintendents. A summary of the 
replies made by sixty of the superintendents is as follows:

From this summary we see that more of the 321 new town 
and city teachers have been certificated by examination than from 
any other one source. Examination for professional license in- 
cludes the common branches, general history, algebra, plane 
geometry, and rhetoric. During the past year the State Depart- 
ment of Education has issued twenty-two professional licenses. 
It is possible that some holders of this license may be among the 
new teachers. 
We can better understand the present program of these insti- 
tutions if we know something of the students they are training. 
We are interested to know their ages, their home counties, their 
parents’ occupation, their classification, whether they expect to 
teach next year, what kind of position they want, and what life 
work they expect to follow. To get this information the fol- 
lowing questionnaire was sent to the head of each normal train- 
ing department (including a copy for each student) :

There were 725 of these questionnaires filled out and returned. 
This number represents about one-half the students in the state 
who are taking courses in the normal training departments. Re- 
plies from these 725 students have been tabulated. The follow- 
ing tables and summaries are, in the main, self-explanatory. 
They are given here without comment, but will be referred to in 
the next chapter. 
Seven hundred ten students answered question number 7. The

To the question, “What do you expect to follow as a life 
work?” niany answers were given. Among the answers given 
by men the following are found most often: 
63 want to teach, 
25 do not know, 
13 want to go into the ministry, 
10 want to practice law, 
9 want to go into business, 
7 want to practice medicine. 
Among the answers given by women the following are found 
most often: 
318 want to teach, 
70 do not know, 
41 want to become home-makers, 
11 want to be missionaries, 
7 want to be stenographers, 
7 want to be musicians. 
The median age of the 725 students is 19.7 years. Two hun- 
dred ninety-eight want to teach next ‘year. 
In regard to the occupation of their parents the following 
were given most often:

16. Nineteen other occupations were given. A number of the 
113 merchants were given as “merchant and planter.” The data 
show that about one-half our teachers are coming from the farm. 
Thus far, Part Three has given a brief history of the Arkansas 
institutions that train teachers. We have seen, too, that the 
present program in these institutions is inadequate. In the next 
chapter we shall study the state’s teacher-training force, noticing 
what neighboring states have done to solve similar problems. 
CHAPTER XIV 
THE STATE AND ITS. TEACHERS 
There was a time when people argued that any good scholar 
as a good teacher; that teachers are born, not made, etc. 
Today no state school system is being administered on those 
theories. Every state in the Union, and all nations that have a 
school system, have provided normal schools for the training 
of their teachers. For ages, nations have spent their millions 
on the training of soldiers, but the training of teachers is com- 
paratively new. Training teachers is as essential to the nation’s 
welfare as is the training of soldiers. In many of the European 
countries the nations train their teachers, but in the United 
States the teacher-training problem is left for each state to solve 
as it secs fit. Some states are solving it much better than others. 
In many states the people are as careful to employ a trained 
\ teacher to educate their children as they are to employ a quali-     
fied person to prtine their orchards, to feed their stock, to culti- 
vate their crops, or to train their bird dogs. > 
Arkansas and Michigan were “paired” and admitted into the 
Union about the same time, Arkansas making the twenty-fifth 
state and Michigan the twenty-sixth. Michigan early saw the 
necessity of normal-trained teachers. When she was only fifteen 
years old she established her first normal school. Today she has 
five state teachers’ colleges and thirty-seven county normal 
schools. In 1921-22 she had more than 15,000 students in her 
five state teachers’ colleges, and in 1922 she had 3,000 graduates. 
Her county normals are only twenty years old, but they have 
graduated enough students to.supply all the elementary school 
positions in Arkansas. In 1921-22 $1,382,821, or $276,564 per 
school, was spent by Michigan to maintain her five state normal 
schools. This was more than seventeen times what Arkansas . 
spent for training teachers in her state normal school. This is
-P-A-G-E-84

saying nothing about what Michigan spends annually to main- 
tain her thirty-seven county normal schools. Michigan is often 
referred to as Arkansas’ twin sister. 
In 1922, out of every 100 teachers in California, 92 were

normal graduates. Out of every 100 teachers in Arkansas, 92 
teachers were not normal graduates. 
But Arkansas is not the only. state that has not kept pace with 
Michigan and California. We like to see how states closer home 
are solving their teacher-training problem. The map on page 84 
gives nothing about city normals, or private normals, but it tells, 
for the most part, what the states are doing to supply the 
annual demand for trained teachers. 
In 1922 only two of our neighboring states, Louisiana and 
Mississippi, were in Arkansas’ column with one teachers’ college. 
Today Arkansas stands alone. Louisiana has three normals, and 
Mississippi will open her second normal in the summer of 1925. 
Iowa has only one state-supported teachers’ college, but in Sioux 
City there is an excellent city training school. There are also 193

normal departments in Iowa’s high schools and colleges. In 
1922-1923 there were 5,552 students enrolled in these normal 
departments. In June, 1923, there were 2,256 graduates from 
these 193 departments. In 1922-23 Arkansas had sixteen normal 
training high schools, with an enrollment of 403 girls and 2 
boys. In June, 1923, there were 203 graduates. Iowa spends 
nine times as much for training teachers in her only teachers’ 
college as Arkansas does for training teachers in her only teach- 
ers’ college. Texas has added two new normals since 1922, 
making a total of eight normals. 
Most states begin with one normal school, but they soon see 
that the one can not serve the entire state. There are many 
reasons why one state institution can not train all the teachers. 
Arkansas, for example, needs 2,500 teachers annually. If one

institution tried to graduate this many annually the student body 
would have to be so large that the individual would be lost in 
the crowd. Especially would this be true for the undergraduate 
college. Maps found on pages 85 and 86 give another reason 
why one normal can not serve the entire state. A stranger can 
look at either of these maps and tell where the State Teachers’ 
College is located. 
This geographic distribution is not so centered when we think 
of all the institutions in the state that have normal training 
departments. The map found on page 87 shows the geographic 
distribution of the 725 students now in training who filled out 
the questionnaire in December, 1924. Without the aid of the 
key, one is able to locate most of the normal training depart- 
ments. The discouraging situation revealed by this map is the 
fact that the counties farthest away from training institutions, as 
a rule not only need the greatest number of new teachers, but 
that they have the fewest students attending normal schools. 
A state school system is no stronger than its weakest link. In 
this study we are interested to know something about the educa-

tional qualification of the teachers now in service. Section 3 
of the questionnaire to county, town and city superintendents 
was to secure data on this question. Below is given Section 3 
of the questionnaire that was sent to the county superintendents, 
with a summary of replies coming from seventy-four counties.

The table given above shows that out of 7,236 rural teachers 
in the seventy-four counties, 7,132 were classified. No explana- 
tions were given for not classifying the other 104. These results 
show.that 75 per cent of the rural teachers, or 5,305, have had 
no work beyond the high school. In many states these teachers 
would have to go to school at least two more years before re- 
ceiving license to teach. 
A similar questionnaire was sent to the town and city super- 
intendents. Replies from sixty superintendents show the fol- 
lowing situation:   
eae! Normal refers only to teachers who are graduates of an accredited high 
school.

The table given above shows that 90 per cent of the teachers 
in the towns and cities have had work beyond the high school. 
It will be seen that the town and city superintendents gave the 
qualification of nineteen more teachers than they have teachers 
in service: In a few instances, substitute teachers were counted 
in one list and not in the other. This, in the sixty systems, could 
easily account for the nineteen teachers. 
From the tables given above we see that Arkansas has two 
teacher-training problems, namely: (1) to train the 2,500 new 
teachers which she needs annually; (2) to train a large per cent 
of her teachers now in service. 
Including the graduates from normal high schools, Arkansas 
is training about one-fifth as many teachers as she needs. Many 
of the teachers that she is training do not teach in Arkansas. 
For seven years the writer was director of the teachers’ training 
school in the University of Arkansas. Each spring school 
officials from adjoining states would come on their annual hunt 
for trained teachers. So long as our neighboring states can offer 
our graduates more salary, just so long will we continue to 
train teachers for them. We blame neither the states who come 
for good teachers, nor the teachers who go for good salaries. 
Within our own borders we see a similar situation. Some 
counties can pay more than others.t As a rule the cities outbid 
the rural communities and secure the trained teachers. The fol-   
pee ee Normal refers only to teachers who are graduates of an accredited high 
school. 
{This is shown in a recent survey made by the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion. The length of school term in nine counties was found to be as follows. Pulaski, 
168 days; Arkansas, 147 days; Garland, 132 days; White, 122 days; Hempstead, 117 
days; Boone, 109 days; Stone, 89 days Van Buren, 77 days, and Newton 77 days.

No one can study these data and then blame the trained 
teacher for going where a living wage can be had. The good 
teacher has the missionary spirit, but even the missionary wants 
to live twelve months in the year. 
Approximately one-half of Arkansas’ 9,752 white teachers is 
found in one-room schools. Arkansas’ teacher-training problem 
is largely rural. In Searcy county 77 of the 87 schools are one- 
teacher schools. The state might put a normal school in every 
county, but. until rural teachers are paid a living wage the rural 
schools will still be taught by untrained teachers. 
Teachers usually consider it a promotion to go from the one- 
teacher school to.a larger school, and the larger the school the 
greater the promotion. Of the 725 normal students who said 
where they wanted to teach, only seven wanted to go to the one- 
teacher school, and only twenty-six wanted to go to the two- 
teacher school. During the past year 1,273 new teachers were 
employed in the one- and two-teacher schools. Of this num- 
ber the normal high schools supplied 32, the State Teacher’s 
College 18, and the College of Education 2. The other 1,221 
were certificated largely from examination. The rural schools

Number of Districts having less than $200.00 local school fund, and number 
of school childred enumerated 
last year employed 1,342 teachers who are classified as “eighth 
grade graduates or less.” 
The map given above partly explains this low standard for 
rural teachers. The first figure in each county represents the 
number of districts in which local school funds, on the 12-mill 
tax limit, amounts to less than $200 annually. ~The second figure 
represents the number of. school children living in those dis- 
tricts. To summarize, there are 44,383 school children in Arkan- 
sas living in 1,034 districts whose local school revenue amounts 
to less than $200 annually. Examining this group of children 
more closely we find that 8,727 of them live in 237 districts 
whose local school revenue amounts to less than $100 annually. 
There is no county tax to supplement this fund. The state fund 
amounts to about $5.00 per child. This gives to these 1,034 dis-
-P-A-G-E-92
92 Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem   
tricts a total of from $285 to $425 per district. These districts 
can not hope to secure trained teachers. 
Rural children deserve good teachers, but so long as there are 
tural districts that can not pay teachers a living wage, just so 
long will it be useless for the state to train teachers for them. 
Arkansas has provided for the training of teachers in the Col- 
lege of Education, the State Teachers’ College and thirteen sec- 
ondary schools. This program does not approximate the needs 
of the public schools. This is clearly seen when we compare the 
annual number of normal graduates with the annual needs. 
Data, given elsewhere, enable us to make the following com- 
parison:

  Taking into consideration the fact that the teaching force of 
Arkansas is annually increasing, the state needs about 2,500 new 
teachers annually. In training this number she must keep in 
mind the kinds of positions that need to be filled. The data 
given below show two things: first, the actual number of posi- 
tions filled by new teachers in 1924-25 (not including Little Rock, 
Eureka Springs, and Columbia county) ; and, second, the num- 
ber of normal students preparing for each position. The second 
column refers to the choice of 725 normal students now in school. 
This represents about one-half the normal students in Arkansas 
who are taking one or more courses in normal departments. If 
the 725 normal students are representative, the third column 
shows the actual number of normal students in Arkansas pre- 
paring for the kinds of positions indicated.

Even if the state trained 2,500 teachers annually on the basis 
given above, its problem would not be solved. Better salaries for 
rural teachers will do much toward solving this problem. The 
teacher of the one-teacher school has a position second to none 
in importance and responsibility. She must often carry these 
responsibilities alone, without even the aid of a janitor. 
After making a careful survey of rural teachers in the South, 
Dr. L. A. Sharp made the following statement : 
“There are three outstanding reasons why rural teachers change 
positions; namely, to ‘get better salaries, to be closer home, 
patrons didn’t like them. The better qualified and more ex- 
perienced teachers are found in the larger schools. When teach- 
ers, who are well qualified,'go to the one- and two-teacher 
schools, they soon change to larger schools.”! 
No state can have a good school system so long as it permits 
the rural schools to be used as training schools, or as stepping 
stone to larger schools. 
We have seen elsewhere that sixty-seven of Arkansas’ new 
teachers for 1924-25 were certificated on the basis of work done 
in other states. There are other teachers who come from other 
states and enter the profession through the examination route. 
To find out how many of our teachers have been trained in 
other states, how many of our teachers are leaving the state, and 
where our teachers in service are going for additional training, 
the questionnaire given below was sent to the seventy-five county

SUMMARY 
In Part Three we have studied, briefly, the history of the dif- 
ferent kinds of teacher-training institutions in Arkansas. These 
institutions include the College of Education (University of 
Arkansas), the State Teachers’ College, the thirteen Normal 
Training High Schools, the four State Agricultural Schools, and 
the ten private colleges. 
We have found that during the present year, 1924-25, the 
rural schools employed 1,784 new teachers. The town and city
-P-A-G-E-95

schools employed 321 new teachers. Two thousand ninety-one

The state, in all these institutions, will graduate only 500 
from the normal departments in 1924-25. The state needs five 
times this number. Of the 725 normal students who replied to 
the questionnaire, only 376 chose teaching as a life work. Two 
hundred ninety-eight want to teach next year. 
Since 1872 the state has maintained a department of educa- 
tion in the State University. It has only one normal school, 
established in 1908. These are the only teacher-training institu- 
tions maintained by the state. During their entire history these 
two institutions have graduated about 1,500 students. If they 
graduated this number annually, they would still lack 1,000 stu- 
dents of meeting the state’s demand for teachers. 
The one-and two-teacher schools employed 1,311 new teachers 
in 1924-25. Only two per cent of them came from these two 
state institutions. 
Almost one-half the teachers in Arkansas are teaching in one- 
teacher schools, but of 725 normal students replying to the ques- 
tionnaire only seven would like to teach in a one-teacher school. 
In Part Three we have seen the state’s annual need for teach- 
ers. We have seen that the state is now meeting about one-fifth 
of its need. The question naturally arises, what can the state do 
about it? We try to answer this question in Part Four.

PART FOUR 
CHapTeR XV 
A PROPOSED TEACHER-TRAINING PROGRAM 
FOR ARKANSAS 
Keeping in mind the normal increase in the state teaching 
force, and the school systems not included in this study, Arkan- 
sas needs 2,500 new teachers annually. She trains about .one- 
fifth of this number. Before the writer had this information he 
included the following question in a questionnaire to heads of 
normal training departments: “What facilities would you need 
in order to train five times as many teachers as you now train?” 
In answer to this question every one says, “More teachers.” 
Most of them say, “More buildings.” It happens to be our task 
now to answer the question: ‘What facilities would Arkansas 
need in order to train five times as many teachers as she now 
trains ?” 
When factories get as far behind with their “orders” as our 
normal departments are with theirs, they often put on two forces, 
one to work during the day and the other to work during the 
night. The normal departments can not resort to such a pro- 
gram, but this is a time when the state should make it possible 
for the day forces to be 100 per cent efficient. The State Teach- 
ers’ College and the University College of Education can, by 
proper support, serve the state much better than they are now 
doing. 
We have seen how all the states that touch Arkansas have 
partly solved their teacher-training problem by establishing addi- 
tional normal schools. The normal plant at Conway is valued 
at $500,000. The physical plant of another normal would cost 
about the same. It would take about $100,000 annually to main- 
tain it. This proposed program does not call for any additional 
normal school other than the one provided for by the legislature 
of 1925. This law authorizes the present State Teachers’ College 
to maintain a branch normal at Mountain Home, to be known as. 
North Arkansas State Normal. The weakness in the law lies in 
the fact that the State Teachers’ College was given no additional 
funds with which to maintain the branch normal. There is a 
great need for this branch normal, and the next legislature should 
appropriate $50,000 for its maintenance. This is the section in 
which there are’ very few high schools, and this normal should 
maintain a temporary high school department. 
We have seen from replies to the questionnaire that during 
the present school year, 1924-1925, Arkansas has had only 1,510 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  
  Arkansas’ Teacher-Training Problem 97   
normal students preparing to teach. With this situation to face, 
it is difficult to make a program that will furnish 2,500 new 
teachers annually. There are 3,163 students graduating from 
the high schools of Arkansas for the schoo! vear 1924-1925. Two 
hundred fifteen of these graduates, or about 7 per cent, have 
taken the normal training course. Before the state can have 
teachers with high school training, or above, it must either send 
80 per cent of its high school graduates into the teaching pro- 
fession, or it must graduate more students from the high schools. 
There are at present 1,391 teachers in Arkansas who are classi- 
fied as eighth grade graduates or less. There are 4,224 teachers 
who have not completed a four-year high school course. This 
condition compels the state to lean heavily on its secondary 
schools as teacher-training institutions for at least the next ten 
years.. Arkansas should maintain a normal high school, or its 
equivalent, in each county. This is not as it should be, but:we 
are facing facts, not theories. The next legislature should appro- 
priate $100,000 for the State Board of Education to use in main- 
taining county normal high schools. 
The four state agricultural schools were changed in name by 
the last legislature (1925). Three of them are called A. and M. 
colleges, and one, Arkansas Polytechnic College. This means 
that they propose to enlarge their fields of usefulness. These 
schools were established in 1911 for the purpose of serving the 
rural people of Arkansas. It is difficult to think of a better 
way for these institutions to serve their people than by training 
teachers who can be real leaders in rural communities. The 
State Polytechnic College at Russellville is near the State Normal 
but it should maintain a department for the training of rural 
teachers. The next legislature should appropriate $100,000 to 
be used by the State Board of Education for maintaining teacher- 
training departments in these institutions... For twelve weeks 
each summer these four schools should devote their full time to 
the training of teachers. 
We have seen that for 1924-25, seventy-four county superin- 
tendents reported 1,784 vacancies in the rural schools that were 
filled by new teachers. We have also seen that Arkansas is pre- 
paring approximately 282 teachers for these 1,784 rural positions. 
For this same year the sixty town and city superintendents 
reported 321 vacancies that-were filled by new teachers. For 
these 321 positions the state is preparing approximately 1,044. 
We have seen, too, that there are approximately 638 normal 
students preparing for.the 146 high school vacancies. 
The training institutions mentioned above may be able to train 
2,500 teachers annually, but the state must train teachers to meet

specific needs. Each institution should specialize on training 
teachers for certain types of work. No school, however, should 
be limited to the training of teachers for one kind of position 
only. If the salary schedule, which is suggested in the Appendix, 
should be adopted, the state would not have so much trouble in 
getting teachers to qualify themselves for the different kinds of 
positions. 
Great as is the need for trained teachers, the state can not 
hope to solve its teacher-training problem within one or two 
years. The program can not be materially increased until after 
the meeting of the next session of the legislature, 1927. In the 
meantime the state must do the. best it can with its present 
teacher-training facilities. 
The table given below names the teacher-training institutions 
and suggests what they should be doing for the state five years 
after the meeting of the next legislature. Each institution should 
have a twelve-weeks summer course given especially for teachers 
in service. 
What Arkansas’ teacher-training institutions should be doing 
in 1932-1933:

This program would give the state 2,300 graduates annually. 
Tt is true that the standard is low. Some of the teachers will 
be high school graduates, others two-year normal graduates, and 
still others will be four-year college grdduates. Under present 
conditions these temporary standards are necessary. 
The private colleges will continue to train teachers. With 
their help in training teachers for elementary and high schools, 
the program given above will very nearly meet the state’s need 
for teachers. It will also provide teachers trained for the 
positions that will be vacant. The number enrolled and the num- 
ber of graduates are, of course, rough estimates for each school. 
They are not unreasonable, and a lower estimate will not solve 
the state’s teacher-training problem. 
An institution wants to train its teachers for the most attrac- 
tive teaching positions. The students deserve nothing less. So   
“Each.

long as the rural terms are short and the salaries low, it will be 
difficult to get the co-operation of the faculties and student bodies 
in carrying out the proposed teacher-training program. The cer- 
tification plan and salary schedule proposed in the Appendix 
should do much toward uniting all forces on this state teacher- 
training program. 
APPENDIX 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
. The state should see that each county has a standard four 
year high school. 
The State Teachers’ College should discontinue its high school 
work, except for demonstration purposes. 
. The state should provide for the county. unit system of edu- 
cation, 
Arkansas should have at least $1,000,000 for the purpose of 
equalizing educational opportunity. 
The state should come to the rescue of its children that live 
in districts where the citizens are either unable or unwilling 
to have a seven-inonths school term. 
In 1924-25 the total number of normal students in Arkansas 
(including students in normal high schools) amounted to a 
little more than one-half of the state’s annual demand for 
new teachers. To attract more teachers to the normal schools 
the state must guarantee better salaries. 
Sixty per cent of all new teachers in Arkansas, 1924-25, were 
employed to teach in one- and two-teacher schools, but only 
2 per cent of all the normal students now preparing to teach 
in Arkansas want to teach in the one- and two-teacher 
schools. The state can relieve this situation a great deal by 
encouraging consolidations and by helping the small schools 
to secure and keep competent teachers. 
Each teacher who does good work in a twelve-weeks state 
normal, and returns to the school in which she taught the 
year previous, should receive a bonus of $60, provided that 
her salary is not increased by the schedule given below. 
. The legislature of 1927 should pass a certification law pro- 
viding for some such plan as the following: 
a. All certificates should be issued by the state, and should 
be good anywhere in the state. . 
b. The law should not be “ex post facto,” but should apply 
mainly to new teachers. The state should issue state cer- 
tificates to all old teachers in lieu of their county cer- 
tificates.

  ..The examination questions should be made out by the 
state, the examination held by the county superintendent, 
and the papers sent to the State Department of Education 
to. be graded. 
. A person, before receiving a certificate to teach, should be 
at least eighteen years old and should have a*good moral 
character. 
The state should issue not only different grades of cer- 
tificates, but special certificates for the primary teacher, 
the upper grade teacher, the high school teacher, the rural 
teacher, the superintendent (city and county), the prin- 
cipal (elementary school and high school), and for teach- 
ers of special subjects, such as art, music, manual train- 
ing, etc. 
The normal training departments should offer curricula 
upon which these certificates could be based. 
At the earliest possible date teachers’ examinations should 
be abolished and certificates should be issued. on the basis 
of specific training for a specific kind of work. 
. Renewal of certificates should be made on the basis of 
professional growth as shown by successful teaching, at- 
tending institutes, teachers’ meetings, summer normals, 
writing for school journals, reading, etc. 
During the ten years following the next legislature, 1927, 
all new applicants for teachers’ certificates should: meet 
the standards as suggested after each of the following 
dates :

A salary schedule should accompany the certification law. 
The state should guarantee to each. teacher a minimum salary 
of $400 annually, with a raise of $60 for each of the ten 
steps in the certification scale suggested above. The salary 
should be planned so as to reward. successful experience.

11. The state should give more emphasis to the training of 
teachers through extension work. 
12. This study has been limited to the training of white teachers, 
but Arkansas has a colored population of 472,220; of this 
number 192,665 are of school age, and 131,084 were enrolled 
last year. Two thousand four hundred five colored teachers 
were employed in 1924 at a cost of $891,050. One thousand 
one hundred fifty-four of these teachers have had no high 
school training. Only 80 have state or professional licenses. 
During the school year 1924-25 there were 601 new teachers 
needed, but only 26 received teachers’ certificates from insti- 
tutions recognized by the State Department of Education 
The state should make provisions to train 600 colored 
teachers annually.

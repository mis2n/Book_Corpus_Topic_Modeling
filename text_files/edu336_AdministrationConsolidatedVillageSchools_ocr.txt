EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tur Federal Census of 1920 showed that there were 12,905 
incorporated villages in the United States having less than 
2500 inhabitants, and that these incorporated villages con- 
tained 8.5 per cent of the population of the United States. 
Surrounding these incorporated villages lay a large rural 
area that contained 40.1 per cent of the total population of 
our Nation. In this rural and village area, where 48.6 per 
cent of the total population still resides, a recent study of 
school consolidation indicates that there are approximately 
12,000 consolidated schools, of all kinds, large and small, 
with many more village schools that have never been centers 
for consolidation. Just how large the total of village and 
consolidated schools is is not known, but an estimate of 
16,000 does not seem too great. Many of the more recently 
formed of these consolidated schools are large and well- 
organized and well-equipped institutions. Many have a 
partial or complete high school attached, and are rendering 
a very superior type of educational and community service. 
While the supervision of the instruction in such schools 
does not differ materially from the supervision of instruction 
in a city school of corresponding size and type, the problems 
of organization and administration which such a school 
presents are quite different. The principal of such a school 
occupies a relation to the board of trustees for the school 
somewhat like that of a city superintendent of schools to a 
city board of education, and yet with quite different types of 
problems to handle. The principal in a consolidated school 
is the organizer, advisor, administrator, clerk, business 
manager, financial agent, and superintendent of instruction

and of transportation all in one. Such a complex relation- 
ship presents many problems. The handling of the trans- 
portation in the motorized consolidated school, to mention 
only one, is a new problem calling for careful attention. 
Many of the problems in the administration of the school, 
too, as well as in community relationships, are special in 
their character and of a type that the city principal does not 
have to handle at all. 
The authors of the present volume in this series of text- 
books have taken this relatively new problem, the organi- 
zation and administration of a village and consolidated or 
motorized school, and have made a “job analysis” study of 
it. It is their hope that the result may prove of very real 
service to young men and women in normal schools and 
teachers colleges, who are making preparation to begin their 
school work in the principalship of a village or a consoli- 
dated school. In such teacher-training institutions a course 
on Village and Consolidated School Administration could be 
made very effective by using the present volume, in combi- 
nation with the other volume in this series on The Principal 
and His School. This book presents the problems of or- 
ganization and administration for the village and consoli- 
dated school, and the other volume these same problems, 
with classroom supervision in addition, for the city elemen- 
tary school. The two types of organization and administra- 
tion problems, city and rural, have enough that is common 
and enough that is different to make a combined study of the 
two texts valuable, while in classroom supervision the pro- 
blems are practically the same. It is also hoped that the 
present volume may prove helpful as well to the thousands 
of principals now in service in the village and consolidated 
schools of our country. Q

  PREFACE 
Turex rather distinctive types of direct school administra- 
tion may be distinguished in this country. First, there is 
the city superintendency, with its general administrative 
oversight of a city school system. Second, there is the city 
principalship, with its clearly marked managerial duties 
embracing a single school unit. Third, and of rapidly in- 
creasing importance, is the village and consolidated school 
principalship. Covering some ground common to both of 
the city administrative fields named it yet has certain func- 
tions and differences which mark the position off from both 
the city superintendency and the city principalship. In 
particular, it is broader, more inclusive, and less specialized 
than city administration. 
The principles and technique of city administration have 
been well covered by Professor Cubberley — the first, that 
of the city superintendency, in his Public School Administra- 
tion; and the second, that of the city principalship, in his 
The Principal and His School. Both of these books are 
distinctive contributions to education which have had a 
marked effect upon both theory and practice. 
There is, though, no book that attempts to organize, in a 
similar way, the methods and materials of consolidated and 
village school administration. These schools have been in- 
creasing in number, in enrollment, and in relative impor- 
tance for the past three decades. Half of the administrative 
positions now open in the United States are in these two 
types of schools. Whether desirable or not, the truth is 
they are the training ground from which is recruited many 
of our city, county, and state school administrators. This

book isan attempt to supply the need for a somewhat compre- 
hensive and practical manual of consolidated and village 
school organization and administration. 
No attempt has been made to isolate the field, and the best 
of city experience has been drawn upon wherever it would 
apply. In using this material, and the facts drawn from 
other sources, the authors have conscientiously tried to 
make use of them with respect to actual consolidated and 
village-school conditions. In doing this their combined 
twenty years of experience in the smaller schools has proved 
of inestimable value. In the preparation of the book, a 
large amount of new material has been worked up and in- 
cluded, as will be seen by an examination of the chapters on 
Working with the School Board, Business and Office Man- 
agement, Housing of Teachers and Pupils, Transportation, 
Vocational Instruction, the Social Program, the School 
Lunch, and Organizing the Vacation Activities. 
In this book, the consolidated school has been conceived 
of as a progressive educational institution in open country 
and in village communities. It is in the light of this con- 
cept that the purpose of the book may be stated. The school 
must be well managed. In doing this, the principal meets 
with many difficult problems. An effort has been made to 
state the most important of these problems, and to suggest 
practical ways in which they may be solved. Concrete il- 
lustrations and details have been brought in where the im- 
portance or the novelty of the problems seemed to warrant 
them. Sufficient analysis has been used to bring out the 
points in controversy. Summaries in the form of principles 
and abstracts have been freely introduced. 
Most of the special problems relating to the supervision of 
instruction have been omitted. As has been stated, the 
authors take the position that the consolidated school does 
not differ fundamentally from the modern city school, and

there are already several good books which deal with the 
special problems of school supervision. The most useful of 
these is Cubberley’s Principal and His School. It is in the 
organization and the administration of the consolidated and 
village school that there is the widest divergence from city- 
school practices and standards. In the main, therefore, the 
stress has been placed upon the organization and adminis- 
trative duties, and the discussion of supervision has been 
purposely abridged. 
The general plan of the book will be to take up: 
I. Organization duties — working with the school officials, tak- 
ing care of office details and business management, handling 
the school finances — selecting and organizing the teaching 
staff. ; 
II. General administrative duties — housing the pupils and the 
teachers, laying out the transportation routes, and managing 
transportation. 
III. Special administrative and supervisory duties — making the 
daily program, organizing the special instruction, organizing 
the vocational instruction, planning the social program, supet- 
vising the lunch hour, taking care of health and safety, making 
the playground function, supervision of instruction, and over- 
seeing the details of classroom management. 
IV. Community duties— community organization, directing 
vacation activities, and working with community institutions. 
The writers have often been compelled to choose between 
several plans and methods equally advantageous. No 
claim is, therefore, made that the best ways of doing things 
are unfailingly presented. The claim is that the suggestions 
on the whole have been proved by trial, and represent a 
fairly consistent system of procedure. Where practical 
experience is lacking or inconclusive, theory has been selected 
that is in accord with the fundamental concept of the new 
rural school. 
The authors are greatly indebted to many workers in the

field of administration. This embraces all of those who are 
named in the bibliographies at the close of each chapter, and 
those to whom direct reference is made in the discussion. 
Finally, special mention is made of the service of Mrs. Alice 
E. Almack who has copied much of the manuscript, read the 
proof, and verified many of the citations; and to Professor 
E. P. Cubberley, who has lent constant encouragement while 
the book was under preparation, and has made many help- 
ful suggestions as to topics, materials, and method of treat- 
ment. To all we express our sincere thanks.

CHAPTER I 
THE PRINCIPALSHIP —ITS REQUIREMENTS 
The significance of the consolidated school. Social and 
economic readjustments have been yery rapid and far- 
reaching during the past century. They have been due to 
several causes, among which have been the development of 
mechanical inventions, the improvement of transportation, 
the centralization of industry, and the growth of capital re- 
sources. The effect in this country has been more marked 
and on a greater scale than that which accompanied the 
earlier Industrial Revolution in Europe. During this period 
our country passed from the pioneer into the industrial era, 
and became one of the most prosperous and thriving nations 
of the globe. 
These social and economic changes first made themselves 
felt in the cities, and progressive educators in them early 
came to see the need of a new form of education. The move- 
ment made its appearance early, and before the close of the 
nineteenth century our city schools had been transformed. 
The movement for further change and improvemeut gath- 
ered new momentum immediately following the Spanish- 
American War, and again following the World War. ‘To- 
day it may be said that the transformation of the city 
schools from the conventional type of school created in the
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
period of revival preceding our Civil War into a new instru- 
ment to serve democracy’s needs has been accomplished. 
To-day there has come a socialized school, best exemplified 
in the Platoon Plan and the Junior High School, which em- 
body the progressive spirit in education. 
The far-reaching influences which have so profoundly 
modified city life have transformed the country as well. Its 
isolation has ‘disappeared. Motor transportation has mate- 
rially affected rural life and customs. Agriculture, the basic 
industry of rural areas, has been revolutionized. Buying 
and selling have been put upon new foundations, and better 
forms of codperation have been introduced. Wealth has in- 
creased. Modern methods of communication have helped 
to break down the traditional rural narrowness and sus- 
picion. There is a social consciousness and a cohesion 
aniong the people to-day that is prophetic of a better future. 
The changes which by now have become so manifest in 
every phase of rural life cannot be kept much longer from 
touching rural education. The old one-room rural school of 
colonial days is as unsuited to the new conditions as the 
antiquated one-horse shay is unsuited for transportation. 
The school of 1840, however well it may have served at that 
time, looks woefully out of date in this age of the radio, world 
fliers, and universal suffrage. For the enlarged and re- 
vitalized rural community there is needed a strong and 
enterprising educational institution. This need is met by 
the modern village consolidated school. 
( One main point the authors of this volume-would like here 
to stress. In their judgment there is grave danger in the 
idea that it is the special mission of the rural school to keep 
boys and girls on the farm. They would most assuredly 
also take the position that it is not the function of the city 
school to train boys and girls merely for the shop and the 
factory. The first task of any school is to train for intelli- 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
THE PRINCIPALSHIP —ITS REQUIREMENTS 6& 
gent and forceful citizenship. Education ought to broaden 
the horizon, not to limit it. The raral school of to-day 
should not only have more to educate with, but more tc 
educate for. ) The new school should not restrict its usefulness 
to the meager outlook contained in a common vocation for 
all, but should bea broad and liberal educational institution. 
Progress in the consolidation movement. Much has 
already been done in introducing the consolidation of schools 
movement. The obstacles set up by weak and ineffectual 
legislation have generally been removed. The new schools 
have passed out of the experimental stage, and to-day twelve 
thousand districts are organized and operating under the 
plan. There is no absolute uniformity in these, which is 
good evidence that the movement has not been forced by 
theorists, but has grown out of actual needs. At the present 
stage of progress of the movement, the success of consolida- 
tion depends, not so much upon a theoretical expounding of 
the fundamental principles upon which it is based, as upon 
the practical demonstration of the values in the consolida- 
tion method. If it can be unmistakably proved that it is a 
better school than the conventional type of rural institution, 
the growth of the movement is assured. 
Win other words, the success of the consolidated school now ~ 
depends upon its efficient administration. This is not a 
simple matter. It is true, there is available a considerable 
body of administrative experience to serve as a guide. The 
administrative practices in our best city school systems can 
be drawn upon, as many of the problems are identical. The 
consolidated school is not an absolutely unique and dis- 
tinctive institution, and at its best, it approximates the best 
of a modern city school. On the other hand, although it has 
much in common with the city school, it does have certain 
problems for which city experience offers no parallel and no 
guidance,
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
Several examples of the foregoing may be cited. \/The 
trafisportation problem is one of the most outstanding. It 
has arisen because of the widened school area. Transporta- 
tion devices and road conditions are two of its leading ele- 
ments. Many have called transportation the crucial issue in 
rural school improvement. The enlarged area has also put 
heavier demands upon buildings and equipment. A new 
course of study, too, must be prepared, and teachers in 
sympathy with the type of school to be maintained must be 
selected. A double duty has thus been imposed upon the 
principal. He must improve upon the older type of rural 
school, and see that the new school works to its own maxi- 
mum capacity. Progress in rural education must be meas- 
ured on this scale as well as by the number of consolidations 
effected. 
The principal’s duties. If a book is to be of assistance to 
the village and consolidated-school principal it ought to be 
written with respect to his duties. The enumeration of the 
leading duties also should serve as guidance to the student 
who is preparing himself for such a principalship.. With 
these objects in mind, the writers give two tables in the 
pages which immediately follow. The first contains a list of 
the legal duties of the principal—those put upon his 
shoulders by State laws and official rules and regulations. 
The second contains a list of the things which principals are 
actually doing. 
The table is not without significance. It is noticeable 
that, in the first two columns, emphasis is placed upon 
knowledge of school law, prompt reporting, and attention to 
general administration and inspection. In the judgment of 
authorities, the social and community duties of the principal 
take rank with the administrative and supervisory duties 
and are more important than the clerical and legal. It 
seems safe to say the working time would be better dis-

tributed if one followed the judgment of authorities than if 
he let himself be guided by law and by regulations. These 
last matters must, of course, be looked after promptly and 
accurately. By doing this, he is freed to devote more time 
to the real educational functions of a principal. Whether 
such an emphasis is sound or not may be better learned from 
an examination of data on just what the principal in service 
actually does, and how much time he gives to each duty. 
On this point, we are fortunate to have the figures contained 
in Table IT. 
The similarity between the duties of the high-school and 
the elementary-school principal is obvious. The latter gives 
far more time to teaching. Aside from teaching and a half- 
hour or so of supervision, the average principal of both 
groups gives his day mainly to routine administrative and 
clerical tasks. This does not appear to be an equitable dis- 
tribution! We have therefore accepted the judgment of

Journal for September, 1923, the functions of the superintendent are classi- 
fied, as supervision 32.9 per cent, administration 24.7 per cent, teaching 
13.4 per cent, study 13.2 per cent, community service 12.2 per cent, and 
clerical 10.6 per cent. He also finds that in practice the order of empha- 
sis is practically reversed.

authorities as a better basis upon which to determine the 
amount of emphasis to be given to the problems of the prin- 
cipal. We have relied upon actual practice to guide us in 
selecting specific topics and methods. Hard-and-fast lines 
have not been drawn between organization, administration, 
supervision, and community service in our outline which 
follows, because they are seldom isolated in actuality. 
Convenience rather than logic has determined the order. 
The outlook for the principal of the new type of school is 
a most favorable one. The number and importance of the 
positions are constantly growing. Its proper development is 
essential to national welfare and to social and economic pro- 
gress. The movement as yet is in the pioneer stage. In 
organizing a new consolidated school, the principal has much 
of the freedom from formality and tradition that attends the 
inauguration of a new junior high school. He can display 
all the initiative he possesses. The margin is sufficiently 
wide to enable him to experiment judiciously with organiza~ 
tion, curricula, methods, and educational extension. The 
work is important enough for one to find his career within it. 
The material rewards are adequate to enable him to main- 
tain himself and family in health and comfort. The pro- 
spects for increased material rewards are good. If, on the 
other hand, new types of professional service are looked 
forward to as goals, experience in the consolidated school is 
exactly of the type which fits best for future success in 
school administration. 
Summary. The consolidated school is a new type of insti- 
tution which has for its purpose the_ revitalizing of rural 
education and rural life. In the rural field it is comparable 
with the j junior high-school movement in the city. In gen- 
for He al children. that is in n keeping - with the new spirit and 
new ‘needs of rural life. In order that social institutions may 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
10 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
be reshaped to twentieth-century demands, a high type of 
leadership is necessary. Society rightly looks to the prin- 
cipal of the new type of school to supply this leadership. 
The position is one of grave responsibility and of supreme 
importance. Such a leader must be well fitted by natural 
endowment for leadership, and must be unusually well 
trained in the technique and special skills required in the 
manipulation of the many details of his office. For the right 
type of person the rural-school principalship offers a splendid 
professional career. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. In what respects may the consolidated-school movement be compared 
with the junior high-school movement? 
2. Name the principal changes of recent years which have transformed 
many rural sections, and which have profoundly affected rural life. 
8. Explain why it is important at this stage in the development of the 
consolidated school that a practical demonstration of its value be 
emphasized. 
4, Name as many ways as you can in which the city school and the con- 
solidated school are similar. What problems belong to the rural con- 
solidated school that are not found or are of slight importance in the 
city school? 
' 6. From the introduction, the preface, and this chapter, frame a state- 
‘ment of the authors’ purpose. What is their concept of the purpose 
of education in general? 
6. List the chief defects in the old-type rural school. What advantages 
are there in regarding the consolidated school movement as a scheme 
to reorganize and redirect rural education? 
7 Point out the values in examining an inventory of one’s expected 
duties when at the point of beginning his training for the principalship. 
8. Classify the duties of principals, as given in Table II, as those of or- 
ganization, general administration, supervision, etc., and compare 
with Table I. 
9. Present evidence that the position of rural-school principal requires 
more from a man than the city-school principalship. 
10. Discuss the claim that a consolidated-school principal should have 
spent several years on a farm if he is to be successful in his position. 
11. Show the importance of a young man or woman obtaining some 
teaching experience before entering upon the duties of school prin- 
cipal. ‘

THE PRINCIPALSHIP —ITS REQUIREMENTS 11 
12. How do you explain the apparent disinclination of many members of 
the profession to look forward to rural-school service as a career? 
Does it necessarily follow that appointment to a city-school position 
is a promotion? Discuss.

CHAPTER IT 
WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 
Relations with the board. Among all the relations which 
the principal holds, none will be more important than those 
with the school board. He starts his tenure in a new posi- 
tion with certain marked advantages. The board is favor- 
ably inclined toward him. He has been selected only after 
the members have considered applications of from twenty to 
fifty candidates, and perhaps others who were not avowed | 
applicants. The members have looked over credentials 
coming from many parts of the country. In the end they 
have picked the person whom they believe to be best fitted 
for the particular position which they have to offer. Thus 
the principal ranks in their judgment above all the others 
whose services they knew to be available. 
It is on this favorable attitude that the new principal must 
build. He knows that the board members are with him. 
Usually this is not simply a passive interest which they dis- 
play. To a certain extent they wart their judgment sus- 
tained by the public. This can only be done by the prin- 
cipal’s demonstrating that the confidence of the board was 
well placed. The board therefore wishes to guarantee some- 
thing more than a fair field. With scarcely an exception, 
the members are willing to throw such support as they can 
muster to their school executive. Whether he retains their 
respect and confidence through the close codperation de- 
manded by the very nature of the relationship depends in 
some degree upon himself. 
Importance of the school board. To the person who has 
had little contact with the world of affairs, or who has a 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
narrow vision of democratic education, the school board may 
often seem superfluous. ‘To the person ambitious for results 
the board may appear over-conservative, ignorant of scien- 
tific administration, and too much inclined to busy them- 
selves over details which the principal is far better trained 
to settle. The broad-minded, capable, progressive educator 
of the type which the reorganized rural school demands will 
not be deceived by externals, nor misled by his own zeal and 
his own merits. He will see in the situation certain ad- 
vantages, limited mainly by his own capacity for under- 
standing and his practical sense. 
In the first place, he will find that the board members are 
usually among the best citizens in the community. They 
have been elected because the people are willing to trust 
them. They usually have had more training than the aver- 
age citizen of the district. Often they have made some suc- 
cess with their own affairs. They are honest, well-meaning, 
a little over-serious because of their responsibility, and a 
little over-anxious to please. Only in rare instances would 
one find board members who did not have the welfare of the 
school at heart. They also have a knowledge of the district, 
the school, the people, aud their past history which the new 
principal does not have. Here is something which he can 
learn from them. 
Agents of the State. Moreover, the school board mem- 
bers act as agents of the State. They are the legal repre- 
sentatives of the very institution, which the principal is 
pledged professionally to serve. (They have within their 
hands all the powers and duties which the supreme au- 
thority, the people, have seen fit to delegate to the school 
government. Such authority as the principal himself will 
exercise comes from them.) They may make it little or 
much, as they please. Héhas no recourse except to appeal 
to the sovereign people from which the board members draw 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 15 
their power. Even though the people may agree that the 
principal should exercise practically unlimited authority, 
they will be compelled to pass it on to him through the 
medium of some elective individual or board. In any case, 
the power which is rightfully his can never be greater than 
the power which the school board itself possesses. 
The power of the board members is never more clearly 
seen than in their control of school funds. They may not 
be parsimonious in respect to their own personal expendi- 
tures, and yet may exercise a caution in handling public 
funds that handicaps the school. They are likely to be sen- 
sitive to criticism on this point. Fearful of being charged 
with extravagance, waste, bad business judgment, and that 
extremely elastic thing which is colloquially known as 
“raft,” they may err on the side of over-caution. They are 
likely to be generous in proportion to their faith in educa- 
tion and in the principal. As they have entire control of 
budgetary matters, they may, in spite of the principal’s 
ability to manage the school, handicap it seriously. This is 
merely cited to show that a good school depends upon the 
maintenance of good working relations between the school 
board and the principal. 
There is almost no situation which can arise that will war- 
rant open criticism of the board members by the principal. 
When they will not be converted to his policies, and when he 
cannot in justice accept theirs, then he should resign. There 
can be no other principle involved that takes precedence 
over that of the welfare of the school, and it is clearly the 
fact that, save in unusual instances, the school cannot pro- 
fit by such a situation. He will also carefully refrain from 
passing comments of an uncomplimentary character about 
the board. The person who states that he has come there 
to show the old-fogy board how to run a school is inviting 
deserved disaster.

  16 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
The best school board. Several writers have undertaken 
to describe the best school board. Two values may be dis- 
covered from such discussion. First, there is supplied an 
ideal that may be realized in subsequent elections, or pre- 
served if already attained.! Second, a goal toward which 
the principal may work in the improvement of his board is 
set up. This goal should be attitudes, knowledge, judg- 
ment, etc., dissociated from sex or occupation of the indi- 
vidual. For example, some declare that women do not 
make as good board members as men. Assuming this to 
be true, no one will deny that certain women make much 
better board members than many men. Or, one may 
hold that doctors are more efficient school trustees than 
ministers. Without disputing the generalization, yet it is 
true that some ministers are far superior to some doctors. 
Such material as has been gathered represents a consensus 
of opinion on the subject. It has all the limitations of sub- 
jective data. Still, there is perhaps enough fact to supply a 
fair basis for conclusion, or, in other words, if the real truth 
were known the rankings would not be materially changed. 
Quoting from Struble’s? study we find 
The professions in general rank pretty high, at least in compari- 
son with the merchants who form the largest group. Ministers 
seem to make very poor board members. Lawyers, bankers, and 
  
1 It does not pay for the principal to enter local politics to the extent of 
interfering in school board elections. It is perfectly proper for him to make 
a statement concerning the issues involved in the election, if they are such 
as to threaten the progress of the school. He may also safely discuss school 
needs with individuals and with organizations, but he should not become 
partisan. He should say nothing that will reflect upon the policy of any 
board member who is a candidate for election, though such member’s 
record has been consistently against the principal’s own policies. Whatever 
action is discussed should be represented as the action of the whole board, 
and not as of individuals.

farmers tend to be conservative. Manufacturers, farmers, and 
bankers show unusual ability in financial matters. These same 
groups, however, rank low in educational policy. Housekeepers, 
doctors, and teachers seem to be especially desirable members with 
reference to educational policy. The housekeepers visit the schools 
almost twice as often as any other single group. 
One might expect a high degree of usefulness from those who 
have retired from business. School authorities are not of this 
opinion. .. . In regard to ages it 
the older men tiake the most d 
imum efficiency is reached between the fortieth and fiftieth year. 
Men below thirty seem to make very poor board members>++-Lhe 
valuableness of board members does not seem to increase with 
length of service. ... The distribution for women show that they 
do not make good board members. Educational policy is the only 
item in which they rank high.    
Drawing whatever consolation we can from the foregoing, 
let us see what board personnel the principal commonly has 
to work with. Here is a brief description of a large consoli- 
dated-school board: 
1. A housekeeper. No business nor professional experience. No 
children in school. A worker in church and community or- 
ganizations. Owes her election mainly to endorsement by the 
parent-teacher association. Visits school often. Likes to 
work on committees. Interested in the girls and the women 
teachers. 2 
2. A merchant. Runs a small store in the village. A member of 
many lodges and of the chamber of commerce. Prides him- 
self upon being a booster. Believes in anything that “brings 
trade to town,” or that attracts favorable attention. Very 
fearful of criticism. Seldom visits school, but attends board 
meetings regularly. Watches financial matters, and likes to 
be consulted as a business man. 
8. A doctor. One of the old school. Knows everybody and 
calls everybody by his first name, including the principal. Is 
easy-going, and generous. Jokes a good deal, and keeps 
people in a good humor. Is well liked, and has the confidence 
of the people. Will stand by his guns if need be, and is very 
loyal. Wants the best for the school and the community.

18 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
4, A banker. Liberal-minded and progressive. Sees the point 
before it is made. Appreciates punctuality, good organiza- 
tion, and business principles. Does not talk much. Is in- 
terested in maintaining a modern school. Is chairman of 
the board and has the confidence of the people. 
5. A farmer. A young man and graduate of an agricultural 
college. Owns a small place, and is just getting established. 
Not entirely approved of by other farmers because of his 
theories, but is genial, friendly, and the stand-by of the boys 
of the neighborhood. ‘Takes people on trust, undervalues 
himself somewhat, but is persistent when aroused. 
Without assuming that this is a typical consolidated- 
school board, the fact remains that the problem of the prin- 
cipal in its general aspects is much the same anywhere. 
His chief duty lies with the school, but in order that his work 
there may be successful he has certain relations with the 
school board. Varying more or less with time and place and 
personnel, his relations may be described as: (1) personal, 
and (2) professional. The first concerns the school in- 
directly, the second directly. The division of duties may be 
given as follows:   1. Personal. (In the sense that they are determined to a great 
extent by the composition of the board, the extent of the 
principal’s acquaintance with the members, and the pressure 
of other matters.) 
a. Establishing himself in the confidence of the board. 
b. Developing effective business procedure. 
ce. Informing the board of conditions and needs of their 
own school. 
d. Keeping the board informed respecting current school 
practice. 
e. Bringing educational principles to their attention. 
f. Keeping them interested in the schools. 
2. Professional. (In the sense that they are duties which imme- 
diately affect others. Belonging to the prescribed duties of 
administrative authorities.) 
a. Devising ways and means of financing the schools.
-P-A-G-E-33
  WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 19 
b. Introducing new activities and practices. 
ce. Reporting to the board. 
d. Meeting emergencies. 
e. Carrying on routine. 
Maintaining confidence. The principal should hasten to 
build upon the good opinion which the board has of him at 
the time of his election. One of, the first things he should do 
on reaching the seat of his new duties is to call upon the 
board members. At this time he should let them direct the 
conversation. If it shows a disposition to lag, he may stimu- 
late it by questions about the community and the school. 
He should refrain from adverse comments about the place 
from which he comes, and he should be struck by the good 
things in the community to which he is coming. He will be 
careful to avoid controversies. If statements are made 
with which he cannot agree, he will be too courteous to make 
them an issue. 
The purpose of the principal should be to form a genuine 
friendship with the board members. Associations are more 
satisfying as a consequence, and a better working basis is 
established. One of the most successful principals of the 
writers’ acquaintance makes it a point to pay each trustee a 
short visit every week. It may be for only a minute. 
Saturday morning is the time most frequently chosen. 
However, he never passes an opportunity to give each a 
friendly greeting, to deliver some message, to carry some 
interesting bit of news, or to make inquiry about his welfare. 
He seeks them out at public meetings, and he invites them 
to school affairs and professional gatherings. It is not pre- 
tense; it arises from a sincere interest in the members as 
individuals. 
Having gained the good will of the trustees, he should 
strive honestly to hold it. While his best recommendation 
to them will be found in carrying on an efficient school,
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
personal matters cannot be disregarded. All of his relations 
must be characterized by candor, sincerity, good nature, 
tolerance, and freedom from anything like complaint and 
“faultfinding. Let him show a willingness to listen to their 
views, and to concede a point now and then. If he has 
been in the wrong, let him confess it; if he disagree, let him 
do so kindly, and without leaving the inference that the 
others are hopelessly benighted. Good rules to follow are: 
consult with them frequently; applaud good ideas, from 
whatsoever source; do not make extravagant claims; and do 
not do all the talking. 
Effective business procedure. To a person who has been 
professionally trained, the hit-and-miss business methods of 
many school boards will be most appalling. He will feel 
particularly uncharitable toward the practice of transacting 
business without formal meetings, or of holding meetings in 
the doctor’s office or in the back room of the store. He 
should persuade the chairman to hold regular meetings — at 
least once a month. The school house is the logical place for 
these to be held. If there is no board room in the building, 
use the principal’s office. Take it as a matter of course that 
you are to attend the meetings. Have some good reason for 
being there in the beginning, if the trustees are inclined to 
look askance at your presence. One good purpose of women 
members on the board has been that meetings are no longer 
held in the barber shop or the garage, and less time is spent 
on matters not pertaining to the work of the school. 
A regular order of business should be adhered to. If none 
has been prescribed, draw it up yourself, and diplomatically 
bring it to the attention of the chairman. ‘The minutes of 
each meeting should be recorded. If the printipal has a_ 
secretary, she should keep the records. If he does not, it is 
well for him to volunteer the service himself. With regular 
meetings being held monthly, and special meetings as
-P-A-G-E-35
  WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD a1 
needed, there will be no necessity of transacting any business 
at any other time than in board meeting. The board has no 
legal standing except when sitting in authorized meeting. 
The members individually have no right to sanction the” 
purchase, say of a set of charts or of stereopticon slides, from 
salesmen who call upon them individually. A tactful sug- 
gestion that such procedure probably invalidates the action 
may be sufficient to bring about a change. Never should 
the principal encourage and abet such a practice. 
Keep the point uppermost that the meetangsare forthe 
transaction of business. Keep things moving along, and try 
not to prolong them liter than ten o’clock. This means to 
begin on time. Hold mere talking down to the minimum. 
If they want to tell a few jokes, smoke a few cigars, and talk 
over things in general after the meeting is adjourned, well 
and good. After the books are closed, it should be under- 
stood that any one is at liberty to go home if he wants to. 
It is not at all uncommon for board members to order 
changes in the plans and policies of the school. If the sug- 
gestion is a good one, and concerns a matter in which the 
principal has discretion, he may follow it if he sees fit. 
However, if it involves a decision which is properly one for 
the board to make, the principal should firmly refuse to act 
until the board has considered the proposition and approved 
it. Often he may forestall such a move by an aggressive 
trustee by asking for instructions in board meeting, explain- 
ing what the implications of the situation really aré. Often 
the most difficult lesson a principal is called upon to teach his 
board members is this, namely, that as individuals they have 
no legal authority whatsoever. 
Keeping the board informed. Generally speaking, the 
type of information which the principal brings to the board 
meeting should be that which will facilitate the transaction 
of business. For example, if they are going to consider the 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
22 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
advisability of voting bonds for a new building, he should 
have at hand all data pertinent to the subject. If he brings 
the facts not only will the work of the board be lightened, 
but it will be intelligent. This is one of the best ways to 
obtain their confidence and good will. If, on the other hand, 
he brings only opinion, and does not have that clearly formu- 
lated, he will likewise get opinion from the board instead of 
action, and stand a good chance of losing their support. 
Knowing in advance that a matter of importance is coming 
up, he should concentrate in collecting the needed facts. If 
possible, they should be put, in mimeographed or type- 
written form, in the hands of the members several days 
before the meeting.! 
In doing this important educational service, the principal 
must be impartial and fair. All the facts he has must be put 
on the table. Nothing must be concealed. This means 
those which are unfavorable to the proposal as well as those 
which show it in a good light. New teachers or new build- 
ings may be needed badly, but the values which result will 
never justify using improper means, such as showing condi- 
tions to be worse than they are. See that every one is clear 
on the full meaning of the data. Do not sit quietly by and 
permit a member to deceive himself concerning the true 
meaning of any table of figures, graph, or chart. Such hon- 
esty may cause one to lose some improvement upon which 
he had set his heart. The wise principal will accept the 
apparent defeat good-naturedly. He will not show any one 
that he is disappointed. At the same time he will not give 
up, but will persist in his effort unless it is clearly unfeasible 
and inexpedient to do so. He will continue to urge that 
1 Many principals supply each board member with a loose-leaf notebook 
large enough to take letter-size paper. In this notebook are put mime- 
ographed copies of the minutes, a map of the district with location of lines,

A number of lit-

physical examinations are given, report the results. Show 
how the eighth-grade pupils stand on a standardized test. 
Make such reports concise — ten minutes is enough time to 
give tothem. Bring more elaborate data to their attention 
through typewritten matter. If the principal can make 
charts and diagrams he will find that they are powerful aids 
in holding attention and in making his tabulations clear. 
Practices in other schools. Just as the trustees will be 
found to be interested in matters pertaining to their own 
schools, so will they appreciate being informed of what is 
going on elsewhere. This may be used for two purposes: ' 
(1) to interest them in plans which the principal may wish to 
adopt later on; and (2), to warn them against practices 
which might be suggested for adoption by some one else. 
Suppose, for example, that the principal wants to propose a 
survey of the school through the use of standardized tests. 
He may report what another school has done, what was 
found, and what the significance of the findings is. On the 
other hand, suppose he does not want the committee system 
of board organization brought in. He may point out the 
evils in the practice, as revealed by a survey of another com- 
munity. 
Publications come in here as allies of the principal who 
wants to educate his board. The custom of giving each 
board member a subscription to a magazine as a Christmas 
present is a good one. ‘The professional book shelf may 
well be placed in the room where the board meets. Except 
in particular cases, it is not worth while to recommend a 
professional book to a trustee. The best way to get one 
started on a book is to hand over a copy with the suggestion 
that he read what the author says on some subject that has 
been under discussion; or, in handing a book to a trustee, one 
may say, “Mr. A has something in chapter IV which I be- 
lieve you will find interesting.” Magazines may be re-
-P-A-G-E-39
  WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 25 
ferred to in the same way. Needless to say, the selections 
should be wisely made, whether they are found in books, 
magazines, special reports, or bulletins. 
Educational principles. Boards should be guided by 
sound educational principles. That they are not is a matter 
of common observance. The only source from which they 
stand at all likely to obtain these principles is their executive 
officer. He should, therefore, whenever the opportunity 
offers, bring them to the board’s attention. It is really to be 
regretted that no one has brought together the conclusions 
which have resulted from the many school surveys. They 
would form a small but serviceable handbook in school ad- 
ministration. If one could persuade the board members to 
read a single good book on school administration, such as 
Cubberley’s Public School Administration, most of his 
troubles would be taken care of. The following list is a 
fair sample of principles that make up the A B C of adminis- 
, trative practice: 
1. The committee method of board organization should be 
abolished. 
2. Details of administration should be attended to by the 
principal. 
8. The school board should concentrate on the larger problems 
i, of education, especially of that type which may be designated 
as legislative. 
4. No business should be transacted except at meetings with a 
quorum present. 
5. School employees, such as janitors and purchasing agents, 
should be under the direction of the principal. 
6. No teachers should be elected except on the nomination of the 
principal. 
7. It is uneconomical and unwise educational policy to occupy 
the time of the principal with teaching and administrative 
routine to the neglect of the supervision of instruction. 
8. A salary schedule should be adopted, and bartering with in- 
dividual teachers avoided.
-P-A-G-E-40
    . 
26 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
9. Specific matters of school management and instruction should 
not be discussed between the board and teachers and patrons, 
but they should be referred to the principal. 
10. Guidance in taking care of ordinary routine should be obtained 
from rules and regulations adopted by the board. 
Interesting the board. If the preceding suggestions are 
tactfully carried out, trustees that are not absolutely hope- 
less will be led to take an active interest in school affairs. 
In other words, the board is interested in the educational 
work of the principal if it is well done. He sees what the 
next step in the program should be, and he brings the board 
up to the point where the members see it as well. In the 
meantime the principal is leading them on to the next point. 
Certainly such educational work must not be done in a 
blundering fashion. If the first reaction to a new plan is 
unpropitious, it may be better to postpone his training along 
that line to one more promising of success. At all events, 
the principal should keep the board moving ahead. That 
such efforts are appreciated is shown by the remark of a 
board member to a new principal that he had learned more 
about school affairs in the half year which had just elapsed 
than he had in the whole of the years of the previous prin- 
cipal’s tenure. 
The rule should be invariably followed of recognizing the 
official position of the members, and of assuming that they 
are interested in the school. Public honors are few enough 
in village and rural sections, and the school trustees usually 
receive little appreciation of their services. The principal 
should help to make the office one of some importance. 
Let the domestic science department prepare a dinner in 
their honor occasionally, give them tickets to athletic events 
and entertainments, and reserve a place for them on the 
platform at commencement. If visitors come from the 
State department, take them around to call upon the
-P-A-G-E-41
  WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 27 
trustees, and never fail to give them credit for the com- 
mendable things that can be found in the school. 
Professional relations — ways and means. While there 
are abundant reasons in themselves for keeping up good 
personal relations with the board, largely they have their 
justification in the greater professional efficiency which re- 
sults. The schools are better because the principal works 
agreeably with the board. This second group of relation- 
ships — the professional — is of supreme importance, and - 
later chapters will be given to their elaboration. At the 
present time only sufficient mention is made to bring out 
their general nature, and their demand upon both the prin- 
cipal and the board. 
The joint financial responsibility stands at the top of the 
list in importance. Upon the board falls the duty of devis- 
ing ways and means of raising funds. Upon the principal 
falls the duty of planning an educational policy that can be 
realized with the resources at the command of the board. 
Expressed in financial terms, this program constitutes the 
budget. He must make sure that the school gets the money 
the board has taken provisions to raise. He must so ad- 
minister the expenditures that the results secured stand out 
as evidence of sound business and educational judgment. 
Principals should give unusual care to their work with the 
board on this score. Teachers do not have a very good 
reputation for financial sense, and a theoretical and im- 
practical principal may be a real barrier to educational 
progress. 
Introducing new activities. The principal must kecp in 
mind that it is not enough to convince the board that new 
subjects and new methods should be introduced. With a 
new principal in particular the board is likely to be quite - 
sensitive to public opinion, and the public also must be 
educated. The size of this task, combined with the neces-
-P-A-G-E-42
  28 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
' 
sity of looking after daily routine, necessitates the following 
cautions: 
1. That the principal do very little experimenting. The new 
devices and materials which he brings in ought to have been 
pretty well tried out. Such preparatory steps should have 
also been taken that their success in the new environment is 
nearly assured. 
2. That progress be made slowly. Many things may be in need 
of change, but some of them can wait. Look after the most 
pressing matters first. The people usually resent having the 
school turned upside down by a newcomer, and his reforms, 
though needed, may not have a fair chance. 
8. That the board be kept informed. If changes are being made, 
especially at first, be sure that the board knows what you are 
doing. This is more important if there is some objection 
raised. In general, the board should hear from the principal 
and not from busybodies and dissatisfied and skeptical 
patrons. 
Reporting to the board. In addition to the frequent and 
perhaps informal reports to the board, the principal also is 
expected to prepare an annual report. This may be more 
formal in type, and ought to be printed or mimeographed. 
It should contain, first of all, such data as are required in 
official reports to State and county authorities. Brief ex- 
planations of the tables, and comparisons, graphs, and 
photographs are desirable. Long-drawn-out interpretations 
should not be indulged in. As this report also goes to the 
public, a statement of matured future policies is desirable. 
As these policies belong to the board no less than to the 
principal, the former should be consulted in its formulation. 
The annual report is not presumed to be the only medium 
of publicity. As discussed later, many agencies and means 
1 One caution concerning publicity is necessary. No board member nor 
the principal should “talk out of meeting.’ No one has a right to make 
statements concerning the board’s policy or its action until he has been 
authorized to do so. If a board member shows a disposition to reveal
-P-A-G-E-43
     WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 29 
should be depended upon for keeping the school in the public 
eye. The actual responsibility for this is one that the prin- 
cipal must take. Only the general policy needs to be passed 
upon by the board. The beginning may be so gradual, the 
program so unobtrusive, that perhaps no mention of a pub- 
licity program may be needed. The main point here is that 
the formal, public report is to be a joint product so far as 
planning is concerned, and that the publicity policy itself is 
one for mutual agreement. 
Meeting emergencies. Unlooked-for situations will occa- 
sionally arise, even in the best managed schools. A trans- 
portation unit breaks down, new equipment must be had, 
the heating plant gets out of repair, an epidemic breaks out, 
a blizzard comes up — these are a few of the many things 
which put new demands on the principal’s executive ability 
and initiative. At such times he should act promptly and 
with decision. When something must be done is no time 
to be consulting the school board. Handle the emergency 
as well as you can and take the consequences. Report the 
circumstances, but make no apologies for acting. 
Carrying on routine. The routine work of the school 
should be carried on with as little reference to the board as 
possible. It is not a part of their duty to attend to matters 
of detail. It is the principal’s duty to do so. ) It is a mark 
of a poor executive to be running to the directors with every 
little problem that comes along. If he cannot attend to such 
matters, the board will soon begin to look after them. The 
first thing he knows he is reduced to the status of errand boy 
for the board. Do not ask the board whether you should 
hold a teachers’ meeting, dismiss the primary grades at two- 
official ‘“‘secrets,”” the principal should find occasion to get the board to 
adopt a resolution declaring that some designated member of the board or 
the principal shall give out information to the public. It is very bad 
practice to tell ““what we are going to do,’’as it stirs up unnecessary cpposi- 
tion and, if failure results, leaves the administration in a ridiculous position,
-P-A-G-E-44
  30 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
thirty, use the school building for a parent-teacher meeting, 
or enter a team in the State debate. Matters of routine 
should be reported as done, not as things contemplated. 
With but few exceptions the principal should accept the 
responsibility in full for executive action. He should never 
hide behind the board. It is a mistake to go before the 
pupils or the teachers with a statement that the board orders 
this or that to be done, or refrained from. It is always a 
weak or an ignorant teacher who issues orders in the name 
of the principal. A principal who is worth his salt will stand 
up and take the responsibility for the school program. 
When he can no longer do this he will resign. Only when his 
authority is brought into question will he refer to the board 
decision or order, as shown on the minutes. 
Principles of board relationships. For the purpose of 
emphasis the more important principles governing the rela- 
tionships of the principal and the school board may be 
repeated: 
1. A basis for cobperation should be laid in the cultivation of a 
real friendship with the board members. 
2. All relationships should be marked by a spirit of open dealing, 
good nature, mutual confidence, respect, and tolerance. 
8. The principal should set himself to the continuous task of 
educating the board in improved business procedure, and 
better educational practices. 
4. He should recognize the official position of the board members 
in every way possible, and help to make the place respected 
and honored. 
5. The board can coperate only to the degree to which they are 
acquainted with the principal’s plans and policies. He should 
consult the members freely and should keep them informed as 
to the conditions in the school. 
6. Every endeavor should be made to interest the trustees in the 
school. In order to do this the school should be kept con- 
stantly before them. 
7. The principal must be prepared to accept complete responsi- 
bility for the acts of the board, as long as he is in its employ,
-P-A-G-E-45
  WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD 31 
8. Only matters of general policy should be brought before the 
board by the principal. Minor matters and all routine should 
be reported only as accomplished. Decisions on such matters 
should be made without hesitation. When emergencies arise 
he should act promptly. 
Summary. A principal who cannot get along with his 
school board caunot succeed. To do this may require of 
him considerable adaptability and a large element of pa- 
tience. Board members usually compare favorably with 
other people in the community. They are the repository of 
all the legal authority back of the school, and_the principal 
has no powers except those they delegate to him. The ex- 
tent of his powers is therefore a measure of the confidence 
which the board has in his integrity and his ability. The 
principal who is well-balanced, well-trained, and who has a 
clear vision of the function of education will usually have no 
difficulty in working with the school board. His contacts 
are of two kinds: the personal, in which his duties apply to 
the board directly; and professional, in which his duties to 
the board are combined with duties to the public. It is 
seldom that the principal will find himself handicapped by a 
board all of whose members are unprogressive, dishonest, 
and indifferent to the needs of the school. Most of them 
want to do the right thing. The greatest error the principal 
ean make is in assuming that they should be ignored. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. Point out some of the things which a new principal can learn, to his 
advantage, from the school board. 
2. Cite examples of the powers which are granted by State law to school 
boards. Is there any power or duty which the board cannot delegate 
to the principal? 
8. If endeavoring to interest a school board in the introduction of a new 
subject in the consolidated school, what arguments would you put 
before the merchant described on page 17? What would probably 
be most convincing to the housekeeper? '

4, Show why it is bad policy for a new principal to pass adverse come 
ments on the place rom which he comes to the board members in his 
new residence. 
5. Suppose that one MS ciober of your school board is inclined to do too 
much talking at board meetings. Is there anything which you can do 
to restrain him? 
6. Draw up an order of business that you would be willing to recommend 
to your school board. 
7. Discuss the necessity for rules and regulations. What subject should 
be covered by such regulations? 
8. Distinguish between the duties of the principal, as distinguished from 
the duties of the board, in respect to: (1) the curriculum, (2) the plan- 
ning and contracting for a new building, (3) using schoo] equipment, 
(4) the selection of textbooks, (5) the purchase of school supplies, (6) 
employing and assigning teachers. 
9. A school board member comes to the principal privately and suggests 
that a young man, whom the board member names, be nominated for 
driver of one of the school busses. He reminds the principal that the 
young man’s father is a heavy taxpayer, a little unfriendly to the 
school, and that the young man is out of work for the winter. What 
attitude should the principal take on this matter? 
10. Make up a list of desirable practices which the principal may wish to 
bring to the attention of the school board, with the idea in mind of 
getting their consideration of the matter later. List a few which he 
should mention for the purpose of preventing favorable consideration. 
11. Are there any instances you can cite when it is advisable for the prin- 
cipal to consult the school board on matters of detail? Discuss. 
12. Under what conditions may a teacher or a janitor be justified in bring- 
ing a complaint or a request directly to a board member? 
18. Suppose there was something not of very great importance, which 
you believed should be done, but upon which the board had not de- 
clared a policy. Suppose also that you were a little doubtful if they 
would approve the policy if approached beforehand. Would you feel 
inclined to report the thing as done rather than as contemplated?

CHAPTER IT 
THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM 
  Importance of good financiering. All the material factors of 
school success cost money — buildings, land, equipment, 
teaching, and supervision all make their demands upon the 
community resources. The most beautiful educational pro- 
gram will fail unless it is adequately financed. As the one 
who plans and executes the program, the principal is also 
mainly responsible for its financial support. This does not 
mean that he can produce funds where they do not exist, nor 
that he should become a promoter, indifferent to the welfare 
of the people, provided only he can exact enough money 
from them to keep the school going. Good financing means 
that he try to keep a fair balance between the needs for edu- 
cation and the ability of the community to supply those 
needs. It also means that the ratio between expenditures 
and results should be kept as high as possible. 
Perhaps nothing the principal can do will give him higher 
standing in the community than obtaining a reputation for 
sound financial sense. It is on this basis that the business 
men of the community will judge him. They will be far 
more willing to accept his views on the curriculum when they 
know he has a keen appreciation of economic values. This 
is true, even of the most careless and improvident people of 
the district. ‘They feel more or less contempt for the absent- 
minded and impractical visionary that is so often associated 
in their minds with the teacher. The management of a 
consolidated school is too big an enterprise to entrust to such 
a person. It is usually the biggest business in the com- 
munity, and it is a bigger business than that to which any
-P-A-G-E-49

trustee gives all of his time. The principal should, there- 
fore, be a better business man than any member of the 
school board. 
The problem a critical one. ‘The relative size of the 
budget makes the problem a critical one. Rural and small- 
town people are very conservative and suspicious on money 
matters. Thg§ is not because they lack generous impulses, 
but because ty have had no experience in doing business 
on a big sca The individual wealth is usually quite 
small, and thew total personal transactions often figure up to 
only a few hundred dollars a year. They have formed un- 
changeable habits of economy and self-denial. In the light 
of their limited knowledge of affairs, the budget of the con- 
solidated school seems stupendous. 
Other elements tend to make the situation difficult. 
Taxes generally are high. Even where they are not, some 
are likely to feel that the school burden is unnecessarily 
heavy. The demands from other sources are on the in- 
crease. More money is being spent for roads, bridges and 
health than ever before. Economic questions are the main 
topic of discussion. It is not surprising that people should 
be more critical of public expenditures, and that they should 
insist upon the justification of every dollar of expense. The 
conclusion is not that retrenchment in school expenditures is 
advisable. On the contrary, these points probably are argu- 
ments for an expansion of education. They do signify, 
though, that financial matters are to be handled judiciously 
and with full understanding of what is involved. The 
responsibility for doing this falls squarely upon the shoulders 
of the principal. 
Knowledge required. In order to attend to his share of 
the financial duty, the principal will need to possess definite 
knowledge of the situation. He should inform himself as to 
the sources of the school income, and the amount derived 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
  36 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
from each source. He can obtain the first information from 
the State school laws, with possible reference to such special 
Federal Acts as the Smith-Hughes measure. He will find, 
to be exact, that the school’s income is derived from the 
following sources: National (vocational education); State 
(taxes, permanent funds); County (taxes); local (taxes, 
tuition, sales, bonds, miscellaneous). 
The proportions vary so greatly that the is no general 
rule. The importance of knowing the facts not reduced 
thereby. If the local district contributes th¢ major propor- 
tion, the problem is just that much more delicate to handle. 
There is greater need of keeping the public interested in the 
schools. Publicity of the type which shows “where the tax 
dollar goes” and what is received for it is indispensable. 
The facts should be found in the clerk’s books. If they are 
not easily obtained there, take them from the record of the 
county superintendent. 
Apportionment. The second necessary item of informa- 
tion is apportionment. The basis for this may also be found 
in the State school laws. Aside from the conventional value 
in being informed on everything that concerns the school, 
the principal needs to know the basis of apportionment for 
two reasons: (1) to enable him to check the funds to see that 
they are correct, and (2) to give a basis for estimating the 
receipts of the following year — an essential step in the pre- 
paration of the budget. The law on this point will also 
probably determine the policy of the board concerning tui- 
tion charges to pupils who may come from outside of the 
district. 
Other public expenditures. It will also be to the advan- 
tage of the principal to know the sources and amounts of the 
other public expenditures of his community or district. 
The funds available to public use are first of all limited. 
The amount is estimated at around five to seven per cent of
-P-A-G-E-51
  THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM 387 
the net social income. In cities, from twenty-five to sixty 
per cent of all public expenditures go for schools. We 
should expect a larger percentage to go for education in the 
smaller cities and rural areas, where improvements in the 
form of paving, sewers, parks, libraries, police protection, 
fire protection, and salaries of officials are small items. The 
competition against other departments is correspondingly 
less. If, however, other expenditures are contemplated it is 
well for the principal to know of them in order that he may 
anticipate the effects of these upon the school budget. It 
would be unwise, generally speaking, to launch a building 
program at the same time the village council had a paving 
project under way. 
Taxation and assessment. While collecting the other 
facts, the principal should inform himself on the tax situa- 
tion. He should know, first of all, what the tax rate is, and 
upon what forms of property it is levied. It would be worth 
while to know what percentage of the wealth of the district 
is escaping taxation, but information of this kind is seldom 
available. He can and should find out the percentage which 
the assessed valuation is of the real value. He may be sur- 
prised to learn that in his district property is assessed at no 
more than thirty per cent of its actual value. This may 
make the tax rate seem unusually high, while in an adjoming 
district, where property is assessed at sixty per cent of its 
value, the rate may seem very low. This point should be 
watched carefully when comparisons are being made be- 
tween the tax rates of different districts. 
People are very likely to give a good deal of attention to 
the rate of taxation, and very little to the rate of valuation. 
School boards sometimes get a reputation for economizing 
over the past years by the simple device of getting the pro- 
perty values raised. By this scheme they may actually 
raise the taxes, but deceive the people because they at the 
  
-P-A-G-E-52
  38 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
same time lower the rate. On the other hand, assessors usu- 
ally base their valuations upon the amounts of money to be 
raised. In some districts the assessed valuation has not 
been changed for years, and the total taxes have also re- 
mained unchanged. Considering these circumstances one 
might suppose that the district has not been growing in 
wealth, and might form a poor opinion of its ability to sup- 
port schools. The probability is that it has greatly in- 
creased in wealth, but that the assessor has kept valuations 
down, and has done it because taxing officials have not asked 
for more money. rf 
Bonds and bonding limits. The school laws will also 
prove a source of information respecting methods of bond- 
ing, and bonding limits. The prescriptions are far more 
rigid in respect to these matters than the principal may 
suppose. In spite of the fact that serial bonds are far 
superior to term bonds, and that taxation is often preferable 
to bonding at all, it is often true that term bonds are the only 
recourse. The bonding limit is usually five per cent of the 
assessed valuation. Here again is seen the importance of 
knowing the assessed valuation and the possibilities of in- 
crease in valuation, either by the act of the assessor or by 
the growth of wealth. 
The problem of indebtedness comes in at this point. A 
district burdened by debt is likely to tend to become con- 
servative. If it is not a growing community, the psycho- 
logical effect of debt is usually bad. Considerable money 
must be raised every year for debt service or interest 
charges, or both. Often there is no other means of financing 
building projects. The principal, when making his financial 
survey, should find out the amount of indebtedness, the pur- 
pose for which it was incurred, the rate of interest, and the 
steps which have been taken to make payment. If the 
money was borrowed at a high rate of interest, it may be
-P-A-G-E-53
THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM 39 
possible to take up the old bonds and issue new ones in their 
place at a lower rate. If the time of payment of the bonds is 
optional this can often be done. Bonds of the term or 
sinking-fund type are often voted, and then the board neg- 
. lects to lay a tax to take care of the bonds. The first thing 
the board and the people realize the bonds are due, and there 
is no money on hand to pay them. 
About the only thing to be done under such circumstances 
is to vote more bonds, and dispose of them as advanta- 
geously as possible. In at least one State the law is such 
that, under these circumstances, the new bonds must bear 
the rate of eight per cent in order to be marketable. This, of 
course, is an exorbitant rate. The principal should look 
after this matter at once, and, if things have not gone too 
far, he may not only be able to save the district considerable 
money, but he may also save the board embarrassment. 
Sometimes the building for which the bonds were levied is 
worn out before the bonds are paid, and the district is un- 
able to build a new one. 
The principal should also investigate any sinking funds. 
It may be that the law permits the deposit of such funds 
with the banks. It may also turn out that the district is 
receiving no interest on its deposits. In fact, such payments 
when made have more than once been known to go into the 
pockets of the district treasurer. Sometimes the bank, or 
favored bank officials, reap the benefit. In counties where 
the contests over the county treasurership are really con- 
tests between rival banks, the principal may suspect that 
some one reaps a profit off of public funds. Whether this 
happens or not, he should know what the conditions are 
respecting the funds of his own district. If the simple ex- 
pedient of drawing money from one bank and putting it in 
another will result in the school’s receiving two to four per 
cent on its deposits, such money will go a long way toward 
taking care of the debt service. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
40 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
Types of bonds. A word may be said at this point con- 
cerning the different types of bonds. In the first place, a 
bond is nothing more than a note or pledge, agreeing to pay 
a given amount with interest at a specified time, or at a time 
optional with the district. In general, they are of two 
types: (1) serial; and (2) term. 
Serial bonds are so named because they are not all paid at 
one time, but in a definite order. Suppose that a district 
bonds for $40,000, and issues serial bonds of $1000 denomi- 
nations. It may arrange that two of these bonds shall be 
paid off the year succeeding their issue, and two more bonds 
each succeeding year until all are paid. All debt would then 
be cleared off in twenty years. This plan requires a suffi- 
cient levy each year for debt service to take care of the 
bonds coming due, and to pay the interest on the unpaid 
bonds. Thus the payments are heavier during the early 
period, when the improvements for which the bonds were 
issued are new and before expenditures for maintenance 
commence to come in. ‘These bonds command a higher 
price on the market, and are more easily disposed of. 
Term bonds are so named because they become due at the 
end of a definite period — usually twenty to thirty years.. 
In order that they may be paid off when due, an annual levy 
is usually made and put on deposit in some bank, or in- 
vested in some safe security that can be disposed of readily. 
Interest is paid annually or semi-annually, as in the case of 
serial bonds. Under this plan the amounts paid out for 
interest may exceed the original issue. Sinking funds are 
liable to embezzlement, may be lost through bank failure or 
through bad investment, and are also a source of temptation 
and bad practice. In many instances bonds run even forty 
years. Sometimes sinking funds are not provided, or are not 
levied and collected when provided for, and the bonds come 
due without the district’s being prepared to redeem them.
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM 41 
The public should be instructed as to the most desirable 
typeof bonds. Ina survey of one Western State, it has been 
estimated that if serial instead of term bonds had been 
issued the people would have been saved three million dollars 
a year. Yet in this same State when a group of business 
men were asked to designate which is better, serial or term 
bonds, all but two out of the thirty-six chose term bonds. 
Another point is also of importance. An investigation by 
the California Taxpayers Association disclosed that it was 
quite common for districts to issue twenty- even thirty-year 
bonds for from $500 to $1000, amounts so small that they 
could easily have been cared for by a small tax. In some 
cases the cost of printing and holding the election equaled 
a fourth of the value of the bonds. Needless to say small 
issues should never be put out, twenty years is the maxi- 
mum length for a term bond, and bonds should never be 
issued to pay current expenses. 
Expenditures. The principal will often find it more diffi- 
cult to get the figures covering expenditures than the figures 
for receipts. The totals can be found in warrant books, 
requisition stubs, receipted bills, and the treasurer’s books. 
Too often the data are not itemized enough to be a good 
guide to future needs, and may be so sketchy and so general 
as to defy perfect classification. In the planning of a 
scientific budget such facts are a necessity, and, if they are 
lacking, so much the more argument for beginning an ac- 
counting system that will supply them in the future. In 
apportioning expenditures, standards are highly desirable. 
Standards drawn from three investigations are given below: 
(1) West’s California High Schools (1922), (2) Updegraff’s 
volume on Financial Support in the Rural School Survey of 
New York State (1922), and (3) Strayer’s City School Ex- 
penditures (1906). ‘The second, which is based upon figures 
from small-city and union high schools, is probably the best 
guide for the principal of the consolidated school.

The budget. Only a few States as yet make the prepara-   tion, publication, and administration of a budget compul- 
sory. Large cities are better represented. This fact com- 
bined with the agitation for a national budget, and the more 
critical attitude of the public towards its finances is rapidly 
forcing budgetary practices into use. The progressive prin- 
cipal will not wait until it is legislated into his school, but 
will voluntarily inaugurate the plan. It is business-like pro- 
cedure, and it makes for better planning, more efficient ad- 
ministration, and stricter accountability. 
A budget is a statement of the expected receipts and ex- 
penditures for a succeeding period. Usually the period is a 
year; sometimes a biennium. It is the educational program 
expressed in dollars and cents. It requires an approval by a 
duly qualified board, and an authorization to collect the

revenues and to make the expenditures. The legislative and 
executive functions of the board and the principal are clearly 
shown in the four steps in budget preparation. They are: 
1. Preparation of the budget (by the principal). 
2. Adoption of the budget (by the school board). 
8. Administration of the budget (by the principal). 
4. Enforcement of accountability (by the school board). 
Form of the budget. If the State law requires the budget- 
ing of school funds, the necessary forms may be obtained 
from the department of public instruction. If it does not, 
the principal will have to prepare his own form. ‘The first 
one should be correct in order that comparisons from year to 
year may be made. ‘This is not possible if the form under- 
goes changes from year to year. The form recommended by 
the United States Bureau of Education is satisfactory.! 
It is a good idea to itemize closely — at least closely enough 
1 See Bulletin Number 3, 1912, for classification of items. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
to make understandable the purpose to which the funds are 
to be devoted. At the very minimum the form should show: 
1. Receipts: 
a. From national, State, and county sources. 
b. To be raised locally. 
2. Expenditures: 
a. Current expenses (salaries, fuel, supplies, ete.). 
b. Debt service (interest, bond redemption, etc.). 
ce. Capital outlay (buildings, grounds, etc.). 
The budget should be prepared and voted close to the end 
of the fiscal year. If the year ends June 30th, the new bud-: 
get ought to be voted at least by that date. It ought not to 
be ready much earlier, because unexpected contingencies 
may arise between the time of voting and the date the bud- ~ 
get goes into effect. It ought not to be much later, because 
since legally no money may be drawn until it is voted in the 
budget, the principal may find himself handicapped for lack 
of funds. After the budget is voted, the principal should 
have a free hand in its administration. If readjustments are 
necessary. such as shifting money from one fund to another, 
the approval of the board should be obtained. It is always 
a dangerous thing to juggle funds, and the necessity for 
doing it usually indicates bad planning. 
Budget forms will differ somewhat in form, depending 
upon the size of the district to be served and the method of 
accounting in use. As an illustration of a typical budget, a 
form is given below that complies in essential points with the 
standards set by the United States Bureau of Education:

Accounting. A system of accounting should be adopted 
that conforms to the classification found in the budget. If 
this is not possible under the forms prescribed by the State, 
the principal has one of two alternatives. He can change 
his budget classifications to meet the accounting system, or 
he can put in a new accounting system for his own use. It 
is entirely impracticable to divide the budgetary headings on 
one basis and the accounting forms on another. The two
-P-A-G-E-62
  
48 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
must be adjusted to each other, and, as the budget is in 
reality a functional analysis of the activities of the school, it 
ought to take precedence. 
The accounting system should be a simple one. There 
should be no more forms than are necessary to enable one to 
record all authorizations for purchases, the receipt of pur- 
chases and payments therefor, and such summaries as will 
show one, at any time, total receipts and expenditures and 
balances remaining in the respective funds. The minimum 
number of forms needed are as follows: requisition blanks; 
bill and receipt file; warrant book; inventory book or file; 
ledger. 
Requisition. Nothing should be purchased without pro- 
per requisition. For large amounts, the formal order of the 
board recorded in the minutes amounts to a requisition. 
All requisitions for supplies, and for minor repairs and re- 
placements, should be issued by the principal. In a small 
school or in a school unused to the practice, it may be well to 
permit the chairman of the school board to approve all 
orders. Ina large school system, the requisitions should go 
from the principal to the clerk or other purchasing agent. 
The latter makes the purchases, sees that the goods are re- 
ceived, and is responsible for recording the transaction. He 
does not decide what shall be bought nor when purchases 
shall be made. This is the duty of the principal. A sample 
requisition form for his use is shown on page 49. 
All requisitions should be made out in duplicate. The 
original should be given to the merchant or person who sup- 
plies the goods or service, and the other filed to be used as a 
check on the goods when delivered. No purchase should be 
recognized that has not been registered on a regularly signed 
purchase order. Unless such a system is followed, schools 
may be under the necessity of paying bills twice or more, as 
without records there is no way of determining whether a

files, and one to be attached to the warrant in payment. 
'The duplicate requisition will serve as a check on all pur- 
chases, and will at the same time give the exact standing of 
fall minor items of indebtedness. 
Inventories. Inventories are usually regarded as more or 
less of a nuisance, and, when taken at all, are perfunctory 
md unused. The principal of the modern school should not 
ake such an attitude. In the first place, he needs the in- 
‘ormation contained on tke inventory sheets to guide his
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
purchasing — the kind, quality, amount, and price. In the 
second place, the inventory serves as a check upon the care 
taken of equipment and supplies, and the degree to which 
they are wisely and economically used. Supplies should be 
distributed from some convenient room, probably near the 
principal’s office. The total amount of supplies on hand 
may be entered in itemized form on a large card which may 
be tacked up on the wall. At the top of the columns may 
be written the names of the teachers. When they take out 
supplies they check the date and the amount under their 
names. If preferred, a simple memorandum form may be 
used, each teacher recording on a sheet the supplies she 
takes. The principal or his clerk collects the memoranda at 
given intervals and checks up on the quantity used and the 
quantity remaining. 
Janitor, shop, garage, and laboratory supplies have to be 
handled in a slightly different way. These may be delivered 
directly to the janitor, the garage foreman, or the teachers 
in charge, who are charged on the principal’s supply record 
with the totals. They then work out such system of keeping 
informed of the amounts of each article on hand as seems 
most convenient. A large card, similar to that suggested for 
the classroom supplies, is ordinarily sufficient except in the 
shops, where charges to individual pupils are made. Here 
the requisition system in duplicate is most acceptable, the 
pupils drawing up the requisitions themselves, the teacher] 
acting as storekeeper. He should summarize his requisi- 
tions frequently enough to insure that his stock is not run 
ning too low. This is a matter of office routine, and no 
immediately concerned with the larger problem of account 
ing. 
Inventories of equipment should be taken annually. Th 
work should be systematically and conscientiously done

intelligible to an outsider and will supply the information 
which the principal needs in replacing or adding to it. 
Separate sheets may be made for each type, and space left 
for several years. Such a sheet should provide a record of: 
. 
2. DID OB 00 Type of furniture or equipment. 
Description, including catalogue number, trade name, 
quality, ete. 
. Date of purchase. 
. Cost or inventory value. 
. Cost of any repairs and date repairs were made. 
. Estimated rate of depreciation. 
. Inventory value. 
. Any credit through sale or abandonment. 
Statements. At least every year the principal should 
have brought together the pertinent facts relating to the 
finances of the school. Such financial statements should 
comprise: 
1. The balance sheet, listing: 
2. a. All assets of the district —cash on hand, buildings, 
equipment, furniture, and supplies, ete. 
b. All liabilities, such as unpaid bills, unpaid bonds, war- 
rants outstanding, and any temporary loans or other 
obligations. 
c. The net investment of the district in buildings, grounds, 
and equipment. This equals the difference between the 
assets and the liabilities. 
Receipts and disbursements. Here bring together all re- 
ceipts showing source and amount, with balances remaining in 
each fund from the succeeding year. Shows also all expendi- 
tures with balances remaining in the various funds, the latter 
being the difference between the estimated expenditures as 
budgeted and the actual expenditures. 
. The statement of costs shows the total disbursements, less the 
capital outlays. To the disbursements should be added de- 
preciation on the school properties (from two to eight per 
cent a year), interest on any indebtedness (obtained from 
the county treasurer or auditor), and interest at from four to
-P-A-G-E-66
    52 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
six per cent on the amount the district has invested in the 
school plant and its equipment. This total cost, divided by 
the number of pupils in attendance, gives the per-pupil costs 
of running the school. 
The complete history of the financial transactions of the 
year make up the main feature of the typical annual report. 
This is practically always required by law, and should com- 
ply with the legal requirements. The main points covered 
in the budget should be dealt with, and the summaries, in 
the form of the financial statements indicated above, should 
be included. Full publicity should be given to this report. 
This means that whenever possible a printed copy should be 
put into the hands of every patron. The more important 
facts should also be published in the local paper, and may 
form the topic of discussion at a meeting of the community 
organization. Needless to say, graphs and comparisons 
should be freely utilized, and the original forms from which 
the data are drawn should be open to public inspection. 
Financial principles. The principal of the consolidated 
school will find that no capacity he may have in other 
necessary lines of school work will compensate for short- 
sightedness, carelessness, and general ignorance in financial 
matters. The success of the school depends to no small 
degree upon the financial management of the principal, and 
his efforts are more likely to be ultimately successful if 
carried on in accord with such basic principles as the fol- 
lowing: 
1. An understanding of the actual resources of the district, and 
the prevalent methods and practices of financing public ¢ 
activities. 
2. School expenditures are conditioned by the faith of the 
public in education, and the confidence of the public in the 
financial acumen and integrity of the school authorities. The 
principal should therefore, in every way possible, enhance the 
values of both education and its management.
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM 53 
8. As standards for school expenditures are relative rather than 
absolute, the principal should keep informed as to expendi- 
tures in other districts. 
4. Honest publicity to school matters, financial and otherwise, 
help to build up the confidence of the public and to make 
easier the financing of the schools. 
5. Education on financial matters should be carried forward by 
the principal, in order that the people and the board will 
adopt the best practices. 
6. Anything approaching promotion of the schools for selfish 
purposes should be prevented. The future of the school 
should not be imperiled by practices that give an apparent 
present-day advantage. This applies particularly to the in- 
curring of indebtedness, both in amount, kind, and purpose. 
In general only serial bonds should be issued and only for 
capital outlays not capable of being financed by other means. 
7. Careful consideration of resources and needs should be taken 
care of through the preparation and discussion of a school 
budget. While some latitude may be permitted in respect to 
the budget, the first year or so of experience with it, in the 
course of time it should be followed inflexibly. 
8. Any financial system to deserve the name must contain a 
simple but adequate method of accounting and reporting. 
Summary. If schools are to exist at all they must be 
properly financed. It is one of the main duties of the con- 
solidated school principal to see that this is done. He ought 
first to inform himself fully concerning the financial condi- 
tions of the district. He should know the school laws, the 
forms used, the wealth of the district, and the source and 
disposition of the school income. He should know what 
kind of financial guidance his board needs, and see that it is 
supplied. It will not be his purpose to keep the board from 
spending money, nor to lead them to extravagant expendi- 
tures. Rather he will decide upon an educational program 
in proportion to the needs and abilities of the district, and 
will interest the board and the community in it so that they 
will provide for its support. One of his first steps should be
-P-A-G-E-68
    54 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
to lead the board to adopt a budget. His second responsi- 
bility is to see that the budget is wisely executed. His third 
step is to make sure that a complete and easily comprehen- 
sible record is kept of every item of expense, and last of all to 
inform the public, both formally and informally, of the dis- 
position of the funds. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS

  CHAPTER IV 
BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 
The importance of good management. As has been shown, 
the most important business problem of the principal is con- 
cerned with the school’s financial problems. Only secon- 
dary to this in a business sense is the problem of the internal 
management of the school. In a village or consolidated 
school almost all the duties of this type fall upon the prin- 
cipal. Even where he is furnished a‘clerk he still has the 
responsibility for seeing that the work is well planned and 
well done. In no sense should he feel that business and 
office management are unimportant. They are very neces- 
sary. They must be cared for in order that the real purpose 
for which the school exists may be carried forward smoothly, 
accurately, and with dispatch. The principal should there- 
fore have a clear understanding of what his business duties 
are, and of the most efficient methods of performing them. 
The main aim of business management is economy of 
time. By a skillful ordering of business matters the prin- 
cipal may not only insure that they are attended to effec- 
tively, but he may also free himself more and more for edu- 
cational management. He needs to have, above all things, 
a good sense of relative values. Some things are of vital 
importance. Others might be neglected altogether with 
slight loss. Some matters must be attended to at once. 
Others may be postponed to the future. If the principal 
does not develop this sense of values he may find himself 
neglecting the duties upon which the life of the school 
depends, while he gives his time to minor affairs which 
might go undone, or which any clerk can be employed to do

at the rate of fifty cents an hour. While appreciating the 
importance of the business management of the school, he 
should realize that after all it is only a means to an end. He 
should keep in mind then that it is done as expeditiously as 
possible, and with the minimum of demands upon his time 
and effort. 
Planning the program. The first step to take in introduc- 
ing efficient methods is to plan the program. In a general 
way this may be done by referring to the table of duties in 
Chapter I, and classifying them as follows: 
1. Routine duties. Those which must be looked after daily, 
such as: 
a. Attendance. 
b. Examining and answering mail. 
ce. Inspecting the building and playground. 
d. Conferring with teachers. 
2. Periodical duties. Those which must be cared for regularly, 
but at longer intervals, such as: 
a. Making reports. 
b. Meetings of teachers and of parent-teacher associations. 
ce. School assemblies. 
8. Special duties. Those which cannot be foreseen, so far as 
time of their occurrence is concerned, such as: 
a. Meeting callers. 
6. Taking care of discipline cases. 
4. Fill-in duties. Those which may be taken up or put aside at 
convenience, such as: 
a. Tabulation of school statistics. 
6. Preparation of forms. 
ce. Checking and ordering supplies. 
d. Making course of study. 
It is always a good idea for the principal to plan his pro- 
gram in respect to his own situation. In order that he may 
know how his time is being distributed, it is suggested that 
he keep a careful record for at least two weeks. To do this 
he should extend the list of page 8 as much as possible, 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 59 
assigning to each duty a number. He should next rule a 
piece of paper horizontally into six spaces (one for each day 
of the week) and vertically into as many five-minute periods 
as there are in his working day — say, from eight to five 
o'clock, or eight hours. He keeps the record by putting into 
each square the number corresponding to the duty in which 
he is engaged. This may be illustrated by the form below, 
which covers the hour 8 to 9 for two weeks: 
  
  
  Monday   
  
Tuesday   
  
  
Wednesday] 
  
  
Thursday 
  
  
Friday 
  
Saturday   
                          ee eee el ee 
At the end of the period the amount of time given to each 
administrative duty should be computed, together with the 
hour of the day assigned to it. The principal should next 
eliminate any unnecessary task, and should cut down the 
time assigned to each to the very minimum. Instead of 
making these reductions arbitrarily he may discover that, by

60 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
the use of mechanical devices, by working on schedule, and 
by guarding against interruptions some real savings may be 
made. After reducing the time limits as far as is compatible 
with efficiency, he may lay out the administrative program 
in schedule form. The standards on page 8 may be used in 
order to help him keep the right balance between administra~ 
tion and supervision. He will then have a plan of work, 
somewhat like the following: 
8-30 to 8-50 Inspection of building and grounds. 
8-50 to 9-00 At entrance, to confer with teachers or pupils. 
9-00 to 9-30 Office — check attendance, examine mail, tele 
phone. 
9-30 to 10-30 Supervision. 
10-30 to 10-45 Conferences with pupils, teachers, and visitors, 
10-45 to 11-45 Supervision. 
11-45 to 12-00 Office — special and fill-in work. 
1-00 to 1-30 Office — conferences, attendance, ete. 
1-30 to 2-30 Supervision. 
2-30 to 2-45 Clerical work. 
2-45 to 3-30 Supervision. 
8-30 to 4-00 Conferences. 
4-00 to 4-10 Lay out program for next day. 
The principal’s office. It will be observed that the sched- 
ule prescribes a maximum of two and one half hours of office 
work. This may be lessened by the fact that it is often more 
economical of time for the principal to confer with teachers 
and pupils in their rooms. This tends to reduce the office 
period to about two hours a day, at the most. The amount 
of use, combined with the purposes for which used, deter- 
mine what the office lay-out and equipment should be. Of 
course, if the principal is fortunate enough to have a clerk, 
the office will be occupied the entire day and the amount of 
routine and fill-in work correspondingly increased. In any  
-P-A-G-E-75
  BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 61 
event, however, he will find that the office is related to the 
following functions: 
1. A place where records are eo —letters, reports, pupils’ 
grades, ete. 
. A place for conferences with isis, teachers, and visitors. 
. A place for clerical work, mainly of the fill-in type. 
. A place for communication, such as by telephone, letters, ete. 
A place for storage of supplies, blank forms, ete. 
. As the school library. & 
orm

On the basis of this brief analysis of functions, the space 
needed is of three types: 
1. Waiting room. 
2. Conference room. 
8. Storage room. 
An analysis, from the point of view of determining needed 
equipment, shows the need of: 
. Chairs. 
. Desk and tables. 
. Filing cases and storage shelves. 
. Typewriter and mimeograph apparatus. 
. Letter boxes for teachers and janitor. 
. Telephone. >

Arrangement of office and equipment. The office should 
be located near the main entrance. The door should be 
plainly marked, and an invitation to enter without knocking 
should be posted upon it. The reception or waiting-room 
should be light and well-ventilated, and a few comfortable 
chairs should be placed within it: a half-dozen at the most 
will be needed, as it should not be the custom of the principal 
to keep any one waiting long. If a clerk is employed, her 
desk should be at one end of the waiting-room, and a low 
railing may serve to shut off her portion from that open to 
the genera] public. It is somewhat to the advantage of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
principal to have his own office reached only by passing 
through the gate leading to the clerk’s room. 
The door to the principal’s office should also be marked. 
Generally it is better to leave the door open. Opening from 
the office should be a small closet for the principal’s belong- 
ings. A toilet with lavatory, lighted from outside if pos- 
sible, should also be provided. ‘The storage space should be 
accessible from the office, and also from the corridor. It 
should be of sufficient size to hold all blank forms, office 
supplies, general school supplies, and such textbooks as are 
supplied free. 
The office equipment should be simple and inexpensive. 
The desk should be of the flat-topped type, the drawers 
clearing the floor by some six or eight inches. The roll-top 
desk is untidy, and encourages the habit of leaving work 
undone. The desk should be kept clean and free from piles 
of paper, cards, blotters, and the like. An ink-well anda 
memorandum file are about the only things which should be 
found upon the desk. ‘The drawers may be used for sta- 
tionery, pens, pencils, cards, erasers, clips, and the like. If 
a typewriter is used, keep it on a separate stand. Generally 
speaking the desk should not provide filing space. Instead, 
file pupils’ records in cases particularly suited to the size of 
the forms, and use a plain steel case for correspondence. 
Have a place for everything, and know where that place is. 
The chairs should be comfortable and of good quality. 
They should be arranged informally, certainly not lined up 
against the wall like a recitation bench. Some attention 
should be given to making the room attractive-looking. An 
open bookcase, filled with substantially bound books, is an 
item that lends atmosphere. A small magazine table may 
be placed in the waiting-room, and on it displayed a few good 
magazines. This is the place for the ubiquitous daily 
paper, so often found cluttering up the principal's desk,  
-P-A-G-E-77
BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 63 
Well-chosen window curtains, a few flowers, and a few pic- 
tures of good quality will go a long way towards transform- 
ing the shabby, dull, and forbidding den often occupied by 
the “office principal” into a bright and business-like looking 
room, suitable for a modern school executive. 
Handling callers. Callers should be received in the same 
spirit that marks the office — simplicity, cheerfulness, and 
efficiency. All should be greeted courteously and invited in. 
As the principal’s time is precious, he cannot devote much 
of it to any one. If they want information, give it to them 
promptly. If they want to visit classes, take them to the 
room in which they are interested and turn them over to the 
visitors’ committee composed of pupils. If there are several 
in the waiting-room at the same time, do not call them into 
the private office one by one, but go out and find out as 
quickly as possible what each one wants. Some matters can 
be attended to inasecond. Others may demand longer con- 
sideration. If there is something that seems to require a 
private conference or the collection of information, ask the 
individual to wait a few minutes and proceed to take care of 
the needs of others first. If several must be granted longer 
time and the hour is late, try to make an appointment for 
another date. 
A number of situations will arise where the principal must 
listen to the visitors’ stories. It should be his rule to deny 
no one a fair hearing. It should also be his rule never to 
give way to anger or to discourteous speech, however great 
the provocation. All minor matters should be settled 
promptly. Decision should be reserved on unusual pro- 
blems, and those in which the principal is not in possession of 
all the facts. In deferring a decision, state the reason and 
indicate at what time you will be prepared to make it, and 
then keep the promise. In order that nothing of this sort 
may be overlooked the principal should make a memoran-  
-P-A-G-E-78
    64 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
dum of it, and place it in his desk file on the date agreed 
upon. In conclusion it may be stated that, while the prin- 
cipal must handle visitors expeditiously, it must be remem- 
bered that country people and village people take more time 
than do city people. They like to visit, and often seem 
unaware of the value of the principal’s time. This fact will 
have to be taken into account in handling callers, and will 
probably cause the principal to use even more tact than a 
city-school situation requires, and to be more liberal in his 
time allotment to visitors until he is well established and 
well acquainted. 
Letters and telephone. Unless the principal has a clerk 
he will have no time to answer his correspondence during his 
scheduled hours. He should run through his mail hastily, to 
discover whether it contains any particularly pressing mat- 
ter. If there is, of course, the day’s routine should yield to 
it. Ifhe has a secretary, he can turn over many letters to 
her for reply. He should read the answers, and sign them. 
No person who has mastered the elements of administration 
will ever permit a letter to be sent out marked “Dictated but 
not read.”’ Letters that are worth answering at all should 
be answered promptly. The motto “Attend to To-day’s 
Letters To-day” is a good one. Carbon copies of im- 
portant letters should be made, and filed with the corre- 
spondence to which they relate. 
The telephone should be used sparingly. By no means let 
the impression get abroad that you can be found at the tele- 
phone at any time. Use it only when absolutely necessary, 
and train the people to call you up only during office hours. 
Do not make yourself an errand boy for every patron who 
takes the fancy to call up his children to remind them of an 
errand. Do not permit the pupils to come into the office to 
use the telephone indiscriminately. Do not employ it for 
social purposes; keep it for business matters, and use it
-P-A-G-E-79
  ‘BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 65 
during the period specified on the daily schedule. If it 
rings at other times, one will generally find that no serious 
loss occurs from failure to answer. When using it observe 
the etiquette appropriate to the treatment of callers — 
courtesy, decision, expedition. 
The school mail boxes. Within the waiting-room and 
opposite the clerk’s desk should be placed the school mail 
boxes. These may consist of plain pigeon-holes, four by six 
inches in size and with thin partitions. These should be 
accessible only from the waiting-room unless locks are sup- 
plied, in which case they may be reached from the corridor. 
There should be a box for every teacher, for the janitor, and 
for such student officers as the president of the senior class 
and the manager of the athletic teams. The principal will 
find the mail box a most convenient method of getting com- 
munications to the teachers and to the janitor. Teachers 
may also desire to communicate by this means with their 
fellows and with the principal. It will ensure that the boxes 
are not forgotten if the teachers’ arrival-and-departure 
register is put on a small shelf near the mail box. Every 
teacher should be expected to check in the time of her 
arrival at school, both forenoon and afternoon. 
As an addition to the mail-box method of communicating 
with the janitor, it is a good idea to use a work sheet. This 
may be nothing more than a large piece of cardboard ruled 
for the days of the week. As the principal makes his daily 
inspection of the building and grounds he may note repairs 
that ought to be attended to, rubbish that should be cleaned 
up, paint needed, walls in need of cleaning, or window panes 
to be replaced. The principal records these on the janitor’s 
work sheet, either in words or in symbols, and designates the 
place. At subsequent inspections he checks up to see if the 
work has been done. While in a small school such a device 
may be superfluous, it usually has the effect in any school of
-P-A-G-E-80
    66 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
bringing prompt action from the janitor, and in a large 
school is a great time saver and convenience. 
Building inspection. A few minutes should be devoted by 
the principal every morning to building and ground inspec- 
tion. One of his purposes is to see that everything is ready 
for the day. Another is to note the care that is being taken 
of the plant and its equipment, to observe whether there is 
anything which is likely to cause accident or injury, and 
what repairs or replacements should be made. He will also 
observe the character of the janitor’s work, and the sanitary 
condition of the premises. 
In doing this work he cannot trust simply to cursory ex- 
amination. There are five hundred or more building details. 
A number of these should be attended to each time — it is 
safe to say at least fifty of them. He should list these on a 
card or sheet of paper and take it with him on his tour of 
observation, observing each in turn. He will soon get 
acquainted with the best order of the items on his list, and 
on a separate card or in his memorandum book can make 
such notes as he deems desirable. His object will be in this 
respect to take action of some sort, either by calling the 
defects to the attention of the janitor and seeing that he 
remedies them, or by other means. Among the many 
matters which he will pass in review are the following: 
1. Exterior of building and the grounds: 
a. Do the shrubs, flowers, and lawn need care? 
6. Are the pupils marking or otherwise defacing the walls 
or playground apparatus? 
c. Is any of the playground apparatus in such condition 
that pupils are likely to be injured by it? 
d. Is the playground clean and free from rubbish? 
e. Are there any windows broken or otherwise in need of 
repair? 
@. Interior of building: 
a. Is the temperature of the corridors and rooms what it 
should be?
-P-A-G-E-81
  
BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 67 
Are the floors, walls, ceilings, and windows clean? 
. Are the boards clean and in good condition? 
. Has the furniture and equipment been dusted? 
. Are the window shades in working condition? 
. Are the teachers’ and pupils’ desks tidy and clean? 
. Have maps and other equipment been stored away in an 
orderly manner? 
. Are there desks or other furniture and equipment in 
need of repair? 
2. Is there a sufficient supply of toilet paper and towels in 
the racks? 
j. Have the rooms apparently been ventilated? 
k. Are there any obvious fire hazards — waste, paints, 
oils, ete. — under the stairways, in the closets, etc.? 
1. Are there marks and defacements, or other injuries ap- 
parent on the walls, floors, furniture, etc.? 
m. Are the janitor’s quarters clean and orderly and reason- 
ably free from fire hazards? ~~ Suekoe 
Records and reports. Inadequate and poorly-kept re- 
cords are very often found in village and rural school sys- 
tems. The reason for.this condition is that principals have 
not realized the importance of school data. Employers are 
coming to insist on having the whole school record of a boy 
before giving him a position. In passing to higher schools 
the facts pertaining to earlier school life is desirable. A 
scientific guidance plan — educational and vocational — is 
impossible without them. The forms used, the type of data 
collected, and the way in which the data are kept are also a 
good index to the business ability of the head of the school. 
It is plainly evident that recording practices and lack of 
practices now go on in schools which would not be tolerated 
. for an instant in any up-to-date business establishment. 
The subject really includes many details. In taking up 
the matter the principal should first consider what type of 
data heavants to collect. This will be determined by the use 
which he anticipates for them. In respect to mere forms he 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
68 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
should list as many routine matters which require written 
communications, and which should be dealt with in a uni- 
form manner, as he can find. Excuses for absences, requ is'- 
tions, attendance reports, registration, promotion, transfers, 
health notices, and reports to parents are good examples, 
We may for cozvenience classify these forms as (1) records 
and (2) communications, though both serve in different de- 
grees these two functions. Perhaps a better classification 
would be to consider the first as a permanent source of 
information, and the second as a temporary source of in- 
formation. The same general principles apply to both: 
1. They should be simple. This means that they may be filled 
in quickly, found easily, and understood. 
2. They should be standard. This means that they should con- 
form to the same specifications from year to year, and when 
practicable should be the same as those used in other schools, 
stock sizes, etc. 
8. They should when practicable be uniform. This applies es- 
pecially to those that serve related functions, 
4. They should not contain too much. 
5. They should be inexpensive. 
6. They should be time-saving, not time-consuming. 
Naturally, the forms used will vary somewhat with the 
size of the schools, and more particularly with the range of 
activities carried on in them. Health-record forms are un- 
necessary where there is no health work; forms for recording 
intelligence-test results are only needed where such work is 
_being done. In general, the following list comprises almost 
all that the average consolidated school will use: 
I. Permanent record forms. 
1. Registration cards for name, date of birth, sex, name and 
address of parents, nationality and occupation of parents, 
previous schooling, ete. 
2. Health examination cards for height, weight, defects, 
_ sickness, nutrition, ete.

  70 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
Mention has been made of record cards rather than of 
record books. The former are in most instances preferable. 
Books are generally bulky, hard to handle, inflexible, and 
inconvenient. It may take an hour or more to find and copy 
the record of a single student from the old type of grade 
book. Data can be transcribed quickly and easily from 
cards, they do not take up much space, and are readily filed 
and found. Books of course are entirely unsuitable for the 
temporary or communication form of record. 
The usefulness of cards is dependent upon form and size, 
and also upon the way in which they are filed. If they are 
of irregular and various sizes so that they cannot be filed in a 
uniform way, if the data on them are poorly written and too 
varied and complex, then they are also clumsy and incon- 
venient. Standard three by five, six by eight, and eight and 
one half by eleven (letter size) are suggested. Filing cases 
with index pads should be purchased and used. It is possi- 
ble to have the cases made in the manual training depart- 
ment at slight expense. For the letter-size cards the ordi- 
nary letter files are satisfactory. The cards may be filed 
alphabetically, by subject, by a number system arbitrarily 
determined, or in line with the Dewey Decimal library sys- 
tem. Sometimes it will be advisable to file by grades or 
rooms, or by the old district areas which have been combined. 
into the new district. 
A year’s supply of forms should be ordered before the 
opening of the new school year. These should be stored in 
the supply room. It will be to the advantage of the prin- 
cipal or clerk to prepare an index of the forms on hand. To 
do this the shelves on which the supplies are placed should 
first be numbered. These numbers are then recorded on a 
large sheet of cardboard, together with the kind and amount 
of forms to be found on each. As forms are withdrawn, a 
record of the date and number is made on the card. This
-P-A-G-E-85
  BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 71 
record card should be tacked up on the wall at a convenient 
height to read. The principal may then tell at a glance just 
what supplies and the quantity of each are on hand. 
Handling school funds. A vexing problem of business 
management hinges about the handling of funds derived 
from entertainments, fairs, athletic contests, and similar 
community or pupil enterprises. The business matters per- 
taining to such enterprises should be handled as scrupulously 
as the larger financial transactions of the district. They 
offer an opportunity to teach a lesson in business manage- 
ment that is of itself of no small educational value. It is 
better if the principal does not actually handle such matters. 
In no case should public moneys be mixed with his own 
private funds. It will help a great deal if the school has a 
bank. All the funds may then be deposited and paid out 
through the bank. ‘This includes book fines, charges for 
materials in manual training, book and breakage deposits, 
pupils’ savings, and moneys belonging to the athletic asso- 
ciation and other social organizations. A few suggestions 
concerning the steps to take to safeguard such finances are 
given as follows: 
1. A budget should be prepared for all activities of the regular 
sort. This should contain an estimate of receipts by sources 
and amounts, and objects of contemplated expenditures. 
2. Receipts should be taken for every transfer of public money. 
No money should be paid out except on order of the respon- 
sible agents. 
8. Complete records of receipts and expenditures should be kept. 
These should be in good form, and open to the inspection of 
the principal and other interested parties at all times. 
4. A full report of all financial transactions of this kind should be 
made to the public every year. 
Principles of business management. The *broblems in 
this field which the principal must solve are so numerous and 
varied that the statement of guiding rules is very difficult. 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
    72 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
Most of them apply no less to the general question of organi- 
zation as well as to the minor administrative matters taken 
up here. Among the many that may be cited the following 
are of most importance: 
1. In order to economize time and prevent an undue emphasis 
upon business and office details, to the neglect of the more 
important duty of administration, the principal must weigh 
every duty and assign it its rightful place in his daily 
schedule. 
2. The office and equipment should be arranged with reference 
to the special functions each are to serve. They should 
bring into relief the conception of the principal as a business 
and educational expert. 
Every person in the school and the community has a right to 
a share of the principal’s time. Callers should be received 
courteously, and their business given due consideration. 
4. Non-essentials should be treated only as fill-in duties, and 
should never be permitted to engross the principal to the 
neglect of anything of greater value. System for its own 
sake, red tape, and servitude to office routine should not be 
tolerated. 
5. Foresight should be used in providing necessary appliances 
and mechanical aids to office efficiency. It is oftener more 
economical and generally more satisfactory to invest in low- 
priced clerical help and in machines than to tie a high- 
salaried principal down to work demanding a low grade of 
skill. 
Recording and filing devices should be of such a character 
and so well used that any necessary item of information may 
be found at a moment’s notice. The decision as to what is 
necessary will be based mainly upon the function such data 
can serve. ce cd 
Summary. The principal must not only be able to help 
direct the larger financial policies of the district, but he must 
also have skill in handling the internal administrative details 
of the school. In order to do this he must know the ele- 
ments of business management. Such knowledge will not 
only enhance his reputation in the community, but will alsa
-P-A-G-E-87
  BUSINESS AND OFFICE MANAGEMENT 73 
result in his having more free time to give to supervision. 
The management duties themselves are weighty, and abso- 
lutely necessary to the progress of the school. His first step 
should be to take an inventory of the usual administrative 
tasks. He should eliminate any that are not justified by the 
aims and immediate needs ofthe school. The others should 
appear upon his working program. He should constantly 
try to reduce these in number, or to improve his skill in 
handling them that he may from time to time shorten his 
routine schedule. He should keep in mind that the aim of 
good management is to economize time. Among the many 
routine, periodical, special, and fill-in tasks may be listed 
inspecting the plant, meeting-calling, taking care of corre- 
spondence and telephone, preparing and filing records and 
reports, and guarding the organization funds. His per- 
formance of all of these duties should be marked by sim- 
plicity, accuracy, fidelity, and dispatch. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. Make up a list of articles of furniture and equipment which you be- 
lieve is essential for the office of a principal of a fifteen-teacher school. 
What would be the cost of such equipment? 
2. Assume that, in the same school, a space twenty-four feet wide by 
thirty-two feet long has been set aside for administration. Plan the 
lay-out, including partitions, placement of furniture, ete. 
8. Explain what is implied in the term “office principal.” 
4, Why is it worth while for the principal to give care to the equipment, 
arrangement, and appearance of his office? 
5, A good many principals are unwilling to give any time to the represen- 
tatives of reputable book companies when they call. Is this attitude 
the right one? Discuss. 
6. Suppose the county superintendent calls at the school to inspect the 
work, Should the principal call the visitor’s committee of pupils to 
show him about the school, or should he go himself? 
7. Show how following a definite program for hours for the use of the tel- 
ephone, the answering of letters, and interviewing pupils adds to the 
principal’s efficiency. 
8. Point out the disadvantage in the principal’s carrying messages to

pupils and teachers at the request of patrons who have telephoned to 
him. 
9. Work out a sample form that might be used as a “‘work” card for the 
janitor. 
10. Suppose the principal finds, on his morning inspection trip, that one 
room invariably presents a disorderly appearance — books on the 
desks, library books disarranged, teacher’s desk untidy. What course 
should he take to bring about improved conditions? 
11. Discuss the advisability of requiring the janitor to make regular 
monthly reports to the principal. What should be the nature of such 
reports if they are made? 
12. Prepare a card that can be put up in the supply room for the purpose 
of showing where supplies are, and the quantity of each on hand. 
\18. Give reasons for and against the principal acting as treasurer for school 
moneys derived from entertainments, athletic contests, and the like. 
How does a school bank help to simplify this problem?

  CHAPTER V 
THE TEACHING STAFF 
Importance of the teacher. The adage, “As is the teacher, 
so is the school,” has been repeated so often that it now has 
all the force of an axiom. Of no one can it be said with 
greater truth than of the consolidated-school teacher. Mi- 
grations to and from the community are fewer than in the 
city. The effect of her efforts are therefore manifested 
within the district itself, so that the future progress, the 
moral force, the happiness, and the material prosperity re- 
veal directly the power of the teacher to make education 
function in daily life. A lawless, indifferent, quarrelsome, 
idle, shiftless community is an untaught community. The 
presence of social and civic ills, moral perversions, and eco- 
nomic decay unfailingly point out the lack of good teaching. 
The rural and village community, whatever the condi- 
tions, are likely to be fully aware of the teacher’s presence. 
They know her personal affairs; they take stock of her com- 
ings and goings. Her merits and defects are frequently the 
topic of conversation on the street, in the parlor, and at 
fraternal gatherings. Every one knows every one else, not 
casually but intimately, and every one has an absorbing 
interest in the affairs of every one else. The influence of 
any member of the community may be measured by her 
ability to withstand this white light of publicity, and the 
teacher is no exception to this rule. Finally, the estimation 
in which the people hold the teacher personally is the estima- 
tion in which they hold the school. History, educational 
tradition, and respect for learning in the abstract weave no 
spells over the minds of the rural population. Literally 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
THE TEACHING STAFF 77 
the teacher is the school; her importance is its importance; 
and the faith in her personally is the faith in the school. 
Type of teacher demanded. It is evident from the fore- 
going — and doubly evident to one who has ever lived in a 
rural community — that only a superior type of teacher will 
suffice. The consolidated school makes a dual demand upon 
the teacher. She must be able to teach the classroom sub- 
jects with approved efficiency. Moreover, she must be able 
and willing to take her’share of the community burden. 
She must help keep the community activities going, and at 
the same time help to lift them to a higher plane in both type 
and method. At least one fourth of the good teacher’s 
service must be given outside the classroom. 
The school work itself is likely to call for a high degree of 
versatility. She may have to be shifted from one grade or 
department to another on short notice. She may be called 
upon to take charge of subjects, at least temporarily, for 
which she has had no training. Unexpected interruptions to 
the placid running of the daily program will not be unknown. 
She will perhaps at times be the victim of village narrowness 
and prejudice. She will need such traits as courage, per- 
sistence, good nature, ability to codperate, common sense, 
and energy that will outweigh in values anything claimed to 
result from the study of formal courses in college and normal 
school. 
The selection of teachers. The selection of this type of 
teacher can only be performed by the principal himself. If 
the board shows an inclination to take over the selection of 
the teaching force, the principal should set himself to edu- 
cating them on the subject. He may follow the methods 
suggested in Chapter II. He may convert one member of 
the board, and have the suggestion that the principal nomi- 
nate the teachers come from him. He may insert a regula- 
tion to this effect in the code of rules adopted by the board. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  "8 _ THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
He should assume that the responsibility is his, and long 
before the board is thinking about teachers for the next year 
he should be deciding upon suitable members of the staff. 
He can then, at the opportune moment, suggest to the board 
that they consider certain names for the vacancies. 
In other words, the principal should solicit applications 
from the best teachers he knows of. He may know some of 
these personally. He may get in touch with others through 
the appointment bureaus of the normal school and the uni- 
versity. He may even ask a fellow principal or a superin- 
tendent to suggest teachers from his corps that meet up 
with certain specifications. He should have as full and 
complete information on every applicant as he can get, and 
should have it presented in such form that the basis of his 
decision in favor of one rather than another is clear. 
The wisdom of such preparation is undeniable. In a con- 
solidated school district, where the clerk of the board had 
been in the habit of controlling the selection of teachers, the 
principal made preparations to forestall him. He obtained 
two applications for each of the three vacancies from teach- 
ers, any of which would have been a creditable choice. His 
information concerning each one was very thoroughgoing. 
On the evening when the subject of the election of teachers 
came up, the clerk offered his usual list of miscellaneous 
applications. After these had been glanced through, the 
principal produced the credentials of the other candidates. 
On the face of the data presented these were obviously so 
superior to the others that the ones designated by the prin- 
cipal as the best were elected without discussion. 
The application. The foregoing indicates that it is better 
for the principal to solicit applications. Instead of choosing 
from the group that offers services, he should seek out the 
teachers he needs. This is the more scientific way. How- 
ever, the principal should not ignore inquiries and applica-
-P-A-G-E-93

THE TEACHING STAFF 719 
tions that come to him unsolicited. On the other hand each 
should be acknowledged, and an application blank of the 
school enclosed. ‘This form should give the date on which 
teachers are elected. After the election is over, the applica- 
tions of the unsuccessful should be returned with a word of 
thanks for the privilege of considering them, or they should 
be put on file. Whatever is done in this respect, the appli- 
cants should be notified of the results. If the burden of 
writing personal letters is too great, send a form notice. 
The references should be put on file or destroyed. They 
should never be sent to the applicant. If from an appoint- 
ment bureau they should be returned to it promptly. 
The application blank is important. While the principal 
should concern himself mainly with asking for information 
that reveals the candidate’s fitness for the position in ques- 
tion, he may extend his inquiries beyond the minimum. 
The candidate having an interest in the application is ob- 
liged to furnish whatever pertinent information is asked for. 
While a photograph may be asked for, no principal will seri- 
ously maintain that he can judge teaching ability from even 
an honest product of the photographic art. Some of the 
items asked for are not to be considered in determining the 
applicant’s fitness. For example, height, weight, and place 
of birth may help satisfy the board’s curiosity, but are not 
correlated with competence. Whether the principal asks 
the applicant’s church and political preference depends 
wholly upon local conditions. One thing he will avoid, and 
that is the absurdity of asking the applicant to pass on his 
own ability to discipline, cobperate, teach, or manage ath- 
letics. Put plainly, he will go to the applicant for facts 
which can be verified; to the references for estimates of the 
applicant’s ability. The application blank may call for 
facts along the following lines: 
I. Personal matters — age, height, weight, place of birth, 
married or not, etc. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
II. Professional matters — place, date, amount, and kind of 
training; place, date, amount, and kind of teaching experience; 
extra-curricular training and experience in directing extra- 
curricular affairs. 
III. Outside matters — experience in work other than teaching, 
positions of honor held, ete. 
IV. References — a list of names of people with addresses to whom 
the principal may write for information concerning qualifica- 
tions. 
The reference. The reference blank should be a very 
simple one. It should be possible for one to fill out the form 
without referring to records and without spending much 
time over it. In general, one will ask for estimates of the ap- 
plicant’s character and ability, and not for factual informa- 
tion. If direct questions are asked, or relative ratings re- 
quested, the references are likely to be more reliable than the 
letters resulting from the request to “‘tell what you know 
about the applicant’s qualifications.” The letters are usu- 
ally general, and may deal only with the good qualities; 
direct questions require direct replies, either favorable or un- 
favorable. When the form is also of such nature as to de- 
mand an estimate on a scale running from poorest to best, 
the principal has a basis by which he can compare the abil- 
ities of candidates for the same position. Since we do not 
have perfect instruments for measuring teaching ability, any 
estimate is probably unreliable. This does not lessen one’s 
obligation to get as reliable estimates as possible and to 
accept the applicants that rank the highest. 
Open letters of reference should not be accepted. It is 
doubtless a fact that rural and village school boards are im- 
posed upon more by letters of this sort than are city boards. 
Professional-minded principals and superintendents now re- 
fuse to give open letters. Since teachers usually name the 
writers of the confidential recommendations, one may as- 
sume that they will not mention any one whom they believe

will blacklist them. How much more likely it is that open 
letters are exaggerated flattery and pious generalizations. 
In the last analysis, it comes down to the point where the 
principal must put a good deal of dependence in the judg- 
ment and honesty of his fellows as expressed in their confi- 
dential letters. A form which brings out: the salient qual- 
ities is shown herewith. (See page 81.) 
If the principal desires to express the rating of the teacher 
in figures, he can do so by assigning values of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 
1 to the descriptive terms Excellent, Very Good, and so 
forth. He may take the average of the totals and by this 
means havea single term. He is then ready to compare the 
standing of one applicant with another. From the applica- 
tion blank and perhaps a personal interview he may form his 
own judgment, which he should also put upon one of the 
reference forms. Whether he combines his own rating 
equally with the judgments of the references depends upon 
how reliable he considers it to be in comparison with theirs. 
Tn some cases he may weight his own judgment as twice as 
valuable as any one else’s, In other cases he may discount 
it considerably. The importance of the qualities will also be 
considered. Conditions may exist in the school where abil- 
ity to discipline should be weighted twice as much as 
scholarship. 
Training. There is a marked tendency to demand two 
years’ training above the high school for elementary teachers, 
and four years for high school teachers. In schools that can 
compete favorably with city schools for teaching services it 
is a good idea to adopt these standards. Other schools will 
find it impossible to hold to these requirements. Under 
such circumstances, the principal should try to find teachers 
that stand high in teaching ability, personality, character. 
and willingness to codperate, though formal training be less 
than these amounts. That is to say that he will not refuse
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE TEACHING STAFF 83 
to consider a teacher otherwise promising because she has 
had but one year of normal school work or three years of 
university work. Proved efficiency instead of ability to 
meet some arbitrary standard will be the rule. It can be 
truly said that we do not know how much training a teacher 
should have, neither are we positive as to the kind it should 
be. 
No matter how well equipped the teachers may be, the 
priacipal is under obligations to help them to the extent of 
his powers. This “improving teachers in service” is em- 
braced in the term “supervision.” The subject is too broad 
and too detailed for discussion here. The principal should 
acquaint himself with Cubberley’s Principal and His School, 
Burton’s Supervision of Instruction, and the many current 
publications on the subject, of which those issued from the 
State Department of Education, Baltimore. Maryland, are 
good examples. The principal who employs the best teach- 
ers he can, and then works persistently and intelligently to 
improve them as much as he is able, is much more likely to 
succeed in developing a good school than a principal who is 
indifferent about the matter. 
Experience. Just as there is no reliable data on the con- 
tribution which length and type of courses make to teaching 
efficiency, so opinion is divided respecting the value of ex- 
perience. Few people hold that the greater the experience 
the greater the efficiency. Many believe that after five or 
six years experience fails to add anything to the teacher’s 
ability. We have to make some allowance for individual 
teachers, and some for the kind of experience. Undoubtedly 
there are teachers whom no amount of experience, whatever 
the kind, will cause to make progress. There are others who 
profit by any kind and any amount of experience; others 
who profit by some kinds of experience and not by other 
kinds. Probably the conclusion is that it is safer to invest
-P-A-G-E-98
84 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
in teachers who have had at least two or three years of 
demonstrated success. We should also be a little chary of 
teachers of twenty or twenty-five years of experience who 
base their claim for consideration mainly upon this fact. 
Local teachers and nepotism. Both of these factors enter 
into teacher employment. ‘They are especially likely to crop 
up in one form or another when considering home teachers. 
Local people are often urged for teaching positions. They 
may be friends or relatives of board members. They may 
belong to prominent and influential families. As at some 
time or another this problem comes up before every prin- 
cipal, a few suggestions concerning the course of action may 
not be amiss: 
1. An absolute rule against the election of a relative of any 
board member or principal should be made and enforced. 
Nothing leads more quickly to disaster than nepotism. 
2. Unless there is some prejudice in the community against 
local teachers, their qualifications should be considered upon 
their merits, and not upon whether they are local or not. 
8. To ensure the introduction of new ideas it may be advisable 
to have a few teachers in the school who have had experience 
in other systems. A policy of this kind should keep a fair 
balance between outside and home teachers.     
     
    
    
          Practically the same conclusion may be reached concern- 
ing married teachers. It is not a question of whether teach- 
ers are married or not. It is a question of ability to teach. 
| Some married teachers are preferable; others are not. The 
husbands of some married women may show a disposition to 
interfere with the school. This tendency, if it exists, is 
generally offset by the tendency of the relatives of single| 
women to meddle in school affairs. If the principal selects 
teachers as individuals, and avoids condemning or approvin 
on purely general grounds, he will seldom go astray. 
The salary schedule. One should not try to operate th 
school without a well-defined salary policy. This should b
-P-A-G-E-99
THE TEACHING STAFF 85 
prepared by the principal or the principal and teachers 
working together, and adopted by the school board. If it is 
possible to have the schedule printed, a copy may be sent 
out with each application blank. Teachers then know how 
they will be placed on entering the school, and what their 
prospects of promotion are. Bargaining by ambitious 
teachers and those that like to rely upon “influence” and 
“pull” is prevented.’ As salaries represent nearly three 
fourths of the annual expenditures, with a schedule adopted 
the principal can anticipate budget needs several years in 
advance. 
Although the salaries in total are naturally limited by the 
ability of the district, individual salaries may vary greatly in 
two districts that have the same ability to support schools. 
To illustrate, there are two districts that raise $30,000 each 
for teachers’ salaries. One hires fifteen teachers, the other 
twenty. The first can pay its teachers an average salary of 
$2000; the second can pay an average salary of $1500. The 
differences may be due to the first group teaching larger 
classes than the second; it may be due to the fact that the 
second has a broader curriculum. There are two ways then 
by which the principal can bring up salaries without increas- 
ing the total salary budget: (1) by increasing the number of 
pupil-hours per teacher, or (2) by cutting down the curricu- 
lar offering. Adequate salaries ought to be paid. If the prin- 
cipal cannot obtain a sufficient budget to pay adequate sal- 
aries he should consider whether it is not wise to take either 
one or the other of the two steps. 
Having decided to adopt a reasonable salary schedule, the 
principal’s next step is to determine what the schedule shall 
be. He must be able to justify it to the teachers, to the 
school board, and to the community. It will be an advan- 
tage to get the help of the teachers in working out the 
schedule. The schedule should be based upon such points 
as the following: 
   
-P-A-G-E-100

  THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
. The cost of living. This is calculated by multiplying the cost 
of room and board for twelve months by two. 
. The cost of the teacher’s training. This is equal to the inter- 
est on the investment in training, comprising the cost of 
board, room, tuition, ete., and wages at the rate of unskilled 
labor for the time required. 
. The cost of keeping up to date. This is the cost of at least a 
six weeks’ term of schooling every other year. Board and 
room are not computed here as they. are included in (1), but 
only travel, tuition, books, etc. 
Compensation for experience. As has been stated, we do not 
know how much a year of experience adds to a teacher’s effi- 
ciency. However, as the purpose of service compensation is 
to render the tenure more stable, we may arbitrarily set it at 
the improvement salary. 
Recognition of ability. This cannot be set even in a general 
way. It makes the schedule somewhat flexible, and enables 
the principal to reward superior ability. 
The teaching load — with added compensation for extra 
work, 
To illustrate the use of the principles just stated, the sal- 
ary of a teacher is calculated herewith. We will assume that 
the teacher in question has had five years’ experience, two 
years of training above the high school, is rated superior, 
and carries a teaching load 1.2 times the average:

It will be observed that a schedule worked out as illus- 
trated is in accord with the principle “Equal Pay for Equal 
 
-P-A-G-E-101

Work.” High-school teachers will receive more pay than 
grade teachers only if they have had more training, more 
experience, or demonstrate greater efficiency in some other 
respect. In other words, such a plan recognizes merit. At 
the same time it recognizes the need of a minimum which 
should be equal for all teachers, and places the minimum on 
the level that enables the teacher to maintain her health and 
comfort. 
The teaching load. An attempt should be made to meet 
two requirements in respect to the teaching load: (1) it 
should be reasonably stable — that is, not vary much from 
day to day through the principal’s bringing in unexpected 
tasks; and (2) it should be adjusted to the teacher’s ability. 
These requirements cannot be met unless the load can be 
measured, and unless the measurement takes into account 
not only what the teacher does in the classroom during 
school hours, but all of her school duties from coaching a 
class play to taking charge of the library. Lacking stand- 
ards as we do at present, about the only thing that can be 
done is to get the consensus of opinion, of the teachers them- 
selves concerning the relative difficulty of the various duties. 
To do this the following ‘procedure is suggested: 
1. Make up a list of all the school and community activities in 
which the teachers will be expected to share. 
2. Take a common activity, such as teaching. thirty pupils 
English composition one hour (including the marking of 
papers), as a standard. 
8. Call this standard 1, and have the teachers weight all the 
other activities in comparison with this standard. 
4. Average the weights assigned by the teachers to find what 
may be called the final subjett weights. 
5. Multiply the number of pupils a teacher has in every activity 
for which she is responsible by its subject weight, and by the 
number of périods a week. Call this the subject load. 
6. a all the subject loads of each teacher to find the teaching 
load.
-P-A-G-E-102
  88 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
To illustrate the method, consider the following. The 
weights assigned the activities listed were given by a number 
of competent judges — principals, superintendents, and 
teachers — and may be used to balance the opinion of the 
consolidated school faculty if the principal desires to do so.

Some of the foregoing are independent of the number con- 
cerned. In such cases the subject weight only should be 
really considered. However, in order to get the subject or 
activity load in the same terms as the other activities, one 
may multiply the mean weight by the average group. It is 
also plain that the weights resulting from such a method of
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE TEACHING STAFF 89 
study are not the true weights. Something will be accom- 
plished if the principal can get the teachers to be open 
minded on the subject, and this device should give them the 
point of view of other teachers. It will also necessitate that 
teachers who willingly shoulder the burden of the so-called 
extra-class and curricular activities get some recognition 
for it. 
Participation in administration. The associations among 
consolidated school teachers are so close that participation 
in the management of the school is inevitable. Teachers dis- 
cuss matters of mutual interest among themselves, and give 
and get suggestions from their fellows. In the informal con- 
ferences in the classrooms and the office the principal can get 
the teacher’s point of view on administrative matters. Fi- 
nally, in the teachers’ meetings, he will find it a good idea to 
submit matters of mutual concern to the group, encourage 
their discussion, appoint committees to investigate and re- 
port, and when the appropriate time comes ask them to 
express their judgment in a vote. Usually the decision of 
the teachers when given in this way should be acted upon. 
Sometimes new factors enter into the situation, after the 
teachers have voted, that will warrant the principal in acting 
contrary to their expressed wishes. Under such circum- 
stances he should feel free to do it, explaining to them his 
reasons for change of policy. This is to say, that as the 
responsible head of the school the final decision rests with 
the principal. 
He should always welcome suggestions from the teachers. 
By asking their opinions frequently, by submitting matters 
of policy in meetings, and by treating their ideas in a friendly 
way he will obtain their confidence. As the group will-not 
be large there will be no need of a representative council or 
advisory contmittee. Instead, all the teachers will consti- 
tute the advisory council—a true democracy. At least
-P-A-G-E-104
    90 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
once a year a letter should be addressed by the principal to 
the teachers asking for ideas on methods, curriculum, organi- 
zation, equipment, and all the other appurtenances of the 
school. One result is an acquaintance with the ability and 
initiative of his teachers that no other means will reveal; 
another is an aecumulation of helpful ideas !— excellent 
proof of the statement that many heads are better than one. 
As an example of what teachers can contribute we have the 
results reported by Barr (see bibliography). Only a few of 
the many suggestions are given here: 
. The making of a poster booklet. 
. Social rating of pupils. 
. Patriots’ reading club. 
. Blue-prints for nature study. 
. Health plays. 
A course of study in vocational English. 
. A study of school papers. 
- Individual record cards in oral English. 
. Self-promotion of pupils in spelling. 
10. The use of tests in improving classroom instruction. 
11. The use of coaching teachers. 
12. A study of failures. CHAANHR WOE 
The teacher and the community. If the principal has 
selected the teachers wisely he will need to worry himself but 
little about their adjustment to the community. He will 
insist upon teachers who know and appreciate rural and 
village life. He will also employ teachers who live in the 
community from choice, and who participate in its life. He 
will not presume to dictate to the teachers what share they 
shall take, nor interfere in any way with their personal 
affairs. He will out of his broader understanding of the 
school relationships give them such inspiration, guidance, 
and assistance as will help them to find their best place. 
1 The principal should pass the good ideas along to the other teachers, 
being sure to give full credit for them.
-P-A-G-E-105
  
THE TEACHING STAFF 91 
He should not be known among the teachers as one who 
brings them bad tidings — what Mrs. A has said about 
them, how they are being criticized for the kind of examina- 
tions they give, for keeping children in after school, the kind 
of company they keep, or the kind of clothes they wear. 
Such corrections as are necessary should be brought so tact- 
fully to the teachers that they will make the changes as of 
their own accord. He should shield the teachers from the 
unpleasant, not bring it to them. Occasionally — and these 
times should be far apart — it will be necessary to talk 
frankly with a teacher concerning certain shortcomings. 
This should be done quietly, without feeling, and with evi- 
dence of a sincere interest in the teacher’s welfare. As a 
few illustrations of the many typical problems of teacher- 
community relations which arise, the following may be 
indicated: 
1. Dress. If the teacher offends in dress either by going to ex- 
tremes in short skirts, rolled stockings, and low-necked 
waists, or by dragging petticoats and shabby old-fashioned 
hats and skirts, the principal should put the facts before her 
briefly and plainly. If she is paid sufficiently to enable her to 
dress neatly and well, and fails to carry out a suggestion for 
reasonable reform, she need not be recommended for re- 
election. This assumes that the practice, whatever it is, is not 
approved by the community standards. If it is, the principal 
can hardly set himself up as a dictator of fashion independent 
of the community attitude, and will have to be more lenient in 
his judgment. He may for the sake of the children insist 
upon improvement. 
2. Bobbed hair, painting, etc. In this day of progress the principal 
who objects to bobbed-hair teachers may well be accused of 
ill-seated prejudice. As long as there is no correlation be- 
tween the length of the hair and teaching ability, he should 
refuse to pay attention to the matter at all. If a teacher asks 
him for advice on the subject, he should suggest that she be 
guided by community opinion. If it is ultra-conservative, it 
may be better for her to forego the satisfaction, especially if 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
  she be a new teacher. Painting and powdering is a different 
question. It is a matter of taste, and, as it is commonly as- 
sociated with the low and vulgar, and does not, in the judg- 
ment of the best critics, add to her appearance, the principal 
should advise against the practice. As only vain and silly 
teachers — often those who have not been well taught at 
home — indulge in the practice, the principal may approach 
the subject without hesitation. 
8. Dances. If the community is opposed to dancing, the teach- 
ers should be advised not to dance. It might be well to try to 
cultivate a more liberal attitude in the community mind, but 
pending its development it is wiser to conform. Whatever 
the community attitude, the principal will find that teachers 
who go to dances frequently during the school week are not 
very efficient, and, on this latter ground, may find it necessary 
to displace them. ‘The best teacher keeps herself in good 
physical trim for teaching. 
4. Talking shop. There can be no objection to teachers talking 
shop among themselves, nor to the people of the district. 
However, when it descends to the level of gossip a halt should 
be called. Ask the teachers to refrain from talking about the 
limitations and shortcomings of any pupil, fellow teacher, or 
patron. If the whole teaching body assumes the positive atti- 
tude towards the school, and stresses the good points, it will 
be easier to improve the poor ones. 
5. Sunday School and church. It is a mistake for the principal to 
put pressure on the teachers to get them éo enlist in Sunday 
School and church service. Converts by force have not been 
noted for sincere and capable effort. If they choose church 
work by preference, their choice should be encouraged as 
laudable and worthy. If they do not, there are so many 
other kinds of community work worth doing that they should 
be given a free hand. Sunday-School teaching especially 
‘presents so many aspects of the teacher’s daily work — 
discipline, grading, questioning, and lecturing — that the 
hour cannot be looked upon as recreational indulgence. If it 
is considered necessary, the teacher should be credited on the 
teaching load. 
6. Miscellaneous matters. ‘The boarding house problem is always 
one of the biggest for the teachers. If they get a poor place in 
which to stay they hardly dare leave. The only way to insure
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE TEACHING STAFF 93 
good living quarters is for the district to provide them. If 
this is not possible, perhaps the principal should encourage 
the teachers to organize a club. 
Lodge membership sometimes assumes undue proportions in 
the teacher-community relationships. Generally speaking, it 
is good for every teacher to belong to some fraternal organ- 
ization. If the Grange or the Union is represented in the 
community, the teachers can well afford to join. 
Teachers, too, should assume some leadership in the social 
clubs. In a small and homogeneous community, anything 
approaching the exclusive has no place. A single, inclusive 
association is the thing. As for bridge clubs and the like, 
rural people have been too busy and too sensible to tolerate 
them. One should not encourage the bringing of such things 
into the community. 
Principles governing staff problems. The problems of the 
teaching staff are so varied and numerous as to almost defy 
analysis within our space limitations. Most of them center 
about the selection of teachers. If this is well done, other 
matters are easily taken care of. The principal who gets an 
efficient group of teachers together has earned more than 
half his salary. As a’summary of the most important sug- 
gestions of principal-teacher relations, the following state- 
ments are made: 
1, In selecting teachers for the consolidated school a heavier 
* weighting should be given to personality — that broad term 
which includes the factors that enable a person to get along 
well with others, to make a good impression, and to work per- 
sistently and enthusiastically — than to scholarship and ex- 
perience. 
2. The duty of selecting teachers is one that only the principal 
can perform satisfactorily. 
8. Inquiries to references should be specific, not general. ‘The 
form used should be of such character that the principal can 
express the rating of the applicants in numerical terms. 
4. Many items of information may be collected on the applica- 
tion blank, even though the prinoipal have no clear aim for 
its use.
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL 
5. As xt is too much to expect that all the teachers will be 
equally well trained for their positions, or so well trained as 
they might be, the principal should adopt such supervisory 
methods as will help them to become more efficient. 
6. A uniform and graded salary schedule should be prepared by 
the principal and ratified by the school board. 
7. The load of the teachers should be stable, and approximately 
equal. 
8. Means should be made available through which the teachers 
may codperate in the administration of the school. 
Summary. The teacher is the most potent force for pro- 
gress in the community. If she is efficient, the community 
advances; if she is not, it remains static or tends to retro- 
grade. As her duties are varied, both in school and out, the 
consolidated school requires a more versatile and adaptable 
teacher than a large city. The principal should form a clear 
idea of the type of teacher needed in his district, and seek 
out that type. He should not, therefore, draw his teachers 
only from those who make unsolicited applications. He 
should secure well-trained and experienced teachers, but 
should not depend upon these criteria of fitness alone. As 
a means of interesting and holding good teachers, he should 
use his utmost efforts to get a good salary schedule. In 
order to do this it may be wise to increase the amount of 
teaching done by each teacher, or to reduce the curricular 
offerings. The salaries paid should be computed on the 
basis of cost of living, training, experience, ability, and load. 
The load should be equated by the teachers, using whatever 
other judgment or facts the principal can obtain to balance 
opinions that may be somewhat biased. Last of all, if the 
principal solicits sincerely the codperation of the teachers, 
and counsels them honestly on teacher-community matters, 
he is assured of a solidarity, a loyalty, and a unity among his 
teachers that cannot but redound to the better welfare of 
the schools.

EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
. Read several selected articles on the ideal teacher. Of what practical 
value are such discussions in helping a principal to select teachers? 
Assign weights to the teaching qualities named on the type reference 
blank. If you were taking charge of a new school, to which would 
you assign greater weight in selecting teachers — ability to discipline 
or ability to teach, assuming of course that conditions are unknown to 
you? 
. Discuss the truth of the statement that it requires a better teacher to 
make a success in a consolidated school than in a city school. 
. Suppose that the spring after your taking charge of a school the board 
announces unexpectedly that they will hire the teachers. Several 
vacancies are known to exist or are declared, and the board proceeds 
to distribute the duty of filling the vacancies out among the members. 
What would you do? 
|. How would you bring it about so that the clerk would be required to 
turn over any applications he received to you before presenting them 
to the school board? 
. Discuss the advisability of asking a teacher who is applying for a posi- 
tion what church she belongs to, whether she plays cards or not, and 
whether she is good at discipline or not. 
. What answer should a principal make to a teacher who asks him for 
an open letter of reference? What should he say to a teacher who of- 
fers open letters of reference? 
. Point out the advantages of the reference form that calls for specific 
answers, over the form that asks for information only concerning the 
candidate’s fitness. 
. Suppose you interview a candidate, and even visit her room and 
watch her teach. How would you weight your judgment of her com- 
pared with the judgment of two competent judges under whom she 
has worked for a year or two? 
Make up a list of agencies and means which the consolidated school 
principal could use in improving his teachers, after they enter service. 
Give as many reasons as you can why it is inadvisable for a district to 
employ teachers who are relatives of the board members or the prin- 
cipal. 
Discuss the practicability of the salary principles which were given to 
the job of estimating the salary the principal ought to have. 
Such investigations as have been made show that size of class is not 
an important factor in its effect upon the efficiency of instruction. 
How could the principal use this conclusion in getting better salaries 
for his teachers? 
Point out some reasons why all the activities of the school should be 
considered in measuring the teaching load, _

THE SCHOOL PLANT AND ITS EQUIPMENT
-P-A-G-E-112

-P-A-G-E-113
  CHAPTER VI 
THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 
The point of view. Many people have looked upon the 
school plant as an unimportant factor in the educational pro- 
gram. Those who take this point of view regard the build- 
ing as little more than “‘a device to protect the children from 
the weather while they are being educated.” To such per- 
sons almost any kind of a building will do. They justify the 
ramshackly, inadequate, barnlike structures which they call 
school buildings by the happy reflection that it is the pupils 
and the teachers that make the school, without reflecting 
that pupils and teachers are subject to their physical sur- 
rounding. With seldom an exception, poor school buildings 
mean inferior educational and social ideals, and too often 
they are an index to inferior educational performance as well. 
The second point of view has resulted in the building 
dominating the educational program. The school plant has 
been well constructed, it has been expensive enough, but the 
architects in charge have subordinated educational needs to 
arbitrary and traditional building standards. When once 
their ideals have been embodied in wood and concrete, they 
have not lent themselves readily to change. The building 
was a fixed structure. If it did not fit the school plan, the 
only thing the principal could do was to shape his educa- 
tional program to fit the building. It is not too much to say 
that architects and builders have often determined what the 
educational plan should be. This is wrong. Many fine 
architectural achievements are utterly unfitted to service in 
carrying out a modern school program. 
There is another point of view, which may be said to pre- 
dominate in the minds of men and women who are trained in 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  100 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
scientific education. This is to the effect that the educa- 
tional program should first be formed, and then the building 
be moulded to the educational plan. Educational planning 
thus takes precedence over architectural planning. Fur- 
thermore, the belief is that the school plant is a powerful 
factor in making or marring the success of the educational 
program. Basic principles of education — health, apprecia- 
tion of beauty, good citizenship, moral character — all may 
be promoted by the mere circumstances of providing the 
proper kind of school plant. On the other hand, the realiza- 
tion of educational objectives may be seriously retarded, if 
not rendered impossible, by the lack of adequate building 
facilities. It is our purpose, therefore, to put before the 
principal, in this and the succeeding chapter, the elements 
of building planning and operation in line with the third 
point of view. 
Special rural building problems. The statement is some- 
times made that there is very little difference in the building 
needs of rural and city communities. If this is interpreted 
to mean that the typical city building is suited to rural 
needs, then it is a mistaken idea. When both communities 
have the kinds of buildings adapted to their needs, there will 
be many things in common. Yet, at the same time, there 
are some peculiar rural conditions which must be taken 
account of, and of which the principal and the architect 
should be aware. They are as follows:     
   
      
     
                         1. Owing to administrative necessity and to sparseness of popu-| 
lation, the elementary grades and the high school will usually 
be housed in the same building. As has been indicated, this 
is an advantage in many ways. 
2. The building should be planned and equipped to serve as a| 
community center. 
8. The education of adults should be provided for. 
4. Special laboratory provisions should be made for the applie 
sciences, such as agriculture and home economics.
-P-A-G-E-115
  THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 101 
5. The library must serve adults as well as children. An en- 
trance should be provided that will permit community use 
without disturbing the school. 
6. An all-weather landing place must be provided, due to the 
transportation feature of the consolidated school. 
7. The educational needs of the community will probably al- 
ways be served by one school plant, hence that plant must be 
capable of expansion and extension commensurate with the 
growth of the population. 
8. This type of building is not of necessity driven to height. As 
the advantages of the one-story building have been clearly 
demonstrated, the consolidated school with its plentiful sup- 
ply of land is the logical place for its development. 
9. In most cases the consolidated school will have to furnish its 
own unit-plants for heating, lighting, water, fire-fighting, and 
sewage-disposal. 
10. Since extensive auditorium and gymnasium facilities are both 
needed, they will often have to be combined in one room, in 
the interest of economy. 
11. The auditorium and the gymnasium must also be accessible, 
without disturbance to the school. 
12. Since most of the children will remain at the school during 
the noon hour, special rooms for preparing and serving lunches 
are necessary. 
18. Schools drawing from an unusually large territory, particu- 
larly from districts not in the consolidation, will need to sup- 
ply dormitories for students. 
14. The lack of proper living quarters for the principal and the 
teachers will have to be compensated for by publicly owned 
cottages and clubs. 
Basic requirements. Just as the curriculum goes back to 
the aims of education, so should the building. In planning 
a building, the principal commences with the aims and ob- 
Jectives, passes next to the activities and processes by which 
the aims are to be realized, and then takes up the facilities 
which are demanded in order to carry on the activities. As 
an illustration, consider the outline of ultimate objectives, 
immediate objectives, activities, and facilities which follows:

Accessory facilities also are needed. Comprised in this list 
are the administrative offices, storerooms, space for heating 
and ventilating equipment, corridors, and toilets. 
To summarize the minimum requirements, we have: 
1. School grounds, with play space, gardens, and landscape. 
2. Rooms for instruction and training — Classrooms, assembly, 
gymnasium, library, laboratories, shops, and studios. , 
3. Rooms for administration and other special purposes — 
Offices, storage, equipment, club meetings, and conference. 
4, Equipment — Appropriate for the purpose served. 
The school grounds. There are three leading problems 
connected with the school grounds. They are: (1) location, 
(2) healthfulness, and (3) size. The first is important chiefly 
when selecting a new site. Convenience is one of the de- 
termining factors. It should be as near the population- 
center as possible, provided this is most accessible. If the 
most convenient and accessible place happens also to be near 
the geographical center, the community is likely to be better 
pleased. However, an arbitrary location in respect to the 
center of the district is not often wise. 
Disagreements over the location of rural-school build- 
ings are very frequent. They have been known time after 
time to defeat consolidations, and sometimes prevent the 
construction of a new building even after bonds have been 
voted. If a situation of this kind develops, the principal 
should try to find a way out. In one community of the 
writers’ knowledge, when the people could not agree on the 
location of the new school, some one suggested that the 
matter be left to the high-school pupils. The idea happened 
to meet with approval and the question was settled without 
any delay or hard feelings. While this.was not a scientific 
nor very sensible way to do, it was far better than the endless 
wrangling, disputes, and lawsuits that have several times 
resulted over the location of a school building.
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
If a situation does arise where it is impossible or inex- 
pedient for the people to choose the site, the best thing to do 
is to advise that some one from outside be called in to make 
the decision. Usually the proposition strikes the people as 
fair. A side that is unwilling to trust its case to an im- 
partial and competent outsider can hardly escape the charge 
of narrowness, if not a worse charge. If two or more sites 
equally good are available, and the problem is that of favor- 
ing one person with land to sell rather than another, it is also 
wise to bring in an outside referee. At all events, everything 
should be done to prevent factional disturbances, lawsuits, 
and secession of districts — all too common results of dis- 
putes over sites. The authors have seen a building project 
tied up seven years because of the inability of the people to 
select a location. All this time the children were deprived 
of decent educational advantages, while the factions ex- 
pended the public substance in litigation. 
Health and safety. The building should be properly lo- 
cated with respect to healthfulness. This means that the 
grounds should be capable of being well-drained, and not in 
close proximity to swamps, stockyards, feeding-pens, and 
disagreeable and injurious industries. The building should 
not be near dusty roads, railways, smelters, factories, nor 
any place where dust and fumes can reach it. From the 
point of view of safety, nearness to power stations, canals, 
sawmills, mills, shops, and dangerous highways is to be 
avoided. If the playground abuts on a much-traveled road, 
it should be shut in by a strong fence. Poolrooms, candy- 
stores, confectioneries, and lunch-stands should be kept 
away from the school. They may be dangerous to both the 
health and the morals of the children. Disease-carriers, 
such as rats, flies, and mosquitoes, are likely to be around 
such places as we have mentioned, and it is well in every 
respect if there is a good deal of clear space about the school,
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 105 
The grounds should be freely open to the sunlight. Side- 
hills that are in the shade a large part of the day are not good 
locations. Neither are bare and rocky hilltops, exposed to 
winds and storms, ordinarily suitable. If at all possible, the 
school board should be restrained from taking an otherwise 
poor location just because it is cheap, or sightly, or near the 
main road where it will be seen by travelers. This is a type 
of public exploitation that should be frowned upon. 
Size of grounds. The old standard of two hundred square 
feet per pupil is insufficient to meet the needs of a twentieth- 
century school. This would mean a site of about two acres 
for a school of three hundred and fifty pupils. The standard 
never did have any justification in research. It simply 
marked the prevailing practice — bad as well as good — in 
England in the last part of the nineteenth century. The 
English conception of education was far different from ours, 
and it is still farther removed from our present conception. 
The pupil basis of estimating the size of the grounds is itself 
inadequate. Practically speaking, a school of one hundred 
pupils requires as much ground space as a school of three 
hundred pupils. This leads to the conclusion that there is 
a minimum amount of ground space which all schools should 
meet. As schools increase in size, the minimum must be 
also increased. What the size of the grounds ought to be 
can be determined only by an analysis of the uses to which 
the grounds are put. To illustrate, let us consider the 
minimum space demands for a school of nine grades with 
around three hundred pupils: 
1. Building space, including school, garage, cottages 
for principal and for teachers, etc.............0005 1 
. Lawn, shrubs, trees for landscape purposes

The minimum space is thus seen to be twelve acres. 
Eliminating the lawns, free play space, poultry pens, and 
lunch pavilion we still have need for seven acres, or about the 
equivalent of two city blocks. It may be safely said that no 
site should be smaller than ten acres, and that fifteen acres

is the desirable minimum when one makes a slight allowance 
for expansion. Twenty acres approaches the ideal, and is 
sufficient for the combined grade and high school of the 
enrollment ordinarily found ‘in the consolidated school. 
Since it is nearly impossible to enlarge the school site by
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 107 
further purchases, except at exorbitant figures, it is better to 
buy the site of twenty acres in the beginning. Money put 
into a good site is always a wise investment, and it can be 
sold at a profit in almost every case. 
The administration of the grounds. The grounds ought 
to be open to the people of the community at all times when 
they are not in use by the school. The janitor may be ap- 
pointed custodian, and should see that the rules governing 
the care of the property are observed. The school grounds 
may serve most of the purposes of a city park. Picnics, 
games, and parties may be featured as the community de- 
sires. Since liability for damage cannot be fixed, the school 
grounds should not be thrown open to the use of travelers 
and people outside of the district, except when special ar- 
rangements are made. 
If the grounds are small or poorly equipped, the principal 
will have the problem of so planning the play periods as to 
accommodate all the pupils dismissed. In general, those 
pupils should be dismissed together who play best together. 
In a one- to twelve-grade school, three or even four separate 
play periods may be necessary. Assuming that the school 
day begins at 8.30, the recess periods may be planned as 
follows: 
Primary (1-3) | 9.30- 9.45 — 10.45-11.00 
Intermediate (4-6) 9.45-10.00 — 11.00-11.10 
Junior and senior high school 10.00-10.15 
The afternoon hours may be similar. As the use of the 
grounds should be definitely coupled up with the use of the 
gymnasium and with the physical education program in 
geaeral, the plan suggested above will probably be unneces- 
sary. Should there be both play apparatus and play space 
available, the school may be divided upon a different basis, 
one group using the swings, teeters, and inclines while the 
other engages in games. ‘The use of the various types of 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  
108 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
equipment and of space may be rotated so that all are 
satisfied. 
The building; its placement. Attention should be given 
to the placement of the building. It should not be too close 
to the road, as under such circumstances it does not appear 
so well, and is not so free from the dust and noise of travel. 
At the same time it should not be so located that it breaks 
up the playground into unusable units. The best plan is to 
set it back all the way from thirty to fifty feet from the line 
of the grounds, and use the space in front for lawn and 
shrubs. A corner location is very good, as it makes the 
building more accessible and provides more parking space. 
The orientation should be such that the light will come from 
the east, southeast, west, and southwest — this being the 
order of preference. Many favor north light for the labora- 
tories. Some consideration has to be given to climatic con- 
ditions, the number of months school is kept open, and 
whether school runs far into the summer or not. If west 
and southwest exposure is necessary for some of the rooms, 
the pupils who are dismissed earliest should be housed in 
them, so that they will be out before the straight rays of the 
sun begin to pour in. All toilet-rooms should be so located 
that they can have plenty of direct sunlight. 
Form of building. At least four factors determine the 
form and shape of the building. First, it should be of such 
form that additions may readily be made. These should be 
indicated in the original plan, and the building be so placed 
on the site that enlargements are possible, and lighting and 
heating arrangements possible. Second, the element of 
safety should be considered. . Third, the form should be such 
as to bring convenience to the very maximum. Fourth, 
outside light should be provided for each room. From these 
considerations — flexibility, safety, lighting and convenience 
— we may conclude that the form should be an I, E, H, L,
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 109 
U, or block enclosing an inner court. Moreover, it should 
not be more than two stories high. A basement is not ad- 
vised even for the location of the heating plant. Wherever 
placed, the furnace room should be fireproofed. 
Materials of construction. The resources of a consoli- 
dated school district are seldom sufficient to finance a class A 
building. Even if the people are able and willing to finance 
the construction of a class A building, it is seldom good pol- 
icy to do it. It is expensive, it is difficult to remodel, and 
it is unnecessary. A two-story building, with fireproofed 
furnace room, corridors, and stairways, and with a sufficient 
number of entrances and exits to make administration con- 
venient, is safe. With a building such as has been described, 
equipped with fire hose and extinguishers, and where the 
pupils are given fire drills regularly and carefully, the danger 
of fire is negligible. 
The materials used will depend upon the amount of money 
available, the prices at which they can be obtained, and 
climatic conditions. In some sections, brick buildings are 
advocated. This would be true of certain Middle-West 
States where other materials must be shipped great dis- 
tances, and where the climate is cold in winter and warm in 
summer. In the Northwest, wooden buildings are often to 
be recommended. While it is not being advocated that the 
type of materials produced locally should determine con- 
struction, yet vexatious delays often may be escaped by this 
policy, and more economical construction may also be 
possible. 
Another word may be said about the merits of permanent 
buildings. With the rapid changes which are taking place 
in the educational program, a building planned for to-day is 
likely to be out of date in a generation. A class C building 
which is well-constructed and well-cared-for is good for fifty 
years. Taking everything into consideration it is wiser to 
_fix on this type than the class A type. The class C type is ,  
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
more flexible, the first cost is much less, and the scrap value 
fully equal to the scrap value of the class A building. Also, 
if abandonment is necessitated, the class C building is likely 
to sell at a higher price because it can be more easily torn 
down or converted to other uses. 
Size of the building. One cannot speak of building size 
independent of the activities and number of pupils it is to 
accommodate. Small buildings are uneconomical to oper- 
ate. Overhead costs are higher, the first cost is probably 
more per given unit, and classes of uniform size are im- 
possible. 
A twenty-eight classroom building is the most economical, 
all things considered. However, it is not always possible to 
gather together the thousand to twelve hundred pupils 
which a twenty-eight classroom building will house. For 
our purpose we shall assume the aims and activities laid 
down in the beginning of the chapter, and an enrollment of 
from 400 to 600 pupils — say thirty per cent in the high 
school, and seventy per cent in the grades. The facilities 
needed then would be approximately as follows: 
1 auditorium, accommodating 1000 persons (for community use), 
1 gymnasium, sixty by eighty, with gallery for 750. 
2 science laboratories, twenty-four by thirty-two, with storage- 
room. 
1 domestic-science laboratory, twenty-four by forty, with storage. 
1 sewing room, twenty-four by thirty-two, with dressing-room, 
display case, and storage. 
1 lunch-room and kitchen. 
1 model apartment. 
1 nurse-room. 
1 library, with workroom and storage space for use of librarian. 
1 office, with toilet, closet, and storage. 
1 kindergarten. 
1 general shop. 
1 studio. 
1 oral-expression-room, with stage. 
16 classrooms.
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 111 
Disposition of space. Space requirements for the various 
educational functions have been well standardized. In 
planning a building, the principal and the architect should 
have these standards at hand in order that they may ap- 
proximate them. Strayer and Englehardt’s publications — 
one for elementary schools, and one for high schools — will 
prove a good investment. Standards for space distribution 
are also authoritatively stated in the reports of the Com- 
mittee on School Buildings of the National Education Asso- 
ciation. This committee collected data on hundreds of 
buildings, and, on the basis of prevailing practices, makes 
the following recommendation for dividing the floor space: 
Instruction, not less than........ asisioleis sais OO Pen.ceny 
Administration, not more than....... preeisy 10) 
Walls and partitions, not more than....... 10 
Stairs and corridors, not more than.. 20 
Flues, not more than...........0. cea 
  Observe that these standards have been developed with 
reference to conventional ideas of school architecture and of 
school programs. Our concept of a modern socialized school 
would result in minor modifications of the standards, all in 
the direction however of what the committee would endorse. 
Thus the proportion of space given to instruction would be 
more than fifty per cent, the proportion to stairs and corri- 
dors less than twenty per cent, and the proportion given to 
administration less than sixteen per cent. In the consoli- 
dated school building the distribution of floor space then 
would be approximately as follows:

The hundred and more school surveys made in recent 
years also are a valuable source of standards. From an 
analysis of fifty of these we find standards of minimum, 
maximum, and median practice in respect to many matters 
of school construction to be as follows:

Planning aroom. The classroom is the important part of 
the school building. It is the place where most of the teach- 
ing and learning process is carried on. It is where the chil- 
dren live for from five to seven hours a day for from eight to 
ten months a year. It ought to be planned with the pupils’ 
health, comfort, and safety in mind. It ought also to be 
adapted to the teaching and learning activities, in order that 
these may be carried on at the maximum of efficiency. In 
planning a room one must consider the welfare of the chil- 
dren, and second the activities which go on in theroom. In 
this discussion, we shall confine ourselves mainly to the 
latter point. 
_ Assume, for illustrative purposes, a room used for the
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 113 
teaching of English to the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. 
It must be large enough to accommodate at least forty 
pupils. The first step is to analyze the activities. Calling 
upon the teachers to help in this undertaking, we find ap- 
proximately the following results: 
#6 
3. 
4 Pupil study. This consists of reading, writing, the use of 
reference books, demonstration, laboratory work, and dis- 
cussion — all supervised. 
. Recitation. Varies with method. Implies the socialized 
method, project work, debate, dramatization, reading, 
writing, declamation, exhibits, conference. 
Teacher work. Reading papers, preparing assignments, con- 
sulting references, reading. 
Storage. For maps, charts and diagrams, books, supplies, 
notebooks, and written themes. 
On the basis of the activities indicated, certain conclusions 
respecting room-planning may be reached, namely: 
1. Aisle-widths must be sufficient to permit pupils to move 
freely about the room without interfering with others. This 
means that the accepted standards are too small. 
. Space for reference works and for tables on which they may 
be used must be supplied. If pupils are seated at tables in- 
stead of at desks, shelves only for the books may be necessary. 
. With supervised study, tables are preferable to desks. They 
also fit in better with the so-called laboratory work in Eng- 
lish, and with project work. 
. Provisions for board work and for bulletin board space must 
be supplied. 
. Storage for a considerable number of books, charts, maps, and 
supplies is necessary. 
. Built-in filing cabinets for themes and notebooks are also 
necessary. They should be accessible to the pupils and con- 
venient to the teacher’s desk. Enough for three classes is 
desirable. 
. A small alcove for conferences, reading, committee meetings, 
etc., will be found worth while. 
. A stage is recommended for rooms given over to oral English 
exclusively. The old-fashioned platform is inadequate and 
, unsatisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-128
114 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
Using tables three and one half by seven feet in size, each 
accommodating five pupils, we can count upon approximate 
standards as follows: 
. Room dimensions, twenty-two by thirty-two, by eleven. 
. Two closets four by six; an alcove four by nine. 
. Library shelf and table space, six by nine. 
. Teacher desk and file space, six by twelve. 
. Blackboard, twenty-one by three. 
. Aisles, two and one half feet wide. 
. Bulletin board space, three and one half by three. SUD Ore G9 2 
Special problems. Practically every question that comes 
up in connection with a building is a special problem. How- 
ever, they differ in importance as well as in kind. At this 
time only those pertaining to the special facilities are men- 
tioned. First of all it is important that the auditorium, 
gymnasium, and library be easily accessible to the public. 
It should be unnecessary to pass through the building in 
order to reach them, and means should be provided by 
which they may be cut off from the remainder of the build- 
ing. The custom is growing of detaching the auditorium 
and the gymnasium from the building entirely, or connecting 
them only with open corridors. The library is best situated 
near the center of the building. Doors leading to the school 
rooms may be locked if the library is open evenings and 
week-ends. 
The toilets also present a number of special problems. 
The school toilets ought to be accessible from the play- 
ground. They must be provided with an abundance of out- 
side light. Special toilets are almost a necessity if the 
building is used for evening school. They should also be 
provided for such community rooms as the auditorium, the 
library, and the gymnasium. It is undesirable to have the 
children use the same toilet rooms that are used by the 
general public. This has been found especially important in
-P-A-G-E-129
  
THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 115 
communities with a large foreign population. The best rule 
is to keep the toilets used by the children closed to adults, 
and vice versa. 
Administrative problems. The other special problems are 
administrative. One of the most perplexing arises when one 
has to put up with inadequate grounds and buildings. The 
solution in respect to grounds, as was stated on page 107, is to 
organize the children into platoons and assign each platoon a 
separate time to use the grounds. In a three-hundred-pupil 
school, with sufficient playground for only one hundred pu- 
pils, three platoons would be necessary. When the plan is 
first instituted the pupils inside may be disturbed by the 
shouts of the children on the playground, but this distraction 
soon disappears. 
The platoon plan is also a solution of the crowded-building 
problem. By this plan the building may be made to care for 
from twenty to fifty per cent more pupils. The facilities are 
in use constantly. It is in connection with the platoon plan 
that the auditorium, gymnasium, library, and other special 
rooms are most fully realized upon. The principal will find 
the plan fully described in Chapters VIII and IX of Cub- 
berley’s The Principal and His School, to which the reader 
is referred. Assuming, for our purpose, an eight-room 
school housing, under the conventional system, forty pupils 
per room, and with gymnasium, auditorium, library, shop, 
and laboratory, as outlined in a preceding paragraph, we 
shall state the steps to increase the capacity of the building 
from 320 pupils to 400. 
1. The school is divided into two platoons of 200 pupils each. 
2. Five regular classrooms are set aside, each housing forty 
pupils. 
8. Six special rooms are designated for teaching uses. They are 
the gymnasium, the auditorium, the library, the laboratory, 
the shop for twenty boys, and the domestic science labora- 
tory for twenty girls. Each of the other special rooms cares 
for forty pupils each period.
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
4, While the first platoon is reciting in the regular classrooms, 
the second platoon is at work in the special rooms. After 
about one hour and a half the platoons change, the first going 
to the special facilities, and the second to the classrooms. 
The program is repeated in the same way in the afternoon. 
It is to be noted that three classrooms are not in use. In 
working out our plan more fully, instead of using our gym- 
nasium and auditorium continuously, we might equip these 
three classrooms as special history, music, and art rooms. 
We would then substitute them for some of the periods 
otherwise filled by the auditorium exercises. If economy is 
also necessary, the auditorium and gymnasium groups might 
be increased to eighty pupils, thus decreasing the number of 
teachers needed. A saving of around twenty-five per cent is 
possible under the platoon system. 
Portables may also serve when an emergency arises. 
They can be bought ready built in one- and two-room units, 
and can be put up in a few days. The whole cost is usually 
less than one pays for ordinary classroom construction. 
They are better than old buildings usually are, and they are 
preferable to overcrowded classes. In districts that are 
growing rapidly, or that are bonded to the limit, the port- 
able offers a practicable way out. Generally speaking, the 
platoon system is more satisfactory and results in a better 
school. Portables occupy a good deal of valuable ground 
space, are more or less unsightly, are somewhat unsanitary, 
and may complicate discipline. In very warm and in very 
cold climates they are at times not very comfortable. At 
the best, they must be regarded as only a temporary ex- 
pedient. 
Caring for buildings. The life of buildings of the same 
type and same quality of construction varies as much as 
twenty years. The reason for this variation is found mainly 
in the care taken of them. Wear and tear from weathering
-P-A-G-E-131
  
THE BUILDING AND THE GROUNDS 117 
is more severe in some climates than in others. Abuse by 
the pupils is tolerated in some communities. Neglect is 
probably the greatest single cause of depreciation. It is as 
inexcusable as abuse by the pupils. Therefore, while taking 
every precaution to teach the pupils the moral and economic 
lesson of preserving public property, the principal will also 
see that the property is well maintained. 
At least once a year a thorough examination of the build- 
ing should be made. The best time to do this is just before 
the beginning of the vacation period. A complete list of the 
many details of the school plant should first be made. Next 
mark off three columns, one headed “Repairs,” one “‘Re- 
placements,” and the third “Remarks.” Accompanied by 
the janitor or by the school carpenter, the principal should 
make a tour of the premises, examining each item in order. 
Those in need of repairs should be checked in the column 
headed “Repairs”; those in need of replacement in its pro- 
per column. Under remarks comments may be made con- 
cerning the nature and cost of repairs, date work is to be 
completed, or any similar notes that will help the workmen. 
Attention to maintenance in this systematic manner will 
greatly prolong the usefulness of the building. When school 
opens in the fall, the principal should take his original list 
and again examine the plant to see if the stipulated work has 
been attended to. 
Summary. The building is an important factor in educa- 
tion. It should not control the educational situation, but 
should be fitted to the educational objectives and the educa- 
tional program. This comprises not only the school pro- 
gram, but the community activities as well. In order to 
shape the building construction to the needs of the whole 
community, the principal should analyze the program into 
its details. In planning the grounds, attention should be 
given to the functions to be served. By this means the area,

location, and lay-out may be arrived at. Building details 
are very numerous, and the principal will find it wise to con- 
sult the standards resulting from experience and investiga- 
tion before launching new enterprises. Convenience, flexi- 
bility, codrdination, safety, and adaptability are desirable 
objectives in building planning.

11. EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
. Is it true that a formal school life is usually found in the conventional 
classroom building? Discuss. 
. Why should the architect be fully acquainted with the proposed edu- 
cational program before planning a building? 
. In a school district, where it seemed that a fight over the location of a 
proposed new high-school building was more than likely, some one 
suggested that the selection of the site be left to the high-school 
students. This suggestion was concurred in by the patrons and school 
authorities. Discuss the wisdom of the method. 
. Point out the fallacy in fixing the size of sites by obtaining a consensus 
of opinion or of practice. 
. In an enterprising community, many of the community leaders fa- 
vored the location of the school building near to a much-traveled and 
a noisy and dusty highway, because it made a good impression upon 
passers-by. What argument could be used against the proposal? 
. A good many building authorities argue that all classrooms should be 
reached by direct sunlight part of the day. Others say this is un- 
necessary, as the air admitted to the rooms, whatever their location, 
has itself been exposed to sunlight. What are the merits of the re- 
spective points of view? 
. Draw outline sketches to illustrate several different building forms. 
What are the advantages of each from the point of view of lighting, 
air, convenience, and ease with which extensions may be made? 
. Point out the advantages and disadvantages in the permanent or 
class-A type of building. 
. Why would one tend to recommend materials produced locally? 
When would such a recommendation be unwise? 
Estimate the size of a classroom to house forty pupils, assuming 
that tables three and one half by seven feet are used as desks, that 
aisles are Uaree and one half feet wide, and that the first row of tables is 
placed with the ends against the outer wall. 
Sketch a layout of a building large enough for from 300 to 400 pupils, 
from the kindergarten through the high school. Observe the sugges 
tions as to location of library, auditorium, and gymnasium,

HOUSING THE STAFF AND THE PUPILS 
School dormitories not new. The acclaim which has greeted 
the establishment of school dormitories, in recent years, 
would cause many to believe that they represent a new dis- 
covery, yet they are really very old. The ancient Greeks 
collected the boys together in barracks during their training 
period, and the early church schools were boarding-schools. 
Throughout the middle ages, and well up into the nineteenth 
century, the schools furnished living accommodations for 
teachers and pupils. Many of our early secondary schools 
were of the traditional type, while our academies almost al- 
ways maintained dormitories in which the pupils and teach- 
ers lived together. We still have hundreds of private schools 
of which the same might be said to-day. It is only with the 
rapid growth of public schools during the past half-century 
that we have forgotten to provide homes for teachers and for 
pupils to whom the school is not easily accessible. 
In many foreign countries the custom was never allowed 
to die out. Their development was less rapid and their 
break with tradition less abrupt. We find therefore that 
though public schools have supplanted private schools in 
many countries, the earlier practices still survive. In Den- 
mark, Switzerland, Germany, England, and in France it is 
the rule to furnish residences for the teachers, and almost 
equally the rule to take care of the pupils who live at a dis- 
tance from the school by means of public dormitories. 
The need of school homes. A number of circumstances 
are responsible for forcing the problem to the attention of 
the principal of the consolidated school. Often the new
-P-A-G-E-136
  
122 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
school building is put up out in the open country. There are 
not enough homes at convenient distance from the school to 
care for the increased number of teachers which the new 
school demands. No public boarding-places are near. If 
good homes could be found among the homes of the district, 
a practicable means of conveying the teachers back and 
forth would not be at hand. The school busses would not be 
satisfactory, as the teachers need to be in school earlier than 
the pupils and they need to stay later. Time on the road 
would generally mean so much lost time to them. 
An aggravated aspect of the problem is seen when one 
considers the principal himself. If he has a family, he must 
find a home for it. In open-country areas there is seldom a 
habitable house available, for rent or lease. He then is 
forced to find a residence in some village or city at a distance 
from school, and is either subjected to the necessity of trav- 
eling the way twice daily, or must leave his family and find a 
boarding-place in the district. To do this last is often 
harder for the principal than for a teacher. If he accepts 
this course as necessary, he loses the pleasure and satisfac- 
tion of family life. If he goes home for week-ends, the dis- 
trict suffers from lack of his leadership and his interest in 
community work. If he travels to and from his home daily, 
he also sacrifices much time that could be turned to a use- 
ful purpose, 
The village problem. A no-less complicated problem is 
presented when the school is located in a village. Although 
places may be open, they are seldom of the kind teachers 
should have if they are to live comfortably and happily, and 
if their efficiency is to be maintained. Of all dreary places 
to live in the village hotel takes the lead. If the teachers live 
in a private home, their comings and goings are under watch- 
ful surveillance, and they seldom enjoy any privacy. The 
teacher may have no separate room in which to study, and
-P-A-G-E-137
  
HOUSING THE STAFF AND THE PUPILS 128 
she is often interrupted by callers and by the children of the 
family. If by some lucky circumstance she is successful in 
finding a desirable boarding-place, the prices she pays are 
often exorbitant. When high rates are combined with in- 
ferior quarters and conditions, then the acme of unpleasant- 
ness has been reached. 
There is another angle to the question that deserves con- 
sideration. Most all of the discussions of the problem have 
been from the point of view of the teacher. There is also the 
point of view of the home into which the teacher is received. 
Influenced by the feeling of duty toward education, people 
may accept teachers as guests against their inclinations. 
They reshape their daily schedule of meals. The hours of 
rising and retiring may be changed. The best room and the 
most comfortable place by the fire is surrendered to the 
teacher. She entertains her company in the living-room, 
while the family seek the kitchen. Little likes and dislikes 
cannot be catered to because the teacher must be thought of 
first. A formality of discourse, of manners, and of general 
behavior that is itself quite trying arises. With all this, if 
the teacher happens to be over-particular, a little exacting, 
and a little bit inclined to find fault, the last hope of peaceful 
family life has vanished. Many good people complain that 
it is too much of a strain to live all the time under the eye 
of a school teacher. 
The principal’s housing problem is simplified somewhat. 
Houses may be rented within the village, though they are 
seldom convenient and seldom of good quality. With the 
building shortage resulting from the cessation of construc- 
tion during the World War, usually only old-fashioned and 
poorly built houses are now to be found. Rents have gone 
up, somewhat tardily, is is true, compared with city rates, 
but ordinarily they are far in excess of the values furnished. 
In changing from place to place the principal only infre-

quently feels justified in purchasing his own home. He 
arrives on the scene of his new position, with only a few days 
to give to house-hunting. He has to take what he can get 
and he has to pay whatever rental is asked. If he finds him- 
self badly located, he will probably submit to inconvenience, 
discomfort, and overcharge rather than undergo the tragedy 
of moving. 
When the consolidation comprises village and open- 
country areas, there are likely to be pupils as well in need of 
boarding-places. Some of them will come from small rural 
districts not in the consolidation. Others will come from 
village districts lacking the advantages of the new consoli- 
dated school. There will be a few pupils from the bounds of 
the district who prefer to live in the village rather than go 
back and forth to their homes. Others will choose to live in 
the village because by so doing they get opportunities to 
study music, to engage in athletics, or to enjoy a social life 
which are not theirs otherwise. Some parents do not like 
their children to run the risks of bad weather, delays, and 
accidents which transportation may in their minds suggest. 
Whatever the reasons, in a school of three hundred pupils it 
is not surprising to find twenty-five living away from home. 
To a certain extent the school authorities are responsible for 
their care and for their protection. 
Nothing is surer than that adequate housing conditions 
for principal, janitor, teachers, and for many pupils cannot 
be obtained on the renting and boarding basis. It is gener- 
ally true even in large cities. Private homes cannot be de- 
pended upon to furnish the teachers with satisfactory living 
conditions. The result there has been to stimulate the or- 
ganization of clubs, sometimes codrdinated with welfare and 
business organizations. Now if living groups have been 
found indispensable and can be successfully managed in 
cities, their need is many-fold stronger in rural districts and
-P-A-G-E-139
HOUSING THE STAFF AND THE PUPILS 125 
the means of satisfying the need is within the realm of easy 
realization. The answer is found in publicly owned homes 
for the teaching staff, the other school employees, and for 
pupils forced to reside away from home. 
The advantages. Whether the advantages of the publicly 
owned school homes justify their establishment and continu- 
ance can only be answered relatively. Are they better than 
the private homes, if private homes can be found in sufficient 
number willing to accommodate the demands? On this 
question as it pertains to the teacher, we have considerable 
clear evidence. This may be summarized, as follows: 
1. Better teachers can be obtained. 
2. The teachers will stay longer in the places where they have 
satisfactory home conditions. 
8. They are able to do better work because they have better op- 
portunities to study, their food is better, the arrangements 
for rest and sleep are better, they have more time to prepare 
for teaching, they have better chances for recreation, and 
their health is better protected. 
4. A considerable reduction in the cost of living is effected. 
This is equivalent to higher salaries. 
5. Teachers are saved from making enemies through a change of 
boarding places. 
6. They are spared from a great deal of gossip and from many 
comments upon their personal affairs. 
7. They have a larger freedom and greater independence of 
action. 
8. Difficult discipline cases, arising in the boarding-places, are 
avoided. 
9. Teachers are not so likely to become entangled in neighbor- 
hood disagreements. 
10. The social and professional values are greatly increased. 
The disadvantages. The disadvantages are most often 
imaginary, rather than real, and are cited by those who 
want to realize a profit out of taking teachers to board. 
Lack of funds is oftenest mentioned. However, as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  126 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
teachers pay a rental, the expenditure is an investment. 
While the rental should in justice be no more than enough 
to cover replacement, interest charges, and operation, the 
advantages of longer tenure, better teachers, and higher effi- 
ciency makes the proposition one that returns high divi- 
dends. Superintendents report that the efficiency of teach- 
ers is twenty-five per cent higher in districts that supply 
them homes. 
A second criticism of the teacher-club idea arises out of 
a belief that teachers cannot live together harmoniously. 
Although an occasional example of friction would not be un- 
expected, the investigations which have been made fail to 
reveal any. To the contrary, the many successful clubs in 
operation show that teachers can get along most agreeably 
with each other. Writing on this point concerning the 
teachers’ dormitory at Flint, Michigan, where one hundred 
and thirty-six teachers live together, Miss Lohrstorfer says: 
Young teachers newly released from college live by the side of 
and in perfect accord with others who have been in the service for 
many years. The fact that some of the girls who were living at the 
club the first year of its existence are still there, and are enjoying it 
as much as ever, is ample proof of its success, and disproves the 
ancient theory concerning the inability of teachers to live in 
harmony. 
Units required. The housing units required will vary 
with the size of the school. In the small school a house for 
the principa} and another for the women teachers will prove 
sufficient. However, in a larger and fully-equipped school 
the following facilities should be supplied: 
A home for the principal. 
A home for the women teachers. 
A dormitory for the men teachers and the boys who attend the 
schoc, but who for one reason or another do not go home. 
A cottage for the janitor. 
A cottage for the school mechanic, ,

  -HOUSING THE STAFF AND THE PUPILS 127 
A cottage for the girl pupils. 
An extra cottage for the teacher of vocational agriculture, or for 
any other member of the teaching staff with a family. 
Even with the high costs of building now only too familiar, 
very reasonable rentals are possible. The basis for comput- 
ing reasonable rentals is taken as interest on the investment 
plus the cost of operation by the district taking care of the 
bonds. With interest at six per cent, and modern houses 
fully furnished, the rents shculd range within the figures 
here given as minimum and maximum:

Facilities and equipment. With the woman’s building as 
a type we may consider the facilities required. First, there 
should be the usual service-rooms found in a modern resi- 
dence — a parlor or living-room, a dining-room, a kitchen, a 
combination study-hall and library, and a sewing-room. 
The bedrooms should be large and commodious, one to each 
teacher if possible, and at least no more than two teachers to 
aroom. There should be one extra room fora guest. Bath- 
rooms and toilets should be on the basis of one to each five 
persons. A bedroom, bath, and toilet should be planned on 
the first floor for the matron. In the basement, the heating- 
plant and a laundry room, equipped with an electric washer 
and electric irons, should be found. 
Under certain conditions some of the facilities listed may 
not be necessary. If the school is equipped with a laundry, 
it may be used by the teachers, provided the home is con- 
venient to it. It might also be practicable for the teachers 
to obtain all their meals from the school kitchen. Or, to put 
 
-P-A-G-E-142

the matter in another way, the facilities in the teachers’ 
home may be used in teaching domestic science. This 
would do away with the need of a model apartment, laundry, 
and perhaps even of a practice kitchen in the school. 
School homes illustrated. In order to show something of 
the type and the control of school homes a few citations are 
given. These are not held up as models, but they at least 
lend some concreteness to the discussion and give varying 
points of view. Let us notice first the plan in use at the 
Sargent Consolidated School, in Colorado, also described by 
Muerman:! 
One of these cottages is built for the superintendent and his 
family; the other, an eleven room cottage, for the teachers. These 
cottages cost $12,000 and are modern in every respect. The heat, 
light, and rent of the cottage are absolutely free to the teachers and 
to the superintendent. The teachers hire a woman to serve meals 
and to have general charge of the home. She buys all the supplies. 
At the end of each month, the matron with a committee of teachers 
figures the costs and pro rates it among the members of the club. 
The cost has run exceedingly low:

As an example of the student home we have the Cary, 
North Carolina, high school, as described by Miss Lathrop :? 
Both the dormitories are built of brick and have modern equip- 
ment. The boys’ building was erected in 1919 at a cost of $26,000, 
the girls’ building in 1916 at a cost of $11,000. Each has a capacity 
of 60 students. The rooms are supplied with furniture, other 
necessities are brought by the occupants of the rooms. 
The dining-room is in the basement of the school building. It 
has a seating capacity of 225. The amount paid for board covers

the cost of food, its preparation, and its service. In 1920, the 
average cost per month was $14; in 1921 it was $15. The matron 
receives as pay eight per cent of the gross receipts. She does all the 
buying and plans the meals with the codperation of the supervisor 
of home economics. Special attention is given to training in table 
etiquette. A long list of rules explaining what constitutes good 
table manners is provided for each student. 
As a final summary of housing methods for pupils consider 
the following description — more or less a composite of 
existing systems: 
The average school dormitory is built of wood. It costs $15,- 
000. It was built five years ago. The length is 100 feet, the 
width 40 feet. There are two stories and a basement. It is 
heated by a coal furnace and lighted by electricity. There are 
eight lavatories, four shower baths, and four tub baths. It has 
eight toilets. An extra room for hospital is provided. It will ac- 
commodate 60 pupils. 
The basement is fitted up with laundry tubs and electric irons. 
The dining hall is found in the dormitory building. Everything is 
supplied by the district with the exception of bed clothes, towels, 
and napkins. The management is in the hands of a matron who is 
paid $75 a month with board and room. She does all the buying, 
acts as chaperon, takes care of discipline, and in general, serves 
as house mother. The actual costs running at $18 a month are 
apportioned-among the pupils. 
Management of school homes. A few further comments 
upon the management of the homes is necessary. Among 
the first that arises is the question of rentals. Shall teachers 
and pupils pay for their rooms or not? Opinion is divided. 
The arguments seem to favor payment. The school is not a 
dispenser of charity. Unless the values of the rentals are 
plainly stated in dollars and cents, trustees are likely to 
overestimate their worth, and to tend to keep salaries lower 
than they would otherwise be. Moreover, the practice of 
paying for equivalent value raises the teacher in her own 
estimation and in the estimation of the public.
-P-A-G-E-144
    130 THE SCHOOL PLANT 
It also makes possible the establishment of homes where 
otherwise they could not be financed. The investment in a 
small district may run up as high as $50,000. This looms 
_ very large in the minds of the taxpayers. If they are assured 
that the rentals will take care of the payments, they will not 
be so reluctant to vote bonds. The teachers get the advan- 
tage of good homes at cost; the public reaps a profit in the 
added efficiency of the teachers. If the district does not 
care to finance the homes, it may be managed through a 
holding company of local business men.! 
The pupil problem is not widely different. While it would 
seem that worthy but needy pupils should be cared for, just 
as the law now authorizes the supplying of books and clothes, 
it would be well to put the matter on a slightly different 
basis. To this end a few scholarships might be awarded by 
the district. These would be sufficient in value to cover 
board and room. A few opportunities to exchange service 
for such accommodations might also be offered. If the 
number in need of assistance was very great, a system of 
taking notes without interest, due in three or four years 
after the students leave school, would be found practicable. 
Such devices might apply only to room rent and not to 
board. ; 
Rents should be collected by the school clerk, or by the 
district treasurer it the latter is a local officer. In the case of 
the pupils, a deposit sufficient to cover the anticipated ex- 
penses of a month should be required. A clause should be 
1 At Little Rock, Arkansas, a house was bought through the local build- 
ing and loan association. In this way, the initial expense to the school 
board was slight. The loan was distributed over a long period, and is 
being paid from the rental charged during the school year. During the 
summer, the four apartments are rented at a good figure to outsiders. The 
income from this period is used in making repairs and adding improve 
ments. The school force takes care of janitorial duties and attends to 
the lawn,

     HOUSING THE STAFF AND THE PUPILS 131 
put into the contracts of the employees, or provided for in 
the regulations, so that the last warrant is not issued until 
all claims of the district are paid. This is a common and 
simple business expedient which will appeal to any one who 
has had business experience. 
House rules. The houses should be governed by a simple 
code of rules. While each group should draw up its own 
regulations, a few uniform practices should be insisted upon. 
Points to be covered are: 
1. Hours of meals, study, and closing. 
2. The entertainment of company. 
8. Parties and other social functions. 
4. Care of rooms, equipment, and building. 
The custom in pupil dormitories of having elaborate rules 
isquitecommon. They cover nearly every conceivable sub- 
ject, from time of arising to the method of eating soup. 
Discipline topics are in predominance, and are evidently de- 
signed to anticipate possible acts rather than probable ones. 
Among the many recited by Miss Lathrop we may cite the 
following: ! 
1. Discipline will be strict and impartial; kind yet firm. Plenty 
of tact and judgment will be exercised in dealing with all 
cases. 
2. No student who persists in disobedience or fails to perform 
work assigned him, or who is exercising a bad influence upon 
the school, will be permitted to remain here. 
8. Idleness, profanity, or cigarette smoking will not be tolerated. 
4. Pupils must replace or pay for all articles broken or damaged 
in room or building for which they are responsible. 
5. The rooms must be kept clean and orderly at all times. 
Pupils will be graded on neatness. 
6. Pupils will not be allowed to attend any entertainment away 
from school without the approval of the principal.

7. Pupils must have a permit to go home, or to visit friend or 
relatives. 
8. Pupils must not leave the campus without permission of the 
faculty member in charge. 
9. Pupils are required to observe regular hours. Students are 
not allowed to visit rooms in study hours or to be out in the 
halls. Everybody must be perfectly quiet in the buildings 
during study periods and at all other times. 
These rules bear the imprint of forces outside of the dormi- 
tory group. It would appear that a form of self-government 
would be far more satisfactory to the pupils, and less exact- 
ing on the administration. What is desired is a home at- 
mosphere, a freedom commensurate with the wisdom of its 
exercise, and a generous consideration of others. This re- 
quires responsibility being placed upon the members, the de- 
velopment of good standards of conduct, and a sincere ap- 
proval of progress. The organization of house clubs, with 
student officers and student-devised rules, contributes to the 
citizenship objective. 
Advantages of the cottage plan. The cottage plan, froma 
number of angles, is superior to the common living-hall or 
dormitory. Accommodating from sixteen to twenty pupils, 
the composition of groups may be more wisely made. Dis- 
cipline is easier, and home conditions of the best type may 
be more closely approached. If deemed expedient, a teacher 
may be assigned to live in each cottage, and the expenses and 
to some extent the complication of an outside party as 
matron avoided. A codrdination of management under the 
home economics department, with its consequent educa- 
tional advantages, is made possible. Experience in dealing 
with wards of the State has demonstrated unmistakably that 
the cottage plan is better than the single hall. 
The cost feature itself is important. The initial invest- 
ment for the halls is greater. In smaller schools especially

one cannot be sure of keeping the rooms filled, as there is 
variation in the demand from year to year. The cost of 
operation, however, does not materially vary whether the 
rooms are filled to capacity, or whether only half of them are 
occupied. If the unit or cottage plan is adopted, if a cottage 
is not needed it can be rented to school employees. If 
located off the school property, or in some cases even when 
on the main grounds — say when tenants would not inter- 
fere in any way with the school activities nor be seriously 
disturbed by them — an extra cottage may be leased to 
outside parties. Finally, it is practically out of the question 
to manage a large dormitory without institutionalizing it. 
The dreary round of routine, of life regulated by gongs and 
minute prescriptive 
regulations, of uni- 
formity and stand- 
ardization, such as 
is found in typical

Principles of management and control. On the basis of

principles apply to pupil dormitory control and manage- 
ment. In most instances they also apply to teacher homes:

  ‘HOUSING THE STAFF AND THE PUPILS 135 
1. The general management of the homes should be in the hands 
of the principal. Special responsibility for each home should 
be lodged with committees or individuals. 
2. The sleeping quarters of boys and girls should be in separate 
houses. A common dining-room may be used. 
8. Accounts should be kept for all the homes by one person. 
Rent collections should be made by a school official, such as 
the clerk. 
4. The marketing, planning of menus and distribution of house- 
hold duties, should be under the direction of the head of the 
department of home economics. 
5. Cottages housing from ten to twenty persons are preferable to 
the barrack type of building. 
6. Laundries are essential. The installation of a central laundry 
to which all may have access is recommended. 
7. A hospital ward is essential if there is any considerable number 
of persons to be cared for. 
8. House regulations should be few, and of such nature as not to 
be rigorous and burdensome. Self-government should be 
practiced, and uniformity except in minor particulars is un- 
necessary. 
10. The relations and practices of the home life should be in accord 
with the highest ideals and conceptions, designed in fact to af- 
ford a model which the community would do well to imitate. 
The school home life should in itself contribute to the educa- 
tion of the students. 
Summary. From time immemorial, school homes have 
been furnished for pupils and teachers. It is still the pre- 
vailing practice in many European countries. Of late years, 
the custom has been gradually coming into the American 
public schools. They may be looked upon as a necessity in 
rural and consolidated schools. Facilities should be fur- 
nished for the principal, the teachers, the school workmen, 
and for a few pupils. Public money expended for school 
homes does not represent an outlay in the sense that other 
school buildings do. Rather they are an investment, as 
tenants may be expected to pay a rental large enough to 
eover all costs. The unit or colony plan is better than the

CHAPTER VIIT 
PLANNING THE TRANSPORTATION 
Organization of the transportation system. The adminis- 
trative unit contemplated in this book is one large enough te 
command the services of a well-trained principal and a com- 
petent teaching force. The school population will also be 
large enough to permit the organization of classes of the 
most economical size. The problem of transportation of 
pupils is almost certainly involved. In fact, transportation 
in the existing consolidated schools to-day stands next to in- 
struction in the demands made upon the budget. ( Approxi- 
mately twenty per cent of tle total expenditures of the con- 
solidated school goes for the transportation of pupils. This 
fact alone lends point to the statement that the success of 
the new type of school depends upon the success of the 
transportation system. 
The first requisite to successful transportation is central- 
ized control with centralized responsibility. It is funda- 
mentally right that this control be vested in the principal. 
It can be seen why the logical place for this control is with 
the principal when we recall that transportation is only a 
means of bringing the pupils together. It is a special aspect 
of the whole attendance problem. The principal’s responsi- 
bility begins when the child leaves home, and extends until 
he returns home. The school board has the legal authority 
in its hands. The members cannot perform the many 
duties connected with the execution of the task them- 
selves. They must delegate the duties to the principal, just 
as they delegate the purchasing of school supplies, the se- 
lection of teachers, and the supervision of instruction. 
The operation of the transportation calls for sound busi-
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
ness judgment. An untrained, careless, ignorant person 
cannot attend to it. Every one knows the care commercial 
transportation companies give to the selection of their man- 
aging officers. They realize the worth of ability in the cen- 
tral places of responsibility. It is indispensable in the con- 
trol of school transportation. Mistakes are costly in money, 
school loyalty, and human life. A well-developed procedure 
is essential. 
The details of administration are numerous — somewhat 
analogous in kind and quantity with the management of a 
street railway system, or other public carrier. The principal 
must be engineer, traffic manager, passenger agent, shop 
foreman, and publicity manager. He must plan, and he 
must execute on such vital matters as the following: 
1. Routing the territory and preparing the time schedules. 
2. Purchasing transportation units and supervising their repair 
and replacement. 
8. Selecting drivers, overseeing their work, and taking care of 
the records. 
Laying out the routes. It is to be regretted that districts 
have not been laid out with convenience of transportation in 
mind. Owing to the vagaries which occur in district shapes 
and contours, where districts vote themselves into consoli- 
dated units, many adjustments in routing must be made in 
order to reach all the homes in the transportation area with 
a minimum of mileage. When we get a system of organiza- 
tion such as the county unit, where districts are laid out in 
reference to transportation, the difficulties now existing will 
be greatly lessened. Until that time comes, the principal 
will have to make the best of the situation as he finds it. 
There are in any case certain fundamental considerations 
which should govern the routing of a district. These are: 
1. Each child should be given the shortest haul possible. 
2. One child should not be made to take a long ride in order that 
the ride of two children may be shortened.
-P-A-G-E-157
  PLANNING THE TRANSPORTATION 143 
8. Children who live far from school must expect to ride farther 
than those who live nearer. 
4. In general, no child should be asked to walk to meet a con- 
veyance, nor should parents be expected to transport a child 
to a conveyance. No economy results in miles saved in this 
manner. The conveyance should go to each home. 
5. Children living farthest from school should be picked up first. 
The unloading should be in the reverse order. 
6. Routes should be planned with the comfort and safety of the 
children as the first consideration. Economy of mileage is a 
secondary matter. 
7. Conveyvances should be kept at the “farthest out” point 
overnight whenever routes can be so arranged. This cuts the 
mileage in two. 
8. If heavy snowfall is an annual occurrence, the more miles that 
can be covered on north and south roads the better, as these 
roads are less apt to be blocked by drifts. 
Types of routes. Routes are classified into two types. 
The “circular” type is laid out from the school or other 
central point on one road, and, after making a loop or circuit, 
returns to the school on another road. It is usually a short 
route, and many of the principles which have been stated do 
not apply to it. Pupils who are near school may be taken 
over almost the whole route. The course may be varied at 
two-week intervals, so that the pupils picked up first one 
period may have the short ride in the morning and the long 
ride in the afternoon, and vice versa. It is quite common to 
combine a circular route with a longer route, the bus going 
out the second time in the forenoon and bringing the chil- 
dren on the short route to school, returning them first in the 
afternoon. While no absolute law as to the length can be 
laid down, the maximum length of time to be spent on a 
circular route is thirty minutes. If combined with a long 
route, the second haul should not be longer than fifteen 
minutes. 
The “shoe-string” route is the second type. It is laid out 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
in one general direction from the school, usually along a 
main road. At dismissal of school in the afternoon the bus 
leaves the building with its load of pupils, dropping them 
along the route at their homes. Side trips are made in to 
any homes not on the main road. At the last stop out or 
near it the bus is left. ‘The next morning it comes in to 
school, picking up the pupils in reverse order to which it 
dropped them the evening before. 
Going over the territory. A good road map should be 
early obtained by the principal. From his census and en- 
rollment data he should locate each pupil on the map, and 
have accurate measures of the distance and time between 
all stops. It is conceivable that with the help of some of 
the “‘old-timers”” who know the district well the routes 
might be laid out on paper without leaving the office. This 
is not the best plan, for various reasons. ‘The principal 
needs the first-hand impression of distances, time between 
stops, road conditions, and dangers that come from actually 
going over the route. Every home should be visited. Not 
only does the principal in this way get acquainted with the 
physical nature of the district, but the opportunity is 
afforded of making the acquaintance of the people. Even 
after he has been in the district some time, a trip over the 
routes annually is desirable. 
When the district has been completely covered — and 
this means all the roads leading to the school, and all the 
homes — the principal will have a map showing the total 
number of children to be transported and where they are 
located. From this and his first-hand knowledge of the 
roads, he should be able to lay out his routes intelligently. 
He should calculate how each house may be reached with the 
fewest possible number of conveyances, traveling a mini- 
mum of distance. He should also choose the route that is 
safest, even though it may be longer. The admission that
-P-A-G-E-159
PLANNING THE TRANSPORTATION 145 
one is taking chances in using one route over another is suffi- 
cient to condemn it. 
Special considerations in routing. The original practice 
in routing was to follow the main highways only. The chil- 
dren walked to meet the bus. Although this system is still 
being used in some places and recommended as practical, it 
ought to be abandoned. In fact, it is one of the justifiable 
causes of complaint against consolidation. The route 
should pass every home where there are children to be taken 
to school. This may add a few miles to the total distance, 
but it obviates the necessity of children standing out in the 
cold and the storm to wait for the conveyance. It elimi- 
nates the exposure incident to walking to the stopping-place. 
It prevents children from meeting in unsupervised groups at 
some country cross roads to wait. 
A route which does not permit the conveyance to go to 
each house, and still arrive at the school building with no 
child having been on the road more than an hour, is too long. 
‘The newer consolidated schools are quite generally following 
this rule. The advantages of the plan are that it places 
the child under competent supervision from the time he 
leaves home in the morning until he reaches home in the 
evening, safeguards his health, and reduces the fatigue and 
discomfort of travel to the minimum. If the hour ride is a 
necessity, the route should be planned, if possible, so that 
the pupil taking a long ride in the morning is spared it in the 
afternoon. This signifies a circular route, which is often im- 
practicable. Something will also depend upon the age of the 
pupils and the character of the roads. : 
The road problem. ‘The road problem becomes an in- 
sistent one to the principal engaged in transporting pupils. 
In the past he has been interested in roads merely as any 
good citizen. With the advent of pupil transportation, 
and especially of motor transportation, roads become one
-P-A-G-E-160
  146 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
of the conditioning factors of the success of his school. 
He will find himself taking an active part in road improve- 
ment. 
There are plenty of things he can do. If he is a skilled 
organizer, he can plan a Good Roads Day. On that day the 
men and larger boys of the district may ride out over the 
routes in the school conveyances and repair such places as 
are in need. The day may really be made a community 
event of some importance. A dinner prepared by the 
women and the school girls, and served at the schoolhouse, 
should be a feature of the program. It may be possible to 
combine Good Roads Day with School Grounds Improve- 
ment Day. While details are at work on the roads, others 
may be cleaning up the school grounds and improving them 
by planting trees, shrubs, lawns, and by laying out play- 
grounds and building playground equipment. 
The children and the drivers should be encouraged to 
bring in reports concerning road conditions. These should 
be passed on to the road overseer of the district. Where the 
county road organization is in vogue, reports should be made 
to the county overseer or engineer.!_ The pupils make splen- 
did good-roads propagandists, and may, with the help which 
they can gain from their parents, have the roads greatly im- 
proved. The local press can also be a powerful aid in the 
interests of good roads if the proper codperation exists be- 
tween the principal and the editor. 
Keeping the roads clear. In localities where snowfall is 
common, much can be done to keep the roads free from 
drifts. It has been found that drifting on east and west 
roads, which are the ones which give the most trouble, 
* In Gray County, Kansas, through the joint efforts of the three princi- 
pals of adjacent consolidated schools and the county superintendent, the 
county engineer was furnished route maps and agreed to give these roads 
special attention.  
-P-A-G-E-161
   PLANNING THE TRANSPORTATION 147 
is largely due to the presence of weeds and trash along 
the roadside. A community campaign in the fall to have 
the highway cleaned up will eliminate much of the diffi- 
culty. 
Occasionally the roads will be snowed full. To open up 
the roads after a heavy snowfall, a road-clearing organiza- 
tion is needed. Large snow plows may be stationed along 
the routes at intervals. When the heavy snows come each 
member of the organization turns out and clears the strip of 
road for which he is responsible. Either tractors or horses 
may be used to drag the plows. When this organization is 
well planned and properly inspired, the time lost on account 
of snow-blocked roads sinks to the minimum. As an addi- 
tional benefit, earth roads that are thus cleared will not 
become so muddy when the snow melts. 
Mud and storm holidays. Even with the best of care, 
country roads will occasionally be impassable, or at least in 
such condition as to cause delays and heavy strains upon the 
conveyances. There will also be days when, because of 
severe storms, there will be a considerable element of risk 
in sending the busses out over the routes. Every principal 
will have this situation to face sooner or later. He should 
act with decision when the time arrives. 
It is unquestionably wise not to send the conveyances out 
when weather conditions are extreme, or when roads are ina 
bad condition. The health and safety of the children is 
risked. Parents are put to worry and anxiety. The system 
will always lose support if chances are taken. Economy of 
transportation is also a factor. From this point of view, 
with motor-driven vehicles, one day of operating under bad 
road conditions is more detrimental than a week of ordinary 
driving. Very often, too, busses will be several hours late. 
In order to get the children home at a reasonable hour school 
will have-to be dismissed early. A large part of the day is 
      
  
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
likely to be lost anyway. It is therefore better to proclaim 
a holiday. 
Making up lost time. But what about the time lost in 
this manner? This question has caused many a. principal, 
for fear of criticism, to send the conveyances out when he 
should not have done so. As there are a number of satis- 
factory ways in which time ‘may be made up, the principal 
should not hesitate unduly to take the safe course. Among 
the methods which have been used to make up time, the 
following may be given: 
1. The school day may be lengthened slightly in good weather 
by shortening the noon intermission, beginning a few minutes 
earlier and closing a few minutes later. 
2. School may be started a little earlier in the fall, or held over a 
little later in the spring, with the definite understanding that 
there will be no school during severe weather. 
8. The school may be kept in session on Saturdays in good 
weather. 
4. Home work may be assigned and a review held when schocl is 
again in session. While no time is made up in one sense of the 
word by this plan, work may be kept up to date. 
Thoughtless people have severely criticized consolidation 
and transportation because a day is occasionally missed. 
How foolish such a criticism is may be inferred from the fact 
that, even disregarding days missed in the consolidated 
school, the pupils spend on an average forty per cent more 
1Some schools have followed the plan of continuing school during bad 
weather for those living near the school, and not depending upon trans- 
portation. Whether this should be done or not depends upon the number 
of pupils affected. If only a few pupils are forced to be absent, the plan 
should be adopted. The pupils who miss school may alone be expected to 
make up absences. The week following the close of the term might be used 
for the purpose, and a temporary regrading made that will demand the 
services of only a few of the teachers. If many pupils are out of school, it is 
better to close school entirely. Unless special coaching was given those not 
in attendance or they were given extra time, the first plan would scarcely 
be fair.
-P-A-G-E-163
  PLANNING THE TRANSPORTATION 149 
time in school than they did under the old one-room rural 
plan. The new attendance standards that have been set 
are as high as the average for city schools. 
A definite understanding should be had with the teachers 
and drivers as to the manner in which lost time is to be 
made up. While it at first thought seems unfair to pay 
teachers and drivers extra for making up time lost through 
“mud and storm” holidays, yet on the other hand it seems 
unfair for teachers and drivers to put in extra time without 
compensation when their expenses are going on just the 
same. Although the situation will vary according to locality 
and the personnel of the board, it is only fair that the dis- 
trict should share with the employees in the time lost. This 
means an extra compensation equal to expenses, or approxi- 
mating one-half salary. 
Using Government weather reports. The principal may 
expect, upon a few occasions, to face the situation of having 
such severe weather develop during the day as to make the 
afternoon trips of the conveyances somewhat dangerous. 
Where this can be anticipated, the wisest plan is to send the 
children home before the storm arrives. Weather reports 
will help in this respect. The principal should make ar- 
rangements, if in a region of bad storms, to receive daily the 
United States weather reports from the nearest observation 
station. 
In the areas of the most dangerous storms, it may be wise 
for the principal to obtain warnings from the weather bureau 
of the approach of unexpected storms. The telephone, tele- 
graph, or radio should be depended upon for this informa- 
tion. As soon as the warnings come, the pupils should be 
sent home. Again, we state that the principal of the con- 
solidated school must not shirk his responsibility for the 
safety of the children and the peace of mind of the parents 
when emergencies of any kind arise.
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
Making time schedules. In the first routing, even though 
it be but tentative, the time element must be considered. 
After the proposed routes have been marked on the maps, 
the next step is to ride over them at the rate of speed at 
which the conveyances will be expected to travel, stopping 
at each house, and recording the time consumed between the 
stops. This gives the basis for the making of the time 
schedule. A copy of the final schedule should be put in 
every home concerned. Any alteration of the original rout- 
ing can be made after the trial runs have been completed and 
the necessity for change has been shown. An allowance of 
one minute should be made for each stop. 
There will be some alteration of time schedules necessi- 
tated by muddy roads. The difference can be ascertained 
after a little experience. As a usual thing muddy roads will 
mean an earlier start. The first houses on the route will be 
reached earlier, the middle houses at about the usual time, 
and the last ones somewhat later than when running on the 
regular schedule. As soon as experience has demonstrated 
needs, patrons along the routes should be provided with 
special schedules for muddy roads in order to prevent wait- 
ing, either on the part of the bus or the children. Time 
schedules should be revised often and kept up to date as 
changes are made in the routes, or as families move in and 
out, requiring thereby more or fewer stops. 
It can readily be seen that the schedule should be rigidly 
adhered to. Unless this is done, and the one-minute stop 
enforced, the schedule becomes valueless. Under some cir- 
cumstances slightly more than a minute stop may be al- 
lowed, provided an acceptable reason has been given the 
driver in advance. The schedule should provide for the con- 
veyances reaching school fifteen minutes before opening. A 
report on the Iowa consolidations states that one of the out- 
standing difficulties with drivers is their desire to get the

children to school early and themselves return home to do a 
day’s work. This practice should not be tolerated. The 
regulations should state the time of arrival as given above, 
and not 8.30 or 8.45, as it may be desirable to set the hour of 
opening school earlier. The fifteen minute margin is to take 
care of emergency delays and should never be used for any 
other purpose. 
Auxiliary uses of school conveyances. The uses of school 
conveyances for purposes other than transporting pupils to 
and from school should be strictly limited. Nevertheless, 
there are some legitimate purposes for which the principal 
should not hesitate to use them. For example, they should 
always be available for taking classes in agriculture to farms, 
dairies, elevators, and other places where observation lessons 
will be helpful. Likewise the classes in home economics may 
desire to visit a flour mill, canning factory, or sugar mill. 
The conveyances should then be at their service. The rule 
should be to call upon the public transportation units for 
any strictly educational work which takes the pupils some 
distance from the school. 
The application of the foregoing justifies the use of the 
busses for the following purposes: 
1. Transporting athletic teams, properly representing the 
school, to other schools to take part in athletic contests. 
2. To take the children to fairs and exhibits in which they are 
participating. 
8. To take any sick or injured child home or to a doctor, where 
proper attention to his case may be given. 
. To bring pupils to evening school. 
. To gather up the members of special clubs and societies, such 
as community associations using the school building and 
sponsored by the school. 
6. To bring in parents and others to evening lectures or concerts, 
if this seems desirable for some special occasions. 
%. To bring parents and children to Sunday School and church 
provided the activities may be construed as under the man- oe

  152 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
agement of the school, and provided further that the school 
board has properly authorized the action. 
8. Library extension work is also a proper function. A compart- 
ment may be built into the busses for the books, and they 
inay be sent out over the routes to families that want the 
service. By this means a large amount of wholesome reading 
matter may be circulated through the community. 
Publicly or privately owned systems. The organization 
of the system should not be altered because the conveyances 
are privately owned. The treatment of the whole subject so 
far has assumed a publicly owned system. However, there 
are some who favor contracting with private owners of 
vehicles, but keeping the management in the hands of the 
principal. Some of the arguments pro and con are stated 
below: 
1. When competitive bids are resorted to, the private owners 
often make an agreement among themselves and make the 
costs exorbitant, sometimes splitting the profits. 
2, The method does not ensure the best drivers. It would be as 
unreasonable to expect good teachers by letting the instruc- 
tion out to the lowest bidder. 
8. The owner takes better care of his own vehicles than a driver 
will of publicly owned conveyances. 
4. The private plan relieves the school of putting out money in 
equipment, buying supplies and repairs, and taking care of the 
many details of operation. 
5. Public ownership means economy, greater comfort, depend- 
ability, and efficiency. 
6. If transportation is let out to bidders, the incompetent cannot 
be dismissed easily, and it is more difficult to find another who 
is willing to risk his money in the undertaking. 
7. It is more economical to operate publicly owned equipment. 
8. The number of breakdowns and delays are fewer under pub- 
licly owned systems. Repairs are cared for better, and in- 
spection is uniform and frequent. 
9. The driving can be done by pupils and by teachers if the 
equipment is owned by the district. 
10. There is a tendency to change from private to public owner- 
ship where the former has been tried.
-P-A-G-E-167
  PLANNING THE TRANSPORTATION 153 
Supplementing publicly owned transportation. There are 
districts where privately owned transportation is available 
to many of the pupils. Auto stages and electric railways are 
good examples.1_ When they come up to the standards de- 
manded for the school transportation system, the principal 
should make use of them. The public routes will then be 
laid out in relation to the privately operated systems. Be- 
fore approving the private systems the principal should 
satisfy himself on the following points: 
1. That the safety and comfort of the children will be looked 
after. 
2. That the schedules are such that the pupils will reach school 
on time, and will not be unduly delayed in reaching home. 
8. That the private system is as economical as the public. 
Privately owned carriers are generally willing to make 
alterations and adjustments if the business warrants it. 
They will also make concessions to the school. The district 
will bear the costs of transportation in case the private con- 
veyances are used. This introduces a minor problem of pur- 
chasing tickets and taking care of accounts. The district 
should be protected from any abuse of its confidence. 
Summary. Transportation is important because of the 
dependence of the safety and comfort of the pupils, the 
efficiency of.the school, and the economy of administration 
upon it. Management of the system should be put into the 
hands of the principal. It is his duty to route the territory, 
prepare the time schedules, purchase the units, and super- 
vise the operation. A careful map of roads should first be 
prepared. The principal should then go over the tentative 
routes, noting the time taken from place to place. The 
schedules should be followed scrupulously. An extra inter- 
est attaches to the good roads problem because of the rela- 
tion of the school to them, and everything possible should be

done to get the roads improved and keep them in repair, 
Schedules must be modified to meet bad road and weather 
conditions, and at times the school should be closed entirely. 
Time lost must be made up, the method chosen depending 
upon local conditions. As the conveyances belong to the 
public they should be used for public work. At times it may 
be better to rely upon private transportation systems, and 
any scheme of organization should take account of private 
means already in existence. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. Draw a map of a hypothetical or real consolidated district, comprising 
five or six small districts so grouped as to make a logical unit. Locate 
the houses, indicating the number of children in each. 
2. Trace the routes and determine the number of children to be trans- 
ported, the number of miles to be covered, and the number of routes 
necessary, keeping the maximum riding time down to no more than 
sixty minutes. 
3. Make out a typical time-schedule for one of the routes. 
4, To what extent, if any, should bad roads cause the principal to modify 
the general rule that the conveyances should go to every door? 
5. Discuss the various plans for making up lost. time due to storms or 
impassable roads. What plan do you favor? 
6. Outline, in some detail, a program that might be put on to bring about 
road improvement; to eliminate grade crossings. 
7. Comment upon the relative advantages and disadvantages of the cir- 
cular and shoe-string types of routes. Under what circumstances may 
a combined type be necessary? 
8. Enumerate the merits in having the conveyances call at each house 
for the children. 
9. Tell how you would organize a road-clearing association to open up 
the school routes after a heavy snow. 
10. State, at least in a general way, the regulations that should be adopted 
to protect the public against the abuse of the privilege of auxiliary use 
of the conveyances. 
11. For what reasons do the privately owned conveyances seem preferable 
to the publicly owned? For what reasons are they less desirable? 
12. Make any additions you can to the principles governing the routing 
of territory.

CHAPTER IX 
_THE PURCHASE AND CARE OF TRANSPORTATION 
UNITS 
What type to purchase. When the routing has been com- 
pleted and the total number of children to be transported is 
known, the principal has a sound basis for purchasing his 
conveyances, and not before. By waiting until his routes 
are established he will avoid the mistake of having a con- 
veyance too small to carry all the children on a given route, 
or too large to accommodate the children on another route. 
He will also be in a better position to choose between the 
motor vehicle and the horse-drawn vehicle. 
The motor bus seems to be supplanting the horse-drawn 
conveyance and to be the choice in new districts.!_ Consoli- 
dated schools have contributed to the impetus given to 
motor transportation during the World War. The following 
figures from a few States will serve to show the trend. Iowa 
has over six hundred motor conveyances in use, Colorado 
over four hundred, Kansas over two hundred, and Massa- 
chusetts over one hundred. California’s more than four 
hundred transportation units are nearly all motor drawn. 
Some of the advantages claimed for motor transportation 
are as follows: 
1. There is a great saving in time. Children do not leave home 
so early nor return so late. In schools where horse-drawn 
vehicles are used children often have to leave home as early as 
6 a.m., and reach home at a correspondingly late hour. 
2. More territory can be covered and longer routes can be es-

tablished, making the larger and more desirable consolida- 
tions possible. Horse-hack routes are limited to five or six 
miles. 
. Fewer vehicles and therefore fewer drivers are required. The 
trustees of White River Township school, in Randolph 
County, Indiana, say “One motor bus does the work of three 
horse-hacks.” 
. Children are saved a great deal of fatigue and discomfort. 
They do not come to school worn out with two hours on the 
road, as in the case when horse-hacks are used. The motor 
bus can make twelve miles an hour, including stops. 
. Although the initial cost of an auto bus greatly exceeds that 
of horses and wagon, its operating expense is less if efficiently 
managed. (See table below.) 
Children are better protected from the elements. They are 
not on the road so long, and the motor cars may be heated 
quite easily. 
The motor bus is far more comfortable, 
Children like to ride to school in the auto bus. They are 
more contented and in a better frame of mind when they 
arrive at school. 
. Motor transportation is more economical in that drivers can 
more easily follow some other occupation in connection with 
the driving. Little time is spent in driving the bus, while 
horse drivers feel that the trip is a day’s work in itself and 
charge accordingly. 
A longer term of school can be more easily maintained. 
Farmers do not like to furnish horses or to drive during the 
months from March to October, when farm work is at its 
height. 
It is easier to get drivers, since the owning of teams is no 
longer a prerequisite. 
Salaries paid for driving are less. The work is more desirable 
‘and usually attracts a better type of man. 
Daily attendance is more regular. 
Children do not have so far to walk, since with few exceptions 
it is more practicable to drive the motor bus to each house. 
Relative costs. Data are not very clear relative to the 
comparative costs of the two types of conveyances. Where 
the same basis for computation has been used, the motors

The costs vary so much between different sections of the 
country, on account of differences in roads, distances tray- 
eled, wages paid drivers, and so on, that comparisons do not 
mean much. From the tables preceding it may be seen that 
the median cost per pupil by motor bus ranges between 
twenty and twenty-four cents, and for horse-drawn wagons 
between twenty-five and thirty cents. In California, where
-P-A-G-E-172

good roads, long hauls, and high wages are the rule, motor 
bus costs run between fifteen and twenty cents per day for 
each pupil. In the Middle West it is possible to transport 
pupils by horse-hacks for from eight to ten cents a day, the 
hauls usually being less than six miles. As another illustra- 
tion, note the figures below, taken at random from Middle- 
West consolidations:

Selecting the motor bus. Assuming that motor-bus 
transportation has been decided upon, the problem of the 
principal is to purchase the units. At least five points 
should be thoughtfully considered. They are: 
1. Durability. 
2. Standard and prompt part-replacement service. 
38. Safety. 
4. Comfort. 
5. Convenience. 
Durability a prime factor. Power and steady perform- 
ance are more essential than speed. The school motor will 
have to meet the test of extremes in temperature and ex- 
tremes in road conditions. It will be loaded to capacity 
every day. It must be able to perform steadily at a mini- 
mum cost for upkeep and oil and fuel. With country road 
conditions such as they are in most of our States, and with 
continuous service demanded, it can be seen that the school 
motor will be called upon to meet as severe a test of service 
as is demanded of any motor vehicle in the commercial 
world. It should therefore be a type that has thoroughly 
proved its ability to stand up under commercial conditions. 
The principal cannot afford to try any experiments with new 
and untried cars,

_ 160 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
Comfort, safety, and convenience are dependent in no 
slight measure upon the motor body. The old lightly built 
type of wagonette, which is entirely satisfactory for a horse- 
drawn vehicle, is far from meeting the demands which a 
motor vehicle imposes. The frame must be strongly built. 
Special attention should be given to seeing that the doors 
and windows are substantially framed and hinged. Ample 
protection from the weather must be combined with work- 
able provisions for ventilation. In colder climates it is well 
to provide a heating device using heat from thé exhaust, but 
there must be every assurance that no exhaust gases will 
escape into the bus. The upholstering and the floor should 
be plain, simple, durable, and easily cleaned. Seat cushions 
are desirable. The plain seat boards often found in home- 
made auto bodies are very uncomfortable. It does not 
seem that everything should be sacrificed to economy. 
The best designs include at least two doors. Some prin- 
cipals favor three — two at the front end opening at the 
sides, and one in the middle rear. The door by which the 
children enter should be controlled by a lever from the 
driver’s seat. It ought to be possible to open at least one 
door quickly, and the custom of turning down a seat in front 
of the doo¢ is not to be recommended unless the road is level 
and the danger from fire reduced to near zero. 
Width of bus — kind of springs. A wide body is unde- 
sirable on the usual run of country roads. There is more 
danger of its tipping over if it is unevenly loaded. A low 
center of gravity is very essential, especially in hilly country 
where the roads slant enough to be dangerous. A special 
type of spring should be insisted upon. The ordinary “‘ex- 
press body” springs are too light for a load of twenty-five or 
thirty children on rough roads. On the other hand, the 
“heavy duty” springs are not resilient enough for the com- 
fort of the children. A happy medium is needed. In no  
-P-A-G-E-175
  
THE TRANSPORTATION UNITS 161 
case should the light spring be accepted, as the delays and 
repairs will prove too heavy a burden on the patience and 
the pocketbook. 
Other equipment. The inside of every bus should be 
electrically lighted. A mirror, giving the driver a full view 
of the interior of the vehicle is also a standard requirement. 
A reliable fire extinguisher or two should also be at hand. 
A little locker should be built beneath each seat for books 
and lunch. A tool-box, well equipped, should be placed 
near the driver’s seat. A good first-aid kit for emergencies 
is another essential. 
Each bus should carry a spare rim and tire. Various 
places have been suggested and tried as the best place to 
carry the spare tire. The most satisfactory seems to be 
underneath the rear end of the body, in a crate which the 
tire just fits. Bolting a regular tire carrier on to the rear end 
or side of the bus usually results in breaks and injuries to the 
body when passing over rough roads. There is seldom room 
enough for the tire inside the bus. Even when there is, it is 
not the proper place because of the mud brought in and the 
inconvenience of getting at it when changing. 
Size of bus. A thirty to thirty-five pupil bus is the most 
economical size to buy. This again signifies the advisability 
of laying out the territory in fairly uniform routes. Busses 
that carry fifteen to twenty pupils cost nearly as much as the 
large busses in the first place, and there is almost no differ- 
ence in their operating costs. Salaries are the biggest single 
item in operating costs. From forty to fifty per cent of the 
expense goes to this purpose. A good driver will have to be 
paid as much to take charge of a fifteen-pupil bus as to take 
charge of a thirty-pupil bus. 
However, one should not make the mistake of making 
bodies of too great a capacity for the trucks. This has hap- 
pened sometimes. Delays, breakdowns, and poor service
-P-A-G-E-176
  
162 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
generally are the consequences. The bodies should not be 
too long. Experience has shown that on long bodies, be- 
cause of the increased leverage, many rear springs are 
broken. There is also more danger in turning curves. 
Finally, broad, bulky busses are a nuisance on the road, to 
which every patron of any spirit is in protest. 
Replacement of busses. The average life of a motor bus 
is five years. Therefore, when a district assumes the ob- 
ligation of transporting its pupils, it may be assured of hav- 
ing to replace its trucks every five years. In view of such a 
recurring expenditure, some sound financial plan should be 
adopted which will make this necessary expense the most 
economical and the least burdensome to the taxpayers. 
When consolidation is first effected, means may be provided 
for meeting this first cost with a bond issue, in the same 
manner as funds are provided for the building, the homes, 
and the garage. 
To continue this practice, however, of bonding every five 
years to replace transportation units, would mean a constant 
overlapping of bond issues, even though short-term serial 
bonds were authorized. This plan would moreover involve 
a heavy and constant interest charge which is wasteful and 
generally unnecessary. As a way out, some districts are 
following a plan of issuing warrants which are presented and 
marked “not paid for want of funds.” They then bear in- 
terest at around six per cent until they are called, levies be- 
ing made the succeeding year to take care of the last year’s 
issues. This also means heavy interest charges, but is a 
more convenient way of raising money than by bonding. 
The soundest plan is to establish a sinking fund in ad- 
vance. It is also the most economical. By this means the 
cost is distributed evenly over five years, and obviates the 
necessity of paying interest. Instead, the sinking fund will 
be earning money for the district. In some States legisla-
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE TRANSPORTATION UNITS 163 
tion will be necessary before this plan can be used, as their 
present laws permit sinking funds only for the purpose of 
liquidating indebtedness already incurred. 
There is still another possibility. This is to make a levy 
high enough to cover the replacement the year it is needed. 
This is often practicable, and does away with all anxiety 
over the safety of sinking funds. The discussion which has 
preceded has assumed that all the busses will wear out at the 
sametime. This willnot bethecase. The rate of deprecia- 
tion on some will be much more than on others. Ina fleet of 
five transports bought new, one may have to ke replaced in 
three years, another in four, the third in five years, the 
fourth in six, and the last in’seven years. Thus the district 
keeps its fleet up by buying a bus a year, paying as it goes, 
This simple expedient is almost always possible. 
Comparisons of the costs of replacement by the various 
methods may be worth while. The bonding method is most 
expensive. The sinking-fund method is the cheapest. It 
must be remembered, however, that the last statement must 
be qualified. Though the pay-as-you-go method means giv- 
ing dollar for dollar, the taxpayer has had the use for his own 
purposes of the money up to the very day he turns it over to 
the district to buy transportation. By the sinking-fund 
plan the district has had his dollar and is drawing the income 
off it. The following figures are correct, bearing the fore- 
going qualification in mind: 
Borrowing for five years at six per cent every dollar costs. . .$1.30 
Levying taxes as money is needed for units costs........... 1.00 
Building up a sinking fund for five years costs.........06 ade eeaes)    
Disposing of old trucks. As has been stated, some trucks 
will not come up to the five-year expectation, while some 
will exceed it. Although, theoretically, trucks bought at the 
same time will wear out at the same time, it is doubtful if all
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
should be retained until their period of greatest usefulness 
has been passed. If a district puts all its worn-out trucks on 
the market at the same time, they will command less of 
salvage value. The growing disinclination of dealers to take 
in old cars also complicates the situation. It may be better 
-— especially where a considerable number of vehicles are 
used — to dispose of one each year and replace it with a 
new one. The school board could issue warrants or make a 
levy to care for the relatively small difference required in the 
trade. The little loss due to heavier depreciation the first 
year would be more than offset by the convenience of the 
method of financing, and to some degree by the greater eco- 
nomy. Of course, the whole qiiestion of which plan is better 
cannot be decided out of hand. Carefully kept records will 
help to determine when the law of diminishing returns sets 
in, and dictate the wisest plan in regard to replacements. 
The school mechanic. It has been frequently said in a 
joking way that the city school is run by the janitor. It 
may be said with more truth and less humor that the me- 
chanic runs the consolidated schools — at least the school 
where transportation is a factor. He is indeed the keystone 
in the transportation arch. Busses may be ever so carefully 
selected and ever so carefully driven, but without the con- 
stant care and supervision of a trained mechanic they will be 
exceedingly expensive to operate and even exceedingly dan- 
gerous. A poor mechanic means that the cars land in the 
scrap heap three years before their time. 
It is no doubt superfluous to mention that the first few 
weeks of use of anew motorare very critical to its further life. 
The cars must be broken in under the hand of an experienced 
person. This fact is called up here to point out the im- 
portance of the principal’s making an early selection of the 
mechanic. He should be.instructed to be on the job before 
school begins.

Type wanted. Perhaps no greater care should be given to 
the selection of a teacher than is given to the selection of the 
school mechanic. He must by all means be an expert. Any 
other kind will prove expensive in the long run. But this is 
not enough. He has personal relations with the principal 
and the drivers, and must be willing to receive orders and 
make suggestions in a way that will promote harmony. He 
must be a man who can take and feel the responsibility of the 
transportation system. There is much in favor of his being 
from elsewhere than the home community. It does away 
with the idea that the job is a plum to be passed around 
among the home boys. In general, it is the belief of the 
writers that better service will be rendered and more respon- 
sibility assumed by a man with a family who has reached the 
age of thirty years or more. 
Duties of the mechanic. The statement that the me- 
chanic must be able to feel responsibility for the transporta- 
tion system has several implications. It does not mean that 
he should assume the functions of the principal and the 
board. It does mean that the principal depends upon him 
to have all the busses in running order and ready to go out 
on their respective routes every day of the school year. It 
means that, like the principal, he will know no regular hours. 
His rising hours must of necessity be governed by the length 
of the routes, the condition of the roads and the weather, and 
the consequent starting time of the drivers. In cold weather 
he will have to be at the garage before the drivers in order 
to have the motors warmed up. He must inspect the oil, 
water, and gas supplies before each trip to prevent, as far as 
possible, the busses being stranded somewhere in the country 
for lack of these necessities. 
He will have the duty of making repairs. Oftentimes he 
will have to work far into the night to get some motor ready 
for next day’s trip. He will have to be able to get things 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
done that the unintelligent workman could not do. He will 
be at the beck and call of drivers out on the road in case an 
emergency arises. He will be required to remain at the 
garage until every car is in, regardless of how it interferes 
with his personal plans or his meal hours. 
This may seem like a strenuous regimen for the mechanic. 
There is no way out of it, however, if the school is to be kept 
going. Moreover, many long weary stretches will be com- 
pensated for in a measure by days in which he will have 
relatively little to do. This is particularly true if he does his 
work well while he is at it, and sees that nothing is neglected. 
A brief summary of his duties reveals that he will usually 
earn his salary. To illustrate, consider the following typical 
duties: 
1. To keep the cars in good mechanical condition. 
2. To keep the tires properly inflated and in good repair. 
8. To keep the cars clean outside and in, including their sweep- 
ing, dusting, and periodic disinfection. 
4. To see that the windows, doors, seats, lockers, fire extin- 
guisher, and tools with each car are in first-class condition. 
5. To make sure that no car starts out on a route without an 
ample supply of oil, water, and gas, one extra tire, and a set 
of tire chains. 
6. To keep a record of the oil, gas, and repairs and replace- 
ments on convenient blank forms, the record being kept for 
the cars separately. 
'. To report to the principal any evidence of carelessness or 
neglect of the busses on the part of drivers. 
. To take care of the tools and equipment in the school garage. 
. To make requisitions for needed supplies and extra parts. 
. To give the cars a complete overhauling during the vacation 
period., 
No fixed standard can be set by which to estimate the 
mechanic’s load. Some principals hold that six cars are all 
one man can take care of. Something will depend upon the 
durability of the cars, the character of the roads, the ability oom 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE TRANSPORTATION UNITS 167 
of the drivers, and the length of the routes, as well as the 
efficiency of the mechanic. If he is loaded too heavily, some 
of the non-mechanical work may be handed over to an ap- 
prentice. There may be a high-school boy who will be glad 
to help out for a reasonable compensation and a chance to 
learn something about the trade. 
The teacher mechanic. The plan of having a teacher of 
farm and motor mechanics take charge of the transportation 
mechanics is being used with apparent success in some of the 
larger consolidated schools. This calls for a well-trained 
teacher, which he ought to be in any case. He should in 
most cases be a graduate in mechanical engineering from an 
agricultural college or other technical school. Such a man 
commands a higher salary than does the ordinary shop 
teacher. 
Under this plan, the school garage becomes the laboratory 
work shop of the school. Much of the minor repair work on 
the busses can be done by the students as a part of the con- 
tent of their courses. This furnishes an ideal situation for 
making these courses practical, and at the same time makes 
it possible for one mechanic, with the help of his students, to 
handle ten to fifteen cars. If the scheme is adopted, it is 
highly important to secure as teacher a man of sound judg- 
ment and good educational training, who may be relied upon 
to make his work educative and of scope and nature that 
school credit may conscientiously be given. 
There are three leading dangers attendant on this plan 
which should be guarded against. One of these is in allow- 
ing unskilled students to undertake important repair work 
without proper supervision. If this is permitted, loss of life 
or financial loss to the district — perhaps both — is the in- 
evitable result. Second, some teachers either unconsciously 
or by design exploit the pupils by assigning to them the 
more disagreeable and less educative work of the shop.
-P-A-G-E-182
168 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
Finally, it may turn out that the teacher, in order to make 
his instruction theoretically and technically valuable to the 
students, may neglect the important aspects of his me- 
chanical duties and suffer the transportation system to de- 
teriorate and become inefficient. None of these dangers are 
necessarily inherent in the plan, but they are set down as 
things to be on guard against. 
The garage. A publicly owned transportation system is 
incomplete and unusable without a publicly owned garage 
and repair shop. The busses must be protected from the 
weather and against fire and theft, and there must also be a 
place where they can be worked on. To be sure, the plan of 
having publicly owned conveyances cared for in commercial 
garages has been tried, but the general accompaniment of 
the scheme has been annoyance and inefficient service. 
The school garage should be large enough to supply stor- 
age room for all the cars in service, and for the extra or 
emergency car with which every well equipped transporta- 
. tion system should be provided. In addition, there should 
be a work room large enough to take care of one bus. The 
~ equipment should be of first-class quality and sufficient in 
amount to handle all ordinary jobs. The entire structure 
should be heated and lighted, so that the work may be 
carried on day or night, winter or summer, with comfort and 
dispatch. In localities where cold winters are the rule, the 
saving in prevention of cold motors, and frozen storage 
batteries and radiators will pay for the heating. 
A spacious platform of concrete, cinders, or gravel should 
| be built at the garage entrance. This furnishes a place for 
the washing of the cars, and, if the shop is in a separate 
building from the storage, will make it possible to transfer 
from one to the other without getting the cars in the mud. 
A short all-weather road should connect the garage with the 
point of disembarkation in front of the school. During the 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
ee ee eS THE TRANSPORTATION UNITS 169 
summer months the busses should be supported on firm 
wooden horses, as tires last much longer if deflated when not 
in use. 
Shop equipment and supplies. The tools for the work 
shop should be carefully selected. There should be no frills 
and no surplus extras. The equipment ought to be com- 
plete enough to ensure independent work on all but very 
unusual repairs. Tools, work benches, and supply cup- 
boards should be arranged for economy, security, and con- 
venience. Only tools and equipment of standard quality 
should be put in, no matter how attractive the prices offered 
on non-standard material. 
It is fot a simple matter to determine the kind and 
amount of supplies to be kept on hand. A duplicate for all 
parts that are most apt to break or wear out in service is the 
minimum. Parts which will never or probably never be 
used are a poor investment for the district. A few extra 
tires ought to be in the store room. If the cars are of the 
same make, there is a chance to make a slight saving in 
buying, and repairs and replacements are more easily made. 
The district should buy gas and oil in quantities in order to 
get the dealer’s price. 
In making up a list of needed extra parts, it is best to con- 
sult first the mechanic — in fact it ought to be his duty to 
prepare the list. If the principal is doubtful on any point, 
he can get the opinion of the local dealer or the manufacturer 
from whom the cars were purchased. The best aid will be 
the experience of the school. In order to make this of most 
account, complete and accurate records ‘of repairs and re- 
placements, and of all supplies used must be kept. The 
mechanic is the proper person to make the original record, 
but the principal may have the mechanic’s reports trans- 
ferred to the permanent books of record by his clerk. With 
a clear record of past experience at his disposal, the principal
-P-A-G-E-184
yr 
  170 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
should be able to predict closely what will be needed for the 
future. The number of days which busses are out of service 
because of repairs which are needed immediately, but must 
be ordered from some distant city, should be insignificant. 
Report forms. Since supply and parts orders are to be 
made on the basis of the facts of experience, we see the 
necessity of a complete and easily interpreted statistical re- 
cord of repair, replacement, and operation facts. What 
these pertinent facts are may be seen from an examination of 
the forms which follow:

efficiency dictate generally that motor vehicles be given the 
preference over horse-drawn vehicles. So little is transpor- 
tation standardized that costs vary greatly in different sec- 
tions of the country, and among different schools in the same 
State. Units should be purchased with an eye to their 
durability, economy, and convenience for the pupils. The 
first depends upon the chassis; the second mainly upon the 
type of car body. Each car should be adequately equipped 
and furnished. In replacing worn-out cars, the pay-as- 
you-go policy is best. If a rotation process of replacing one 
unit a year is worked out, the policy is not burdensome. 
A skilled mechanic is needed to keep the cars in running 
order. He should assume the responsibility of keeping the 
transportation system efficient all the time. Only a good 
type of workman can do this. In some schools it has been 
found feasible to turn the repair and operation duties over to 
a regular member of the teaching force. The garage and 
shop then is made into a teaching laboratory. If a few 
simple cautions are observed, this plan will work well. It 
makes instruction better, and is far more economical. It is 
seldom that the smooth running of the transportation sys- 
tem suffers as a consequence. A school transportation sys- 
tem is not complete without its garage, shop, and shop 
equipment. A small stock of tires and parts must also be 
kept on hand. The needs can best be discovered for each 
school by keeping a set of records, a necessity also in showing 
the work of the transportation system. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. Make out as complete a list as you can of matters concerning which 
the school mechanic and not the principal should decide. 
%. Compare busses with seats along the sides bench-fashion, with busses 
having seats perpendicular to the sides as in a railway coach. Which 
is more satisfactory? 
8. Discuss the requirements which a school bus window should meet.

4. Investigate and make a report upon the extent and effects of state aid 
for pupil transportation. 
5. The statement has been made that the expense of operating and re- 
placing motor transportation units is so great as to eventually run the 
districts using them so deeply into debt as to bankrupt them. Dis- 
cuss the truth of the statement. 
6. Present some of the factors which help to make comparisons of the 
relative costs of transportation methods extremely unreliable. 
7. Point out some of the difficulties in laying out routes so that busses of 
equal capacity will be required. 
8. Suppose that the roads are quite muddy. The principal believes that 
the trip can be made safely. The mechanic says that it is possible, but 
he advises against it because of the strain on the cars. What should 
be done? 
9. Make out a working schedule to guide the mechanic in preparing 
busses for the morning trip, assuming that he has not inspected them 
the evening before. 
10. Show the merits and disadvantages of the sinking-fund plan of financ- 
ing bus replacement. 
11. Make out a brief, for and against the teacher-mechanic plan. 
12. Under present conditions what should be an adequate salary for a 
first-class school mechanic. Could our principles of schedule making 
for teachers be applied to his case? 
13. Criticise the forms given in the chapter. What additions or changes 
should be made? 
14. After reading this chapter on some of the details of administering a 
publicly owned transportation system, what do you think of the com- 
parative merits of the publicly and privately owned types? Discuss.

  CHAPTER X 
THE DRIVER AND THE RECORDS 
Importance of the driver. ‘The importance of dependable 
drivers for school busses cannot be overestimated. They 
are responsible for the morals, the government, and the lives 
of the children who ride with them. This responsibility 
should be legally recognized, should be direct, and should be 
secured by bond. Since in the case of legal action due to the 
carelessness of drivers the responsibility is fastened upon the 
school board, it is imperative that the board should have the 
drivers under contract and under bond for the faithful per- 
formance of their duties. Naturally, the concern of the 
principal and the board is not merely financial protection, 
but assurance that the children will be protected. The best 
type of driver that can be obtained is none too good. 
The principal should be a party to any agreement drawn 
up with the drivers, and it should be definitely understood 
that they are to be under his direction. At present there is 
a sad lack of definiteness in the legal requirements for school 
bus drivers in the many States which have pupil transpor- 
tation. Regardless of their completeness, strictness, and 
sternness, penalties cannot fully solve the problem. Its 
solution is largely a matter of the selection and control of the 
drivers locally — a matter which rests with the principal. 
A realization of the vital importance of the driver to the 
success of transportation and to the welfare of the children 
will make the principal particular about the qualifications of 
the people he recommends to the board for appointment. 
Qualifications of drivers. This leads us to the question of 
what the qualifications of a good driver are. First of all he 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
DRIVER AND RECORDS 175 
must be physically able to handle the motor bus, in all kinds 
of weather, throughout the school year. This calls for keen- 
ness of sight and hearing, steady nerves, sound judgment, 
robust health, and at times for the strength of a strong man. 
He must know enough about the car to prevent his abusing 
it through ignorance. He should be able to make minor 
repairs, change tires, and drive skillfully. He ought to 
know the traffic rules perfectly, and should be a good enough 
citizen to respect them. 
The discipline problem will in a greater or less degree be 
his concern. The principal can lessen this by organizing 
self-governing groups, with the older pupils sharing the re- 
sponsibility. Neatness in dress and good personal habits, 
including cleanliness, are indispensable requirements. He 
must be one who can be relied upon absolutely to conform to 
his schedule, and to comply with the rules and regulations 
made by the board in conjunction with the principal. He 
should be of legal age, unless his parents are willing to take 
legal responsibility for him. This point might arise in case 
of a high-school student who could meet all of the require- 
ments and would be able to drive with advantage to himself 
and to the school. If the requirements seem strict, it is only 
necessary to recall some of the fatal accidents of the past few 
years due to the deficiencies of drivers. 
All in all, competent drivers are to be found in almost 
every community. If not in the community, they can be 
brought in. Mature men with the qualifications are the 
best — preferably those with children in the school. Re- 
tired and active farmers make good drivers. Older high- 
school boys whose parents will go their bonds and sign the 
driver’s contract with them are acceptable. Bank clerks, 
skilled workmen, and young business men are sometimes so 
situated that they can give the extra hours demanded for 
driving, and are glad to do so if properly approached. 
   
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
Teachers as drivers. There has been some argument as 
to whether teachers should drive the school conveyances or 
not. The matter practically resolves itself into the question 
“Shall women drive?” but in this discussion it is treated 
independent of the sex of the parties. Most of the literature 
on the subject unqualifiedly endorses women teachers as the 
best drivers. Three main lines of reasoning have been ad- 
vanced: 
1. Because of her position of authority, the teacher will be able 
to maintain good order and a high moral atmosphere in the 
bus. 
2. Driving the route furnishes a splendid outing for the teacher, 
and withal is an experience that develops her self-confidence. 
38. It is more economical to employ teachers because they will 
work for less. 
While these arguments are doubtless important, we may 
still seriously raise the question whether a teacher should be 
permitted to drive a bus at all. There is another side to the 
proposition, as the following list of objections will show: 
1. Driving a route means that the teacher, in addition to her 
time in the schoolroom, puts in from two to five hours a day. 
She must leave home after a hurried breakfast, at an hour 
earlier than most teachers care to rise regularly. She must 
leave the schoolroom immediately after the close of the day, 
and with no opportunity to return that day. She will be ex- 
pected to drive regularly in all kinds of weather and on all 
kinds of roads, regardless of her physical condition. It must 
be frankly admitted that it is doubtful if the teacher can live 
up to such requirements without seriously endangering her 
health. 
2. If a woman — and it has been conceded that this would gen- 
erally be the case — she will still have to face the possibility 
of getting out into the mud to put on the chains or change a 
tire. She will have to manage the heavy bus on muddy 
roads at night, meeting situations that would tax the strength 
and endurance of the strongest of men. On the return trip 
at night she will be appealed to for rides by tramps and trans-
-P-A-G-E-191
DRIVER AND RECORDS 177 
ent laborers, some of whom are not averse to forcing their 
company upon her. She will have to brave the blizzard and 
the tornado, the rain and the lightning. Snow, ice, mud, and 
flood are unwelcome but inevitable incidents of driving. 
Effect upon teaching efficiency. The real issue turns upon 
the effect driving has upon teaching efficiency. Keeping in 
mind the demands of the route on time and strength, we 
may well ask, will a teacher have time to attend properly to 
her lesson preparation, paper grading, reporting, and plan- 
ning in addition to driving? Is it not too much to expect 
that a teacher can come in from a strenuous trip on the road, 
and walk immediately into the schoolroom and begin effec- 
tive teaching? Moreover, if in a village school, the pupils 
who walk to school will be left unsupervised in the rooms 
until just before the morning session begins. After school 
the teacher has no time for the pupils, and no time to attend 
teachers’ meetings. 
At the same time, it is impossible for her to keep up pro- 
fessional reading. She has no time left for cultural and 
social pursuits. The probable effect of the grind of driving 
and teaching upon her disposition is not a happy one to con- 
template. As a form of recreation, driving a heavy bus is 
not the most desirable for one who spends the remainder of 
the day as a teacher necessarily must. Relief from the trials 
of discipline and supervising the morals of children is what 
she needs. Finally, the difficulties of keeping up a neat and 
attractive appearance in the schoolroom must be noticeably 
increased because of the exactions of bus-driving. 
Final considerations. The foregoing arguments suggest 
that although a teacher may make a good bus-driver, a good 
bus-driver cannot be all that a teacher should be. After all, 
if rural and village teaching is to be raised to the professional 
standard of the cities, teachers must be hired in view of their 
competence as teachers. A poor teacher gains nothing in 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
178 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
the eyes of the professional principal because she happens to 
be able to steer an automobile straight. Admitting that 
there are teachers who are able to handle successfully the 
difficult job of driver without impairing their teaching effi- 
ciency in any marked degree, they are clearly the exceptions, 
and it is admissible that it would be more profitable for 
themselves and for the district if they were to turn all their 
energies into the teaching channel. 
The economy contention is untenable. It is always poor 
economy to deprive the school of the full measure of the 
teacher’s capacity for teaching. If she has a part of the 
working day free from classroom duties, the time can be 
well directed towards the so-called extra curricular work, 
self-improvement, and recreation. She should be paid 
enough for teaching to give her economic independence of 
the few dollars her services as a driver are thought worth. 
If transporting school children is a proper function of the 
school corporation, then adequate wages should be paid to 
those who can best perform the service without interfering 
with the work of the school. 
The driver’s salary. The simplest answer to the question, 
“What pay shall the driver receive?” is, “Such pay as is 
necessary to secure the quality of services desired.” Sal- 
aries now range from twenty to fifty dollars a month. The 
amounts will vary on routes of different lengths in the same 
district, if there is any appreciable difference in the time 
required to cover the routes. Sixty cents an hour, based on 
scheduled time, is the prevailing rate in a number of dis- 
tricts. As the position is one of honor and trust, this rate 
seems low enough. 
Contracts usually call for the payment of a straight 
month’s salary, regardless of whether or not all the trips 
have been made. In some districts, a half rate only is 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  
DRIVER AND RECORDS 179 
allowed for days the schools are closed. Generally speaking, 
it is better to pay the full amount, with half rate for extra 
trips to make up lost time through mud and storm holidays. 
Whatever the provision, it should be written into the driver’s 
contract. 
The contract. Contracts are ordinarily made with the 
drivers. Some principals prefer to rely upon obtaining 
trustworthy drivers, and draw up rules for their guidance. 
Although it is true that a driver who can be trusted only if 
he is under contract is not the type wanted, at the same 
time, the contract is a protection for the district and the 
principal that the wise administrator is not apt to overlook. 
It shows to the public that all the precautions possible have 
been taken, and in the event of trouble is good evidence in 
court. Items such as the following belong in the agreement: 
1. The time of starting. 
2. The speed at which the vehicle is to be driven. 
8. A description of the route, the stops to be made, and the 
length of the stops. 
4. All safety precautions to be taken by the driver. 
. Standards of conduct to be observed by the driver and by the 
passengers. 
Purposes for which the conveyance is to be used. 
The driver’s compensation and conditions governing it. 
. The appointment and pay of substitutes. 
The circumstances under which the bond is to be forfeited. ox er

Rules for drivers. The principal should draw up a list of 
rules for the guidance of the drivers. After being approved 
by the school board, they should be printed and a copy given 
to each driver, and a copy posted in the garage and in each 
bus. The following are illustrative:

14. Drivers should comply with the schedule in every detail un- 
less circumstances make it impossible. Any deviation from 
this must be reported promptly to the principal, together 
with reasons for the same. 
Any mechanical difficulties or adjustments made on bus 
should be reported to the mechanic immediately upon 
arrival at the garage. 
. The driver shall at no time when the children are in the bus, 
exceed twenty miles an hour nor five miles an hour over 
wooden bridges or culverts. 
. No driver shall leave the bus with motor running. 
‘The bus shall not be started until all children are seated and 
the doors are closed. 
. The driver shall be governed by all rules of the road. 
No assistance shall be given by the driver to any other 
vehicle on the road. 
. No stranger shall be permitted to ride in the bus at any time. 
. The driver shall permit no other person to drive the bus, oc- 
cupy his seat, or tamper with the motor or any of its controls; 
excepting such persons as are approved by the principal, and 
then only by his direct authorization. 
If, in case of illness or other emergency, the driver requires a 
substitute, he shall notify the principal at least one hour, and 
sooner if possible, before the next trip is to be made. 
No railroad shall be crossed until bus has been brought te a 
complete stop, and some child authorized by the driver shall 
have gone up to the crossing and have looked in both diree- 
tions. If the track is declared clear, the bus shall then pro- 
ceed across the track. The appointed child shall continue to 
watch until the bus has safely passed the crossing. 
No driver shall use tobacco while children are in the bus. 
. The drivers shall report daily to the principal on approved 
blanks; all pupils absent or causing bus to wait more than the 
alloted time, all pupils infringing on rules of discipline, all ac- 
cidents, motor difficulties, irregularities in schedule, and road 
needing repair. 
The driver shall horn at all cross roads, beginning at least 
fifty yards before crossing is reached.

15. In case of accident, where bus is stopped on the road, the 
driver shall not leave the bus to go or ’phone for help; but 
shall send some responsible child to the nearest house. 
Where necessary, he may send a note with it.t 
16. The driver shall see that the following regulations are ob- 
served by all pupil passengers. 
a. All pupils shall be seated immediately upon entering the 
bus, in the place which has been assigned by the driver. 
b. No pupil shall stand or move from place to place during 
the trip. 
ce. Loud, boisterous, or profane language, or indecent conduct 
shall not be tolerated.? 
d. Pupils are not to tease or handle one another. 
e. No windows or doors are to be opened or closed except by 
permission of the driver. 
f. No pupil shall enter or leave the bus until it has come to a 
full stop and the door has been opened by the driver. 
g. In entering or leaving, no pupil shall pass in front of the 
bus. If necessary to cross the road, he must pass behind 
the bus. 
h. If a child has not entered the bus or reported within one 
minute after schedule time of leaving his home, the bus 
shall not be held longer on his account. 
¢. Any child who does not enter the bus within one minute 
after schedule time shall be reported to the principal as 
tardy. If the bus is delayed by causes for which children 
are not responsible, they shall not be considered tardy. 
j. Upon entry into the bus, the child’s lunch box and books 
should be deposited in the lunch box cupboard just beneath 
his assigned seat. 
The need for and type of transportation records. The day 
of economical and uniform transportation in the United 
States will be hastened by carefully kept records of experi- 
ence and costs. It is on the basis of such records that 
1 It is recommended that a radiophone, or a portable telephone that may 
be attached to a regular telephone line, be carried as part of the regular 
equipment of every bus. 
2 If emergencies or motor difficulties calling for close concentration on the 
part of the driver arise, he may require absolute silence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM 
changes which make for economy and efficiency can be 
effected in the transportation system. Let us inquire first 
what information should be kept that will be valuable in 
these respects. 
It is fundamental to know what transportation is costing 
as a whole and per unit. This unit cost should be calculated 
on some basis that will be comparable as between different 
school systems. Common practices in computing such unit 
costs is varied and uncertain. Some schools are reporting 
costs in terms of costs per mile; others costs per day; and still 
others costs per day per pupil. None of these are entirelv 
satisfactory, either from the standpoint of accurately repre- 
senting the facts or as a basis for comparing costs in one 
school with costs in another. 
Let us briefly consider these units. It is obvious that cost 
per day per pupil is not a just basis for comparing the effi- 
ciency of transportation in two schools, if the average dis- 
tance that pupils are hauled is greater in one than in the 
other. It is also unsuitable if other factors, such as condi- 
tion of roads, vary. Cost per day, per mile, or per pupil 
ignores too many variable factors to need further comment. 
Cost per-pupil-mile, based upon the number of miles each 
child is actually carried in the bus, gives the truest picture of 
the facts. Cost per-pupil-mile figured on this basis will 
mean the same in any school system, as it includes the two 
variable factors upon which costs are largely dependent — 
pupils and distance. The one important variable not in- 
cluded is road conditions. With only this factor to account 
for, its effect can be calculated to some degree, and the re- 
sults furnish convincing proof of the value of good roads.! 
1 It was found in a certain consolidated school in Kansas, by means of 
such records, that during the years 1920-22 tire costs on routes with un- 
graded roads exceeded those on graded roads by more than one third. It 
was also disclosed that expenses on muddy days more than doubled those on 
days when the roads were dry.
-P-A-G-E-199
  DRIVER AND RECORDS 185 
The drivers’ reports. Only essentials should be reported 
by the drivers. Unnecessarily long and detailed reports are 
a potent cause of dissatisfaction. The principal will want to 
know mileage in order to know the value being got out of 
oil, gas, and tires. He will want to use mileage in computing 
unit costs. A record of trips missed by busses will help him 
to gauge the care being taken of them. A record of delays 
and their causes will make it possible to take steps to prevent 
them in the future. Such points as those which follow may 
rightly be embodied in daily reports: 
1. Deviations from route. 
a. Distance. 
b. Cause. 
2. Delays. 
a. Length. 
b. Cause. 
. Pupils absent or tardy. 
. Unsatisfactory road conditions, 
a. Nature. 
b. Location. OO 
Cases of discipline should be reported personally to the 
principal. Mechanical difficulties should be reported per- 
sonally to the mechanic. Minor matters, such as hour the 
bus started, or hour it reached the school, may be omitted. 
It is the principal’s business to know about such details as 
this, and call the attention of the driver to them if the situa- 
tion demands it. 3] 
Permanent records of transportation. Essential items 
should be combined in a permanent record system. Such a 
record will be referred to in purchasing supplies, in making 
up the budget, and in calculating unit costs. Data on the 
points given below are important: 
1. Original cost of conveyances. 
2. Cost of garage and equipment. 
8. Amount of additional equipment and cost of same.
-P-A-G-E-200

6. . Cost of fuel and lubricants for busses. 
. Amount spent for insurance on garage and busses. 
. Interest chargeable to any indebtedness connected with the 
transportation system, including the garage and busses. 
7. Salary of mechanic. 
8. Salaries of drivers. 
9. Part of principal’s salary chargeable to transportation. 
10. Total number of miles each bus traveled. 
11. Tire mileage. . 
12. Gas, oil, and grease consumption of each car.

14. Length of life and service of each bus. 
15. Number of pupil miles credited to each. | 
16. Salvage value for each bus replaced. 
17. Accidents with causes. 
Report forms. In the pages that immediately follow 
three typical record forms are given. ‘The first is the 
driver’s weekly report. It covers the same points reported 
on daily, states the number of trips missed, and emphasizes 
the safety element at crossings. The second form is the 
principal’s weekly summary, the data being taken from the 
reports of the drivers and the mechanic. The third is de- 
signed for use in reporting to the school board, and contains 
the facts needed for the annual report. From the monthly 
reports the principal can quickly calculate the costs and the 
efficiency of the transportation system. 
Summary. Only individuals of good character, steady 
and dependable, should be employed as drivers. They 
should be fully competent physically and mentally. They 
should be under the supervision of the principal, to whom 
should be delegated the authority of appointment. While 
teachers are satisfactory drivers, their teaching efficiency is 
lessened thereby and it is better to appoint others. An ade- 
quate salary should be paid, the average standard being 
about sixty cents an hour. To ensure against misunder- 
standings, and as evidence of good business methods, a con-

tract should be signed specifying the conditions and require- 
ments of each driver’s job. The contract should be enforced 
by a duly executed bond, sufficient in amount to protect the 
district. Rules plainly setting forth the driver’s duties 
should be drawn up and posted in each vehicle. As a check 
upon the performance of the transportation system, concise 
reports should be rendered daily and weekly by each driver. 
The principal should combine data from the reports of the 
mechanic and the drivers into complete weekly and monthly 
statements covering the operation of the transportation 
system.

1. List, in the order of their importance, the qualities of a good bus- 
driver. 
2. Sum up the arguments for and against teacher drivers. 
8. Make a list of the items concerning the control of drivers which should 
find a place in the contract. 
4. What rules can you suggest for the administration of the transporta- 
tion system which do not belong in the driver’s contract, but refer to 
the driver? 
5. Discuss the advisability of having the bus rules posted in the bus or in 
a public place. Should it be done? 
6. Point out the advantages and disadvantages in employing pupils as 
drivers. 
7. What rules for pupil control would you add to the list which has been 
given? What ones should in your judgment be modified or omitted? 
8. Make a list of reasons for keeping a thoroughgoing system of records 
of transportation. 
9. Compare the various cost units with each other in respect to value. 
What is the chief objective of records? 
10. Explain the reasons for including the items named in the suggested 
report of the bus-driver. 
11. Point out the dangers underlying too much record keeping by the 
principal and the school employees.

CHAPTER XI 
PLANNING THE DAILY PROGRAM 
Purpose served by the program. The daily program serves 
to make for a proper distribution of emphasis. If pupils 
were left to their own inclinations, they would doubtless 
tend to distribute their time unevenly. They would per- 
haps neglect the very things which they needed the most. 
The schedule also distributes the teacher’s time with some 
regard to proportion. A teacher without a due sense of 
what is worth while is guided by the lines marked out in 
the program. Finally, the daily program is prepared in 
a definite order, providing for the taking up of activities at 
the period when their teaching can go on most effectively, 
and rendering it possible to anticipate their coming so that 
the pupils and the teachers may be prepared. This makes 
for order and develops foresight. A school without a reg- 
ular program can never be a happy nor a well-controlled 
school. 
The situation. The village and the consolidated school 
enjoy some advantages in program-making. They are very 
largely independent of other schools — unlike the school in 
the city where the programs must be shaped for all more or 
less alike. The total time allotment, and the division among 
subjects, may be made with the special needs of the school 
and that school alone in mind. The grades and the high 
school may usually be closely integrated, and the school uni- 
fied in a way not possible in the separate and specialized 
divisions in the city. 
A few disadvantages may be found in the early days of the 
reorganized schools. A wide range of ability will be found 
among the pupils. Groups will not be so homogeneous as
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
are found in the well-graded city school. Considerable 
variability in achievement will exist in the case of individ- 
uals. A pupil may rank relatively high in one subject and low 
in another. This adds to the difficulty of programming be- 
cause it makes promotion by subject more necessary. Fur- 
thermore, there is a lack of accurate standards by which one 
can judge attainment among country pupils. 
Types of situations. In general, the daily programs will 
vary as the organization of the school. The duties of the 
principal in the preparation of the schedules will vary in the 
same proportion. In one type he will have little to do in 
making the program, in another he will be called upon to 
make the program for‘the whole school. The type situa- 
tions, any of which are considered as probable, are as follows: 
1. The classroom type of school. 
2. The partly or wholly departmentalized type. 
8. The classroom or departmentalized type, in which one or 
more special teachers are brought in for a few periods. 
4. The classroom or departmentalized type, in which one or 
more classes are sent to other schools for some instruction. 
5. The platoon type. 
Function of the principal; time schedules. ‘The prepara- 
tion of time allotments is one of the first functions the prin- 
cipal must perform, no matter what the type of organization. 
It is thus that a proper distribution of emphasis is ensured. 
The length of the school day is usually arbitrarily deter- 
mined. The custom has been to fix it at from four and one 
half to six hours, with a five-day week. If the broadening of 
the curriculum warrants it, the day may be extended to 
seven or seven and one half hours, and the week to six days. 
This is a point to be worked out with the teachers and the 
school board. On the distribution of the total time among 
the subjects of the curriculum we have nothing but prac... - 
to guide us. From a study of the time schedules of sixty

An examination of average practice reveals conditions 
that are far from satisfying. For example, the opening exer- 
cises, the recesses, and the varied activities grouped under 
“Miscellaneous” suggest a lack of wise organization and 
use of about a sixth of the school week. Again, the time 
given to literature should be increased. The sciences, and 
especially the social sciences, are greatly neglected. On ac- 
connt of apparent defects in practice, competent educators 
weer asked to indicate the ideal distribution of time among 
‘tne usual school subjects. The results are given below for

Thirty-six consolidated schools 
More to the point is the time distribution of thirty-six 
consolidated schools of the State of Minnesota. However, 
it is to be observed here that the order of importance of the 
subjects is practically the same as in the city school. For 
example: !

Special considerations. Given the length of the school 
day and the percentage distribution for subjects, the teacher 
under the conventional classroom organization should work 
out her own program. A few considerations of the time 
factor must be made. The hours of opening and closing 
should be set by the principal, as should the recess periods if 
any recesses are allowed. It is a good idea to hand the 
teachers printed program blanks upon which time allot- 
ments, hours of opening, intermissions, and closing are 
stated. If special teachers are brought in for a few classes, 
it is just as well to specify the hours of their coming on the 
blanks given to the teachers. The length of time given to 
the subjects will vary according to the grade of the classes. 
Pupils in the lower grades will need shorter periods. The 
drill periods should also be shorter in all grades than the ex- 
pression and content periods. 
Attention should be given to the order of the’ subjects. 
In general, it is better to put first in the day those that tax
-P-A-G-E-214
  200 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
the efforts of the pupils most. Subjects requiring activity 
should alternate with those that involve quiet and thought- 
ful study. Thus, literature may follow physical education. 
Subjects that require precision of movement should not fol- 
low activity subjects. It is not a good plan to put drawing, 
writing, and certain forms of manual work after the children 
have been engaged in hard play. Exercise should not be too 
heavy just before and just after the lunch hour. Expression 
subjects are usually better for the end of the day than 
thought subjects. 
Helping the teachers. Although the teachers will be 
given a liberal allowance of freedom in preparing their pro- 
grams, they should not be wholly freed from supervision. 
The younger teachers especially will stand in need of help. 
A poor program may be responsible for discipline troubles; a 
good one is itself an aid in liberating the teacher. With the 
forms and the time schedules in the hands of each teacher, 
and perhaps with a few suggestions concerning the best order 
of subjects given, the teachers should soon have their tenta- 
tive programs ready. ‘Two copies should be prepared; ene 
to be posted in the classroom, the other for the principal’s 
files. At a fixed time — not later, say, than the middle of 
the second week, the programs should be drafted. The 
principal should check over each one to see if the time allow- 
ances are met. He should also note whether uniform inter- 
missions, assemblies, and special teaching periods have been 
cared for. The next thing to do is to note the order snd 
place of the subjects. So far as the older teachers are con- 
cerned, it is about as well to let their programs stand as they 
have planned them, if the fixed requirements aremet. They 
know what plan works best for them. The younger teach- 
ers, however, should be conferred with, and such adjust~ 
ments made as beyond question make their programs the 
best they can be made. Using our standards on page 198, 
we may develop a sixth-grade program, as follows:

The departmentalized program. The duty of making the 
departmentalized program falls almost entirely upon the 
principal’s shoulders. If the matter is left to the teachers, 
they may have to put in more time in its preparation than is 
justified. Some of them may disagree over minor points, 
and the hard feeling engendered expresses itself in the forma- 
tion of school factions. There will be some one who wants 
to dominate the situation, and who has views especially 
about the hours and places she wishes to teach. The more 
timid teacher will be ignored, and will be reduced to taking 
the places on the program left by her more aggressive asso- 
ciates. The writers have known a group of teachers to 
squander a day in making a program which the principal 
could have better prepared in an hour. 
The assignment of rooms and subjects must of necessity 
be made by the principal. In doing this he may consult the 
wishes of the teachers, but the main guidance is what is best
-P-A-G-E-216
202 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
for the school. He may also ask each teacher concerned in 
the department the order in which she wishes to teach her 
subjects. This should be written down under the teacher’s 
name. As a good many compromises will have to be made 
in order to solve the mechanical difficulties of program mak- 
ing, and in order to comply with the principles of alterna- 
tion, best position for each subject, avoidance of conflicts 
with fixed periods, and the like, the teachers should be told 
that it will not be possible to give them exactly what they 
want. With the better teachers, no objection to modifica- 
tions will be registered. 
Equipment needed. A big departmentalized program is 
quite a complicated affair, and much of annoyance will be 
saved if system is used in its preparation. In order to work 
most expeditiously, the principal ‘should provide himself 
with equipment, as follows: 
1. A smooth board, three by six, with eye-hooks so that it may 
be hung upon the wall. 
2. A number of cards of different colors, sizes about two by 
three inches. 
The board should first be ruled off into columns and rows, 
the rectangles which are formed being slightly larger than 
the cards — say an inch. At the upper edge of each rec- 
tangle a little hook should be inserted into the board and the 
cards punched to fit the hooks. A wide column should be 
ruled at the extreme left for the time, or for numbers which 
correspond to the periods.!. At the top of each column 
should be put the number of the room in which the recita- 
tions listed in that particular column are held. In the place 
of the room the name of the teacher may be inserted, the 
room number going down on the card with the subject. If 
1Jt is suggested that two other columns at the left are an advantage. In 
one would be written the capacity of each room, in the other the number of 
pupils in each class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
  
PLANNING THE DAILY PROGRAM 208 
rooms and teaching are both highly specialized, it is better to 
arvange the program on the time-place basis. If teachers 
must handle two departments, or subjects from two or more 
departments, and change about from room to room, the 
time-teacher basis is better. 
After the board is ready, the cards should be prepared. 
The subjects should be written on the cards, with numerals 
or letters indicating the order in which the subject will come. 
There should be a different color for each class. If desired, 
thumb tacks can be used to attach the cards to the board in 
place of the hooks. The latter are a little more convenient. 
The cards will have to be shifted a good many times before 
the program is complete, and the tacks are hard to pull out. 
One of the cards when ready for use looks like the following: 
ENGLISH I 30 pupils 
Room 6 35 seats 
Period 1 
  A second board is often used by principals for building up 
the program for the second term. As the program is tried 
out, cards are inserted on the second board where experience 
shows the subject works best. Alterations are made as the 
first term progresses and new cards are added. By the end 
of the first term the program for the second term is ready. 
The old program is taken down from the first board, and it 
is used again for building up the program for the next term. 
Usually the Saturday program is put down below the regular 
five-day schedule. The completed program is transferred to 
large cards and posted on the bulletin board, in the outer 
   
-P-A-G-E-218
  204 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
office, and at other convenient places, a copy being reserved 
for the principal’s permanent files. In place of the boards, 
some principals prefer to use ruled canvas cloth with little 
pockets to hold the cards. 
The departmental program illustrated. An illustration of 
a typical departmental program is given herewith. The 
subjects are those of the preceding time schedule; the grades 
from the fifth to the eighth inclusive. The distribution of 
time by subjects is not given, this being left for each teacher 
to fill in. Supervised study may be easily arranged for. 
Attendance is taken up by each teacher, and the teachers in 
the home rooms (the first rooms to which the various grades 
go mornings and afternoons) report to the principal. 
The platoon school. The platoon school program is far 
more complicated and conflicts are harder to guard against. 
The first step is to make time allotments as for the other 
type programs, with the total day divided about equally be- 
tween the regular and the special subjects. (See page 198.) 
The classes are then assigned numbers in sequence — one, 
two, thrre, and so on, using cards of different colors for the 
regular and the special subjects. The time is again written 
at the top of the program board, or the periods are numbered 
in order, eight periods being the usual number. Four main 
divisions in the program may then be ruled off by vertical 
lines. s 
At the left side of the program board the numbers of the 
rooms should be written in. In the next column should be 
the names of the teachers, opposite the respective rooms in 
which they are to teach. With the classes of a given grade 
arranged or numbered in the order in which they are to be 
taught, the principal goes to the board. The card numbered 
1 is put in the rectangle below the first period and opposite 
the number of the first room. The same number is also put 
in the second period, if, as has been assumed, each class in

the A school works two periods on the regular subjects, and 
then two periods in the special subjects. The second class is 
treated the same way, the number being put under the third 
and the fourth periods. The cards to the number of eight 
(or as many as there are periods) then present a straight line 
across the program board. The second, third, and fourth 
tiers are then added below the first. When the program is 
finished, the number of the first class should not appear but 
ence in any column. 
In order to illustrate the process, a typical platoon pro- 
gram is given on the opposite page. 
It is to be observed that 24 classes are scheduled on this 
program. ‘This requires twelve regular classrooms (101- 
112). Classes 1 and 2 do no shop, while 3 and 4 are not 
scheduled for science. Two shops (117-118) are required to 
take care of classes 15-24, each reciting separately. Two 
groups are combined in physical education. If auditorium 
exercises are desired, they may be substituted for any of the 
special subjects, or the length of the day may be extended. 
The relation between the class numbers is kept the same 
throughout in making assignments to the special facilities. 
This is of vital importance, for otherwise the program maker 
becomes involved in hopeless conflicts. 
The same process is followed in scheduling a larger number 
of classes. It is better to run through the whole list of sub- 
jects in the regular way. If variations are wanted, such as 
assigning music or science to regular classrooms, or alternat- 
ing subjects, one should wait until the completed program is 
before him. The exceptions are then not hard to take care 
of. Detailed’directions for making the platoon program are 
found in Professor Cubberley’s Principal and His School, 
Chapters VII1 and IX, with a concrete example. Sample 
programs may also be found in the Gary School Survey 
Report, and in many recent building surveys made by the

    208 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
United States Bureau of Education. The survey of Athens, 
Georgia (Bulletin no. 25, 1921) is typical. 
Special problems of the program. A system of alternat- 
ing subjects is desirable in many rural and village schools. 
The classes are often small, there are few teachers, and 
curricular needs are growing. To take care of such a situa- 
tion a plan of alternating subjects may be necessary. To 
illustrate, the fifth and sixth grades may be combined the 
even numbered years in music and the odd numbered years 
inart. The plan works better in the high school, because of 
smaller classes and the lessened importance of grading. 
Thus the junior and senior classes might take one English 
class together the even numbered years (say the senior Eng- 
lish), and another English class together the odd numbered 
years. If preferred, alternation may be by half years. 
English, History, Science, Domestic Science, Shop, Draw- 
ing, Music, are all subjects that one way or another can be 
alternated. 
After the principal has his first program developed, the 
worst of his troubles with program making are over. Fol- 
lowing the suggestions in an earlier paragraph, by the last 
week of school he can have the new program ready. On the 
last day of school or near it, the program for the next year 
should be tried out. The whole program should be run 
through rapidly, if possible after the pupils have been sent 
to their new rooms. As the main purpose is to find out if 
the program works or not, it will almost be necessary that the 
promotions take place first. The practice is also good for 
the children, as they come into school in the autumn know- 
ing where they belong. If the program is found not to work 
smoothly, it may be amended before the opening of the new 
year. 
Once established, the principal will refrain from making 
many changes. The school runs easier if the pupils are
-P-A-G-E-223
  PLANNING THE DAILY PROGRAM 209 
trained in routine. This is not possible if the prograin is 
being shifted back and forth every day or so. The pupils 
complain, and the teachers lose confidence in the principal. 
The cut-and-fit method seldom produces workable condi- 
tions anywhere. If conflicts occur, as they are apt to do, the 
principal can take care of them without disrupting the entire 
schedule. One of the purposes of his early planning, his 
careful grading, and his skillful laying out of the progtan is 
to cut down conflicts to the minimum. 
The spiral program. Some principals liké to give each 
subject the advantage of the most favorable time of the day 
for recitation. In order to accomplish this purpose, they 
plan a spiral program. It is arranged in six cycles, of five 
days each. Under program one, the classes recite in their 
respective rooms without change. At the opening of the 
‘second week, program two is taken up. It differs from pro- 
gram one in that every class has moved up one period, except 
the classes that recited the first period under program one. 
All of these have gone to the last period. At the close of six 
weeks, the cycles would have been completed. The fore- 
noon program is ordinarily administered independently of 
the afternoon program, so that the subjects vary simply 
from hour to hour of the half day. A forenoon subject re- 
mains a forenoon subject, but is shifted gradually from the 
last of the period to the first. Those who have tried it out 
say that teachers and children soon become accustomed to 
it, and that it is more satisfactory than the fixed program. 
Supervised study. There is some disposition to question 
the value of the supervised study plan. However, there 
seems to be no inherent defects in the idea, but such criti- 
cisms as have been directed against it are due to poor ad- 
ministration. Pupils must, or at least should, study. The 
best place for them to study is at school. They ought to be 
taught how to study. The best opportunity for this is when
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
each teacher directs them in her special subject. Every 
teacher then should be given the responsibility of teaching 
the pupils how to study her subject, and seeing that they do 
study it. This is about all that is meant by supervised 
study. 
The daily program should make provision for study. A 
common method of allotting time has been to make the new 
recitation periods from one and a half to two times as long as 
_ the ordinary periods. Half the period is assigned to recita- 
tion of the cénventional sort, and half to study. Home 
study requirements are done away with, but voluntary home 
study is not discouraged. Principals soon found that many 
teachers abused the supervised study provision. Some of 
them simply extended their lectures or their list of questions 
and topics. Others ended the recitation at the stipulated 
hour, and, while the pupils struggled with their books in the 
usual way, used their free time to keep up their correspond- 
ence or to read the latest novel. : 
The arbitrary division of a period into one half recitation 
and one half study, or similar apportionments, is not recom- 
mended. The needs for either study or recitation will vary 
from day to day, and they will vary with the pupils. The 
best thing to do is to give a generous period — sixty minutes 
in the high school, and an average of forty minutes in the 
grades — and then try, by training the teachers and by in- 
spection, to get the teachers to solve their own problems. 
It seems pretty safe to say that if we co not schedule the 
pupils’ study time, they will not study. It is also true that 
unless teachers are held responsible for directing the study 
efforts of pupils, they may neglect them altogether. 
Administering the program. One significant point in the 
administration of the program has been mentioned. ‘This is 
to the effect that it should be made habitual. Another is as 
important. The program should be carried out with as few
-P-A-G-E-225
  PLANNING THE DAILY PROGRAM 211 
interruptions as possible. Some principals take a week to 
get the school under way, and they take as long to bring it 
toaclose. The approach of a holiday will serve to upset the 
whole schedule for days. Incidental activities are allowed 
to come in frequently. The time lost by such means is con- 
siderable, the loss to the children because of the distractions 
makes the total loss greater. 
Not the least of the disturbing influences is the formal 
examination. At regular periods, varying from every four 
weeks to every eight weeks, these are suffered to break into 
the routine of the school. Learning is suspended in the 
interests of accounting. Probably the best all-around plan 
is to have no regular time for testing, leaving it to the 
teachers to check up on their work as they see fit. No more 
than a period in any week should be permitted for testing in 
any one subject. No regular schedule of two or three days’ 
examination should be permitted at any time. They are 
treated in the same way as study — as a regular part of pro- 
gram routine and not as privileged. An allotment of time 
for literature, for example, would cover all of the time de- 
voted to it — study, recitation, and examination. 
Summary. The purpose of the daily program is to dis- 
tribute the effort of pupils and teachers so that the best 
results will be obtained. The principal’s function in pro- 
gram making will vary with the type of school. In the class- 
room type, the teachers can perform the task with little help. 
In the departmental school and in the platoon type, the pro- 
grams must be prepared by the principal. The first thing to 
do is to make suitable time allotments, and determine the 
best order of subjects. The next is the preparation of cer- 
tain devices, of which a program board and class cards are 
most important. The third step is to arrange the cards on 
the board in proper order, taking care that the same classes, 
teachers, or rooms are not scheduled more than once in a
-P-A-G-E-226
  
212 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
given period. Finally, the whole time of the pupil should be 
scheduled — recitation, study, and examination. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. Show the importance of a well-made program in making for school 
efficiency. 
%. Point out how a poorly prepared program may actually result in 
problems of discipline. 
3 What advantages does the consolidated school enjoy over the typical 
city school when it comes to the making of a daily program? What 
disadvantages? 
4. What type of situation in respect to programming is most common in 
coasolidated schools? 
5. Why is it advisable for the principal to require that teachers’ programs 
be prepared with reference to established time allotments? 
6. Comment upon the time schedule worked out through using the 
judgment of experienced principals and superintendents. Contrast it 
with the practice in sixty typical American cities. 
'% Does it make any particular difference what hour of the school day a 
subject comes? Under the departmental plan, is it possible to teach 
all the more difficult subjects in the forenoon? 
8. What effect has supervised study had upon the school program? Is it 
the rule for the recitation to precede or follow the study under the 
supervised study plan? 
9. Draw up a program blank for use in a school organized on the ordinary 
classroom basis. 
10. Explain why the principal must take the lead in the preparation of the 
, program in the departmentalized school. 
11. Show how the subjects taught in the fifth grade should be listed 
preparatory to making a platoon program. 
12. What further step is necessary in working out the platoon program on 
page 207 in order that the teacher may know the order in which her 
subjects come? Is it important for the principal to concern himself 
ever this point, or should it be left to the teacher?

CHAPTER XII 
ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 
Meaning of special instruction. When school subjects are 
mentioned, it is usually the conventional ones that are 
meant. This includes the three R’s, the subjects associated 
with the theory of mental discipline, and the college entrance 
stand-by’s. There is another group of subjects, not as yet 
so well established but beginning to receive recognition. 
Because of their newness, because they are not fully ac- 
cepted in the general run of rural schools, and because they 
offer distinct problems of organization and instruction, they 
are called special subjects. 
Two groups of these subjects will be discussed here. 
First is the arts group, of which music and graphic arts will 
be taken as examples. Second, comes the industrial subjects, 
named this not because they lead to industrial skill with the 
completion of a course or two, but because, either remotely 
or immediately, their main justification is the contribution 
they make to the pupil’s vocational knowledge and skill, and 
to his appreciation of vocational values. In a broad sense of 
the term we might discuss any school subject under such a 
definition. Reading, spelling, arithmetic, and writing all 
have direct vocational values. For our purpose we shall re- 
strict the meaning of the term to commercial subjects, shop 
courses, agriculture, and the home-making studies. 
Need of the arts in rural communities. The need of in- 
struction in art and music is seldom disputed. The subjects 
are universal in their appeal to the interests and to the ap- 
preciative elements in the lives of all people. In either city 
or country, and with people progressive or static, these arts 
have ever been known as forces making life fuller and richer 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 215 
and more enjoyable. Pronounced interests may be discov- 
ered through them, and it has needed the better instruction 
of the centralized school to bring this out. The old hit-and- 
miss method of teaching music, with its rote singing taught 
by a teacher without special preparation, has been an almost 
useless exercise in ‘the musical development of children. 
The same remark may be passed upon much art teaching. 
As often taught, it has been with the disciplinary or cultural 
aims in mind, and by teachers overburdened by what the 
parents looked upon as the real work of the school. Art then 
became at the best busy work lending a little colorful variety 
to the drab of formal recitations. 
Another reason for emphasis upon music and art grows 
out of the very community shortage in these fields. City 
communities offer advantages in these subjects almost en- 
tirely lacking in village and rural areas. Their buildings are 
many of them marvels of architecture. Their museums 
house examples of all the art contributions of the ages. 
Good music in the churches and the concert halls is acces- 
sible to those who want it. In the schools, courses in the 
two branches are well planned, taught by experienced teach- 
ers, and afford a wide opportunity for those with special 
abilities to develop their talents. The public furnishes 
‘musical instruments, and even individual instruction. In 
contrast the offerings of typical small communities seem 
very meager and inferior. 
Practical values. Practical values are not lacking. Asan 
evidence of what art instruction can be made to contribute, 
consider this statement by McCracken and Lamb: 
Art is everywhere evident in the production of clothing. It first 
appears in the design used in the weaving or printing of the textile. 
It is seen again in the finished product put out by the tailor, dress- 
maker, and milliner. The working out of a design for an outfit of 
school clothing would make an excellent art problem. This would 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  216 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION »° 
include the selection of suitable material, proper color combina- 
tions, and the designing of the style of the garments. A second use 
of art occurs in the making of posters and in the planning of draw- 
ings for advertising purposes. A third phase, that of window 
decoration, is also advertising. 
The practical values of music have been well stated by the 
sub-committee on music of the National Commission on the 
Reorganization of Secondary Education. This committee 
states: 
Music has great value as a high-school subject from the voca- 
tional standpoint. An army of persons are engaged in the musical 
profession in this country, and approximately six hundred million 
dollars are spent annually for musical performances and in musical 
education. This money is going more and more to native-born 
teachers and performers. ‘The number of high-schgol graduates 
who do more or less vocational work in music is quite comparable 
to the number engaged in other occupations. Yet, ample and 
relatively lavish provision is often made by the school authorities 
for other forms of vocational instruction and only meager provi- 
sion, if any, is made for instruction in music, even instruction that 
might be considered prevocational. Music should be recognized 
as an important vocational subject, and reasonable provision for 
vocational training in it should be made by high schools. 
Need of the industrial subjects. The values in the in- 
dustrial subjects may be similarly established. By their 
very definition they embrace content related to life activ- 
ities. They afford concrete experiences whose values can be 
readily comprehended, and form a welcome contrast to the 
ancient and abstract content of the traditional subjects. 
They are cultural in the sense that they comprise within 
them and their related subjects the best of our present 
civilization. Best of all, they are seen by the pupil to be 
related to his intimate needs. His success will depend in no 
small part upon the proficiency and understanding which he 
develops in them, and they thus challenge his best -efforts 
every day.
-P-A-G-E-231
  
ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 217 
The particular types:of industrial training needed in a 
gommunity must be discovered by the school authorities. 
They will be dictated in part by the industries of the com- 
munity; in part also by the interests and aims of the pupils. 
An early survey, such as was suggested for the basis of the 
curriculum, should be made. In addition such a survey 
ought to uncover the facts about after-school employment, 
of which the following may have too many counterparts: 
A survey of Northeastern Minnesota disclosed the fact that 
forty-six per cent of the young people from farm homes were work- 
ing away from home. Twenty-one per cent were working for other 
farmers. Of those who went to the cities, four were bank clerks, 
two chauffeurs, four saloon porters, three carpenters, four clerks, 
three cement layers, one steam engineer, two railway employees, 
one storekeeper, two miners, one sailor, and two teamsters. 
A second study in the Red River Valley of Minnesota showed 
that twenty-six per cent of the sons of farmers were working in 
cities and towns, four were merchants, three sawmill workers, two 
stenographers and accountants, two bank clerks, two carpenters, 
two electricians, two railroad laborers, two unknown, and one each 
of the following: butcher, butter-maker, hotel-keeper, iceman, 
janitor, mail-carrier, and minister. 
Of thirty-three girls leaving the country and entering work in 
cities, eight were doing domestic service, five were stenographers, 
four were nurses, one telephone operator, one waitress, and one 
factory hand.t 
Our earlier figures on occupational choices of students 
were taken at random. At this time we present data show- 
ing the preferences of boys and girls of high-school age who 
have definite farm experience. It is shown not only because 
the data, with all their unreliability, are suggestive, but to 
supply a basis for comparison with materials which the prin- 
cipal will want to gather from his own school. If the aim of 
the school is to help people to do better the worth while

things which they will do anyway, the school administrator 
should know, as early as possible, what boys and girls are 
doing in a vocational way and what they believe they will 
do. 
Adapting data from the New York Rural High School 
Survey, covering around 1700 pupils, we find that they have 
had experiences as follows: 
  Boys Gris, 
General farming 60.6 per cent Household economics 97.0 per cent 
Dairy farming...... 32.5 Other experiences

Types of students. At least we may conclude that a con- 
siderable variety of vocational and special subjects are 
wanted. Although it is less clear what types of courses will 
be in demand, the lines which we have already mapped out 
appear to have a following large enough to justify their in- 
clusion. All or almost all should have music and art; all the 
girls should have home-making; many boys and girls will 
want commercial subjects; and agriculture and shop me- 
chanies will appeal to the interests of the larger number of 
the boys. The offering should be broad enough to give 
every pupil some vocational training before he leaves the 
school. The early beginning of the courses is desirable to 
help out those who will leave school before finishing the 
high school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 219 
The extent of the offering can also be gauged somewhat by 
considering the types of students. For our purpose we have 
distinguished four groups. They are: 
1. Those who are undecided about their future prospects and 
objectives. These pupils should be assigned to special courses 
that in the view of the principal fit in best with their needs 
and aptitudes. 
2. Those who wish to take special subjects as additions to their 
courses. Students planning for college will want home- 
making, commerce, mechanics, and the arts, though they 
may not care to take all the subjects in any one field. In 
other words, they will elect some special subjects. 
8. Those who want to specialize. The vocational motive will 
be uppermost with these, and the courses should be so or- 
ganized and taught as to enable them to get the abilities re- 
quired for making a livelihood. 
4. Those who discontinue school at the end of the compulsory 
period. Continuation opportunities are demanded for this 
group, the special subjects being emphasized and of an in- 
tensely practical character. 
Introducing the special subjects; difficulties encountered. 
It is not expected that all the special subjects can be intro- 
duced at once in any except large schools in the most pro- 
gressive communities. The principal may have to exercise 
all his ingenuity to get a foothold for the subjects at all. A 
variety of situations may exist. The people may be able to 
finance the subjects but may refuse to do so. They may 
simply be conservative. A good many farmers will hold 
that scientific agriculture is nonsense, while the mothers may 
have no confidence in scientific home-making. Both fathers 
and mothers may believe that the way to learn these 
branches is to work at them after school hours and during 
the vacations. Others may have an undue reverence for the 
old subjects. They will hold that the only genuine educa- 
tion is to be obtained from the subjects taught in their owr. 
school days. |
-P-A-G-E-234
  220 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
The principal may therefore often have to be content 
with half a loaf. He will plan his complete program, em- 
bracing the subjects that meet the needs of the groups such 
as we have catalogued, and get so much of the program 
adopted from time to time as he can. It often means put- 
ting up with inferior equipment, and using basement rooms, 
hallways, and attics. It also means poorly prepared teach- 
ers and inferior instruction. The deficiencies are sometimes 
overbalanced by the zeal of the teachers, the interest of the 
pupils, and by the real if tardy recognition accorded by the 
community. 
Introducing the special subjects; methods. Methods of 
bringing in the special subjects may be illustrated by taking 
music. ‘Two or three teachers should be employed who can 
teach the subject. At first it may not be possible to put the 
subject on the schedule. The teachers may begin their 
work through directing assembly singing, taking charge of a 
chorus after school, training orchestras, and preparing short 
musical programs for the school entertainments. As time 
goes on, one or more of them may be relieved from class 
teaching for this special work. The purpose at first is to 
create a demand for the subject by popularizing it among 
the pupils, and then among the parents. Requests for the 
school to furnish music for church, grange meetings, and 
public gatherings of all kinds should be accepted. At the 
end of the year, a school festival that will bring in the best 
features of the new subjects should be given. 
That all this and more can be accomplished in a year has 
been demonstrated scores of times. A very good example 
may be cited from the study of rural school conditions in 
Ohio. The school referred to is the consolidated school of 
Pleasant Township: 
Music is supervised throughout the grades by a teacher without 
additional pay. An orchestra has been organized which will be

ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 221 
“able to furnish music for all school entertainments during the 
coming year. A unique beginning in music was made possible by a 
paper campaign for three weeks before the holidays. The money 
derived therefrom was spent for the purchase of a Victrola. This 
is used in the study of nature, literature, folk dancing, and march- 
ing in and out of the building. A piano was purchased for the 
school, and is used regularly for chapel services every Tuesday and 
Thursday morning. The girls’ glee club uses it the other mornings. 
The first entertainment by the girls was a decided success. ‘The 
boys’ glee club assisted in two numbers. 
Grading instruction. Three types of instruction would in 
time be necessitated, corresponding closely to our previous 
classification. The groups may be combined in some phases 
of the work. ‘The groups with suggested activities are those 
approved by the Committee on the Reorganization of In- 
struction in Music in the Secondary Schools. To illustrate: 
1. The little-interested and non-musical pupils. 
a, Chorus singing. : 
b. Attendance at musical performances — music apprecia- 
tion. 
2. Interested, but not particularly talented pupils. 
a. Chorus singing. 
b. Music appreciation. 
c. Theory of music — elective. 
d. Glee clubs and orchestras. 
8. Talented pupils. 
a. Chorus singing. 
b. Glee clubs and orchestra. 
ce. Music appreciation. 
d. Theory of music — elective. 
e. Applied music (specialized training in vocal or instru- 
mental performance). 
School credit for outside work. The giving of credit for 
outside work has been a common method of supplementing 
the school and of introducing new subjects. If well organ- 
ized, it has many things to commend it. The idea may be 
   
-P-A-G-E-236
  222 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
made to apply to many fields, and there is little reason why 
many outside projects should not be credited by the school. 
The regulations formulated for musical credit are also ap- 
plicable to other types of outside instruction: 
1. Application for credit must be made by parent or guardian, 
and is not valid unless approved by the principal. 
2. At least one lesson a week and one practice or laboratory 
period a week is the minimum for acceptance. 
The outside teacher shall report upon the pupil’s progress at 
such times and upon such points as the principal shall pre- 
scribe. Reports shall cover the number of lessons, the aver- 
age amount of practice per week, the progress made by the 
pupil, a description of the work covered, and a grade on the 
basis used in the school for marking. 
4. A final examination may be set by the school authorities, the 
passing of which is requisite to credit. 38 
Music instruction is often organized as an outside project, 
and supervised exactly as agricultural projects are super- 
vised. As developed in the Ohio schools, the music project 
is organized as follows: 
1. Pupils must have the consent and codperation of parents. 
2. Pupils must be at least ten years of age. 
8. Instruction must be regular, systematic, and by a competent 
teacher. 
4. Practice and study must be regular and efficient, and must not 
interfere with regular school work. 
5. Credit will be granted on the following conditions: 
a. Recommendation of the teacher and the principal. 
b. When time spent upon practice and study is not less than 
the equal of one half hour a day for 250 days in the year if 
the pupil is in the grades, and for not less than one hour a 
day for 250 days if the pupil is in the high school. 
Special teachers. Special instruction may be organized 
on a plan common in the cities. Through the action of the 
county superintendent, or by agreement among principals in 
adjoining schools, traveling teachers are provided. To illus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  
ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION = 223 
trate, a teacher of art may be engaged for five districts or 
schools. She may spend one day a week at each school. 
The number of schools that can be taken care of depends 
upon the distances to be traveled by the teacher, and also 
upon the degree of concentration in the course. If a central 
place can be chosen for the special teacher’s residence so that 
she will be able to reach the outlying schools easily before 
opening, she can then spend the whole school day in teach- 
ing. Half-day teaching periods may be planned if the teacher 
can go from one school to another during the noon hour. 
The program will have to be planned by the special 
teacher and interested principals. The only point, however, 
on which they must decide is the order and time in which the 
special teacher’s efforts will be applied. The special pro- 
grams for each school will be the task of the interested prin- 
cipal and the teacher only. It is quite common to have the | 
teaching in the central school begin or end the week. This 
gives the central school the advantage of having the special 
* teacher’s services the week-end, a consideration of impor- 
tance. On this account a cycle plan is often preferred. 
The first week, the schools could be taken in 1 to 5 order, 
visiting school 1 on Monday, and so on to 5 on Friday. The 
next week, school 2 would be first on the list with school 1 
visited on Friday. 
The local program. The nature of the local program for 
the special teacher will depend upon what her duties are 
conceived to be. If she is to go into the classrooms and 
instruct the pupils, the classroom programs should be drawn 
up with this knowledge in mind. For example, her program 
may be as follows: 
Forenoon 
9:00- 9:30 First grade 10:30-11:00 Fourth grade 
9:30-10:00 Second grade 11:00-11:30 Fifth grade 
10:00-10:30 Third grade 11:30-12:00 Sixth grade
-P-A-G-E-238
204 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
AFTERNOON 
1:06- 1:30 Seventh and cighth grades 
1:30- 2:30 High school 
2:30— 3:30 Unassigned 
3:30- 4:00 Teacher conferences 
  During the absence of the special teacher, it is assumed 
that the subject will be taught by the regular teachers. In 
order that the coming of the special teacher may not disrupt 
the regular program, the subject should be regularly sched- 
uled at the same period it is taken up by the special teacher. 
‘ Under this arrangement, on days when the regular teacher of 
the first grade taught the subject, she would teach it at nine 
o’clock. She should not be permitted to carry her recitation 
periods in one grade over the time allotted. If thirty min- 
utes is given to the teaching of the subject in the sixth grade, 
the special teacher should do her work within these limits. 
Carrying lessons long overtime is usually a sign of poor man- 
agement or of poor teaching — occasionally of both. 
The principal will not abdicate his authority in favor of 
the special teacher. He is still responsible for the school. 
He will feel free to supervise her teaching and her work as he 
will any other teacher. He should help prepare her sched- 
‘ule, assure her a favorable opportunity in each room, corre- 
late her effort with that of the teachers, and measure the 
results of her work. In order that he may know her aims 
and methods, he should observe her teaching. It is not too 
much to say that half the principal’s time, on the days she 
visits his school, should be given to conference with the 
special teacher and observing her work. In her absence he 
should take note of the success of the teachers in following 
out her ideas, and should give the special teacher the benefit 
of his advice on methods of dealing with pupils and teachers. 
Teaching the teachers. Since the time of the special in- 
structor is at the best too short, she should devote some of it
-P-A-G-E-239
  ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 225 
to coaching the regular teachers. Her classroom work with 
the pupils should be of the best type. She should regard it 
as demonstration teaching. The regular teacher should re- 
main in the room and help in the instruction. If the prin- 
cipal tries to develop the “helping attitude” among his 
teachers, the task of the special teacher will be made much 
easier. At the same time he should see to it that a tempera- 
mental or domineering special teacher should not impose 
upon the regular teachers. 
The teachers’ meeting in which the special teacher takes 
charge is also a useful device for improving the teaching. 
At this time the instructor can put before the teachers the 
aims, methods, and devices she approves. They will havea 
chance to ask questions on matters not clear, or upon which 
they need guidance. Outlines prepared by the instructor 
may form the subject of discussion. Once in a while it is a 
good idea to have one of the regular teachers give a demon- 
stration of her work before the group. Instead of meetings, 
the instructor may arrange for personal conferences with the 
teachers. The principal should generally be present at the 
group conferences; the conferences with the individual teach- 
ers should be carried on by the special instructor alone. 
There is no better chance for the principal to display his 
tact, his broad-mindedness, and his ability to foster codpera- 
tion than in directing the work of the special teacher. 
Departmentalization. With the adoption of the depart- 
mental or the platoon plan the problem of special instruction 
disappears. The special teachers become part of the regular 
teaching force. All the teachers are specialists. With each 
subject an integral part of the school program, the prin- 
cipal’s duty toward each subject and each teacher is the 
same. The teacher of language is as much a specialist as the 
teacher of music. The quality of teaching should be so 
much improved. The principal will then find his chief duty
-P-A-G-E-240
226 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
in dividing the time of the pupil in proper ratio among the 
subjects, and seeing that the over-ambitious do not trespass 
reasonable bounds. The ultimate situation for which he 
should strive is that in which all the teachers are special 
teachers. 
This does not mean that extreme specialization among 
pupils should be encouraged. Artificial walls between de- 
partments should not be built up. On the other hand, the 
principal should try to keep the highest possible amount of 
unification. This means that pupils should register for 
courses and subjects and not in departments. This is again 
the cosmopolitan idea. A small school cannot and should 
not hold the students to the completion of a series of subjects 
that prevents their taking an excursion into other fields. 
To illustrate, suppose a department of art, music, agricul- 
ture, commerce, or home-making is built up. Assume also a 
series of courses in the department. A pupil who registers in 
the department, say of agriculture, should not be debarred 
thereby from taking courses in music, commerce, or in the 
college entrance subjects. 
This is an important feature in the organization of the 
special instruction. If electing agriculture in the consoli- 
dated high school means that the pupil cannot give any of 
his time to other than agriculture, then the function of the 
high school has not been generously conceived. It deprives 
the pupil of the right to explore several fields, divides the 
school into little factions along departmental lines, and 
makes coérdination almost impossible. We stand by the 
proposition that, while there is every reason why the pupil 
should be encouraged to concentrate his effort on a major, 
there should be a fair road for experience outside. 
Facilities for special instruction. Lack of buildings and 
equipment also stand in the way of introducing special sub- 
jects. Visitors have frequently noticed the tendency to
-P-A-G-E-241
  
ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION 227 
furce the new subjects into out-of-the-way corners and space 
unusable for other purposes. Manual training and home 
economics especially have been housed in dark and forbid- 
ding basements, hallways, and attics. Instruction in agri- 
culture has had its birth in portables, and home economics in 
rented, made-over residences. The tendency to use home- 
made equipment in the new subjects is many times more 
general than in the old ones. 
This is not as it should be. Facilities for the special sub- 
jects ought to be furnished in the regular plant and equip- 
ment. With the newer buildings this is being done. The 
older buildings were planned for a different type of curricu- 
lum. When a village is the center of the consolidation, the 
old school building usually is taken over by the new district. 
This means that the principal may have to shift as best he 
can for such special departments as agriculture, shopwork, 
and home-making. If so, he should not despair, but take 
the difficulty of the problem as a measure of his resources 
and of his right to the position. 
There are several courses open. The school may be re- 
organized on a platoon basis, and some space set free by that 
method. A few classes may be sent to the gymnasium or to 
the auditorium. Supervised study may be installed, and the 
room previously used for a general study-hall liberated. A 
portable or so may be purchased at small cost. There may 
be unused space about the building that, with a little re- 
modelling and touching up, will serve the temporary need. 
The basements, garrets, and hallways, while generally even 
poor makeshifts, will do if there is nothing better. Fairly 
habitable quarters are occasionally rentable. A grange hall, 
a church, a residence, or a store may be made into a passable 
school building. ’ 
Much ingenuity has been shown by principals when 
faced with the genuine emergency. Not seldom the solution
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
has taken the direction of the construction of a new building 
by the pupils. Sometimes public-spirited citizens donate 
the money required for materials. The board can some- 
times finance this part upon assurance from the principal 
that labor will be forthcoming free. The construction of a 
gymnasium, an agricultural laboratory, a greenhouse, a 
garage, the benches for a wood-working shop — all of these 
are fine projects for the older pupils. A few illustrations of 
what has been done are given: 
1. A school planned to install a wood-working shop at the open- 
ing of the autumn term. Before the close of the year the 
problem of building benches, tool racks, and cabinets, and the 
remodeling of an old building, was brought before the boys. 
Volunteers were called for to help in the work. Those who 
responded were registered on: special blanks and organized 
into squads. As many reported as could be directed by the 
instructor. An accurate record of the time spent by each 
was kept by a juvenile timekeeper. Credit was given ac- 
cording to the time spent and the quality of work done. 
2. In another school the shop was located in an ill-lighted and 
inadequate basement room. A new shop was designed and 
constructed by the advanced class in wood-working, every- 
thing even to the cement work being done by the boys. 
Getting help from the community. Grounds for garden- 
ing and demonstration-farming are easier to obtain than 
buildings. Tillable lands are usually within close reach of 
the school. In villages, vacant lots can be leased for a 
negligible sum — more for nothing than not. A near-by 
public park may compensate for lack of a forestry tract and 
garden ground. An inventory of community resources that 
may be drawn upon to supplement those of the school shows 
a surprising variety to one who has never inquired into the 
matter. In a small community in which one of the writers 
spent ten years as principal, the following facilities were 
within easy reach of the school building:
-P-A-G-E-243
  ORGANIZING THE SPECIAL INSTRUCTION = 229 * 
1. A public park with grove, flower garden, athletic field, 
bleachers, and aquarium. 
. A codperative creamery. 
. From fifty to seventy-five vacant lots, suitable for gardens 
and demonstration farm plots. 
. A grain warehouse. 
. A flour mill. 
. An orchard. 
. A church with kitchen, sewing-room, playroom, and library. 
. A community library. 
. A dairy. 
10. A cannery. 
11. A stock farm, wr CHIAAS 
This by no means is an unusual showing. Such books as 
Hart’s Educational Resources of Village and Rural Com- 
munities reveals the possibilities. Whether they are capi- 
talized or not rests in the main with the principal. That 
there are even broader opportunities than this brief discus- 
sion suggests is brought out in the chapter which follows, 
and the later chapter on school extension. The theory that 
the school is an institution that can be confined within the 
four walls of a publicly owned building is slowly yielding to 
the concept of the school that directs the education of its 
clients whenever and wherever the best opportunities are 
offered. 
Summary. The subjects lately brought into the curricu- 
lum present a special problem for the principal. THe is con- 
fronted with the problem of getting teachers and facilities 
and with planning the courses. Except in the more fortu- 
nate of the newly-established consolidations, it will be found 
that the approach will have to be gradual. Part-time in- 
struction by teachers engaged for the usual classroom sub- 
jects is a common method of beginning. The next step is to 
obtain special teachers who divide their time among two or 
more schools. The principal in this case has a special task of 
   
-P-A-G-E-244
230 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
coérdinating the work of the special teacher with the work 
of the regular teachers, and to keep up a good spirit of 
cobperation. The final stage is reached when the school is 
departmentalized and the special subjects are given their 
rightful place on the daily program. Temporary expedients 
will have to be relied upon in supplying buildings and equip- 
ment. The ultimate aim is adequate and well-adapted 
rooms and furniture for all the subjects. Many conven- 
iences and advantages may be obtained by utilizing the 
community resources — advantages which otherwise the 
school would always lack. | 
  EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. Make up a list of the special subjects of instruction which one should 
find in the modern consolidated school. Why have these subjects 
been called special? 
2. If permitted to choose between the teaching of one of the special sub- 
jects — music, for example — and a regular subject such as grammar 
or geography, which would you approve? Discuss.

art is even more greatly needed in the typical village school than im 
the city school? 
4. Judging by the occupational experiences and need of rural boys and 
girls, what vocational subjects can be justified? 
5. What differences in emphasis should be made in courses for pupils un- 
decided about their future vocations, those that are definitely decided, 
and those lacking the minimum of preparation but who are already 
at work? 
6. Discuss whether it is better to introduce a new subject, even if facili- 
ties are inferior and well-prepared teachers unavailable, or wait until 
good buildings and competent teachers can be obtained.

  CHAPTER XIII 
ORGANIZING THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The objectives. In the preceding chapter the general or- 
ganization of the special instruction was discussed. The 
special subjects were classified as: (1) esthetic — in which 
the training-for-leisure motive predominated, and (2) the vo- 
cational — in which the life-career motive is of first impor- 
tance. At this time attention will be centered upon some 
of the more specific details of administering and supervis- 
ing vocational education. The fields which are used for 
illustration are those which are growing in favor among 
rural school administrators — commerce, shop mechanics, 
agriculture, and home-making. 
The term vocational implies more than the acquisition of 
trade skills. For the elementary school, a liberal training in 
occupations is favored. As progress from grade to grade is 
made the training becomes more technical, until with the 
last years of high school the focal point of all instruction is a 
single trade or occupational division in which the pupil is 
prepared to earn his living. The trend toward the purely 
vocational is seen in the comparison between the aims of in- 
termediate and junior high schools and the aims of rural 
senior high schools: 
1. Intermediate and junior high-school aims: 
a. Giving an understanding of a wide range of occupations 
in order that the pupil may choose wisely. 
b. Getting knowledge that advances the pupil in culture 
and promotes his appreciation of industrial values. 
ce. Making the conventional subjects more vital through 
connection with concrete life-situations and first-hand 
experiences,

d, Adding to the general efficiency of the pupil through 
some specific training and experience in commerce, shop 
work, agriculture, and home-making. 
Senior high-school aims: 
a. Motivating the required subjects by bringing out their 
practical elements and codrdinating school with life. 
6. Training for a specific trade or occupation in which the 
pupil may reasonably find satisfaction and success. 
c. Comprehending the chief economic problems of the 
average citizen, and developing intelligent attitudes 
towards their solution. 
The local situation. As has been indicated, the basis of 
the principal’s educational plan should be local needs and 
interests. To ascertain these, an early survey should be 
made. As a result, he may expect to find such pertinent 
facts as are summarized below: 
1. wm 09 2 oY Some determined opposition to vocational education. This 
will come from the conservatives who stand out for plenty of 
grammar, arithmetic, four-syllabled words in spelling, Latin, 
trigonometry, and structural botany. They favor educa- 
tion that has for long been associated as proper for ladies 
and gentlemen. The only way to convince them there is any 
culture in practical training is by demonstration. 
. A lack of interest on the part of young people. 
. A dearth of local opportunities in commerce and mechanics. 
. A fairly large number of pupils looking forward to clerical 
occupations that will take them into the cities. There will be 
more girls than boys in this group. 
. A relatively large number of boys who have had agricultural 
experience and who are desirous of following farming as a life 
work. In purely agricultural communities ninety per cent of 
the boys may be found in this group. 
. As large a proportion of the girls who will become home- 
makers. 
A few pupils who will find their bread-and-butter occupation 
in the mechanical industries. Boys in agriculture should 
have a good foundational knowledge of farm mechanics. A 
_ small amount of training that will enable the individual te

make minor repairs on lighting and plumbing fixtures, care for 
automobiles, and do elementary woodwork and carpentry is a 
good thing for all the pupils. 
Courses to be offered. Should our assumption concern- 
ing objectives of the type of courses in demand prove cor- 
rect, the principal will feel justified in planning industrial 
courses as follows: 
1. Commerce. 
a. For students who do not want to find a career in the field, 
but who want courses that will help them in their chosen 
occupations. A pupil who expects to go to college will 
find it to his advantage to be able to use a typewriter 
well. A farmer should know the elements of book- 
keeping. 
b. For students who want to follow some line of commercial 
work for a living. 
@. Mechanics. 
a. As a supplement to other fields, such as agriculture, and 
to satisfy the wishes of pupils who want to try them- 
selves out. 
b. For students who want definite vocational training that 
will equip them for skilled labor. 
8. Agriculture. 
a. To satisfy the requirements of the vocation. 
4. Home-making. 
a. For students who expect to go to college, or who have 
special interests. May also include those who have 
temporary needs, 
b. Vocational. ,    
      
     
      
        
        The commercial branches. The commercial branches 
are already so well organized that few suggestions concern- 
ing them are necessary. In the larger schools two cycles 
should be recognized. In the smaller school, a plan of alter- 
nation may be arranged that will care for the varying in: 
terests. For the first group (the larger schools) the - offerings 
may be as follows:
-P-A-G-E-250
  236 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
1. The junior cycle (Grades 7, 8, 9). 
a. For pupils who wish to explore the subjects. 
6. For pupils who want to become proficient in a subject or 
so because of the help it may be to them in their future 
work, but who do not expect to specialize in commerce. 
ce. For pupils who cannot remain in school until graduation, 
and who want special training for life-work. 
2. Senior cycle (Grades 10, 11, 12). 
a. For pupils who want supplementary training only. 
6. For pupils who want to specialize, but who can remain in 
school until graduation. 
To care for the same types of pupils in the small high 
school by alternation, the schedule below may be adopted: 
1. Even years. 
a. Seventh, eighth, and ninth grades take bookkeeping in 
one section. 
b. Tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades take stenography 
and typewriting. 
2. Odd years. 
a. Seventh, eighth, and ninth grades take stenography and 
typewriting in one section. 
b. Tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades take bookkeeping. 
Courses and equipment. The courses offered will depend 
upon the demand as well as upon the size of the school. As 
the type of position which a high-school graduate is prepared 
to take is not of a high order, the maximum number of sub- 
jects should not go beyond ordinary vocational needs. It is 
better to take two or three standard fields and teach them 
systematically and thoroughly than to add frills and furbe- 
lows. ‘Two curricula each of two years are outlined below:

If possible the subjects commonly associated with busi- 
ness training should be taught in classes open to all the 
students. Enough drill in arithmetic ought to be given in 
the seventh and eighth grades to make the teaching of the 
so-called commercial arithmetic unnecessary. The same 
may be said of English, including spelling, penmanship, and 
letter writing. With a standard set in these subjects which 
the pupils must meet before going into business courses, a 
great deal of time may be saved. Economics may also be 
taught simply as a general school subject which majors in 
commerce are required to take. 
The equipment, with the exception of the typewriters, is 
simple and inexpensive. Tables made in the school shop 
will do as well as the expensive desks. If a model office is 
fitted up, the cabinets, counters, and tables may also be 
homemade. It is much better, however, to duplicate equip- 
ment used in modern offices where equipment is essentially 
related to the learning process. Other items that are desir- 
able and also useful in much of the school office work are as 
follows: 
. Mimeograph or multigraph. 
. Adding and calculating machines. 
. Dictating machine and dictaphone. 
. Letterpress. 
. Check protector and check writer. 
. Numbering machine. 
. Complete filing and indexing outfit. 
The school bank. The school bank is a valuable adjunct 
to the commercial department. It should be managed by SIO Or Oe 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  238 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
students, under the direction of the commercial teacher. A 
responsible student (he should be under bond) should serve 
as cashier for a half year at least at a period, and should 
train his successor. The bank should be connected with a 
local commercial institution, and its practices should dupli- 
cate the best in the commercial world. Three important 
services may be rendered by the bank — any one enough to 
make it indispensable: 
1. A place of collection and deposit of pupils’ savings, thus en- 
couraging thrift and giving depositors an understanding of 
banking methods. 
2. A field for training and experience for pupils in the commer- 
cial department. 
8. As an agency for handling all school funds. Deposits for 
books and laboratory materials, athletic association funds, 
and all income from entertainments, plays, and other sources 
should be cared for by the bank, and all bills against such 
funds should be paid out through the bank. 
The school store. There is also some advantage in having 
a school store. The financing and management are good 
business projects. The stock should consist of books, 
pencils, pens, ink, tablets, notebooks, crayons, and in fact 
everything used in the school. Second-hand books may be 
sold on the percentage plan. In handling the bank and the 
store the commercial students often organize and elect 
officers. The president takes charge of the management. 
The secretary orders goods, checks invoices, and keeps the 
books. The treasurer attends to the financial matters. 
Here are very practical ways of furnishing business experi- 
ence, and opportunities are not very numerous in rural com- 
munities unless the school makes them in this way. The 
seventy-five or one hundred dollars profit returned by the 
store a year is not sufficient to excite the opposition of local 
merchants. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 239 
Office organization instead of class organization ought to 
be the rule. The relation of employer and employee should 
be set up between the teacher and the pupil. A small initial 
“salary” is arranged for, and increases made as the pupil 
advances. Payments are made every two weeks by means 
of checks on the school bank. Extra pay is allowed for extra 
work. At the end of the semester the accounts are checked 
up and credit awarded according to the earnings, a minimum 
of from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars being 
required. Extra pay may be allowed for performing clerical 
work for the school — filing papers, answering the telephone, 
making out reports, keeping books for the transportation 
department, and acting as the principal’s clerk. 
The school shop. The school shop is also another neces- 
sity. Two types of work are recommended. The first is 
embodied in the general shop in which both boys and girls 
(elective) of the grammar grades are taught the rudiments 
of woodwork, plumbing, sheet metal work, and electrical 
mechanics. One large room should be fitted up for this 
work, and put in charge of one teacher. Separate centers 
about the outside of the room are designated for the respec- 
tive activities, and pupils pass from one to the other in pro- 
gressive order. Repair work as well as construction is 
stressed. 
The project idea is employed. The school supplies ma- 
terials at cost, and it is usually the custom to permit pupils 
to bring their own materials if they so desire. Articles for 
repair are brought from the homes, and the school may also 
find it a good plan to purchase second-hand or discarded ap- 
paratus, machines, and furniture for practice. The con- 
solidated school at Mesa, Arizona, owns a small truck and 
regularly collects donations from the community, running 
all the way from a fanning mill to a gas engine. The con- 
servation idea this develops is in splendid contrast to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  240 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
old-time farm practice of neglect of machinery.and equip- 
ment. 
The unsold projects may be put on exhibit and sold at 
cost. In some schools the larger articles are taken apart and 
the materials put again into the stock room. It is by this 
means possible for the school to break even on materials. 
Accounts should be correctly kept and occasional reports 
rendered. This is itself a good project for a student of the 
commercial department. 
Some system of keeping tab on the tools should also be 
adopted. The practice in some schools is first to equip each 
individual bench with its own set of tools. The general 
tools are put upon a rack at one side of the room, or in a sepa- 
rate room to which the teacher has the key. A tag corre- 
sponding to each tool is hung upon each bench. When a tool 
is checked out to a pupil the corresponding tag from his 
bench is hung upon the rack. The teacher can soon check 
up on tools that are out. In order that the pupils may re- 
turn the tools to the proper place on the rack the form of 
each tool is painted on the rack just back of the place where 
the tool hangs. 
Typical projects. A great change has been taking place in 
the type of pupil projects. Teachers express little concern 
over being logical in making a project course, but much in 
seeing that the projects connect up with the school, the 
home, and the community. The building of a school 
garage, laying school walks, or building laboratory equip- 
ment illustrate school projects. Home projects range from 
furniture making and repairing to the installation of electric 
light plants and the construction of farm buildings. Com- 
munity projects signify class enterprises in working for pri- 
vate individuals, and in observing community constructions 
under way, such as bridges, roads, and elevators. Some typi- 
cal wood projects still found in school shops are as follows:

Advanced shop-work. Unit shops are generally necessary 
in the high school. The general plan of organization is much 
the same as for the upper grades. Wood projects such as 
have been enumerated are suitable. Other types of work 
recommended are automobile mechanics, farm mechanics, 
and electrical work. In small schools it may be necessary to 
dispense with the general shop, or else so build and equip 
it as to divide it into units in which adequate vocational 
preparation may be given. Even then the units would only 
be suitable for sheet metal, plumbing, electrical mechanics, 
and elementary woodwork. Unit shops would be required 
for carpentry and painting, machine shop, concrete, brick 
and stone work, and automobile mechanics. The standards 
of equipment, building, and curriculum prescribed by the 
Federal Board for Vocational Education should in general be 
followed here. Mechanical drawing and blue-print making 
and reading are essential accompaniments of shop courses. 
Vocational agriculture. The teaching of vocational 
agriculture is tending to become universal in consolidated i 
schools. There are good reasons for this. First, there is the 
need, universally testified to by experts, and reinforced by
-P-A-G-E-256
242 
  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
the life purposes of the children. Second, there is present a 
foundation in pupil experience and in school environment 
which makes the training realistic. Third, Federal and 
State aid are available, making it possible to conduct the de- 
partments with small expense to the community and upon a 
higher plane than courses not similarly endowed. The 
Smith-Hughes Act (1917), under which Federal aid is dis- 
tributed, bears upon administration as follows: 
1. 9S The principal of the school is responsible for the administra- 
tion of the department, and for returning such reports as the 
Federal Board of Vocational Education may direct. 
. In putting in the course, the principal is obliged to furnish 
proof of the desirability of its establishment in his district. 
The application should be made to the State department of 
vocational education. Information should cover the number 
of boys enrolled in the grades and the high school, number of 
farm boys in the school, number desiring to enroll for the in- 
struction, assessed valuation of the district, codperative op- 
portunities, building, and equipment. 
Practical as well as theoretical training must be furnished. 
This means at least six months given to field work each year. 
. The courses offered should typify the leading kinds of farm- 
ing in the community. 
. For every dollar of Federal money appropriated the State or 
the district must set aside an equal amount. 
. The State or the local community must furnish adequate 
building and equipment. ‘This usually devolves upon the 
community, which is also to provide for operation and main- 
tenance. 
. No Federal money shall be spent for other than courses that 
fit for actual employment. 
. The schools shall be less than college grade, and adapted to 
pupils fourteen years old and over. 
. Part-time or continuation instruction for young people be- 
tween fourteen and eighteen, who have entered upon employ- 
ment, may be given. 
The school board and the school patrons are generally 
favorably inclined to the installing of Smith-Hughes work,
-P-A-G-E-257
     
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 243 
The usual line of argument for practical education should be 
brought to their attention, with data on the local conditions. 
The State office will send out the director of vocational edu- 
cation to inspect the district and confer with the board. In 
some States, after the State director and the school board 
have approved the department, a vote of the people of the 
district must be taken. 
In an Iowa district, the principal for two years urged the 
school board to put in vocational agriculture and home- 
making. The president of the board was stoutly opposed. 
The principal, knowing the trustee’s partiality for economy, 
dwelt upon the fact that half the teachers’ salaries were paid 
by the Federal Board. Two teachers, therefore, signified 
about twenty-six hundred dollars in aid from outside. 
The trustee as stubbornly held out until the principal proved 
to him that he was actually paying taxes himself to pay the 
State’s half in the districts that had accepted the Federal 
Board’s offer. This was enough to cause him to come out ~ 
for the new departments. 
Teachers. Although requirements in the different 
States vary in minor details, the demands of the Federal 
Board are uniform. Teachers must be graduates of a four- 
year standard college and have taken technical courses in 
agriculture. Preference is given to men and women who 
have been reared on the farm, and who have had practical 
experience. State Boards have the right to certificate ap- 
plicants who fall short of these requirements if they are 
unable to get properly qualified candidates. As graduation 
from a standard college requires the pursuit of literary sub- 
jects as well as scientific and vocational, a teacher with a 
well-rounded education is ensured. Smith-Hughes teachers 
are hired on the twelve months’ basis. 
As has been stated, provision must be made for the 
students to do practical work for half the year. The teacher
-P-A-G-E-258
244 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
must supervise this work. He will be called upon to give 
practical demonstrations in spraying, pruning orchards, 
culling poultry, feeding live stock, stock judging, and seed 
selection. He will have to advise on stock diseases, plant 
pests, animal breeds, fertilizers, farm machinery, farm build- 
ings, and every other conceivable topic. A man should be 
selected who knows his business. He must be grounded in 
theory, but must also know how to do things. No other 
type can make a success and command the respect of the 
farmers and the farm boys. He should be employed by the 
board upon the recommendation of the principal as are 
other teachers, and the principal should know that he is re- 
commending a man who will fulfill the requirements of the 
State Board. 
Rooms and equipment. Building and equipment stand- 
ards are set by State Boards, but must have the approval of 
the Federal Board. Before planning any outlay the prin- 
cipal should obtain the publications of the State and the 
Federal Board on buildings and equipment. In a general 
way he may expect that the district will have to furnish the 
following: 
1. At least ten acres of land in one tract for the school site. 
Half must be free for the use of the agricultural department. 
2. A suitable building, meeting the approval of the State Board 
as to size, number and size of rooms, laboratories, ete. 
8. A barn and other outbuildings needed to house any live stock, 
and machinery kept by the school. 
4, A home for the teacher of agriculture. 
5. Laboratory apparatus of a kind, quality, and total value to 
meet the specifications of the State Board. 
6. Live stock — a dairy cow, hogs, and chickens (often bought 
by principal). 
%. Library. Reference books, bulletins, farm magazines, and 
other materials, well indexed and catalogued in a case in the 
agricultural room.
-P-A-G-E-259
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 245 
That the requirements for building and equipment are 
reasonable may be shown by quoting from the Manual is- 
sued by the State Board in Mississippi: 
There is no specific requirement as to the size of the school 
building nor number of classrooms, but it is expected that the 
building will be adequate to meet the needs of the school. The 
combination classroom and laboratory for the teaching of agricul- 
ture may be an ordinary classroom conveniently equipped for the 
purpose. It should be located preferably on the first or ground 
floor with a convenient exit to outside. It should contain a long 
table, portable seats, an agricultural library, a good cabinet for all 
agricultural laboratory apparatus, and it is desirable to have a 
store room or closet for supplies and illustrative material. Its 
walls should be decorated with interesting and instructive agricul- 
tural pictures and charts, and the room should take on more the 
appearance of a neat work shop than a traditional recitation room. 
The course of study. The Vocational Board specifies that 
the curriculum must be adapted to the community. Any- 
thing like uniformity within the borders of even a single 
State will not be the rule. Great differences in soil, climate, 
and kinds of farming prevail. In a State of one of the writ- 
ers’ acquaintance, areas from east to west and from north to 
south specialize in the following: 
. Wheat-raising. 
. Strawberries and apples. 
. Market gardening and poultry. 
. Dairying. “i 
. Diversified farming. 
. Pears and prunes. 
. Range stock production. NQAXqe wD 
Agricultural instruction must occupy at least one ninety- 
minute period five days in the week through the year. The 
supervised practice periods are of the same length. One 
hour a day often is given to community projects. Other 
subjects are required from the general courses, and these are 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
    246 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
usually unvarying in different schools, being English, history 
and civics, science, and the like. The vocational curriculum 
is uniformly two years, but a four-year course may be and is 
given. The New York Board suggests the subjects given 
below: 
First Year Srconp Year 
Farm mechanics Animal husbandry 
Poultry husbandry Fruit-growing 
Home gardening Dairying 
Turp YEAR Fourta Yrar 
Farm crops Farm management and economics 
Soils and fertilizers Farm engineering and machinery 
Home gardening 
That there are some differences among suggested state 
programs may be seen by comparing the foregoing with the 
Pennsylvania curriculum:

Shop-work Farm animals including dairying 
Soils Fruit-raising

Methods. It is in methods that one finds the greatest 
departure from the conventional school. Production is the 
aim, not scientific investigation. As practice is combined 
with class instruction, the seasonal sequence, not the logical

    VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 247 
sequence, is observed. The old-time teacher of agriculture 
followed the textbook, and on the coldest day in January 
might teach “How to grow strawberries.” Under the 
Smith-Hughes plan, the teacher teaches in the fall the topics 
that are appropriate to the season; in the winter he teaches 
the things that the farmers are immediately concerned with 
and doing. 
Supervised practice is a fundamental requirement. 
Most of this training is accomplished through the home 
project. This may be defined as a farming enterprise 
planned at school or approved by the school and carried out 
on the farm. The codperating farmer provides the equip- 
ment — land, seed, fertilizer, teams, and tools, charging the 
boy 2 reasonable amount for them. A complete record of all 
costs, labor, and processes is kept by the worker. The com- 
pletion of one project is required each year, and should be 
chosen from the field being studied that year, as dairying, 
crop production, stock-raising, poultry-raising, and garden- 
ing. Buying, selling, planting, cultivating, construction, 
bookkeeping, and many other activities are embodied in a 
project. 
More pupils customarily fail to complete their projects 
than fail on class work. A good many of these failures are 
due to a wrong selection. When starting out they are a little 
over-ambitious. Several years of experience in project 
teaching has shown that crop projects lead, poultry projects 
lare second in importance, animal-husbandry third, and 
‘arm-management projects fourth. A few typical projects 
nder each class are as follows: 
1. Farm crops 2. Poultry 
a. Corn a. Chickens 
b. Potatoes b. Ducks 
c. Wheat ce. Turkeys 
d. Gardens d. Pigeons

a. Pigs a. Managing a market garden 
b. Calves b. Managing a dairy herd 
ce. Sheep c. Managing a general farm 
d. Rabbits d. Managing a grain farm 
Records and reports. A separate system of records and 
reports is required by vocational agriculture. Forms pre- 
scribed by the State should be followed, though they may be 
supplemented by forms worked out locally. The minimum 
records are: 
1. A register of names and attendance of all pupils in the de- 
partment. 
2. Permanent records of subjects and grades of all pupils. 
8. Inventory list of books and equipment. 
4. A summary of all outside work done by the teachers, in- 
cluding project supervision with dates. 
5. Pupil-project record — name of project, material, outlay, 
labor, procedure, and results. 
The data for reports are drawn from the records. The 
course of study must be approved, together with any annual 
revisions. As soon as the pupils’ projects have been decided 
upon a list must be sent to the State Board. The summary 
is sent in when the projects are closed up. With the end of 
the fiscal year a statement of pupils, attendance, and grades 
or credit is sent in, and this serves as a basis for computing 
the amount of outside funds due the district. 
Elementary agriculture. Courses in vocational agricul- 
ture and home-making are based upon elementary courses in 
the same subjects in the grades. The principal has the duty 
not only of organizing high-school departments, but of put- 
ting in the preliminary courses in the lower grades. As 
many of the pupils will not go ahead in high school, or, if 
they continue, will choose other departments as major, th 
elementary work should be conducted as efficiently as if i
-P-A-G-E-263
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 249 
were independent and not preparatory. On account of 
pressure of other demands the principal may have to fall 
back upon some of the devices listed in Chapter XVI. The 
Smith-Hughes teachers may be of assistance in organizing 
and supervising the instruction, and in some schools the use 
of vocational students in supervising junior projects is 
recommended. 
Where districts are consolidated for high-school purposes 
only, the county superintendent is responsible for organizing 
the junior work. However, a large amount of codperation is 
required of the vocational departments and of the principals 
in order to make the elementary work succeed. Pennsyl- 
vania and Missouri have developed excellent methods of 
covperating in agricultural training — useful too when both 
the elementary and the high-school work is under the super- 
vision of a principal in a central school. The essential 
points in the plans are enumerated below: 
1. Itinerant teaching by special supervisors in central schools. 
One ninety-minute period a week in each school. Home 
projects required. 
2. Codperative supervision of all vocational courses by the 
county supervisors, agricultural agent, home demonstrator, 
and Smith-Hughes teachers. 
8. County contests, exhibits, fairs, and round-ups arranged 
annually by the county superintendent as a means of pro- 
moting vocational training. 
4. Uniform junior lesson sheets, distributed by the State office. 
5. An annual meeting of all juniors in conference on projects and 
problems. Held during the summer vacation. 
6. Juniors organized into local, district, and county units. 
7. The same kind of project for all members of a local unit is 
recommended. 
8. The Smith-Hughes teachers and the vocational high-school 
students are assigned the duty of supervising junior projects. 
Brief reports to the State Board are required. 
9. Awards for successful workers are suggested, the occasion to 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
       ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
  250 
         be local, district, and county fairs. Buttons and ribbons 
make the most satisfactory prizes. 
10. The codperation of bankers, farmers, breeders, and growers 
associations, and others who are interested, should be enlisted. 
        
   
     Home-making. The organization of the home-making de- 
partment does not differ in any essential particular from the 
agricultural department. On the Smith-Hughes plan, the 
department must be organized independently. Pupils not 
registered in bome-making as a major may not take courses 
in the department. However, students in the department 
are permitted to take academic subjects with the regular 
high-school classes. Regulations concerring the qualifica- 
tions of teachers, building and equipment, size of classes, 
and home projects are in no wise different from those that 
have been enumerated, and will not be repeated here. 
A limitation of the home-making course consists in the 
relatively few who register in the department. There are 
good grounds for urging all high-school girls to take the two- 
years’ course. That they do not do so is traceable to a few 
causes, all of which may be overcome. First there is a feel- 
ing, inherited from the old days of domestic-science teaching, 
that the work does not “get one anywhere.”’ Second, high- 
school girls are so conventional that they cannot unblush- 
ingly face their fellows as “majors in home-making,”’ per- 
haps due to lack of sound guidance by the school. If all 
took the courses, or if pressure were brought to bear upon 
them to cause them to take the courses, this embarrassment 
would disappear. The third and most potent reason is the 
fact that the course monopolizes most of the students’ time 
during the junior and senior years. As the Smith-Hughes 
courses are practical — thus answering the first objection, 
and the second is mainly a matter of wise publicity, we shall 
take up the third only. Methods by which all or nearly; 
ail of the girls may be given home-making courses and at

the same time satisfy other reasonable interests are as fol- 
lows: 
1. Through giving foundational courses in cooking and sewing in 
the seventh and eighth grades, so that these may be dispensed 
with in the high school. 
2. Allowing the better students to take an extra course. 
8. Organizing a junior high school, and dropping some of 
the high-school subjects down into the seventh and eighth 
grades. (May be home-making.) 
. Giving summer vacation courses. 
. Permitting pupils to register in home-making for one year 
only. (This may be contrary to the spirit or letter of the 
State regulations in some States, and therefore not per- 
missible.) 
6. Continuation classes, supervised by Smith-Hughes teachers, 
or organized in the same manner as Smith-Hughes courses. 
7. Prevent other departments, such as home economics, from 
taking all the girls’ time. 
oe 
Coéperative activities. Much can be done in fostering 
eouperative activities. The department may manage the 
school cafeteria and lunch room. Instead of the minute 
portions of food which pupils in the old-time departments 
used to cook, family portions should be prepared. The 
foods may then be sent to the cafeteria for sale or disposed of 
to the pupils to take home. The “reality” added to the 
course has resulted in simpler and less expensive methods of 
preparation, and greater care in the preparation in order 
that there may be no loss. In the United States Bureau of 
Education’s Biennial Survey of Education for 1920-22, the 
work of the department of home economics in a city ele- 
mentary school is described, and the application may be 
made to either elementary or high schools. The author, 
Miss Calvin, says:     
             
   
   
      
     The food classes work on the “quantity basis plan” or “family 
ize” recipes. There are enough members in the faculty alone who 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  "252 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
would be delighted to purchase any preparations, which, under a 
ruling of the board of education must be sold for cost, but we find 
the girls themselves eager to buy, and this is the best connecting 
link that can be formed between the home and the school. You 
might say it is a fine way to advertise in the home. 
When it comes to corn-bread time or scalloped food lessons, or 
pie days there are enough families living within a few blocks of the 
school who plan on the hot dish arriving just in time for lunch. 
Cakes are baked full size, cookies by the dozen. Customers are 
always secured before doing the cooking. The course is never dis- 
arranged to cook for individuals, but the regular outline is followed. 
The money which is received is of course not great, because the 
food is sold at actual cost. Whatever is realized is turned over to 
the clerk, providing the bills exceed those of previous years when 
we cooked under the small-size recipes. If our bills do not run 
over, the money is then used to complete the furnishing of the 
department.     
                                                  
   Health work is closely correlated with the home-making 
departments. This includes the teaching of dietetics and 
nutrition, nursing, and household sanitation. In several 
schools, the department is responsible for feeding the under- 
nourished children, for the hot lunch, for the nutrition in- 
struction of mothers, and for home visiting, during which 
time mothers are taught cooking and nutrition. The home 
making department also does socialized teaching — takes 
over the supervision of parties, puts on “style” shows, holds 
home-making assemblies, organizes home-making clubs, 
exhibits selected articles of food and garments made by the 
pupils, and conducts afternoon and night classes open to 
adults. Courses in “personal adornment” have helped to 
solve the problem of overdressing and the use of cosmetics, 
have improved taste for simple but beautiful clothing, and 
have increased the health, comfort, and happiness thereby. 
The departments universally require the pupils to carry 
over the instruction into the homes.

                            Current tendencies in home-making education may be 
seen from the brief statements given below: 
1. Courses are being built around definite home and community 
needs, discovered through home visits, questionnaires, and 
observations of the pupils. 
2. Sewing work is rapidly being socialized in content and method. 
The unit kitchen is supplanting the earlier “block type.” It 
has been found simpler and less expensive to put the units 
away from the walls, and to do away with partitions. Per- 
haps the term “group type” is a better description than 
“unit.” Four pupils constitute the normal-sized group. 
4, Commercial department requirements are being reduced to 
give the girls some free time for home-making courses. 
5. More “project” work is being done in the school in connection 
with the model apartment, the teachers’ home, the cafeteria, 
the school laundry, and the day nursery. 
6. The advisory committee and the principal are using all the 
means in their power to improve the standing of the depart- 
ment and to interest more girls in it. 
%. The efforts of the departments are being reinforced by strong 
_policies in respect to vocational and educational guidance. ee 
Summary. There is a pronounced tendency toward the 
expansion of vocational education in our rural schools. The 
courses in the grades are general, and in the high school 
technical. The kind of courses offered depends upon local 
needs and interests. Commerce, mechanics, agriculture, 
and home-making are the leading departments. When 
possible, the vocational agriculture, shop-work, and home- 
making should be organized on the Smith-Hughes basis. 
By this means financial aid from the Federal Government, 
and often from the State as well, is granted, and the instruc- 
tion is generally better organized and supervised. A marked 
feature of Smith-Hughes work is its practicality. A large 
element of codperation is required, and it is an important 
duty of the principal to obtain this. He should also encour- 
age pupils to enroll in the departments. The relatively
-P-A-G-E-269
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 255 
small enrollment in vocational departments may be at- 
tributed in no small part to a lack of a strong policy favor- 
able to them, and to an absence of a positive system of voca- 
tional and educational guidance.

  CHAPTER XIV 
PLANNING THE SOCIAL PROGRAM 
A problem of adaptation. Many of the really difficult 
problems of the principal of the village and consolidated 
school are social. He does not have the simple mechanical 
job of fitting one instrument or device into another. His 
concern is not all transportation units, school records, and 
vocational equipment. So much of what is important is 
found on the human side — the adjustment and develop- 
ment of personalities. His sympathy and understanding 
must be generous enough to take in all the human factors in 
the situation — the parents, the teachers, and most of all 
the children — in their almost infinite relationships. The 
wise management of the social program is as much a matter 
of innate character as it is of training. 
The consolidated school presents an unusually compli- 
cated social situation. Diverse personalities and somewhat 
widely separated traditions must be reconciled and adapted 
to each other. Here are the children of the town, here the 
children of the country. Between the two there has been 
from immemorial time a deep-seated distrust, if not open 
antagonism. The country tradition is that the towns- 
people are stuck-up and snobbish. They are suspected of 
being idle, profligate, followers of pleasure, and sharpers 
living off of the industry and frugality of the farmer. The 
town-bred children come to think of countrymen as rude, 
boorish, uncultured, and unintelligent; lacking in manners, 
inhospitable, and not above taking a shrewd advantage of 
the men of whom they buy and to whom they sell. The 
ocialization of the disparate interests and attitudes —    
                       
     
                     
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 ‘ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
whatever they may be — and the development of a feeling 
of mutual confidence and brotherliness is the peculiar func- 
tion of the social program. 
An incidental feature of the situation adds to its com- 
plexity. To the country pupils the environment may also 
be new. If the school is located in the town, as it often is, 
they must adjust themselves to a strange building, strange 
teachers, large and noisy groups of children, and a multitude 
of strange and wonderful shops, stores, streets, traffic — and 
people. They are bewildered by the very number of new 
experiences. If their emotions — which the modern writer 
so lucidly describes as “mixed” — were analyzed, at least 
for the first month or so, fear would be found to predominate. 
As their timidity yields before the customary, as their awk- 
ward self-consciousness gives way a point or two before the 
winning sophistication of the town youngsters, they may 
err on the side of over-exuberance — an expression of the 
new-found freedom that approaches license. 
What the school can do. Two things are possible. The 
first is to adopt protective measures that will tide the chil- 
dren over the transition stage from country isolation to 
community integration. The second is the more positive 
and permanent feature. As adjustment is made, the pro- 
tective aspect becomes simply routine in which country and 
city children are indistinguishable. Until an orderly régime 
has been established it will be quite often an anxiety and a 
heavy burden. 
Some slight insight into the import of the problem may be 
stated. One objection frequently urged against consolida- 
tion is to the effect that country boys and girls, “‘naive, 
and unspotted from the world,” will be subjected to all the 
evils which the provincial mind associates with Main Street. 
To the rural alarmist every alley, every business establish- 
ment, every street crossing is beset with special temptation

PLANNING THE SOCIAL PROGRAM 259 
and dangers for the unwary feet of the country child. If the 
children were allowed to roam the streets at will during inter- 
missions, the charge might take on some gravity. A well 
organized and well-supervised social program is the main 
solution. However, restrictive regulations also will be re- 
quired. One cannot afford to neglect a single precaution for 
the safety and well being of children. 
We must not overlook the fact that, owing to the unusual 
opportunity for communication with the town which school 
transportation affords, parents will continually be asking 
the children to go to the stores on errands. Especially will 
they — in areas without rural mail delivery — want them 
to go to the post office. Dishonest boys (one may be found 
occasionally) may “fake” errands in order to get to loaf in 
pool halls, barber shops, garages, and the confectionery, 
where vile stories are often told and opportunity for smoking 
is furnished. Even the girls (tireless lookers-in at windows) 
may wish to parade the streets, or may call in at the drug 
stores to purchase candy and cosmetics. 
The question is, Shall we prohibit the pupils from obtain- 
ing needed articles for their parents? The answer is in the 
negative. When the school organization can minister to the 
community without impairing its own efficiency nor endan- 
gering the children, it should do so. It is possible to regulate 
the privilege of errand-running so as to protect the children 
and secure the service for the parents. The following plan, 
used successfully by one of the writers in a consolidated 
school in Kansas, is given as one means of handling the 
problem: 
1. The bus-drivers were not permitted to discharge their pas- 
sengers at any other place than the school. 
2. No children were permitted to leave the school grounds with- 
out permission — usually attended to by the principal. 
8. Permission to go to the stores was granted only upon bona fide 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
    260 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
requests in writing by parents, stating as specifically as 
possible the nature of the errand. These requests were kept 
on file. 
4. All letters and other matter to be mailed were left with the 
teachers of the respective rooms as soon as the children 
reached school. 
5. A “mail monitor,” appointed by the principal and approved 
by the local postmaster, collected the mail from the teachers, 
took it to the post office, and brought back mail for the 
parents who had sent written requests. The position of 
“mail monitor’’ was one of honor, for which there were many 
applicants. 
6. Mail brought by the monitor to the school was distributed to 
the teachers, and kept by them until dismissal. 
7. Small errands, properly requested and not of such character 
as to require privacy, were also attended to by the monitor. 
His trip was timed so as not to interfere with his school 
work. 
8. If a child who was permitted to go to town on an errand got 
into mischief, he was disqualified from going in the future on 
any pretext whatsoever. 
The need of a positive program. If the duty of the princi- 
pal ended here, it would be a small item in his day’s work. 
This though is merely a beginning. The protective and de- 
velopmental features of socialization are the very heart of 
education. This is true éverywhere. It is nowhere more 
vital than in the rural community, for several very potent 
reasons of which we may name: 
1. The isolation of the country. Not all the homes of the land 
have been enriched by the fruits of modern inventive skill and 
enterprise. In The American Country Girl we find this lack of 
association well stated: 
There are many girls living on remote and lonely farms 
far away from any neighborly environment. To such as 
these the isolation is a very real sorrow. It falls as heavily 
upon the farmer’s daughter as upon the farmer’s wife — 
even more heavily if possible, for she is generally led to 
realize her need at a time when her social instincts are most    
   
-P-A-G-E-275
    
    
                                                                  
    PLANNING THE SOCIAL PROGRAM 261 
insistent... . Over vast expanses of America, the log-cabin 
period still continues. And if the log-cabin is found — or 
the tar-paper shack, or the sod-wall house, or the dug-out 
—then also the dolorous conditions of isolation and 
struggle... are matters of everyday experience. 
2. To supplement the home. This applies to social and recrea- 
tional opportunities. 
8. Preparation for life. Has to do with accustoming children to 
social conventions and the overcoming of awkward bash- 
fulness. 
4. To develop special talents. Vachel Lindsay has said that the 
countryside is “jeweled with talents.” Musical, literary, and 
artistic qualities thrive best in a social atmosphere. 
5. To train in codperation. The country needs people who can 
work together. The old isolation of the farmer has unfitted 
him for the close codperation which modern life demands. 
Many of the failures of cojperative economic associations 
may be traced to the stubborn individualism of men steeped 
in the “go-it-alone”’ philosophy. 
6. To develop personality. This quality, on which influence and 
success, as well as personal happiness, depend, is a product of 
the give-and-take of dynamic social life. 
%. To strengthen school. ‘The weakness of the old school was its 
isolation. A school that trains only in formal subject-matter 
has but little to commend it over the old school. School 
spirit, community pride, scholarship, attendance, and school 
support are products of socialized endeavor. 
8. To provide recreational opportunities. The working bours on 
the farm are long, the recreational opportunities are few. A 
regimen that is all work will never build up well-rounded 
characters. The school can do no higher service than to make 
leisure worth while. 
9. To train for citizenship. As the objective of education, too 
much emphasis cannot be put upon citizenship. It is a com- 
monplace that it is best developed through participative exer- 
cises which give the pupils an understanding of society and 
enable them to lead in its improvement. 
Evidence from investigations. We do not have much 
statistical data on rural social conditions. We have even 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  262 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
less going to prove the value of the new social programs. 
Concerning the first, all the facts and all the opinion paint 
a dark picture. The desire for social advantages, associated 
with the desire for better educational advantages, has been 
a big factor in causing the migration from the farm to the 
city. The associations between the country and the village 
center have been of the business type. Social relations, de- 
scribed as visiting, are frequent among country and town 
dwellers for less than one half the population. With a good 
ten per cent there is no visiting whatsoever. Even less than 
country visitation is the going of town people to the country 
homes, indicating that country hospitality is somewhat of a 
myth. 
Visiting is not a more conspicuous feature of country life. 
Farmers are too busy, and interchanges are mainly among 
kin. Neighbors call upon neighbors when there is sickness, 
but most of them report that their neighborhoods “are not 
neighborly.” The prevailing philosophy is that “short 
visits make long friends.” In a survey of a Texas county it 
was shown that trips to town are most generally due to busi- 
ness reasons, and that the pioneer virtue of neighborliness is 
a thing of the past. The reasons for town trips were dis- 
tributed as follows:

Values found by pupils. The point of view of the pupils is 
always illuminating. The North Central Association of 
Secondary Schools and Colleges has gathered opinions on a 
host of school matters from thousands of pupils. They give 
eloquent testimony of the values of social activities, as seen 
herewith: 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  
PLANNING THE SOCIAL PROGRAM 263 
1. Characteristics of the school which are admired: 
a. School spirit. 
b. A strong athletic program, 
c. Good fellowship. 
d. Sportsmanlike qualities. 
e. Self-government features. 
2. Things which are deplored: 
a. Snobbishness and an undemocratic spirit. 
b. Immorality. 
ce. Lack of team work. 
8. How the school develops personality among the pupils: 
a. Through public speaking. 
b. Student government. 
c. Social functions. 
d. Student activities of a miscellaneous sort. 
e. Athletics. 
4. How the school is helping solve the pupils’ personal problems: 
a. By demanding self-reliance. 
6. Class meetings and social activities. 
Principles guiding the social program. Admitting the 
need and value of a program of social activities, the next 
question turns to its organization. It ought to be based 
upon sound educational principles. These are not new, 
nor are they distinctive in that they belong to rural schools 
alone. Of course some should be weighted more heavily than 
others in order to meet the peculiarities of the communities. 
The following are essential: 
1. The larger part of the pupils’ social activities should be 
directed by the school. 
2. The cost to the individual and to the school should be kept 
down to the minimum. It is no compliment to the manage- 
ment to find that some consolidated schools are paying from 
ten to thirty dollars per pupil per year for activities outside 
of the regular curriculum. 
8. The activities which are approved should have a place on the 
schedule, and be registered for as are the classroom subjects. 
Recognition of some kind — a certificate, pin, or honor points 
— should be given. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  264 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
4. Those activities should be given the preference which are 
likely to continue into adult life. 
5. They should be organized on a democratic basis. Admission 
should be free, and on the choice of the pupil. When entrance 
to a group depends upon election, even when nominations 
are made by teachers, snobbishness generally creeps in and 
cliques and factions result. 
6. The program should represent the free preferences of the 
pupils and the patrons. It should be directed towards the 
fostering of the folk activities, instead of aping what is done in 
some city school. 
7. While satisfying pupil interests, it should not run counter to 
community prejudices. There is no freedom gained in flout- 
ing the conventions of the community, even though they 
seem narrow and petty. When there is so much to be se- 
lected that is approved, why make an issue of any particular 
activity? 
What activities to recommend. One cannot accept these 
principles without having to give some time to picking out 
suitable activities. He cannot rest content with following 
out the past program, or in adopting bodily the program of 
some other school. As in other situations where improve- 
ment is the aim, the changes should be made slowly. If a 
new principal comes in and announces to the pupils that he 
is going to upset their cherished social plans, he is in for 
trouble. If nothing has ever been done, he has an easier 
road to travel. In any case, as soon as possible, he should in- 
form himself on three points. They are: 
1. What the social activities of rural communities are, 
2. What the pupils are most interested in. 
8. What the parents approve. 
Rural social activities. If the principal has made a survey 
of the district he will find the answer to the first question. 
He will not feel that what exists is of necessity what ought to 
be. This knowledge simply marks a starting point. If he 
has a list of activities which have been carried on in rural 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
  
PLANNING THE SOCIAL PROGRAM 265 
communities, it may suggest many desirable ones that are 
lacking in his own. At all events, if he purposes to restore 
to the rural community neglected social activities he must be 
aware of those that have been traditionally preferred. From 
an examination of rural surveys! and of the general litera- 
ture on the subject, we find characteristically rural activi- 
ties as shown below: 
1. Picnics — often patriotic celebrations, reunions, and the like. 
2. Bees — including quiltings, wood-choppings, apple-parings, 
house- and barn-raisings, harvesting, etc. 
8. Literaries — comprise debates, spelling matches, lectures, and 
readings. 
4, Exhibitions — fairs, stock shows, and school entertainments, 
5. Dramatics — plays, pageants, and festivals. 
6. Musicals — community singing, orchestras, bands, and musice 
festivals. 
7. Clubs and societies — varied activities. 
8. Athletics, plays, and games. 
9. Recreational reading. 
10. Sports — hunting, fishing. 
11. Dances and parties. 
Pupils’ interests. The interests of adults are not neces- 
sarily the interests of pupils; if they were, it would be ad- 
ministratively impossible to carry on many of these activ- 
ities in the school. The principal should, therefore, try to 
discover the pupils’ interests as soon as possible. In a way, 
what he should do is equivalent to taking a referendum on 
1Jn a survey of three Iowa townships, made by Paul S. Peirce, the per- 
centage of the adult population engaging in and attending various social 
and recreational activities was as follows:

    266 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
social activities. If he does not, he will find that a few ag- 
gressive pupils force their own interests on the pupils, or that 
school tradition — it may be college tradition — dominates. 
A teacher coming in from a college, where the students travel 
in a circle from football in the fall to track and baseball in 
the spring, is not likely to bring in many original ideas. 
There is something pathetic in the spectacle of pupils who 
have an inclination for social games, music, or marbles, being 
forced by public opinion to chase an inflated pig-skin. Phys- 
ical activity within reason is advantageous, but it must be 
an odd kind of mind that can reconcile recreation and social 
pleasure in anything that is forced. 
At the opening of the year, then, the principal should set 
himself to find out what the pupils really want in the way of 
a social program. ‘To make this investigation, he should 
list on the board or mimeograph a large number of common 
activities. The pupils should be asked to indicate their 
interests in these, on two scales: (1) their interests as a par- 
ticipant, and (2) their interests as a spectator or audience. 
The study may be made by a pupil committee, which would 
also tabulate the results. A suggested form which one may 
use is shown herewith:

Parents’ preferences. After the pupils’ interests have 
been determined, activities on which there may be a division 
of opinion among the parents should be submitted to a 
public referendum. The Parent-Teacher Association is the 
logical place to bring this matter up. Activities that are 
clearly taboo should be dropped from the school program. 
Dancing is especially likely to be a mooted pastime. Ina 
school where the principal had permitted dancing a strong 
protest to his action was registered by the churches. He
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
called a conference of the parents to discuss the subject. 
The consensus of opinion being registered against the 
dance, it was decided to give it up. 
At the suggestion of the principal it was decided to inves- 
tigate the dances given in the community. It was found 
that when the school no longer gave dances the young 
people patronized the public affairs, often driving thirty or 
forty miles to a town. Deplorable conditions were found to 
exist. Drinking was all too common, and rowdyism was the 
rule. Fights between town boys and country boys, between 
local gangs, and between the rival champions were frequent. 
Parties of high-school pupils were to be found nearly every 
week-end at a dance hall of none too savory repute. When 
these facts were revealed the parents requested the school 
authorities to take over the management of social affairs at 
the school, and dancing was again permitted. This is an 
excellent illustration of the service the school can perform in 
helping the pupils ‘“‘to do better what they would do any- 
way,” although it is not assumed that dancing will always be 
the issue.! 
Definite planning. When the activities are agreed upon 
the next step is to put them into the working schedule. 
Pupils should be required to register for activities in the 
1 Much depends on the community. Only a few years ago a large western 
city went to the extreme of puritanism by putting the ban upon folk- 
dancing in the schools. In some communities everybody dances, and the 
schoolhouse is thought to be the proper place for the function. On the 
whole, rural people are not given to dancing. A person who has ever done 
fourteen hours of hard manual labor a day knows one of the main reasons. 
Most oppose dancing as immoral. Peirce (Paul S. Peirce: Social Surveys 
of Three Rural Townships in Iowa. University of Iowa Monographs, 
Iowa City, pp. 86-87, 1917), says: 
“Dances are practically a negligible quantity in the community. In but 
few families do any of the members dance. No dances occur in the town- 
ship itself. Young people in one family attend high-school dances at the 
county seat. A considerable proportion of the population frown upon 
dancing as immoral, and their influence seems to dominate.”

same way they register for subjects. This is not for the pur- 
pose of preventing the satisfaction of legitimate interests, 
but to keep certain pupils of non-scholastic tendencies from 
overdoing it. In a California investigation by Alice De- 
ment, it was found that many high-school students are really 
social specialists, participating in as many as seven activi- 
ties. It would be well to place a minimum of two activities 
for each pupil, and a maximum of three or four. Free elec- 
tion should be permitted. There should be no closed organ- 
izations. Although ability may determine whether a person 
makes a team or not, lack of it should not debar a pupil 
from participation. A person who wants to try out in the 
glee club, the orchestra, the school paper, or the dramatic 
league should be given his chance, not once but repeatedly. 
Other factors of importance are: 
1. A general organization of all the pupils, with constitution, 
rules and regulations, and student officers. This association 
should comprise the entire school membership. No one 
should be kept from membership because of inability or re- 
fusal to pay dues — in fact it is better to charge no dues at all. 
2. Subordinate organizations, such as classes, athletic leagues, 
welfare societies, drama leagues, literaries, and department 
clubs — such as science, history, English, and nature — are 
illustrative. 
8. The finances of the associations should be supervised by the 
principal, or by some one appointed for the purpose. The 
supervision includes the approval of budgets, the inspection 
of accounts, and the publication of receipts and expenditures, 
. 4, No new club or activity should be launched without the ap- 
proval of the principal. 
5. Secret and closed organizations should be prohibited. 
6. A record should be kept of every pupil’s participation, and 
some recognition for it should be given. The permanent 
school record card may have a space left on it for this record. 
%. Pupils should not be permitted to participate in strenuous 
games until they have been certified as physically sound by 
the school physician, nor in athletic contests without the 
_sanction of their parents. ,  
-P-A-G-E-284

8. The principal should not promulgate rules and restrictions, 
but should train the pupils to legislate for themselves. Thus 
a principal who announces that any one who smokes will be 
put off the football team is less likely to succeed in eliminating 
tobacco than the principal who leads the association to adopt 
such a restriction. 
9. Socializing exercises — assemblies, rallies, school projects, 
and socialized recitations — should be encouraged. 
10. The social exercises should be programmed as are the school 
subjects. As the busses cannot be detained long in the after- 
noon for older pupils who may want to practice for basket- 
ball, the play, or debating, they will have to be arranged for 
on the time schedule. To avoid conflicts, a rough attempt at 
grading may have to be attempted. 
The school paper. No school is so small that it should not 
have a school paper. In a rural community it is the best 
device there is for informing the people on school affairs. In 
other words, it may be made a community paper. Even if 
there is a local newspaper the school paper is almost a neces- 
sity. The circulation of the newspaper is limited, the pol- 
icy is such as the editor chooses it to be — it may be against 
the school —and the sense of proprietorship which the 
school paper enhances is wholly lacking. As a news me- 
dium the school paper may be the superior of the local 
paper. As a means of improving English, there is nothing 
superior. 
A printing plant is a desirable but unnecessary element. 
If there is none, the only equipment required is a typewriter 
‘and a mimeograph. If the school, furnishes supplies in the 
way of notebooks, tablets, and penmanship pads, there is no 
reason why it should not furnish mimeograph paper. How- 
ever, the paper may be easily financed outside. The cost of 
a weekly or semi-monthly issue is small and can be paid for 
by subscription. It is a good thing to finance it in this way, 
and thus do away with the soliciting of advertising. A

teacher should supervise the editorial staff, and nothing 
should be inserted until it has his OK. Contributions 
should be sought from all the pupils, and the staff should be 
changed often enough to give every one who cares for the 
experience a chance at reportorial work. The contents 
should be well chosen, and of considerable variety. An 
examination of typical consolidated school papers reveals 
the following contents: 
Community and school personals, 
State, national, and world news. 
Editorials. 
Humor. « 
Literary — stories, verse, essays. 
Scientific items. 
Cartoons, charts, and pictures. 
Bus schedules. 
The school program. 
Announcements of entertainments, contests, other school events. 
Athletics. 
School improvements. 
Community center and parent-teacher programs. 
Feature articles. 
List of school visitors. 
Reports of lectures. 
List of pupils neither absent nor tardy, honor rolls, ete. 
The weekly newspaper is tending to supersede the school 
annual in the consolidated schools. The annual is expen- 
sive — the issue of 1924 in a small California school cost 
$750 — and its value as a publicity and socializing instru- 
ment is nil. In some schools the final issue of the paper 
answers the historical purpose of the annual by printing a 
summary of the year’s events. The school also agrees to 
bind the weekly issues for the pupils free of cost, if the 
numbers are turned in at the end of the year. 
Juvenile clubs. Special emphasis ought also be placed 
upon the organization of young people’s clubs. If a little
-P-A-G-E-286
  272 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
care is used in employing teachers, one can get persons 
qualified to direct Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, Girl Re- 
serves, Girl Scouts, and similar organizations. Their serv- 
ices should be capitalized for school purposes by putting 
such groups in charge of playgrounds, drives, traffic in halls, 
messenger service, helping pupils who are back in their 
work, guides for visitors, ushers at school entertainments, 
and in serving refreshments at picnics or other gatherings. 
As the school is unified, organizations should be planned 
which help to unite the pupils with the older people of the 
community. The young men who have completed school 
may be kept in touch with it through leadership in the Boy 
Scouts. The older brother and older sister idea may be ap- 
plied to pupils in the school. Musical associations may 
admit outside members. ‘The history club may affiliate 
with the pioneers’ association, or, if there is none, invite 
older people to join in a local history association. Young 
married couples may be “adopted” by the classes, chaper- 
oning their activities, and in general sponsoring their affairs. 
Recreational reading should also be promoted. A reading 
club is one of the most worth-while organizations to form. 
A library hour should be arranged on the school program for 
those who want to take advantage of it. They may be con- 
sulted in ordering books, and may help in the library. If 
there is a literary club among the women of the community, 
an affiliation may be desirable. In one school, the whole 
duty of library promotion was taken over by the reading 
club. Book lists were prepared, they took charge of com- 
munity loan-shelf, books were exhibited every week in the 
down-town drug store, and at least twice a year the women’s 
literary club was entertained at the school. One of the 
greatest values from this club grew out of the fact that it did 
not disband during the summer vacation, but was active 
twelve months of the year. What books may come to

signify in the lives of farm Falls is well shown in the following 
delightful little sonnet, by Helen Coale Crew: 
_ THE EVENING HOUR 
The day is done; the clock is striking eight; 
The children now are snug and safe abed; 
Still on the pillow lies each little head, 
Tired out, although they begged to sit up late. 
I cover the fire within the kitchen grate, 
Mix up a light sponge for the morrow’s bread, 
Wind up the faithful clock; with quiet tread 
Depart, and leave my kitchen to its fate. 
The study calls me to my favorite nook 
Beside the table, underneath the light. 
Here shall I joy me with a gracious book 
Until at last I bid my world good-night. 
O peaceful dreams beneath the homestead roof! 
Ye straighten out life’s tangled warp and woof!

school appetite is surfeited. If there is a dearth at all in the 
high school it is among the freshmen, whom the upper class- 
men treat as little barbarians lacking in the rudiments of 
interest in music, literature, and social conventions. Again, 
the whole energy of the school may be focused on athletics. ° 
Whatever the claims of football and basket-ball, they 
should not, in the face of such returns as we quoted on page 
267, monopolize the program. The cravings of the pupils 
are infinite; individual differences are so great that not all 
can be satisfied with the same provender. In the judg- 
ment of the writers a proper weighting to give to activities is 
as follows:

Summary. The consolidated school has the task of social- 
izing the pupils. As groups somewhat opposed to each 
other, and at least quite widely apart may be represented in 
the school, the undertaking is not an easy one. There are 
two things to be done. The first is to take precautions to 
protect the children from bad influences. The second is to 
give them such codperative training as will tend to unite 
them. The preferences of pupils and parents should be con- 
sulted in making up the social curriculum. Instead of im- 
porting alien activities, the schoo] should do everything it 
can to foster the best of the traditional social affairs of the 
country. Music, games, social affairs, reading, dramatics, 
and clubs seem to be best worth keeping. While selecting 
those activities which a community approves, a means CHAD WOE

should also be found for keeping the school and the com- 
munity in contact through them. Finally, the time allotted 
to the activities should be distributed according to the value 
and interest in them.

  CHAPTER XV 
THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 
Signi‘icance of the problem. There is no way to evade the 
school-lunch problem. School children must eat at some 
time and some place during the day. In the consolidated 
district the place is usually the school, the time the noon 
hour. The number taking lunch at school varies with the 
distance the school is from their homes. It is safe to say 
that all the pupils transported spend the noon hour at 
school, together with all pupils who live more than a half- 
mile from the schoolhouse. Of these who are comparatively 
near, many prefer to take their lunches, and during bad 
weather the number increases. The principal of a consoli- 
dated school need not be surprised at having three fourths of 
the attendance on the school premises the whole day. In 
open-country consolidations, the whole school population 
will be present. Most of the children have breakfast early; 
most of them do not reach home until five o’clock. As the 
responsibility of the school extends to every element of child 
welfare, it naturally cannot overlook so important a matter 
as the noon lunch. 
There are three important reasons for giving attention to 
the problem. First is the vital matter of the health of the 
pupils. It is absurd to attempt to teach physiology, the 
rules of health, or to practice calisthenics when neglecting 
the most important phase of physical efficiency and develop- 
ment, namely, nutrition. The second reason is that of edu- 
cation itself. The lunch hour offers an unparalleled oppor- 
tunity to give social, economic, and physical training, and 
that by the most effective method — practice. For a prin-
-P-A-G-E-292
  278 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
cipal to fail to capitalize the period would indeed brand him 
as inefficient. Third, there is the less important feature of 
convenience. It may be that more practicable methods of 
handling the lunch problem can be adopted than that which 
was inherited from the obsolete one-room schools. If so, it 
should be unhesitatingly adopted. 
Values of lunch supervision. Two purposes have been 
served by school-lunch supervision. First, home lunches 
have been improved, either by the school serving a dish or so 
of food supplementary to the home lunch, or by giving such 
help and instruction to the parents as resulted in the prepa- 
ration of a better lunch. Often the improvement has taken 
both directions. This satisfies the health and the educa- 
tional objectives. The second result has been that many 
pupils have ceased bringing lunches from home altogether, 
depending upon food served by the school. Health, educa- 
tion, and convenience have dictated the second method. 
Improvement and convenience have been the aims achieved. 
More specific values are claimed. Malnutrition has 
tended to disappear with school feeding. It is only with 
some difficulty that country people can be convinced that 
their children are undernourished. Whatever the reliability 
of statistics, those we have show that malnutrition is about 
twice as prevalent among rural children as among city chil- 
dren. Its existence may be traced to the following causes: 
1. The eating of improper foods. Pickles, candies, too much 
meat, foods poorly prepared. 
2. Lack of proper foods. The children are not fed milk, vege- 
tables, fruits, and cereals. 
8. Lack of sufficient food. Children may come to school without 
breakfast. They may go without lunch. They may not 
have enough to eat. 
4. Bad habits of eating. They may eat too hurriedly. If they 
have to rush to catch the bus, or are anxious to get out on the
-P-A-G-E-293
THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 279 
playground at noon, they may almost as well not have eaten 
at all. 
5. Taking harmful foods and drinks. This refers to coffee and 
tea, but may also apply to things children often buy at lunch 
counters and confectionaries. 
6. Lunch is not in fit condition to eat. In the winter time the 
lunches may be frozen, at other times exposed to dust and 
flies, and unfit to eat. 
Other values in the school-supervised lunch are: 
1. The improvement of the physical condition of children. Gains 
in weight and height are more rapid among the supervised 
children. In New York City a three-months’ experiment 
demonstrated that school-fed children gained three times as 
much as those unsupervised. 
. Grades and discipline improve. 
. It is an economy measure. The food values in school-super- 
vised lunches are twice the food values in home lunches, and 
lunches bought from hot-dog stands and cheap shops. 
4. An increase in codperation between the school and the home. As 
one example of this, we may cite that the school lunch opens 
an avenue for the entrance of the domestic science depart- 
ment into the homes. 
5. The manners of the pupils are improved. Rudeness, awkward- 
ness, and rowdyism give way to courtesy, order, and ease. 
6. Cleanliness. The children are required to wash their hands 
before eating. oo 29 
Type plans. Three type plans have been developed. 
The codperative type is the simplest, and has been most 
widely used. Pupils, parents, and teachers codperate in sup- 
plementing the home lunches with one or two dishes served 
hot. The concession method is almost the opposite of the 
codperate plan. Under this scheme, private parties obtain 
permission of the school board to serve food to children, and 
take whatever profits result. City schools have followed 
this plan more frequently than rural schools. It has very 
few arguments in its favor anywhere. The third plan may
-P-A-G-E-294
  280 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
be called the public plan. Under this method the school 
supplies food, directs its serving, keeps accounts, and is re- 
sponsible solely for the management. 
In starting lunch supervision the codperative plan is to be 
recommended. The patrons will generally take kindly to it. 
At least some of the most intelligent people will see the point 
and help in getting better feeding conditions in the school, 
The investment is almost nothing, and operating expenses 
may be zero. If there is a home economics department the 
facilities utilized by it may be turned to service in the lunch 
hour, and the students may get practice work in preparing 
and serving. As the school grows, and the lunch gains in 
favor, the school should assume more and more control over 
the enterprise until it is virtually independent of volunteer 
assistance. 
The codperative plan— room and equipment. As the 
coéperative plan is probably the one which will be tried out 
first, we shall describe it at some length. A suitable lunch- 
room is the first requisite. The proposal is to assemble all 
the children who bring lunch in the lunchroom, whether they 
take the supplementary dishes or not. A classroom will do 
if there is nothing better. In old-fashioned buildings a 
splendid dining-hall may be arranged in the rotunda. Even 
a basement playroom may be cleaned up so that it is suit- 
able. There should be good light, good air, and tastefully 
finished walls. Flowers add to its attractiveness. Above 
all the room should be kept clean, and should be thoroughly 
aired before the lunch hour. 
For warm days an outside arbor is appreciated by the 
pupils. It should be close to the building, and well shaded. 
A lovely arbor may be made at little expense by the manual 
training department. A few posts are set in the ground, a 
trellis arrangement put up (wire screen is satisfactory) and 
some fast-growing vines trained over them. Rustic seats
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 281 
and tables should be built, and these may be left in the 
arbor the whole year round. 
The lunchroom should be equipped with strong tables, 
thirty-six by forty-eight inches in size. These are small 
enough to be moved readily, and, if it is desired to seat a 
large group together, the tables can be put end toend. Two 
tables will seat eight pupils, which is the best number for a 
social group. Either light bent-wood chairs or slat benches 
may be used for seats. Thirteen feet of floor space per 
child is standard. One hundred and fifty children require 
space equivalent to two classrooms. 
The cooking and serving equipment may be very simple, 
or it may duplicate in quality and quantity that found in 
the best modern restaurants. The minimum equipment is 
listed as follows: 
1. Stove. (A common heating stove, or a kerosene stove will do. 
A gasoline stove should not be used.) 
. Kitchen table. 
. Kettles for cooking soup and cocoa. (Capacity one cup per 
pupil.) . Dishpans. 
. Large spoons. 
. Ladle or cup for serving soup. 
. Measuring cup. 
. A few spoons, and two or three knives and forks. o9 20 DNAS 
Each pupil furnishes for his own use a cup, a plate, a 
knife, a fork, and a spoon. Napkins may also be brought 
from home, or the school may furnish inexpensive ones of 
paper. A good cupboard for storing dishes and supplies 
should be built. This is a simple project for the boys in 
manual training. Rice, flour, and sugar should be stored in 
tight tin cans or boxes, so they will be safe from mice and 
insects. 
Getting the equipment. So far no one has reported any 
trouble in getting the needed equipment. An entertain- 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  282" ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
ment may be given to raise the funds. Parent-teacher as- 
sociations will donate what is needed. If other means fail, a 
subscription list may be passed around. A community 
shower for the project will bring out numerous articles from 
the homes. In some cases equipment is loaned. There is, 
moreover, the school board to appeal to, and the boys can 
make tables, drying-racks, cupboards, benches, and fireless 
cookers. 
Getting supplies. Except for products which cannot be 
obtained from farm homes, very little ready cash need be 
available. The menus can be made up two weeks in ad- 
vance, and a close estimate of the kinds and amounts of 
materials required each day can be made. When the esti- 
mates are ready, the children should be requisitioned for the 
supplies. Only the necessary amounts should be accepted, 
and lunch checks equivalent to the value of the articles 
should be issued in exchange. 
_ The school garden is another source of supply! It 
should furnish the vegetables and the fruit. If this source is 
insufficient, there are usually quantities going to waste in the 
neighborhood during the season. These supplies should be 
collected and canned by the girls. A community canning 
and drying bee for the benefit of the school will result in 
putting away a year’s supply for the school. 
Cash must be forthcoming for sugar, cocoa, and other 
materials purchased at the stores. Ready money may be 
derived from charges made to vupils who do not bring

up from the school garden one hundred quarts of peas, fifty quarts of cu- 
cunibers, forty quarts of beans, twenty quarts of rhubarb conserve, ten 
quarts of strawberries, twenty quarts of beets, and several cans of spinach. 
There were left at the date of the report two acres of beans to harvest, three 
fourths of an acre of potatoes, and an abundance of sweet corn, cabbage, 
tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, okra, salsify, onions, yams, peanuts, chard, 
endive, beets, and strawberries,
-P-A-G-E-297
  
THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 283 
produce, and to make up the difference between supplies 
furnished and food served. The school board ought not be 
adverse to adding something to the budget. It may be 
charged to the domestic science department, and dishes pre- 
pared in the department in the regular course may be served 
in the lunchroom. The pupils furnish the milk, the school 
board the cocoa and sugar, and the domestic science class 
gets the experience of preparing the drink. 
The labor factor. There remains the sometimes embar- 
rassing problem of getting some one to do the work. The 
food raust be prepared and served, the dishes washed, and 
the room kept clean. Most of this work can be alternated 
among the boys and girls who get the benefit of the lunch 
service. A week’s turn at kitchen duty is the right division. 
This prevents the task from becoming burdensome to any 
one, and, if the right kind of leader is put in command, it 
becomes a game more than a task. 
In some schools, where the codperative plan is in effect, 
each pupil washes his own dishes. A large cupboard is 
needed, so convenient that each pupil may get and return 
his dishes without confusion. When clean-up time comes 
the pupils fall into orderly lines, as in the army. The work 
committee in charge for the week has made ready on a table 
two pans of hot water, one soapy, the other clear. As the 
pupils file past, each dips his dishes into the soapy water and 
washes them, and then rinses the dishes in the clear water. 
The work committee helps any one who needs it, and 
changes the water or adds to it as often as required. This 
method takes very little time, and under a watchful work 
committee the dishes are properly cleaned. 
' Keeping accounts. An accounting of all transactions 
should be made. In this way the interests of the pupils are 
protected. Some valuable practical experience in book- 
keeping may also be furnished some member of the com-

mercial department. Much recording can be saved by issu- 
ing small credit slips for raw products. If the commercial 
department takes charge of accounts, the planning of forms 
may be left to the class. If quick action is demanded, an 
ordinary notebook can be ruled to fill the bill very well. 
Two forms are necessary, one for the products, and another 
for the sales. ‘The following simple system needs no explan-

  Planning. The guiding principle should be not merely 
the serving of a hot dish, important as this is, but the sup- 
plying in the school child’s menu the food elements which
-P-A-G-E-299
  
THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM {285 - 
are commonly lacking. Those who are familiar with the 
contents of the traditional “dinner pail” know that the 
essential items conspicuous by their absence are milk and 
vegetables. Astounding as the statement may seem, this 
is nowhere more noticeable than in a dairying and gardening 
district. Soups in which these foods are served in combina- 
tion — cocoa, puddings, creamed and baked potatoes — 
provide these things in a variety of ways. 
Variety should be introduced into the menus. If only 
one dish is served daily, the children should not be able to 
anticipate what it is going to be. The surest way to kill the 
popularity of the school lunch is to adopt the orphan- 
asylum practice of having tapioca pudding on every Mon- 
day, pea soup every Tuesday, cocoa every Wednesday, and 
soon. The “surprise” element either in the food item, its 
preparation, or its serving is tonic to the appetite. Notice 
that the four-week menu below, for a Kansas school, is at- 
tractive, nourishing, and of generous variety:

Computing costs. The cost of each item will have to be 
found locally. Prices for staples do not vary much, but for 
local products the items will differ radically in price with the 
times, seasons, and communities. As the menus expand and 
as data on items are gathered, a cost card should be made up 
and posted, so that prices may be studied by the cooks when 
planning the meals for the week. One dish a day per child 
ought not to cost more than fifteen cents. It would be 
well if orders could be placed at one cent anitem. In New 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
  286 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
York City the plan of different priced articles was first tried 
out. This was unsatisfactory because the children rebelled 
against the distinction emphasized among those buying the 
different priced articles. The single three-cent article was 
next tried, but this gave so little variety that the children 
commenced to patronize the push-carts as of old. The man- 
agement then adopted the penny-an-article price, with the 
requirement that every child spend his first penny for a 
bowl of soup. 
If this plan is adopted, the task of the cook is to measure 
out penny-portions. In rural schools we do not have much 
experience with this method of serving, but, prices con- 
sidered, it would seem to be practicable in the country if it 
works in the city. Nevertheless, the price list prepared by 
the Michigan Agricultural College (Bulletin Number 12) 
gives us a good basis to commence our price-making upon:

president, secretary, management committee, and program 
committee —elected. The first rule to be adopted is that 
every one who does not go home to lunch must eat in the 
school lunchroom. Pupils must wash their hands before 
going to their tables, and if necessary a hint should be 
dropped that the hair is to be neatly combed. The pupils 
are to be seated in groups, as indicated by the management 
committee, and a hostess appointed for each table. As the 
children will at first be impatient to get out onto the play- 
ground, the lunch period should not be unduly prolonged. 
At the same time, in order to guard against confusion and to 
keep the children from bolting their food, fifteen or twenty 
minutes should be allotted, and no one is to leave until the 
signal is given. 
The program committee may help to make the lunch 
period more interesting. The members may assume the 
duty of seeing that flowers are put upon the tables. The 
main duty will be to make the occasion entertaining and in- 
structive. They should draw up suggestions concerning 
table manners, and post them on the bulletin boards. Good 
lively songs, ‘‘put over” as in Rotary clubs, keep the chil- 
dren in a cheerful frame of mind. Early in the term the 
domestic science teacher should explain the advantages in 
the lunch arrangement, and may give brief instructions in 
table etiquette. Tactfully given suggestions on such points 
as the following are in order: 
1. Hands and face washed before eating. 2. Hair neatly 
combed. 3. Plate, knife, fork, and spoon put in proper position. 
4. Seated at signal from hostess. 5. Upright position, elbows at 
side, never on desk. 6. Lunch eaten slowly and quietly, pleasant 
conversation, no talking when mouth is full of food. 7. Knife and 
fork held properly, knife used only for cutting food. 8. Lunch 
eaten in order, dessert last. 9. Drinking of water when wanted, 
but food not to be swallowed hurriedly by being washed down, 
10. Care taken to make no noise in chewing food or eating soup,

11. Napkin used to wipe the mouth and the hands. 12. Rise at 
signal, and leave room quietly. 
Codperation with domestic science classes. The general 
oversight of school feeding, regardless of what plan is used, 
will doubtless be in the hands of the domestic science depart- 
ment. The question then arises as to what extent the classes 
in domestic science may profitably codperate with the lunch 
club, either in actual assistance or in supervision. Some 
authorities on the school do not favor having any connection 
with the domestic science department. Some authorities on 
domestic science education are as pronounced in their objec- 
tions to the department having anything to do with the 
lunch project. Since, however, in the consolidated school 
the equipment used by one will naturally be used by the 
other, a practical plan for codperation seems imperative. 
There is one leading objection to having domestic science 
classes prepare the lunches. This is to the effect that the 
work is elementary and non-scientific, and therefore not 
educative. Criticisms heard of domestic science graduates, 
however, usually point out that it is this practical, elemen- 
tary side of their training which is neglected. This criticism 
will be less and less true as the classes learn from practice 
about child feeding, and the school lunch furnishes an ex- 
cellent opportunity for this kind of training. 
Even from the theoretical viewpoint, codperation with 
the lunch program may be useful. Much can be learned 
about well-balanced meals, the caloric value of different 
foods, and the hygienic preparation of large quantities of 
eatables. It helps to make clear the absurdity of the 
mental discipline theory as applied by some teachers to such 
everyday, necessary work as food preparation and serving. 
The duties may be properly proportioned and graded, so 
that there will be little loss due to pupils repeating tasks 
beyond the time needed to establish the proper learning 
bonds and habits.
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 289 
Codperation with the home. The codperation of parents 
in sending raw products for the lunch department is to be 
expected. There is another way in which the luncheon 
service may carry over into the home. The result should 
be a widespread improvement in child feeding in the en- 
tire community. This is to be accomplished through the 
school menus, mimeographed and sent to the homes, and 
through the reports of the pupils. Gradual approach to 
this stage must be made, the conference, the parent-teacher 
association, and home visitation or adult evening classes 
being the methods open. 
One of the lessons given during the lunch hour or at a 
meeting of mothers should take up the best method of pack- 
ing lunches, and the best kind of container to use. On this 
subject, Bulletin 72 of the Extension Division of Purdue 
University has some excellent advice. Miss Hadley, di- 
rector of home economics, says: 1! 
The container. For the daily lunch a permanent container 
should be selected. The box should be made of odorless material, 
durable, light, easy to carry, and provided with some means of 
ventilation. The lunch should be protected from dust infection. 
Boxes of either fiber, tin, or basket weave may be used. Contain- 
ers should be frequently scrubbed and should be aired well. 
Materials for packing. These should be as systematically cared 
for in the home as any other necessary equipment. The following 
is required: : 
1. Waxed paper saved from cracker and cereal boxes, or 
bought in rolls at ten cent stores. 
2. Paper napkins (can be bought for ten to fifteen cents per 
hundred). 
8. Cup or container with screw top for moist foods. 
4. Thermos bottle or jar for milk or other liquids. | 
5. Small salt shaker (convenience but not a necessity). /

Methods of packing. There are three precautions to take in 
packing: 
1. Line container with paper napkins. 
2, Wrap each article separately in waxed paper and place in 
box in order in which food will be eaten, the first being on 
top. 
8. See that the packing is compact so that the articles will not 
be shaken about. 
Experience reported. The school lunch is really an inno- 
vation in this country. As a result practices have not been 
standardized, and principals are rather hesitant about mak- 
ing positive statements as to what is or is not best. On this 
account reports of actual experience are very valuable. We 
are lucky to have available a very interesting and valuable 
account of the plan and experience of Lancaster, Massachu- 
setts, by the superintendent, Mr. Arthur S. Rollins. Mr. 
Rollins says: 
Nine years ago the Laneaster Social Service Association became 
interested in establishing a school lunch. It was impossible to ar- 
range for it in all the schools, but the School Committee, while not 
particularly favorable to the idea, granted permission to serve 
lunches at the Center School to pupils of the grades and the high 
school. This was gradually extended until it included the South 
Lancaster school, and eventually the North Lancaster school. 
There were some drawbacks to having an outside association take 
charge of the lunch, but there seemed no way out of it until at the 
beginning of the last school year the School Department authorized 
me to take over the operation of the noon lunch. 
Since then we have had the lunch at the center school prepared 
by the pupils of the household arts classes, and the serving has been 
in the hands of the pupils under the direction of the teacher. The 
girls have various duties. Some of them prepare the food, some 
attend to dish washing, and some clean and sweep the lunchroom 
after the children have gone out. The menu consists of cocoa and 
three kinds of sandwiches. The favorite kinds seem to be egg,

534-36. (May, 1922.)

THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 291 
cheese and olive, peanut butter, and jelly. Aside from this there 
is served each day some kind of baked dish, so that the pupils who 
bring no lunch from home may have something warm to eat, aside 
from the cocoa. Cocoa is sold at three cents a cup, the baked dish 
for five cents, and sandwiches for three cents each. In the out- 
lying schools it is not possible for us to serve anything but cocoa. 
The consideration which led to the establishment of the lunch in 
Lancaster was the fact that many of the children needed more and 
better nourishment than they were getting at home. We were im- 
mediately confronted with this difficulty. The children who most 
needed the lunch did not have the money with which to buy it. If 
we tried to give it to the children as a gift, they were too proud to 
accept it, and in many cases the parents felt sensitive about the 
children’s accepting it. We could not very well have them come 
up and get their cocoa and sandwiches without making payment. 
Those that were willing to accept the lunch free of charge were 
afraid to come and get it fearing they would be laughed at. We 
have overcome the difficulty in this way. The teachers in charge 
of the lunch confer with the school nurse, and a decision is reached 
concerning those children which should be given the lunch without 
charge. We have tickets printed, and the nurse puts into the 
hands of the parents of those children the lunch tickets. 
The children have no knowledge as to whether the tickets are 
bought or given to the parents. Thus all the child has to do is to 
present the ticket and get the equivalent in food. In this way we 
have entirely done away with the objection raised by parents and 
children that they did not like to accept charity and have others 
know about it. The nurse is given a certain number of tickets to 
dispose of, and I do not know to whom they are given. 
Our conclusion in regard to school lunches is this. First of all it 
is something that should be undertaken by the school department 
itself in order that it may be most successful. I can conceive of a 
situation, because we had one in Lancaster, where the school de- 
partment could not be induced to do it, and where it might become 
necessary for some outside agency to demonstrate the worth of the 
project. The proper way is, of course, for the school department 
to have full charge of the lunch. 
We feel that there is a distinct gain in the ability and achieve- 
ment of the children who need the nourishment. It is not an ex- 
pensive proposition for us either. Last year, including the expense 
of a considerable amount of new equipment, our school lunches
-P-A-G-E-306
  292 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
cost something like fifty dollars more than the receipts. ‘This year 
we shall come out almost even. 
The public plan.!_ The management does not differ in any 
marked respect under the public plan. More help is usually 
hired, and products are bought outright. Supervision may 
be lodged in the domestic science department. The in- 
structor should be in the room early. She should act as 
cashier (some one deputized by her may fill this position). 
A cook is usually employed, with an assistant and dish- 
washers, and they are paid by the hour. In some places the 
children help with serving for nothing, in other schools they 
are given their lunches for their assistance. The New York 
plan is very simple, but lacks the essential educational and 
social features which we have stressed. As described by the 
Public Education Association, its leading features are: 
In order to avoid waste the school cook is told at 9 o’clock how 
many lunches to prepare. Long table-like counters are put up by 
selected children at 11.50 a.m. The soup is served at the end of the 
room from serving tables, while all other food is served from what is 
known as the penny table. Children form into line, getting first a 
tray, spoon, and bowl of soup. The tray can then be filled from the 
penny table. At the end of the penny table stands the supervisor, 
who counts the articles on the tray and takes in the money. Chil- 
dren are allowed to return to the penny table to make further pur- 
chase, if they so desire. The children eat standing at the counters, 
which are put up and taken down by the children helpers. Chil- 
dren also help at the penny table, and give out trays, and spoons, 
and scrape and pile dishes. 
At the penny table are sold bread, cocoa, crackers, gingerbread, 
spice cakes, cookies, vegetables, cooked and raw fruit, sandwiches, 
salads, and puddings. 
School feeding and health work. In the succeeding 
chapter on health work the importance of nutrition classes is 
emphasized. Very early in the year the underweight and 
1 As the concession plan is believed to be in most cases unjustifiable, it is 
not discussed here,
-P-A-G-E-307
THE SCHOOL-LUNCH PROBLEM 298 
undernourished children should be organized into nutrition 
classes. Instead of sending them to the playground or to 
the gymnasium for calisthenics, they should be taken to the 
lunchroom for feeding and rest. The recess period will 
suffice. These children should be fed milk. If they are 
able to pay for it, well and good; if not, the public funds, or 
money raised by school entertainments or similar means 
should be relied upon. The results in school progress will 
themselves justify this course, to say nothing of the returns 
in better health and better physical development. This is a 
good time to suggest to teachers who are undernourished the 
wisdom in their joining the nutrition class. In some schools 
at ten-thirty every day milk is brought to the rooms, and all 
children and teachers who need it are served. 
Final considerations. It is clear enough that the pathway 
of the modern principal is not always strewn with roses. He 
will have no doubt of it when initiating the school lunch. 
There will be objections from those who are ignorant, from 
thuse who do not care, and from the visionary do-nothings 
who think it is not a complete solution of the economic and 
social causes lying at the root of malnutrition. Teachers 
who have been brought up on a diet of formal grammar and 
more formal arithmetic may also not take kindly to this 
latest addition to the curriculum. However, with patience 
and courage the worst of the obstacles will disappear. The 
principal will not be without support from the very begin- 
ning. One who drives ahead persistently a program that 
puts human needs and values at the forefront will seldom 
suffer more than temporary defeat. So far as there is human 
experience in this field to guide one, it may be summed up in 
the main in the principles which follow: 
1. The cofmmunity should be educated to the need and ad- 
vantage,of the school lunch, preliminary to introducing it. 
2. The beginning should be on a modest scale. The codperative
-P-A-G-E-308
  
  294 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
plan is doubtless the best at first. It should be expanded 
gradually until the school is in full control. The codperation 
of the children and the support of the parents should natur- 
ally be retained. 
8. The lunch hour should be capitalized as an ‘educatioy ral op- 
portunity. Health, cleanliness, social customs, and other 
subjects, ranging from bookkeeping and domestic science to 
social conventions, may be taught. 
4. The period should be made a pleasant one — a real feature in 
the recreational program. 
5. The efforts of the health department, the home economics de- 
partment, and the social department should join in the man- 
agement of the school lunch. 
6. Connection with the home should be obtained with the result 
of improving child-feeding as a whole, and not only at the 
lunch hour. 
7. No attempt should be made to realize a profit, but especial 
care should be given to economical and efficient management. 
Summary. The school supervised lunch serves three pur- 
poses: health, education, and convenience. Even if one 
wants to escape the responsibility, he cannot do so. The 
children must eat at school. There is the problem of seeing 
that they have a decent place to eat. While doing this it is 
only sensible to see that they have the right kind of food, 
and that it is served under conditions which make for health 
and for educational advancement. Three plans have been 
worked out. The first, the codperative, has as its chief 
feature the furnishing of raw food products for lunches by 
the pupils. The second, the concession plan, is one in which 
the school lets out the privilege of supplying lunches to 
private parties, who make what they can out of it. As their 
profits vary inversely with the quality and quantity of food 
served and the convenience of the service, the plan is not to 
be recommended. Under the third plan, the school takes 
over the whole management, and sells food to thé’children at 
cost. The third plan also provides for the felling of chil-
-P-A-G-E-309

dren free who are in need of it, but who are too poor to pay 
for the service. A combination of codperation in preparing 
and serving with school control is the best. The movement 
is very new in this country, but is rapidly coming to be a 
universal feature of the school curriculum.

near the school, and could go home at noon. 
Indicate how the school lunch may help in keeping up school attend- 
ance. 
Assuming that the arguments against the free school lunch were suffi-

school should no longer furnish lunches to any pupil? Discuss. 
Work out a week’s program for the lunch period. Let it be of such a 
type as will entertain and instruct.

      CHAPTER XVI 
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Importance of the problem. Of all the functions of the 
school, that of maintaining and promoting the health and 
safeguarding the children from accident is the most im- 
portant. The welfare of the group, the success of the in- 
dividual, and the attitude and spirit of the school are de- 
pendent to a large degree upon the efficiency to which health 
and safety work is carried on. If, because of lack of finances, 
one is forced to choose between an aggressive health and 
safety program and any other subject, he should unhesi- 
tatingly choose the former. That this belief in the supreme 
importance of the health function of the school is generally 
held by those most competent is shown by the table which 
follows. A body of school administrators, when asked to 
rank the seven objectives of education, gave the results as 
seen below:

       Like attendance, the problem is ever present. The 
health and safety work must go on year after year for every 
pupil. In this respect, it differs from most of the other sub- 
jects. For example, in penmanship the principal may set up 
a standard, and when any pupil has reached the standard 
he may be excused from further training in the subject.

Command of Fundamentals Civics may be stressed only in 
the eighth grade. Health 
education, however, must 
go on through the whole 
school-career of each child. 
It ought also to be so di- 
rected as to reach beyond 
the school precincts and 
influence the children and 
the adults in the commu- 
nity. Continuous and ef- 
fective health-and-safety 
education is the greatest 
instructional problem the 
school has to face. 
Present conditions. A 
consideration of present 
conditions will also show 
something of the magni- 
tude of the task before the 
school. Little is being 
done. According to the 
Census of 1920, the rural 
population was a little 
over fifty-one millions. Of 
this number, only about 
eleven per cent are receiving any form of health supervision. 
Two hundred and thirty-one counties — about eight per 
cent of the total —have some form of rural health service 
under whole-time officers. Eighteen states do not have a 
single county organized for health supervision and control. 
The only encouraging feature of the situation is to be found 
in the fact that the number of counties which are institu- 
ting health service is rapidly increasing. A growth of one
-P-A-G-E-313
     TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY = 299 
hundred and twenty-two counties since 1920 may be traced 
in large part to the growing emphasis upon health needs 
by the public school. 
The legislation on the subject is still pitifully inadequate. 
The lack of supporting laws will often make it difficult for 
the principal to develop the kind of health program he would 
like. Curiously enough, the superstition still persists that 
country people are peculiarly immune from many physical 
ailments. Accurate surveys have shattered this ancient 
faith.’ They tend to show that rural and village children 
are subject to more physical defects and to more sickness 
than city children — generally growing out of neglect. 
There are also many country people who hold to the old idea 
that epidemics and the usual run of school diseases are 
necessary evils. The children will have to run the gauntlet 
of measles, mumps, whooping cough, scarlet fever, and 
similar diseases some day, so why not have them and get 
them over with. This is pure delusion, and the health 
program will have proved itself worth while if it can elimi- 
nate community ignorance of this kind. 
There is some consolation to be derived from this appar- 
ently dark picture. The principal will find that almost no 
official action has been taken. The way is clear for him to 
introduce what new plans he will. He can build a new anda 
constructive program, bringing in the best experience and 
the best thought available. Necessarily, he will be forced 
to give attention first to the most pressing needs. He should 
moreover select such activities for his first effort as promise 
the greatest success. He will take care to avoid stirring up 
opposition. After immediate needs have been taken care of, 
and a feeling of confidence in the health program has been 
created, the plans may be enlarged gradually and require- 
ments raised. The educational feature of the program 
should be kept uppermost in the primcipal’s mind, and he   
  
-P-A-G-E-314
    
     ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
  300 
should contend against the ignorance which is the founda- 
tion cause of much disease. As ignorance is preventible, so 
is disease preventible, through a wise and liberal educational 
program. 
Types of health activities. After having decided upon an 
aggressive health program, the next duty is to plan the 
activities. As has been intimated, in doing this, the prin- 
cipal will be guided by what has been done, the attitude of 
the community, the funds available, and the needs of the 
pupils. He will also find it wise to confer frequently on the 
subject with health officers, physicians, dentists, civic and 
welfare groups, the parent-teacher association, and inter- 
ested citizens. His purpose in doing this will be to enlist 
support and to give such understanding of his plans that 
ignorant individuals and organizations will not be able to 
block them. 
Four main lines of effort should be undertaken. While 
the amount of emphasis upon each of these may differ, all 
are essential to a complete working scheme. They comprise 
1. Physical examination. This serves as a starting point for 
health education, and to indicate the progress being made. 
In other words, the physical examination is identical in pur- 
pose with the best type of standard measurement in the ordi- 
nary school subjects. 
2. Health instruction. This comprises one of the big positive 
aspects of the health program. It is applied here to the study 
of physiology and hygiene, and personal hygiene-teaching 
directly and indirectly. The hygienic condition of the build- 
ing and its equipment should also be considered a feature of 
this part of the program. 
8. Physical training. This is the practice side of physical educa- 
tion, and comprises the games, sports, gymnastics, athletics, 
and such corrective treatment as is deemed necessary. 
4. Welfare service. Under this phase of the health program is 
embraced general school and community activities, such as 
school feeding, nutrition classes, health crusades, and all 
codperative work with outside agencies. _   
-P-A-G-E-315
  TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 301 
Physical examination. Two types of physical examina- 
tion are required. One of these should be rather thorough- 
going and by a trained examiner. It may be given at rather 
long intervals, once or twice a year being sufficient, except in 
special cases. The other type is the frequent but rather 
hasty inspection by the teacher, and may be looked upon as 
a daily duty. A record of the first type should be preserved, 
but this is unnecessary for the second where time is an 
important factor. 
If the pupils have not been accustomed to a thorough 
physical examination, some preparatory steps should be 
taken. One of the first things to do is to talk the matter 
over with the parents at a meeting called for the purpose. 
Explain what is being contemplated, and why. It is prob- 
ably better to announce that the examinations are not com- 
pulsory, and that any pupils will be excused at the request 
of the parents. After the proposal is understood by the 
parents, present it to the pupils, beginning with the upper 
grades. If some of the older pupils will take the lead in 
volunteering, the younger ones will be more anxious to 
follow. Then set a day or days for the work to begin, and if 
necessary excuse pupils from classes as the examiner calls for 
them. 
There are several ways to obtain a competent examiner. 
Usually the local physician will take charge of the work. 
With a teacher or pupil assistant to do the weighing and 
measuring and to record results, the work can be completed 
in a few days. If it is not possible to arrange for the physi- 
cian, the task can be performed by the teachers, especially if 
there be a director of physical education. There are marked 
advantages in having the school do all the work, since the 
services of the teachers are always available for repeated 
examinations. Even an untrained teacher can soon mas- 
ter the simple technique which the ordinary examination
-P-A-G-E-316
  302 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
calls for. Their direct contact with the problem helps to 
awaken them to the need of careful instruction and wise 
preventive measures, and they are better teachers there- 
after. 
Of course, the logical way to solve the difficulty is through 
the employment of a school nurse. Often this can be done 
through coéperating with other schools. Sometimes the 
county nurse is available. The whole-time services of a 
nurse can be utilized to advantage in any school with five 
hundred or more pupils. Practically it is economy and cer- 
tainly it is educational efficiency to employ a nurse for a 
school of that size, even though it means economy in other 
educational activities than health. It is better to reduce 
the amount of grammar, mathematics, physiology, Latin, 
and geography a year each, and use the money saved to 
employ a health nurse than to do without her services. 
However, if this is not practicable, the principal should use 
the teachers to the best advantage he can to render service 
otherwise expected of the nurse. 
Examination equipment and facilities. Only simple 
equipment is needed. If possible a small room should be 
fitted up for the use of the examiner and to store equipment 
and supplies. The following articles will be needed as a 
minimum: 
A good set of scales for weighing the pupils. 
A staff for measuring height. 
A small table or stand for articles in use. 
A clinical thermometer. 
First-aid equipment. 
A couch and a few chairs. 
Blank forms for recording data, and a place for filing the forms. 
Eye-testing charts. 
The record forms should be prepared with the idea of re- 
peated examinations in mind. A single card should there-
-P-A-G-E-317
  
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY — 303 
fore contain the whole health record of each pupil. The 
degree of elaboration demanded of these forms will depend 
upon the type of examination. As a rule, they will be quite 
simple. The minimum facts called for should comprise 
the following: 
Name, age, grade, standing in the subjects. 
History of attendance, and of causes of absence. 
History of diseases and ailments. 
Weight, height, expansion. 
Defects, general nature, condition, ete. 
Suggested remedial treatment. 
Daily inspection by teachers. Regular physical exami- 
nation of all the pupils does not do away with the necessity 
of daily inspection by the teachers. They should be in- 
structed to note the pupils when they come into the school- 
room to see if they are in good health. If any display signs 
of contagious disease they should be isolated at once. 
Fevers, headaches, and frequent leaving the room should be 
noted by the teacher, and the pupil sent to the nurse or sent 
home. In addition, she should watch for eye-strain, the 
presence of colds, anemia, injuries of any sort, toothache, 
and in fact all the many ailments which afflict children, and 
take immediate steps for the care and protection of the 
children in need. 
Much of the daily inspection can in time become more or 
less automatic. Student monitors can inspect the younger 
pupils in respect to cleanliness of hands, face, and teeth. 
The weighing and weight-recording can likewise be cared for 
by the pupils. They may report cases of sickness, and the 
names of pupils suspected of having contagious and infec- 
tious diseases of any kind. The whole point is that teachers 
must be conscious of the health problem all the time, and 
careful to safeguard the interests of the pupils. As much of 
the inspectional work can be made a part of the instrue- 
tional activity, further discussion is deferred until later.
-P-A-G-E-318
  304 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
Health instruction. The results cf the physical examina- 
tions should in a large measure determine the nature of the 
health instruction. Mere teaching of formal lessons based 
upon anatomy, physiology, and textbook hygiene are not 
very likely to get results. What is needed is such instruc- 
tion as builds up ideals and attitudes where specific habits 
are out of the question. The teacher should stress the 
practical side of health education — bathing, keeping the 
teeth clean, attention to clothing; and right methods of 
study, sleep, exercise, and rest. The lessons should apply 
to the pupils at home, in the school, and in the community. 
Classes in other subjects, such as civics and~geography, 
offer opportunities for the teacher to take up live health 
problems. Health readers and magazines may also be relied 
upon to help motivate study and conduct. 
A very good illustration of successful health instruction is 
reported by Rosanne Amberson, in School Life. In a New 
Jersey school, where examinations brought out the fact that 
forty per cent of the children were unfit for school tasks, an 
especial effort was made to improve conditions. Quoting as 
to methods, we find: 
The most important step was to interest the children and 
through that interest to show the road to healthland. Health was 
dramatized, health was spelled, and drawn, and written, and sung. 
The whole course of study was reorganized and built around the 
idea of health. Each grade was assigned one particular topic, such 
as sleep, food, and cleanliness. Every health rule was put into 
practice as it was learned. Posters, stories, exercise books, and 
songs patterned after the American Child Health Association 
material were worked out for the pupils. All the subjects in the 
curriculum were correlated with health. English classes wrote ac- 
counts of the “Land of Health.’ Arithmetic classes drew exer- 
cises from the health field. Geography classes colored the map of 
New Jersey to illustrate the raising of health products. 
Physical examinations telling a story of underweight and subse-
-P-A-G-E-319
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY — 305 
quent backwardness in school brought about the formation of a 
health council. The duty of the council was to consider the 
problems of each underweight child, to select children for special 
classes, and to do the necessary follow-up work in the homes. 
Other work with backward children had demonstrated that im- 
proved health conditions enabled them to reach their proper grades 
gradually. 
In order to bring fathers and mothers into the school a health 
exhibit was arranged. All the work of health interest done by the 
children was gathered together and displayed in the assembly hall. 
One afternoon was given over to an entertainment consisting of 
songs, drills, and plays. Some 350 parents came to the exercise 
and watched a stern young judge banish coffee from the court and 
award a favorable verdict to milk, the “‘king of foods.” 
Health leagues and clubs. Health clubs are a great aid in 
fostering health habits and in promoting health campaigns. 
They should include the “Health Crusaders,” the ‘‘Junior 
Red Cross,” “Little Mothers’ Leagues,” “Sanitary Squads,” 
and similar organizations. Each room should be organized, 
with a general school council from all grades for the whole 
school. The first week in the year, health officers should be 
elected to inspect desks, take care of ventilation, and watch 
for contagious diseases. The general council or league may 
watch over the health conditions of the entire school. 
At the meetings of the clubs and councils, important 
health matters should be discussed. The best programs will 
be those which result in a program of action. For example, 
as a result of a meeting given over to the consideration of the 
relation between food and health, the club may plan an as- 
sembly program, a play, or an exhibit that will bring the 
lesson home to all. A study of disease-carriers may result in 
a clean-up campaign. A discussion of the need of exercise 
naturally should lead to a better organization of games and a 
wider use of the playground. 
The health code. The health code is a useful device for 
establishing health habits with younger pupils. A very
-P-A-G-E-320
  
306 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
good example is that drawn up by the National Tuberculosis 
Association. It consists of a list of twelve health “chores,” 
and a record form on which each pupil checks his daily 
health habits. On the other side of the card are the weight 
record and weight standards. If these forms are not avail- 
able, the pupils may prepare their own code and their own 
record forms. It is a good idea to put the code on a large 
card and post it in a conspicuous place in the room. At the 
inspection period every morning a show of hands on the per- 
formance of the code duties may be asked for by the health 
officer of each room. The list of health duties below is a fair 
sample of what should appear in the code: 
. I will sleep with the windows open. 
. I will take a bath at least twice every week. 
. I will brush my teeth at least twice every day. 
. I will keep my finger nails clean. 
. I will stand and sit in a good position. 
. I will go to bed early and get at least nine hours’ sleep. 
. I will not spit in any public place. 
. I will not drink tea nor coffee. 
. I will eat nourishing food. 
. I will take some exercise every day. 
. I will inspect my home premises, and see that they are clean 
and free from rubbish. 
. I will be watchful of the health of others, and do everything I 
can to protect them. MOD MNIADoP WOH ad ” 2° 
Teaching problems. There is a wide difference between 
the educational values of the usual health topics which 
make up the course of study. This difference is not always 
clearly perceived by teachers, who may tend to put as much 
emphasis and give as much time to minor topics as to those 
that are very vital and significant. Particularly do the old 
type books and courses put an unwarranted value upon 
knowledge of bodily structure and function. In order to 
gain some insight as to the relative importance of several
-P-A-G-E-321
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY = 307 
health problems, some experienced and capable teachers and 
principals were asked to assign ranks to them, giving first 
place to the most important, and so on down to the last 
which they considered of least importance. One of the 
significant points is that the usual type of physiology and 
anatomy appear at the bottom of the list. 
The topics mentioned are given only briefly here. How- 
ever, in accordance with the general point of view, it is under- 
stood that teachers have the obligation of forming right 
habits as well as of giving information. The order of em- 
phasis is as follows: 
1. Nutrition 8. Personal cleanliness 
2. Posture 9. Clothing 
38.. Care of the teeth 10. Exercise 
4. Home sanitation 11. Disease 
5. Ventilation 12. Drugs 
6. Rest and recreation 13. Circulation of the blood 
%. First aid 14. The bones 
Physical training. The physical training program is fully 
as vital as health instruction. In both, the aim should be to 
stress health in a positive way, never negatively. This will 
mean that health will be presented in terms of activity — 
beauty, strength, joy. The training program may thus 
come in as a powerful reinforcement of classroom teaching 
and may help to render permanent the habits which instruc- 
tion has labored to implant. As both instruction and 
training in the first six grades may well be done by the 
classroom teacher, there should be no break between instruc- 
tion and practice. 
In a school that is able to have the services of a health or 
physical training director, much of the teaching can be done 
by him. This is especially true of the upper grades. He 
can also help in training the classroom teachers in super- 
vising plays and games. He can plan the athletic contests
-P-A-G-E-322
308 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
and the play festivals. As the duties of such a person are 
discussed at length in the chapter on the playground and 
gymnasium program, only two points will be mentioned 
here, and those very briefly. 
First, it is generally held that the duties of the physical- 
education teacher should not be solely those of an athletic 
coach. It has been claimed that it is ordinarily bad policy 
even to employ a former athlete for the position, unless he 
has had special training as a physical training teacher. Often 
his interests are in winning games rather than in helping the 
pupils, en masse, to build better bodies and better minds. 
If not directly, then indirectly, his presence is sometimes 
antagonistic to friendly relations with other schools. He 
may intentionally or unintentionally help to demoralize the 
routine of the whole school. Teachers often complain that 
the presence of a coach who does not care for the regular 
school subjects makes their work more difficult for them. It 
is very seldom that circumstances warrant permitting any 
one not a member of the teaching body to coach athletic 
teams, or to have anything to do with physical education 
whatsoever. 
Second, the aim of the training program should be the de- 
velopment of all, and not of a favored few. This will mean 
regularly scheduled physical education classes throughout 
the day, and constant use of the playground and the gym- 
nasium. To motivate training, it is a good idea to plan 
inter-class and inter-school contests. The program should 
be diversified and continuous. The idea of having football 
players take no exercise or submit to no physical oversight 
except during the football season should not be tolerated. 
At the same time, it should be seen to that the bookish 
and retiring youngster has an opportunity to engage in 
healthful sports and games of a kind suited to his need 
and development.
-P-A-G-E-323
  
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY — 309 
If it is not possible to employ a physical director, the 
work should be apportioned out among the teachers. This 
is usually necessary anyway in the case of the girls. Two 
ways are open. Either all teachers may be required to do 
their share, or the tasks may be turned over to those who 
have the greatest liking for it. In a general way, the fol- 
lowing method of assigning physical education duties seems 
most satisfactory: 
1. Each classroom teacher should attend to any gymnastic or 
calisthenic exercises which the program requires in her room. 
2. The teachers who like playground work and who are most 
capable in managing it should be assigned playground duty. 
The other teachers may assume commensurate responsibility 
for hall and room order in their absence. 
. Contests and exhibitions should be in the hands of a teacher 
or teachers specially selected for the duty. They should be 
relieved of part of the load of classroom instruction as a con- 
sequence. ey 
The community program. The health program should be 
broad enough to take in the community. This means the 
extension of school activities into homes and into social 
groups, and the supplementing of home and community 
resources by the school. Thus a school clean-up campaign 
should be planned to lead toa community clean-up. “‘Swat- 
the-fly”” campaigns may originate in school, but need to 
reach every corner of the district before completed. The 
school lunch is an example of what can be done to supple- 
ment home resources. Nutrition classes for all under- 
nourished children is another worthy enterprise of the same 
sort. In order to show the variety and extent of school and 
community health projects we are summarizing a number 
of accomplishments which are not beyond the bounds of 
possibility for any good consolidated or village school: 
1. Following the physical examination of the pupils of a school, 
nutrition classes were organized for all undernourished and  
-P-A-G-E-324
810   
‘ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
malnourished children. The principal was able to obtain the 
services of a Red Cross nurse to establish the work. She laid 
the plan before the children and the parents. After two 
weeks she withdrew, and the duties were turned over to one of 
the classroom teachers who had been trained in the period of 
the nurse’s stay in the district. 
. The pupils of a school district where malaria was prevalent 
took the lead in mosquito abatement. They first cleaned up 
the school premises and destroyed the breeding places near by. 
Later the matter was brought to the attention of the chamber 
of commerce. As a result a small tax was levied, and an 
officer was employed part time to see that breeding places 
were destroyed or oiled. At the same time the school-health 
club conducted a.campaign for screened windows and doors, 
and the people were educated to protect malaria victims from 
mosquitoes. As a result, the second year saw the com- 
munity exempt from malaria, and the people no longer in- 
clined to look upon disease as a visitation of Fate against 
which they were helpless. 
“Better Health Week” also offers a means of stimulating 
school and community interest in health work. The program 
should be carefully planned. Class study may be motivated 
for a considerable period before and after by investigations of 
local health conditions, the preparation of exhibits and health 
books, the writing of essays on health, and in training for 
pageants and plays. This is a very good time to utilize such 
pupil organizations as welfare leagues, Scouts, and athletic 
clubs. The following is a typical week’s program: 
Monday: Class periods devoted to a consideration of 
what the various subjects can contribute to 
public health: mathematics, science, history, 
English, ete. 
Tuesday: A health assembly, open to the public. It may 
consist of a short health play, health songs, a 
demonstration of first-aid methods, and short 
talks by the local physician, the school nurse, 
the physical director, and the principal. 
Wednesday: Campaign day. This may be devoted to a 
clean-up of the school premises and the com- 
munity; to the eradication of flies, rats, squirrels
-P-A-G-E-325
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 3811 
and mosquitoes; to physical examinations; to 
the establishment of the school lunch; or other 
worthy enterprises. 
Thursday: Conference day. The program should be given 
over to meetings of parent-teacher associations; 
civic-league gatherings; health clubs, ete. The 
parents should be invited to inspect the physical 
condition of the school plant. This is a good 
time to launch any new undertaking, such as 
nutrition classes or sex education. 
Friday: Exhibit day. In addition to displays of charts 
and posters in the school, there should be a pro- 
gram of plays and games, health parade, gym- 
nastic activities, health pageants, and field-day 
events. 
Codperative organizations. There are several organiza- 
tions which are willing to help in carrying out the health 
program. They will give a variety of aid, generally in the 
way of speakers, slides and films, publications, and exhibits. 
Sometimes one can get survey staffs, dental clinics, and even 
medical attention for needy pupils. Often the parent- 
teachers’ association will furnish supplies and equipment for 
the use of the health department. Among the many op- 
portunities open to the principal, the following are men- 
tioned: 
1. The Junior Red Cross. This organization has an excellent 
plan for developing health work and for obtaining working 
facilities. In many places in the country, the members are 
maintaining clinics, conducting nutrition classes, and correct- 
ing physical defects in children. ‘The salvage shop is the chief 
method of supporting the Junior Red Cross activities. 
2. The Scouts. Both the boys’ and the girls’ organizations are 
helpful. They take in pupils of grammar and junior high 
school age, but do not have much of a following in the high 
school. They teach health habits and fine health ideals. 
They give an organization which is very effective in carrying 
out health campaigns. 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  
  312 
3. ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
Young Men’s Christian Association. Very good in codperat- 
ing in recreational programs. In communities where the As- 
sociation has a building, it may be used to supplement school 
resources through its swimming pool, gymnasium, and club 
rooms. Often the local organization takes the lead in seeing 
that these facilities are added to the school if they are lacking 
in the community. 
. United States Public Health Service. The publications of this 
department supply some good supplementary material for 
classes in civics and in health. Films and slides may some- 
times be obtained, and an occasional exhibit. Advice is also 
available. 
. 4-H Clubs. These are the industrial clubs fostered by the 
United States Department of Agriculture. Good health is 
one of the objectives for which they work. 
. State health departments. Although these vary in effective- 
ness, they are usually willing to supply information and sug- 
gestions touching on health problems, such as disinfection, 
quarantine, epidemics, and the state health code. 
. Parent-teachers’ associations. Two things may be supplied by 
the parent-teachers’ association. They are equipment and 
service. When unable to get what is needed from the school 
board, it is a good idea to apply to the parent-teachers’ associ- 
ation. It is surprising, to one who has never had experience, 
how much will be volunteered by these groups and how much 
more effective school programs may be because of their cojp- 
eration and support. 
Handling safety education. This aspect of education is 
closely related to the health program, and should be handled 
in much the same way. Some one should be held responsible 
for the teaching side, and for seeing that the pupils are pro- 
tected from injury. The teachers can attend to the first 
duty; the second is a responsibility of the principal. He 
should see to it that pupils are safeguarded against injury. 
There should be no slippery entrances, no dangerous stair- 
ways, no open-window courts, no exposed wires, no fire 
hazards, and no games in which the pupils are liable to be 
seriously hurt.
-P-A-G-E-327
  
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 813 
The pupils should have a large share in executing the 
safety plan. Boy Scouts may be assigned to supervise pupil 
traffic. The older pupils may take turns in watching over 
the safety of the smaller children on the way to and from 
school. Playground safety may often also be assured by 
delegating some responsibility to older pupils. Fire drills 
should be practiced frequently, whether the state laws re- , 
quire them or not. The principal should always take charge 
of these. He should insist upon absolute order in leaving 
the building and outside. The pupils should be marched to 
some little distance from the building and to points previ- 
ously agreed upon. They should stand at attention, and 
should not re-enter the building until the principal gives the 
command to do so. All teachers and all pupils should leave 
during the drill period, and some older pupils may be ap- 
pointed to see that the rooms are empty. 
A recent bulletin of the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion ! states that fifteen thousand school children are killed 
annually through accident. There is also a large number of 
accidents in which pupils are maimed and crippled, but 
which do not result in death. The chairman of the National 
Safety Council is authority for the statement that ten 
thousand lives a year can be saved by safety education. 
This fact alone recommends it to the thoughtful consider- 
ation of every school official. Not only this, but safety edu- 
cation works basically in engendering a higher sense of re- 
sponsibility, a greater appreciation of life, and an appre- 
ciation of government and other fostering and progress- 
making institutions. 
Education for citizenship in the best sense necessitates a 
course in safety. The program should be prepared in the

sults.. United States Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 32 (1922), Wash+

light of local conditions, but may extend beyond them. 
The whole school program should be connected with the 
course — the shops, the playground, and the home projects. 
The drivers of the school busses may become an important 
factor in accident education and prevention by driving care- 
fully, and by scrupulously obeying the rules of the road. 
, At least the following items should appear in the course of 
instruction: 
. How to prevent accidents in and around the home. 
How to prevent accidents from animals. 
How to prevent accidents from fire. 
How to prevent accidents from firearms and explosives. 
How to prevent accidents from poisons and drugs. 
How to prevent accidents from machinery. 
How to prevent accidents from street and highway traffic. 
How to prevent accidents from plays and games. DSS Sram 0 0 et 
Measuring results. Unfortunately, there is no standard 
method of measuring the results obtained in this field. 
Lacking these we are forced to rely upon the unscientific 
basis of opinion. On this basis, we may first feel confident 
that health education is having its rightful place on the 
program only if facilities and teachers are provided — in 
other words, only if health education is recognized as a con- 
stituent part of school work. Second, we need to know 
whether it is being carried over into the home life of the 
pupils, and that the death rate, amount of sickness, number 
of absences for sickness, and the run of preventible diseases 
are on the decrease. A third index is the activities program, 
the number of exercises, the proportion of pupils participat- 
ing, the interest and enthusiasm of the pupils, and in general 
the tone and spirit of the whole school. The fourth measur- 
ing device is found in such results as appear in repeated 
weighing and measuring of the children. If the curve of 
individual and group growth is regular and upward in re-
-P-A-G-E-329
TAKING CARE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY = 315 
spect to such norms as are at hand, then we can feel certain 
that the health of the pupils is not being neglected. 
Two other points may be mentioned. The very number 
of pupils examined, the number which have taken steps 
toward remedying defects of body or environment, the cor- 
rective measures applied at school — all these give evidence 
as to the effectiveness with which the program is being car- 
ried out. Last of all comes a consideration of community 
activity itself. Included in this are the number of special 
health campaigns, the proportions of patrons codperating, 
the energy of the local health officers, the growth of protec- 
tive and recreational agencies, and, to summarize, the atti- 
tude of the people of the district. 
Principles of health education. The actual details of 
health administration are so numerous as almost to defy 
classification. The neglect of any of these will subtract 
more or less from the efficiency of the health program. 
Much will depend upon wise foresight in organizing the 
work, and in energy and persistence in keeping it going for- 
ward. While in so big and so critical a problem success does 
not follow upon the mere observance of rules, the following 
principles must be carried out to realize the fullest success 
under the conditions ordinarily prevailing in the consolidated 
school: 
1. The efforts of all teachers should be codrdinated in a physical 
education department. 
2. Learning by doing should be the rule. This means that a 
large part of the time allotted to physical education should be 
given over to activities. 
8. All available forces should be enlisted in support of the school 
program. ‘This includes, as well, available facilities. 
4. Instruction should be both direct and indirect. The older 
formal type of material, with its emphasis upon physiology 
and anatomy, may be eliminated from the course of study. 
6. Education must be preventive, developmental, and corrective.
-P-A-G-E-330
  316 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
6. Attention should be given to environmental causes of sick- 
ness, accident, and physical defect. Steps should be taken to 
remove causes as well as to give health information, ideals, 
and habits. 
7. At least once a year the principal should take stock of the ac- 
complishments in health work, not on the basis of reports of 
teachers on individual pupils, but with the whole program 
under consideration. 
Summary. The most important function of the school is 
the education of the pupils in health and its promotion and 
protection. In spite of this having been long appreciated, 
but little has as yet been done. The principal therefore is 
likely to find that he must lay his own plans and develop his 
own program. He will probably direct his efforts along four 
or five main lines. They are the survey or examination, the 
improvement of the physical environment, instruction in 
personal hygiene, physical instruction and training, and 
community service. Where money is available it is a good 
idea to employ a health director. He takes charge of the 
physical education department, codrdinates the work of all 
the teachers, and gives instruction. 
Next in importance to the physical training instructor is 
the school nurse. In welfare service she is almost indis- 
pensable. By apportioning the expenses incident to her 
employment, even small districts may have the services of a 
part-time nurse. Present-day attention to new agencies 
should not cause us to overlook the importance of the class- 
room teacher. If her work is well planned, she may greatly 
promote health conditions in the neighborhood. The prin- 
cipal should also so direct the health activities of the entire 
school as to embrace the leading community health pro- 
blems. In making his work efficient he will need the codper- 
ation of local and national organizations. Safety work 
should be handled in much the same manner as health educa- 
tion.

EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
. Is the common assumption that rural pupils are healthier and freer 
from physical defects than city pupils justified by the facts? Discuss. 
. Explain why it is that health education must be continuous, and can- 
not be considered finished as can education in mathematics, penman- 
ship, and geography. 
. If you were given charge of a school in a community strongly opposed 
to health education because of some peculiarity of religious belief, 
how would the opposition cause you to modify your plans for health 
instruction? 
. Point out the minimum personal benefits which might be expected to 
accrue to the classroom teachers from a well-organized plan of health 
education. 
. What system of records concerning teacher-health is desirable? 
. Explain how you will insure that your teachers will be attentive to 
such health matters as ventilation, heating, cleanliness of person, and 
the like. 
. Point out the objections to employing an athlete to take charge of the 
physical education program. 
. Work out a scheme whereby a principal might evaluate the work of 
the year in physical education. 
. Make up a general list of facilities available in communities which are 
useful supplements to the school in health education. 
Work out a list of directions to teachers and pupils which will help in 
making the fire drill effective and business-like. 
Plan a small health exhibit, such as might be prepared by upper-grade 
and high-school pupils. 
Prepare a form that could be used in reporting physical defects to 
parents. Keep in mind that it should call attention to the probability 
of the need of corrective measures only, should be tactfully worded, 
and should be designed to get results. 
Make up a list of community health problems which are suitable for 
study in a class in civics. Such as the following are examples: quaran- 
tine, drugs, sickness, health regulations, and health agencies. 
Assuming an already overloaded curriculum, how would you introduce 
health education into a school where it was largely non-existent or of 
the formal type?

CHAPTER XVII 
THE PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM PROGRAM 
Legitimate purposes. The playground and the gymnasium 
are parts of the educational facilities of the school. Their 
activities should be considered educational agencies in the 
same way in which formal class activities are considered. 
The.conception of the intermission and physical education 
periods as opportunities for the overworked teacher and the 
bored pupils to get a little relief and relaxation from responsi- 
bility, while perhaps justified in connection with the old 
one-room type of rural school, is entirely inadequate for the 
modern consolidated school. Furthermore the common 
assumption that the active, outdoor character of farm life 
obviates the necessity for play ignores the findings of the 
recent farm-life surveys. This assumption has been largely 
responsible for the slow growth of playground activities in 
rural communities. 
Our program of playground education must be a live one; 
it must stimulate enthusiasm, maintain interest, and be 
sought after and not evaded. It must follow along with and 
have the same aim as the general educational program. It 
must be a natural process, a development from within, anda 
program that will afford the youth an opportunity for ex- 
pression in doing worthy things. With this general point of 
view accepted, the purposes may be stated as follows, due 
consideration being paid to the needs of the child and the 
community, the nature of childhood, and the special nature 
of rural life: 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
    320 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
1. To provide an opportunity for spontaneous expression. 
2. To give a change from the unnatural postures and tasks which 
schools have not yet learned how to avoid. 
8. To serve as an agency for socializing the pupils and developing 
the quality of leadership. 
4. To make for the development of ethical character. 
5. To implant and foster the growth of worthy avocational 
interests. 
6. To help in the building of healthful, symmetrical, and graceful 
bodies. 
There is no disputing the fact that educators can come 
more nearly making boys and girls what they ought to be 
through the organized playground activities than by any 
other means at their command. What is most wanted is 
that each shall develop himself in character and ability to 
the utmost extent to which he is capable. If there is origin- 
ality, if there is a germ of leadership, we want it discovered 
and developed. Instead, however, of using the natural and 
obvious means, we take these children and give them care- 
fully prescribed books, none of which interest them very 
much. Whether they are interesting or not, the pupils must 
give the same time to them all. Educators do this while ad- 
mitting that play is the best means to develop the desired 
qualities of alertness and initiative. To evolve a playground 
and gymnasium program that is up-to-the-minute, and 
which will be of real value in training for the broad citizen- 
ship requirements of to-day, is the function of the leader of 
the new consolidated school. 
Problems involved. In achieving these purposes of the 
playground program, the principal will have these problems 
to master: 
1. The securing of adequate play space, and apportioning it 
properly to care for the needs of the various age and sex 
groups. s 
2. The providing of sufficient apparatus, of a type which is safe, 
economical, and graded to the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-335
  PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 3821 
8. Building up and organizing a suitable playground curriculum. 
4. Organizing and training an adequate playground supervisory 
force. 
5. Planning an athletic program that is in accord with the aims 
of the school, and fitting it into the daily schedule. 
6. Estimating the worth of the methods and the results. 
7. Codrdinating the school program with the community needs 
and interests. 
These problems will be taken up in the order just given. 
Securing and apportioning play space. If the community 
has used the means at command, there will be little diffi- 
culty in obtaining sufficient play space in the consolidated 
school. If it has not, then, under the leadership of the 
principal, steps should be taken to enlarge the district 
holdings as soon as possible. The supplementary devices 
open are as follows: 
1. Rent adjacent lots near by. 
2. Increase the size of the gymnasium by means of play sheds. 
8. Use near-by streets and roads, taking proper precautions for 
safety. 
4, Section the school for play purposes, dismissing sections at 
different hours. 
After the play space has been secured, the next duty is to 
apportion it among the groups. It is necessary to do this in 
the interests of better and cleaner play, and to make super- 
vision effective. The problem is somewhat complicated by 
the presence on the grounds of pupils ranging from five to 
twenty years of age. The divisions need not be along grade 
lines. The guiding principle should be to put together those 
children who are of similar physiological and social age. In 
athletics, separate fields will have to be made for boys and 
girls. Division of the sexes is unnecessary in many of the 
running games, and among the pupils who will care to use 
the ordinary playground apparatus. If the high school 
pupils become a difficult problem, it is the best plan to
-P-A-G-E-336
  322 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
schedule their playground periods at a different hour from 
that of the elementary pupils. 
There are two ways to divide, either of which has about 
the same results. First is on the basis of pupils, the second 
on the basis of activities. They overlap somewhat, but 
psychologically it is probably better to announce divisions 
on the basis of games. Thus, instead of saying that the 
primary children must keep to one part of the field, and the 
junior high school pupils to another, one could say that those 
who play running games must do so at a certain place, while 
those who play baseball must also have a definite place to 
play. To illustrate. the methods we have: 
1. Apportioning on the pupil basis: 
a. Group 1. Pupils of the primary up to the age of nine. 
b. Group 2. Intermediate up to and including the sixth 
grade and ages 9-12. 
ce. Group 3. Junior high school and high school group 
- 2, Apportioning on the activities basis: 
a. Quiet games, such as the sand pile, teeters, and swings. 
These should be in some protected spot where the chil- 
dren are not in danger of being knocked down by rough 
play or being struck by stray balls. Swings should al- 
ways be at some distance from other games and some- 
what secluded, so that runners will not be struck by 
them. 
b. Ring and singing games should be assigned a plot near 
the building. The ground should be smooth and level. 
It should be free from danger from other activities, and 
near the door, so that a piano or phonograph may be 
employed if desired. It is also a good idea to have such 
a space as this lighted for community use in the evenings. | 
c. Free play space for running games, such as tag, prisoner’s | 
base, and dare base. 
d, Competitive games, such as baseball, football, basket — 
ball, and tennis. | 
Providing play apparatus. The recognition that play-| 
ground and gymnasium activities are regular parts of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 323 
educational program will remove most of the objections to 
purchasing the needed apparatus and equipment. As a 
general principle, the school budget should be made to care 
for such things. If the school board cannot be converted 
to this point of view, the principal must needs fall back upon 
the well-known methods of supplementing school resources: 
—drives for paper, rags, and the type of articles seen at 
rummage sales; entertainments, dramatics, and athletics; 
and the efforts of the pupils inmaking equipment. It is not 
necessary to try to supply everything at once. It is better 
to begin modestly, and add a unit or so a year until essentials 
are supplied. 
The interests of the pupils should again be consulted in 
selecting apparatus. The call for slides, horizontal bars, 
and swings is to be expected. From an examination of re- 
creation surveys, it is found that the following items of equip- 
ment are in demand: 
Swings Horizontal bars Climbing poles 
See-saws _Flying rings Wading pools 
Sliding poles Hand swings Sand piles 
Vaulting bars Inclined ladders Vaulting poles 
Slides Giant strides 
At the same time, the games which will call for space and 
equipment are: 
Baseball, Football Tennis 
outdoor and indoor Handball Croquet 
Basket-ball Soccer Volley ball 
The items of equipment themselves include: 
1. Baseballs: For boys, regulation outdoor baseballs and indoor 
or playground balls, six each in number. For girls, indoor 
balls twelve inches in circumference, six in number. 
. Bats: Indoor and outdoor, six in all. 
. Gloves: For boys, catcher’s mitt, first baseman’s mitt, and 
pitcher’s glove. 
4. Catcher’s mask and chest protector. oe 2 
   
-P-A-G-E-338
  
324 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
. Soccer balls: Two needed. 
. Tennis nets: Two to four. 
. Basket-ball hoops and backboards: At least two pairs. Can 
be made in the workshop. 
8. Six basket-balls: Those with outside seam are best for outdoor 
use. 
9. Two volley-balls. 
10. Two volley-ball nets. 
The use of any apparatus or equipment should not be 
limited to a particular group. An occasional shifting around 
will add zest to the play of all. It is quite surprising to find 
out how well team play can be developed in little children 
when they are given a chance. Especial care should there- 
fore be taken to prevent the older pupils from monopolizing 
the facilities for social and codperative games. 
Much of the work of making and setting up apparatus 
can be done with profit by the classes in manual training. | 
Plans for home-made apparatus may frequently be found in 
current physical and playground magazines. Several state 
educational departments and state colleges issue bulletins 
giving detailed plans. (See bibliography at close of chapter.) 
The playground curriculum. The problem of the princi- 
pal here is much the same as in making the curriculum in any 
other subject. He has to select and grade the activities 
which will best realize the aims which have been set forth. 
At this point it is proper to note that just as the building | 
largely controls the educational offering of the school, so 
does the amount and kind of play equipment and apparatus, 
to say nothing of space, materially limit the activities on the 
playground. In other words, one always has to take into’ 
consideration the factor of what is practicable and possible 
as well as what is ideal. 
The tendency is towards the elimination of the traditicnall 
gymnastics. The trend is towards the socialized programs, 
such as are named in the chapter on Social Activities. In 
IO 
   
-P-A-G-E-339
  PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 325 
grading these the determining factors must be physiological 
and social development. The authors believe that there is 
not much validity in the old classifications of games by child 
psychologists, which signified: (1) individualistic and non- 
competitive games for children up to eight, (2) strongly 
competitive contests for the period nine to eleven, and (3) 
socialized games for the junior and senior high school. On 
the contrary, it is maintained that both types will be in 
demand from the first, and that a wide variety must be of- 
fered to satisfy the varying, but nevertheless keen, interests. 
The classification which is given below is adapted from the 
list approved by the Committee on Games of the Playground 
and Recreation Association of America, and has sound judg- 
ment and experience back of it:

Additions to the list given may easily be made. Williams 
has prepared a graded program in his book on Physical
-P-A-G-E-341
  PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 827 
Education, which is recommended. Other sources are 
Bancroft, Plays and Games; Johnson, What to Do at Re- 
cess; Curtis, Play and Recreation in the Open Country; and 
the several publications of the Playground and Recreation 
Association of America. Cubberley has an excellent chart 
of graded activities in The Principal and His School (page 
123). The principal will find it wise to have such materials 
on plays, games, and athletics at hand for ready reference. 
Playground supervision. Supervision of the playground 
is a necessity. It is especially important in consolidated 
schools because many of the children have been isolated and 
have not learned to play with other children. If the chil- 
dren are left alone there is not only likely to be improper 
conduct, but not much play will goon. Curtis remarks that, 
on the unsupervised playground, the chief delight of the 
children is to steal each other’s hats or coats; that so far as 
there is play it is almost absolutely without ideals or sports- 
manship; that it does not train in any of those manly and 
chivalric qualities which makes sportsman a name almost 
synonymous with gentleman. On the other hand, the play- 
ground supervisor can do much towards solving many of the 
classroom disciplinary problems by teaching habits of hon- 
esty and politeness, and developing attitudes of love for fair 
play, respect for authority, and admiration for rules of 
conduct. 
Much of the supervisory work should be done by the 
teachers. Those best fitted by natural endowment and 
training for the direction of certain groups of children or 
types of activities should be put in charge of them. Thus 
one teacher can take care of the play on the apparatus, 
another of quiet games, still another of singing and running 
games, while the physical director takes care of athletics. 
Every teacher may not be needed on the playground. or 
may not be adapted to playground work, but every teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  328 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
should be willing and ready to do her share of the supervi- 
sion or relieve another teacher from classroom duties so the 
other teacher can help manage the playground. 
This does not mean that the children are to be tagged 
around all the time, nor that they are to be spied upon. 
One of the aims of the play program is to foster self-reliance 
and initiative. The play does need direction very often, 
disputes must be prevented, and, in some cases, differences 
must be adjusted. It is in enthusiastic direction and fair 
decision of questions that might lead to disagreement that 
the teachers can best function. Love of play on the part of 
older people is very infectious. Once in a while the teachers 
can take part in the games. This promotes the interest and 
good spirit of the children in the play and makes for a feeling 
of comradeship between teachers and pupils which is not 
readily obtained by other means. 
Supervision by pupils. In the hands of a skillful organizer 
many of the older pupils can be used to help supervise the 
play of the younger ones. In the Gary schools, high- 
school pupils do apprentice work in organizing games and 
athletics the same as they do in shop practice. Under the 
New York plan it is recommended that: 
Older pupils should be trained to direct the group plays and 
games of the younger group and used as leaders while the teacher is 
busy with other children. This should be a definite part of the 
training of the older pupils. Make it an honor at first, using those 
who have made best progress, but give all a chance sooner or later. 
The problem of athletics. Athletics is coming to be 
recognized as an important part of the playground program. 
First treated with open hostility, then with passive tolerance 
as a necessary evil, it has now come to the stage where edu- 
eators are actively trying to realize the potential civic, social, 
and physical values. Wise management still is imperative if 
it is to live up to the high standard ascribed by Professor 
Dudley:
-P-A-G-E-343
PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 329 
The athletic field is one of the greatest laboratories in an institu- 
tion of learning for developing self-control, personal honor, and 
courtesy. The school that is only concerned with the intellect and 
is neglectful of the feeling and will is not raeeting the need to-day for 
training in character and citizenship. 
Guiding principles. In laying out an athletic program 
for the public school of to-day, an effort should be made to 
realize such aims as the following: 
1. To train in habits of enjoyment, in an approved way, of the 
hours of leisure. 
2. To promote school spirit, school loyalty, high ethical stand- 
ards, good sportsmanship, and decent citizenship. 
8. To develop a friendly relation between the school and the 
community, and with other schools and communities. 
4. To advance the physical welfare of the students. 
5. To provide an income for legitimate student activities that 
cannot be financed otherwise. 
In carrying out these aims a few definite principles need 
to be in the foreground constantly: 
1. Students should not be permitted to participate in activities 
which will prove injurious to them, or for which they are 
physically handicapped or deficient. 
2. Good sportsmanship should be the keynote and dominating 
principle of every contest, game, and exhibition. 
8. Supervision should be constant and alert, and by capable 
persons at all times. 
4. General participation by every one in the school should be the 
objective rather than the production of a championship team. 
It is much better to train five hundred pupils to average 
ability along athletic lines than to neglect four hundred and 
eighty-five while fifteen become champions. The object is to 
make the training of all as efficient as possible, but the group 
should never suffer at the hands of a few highly trained stars 
as is now so often the case. 
Special problems of the principal. The question of 
athletics is not a simple one by any means. If the aims are 
realized in any satisfactory way, the principal will have to
-P-A-G-E-344
  
830 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
keep a watchful eye on the whole program. There are cer- 
tain problems which come into his province alone. These 
we shall first enumerate, and then briefly discuss. The 
principal must: 
1. Employ a director of athletics who by nature, training. ex- 
perience, and inclination is prepared to realize the aims set 
forth. 
2. Determine what sports and activities are legitimate for his 
community. 
8. Decide specifically upon the amount and kind of athletics for 
girls. 
. Fit athletics into the regular school program. 
. Organize and supervise the finances. 
. Fix the rules and conditions under which the activities may be 
carried on. 
. Educate the community to the true purposes of athletics. 
. Help in organizing county and state athletic leagues and 
obtain capable officials. Doe 
wow 
The director. The director should be chosen by the 
school board, exactly as any other teacher is chosen. The 
qualifications for such a position should be determined very 
rigidly as to personality, character, force, and cleanliness, 
fully realizing that the person chosen will be a living ex- 
ample for all the boys of the neighborhood. Dudley truth- 
fully says that the coach has more influence for good or evil 
than any other instructor. He must be a clean man in every 
way. He must be a firm believer in fair play, honest meth- 
ods, and amateur sport. He ought not be chosen simply be- 
cause he was a star player, or even because he knows how to 
coach athletics, but also, because of his ability as an all 
areund good citizen and example for the youth of the school 
district. His contact with the boys should make him the 
principal’s right-hand man, and it is a good idea to appoint 
him dean of boys or vice-principal. 
Choosing the sports. In the chapter on the social pro-

gram, a method of selecting student activities was given. At 
this time we shall supplement the previous discussion by 
setting down certain points against which activities should 
be matched. We may say that those which score highest 
are preferable; 
. Those which are continued longest through life. 
. Those which are least conditioned by the seasons. 
. Those which the larger group enjoy the most, either as parti- 
cipants or as spectators. 
4. Those which have the lowest per-capita expense for main- 
tenance. 
5. Those which have the most wholesome mental, moral, and 
physical influence. 
6. Those which demand most of the individual in the way of 
team work. 
. Those which are least encumbered by restricting rules. 
. Those which give the maximum pleasure in the doing. 
. Those which the best elements of society practice and approve.

Athletics for girls. There is a difference of opinion as to 
the kind and extent to which girls should participate in the 
usual forms of athletics. Most of the adverse criticism has 
grown out of the manner in which athletic programs have 
been administered. Such scientific investigations as have 
been made fail to reveal any harmful effects from a sane 
participation by girls who are physically fit. On the other 
hand, exercise of the kind provided in basket-ball, field 
hockey, soccer, tennis, and indoor baseball have been 
shown to be extremely valuable in the development of 
adolescent girls. The main thing is to see as with boys that 
athletics are not overdone, that the supervision is constant 
and competent, and that no one is permitted to play who is 
not in fit condition to do so. 
Long experience has resulted in certain policies which it is 
a good idea to follow. First of all, if the parents object to a
-P-A-G-E-346
  332 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
girl taking part in any particular form of athletics she should 
be guided into something else. Second, there is not much 
need of inter-school athletic contests among girls. All the 
values can be obtained in inter-mural games, and a lot of 
trouble spared. Third, a woman should be appointed to as- 
sist the director of athletics, and she should have most of the 
responsibility for the girls’ activities. By no means should 
team play be surrendered because of narrow prejudices. 
Owing to the apparently stronger individualistic tendencies 
in girls, team or mass athletics should be stressed much more 
than individual performance. 
Fitting athletics into the school program. Owing to the 
transportation feature of the ‘consolidated school, athletic 
practice after regular school hours is no longer practicable. 
Athletics must have its regular part during the school day. 
This can be arranged for only by putting it on the daily 
program, as any other subject. When the weather is good 
and the playground can be used, all physical education can 
' be set for the same hour. Periods of twenty to forty-five 
minutes are generally endorsed, twice a day, at hours corre- 
sponding to the old-time recesses. In several of the Middle 
Western consolidated schools, physical education and play- 
ground activities are put in the forenoon, and athletics 
scheduled the last period in the afternoon. 
Financing athletics. Athletics has usually proved to be 
the best revenue producer of all the social activities. It is 
not believed, however, that all the income resulting from 
athletics should be spent upon athletics. It is far better to 
have a general financial manager for all student affairs. 
With the help of a committee he budgets the approved ac- 
tivities, and keeps all accounts of receipts and expenditures. 
What funds there may be on hand are appropriated as 
needed to finance the various activities. It is no small duty 
to educate students, who have operated on the traditional
-P-A-G-E-347
  
PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 333 
plan of every activity for itself, to the point where they will- 
ingly devote the school funds to the general good. 
Closely related to this problem is that of athletic equip- 
ment. Ordinarily it is purchased from money charged for 
admission to games. It is better to buy it directly from 
public funds. Whatever is done in this respect, the equip- 
ment is to be regarded as school property. If this idea is 
stressed, it will eliminate much of the carrying-off of athletic 
equipment now rather common in small high schools. In 
fact, it offers a good opportunity to cultivate respect for 
property rights. When the equipment is not in use it should 
be under lock and key, but the custody of the key may be 
entrusted to a group of students. The idea is to have the 
material accessible by those who want to use it, summer or 
winter, while school is in session or while it is out of session, 
but at the same time to make some one responsible for check- 
ing it out and in. 
Emblems, letters, and trophies for awards should as a rule 
be purchased from a general school fund. Nothing having 
any considerable intrinsic value should be given. Instead, 
the fact should be stressed that they are awards of honor, 
and the value lies in the social recognition of services ren- 
dered. 
It is not to be gainsaid that there is an element of danger 
in charging admission to athletic contests. Just as long as 
the school must depend upon the financial support of those 
who attend the contests, this element will exercise a good 
deal of influence upon school athletic policies. Much of the 
bad sportsmanship of the “win at any cost” type is directly 
traceable to the school’s dependence upon outside sources 
for its finances. Just as soon as possible the principal should 
make these activities independent. 
Eligibility rules. The eligibility of players on athletic 
teams should be regulated by rules. They may be drawn up
-P-A-G-E-348
    334 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
and adopted by the student council, but the principal 
should have the final word of approval. In the main, three 
elements should be considered. They are: (1) physical, 
(2) scholastic, and (3) social. Of the first, it is indisputable 
that no boy nor girl should be allowed to take part in any 
game who has not had a careful physical examination by 
some competent person and secured a certificate showing 
that his health will not be injured by the exercise. 
The usual scholastic standard for participation in inter- 
school games has been the successful carrying of three sub- 
jects. The explanation of this standard seems to be that 
any one doing less work is not a bona fide student. There 
should be no attempt in this restriction to prevent any one 
from getting needed physical development and citizenship 
training, nor to keep him from the enjoyment of the games 
and sports of the school. It is intended to keep persons 
from coming to school for the sole reason of playing on the 
school teams. At the same time, if athletics is a legitimate 
school enterprise, then participation should not be consid- 
ered a prize to be awarded only to the students who stand 
highest in algebra, Latin, and:English. Satisfactory mem- 
bership in the school should be sufficient. In other words, 
the eligibility requirements for athletics within the school 
should be exactly what they are for entrance to other activ- 
ities and subjects. 
By social eligibility is meant first of all good citizenship. 
It should be regarded as a distinct honor to represent the 
school in a contest or an exhibition. Students to be worthy 
of this honor should measure up to the student body 
standard of good citizenship. In determining this standard 
such things as school loyalty (evidenced by keeping training 
rules), morality, good sportsmanship, and attitude towards 
the work of the entire school should be counted. Any con- 
duct which smacks of professionalism should constitute in-
-P-A-G-E-349
  
PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 335 
eligibility. The Milwaukee Public School Baseball League 
has a most excellent code of rules which may be adopted 
almost as they stand. 
Before a student should be finally considered eligible the 
parents should consent to his competing in the sport. In 
order that there may be no mistaking the attitude of the 
parents, the consent should be over their signatures. A 
simple form on which the date, the name of the pupil, the 
sport, and the signatures of both parents may be written is 
all that is needed, the brief statement of consent to engage in 
the sport being printed. Oftentimes it is a good plan to 
print the eligibility rules, or the laws of good sportsmanship, 
on the back of the card. No student should be permitted to 
take part in inter-school contests against the wishes of his 
parents, nor should any encouragement be lent him to do so. 
The principal should always reserve the right to make the 
final decision as to the eligibility of any contestant, and 
should hold fearlessly to the letter and spirit of the rules in 
so doing. 
Educating the community. The principal may find his 
community badly in need of instruction in regard to the true 
purposes of athletics. It may depend almost altogether 
upon athletics for entertainment and excitement. It may 
want the contests to be spectacles in which vicious revenge 
upon neighboring towns is taken. If they fail to do this, 
the spectators insult the officials and annoy the players. In 
order to overcome such tendencies it is important to instill 
in the players habits and attitudes of genuine sportsman- 
ship. The conduct of the coach and the principal is con- 
tagious; they should never countenance rowdiness and dis- 
courtesy to visitors. If the coach has the confidence of the 
community it is a good plan to have him address the specta- 
tors briefly on sportsmanship before the games begin. The 
“write-ups” in the school and local papers should be such as 
 
-P-A-G-E-350
    336 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
to show disapproval of improper behavior. Such rules as 
the following, when published in the paper, read at assem- 
blies and before contests, and posted about the school will 
help in the work of education: 
ATHLETIC CouRTESY 
Our athletics should foster clean sport between gentlemen. It is 
the privilege and duty of every committee and person connected 
with the school to embody these principles in his own actions and 
to advocate them earnestly before others: 
(1) The rules of the games are to be regarded as mutual agree- 
ments, the spirit or letter of which no gentleman would break. The 
taking of advantage in sport is theft. 
(2) Visiting teams are to be honored guests of the home team, 
and should be treated as such. 
(3) No action is to be taken nor course of conduct pursued 
which would seem ungentlemanly or dishonorable if known to 
one’s opponents or to the public. 
(4) No advantages are to be sought over others except those in 
which the game is understood to show superiority. 
(5) Officers and opponents are to be regarded and treated as 
honest in intention. When opponents are evidently not gentlemen, 
and officers manifestly dishonest or incompetent, future relation- 
ships with them may be avoided. 
(6) Decisions of officials are to be abided by even when they seem 
unfair. 
(7) Ungentlemanly or unfair means are not to be used, even 
when they are used by opponents. 
(8) Good points in others should be appreciated and suitable 
recognition given. 
The athletic league. High standards in athletics result 
from organized effort. A county or district league is a neces- 
sary force in realizing the highest aims of the athletic pro- 
gram. This is the means, too, by which good officials, ap- 
proved by all members of the league, can be secured. This 
last is a matter which should not be postponed until a few 
minutes before the games begin. Very helpful suggestions 
on this and related questions of management may be found
-P-A-G-E-351
    PLAYGROUND AND GYMNASIUM 337 
in the little book entitled Recreative Athletics, published by 
Community Service. 
The league, assuming one is organized, can best function 
by legislating on the following matters: 
. The number of games to be played by each school. 
. The place and date of such games. 
. The eligibility rules for individuals and teams. 
. The kinds of sports in which contests shall be held. 
Rules for conducting games. 
Rules concerning the selection of officials. 
. A statement of the aims of athletics. 
. A statement of standards of conduct pertaining to spectators. 
. Selection of trophies and the adoption of rules for awarding 
them.

Measuring results of the playground program. It is ad- 
visable to check up at frequent intervals to see what progress 
has been made on the playground. Norms of achievement 
have been established for many events for both boys and 
girls. Thus in addition to selecting those who are superior, 
it can also be ascertained just how the school compares with 
the established standards. The three best tests available 
are: 
1. The Athletic Badge Test. 
2. The Decathlon Test. 
8. The Age Aim Tests of the Philadelphia Public Schools. 
All of these may be found in the manual on Recreative 
Athletics, heretofore referred to. A spring play-festival, in 
which tests of skill and strength in field and track events 
are combined with competitive exhibitions in folk dancing, 
may also be used as an opportunity to check up on the work 
of the year and to motivate future effort. 
Summary. Play activity should be as carefully planned 
as any part of the educational program, and is in every way 
an essential element in it. Definite purposes should be set 
up, and the curriculum prepared to realize the aims. All the
-P-A-G-E-352
  338 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
activities should be graded to the various stages of physical 
and social development. Athletics has a high place in the 
scheme of activities for both boys and girls. Like the or- 
dinary playground games they should be strictly supervised, 
and directed toward the significant goals of all education. 
Pupil initiative and leadership should be encouraged, and 
the older pupils given responsibility for helping in the direc- 
tion of the plays and games. All activities should be 
soundly financed, and great care taken to see that an ac- 
counting is rendered of all income. One of the objectives 
which should be repeatedly stressed is that of good sports- 
manship on the part of pupils and patrons. Special educa- 
tion may be required to develop this spirit. One of the 
valued means is that of an organized league comprising the 
schools located conveniently to each other. Finally, the 
playground must be justified by measurable satisfactions and 
results obtained.

CHAPTER XVII 
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 
The importance of supervision. In the judgment of compe- 
tent authorities supervision is the most important duty of 
the principal (see Chapter I). No matter how many other 
things he has to do, he falls far short of measuring up to the 
possibilities of his position if he fails to exercise a positive 
influence upon instruction. He is justified, not because he 
has obtained the conditions of effective instruction — good 
buildings, useful equipment, scientific classification, and 
regular attendance; but because by his efforts directly with 
the teachers he has helped to advance the learning of the 
pupils. In the first case he is concerned with obtaining the 
means upon which effective teaching depends; in the second 
case he is concerned with the ends of his leadership, to which 
the first are only preliminary. This being true, a principal 
of a modern rural school must be closely identified with the 
work of the teachers, and must here make his chief contribu- 
tion to educational progress. 
We are not lacking in specific evidence that good super- 
vision pays and pays well. As evidence, the experimental 
work of Courtis at Detroit and of Pittman in Dakota may 
be cited. Furthermore, we have the universal findings from 
school surveys to the effect that the striking differences ex- 
hibited as a result of scientific testing do not exist so much 
between classrooms as between buildings. These striking 
differences have been found where no differences in courses 
of study, teachers, pupils, and other relevant factors are 
found, so far as revealed by the surveys.! In the schools 
1 The Cleveland Surrey, The St. Louis Survey, and, in fact, almost any of 
the surveys where pedagogical testing has been Jone, furnish good examples 
of the tendency we have mentioned.
-P-A-G-E-356
  
342 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
making a poor showing it was also found that the teachers 
“had been given relatively little assistance in overcoming 
difficulties, and but slight stimulation in improving the 
quality of their work.” Criticism and comment have so 
centered attention upon supervision that the principal who 
wishes to be accounted a success must see to it that this 
part of his responsibility is well taken care of. There is no 
other part of his work which calls for so high an order of 
ability, and none which will bring so large returns to the 
school. 
The principal of the consolidated or village school is in a 
position where the wise planning of his supervisory program 
is especially essential. He works almost alone, in that he 
has not the stimulus, the assistance, and the support which 
go to the city school principal. The administrative de- 
mands, too, are relatively greater. The management of the 
transportation system alone gives him a problem which the 
city principal cannot parallel. If he is so happy as to have 
innate executive ability so much the better, as he can then 
clear up his administrative affairs early and get at the work 
of improving teaching. No innate capacity for supervision 
is likely to come to his aid; instead, it is a technique to be 
mastered by training. As Chancellor says, “A man may be 
a born executive, but he is a supervisor because of training.” 
The meaning of supervision. He should very early in his 
career form a clear concept of what supervision means. He 
should not accept any definition as final, but should look 
upon the term as one whose meaning is gradually unfolding 
and developing with the progress of the school, is often in 
need of re-definition, and always in need of interpretation. 
As we shall use the term here it signifies the professional 
activities of the principal occupied directly with the better- 
ment of the instructional work of the teachers under his 
charge. The requirements are nowhere shown more clearly 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
        PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 343 
than in the following criticism, taken from Report of The 
Portland Survey: * 
The majority of the principals seem lacking in the essentials of 
a good and helpful leader. By this we mean the ability to improve 
and develop teachers as teachers; to encourage and aid them in their 
particular work; to advise them as to better ways and methods; 
and to inspire them with confidence, and enthuse them for the work 
of instruction. 
Supervisory requirements. The point is clear enough 
that it is no sinecure to supervise a progressive school. If 
the superintendent does not know more than the teachers 
know about the actual process of teaching, he must at least 
have a good understanding of the meaning of what each 
teacher does, and its relation to the broad general purposes 
and principles of instruction. If his specific knowledge does 
not exactly duplicate the teachers’ he ought to be able to 
supplement the knowledge, skill, and understanding of 
teachers in order that they may learn from him. Unless he 
does have possession of this supplementary supply, the 
pupils will not advance one step faster in learning because of 
his presence. 
We have accepted as true the statement that teachers 
cannot teach the pupils what they (the teachers) do not 
know. It is as unmistakably true that the principal cannot 
teach to teachers what he does not know,? and that no ad- 
vantage accrues to the school if the scope of his knowledge 
1Cubberley, E. P. The Portland Survey, p. 35. 
2 All of which means that we must have and the future will see a new 
type of supervisor. He must recognize that first and above all the im- 
provement of instruction must begin with himself. A recognition of his 
personal responsibility will keep him alive intellectually. Himself the 
embodiment of modern specialized scholarship, it will be possible for him 
to advance the intellectual capacity of his faculty year after year. Ap- 
preciating that teachers cannot be left to sink or swim he will seek to im- 
prove them, not by elimination, but by leadership. (Coffman, L. D. 
National Education Association (1917), Proceedings, p. 193.) 
       
   
-P-A-G-E-358
  344 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
merely embraces what the teachers already know. He must 
know many things they do not know in order to lead. Ina 
real sense we can say that supervision is teaching. What 
the principal needs most of all in order to assume his rightful 
position of professional leadership is the following: 
1. A knowledge and understanding of the definite aims which 
the school should achieve — the only sound basis for a con- 
structive educational program. 
2. A definite knowledge of the best type of classroom procedure. 
8. A knowledge of the local situation, especially as applied to the 
upils. 
4. An ability to codperate with teachers, and to obtain their 
codperation. 
5. An energy in follow-up work that will make sure that school 
objectives are kept at persistently until they are attained. 
The principal’s problem. With supervision viewed in the 
light of a duty to help teachers to teach better, an analysis of 
the problem may be attempted. Three angles stand out 
most prominently. First, the principal must determine 
what teachers need the help which he is able to give. Sec- 
ond, he must know what kind of help each group of teachers 
or each individual teacher needs. Third and last, he must 
know how to give the help which is needed and to the teach- 
ers that need it. 
Strictly speaking, there will be no teacher in the force who 
does not in some way and at some time need assistance. 
This may be said of even the most competent teachers. If 
there is an upper limit to which teaching ability can reach, 
we do not know what itis. As long as there is a margin be- 
tween what the teacher is and what she might be there is 
an opportunity for helping. New problems are constantly 
arising; new and better methods of teathing are coming in 
every year. Notwithstanding the fact that all teachers may 
need help, the practical fact is that the principal should in 
general focus his efforts at places where they are needed
-P-A-G-E-359
  PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 345 
most. This is the best means of securing and keeping a 
uniformly progressing and unified school system. The 
second principle (over which the first generally takes prece- 
dence) is to center on those things which yield the greatest 
results. Basing our analysis of the problem mainly on the 
first principle, we find the following classes of teachers in 
need of assistance: 
1. Beginners. Both necessity and wisdom will lead the principal 
to take a few beginning teachers into his school each year. If 
he selects with discretion and then guides wisely, these teach- 
ers may soon be the best he has. They are usually possessed 
of a fresh point of view, are up to date on modern methods, 
are enthusiastic, and are willing to learn. On the other hand 
there are likely to be gaps in their technique, they may be 
altogether ignorant of many simple practical teaching re- 
quirements, and therefore may need special and consistent 
training. The principal should keep it clearly in mind that 
these teachers are just entering the profession in an active 
sense, and should shape his attitudes towards them, and his 
suggestions, to their needs and comprehension. 
Poorly prepared teachers. Either by accident or by design, the 
principal will also find untrained teachers in the corps. They 
may have been elected by the board because of political or 
economic influence, they may have deceived the appointing 
authorities, or they may have attended school the stipulated 
period but have failed to profit by it. Here, unless they are 
individuals of superior native ability, the instruction must be 
pitched on a rather low plane, and technique be built up from 
the very elements. If, in addition to being ignorant, the 
teacher is unaware of her ignorance, the helping activities of 
the principal are much more limited. 
Unprogressive teachers. In this class come teachers who have 
failed to grow. They may have started out fairly well and 
acquired fair habits of teaching, but have not changed a4 
newer methods and devices have come along. They may 
honestly believe the old ways are best, and have a distinct 
antipathy to new methods as fads. On the other hand, they 
may be willing to learn, but may have lacked the stimulation 
of real supervision. There are doubtless more teachers in a

  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
rut because no one has offered them a helping hand than 
because they choose the rut voluntarily. 
. Overloaded teachers. With our present unscientific method of 
assigning the teaching load there will be some teachers in al- 
most every system who are overburdened. As a consequence 
they may be doing inferior work, may be disheartened, and 
may be in serious need of aid. 
. Teachers with new problems. It is a well-known fact that the 
exigencies of the school situation often compel principals to 
call upon teachers to take up new duties, and that these may 
be duties for which they have had almost no preparation of 
any kind, and absolutely no special preparation. For exam- 
ple, a teacher trained in English may be called upon to take a 
class in first-year algebra. A teacher who has never coached 
a debate may have the full responsibility of training a team 
for the inter-school contest. One has, in a case like this, a 
near parallel to the first or to the second types — the begin- 
ners and the poorly prepared. The duty, too, which the 
principal owes the teacher in this situation is one that he 
should be keenly aware of. 
Types of problems. Teachers may also be classified ac- 
cording to the kinds of problems upon which they need help. 
Not all need the same kind of help, and not all need the same 
amount. The classification which should be made Here is 
vitally important, because it determines how and when the 
principal shall give his help. Three types may be found: 
Hs Common problems. Problems in which all the teachers need 
help, practically alike. The sensible conclusion growing out 
of this item is that the whole group may be instructed, on 
problems of this kind, at the same time and in the same way. 
Uniform written instructions, and group conferences or 
meetings, are the result. 
. Group problems. Problems in which a few teachers need 
help. To illustrate, consider teachers of the same subject or 
in the same department, or teachers who are alike in that they

8. Individual problems. This applies to problems of the individ- 
ual teacher, to personal problems, and to matters in which 
only one teacher is interested. Thus if there were only one 
beginner, one new teacher, one teacher who did not know how 
to supervise study, the principal would help her independently 
of the others. 
Finding out what help is needed. After the principal has 
analyzed the local situation in respect to type of teachers, 
so far as experience, training, and ability is concerned, he 
should turn his attention to finding out what specific kind of 
help each teacher needs. It is only when he has this definite 
information in his hands that he can plan his supervisory 
program. He must go to some reliable source or sources for 
his information. He should not wait until there is a revela- 
tion of needs from the sources themselves, but should em- 
bark upon a policy of finding out for himself. In doing this 
he will disregard much of the hearsay type of evidence of 
need. If he has to depend upon the school board, the pro- 
prietor of the village drug store, the milkman, the janitor, or 
upon what his wife picks up at the sewing circle for know- 
ledge of what is going on in school and what kind of help the 
teachers need, he is not doing his duty as a supervisor. By 
consequence he would, under such circumstances, be in- 
capable of putting a program of supervision into effect. In- 
formation of this sort can at best be no more than hints as to 
how the wind is blowing, and is not news to the wide-awake 
principal. 
Assuming, therefore, that the principal wants reliable 
data, he may get it in three leading ways: 
ts bi going to the teachers for it, or by having them come to 
im. 
2. By observing the teachers at work. 
8. By measuring results in terms of pupil progress. 
Going to the teachers. Before the principal can obtain an 
insight into the needs of the teachers from them personally,
-P-A-G-E-362
    
348 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
he must have their good will and their confidence. These 
are fully as essential before he can be of help to them, after 
he finds out what their needs are. He will therefore set him- 
self the task of establishing friendly relations with them. 
This is done first by having a sincere interest in their welfare, 
and in what they are trying to do. In his every act and 
word he should show his whole-hearted desire to codperate 
with them. He should invite them to bring their problems 
to him, and should manifest a lively interest in them. It is 
not his place to give offhand decisions, nor to assume the air 
of an oracle on all educational questions. Very many times, 
he may have to confess that he does not know. It should 
be his purpose, rather, to lead the teachers to be perfectly 
frank with him in respect to their teaching difficulties. 
The necessity of learning individual needs makes it im- 
possible for him to move very fast in developing his super- 
visory program. He must first of all get acquainted with 
the teachers, and lay a friendly if professional basis for co- 
operation. With the beginners and the teachers new to the 
system he may work a little faster. The first group will feel 
dependent upon him from the first; the second will also per- 
force come to him for guidance. With teachers who have 
been in the schools for some time, the principal will work 
slowly while new until the restraint due to the meeting of 
new personalities has worn off. 
After a feeling of confidence has been established the prin- 
cipal should begin his more formal investigation of needs. 
At one of the meetings of the general group he may ask the 
teachers to submit a list of things in which they would ap- 
preciate assistance.! If he feels hesitant about doing this he 
1 At Seattle, Washington, the teachers were asked to indicate how the 
principal could help them. The problems which they listed, and per- 
centages, were as follows: (1) In developing the higher human qualities, 
60 per cent; furnishing supplies and equipment, 50 per cent; with the ex-
-P-A-G-E-363
     
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 349 
may, in ordinary conversation with the teachers individ- 
ually, ask what he can do to help them. A mimeographed 
form may be devised, with a list of tasks in which teachers 
often require help. The teachers may be requested to turn 
in one of the forms with the items checked in which they 
want aid. After this is once done it becomes more or less a 
matter of routine which should be taken up with the opening 
of each school year. Even though the teachers feel per- 
fectly free to go to the principal personally with a statement 
of their needs, he should not dispense with the more formal 
method of getting at and recording their demands. As 
an illustration of method, see the accompanying form on 
page 350. 
Several investigations as to teacher needs have been 
made. One of the interesting findings concerns problems 
which appear fairly constantly. From our list above we 
could pick out a small number which would include seventy- 
five per cent of the needs of which teachers are conscious. 
Teachers most frequently need help, according to their own 
statement, in: 
1. Directing study. 
. Making assignments. 
. Holding the attention of the pupils. 
Asking questions. 
. Keeping the pupils interested. 
. Finding supplementary materials,

     PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 351 
discovering the needs of teachers is by observing them at 
work. At the opening of school the visits may be brief, and 
are mainly for the purpose of getting teachers and pupils ac- 
customed to the presence of the principal in the room. If 
his examination is not too searching and his stay not too 
long, it will have a better effect than if he tries to analyze the 
whole teaching procedure the first week or so. In general, it 
will be better for him while visiting to make himself as in- 
conspicuous as possible. He should not offer to take the 
class, he should not make suggestions to the teacher, and he 
should not interrupt the recitation with questions or com- 
ments. He should come into the room quietly and unob- 
trusively, remain quiet, and leave without creating any 
confusion. 
A little later he may make his visits more systematic. 
This requires planning in advance. In general, four steps 
are involved: 
1. The preparation of a visiting schedule. 
2. The agreement with teachers upon the aims and objectives of 
the subjects. 
8. The securing of teachers’ plans. 
4. The recording of results of observation. 
The visiting schedule. There are several ways in which 
the visiting schedule may be planned. The principal may 
decide to follow the teaching of a subject through the 
school, as, for example, mathematics. Or again he may 
prefer to divide his time among departments, as the pri- 
mary, intermediate, ete. With the programs of the teachers 
before him, the principal rules and fills out a memorandum 
form somewhat like that shown on page 352. 
By filling in the blank spaces with the room numbers, or 
the initials of the teachers, he has his schedule prepared. In 
the meantime, at a general meeting of the teachers, the 
leading aims of the subjects (putting in advance the one

second phase for agreement has to do with the specific lines 
of improvement aimed at for the year. To illustrate, the 
results of the second type of conference with the teachers 
may be as follows: Z 
Reading — Principal aim. Correction of labored “word 
reading.” 
Remedy. Introduction of silent reading, with 
emphasis upon concentration and thought-getting. 
Materials. Several easy texts with content that is 
interesting to the children. 
Teachers’ plans. Nothing elaborate in the way of teach- 
ers’ lesson plans should be insisted upon. Their leading pur- 
poses (in addition to insuring preparation) are to inform the 
principal of the teacher’s aim and the assignment, and, if 
rightly used by the teacher, their organization may help her 
in planning future work. A form which will permit of the 
making of a duplicate for the principal has been found very 
satisfactory. They are made out for each subject a week 
in advance, and should reach the principal not later than 
Monday morning of the week they are to be used. ‘The 
form below is suggested:

Under the column headed “Remarks” the teachers may 
write comments on their success with the plan, or anything 
that will be of help when the same subject is taken up again. 
The principal may use the same space for notes as to the 
suitability of the assignment, suggestions which were made 
to the teacher, or the success which the teacher achieved. 
With beginning teachers he may wish to call a pre-confer- 
ence to make suggestions or criticisms of their plans. This 
pre-teaching conference is usually more profitable to the 
teacher than the post-teaching conference proves to be. 
The duplicates for the week should be filed in a convenient 
form for the principal to carry about with him as he visits 
the rooms, or he should have access to the teacher’s copies 
when he goes to her room. His observation is not likely to 
be very reliable and searching if he does not know what the 
teacher is trying to do. 
Recording the results. The fourth requirement is to 
record the results of his observations. This information is 
wanted by the principal because of tWe use he can make of it 
in helping the teacher. This will be the guiding principle 
that determines what he writes down and what he leaves 
out. At all events, his notes will be brief and to the point. 
They will deal with two or three points at the most, and have 
specific reference to what the teacher is trying todo. Itisa 
matter of little moment whether the notes are recorded 
while in the room and observing or not, provided the teach- 
ers fully recognize the object of the principal and trust him.
-P-A-G-E-368
354 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
As some of the teachers will be sensitive about note-taking 
in their presence, it is better for the principal to defer the 
duty until he has left the room. The obligation of keeping 
the points in his memory will prevent his confusing the 
teacher with too many suggestions, and make him more alert 
to essentials. A form that will meet the demands of the 
situation is illustrated below:

These should be so arranged that only a check mark is

management, and material. Assuming that a card will 
ordinarily serve a week’s program, the form may be illus-

PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 355 
Testing. As the results of the teacher’s efforts show up in 
some degree in the measurable abilities of the pupils, the 
principal may use the method of testing the pupils to find 
out what the teacher needs. This does not mean that the 
principal should do the testing. The poorest kind of super- 
vision there is results from an examination system that is 
imposed on the teachers by the principal, who prepares the 
questions and checks the answers. The testing materials 
should be prepared by the teacher, except when standard 
devices are being used; should be checked by her; and 
should be analyzed for pupil needs and teaching defects. 
The principal can help by examining the test items before 
they are given, offering suggestions for their improvement, 
and also by analyzing results to get at the causes or explana- 
tion if either good or unsatisfactory. 
In the daily visitation, it should be kept in mind that em- 
phasis is to be put upon method and procedure. In other 
words, the principal studies how the teacher works. In 
testing, on the other hand, he concerns himself with results. 
One supplements the other. The principal cannot rest con- 
tent with simply getting good results as measured by the 
kind of tests we now have. Results may cost entirely too 
much in unmeasured values to justify them. He must also 
find out whether the methods themselves are such that they 
contribute to the children’s satisfaction in school and to 
their genuine welfare. Keeping in mind the fact that re- 
sults are to be analyzed for the purpose of finding out the 
needs of the teacher, as well as to promote pupil progress, 
the principal can proceed as follows: 
1. To help the teacher prepare ordinary examination questions. 
While he can do most good in helping shape the form of the 
test items, he can also see whether things that are worth 
while are tested, whether the tests are of reasonable length of 
not, and whether they sample a variety of abilities — mem- 
ory, power to organize, reason, judgment, etc.  
-P-A-G-E-370
356 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
2. To help the teacher prepare more reliable examinations. The 
true-false, multiple-choice, single-answer, and completion 
tests are illustrative. 
3. To help the teacher find and use standard diagnostic tests. 
What the principal will find. In a previous paragraph we 
pointed out in what things teachers claim to need help. In 
the same way, as a result of observation and testing, we get 
some light upon what points the teachers really need as- 
sistance. From feports on observation we have a general 
list of help-needs, as follows: 
1. How to prepare in advance for their daily work. 
2. How to make definite and clear-cut assignments. This means 
to tell the pupils what to do, where to get materials, and 
where to find supplementary matter for the brighter pupils. 
. How to motivate lessons — that is, to give pupils an object 
for studying. 
.. How to economize time in starting to work, and in getting and 
passing materials. 
. How to hold the attention of all the class on the matter at 
hand. 
. How to keep the pupils who are not reciting busy on their 
own work. 
7. Make it possible for pupils to work together. 
8. How to have a definite aim which they try to realize. 
  Results from testing are harder to classify. The whole 
minutia of teaching comes to the surface here, and teacher 
and pupil difficulties are likely to be closely intermingled. 
Defects will also vary with the grade of the pupils, and with 
the subjects themselves. For a detailed account of diagnosis 
by testing, the reader is referred to Monroe’s Measuring the 
Results of Teaching, or Brooks’s Improving Schools by 
Standardized Tests. As an illustration of the needs which 
standardized tests may reveal, consider the following re- 
commendations which grew out of the application of certain 
reading tests:
-P-A-G-E-371
  
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 357 
The teacher should take these steps to improve the work of the 
Pee Cis ahaa grade class in reading: 
1. Motivate the reading by giving stars or other awards, grant 
special privileges to the best readers, post lists of pupils doing 
outside reading, and compare individual standings with the 
standards. 
Stress reading for meaning. The use of cards and charts, 
reading for answers, reading at home, summarizing reading, 
introduce much easy reading, and emphasize reading of direc- 
tions for making things, or rules for playing games. 
8. Developing a reading vocabulary by giving much new and 
fresh material, centering attention upon new and important 
words, reproduction of matter read, and conscious study of 
unknown words. Word analysis is a valuable device from the 
fourth grade up. 
4. Adaptation to individual differences. Access to books of dif- 
ferent levels of difficulty and with great variety of subject- 
matter. Supervised silent reading instead of the ordinary 
recitation with pupils reading orally. 
5. Socialized activities. The reading club or library club is illus- 
trative. 
6. Economy of time by reading for answers, getting at the heart 
of the selection, and skimming. 
7. Keeping the bright pupils busy by outlining individual and 
special-group reading projects. 
Summary. Educational authorities state that super- 
vision is the most important duty of the principal. It has 
been found to be a profitable investment for the schools. In 
a consolidated school, where the principal is called upon for 
so much administrative work, he cannot find time to super- 
vise unless he plans wisely. He needs a clear and definite 
concept of what is to be accomplished by supervision. The 
term is used here to signify the process of helping teachers to 
improve their instruction. In planning the program the 
principal needs to know: (1) what teachers need help, (2) 
what kind of help each needs, and (3) how to give the help. 
The first questions may be answered through direct in-
-P-A-G-E-372
  358 
  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
quiries, visitation, testing, and general observation. Once 
he has informed himself as to the needs he should plan his 
supervisory program in accord with them. 
10. EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
. Give some reasons why supervision should be clearly distinguished 
from administration. 
. Define supervision. In the light of your definition, would you class 
making a course of study as an administrative or a supervisory func- 
tion? In which field does grading and classifying pupils belong? 
. Show the need of distinguishing teachers according to individual 
needs if the supervisory work of the principal is to be done most suc- 
cessfully? 
. Make up a list of problems (a) in which all teachers are likely to need 
help, (6) in which only a few teachers will need help. 
. Should the principal mainly confine his effort to help teachers to 
things in which the teachers feel the need of help? Discuss. 
. Give reasons why the principal of the consolidated or village school 
should plan his supervisory activities very carefully. 
. State the advantages of using the test method in order to find out 
what kind of help teachers need. 
. Point out the limitations in the method of going to the teacher for 
insight into her needs. What are the advantages? 
. To what extent should the principal ask teachers to outline their 
teaching plans for his inspection? For what purpose should they be 
asked to prepare plans at all? 
Why is it more important for a principal new to a school to give much 
time to finding out what the teachers need before attempting to help 
them than for a principal who is acquainted with the school? _

  CHAPTER XTX 
CARRYING OUT THE SUPERVISORY PROGRAM © 
Methods of helping. The inspection which has been de- 
scribed in the preceding chapter is only preliminary to the 
real supervisory work of the principal. With the more en- 
terprising teachers it is only necessary to reveal their needs 
to them, and they will take the initiative in applying 
remedial measures. The less capable and the beginners will 
need definite suggestions for improvement. Even in the 
case of the superior teachers there is still something to do, as 
they cannot do alone all that ought to be done. In general, 
there are four methods of helping and inspiring which the 
principal can use. They are: 
1. Telling teachers what to do, and better methods of doing it. 
- This implies conferences, discussions, oral instructions, and 
meetings. 
2. Putting reading materials at their command. This includes 
magazines, books, and such letters, circulars, syllabi, and in- 
structions as the principal himself may prepare. 
8. Demonstration teaching — that is, showing the teachers new 
and better ways of teaching. 
4. Analyzing problems and conducting investigations which will 
result in the teacher finding her own way out. 
Whatever the method that is followed, the principal 
should take care to distinguish between suggestions and in- 
structions. One of the writers knew a principal who failed 
to do this. He also prided himself upon holding a tight rein 
over his teachers. His method of suggestion was very sub« 
tle, and it would have been an ingenious teacher indeed who 
could have told whether he was giving directions or ridicul- 
ing a new idea. As a result the teachers were confused,
-P-A-G-E-374
  360 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
They did not know what to do, and, when he afterward 
criticized them openly for failing to adopt his “ideas” the 
teachers rebelled. First, it must be clear then that sugges- 
tions are to be followed at the discretion of the teacher. 
She is not to be condemned because she does not accept 
them at all. Her understanding of the situation may be 
such that she feels confident her own methods are superior to 
those favored by the principal. Furthermore, although the 
plan formulated by the principal may not have appeared in 
full in her practice, she may nevertheless have profited by 
his ideas. She may have combined his suggestions with her 
own thinking with a resulting product superior to the 
original idea. 
On the other hand, teachers should be given to understand 
that instructions are invariably to be followed. Failure to 
do this, outside of exceptional circumstances, is unpardon- 
able, and if repeated should constitute good cause for dis- 
missal. The teachers should understand that so far as sug- 
gestions are concerned they have freedom to follow their 
own best judgment while instructions are to be obeyed, and 
they should know when the principal is making suggestions 
as distinct from his issuing instructions.’ Principals some- 
times censure teachers for not following suggestions, when 
because of rather dull perceptive powers they have been un- 
aware that suggestions were being given. In order to be 
counted diplomatic, the principal is often so indefinite in his 
suggestions that they are not even perceived. The teacher 
certainly should not be blamed for the principal’s short- 
comings. 
Two or three general rules should be followed that will en- 
able teachers to identify instructions. As a general prac- 
tice, they should be written. If teachers are informed that 
they will be expected to follow instructions quite literally, 
and these are printed or mimeographed under the title
-P-A-G-E-375
  
CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 361 
“Instructions,” they will have no excuse for overlooking or 
disobeying them. In the same way it may be understood 
that matters which are put before the teachers’ meetings for 
consideration, are, when approved, binding upon the whole 
group in the same way that written instructions are, and, in 
fact, may be issued as such. This also applies to definite 
directions given to the teachers in conference. - 
The conference method. As the conference method is 
often depended upon for instructing teachers, a few words 
may be written of its technique. With beginning and weak 
teachers especially, conferences, both before and after visita- 
tion, are desirable. With the stronger teachers the post- 
visitation conference only is necessary. This does not sig- 
nify a conference after every daily visit, but rather a fairly 
complete conference after a visitation project which may 
last a week or more has been finished. The pre-conference 
is very valuable because the teacher recognizes from it that 
the principal is sharing with her in the responsibility for a 
successful recitation, and she comes to codperate more 
cheerfully and works with more confidence. The main 
points to observe in the conference are as follows: 
1. Let the place of the conference be determined by the mutual 
convenience of teacher and principal. The teacher feels more 
at home in her own room, and it has the added advantage of 
being the place where the teaching which is the subject of dis- 
cussion took place. 
2. Pre-conferences are better held before school opens. The 
post-conferences can come after dismissal. The early days of 
the week are to be recommended for the post-conference. 
8. Set a definite hour, be there on time, and go to work at once. 
Do not prolong the conference. A half-hour is generally long 
enough. 
4. Center upon one thing, and keep the discussion on the 
subject. 
5. Be sparing in adverse criticism, and never indulge in it at all 
unless it is followed by a constructive remedial suggestion.
-P-A-G-E-376
  362 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
6. Keep your temper, confine yourself to the facts of the case, 
and give attention to essentials. 
7. Take time, if required, to get the point of view of the teacher. 
The teachers’ meeting. There are two kinds of teachers’ 
meetings the principal should plan for. The first is the 
business meeting, in which administrative details are taken 
up. - This will not be discussed here further than to say that 
it should in no wise be allowed to creep into the professional 
meetings. A short business meeting (fifteen minutes) is 
desirable every two weeks, but need not be held regularly. 
Professional meetings should be held regularly, at least once 
every two weeks, and may last not longer than one hour. 
Usually no improvement results in meetings that are pro- 
longed beyond the period mentioned. Here again, the 
maxim — begin on time and quit on time — is pertinent. 
Never wait for a teacher before beginning, and do not ac- 
cept the excuse that the teacher was detained with a pupil 
or to do some school work. On the afternoon given to a 
meeting, it is well to understand that it takes precedence 
over everything else. 
A proper appreciation of the connection between worth- 
while meetings and the success of the school should be real- 
ized. If the principal cannot get along agreeably with the 
teachers in the professional meetings, he cannot get along 
with them in the classrooms or on the playground. The 
writers have witnessed a striking illustration of the speed 
with which school morale may go down due to inefficient 
management of teachers’ meetings. The principal was new 
to the school, while many of the teachers had seen years of 
service in it. He was: positive and domineering. Being 
prevented from bringing much of this spirit into the class- 
room by the necessity of carrying a heavy teaching load, he 
manifested it in the meetings. He lectured and criticized 
the group, with many a caustic allusion for the faults of the
-P-A-G-E-377
CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 363 
few. He was keen in pointing out defects which he felt, so 
he stated, he was in duty bound to bring before the school 
board. Two-hour sessions were the rule. At first the teach- 
ers said nothing, though even an ordinary observer could 
have gathered from the buzzing conferences in corridors and 
rooms that they were exasperated. At last one of them 
struck back at some particularly offensive remark of the 
principal. From that time on until the middle of the year, 
when at the order of the school board all meetings were sus- 
pended, there was constant and malicious bickering and 
quarreling, dispute, and controversy. Had it not been that 
the teachers counseled patience, he would have been dis- 
missed at the middle of the year. As it was he held on in- 
effectually and without authority until the end of the year, 
when dismissal brought his administrative career to a close. 
The causes for failure doubtless in this case lay in the per- 
sonality of the principal. Nevertheless, there is such criti- 
cism of teachers’ meetings that one may question whether 
the faults in the main may not be ascribed to defects in 
planning. The most serious of all defects is the lack of a 
constructive program. When the positive side of teaching is 
emphasized, and when, in the words of one teacher, “the 
meetings get some place,” then there is good-will and real 
improvement. The principles which follow are designed to 
help in managing meetings successfully: 
1. Prepare programs a half-year or more in advance. It is a 
good idea to appoint as many committees at the first of the 
year as there are meetings, and have each committee report its 
plans early. Although the principal should preside, the com- 
mittees should lead in carrying out their respective programs. 
2. Topics should be selected with a view to the interests and 
needs of all the teachers. The previous inspectional work will 
serve a good turn here. 
8. The meetings should be relatively informal, and free discus - 
sion should be encouraged. As the teachers are pretty well
-P-A-G-E-378
    364 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
worn out by the end of the day, it is a good plan to have a re- 
freshment committee to serve tea. This may be made up of 
high-school girls. 
4. After school is a better time than before school for professional 
meetings, and the first days of the week are better than the 
last days. Of all days Friday is the poorest. 
A plan of action should be normally expected as a result of 
every meeting. If teachers get the view that “something is 
going to be done about it” they will take more interest in the 
mectings. r 
6. The principal should not attempt to dominate the meeting, 
but should keep his views somewhat in the background. His 
efforts should be focussed on getting a fair and impartial con- 
sideration of the problems, based upon the possession and 
proper interpretation of the facts. = 
Planning programs. If one observes the principles which 
we have given, he will not plan programs that are simply 
duplicates of those followed. in other schools. However, 
there will be some things in common, and hints may be ob- 
tained from an examination of what others are doing and 
havedone. The projects which follow are those that formed 
a five-year program for teachers’ meetings in a school in 
which one of the writers was principal, and, while they re- 
present an evolution rather than a plan that was clear from 
the beginning, will do to illustrate the type of work that may 
be carried out. 
I. First year: 
1. Revised course of study in history. 
2. Developed principles of teaching silent reading. 
3. Prepared a list of supplementary reading for the grades, 
and added the material to the library. 
4. Prepared a health program for the schools. 
TI. Second year: 
1. Worked out a list of equipment requirements for the 
schools. 
2. Revised the rules and regulations for the school. 
8. Developed a new course of study in nature study 
geography, and general science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
  CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 365 
4. Adopted a plan for supervising study, and limiting 
home-study assignments. 
5. Prepared a list of books and magazines for the profes- 
sional library. 
Til. Third year: 
1. Revised the course of study in reading. 
2. Took up the scientific measurement of ability in spelling 
and penmanship. 
8. Commenced use of the project method. 
4. Studied intelligence testing, and appointed a committee 
to learn the technique of testing. 
5. Reorganized and expanded the extra-curricular program. 
IV. Fourth year: 
1. Studied attendance. 
2. Made a new course of study in health and hygiene. 
8. Studied reading tests. 
4. Visual instruction developed. 
5. Aims of education presented, as basis for curriculum 
reorganization. 
V. Fifth year: 
1. Developed the socialized method. 
2. Studied methods and aims in language teaching. 
8. Speech correction was taken up. 
4. Moral education considered. 
5. How to get and hold interest. 
6. Presented how to make assignments, 
7. Showed results of mental testing. 
8. Teaching of literature. 
9. Dramatization. 
10. Scholarship contests. 
11. Scientific marking. 
12. Standard test results shown. 
Using written aids. Magazines and professional books 
are invaluable aids to teacher improvement. Every con- 
solidated and village school should have its professional 
library. The board ought to pay for a few new books and a 
few standard magazines each year. There is no better way 
to secure big profits on a small investment. The material 
should be kept in the school library, or in a room convenient
-P-A-G-E-380
366 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
to all the teachers. A standing committee of teachers to 
look after the library, and especially to see that new books 
are selected as there is money to pay for them, is advisable. 
Most of the teachers will be willing to bring in some of their 
own books and magazines and put them at the disposal of 
the group. There should also be copies of courses of study, 
school reports, and surveys on the shelves. As new books 
and magazines are received they should be reviewed, briefly, 
before the meeting by teachers appointed for the purpose. 
Such reviews should always be short, and be designed to 
give the teachers an inkling into the content so that they 
may decide whether it is worth their while to read it or not, 
and what parts are worth while. 
With the help of the teachers, the principal may send out 
several helpful printed aids. In some schools a little 
monthly journal is mimeographed, containing announce- 
ments, names of new books, lists of articles in the current 
magazines, little descriptions of devices, special-day pro- 
grams, and the like. The list below covers, in fairly com- 
plete way, the minimum essentials of printed or mime- 
ographed information which the principal should supply to 
each teacher: 
. List of textbooks required. 
. List of supplementary reading material. 
. Directions for keeping plan-book, with illustration. 
. Directions for use of library. 
. Directions for getting supplies. 
. Directions for reporting. 
School calendar, with dates of teachers’ meetings. 
Teacher-rating card. 
. Supplementary course of study sheets. 
. Model lesson outline. 
. List of visual instruction material. 
. List of professional books and magazines in the library.

Demonstration teaching. Teaching is plainly an art. It

CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 867 
is best learned by doing. The next best way is by watching 
some one else do it. Demonstrations are far more convinc- 
ing than theory. These must be largely depended upon at 
ail times, and they are of first importance when introducing 
new methods. There are four ways of organizing demon- 
strating teaching: 
1. The principal may go to the room of a particular teacher and 
conduct a class. 
2. The teacher may be sent to visit another room and see a 
demonstration by the class teacher. 
8. The principal or a teacher may demonstrate before the whole 
roup. 
4. rah a may be brought in to demonstrate before the 
group. 
Group demonstration is more economical than individual 
demonstration, therefore the general principle should be 
observed of having the teaching done before all the teachers 
where possible. Demonstrations before single individuals 
are, however, necessary. ‘They have the great value of 
showing what can be done in the everyday environment and 
under school conditions. The rules which should be fol- 
lowed are much the same in any case, and include taking 
such precautions as the following: 
1. Preserve the usual conditions such as size of group, length of 
period, and kind of materials. It would not be a convincing 
demonstration that accorded the demonstrator the advantage 
of picking his pupils, cutting down or lengthening the period, 
or bringing in apparatus unavailable under other circum- 
stances. 
%. Make sure that the purpose of the demonstration is under- 
stood in advance of the actual showing, outlining the process, 
and anticipating the reactions. 
8. Have an informal discussion following the demonstration, 
where questions are asked, suggestions made, and decisions 
reached as to the values of the method. 
The preparation and the summing-up of procedure and
-P-A-G-E-382
  
368 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
results are aspects that should not be neglected. In order 
that the teachers may observe and discuss intelligently a list 
of points, in the form of questions, may be put upon the 
board. As an illustration we give the following: 
. What was the aim of the teacher? 
. How did she motivate the study? 
. Was the assignment clear and adequate? 
. What means did she use to accomplish her aims? 
. What were the greatest needs of the children, as revealed by 
this demonstration? 
. What evidence can you cite that the pupils made progress in 
knowledge, skill, or ideals in the course of the lesson? 
. Was the routine well organized and managed? 
. Were opportunities given for codperation? 
. Were individual differences recognized? 
. What suggestions can you make for the improvement of the 
teaching?

Exchange visiting. Instead of the principal’s giving a 
demonstration before the classroom teacher, he may send 
her to observe in another room, or even in another school. 
While she is visiting, he should take her class or put it in 
charge of a substitute. The values that will accrue from 
this method, as from the others, depends upon: (1) the 
teacher’s knowing what she is to look for; (2) a careful 
analysis afterwards of what she has observed: (3) prepara- 
tion in advance by the demonstrator; and (4) efforts to put 
the good into practice. Visiting is no more economical of 
time than individual demonstration by the principal, but has 
a value at times in that, if a teacher has developed a particu- 
larly good technique, not only will the visiting teacher learn 
from it, but the demonstrator will also receive some de- 
served recognition. 
To be profitable, exchange visiting should be carried on by 
schedule. A busy principal will probably not be able to 
send his teachers to visit more than three times a year. She
-P-A-G-E-383
  CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 369 
will be given a chance to visit the grade above her own, the 
one below, and, if there are two sections of each grade, she 
may visit in the grade she is teaching. Where there is de- 
partmental organization, exchange visiting is mainly val- 
uable when carried on with another school. As this is time- 
consuming, it cannot be a very significant method of de- 
monstrating. 
Analytic measurement. The last method of helping 
teachers that will be considered here is that of diagnostic 
measurement. We have already treated that phase of it 
which is known as pupil-measurement. We shall now con- 
fine ourselves to teacher-measurement, or, as it is better 
known, teacher-rating. 
Rating systems are in disrepute among teachers. The 
reasons for this are that so many forms are unreliable, and 
that a reliability has been claimed for them which they do 
not possess. There has also been a tendency to make a 
single form serve too many uses, and teachers have resented 
in particular the use of any device that might have the ef- 
fect of depriving them of their jobs. In putting in a rating 
system for the purpose of improving teaching, the principal 
will find it wise to act very discreetly. 
Introducing rating. First of all, the principal should 
recognize that there are several purposes which rating cards 
may serve. First, they may be used in selecting teachers. 
Second, they may be used to determine whether teachers 
shall be promoted or dismissed. Third, they may help to 
diagnose the teaching process and the needs of teachers — 
thus becoming valuable devices in the supervisory plan. 
The first decision which the principal should make from the 
preceding is that he will not use the same form for the two or 
three purposes which rating forms serve. He will use one 
form for rating applicants, another for determining efficiency 
nd promotion or dismissal, and still a third for an improve- 
      
    
     
   
            
    
             
-P-A-G-E-384
  370 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
ment device. Our concern here is with the last. Suffice it 
to say here that rating-card results alone should not be de- 
pended upon for the first two purposes. 
As teacher improvement is a codperative affair, the teach- 
ers should help prepare the rating card. At an early meeting 
show them samples of cards, explain to them the use to 
which such a card may be put, and even give them mime- 
ographed copies to examine and apply to their own work. 
A little later, you may ask them to give you a self-rating, 
indicating that the results will be kept confidential. When 
they have become quite well accustomed to the device, sug- 
gest that a committee be appointed to draft a form for the 
use of the school. 
Type of form. For the purpose we have indicated, a 
rather detailed card should be used. The work of the com- 
mittee will be furthered if a meeting is first given to the 
analysis of teaching efficiency. At the end of the discus- 
sion, or a week later, teachers may hand in a list of items 
which they believe should be included on the card. A good 
example of an analytic device is found in Johnston’s The 
Modern High School (pp. 400-01); another in Cubberley’s 
The Principal and His School (p. 481). After an examina- 
tion of the local situation and an acquaintance with local 
needs, the principal can add other worth-while items. It is 
better to develop the rating card with the teachers than to 
adopt a form already prepared, even if the new form 
modifies ever so slightly the old one. The teachers will 
have gained something by a consideration of the problem, 
and will have a better attitude toward the plan. Items, 
such as those found on page 368 in this chapter, are perti- 
nent. 
A choice of two methods is offered for the arrangement of 
the items. They are: (1) the score card, and (2) the scale. 
The form in Johnston’s book is a good example of the score
-P-A-G-E-385
CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 371 
eard. The form in Cubberley’s book illustrates the scale. . 
The latter is preferable because it is more reliable, and be- 
cause it carries the analysis to a more advanced point. 
Using the rating card. After the form is prepared, the 
teachers should first rate themselves. The principal should 
check over the results, and prepare himself to help the 
teachers improve the points on which they believe them- 
selves to be weak. By building his improvement program 
upon the felt needs of the teachers, he will have a basis for 
codperation superior to the basis obtained through his own 
ratings. By this plan he can take account of individual 
differences in the needs, and of needs which are common to 
all. If all express a need for help in improving assignments, 
directing study, or perfecting certain elements of routine, he 
can plan a campaign or drive that should get results. Only 
after the teachers are accustomed to the rating idea will the 
principal attempt to check them, and his main purpose then 
will be to find out whether his supervisory efforts are meet- 
ing with success. 
Teacher-ratings should be open to the inspection of the 
teacher concerned. No rating should be brought before the 
board, because of the agreement with the teachers that the 
device should be used for supervision only. It may be the 
basis of individual conferences with individual teachers. 
The principal will have no hesitancy in talking over his 
rating, provided he has definite directions to give for im 
provement. If he does not have these, he may tell the 
teacher this candidly and suggest that she try to work out 
her own salvation. 
Final suggestions. The supervisory problem is so broad, 
and knowledge to be useful must be so detailed, that it is out 
of the question to discuss very many points. As a supple- 
ment to those we have enumerated, we finally list a number 
of supervisory directions. These are more or less of minor
-P-A-G-E-386
372 
  ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
importance if attended to, but vastly significant if ignored. 
For example: 
is Give credit to the teachers for noteworthy effort. Take op- 
portunity to compliment the teacher, and tell others — the 
board, the patrons, and other teachers — of any unusually 
successful teaching. Do not seek to take the glory for every 
brilliant idea that comes out in school practice. 
- Do not call attention to yourself by voice or manner when 
visiting a classroom. Loud talking, boisterous laughter, or 
anything approaching a rowdy manner are out of place. 
They are sure to lose you the respect and the good-will of both 
pupils and teachers. 
. Defer to the teacher, and ask her permission before making an 
announcement, asking a question, or in any way taking part 
in the recitation. 
. Do not interrupt class exercises except for very unusually 
good reasons. It is a bad sign for all work to stop when the 
principal steps into the room, and the pupils begin to look ex- 
pectantly at each other for something out of the common run 
—a speech, a recitation, or a joke. 
. Do not take charge of a recitation unless previous arrange- 
ment has been made, and then use the occasion to give a de- 
monstration of some device or method for the benefit of the 
teacher. 
. Do not leave a note of criticism, nor make any remark that re- 
flects adversely upon the teacher. No criticism should be 
voiced except in private conference with the teacher con- 
cerned, and not then unless a constructive suggestion also is 
made. 
. Do not ask that the regular program be changed in any way 
for your benefit. If there is some particular reason why this 
principle should be ignored, the teacher should know why the 
change is requested and in advance of the time she is to make 
it. 
. Do not throw a gloom over the pupils’ day by being stern and 
reproving when visiting a classroom. 
Summary. There are four methods of helping teachers. 
They are: (1) the telling, (2) the reading, (3) the demon- 
stration, and (4) the investigating. Each has its values, de-
-P-A-G-E-387
  CARRYING OUT THE PROGRAM 3873 
pending upon the teacher and the circumstance. Instruc- 
tions and suggestions should be plainly marked off from 
each other. Suggestions may or may not be obeyed, as the 
teacher sees fit; instructions should be followed faithfully. 
On this account, they should be written. Of the telling 
method, the conference and the meeting are most impor- 
tant. The success of the latter depends largely upon care 
in planning. The reading method may take advantage of 
professional materials in books and magazines, and forms 
and devices prepared by the principal. Demonstration 
werk may be done by the principal or by teachers, and 
it may be before a group of teachers or before one. The 
first is more economical of time and is somewhat more stim- 
ulating. The fourth method is illustrated here by analytic 
measurement. While not altogether reliable, it induces 
teachers to concentrate their effort for improvement upon 
definite objectives. 
EXERCISES AND PROBLEMS 
1. What are the values of the principal’s demonstrating before the in- 
dividual teacher? The disadvantages? 
2. Show why the principal should not make it a point to take over the 
class every time he visits a room. 
8. Is there any reason you can think of why teachers should not be called 
upon to give and check over standard tests? Does this take more 
time than the giving and reading of formal essay examinations? 
4, Give the objections to the custom of leaving a note of criticism on the 
teacher’s desk after the principal has observed her recitation. 
5. Is it fair to condemn a teacher on the ground that she does not 
accept suggestions? Discuss. 
6. Point out some reasons for distinguishing between suggestions and 
instructions. 
7. Why are the pre-visitation conferences often of more value to the 
beginning teacher than the post-visitation conference? 
8. Outline a supervisory program for a month. 
9. Criticise the five-year program of meetings which is given in the text. 
What signs can you perceive that the principal was trying to follow a 
constructive plan? 
10. Give the advantages and disadvantayes of exchange visiting as a 
means of improving teaching.

CHAPTER XX 
THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 
Nature of the problem. Classroom management was at one 
time one of the much-taught subjects of teacher-training 
schools, and it was a popular theme at institutes. This is no 
longer the case. Subject-matter in education has greatly 
expanded. Instructors, desiring to keep up with new 
movements, have relegated much of the old to the scrap- 
heap. Curriculum courses dealing with child nature, social 
needs, educational principles, and instructional technique, 
have taken the place of the definite suggestions concerning 
the mechanics of teaching. In our anxiety to develop the 
teacher’s initiative and give free expression to her personal- 
ity, we have forgotten that the teacher is a craftsman need- 
ing the craftsman’s skill. 
Although schools have changed, there are certain funda- 
mental requirements in handling groups of children which 
are much the same as a half-century ago. Teachers must 
master these details of management, if not in training 
schools then after they begin teaching. We cannot have 
school without teachers knowing how to administer routine 
effectively. With the frequent neglect of the teaching of 
management, the duty more and more seems to devolve 
upon the principal to shape and instruct in the technique of 
classroom management. ‘The one thing that marks an ex- 
perienced teacher from an inexperienced is not that the 
former is master of more theory, or that she is better in- 
formed on new methods of instruction, but that she does 
know how to manage children. 
Meaning of management. Management covers the ac-

  376 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
tivities of the school which must be repeated in the same 
way over and over again. It is concerned with acts which 
should be made habitual. Its object is to economize time, 
protect the health of the children, teach habits of social con- 
trol, and make for greater comfort and satisfaction in school 
life. It has often been said that management is not an end 
in itself. This is only partly true. While a well-managed 
school always means one in which the opportunities for suc- 
cessful teaching are at the maximum, it has values inde- 
pendent of the results of instruction in subject-matter. Good 
health, comfort, cheerful codperation, neatness and order — 
all of these are contained in the concept of good manage- 
ment, and are civic essentials of no small importance. An- 
archy or chaos and bad management are synonymous. 
In a consolidated or village school, the principal is likely 
to find special need for attending to the problem of manage- 
ment. He can afford to neglect supervision of instruction 
for a few weeks until the organization of the classrooms is 
perfected. The rural children, if the school be new, have 
not been habituated to the regimen of discipline to which 
city children are accustomed from the first grade on up. 
They also are more individualistic, and have never learned to 
codperate in large groups. The teachers too, may have been 
used to doing things their own way, and if they are chosen 
from the one-room school, as is so often the case, may be 
more anxious to maintain their independence of action than 
to train children to fit into a new type of school. 
The problems of management are many and various. 
There is no detail that is unimportant. It is in fact the 
mastery of each part which, combined with mastery of every 
other part, gives us a good school. At this time we can dis- 
cuss only the following: 
1. Seating. 
2. Hygiene, including lighting, heating, and ventilation.

Seating. There are two principles of seating. The first is 
to have the pupils comfortable, and safe from any injury due 
to bad light, faulty posture, and the like; the second, to 
make conditions contribute as much as possible to good 
order, study, and learning. In dealing with the first, the 
principal should talk the matter over with the teachers early 
the first week or before school opens. In general, the pupils 
may be permitted to choose their seats. For convenience in 
recitation, one part of the room may be designated for the A 
section, the other for the B section. ‘The teacher will make 
note of the seats that need adjustment, and, on an afternoon 
designated, she will retain at recess or at the noon hour the 
pupils occupying those seats. The principal will at that 
time send the janitor to each of the rooms and adjust the 
seats to the pupils. If there are a good many needing ad- 
justment, a few high-school or upper-grade boys may be 
drafted to help. A few instructions should be given, the 
following being illustrations: 
1. Adjust the seat to the height so that the occupant’s feet may 
rest squarely upon the floor. 
2. Space the desk and seat so the former overhangs the latter 
from one and one half to two and one half inches. 
8. Adjust the height of the desk so that the lower arms of the 
pupil rest upon it at right angles to the upper arms when they 
hang straight down at the sides. 
To facilitate the work of the teacher in getting acquainted 
with the pupils, and also as an administrative aid, a seating 
chart should be furnished each teacher. On this the seats 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
378 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
  may be numbered in a regular order, commencing with the 
outside row to the left of the teacher and numbering the 
front desk in this row 1. When seats are assigned, the 
teacher should write in the pupils’ names. This seating 
chart may be put in some convenient place on the teacher’s 
desk. It will be very useful to the principal in learning the 
names of the pupils, if he is new to the school, and if not he 
may see at a glance whether the teacher has seated her pupils 
most wisely from the point of view of control. 3 
Seating for discipline. Mischief-making in school 
thrives only as it gets group support. There will ordinarily 
be a few pupils who will become centers of disturbance if 
they get any aid at all from those around them. ‘Teachers 
should know this, and should plan the seating so that the 
trouble makers are pretty well surrounded by the better 
pupils. If a clique develops, the principal can usually ob- 
serve it at the first visit. He will then do well to suggest to 
the teacher that she find some pretext for shifting the loca- 
tion of one or two of the parties. It is seldom necessary to 
state the real reason for making the change. Another pre- 
text will frequently serve, such as getting a desk where the 
light is better, having a pupil near the board or near her desk 
where he can help her, or of putting one pupil near another 
so that they may help each other. The writers knew a 
teacher who brought a mischievous boy up to the front row 
willingly, because she wanted him to be near the ther- 
mometer, so that he could watch the temperature of the 
room. However, if it comes down to it, no excuse but the 
need for better grouping is necessary, and the teacher may 
come out plainly on the subject. It is only because country 
pupils sometimes get the idea that they have special rights 
to certain desks that the suggestion of diplomacy in changing 
is made. 
_ Room hygiene. Even experienced teachers will some-
-P-A-G-E-393
  
THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 3879 
times neglect the hygiene of the room. This is true of ventil- 
ation and lighting particularly. They are interested in their 
instructional duties, the thermometer mounts, the air be- 
comes foul, the pupils become drowsy or uneasy — but the 
teacher is unconscious of it all. The symptoms of an over- 
heated, ill-ventilated room are easy for the principal to 
recognize. He comes in from the better-ventilated corridor 
and is struck by the wave of warm and bad-smelling air the 
minute he opens the classroom door. He sees there are no 
windows open. ‘There are forty-five pupils in the room. 
Their faces are flushed, and their eyes are too bright. There 
is a nervous buzz of whispers and laughter. There is con- 
siderable hoarse coughing. The teacher’s voice is harsh and 
raspy, and her nerves are on edge. Too much heat and lack 
of pure air explains the situation. 
The principal should take steps to prevent the occurrence 
of such conditions. As soon as the opportunity permits, 
suggest to the teacher that the room is a little warm. It is 
assumed that the subject has already been a topic in one of 
the business meetings of the group. At the next visit, if 
conditions are similar, move quietly around to the windows 
and raise them slightly. If there is room control of heating, 
see that it is adjusted. Again mention to the teacher the 
importance of looking after ventilation. Get into the habit 
of examining the thermometer when coming into the room. 
After indirect suggestion and direct instruction have been 
offered, without result, one of the following devices may be 
tried: 
1. Make out a memorandum card for the teacher’s desk. Do it 
good-humoredly. On the card list ventilation and heating at 
hour intervals, with a little note concerning their importance 
to the comfort and health of the teacher and the pupils. A 
forgetful teacher may make the memorandum for herself. 
%. Get the teacher to appoint monitors or a committee to watch 
the ventilation of the room. This makes a fine teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  380 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
project. The pupil on duty may have a card on which, at 
hour intervals, he records the thermometer reading and the 
condition of the air in the rooms. He may see that the room 
is well ventilated at intermissions. Other pupils should be 
aware of his duties, and call him to account for any neglect. 
He should be rewarded for faithful service. The committee 
may prepare a poster for the bulletin board, dealing with 
ventilation rules, that will not only serve as a reminder to the 
room but will also carry over into home practices. 
Lighting. The same methods may be followed in taking 
care of the lighting. There are only two or three things the 
teacher can do. One of them is to adjust the shades to keep 
direct or reflected light off the pupils’ work and out of their 
eyes. Another is to raise the shades as high as they can be 
on dark days. A third is to turn on artificial lights, when 
these are available. Sometimes pupils fail to take advan- 
tage of the light. They sit facing it, so that the light falls 
upon their eyes and not upon their work. They hold their 
books at improper angles, or slide down in their seats so that 
both position and lighting are bad. Unless matters of this 
kind are called to the notice of teachers there are always 
some who will overlook them. 
Order. Order is defined as system. It is generally an 
unfailing index to teacher effectiveness. There are some 
very good teachers who let the pupils scatter paper over the 
floor, keep their own desks untidy, and permit the pupils to 
raise an uproar with small provocation. They would be 
better teachers if they taught their pupils habits of neatness, 
order, system, and consideration for others. The impres- 
sion which the janitor gets of teaching efficiency, and which 
he may convey about the neighborhood, is a reflection of the 
condition of the room after dismissal. Next to an unven- 
tilated and overheated room, a disorderly room is the most 
unpleasant. 
Suppose that a principal has a teacher who does not in-
-P-A-G-E-395
THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 381 
stall habits of order in the pupils. What is there for him to 
do about it? While the devices are and probably should be 
as numerous as the individuals, the following general sug- 
gestions have been found helpful: 
1. Establish order as one of the objectives of education. Talk it 
over in teachers’ meeting, present it before the pupils, and let 
it appear on the report cards and on the teacher-rating card. 
Develop a standard of room and desk order. 
2. Have frequent inspection of desks. Competition between 
grades or rows is a good thing. 
8. Appoint pupil housekeepers whose duty it is to keep watch of 
school order, keep the reference books straight, and render 
reports on conditions to the class. 
4, Put up a placard on the bulletin board setting down the class 
creed of room and desk order. This should be prepared by 
the pupils. 
5. If indirect suggestions fail go to the teacher who is neglectful, 
tell her directly that improvement is in order. 
6. In the case of overconscientious teachers who are in the habit 
of picking up after the pupils, ask them to quit it, and instead 
to train the pupils to pick up after themselves. The writers 
only recently observed a beginning teacher who, when the 
pupils were dismissed, went about the room straightening up 
their desks, picking paper off the floor, and putting reference 
books in place. This is better than disorder, but it sacrifices a 
fine chance to teach the pupils a useful lesson. 
Marching and drills. It is one question to decide whether 
the pupils shall march formally in and out of school; it is 
quite another to manage the entrance and exit, after the 
method has been decided upon. Common experience shows 
that strict marching requirements are productive of disciplin- 
ary troubles. It is therefore better to manage somewhat 
after the plan given below: 
1. Have the pupils march in and out in line, but do not require 
them to keep step. 
2. Follow the simplest and most direct ae of getting the 
pupils in and out of the building. | --—-

3.   
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
Lay out a plan — if new, use the old one the first few days — 
and have a little special drill in it until the pupils know what 
is expected of them. 
Work towards the ideal of having the pupils line up of their 
own will, or under the direction of a line captain. Try to get 
away from having the teachers come to the entrance of the 
building and follow the pupils until they are out. At the 
same time, the principal should save himself from having to 
supervise every entrance and dismissal. 
The situation is a little different in fire drill, and it is all- 
important to prepare for this in advance. ‘The older 
country boys and girls are likely to display a contempt of 
anything that looks like precautions against fire. They 
have not known of dangers in the old school, and they have 
not learned, as city children have, that fire is of all hazards 
the one most to be dreaded. The appeal to them should be 
the protection of the little folks. When this is done, and 
perhaps a volunteer fire-fighting brigade organized among 
the larger boys, there will be no trouble over discipline. 
Successful fire drill demands:! 
1. 
2. > 
7. 
8. That pupils and teachers understand its purpose, and they 
know exactly what they are to do. 
That the first week or two the drills be repeated several 
times, until it becomes mechanical. 
. That stations be fixed for each room at a safe distance from 
the school, and that each group remain at its station until the 
order to return to the school, or to go to some other place 
designated by the principal, is given. 
That the leaders in fire drill be the same as in everyday dis 
missal. 
. That some of the older pupils be assigned to search the build- 
ing and see that every one is out. 
That teachers leave the building immediately following their 
own pupils, and take up their stations with their groups. 
That some of the older pupils be given practice in running out 
the fire hose, using the extinguishers, and sending in alarms. 
That absolute quiet and attention be observed by every one. 
1 Tt usually improves the drill to have it rated once in a while for effective- 
ness. This may be done by a committee of teachers or by patrons.
-P-A-G-E-397
  
THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 383 
Passing materials. Inexpert teachers are apt to lose 
much time in passing out and collecting materials. If they 
have no system, there is also likely to be much of hubbub 
and confusion attending the process. In the early visits to 
the classrooms the principal should note how well the terch- 
ers have organized this phase of school management. He 
learns what teachers need help, and what schemes some ef 
the better teachers follow. In general, he will let each 
teacher decide for herself what materials shall be collected at 
the end of each recitation; his efforts should concern them- 
selves with the “how.” Should he find an inexperienced 
teacher clearly wasting too much time by taking up and 
passing out supplementary readers, pencils, paper, and so 
forth, he should advise her to lessen the need of such routine. 
Two requirements are needed: first, the materials must be 
stored in the same way in some convenient place; second, 
the pupils must be trained to pass the materials. The prin- 
cipal should see that any necessary storage for books, pencils, 
and paper is provided. He should no less see that the sup- 
plies are furnished to the teacher as she needs them, or that 
they are of convenient access to her. If the teacher feels 
that she is suspected of extravagance every time she with- 
draws a box of crayon, she will deprive the children of the 
use of needed supplies. 
With a convenient place in case, closet, or upon table to 
hold the materials, the next concern is the method of pass- 
ing. With books, pencils, and the like, it may be well for 
the teacher to appoint pupil monitors. If they sit in the 
last or the front row of seats they are a little bit handier in 
performing their duties. This, though, is not necessary. 
The teacher needs pupils who will take the duty seriously, 
and who will work quickly and quietly. As these jobs really 
are in demand by the pupils (especially of the lower grades) 
something may be made of them in developing leadership.
-P-A-G-E-398
  
  384 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
Suggest to the teachers that they try out pupils before 
selecting their helpers. In the ordinary course of routine the 
technique is something as follows: 
1. The pupils sit quietly at attention, or go about their usual 
tasks. 
2. The monitors (one for each row) distribute or collect the 
+ materials following a definite order, such as beginning at the 
back of the room and passing to the front, or the reverse. 
8. The teacher gives no commands, or if necessary to indicate 
what is to be done speaks in a low tone to the individuals. 
4. No variations are introduced in procedure unless it is the 
result of pre-arrangement. 
5. The teacher commends the helpers when the work is finished. 
Board work. There is also likely to be considerable con- 
fusion attendant on using the blackboard. Passing to and 
from it should be guided by much the same principles as 
room entrance and exit. Every pupil should have a place 
assigned him, and should pass by the shortest and most con- 
venient route to that place. The row nearest the board 
should simply rise and stand at attention near their desks. 
Those in the front part of the room may pass to the front 
board; those in the back to the rear board. 
After reaching the board, each pupil should provide him- 
self with crayon and eraser and see that the board is clean. 
As it takes up valuable time to write the name and date 
every time a pupil uses the board, these may be dispensed 
with, unless the teacher needs the names when checking up 
the work after the pupils are seated. Usually, the pupils 
should erase the work, and put the crayon and erasers in 
place. If work is to be left on the board, it should be so 
marked and everything else cleaned off. 
Leaving the room. ‘The problem of leaving the room to go 
to the toiiet or to get a drink is one in which new and weak 
teachers need guidance. Every principal has observed the 
never-ceasing line of pupils moving in and out from some of
-P-A-G-E-399
  THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 385 
therooms. He has surprised little groups, often all from the 
same room, in watchful conference in the toilet. On the 
other side of the case, he has been the recipient of letters of 
complaint from parents respecting the strictness of teachers 
who give almost no permission. A position midway be- 
tween the two extremes is to be recommended. Many of 
the abuses are due to the teacher’s lacking both understand- 
ing of the problem and methods of dealing with it. 
The first step to take is to see that there are periods open 
in which the pupils may go to the toilets and get drinks 
without permission. The physical education periods, and 
the intervals between classes where work is departmental- 
ized, may serve these purposes. The second step is to bring 
the matter to the attention of the teachers. They should 
inform the pupils that these periods are for the express pur- 
pose of giving them a chance to attend to their bodily needs. 
Next they should realize that some leaving the room is a 
necessary and to-be-expected thing. They should freely 
grant the privilege, but take precautions against its abuse. 
To this end, they should talk plainly to the pupils about the 
importance of observing reasonable rules and preventing 
abuses. ‘They should then suggest that the pupils act upon 
their own honor in the matter. Instead of asking permis- 
sion they come and go as necessary, but a record is kept. 
For this purpose a pad and pencil may be posted near the 
door. As the pupil leaves the room, he writes down his 
name and the time. When he returns, he checks his name 
and again records the time. The teacher should keep the 
pupils under observation as they leave and enter, and also 
occasionally check up on the record. If pupils abuse the 
privilege, it may be withdrawn. 
The records serve other purposes. If the name of a pupil 
appears frequently, the teacher may inquire of the parents 
whether the child’s health is such as to render the absences
-P-A-G-E-400
386 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
necessary. If it does not appear to be necessary, it may be 
possible to suggest to him that he form better habits. The 
writers have known of timid children who did not go to the 
toilets at the intermissions because of fear or bashfulness, or 
because they were molested by the other children. The 
records help to make the teacher aware of pupils of this kind 
who should have different treatment. It is also a wise plan 
to keep a check on the whereabouts of the children. Much 
mischief can go on during school hours; if there is any 
writing and marking on the toilet walls, it will usually be 
done during this time. If the principal and teachers keep 
the watch over the toilets that they should, they can usually 
detect the guilty parties by knowing approximately the 
period the defacing was done, and the names of the pupils 
who were out of the room at the time. 
Conferring with other pupils. There are two aspects to 
this problem. There is conference between pupils of the 
same room, and between pupils of different rooms. The 
attitude of the old disciplinarians used to be sternly against 
what they called “whispering” —a kind of covert con- 
ference likely to be about something else than lessons. The 
ultra-modern teacher, with strong leanings toward the social- 
ized method, may permit pupils actually to visit with their 
fellows. ‘Tendencies are more in sympathy with the latter 
than with the prohibition of the old régime which did not 
prohibit. When the efforts of the pupils center upon their 
projects, there will be very little abuse of the conference 
privilege. ‘The general rule that conference is permitted 
when it is necessary and desirable, and when it is carried on 
with due regard for the rights of others, should be adopted. 
With inter-room conference, other regulations are needed. 
The indiscriminate passing of pupils from room to room to 
“get a book,” or “return a pencil,” should not be per- 
mitted. Teachers should be instructed to permit no pupil
-P-A-G-E-401
  
THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 387 
to have conference with a pupil in another room during 
school time except upon the written request of the teacher 
from whom the pupil comes. With high-school pupils the 
principal himself should write the request. This will pre- 
vent unnecessary interruptions of the teachers’ work by 
having to go to the door and receive pupil visitors, or call 
the pupil from his recitation. It will also prevent the or- 
ganizing mischief or inane telling of “secrets” which charac- 
terize grade pupils, and the making of dates which are the 
occasion of much of the high-school pupil conference. If the 
teachers agree to look with cold disfavor upon these school- 
time interruptions they will soon cease. 
Using reference materials. What has been said about 
pupil conferences within the room applies with even more 
force to the use of reference materials. If pupils are ever to 
develop the power of independent study they should com- 
mence to exercise it early in their school career. ‘They 
should be free to consult maps, encyclopedias, dictionaries, 
and other books as they wish, provided of course the books 
are inthe room. They should not be obliged to ask for per- 
mission to do this. There are schools in which the teacher 
has so much of her time taken up in granting the pupils per- 
mission to attend to their own wants and needs that she has 
no time for constructive teaching. She makes of herself 
nothing but a manager, and a poor one at that. The object 
is to make for pupil management, and for such growth of 
self that teacher attention to routine is almost unnecessary. 
It is true that most of the disciplinary troubles of teachers 
are made for themselves because they are poor managers. 
When it comes to using the library, some other plan than 
free reference may be advisable. In some of the better 
schools library schedules are being followed. Under such a 
plan, teacher A has an hour or perhaps more in which she 
can send her pupils to the library. At that time she desig-
-P-A-G-E-402
  
388 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
nates the pupil or the group that are to go, and they know in 
advance what they are going for. They state their problem 
plainly to the librarian, who then has the free time to help 
them. On returning to the home room, they report their 
success to the teacher and the pupils. If a schedule is not 
planned, it is perhaps best to carry a request from the teacher 
before being given help or materials at the library. 
Principles of management. There is really no argument 
as to whether hit and miss or regular methods of performing 
school routine are best. Although there may be several best 
ways, there is not one best way for Monday, another for 
Tuesday, and another for Wednesday. There are not 
several best ways for doing a given thing by a given group of 
pupils. The sociologists have given us a valuable principle 
in what they call anticipation. This means that, in as 
many matters as possible, people should know in advance 
what they are to do from day to day and how they are to do 
it. Uncertainty as to what the conduct of a teacher will be, 
or instability of character, variability, or anything that may 
be interpreted as eccentricity are fatal to the teacher’s 
success. This, when its full significance is appreciated, is 
abundant justification for a system of unvarying routine in 
the mechanics of teaching. 
Other principles, vital to efficient management, are: 
1. In the main the practices should be uniform for the entire 
school. There is a great economy in this. Having learned 
once how to pass to the board, how to arrange written work, 
and how to leave the room, it is unnecessary to learn a new 
way with each succeeding teacher. One of the reasons why 
teachers are accused of being cranky and old-maidish grows 
out of the difficulties pupils have of fitting themselves to 
vagaries of management, often when the matters are trifling. 
The uniformity may be established by the teachers. Pre- 
sent the problem to them, and let a committee be appointed 
to investigate methods and report. After discussion, adopt 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
THE SUPERVISION OF ROUTINE 389 
some method as the standard for the school. Note that this 
applies to how a thing is done only, and not to whether it is to 
be done. 
2. Systematic drill should be given quite frequently during the 
first few days. Thereafter departures from the method should 
be prevented until the habit is well grounded. 
8. Routine should be motivated. One of the best ways to do 
this is to explain why it is required, and stimulate pride in do- 
ing it well. Rewards, competition, commendation, and exhibi- 
tion are all good means of motivating routine. It is worth 
something for a class to have the reputation of being the best 
at fire drill, or in order, or in taking responsibility for ven- 
tilation. 
Utilize the pupils as much as possible. Almost all of the 
routine exercises have learning values and leadership oppot- 
tunities. These are realized only as the pupils participate. f2 
Summary. The product of the modern training school is 
not exceptionally well trained in classroom management. 
The need for efficient management has not decreased. A 
poor manager is usually a poor teacher, and it therefore be- 
comes a duty of the principal to instruct his beginning 
teachers and his weak teachers in economical and successful 
methods of caring for routine. The most important of these 
are seating, hygiene, order, marching, passing materials, 
board work, leaving the room, conferring with other pupils, 
and using reference books. Five principles should control 
management. They are: (1) The principle of certainty, 
(2) the principle of uniformity, (3) the principle of drill, 
(4) the principle of motivation, and (5) the principle of 
pupil leadership. If these are observed, routine will not 
only make for more successful instruction, but also possesses 
educational value itself.

  CHAPER XXI 
ORGANIZING THE VACATION ACTIVITIES 
The problem of the vacation school. Education is a con- 
tinuous process in the life of every child. The now tradi- 
tional school year extending from early fall to summer marks 
no period during which the child’s mind is more active than 
at other time. Knowledge, attitudes, and habits are seem- 
ingly acquired out of school as well as in, and just as effec- 
tively during summer as in winter. It must be concluded 
that the causes which have resulted in releasing children 
from organized instruction during the summer months have 
not been well founded. 
An examination of the causes should reveal whether this 
last statement is true or not. Glancing at educational 
history, it is seen that there are at least five possible explana- 
tions for the abandonment of school training during summer. 
They are: 
1. The children were kept at home to help with farm work. 
When the public schools were first organized, life was pre- 
dominately rural, and the home was the industrial as well as 
the social unit. The children were needed at home to help 
make the family living. 
2. The belief that continued study and attendance at school 
would produce mental injury or “brain fag.” 
8. The belief that the health would be injured unless there was a 
long vacation. 
4, The belief that the summer months are too hot for study. 
5. The desire of children to get away from the formal require- 
ments of the traditional school. 
Validity of the explanations. It is worth while to exam- 
ine each of the explanations briefly to determine what its 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
THE VACATION ACTIVITIES 398 
validity is in modern times, and particularly in the case 
of the modern consolidated school. The first undoubtedly 
comes nearest to fitting the facts. In the early days machin- 
ery was scarce, methods of labor were crude, and the com- 
bined efforts of the family were needed to furnish the bare 
means of subsistence. Furthermore, these farm-home ac- 
tivities were themselves very good education. However, 
with the coming of improved farm machinery and methods 
some of the old rigors of the struggle for existence have been 
materially lessened. 
Therefore, we find to-day that one man working with the 
new machinery can produce more and in less time than the 
whole family together produced under primitive conditions. 
The rise of cities, the division of labor, and the better 
methods of transportation have created a market for farm 
products and given them a standard cash value. Economie 
necessity no longer demands the presence of all the children 
on the farm regularly during the summer months. 
With the advance of civilization there has also come a 
change in the national attitude toward any form of child 
labor where economic exploitation is the purpose, whether by 
parents, individual employers, or by corporations. To-day 
society does not ask whether a child is making money for his 
parents as a result of his work activity. It asks instead 
whether he is building a strong healthy body and a set of de- 
sirable civic habits and attitudes. The public mind is un- 
alterably opposed to child labor of any kind, and is rapidly 
expressmg this attitude in prohibitory legislation. It is 
only a matter of a few years until it will be everywhere the 
problem of finding educational occupation for all the chil- 
dren the year round. , 
The belief that there is danger of overworking mentally is 
not borne out by the facts. Scientific investigations have 
shown that the child is normally active mentally all the time,
-P-A-G-E-408
  394 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
and is constantly learning whether in school or out. Under 
skillful direction of the school, the mental health should be 
better cared for than when the child is permitted to do as he 
pleases. 
The same may be said of physical health. A real danger 
exists if children in school are to be confined in unnatural 
postures, and improperly ventilated and inadequately lighted 
rooms. However, these are hazards which should be re- 
moved at any period of the year, and are more to be feared in 
the winter than during the summer. All the reports of 
summer schools show that the health of the children is much 
better than in the winter, and that the attendance is corre- 
spondingly better. 
Many still affect to believe that the summer months are 
too hot for study. A little consideration would serve to 
show that such a theory is unsound. Colleges and universi- 
ties hold their summer sessions regularly with good results 
and no noticeable ill effects. It is obvious, too, that chil- 
dren must be somewhere during the summer, and modern 
construction of school buildings guarantees they will be at 
least as well cared for in school as in the ordinary dwelling- 
house, and much better than in the exposed field or road. 
Moreover, with modern methods of cooling, it is much more 
economical to keep a building cool in summer than it is to 
heat it in winter. No one disputes that a bill for fans, ice, or 
even a refrigeration plant is just as much justified as a bill for 
coal or a heating plant. 
The final objection has a worthy point or two. There is 
no doubt that children are bored by the dreary routine of 
formal school method, and that vacation from it is a real 
blessing. With the newer type of school, though, the situa- 
tion is entirely different. Not all the program is limited to 
the school building by any means, and the activities are such 
as to contribute to the pleasure of the children. In fact
-P-A-G-E-409
THE VACATION ACTIVITIES 395 
the smallest part of the activity will likely go on there. 
School-home projects should be largely used, as they furnish 
a splendid opportunity to bring out the practical phases of 
education. This will be helping the children to do better 
what they would do anyway. 
Advantages in the vacation school. The advantages are 
such as to far overbalance the disadvantages. They may 
be summarized, as follows: 
1. It makes for efficiency, in that the plant is employed for the 
year round and does not stand idle. 
. Attendance is better. 
. There is less sickness than in the winter period. 
. The children make more rapid progress through the grades. 
. Their health and morals are more carefully guarded. 
. They are more comfortable and happy. 
The services of the teachers employed for the year are better 
utilized. NO oe ww 
Reports taken from pupils and parents in cities having 
vacation schools are very favorable. To illustrate the 
general attitude, the following quotations from Deffenbaugh 
are given: 
The summer term keeps one from hanging around the streets and 
saves one from trouble. 
I am kept from bad company. 
If I hadn’t come to school in the summer, I would be in 5C, and I 
m in 7A. 
In my home it is not very comfortable during the summer, as the 
un shines in making it very warm. In the streets it is warmer, so I 
‘0 to school rather than gét heated up. 
I lived in a city where there was no summer school and I found 
he children got into more trouble than they do here at Newark. 
If there were no summer schools we would not know where our 
hildren are. Now we know they are safe in the schoolhouse and in 
o danger of being hurt. 
Planning the vacation school. The aims of the vacation 
hool are not essentially different from the aims of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-410
    
     
396 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
    regular school. There may easily be a change of emphasis, 
due to the outdoor laboratory conditions which the summer 
months offer. There will on the whole be less of the so- 
called tool subjects, and more of the expression subjects. 
There will be more freedom and less restraint. In general, 
two aspects deserve attention: 
1. The school-home projects. 
2. The resident instruction. 
In carrying out the idea of the vacation school, it is to be 
remembered that textbook reading and class instruction are 
to be minimized. Many other active agencies are available, 
some of which will already be in touch with the children 
of the community. The principal’s first duty is to take an 
inventory of these agencies, and then proceed to organize 
and codrdinate them into a unified educational program. 
Among such agencies, the following are most important: 
1. Directed recreational reading. 
2. Juvenile organizations, such as the Boy Scouts, the Girl 
Scouts, the Industrial Clubs, and the many other organiza- 
tions referred to in Chapter XVIII. 
8. Religious organizations, such as the church and the Sunday 
school. 
. The regular school building and the grounds. 
. The homes and various community interests. 
. Fairs, exhibitions, institutes. 
. Chautauquas and lyceums. 
. National and state extension service. WID

Vacation projects. The supervised project method seem: 
to promise the greatest usefulness in vacation education, 
There are many of them which will serve to continue learn: 
ing processes already established during the regular schoo! 
term. In most cases, they should require actual practic 
in what was previously classroom knowledge and theory. 
Naturally, the element of compulsion is distinctly subor.

THE VACATION ACTIVITIES 397 
dinated. The projects are freely elected, and the appeal is 
particularly to the interests. 
The teachers employed for the full year should have 
charge of most of the project work. This means the Smith- 
Hughes teacher for the boys, and the home economics 
teacher for the girls. As the program is expanded, as it 
necessarily will be, more help may be required. Much can 
be done by the club leaders, and some voluntary help can be 
drawn from the community. The principal will have to be 
familiar with much of the work himself, and take the lead in 
putting it into operation. On this account a list of typical 
vacation projects is given. They are arranged under the 
conventional objectives which they should help to realize. 
All of them are projects that have been tried out successfully 
with rural and village boys and girls: 
Health. 
1. Care of the person, neatness, teeth brushed daily, bathing 
at least twice each week, avoidance of narcotics, plenty of 
sleep.

diseased tonsils, eye defects remedied, adenoids removed. 
4. Correction of faulty posture or round shoulders. 
5. Living by health schedule, properly dividing time among 
eating, working, recreation, and sleeping. 
6. Hygienic dressing, proper kind and amount of clothing 
worn, correct shoes.

Resident summer work. Not all desirable summer 
activity can be carried on by means of home projects. 
Some homes will not afford the necessary facilities, some of 
the children will come from the town in or near where the 
school is located, and some will choose school attendance to 
home projects. Some of the children will want to study the 
academic subjects in order to keep from being left behind, or 
to get ahead of their fellows. To accommodate such cases 
some resident classes will be needed. Half-day sessions are 
to be preferred, and three to five days a week are sufficient. 
The resident work should be terminated two or three weeks 
before the fall term opens. 
It is usually best to retain a special teacher, who may 
be one of the regular teachers, for these classes. Usually 
the principal and the year-round teachers will have enough 
to do without undertaking the instruction themselves. In 
a small school — say three hundred pupils — one teacher 
will probably be enough. Although much emphasis should 
be given to the elimination of retardation and to the ad- 
justment of new pupils, there should be time found for a 
strong program. of play, recreation, and social activities.
-P-A-G-E-414
  
400 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
The school must be popular to the extent that the children 
prefer it to staying at home. 
Periodic conferences of those engaged in home projects 
should also be held at the school building. While local cir- 
cumstances may dictate differences in procedure, in general 
at least one conference every two weeks should be held. 
The laboratories and the library should be open regularly 
for the use of those working on projects. The playground 
and the equipment should be available to all who want to 
use it. This applies especially to children who live in town 
or near the school, and who are not engaged in any regular 
project. If there is sufficient demand a play supervisor 
should be provided for two or three hours daily. A young 
woman may be found who will volunteer for this duty, or it 
may be apportioned among the members of a club or society. 
Everything points to the need of having the physical and 
athletic director employed on a twelve months’ basis. 
Adult study groups or conferences should have free access 
to the school plant during the summer. Farmers’ insti- 
tutes, held under the auspices of the county farm bureau and 
in conjunction with State or Federal agents, find their 
natural meeting-place in the school building. The complete 
resources of the school should be available for these meet- 
ings, and the Smith-Hughes teachers should lend every aid 
in their power towards making the conferences a success. 
In so far as these adult meetings are of interest to the stu- 
dents who are working on projects, they should be encour- 
aged to attend. 
Getting the plans approved. After the principal has de- 
veloped his plan for the summer activities, he is ready to 
present them to the board for approval. There will be some 
extra expense involved, which should be carefully estimated 
and presented with the plan. On this point, however, the 
experience of city schools is that this expense is after all less
-P-A-G-E-415
  
THE VACATION ACTIVITIES 401 
than what it would be under the nine-months’ term plan. 
They have found it possible to eliminate all retardation, and 
to make it possible for many pupils to finish the eight-year 
course in six years. In Deffenbaugh’s study an actual sav- 
ing of from ten to twenty per cent is indicated. 
With this argument, it may also be pointed out that the 
supervising staff for the school is already provided. The 
principal, the Smith-Hughes workers, and the. industrial 
club leaders are in the community the entire year, and the 
first two are on salary. The further promise of volunteer 
work from scoutmasters, church workers, and leaders of 
juvenile organizations must appeal to the board as so much: 
gain. At least, the principal can, at no extra cost to the dis- 
trict, unite the efforts of the Smith-Hughes workers and the 
volunteers. This is enough to insure the home projects and 
a good part of the social and play program at the school. 
There are a good many lines of persuasion open. The 
written approval of many school patrons, a petition from the 
community, figures showing increased returns from the in- 
vestment in the school plant, teachers’ salaries, and trans- 
portation units are all convincing. Information on how the 
children spend the summer months may also add to the 
force of the argument. This is a point that can be strongly 
emphasized, since ‘the whole design of the plan is to make 
boys and girls more useful as citizens. 
The board should also understand clearly the nature of 
the program. It should be pointed out that the children are 
not being encouraged in the academic subjects primarily, 
but in practical projects which will be useful to the home. 
It should be clear that the plan does not primarily involve 
the introduction of new activities nor the duplication of old. 
Rather it stands for a wider application of regular activities, 
and the more effective codrdination of the school and com- 
munity program into a unified plan of summer education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-416
  
402 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
Putting the plan into operation. After having secured the 
approval and support of the board, the principal is ready to 
express his ideas in the form of concrete organization. A 
large part of his work will have to be done before the close of 
the regular school year. There are in the main three steps. 
They are, in order: 
1. Registration. 
2. Approval of the parents. 
8. Assignment to supervision. 
As has been stated, for the present at least all work should 
be on an elective basis. Announcements of the contem- 
plated activities should be sent to the parents, the matter 
should be discussed before the parent-teacher association or 
similar society, and presented to the pupils. If it is desired 
to eliminate retardation, special communications may be 
sent to parents whose children are behind, urging them to 
keep the children in school during the summer. When this 
has been done, a registration day should be announced. At 
this time the principal, with such teacher help as he needs, 
should proceed to register the pupils in the usual way. 
Having made a choice of activities, the written approval 
of the parents should be obtained. This will be easier to get 
if the parents know fully what the child proposes to do. It 
is well then that the registration card or form to be signed by 
the parents have printed on it a clear statement of objec- 
tives, and a definite plan of procedure which has the ap-: 
proval of the supervisor. A form similar to that on page 
403 may be used for recording summer project work: 
In some cases the project will be one which can best be 
supervised jointly by some outside organization — such as 
the church, industrial club, Camp Fire Girls, or Boy Scouts 
— andthe school. Arrangement should also be made in ad- 
vance. As these organizations often have programs planned

for the summer which concern many children in the com- 
munity, the principal should meet with their representatives 
early in the spring and outline his plan for unifying the 
work. In order to avoid petty jealousies, it is advisable to 
explain in the beginning that the move is in no sense an effort 
on the part of the school to subtract from the credit due any 
organization for worthy enterprise. It is, on the contrary, 
an attempt to reinforce and supplement worth-while efforts 
by granting school credit. 
Supervising project work. The resident work will stand 
in need of but little supervision, and this the principal can 
easily give. The project work will not usually be completed, 
nor will it be educationally successful unless it is supervised 
continuously by a trained person. There is too much of it 
for the principal to manage alone. His chief duty will be to 
see that enough supervisors are provided, and that super- 
visory schedules are so arranged that each pupil enrolled 
may be visited regularly about once every two weeks, 
The student should know in advance when the supervisor 
will arrive at his home. At this time the student should 
hand in a brief written report of his activities the preceding 
two weeks, and discuss with him any problem upon which he 
   
-P-A-G-E-418
  404 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
needs help. In general, the supervisor’s help will be of the 
same nature as that given by a skillful classroom teacher. 
He will give him clues that will help in getting at the best 
solution. Books, magazines, and farm bulletins should be 
referred to, and made available. Reference to what another 
student has done may serve to give the needed hint, and at 
the same time arouse a wholesome spirit of rivalry. Where 
there is no value in having the student search out the infor- 
mation for himself, the supervisor will give him the informa- 
tion directly. 
It is no small part of the supervisor’s duty to see that each 
worker keeps an accurate record of all his activity in connec- 
tion with the project, and upon all the business and financial 
transactions connected with it. Such books and records 
should be kept up to date. The supervisor can help get this 
result by calling for and examining the accounts on each 
visit. Here, as with other aspects of home-project work, 
the standard rules and regulations should govern. As an 
illustration of what is required in record-keeping the follow- 
ing are cited: 
1. All records must be kept on standard forms adopted for home 
projects. 
2. The records must be kept up to date, and they must be ex- 
amined and signed each time a visit is made by the supervisor. 
8. The records must be collected upon the completion of the 
projects. 
4. An itemized account of all receipts and expenditures must be 
made a part of the records. 
Forms for reporting completed projects should contain 
space for the following items: (See also Chapter XVII on 
“Vocational Projects. ”’) 
1. The aim — what the student was trying to do. 
2. The plan — how he proposed going about the work. 
8. The pfocedure — what was actually done. 
4. The results — what he accomplished.

The transportation feature. Transportation must be sup- 
plied the supervisors in visiting the homes, and the pupils in 
attending the conferences at the school. It should be main- 
tained as economically as possible. In some cases, several 
pupils may be met at a central location by the supervisor, if 
his presence on the home farm is not urgently needed. He 
may use one of the smaller busses, or a light car purchased 
for the special purpose of taking him about. Many consoli- 
dated schools possess general utility cars for the use of super- 
visors. It is generally possible in the summer for the super- 
visors to travel together. 
One or more of the regular transportation units will have 
to be used to bring the children in to the semi-monthly con- 
ferences. This involves new routing and new schedules. 
The supervisors may be called upon to do the driving, and, 
if there are several trips to be made, the principal may want 
to take out one of the cars. Transportation in the summer 
season is a minor matter compared with the regular year, as 
the pupils and trips are fewer, and the necessity of traveling 
on exact schedule greatly lessened. 
Fitting summer work into the regular program. Several 
disturbing questions arise when the principal attempts to fit 
the summer activities into the ordinary school classification 
scheme. He has to decide whether the pupil who takes 
summer courses should receive advancement in grades and 
credits that will permit him to complete the school earlier. 
How shall such work be evaluated in marks and credits? Is 
the summer course of sufficient value to warrant advanced 
classification in the usual school year?
-P-A-G-E-420
  406 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
If city practice is any guide, it is not hard to answer these 
questions. There it is the uniform practice to allow ad- 
vanced credit, evaluating the summer term as the equal of 
three months of the regular term. This permits finishing 
the eight grades in six years; the high school in three years. 
This practice breaks up the usual system of grading and may 
call for extra teachers. However, if the school can make the 
arrangements this is probably the best plan. 
If the city plan is not practicable, a special system of 
credit for home projects may be devised. Such credits 
should appear as a regular part of the pupils’ records, but 
would not of themselves lessen the amount of time required 
to complete the school course. If the school is completely 
organized for summer work and on a required basis, a certain 
number of project credits could be set as an added require- 
ment for promotion or graduation. In Mahoning County, 
Ohio, credits earned during the summer months are re- 
quired each year for promotion. The rules governing the 
plan are given below: 
1. Credit or grades made by a pupil in his regular school work 
are known as academic credits or grades. Credit or grades 
made in a home project are known as achievement credits or 
grades. 
2. Upon graduation from the eighth grade, seals showing the 
number of achievement credits earned are affixed to each 
diploma. 
8. Two credits may be granted for one achievement or project 
when the results are extraordinary and have been occasioned 
by unusual initiative, energy, and industry. 
4. An achievement emblem shall be presented to each pupil who 
earns achievement credit. 
5. The combined recommendation of the principal, parent, and 
supervisor shall be necessary before credit is granted. 
The point plan. Another plan is to assign points for pro- 
ject work. The projects are listed and appraised in points, a 
 
-P-A-G-E-421

pupil being expected to take the equivalent of one hundred 
points in projects. This is practically the plan used in 
Weber County, Utah. The projects below indicate the 
values assigned: 
1. Remedying physical defects, such as bad 
teeth, diseased tonsils, or defective eye-

8. Taking music lessons and practicing regularly 8 to 15 
Credit on the time basis. One other method of determin- 
ing credit has been tried out. By this method a complete 
record of all time spent in study, conference, and actual 
practice is kept. The first two are given credit on the same 
basis as study and recitation in the school, and the last is 
evaluated the same as laboratory work. The Ricks Normal 
College, in Idaho, developed this plan and has used it ex- 
tensively. This plan is recommended where project credit 
is made to count toward graduation. 
Although there are many elements connected with vaca- 
tion activities which are in the experimental stage, there is a 
general belief that the idea is sound. The need of such 
schools is on the increase. The schools that have been es- 
tablished have been successful beyond expectations, and 
even more successful than the winter terms. The adminis- 
trative difficulties do not offer insuperable obstacles to suc- 
cess, and year by year the stock of valuable experience is be- 
ing built up. It seems a reasonable conclusion that in a few 
years the nine months’ school will be the exception, the 
year-sound school the universal rule.

Summary. Education is a continuous process. The 
child’s mind is always active, and learning is going on 
whether he is in school or not. If he is to be kept from 
learning bad habits, low ideals, and harmful knowledge and 
is to progress towards the highest social goals, his whole 
education should be wisely directed. Conditions are 
rapidly changing; and rural children have a larger amount of 
free time available in the summer season. In every com- 
munity there are many educational agencies, but they are 
usually uncoérdinated and often ineffective. The proposal 
is, therefore, that the school assume a larger part in directing 
the education of the children during the vacation season. 
Two types of opportunities may be afforded: (1) resident 
school, and (2) home projects. Essentials in organization 
are planning, supervising, recording results, and giving 
credit. City school practice in vacation education is well 
established, and there is a pronounced tendency for its ex- 
tension to all types of schools.

  CHAPTER XXII 
ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 
Community objectives. Just as the school has aims, so does 
the community served by the school. The people are not 
aiways conscious of their objectives, but they are present 
nevertheless, motivating and guiding their actions. Now 
in a general way, the school and the community will rein- 
force each other to the extent to which their objectives are 
common, and to the degree to which they codperate in at- 
taining the common purposes. To this process of integrat- 
ing the school and the community, and giving to both a 
broader significance, the term community organization may 
well be applied. As the first step, let us examine the typical 
objectives of the people of the area served by the consoli- 
dated school. They may be stated as: 
1. Government, or security of life and property, and freedom 
from disturbance through the agency of efficient laws and 
officers. 
2. Economic efficiency, or sufficient and certain income through 
the medium of productive industry. 
. Wise use of leisure, through play and recreation. 
. Good health, by means of public health agencies. 
. Freedom of expression and communication, through pulpit, 
forum, and press. 
6. Religion and morality, through the support of standards and 
through association and worship. 
7. Diffusion of knowledge, skill, and ideals, through the agency 
of the school. oe OO

The purpose of organization. Such being the will and de- 
sire of the people, some method is necessary to realize them. 
This is the purpose of organization. This is to say that or- 
ganization is called into being or exists in order to get things

al organization means greater efficiency and 
ness. Lack of organization means that things 
‘e or altogether neglected. Anything like co- 
wrt is impossible without organization. Its 
,-~ecuce 1S Characterized by the following attributes: 
1. The presence of a purpose of which the members are conscious. 
2. The designation of leaders in the work of carrying out the 
purpose. 
8. The adoption of rules and principles to guide the effort. 
The place of the school. It is plainly evident that the 
school is not living up to its function unless it helps to carry 
Out-the eommunity objectives. This of course signifies that 
( _the principal must take over the leadership of the school in 
|_codperating with the community. The extent and nature of 
his duties in this respect-will be shaped by the local condi- 
tions. It will vary from a fair amount to almost every- 
thing, but is never likely to be small. As an illustration of 
type situations, varying from the simple to the complex, con- 
sider the following: 
1. A community that already has an effective organization and is 
busily engaged in social work. 
2. A community that has plenty of separate but uncodrdinated 
groups and societies. 
8. A community that is over-organized, and possesses a number 
of competitive organizations. 
4. A community that is unorganized. 
Probably types 2 and 3 will be found to be most common, 
thougk 4 is not unknown. This last may indeed be said to 
be characteristic of new consolidations. The school then 
should take the lead in transforming the inchoate, unorgan- 
ized mass into a unified whole, itself forming the center of 
the system. What this may signify in community develop- 
ment is shown in the description of an Iowa rural area: 
In the center of Orange Township is a row of well-kept homes      
 
-P-A-G-E-427
ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 413 
-and public buildings on both sides of a smooth paved road. The 
question is sometimes asked “ Where is the town?” meaning where 
is the general store, blacksmith shop, post office, grain elevator? 
As a matter of fact the only buildings other than homes are a con- 
solidated school and a community church. It is not a town or a 
village, only a community center... . 
The homes are modern and possess most of the conveniences of 
city homes, while the gardens connect the interests of the people 
with their former occupation. The two public buildings are true 
rural institutions linked with the life of the country. In the 
school, representing the union of ten one-room districts, an at- 
tempt is made to interest the children in the characteristic things of 
their daily lives and link the school with the farm and the home. 
The boys have agricultural projects as a part of their school work 
and the products of their manual training are articles of actual use 
on the farm. The girls are taught to make their own clothing and 
to prepare meals. 
Both the school and the church have exerted a particularly deep 
influence on the social life of the community. In the basement of 
the church is a well-equipped kitchen and dining-room, where com- 
munity spreads and banquets are frequently held. On the main 
floor is a women’s rest room furnished with rockers and couches, 
and beds for small children. The people have organized themselves 
into a community center with a community council in charge, 
which consists of the heads of eight prominent organizations. ’\ 
The council at the beginning of the school year arranges a program 
of social, educational, musical, and athletic events which are held 
weekly in the schoolhouse when possible. 
At the beginning of the summer, the community council now pre- 
pares a program of outdoor amusements, held every two weeks in 
the grove, consisting of organized play and story hour for children, 
baseball contests, band concerts, motion pictures, and community, 
picnics. The community picnic has assumed an important place in 
the social life of the people and each year finds at least one such 
gathering by both old and young, sponsored by such organizations, 
vas the grange, boys’ and girls’ clubs, the cow-testing association, 
Holstein association, public school, Sunday school, church, or 
W.C.T.U. These are augmented by the harvest home picnic, to 
which old residents come back; the new-comers’ picnic; the Fourth 
of July picnic; and family picnics.

414 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
The advantages which come from school leadership are 
many. The kind and amount of community activity can be 
controlled in the interests of the community at large, and the 
program can be based on fundamentals, instead of being 
superficial. It assumes a permanency due to control by a 
continuous body which private management does not always 
give. It makes for economy, since there is no need for addi- 
tional outlay for facilities. Genuine democracy is achieved, 
because all citizens are received on a basis of equality and 
not on a basis of ability to pay. Character and intelligence 
determine one’s usefulness in the organization, rather than 
the size of his subscription. The school in return profits by 
the greater confidence of the people and a deeper conscious- 
ness of its usefulness. i 
The kind of organization. After having decided that the 
school must take the lead in organizing the community, the 
next step is to decide what kind of organization should be 
made. There are three forms to choose from, each having 
advantages under given circumstances.’ The three forms 
are: 
1. The unit form. 
2. The federated or council form. 
8. The unit-federated form, a combination of (1) and (2). 
By the unit form is meant a single comprehensive and 
democratic organization. It embraces all the people, and 
each person has a voice and a vote in its management. It is 
particularly well suited to unorganized communities (type 4) 
that are small enough so all the people’can meet together at 
its business and social affairs. 
The federated form is representative in character. It is 
composed of delegates from existing organizations who meet 
together in a council to attend to matters that are of general 
and common interest, and to codrdinate effort. It is best 
suited to well-organized communities (type 2). The third
-P-A-G-E-429
  ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 415 
type supplies both the general organization and a federated 
council. The council may act as members of the executive 
committee, or may simply meet with the officers of the gen- 
eral organization in conference. It is most useful in com- 
munities that are over-organized (type 3), but has a real 
function in the organized but uncoérdinated community. 
The communities that are without working organizations 
are likely to be few in number. There is more likely to be a 
multiplicity of associations, with competition for leaders and 
funds, and the activities also may take these directions. In 
the State of California there are 7500 chartered societies; ina 
small city a survey reported 233 organizations. Many over- 
lap in functions, and, in spite of the number, it is possible 
that there are functions entirely neglected. However this 
may be, taking a typical consolidated district, one may 
expect to find the following divergences, many of them 
organized: 
1. From three to six religious denominations. 
2. Three racial groups maintaining societies. 
8. Two segments of trade areas, differing from the district 
center. 
4, Two different telephone service groups. 
5. Members of the-Farmers’ Union and non-members, 
6. Three women’s clubs, social in nature. 
7. Two patriotic associations. 
8. Five fraternal organizations. 
9. The American Red Cross. 
10. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union. 
11. The parent-teachers association. 
12. Four young people’s clubs. 
While these do not signify widely separated interests, 
they are all factors to be considered in the campaign of 
unification. There will also be other elements around which: 
community sentiment and a substantial community organ- 
ization may be built. In the same community as described 
above, the following general interests existed:
-P-A-G-E-430
416 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
. Free rural mail delivery. 
. Mostly one-trade area. 
. Subscribers to a common community newspaper. 
. Common agricultural problems. 
Common road problems. 
Common health problems. 
. A general desire for better conditions of living. 
. Common library facilities from the public school. 
. The common consolidated school. WOARDA DP wwe 
/> 
In such a situation as this, it seems that it would be practic- 
able to introduce any one of the three type forms of organi- 
zation. A more delicate question concerns how the organiza- 
tion should be commenced. 
How to begin the organization. In beginning an organi- 
zation, the principal may take his choice of one of two 
methods. One may be called the informal way, the other 
the formal way. The informal method takes more time, but 
is usually successful. The formal method may be put into 
effect almost at once, but its success is not assured any 
earlier than by the informal way. 
A concrete illustration will serve to indicate what is meant 
by the informal beginning. A consolidated school, in which 
PB the principal had worked several years, was located in a one- 
crop area. The principal had come to believe that a transi- 
tion to a diversified system of industry was desirable. 
There were plenty of organizations in the community, but 
they were working independently of each other. The prin- 
cipal decided to appeal to the extension division of the 
State Agricultural College, and explained the situation in 
detail. The director suggested a week’s institute, at which 
time experts from the college would take up matters of in- 
terest to men and women, and especially those that turned 
about the improvement of farming. He agreed to meet all 
the expenses with the exception of local advertising and 
quarters for the meetings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
  
ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 417 
Upon receiving the proposition from the college, the prin- 
cipal called into conference several public spirited citizens 
of the community and explained it to them. ‘They were en- 
thusiastic about the prospects for a community institute, as 
it was suggested the meeting be called. An organization, 
with the principal at the head, was forthwith perfected, and 
plans launched for the institute, which was set at about six 
weeks in the future. 
Subsequent steps in planning consisted in: 
1. Finding a place for the meetings. This was settled by select- 
ing the school as the logical place. High-school pupils were 
permitted to attend the institute in lieu of classes. 
2. Leaders were appointed for each session. 
8. A committee on luncheon arrangement was selected, the 
domestic science teacher with several of the high-school girls 
codperating. 
4. Publicity was arranged for. 
5. Registration blanks were printed. These explained the 
purpose of the meetings, gave the program, and left a blank 
for the signature of each person who wished to attend. They 
were circulated by the school children, and over four hundred 
returned signed at the end of the first week. 
Shortly before the date set for the institute, a member of 
the community suggested that some of the products of the 
section be exhibited. It was received favorably, and a small 
but rather choice exhibit was prepared. It featured things 
that were related to the contemplated program and its ob- 
jectives. Those who participated were proud of their part 
in the program, and it led to much discussion. 
The meetings were remarkably well attended, and the in- 
terest was great. On the next to the last day, the subject of 
future institutes was broached. The idea was enthusias- 
tically received. The director of the extension division 
thereupon appointed a committee, with the school principal 
as chairman, to offer plans for the next year. In the discus-
-P-A-G-E-432
  418 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
sion it was brought out that what was needed was a perma- 
nent community organization. An outline was drawn up 
and offered the next day. With certain improvements, 
which grew out of the general consideration given, the plan 
as adopted embraced: 
1. A unified community organization, including all citizens from 
sixteen up. 
2. A decision to hold an annual community institute with the 
help of the State College, an exhibit to be a regular feature. 
8. The meeting place and general headquarters to be the school 
house. 
4. Committees for leadership on: (1) community industry, 
(2) community finance, (8) community health, (4) commu- 
nity recreation, (5) community education, and (6) commu- 
nity publicity were provided for. 
Accomplishments to which the organization points are as 
follows: 
1. The holding of an annual community institute and fair. 
2. The gradual introduction of dairying, fruit-raising, poultry- 
raising, and, in general, a better system of farming. 
8. The purchase and improvement of a community park and 
recreation ground. 
4. The building of better roads leading to the school, and the 
planting of trees. 
5. The enlargement of the school library, and its extension te 
the entire community. 
6. An annual better-health campaign, and the employment of a 
school nurse. 
7. The publication of a community annual. 
8. The adoption of a budget system for all community activities. 
The formal method. Even in the formal method some 
preparation is advisable. The principal] should lead in 
bringing to the community a realization of its own need. 
This can be done through talking the matter over with 
smaller organizations, and through interesting key individ- 
uals. Questions may be talked over at the school assembly,
-P-A-G-E-433
    ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 419 
articles may be run in the school and the community news- 
papers, and personal letters may be written. When this 
preparation has been made a meeting to perfect an organiza- 
tion should be called. It is a good idea to send every person 
in the community a special invitation to be present. The 
purpose of the purposed organization should be stated, and 
a program of the first meeting should be enclosed. 
Arrangements should be made for a few short speeches on 
the advantages of organization. If it is possible to secure 
the help of a trained organizer from the State College, it 
should by all means be done. The program should be care- 
fully prepared, and should be a fair model for programs of 
the future. It should be understood that meetings are only 
incidents in the whole community organization program, 
and that much of the real work will be done elsewhere. Asa 
type of what may be expected at the first meeting, the pro- 
gram below is given: 
1. Meeting called to order, and brief statement of its purpose 
made. 
. Music by local talent. 
. Community singing. 
. Four-minute speeches by two or three influential members of 
the community on definite needs of the group, and the value 
of codperation. 
. Address by an outside organizer. 
. Discussion. 
. Motion to organize community association. 
. Election of temporary officers. 
. Appointment of committees to draft constitution, prepare 
program, ete.

Planning the community program. When the club is 
organized and going, it must, in order to keep alive, concern
-P-A-G-E-434
  420 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
itself with problems of local importance. Theoretical dis- 
cussions with no local application will cause the club to die 
an early death. Meetings given over entirely to entertain- 
ment will pervert its purposes. Discussion should have its 
place, as at the first meeting, but it should result in some 
definite plan of action for carrying out a desirable com- 
munity project. The group should not drift aimlessly from 
project to project, but should follow a well-defined plan, 
worked out for some years in advance. When such pro- 
cedure is followed, conscious community improvement be- 
comes a reality. Planning of this constructive kind com- 
prises four features: 
1. Planning what to do. 
2. Planning who is to do it. 
3. Planning when it is to be done. 
4. Planning how it is to be done. 
Planning what to do. Two chief principles apply to this 
aspect of planning. First, the program should be planned 
with conscious needs of the community in mind. If the unit 
organization method is adopted, whatever is done will spring 
from the wishes of the majority, and the likelihood of a few 
turning the club’s efforts towards activities which most are 
not aware of needing is very small. People will not support 
a health program, a community library, nor a better- 
streets plan unless they feel the need and desire such im- 
provement. Second, the leaders must take account of the 
influence of success, and guide the group into activities 
which are within reasonable possibilities. Trying to do tco 
much, trying to do things that are too difficult, and under- 
taking things which the people are not ready for mean fail- 
ures. Two or three failures are enough to ruin any one’s 
reputation as a leader. 
The projects which we list below, therefore, are only sug- 
gestive. Some of them may not be needed in a community,
-P-A-G-E-435
  ' ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 421 
or there may be other things which are more badly needed. 
Some may be too difficult, in the present stage of develop- 
ment of a given community. Some may be well adapted to 
organization interests, abilities, and needs, while they may 
also indicate projects which will do for the future. They 
have the virtue of having been the subject of successful coms 
munity effort many times:

-P-A-G-E-436
  422 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
Selecting the workers. Common observation shows that 
most of the real community service is performed by a few 
people. This results in their over-working, and actually pre- 
vents the community from getting done what ought to be 
done. The plan should be therefore to give every one some- 
thing to do. There will of course be some who will accom- 
plish nothing, but if the non-workers are put on committees 
with workers the latter may be able to teach them and lead 
them until they finally become useful members. Second, 
the special committee system is better than standing com- 
mittees; and small committees are better than large. The 
educational idea should be kept to the front by having a 
leader for each group who will take responsibility, and teach 
the others what to do and how to do it. 
Determining the time. Two types of projects may be 
distinguished. They are those that require a long time for 
completion, and those that require a short time. Both 
should be kept going at the same time, but the short projects 
should generally be more numerous. There are not many 
people who have the vision and the courage to keep working 
away without having account taken of their efforts and 
getting some recognition. Therefore, every month or so, 
every group should be commended for its efforts and as con- 
crete a showing as possible made of its achievements. It is 
fundamental that whenever a project is assigned that a date 
for its completion be set. Thus there will be projects which 
are to be completed in a month, others that will take a half 
year, others that will demand a whole year, while some of 
the more seasoned and intelligent workers may start on five- 
or ten-year projects. 
Determining the method. The working groups should de- 
termine their own methods of work. Only one factor that is 
common will need to come before the whole body. This is 
the financial problem. This will be minimized if it is early
-P-A-G-E-437
  
ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 423 
decided to keep expenses down to absolute necessities. The 
second essential is to budget everything and, except in emer- 
gencies, keep within the budget. Third, it is usually better 
to keep away from dues and assessments so far as possible. 
It is better to try to raise money by some other method — 
charging for admission to an occasional entertainment, giv- 
ing dinners, or some such device. If this is done, every 
one will feel that he belongs to the association independ- 
ently of whether he makes large financial contributions or 
not. This is the first purpose to be attained. When the 
feeling of membership is an experience of every one, almost 
all will be willing to sacrifice if necessary to finance the com- 
mon enterprises. 
Examples of community enterprise. Within recent years, 
many accounts of the codperative activity of rural communi- 
ties have been published. The best of these are to be found 
in consolidated school districts, clearly showing that educa- 
tional codperation is an index to general common effort. A 
number of the typical achievements are enumerated here for 
the purpose of showing what lines have proved most produc- 
tive, as well as for the purpose of increasing the faith in the 
possibilities of joint endeavor. 
1. Marion Center, Pennyslvania, organized a community as- 
sociation to purchase a community park and “to preserve it 
forever for the free use of the people.” Four hundred citizens 
contributed to the purchase fund. Volunteers have cleared 
the tract, put in tile drains, built roads and walks, put in 
benches and tables, prepared an athletic field, and con- 
structed a community house. Concession privileges pay for 
maintenance. 
2. Worthington, Connecticut, purchased property and built 
a recreation center. Much of the money was raised by 
popular subscription, and many donations in labor and 
materials have been made. ‘The clubhouse is used by the 
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, parent-teacher association, women’s *

aid society, Daughters of the American Revolution, mothers 
club, and men’s club. Fairs, exhibits, dances, food sales, 
lectures, and card parties are held in the building. The or- 
ganization, in the words of one of its leaders, “is drawing all 
people together in a spirit of mutual helpfulness and develop- 
ing a neighborhood atmosphere which speaks well for the 
future permanence and welfare of the community.” 
Eagle Rock, California, has made an unique contribution in 
the form of a beautiful library building and grounds. The 
trees, shrubs, and flowers came from private homes, and 
citizens joined in the actual work of planting. The library is 
supported by a general tax. > 
. Granby, Connecticut, is notable for its development of a 
rural civic center. The first effort centered about the im- 
provement of the appearance of the approach and the main 
street. Shade and ornamental trees were planted, paths and 
tennis courts laid out, and a waste space formally dedicated 
asacity park. The next step was the codrdination of plans 
for a library, church, and community school into one enter- 
prise. The church gave a site of about four acres, and upon 
it were erected a church, a library, a community house, and a 
school. 
The Hudson, Iowa, consolidated school lists the following 
community activities: club meetings, a farmers’ short course, 
motion picture programs, picnics, Christmas programs, com- 
munity volley ball, and a lecture course. 
. The Lakeview, Michigan, consolidated school has the activ- 
ities which follow associated with the school: community 
club, parent-teachers association, dramatic club, boy scouts, 
girl reserves, glee club, and athletic association. 
Bernice, Louisiana, has an organization which for nearly 
twenty years has been engaged in loyal and effective com- 
munity service. Its methods of working as well as its accom- 
plishments are worthy of notice. A club calendar or working 
plan is prepared at the beginning of the year. The plans are 
carried out by small committees — usually three members to 
each. There are five standing committees: library, school, 
social, town, and cemetery, and special committees are ap- 
pointed as needed. The organization owns its building and 
grounds, and has established a community house, equipped 
with rest room, assembly, reading room, and kitchen.
-P-A-G-E-439
  ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 425 
The club has planted trees and flowers about the consoli- 
dated school building, and purchased $600 worth of play- 
ground equipment. A few years ago it took over the problem 
of rejuvenating a small park at the edge of town. Brush and 
rubbish were cleaned away, decorative plantings made, a 
pavilion erected, and electric lights installed. 
. Houma, Louisiana, has owed its progress to an enterprising 
association of commerce. It reports that the first two anda 
half years were mainly devoted to “missionary work.” None 
of the great projects were completed — several of them 
barely started — but the spirit of codperation was developed 
and the parish widely advertised. 
The main objects of the association are agricultural 
development, better marketing conditions, and better local 
organization. It has assisted in the organization of other 
community groups. It codperates actively with the agricul- 
tural agent. It originated the idea of holding community 
agricultural fairs, and leads in\the management of the parish 
fair. 
One further illustration is worth presenting, both for 
methods and for results. It refers to the work of the com- 
munity church in Loranger, Louisiana. The pastor, on com- 
ing to the community, “‘found the people divided into ‘na- 
tives’ and ‘colonists,’ with the division carried into the 
school, the church, and community matters in general... . It 
did not take long to see the situation, and to learn that the life 
of the church and of the community depended upon harmoniz- 
ing and unifying these discordant elements. On Thanksgiv- 
ing Day an all-day meeting was held in the church. After 
dinner the pastor called the men together in the auditorium 
to talk over community matters. From this meeting an 
organization was formed known as the Loranger Agricultural 
Union.” 
First efforts were devoted to building up an interest in the 
day school, in developing around it the agricultural and 
economic units, and to bringing it to the place where it could 
have an accredited high-school department. Through com- 
munity gatherings in the interest of the school, and by per- 
sonal efforts, a good spirit has been created and the school is 
now prosperous. Other things accomplished are: (1) regular 
meetings of the farmers to study scientific agriculture, (2) co-
-P-A-G-E-440
  426 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
operation with the county agent and state extension depart- 
ment in agricultural education, (3) an annual agricultural 
short-course has been held, (4) a cow-testing association or- 
ganized and a milk-cooling plant established, (5) an annual 
community fair, (6) a community shed for the exhibit erected, 
(7) a sweet-potato curing house constructed, (8) a moving- 
picture machine put into the church, and (9) a movement got 
under way to put in a radio outfit. 
The unorganized community. The single unit organiza- 
tion seldom satisfies all the interests and needs of a com- 
munity. There is no reason why the school should not also 
help in promoting special group activities, affiliating them 
with the larger association. The inter-stimulation which 
results in creative, original production by groups takes place 
only where there is decided homogeneity, and homogeneity 
is more likely to exist in the small group than in the large. 
A large number of distinctly unified small groups may give 
the greatest strength to the federation or large group, and at 
the same time be the simpler to administer. The forms 
for which there are good precedent are four in number. 
They are: 
1. Social. 
2. Economic. 
8. Cultural. 
4. Welfare. 
A single organization may embrace all these functions. 
The clubs and societies of a juvenile type mentioned in 
Chapter XIV are among the best examples of the social 
clubs. Their aim is the worthy employment of leisure time, 
and interest in the activities is one of their prime essentials. 
For adults, reading clubs, card clubs, dancing clubs, and the 
like are illustrative. If they do not monopolize too much 
time they may prove valuable community assets. From the 
practical point of community administration they supply an 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
      ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 427 
/ 
‘agency by which a considerable number of people can be 
reached, and their influence brought to bear upon commu- 
nity problems. 
The Grange is a good example of an economic organiza- 
tion., It provides one of the best means for unified group 
action on practical matters, because it is representative and 
includes men and women in its membership. Social activi- 
ties enter also into its programs. The national interests of 
the Grange reduce its community interests somewhat, and 
its strength is best expressed in the community through 
affiliation with a general organization. However, every 
community should have some distinctly economic associa- 
tion — Grange, Farmers’ Union, or Commercial Club. If 
there is none, the principal should help supply the need. 
Cultural clubs are growing in number. Their object is the 
expansion of the knowledge of the members through reading, 
‘study, discussion, and lectures, or through furthering com- 
mon skills in painting, music, nature study, or writing. 
The membership is not usually large, but those who belong 
are noted for loyalty and faithful attendance. Clubs of this 
kind often appeal to the better class of young people who 
have finished high school — a group, by the way, for which 
provision is seldom made in the community program. 
Young married people will also often join, together with the 
better educated women. . A consolidated school community 
should have four or five associations of this kind. 
The W.C.T.U., the Civic Club, and the Parent-Teacher 
Association may be given as examples of typical welfare 
societies. The last has come in to fill the gap resulting from 
the decreased participation of voters in school planning. The 
‘organization helps to make the difference between an 
average and a superior school. The average school has ad- 
vantage of the resources which come through official chan- 
nels. The superior school not only has these advantages,   
  
-P-A-G-E-442
   
   428 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION ° 
but in addition all the unofficial and voluntary contributions 
of the community. Some of the tangible results of the asso- 
ciation’s efforts may be seen from scanning the list below, 
showing what associations have done: 
1. Provided playgrounds and equipment, and supplemented 
that provided by the district. 
2. Supplied musical instruments — phonograph, pianos, and 
band and orchestra instruments. 
. Introduced and managed school lunches. 
. Supplemented the school instruction in various ways. 
. Carried on better health campaigns. 
. Improved attendance and reduced tardiness, 
. Furnished aid to needy children. 
. Put in dental clinics. 
. Provided entertainment to pupils and teachers, 
10. Helped in advancing the salaries of the teachers, 
11. Aided in getting better buildings. 
12. Offered incentives for better school work. 
13. Combated unsanitary and immoral conditions which affect 
the school. 
14, Created sentiment for the vacation school and the supervised 
playground. 
15. Improved the school library. CMOIWH oS 
A few suggestions concerning organization are pertinent. 
The local association should affiliate as soon as possible with 
the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher As- 
sociations. This will add dignity to the movement, and will 
make available the experience and plans of national leaders. 
It is the best way to prevent that unwise meddling in school 
affairs of which some principals complain. Second, a defin- 
ite program for a year should be made up and followed. 
The function of the principal is to keep the group engaged in 
worth-while projects. If this is done, the association will 
prove the best ally to better schools and a better community. 
The community church and Sunday School. Rural sur- 
veys of the past decade have brought forcibly to mind the 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  
ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 429 
decline of the old-type rural church. It seems that the 
school must to-day assume a larger share of the moral 
and religious education of the community. A competitive 
struggling of denominations in communities is economically 
unsound and religiously inefficient. The presence of several 
small-church units, suffering economic and numerical pov- 
erty, can make at best only a small contribution towards 
community integration. Whatever may be said for church 
divisions on other grounds, they do not make for unified ef- 
fort in small communities. On the other hand, it seems 
logical to hold that in an area where the moral, religious, 
social, and economic needs of the people are practically the 
same, these needs could best be met by unifying the forces 
concerned with them. 
In the consolidated district, with the community-service 
type of building, the material equipment at least for a com- 
munity church and Sunday School already exist. The 
problem is to bring about that psychological unity which 
will result in its proper use for moral and religious education. 
The contention is not that, at this stage. the moral and re- 
ligious subject-matter with which the churches deal should 
be incorporated into the public school curriculum, though 
there are some indications that in the future society may be 
driven to some such procedure. It should be pointed out, 
nevertheless, that where a community has invested heavily 
in its community-center building — the school — it is poor 
economy to let it stand idle even one day out of seven. Thus 
conditions are everywhere pointing to a seven-day schedule 
for the community school plant. 
There are great advantages in having the school building 
for Sunday School uses. There are rooms of different sizes 
to suit the varying classes. There are seats to fit the pupils. 
Each group may be alone, thus avoiding the babel which 
prevails in the ordinary church Sunday School. There are
-P-A-G-E-444
Oe Ree Ae ee ta Tes Cs sem en eT eR Te eae PRE Eee ee Cee n tr ae ele wee Le 
430 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
few churches so well fitted for Sunday School purposes as is 
the public school building. It facilitates greatly the use of 
the graded lessons. 
How the school may help. There is much the school may 
now do. It can build up community sentiment favorable to 
union Sunday Schools. No superficial organization should 
be created. This signifies that the idea should not be forced 
upon the people, but should grow out of united enlightened 
sentiment. Material is available which the principal can 
use in building up ideas favorable to the plan. The com- 
munity association can make this problem one for their in- 
vestigation. Printed and illustrated material, motion pic- 
ture films, and lectures may be had from the state colleges. 
It is best not to argue the question. It is a matter for free 
discussion and the dissemination of knowledge. 
If the community-church idea is adopted, no pains should 
be spared to obtain the services of a pastor worthy of the 
name. He should know and understand rural conditions 
and believe in the possibilities of rural life. The closest co- 
operation should prevail between the pastor and the princi- 
pal of the school.. When this condition exists the community 
work may be more equally divided, so that neither carries an 
excessive burden. The school should realize that it shares 
in the obligation for moral and religious instruction, should 
put its facilities freely at the use of the church, and should 
lend such other encouragement as is practicable. 
The community-church idea illustrated. A striking 
example of a community church in connection with a con- 
solidated school is found at Monte Vista, Colorado. Here 
the parsonage, an eight-room modern house, is on the 
school grounds side by side with the teacherage, mechanic’s 
cottage, and the superintendent’s house. The pastor is a 
community leader, trained for his job, and paid a respectable 
salary. He works hand in hand with the principal of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-445
ORGANIZING THE COMMUNITY 481 
school. The growth of the community church has kept pace 
with the progress of the school. 
Nine different denominations and many individuals not 
formerly connected with any church are included in the 
membership. The churches which are affiliated in this 
community organization are Methodist, Presbyterian, 
Christian, Congregationalist, Baptist, Lutheran, United 
Brethren, Dutch Reformed, and Latter-Day Saints. The 
Sunday School enrollment exceeds that of the public school. 
Graded instruction is given by trained teachers, and the 
young people’s societies are in a flourishing condition. No 
one whohas visited this Sunday School and church at work 
would ever again voice the argument that holding religious 
services in a public school tends to detract from its sacred 
significance. It would be difficult to find a more earnest and 
sincere group of workers anywhere. The church was organ- 
ized in 1918, and is therefore well past the experimental 
stage. 
Organization principles. Supplementing the directions 
which have been given are the following principles of success- 
ful community organization: 
1. The organization in its control and working methods must be 
kept democratic, free from sectarianism and partisanship, 
supplementary not rival, and absolutely unconnected with 
financial gain. 
2. The relationships and loyalty of an individual to a group or 
groups must not be lessened or estranged in order to relate him 
to the larger community. On the other hand, every effort 
should be made to preserve the integrity and strength of the 
smaller groups. 
8. Freedom of opinion should be resolutely guarded, and the 
views of every one held in respect. 
4, The widest publicity should be given to the proceedings of the 
organization and its committees. 
5. Effort should be made to train many workers within the or-
-P-A-G-E-446
  432 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
ganization, and the group made independent of extra-com- 
munity stimulation and help. 
6. Only projects in which there is every promise of success shet:.:! 
be initiated at first. 
7. Committees should be appointed for special purposes and no 
standing committees retained. It is well to keep the com- 
mittees small. 
8. Commence with small budgets and always practice the great- 
est economy in expenditures. 
Have a period of stock-taking at least once a year at which 
time officers and committees examine their procedure crit- 
ically, and take note of results. ° 
Summary. The people of a consolidated school district 
“have many objectives which they wish to realize. To do 
this they ordinarily have several small group organizations. 
They need, moreover, a larger and more inclusive organiza- 
tion to increase their group consciousness and codperative 
efficiency. The community association is a desirable form 
for this purpose. Either the informal or the formal method 
of initiating such codperation may be followed. A very 
definite program should be prepared, with emphasis upon 
the solution of projects and not upon discussion. If small 
group organizations are lacking, the school should help to 
emplant them. One subsidiary association of great value is 
the parent-teacher association. Another is the community 
church and Sunday School. All organization, to be success- 
ful, should be based on sound principles.

  CHAPTER XXIII 
THE PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATIONAL 
ENGINEERING 
Getting perspective. The writers of this book have main- 
tained, as consistently as possible throughout, the point of 
view of the principal as an educational engineer. As such 
he brings things to pass. He does not sit patiently by and 
wait for things to happen. He does not alternate periods of 
stress and hurry with periods of do-nothing. He is not a 
mere opportunist who is able to capitalize only the unusual 
occasions when chance favors. On the contrary, he is a per- 
son who prepares himself for his tasks, plans them wisely, 
and keeps pushing forward persistently all the time. He 
meets reverses, but is not dismayed by them. If he finds 
progress impossible or too expensive in one direction, he 
does not yield up his objective but tries a new method of 
attack. 
With so many necessary duties to perform he is tied 
closely to his job. He is occupied day after day with details 
which he cannot delegate to others, for the good reason that 
there is no one else to delegate them to. He needs, therefore, 
at times to withdraw himself somewhat from immediate 
contact with the routine of the day, and to examine impar- 
tially and as impersonally as he can the whole process and 
the whole result. It is in this sense of putting meaning into 
the great educational program which he directs, to see where 
it is going, to plan anew and on a broad, generous scale, that 
the term educational engineering is used. 
Guiding principles. The deep significance of education 
will be more evident to the principal if he observes his own
-P-A-G-E-450
436 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
school in the light of several determining factors. We have 
a situation here somewhat analogous to that of teaching an 
individual pupil. Assume that the teacher has worked 
faithfully and consistently. In checking up on her per- 
formance, the principal must take into account many factors. 
If the teacher has given full care to the needs of the pupils 
and taught them as much as their capacities permitted, she 
has been justified. If their performance is below the level of 
their respective capacities, the principal will necessarily in- 
quire into the attendant circumstances to find out if there is 
anything not under her control which has been responsible 
for the deficiency. This is done, not for the purpose of ex- 
cusing the teacher, but to provide against the occurrence 
of similar retarding influences in the future. 
It is somewhat the line that the principal should follow in 
taking stock of the progress of the school. The underlying 
principles at stake may be illustrated through the following 
questions: 
1. Has the school program taken account of the needs of the 
people of the present? Has it moved along the lines of direc- 
tion indicated by these needs? 
2. Has the program been planned and executed with an under- 
standing of the resources of the community which supports it, 
to the end that it may minister to needs without exploitation? 
8. Has it been so wisely planned and executed as to have gained 
and kept the support and confidence of the people? 
4. Is it on a sound basis so that gradual and continuous growth is 
possible and sure of approval? 
Examining needs. The technique of this examination of 
the school is well illustrated in the modern survey whose ap- 
plication to a specific school by the principal is made clear in 
Professor Sears’s recent book, The School Survey. For the 
purpose of giving the principal a general view of the balance 
between needs and abilities and performance the method of
-P-A-G-E-451
  
PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATIONAL ENGINEERING 437 
attack should be simple and straightforward, with the atten- 
tion centered on a few points rather than on many. With 
this qualification, the minimum account which should be 
taken of needs includes: 
1. Data on population: 
a. Total population and rate of growth, the latter pro- 
jected into the future twenty to thirty years. 
b. School population, with at least three divisions: pupils 
which should be in school, pupils in school, and pupils not 
in school but who may reasonably be expected to attend 
school if inducements were offered. These figures should 
also be projected into the future and represented graph- 
ically. 
c. Age distribution of the population. 
d. Racial distribution of the population. 
e. Literacy distribution of the population. 
f. Schooling distribution of the population. 
g. Geographical distribution of the population. 
h. Industries — present status, recent growth, probable 
future growth. 
t. Economic condition of the population, noting particu- 
larly whether education in production or education in 
consumption is needed in the same proportions or not. 
With the facts as indicated before him, the principal can 
make a statement of the needs of the community. For con- 
venience in planning these may be stated in two parts: 
(1) needs of the pupils in school, and (2) needs of those who 
are not in school but who should be. Each may be further 
analyzed as: (1) minimum needs which the school should 
meet, (2) additional needs which it would be highly desir- 
able for the school to meet, and (3) further needs which it is 
desirable but not essential that the school meet. Probably 
after all the best single index to the quantitative needs of the 
school is the proportion of pupils who ought to be in school, 
conditions being satisfactory if the school in this respect 
ranked in the upper twenty-five per cent, taking the coun-
-P-A-G-E-452
    438 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
try as a whole. For the kind of needs, one might set the 
standard as of that character which will educate to the level 
of the upper twenty-five per cent, taking the country as a 
whole. Should the local standard already be higher, the 
upper twenty-five per cent of the community may be taken 
as a desirable standard. 
Examining abilities. The abilities of the district to sup- 
port schools can also only be measured relatively. Taking 
survey standards again as a guide, we may gather facts on 
these points:+ 
1.. Wealth of the district. This should include the total, the per 
capita using total population, and the per capita using school 
population. 
. Income on the same basis. 
. Outside aid — county, state, and national. 
. Industries. The growth factor should not be overlooked here 
nor in any other element, and the figures should be projected 
into the future, as was suggested in the paragraph ori needs. 
5. Undeveloped resources expressed in totals and per-capita 
values. 
6. Past outlays. 
'. Demands for credit service, such as interest. 
8. Proportion of the population in the various age-groups, with 
the percentage of producing age segregated. 
9. Proportion of the population which are dependent. 
10. Expandability of plant and equipment. wm 09 2 
The matter of abilities is not one that the principal can 
influence much. It is supposed that his inquiry has brought 
to light true abilities, and not what the people think are their 
abilities. If there is a margin between the two, the principal 
has a duty to educate the taxpayers up to the point where 
they will support the schools in proportion to their capaci- 
ties. The best single index to ability is the per-capita in- 
come, as all taxes are paid from it. However, true ability 
will vary according to the evenness of the distribution of
-P-A-G-E-453
PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATIONAL ENGINEERING 439 
income. The potential ability of a district under our present 
method of raising money for schools is greater if there is 
great disparity in the incomes than if they are relatively 
even, provided there is a margin above subsistence needs. 
Examining performance. Performance may be regarded 
in two or three ways. It may be thought of in terms of the 
total and per-capita amount of money spent for school pur- 
poses. It may be thought of in terms of results, particularly 
those measurable by standard tests. Finally, performance 
may be evaluated in terms of the ease and satisfaction with 
which the educational process is carried on. Since we want 
to compare needs, abilities, and performance, it is neces- 
sary for us to have a common unit. They must be reduced 
to some common numerical relationship. The best way we 
have of doing this is to reduce needs, abilities, and per- 
formance to a basis of dollars. Such figures can only be 
relative to figures drawn from other schools. To illustrate 
the general principle, let us assume that there is a district 
which 
1. Needs $60 worth of education per pupil a year. 
2. Is able to buy $75 worth. 
8. Actually buys $45 worth. 
Then we have these ratios: 
1. Between performance and needs 75. 
2. Between performance and ability 60. 
8. Between needs and ability 80. 
In such a district performance can be increased to the 
level of its needs and still not put undue demands upon the 
district.. A situation such as this is fairly good evidence of 
the failure of the principal to convince the people of the 
value of education, or of the presence of very serious ob-' 
stacles to educational progress. 
The teaching force. We do not Pere that the princi-
-P-A-G-E-454
440 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
pal will rest content with his inspection of performance when 
he has simply computed the average per-pupil expenditure. 
There is sometimes a very wide disparity between expendi- 
tures and results. Therefore, he will need to pass in review 
many elements which are identified with the school. The 
most important causal factor of all which the principal has 
more or less control over is the teaching force. In surveying 
the teaching group a number of facts should be brought up 
for inspection and for comparison. Among these are: 
1. The training of the teachers. The presumption is very 
strong that the more efficient teachers have had more training, 
and have had their training at the better institutions. In 
making comparisons, the questions will be asked: (1) Is the 
present teaching force better trained than last year, two 
years ago, five years ago? Is the teaching force better 
trained than the average? 
2. Improvement of the teachers. The main question here is as 
to the extent to which the teachers are utilizing agencies for 
improvement such as extension courses, reading, summer 
schools, institutes. 
8. Experience. Is the average experience greater? Is there a 
tendency for tenure to increase in the local school? 
4. Attitudes. This covers such matters as loyalty, willingness 
to codperate, growth in the confidence of the community, and 
hold upon the children. 
The curriculum. The second most important causal fac- 
tor is the curriculum. As the counterpart of a rapidly 
changing society adapted to child nature, one important 
test may be applied to it. This is the degree to which revi- 
sion has been made. While one cannot feel perfect assur- 
ance that because every subject has been gone over thor- 
oughly in the two-year or five-year period of the survey, if 
nothing or next to nothing has been done he can rest per- 
fectly assured that the curriculum is not adapted to the 
needs of the day. On the other hand, it should be ix con-

  PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATIONAL ENGINEERING 441 
stant revision. A good example can be drawn from city 
schools, where committees of teachers are at work all the 
time adding to, eliminating from, and building anew the 
body of teaching materials. 
The methods themselves come in for scrutiny. There 
should be something new under trial all the time. Here is a 
teacher just out of training school. She brings some new 
ideas of method. Here is another who has picked up some 
suggestions on technique from her visits to other schools, 
from reading. or from her summer school instruction. Still 
another may be fruitful in initiating new ways of doing 
things. All the ideas should be given a test, not on a big 
scale, but thoughtfully and conservatively, with the experi- 
mental purpose uppermost. A school that is not weaving 
into its practices gradually but systematically some of the 
results of the scientific movement in education is not the 
kind of school that is suited to modern-day needs. Its per- 
formance is almost certain to be inferior, or at the point of 
dropping below the standard. 
The material equipment. The principal’s thinking should 
also turn to the material equipment — the plant and all that 
appertains to it. Has his policy been marked by a gradual 
improvement — putting in new equipment where it is 
needed, and replacing the old as it has worn out or become 
obsolete by a better type and quality? If he has objective 
measuring devices, in which he is able to show actual pro- 
gress towards the ideal as we now comprehend it, his satis- 
faction will be so much more certain and deserving. On the 
other hand he can take no credit to himself if his survey of 
the schvol plant reveals that its decay is being hastened be- 
cause of abuse and neglect. 
There are two indexes to efficiency in respect to the plant 
besides what can be collected from examining the plant it- 
self. The first is the nature of the policy of repair and
-P-A-G-E-456
  442 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
maintenance. The second is the nature of the policy of new 
construction and new equipment purchases. Where there 
are no carefully developed policies, looking a good many 
years ahead, the existence of a good plant is more or less an 
accident. The tests of plant efficiency then are: 
1. Objective evidence that the buildings and equipment are 
not deteriorating beyond limits which human ingenuity can 
prevent. 
2. A permanent working repair and replacement policy. 
8. A permanent policy of putting up new buildings and adding 
new equipment. 
The principal. The inquiry into school performance 
would be incomplete did the principal fail to give some time 
to self-analysis, and to weighing his own part in the pro- 
gram. There are several reasons why he can afford to give 
attention to this. First of all, he is quite independent in his 
management of the schools. Any supervision by the county 
superintendent is usually casual, infrequent, and lacking in 
plan. Second, he does not have the direction and stimulus 
from his fellows and from an educational leader that comes 
to the principal of the best city schools. 
In the third place, growing somewhat out of the isolation 
of his position, if he is not careful he will develop overconfi- 
dence. In his uncritical thinking he may give himself more 
credit than he deserves. He may have too high an estimate 
of his powers. He may develop that arrogance and over- 
bearing which is fatal to success. It is true that he may find 
his school well organized, enterprising, and dynamic. This 
may be accounted for in more than one way. A more than 
usually wise board may supply the most of the leadership. 
The teachers, through the operation of happy accident, may: 
be more than unusually proficient. The people of the com- 
munity may be extraordinarily intelligent. The children 
may be well trained. The previous administration perhaps 
deserves credit for starting things in the right way.
-P-A-G-E-457
  PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATIONAL ENGINEERING 443 
These points are not made for the purpose of shaking the 
principal’s confidence in himself. Undue humility is not 
more becoming in a principal than superconfidence. The 
theory is that in this task of self-examination he can afford to 
question whether he has been the leader he ought to have 
been, and whether the school could not have got along about 
as well without him. He may ask whether results would 
have not been about the same if a clerk had been hired to at- 
tend to the routine matters, and he had devoted himself to 
class-room teaching. These questions are not at all new. 
Not only have they occurred to the principal himself, but to 
the teachers, the pupils, and to the patrons. There is, in- 
deed, a somewhat pronounced tendency to inquire “Why is 
a school principal?” While the whole force of professional 
opinion and fact is evidence of the worth-whileness of the ad- 
ministrative position, there is at times occasion for reason- 
able doubt whether the administrator controls and directs 
the schools or whether the directing forces are outside of him 
and independent of him. It is to reveal the part that the 
principal plays, and dispassionately to evaluate his influence 
that leads one to raise the question. 
Estimating the worth of the principal’s leadership. Our 
conception of the principal as an educational engineer 
carries the inference that he is able to pass upon the merits of 
his own work. Fortunately he will not lack guiding signs 
altogether. In the many school surveys which have been 
made in the last decade he will find criteria for judging the 
principal. As an example of what the principal ought not to 
be, take the following quotation, written by Professor Cub- 
berley in The Portland Survey: 
Relatively few members of the supervisory force impressed the 
members of the survey staff as being thoroughly alive education- 
ally, or as fully measuring up to the possibilities of the task before 
them. The great majority impressed us as being... dormant
-P-A-G-E-458
  444 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
rather than active. They impressed us as doing very little real 
educational thinking, and as in a way fitting into the system and 
drifting along, doing reasonably well what they were directed to do, 
but showing little or no personal initiative and but little conscious- 
ness of the educational possibilities of their positions. As a class, 
they impressed us as relying mainly upon their past experience and 
as doing but little reading and studying. 
There is no gainsaying the proposition that these princi- 
pals which have been described were not as forcefully pro- 
gressive as they should have been. This “holding the mirror 
up to nature” as was done by the survey staff, had the effect 
of letting them see what their limitations were and of point- 
ing out the way of improvement. Although it is necessary 
to bring defects into high relief at times in order that they 
may be remedied, it is far better if the principal’s course of 
action is such that he is never very far from the best path. 
Prevention is always preferable to correction. To this end, 
and to make the analysis more thorough, several self-rating 
forms have been devised. In some schools the principal not 
only rates himself, but asks his teachers to do the same. 
We have as an illustration of this practice the form used by a 
California consolidated school principal. 
Functional rating. While such rating devices as the pre- 
- ceding are illuminating, they are not without defects. The 
most serious one is the lack of what we can call functional 
data. So many of the items deal with what the principal is, 
and not with what the principal does. To one whose phil- 
osophy is practical, this is an objection of great weight. In 
line with our thesis at the beginning of the chapter, that the 
principal should take stock of the work of the school, it is 
necessary to devise a check list for the use of the principal in 
self-valuation. With this object in mind the simple scheme 
which follows has been evolved. 
The method of using is also simple. One simply checks

each item in the appropriate column. If the number of 
items checked “Yes” increase with each year we can say 
that the principal is making progress. The items checked 
“No” are the ones to which he should turn his attention. 
The plan therefore is diagnostic, and shows clearly what the 
future action ought to be. The list of items may be ex- 
panded indefinitely. 
Planning for the future. The use of such a scheme as the 
preceding has another function. It indicates what should 
be done in the future. Suppose that there are fifty true 
essentials of an ideal consolidated school. Applying’ our 
checking device, we find that ten are lacking in the school in 
question. ‘The sensible thing is to introduce the necessary 
practices as soon as possible. From a practical point of 
view, one will not try to do too much at once. A new prin- 
cipal, or a young one anxious to make a record, can easily 
ruin his chances for success and, more important, retard the 
progress of the school by trying to do too much. One should 
go as fast as the people can assimilate the new ideas. 
A mere check list of presence or absence of an item also 
overlooks another vital matter, that of quality. In our form 
above we have taken no account of how good the policies and 
practices of the principal are. The community may be or- 
ganized, but it may be dead to all activities that advance its 
welfare. One reason for hesitating to mark these items on a 
qualitative scale is that: we have no adequate standards for a 
number of them. However, if one wishes, he may extend the 
card by adding other columns in which he would check 
“how good” the school is in respect to each. The scale 
could not be very fine, but one might distinguish classes as 
follows: 
1. Superior — ranks with the best ten per cent. 
2. Very good — ranks with the twenty-five per cent below the 
best.
-P-A-G-E-462
    448 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
8. Average — ranks with the thirty per cent below the very 
good. 
4, Fair — ranks with the twenty-five per cent below average. 
5. Poor — ranks with the lowest ten per cent. 
Items also vary in value. There are some which we have 
enumerated without which a school is almost worthless. 
There are others which it can dispense with and still be 
relatively strong. If the principal can pick out the things 
which his school does not have, and then arrange them in 
order of importance or feasibility, he would then have the 
basis for a good plan for the future. Assuming that four or 
five new practices would be all he would try to adopt in a 
year, he might have a five-year program somewhat as 
follows: 
First year: 
1. Begin the reorganization of the curriculum. 
2. Put the records in good shape. 
8. Eliminate fire, health, and safety hazards. 
4. Begin supervision through professional teachers’ meetings.

1. Reclassify pupils who are retarded.

Getting understanding and support. It is not enough to 
lay out constructive plans. The school is a codperative in- 
stitution, and cannot flourish except as it mects the ap- 
proval of its constituents. The principal may know per- 
fectly well what the great social movements are with which 
he should align his school, and he may know exactly how to 
achieve the objectives. It is not so certain that the move- 
ments and the methods will be so clearly perceived by the 
patrons. If they do not comprehend what is being done and 
why, it is almost certain they will call the principal a vision- 
ary, or, whether they call him that or not, they are pretty 
certain to refuse to endorse and coédperate in plans which 
they do not understand. 
It is right that they should take this attitude. In a 
democratic society the people are entitled to the fullest 
knowledge of the acts and purposes — even the methods — 
of their agents. Any disinclination to keep them informed 
is itself a hint of weakness, or, worse, of tyranny. The 
policy should be to begin educating the people as soon as a 
practicable plan is developed. This type of education is 
called school publicity. It must be continuous in order to be 
effective. ‘The following order in which this general educa- 
tion is carried to the community, is suggested: 
 
-P-A-G-E-464
  450 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
. The teachers and the school board. 
. Individuals who are leaders and who are broadminded and 
progressive. 
. Leader groups. 
. The pupils. 
. Larger and more general groups. 
. Isolated and unprogressive individuals. 
2 Oop 
wo 
Methods. The methods of publicity will vary according 
to the facilities at hand, the nature of the project, and the’ 
people to be reached. It should be fully realized that pub- 
licity is not solely for the purpose of “‘putting over” some 
project, however. It has the equally laudable purpose of 
letting the people know what is being done. As has been 
stated, not all matters will be brought before the public for 
approval before they are made a part of the school program; 
many will be introduced first, and then reported upon. It is 
the larger and newer undertakings (especially those which 
are complex, delicate, and difficult to comprehend) which 
should have their way paved in advance. This of necessity 
includes everything upon which the people must vote. 
Of the many publicity agencies and methods available we 
enumerate the following: 
1. The annual report. Should contain an interesting story of 
what the school has done throughout the year, what the 
school owns, what the school’s status is, and what the plans 
for the future are. 
2. The school paper. Every consolidated school should issue a 
weekly paper, and give it general circulation in the commu- 
nity. If the school has its own printing press or mimeograph 
machine, the paper may be financed without advertising. 
The rural high schools of California are spending from $200 
to $800 a year on the antiquated school annual. The pupils 
may save their weekly papers and have them bound at the 
end of the year, thus supplying without extra cost the me- 
mento value of the annual. 
8. The local paper. Even if there is a school paper, news items
-P-A-G-E-465
PRINCIPAL AND EDUCATIONAL ENGINEERING 4651 
and representative samples of school work should be supplied 
the local paper. The amount of material one can get pub- 
lished is increased if the items are typewritten and all ready 
for publication when sent in. 
4. A continuous exhibit. 
5. Addresses, by the principal, teachers, board members, pupils, 
and educators from outside on local school matters. 
6. Entertainments, pageants, festivals put on by the school. 
7. Visitation. 
It is of first importance that matters be tactfully pre- 
sented. All dogmatism ought to be avoided. There should 
be no disposition to force something upon the community. 
Intelligent people resent such an attitude, and will some- 
times oppose a proposition of merit because they have not 
been approached in the right way. The ‘Writers recall hear- 
ing a principal utter a positive statement before a com- 
munity meeting that he and the school board were going to 
put in an up-to-date system of medica] examination before 
the year was out, and also took occasion to speak in uncom- 
plimentary terms of those who might oppose it. As his 
reputation for driving things through had already brought 
on conflicts, a few who were present decided to give him op- 
position. They did it with such success that medical ex- 
aminations are unknown in the school to this day. Had the 
principal called a conference to consider the advisability of 
instituting medical examinations in school, and proposed the 
question as one to be investigated in an open-minded way, 
he would have succeeded with his plan.. The preparation of 
the soil for new ideas is as important as after cultivation. 
Final results.. The fundamental proposition in this book 
is that the rural school ought tb be made and can be made a 
wholesome and effective agency for the improvement of 
human welfare. It will not be a passive institution; it will 
not be simply a mirror of the past and the present. On the 
contrary, it will exert a positive force in directing the present
-P-A-G-E-466
  452 ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION 
and in determining what the future is to be. Since the rise 
of cities, the rural people have been a standing jest as simple- 
minded, unsophisticated, old-fashioned, and easy-going. It 
is the function of the new rural school to reénergize rural 
communities, not for the purpose of evening up old scores, 
but because the power and vigor of rural manhood and 
womanhood is needed in American State and National life, 
and in the larger part which America is to play in the affairs 
of the world. 
In order to do this a new type of school organization has 
been created. It is something to be used; not an end in it- 
self. It requires a leadership of strong and far-seeing per- 
sonalities that typify in a generous way the characters we 
want to develop. It implies in these leaders and in the 
people a certain faith in the future, because they know what 
it is to be.. It is based upon a faith in democratic institu- 
tions that admits of the consideration of no alternative. It 
carries a conviction that even the most perplexing problems 
can be solved through collective intelligence and effort. 
Last of all it stands loyally by the public school as an 
institution through which the best of the past can be per- 
petuated and the needs of the future anticipated.

over which the principal exercises no control. Make up a similar list 
of those which come into his province. Which are more important? 
4. Propose several tests of the leadership of the consolidated school 
principal. 
5. Point out objections to having the teachers rate the principal. Is 
there any advantage in having teachers rate the principal on such 
points as personal appearance, culture and refinement, scholarship,

6. What items would you add to the “Functional Rating Card”? Are 
there any which you would subtract? Discuss reasons. 
7. Criticise the order of individuals and groups for publicity activities. 
Is there any reason why school matters should be broached to the 
teachers before they are taken up with the school board? Discuss. 
8. A good many principals follow the general practice of having new 
ideas come from others. For example, he may get the president of 
the school board to come out first with the declaration that a new 
school building is needed. Teachers may be credited with having 
originated the plan for teaching. Discuss. 
9. What state and national needs can you mention which should be re- 
presented in the local school plan? 
10. What truth is there in the popular idea that rural communities are 
more backward than city communities? If it is true what are the 
probable causes? 
11. What can the school do to remove the causes of community stagna- 
tion? 
12. Summarize, in a brief statement, the purpose of this chapter: the pur- 
« pose of the book.

  PREFACE 
The Teacher’s Technique has been prepared for the 
large group of teachers who are compelled to attack the 
teaching problems of the grammar grades and high 
school with very little training to help them. If it 
proves to be of value to these people it will have ful- 
filled its mission. Although a good background of edu- 
cational theory and educational psychology is to be de- 
sired as a foundation for the technique of teaching, 
those teachers who master the points of teaching . 
method and classroom procedure presented here will 
be better qualified to cope with their problems even 
if they do not have the other training. 
The subject-matter included in this work was col- 
lected for my classes in teaching methods. Conse- 
quently most of the ideas have demonstrated their value 
by actual use. 
The prospective teacher who studies this book will 
master the points of technique more thoroughly if the 
exercises at the ends of the chapters are applied in the 
observation of classroom teaching. Experienced teach- 
ers will find much material in their own work that will 
aid them in interpreting the problems; but they, too, 
may gain by applying their new knowledge in classroom 
observation. It is quite customary for teachers to visit

the work of others as a means of self-improvement. 
Such visitation, however, is not very effective unless 
it is guided intelligently. Casual visitation observes 
nothing, as a rule, except the showy devices. 
The phrase which Tennyson put in the mouth of 
Ulysses, “I am a part of all that I have met,” aptly 
describes my situation. Many teachers and many books 
have contributed to the contents of “The Teacher’s 
Technique.” I am indebted to them and to my college 
students who prepared the lesson plans that are used. I 
am glad to acknowledge especially the help and inspira- 
tion that I received from the late Dr. Charles Hughes 
Johnston. 
- Others to whom I am indebted for ideas and inspira- 
tion are Dr. W. C. Bagley, Dr. L. D. Coffman, Dr. A. R. 
Mead, Dr. M. V. O’Shea and Dr. G. M. Whipple. To 
these and to all others who have contributed a part in 
making this book a possibility I acknowledge my obliga- 
tions.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
  Although here and there individuals may be found 
who although skilful teachers have never made sys- 
tematic study of the technique of teaching, the great 
majority of teachers without such study are working 
ineffectively, wasting energy, and can never develop 
the skill in and love for their work that would have 
been possible with proper professional training. While 
the acceptance of the idea of the fundamental neces- 
sity for professional training of all teachers is not yet 
as general as it should be, it is inevitable that such gen- 
eral acceptance must in time be secured. The contrast 
between the work of the teacher intelligently trained 
in the technique of his profession and one without such 
training is so great that even the layman observing the 
work of the two cannot fail to realize it. 
Technique, however, involves far more than famili- 
arity with certain devices making for systematic use 
of time and economic organization. A teacher with 
good technique must have knowledge in the light of 
current educational thought of all the factors that con- 
- dition teaching. He must have appreciation of the 
objectives of the curriculum and of the principles in- 
volved in the selection of subject matter. He cannot 
ignore the expected results to the pupil of the work for 
which the teacher is held responsible.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
The teacher possessing skilled technique knows the 
value of proper assignment of work, realizing that 
teaching is mainly directing intelligently the learning 
process. He values the recitation as a means to an end 
and not as an end in itself. He understands, if he has 
mastered his technique, the final aims of the school and 
utilizes intelligently his opportunities for securing the 
forming of proper habits and the development of 
proper emotional attitudes. He understands the sig- 
nificance of educational measurement and the possi- 
bilities of intelligence tests as supplementing his knowl- 
edge of the pupils derived in the more traditional ways. 
In short the technique of teaching requires intelli- 
gent familiarity with much of our more recent educa- 
tional investigations. Obviously an elementary treatise 
on the teacher’s technique can not hope to cover so 
complete a program. This volume attempts in a simple 
fashion to put the student on the right track and to 
give him some familiarity with many of the funda- 
mental ideas that underlie intelligent teaching. It 
should be a valuable book for the untrained teacher to 
use in his effort to make more systematic his knowl- 
edge of the teaching problem. It should also meet the 
needs of normal schools and colleges for an elementary 
text on the fundamental principles underlying tech- 
nique and class management.

TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
WHEN the Germans invaded Belgium in 1914, they 
disturbed the world’s social and economic equilibrium 
in many ways. The masses were swept by waves of 
discontent at their lot and readjustments of all sorts 
took place. Although the United States did not enter 
the World War until more than two and a half years 
after it began, the unusual demands for certain lines 
of products and commodities early resulted in rising 
prices. When we declared war the movements that 
had already started were accentuated, until we reached 
the forty-five-cent dollar with its accompanying hard- 
ships. 
There is no class of people who were more affected 
by the depreciation of the dollar than the teaching 
profession. With but few exceptions, teachers are 
employed on yearly contracts. Further, the funds 
from which they are paid are usually raised from taxes 
3
-P-A-G-E-12
  4. THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
levied months before the salary contracts with the 
teachers are made. This situation has resulted in an 
inertia in teachers’ salaries which was not equaled any- 
where else unless it was in the United States Postal 
Service and allied branches of the Civil Service. When 
teachers found that, in spite of years of training, they 
could not make a living in their chosen work, many of 
them gave up this work of service and went into in- 
dustrial employment. ‘There was a general exodus 
from the teaching profession, which resulted in the loss 
of many of the best young teachers to the work. In 
addition to causing many teachers to give up the work, 
low salaries reduced the addition of new blood to the 
service to such an extent that there is an unusual 
shortage of workers at present. This dearth is so great 
that, although every device has been employed to fill 
the vacancies in our schools, many schools have been 
closed because no one could be found to do the work. 
This is the condition at a time when salaries are nearly 
on a par with the cost of living. Since the average 
teacher usually puts in only a few years of service 
before marrying or taking up some more gainful or 
congenial occupation, it can be seen that our schools 
are in a crisis. 
In spite of the obstacles that have been put in the 
way of progress toward a well trained teaching per- 
sonnel in this country by the reverses of the past five 
years, the leaders have not lost faith. The teaching 
art still is recognized by many people as one that de-
-P-A-G-E-13
    INTRODUCTION 5 
mands training and complete consecration to its ideals. 
Those who give their lives to it are carrying on a very 
important and exacting life-work. This point of view 
has cultivated a sensitiveness to the various details of 
the art that will result in a much higher quality of 
work as a complete conception of its requirements 
becomes recognized by the rank and file. At present, 
however, the rank and file of the teaching profession 
is far behind its leaders. Of course, this condition is 
always true of any evolutionary movement. 
The last decade has been one of unusual progress 
along scientific lines. A vast number of new concepts 
has been evolved and justified in the educational 
world. Time is required for the assimilation of these 
new ideas by the masses of the people, although the 
teaching class, because of its superior training and 
general ability, can probably acquire them very rap- 
idly. Consequently every effort must be made to 
stimulate the dissemination of the new ideas that are 
continually evolving from our efforts. 
The evolutionary conception of the teaching art 
may be made clear by a few general illustrations from 
educational history. Until about one hundred years 
ago all teaching consisted of the guidance of individual 
memorizing. The master set each pupil a lesson and 
then left him to get it as best he could. When the 
pupil had committed the lesson to memory, he went 
to the teacher to recite. To recite consisted of nothing 
more than to repeat the lesson word for word—rote
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
memory. No questions or explanations were asked or 
given. One after another, the pupils went through 
this procedure, and the teacher had no other duties 
than to set tasks and listen to the pupils repeat them 
from memory, unless one might consider the applica- 
tion of the birch a duty. This switch came into use 
whenever a boy failed to appear at the expected time 
or appeared with his lesson incompletely memorized. 
It supplied about the only motive for study that was 
found in the schools of those days. 
In arithmetic the work was extremely formal. 
Ciphering books were used, and an individualistic 
treatment was the rule. When a boy was old enough to 
learn ciphering, his parents provided him with a blank- 
book, made by sewing together a bundle of blank 
papers. Carrying this book, the boy went to the 
teacher and made known his desire to learn the mys- 
teries of arithmetic. The teacher then hunted up his 
own book, one he had made years earlier as a pupil 
when he had learned to cipher, and set the boy a sum, 
telling him the rule by which to work it. Plunged 
thus into the midst of the difficulties of addition, the 
pupil worked out his own salvation. If, after working 
industriously for a time, the pupil succeeded in se- 
curing what seemed to himself to be the desired result, 
he went to the master with the work that he had 
performed on a bit of scrap paper or a slate. The 
master approved or disapproved the work on the basis 
of its agreement or disagreement with the work in ‘his

  INTRODUCTION i 
own ciphering book. If the pupil’s work was identical 
with the master’s, it was given the stamp of approval 
and was ordered copied into the ciphering book along 
with the rule by which it had been worked. If there 
proved to be the slightest difference between the pupil’s 
and the master’s work, the pupil was told to do it all 
over again, even though the essential parts were 
correct. 
It is thought that this method of teaching arith- 
metic originated when there were no text-books. It 
continued long after there were text-books in other 
subjects, however. When text-books finally were in- 
troduced in arithmetic, the method of teaching con- 
tinued to be much the same. This is shown by the 
universal practice of providing keys for the teacher’s 
use. Further, many of our parents and most of our 
grandparents, especially those who were educated in 
the country schools, can testify to instruction of a 
similar nature. 
Another illustration of the mingling of conservatism 
with progress is shown in the evolution of class- 
teaching. Up to the time of the monitorial movement, 
teaching was an individualistic procedure. Pupils were 
not graded or classified, but each was in a class by him- 
self and each progressed as rapidly as his capacity and 
industry permitted. The introduction of -the moni- 
torial system revolutionized all this. Pupils were clas- 
sified and moved as groups. When first introduced, 
however, the monitorial system did not plan to use
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
any radically new teaching methods. A few devices 
were introduced, especially blackboards, maps, and 
charts; but, in the main, it was intended that the 
monitors should teach the pupils individually, just as 
they had been taught by the master. When new 
methods, designed for group teaching, were introduced, 
monitors had to give way to trained teachers. _ 
Many of the individualistic and monitorial methods 
persisted long after the group method of teaching had 
come into vogue. It has been only in recent years that 
some of the practices, such as calling on pupils in a 
fixed order, demanding an exact reproduction of words 
where a memory of ideas would be more serviceable, 
and the like, have given way to others better suited. 
It has been said that one may find teachers conduct- 
ing class-work now in some of our schools in the same 
way in which it was conducted generally seventy-five 
years ago; in other words, some people are still fol- 
lowing the general practices of three or four genera- 
tions ago in their teaching. How can this be? The 
answer is simple. Many of our teachers are untrained 
in the best methods. All that they know about teach- 
ing has been copied from the ways in which they were 
taught, or has been picked up from fellow teachers and 
from relatives who taught school once upon a time. 
Under such conditions it is no wonder that progress in 
the evolution of teaching methods is slow and halting. 
The only solution for this problem is a universal 
requirement that people secure a minimum of real
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION 9 
training before they are permitted to take up teaching. 
The introduction of group-teaching, which came 
with the monitorial system, brought many changes in 
teaching methods. To be sure, the many new subjects 
and new materials of instruction that have been given 
a place in the curriculum must receive credit for nu- 
merous innovations. But the greatest factor in the 
situation has been the possibilities offered by group- 
teaching. Group-teaching emphasized the careful 
grading of pupils. The grading of pupils and the 
grading of subject-matter tended to go hand in hand. 
Then a new theory and mode of discipline was evolved, 
and a new purpose in questioning and in the conduct 
of the recitation was recognized. All of these things 
finally resulted in directing attention to the teaching 
process itself, and differentiation resulted here. It was 
found that different methods were to be desired in drill 
exercises, where things were memorized and habits 
were formed, from those used in imparting knowledge 
and in developing the emotional sides of the pupils’ 
lives. More recently it has been recognized that mere 
class uniformity is not to be desired, but that under- 
neath the uniformity the individuality of each member 
must be developed. It is not sufficient to impart 
knowledge and to train emotions. Things must be 
connected with life. Training for an active partici- 
pation in the life of an organized society is the real 
mission of the public school. 
Recently this new conception of the mission of the
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
public school has led to recognition of the fact that 
there is a social aspect of the teaching process. Teach- 
ers have found that ideas seemingly are living things, 
which behave in ways of their own. Ideas that the 
teacher imparts to a pupil or a class become the prop- 
erty of the school or community, impregnating the 
entire social fabric. Likewise community biases come 
into the school, although the teachers do their utmost 
to keep them out. Ideas, sentiments, and prejudices 
that may have keen dropped casually in moments of 
inspiration in the class-room act like a bit of yeast 
which leavens the whole mass. These phenomena have 
led progressive teachers to reflect and to wonder if such 
results were not the outcome of the operation of defi- 
nite social forces, which might be controlled if under- 
stood. 
The sociologists have made much of this phase of — 
social life. Perhaps, with their aid, it may be possible 
to work out a satisfactory analysis of the social aspects 
of the teaching process. A recognition of the social 
aspects of discipline has been presented to the educa- 
tional world already. The importance of the social ele- 
ments in moral education is also recognized. But 
many important phases of the teaching process in- 
volved in class-room exercises have been considered 
but little in their social aspects. This will be one of 
the fruitful fields of analysis in the future. 
The following chapters will consider the technique 
of teaching in its evolutionary aspects. The various 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  
INTRODUCTION 11 
factors that condition the teaching process will be pre- 
sented, and much that has proved itself of value 
through actual trial in the class-room will be given. 
There remain many unsolved problems, however; for 
the end of the evolutionary movement has not been 
reached.
-P-A-G-E-20
CHAPTER II 
THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 
THE FACTORS 
THE results of a teacher’s efforts in the class-room 
depend upon the operation of many factors. If a 
person knows these factors, he can, when trained, pre- 
dict in general the kind of work that a teacher will do. 
These factors fall roughly into two main classes: first, 
those that are constant from day to day and are estab- 
lished once and for all in the first few days of the 
school year or the first few days of a period of read- 
justment; and second, those that are continually vary- 
ing with the spirit of the moment. The first group 
may well be called objective conditions, and the second 
group subjective conditions. It must be remembered, 
however, that such a classification is not hard and fast, 
and that many things will be met that do not seem to 
fall in either group, but that partake of some of the 
characteristics of each. 
Some of these factors are outside the control of the 
individual teacher. Where a teacher is a member of a 
school system or of the teaching corps of a graded 
building, some things are not in her dominion. She 
12  
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 13 
can not prescribe the system of grading and promotion 
used. She has nothing to say about the architecture 
of her class-room, which probably was built years ear- 
lier. When it comes to remodeling the heating system, 
she is seldom consulted. But there are many spheres 
outside her immediate province, such as pupil move- 
ments in large buildings or playground routine, where 
tactful suggestions are received gladly by superin- 
tendents and principals. 
OBJECTIVE CONDITIONS 
As has been stated in the preceding section, objective 
conditions are those factors conditioning the teaching 
process which are relatively constant from day to day. 
They are adjusted at the beginning of a term, and few 
changes are made until the term has been completed 
or an emergency appears. The more typical ones are 
so constant that they should be met by habitual re- 
actions on the part of the children. Doing them day 
after day ought to result in the formation of habits. 
They are very important, for, if they are not properly 
met, much time is wasted. In these days of efficiency 
and economy every teacher must be somewhat of an 
efficiency expert if her work is to be done satisfactorily, 
and these conditions must be given thought and atten- 
tion. Many precious moments are wasted by teachers 
who have not learned to arrange the objective condi- 
tions in a manner that will be most helpful. |
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
I. PHysicau CoNnpDITIONS. — 
The physical side of the class-room presents a defi- 
nite group of objective conditions of teaching, though 
they require a more variable treatment than some of 
the other groups. ) 
A. Heating. 
Teachers seldom have very much control over the 
heating system of anything except the one-room rural 
school. There are some things that the teacher may 
do to economize time, however, even in the large 
building. She should familiarize herself with the prac- 
tical workings of the dampers, so that when cold 
weather arrives no time will be lost in learning how to 
manipulate them. Where automatic regulators are not 
provided, an understanding of the heating system will 
help in preventing the waste of fuel that is so notorious 
in our public schools. When cold weather arrives and 
it becomes necessary to look after the heating of the 
room systematically, pupil-monitors may be taught to 
do the work as effectively as the teacher herself, and 
this assistance will save her much trouble. 
The humidity of many school-rooms is lower than 
that of the Sahara Desert. Unless there is an adequate 
provision for adding moisture to the air when it is 
heated, little can be done to remedy this condition, 
however. | 7 |
-P-A-G-E-23
THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 15 
B. Ventilation. 
The ventilation of the room is as important as the 
heating, for foul air is just as detrimental to effective 
work as are cold hands and feet. Where an automatic 
ventilating system that works is in operation, there is 
little for the teacher to do but to leave it alone. In 
many schools the ventilation is inadequate and the 
windows must be used to supplement it. Some of the 
patented systems are supposed not to work effectively 
when windows are open. In case the provisions for 
providing fresh air are of this type, they must be given 
- a fair trial before they are condemned. If they prove 
unsatisfactory when tried out, then it is best to supple- 
ment with window ventilation. fresh air is badly 
needed when a room presents a marked odor to one 
coming in from out of doors or when those within 
notice the stuffiness. People in the room are not so 
liable to notice the need as new-comers, because their 
senses have become dulled. The teacher should learn 
to detect the need for a change of air, which is shown by 
dull, drowsy, and restless pupils. To provide window 
ventilation, it is better to have the fresh air enter at 
the top than at the bottom of the windows. If it 
enters at the top, it will become warmed before reach- 
ing the level of the pupils. If it comes in at the bot- 
tom, it will reach the floor so cold as to chill the feet 
without disturbing the hot, stifling air at the level of
-P-A-G-E-24
16 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
the pupils’ heads. When the pupils leave the room at 
intermissions, it is well to open the windows wide to 
allow a few minutes of thorough ventilation. 
C. Lighting. 
The illumination of the class-room should be suffi- 
cient to prevent eye-strain in the most poorly lighted 
parts. The teacher may test the illumination of these 
by noticing if she experiences any discomfort while 
reading the ordinary text-books in them. If there are 
parts of the room insufficiently lighted, they should not 
be used until the fault is remedied. The best illumi- 
nation is secured from skylights, and it is unfortunate 
that so few schools make use of this form of lighting. 
The next best is a series of windows on one side of the 
room, but this form sometimes leaves the farther por- 
tions of the room with too little light when the curtains 
are partly drawn. Windows on two sides of the room 
are bad for ordinary study and reading work, because 
of the cross shadows that appear on the pages of the 
pupils’ books. Shadows on the page that a pupil is 
reading make his eyes do several times as much work 
as they should, wasting his nervous energy and laying 
the foundation for eye trouble. The pupil should be 
seated so that he can have the light from the rear left 
for his work. Further, he should never be called upon 
to read work on a blackboard that reflects a glare or 
that is between two windows admitting light. This 
last point makes it necessary that the teacher select
-P-A-G-E-25
ora,   
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 17 
blackboards that are correctly placed. A proper ma- 
nipulation of the window-shades will aid in securing 
the best conditions possible under the circumstances. 
The teacher who never adjusts them is neglecting some 
of the first principles of school hygiene. 
II. Cuxass-Room MANAGEMENT. 
A. Routine Factors. 
Some of the most important objective conditions fall 
in this class. Routine factors are nearly all within the 
control of the class-room teacher, and are very impor- 
tant. Teaching success or failure is determined often 
by the way these are handled. 
1. Seating of pupils——Pupils should have definitely 
assigned seats. This is a fundamental principle of 
class-room economy. Assigned seats enable the teacher 
to become acquainted with the pupils in a very short 
time. They also make it possible to check the attend- 
ance quickly. Pupils know where they sit and there is 
no confusion when they enter because of the-uncer-~ 
tainty of their _places—no scrambling for the choice 
seats.. In assigning seats a mere chance allotment 
often breaks up cliques and helps to solve problems of 
discipline. Pupils never should get the idea that they 
have a vested right to cherished seats. The seating 
arrangement at any time is only a temporary expe- 
dient, which may be rearranged whenever it seems 
desirable. This is the teacher’s privilege. As an aid 
to discipline, it is well to put bright, active pupils in 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-26
18 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
the front of the room where there is less temptation to 
mischief. Assigned seats are an aid in returning class 
papers, note-books, and other property that the teacher 
has collected for inspection. 
2. Pupil movements.—Pupil movements should be 
so organized that there is no confusion or loss of time. 
Unorganized pupil movements lead to congestion and 
encourage loitering and disorder. Most schools have 
planned a good system of pupil movements for dis- 
missal and fire drills, while they have neglected class 
movements where changes are made from room to room 
between class periods. These changes often are made 
with a maximum of confusion and disorder. A less 
important waste due to lack of system is to be found in 
unorganized passing to the blackboard or to the dif- 
ferent seats in the laboratory. Where pupil movements 
are controlled by a system of bells, if there is no master 
clock to ring them on time, a pupil-monitor may be 
intrusted with the operation of the push-buttons, thus 
relieving the teacher or principal of a troublesome 
duty. 
3. Handling materials.—Teachers, as a whole, waste 
more time in using inefficient methods of handling 
materials than in any other single activity. In the 
grades a system of monitors often solves the problem; 
but in the high school monitors are used but seldom. 
Pupils bring class themes or note-books to the teacher’s 
desk one by one. Teachers pass out papers one at a 
time, using several minutes to distribute a set of 
   
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 19 
papers that could be placed in the hands of the pupils 
in a few seconds. A good way to solve this problem, 
where monitors are not used, is to adopt a system that 
will put the papers in a specified order and then use 
that plan each time. If the papers or note-books are 
kept in the same order by the teacher, they may be 
returned as quickly as they are collected. An illustra- 
tion of the way some teachers provide for this is shown 
by the following instructions, which can be given to a 
class of pupils arranged in rows from the front to the 
back of the room. “Please pass the papers to the front. 
Each pupil will put his paper on top of the bundle. 
Those in the front seats pass the bundles to the left, 
putting each new bundle on top.” 
Teachers often solve the problem of collecting and 
distributing regular papers and note-books, while they 
neglect to routinize the distribution of new materials. 
New materials should be distributed on the pupils’ 
seats before class is called. This distribution may be 
performed by some of the pupils, who often enjoy doing 
it. When materials or apparatus are needed for general 
demonstrations, such as in science classes, they should 
be on hand before class, and should have been tested 
out so as to make certain that they will work when 
needed. Bungling experiments and nervous actions in 
demonstrations are usually the result of lack of prepa- 
ration with materials and apparatus. Some teachers 
manage materials and apparatus satisfactorily while 
handling and using them, but have no system in their
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
closets and store-rooms. Their desks present a con- 
stant display of confusion. Each piece of apparatus, 
package of supplies, or book should have its definitely 
assigned place, and pupils and teacher should co- 
operate in keeping it there. 
Another source of waste is in the making of special 
assignments to individual pupils. It is often economy 
to write these out on slips of paper, in order that they 
may be handed to the pupils without loss of time. This 
plan insures accuracy by eliminating the errors of copy- 
ing that pupils sometimes make. A similar waste 
occurs when pupils copy a mass of reading material, 
outlines, notes, or directions from the blackboard, or 
write them from dictation. These materials should be 
mimeographed, if possible, and copies given to the 
pupils. |

A. Good Discipline a Necessity. 
In order that pupils and teacher may cooperate in 
the best way in the educative process, it is necessary 
that first things be put first. This means that the 
educative business of the school must be in the fore- 
ground; that every one be busy about his work without 
interfering with the work of others. / When all co- 
operate to prevent interference with the rights of others 
and all keep busy, good discipline may be said to be~ 
present. Good teaching is made possible by good dis- 
cipline, and, in turn, makes for good discipline. It has
-P-A-G-E-29
    
THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 21 
been said that discipline is best when it is least in evi- 
dence. Ability to secure good discipline has been 
shown to be one of the factors most important in the 
qualities making up a good teacher. Further, its lack 
has been found to be one of the most important reasons 
for teaching failures. A teacher must have conditions 
of order for her work. If these conditions can not be 
secured through ingenuity and insight, they must be 
secured through fear and force, however much the lat- 
ter method may be condemned. 
Lb. Changing Character of Discipline. 
The introduction of the doctrine of interest has 
brought marked changes in the measures for securing 
discipline. Before the era of motivation and interest 
teachers controlled the school mainly by means of fear. 
The attitude of the teacher in those days was one of 
domination. Under present conditions a teacher tries 
to lead the school in paths of industry. -Occasionally it 
may be necessary to resort to stern measures, but if 
such are needed continually it is an indication that 
something is seriously wrong. At the beginning of the 
school year, when a teacher takes charge of a new 
group of pupils, discipline is secured mainly by the 
awe and respect inherent in the teacher’s position. As 
the year progresses, however, order should result from 
a bond of sympathy and codperation that has been 
cultivated by the teacher. Pupils should cooperate in 
maintaining order because it is only right that every
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
one have a chance to learn as much as possible and to 
carry on his work without interference from others. 
C. Social Aspects. 
Good discipline is a result of the right group attitude 
on the part of the pupils toward school life. It is a 
reflection of school and community ideas and ideals. 
Communities that are law-abiding and show an interest 
in cooperating with teachers furnish schools with the 
minimum of disciplinary problems, while the opposite 
also is true. Homes that criticize the teachers un- 
reasoningly are homes that send to school children 
who are trouble-makers./ A good school organization 
may do much to build up the right group attitude 
toward order. \ Even in the same type of communi- 
ties, schools vary much in the results secured in 
discipline. These differences are mainly measures of 
the strength of the social pressure in the direction of 
right conduct that has been developed among the 
pupils by the teaching corps. Model pupils have been 
transferred from schools where the right attitude pre- 
vailed to those where it was missing, and promptly 
degenerated into trouble-makers. On the other hand, 
trouble-makers have come from the latter type of 
school and gone to the former, with the opposite result. 
When they found that mischief was not approved by 
their new companions, they tried other methods for 
gaining group approval. Group approval and dis- 
approval are powerful factors in maintaining law and 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 23 
order, and teachers should make use of them. When 
pupils have become. accustomed to good order, they 
prefer it to the other kind. 
It might not be amiss to mention the fact that the 
cultivation of the social spirit of law and order among 
the pupils of a school is an important step in the 
direction of moral development- Much of the dis- 
order and disregard for law among adults is due to the 
fact that often they have never been taught the value 
and importance of law-abiding conduct. Many of 
them left school before they were old enough to com- 
prehend social attitudes. (Children must, as a rule, be 
twelve years of age or older to be able to respond 
readily to the approval and disapproval of their fel- 
lows.) Others went to schools that cultivated the idea 
that law and order were something for the benefit of 
the other fellow, and that it was to one’s credit if he 
evaded rules and regulations. 
D. Measures for Securing Good Discipline. 
~. Proper routine.—If a teacher provides the proper 
routine, many disciplinary problems will be avoided. 
Where the proper mode of procedure has been outlined, 
there is little temptation to indulge in anything out of 
the way. But where each pupil may exercise his own 
initiative there is always a temptation for the bright, 
mischievous one to indulge in something out of the 
ordinary, knowing as he does that the situation pro- 
vides a ready excuse. In securing the proper routine
-P-A-G-E-32
  ' 24 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
it is well not to overdo the matter, however. Routine 
is frequently expressed in the form of rules. Rules 
should be as few as possible, and all should be based on 
the fundamental one that only such things should be 
done as promote the welfare of the school and the class 
as wholes. 
z. Correct attitude on the part of the teacher.-To 
be successful in discipline a teacher must take the 
correct attitude toward the school situation. The fun- 
damental thing is that the teacher must always look 
at problems from the objective point of view.’ This 
means that an offense must never be taken as a per- 
sonal insult. Every time a’breach of good behavior is 
committed, even if performed with the expressed pur- 
pose of insulting the teacher, it is much more effective 
if the penalty is administered from the point of view 
that the misconduct has interfered with the rights of 
the group as a school. It is hard to adopt such an 
attitude, but it pays. A teacher should never punish 
in the spirit of revenge, because it violates this funda- 
mental principle. 
Those virtues that make up the ideal character in 
life are very valuable to the teacher. Among the more 
important are justice, consistency, sympathy, patience, 
persistence, and tact. Pupils expect fair, impartial 
treatment. Teachers can give it only if they live these 
virtues. In addition, a teacher must have the ability 
to make decisions at the moment when the need arises. 
3. Constructive measures.—In addition to providing 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 25 . 
the proper routine and adopting the correct attitudes, 
the teacher must apply constructive measures to secure 
good discipline. 
a. Make work the master: One of the most impor- 
tant constructive measures that a teacher can use is to 
arrange the work in such a way that the pupils have no 
excuse for_not being busy... One of the easiest plans 
for doing this is to provide so much work, and to 
require its completion, that the pupils can not waste 
time if they get it done. Another way, which is a 
little more difficult to manage but which is more edu- 
cative, is to raise the qualitative standard of the work. 
Not more work, but bettér work, is the aim. Some- 
times both can be used to advantage. It has been 
recognized by teachers for many years that if pupils 
are kept busy with interesting, educative tasks, there 
will be few disciplinary problems. 
 b. Individual assignments: Many of the problems 
of discipline arise from the misconduct of bright pupils 
who have completed the regular work. Not having 
anything to do, they find something. A teacher may 
use individual assignments to provide these pupils with 
work, to prevent the waste arising from misdirected 
energy. Where the teacher can not emphasize these 
individual assignments because of lack of time or 
equipment, these pupils may be provided for by 
placing a shelf of suitable books at their disposal. 
When they have completed their allotted tasks, they 
can go to these books for something to do. Teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
26 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
sometimes are afraid to offer pupils these reading 
privileges, for fear they will neglect the regular assign- 
ments. This problem can be solved by a little patient 
supervision, emphasizing the fact that lessons come 
first. It isa marked gain for the average pupil to learn 
to decide when he really has his lesson. The schools of 
the past never really taught pupils to check up on 
themselves and stop studying a lesson when they had 
it mastered. Even if such pupils do neglect the regu- 
lar lessons at times, they are usually bright enough to 
make up the deficiency at some later period when they | 
discover it. 
Stimulation of group responsibility: In the dis- 
cussion of the social aspects of discipline, the point 
was made that right conduct, with the older pupils, 
should be a result of group attitudes of approval and 
disapproval instead of being a primitive fear reaction. 
How may this social sanction of right conduct be 
developed? ‘The solution is primarily through the 
stimulation of group responsibility. Ihis may be done 
by directing the attention of the group to the necessity 
for codperation among all if each one is to get the best. 
The teacher is there to help them, and they must co- 
operate if they are to receive the teaching that is their 
due. Direct, tactful talks about some of the school- 
room problems will evoke sympathetic responses. 
When group offenses are committed, they may give 
excellent opportunities for the consideration of the 
     
-P-A-G-E-35
  
THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 27 
problems of school-room ethics. These talks and de- 
liberations are real character-builders. 
Another plan that is helpful is what is known as 
pupil codperative government. The undue stimulation 
of group responsibility that comes from what has 
usually been known as pupil self-government may lead 
pupils to think they “run the school.” Such an atti- 
tude is undesirable. In pupil codperative government 
pupils and teachers cooperate in securing right conduct. 
It is recognized at the start that some things are han- 
dled more easily by pupils than by the teachers, and 
vice versa. There is no suggestion that the pupils are 
independent, and no implication that the teacher is 
intruding when she interests herself in student activi- 
ties. As far as the pupils can handle the situation 
more easily than the teachers, they are permitted to 
do it. Whenever the pupil machinery proves inade- 
quate, the teachers fill the breach. 
d. Treatment of individual offenses: There is one 
principle that may be laid down, which is fundamental 
to the punishment of individual offenses. It is that a 
teacher should never punish the group for offenses 
committed by one or two members of it. There are so 
few situations where this does not hold that it is well 
for a teacher to apply this principle rigidly. The ap- 
parent exception, where an individual commits an 
offense in which he is backed up by the group, is in 
reality a group offense, the offense being the sanction-
-P-A-G-E-36
  28 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
ing of wrong conduct—when, of course, the group may 
be punished. 
Breaches of conduct have been classified into three 
groups: (1) those arising from ignorance; (2) those 
arising from thoughtlessness or carelessness; and (3) 
those in which the action is contrary to knowledge, the 
doer not foreseeing, or not caring for, the consequences. 
This classification is helpful in prescribing the treat- 
ment needed by offenders. The first group frequently 
needs nothing more than information to prevent the 
repetition of the misdeeds. The second class also is to 
be handled largely by a thorough discussion among 
those involved of the rights violated; only here it is 
necessary to emphasize the necessity of right conduct, 
sometimes to the extent of administering light penal- 
ties. The third group presents the real problem. All 
serious offenses come under this class. Pupils commit- 
ting such misdemeanors are biased morally and need 
special treatment. 
A plan that has been used in large schools where all 
serious cases of discipline were sent to the principal is 
as follows: When an offender arrived, he was given a 
sheet of paper and asked to write his version of the 
misdeed. This was examined by teacher, principal, 
and pupil together, and discrepancies were corrected. 
Usually no severe penalty was inflicted the first time. 
When a pupil came for later offenses, he went through 
much the same procedure; only, real penalties were 
added. Each written account was filed in the office,
-P-A-G-E-37
  
THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 29 
and if a pupil was a persistent offender, when he had 
committed several offenses he was asked to copy his 
previous narratives. It is said that this plan has been 
very effective in reducing persistent petty offenses. 
In practice it has been found undesirable to punish 
pupils on the spur of the moment. A good plan is the 
following: When an offense is recognized by the 
teacher, she can immediately inform the pupil that she 
wishes him to stop a moment to talk the matter over 
after the others are dismissed. This gives the pupil a 
chance to think over the situation during the remainder 
of the session, and this meditation often leads to good 
resolutions. After the others have gone, there is an 
opportunity for a discussion of the situation by the 
teacher and pupil. Passions probably have subsided, 
and any punishment that may be necessary may be 
administered when the teacher is not angry. 
IV. InpivinvAL DIFFERENCES. 
A. Recently Recognized Problem. 
Another important group of objective conditions. 
which is very influential in determining the results 
secured by a teacher, is that which arises from indi- 
vidual differences. Although teachers recognized for a 
long time that Johnny and Willie were very different, 
they thought little about it. They could always count 
on Johnny for a good lesson, even if he played a greater 
part of the time; but it was quite different with Willie. 
He worked all of the time but seemed to make little 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  | 
30 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
progress. It seemed almost as if he forget one thing as 
soon as he learned the next. Recently, however, edu- 
cators have been paying more attention to this prob- 
lem, and it has become one of the most significant for 
the teacher. 
B. Importance and Character. 
It has been found that, if one hundred pupils are 
chosen by chance from one of our schools, they will 
vary markedly in abilities. A few will be very bright 
and a few will be very stupid. The great bulk will be | 
average, while a number will be better than the average 
but poorer than the bright, and a similar number will 
be poorer than the average but better than the stupid. 
If similar lots of one hundred are chosen from other 
public schools, it will be found that there is about the 
same proportion of bright, average, and stupid in each 
hundred. Slight variations may be found in the pro- 
portions, but a careful checking up usually will show a 
marked uniformity. Thus, if one hundred pupils were 
to be ranked according to general intellectual ability, 
a rough classification probably would place them as 
follows: 
RG, oso Gaines 0s oc Bae pemeee 4 bis 5 per cent. 
SEN so St bleed gee w we heel a ee CaN 20 per cent. 
PONG. 5 5 ilies bec eces b hes gear 50 per cent. 
POE ss bio DacdbalalOes «cine ita 20 per cent. 
POUAR ICL «ic» 52s habeidic's ss a. coe Wateew Deals 5 per cent. 
In the average class of twenty pupils it is estimated 
that the best is from four to six times as capable as the
-P-A-G-E-39
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING ol 
poorest. If the extremes are present the difference 
will be much greater. The stupid pupils, however, 
seldom advance beyond the intermediate grades; hence 
the grammar or high-school teacher is, as a rule, not 
called upon to deal with them. 
In addition to these differences in general ability, the 
problem is complicated further by the fact that abilities 
are specialized in some cases. Mary does well in her 
history and English work, and is a failure in arith- 
metic, algebra, and geometry. Frank enjoys mathe- 
matics and history, but he hates themes. George does 
excellent work in everything except Latin, and barely 
completes the work in that as a result of much special 
attention and a little charity. If a careful survey be 
made of any particular ability, marked differences will 
show up even where pupils are about alike in general 
ability. 
As if this were not enough, the factor of interest 
adds its weight. It seems at times as if the specializa- 
tion of interest, and consequent motivation of effort, is 
more important than differences in native capacity. 
Frances is going to be a school-teacher, Edward plans 
to be a farmer, and Edgar will go to college. All of 
these life plans contribute to varying interests and 
different responses. When these are added to the 
differences in native capacity, of general and special 
sorts, the problem becomes extremely complex indeed. 
Some are born long and some are born short, and it is 
the teacher’s task to provide for each as seems best.
-P-A-G-E-40
5 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
C. Provisions for. 
It is a comparatively simple matter to provide for 
individual differences in large schools where there are 
many facilities. In small schools, however, the prob- 
lem is just as important, but teachers have more diffi- 
culty in providing for it. A few of the more important 
measures for meeting the situation will be given. 
1. Diversified curriculum.—The first plan generally 
adopted to provide for individual differences in our 
American schools was diversified curriculums, offered 
to meet different vocational interests. In the later 
years of the high school new series of courses were in- 
troduced, which aimed to prepare for business, farm- 
ing, or home-making. Pupils chose curriculums when 
they reached a certain stage in their educational 
careers, and the way was marked out for them. One 
set of courses led to college, another to business, and 
others to different goals. This plan, however, has 
proved of little service in any but the later years of the 
high school. It has been adapted to the junior high 
school in some communities, but it seems somewhat 
unwise to differentiate pupils so early in their careers. 
American children and parents like to have the entire 
field of employment open to them, and a too rigid 
curriculum plan might not be satisfactory. It might 
lead to social stratification. Curriculum differentiation 
is mainly an attempt to provide for acquired differences 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 33 
of interest, and does not provide for fundamental dif- 
ferences in native ability. 
2. Free election of courses.—Another plan used is 
what is known as the free election of courses. Pupils 
are given opportunities to select the courses that they 
wish. Restrictions of various sorts are placed around 
the selections, but the purpose of the plan is to provide 
for different interests. There is nothing in it to pro- 
vide for differences in native ability, except as these 
may be revealed by interest. Differences in interest 
tend to disappear after a subject has been taught long 
enough to pupils to develop a background of meaning. 
Therefore, the interests that are provided for usually 
by the free election of courses in high schools, except- 
ing as they may be results of special aptitudes, are 
merely transient whims. Special aptitudes ought to be 
detected and provided for, but mere whims ought to be 
recognized for what they are. 
3. Grading pupils according to ability.—A plan that 
aims to provide for differences in native ability, used 
in some schools, is based on the principle of grading 
pupils according to ability. It is applicable only in 
schools of some size, however. In the school where 
there are several sections of the same class, the sec- 
tions may be formed on the basis of ability as shown 
by previous class work supplemented by group intelli- 
gence tests. If there are one hundred pupils in the 
class, they may be ranked from the best to the poorest 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  34 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
on the basis of the records. Then the upper twenty- 
five will form one section; the next twenty-five the 
second; and so on to make four sections. The work 
then can be adjusted to the capacity of each section. 
In a junior high school where this plan was adopted it 
was found that the best section of a class of five sec- 
tions was able to do one and one half year’s work in the 
three subjects history, geography, and algebra, while 
the poorest section completed about three fourths of 
the year’s work. The best section did not seem to work 
so hard as the other, although it covered twice as much 
ground. . 
Another plan for providing a selection of pupils 
according to ability chooses the best ten per cent. and 
the poorest ten per cent. from the classes. The best 
ten per cent. form an honor section and cover more 
and different work. The poorest section is put in a 
special coach class in which it is given the minimum 
needed in the subject. 
Grading pupils into sections according to native 
capacity introduces a number of problems that are 
mainly administrative. The same curriculum is not 
well adapted to different mental abilities. Then, there 
is the readjustment necessary when classes finish 
courses at different times during the year. The great 
question arises, too, as to whether it is as good a plan 
to hurry pupils over the required work and allow them 
to graduate earlier as it is to give them a richer, broader 
curriculum. There seems to be a tendency at present 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 35 
to favor a middle ground, enriching some things and 
shortening the time for others. This is probably the 
best solution. 
4. Study coaches for slow pupils——A fourth plan 
for meeting the problem of differences in capacity is 
one that provides study coaches for the slow pupils. 
In some cases a regular teacher gives a part of her time 
to systematic coaching of those who need such help. 
In others a teacher has nothing but coaching duties. 
Often a little individual assistance will do much to 
help a pupil over a difficulty and bring about renewed 
progress. 
5. Supplementary work for bright pupils.—This 
plan is suitable for nearly every kind of school and 
class. It is usually more of a makeshift than some of 
the other plans, but it need not be if teachers give it 
thought. It lends itself to emergencies and enables 
teachers to provide work to keep bright pupils out of 
mischief, and thus prevents disorder while it educates. 
There are a number of ways in which teachers may use 
this plan. They may place on convenient shelves a 
number of supplementary text-books giving references 
to topics related to the day’s work, which may be con- 
sulted by the bright pupils in leisure moments. In 
some cases it may be worth while to excuse bright 
pupils from regular recitations in order that they may 
undertake special tasks for school or teacher. Any 
device that will provide extra work for the bright pupil 
will fulfil the requirement.
-P-A-G-E-44
;

36 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
6. Combination of plans.—It is probably true that 
no one plan can be used successfully by all teachers. 
But in a combination of several of these plans may be 
found the solution for many of the problems arising 
from differences in capacity. In meeting this problem 
teachers should take care, however, that bright, nervous 
pupils are not overworked, on the one hand, nor slow 
pupils discouraged by being made the objects of ridi- 
cule, on the other. Bright pupils sometimes seem to 
purchase their mental brilliance at the expense of 
endurance. Slow pupils may be extremely sensitive as 
well as slow. 
SUBJECTIVE CONDITIONS 
The second large class of factors that determines the 
results of teaching is what may be called subjective 
conditions. The greater number of the things that are 
responsible for good or bad teaching come in this class. 
Subjective conditions are constantly changing, and 
must always be provided for by the exercise of thought 
on the part of the teacher. The arrangement -and 
selection of subject-matter and its presentation in the 
-class-room exercises furnish probably the largest group 
_ of these factors. They include also the sudden emer- 
gencies that arise in dealing with pupils, parents, and 
patrons. 
The group is so large and so important that the 
various problems arising from it will furnish a basis for 
the following chapters. Many things are as yet in a
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE FACTORS THAT CONDITION TEACHING 37 
sort of trial and error stage. Where this is true, what 
seems to be the most promising solution will be given. 
Where nothing seems at all decided, the problem will 
not be considered. 
SUMMARY 
A teacher’s efforts are conditioned by many factors, 
objective and subjective. Some of these are outside 
the control of the individual teacher, but many are 
under her jurisdiction. Objective factors are relatively 
constant from day to day, and should be adjusted per- 
manently at the beginning of the teacher’s work. These 
' include the physical conditions of temperature, humid- 
ity, ventilation, and lighting; the factors of class-room 
management; discipline; and individual differences. 
Class-room management concerns itself with the rou- 
tine factors of seating, pupil movements, and handling 
of materials. 
Discipline is so important that it must be considered 
at length. Discipline changes in character as pupils 
become older, and takes on many social aspects in the 
high school. The measures for securing it are: (1) a 
proper routine; (2) the correct attitudes on the part of 
the teacher; (3) the establishment of a regimen of 
work; (4) systematic use of individual assignments; 
(5) the stimulation of group responsibility; and (6) 
the wise treatment of individual offenders. _ 
The problem created by individual differences is 
newly recognized, and very important. It may be met
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
bythe use of (1) diversified curriculums, (2) free elec- 
tion of courses, (3) the grading of pupils according to 
ability, (4) the use of study coaches for the slow 
pupils and supplementary work for the bright ones, 
and (5) by various combined plans. 
The subjective conditions are so various and detailed 
that many chapters must be devoted to them. They 
are those factors that demand an intelligent solution 
every time they appear and they can not, therefore, be 
reduced to rules.

CHAPTER III 
SUBJECT-MATTER 
NATURE OF 
TracHers often fail to recognize that each bit of 
real subject-matter is only a phase of human experi- 
ence. It is merely the way men think, feel, and act. 
For convenience in school-work, in most cases, people 
have written accounts of parts of life’s experience and 
have printed these in books. But this fact should not 
cause us to forget that the book is not subject-matter 
itself. It is merely a means for recording and dissemi- 
nating the essence of subject-matter. 
ORIGIN OF 
When schools were organized, those parts of man’s 
experience that seemed important enough for trans- 
mission to succeeding generations were collected and 
studied. Man’s need for methods of reckoning and 
computation gave rise to what became known as arith- 
metic. His need for communication with his fellows 
furnished language and written forms of thought trans- 
mission. As society became more complex, subject- 
matter changed accordingly. At times ingenious 
groups of teachers and scholars organized groups of 
41  
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
subject-matter far beyond the needs of their time. In- 
terested in the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, 
they formulated rules, laws, and principles that they 
thought were true. The subject-matter then was or- 
ganized around these, and when the task was finished, 
the average man hardly recognized the results as re- 
lated to his needs. Some types of minds enjoyed such 
thinking, and it sometimes happened that subjects 
thus organized were preserved and handed down in the 
schools for generations. They were changed but little 
after centuries had elapsed, except that possibly a 
better organization was devised. Although they 
started as a phase of man’s social needs, they became 
so modified later that they were of little value in pro- 
viding for these needs. The classic example of this is 
to be found in the persistence and character of present- 
day Latin and Greek. Examples are to be found also 
in most of the older subjects. 
As man’s needs increased and changed, new groups 
of subject-matter were introduced into the schools. 
At present we are experiencing a wave of enthusiasm 
for the introduction of Spanish. This is the expression 
of a feeling that we ought to be able to communicate a 
little more readily with our American neighbors. 
Home economics has come into our schools in response 
to another group of social needs. The same thing is 
true of the vocational studies, agriculture, phases of 
manual training, and business courses.

FUNCTIONS OF SUBJECT MATTER 
The functions or values of subject-matter may be 
classified in various ways. The most profitable classi- 
fication, probably, is on the basis of the different kinds 
of values that pupils may derive from its study. 
I. Intreinsic FUNCTION. 
The first important function of subject-matter is its 
practical value for life. A boy learns to read so that 
he may ascertain what people have recorded for others. 
He learns to write so that he may communicate his 
thoughts to distant friends. He learns to spell so that 
what he writes may be intelligible to those who receive 
his messages. Counting becomes of value in playing 
marbles and other games. When a girl writes an arti- 
cle for the school paper, she finds that the rhetoric she 
has studied helps her to criticize effectively what she 
has written. These are illustrations of the intrinsic 
function of subject-matter. They might be multiplied 
manifold, but these few will help to make clear what is 
meant by this value. 
II. Preparatory FUNCTION. 
Another important value that subject-matter has is 
the value it has for the future. Many things are 
taught that will not be of immediate service, but that, 
it is hoped, will be of use later. Children learn many
-P-A-G-E-52
44 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
facts of history, geography, physiology, and science 
because there is a chance that they may need them 
sometime. They may serve only in the study of other 
things, but such values are important. This function 
is so vital that a major part of the work of the high 
school is looked upon mainly as college preparatory 
material. For the pupil who goes to college it serves 
this purpose, but for the one who makes the high 
school the finishing school the same subject-matter 
may satisfy some other function. The use that is made 
of the subject-matter determines its function. 
III. Decorative FuNcrtrIoN. 
Many things that are taught and studied in school 
have no intrinsic or preparatory function, but are there 
because they are what educated people have studied. 
This value is appropriately named the decorative func- 
tion. Oftentimes, in discussions of the reasons for 
studying facts of history and selections of literature 
that are taught in our schools, teachers try to conjure 
up practical values, when it would be better to say that 
these are studied because they are marks of culture. 
They are the things that educated people know. 
Closely related to these things are those that are of 
value mainly because they furnish a profitable employ- 
ment for leisure time. Pupils study music, drawing, 
literature, and many other things because they are 
interesting and because they may help to pass the 
unoccupied moments of life. 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  SUBJECT-MATTER 45 
IV. DiscrpLtinary FUNCTION. 
The disciplinary function of subject-matter is one 
that is not emphasized so much now as it was in the 
past. There was a time when, if you asked any leading 
educator why Latin or mathematics was studied, he 
would reply that it trained the mind. Latin was sup- 
posed to be excellent for strengthening the memory, 
mathematics the reason, etc. Careful investigations of 
the results secured from studying such things have 
failed, in the main, to show any basis for such assump- 
tions. The disciplinary function of subject-matter, as 
it was conceived in the past, is a myth. It does not 
exist. As a result, no progressive teacher now gives to 
pupils subject-matter that has the disciplinary func- 
tion as its sole justification. Of course, the doctrine of 
formal discipline, as this function is called, is still very 
generally held by conservative teachers. In another 
generation, however, it will be one of the educational 
ideas held only by the backward minority. 
SELECTION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 
One of the big problems that confront the teacher 
with respect to subject-matter is its selection. If the 
teacher has the slightest initiative in the use of text- 
book or syllabus, she should choose the best from the 
many possible things she may introduce. How can she 
decide what is the best? There are a number of cri- 
teria that may aid in the selection of subject-matter.
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
I. Basts or MINIMAL ESSENTIALS. 
Minimal essentials are those things that are funda- 
mental to the purpose for which the subject is taught. 
As the term is used commonly, viewed from the basis 
of general social needs, minimal essentials are the 
things that every boy and girl should know in a sub- 
ject. The term is used also in a somewhat restricted 
sense where it implies the things that are fundamental 
to the social needs of a particular group of pupils. 
Even if used with both meanings, the term is helpful. 
It gives a real basis upon which to select the things 
that should be taught first in a particular situation. 
After the minimal essentials have been given, a teacher 
should present the things that enrich a subject; but 
not until then. 
It is difficult for the individual teacher to determine 
exhaustively the minimal essentials of a subject. She 
needs the aid of experts in this work. Prominent edu- 
cators have been hard at work on this problem, and 
have presented a few tentative conclusions. Teachers 
may make use of these results, and in this way lighten 
the work of such a selection. As time passes, more 
and more of the public-school curriculum will be sur- 
veyed and fundamentals will be determined. Teachers 
may select the more important things on the basis of 
their own experience and thus make a start in the 
right direction, but at the earliest opportunity they 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  SUBJECT-MATTER 47 
should make use of the careful expert studies that have 
been made. 
A few of the things that have been worked out by 
experts at present are as follows: In handwriting, 
studies have determined the amount of time that can 
be spent profitably in teaching writing, the speed per 
minute that pupils can attain readily, and the quality 
of work that can be expected. In language and gram- 
mar, experts have shown the kinds of errors people 
make, and the things they need to know to help them 
to correct these errors. In spelling, lists of words have 
been compiled containing all of the words commonly 
used in ordinary life. These are some of the things 
that have been partially decided at present. The 
future will settle many other questions. 
II. Basis or Socrtau NEEps. 
In reality, the preceding criterion of minimal essen- 
tials is only a phase of the selection of subject-matter 
on the basis of social needs. Social needs as a whole, 
however, are much more varied and comprehensive. 
When a teacher selects subject-matter on the basis of 
minimal essentials, general needs alone are considered 
—the needs of all the pupils. When a teacher selects 
on the basis of social needs, she must be on the watch 
for variations instead of for signs of uniformity. The 
school must meet life’s needs, and it can do this only 
by making itself as varied as life.
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
Social needs change with time. A few years ago a 
- boy was expected to know about horses, electric bells, 
trolley cars, and telephones. At present it 1s automo- 
bile engines, wireless telegraphy, aéronautics, and mili- 
tary training that are in the forefront of the world’s 
activities. In a few years countless unthought-of in- 
ventions will be monopolizing the interest of boys and 
girls. These are illustrations from recent years. There 
is no need to multiply them by delving into earlier 
history. The important thing is that social needs are 
changing, and the implication is that subject-matter 
should change with them. Under present conditions 
the fact that a thing was studied by our fathers is not 
an all-sufficient reason why we or our children should 
study it. The social need that brought it into the 
school may have disappeared long ago. 
Social needs vary between different communities. 
School A may be in an aristocratic American com- 
munity that has almost perfect command of the form 
and pronunciation of the English language. School B, 
on the other hand, may draw its pupils from a foreign 
settlement that is deficient in both. It would be foolish 
to place the same emphasis on the different points in 
the language work for both schools. Each community 
has its special social needs. In the rural community 
of Jones Center the boys and girls all expect to spend 
their lives in tilling the soil and ministering to simple 
wants. But in La Grande, a suburban section of the 
city of C, boys and girls nearly all enter business or 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
SUBJECT-MATTER 49 
professional life. It is the height of absurdity to give 
the same college preparatory group of studies to both 
sets of young people. Social needs demand a differen- 
tiation. 
A still further complication of the problem created 
by varying social needs is found in the individual 
variations between different members of the same 
community. Mary will teach school, if she realizes her 
present ambitions; John plans to be a banker; Harry 
wants to be a sanitary engineer; Lawrence must leave 
school at the age of sixteen to help out at home with 
his meager earnings; and Florence will keep house for 
her father when she graduates from high school. 
These are but a few of the many differences to be found 
in any community. Should they be met by giving all 
the same mental pabulum? No—not if the school is 
to perform its mission. 
III. Basis or RELATIVE VALUES. 
After the social needs of a particular school com- 
munity have been determined, the next task that con- 
fronts the teacher is the selection of the different items 
of subject-matter that will best meet them. This 
selection must be on the basis of relative values. 
Teachers sometimes make the mistake of selecting 
absolute values instead. Relative values are the values 
of the facts or items for this particular purpose, while 
absolute values consider the facts or items in all their 
possible aspects. Thus, the latter is in reality the sum 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  of) THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
total of all the relative values. To illustrate, a certain 
set of peculiar marks may be very valuable to the 
printer and proof-reader; another set may be equally 
important for the rhetoric teacher who must mark 
English themes; but neither has the absolute value of 
ordinary punctuation-marks, which are used generally. 
Each has a high relative and a low absolute value. 
When the printer says that every pupil ought to learn 
the marks he uses, because they are very valuable to 
him, he confuses relative with absolute values. 
ARRANGEMENT OF SUBJECT-MATTER FOR 
TEACHING 
The arrangement of subject-matter for teaching is 
one of the tasks that a teacher must attack if original 
work is attempted. It is not enough to select the 
materials. They must be arranged in some desirable 
order. The main defect of Experience as a teacher is 
that she does not arrange her subject-matter. 
I. RewatitvE IMPORTANCE. 
The first criterion for the arrangement of subject- 
matter is relative importance. ‘Those things that are 
most important must be chosen first. After these are 
determined, it is next in order to support them with 
such details as are essential. When this has been 
done, items of less importance may be considered until 
the time for the subject is exhausted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  SUBJECT-MATTER 51 
II. Perpacocicat INstTEAD oF LoaicAL ARRANGEMENT. 
One of the greatest faults of beginning teachers is 
that they often present subject-matter in the same 
order in which it was presented to them in college or 
normal school. What was very clear, when presented 
in detail to mature students who had a background of 
experience upon which to interpret it, often proves to 
be most uninteresting when presented to pupils in the 
public school for their first taste of this particular 
field of knowledge. These teachers take the logical 
arrangement of the college class, which, perhaps, was 
pedagogical for them in their maturity, and give it to 
their high-school pupils without alteration. The re- 
sult is easily foreseen. What should be provided is a 
pedagogical arrangement. This may be secured only 
by building on the knowledge possessed by the pupils. 
The only safe procedure is from the known to the 
unknown. Where the pupils know absolutely nothing 
about a subject, the only pedagogical way to begin is 
by presenting some phase that will appeal to the eye, 
ear, or other sense-organ. The traditional plan, which 
began with rules, definitions, and general principles, is 
farthest removed from this. 
A real pedagogical arrangement frequently is used in 
the first teaching of geography. The children are 
introduced to the subject in the form of home geog- 
raphy. They are shown the things they have seen
-P-A-G-E-60
52 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
many times, and are taught to see them from new 
aspects. Then they branch out to more remote regions, 
and finally come to the place where they can make 
their own definitions and other generalizations. In a 
similar way, some teachers start the science work of 
the high school by building upon what the children 
know. This is the general science movement. In a 
less pretentious manner, many teachers are doing the 
same thing in other subjects. Things are being con- 
nected with life continually, and every subject is full 
of meaning and significance. 
III. Arounp PivotTaut Pornts. 
From the preceding sections it must not be inferred 
that logical order has no place in the arrangement of 
subject-matter for teaching. Although it is necessary 
to build upon what pupils know, it is best that the 
material have a logical arrangement with that as a 
basis. This result may be secured by the use of pivotal 
points. By this is meant the selection of topics, which 
are simple enough for the purpose, around which the 
facts may be grouped. Most of the better text-books 
attempt to satisfy this requirement, and teachers will 
do well to rely on them until they are certain they can 
do better in some other way. 
PREPARATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER FOR 
TEACHING 
I. A thorough knowledge of the subject-matter, as 
such is usually understood in scholastic circles, is not 
     
-P-A-G-E-61
  SUBJECT-MATTER 53 
sufficient to enable a person to teach satisfactorily. 
The main reason for this is that this kind of mental 
grasp of the subject is mainly a mastery of the large 
fundamental principles. The details that made these 
principles meaningful when they were first mastered 
have been forgotten, for the most part. The same 
details, or similar ones, will be needed to make the 
principles meaningful to other individuals. When it 
is remembered that the pupils who are to be taught 
usually are much less mature than the teachers were 
when they studied the advanced work that gave them 
a thorough mastery of the field, another reason for 
further preparation becomes apparent. Teachers must 
do more than master the content of a subject to teach 
it effectively. A thorough scholastic preparation from 
the point of view of higher education is not enough, 
but this must be suplemented with a knowledge of 
many details that have been forgotten. 
II. There is an important difference between the 
kind of preparation needed by the teacher and that 
needed by the pupil. The pupil is prepared for the 
day’s work if he knows a limited section of the topic 
under consideration. But the teacher, on the contrary, 
can not be satisfied with a preparation of this sort. 
Not only must she be familiar with the details of a 
limited section, but she must see their connection with 
what has gone before and what is coming later. It is 
also helpful if the various relations with other subjects 
are gathered together for use as needed. Thus, a
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
teacher’s preparation must be broader and longer, fig- 
uratively speaking, than the pupil’s. 
III. As may be inferred readily from the two pre- 
ceding sections, a teacher needs to make constant 
preparation for her work. This preparation is of two 
kinds. At the beginning of the year it is necessary for 
the teacher to make a careful outline of the main points 
to be covered in the work, to make a far-ahead prepa- 
ration. This should result in a sort of skeleton of the 
course. Sometimes it will be but little more than a 
survey of the text-book and a calculation of the rate of 
progress and the topics to be considered, It is a good 
plan to prepare a calendar of the work for the year. 
On such a calendar the larger things can be included 
and omissions made for holidays and other interrup- 
tions. With a calendar to guide the work, the teacher 
will seldom complain, “There is so much to be done 
yet, and the year is almost gone!” Time and work 
tend more often to exhaust themselves together. 
The other type of preparation is the intensive work 
necessary to get ready for each day’s lessons. It is 
usually called the daily preparation. It need not be 
done every day without exception, however, because 
it is possible for the teacher to get ahead at times, and 
have an evening or two when other things may monop- 
olize attention; but such times are few and far between 
in the life of the busy, conscientious teacher. Each 
lesson demands a careful survey of its materials and 
an organization for the particular class to which it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
    SUBJECT-MATTER 55 
to be presented. It may be that this preparation will 
occupy only a few minutes each day, but it must be 
made if the work is to be done properly. When a 
teacher undertakes to teach a new text-book, one of the 
fundamentals of the preparation is a careful reading of 
the book; yet it often happens that teachers go to 
class for weeks, teaching a new book without knowing 
its exact contents. In such cases the work of the class- 
room is certain to suffer. There was a time when 
teachers did not make daily preparation, when it was 
thought that a teacher who studied each daily lesson 
did not know enough to teach. Happily, a time has 
been reached when it is only the untrained and ineffi- 
cient teachers who do not make a daily preparation. 
It is true that this preparation may require only a 
short time each day for some of the experienced teach- 
ers, but it must be made systematically. 
SUMMARY 
Subject-matter is human experience. It originated 
in man’s needs, but was modified in the schools at 
times for convenience or for pleasure. In some cases 
the modifications have produced artificial results. 
Subject-matter has four functions: the intrinsic, the 
preparatory, the decorative, and the disciplinary. The 
selection and arrangement of subject-matter should be 
mainly on the basis of minimal essentials, varying 
social neéds, and relative values. The arrangement for 
teaching should be pedagogical instead of logical, and
-P-A-G-E-64
56 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
things should be grouped around pivotal points as far 
as possible. 
A scholar’s knowledge of a subject is not a sufficient 
preparation for the teacher’s work. The teacher needs 
a@ more extensive and broader point of view in the 
subject than the pupil, so as to be able to put things 
into their proper perspectives. The teacher must make 
a thorough preparation both for the term and for the 
day.

OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 
WHEN a person sets out on a journey and knows 
exactly where he is going, he can provide himself with 
the necessary equipment. If the destination is not 
foreseen the provisions for the journey may be in- 
adequate. This analogy applies to the teacher. When 
a teacher begins the intellectual journey necessary to 
instruct a group of pupils, it is a great saving of energy 
if the changes that are to be made in their minds are 
foreseen. Knowing just where she is bound intellec- 
tually, the teacher can make adequate provisions for 
proper teaching equipment. The analogy holds still 
further. Some people travel with wardrobe-trunks, 
some with hand-bags, and some carry their belongings 
in a shawl-strap. ll arrive at their destinations, 
though in various stages of enthusiasm and fatigue. 
In like manner, some teachers use the best methods, 
while others use those less well adapted; but all pro- 
duce changes in the minds of their pupils, though with 
more or less mental friction. All travelers who can 
ride in parlor cars with adequate baggage facilities, and 
teachers who are able use those teaching methods that 
are best suited to the results desired. That a teacher 
59 
eS
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
may know what method to use, it is necessary for her 
to know whither she is bound. This necessitates a 
consideration of the outcomes, or results, of teaching. 
TYPES OF OUTCOMES 
The outcomes of teaching may be classified best by 
using a rough psychological grouping. It is always 
difficult to classify natural phenomena, because such 
do not lend themselves readily to hard-and-fast lines 
of demarcation. Consequently, the classification that 
is given may seem arbitrary and inadequate. Its use, 
however, will aid in determining the teaching methods 
best suited to secure the best teaching results. 
I. KNOWLEDGE OUTCOMES. 
A. Facts. 
One of the most frequently secured outcomes of 
teaching is what usually are called facts. These are 
items or bits of knowledge, such as, “Birds are ani- 
mals,’ “George Washington was our first President,” 
and similar simple ideas. Often they are isolated and 
unorganized. When they are arranged in a logical 
order, they tend to merge into the following types of 
outcomes: 
B. Concepts. 
‘The concept is nothing more than the mental result 
of a consideration of many related facts. Thus, the 
concept that is expressed in the definition of the idea,
-P-A-G-E-69
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 61 
verb, is formed by bringing together the common char- 
acteristics of words like run, throw, fall, build, and 
shout. Every noun, when it has a real meaning, is a 
concept; likewise, every adjective or modifying word 
may be so classified. Concepts are a very frequent 
result of the teacher’s wark, but although these con- 
crete outcomes are most familiar they seldom are recog- 
nized as implied by the term concept. This term, as 
ordinarily used, sounds forbidding to the average per- 
son, because he is looking for something abstract. 
Concepts are as concrete as general meanings. They 
are formed from details, but when they have been 
acquired the details may be forgotten. Every time the 
teacher makes anything meaningful she is forming a 
concept. 
C. Generalizations. 
When the concept is of a more or less abstract nature, 
it is designated usually by the more familiar terms 
generalization, rule, or law. Teachers have recognized 
these outcomes in the past as one of the important 
objectives of their teaching endeavors. At times, even, 
it seemed as if this were the main task of the teacher. 
At present, however, it is recognized that a rule or 
principle is not sufficient in itself, but that it must be 
backed up with rich meanings. Thus, it is not enough 
to give the rule, “Invert the divisor and multiply,” in 
teaching fractions; but the rule must be illustrated by 
a number of concrete examples. In another field, that  
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
of rhetoric, the teacher can not stop with a mere formal 
statement of the principles governing “unity” or 
“style,” but must give numerous ilustrations to make 
the points clear. 
D. Mental Attitudes and Methods of Thought. 
The most comprehensive knowledge outcomes that 
result from teaching are what may be called mental 
attitudes and methods of thought. People who are 
uneducated are inclined to accept things at their ap- 
parent face values. They form hasty conclusions and 
are misled by all sorts of shams. The attitude of mind 
that induces a person to weigh the evidence and search 
for possible inconsistencies before forming conclusions 
is acquired only through much practice along this line. 
Other attitudes, such as following things through to 
their logical results and always verifying before taking 
the next step, come through training. These outcomes 
are the consequence of a thorough organization of 
many facts, concepts, and principles. They are serv- 
iceable in the light of much such training, but it can 
not be assumed that the mere possession of informa- 
tion will guarantee the right mental attitude. Often 
the mental attitudes must be cultivated also. There- 
fore, teachers must seek these outcomes consciously. 
The need for outcomes of this general nature has 
impressed itself so strongly upon some of our educators 
that a most unusual departure from the traditional 
content of instruction has been attempted in the Army

men who have joined the army to learn a trade are, | 
as a rule, in need of general education as well as of 
vocational training. The time for instruction is very 
limited. As a result, their instructions in general edu- 
cation is restricted to one hour devoted to the basic 
course in citizenship and another hour in English 
instruction. The problems of citizenship have been 
analyzed in a manner that has produced remarkable 
results along social and economic lines. The inculca- 
tion of sane attitudes has been the key-note of the 
entire course in citizenship, and the traditional ma- 
terials of the school curriculum have been gone over 
for materials that bear upon these problems. The 
amount of material taught in our common schools that 
has been discarded under this plan is almost incon- 
ceivable.

A. Habits. 
The first type of the drill outcomes that will be 
considered is habit. Habits are actions that have been 
learned, but that go on automatically, once they have 
been learned, whenever the proper stimuli are pre- 
sented. When things are done from habit, no thought 
is necessary, and the individual is free to give his 
thought to other things. Many habits are formed in 
the school-room, such as holding the pencil in a certain 
way, raising the hand to attract the teacher’s attention,
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
sitting in a particular posture, and forming the letter a 
with a definite movement. Habits are so numerous 
that it has been said that children are bundles of them. 
Each is formed by repeating an action a number of 
times in precisely the same way each time. 
B. Rote Associations. 
The second type of drill outcomes is rote associations 
or rote memory. Rote associations are like habits in 
that they are formed in the same way—by repetition. 
They further resemble habits in that when they have 
been formed they no longer demand thinking. Rote 
memory is used in everything that demands an exact 
reproduction, as the number facts of the multiplication 
table, a memorized poem, and the learning of defini- 
tions and rules. In some cases a thorough under- 
standing of the thing may be an important aid in 
learning it by rote. This class of outcomes should 
always be sought when anything will be needed so 
often that time will be saved by memorizing it. It 
takes much more energy to think than to give things 
from memory. 
III. Emorionat OvutTCcoMES. 
Teaching in the past has been mainly a coldly intel- 
lectual process in so far as any definite teaching pro- 
gram was concerned. Teachers imparted knowledge 
and drilled, but never planned to influence the emo- 
tional side of the lives of their pupils. To be sure, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
    OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 65 
was hard for teachers to live and not influence the 
emotions of their pupils, but the emotional changes 
that resulted were purely accidental. It is not neces- 
sary to leave the training of the emotions so completely 
to chance. The emotions may be trained as surely as 
habits may be formed. The first step in the process of 
securing emotional outcomes is to recognize the various 
kinds that may be secured. 
A. Ideals, Sentiments, and Prejudices. 
One of the important tasks in the field of the emo- 
tional that confronts the teacher is the development 
of ideals. Such ideals as honesty, industry, thorough- 
ness, neatness, charity, and altruism must be incul- 
cated by the school, because our homes are too busy 
and too varied in character to do the task themselves. 
In some cases, even, the homes are entirely unfitted for 
this responsibility, because improper ideals are present. 
Similarly, the school must do its part by teaching the 
best sentiments and ‘prejudices. The right sort of 
patriotic attitude may be an ideal, but it is more often 
a sentiment. Prejudices are usually thought of as 
undesirable; yet they may be strong factors toward 
bringing about right conduct. We think of prejudices 
only when the other fellow has a point of view, to 
which he adheres strongly, which is contrary to ours. 
Yet we are prejudiced as much as he. Information 
about a line of action, backed up by a strong emotional 
coloring, constitutes a prejudice. Thus, one person
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  66 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
may believe that the Sabbath should be observed on 
the first day of the week, while another may worship 
on the seventh. Both have prejudices in this respect. 
Again, a person may think that a man ought always 
to give up his seat if a woman is standing. This is 
another prejudice, even though a valuable one under 
American standards. It is so customary to think of 
the prejudices of the other fellow that it is not recog- 
nized that there are both good and bad prejudices. 
The school should cultivate the good ones. Ideals, 
sentiments, and prejudices must be led into the right 
channels if we are to have the best social organiza- 
tion. 
B. Appreciation and Enjoyment. 
Another task from the emotional field for the teacher 
is the guidance of appreciation and the development of 
right standards of enjoyment. Children must be 
taught to appreciate literature, pictures, and artistic 
work; in fact, beauty wherever it is to be found. It 
is not enough merely to present objects for appreciation 
and enjoyment and expect the desired results to follow. 
The teacher must work to secure these emotional out- 
comes. Careful, systematic teaching does wonders in 
raising the standards of appreciation and enjoyment of 
a group of pupils. In the endeavors of the school to 
provide for the leisure side of our American life, appre- 
ciation and enjoyment must occupy a more important 
place in the future.

IV. PracticAL ABILITIES. 
The teacher often is criticized because her work is 
apparently impracticable. Her teaching is devoted 
almost entirely to the theory of the thing, and people 
do not see how some of the theory is to be of use. 
Present-day teachers are placing more and more em- 
phasis on ability to use what is learned than was the 
case in the past. Some important outcomes of this 
kind may be recognized. 
A. Expression. 
Children are taught to express themselves in many 
ways in the class-room. Probably the most important 
of these is secured in connection with the language 
work. The pupils are taught to put their ideas in the 
conventional garb of good usage, and are exercised 
constantly on this. This outcome of teaching has 
been recognized by most teachers in the past, and the 
chief problem that remains here is the one arising from 
method. How can pupils be taught most efficiently 
to express themselves in good English? 
Other phases of the teaching of expression arise in 
connection with painting, drawing, music, manual 
training, home economics, and dramatization work. 
Each of these presents its own problems and difficulties. 
One of the aims of the teaching of each, however, is 
to get the pupils to express themselves a little better 
than they could without training.  
-P-A-G-E-76
68 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
B. Ability to Study. 
Out of the increased emphasis that has been given 
to efficiency in teaching has come a recognition of the 
fact that pupils often do not know how to study even 
by the time they have almost finished the high school. 
The result is that teachers are emphasizing a new out- 
come of their work—ability to study. There are many 
devices and hints to aid in studying, and pupils must 
be taught these if they are to be efficient. It is a great 
gain for a person’s life, after school-days are over, to 
be able to get the exact meaning from what some one 
else has written. This is the essential element of 
ability to study. Consequently, this is an important 
practical outcome of teaching. 
C. Development of Individuality. 
The school in the past often has seemed to try to 
repress the individuality that a pupil might have, and 
thus make him like the rest. Of course, this is a 
function of the school when individuality tends to 
express itself in undesirable forms. But there are 
phases of individuality that can and ought to be 
developed, such as originality, resourcefulness, and the 
other characteristics of a useful personality. These 
phases of a pupil’s life need cultivation as well as the 
purely intellectual sides. Therefore, they should be 
among the outcomes of teaching sought. 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 69 
D. Moral Development. 
The fourth major phase of the practical-ability out- 
comes of teaching is moral development. Our schools, 
in the past, have done much to bring about a good 
moral growth along some of the lines of personal 
morality, such as industry, persistence, promptness, 
and thoroughness. Some of the moral virtues, espe- 
cially filial piety and chastity, have not been empha- 
sized much, however, and a broader work is needed. 
In the field of social morality the work of our schools 
has been even more deficient. This is one of the 
important outcomes that will be emphasized more in 
the next few years if present indications are a criterion. 
NERVE MODIFICATIONS AS THE BASIS OF 
OUTCOMES 
The modifiability of the nervous system furnishes 
the psychophysical basis of teaching outcomes. Drill 
outcomes are possible because nerve-cells, which are 
made to act together a number of times in exactly the 
same way each time, tend to act together with but little 
effort later. Knowledge outcomes have their basis in 
the fact that human experience tends to become uni- 
fied in the nervous system, those elements that are 
related in meaning becoming fused. Emotional out- 
comes also have a nervous basis, but it is not so well 
understood. It probably is founded on the well known
-P-A-G-E-78
70 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
fact that nearly all experience is retained, which 
retention makes possible its later revival. Many 
experiences have emotional colorings, which are stored 
in the nervous system along with the experiences them- 
selves and reappear when they are reinstated. All of 
the possibilities of the nervous system seem more or 
less involved in securing practical ability outcomes. 
They can not be restricted to one phase of nerve action, 
even to the limited extent that is possible with the 
other outcomes. 
RELATION OF OUTCOMES TO TEACHING METHOD 
There would be no advantage in making a detailed 
analysis of the outcomes of teaching if these were not 
related to the teaching process. But, since each out- 
come may be secured best by a particular teaching 
method, a consideration of outcomes merely gives a 
basis for the study of the details of method. Thus, the 
drill outcomes are secured most easily through drill 
exercises; the knowledge outcomes through induction, 
deduction, and similar teaching; and the emotional 
outcomes through the appreciation lesson. In the 
differentiation of these teaching methods the teaching 
process has made much progress on the art side. Some 
of these methods are subtle, however, and it takes much 
time and patience to master them to the point where 
‘they can be used effectively. It is possible, too, that 
some of them may be so exacting in their intellectual 
requirements that many teachers can never surmount 
   
-P-A-G-E-79
OUTCOMES OF TEACHING 71 
the inherent difficulties. Such limitations of the 
methods as seem to exist will be considered as each 
is presented. 
SUMMARY 
Teachers need to be able to classify the outcomes of 
teaching in order that they may realize the goals for 
which they strive. These outcomes may be classified 
into four groups: (1) knowledge outcomes; (2) drill 
outcomes; (3) emotional outcomes; and (4) practical 
ability outcomes. The knowledge outcomes may be 
subdivided into (a) facts, (b) concepts, (c) generaliza- 
tions, and (d) mental attitudes and methods of 
thought. There are two main kinds of drill outcomes, 
habits and rote associations. The emotional results 
may be divided into (a) ideals, sentiments, and preju- 
dices, and (b) appreciation and enjoyment. The 
practical-ability outcomes include (a) expression, (b) 
ability to study, (c) development of individuality, and 
(d) moral development. The possibility of securing 
these outcomes is dependent upon the modifiability of 
the nervous system. Each type of outcome may be 
secured best by the method designed for that teaching 
result.

  CHAPTER V 
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 
Berore the special teaching methods are examined, 
it will be well to consider the formal class period and 
the activities to which it is devoted generally. Under 
most conditions the work of the school-room is much 
the same from day to day. Teachers adopt a few 
devices that make the work go in a fair way, and rest 
content with the results. Often they are too busy with 
the routine things to find time for anything new. In 
some cases, it is thought, they are too indolent to make 
the attempt to learn new methods. Whatever the 
reason, the fact remains that most formal class periods 
are concerned with little beyond the acquisition of the 
contents of the text-book or syllabus. This may be 
done in a way that is very profitable. Therefore, those 
activities that are common to most class periods will be 
given the first consideration. 
I, ASSIGNMENT. 
Under conditions generally prevalent in American 
schools text-books are the chief media of instruction. 
Their use involves the assignment and study of lessons. 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
74 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
The first point for consideration among the activities 
of the formal class period, then, will be the assignment. 
A. Functions. 
1. The assignment must point out clearly to the 
pupils just what is to be done. Where it does not do 
this, pupils often waste time on things that are not 
necessary for the day’s work. Sometimes a hazy 
assignment will result in pupils trying to do work 
beyond their capabilities. On the other hand, hazy 
assignments often give the class a chance to come to 
the recitation but partly prepared. They “couldn’t 
find this or that reference”; “You never told us to do 
that”; such are the responses a teacher often receives 
who has not been clear in her assignments. Sometimes 
classes deliberately loaf. When this is the case, the 
teacher often can throw the responsibility back upon 
the guilty ones, if a few members of the class have done 
the work. The fact that some of them did the work 
is prima facie evidence that the assignment was made. 
Those who missed it have no one but themselves to 
blame for their carelessness, and ought to suffer the 
consequences. 
2. The assignment may be clear and yet fail because 
it does not tell how the work is to be done. There 
often are obstacles to the preparation of the lesson, 
which might be removed by a little assistance. This 
assistance should constitute a part of the assignment. 
3. The third function of the assignment is to give 
     
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 75 
the pupils reasons why they should do the work. This 
is what is usually known as motivation. A simple form 
of motivation occurs when the teacher shows that there 
is a need for the particular information contained in 
the day’s lesson. Sometimes it will be sufficient for 
the teacher to remark, “You will need to know this 
when you do so and so.” At other times a sufficient 
motive will be given by the raising of the problematic 
situation. ‘“To solve the problem, it will be necessary 
to master this particular piece of work.” With most 
pupils, even those of the senior high school, motives 
are much more effective if not too remote—not too far 
in the future. 
B. Time to Make the Assignment. 
The only hard-and-fast rule that can be given about 
the time to make the assignment is one that is negative. 
It should never be made so late in the class period that 
it can not be completed properly before the class is 
dismissed. Nothing is more conducive to poor assign- 
ments than the practice of some teachers who wait until 
the bell rings for dismissal and then make hurried 
assignments. ‘To prevent this from happening, some 
teachers always make the assignment at the beginning 
of the hour. A uniform procedure of this kind is not 
best, because unexpected events may arise in the class 
period that make it expedient to modify the work for 
the next period. In general, however, if a uniform time 
is adopted, it probably is best if set at the beginning 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
76 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
of the period. Motivation often makes it desirable to 
wait until the recitation has made some progress. The 
teacher who has mastered the art of assigning lessons 
makes the assignment near the beginning of the hour, 
as a rule, but is always ready to meet the emergency 
by a temporary readjustment. 
C. Length. 
The amount of time that should be taken in assign- 
ing a lesson depends upon the situation involved. The 
assignment in which the pupils are told to study “From 
page 97 to page 104” is the most difficult for the pupils 
that a teacher can make. Of course, the lesson may 
be one of a series of similar tasks, and in such a case 
the pupils may need no further directions than the 
pages covered. The page assignment is the ideal one 
toward which a teacher should strive, but it can not 
be used every day throughout the school year, if the 
pupils are to be assisted as unusual lessons often de- 
mand. It has the advantage of definiteness, but lacks 
motivation and does not tell how the new work can be 
done best. Whenever a new topic or a new phase of 
the work is encountered, there is need for a complete 
assignment that will remove obstacles and give the 
right kind of motive. In some cases, where it is neces- 
sary for the teacher to develop a term or concept, the 
entire period may be given over to the assignment of 
the lesson; or, in rare cases, more than a period may — 
be required. A teacher’s most effective work is often
-P-A-G-E-85
  
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 77 
done in making the assignment, and she who never 
makes a detailed, motivated one is neglecting a chance 
to do the best kind of work. 
D. Method. 
There is no one method that can be used always. 
The method must be suited to the lesson’s subject- 
matter. When the different teaching methods are con- 
sidered in detail in the following chapters, the forms 
of assignment that are the natural sequence of the 
different steps will be given. As long as page assign- 
ments are used, but little method is involved; but 
when a teacher attempts to prepare the pupils for their 
study, and tries to motivate the work, method becomes 
very important. 
ae. RECITATION. 
The second main activity into which the formal class 
period divides is the recitation. Under most condi- 
tions, the time that is not used in making the assign- 
ment is given over to the class recitation. This exer- 
cise is very important in most schools, because this is 
the time when the real teaching is done. Some edu- 
cators have proposed to eliminate the recitation as 
something not needed. To do away with the recitation 
will be to lose many of the advantages of group think- 
ing. The introduction of group thinking into the work 
of our schools is too great an advance to be sacrificed 
unnecessarily. The recitation can be modified to meet 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
78 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
the criticisms without losing its advantages. The 
various points will be clearer after the topic has been 
considered in its different aspects. 
A. Functions. 
1. A check on the assignment.—The recitation is 
intended primarily to serve as a means of ascertaining 
whether the pupils have performed the tasks set for 
them in the assignment. Pupils seldom do serious, 
careful work in the study period unless there is a faith- 
ful checking up at frequent intervals to see what has 
been done. In addition to finding out whether the 
allotted tasks have been completed, the recitation gives 
an opportunity to learn whether the assignment was 
adequate. If pupils reveal a misunderstanding of 
what they were told to do, it is a reflection on the 
assignment. If they come to the recitation in a half- 
prepared state, they were asked to do too much, were 
not told definitely what to do, or were not prepared 
to do it by the preceding work. There may be excep- 
tions to this classification, but a situation of this sort ~ 
indicates something in need of readjustment. In these 
various ways this part of the formal class period acts 
as a check on the assignment. 
Some teachers seem to think that the function of the 
recitation that has just been discussed is the only one. 
Day after day the entire period is spent in checking 
up to see that the pupils have their lessons. Some- 
times, to be sure, the teacher is hard pressed to fill in
-P-A-G-E-87
    
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 79 
the time in this way, but it is done in some manner. 
Teachers in all subjects are offenders along this line. 
The mathematics teacher asks the pupils to recite on 
the problems they have studied at home; the Latin 
teacher does nothing but send the class over the twenty 
lines of Cesar that constituted the study lesson, secur- 
ing details of translation; the geography teacher asks 
questions that require no other answer than the words 
found in the text. Furthermore, many of our present- 
day text-books in the public schools are so rich in 
content that the téacher has a hard time to teach them 
without going into detail in this way. Such work, how- 
ever, neglects one of the most important purposes of 
the recitation—that of organizing the lesson content. 
2. A time to organize the lesson content.—The 
recitation offers the best time for this. Nothing seems 
to surpass group gatherings for sane thinking, where 
mind responds to mind and opinions are exchanged 
freely. When led by a skilful teacher, the class-room 
is an admirable place for the organization of the lesson 
‘content in this way. Problems are raised, and each 
pupil offers his bit to the final solution. In this think- 
ing, however, it is possible for the teacher to do too 
much of the work. The pupils must have a chance 
to share in it, and the thought movement must be slow 
enough to adapt itself to their immaturity. Further, 
the lesson must be logically organized and connected 
with other material if it is to be remembered well. 
3. Introduction of new materials.—In addition to
-P-A-G-E-88
80 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
the two preceding uses, the recitation offers an oppor- 
tunity for the introduction of new materials. Ideas 
contributed by the teacher or pupils always have an 
added interest in the personality of the one who offers 
them. Many times the text-book is not designed per- 
fectly for the needs of the particular school in which 
it is used. In such cases supplementary materials are 
very helpful. When pupils are the contributors, the 
pleasure they get out of the situation often is more 
valuable than what is offered. Materials offered by 
the pupils may need amplification or correction, and 
the recitation offers a chance to do this. 
B. Forms of the Recitation. 
1. Mere reproduction.—When the first function of 
the recitation is much emphasized, the form that 
results is usually nothing but the reproduction of 
the text-book. Sometimes this is a verbatim, word- 
for-word reproduction. At other times it is an un- 
organized account of the lesson. It hardly seems 
conceivable that, under present teaching conditions, 
children would be asked to memorize the exact words 
of the geography, history, or physiology text; yet the 
writer has known of teachers who, in recent years, have 
taught in this way in rural schools. It was the pre- 
vailing method of one hundred years ago, but is so 
wasteful that it ought to have been abandoned long 
ago. The unorganized reproduction in the pupils’ own 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 81 
words is quite an advance over the verbatim form, but 
it is rather inadequate. 
2. Topical.—The topical recitation is a marked im- 
provement over the preceding form. It gives the 
opportunity for a logical organization of the lesson 
materials, which is wanting in a purely reproductive 
recitation. This is true especially when the outline 
followed is the product of the effort of the teacher and 
pupils. When the recitation does nothing but repro- 
duce the list of topics given in the text, it is of less 
merit. In any of its degrees of perfection, however, 
this recitation form always emphasizes organization, 
and that is a point of much merit. 
In the topical recitation an outline must be prepared 
beforehand. The recitation then may be conducted 
by referring to the outline for topics. When a group 
of pupils is assigned the task of preparing the outline 
for the next day’s recitation in their study period, it 
has been found to provide them with valuable training. 
The plan is sometimes used as follows: When a satis- 
factory outline has been formed by the pupils and 
approved by the teacher, it is copied on the blackboard 
in the recitation-room where it may be used. By 
apportioning the task of making the outlines among 
different groups, the spirit of rivalry and competition 
tends to enliven the work. Further, the pupils learn 
the value of codperating with one another. As has 
been suggested, these outlines are the basis of the reci-
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
tations. When the class is called for the regular work, 
the teacher requests a pupil to take the first topic. 
If this pupil completes it satisfactorily, another takes 
up the next. If the work is not what was expected, 
teacher and class supplement it before proceeding to 
the next topic. After a few weeks of this work pupils 
learn the value and the method of organizing lesson 
facts. 
3- Question and answer.—When the recitation is 
conducted by question-and-answer methods, its possi- 
bilities are limited only by the lesson material and the 
ingenuity of the teacher. In quality this form of reci- 
tation varies from the very best to the most mediocre. 
Its degree of excellence depends almost entirely upon 
the phrasing and distribution of the questions. To 
handle this work satisfactorily a teacher must think 
rapidly and clearly. These qualities are inborn to a 
large extent. Hence it will be true always that ideal 
questioning will be found rarely in the complicated 
situations of the class-room, with its many rapid 
thought changes. A number of the features of 
questioning frequently become habits with teachers. 
Therefore it will be profitable to dwell at some length 
upon the various phases of questioning in order that 
the right habits may be initiated by those teachers who 
read this chapter and who wish to form them. 
a. Purpose of questions: In the ordinary activities 
of life, people usually ask questions to secure informa- 
“tion. In most cases this requires only the simplest 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 83 
interrogative sentences. How far is it to B? Which 
road leads to the bridge? How much is this calico a 
yard? Do you think it will rain? Where is my rain- 
coat? These are typical of the questions of every-day 
life. In the school-room, however, in addition to such 
simple questions as seek information, teachers use 
,- thought-provoking types. In fact, the main purpose 
of the question in the recitation should be to provoke 
thought or to raise a problem. The trouble with the 
mere information-getting form is that no one is really 
interested in the answer contained in the text-book, 
for nearly every one knows it. One of the main aims 
of the question-and-answer recitation is to stimulate 
y interest and bring about a new organization of the 
lesson facts. 
b. Social nature of the recitation: In contrast to 
the questions of private life, which are addressed 
usually to one person, the questions of the class-room 
are addressed to a group. The good question provokes 
thought effort on the part of every member of the class. 
In other words, in the school-room questions are social, 
while in private life they are individualistic. Outside 
of the class-room, when one person has not been talking 
to another and desires his attention, he always prefixes 
his name to the question. In the school-room, the 
_ e 
social nature of the process requires that the name 
come last. If the questioning of the school-room is 
to realize this social ideal, it can never be conducted ? 
in a routine order, where the pupils know before the 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
question is asked who is to give the answer. Asking 
questions in a fixed order often results in lifeless recit- 
ing, with the pupils preparing lessons only when they 
think they are scheduled to recite. 
c. Form of questions: The older books on question- 
ing sometimes said, ‘Never use questions that can be 
answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’”’; but such a rule is arbitrary. 
Sometimes a question that demands a definite affirma- 
tive or negative answer may be used very effectively. 
It commits the pupils to a point of view, which they 
may be called upon to defend later. The indiscrim- 
inate use of leading and “yes” and “no” questions that 
are not followed up with analyzing questions leads to 
guessing. This is to be condemned as a general 
practice. 
The question must have a form that will bring about 
the thought development at which the teacher aims. 
It must be framed to meet the particular class situation 
“in which it is used. This is true especially of the 
simple questions that round out the thought of the 
pupils’ responses when they are deficient. Pupils 
often can answer the questions more easily if a few 
introductory remarks are made by the teacher as a 
setting for the question. In doing this, however, the 
teacher should avoid the form in which the question 
is appended at the end of a lengthy declarative state- 
ment; as, “Having examined the dandelion floret under 
the microscope, what did you find?” Teachers who 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
    
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 85 
have difficulty in asking questions will find it helpful 
to write out a few main questions when they prepare 
the day’s work. An outline of the lesson is another 
aid to effective questioning. 
d. Number of questions: Some teachers ask too 
many detailed questions. They deal with petty facts 
all of the time, and never touch the important things. 
Where a lesson is on material arranged in topical form 
in the text-book, there need be but one real question for 
each topic. The number of questions that should be 
used depends upon the kind of lesson being taught, and 
no arbitrary regulation can be laid down for all situa- 
tions. The tendency of most untrained teachers is to 
use too many questions. It is difficult to get the pupils 
to recite at length at first, but they soon learn to do it. 
Pupils usually try to give the teacher what she wants, 
unless what is desired is entirely beyond their abilities, 
and if a teacher persists in requesting topical recita- 
tions she will get them in time. 
e. Characteristics of good questions: A well known 
writer on the technique of teaching gives the following 
as some of the characteristics of good questions: 
“1, Questions should call up associated facts. 2. They 
~ should not be ends in themselves, but should carry the 
thought forward. 3. They should not be so indefinite 
as to permit of guesswork. 4. They should be inter- 
rogative in form, not declarative in all but the final 
word. 5. They should bring out the subject-matter in
-P-A-G-E-94
86 “THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
the order of dependence, or logical relationship, if such 
exists.” These points sum up most of the charac- 
teristics of good questions, especially when considered 
in the light of the preceding discussion. 
| f. Distribution of questions: The questions should 
be distributed among all the pupils of the class. It is 
seldom a good plan to call upon one part of the class 
so frequently as to neglect the rest. The pupils at 
the edge of the class are liable to be neglected by some 
teachers. Others have a tendency to overlook those 
in the back or the front of the room. Whenever a 
teacher discovers a tendency of this nature and realizes 
that some of the pupils are being neglected, it is well 
for her to adopt some device that will remedy the evil. 
Although the questions should be distributed 
throughout the class, this distribution should not be 
indiscriminate. Attention must be given to indi- 
vidual differences, and questions should be within the 
capabilities of the pupils called upon to answer them. 
Further, memory questions may be answered quickly, 
but thought questions demand much time. Sometimes 
recitations are conducted so rapidly that only about 
one fifth of the pupils really have time to think out 
the answers. Teachers must allow time enough for 
adeauate answers, but must not delay the whole class 
unreasonably while the slow pupil takes time to think 
out his reply. There is a happy medium. 
g. Pupil answers: Teachers must require the pupils 
*Lida B. Earhart, Types of Teaching, p. 100. 
   
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 87 
to attemit to answer the questions that they ask. 
Pupils en,oy getting the teacher off the lesson topic, 
when permitted to do so. Teachers who have this 
failing are sometimes led astray systematically by their 
classes. This situation is entirely under the teacher’s 
control, and is checked readily by demanding answers 
that stick to the topics under discussion. Pupils who 
systematically “bluff” do so because the teacher is 
deceived thereby, or appears to be. 
Teachers must not get into the habit of undue com- 
mendation of pupil answers. A simple “Yes” or 
“Good” is all that the average reply should evoke. 
Even the most meritorious answer need not be com- 
mended especially, because the knowledge that they 
have answered difficult questions correctly is reward 
enough for most pupils. The silent admiration of 
classmates is often more effective as commendation 
than anything the teacher may say. In like manner, 
reproof should be used but sparingly. It is so easy 
to overdo this that it 1s safe to say that nine tenths 
of the pupils should never have any serious reproof. 
The fact that their answers are incorrect is enough. 
If praise is overdone, it does not seem to do much 
harm to the pupils, though it tends to lessen the 
influence of the teacher; but too much censuring is 
disastrous, because it arouses enmity and develops 
antagonism. 
The teacher should never form the habit of repeating 
pupil answers. There are times when it may be neces-
-P-A-G-E-96
88 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
sary to repeat the answers for emphasis, or to make 
those in a distant part of the room hear: but each 
repetition should be a conscious act of the teacher, and 
not the result of habit. Neither is it a good plan to 
make a practice of repeating questions for pupils who 
fail to catch them. 
4. Pupil reports.—The fourth form of the recitation 
that will be considered is that in which the time is 
occupied with pupil reports. In history, geography, 
literature, and some of the other subjects, occasions 
frequently arise when supplementary information is 
desired. When suitable sources are available, the 
pupils may bring this material to class in individual 
reports. There are a number of advantages and dis- 
advantages in such recitations. 
Pupil reports are always motivated. The fact that 
a pupil brings to class information that no one else 
knows gives him a real incentive for good work. When 
every one knows what is recited, there is little interest 
in what is said; but when the facts are entirely new, 
attention is spontaneous. Pupil reports enrich the 
lesson without much extra work on the part of the 
teacher. It is much less fatiguing for the teacher to 
supervise pupil reports than it is for her to gather the 
. material and present it herself. The teacher must not 
allow the reports to be unsupervised, however, for they 
need careful attention. As far as possible, the teacher 
should be able to supplement the recitations at every 
stage. The best work will be secured when the teacher 
   
-P-A-G-E-97
    
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 89 
is so well prepared that she can give the reports better 
than the pupils, if necessary. This thorough prepara- 
tion will command respect, which will be reflected in 
a high grade of pupil work. 
Pupil reports tend to review things that have been 
presented earlier. The partly familiar facts are pre- 
sented in a new light. Pupil reports are of value, also, 
in furnishing another point of view from which to 
determine the capabilities of the class members. When 
pupils stand before their fellows, they go through a 
different test from that of the ordinary recitation. 
Individual differences become more noticeable. Some- 
times such work reveals pupils who are unusually 
capable but who do not measure up to their possi- 
bilities in the ordinary work. In other cases, the work 
before the class may explain why poor work is done 
every day, why the pupil never does well in examina- 
tions or in anything else. 
The chief drawback to pupil reports is that they 
often lack the proper organization to make them very 
effective. The materials are presented in a way that 
leaves nothing clear. The reports should be carefully 
organized beforehand. Often it is time well spent for 
the teacher to consult the pupils before class and go 
over the outlines and the recitations with them. When 
the reports are given, the remainder of the class should 
have a copy of the outline for reference and should take 
notes upon what is given. At its close they should 
be encouraged to ask questions until all difficulties have
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
disappeared. Pupils give close attention to reports if 
they are called upon to give a summary of them. 
Closely related to pupil reports is the practice of 
encouraging pupils to bring in lists of unanswered 
questions on the lesson. These furnish the materials 
for valuable discussions. Pupils develop skill rapidly 
after a little practice in this work. 
C. Characteristics of the Good Recitation. 
The chief characteristic of good recitations is the 
presence of thought-organizing activities. Whenever 
a real thought development is present the pupils will 
be interested. To secure this condition of affairs it 
is necessary to use supplementary materials when they 
are pertinent to the lesson. A ready use of good 
supplmentary facts, in content subjects especially, 
always adds zest to the recitation and is very helpful. 
The good recitation, moreover, is not a pure form 
as has been analyzed in the preceding pages. The 
materials that are covered in the class period often do 
not lend themselves to one form. The skilful teacher 
will use a mixture of the forms as they fit the subject- 
matter. This is true especially when the various spe- 
cial lesson forms, which are discussed in later chapters, 
are taken into account. The fact that a teacher has 
used nothing but the topical form or the question-and- 
answer form of recitation in a period is no reason for 
saying that she has done the highest grade of work. 
It might have been better to combine the two. In any 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
THE FORMAL CLASS PERIOD 91 
case, it is well for the teacher to know which form is 
being used. 
Another important characteristic of the good recita- 
tion is that it checks up all points assigned to the 
pupils for which they ought to be held definitely 
responsible. This phase is essential to the recitation. 
III. Spectan TEacHING Forms. . 
The uses of the formal class period that have been 
described thus far are about all that are found in the 
work done by many teachers. The artists of the pro- 
fession, however, use special teaching forms, which are 
more certain to secure the various outcomes of teaching 
that have been analyzed in the preceding chapter. In 
using these forms the teacher breaks away from the 
text-book or syllabus, and reorganizes the materials so 
that they may be presented more effectively. Some of 
these teaching forms might easily be regarded as varia- 
tions of some of the recitation forms, but it is better 
to consider them from the point of view of the out- 
comes that they secure. They all take the time ot the 
formal class period, sometimes monopolizing both reci- 
tation and assignment. They have been enumerated 
briefly at the close of the preceding chapter, and will 
be presented in detail on the following pages. 
SUMMARY 
The formal class period usually is divided into the 
lesson assignment and the recitation. The lesson as- 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
signment should tell the pupils just what they are to 
do, how they should do it, and why it is necessary. 
The assignment may be made at any time in the class 
period, but should not be made so late that it is hurried. 
Enough time should be given to it to do it properly. 
The method depends upon the lesson subject-matter. 
The recitation should check up on the assignment at 
all necessary points, should help to organize the lesson 
content, and should introduce and evaluate new ma- 
terial. The merely reproductive form of the recitation 
has the least value. The topical form is good for 
certain kinds of subject-matter. The question-and- 
answer recitation is the best, when properly conducted. 
Questions are intended to provoke thought in the 
class-room. They are addressed to a group, and must 
be formed and distributed with this in mind. The 
form of the question’ must be determined by the setting 
in the class, though a few forms should be avoided 
as far as possible. The number of questions to be used 
is determined also by the class setting. Questions 
should be so distributed that they will reach all the 
class. The answers of the pupils should be pertinent 
to the questions, and should not be repeated habitually 
by the teacher. 
When the recitation takes the form of pupil reports, 
it makes use of the motivation that is present when 
a pupil has something new to give to his fellows. 
Pupil reports often are unorganized and fail to be 
effective.

The good recitation is characterized by the presence 
of thought-organizing activities. It often is not a 
pure form, but combines several forms.

  CHAPTER VI 
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 
THE most important task that confronts the teacher 
in the junior and senior high schools is the problem 
of presenting knowledge in such a way that the pupils 
actually acquire it. There are fundamental habits to 
be established, and feelings and emotions to be im- 
parted; but the pupils spend more time in learning 
facts and other forms of knowledge than in all other 
activities put together. This is a reason why the 
knowledge phase of teaching is considered so essential. 
It is the reason, too, why in the past teaching has 
been primarily a purely intellectual process. Knowl- 
edge is imparted to most pupils if it is merely kept 
before them systematically. This explains why pupils 
have been so successful in acquiring information in the 
past. Although most teachers knew little or nothing 
about the fine points of the educative process a few 
years ago, this deficiency did not prevent their efforts 
from being fairly successful. By keeping the informa- 
tion before their pupils they secured very gratifying 
results. 
In contrast to this empirical method, it has been 
96
-P-A-G-E-105
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 97 
shown many times that an organization of knowledge 
which is based on the laws of the mental development 
of the child—an application of the fine points of 
teaching—is more effective. Of course, it takes a cer- 
tain mental alertness to be able to present information 
in these artistic ways. Because of this, some people 
are limited in their teaching efforts mainly to keeping 
the information before their pupils. This does not 
mean that the teachers who are more capable should 
not become skilled in the finer points of the technique 
of teaching. Some educators have been confused on 
this point, and have failed to see the value of these 
special teaching methods because they, or some of their 
students, never learned to use them. These artistic 
methods are of value, and some of them are not very 
difficult. The simplest method for imparting knowl- 
edge—type studies—will be considered first. 
I. Type StTupizs. 
A. Nature of. 
When a teacher makes use of the type-study method 
of imparting knowledge, a typical case of the thing to 
be studied is taken for a detailed examination. Con- 
tent studies, such as history, geography, physiology, 
and the sciences, lend themselves best to this method. 
A geographical illustration will be most serviceable in 
showing its application. If the class were studying the 
transportation systems of the United States, one of 
the main trunk-lines of the country might be selected 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
as typical of great railroads. The class would study 
the rolling stock—the engines, and the freight-, pas- 
senger-, sleeping-, and dining-cars; the road-bed, with 
its tracks, ties, and rock ballast; the safety provisions 
of signals and watchmen; the army of men that is 
needed in the movement of trains and the upkeep of 
the various parts of the system; going into detail until 
the term railroad system was most meaningful. When 
possible, visits would be made to the railroad tracks, 
yards, shops, and offices. Pictures would be shown to 
make remote things clear, and maps and drawings 
might be used also. Every device would be employed 
to make one big idea clear. Then, in later study, 
reference could be made, as occasion arose, to this type, 
thus making it possible to explain how other railroads 
differ. 
B. Outcomes. 
As can be seen readily, the outcomes of this lesson 
will be very rich concepts. The term railroad system 
will be most meaningful. Around this central idea will 
be many facts of less importance in various stages of 
organization and clearness. 
C. Strength of the Type-Study Method. 
The strongest point of the type-study method is its 
simplicity. Nearly every person who enters the 
school-room to direct the work is keen enough to select 
a type and present the materials related to it. Those 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 99 
who are not probably ought not to teach. The ten- 
dency to emphasize details, characteristic of this 
method of teaching, always makes the work concrete, 
and interest is usually very good. Studying one thing 
in detail is the way most of us learn in ordinary life, 
and from that point of view the method is psycho- 
logical. For that matter, educators often have advo- 
cated that we return to such intensive study in our 
schools. Under the present conditions of many items 
superficially treated, it might prove of much value to 
do so. 
This method depends for its success, in the main, 
upon the organization of subject-matter. This fact 
has been used in the past as a basis for the construction 
of text-books. Histories, geographies, zodlogies, and 
botanies have been prepared from this point of view, 
and have done much to enrich the school-room curric- 
ulum. The intensive treatment of type topics that 
is needed tends to make such books too detailed, how- 
ever, and in the hands of untrained teachers they are 
not very successful. The fact that different teachers 
will choose different types for study makes it necessary 
for the text-book-makers to include several types of 
many things. Unless many details are included, these 
books need much supplementing. If enough are pre- 
sented, the books are somewhat unwieldy. In subjects 
where definite types have been adopted widely, the 
type-study arrangement is a very helpful point of 
view from which to organize books.

  100 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
D. Weaknesses. 
The type-study method is sometimes attacked from 
the logical point of view by saying that in this plan 
of teaching children form generalizations from one 
example, and thus tend to form hasty conclusions. 
These critics insist that this method is intended pri- 
marily for the enrichment of ideas, not for the develop- 
ment of generalizations. However, if the work is 
guided by a skilful teacher, there is little more danger 
of flighty conclusions from this teaching form than 
from others. Although only one example is in the 
foreground of the class’s attention, many others are 
in past experience, and influence thought. Whenever 
pupils have no related past experience, there is little 
organizing or classifying done in their minds, under any 
teaching method. 
A real difficulty in using this method in many schools 
is the lack of suitable supplementary material. To be 
most serviceable, an extensive library, accessible both 
to teachers and pupils, is needed. Much help may be 
obtained from the National Geographic Magazine, 
The Mentor, and similar periodicals; but these are not 
always at hand. 
This method is limited for its success by the types 
chosen for study. Sometimes the teachers choose poor 
types, and the conclusions consequently are not of 
much value. Familiarity with this form of teaching 
will enable those using it to select types suited to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 101 
method. Another limitation that should be noted is 
that type-study methods are of no value in those sub- 
jects and phases of subjects where a rich content is 
lacking. Such topics do not give knowledge outcomes, 
and other teaching methods should be used. 
II. Exposition. 
The second method of imparting knowledge that will 
-be considered is exposition, or telling. This form of 
teaching is the dominant form in the lower grades and 
in the college. In the last six grades of the public 
school this method is somewhat in ill repute, because 
those who have applied it have tried to use a college 
style. In the primary room the teacher tells the chil- 
dren many things that they remember, She selects 
things fitted to the immaturity of the children—stories, 
bits of information, and the like. That is the reason 
for her success. In college the teacher is interested in 
a logical organization of his materials and is a master 
of the details, His students are mature enough to 
grasp the logical arrangement, and there are so many 
details that they are interested easily, When the high- 
school teacher tries to boil down the logical organiza- 
tion of the subject, and omits most of the details, it is 
no wonder that the pupils are bored and fail to respond. 
Fundamentally, however, there is no reason why the 
expository method can not be adapted to teaching in 
the high school. All that is needed to make this form 
useful is a selection of materials suited to the pupils
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
and the observance of a few of the principles of 
expository presentation. 
A. When to Use Exposition. 
There are many occasions in the average class period 
when a bit of pertinent information is needed to round 
out the point before the class. This is the time for 
the teacher to use this form of teaching. Some 
teachers get so thoroughly in the habit of eliciting 
everything from the class by questioning that they 
never think of the possibility of anything else. Some- 
times much time can be saved in teaching by a little 
telling on the part of the teacher. In the schools of 
France and Germany this form of instruction is relied 
upon mainly. If it can be the main method of the 
foreign teacher, it must have some merit—enough, at 
least, for an occasional use in the more advanced 
grades of the American public school. It seems pos- 
sible to use this form freely, when the pupils do not 
have the information and it is not worth while for 
them to hunt for it in a study lesson. If the teacher 
knows the facts, the best thing to be done is for her 
to tell them in a way that the pupils can comprehend. 
To do this is to impart knowledge effectively. 
B. Technique of Expository Teaching. 
Assuming that the teacher wishes to do a somewhat 
extended bit of expository teaching covering five min- 
utes or more, the work may be divided into several 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
    IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 103 
steps. The principles that make this work effective 
will be serviceable in less extended applications of this 
method of teaching. These steps may be condensed 
or omitted at times, but the thought movement must 
be complete. 
1. Approach.—Before an attempt is made to pre- 
sent the new material, it is necessary thatthe minds 
of the pupils be prepared for it. The usual method 
of doing this is to recall the related experiences of the 
pupils in such a manner as to put them in the proper 
frame of mind. The approach should aim to give the 
teacher and pupils a common mental background. 
Ambiguity results where this is not done. Thus, if 
the teacher wished to tell the pupils about the Grand 
Banks of Newfoundland, and the term banks had the 
common meaning of a place where money is kept, the 
lesson would not make much progress until this diffi- 
culty was removed. Other illustrations are furnished 
by the school-room jokes so often found in newspapers 
and magazines. This lack of a common mental back- 
ground is the reason for many failures when teachers 
attempt to make interesting additions to the lesson. 
The approach should end by placing the point to be 
explained clearly before the pupils. This clarity must 
be such that there is a real desire to know more. In 
other words, there must be alesson aim. The fact that 
an aim is present, however, need not lead to a formal 
statement of it, such as has characterized teaching 
occasionally in the past. This lesson aim should be
-P-A-G-E-112
104 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
felt as a need by the pupils, and no amount of formal 
phrasing alone will bring this result. When teachers 
first were trained to make statements of their lesson 
alms, they sometimes went to extremes to secure them. 
Thus, it is said that in these schools it was a common 
practice for the student-teacher, for the want of any- 
thing better when this stage was reached, to say, “Now, 
children, our lesson aim is to see what comes next.” 
A good plan for securing the proper pupil attitude 
toward the new knowledge that is to be presented has 
been called, figuratively, creating a vacuum. By this 
is meant cultivating mental attitudes that are so ready 
for the assimilation of new knowledge that no special 
effort is required to impart it. The way this can be 
done may be illustrated by the manner in which a 
group of pupils was stimulated to want to learn short 
division. ‘This phase of arithmetic had been neglected 
somewhat in the fifth grade that furnished the illus- 
tration, and the supervisor thought she would help 
matters along by creating a desire to know how to 
do it. 
The plan used was this: Lists containing short prob- 
lems in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and short 
division were prepared, which were presented to the 
pupils on successive days in ten-minute periods just 
before recess. The pupils knew how to do the first 
three fundamental operations, but had never learned 
short division. The papers were marked and returned 
to the pupils each day before the day’s session closed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
    IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 105 
On the first day only one or two pupils showed much 
interest in short division. On the second day these 
had learned how to do the work and solved their 
problems correctly. Others then began to want to 
know how to do these problems. On the third day 
the supervisor and the teacher in charge were almost 
overwhelmed in their leisure periods with requests 
from the pupils who wanted to be shown the secret of 
“carrying,” so as to get the correct answer. 
This is an example of the development of definite 
aims. The principle employed is to allow the pupils 
to attempt to do something they think they can do, 
but for which, in reality, they are unprepared. The 
pupils may think they can spell correctly, write gram- 
matically, or do some other task as it should be done, 
but an actual trial will convince them of the contrary. 
In class situations of another sort the vacuum may 
be created by proposing solutions for problems, or try- 
ing solutions proposed, which will not prove satis- 
factory when tried. 
In preparing for new information, the teaching 
should be positive, not negative. This means that 
nothing should be taught that must be unlearned later. 
The device, in reality, is incompleteness. A part of 
the complete result should be given, so that the whole 
may be sought later. Thus, the way for a technical 
term may be prepared by using a long, cumbersome 
phrase that is full of meaning. 
2. Presentation.—a. Presentation proper: When
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
the teacher has a class before her that wants to know 
. about the topic of the period, she is ready for the real 
expository teaching, or the presentation proper. There 
are several principles that aid the teacher in the pre- 
sentation. 
The first is that everything must be connected with 
what the pupils know; all new things must be related 
to previous experience. 
The second is that the point under consideration 
must-be-seen by pupils and teacher from the same men- 
tal point of view. It does little good for a teacher 
to present minute details to a class that is not familiar 
already with the object as a whole. What seems per- 
fectly clear to the teacher may be quite unintelligible 
to the pupils. Only when the teacher can summarize 
a number of points that are already a part of the men- 
tal equipment of the pupils, and bring in the new item 
after a “therefore,” is it certain that the teacher and 
pupils are thinking together. 
The third principle is that expounding means inter- 
preting and explaining. It is not merely the presenta- 
tion of facts, but their connections, that should be 
emphasized. The facts themselves are often of im- 
portance only as they give meaning to the principles 
they support. 
The fourth principle is that there should be an 
arrangement of materials that-will present small units 
first. These then are combined into larger ones. This 
plan of logical arrangement permits pauses or breath- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
    IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 107 
ing spaces at the end of the larger units. Time must 
be given for the ideas presented to set or be fixed in 
memory, for it is one of the fundamental laws of 
psychology that the brain cells need time to assimilate 
experience if they are to retain it. If things are 
presented too rapidly, each new experience seems to 
obliterate the preceding, and nothing is remembered 
clearly. This implies, then, that the teacher must not 
go too rapidly in the presentation, but must give time 
for the minds of the pupils to work properly. 
Expository teaching is much more effective if some 
of the conventional aids to exposition are used. The 
most common ones are analogies, stories, and illus- 
trations. Each has its merits and shortcomings. The 
skilled teacher avails herself of those that meet her 
needs, and thus makes her teaching more realistic. 
Analogies are very useful at times when the other 
aids are not available. They are of especial service in 
making more concrete the abstract facts of experience. 
Often the easiest way to make actions or qualities clear 
is to point out their resemblance to those that are 
known. Analogies, however, are not always depend- 
able. They may imply more than is intended, and 
again they may fall short of the predetermined goal. 
Teachers should never use analogies so frequently that 
they can not find good ones. False analogies are worse 
than none, for they mislead. 
The story also is valuable in the hands of the skilled 
teacher. It may be used to communicate facts that
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
could not be imparted readily alone. There is a 
thread of interest in the good story, where the right 
sort of characters are portrayed, which makes it almost 
as good as actual blood-and-bone individuals. Further, 
the story permits the desired facts to be manipulated 
in a manner that will make them stand out more 
prominently than they do in real life. 
In addition to imparting knowledge, the story may 
be used to incite*to action or to suggest general prin- 
ciples that may control action. This is one of the 
places where expository teaching connects up with 
moral education. Unless the story is well selected, it 
may fail to attain the desired goal because the inci- 
dental things obscure the facts or principles that are 
intended to be taught. In using stories the teacher 
must allow them to do the teaching. It never pays 
to moralize or to put a moral at the end. Children 
of the present react to these just as we did when we 
were children. When we came to the moral at the 
end, we skipped to the next story. 
Illustrations are of no value except as they impart 
information. This information must be intrinsic in 
them. This point is obvious and need not be elab- 
orated. 
Illustrations are of many sorts. These vary from 
the actual objects under discussion to the merest skele- 
ton suggestion of them. When the real object can be 
brought into the school-room, and is of such a size 
as to be visible to all in the class, it is best to use it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 109 
When objects are very large, very small, or very com- 
plicated, it is sometimes better to use models. Thus, 
a model of an Atlantic passenger liner or of the eye 
of a fly will be more serviceable than the real thing. 
The various parts are made more intelligible by the 
decrease or increase in size. 
Teachers often do not have access to models. Under 
these circumstances they may use pictures or some of 
the related forms of illustration. Pictures, especially 
when reproduced on a large scale by the stereopticon 
or reflectoscope, are very serviceable. Children are so 
used to looking at them that they find little difficulty 
in interpreting them because of their artificial nature. 
Pictorial illustrations range in kind from actual photo- 
graphic reproductions to the simplest diagrams. Some- 
times a conventionalized form is better than the actual 
photograph, because it reveals the significant features 
better. The same is true of the diagram. 
Diagrams are very useful because they often are 
constructed easily. At times the teacher may sketch 
diagrams on the blackboard while talking. To do this 
it is not necessary for her to be an artist. The simplest 
lines and crudest diagrams are often very effective in 
the class-room. Teachers should use the blackboard 
freely in exposition. It is very effective as a means 
for holding the wavering attention of the pupils. 
Closely related to diagrams are outlines and sum- 
maries. These tend to put related things together 
before the pupils, so as to make them more objective.
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
b. Summary: After the teacher has given all of the 
new material that comes in the presentation, and has 
used every device to make it clear, one thing more must 
be done before asking the pupils to take the last step 
in the lesson. The facts have been presented in much 
detail and sometimes with apparent digressions. Before 
leaving the point under discussion, it is well to go back 
to the aim set up in the approach and summarize the 
facts presented. This summary will set facts in their 
proper relations and will help much in making the 
presentation effective. Its neglect often will cause any 
extended effort at exposition to be lacking in value. 
3. Application.—The final step in the expository 
lesson is the application. One of the most effective 
tests of the success of a teacher’s effort is the results 
secured when the pupils are asked to use what they 
have been taught. This problem is too complex for a 
brief discussion; hence a detailed consideration will be 
found in a later chapter. If nothing better is desired, 
the teacher may use some form of test or examination 
as the step application. 
C. Value of Expository Teaching. 
The chief value of the expository method of teaching 
lies in its time-saving nature. It is much easier for 
the teacher to tell the pupils than for them to find it 
themselves, when they might have to hunt a long time 
for the information if they secured it first hand. Some 
pupils learn things very readily in this way. It is eco- 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
    
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 111 
nomical to tell them, because they remember in detail. 
They seem to be ear-minded, as it were, and learn 
more quickly when things are told to them than in any 
other way. Because of these pupils, exposition is a 
method that most teachers can use successfully at 
times. 
D. Defects of Expository Teaching. 
As might be inferred from the preceding paragraph, 
there are pupils for whom the method is little suited. 
The thought movement is so rapid that-they have 
great difficulty in following it. The result is that they 
soon lose the thread of things and, although they seem 
to comprehend what is said, they remember little of it. 
All has been lost in the multiplicity of details. There 
is not enough repetition to insure the permanence of 
the facts in their minds. 
Further, exposition is suited only for some kinds of 
subject-matter. Where the facts and details are rich 
and new, it is very serviceable; but where the pupils 
possess most of the materials, or can secure them read- 
ily, other methods are better adapted to bringing out 
relationships. In reality, the field in which the ex- 
pository lesson can be used in all its elaborate details 
is very limited. It can be used frequently, however, 
interspersed with some of the other teaching methods, 
especially the question-and-answer recitation. Exposi- 
tion is by nature restricted to the informational phases 
of subject-matter.
-P-A-G-E-120
  
112 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
SUMMARY 
The task of imparting information is the most im- 
portant one that confronts the teacher. It may be 
provided for by merely keeping the information before 
the pupils in book or other form. Better results are 
secured, however, by the use of one of the psychologi- 
cal methods. 
The type-study method is the simplest. Its out- 
comes are rich and varied concepts. It is a method 
that can be utilized by most teachers, and it lends 
itself to the presentation of subjects containing a rich 
content. Its success depends upon the selection of 
good types and the use of abundant supplementary 
materials. 
The expository form of teaching is a more complex 
method of imparting information, which can be used 
at times in public-school work. The lesson should plan 
for a good approach, one that really prepares the pupils 
for what is to be presented. The presentation should 
connect up the new materials with what the pupils 
already know. It should use ideas that are intelligible 
to both pupils and teacher, and should emphasize both 
interpretation and explanation. Analogies, stories, and 
illustrations should be used freely to clarify the teach- 
er’s words. The presentation proper should end in a 
summary. The expository lesson is not complete until 
the pupils have applied the information given. This

qY 
teaching process is very economical when the informa=— 
tion can be presented easily by the teacher but can be 
obtained by the pupils only after much work.

  CHAPTER VII 
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE (Continued) 
Ill. InpvctTIion. 
Tue third method of imparting knowledge is what 
is known as induction, or the development lesson. 
This form of teaching was the first form to be studied 
carefully. It was the outgrowth of the early attempts 
to apply psychology to the teaching process, which 
Herbart and his followers sponsored. Because of this 
origin, it is often known as the Herbartian develop- 
ment lesson. It may properly be called a lesson, for it 
is one of the most extensive and complete systems of 
teaching technique that is employed by experts. 
A. When to Use the Inductive Lesson. 
The inductive method of teaching is in order in those 
lessons where simple and important generalizations 
are to be imparted. It has been found that such are 
remembered best if developed. In this connection it 
might be said that other kinds of generalizations, when 
important enough to be taught at all, should be pre- 
sented by exposition. The inductive lesson presup- 
poses a fund of facts at the command of the pupils, 
either in their memory storehouses or where they can 
115
-P-A-G-E-124
116 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
find them easily during the study lesson. The outcome 
of this teaching exercise is a generalization. ‘This 
generalization may be in the form of a concept, a law, 
a principle, or a rule. Whenever a teacher wishes to 
be sure that she has taught one of these effectively, 
the best method is the inductive lesson. This lesson 
is an extremely logical one, and its complete success 
requires the clearest organization possible. 
B. Technique of the Inductive Lesson. 
The technique of this lesson has been worked out 
very carefully by the Herbartians. Although there are 
several versions of the lesson to be found in current 
works on teaching technique, in the main the lesson 
may be considered to have five steps. These steps may 
be covered in one class period, though the lesson lends 
itself very well to the arrangement wherein one or more 
study periods come between some of the steps. Conse- 
quently, the real inductive lesson need not be limited 
by the temporal restrictions of the class period. 
1. Preparation.—The first step in the inductive 
lesson is the preparation. This serves much the same 
purpose as the approach of the expository lesson, and 
the suggestions presented in that discussion apply here. 
In this step the teacher endeavors to recall to the pupils 
such information on the subject as they may have. 
This information is handled in such a manner as to 
lead up to the statement of the aim. This is nothing 
but the question raised. by the preparation, It can be 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
    IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 117 
answered best by the generalization that is developed 
by the lesson. In this phase of the lesson no attempt 
is made to introduce new material. 
2. Presentation.—This step is the one in which the 
pupils collect the raw material that is to furnish the 
facts for the lesson. With the aim set in the prepara- 
tion as a stimulus, the pupils sometimes may be set to 
work gathering the materials in the study lesson. In 
such a case this step begins with an assignment. At 
other times the materials may be contributed by dif- 
ferent class members during the recitation. Where the 
generalization is to be formed from facts already a part 
of the mental equipment of the class, the complete 
set of facts need not be possessed by any one member 
of the class, but different ones may each make his own 
contribution. In this case the time will be spent in 
bringing out the different related items of information 
that the various pupils possess. This step is complete 
when all the facts are before the class. 
The most important caution that the teacher must 
observe, in the presentation, is to make sure that 
enough facts or cases have been observed to make the 
lesson clear. When the materials are new but very 
simple, a few cases will suffice. On the other hand, 
when the things observed are complicated and diverse, 
many more instances will be needed. There must be 
enough examples of the phenomenon in all of its 
aspects to make the later generalization sound. In 
some cases the essential common characteristics are
-P-A-G-E-126
    118 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
obscured by irrelevant details. When this is true, it is 
necessary for the teacher to select carefully in order to 
secure the best and clearest examples possible. Much 
inductive teaching fails in the presentation because 
teachers select things for consideration that confuse 
instead of instruct. . 
3. Comparison and abstraction.—Inductive think- 
ing usually is defined as reasoning from the particular 
tothe general. Related items a, b, c, and d are exam- 
ined, and the common quality z is found to be present 
in all of them. The third step in the inductive lesson 
is devoted to this comparison. The various items have 
been presented to the class, and now they must be 
scrutinized carefully to see whether they have any 
common qualities. Under the guidance of the teacher, 
the class thought is molded until all of the pupils have 
the fundamental abstractions. This phase is a very 
difficult one for the teacher to direct, because it de- 
mands the guidance of clear thinking under the stren- 
uous conditions of the class-room. Unless they are 
drawn in a perfectly logical manner, the comparisons 
tend to confuse the pupils, instead of helping them. 
This is true, especially, if the teacher does too much of 
the thinking herself and forces the abstraction. The 
pupils must be allowed to do most of the work. 
4. Generalization—When the pupils have made 
the comparisons and abstractions, they are ready to put 
the results of their thinking into a finished form. All 
that remains to be done is to put the generalization
-P-A-G-E-127
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 119 
into words. Teachers often are in too much of a hurry 
when they come to this step. The pupils should be 
allowed and encouraged to give their own wordings. 
At times a very satisfactory plan is to allow several 
pupils to suggest phrasings for the generalization. 
They may be asked to defend the words they use, 
when there is a disagreement, and out of the resulting 
discussion a final wording may be selected. Only when 
the class has exhausted its interest in the situation, has 
the meaning, and is not making progress, should the 
teacher offer a finished phrasing for the generalization. 
This may be compared then with the wording as found 
in text-books or other authoritative sources. 
5. Application.—Logically, the inductive lesson has 
not been completed until the generalization has been 
applied by the pupils. Where the generalization is a 
rule, such as some of the rules of arithmetic and of the 
other mathematical studies, the application is carried 
out in general on a set of problems. This step, how- 
ever, is deductive reasoning, and the details of the 
application can be given better under the topic de- 
duction. 
C. Strength of Inductive Teaching. 
The inductive lesson is psychologically correct. The 
different steps have taken their form as the result of a 
careful analysis of the way in which people learn gen- 
eral ideas. This fact makes it certain that, if a teacher 
uses the steps as they should be used, and secures
-P-A-G-E-128
120 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
careful, connected thinking, there will be no doubt 
about the result. It is a sure method of teaching. Its 
certainty is due to the fact that it stresses every phase 
of the material and brings out the fundamental rela- 
tions. There is so much repetition with variation that 
interest is maintained easily in most cases. 
D. Defects and Shortcomings of Inductive Teaching. 
Inductive teaching demands such clear thinking that 
many teachers are unable to master its technique. 
Logic teachers always find a certain percentage of their 
classes that does not use words and ideas clearly enough 
to think well. It is no disgrace for them, any more 
than it is a disgrace to have difficulty with trigonom- 
etry or Greek. Teachers who do not think clearly, 
however, seldom succeed with the inductive lesson. In 
addition to requiring clear thinking, the inductive les- 
son is so lengthy that it tires the undisciplined. Teach- 
ers can not be trained in its use as readily as in some 
of the other teaching forms, but most teachers can 
' master the technique if they are given enough practice 
in it under supervision. 
Inductive teaching is very valuable when a simple 
but important generalization must be taught. There 
are many school-room lessons that are not important 
enough, or that are too difficult, for development les- 
sons. It has been the common practice of ardent Her- 
bartians to try to teach everything by this one teaching 
method, and to draw conclusions from every unit of 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 121 
subject-matter. Such enthusiasm is hardly warranted 
by the results secured. 
IV. DeEpvucrTIon. 
Deduction is usually considered to be the opposite 
of induction. Itis reasoning from general principles to 
particulars. A large amount of our teaching attempts 
to get pupils to see the implication of the laws, princi- 
ples, and rules that they may have learned. As con- 
trasted with induction, deduction is a much simpler 
and shorter process. It is an unusual situation when 
a bit of deductive teaching lasts longer than a few 
minutes. From the point of view of length, the de- 
ductive teaching exercise can hardly be considered a 
real lesson. It is too brief. 
A. Types of Deductive Teaching. 
There may be said to be two types of deductive 
teaching—the anticipatory and the explanatory. The 
first is used to forecast the details that will be found in 
a particular situation. It can be illustrated by the 
way astronomers discovered the planet Neptune. They 
had discovered Uranus, and were studying its path 
according to the principles of planetary movement. 
At one place Uranus did not do exactly what they 
expected it to do. After a time two celebrated astron- 
omers set to work and performed some unusual experi- 
mental calculations. The result was, they decided that 
“if a heavenly body of a certain size was in a certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
position in the sky, it would exert enough attraction 
on Uranus to draw it out of its course in just the man- 
ner that was puzzling them.” When they had finished 
their calculations, they requested another astronomer, 
who had a powerful telescope, to point his instrument 
at a particular spot in the sky on a certain autumn 
night. He did so, and when he looked he saw Neptune. 
Its discovery had been anticipated by deductive reason- 
ing. This method, when applied to teaching, gives the 
anticipatory type of deductive teaching. 
The explanatory type is very similar to the pre- 
ceding. The main difference is in the point of view. 
As a rule, this second type is said to be present when 
the facts at hand are connected up with the principles 
that interpret them. This is the form that is used so 
often in the class-room when the pupils are asked for 
“the principle that explains” this or that phenomenon. 
B. Technique of Deductive Teaching. 
1. Data.—Usually there are said to be four steps in 
deductive teaching. The first step consists in present- 
- ing or recalling the facts that are to be considered. 
Thus, if the lesson is to be on a group of miscellaneous 
problems in factoring in algebra, this step is completed 
when the problem has been examined carefully and its 
exact character recognized. When the pupils know 
exactly what the problem is that is to be solved, they 
are ready for the next step. 
2. Principles.—The second step consists in the selec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 123 
tion of the principles that apply to the particular data 
in hand. If, in the illustration just given, the data 
consisted of 36a* — 36a7c + 9c?, the pupils might be 
expected in this step to decide what principle applied. 
After they had examined the quantity carefully, it 
would be in order to say that it was the square of the 
difference of two quantities. In much deductive 
teaching the task is not so simple. Pupils propose 
principles that will not apply and that are only partly 
related to the data in question. The principles offered 
must be suggested by the data in the case, within a 
reasonable limit of error. 
3. Inference.—When the data and principles are at 
hand, the next step is the inference. The pupils are 
led to say what is implied by the facts. Thus, to con- 
tinue our illustration, they would be expected to say 
that the two factors were (6a? — 3c) (6a? — 3c). The 
inference is really a guess; but, as long as it is con- 
trolled by the data and principles, it is all right. It is 
only when guessing is wild, not related to the facts in 
the case and not verified, that it is to be condemned. 
When pupils make inferences that are not related to — 
the problem under consideration, they should be led 
to justify their suggestions. This is much better than 
the practice of those teachers who never give the pupils 
an opportunity to test their suggestions. 
4. Verification.—The final step of the deductive 
lesson is the verification. Some means must be em- 
ployed to find out whether the inference is valid.
-P-A-G-E-132
  124. THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
There is no value in making continual inferences if it 
is not known that they rest on the proper assumptions. 
Deductive thinking assumes that certain principles 
apply in particular instances. In reality this may not 
be true. It may be a false assumption. In that case 
the inference that was made is not valid. Pupils con- 
tinually are making many assumptions that are not 
true, and they need to have a means for checking up. 
The keen thinker is discriminating when it comes to 
selecting classes and making inferences and can foresee 
results. This ability is found in its best form where 
real native capacity has received the proper training. 
Since training is so important, it is well to recognize 
that it is helped materially by adequate means for 
verification. Inference may be verified by going to 
some authentic source—the teacher, a book, or Nature 
herself. 
C. Advantages of Deductive Teaching. 
This teaching method is one of the most valuable 
that a teacher can use. It is a much simpler piece of 
work than the inductive method, and frequently is 
required by the ordinary subject-matter. This teach- 
ing method is important because it results in very 
desirable outcomes. It introduces the factor of organi- 
zation and makes meaningful principles that have been 
mastered already. In the case of the anticipatory 
form, a very good motive is furnished for seeking for 
evidence that will support the inferences made. In 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
      
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 125 
this way the puzzle instinct is aroused, which of course 
is a very valuable aid. Whenever education can use 
this instinct, very effective work is secured. When a 
problem has been attacked deductively, the organiza- | 
tion and thought given to it open the way for further 
study on the same basis. The deductive lesson is the 
final step in the complete inductive lesson. It is not 
necessary, however, that every principle or rule be 
developed or taught through the inductive lesson be- 
fore it is used deductively. Often the pupils can secure 
their principles from books or from expository teach- 
ing. These generalizations can be used just as well as 
those that have been imparted through the inductive 
method. 
D. Limitations of Deductive Teaching. 
This teaching method is not so limited in its field of 
application as the inductive. It, however, is restricted 
to informational topics, and is of no value in securing 
emotional or drill outcomes. Further, there are some 
pupils who are poorly qualified by nature to profit from 
deductive teaching. The deductive method of teach- 
ing is criticized often because it encourages guessing. 
As has been stated already, guessing is to be con- 
demned only when it neglects important limiting fac- 
tors. One of the most important tasks confronting the 
teacher is the encouragement of controlled inferences 
or guesses. This can be done only by giving the pupils 
practice in this kind of work.
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
V. ReEF.LEcTIvVE THINKING. 
The ordinary text-book recitation does not lend itself 
to any of the formal methods of teaching in pure form. 
Many of the points of the different methods can be 
used as they fit into the varying situations. The re- 
sourceful teacher makes use of combinations of various 
teaching methods, and thus secures the best results. 
In many recitations a little exposition combined with 
a little deduction and, perhaps, an occasional piece of 
inductive teaching bring about a rapid assimilation of 
knowledge by the class. Such a recitation can well be 
called reflective thinking. It should not entirely sup- 
plant the pure methods, however. 
A. Opportunities for Using Reflective Thinking. 
The ordinary class-work presents many opportuni- 
ties for reflective thinking on the part of the pupils. 
Those who are able may do independent thinking 
frequently. Others may follow the reasoning of the 
teacher, of other pupils, or of the book. It often is 
thought that this second-hand thinking is of little 
value; but pupils who are not original enough to think 
out things for themselves can usually see the logic of 
things that have been explained. Children who are 
very capable often do not possess all of the informa- 
tion needed for independent work. Such pupils can 
comprehend complicated things when they are pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 127 
sented clearly by others, and thus acquire information 
at the same time that they receive explanations. 
The organization of lesson facts is another of the 
fields for reflective thinking. Facts are presented fre- 
quently in a more or less obscure manner by the text- 
book or original sources. Pupils who put these in well 
ordered systems of thought are doing good work of this 
nature. Excellent training along this line is given if 
the pupils make outlines of the materials of text-books 
or of other sources of knowledge. The topical recita- 
tion also gives an opportunity for a kind of reflective 
thinking and organization. 
A still further opportunity for reflective thinking is ° 
furnished by «problem-solving. Problems abound in 
every subject that has a knowledge content. Teachers 
are in the habit of thinking about arithmetic, algebra, 
or physics examples whenever problems are mentioned, 
and often do not recognize that there are problems in 
history and geography. Whenever the teacher can ask 
“Why?” or “How?” she can present a problem. “Why 
should patriotic citizens pay taxes cheerfully?” “Why 
does the water from this well make people sick?” 
“How can a person invest his money best?” These 
are problems that stimulate reflective thinking. 
B. Steps in Reflective Thinking. 
1. Defining the task or problem.—The first step 
in teaching any kind of reflective thinking consists in 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
128 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
deciding what the obstacle is. The teacher can not 
expect pupils to start in with the same ability along 
this line that they will manifest later, after training. 
Practice is very helpful. Then, too, there are marked 
individual differences between pupils in the ability to 
define the problem. There are some who never see the 
problem in the situation. These are never disturbed by 
most of the vicissitudes of life, and are the ones who go 
on in uneventful lives in the midst of turmoil. The 
teacher can never hope to do anything with them, and 
they never accomplish anything that is original in 
reflective thinking. If they must take algebra or 
geometry, they copy type problems and memorize ex- 
planations. In some cases this inability to see the 
problem is restricted to one kind of subject-matter: 
geometry, physics, or history. 
A second class of pupils recognizes that a problem 
exists in the situation, but is not able to discern it 
clearly. These are the “scatter-brains” who are just as 
likely to carry the feather-bed downstairs and to throw 
the looking-glass out of the window as not. They 
never see the problem in all its aspects, and are nearly 
certain to overlook limiting factors. The third class is 
composed of those who see the various phases of the 
problem in all of their implications. They always 
know what to do, within reasonable limits, and enjoy 
this work of reflective thinking very much. The 
teacher can do much with the last two classes. Class 
two never can be expected to do much original work, 
   
-P-A-G-E-137
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 129 
but will secure very good imitative results. Pupils of 
this type profit much from the explanations of others, 
and often make a very good display of reasoning ability 
that seems, but is not, original. The three classes 
shade into one another, and many graduations may be 
found, so that a teacher should not expect to be able 
to classify her pupils exactly into these three groups. 
2. Methods of attack or solution.—After the pupils 
have decided what the obstacle is, the next step, in well 
directed reflective thinking, is to find the solution of the 
difficulty. Every solution demands information, but 
teachers sometimes make the mistake of expecting 
children to be proficient before they have the necessary 
information. On the other hand, the use of informa- 
tion in reflective thinking is one of the best ways to 
secure its thorough mastery. For this reason, it often 
proves of value to introduce reflective thinking as soon 
as the minimum information has been acquired. It is 
not necessary that all the related facts be provided in 
definite form by the minds of the children. It may be 
much more effective, from the point of view of the 
teaching process, if the facts are entirely new. All that 
is needed is a good knowledge of the sources where the 
information may be secured. Thus, one may be forced 
to do very good reflective thinking if he stains his coat 
and hunts through books on the subject until he learns 
how to renovate his garment. 
When pupils have the information or know where to 
get it, they must be taught the subtleties of reflective
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
thinking. The first thing they must learn to do well is 
to analyze conditions. The situation must be picked 
to pieces carefully, so that every factor involved is 
recognized. For example, if pupils are working origi- 
nals in geometry, they must learn to fulfil all the condi- 
tions of the exercise before trying for a solution. After 
they know just what is wanted, the next step is the 
making of suggestions or hypotheses. Here the teacher 
may be of much service. The pupils may be stimu- 
lated to make suggestions and evaluate them. Merely 
suggesting solutions is not enough. They must be 
taught to foresee the consequences of their hypotheses, 
so as to learn to reject the useless ones. When well 
trained, bright pupils become so expert that they fre- 
quently will reject wrong hypotheses before they have 
them half formulated; they will subconsciously evalu- 
ate them, as it were. The only suggestions that are 
really formulated are those that have a bearing on the 
problem. 
Pupils should be taught to be systematic in their 
search for definite hypotheses. One of the greatest 
aids along this line is a record of the various alterna- 
tives as they are raised and rejected. Above every- 
thing, pupils should learn to maintain the attitude of 
suspended judgment. They should not assume that 
they have a correct solution until they have good rea- 
sons for thinking so. 
3. Verification.—The final step in reflective thinking 
is verification. The solutions may be checked by gath- 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
    IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 131 
ering further evidence, by testing out further infer- 
ences, by going to authorities, and in other ways. As 
far as possible, the pupils should learn to use the 
various checks. Mathematics usually lends itself to 
checks, and hence is much more definite than some of 
the other studies. Answers are provided in most math- 
ematics text-books, and the pupils find them a ready 
means for verifying their work. Sometimes teachers 
find that some of the pupils seem to have no other 
objective than to secure the answers. They would 
remedy this situation by doing away with all answer- 
books, thus depriving students of the benefit of a 
ready means for the verification of their work. In most 
cases where this is done, the pupils secure answer-books 
secretly, and the teacher works on, thinking that the 
class is studying without answers. It would be better 
not to encourage such duplicity by forbidding the 
answer edition of the text. The situation could be 
handled better by the occasional introduction of prob- 
lems from outside sources, the answers to which could 
not be secured readily without solving the problems. 
This would emphasize the role of the answer as a check 
and not as an end. 
The need of a means for verifying the work to keep 
up pupil interest is shown by the translation work of 
foreign-language courses. One reason why translating 
from the mother tongue to the foreign is so much 
harder than translating from the foreign to the mother 
tongue is that the latter offers a ready check in com-
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
mon usage, while only an educated native of the foreign 
land can really check the former. Few language 
teachers are qualified to do it well. 
There is little value for pupils in doing reflective 
thinking unless they verify their work constantly. The 
skilled teacher trains pupils to use all possible methods 
of doing this. An important part of the training in 
reflective thinking consists in learning’ how to tell 
whether.one’s work is correct. 
C. Value of Reflective Thinking. 
Reflective thinking is what a person must do when- 
ever he solves the problems of life. This makes it 
important that pupils be trained in this activity. The 
average uneducated individual is very inefficient in 
dealing with many of life’s problems, and finds it hard 
to concentrate on activities that demand continuous 
attention. Although a course of training is not an 
absolute guaranty that a person will be able to do 
good thinking, there seems little doubt that it is help- 
ful along that line. 
From the point of view of the class-work, the ques- 
tion of time is important whenever the value of re- 
flective thinking is under consideration. It takes much 
time to do effective work. This fact must be kept in 
mind when pupils are asked to do it. They must not 
be hurried, or the results will be superficial. It is a 
well known psychological fact that people must have 
tume to think. When they are hurried, the nervous 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
  IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 133 
system sometimes refuses to work and the mind be- 
comes a blank. Further, hurry tends to make many 
people forget quickly. From the point of view of 
reflective thinking, the values obtained by it may not 
be worth the time it takes to think out a particular 
problem. The results might be secured more efficiently 
in some other way. 
For example, pupils are sometimes asked to do tasks 
that are long drawn out and yield nothing new, such 
as a physics problem the writer once was asked to solve 
in the laboratory. On this occasion each member of 
the class was given an aluminum cylinder to find the 
specific gravity. Crude instruments prevented accu- 
rate work and the entire process was too lengthy for 
much interest. Even though the class members worked 
as carefully as possible, it was difficult to secure values 
accurate enough to satisfy the teacher. All of the time 
every one knew that the book said the specific gravity 
of aluminum was 2.6. It would be much better if such 
pedantic exercises were eliminated. Every task in 
reflective thinking ought to be viewed in the light of 
the question, “Is this the most economical way to se- 
cure these results?” 
Another factor that determines how much value is to 
be obtained from exercises in reflective thinking is 
individual differences. The bright pupils usually take 
the lead in group thinking. The result is that the slow 
ones often gain but little from the work that is done. 
They get lost in the intricacies of mental activity. The
-P-A-G-E-142
  134 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
same is true when the teacher does most of the think- 
ing. This need not be the case if the classes are graded 
into sections according to ability. 
METHOD AND MENTAL ACTIVITY 
The teaching method that is used, not the subject- 
matter, determines the mental activity of the pupils. 
This is interesting and significant, for it makes the 
teaching art possible and very important. Upon the 
mental activity in which the pupils take part depends 
the sort of outcomes secured. The simple informa- 
tional outcomes, such as facts, concepts, and some 
generalizations, may be imparted by type studies and 
exposition. The most important of the generalizations, 
when not too difficult, should be taught by induction. 
The other informational outcomes, such as modes of 
thought and mental attitudes, are the result of more 
extended periods of teaching, and the teacher may 
expect the varied tasks of reflective thinking to be 
most helpful. It takes time and much experimentation 
for a teacher to learn which of the methods is best 
suited to her individual peculiarities. This implies 
that a teacher ought not to use any method blindly, 
but ought to select the method in the light of past 
experience and of the outcomes desired. 
SUMMARY 
The third method of imparting knowledge is the 
complex Herbartian inductive development lesson. 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE 135 1S 
This should be used when the teacher wishes to impafta. é 
simple but important generalizations. It usually is 
considered to have the five steps, (1) preparation, 
(2) presentation, (3) comparison and abstraction, (4) 
generalization, and (5) application. The inductive 
lesson is a very good procedure for imparting certain 
kinds of knowledge, but it is such an exacting piece of 
work mentally that many teachers do not learn to use 
it well. 
The fourth method of imparting knowledge is de- 
duction. There are. two types, the anticipatory and 
the explanatory. The lesson has the four steps, (1) 
data, (2) principles, (3) inference, and (4) verification. 
Deductive teaching has many advantages, the most 
important of which is the organization and interpreta- 
tion of knowledge. 
The fifth method of imparting knowledge is the 
informal work known as reflective thinking. The ordi- 
nary school subject-matter offers many opportunities 
for this work. The steps in reflective thinking may be 
considered to be three: (1) defining the task or prob- 
lem; (2) methods of attack or solution; and (3) verifi- 
cation. Reflective thinking is very valuable, but it 
must be directed properly to realize its greatest possi- 
bilities. 
The methods of instruction, and not the subject- 
matter alone, determine the mental activity that will 
take place in the class-room.

  CHAPTER VIII 
FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 
I. Dritt Work. 
A. Two Kinds of Drill Outcomes. 
In addition to the work required to secure the 
knowledge outcomes, discussed in the two preceding 
chapters, the teacher’s efforts must result in a number 
of drill outcomes. Children are not educated when 
their mental efforts result in comprehension in terms 
of their own language alone. They must learn some of 
the choice bits of the past in the conventional language 
of society, and they must do some things just as they 
should be done. These drill outcomes may be divided 
into two classes—habits and id rote a associations. Habits 
are more sought after by the teacher in the lower 
grades than by the teacher in the high school; yet 
there are many habits that must be formed even among 
the older pupils. 
The teacher of a foreign language must connect the 
various printed symbols with the proper habitual, 
vocal responses, if anything is done orally. The ath- 
letic coach has a major portion of his work in the field 
of habit formation. “Good form” usually means little 
except the functioning of right habits. The baseball- 
player must learn to catch in the right way, to bat so 
139

a
-P-A-G-E-148
‘ 140 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
as to meet the ball where it can be sent shooting out 
across the diamond, and to throw accurately. The 
sprinter must hold his arms in definite positions and 
breathe so that his lungs will be of most service. Each 
basketball-, football-, and tennis-player must learn 
many things that are primarily habits. The teacher 
of stenography and typewriting spends much time in 
similar work, as does the drawing teacher, the music 
teacher, and the manual training teacher. 
The other class of drill outcomes also is demanded 
frequently. Pupils are asked to learn the States of the 
United States and their capitals, the names and dates 
of the Presidents of our country, the words of songs 
and poetry gems. Each of these tasks requires them 
to remember words or ideas in a definite, fixed order. 
These are often called rote associations. Between this 
class and the habits already discussed are other things 
partaking of some of the characteristics of both, such 
as the use of punctuation-marks and correct spelling. 
The important thing, however, is not whether the 
outcome is a habit or a rote association. It makes 
little difference which it is, from the point of view of 
the teaching process. \The important thing to be rec- 
ognized is that these outcomes are to be secured only 
by repetition. The nervous system must be made to 
respond in the desired way so frequently that it re- 
sponds of its own accord upon the presentation -of the 
proper stimulus. In other words, the thing must be 
made automatic before it can be used effectively. 
   
-P-A-G-E-149
  FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 14l 
Much time is wasted in the school-room because 
things that ought to be done without much thought 
demand all of the pupils’ attention. We recognize how 
foolish it would be for the baseball pitcher to have to 
decide just what the exact arm, wrist, and finger move- 
ments are that will result in a curve across the outside 
corner of the plate six inches above the batter’s knees; 
but it is not always recognized that it would save time 
to learn the rules of punctuation, the meanings of im- 
portant words, or the verb forms of a conjugation. 
Whenever anything that has an exact form is needed 
frequently, it is better to store it away in the nervous 
system of the pupils than to allow them to look it up 
each time it is required. Both habits and memories 
are retained by the nervous system, so it is proper to 
speak of all drill outcomes in this way. 
B. Two Phases of the Problem. 
The problem of securing drill outcomes presents 
itself from two points of view—that of the group or 
class, and that of the individual pupil. Many of the 
drill outcomes can be secured by exercises in the class 
period. This is the kind of work most teachers do. At 
times, however, the pupils must be asked to drill by 
themselves, individually. They do this in their study 
periods. This phase of the problem is, in reality, a 
part of the larger problem of teaching pupils how to 
study. Many of the suggestions relative to habit for- 
mation and memorizing are relevant to both class and 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
142 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
individual work. Therefore, the teacher’s task will be 
considered from the two points of view. 
C. The First Question. 
The first question a teacher must answer before 
beginning a class drill exercise is, “Is this drill mate- 
rial?” Is the point under consideration of so much 
importance that it will be economical of time and 
energy to work for a drill outeome? \This is a very 
important question, as many who went to school in the 
past can testify. Even where the teacher used good 
methods, pupils were sometimes called upon to mem- 
orize many things of little value, as the counties and 
county-seats of their home States, the names of the 
townships in their county, numerous selections from 
prose and poetry, history dates, and articles from the 
Constitution of the United States. On the other hand, 
many habits were neglected entirely, as enunciation, 
writing forms, and physical postures and carriage. It 
was easy to set memory tasks to keep the pupils busy, 
but exacting to train in the other things; so teachers 
emphasized the one and neglected the other: To do 
good teaching there must be discrimination on the part 
of the teacher. | 
D. Technique of the Drill Lesson. fea. 
1. Motivation.—The first step in a drill lesson, or 
exercise, is the motivation. -This consists in getting 
the class to see that it-is necessary to form the ene 
2 
   
-P-A-G-E-151
  FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 148 
to memorize the facts under consideration, Usually it 
is sufficient if the pupils see that they need the lesson’s 
objective and are shown that they do not have it. 
“Pupils, as a rule, are very keen to recognize whether or 
not they know a thing or can do it. Therefore, moti- 
vation can consist mainly in pointing out the need for 
the point in question. A very good way to do this is to 
provide situations in the class-work that require the 
use of the particular habit or rote association. A few 
of the class may have it, and the others will see how 
they can save time by mastering it too. Even if none 
of the class have it, the procedure is about the same. 
Thus, if a teacher of French wishes to motivate the 
memorizing of the verb forms, the pupils might be led 
to use them by looking them up each time at first. 
Then, when the class had discovered the need for a 
frequent use of these, the teacher could point out that 
it would save time to memorize the lists. 
For the teacher to fail to motivate is for the pupils 
to go at the drill work half-heartedly and without 
interest. The teacher must bring attention and in- 
terest on the part of the pupils to the task. Drill work 
without these is futile. ‘Teachers themselves have 
been known to repeat a series of facts often enough for 
a number of pupils to memorize them, only to find that 
- they themselves could not reproduce them from mem- 
ory. The pupils repeated in attention and with in- 
terest, while the teachers gave little attention or 
interest to the work. This step in the drill lesson is 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 THE -TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
very brief in most cases, frequently occupying but a 
few minutes. 
2. Focalization.—The next step in the drill exercise 
is called focalization. Odd as it may seem, teachers 
sometimes tell pupils to drill when they have never 
told them upon what to drill. They must be told what, 
to learn. The point of the exercise must stand out so 
that no one can miss it. When this is not the case, a 
part of the class will do nothing, and their excuse will - 
be that they did not know what to do. This focaliza- 
tion should be positive, not negative. This implies 
that the form shown for focalization should be the 
correct one. Teachers sometimes try to remedy bad 
habits by calling attention to them. It is better to 
substitute the right ones. At times a teacher may do 
much damage by presenting the wrong form or by call- 
ing attention to the wrong habit. Pupils who are 
neutral, so to speak, become confused and learn the 
wrong form instead of the right one. Teachers of 
foreign languages, dramatics, and public speaking, as 
well as of other subjects, sometimes tell a pupil, “That 
is not correct; try it again,” and do not show him the 
correct form. Instead, teachers should allow the pupils 
to imitate them after they have shown what should be 
done. Imitation is an important aid in securing a 
correct start in drill work, and should not be neglected. 
3. Repetition—The third step is the memorizing or 
habit-forming process itself, repetition. This step may 
be made most effective by the observance of several 
   
-P-A-G-E-153
  FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 145 
rules. First, there should be a.correct-start. The first 
form to affect the nervous system should be the one 
that is to be retained. Thus, if a person is learning 
French pronunciation, he should start with the correct 
sounds; or, if he is memorizing a poem, he should get 
the exact wording from the first. Further, the point to 
be drilled upon should be presented as vividly as pos- 
sible. This does not mean, however, that the final 
attainment in speed and accuracy should be sought 
immediately. Accuracy should come first and speed 
later. Another rule is that there must be no exceptions 
until the habit or memory is perfectly automatized. 
Even then, exceptions tend to undo what has been 
accomplished. 
To get the best results, the pupil must put as much 
energy and attention into the repetitions as possible. 
Anything done in a languid, listless manner makes only 
a slight impression on the nervous system and results 
in almost nothing. A person can not learn things 
readily when attention is divided. After the correct 
habit or rote association has been established firmly 
comes the time to speed up the process. Teachers of 
typewriting use this last principle by insisting that 
their students sacrifice speed for accuracy. They say 
that if a person is accurate speed will take care of 
itself, that a person unconsciously speeds up when he 
has formed the correct habits, and that he can not go 
rapidly until he has done so.  
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
E. Devices that Aid. 
There are many devices that are of service in se- 
curing the best results from drill work. They are of 
value because they help through motivation and in- 
creased attention and interest. As arule, they lead to 
a quickening of the repetitions until the most favor- 
able conditions are realized. It has been found that 
the repetitions should be so fast that there is no chance 
for attention to wander, but not so rapid as to confuse. 
There is a tendency on the part of most teachers to 
overwork a device as soon as they find out that it is of 
value, ,This-should be avoided if possible. 
on thither “fhmulation has been used very much 
in the past to speed up drill work. In fact, it has been 
greatly over-emphasized. Emulation is striving to 
attain the same standard that some one else has at- 
tained previously. Pupils were taught to strive for 
marks and positions of distinction. The spelling class 
had its system of head-marks, the drawing class its 
exhibition of good work, and so on throughout the 
curriculum. Emulation, however, often is overdone, 
and tends to become the end and not the means to the 
end. 
2. Competition.—Resembling the device of emula- 
tion in some of its aspects is competition. Pupils are 
spurred on to excel one another in different tasks. This 
results in a very intense rivalry, with much interest 
and attention. Thus, a class may be asked to see who      
   
-P-A-G-E-155
    FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 147 
can learn a poem or form a habit first. The greatest 
drawback to the use of competition is individual dif- 
ferences. As soon as the class members have com- 
-peted with one another a few times, some will discover 
that they are always at the head of the list, and others 
will find themselves usually at the bottom. It makes 
little difference how hard some strive: they can never 
reach the head position. They lose interest. 
This loss of interest may be prevented somewhat by 
recording the rank order of each member of the class 
every time. This procedure results in putting each 
into competition with those of nearly the same ability. 
A still better method is to put each in competition with 
his own record. A system of recording should be used 
that will permit each to keep his own score from day to 
day. Every normal pupil will try to improve, because 
the results of his efforts are shown objectively. Any 
method that records results objectively is valuable. 
3. Time limit—A time limit may be used very 
effectively. The class may be asked to see how much 
they can do in three minutes, where the work is com- 
posed of small units. Where the units are large enough 
to require a third of a minute or more each, and are all 
of about the same difficulty, the pupils can strive to 
see how quickly they can master each unit. If there is 
a large clock with a second-hand in the room, the 
pupils can record their own time. Where a clock is not 
available, a stop-watch or ordinary watch, held by the 
teacher, can be used. Another plan is that wherein the
-P-A-G-E-156
Ps 
Se 
& 148 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
teacher indicates the time on the blackboard, thus 
enabling the pupils to time themselves. 
4. Rhythm.—Modern teachers do not make. use of 
rhythm in drilling as much as teachers did years ago. 
It is very effective. Where the materials can be put 
into rime of some sort, pupils memorize easily. 
Nearly every one is familiar with the jingle about the 
days of the months, “Thirty days hath September,” 
etc., and knows of its efficacy. In the past pupils sang 
history dates, geography facts, and other prosaic things, 
and learned them readily. The device is just as useful 
now. In the field of habit formation rhythm and 
music are very helpful. The graphophone has been 
used to teach writing, a stirring march selection in- 
ducing rhythmic movements that resulted in rapid 
progress. 
5. Variation.—Variation itself may be called a de- 
vice. It is much better to use several forms of activity 
for three minutes each than to use one form for ten or 
fifteen minutes. Thus, it would be better to spend 
three minutes in oral drill, three minutes in written, 
and three minutes at the blackboard, than to drill nine 
minutes on any single form. Through variety, interest 
and attention may be maintained. n 
6. Concert work.—This device is not so valuable, 
because the pupils soon lose interest in it. When used 
but a few minutes at a time, and only occasionally, it 
may be effective. In foreign-language study concert 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 149 
oral work may help train the ear for correct sounds. 
When used frequently, without other devices to check 
the results, however, pupils may learn things incor- 
rectly through carelessness and inaccuracy. 
7. Problems.—Another device which is employed 
frequently to emphasize principles and facts in what 
are sometimes called drill exercises, is the use of prob- 
lems. These employ the puzzle instinct. They empha- 
size discrimination more than repetition, however, so it 
easily might be questioned whether they are really 
drill exercises. Much drill results from the incidental 
repetition that they demand, and this justifies their 
consideration as a drill service. 
8. Approval.—The approval of parents, teachers, 
and fellow pupils may act as an incentive to induce 
some pupils to apply themselves to drill exercises. 
This is where the granting of marks to the children, 
which they may carry home with them, proves of 
value. Marks may be over-emphasized, however, and 
their bestowal often leads to a false idea of their im- 
portance and significance. | 
g. Stern necessity.—In spite of all that a teacher 
may do to inspire and lead pupils to apply themselves, 
there are boys and girls who sometimes do not respond. 
For these there seems to be no other device remaining 
but stern necessity. They must be made to repeat the 
movements or thoughts so that they learn the essen- 
tials. Oftentimes such pupils are slow mentally, and a
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
little personal work may be more effective than arbi- 
trary pressure. The brilliant but lazy boy or girl must 
be put under the pressure of stern necessity, however. 
F. Psychology of Drill Work. 
1. Length of drill exercises—Psychologists have 
shown that the best results are secured from brief drill 
exercises. Where the teacher has worked out a good 
plan for securing speedy repetitions, the drills should 
never last longer than five minutes at one time. If a 
longer time is used, a new device should be resorted to 
at the end of a few minutes. Where the drill is listless, 
a longer time is needed to secure results; but a listless 
drill is always a time-waster. Short drill exercises, car- 
ried out systematically day after day, are what produce 
results. In some subjects, e.g., music, typewriting, or 
stenography, very long periods of several hours are the 
common practice; but comparatively little progress is 
made in these when the pupil has become tired. These 
long periods, however, must be used to accustom the 
workers to business conditions. An individual learns 
most rapidly when he is rested, because practice, when 
he is tired, does not make much impression on the 
nerve-cells. 
2. Pleasure aids habit formation and memorizing. 
—Another thing the psychologists have taught us 
about learning is that pleasure is an aid to drill work. 
If the pupils are kept in a happy, enthusiastic frame 
of mind, they can do much more work with a given 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
    FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 1561 
expenditure of energy than if they dislike the drill 
exercises. This is one of the reasons for the popular 
demand that the teacher interest her pupils. This 
interest should not be the end of the teacher’s efforts, 
but merely the means to make the work pleasant. 
3. Zeal and concentration necessary.—Drill work 
is most effective if attacked zealously and with every 
ounce of energy concentrated upon the task. This is a 
point that is of great value in individual work. Those 
who have studied the formation of complicated habits, 
e.g., learning to typewrite or to speak a foreign lan- 
guage, usually say that it is only successful repetitions 
that count. These are the ones that are carried out 
under the conditions of the greatest zeal and concen- 
tration of attention. When the repetitions have been 
carried to the point of fatigue, enthusiasm is lacking 
and little progress is made. 
4. Forms of the drill exercise.—The form of the 
material in the drill exercise should be, as nearly as 
possible, the same as the form in which it is to be used _ 
later. It has been found that it is most economical to 
practise the activity itself rather than formal exercises. 
Pupils learn to spell best by writing their spelling 
lessons when they study them. Music teachers put 
their pupils at work on simple songs and pieces con- 
taining melodies rather than upon forma: exercises. 
Teachers of typewriting give connected discourse for 
practice as soon as possible. All this implies that 
separate training in the elements of a habit seems to 
™,  
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
be of little value in general. This is because many 
nerve connections are formed, in the repetitions of 
formal exercises, that must be broken later when the 
real work is undertaken. It is harder, often, to undo 
the results of drill than it was to secure them in the 
first place. 
5. Trial and error indispensable.—Another point 
that has come from the scientific study of habit forma- 
tion is that trial and error are indispensable. It seems 
to be impossible to foresee all of the minute details, 
and many of them have to be hit upon by accident. 
Just because everything is not known about the way 
a particular habit is formed is no insurmountable ob- 
stacle to its formation. Repetitions sometimes get a 
wrong direction, but they finally result in the desired 
goal being attained if persisted in intelligently. 
6. Verbal directions a help.—Although trial and 
error are necessary, carefully worked out verbal direc- _ 
tions are of much value. This is where the teacher 
may be of service. A teacher should be able to tell 
pupils how the important things should be done. 
Where she can not tell, she should at least be able to 
show the way to do the things needed. This require- 
ment places a burden upon the shoulders of the teacher 
under the present condition of imperfect knowledge of 
the psychology of school subjects, but it also opens up 
a large field for useful service. In time there probably 
will be accurately worked out studies of the various 
drill tasks. Until then a teacher must do her best 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
      
FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 153 
under the circumstances and use what knowledge she 
possesses. 
7. Understanding an aid to memorizing.—When a 
pupil understands a thing, he has taken a big step 
toward memorizing it. The simplest way to remember 
things is to understand them. This fact has been — 
emphasized much by some educators, even to the 
extent of overlooking the necessity of anything other 
than understanding as the basis of learning by heart. 
As far as possible, things should be remembered by 
understanding them; but, as soon as comprehension 
fails, it becomes necessary to resort to repetition. 
There are some people who seem to be aided but little 
by the analysis of poems, and they must rely upon 
frequent repetitions to become able to reproduce them 
exactly. 
8. Memorizing by wholes.—It has been shown by 
careful studies that it requires fewer repetitions to 
memorize anything as a whole than to memorize it 
piecemeal. When pupils memorize things undirected, 
they usually repeat a part until they know it, and then 
take the next part. Thus, in learning a poem of two 
stanzas of eight lines each, they would learn the first 
two or three lines of the first stanza; then they would 
take a few more lines, and then a few more, learning 
the first stanza in several parts. It would save time if 
they could be induced to go through both stanzas from 
beginning to end at each repetition. Memorizing by 
wholes is economical, but it is discouraging to young 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  154 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
pupils. They do not see any results after several repe- 
titions, and this disheartens them. The results become 
apparent all at once. With older pupils it is of more 
value. Whenever the material to be memorized con- 
tains parts of unusual difficulty, the whole method 
should be supplemented by a few extra repetitions of 
these difficult parts. 
Pupils should be encouraged to try the whole method 
of memorizing, and then should be allowed to use the 
part method if the other is too discouraging. In mem- 
orizing, they should be taught to try to recall what 
they have repeated after each repetition. If they can 
not recall a part, they should look at the original for a 
little prompting and then try to remember the rest 
without any help. Every time they have to stop, they 
should go to the original for assistance. The selection 
to be memorized should be gone over completely each 
time. Teaching pupils to memorize is mainly an 
individual teaching problem. Little can be done 
through group work. 
g. The learning curve.—The learning curve of com- 
plicated things, such as telegraphy, typewriting, and 
foreign-language facility, has been studied with much 
care. If the progress of an individual is recorded from 
day to day and this progress is shown graphically, it 
has been found that it is much the same for different 
learning activities. This graphic representation is 
called the learning curve. It shows striking similari- 
ties for different things. In general, a student makes 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 155 
rapid progress when he starts the learning. Soon he 
slows up and seems to make no progress for a time. If 
he persists in his practice in spite of this discouraging 
experience, he will be rewarded by progress a little 
later. It may be that he will meet two or more of 
these periods of little progress. These have been called 
plateaus. 
Plateaus have been studied carefully, and their 
nature and causes are significant for teachers of drill 
work. They are times of discouragement and loss of 
interest. Before an individual will make any improve- 
ment, he must be lifted out of the slough of despon- 
dency into which he has sunk. He must attack the 
thing with renewed interest. Further, it has been 
found that in learning some things plateaus are inevi- 
table. They seem to be times when the learning has 
become more complex, and the simple things have been 
nearly all learned independently but not in combina- 
tions. Further progress is dependent upon the forma- 
tion of the combinations. | 
Thus, in learning telegraphy, a person learns the 
alphabet first. Then he learns to catch the series of 
sounds that form words. Before much progress can be 
made in receiving connected discourse over the wire, 
however, a person must learn many things that do not 
show objectively, as distinguishing the interval be- 
tween words and series of familiar words. This ac- 
counts for some of the lack of progress. Thus it seems 
as if the formation of complex habits were dependent
-P-A-G-E-164
    156 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
upon the previous formation of many simple habits. 
One unfamiliar word in a sentence often prevents the 
student operator from catching any of the sentence or 
phrase. 
Because plateaus seem inevitable, it does not follow 
that they can not be shortened. It has been found that 
the condition of fatigue is responsible for unduly long 
periods of no progress. This can be remedied by in- 
ducing the person who is practising to rest when at 
such a point. A brief vacation often results in renewed 
enthusiasm and rapid progress. Any device that will 
result in increased interest and added vim in the prac- 
tice will help to shorten the plateau. 
Most persons who give up the learning of anything 
are said to stop when they are in the discouragement 
of the plateau. To a certain extent, a person’s ability 
to learn is tested by his ability to stick to the practice 
even when discouraged. The fact that such periods of 
no apparent progress are the rule should help the 
teacher to encourage pupils who are in that stage. A 
very effective way to encourage them is to vary the 
work until the upward movement starts again, and 
then they will find the interest incidental to progress 
of great help. 
1o. Age and drill exercises.—Another thing that 
the psychological laboratory has shown is that the best 
drill age is just before a person has reached his ma- 
turity. Those who are in their college courses learn 
more readily, that is, with fewer repetitions, than those 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
  FORMING HABITS AND ROTE ASSOCIATIONS 157 
of the elementary or high-school age. This is true 
under the conditions of the laboratory. It is probable, 
however, that the experience of educators, who have 
always thought that the years between eight and 
twelve are the best for drill work, is founded upon a 
difference between the class-room and the conditions 
of the psychological laboratory. The laboratory fur- 
nishes a motive for grown-up subjects that is not so 
effective with the younger ones. In any case, the 
intermediate grades will remain probably the time for 
drill work, because many things are needed later that 
can and often must be learned at this time. The later 
years are the time when pupils are able to assimilate 
information better and they find drill work more 
tedious. The experience of the laboratory, however, 
shows that, if drill lessons are needed in later years, 
there is no reason why the deficiency may not be 
supplied. 
SUMMARY 
There are two classes of drill outcomes—habits and 
rote associations. The problem of securing these has 
two phases, the class and the individual. The first 
question to be decided concerns the importance of the 
task of the lesson. The technique of the drill lesson 
includes the three steps, (1) motivation, (2) focaliza- 
tion, and (3) repetition. The work is aided by the 
employment of a number of devices: e. g., emulation,
-P-A-G-E-166

  158 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
competition, time limit, rhythm, variation, concert 
work, problems, and approval. The psychological 
aspects of drill work include the following: the length 
of drill exercises; the role of pleasure, zeal, and con- 
centration; the necessity of trial and error; the use of 
verbal directions; the place of understanding as an aid 
4_~ to memorizing; and the interpretations of the learning - 
curve, with its plateaus.

  CHAPTER IX 
DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 
In the past, teachers have neglected this phase of 
education. Although the feeling side of life has been 
recognized by psychologists for a long time, the peda- 
gogy of the emotions has not received much attention. 
This is because it is a difficult problem, which has been 
attacked with an imperfect knowledge of the way 
feelings are imparted. 
There is a great need for the right sort of emotional 
development. Human beings naturally respond to 
emotional situations that are largely of the comic- 
supplement type. It takes teaching to get them to feel 
the more delicate appeals of good music, painting, 
sculpture, and other art. The average American is 
undeveloped along these lines. To many European 
visitors the nation seems crude. Most of our cities are 
positively ugly, with no attempts at beauty. Many of 
our homes are built without any pretense of art, or 
with such attempts as violate every rule of esthetics. 
Houses stand out of bare yards without the simplest 
attempt at landscape work. On ‘he inside, walls, fur- 
niture, and decorations betray the same lack of sensi- 
tiveness to the beautiful. Nowhere is this more in 
160 f 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 161 
evidence than in wealthy rural districts where auto- 
mobiles, live stock, and other evidences of wealth are 
found in abundance. One is not surprised to find 
poverty-stricken communities deficient in such things, 
but when people of means present the same deficiency, 
it can be explained only by the lack of proper develop- 
ment. Under present-day conditions of high-speed 
production and the short working day, men.and women 
need to be taught how to employ their leisure time. 
That they do not know how to do so now is shown by 
the kinds of entertainment they seek—those built 
mainly upon crude humor and sex suggestion. Really 
beautiful moving-pictures, drama, music, and litera- 
ture, beautiful because they arouse the better emo- 
tional responses, have a hard time, securing only a 
meager support. That this condition is only the result 
of lack of training is shown by the fact that some com- 
munities have developed a keen appreciation of the 
beautiful. In general, our schools have not accom- 
plished much because the teachers have not understood 
the principles of emotional training, and not because 
such training is impossible. 
PSYCHOLOGY OF EMOTIONAL TEACHING 
The mistake that teachers often make is that they 
try to communicate emotional attitudes by means of 
words. Words are the symbols of ideas and not of 
feelings. The word beautiful is a concept, and can
-P-A-G-E-170
    162 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
help only after much teaching, when it will prepare a 
person for the arousal of an emotion. It will not of 
itself arouse the emotion. When a teacher tells a class, 
“This is a beautiful painting,” showing a masterpiece, 
but little response will result if the teacher does not 
put any feeling into the words. Moreover, if a paint- 
ing is hung on the wall, and the words, “This is a 
beautiful painting,” are placed alongside of it, but 
little effect will be made on the pupils when they see it 
for the first time, unless they respond instinctively to 
the beautiful. However, if the teacher speaks the 
words ‘in a tone that shows the emotion she feels, the 
pupils will be more likely to respond. In other words, 
emotions are radiated. If one person expresses an 
emotion naturally, others respond, because most people 
are,born sensitive to the feelings of others. The panic 
caused by the cry of “Fire!” in a crowd is caused more 
by the emotional tone than by the actual word. As the 
cry is repeated, the emotional tone of fright becomes 
more and more intense, until the mob is seething with 
emotion. This condition can be quieted, just as quickly 
as it arose, by the calm, unemotional bearing of any one 
who can catch the attention of the mob. When ap- 
plied to emotional teaching, this means that the 
teacher must feel the emotion that the words imply, if 
the teaching is to be successful. The language of the 
emotions is but partly evolved. Actors study it be- 
cause it is at the basis of their success. If teachers are 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 163 
to do the highest grade of emotional teaching, they 
must become actors to a certain extent. 
There are marked differences between individuals in 
the development of this ability to respond to emotional 
radiation. Some are unaffected by situations that set 
others a-quiver with excitement. Others develop this 
ability to respond much later than their fellows. Fur- 
ther, there are reasons for believing that this esthetic 
sense does not manifest itself to any great extent until 
the age of adolescence. If this be true, little can be 
done below the junior high school in training the emo- 
tions, except as such work may give the intellectual 
basis for later emotional development. The fact that 
the earlier years are years of imitation, however, makes 
it desirable to begin this teaching early in the school, 
lest golden opportunities be overlooked. 
INFORMATION AS THE BASIS OF EMOTIONAL 
TEACHING 
The preceding section has shown that the real psy- 
chological basis of emotional teaching is the radiation 
of feeling attitudes from teacher to pupils. This does 
not mean that emotions can exist of themselves. On 
the contrary, every emotion must have an intellectual 
basis. It must be the feeling aroused by something 
seen, heard, touched, tasted, smelled, or remembered. 
Thus, there is a very definite basis of information for 
the emotion. Before a person can be well trained 
emotionally he must be educated intellectually. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
    164 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
mistake that teachers in the past made was in assum- 
ing that they had completed their task when they had 
given the necessary ideas. Ideas must be given, but 
these must have the propor emotional coloring if they 
are to function. Many people acquire the right ideas, 
but these never carry over into conduct, because they 
have no emotional background. They mean nothing as 
far as real life is concerned. 
In the school-room it is necessary for the teacher to 
furnish the facts, but this can be overdone. Where 
the knowledge side is over-emphasized the emotional is 
neglected, and the results are fatal to appreciation and 
emotional enjoyment. This caution is applicable espe- 
cially to the teaching of literature, for here the teacher 
is tempted to analyze in detail, thinking that is the way 
to do it.. Specialists in most fields are inclined to do 
this. With pupils who are untrained in a subject, only 
the most elementary analysis is of value, be it music, 
painting, or literature. 
SCOPE OF EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
The field for the development of the emotions is as 
broad as life is many-sided. It includes that which is 
beautiful or valuable because society has developed the 
idea that it is, as well as that which stirs up the feel- 
ings naturally. From one point of view the entire 
field might be included in the mental reactions denoted 
by the term appreciation, taking in what appeals to 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 165 
people as pleasure or enjoyment also. The point of 
view taken here is that emotional development must 
provide for both phases, appreciation and enjoyment, 
although no quarrel is sought with the individual who 
wants to make the term appreciation broad enough 
to include all of these life phases. 
I. . APPRECIATION. 
A. Esthetic. 
There are two kinds of appreciation—esthetic and 
social. Esthetic appreciation includes those activities 
that usually are classified as art. Music, painting, 
drawing, and the various forms of decoration and 
adornment will be recognized immediately as being 
among those implied. In addition, literature on its art 
side, poetry, and the drama must be included. In fact, 
anything in which good taste, beauty, lofty conception, 
and inspirng themes are involved is material for 
esthetic appreciation. The problem of esthetic appre- 
ciation is not only active, but is also passive. A person 
must be trained to produce esthetic things as well as to 
recognize and prize them. Further, many esthetic 
forms may be found already provided by nature, and 
the pupils must learn to value them. 
B. Social. 
The second kind of appreciation has to do more with 
the values and needs of human beings. Every man 
must live in the society of his fellows if he is not to be 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
166 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
a hermit. Before he is ready to live thus, he must 
learn to govern his conduct by the standards of right 
that his fellows have adopted. People in different 
parts of the world have different customs and stand- 
ards, and these must be viewed with sympathy and 
understanding when one travels. Men have done, and 
are doing, many things from lofty motives; hence, a 
study of history, geography, and world events offers a 
very good opportunity for social appreciation. Esthetic 
appreciation is concerned with the finished product. 
Men must live and work and serve, and the man or 
woman to whom this means nothing is one-sided. 
Il. ENsoyMeEnrtT. 
In addition to the activities of life that pupils should 
appreciate, there are other phases that merely are to 
be enjoyed. Participation in them gives pleasure, but 
it is hardly of a refined enough quality to deserve the 
term appreciation. Thus, a person enjoys a game of 
tennis, croquet, or golf, but hardly appreciates them. 
He enjoys his newspaper, his magazine, his trip to the 
opera or to the vaudeville. Because of this use of 
words in the ordinary sense, it seems that teachers need 
to prepare people to enjoy as well as to appreciate. 
Appreciation always involves something of an intellec- 
tual nature, a discrimination of values and the like, 
while enjoyment is more sensual and personal. It 
brings pleasure. To be sure, people ought to learn to 
enjoy that which is also of a quality worthy of appre-
-P-A-G-E-175
  DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 167 
ciation. In that case the two terms would be two 
ways of looking at the same thing. 
TECHNIQUE OF THE LESSON THAT DEVELOPS 
THE EMOTIONS 
The technique of the lesson in appreciation has been 
worked out very carefully in the field of literature by 
an English educator, F. H. Hayward.:’ His work has 
been done so well that it would take a genius to make 
any real improvement on it. Although he applies it to 
but one field, the technique can be modified to fit other 
kinds of material. Its principles of thorough prepara- 
tion and careful organization can be used in many 
other teaching situations. The outline of the lesson 
will be presented as given by Hayward, with but few 
modifications other than condensation. 
I. PRELIMINARY STAGES. 
The lesson is designed primarily for the teaching of 
a choice bit of poetry or prose, especially poetry. 
Much stress is laid upon thorough preparation on the 
part of both class and teacher, and this preparation ie 
a more complete one than teachers usually make. This 
lesson is called the “red-letter lesson,” from the analogy 
to: books that print important facts in red letters. This 
means that the appreciation lesson should be one that 
comes on rare occasions and that is looked forward to 
for a long time.

  168 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
| 
A. Negative Preparation. 
1. Anticipatory interest.—In keeping with the idea 
that this lesson is to be a red-letter lesson, one long to 
be remembered, the teacher should begin by arousing 
interest along the expected line many days before the 
lesson is to be given. This can be done by dropping 
occasional hints about the “most interesting lesson” 
that is to come a little later. Whenever related mate- 
rials are met, the pupils should be told of the fact. If 
necessary, other lessons should be shifted around and 
manipulated to prepare for this one. The object of it 
all is to build up a background of interest that will 
make the lesson a big event. This anticipatory in- 
terest is provided best by incidental methods, which 
are planned deliberately but which seem accidental to 
the pupils. 
2. Overcoming distractions.—The distractions that 
may be present are likely to be mainly the result of 
intellectual difficulties. The teacher should remove as 
many otf these as possible before the day for the lesson 
arrives. Such distractions may be the result of un- 
familiar words or ideas used by the author. These 
should be studied in lessons preceding the big event, 
and the class thus prepared for them. Distractions 
are furnished also by any material that contains a 
technique that is too much for some of the pupils, such 
as the difficulty of reading the notation in music. In 
general, distractions should be avoided by omitting the 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
    DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 169 
class-work that contains them. Where this is not 
done, they should be prepared before the lesson. Any 
drill work that is needed should come in the prelim- 
inary preparation, because the lesson in appreciation 
is no time for drill activities. 
B. Positive or Constructive Preparation. 
The second phase of far-ahead preparation consists 
of the work that gives an apperceptive background for 
the lesson. Ideas must be grouped together to make 
esthetic pleasure possible. As has been shown earlier 
in this chapter, the emotional must have an intellectual 
basis. The teacher may provide this by giving mean- 
ings to many things that will contribute actively to 
the appreciation. Metaphors must be picked to pieces 
carefully and explained, if there is any chance that they 
will fail because of unfamiliarity, and any words that 
have unusual or lost meanings must have the particular 
meanings of the selection presented. Where it is neces- 
sary to give a background of meaning to a metaphor, 
the teacher must use good judgment in selecting the 
time to do this. In some cases, it may be well to do 
it on the day preceding the lesson. In others, this 
would be the worst thing that could be done, for the 
unfamiliar meanings might make such strong impres- 
sions on the pupils that the result would be disastrous 
to the pleasure that should be derived. Throughout 
the positive preparation it is a good plan to make use 
of every item of information that the pupils have.
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
Further, the element of familiarity should be employed 
wherever possible. 
II. Tuer Lesson PRopEr. 
A. Immediate Preparation. 
The negative and positive preparation have been 
completed, and now the hour of appreciation has been 
definitely set. Before it comes the teacher must pre- 
pare herself for the task in hand. Her immediate 
preparation consists in becoming imbued with the 
thing to be enjoyed, until nothing else seems quite so 
important. It means getting in the right mood. A 
part of the immediate preparation, too, must put the 
pupils in the right mood. This may be done, just 
before the thing to be appreciated is presented, by a 
brief statement in simple words of the lesson aim. 
The teacher must be careful, however, not to over- 
stimulate the imagination of the pupils, or the thing 
presented may prove a disappointment. 
B. The Hour of Appreciation. 
The principle of the first impression is the one that 
should control this phase of the lesson. The first im- 
pression is always a privileged one. Therefore, the 
teacher must make the first impression of the poem, 
or other selection, one that is the best possible. It 
must be a total impression. This implies, also, that 
the pupils should not have studied the selection before 
the hour of appreciation. Further, the teacher, not 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  
  DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 171 
the pupil, is the one to do the reading at this time, 
because she is best qualified. In presenting a poem of 
rhythmic beauty the rhythm should be preserved. 
Oftentimes teachers, trained by experts in public speak- 
ing, are inclined to disregard the metric structure of 
poetry and to render it after the style of prose. This 
tendency is bitterly condemned by those who produce 
poetry. Poets read their own productions with the 
meter intensified, even to the point of what often is 
called a singsong style. Teachers should at least pre- 
serve this pleasurable element, and should not read in 
a colloquial style that destroys all beauty. The poet 
has used various devices to secure his ends: sounds, 
ideas, and combinations of rhythm. The teacher 
should recognize this, and make as much use of them 
as possible. 
C. Esthetic Discussion. 
The next step after the presentation has been com- 
pleted is the esthetic discussion. The teacher should 
endeavor to get the pupils to express their ideas of 
what is beautiful in what has just been presented. 
How and why the selection is beautiful, should be the 
theme. When the main points of beauty have been 
noted so clearly that even those who enjoyed the work 
the least can know why and how to enjoy it, the teacher 
should present the selection again. This second pre- 
sentation should be received more favorably than the 
first, because of the aid given by the esthetic discussion.
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
D. Intellectual Discussion. 
The second presentation should be followed by that 
phase of the lesson which teachers so often put first in 
teaching poetry—the intellectual discussion. This is 
the time for a careful analysis of meanings and figures 
of speech. With the background of appreciation that 
has been given, this can be done without so much 
danger of causing the pupils to get a distaste for the 
work. The teacher must not go too much into detail, 
however, or the pupils may lose sight of the goal. The 
object is to provide the means for a keener appreciation 
of the selection, and not mainly to manipulate ideas 
in reflective thinking. At the close of the intellectual 
discussion comes the time for the reading of the poem 
by the pupils, provided it can be done in such a way 
that it does not spoil the general impression. All of 
the class who are capable may be called upon to try 
to give the selection. 
EK. Reproduction. 
The final step in the lesson in appreciation is the 
reproduction, or the “learning by heart.” If the sub- 
ject of the lesson has been worthy and has been well 
presented, there will be but little difficulty experienced 
in raising the enthusiasm of the class to the point 
where they will want to memorize a part of the poem. 
It is well to allow the class to have something to say 
about what they will memorize. Teachers often ask 
too much from the pupils along this line, requiring
-P-A-G-E-181
    DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 173 
them to devote too much of their time to this work. 
This over-emphasis has a tendency to create a dislike 
for such work. It is a safe rule to say that only the 
real gems of the piece should be memorized. If this 
criterion is set up, few pupils will look upon the work 
with anything but the greatest of pleasure. Tact in 
the way in which pupils are asked to commit things 
to memory is needed very greatly on the part of 
teachers. | 
III. Vauur or Tus Lesson. 
The lesson in appreciation, as worked out by Hay- 
ward, is one of the most effective that educators have 
devised. The writer has seen teachers follow its pro- 
cedure and secure excellent results. There is nothing 
very complicated about it from an intellectual point of 
view, and any person who can really appreciate beauty 
can be successful with it. Of course, a teacher in whom 
things of beauty do not awake responsive chords can 
not expect to do much in teaching others to respond 
to the esthetic. Hayward’s technique is applicable 
primarily to the field of literature, though excellent 
work can be done with pictures, statuary, and other art 
subjects. A few modifications are needed for subject- 
matter other than literature, but these are not difficult 
for the resourceful teacher to make. When it comes 
to teaching social appreciation, the problem is very 
different, because it is hard to present such things in 
any other way than through ideas colored with feeling.
-P-A-G-E-182
  174 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
The most difficult phase of the entire task is to secure 
responses on the part of the pupils. 
OTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR DEVELOPING THE 
EMOTIONS 
The lengthy technique of the lesson in appreciation 
is not applicable to many of the phases of the problem 
of emotional development. It is too long and too 
complex for minor emotional outcomes. Many of its 
principles, which are the principles previously laid 
down, are of use in other situations, however. Because 
a chance for emotional development is apparently 
rather insignificant is no reason for the teacher to 
neglect it entirely. Teachers should be content to 
grasp the minor opportunities when the major ones 
are lacking. If they remember that feeling attitudes 
are radiated, teachers will always be ready to do what 
can be done in any situation. Teaching pupils to seek 
the right kinds of enjoyment must be mainly of this 
incidental nature. 
The materials that are to be enjoyed or appreciated 
must be adapted to the pupils for whom they are in- 
tended. The mistake is often made of giving grown- 
up literature to children and then expecting them to 
respond. The same is true of many other things. 
Pupils must be trained gradually to realize pleasure 
out of the highest class of materials. Those teachers 
who now can enjoy the best music, poetry, and drama 
were once in the primary class themselves. It is im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
    DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 175 
portant that as many pupils as possible be elevated to 
the better grades of enjoyment, because otherwise, as 
grown-ups, they will be inclined to seek unelevating 
pleasures. Illustrations of this tendency are all too 
common under present-day conditions of living in most 
American communities. 
The fact that it is desirable to cultivate high stand- 
ards of appreciation and enjoyment does not imply 
that only the most technical is of much value. On 
the contrary, simple appreciation and enjoyment are 
quite worth while. The technical pleasure that a 
highly trained musician gets out of the performance 
of a virtuoso is more intellectual than emotional. It 
is really pseudo-esthetic. The highest class of music 
should have beauty of rhythm and feeling instead of 
difficulty of performance as its criterion of worth for 
the average individual. Skilled musicians may set up 
other standards for themselves, but these are not for 
the mass of humanity. The same pseudo-esthetic 
appreciation is evinced in the fabulous prices paid by 
the wealthy for the best paintings of dead artists. As 
long as the artist lived and could produce more works 
of a similar character, his paintings brought but a 
nominal return, while, after his death, the same pro- 
ductions sold for fortunes. His death did not add 
anything to the beauty of the picture, but it gave the 
‘ owner a monopoly. Its emotional value, as repre- 
sented by the purchase price, is mainly pseudo-esthetic. 
Teaching in enjoyment and appreciation should in-
-P-A-G-E-184
176 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
clude many phases of the work. Pupils should be 
taught to enjoy reading dramatic masterpieces, attend- 
ing, and taking part in them. In music, the training 
in listening is as important as the training in pro- 
ducing. To secure these outcomes, a school needs a 
room with a stage, where the pupils may attend and 
produce plays. It also needs one or more kinds 
of mechanical instruments that will make possible 
development through hearing good music. A teacher 
should not show disgust at pupils who enjoy the simple 
things more than the technical as a rule, but instead 
should compromise at times, so that the pupils may 
be led, through her example, to get pleasure out of 
better things. 
The greatest problem in some phases of enjoyment, 
such as athletics, recreational reading, and pupil enter- 
prises, is to secure a participation in them on the part 
of all of the pupils. In athletics, in many schools, few 
pupils take any part other than in the passive enjoy- 
ment of the onlooker. As far as expedient, participa- 
tion in sports and games should involve every one, 
both boys and girls. The same is true of student 
societies, school papers, and similar pupil organizations. 
The tendency is for a few pupils to do nearly every- 
thing under the ordinary management of student 
affairs. This condition is undesirable. It can be 
remedied by any organization, such as intramural ath- - 
letics, that will secure the active participation of 
nearly every member.

  DEVELOPING THE EMOTIONS 177 
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF EMOTIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT 
As might be inferred from the nature of enjoyment 
and appreciation, the effects of development along 
these lines are cumulative. The efforts of the super- 
visor of music who devotes her time to the pupils of 
a school system do not seem to amount to much. Yet, 
if such a community is compared with a similar one 
in which this teaching is omitted, the difference will 
be marked. One community in the Central West has 
had the good fortune for several years to be under the 
influence of a music supervisor who realized the possi- 
bilities of the position. The result was the develop- 
ment of choirs, choruses, and orchestras in the schools. 
When these pupils finished school, they formed inde- 
pendent musical organizations, and the work continued. 
A few years later it was a common occurrence on Sun- 
day for one of the local celebrities, who had never been 
outside the town for training, to give a musical recital 
at one of the city churches. These recitals were of a 
really high grade. What a contrast this is to many 
of our communities, where it is difficult to find any one 
qualified to play a musical instrument for the singing 
at public gatherings! What has been done to cultivate 
enjoyment and appreciation in music can be done in 
other fields. Persistent effort counts for much in time. 
SUMMARY 
There is a great need for the better development and 
| guidance of the emotions of people in general. This is 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
evidenced by the crude esthetic tastes and unelevating 
methods of enjoyment of most people. The most im- 
portant reason for this condition is that teachers have 
not understood the psychology of the emotional out- 
comes of teaching. Emotional outcomes can not be 
imparted, like ideas, but they must be radiated. Indi- 
vidual differences of people to susceptibility to emo- 
tional radiation are a complicating factor. Although 
emotions can not be imparted, they have an intellectual 
basis in ideas. ‘Too many ideas and not enough feeling 
are detrimental. Emotional-development outcomes in- 
clude esthetic and social appreciation and simple 
enjoyment. 
~* Hayward has given us the detailed technique of the 
lesson in appreciation. This lesson emphasizes the 
principle of the first impression as the fundamental 
one in this work. The lesson contains seven steps: 
(1) negative preparation, (2) positive preparation, 
(3) immediate preparation, (4) presentation, (5) 
esthetic discussion, (6) intellectual discussion, and (7) 
reproduction. This lesson is one of the most effective 
that has been devised. Intellectually it is not ex- 
tremely difficult, and most teachers can use it success- 
fully. 
Teachers should seize every opportunity for develop- 
ing and training the emotions, even though some of 
them are insignificant. The materials that are used 
for the work must be graded to suit the capacities of 
the pupils. In leading pupils to enjoy the best, the |

teacher should not confuse the intellectual appreciation 
of unusual technique with real emotional enjoyment 
and appreciation. The effects of emotional teaching 
and training are cumulative, and the results of effort 
devoted to this outcome may not appear at first, but 
will show later.

  CHAPTER X 
THE REVIEW EXERCISE 
NATURE OF 
THE term, review, means in reality a new view. A 
new view implies that old material must be presented 
in a new way—in a way that will bring out points of 
relationship that were not discovered in the ordinary 
day-by-day study. The review is not a mere repetition 
of work that has been gone over already. This con- 
ception of the exercise is a new one to many teachers, 
but it is the one which will form the basis of the work 
of this chapter. 
I, ORGANIZATION OF MATERIALS. 
The first function of the review exercise is the or- 
ganization of the subject-matter that has been taught 
to the pupils in the preceding lessons. When pre- 
sented in the regular routine of daily work, facts are 
new, and the interpretations that the teacher gives 
often are forgotten. The review gives an opportunity 
for another effort to interpret and bring out relations. 
This is a very important service. A famous teacher of 
the past has been quoted as saying that there were but 
three laws that should guide the successful teacher: 
182
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE REVIEW EXERCISE 183 
first, review; second, review; and third, review. The 
review is perhaps not quite so important as that, but 
it is a very valuable aid to the securing of good teaching 
results. 
II. REPETITION. 
The second function of the review is that it gives 
additional repetitions to many things that would not 
be retained otherwise. In the regular lessons facts often 
are considered but once. This is not enough to make 
sure that the pupils will remember them. The second 
presentation of the facts that this exercise gives will 
be enough many times to fix them. 
III. Recatt or Otp KNOWLEDGE IN PREPARATION 
FoR NEw. 
The review is used also to recall knowledge that the 
pupils have, in preparation for the presentation of new 
material. This use is recognized and applied in the 
expository and inductive lessons. Where the exercise 
is used systematically for this purpose, it is less 
necessary to devote lengthy periods to formal review 
exercises. 
IV. To Discover WHETHER A Topic Has Bren 
CoMPLETED. 
Another function that the review fulfils is to check 
up to see whether the topic under consideration has 
been covered. It is difficult for a teacher to keep from
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 THE TEACHER’S TECHNIQUE 
overlooking some of the minor points of a topic under 
ordinary class-room conditions. If a few minutes are 
devoted to a review at the close of the work, there is 
little danger that anything important will be omitted. 
This function of the exercise is recognized in planning 
the presentation of the expository lesson. 
V. To Trst. 
The review also is a very good device for testing the 
results of teaching. The oral review, in which the 
teacher learns what the pupils remember of the pre- 
ceding lessons, reveals clearly how well the work has 
been done. Teachers should not let this function 
become so important in their eyes, however, that they 
neglect the teaching objective of the review. The test- 
ing function should be mainly incidental. The cap- 
stone of a thorough review is the written examination. 
More will be said about this in Chapter XIV. 
WHEN TO REVIEW 
A review is in order at the end of each unit of 
subject-matter. Small units require short exercises, 
and large units lengthy ones. Each break in the syl- 
labus should be the occasion for a pause and a résumé 
of the work covered. It is not necessary, however, that 
every class period have its time for review. To say 
that the first five minutes of every period should be 
devoted to this exercise is to formalize the work and 
make it lacking in variety and flexibility. On the 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
THE REVIEW EXERCISE 185 
other hand, it is easy for a teacher to get so interested 
in the rapid progress made from day to day that, as 
a result, she may dislike to pause for such a seemingly 
prosaic and time-consuming thing as the review. It 
is safe to say that few teachers go back over the work 
covered as much as they really should. Many public- 
school teachers and most college teachers expect the 
reviewing that is done to be engineered by the pupils 
themselves in their study work. This practice neglects 
one of the greatest opportunities for real teaching that 
the work offers. More can be done, which is tangible, 
in a half-hour’s exercise of this kind than in two or 
three times as long a period devoted to the usual class- 
work. 
HOW TO REVIEW 
The review should be so conducted as to bring 
together revelant facts of the pupil’s experience. 
Teachers sometimes feel called upon to review because | 
they know that teaching theory advocates it; yet they 
are unable to recognize relevant facts and fail in con- 
ducting this exercise. The questions used should be 
such that they provoke thought. The old facts must 
be seen in a new light. There is no real place for new 
facts in the review. A teacher may find it desirable 
to digress from the regular line of thought and bring 
in new facts, but she is not reviewing when she does it. 
The first essential of a good review is careful thinking 
along lines relevant to the topic of the lesson. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
    186 THE TEACHER'S TECHNIQUE 
The teacher may use many devices in the review 
exercise. Since the review is concerned primarily with 
the knowledge side of the teaching process, outlines are 
very serviceable. Topical outlines may be prepared, 
as noted under the section on the topical recitation, 
and given to the pupils to guide them in the lesson 
preparation. When they come to the recitation, they 
can use the outlines as the core of the work. Ques- 
tions that demand thought and the organization of 
lesson facts may be given to the pupils also to help 
them study. These questions may be very compre- 
hensive, enough so to justify the teacher at times even 
in promising that the examination questions will be 
taken from them. In general, the teacher ought not 
to limit herself by such a promise, unless experience 
shows that the questions are comprehensive and that 
the motivation resulting from them counterbalances 
the loss of initiative on the teacher’s part. Topics may 
take the place of questions in the pupil assignment. 
A good review recitation can not be secured unless 
the pupils have spent some time in preparation for it. 
When they have done everything that they can in the 
way of organizing and interpreting the materials, the 
teacher is ready to do the most effective work. This 
implies that it is best to have a study period precede 
the review. To ask the pupils to review without giving 
them questions, outlines, or topics as guides, is to cause 
them to repeat the work in much the same manner 
as it was studied at first. Outlines, partly made out, 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
THE REVIEW EXERCISE 187 
to be completed by the pupils in their study, furnish 
most interesting material for the class discussion. A 
second essential, then, is careful pupil preparation. 
Problems are another device for reviewing. All 
problems are not necessarily of such a nature as to 
aid in securing a new view of old material, but many 
may be formed to secure that end. They are valuable 
in that they always bring the puzzle instinct to the aid 
of education. Comparison lessons, in which two topics 
that have been considered separately are compared and 
contrasted, are also valuable in review work. These 
comparison lessons are very helpful in the content 
subjects. 
IMPORTANCE OF THE REVIEW 
The review is a highly important class-room exercise 
because it frequently adds the finishing touches to a 
teacher’s work. The work from day to day has con- 
cerned itself necessarily with detailed facts, “bits of 
information.” Things are seen, as it were, with the 
high powers of the microscope in the daily work, and 
the pupils do not realize what they are really like. The 
review puts things in their natural order, looks at them 
with the naked eye, as it were. This work connects 
up the items of information that were presented from 
day to day and makes them meaningful. 
The review also serves as a means for checking up 
the teacher’s work. A teacher labors in order that 
pupils may be benefited. When they come to a review

STATE SUPERINTENDENTS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
The office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction was

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
NasHvi.ie, Tenn., December 15, 1903. 
To His Excellency, Jas. B. Frazier, Governor of Tennessee : 
In compliance with Section 7, Chapter 25 of the Acts of 
1878, I herewith submit the Annual Report of the Department 
of Public Instruction for the year ending June 30, 1903. 
As I did not enter upon the duties of the office as State 
Superintendent until March 10, 1903, it has devolved upon me 
to compile the statistics of the work of my predecessor. 
Owing to an amendment to the public school laws, to which 
reference will be made hereafter, we found much difficulty in 
getting correct reports from County Superintendents, but deter- 
mined to have complete reports from every county in the State 
before submitting this report. This required time and caused 
delay in compiling the final statistics. Every report coming to 
this office was carefully examined, and where any errors were 
found they were sent back for correction. We believe the statis- 
tics found herein are as near accurate as they can be made under 
existing laws. 
The report. will show an increase of 4,076 in scholastic popu- 
lation. The increase in the white scholastic population was 
2,449, and of the colored population 1,627. The increase in num- 
ber of pupils enrolled during the year was 8,118, with an average 
daily attendance of 1,094 over that of the previous year. By 
reference to the tables showing the enrollment by grades it will 
be found that there has been a decided increase in the higher or 
secondary grades. This shows that pupils are remaining in 
school longer than heretofore. 
Especial attention is called to the miscellaneous table, which 
shows an average compensation of teachers per month of $37.80, 
an increase of $8.44 per month over the previous year. This 
table also shows the number completing the fifth grade and re- 
ceiving certificates to be nearly double that of the previous year. 
The fact that school property does not show a larger number of 
school buildings than the previous year is accounted for largely
-P-A-G-E-22
—19—~ 
by the fact that under the new district law many schools were 
abolished and the property is not given in this report. 
Attention is called to the comparative number of male and 
female teachers. The number of female teachers in the State is 
gradually increasing, while the number of male teachers is be- 
coming less. This is accounted for in two ways: first, with the 
commercial and industrial development of the State has come 
the demand for educated and competent men, and on account of 
the small salaries paid by our schools our male teachers are find- 
ing more remunerative employment in other lines. Secondly, 
lady teachers can be employed at lower salaries. 
The table of receipts and expenditures shows the total re- 
ceipts to be $347,658.74 more than the previous year. This is 
accounted for in part from the fact that in a number of counties 
it was found that errors had been made in reporting the balance 
on hand for the previous year. 
City ScHooLs. 
In revising the tables on city schools we have omitted a 
number of schools which properly come under the head of dis- 
trict schools, as they are not controlled by boards of education 
with a City Superintendent. The city schools of the State are in 
a most healthy condition and the table will show a much larger 
increase in the attendance upon them. Nearly all towns of over 
2,000 inhabitants have taken advantage of the law providing for 
municipal schools and are levying special school tax. Attention 
is also called to the fact that the average compensation of teachers 
in the city schools is increased $10.25 per month. 
Our Scuoon SysrEM. 
In studying the school system of Tennessee, it should be re- 
membered that when the State was admitted in 1796 it was un- 
able to give aid to its schools as all other States in the Mississippi 
Valley did. Tennessee was the only State in the Union whose 
public lands were the property 6: e United States and not the 
State. When Ohio was formed out of the northwest territory ~~ 
“in 1802 it received the first fruits of the ordinance of 1785, giv- 
ing the sixteenth section of each township to the inhabitants of 
the townships for educational purposes. It was not until 1806, 
ten years after the admission of Tennessee into the Union, that
-P-A-G-E-23
—20— 
like provision was made for this State. Then we had to meet 
conditions very different from Ohio and other States. Tennessee 
had not been reached by the system of surveys which established 
townships and sections, and so not being able to locate the sec- 
tions, Congress did not invest the title in the township. 
The early inhabitants of Tennessee were, as a rule, men pos- 
sessed of more or less education and there were very few illit- 
erates among them. They provided early for the education of 
the children and established in the Watauga Settlement Martin 
Academy, which afterwards became Washington College, and in 
the settlement of Nashborough Davidson Academy, which is 
now the University of Nashville. The early history of the State 
shows a large number of private colleges and academies scattered 
over the State, and from these colleges came the men who have 
made the State of Tennessee recognized all over the Union. 
There was scarcely a session of the General Assembly after the 
year 1806 that the establishment of a school system was not dis- 
cussed and acts were at different times passed until finally in 
1878 the present school system of the State was established, and 
for a permanent school fund the General Assembly provided 
that the Governor, under the Great Seal of the State, should 
sign a certificate of indebtedness and deposit the same with the 
Comptroller of the Treasury for the original permanent school 
fund of the State, $1,500,000, together with the interest that had 
accrued on the same and had not been paid by the State on the 
first day of January, 1878, making the entire permanent State 
school fund $2,512,500. Interest on this amount is now paid semi- 
annually at the rate of 6 per centum. In addition to this the 
State levies a tax of 15 cents on the $100, and a poll tax of $1, 
and the counties are required by law to levy a sufficient amount 
additional to run the schools at least five months in the year. 
Hon. W. R. Garrett, in his annual report as State Super- 
intendent for the years 1891-2, gives an admirable history of the 
public school system of the State. This should be published in 
pamphlet form for general distribution. 
LEGISLATION. 
The General Assembly of 1903 passed a number of acts 
affecting our public school system. Principal among these were 
the acts making school and civil districts coextensive and the
-P-A-G-E-24
—21— 
one providing that the surplus in the State treasury at the end 
of the year should be turned into the public school fund and 
distributed to the several counties in proportion to their scho- 
lastic population. 
Under the former law, County Courts had the right to estab- 
lish districts whenever they deemed proper. In many counties 
the number of districts had become so large that the scholastic 
population to the district was too small to furnish the necessary 
money for running the schools a reasonable length of time or 
paying sufficient salaries to employ competent teachers. There 
were many school districts with a scholastic population of less 
than 50, and as these districts would receive from all sources less 
than $100 for the support of the school, it can be easily seen that 
under this system the State was encouraging the maintenance of 
a large number of small schools with insufficient income to do 
efficient work. The provision of the law making school and civil 
districts coextensive and fixing a minimum limit on scholastic 
population for the maintenance of the school was to force the 
consolidation of these small, weak schools, and thus provide 
schools large enough to draw sufficient money to run longer 
terms and employ more competent teachers. Then, again, it was 
intended that the districts having a number of schools should 
establish a system similar to the cities. hat is, they should 
declare all the schools primary except one éentral school, and 
this should be a secondary school for the entire district. This 
will open the way for a successful grading of the rural schools. 
I estimate that under this act at least one thousand small, weak 
schools have been discontinued. 
Under an act of the Legislature of 1899, 10 per cent of the 
gross revenues of the State, together with the saved interest and 
any surplus in the treasury at the end of the year, went into a 
sinking fund for the payment of the interest on the State debt and 
retirement of State bonds. It was evident that more money was 
needed for the support of the schools of the State, and to raise 
this without increasing the taxes, the Legislature of 1903 pro- 
vided that the State should continue to use 10 per cent of the 
gross revenue for payment of interest on the State debt and to 
retire bonds, but it gave to the school fund the surplus remain- 
ing in the treasury. From this source our schools may reason- 
ably expect at least $270,000 this year. The wisdom of this act
-P-A-G-E-25
—22— 
will be readily seen when we take into consideration the fact 
that 80 per cent of the State debt bears but 3 per cent interest, 
and that money is worth more than this to the taxpayer. It 
simply means that we are to prolong fora time the payment of 
some of these bonds and provide for the education of the children 
that they may help pay them off. The State owes a debt to its 
children ag well as to the bondholders; and the Legislature 
certainly acted wisely in providing for the payment of both. 
Primary TEACHERS. 
One of the most hopeful indications in the educational af- 
fairs in the State is the popular demand for better trained pri- 
mary teachers. We are beginning to realize that the training of 
the mind and faculties of the child requires as thorough special . 
training as does the treatment of the physical body. The great 
need at the State today is schools for the training of these teach- 
ers¢ I believe that fully 75 per cent of the primary teaching in 
he te is wasted because of the lack of knowledge on the 
yart of teachers of the child’s mental development. 
EpucaTIonaAL CONFERENCE. 
On April 7, 8 and 9, 1903, an Educational Conference was 
held at the Peabody Normal College, under the direction of 
this Department, to which _Wwere-invited , pre Superin- 
tendents, School “Diréctors and friends education. The 
purposes-of -the--eonfereniée”" were?” first, a full discussion 
of the educational conditions and needs in every county in 
the State; second‘consideration of ways and means for the 
development of public education in the State; third, the begin- 
ning of a general campaign for the consolidation of schools, bet- 
ter buildings, better teachers, and more hearty support for the 
schools. 
Over 80 per cent of the County Superintendents of the 
State and a large number.of editors and other friends of educa- 
tion attended t the meeting. It was a general education rally and 
I believe was the beginning of a campaign that has proven of 
great value to the schools of the State. A number of distin- 
guished educators were present and aided us in formulating plans 
that have proven very successful. Reports coming to this de- 
partment show that in nearly every county in the State there    
 
-P-A-G-E-26
—23— 
has been a renewed interest in the cause of popular education 
and our public school system has been much better understood 
and appreciated by the people of the State. Weare indebtedto 
the General Education Board for the necessary financial help in VY 
holding the conference and to the Southern Education Board 
for help in carrying on the campaign. 
Summer ScHoots. 
We cannot too highly commend the valuable work done by 
the Summer School of the South at Knoxville and the Summer 
School of the Peabody College for Teachers at Nashville. The 
large number of teachers who attended these schools were not only 
benefited themselves, but most of them have become valuable 
workers in their respective counties, 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
As the table of statistics will show, institutes were held in 
nearly every county in the State, and the large number of teach- 
ers attending these shows the interest being taken in the same. 
These institutes were directed largely to the discussion of 
methods for teaching the branches of study included in our 
public school curriculum. Special attention was given to the 
subject of primary teaching. There is no money spent by the 
State that brings larger returns than the small amount expended 
for teachers’ institutes. We need trained teachers, and I believe, 
so far as possible, our own boys and girls should be prepared to 
teach our schools. Only a small per cent of the teachers can 
attend normal schools, so the most of their training must be had 
in the Institutes and County Teachers’ Associations. 
PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOLS AND SuGGESTIONS AS TO BRANCHES 
Z ReEquirep By LAw To BE TAUGHT IN THE SAME. 
The purpose of the schools should be the formation of char- 
acter, and this formation is brought about by the proper study 
of the various branches of learning and the application of the 
principles learned in the same to practical every-day life. The 
faculties of the child should be exercised, and in the school room 
this exercise is obtained by study. Our schools, then, should 
give more attention to the subject of study and less to the meré 
“attainment of knowledge. Our teachers” Institutes and meetings ™~ a eect nh ge attainment ata
-P-A-G-E-27
~—24— 
should give much attention to this important subject. Children 
do much of their studying in a haphazard way, and in their 
misguided efforts to master a subject they waste energy and ac- 
quire a distaste for school and school work. 
CLASSIFICATION oF STUDIES. 
The studies of our school course may not inappropriately be 
divided into the following classes: 
1. Instrumental, or those that are pursued not for their own 
intrinsic value, but as a means to the acquisition of other learn- 
ing. Reading, Spelling and Writing belong to this class. A 
pupil must be reasonably proficient in these before other studies 
can be successfully pursued. Hence their great importance and 
their universal recognition as the basis or foundation of all scho- 
lastic attainments. 
2. Informational, or those studies whose chief value lies in 
the useful information they impart. History, Geography and 
all Physical Sciences belong to this class. They make us ac- 
quainted with the world and its inhabitants and products; with 
the laws of nature and the life of mankind. 
8. Disciplinary and Cultural. To this group belong Mathe- 
matics, Languages and all that we call Literature. They should 
sharpen perception, stimulate reason, strengthen judgment, re- 
veal beauty and cultivate taste. These studies compose the great 
bulk of college work, but are taught in elementary form in our 
public schools and are of inestimable value. 
4. Let it be distinctly remembered that the above classifica- 
tion is only comparative. A cultural study has informational 
value, a disciplinary study has instrumental value, and so on. 
There is no hard and fast line separating the classes; each, at 
some point, merges into another, and the characteristics given 
them in this classification are only their predominant ones. 
Reaping, 
1. Correct reading is the most important attainment any 
child ever makes in his school life. The sooner a pupil acquires 
facility and accuracy in reading the more rapid and assured will 
be his success in every line of study. Therefore give this sub- 
ject the earnest attention its importance demands.
-P-A-G-E-28
—25— 
> 2. There are two purposes to be attained in correct reading: 
QPirst, to learn how to think the thoughts of other people by 
looking at the arbitrary characters printed in a book, to interpret 
the printed or written page. Second, to express the thought 
thus gained so that others may understand it as the reader un- 
derstands it. 
The first is wholly a mental process; the second is both 
mental and mechanical. A pupil has not learned to read at all 
until he can readily interpret (within the limits of his vocabu- 
lary) the page placed before him, and then express clearly the 
ideas obtained. 
3. It will be readily seen from Paragraph 2 that only a good 
silent reader can become a good oral reader. There must be 
clean thought in the child’s mind before clear expression can 
come from the tongue. 
In primary reading the mechanics of learning how to asso- 
ciate the arbitrary symbols of our alphabet with thoughts de- 
mands all of the teacher’s skill and ingenuity for the first half 
term, but the dominant and constant guide of the teacher must 
be, first, the thought, then the expression. 
SPELLING. 
1. In the teaching of spelling there must be two purposes 
7 clearly in view. First, to write correctly. Second, to pronounce 
correctly. 
The disciplinary value of spelling lies in the rigid and exact 
training that it gives in observation and memory. 
2. Both written and oral spelling must be learned, as both 
are invaluable to people who can hear. The most unerring 
spellers are the educated deaf mutes.. Having never heard a 
sound they are never misled by sounds. Hare and hair have 
no more association in their minds than the word antelope and 
handkerchief. This fact presents the thoughtful teacher a sub- 
ject for careful study. 
8. Our ability to spell correctly depends upon the accuracy 
of our observation and the clearness of our mental image of the 
word to be spelled. A written word is an object appealing to the 
sense of sight. If it be reproduced in writing it is again an ob- 
ject appealing to the same sense. Written spelling appeals 
chiefly to the child’s presentative faculties, the strongest of early
-P-A-G-E-29
—26— 
life. Oral spelling requires, much more than written, the use 
of representative powers which are comparatively feeble in child- 
hood. Written spelling may be profitably used, and repeated 
again and again wherever errors occur, through the whole school 
course. Oral spelling should be very sparingly taught in the 
first year of school life and increased year after year as the pupil 
advances. 
Every lesson should be a spelling lesson if it contains any 
word that the pupil cannot write correctly. Spelling should be 
taught in the lower grades that the pupils may acquire the habit 
of noticing and remembering the orthography of all words met 
with in their reading. The habit being assured correct spelling 
is assured. Pupils will be made good spellers only when held 
responsible for the spelling of every word which they use in their 
school work. The teacher must call attention to all misspelled 
words in the pupil’s work and see that they are corrected. 
Teaching spelling requires persistent, faithful work on the part 
of the teacher. 
GEOGRAPHY. 
1. The field of geographical study is world-wide and, in 
some sense, includes all physical science. It is in some respects 
the simplest and most evident and in others the most complex 
and comprehensive of nature studies. While it is studied chiefly 
for the sake of information, its teachings afford peculiar advan- 
tages for training observation, memory, imagination and reason. 
The character of work to be done at any point must be deter- 
mined by the maturity and intelligence of the pupil. 
2. The purposes of geographical teaching may be briefly 
) stated as follows: 
(a) To give the pupils certain facts to be kept in memory. 
(b) To show the relations which different parts of the earth 
bear to each other and how all combine to make a system. 
(c) To make clear the relation of the facts of Geography to 
the life and occupations of man. 
(d) To cultivate a taste for research and investigation. 
This is by no means all, but it is a brief outline including, 
in general statemexts, the most important purposes, 
3. A large amount of memory work must be done, and 
thoroughly done, but discreetly. As a bare fact, the locations of
-P-A-G-E-30
—27— 
Cape Charles and Cape Henry are matters of little importance. 
But when it is remembered that the entrance to Chesapeake Bay 
is the gateway through which passed the first English settlers 
of America, that through this same gate is the entrance to the 
Capital of the United States, its great navy yard at Norfolk, its 
naval academy at Annapolis and its testing ranges on the Po- 
tomac; that between these two capes rolls the great tide of foreign 
commerce to and from Harrisburg, Baltimore, Washington, 
Richmond, Norfolk and Petersburg—when all of this is remem- 
bered the exact location of these two capes becomes a matter of 
great importance—something that must be learned and remem- 
bered. Decide what is important and have this thoroughly 
memorized, Waste no time on unimportant details. 
PrystoLocy,. 
In Physiology, as in other branches of nature study, the 
teaching should be based, as far as possible, on the object, and 
the text-book be made secondary. Information that is rarely 
obtained outside of school is the purpose. The proper care of 
the body and the formation of good habits should be constantly 
before the teacher’s mind while giving a lesson on Physiology to 
any class of pupils. Hygienic and physiological themes should 
of course be most prominent. Some teaching of Anatomy is 
necessary, but no time or strength should be wasted on anatom- 
ical details that have no value except as part of the professional 
knowledge of a surgeon. 
Hisrory. 
1. One who does not know the history of the past cannot 
clearly understand the conditions of the present. The laws, 
customs, manners and habits of the people of today are seriously 
affected by those of the people of two thousand years ago. The 
Code of Justinian lives in the laws of Tennessee. A thousand 
years ago our fierce Saxon and Norman ancestors lifted their 
visors when they came among friends; today we lift our hats 
when we meet our friends. Most of our customs refer to the 
past. 
2. Need anything more be said to conscientious teachers of 
the importance of historical study, or of the zeal and energy that 
should be displayed in teaching this subject?
-P-A-G-E-31
—28— 
The following general purposes should be kept in view in all 
school work: 
First, to acquaint the pupil with the important facts and 
sharacters of history—Memory Work. 
Second, to trace the connection of cause and effect in the facts 
hat have been learned—Reasoning or Philosophical Work. 
Third, bring out prominently the great characters worthy of 
imitation, develop patriotism, teach the elementary facts of civ- 
ics, and prepare for good citizenship—Emotional or Imaginative 
Work. 
Fourth, reach beyond the specific book in hand and culti- 
vate a taste for historical reading—Cultural Work. 
83. Use maps freely and correlate the facts of Geography 
and History. 
See that dates and events are firmly connected, and that only 
important ones are memorized. , 
In philosophical work have frequent recitations with open 
books and text of different authors. Pictures, relics, poems, 
story books, anecdotes, and tales of travel and adventure are 
valuable aids in the teaching of History. Use them freely, but 
remember that they cannot supply the place of a good historical 
text. 
ARITHMETIC. 
pent on it, and more energy wasted in teaching it, than any 
other subject in the school course, with the possible exception of 
Language or Grammar. Pr Of Arithmetic it may be safely affirmed that more time is 
8 
The great trouble with a majority of teachers seems to be 
that they do not know exactly what they wish to accomplish. 
Mathematics is an absolute and exact science. Only positive and 
exact purposes and results are worth anything at all. 
First, determine precisely what is necessary to be done, then 
do it. Whether it takes a day, a week, a month or a whole term 
is not to be considered. The importance of the subject demands 
both time and labor. Only exact and positive results can be ac- 
cepted. Adhere strictly to concrete or object teaching, grad- 
ually introducing the figures as symbols of the numbers, until 
numbers and their combinations and divisions are understood ;
-P-A-G-E-32
—29— 
then drill, drill, drill, until automatic accuracy is secured in the 
“use of the symbolsor Arabic figures. If this be thoroughly done, 
from grade to grade, the use of other symbols in advanced Math- 
ematics will come easily enough. 
LANGUAGE. 
The main purpose of language teaching in the lower grades 
of our public schools is to secure facility and purity in the use 
of English. In the upper grades there is the additional purpose 
of leading the pupils to recognize and appreciate good literature, 
1. Expression demands a thought to be expressed. In 
early life the most prolific source of ideas is observation. The 
teacher should stimulate observation as a part of the language 
lesson, not as simply an accessory to it. 
2. Objects and pictures should be used as a basis for ques- 
tions by the teacher. Questioning children about objects out of 
the range of their observation and in which they feel no interest 
is waste of time. 
8. Conversation must precede writing. Only by oral drill 
can young children learn to use any language, and only by this 
method do we learn the principles of agreement and catch the 
true spirit of the English idiom. 
4, Asa means of teaching fluency, children should be re- 
quired to express themselves in complete sentences, and in sen- 
tences connected in thought. 
5. Corrections should be made quietly and kindly. Other- 
wise the children will cease to express themselves freely, and the 
teacher’s opportunity will have vanished. 
Nature Srupy. 
Nature Study, in its most practical form, is the study of the 
phenomena of nature about us. When carried on in the right 
manner it is of great benefit to the pupil. It places him on fa- 
miliar terms with the workings of nature; he is no stranger to 
the sciences when he enters the elements of those studies in the 
grammar and high schools. 
Much of the so-called nature study, in which things in 
nature are given life and made to speak, is more harmful than 
beneficial. The result sought for is lost in the eager search for
-P-A-G-E-33
—-30— 
the pleasing in the stories. It is better to take up a few natural 
objects and study them than it is to read so many stories of the 
wonderful doings of something in nature. If you are going to 
teach fables, teach them as such, and not as Nature Study. 
The careful observation of the growth of a plant in the win- 
.ow garden will be of far greater benefit than three or four stories 
f how the plant grew; the sight of some squash and other seeds 
getting up out of the ground will make a more lastingimpression ~ 
“on the child’s mind than-stories will, Thus you have the idea. 
Have practical, every-day obsetvations that the children are able 
to make for themselves, and then occasionally you can weave in 
a short story. 
Puysics. 
J A thorough and exhaustive study of Physics in one term of 
“ our public schools is, of course, impossible, but of many of its 
elementary facts and principles sufficient knowledge may be 
gained to be of great value in any walk of life or in any after 
course of study. 
In teaching this subject, without special apparatus,improvised 
methods of experiment are highly recommended; but it must be 
remembered that the experience of others is worth something, 
and that all knowledge is not necessarily “first hand.” The 
statements of good authorities may be accepted as correct with- 
out stopping to demonstrate each one. It is only by the present 
inheriting from the past that the sum of human knowledge can 
be increased. 
Teach carefully and thoroughly : 
1. General and specific properties of bodies, illustrating with 
any common objects, as, a few marbles, a few corks, pieces of 
whalebone, bits of rubber, or anything that may be convenient. 
2. Difference between physical and chemical changes of 
matter; illustrate by cutting into several forms a piece of wood 
and burning a similar piece. 
3. Simple machines or the mechanical powers; these can be 
easily improvised, or examples of them may be found in nearly 
every home. 
4. Pressure of liquids and gasses; numbers of illustrations 
may be drawn from the experience or observations of the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-34
—31— 
The phenomena and theory of universal gravitation, the 
laws of optics, magnetism, electricity, theories of heat and of 
transmutation of forces are subjects upon which the pupil had 
better be instructed by the leading authorities on these subjects 
rather than by crude and hurried experiments. 
In all teaching of this subject have the two-fold purpose : to 
impart correct knowledge and to arouse the spirit of investigation. 
GEOMETRY. 
7 One of the greatest difficulties confronting a beginner in Ge- 
ometry is the sudden transition from the mechanical processes 
and symbolic work of Arithmetic and Algebra to the comparative 
abstractions of deductive reasoning as used in Geometry. The 
teacher must be in sympathy with the pupil’s mental condition, 
must realize that to him the quantities seem very indefinite, the 
definitions far from distinct, and the processes decidedly mys- 
terious. 
Take up the geometric magnitudes, point, line, surface, solid 
and angle, dwell upon these, illustrating with abundant con- 
structive work until they are understood. Next, take up right 
angles, acute angles, obtuse angles, and complements and sup- 
plements of angles. Introduce the circle and show how and 
why angles are designated by degrees of a circumference. After 
these have been thoroughly learned the pupil will be ready for 
Proposition IV, Book I, of Wentworth’s Geometry. This propo- 
sition requires chiefly the use of inequations and the axioms 
used in algebra. With these the pupil is supposed to be already 
well acquainted, and it is a well recognized pedagogical principle 
to use what the pupil knows to lead him to learn what he does 
not know. Require the work to be neatly written and drawn in 
the following order: 
1. The theorem. 
2. The construction, 
3. The statement of what is proved. 
4. The demonstration. 
It will be seen that the introduction to the study here recom- 
mended does not follow the usual order of our text-books, but it 
gives better results than a literal following of the book. When 
a pupil has learned that the sum of the interior angles of any tri- 
angle is equal to two right angles, he should at once learn the
-P-A-G-E-35
—32— 
value of the sum of the interior angles of any polygon, as all 
polygons are resolvable into triangles. These propositions are 
placed far apart in our Geometry, but should nevertheless be 
brought into close sequence in instruction. The same may be 
said of many other widely severed propositions. The teacher’s 
judgment and skill should group and combine in instruction the 
closely allied facts and principles however widely apart they may 
be treated in a book. Remember that clear and exact reasoning 
up to definite conclusions is the chief purpose of this study. Go 
slowly, very slowly if necessary, and introduce definitions only 
as needed, and work accurately. If the first book of Wentworth 
is finished in ten weeks, the class has done good work and after- 
wards will make easy and pleasant progress. 
PENMANSHIP. 
1. Penmanship may be classed as almost purely an instru- 
mental study. It is not an end in itself. It is learned only for 
the purpose of erabling us to express or put into lasting form the 
thoughts that may occur to us, or that we may have learned from 
others. It is ‘‘the art preservative of other arts,” and nothing 
more. Its correct teaching is of prime importance. He who can 
read well, can spell correctly, and can write neatly has in his pos- 
session the means or instruments that make it possible for him 
“to-acquire all the learning of all the ages.” 
F 2. The most important characteristic of writing is that it 
shall be legible, clearly, unmistakably legible. After this come 
neatness and beauty. All children should be taught to write 
with the right hand. Our ‘Yeading from left. to right, the italic 
slant of all business writing, and the positions of body, paper, ete., 
recommended by the masters in this art, all demand the use of 
the right hand. The fact that some children are left-handed has 
nothing to do with the case of a beginner. A totally new train- 
ing is to be given the nerves and muscles of arm, hand and fin- 
gers, and this can be given to one hand as easily as to the other. 
Much attention should be given in all the grades to correct 
position of the body. The proper holding of the pen or pencil 
should be insisted upon and the muscular movement used. The 
pupils should be drilled until thoroughly familiar with the let- 
ter, then combinations of letters in words of one sylable. 
As soon as pupils acquire the correct movement, neatness
-P-A-G-E-36
—33— 
and accuracy should be required. They should be given much 
time, however, for this before they are urged to be neat, for the 
untrained muscles are apt to play them tricks and the child be 
greatly discouraged because a page has been spoiled. 
If the pupil is made to realize what a lasting benefit good 
penmanship will be to him, then half the battle is won for the 
teacher. 
The blackboard should be used freely to show errors and give 
correct forms. During the writing exercises as much individual 
attention as possible should be given, correcting, suggesting and 
carefully inspecting the work of each pupil. The pupils should 
be required to do the best work of which they are capable, 
Teachers in all departments should cooperate with the super- 
visor in that they require the pupils to sit correctly and hold pen 
or pencil properly whenever written work is required of them. 
In the primary grades the children’s writing should be on a 
large scale. Much blackboard writing should be done. A good 
exercise is for the teacher to write the copy on the board and 
after a short time erase and have the children write from memory, 
If mistakes are made rewrite, copy and try again.

STATE INSTITUTE, COOKEVILLE. 
June 22, Four Weeks. 
Sir: Through your courtesy it was my privilege to conduct 
the Institute at Cookeville this season, and I trust that the inter- 
est manifested by the teachers who attended and the efforts put 
forth by those in charge have in some degree justified the confi- 
dence you reposed in me. ‘ 
Professors W. N. Billingsley, N. J. Finney, E. H. Boyd and 
Misses Keeble, Trimble and Della Stroud were earnest and un- 
affected in their methods of instruction, and won the attention 
of their classes by their simplicity. I cannot commend them too 
highly. It was a genuine pleasure to have their cheerful and 
helpful aid each day. 
Without being critical, it seems to me that the greatest trou- 
ble our teachers have to contend with is a lack of acquaintance 
with the mother-tongue, not its grammatical technicalities, for 
they will split hairs innumerable according to Hyde, Swinton,. 
Tarbell, Smith and Goold Brown, but with the actual words of 
the language and their simple, everyday meanings. While I ex- 
press this opinion of their shortcomings, I beg to say that I have 
never known any more eager to take instruction than the teach- 
ers assembled at Cookeville this summer. 
Fourteen stood the examination for the Roll of Honor and 
passed; of the seventy who stood the examination, the greater 
part succeeded in making the requisite per cent. Under your di- 
rection, renewals, or extensions, were made in several instances, 
in former certificates. 
To the Board of Trustees of Cookeville, to Hon. H. D. Whit- 
son, County Judge, and the members of the County Court, to the 
Directors of Putnam County, to the generous people of Cooke- 
ville, our sincerest thanks are due and cordially given. I am, 
with all respect, Obediently yours, 
. James F, Lipscoms, 
Conductor.

STATE INSTITUTE, DICKSON. 
June 8, Four Weeks. 
Sir: The following report of the State Institute conducted 
at Dickson, Tennessee, from June 8 to July 8, 1903, is most re- 
spectfully submitted : . 
The most cordial feeling existed not only between the indi- 
vidual members of the faculty, but between the faculty and 
teachers, also between the members of the Institute and the citi- 
zens. 
The quality of teachers in attendance was above the average 
—the best from fourteen counties of Middle Tennessee, and from 
seven counties of West Tennessee. ‘Superintendent R. E. Corlew 
of Dickson County was present every day. He worked for the 
suceess of the Institute from the time it was located at Dickson 
until it closed. Superintendent R. 8. Ballow of Hickman Coun- 
ty also attended and gave much assistance. 
‘The college buildings are well arranged for a State Insti- 
tute. The people of Dickson understand how to make strangers 
feel at home. Board with good accommodations cost $10 for the 
Institute period. Dickson is situated on the Highland Rim on 
the divide between the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers, which 
gives it a cooler climate than many of the Middle and West Ten- 
nessee counties. 
The following work was assigned to each instructor fifteen 
days before the Institute convened : 
T. B. Loggins—Physiology, Grammar, Physies, Agriculture, 
Geology: 
J. B. Cummings—Arithmetic, Tennessee History, Book- 
keeping, Civil Government. 
F. J. Page—Reading, Orthography, Primary Language, 
Theory and Practice, Pedagogy, Rhetoric. 
E. B. Wilson—Geography, United States History, Geome- 
try, Algebra, 
Your Special Instructor in Primary Work, Miss Susie Fin-
-P-A-G-E-114
—111— 
negan, was with us the first week of the Institute. Her work was _ 
practical and correlated well with the regular work of the In- 
stitute. 
Your Special Instructor on School Law and Rural Schools, 
Superintendent P. L. Harned, was with us June 11 and 12. His 
work was needed and well received. 
Superintendent S. A. Mynders was present July 1 and in- 
structed the Institute on the needs of the rural schools. His talk 
was very much appreciated. 
There was no time given to anything that would detract 
from the object of the Institute.

RESOLUTIONS. 
We, your committee, believe that the sense of this Educa- 
tional Conference is that the County Superintendents and school 
officials should carry into their respective communities the idea 
that it is the desire of the people of this State to have better
-P-A-G-E-120
—1li— 
schools, and in order to obtain this result we must first create a 
strong educational spirit among the people. 
We, therefore, recommend an active and vigorous educa- 
tional campaign in every county and civil district in this State 
by all persons interested in developing the children into an edu- 
cated citizenship; and to this end we especially recommend the 
thorough discussion of the following subjects in these various 
rallies: 
(1.) We heartily endorse and urge the consolidation of 
schools in the rural districts because they give us at less cost, 
longer terms, better teaching, and more individual attention to 
the pupils. 
(2.) We commend the idea of having a good practical 
teachers’ library for the teachers of each county, said library to 
be kept in the County Superintendent's office, and a good library 
in each schoolhouse in the county, for the broader culture of the 
pupils. 
(3.) (We recommend an increased appropriation by the" 
State for school purposes, and most heartily endorse local taxa- 
tion by the several County Courts in order that we may have 
better school buildings with modern equipments and attractive 
grounds, better teaching and more efficient supervision. 
(4.) It is the sense of this conference that primary instruc- 
tion is of paramount importance, and that for this work better 
trained teachers for primary work should be employed. 
(5.) In conclusion, we earnestly urge every County Super- 
intendent to return to his home determined to carry on an ag- 
gressive compaign among his people, to interest his County 
Court, the school directors and all the good citizens of his county 
in a united effort for the upbuilding of the public schools.

STATE INSTITUTE, TULLAHOMA. 
June 15, Four Weeks, 
Sir: TI have the honor to submit the following report of the 
State Institute held at Tullahoma from June 15 to July 10 in- 
elusive: 
On the morning of June 15 the faculty, teachers and a num- 
ber of visitors assembled in the auditorium of the Brandon Train- 
ing School Building for the opening exercises: 
After singing and prayer a number of enthusiastic addresses 
of welcome and responses were made, after which teachers were 
enrolled and the daily program of work was announced. Ow- 
ing to the fact that the County Institute in Coffee, as well as all 
other surrounding counties, were held during the session of this 
State Institute, the enrollment was very small. The interest up- 
on the part of those present was excellent from first to last. 
During the session instructive lectures were delivered by sev- 
eral prominent men—among the number may be mentioned 
Revs. Raleigh Wright, C. R. Wade, Prof. W. P. Hale and Prof. 
P. A. Lyon. 
Among the many entertaining features none delighted the 
teachers and friends more than the music, both vocal and instru- 
mental, rendered by Misses Hattie and Isla Paschal and Miss 
Anette Curd. 
The work of the instructors can not be too highly com- 
mended. Superintendents Lawson, Sherrill and Ijams, Prof. 
Hutcherson and Miss Georgia Oliver are most certainly spe- 
cialists of a superior order. 
One session a day was held from 8 a. m. to 12:30 p.m. On 
special days afternoon sessions were held for the purpose of dis- 
cussing general school topics. These afternoon meetings proved 
to be quite interesting.as well as beneficial. 
The number of teachers enrolled was 73. At the close of the 
session the regular examination was held and certificates were is- 
sued as follows:

The sessions of the Institute were held in the County High 
School Building, commodious, well arranged and located in a 
beautiful and well shaded campus on the western outskirts of the 
beautiful little classic city. It was an ideal spot for study and 
reereation. An excellent choir furnished an abundance of de- 
lightful music, and the miscellaneous hour in the afternoon was 
always taken up with lectures, declamations and other profita- 
ble diversions. Numerous speakers both from home and abroad 
entertained us, among whom were Dr. Robinette and Judge Al- 
len of Athens, and ex-Superintendent 8. Hixon of Hamilton,
-P-A-G-E-127
—124— 
Captain W. R. Garrett of Nashville, and others. The Conductor 
gave two formal lectures to the Institute, one upon the doctrine 
of ‘Born Short,’’ and one upon the ‘‘ Education of Democracy.” 
Numerous visitors from all over East Tennessee were in fre- 
quent attendance on the sessions of the Institute, and everybody 
seemed pleased with the interest and enthusiasm displayed, and 
loud in their praise of the character of the work done. While 
here the teachers were shown every courtesy any town could of- 
fer. The business men of the city, as well as the citizens gener- 
ally, did all in their power to make our stay both pleasant and - 
profitable. The newspapers, too—the Athenian-Citizen, and Ath- 
ens Post—-were especially helpful in their full and complete re- 
ports of the. Institute, extending every courtesy to both faculty 
and members, and aided in many ways to make the Institute the 
crowning success that it was. 
Of my associates in this work I cannot speak too much. They 
proved to be instructors of a high order, thoroughly capable, con- 
scientious and enthusiastic, laboring earnestly and faithfully to 
advance the interests of the large student body that looked to 
them for guidance, and to them is due to a large extent the grat- 
ifying success attained. 
Seventeen days were devoted to instruction and three days 
to examination. No certificates of former Institutes were re- 
newed, and none were issued, except to those who passed a most 
rigid examiriation and made the grades required.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
Your Committee on Resolutions beg leave to report the fol- 
lowing: 
1. That we are thankful to State Superintendent Mynders 
for locating the State Institute at this place, and as it has been 
attended with great suecess, we ask him to select Athens as the 
place for the session during the summer of 1904. 
2. That we appreciate the labors of the Conductor, J. 8. 
Cline of Crab Orchard, and his able corps of instructors, B. O. 
Duggan of South Pittsburg, M. R. M. Burke of Athens, Mrs. Em- 
ma Rice of Knoxville, Miss Georgia Oliver of Nashville, and Miss 
Emily Hughes of Jackson, and commend each for the able and 
efficient manner in which they have discharged the work. 
8. That the thanks of the Institute are due to the good 
people of Athens for the warm reception given to them, and the 
pleasing manner in which they have acted in making our stay 
among them so pleasant. 
4. That we are indebted to the Athens Brass Band for the 
inspiring music furnished, and also the choir under the guid- 
ance of Miss Nona Lowe, for the most excellent music furnished 
each day during the entire Institute. Also to Dr. Robinette, 
Professor Josiah S. Cline, Judge N. Q. Allen, and ex-State Su- 
perintendent W. R. Garrett for the able and interesting addresses 
delivered during the Institute. 
5. That we are under many obligations to each of the citi- 
zens of Athens who contributed so liberally of their means, and 
used their best efforts, whereby it was made possible to secure 
the month of training which we feel we so greatly needed.

HIGH SCHOOL RESOLUTION. 
The following supplementary resolution was presented to 
the Institute and adopted: 
Resolved, That we heartily endorse the action of the Mc- 
Minn County Court in establishing a County High School, a 
move in the advance direction, and we learn that a Teachers’ 
Training Course will be established in connection with the same, 
and as we see the great need of better qualified and trained 
teachers for the work, we therefore endorse the McMinn County 
High School, and recommend that our teachers, especially the 
younger ones, attend this school the last term in the year. 
Respectfully submitted, 
M. R. M. Burks, 
James §. CLINE, 
J.D, CLemMER, 
J..F. Harrison, 
C. K. GALLAHER. 
In conclusion, I desire to say that our work at Athens has 
been eminently satisfactory, as the large attendance would seem 
to indicate, and that interest and enthusiasm were marked char- 
acteristics of the assemblage from beginning to the end. 
Truly yours, 
Josian S. Cuinn, Conductor, 
M. R. M. Burks, Sec. of Faculty, 
B. O. Duaaan, Assistant.

STATE INSTITUTE, HARRIMAN. 
June 22, Four Weeks. 
Sm: In obedience to your instructions, I opened a State In- 
stitute at Harriman June 22, and respectfully submit the follow- 
ing as my report: . 
The Institute was called to order promptly at 9:30 o’clock 
with quite a number of teachers and a splendid representation of 
the influential citizens in attendance. We were cordially wel- 
ecomed by Mayor Hendricks in an enthusiastic speech, in which 
he very generously turned over the keys of the city, promising a 
hearty cooperation on his part and that of the citizens of Harri- 
man toward making the Institute a grand success. 
I found Professors Brown, Hunt and Morelock on the 
grounds ready and-anxious for the work to begin. In the very 
beginning I would say that the teachers went to work in earnest, 
were punctual in attendance, prepared well their work, and 
seemed to appreciate and cultivate all the privileges and oppor- 
tunities offered. 
A morning and afternoon session was held each day open- 
ing at 8:30 and 2 o’clock, respectively, and adjourning at 11:30 
and 4 o’clock, our plan of instruction, both by recitation (written 
and oral) and lecture, all the while dwelling upon methods and 
losing no opportunity of emphasizing the true characteristics of 
the successful teacher. 
There were in attendance during the Institute 125 actual 
teachers, and I am free to say that I have never known a better 
average daily attendance. We had many obstacles with which 
to contend, chiefly, that the two preceding Institutes had not 
been successful, and then the prevalence of smallpox in the city 
all the while. I think under the circumstances that the success 
of our meeting was almost marvelous. 
Roane and the adjoining counties had been well canvassed 
by Prof. J. C. Wright, and I feel that much is due him for 
our splendid Institute. He is alive and progressive, and spares 
neither energy nor time in the discharge of duty. It is certainly a 
pleasure to work with him.
-P-A-G-E-138
—135— 
Professors Brown, Hunt, Morelock and Miss Keeble Trim- 
ble, members of the faculty, prepared and handled well their re- 
spective subjects, and I certainly am grateful for their splendid 
aid and uniform courtesy. 
The ladies of the W. C. T. U. were especially kind and lost 
no opportunity to aid us and assuredly extended us many cour- 
tesies. 
During the Institute we were visited by Drs. Spence and 
Emory, also Chancellor Tate, all of whom we enjoyed very much 
in their able and instructive lectures. We would acknowledge 
our gratitude to Revs. McPhie, Fowler, Wyley, Beaman, Rasnake 
and Dr. Taggart, as they were with us so often in our devotional 
exercises. We would not forget Mrs. Hendricks, Misses Dun- 
ham, Smith, Harsh and others for their beautiful songs and reci- 
tations. 
In conclusion I would say that I am of the opinion that 
through these State Institutes great good can be done, and if 
properly worked up and the system, thoroughly organized, that 
more teachers may be reached than by any other means. Am sat- 
isfied that our educational fabrie is being placed on a better 
foundation, and I feel that, with a faithful sentinel, as you are, 
upon the watchtower, the cause will wax. strong and a fruit- 
ful harvest will, in the near future, be our portion. 
Respectfully, 
C. S. Doug.ass.

The following are the resolutions adopted by the State Nor- 
mal held at Harriman, Tennessee, beginning June 22 and clos- 
ing July 17. 
Wuereag, The session of the State Institute, held at Harri- 
man, is now closing, and the citizens of both the town and coun- 
ty having spared no effort to make the session one of profit long 
to be remembered; therefore 
Resolved first, That the thanks of the Institute are hereby 
tendered to them for their interest in its work. 
Resolved second, That the thanks of the Institute be ten- 
dered te the Hon. Seymour A. Mynders, our efficient State Su- 
perintendent, for the deep interest he has taken in the schools of 
the State, and for his untiring efforts to place our State in the 
very front of public school work. We believe that his unremit- 
ting energy and his unyielding purpose will safely guarantee to 
us a radical revolution in educational affairs. 
Resolved third, That we congratulate ourselves upon having 
such an able and efficient Conductor as Capt. C. S. Douglass. He 
is kind and affable in manner, pleasing and instructive in his 
lectures, always arousing enthusiasm and interest in the whole 
Institute. We believe that it is largely through his devotion to 
the cause of education that this Institute has been an eminent 
success. 
Resolved fourth, That our truest thanks be extended to the 
able faculty, consisting of Professors 8. E. Hunt, 8. C. Brown, 
W. H. Morelock and Miss Keeble Trimble for their faithful, 
earnest and patient efforts in the normal work. 
Resolved fifth, That this Institute tender its most sincere 
thanks to Prof. J. C. Wright, County Superintendent, for his un- 
tiring and ceaseless efforts in behalf of every individual stu- 
dent in the Institute. 
Resolved sixth, That thanks be extended to the press for its
-P-A-G-E-141
—138— 
many favors; to the Mayor, Hon. Claude E. Hendricks, for his 
many kindnesses; and to Miss Sallie Oats Galleher for her effi- 
cient services as Secretary of this body. 
* Resolved seventh, That our thanks be extended the W. C. T. 
U. for the kind interest which they have taken in our comfort and 
pleasure. 
Resolved eighth, That we humbly ask the Superintendent of 
the State to grant us a State Normal next year, pledging to 
him our united and cordial support; and that we ask him 
to return to us as Director of the same, Capt. Douglass, and the 
same faculty, who have so ably served us the present year.

The exercises of the Institute were conducted in accordance 
with the circular of announcement issued from your office; irrele- 
vant matters were excluded, and the work done ditfered in no 
respect from that of a high grade school. Promptness and sys- 
tematization in presenting and conducting the lessons were as 
much emphasized as the subject matter itself. Regular topies 
for study were assigned daily and every recitation was a fulfil- 
ment of a preconceived plan. 
Owing to some local opposition existing previous to the open- 
ing of the Institute the attendance was not as large as had been 
expected; happily, however, all traces: of discordant elements 
were overcome and long before the close of the Institute every 
one was enthusiastic in the support of the work. I believe that 
the sentiment of every one is now strongly in favor of the Insti- 
tute and next year will see the attendance doubled. 
I can not refrain from incorporating in my report the fol- 
lowing passages from the resolutions unanimously adopted at the 
elose of the Institute, since they will express this harmony and 
unity of feelings towards the work. 
REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
Your Committee on Resolutions beg leave to submit the fol- 
lowing report: 
Wuereas, The State Institute held at Greeneville for the 
past four weeks has been a success in every particular, and see- 
ond to none ever held in East Tennessee; therefore be it 
Kesowed first, That the thanks of this Institute be tendered 
Superintendent S. A. Mynders for locating the Institute at 
Greeneville and for favoring us with such a strong and efficient 
faculty. 
Second, That ere the time arrives for another State Insti- 
tute, Greeneville will have an auditorium which will afford com- 
fortable accommodations, free of cost, and that it is the desire of
-P-A-G-E-144
—141— 
this body that the State Institute be located at this place per- 
manently. 
In fact the interest and devotion of the teachers to their 
daily work so increased as the Institute progressed that there was 
neither time nor disposition for outside entertainment. 
County Superintendent R. H. Burkhart and ex-County Su- 
perintendent B. D. White were at all times efficient and zealous 
promoters of the good of the Institute, and their hearty and loyal

STATE INSTITUTE, HUNTINGDON. 
June 15, Four Weeks. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you the report of the 
State Institute, held under your direction at Huntingdon from 
June 15 to July 10. 
The city of Huntingdon subscribed liberally for the Insti- 
tute, and the Institute had been fully brought before the teachers 
of this part of the State previous to the opening, and so on the 
opening day the chapel of the Southern Normal University was 
filled with teachers and friends of the work who came to aid in 
the opening exercises. 
The entire plant of the Southern Normal University was 
turned over to us for use of the teachers and your directions were 
carefully carried out in all the departments of work. 
June 24 was ‘‘Rally Day,’’ and more than one thousand peo- 
ple came to attend the exercises of this day. His Excellency 
Gov. James B. Frazier was with us on that day and made a great 
address, which was appreciated by the great audience present. 
School officials from Carroll and adjoining counties were present 
and much enthusiasm was manifested. It was a real rally day, 
and was such a day as will tell in its work for the campaign for 
public school education in this part of the State. 
Addresses were also delivered by Hon. O. C. Barton, Di- 
rector Johnsonius, Joe Routen of Henry County, Hon. S. 8. 
Featherstone, County Superintendent of Weakley County, and 
P. L. Harned of Montgomery County, representing the State Su- 
perintendent, who on account of sickness was unable to attend. 
The entire County Institute of Henry County, which was in ses- 
sion at Paris, came down to enjoy the rally with us. 
Of my associates, selected by you, Professors A. R. Thomas, 
Paris; N. Trawick, Yuma; G. C. Hanna, Shelbyville; Misses Leo- 
nora Bond, Nashville; Nannie Mai Temple, Jackson; and Susie 
Finnagin, Nashville, I cannot say too much in praise of their 
work. The work was full of harmony and enthusiasm. They are 
all, those, who do a high grade work and I am sure that it will tell 
out in the work of the teachers who were with us.

STATE INSTITUTE, JACKSON. 
June 8, Four Weeks. 
Str: JT beg leave to submit the report of the State Institute, 
held at Jackson, beginning June 8, 1903, and continuing four 
weeks : 
This, the eleventh session of the Jackson Institute, was, in- 
deed, a most successful one. _Our attendance was large and we 
had a most splendid student body of teachers. 
The work done this year not only sustained the high char- 
acter of this Institute, but added new laurels to it. 
The instructors were prompt, faithful and untiring in their 
efforts to make the work both pleasant and profitable. 
The faculty endeavored to make the Institute a real pedagog- 
ical school in which the public school branches were reviewed, 
and their best methods of how these subjects should be pre- 
sented to the children were made prominent in the daily lec- 
tures. 
The more experience I have in Institute work the more I 
realize the need of schools for the professional training of teach- 
ers. If it is possible to do so the term of the State Institute 
ought to be lengthened. : 
Our most grateful thanks are due the City Board of Edu- 
cation for the use of one of their buildings, and for the financial 
aid given the Institute. 
The closing exercises took place at Powell Chapel on Friday 
evening at 8 o’clock. Dr. Howard of the First Cumberland Pres- 
byterian Church delivered the address to the Honor Roll Class. 
The faculty divided the work as follows: 
James L. Brooks, Conductor—Primary Methods, Grammar, 
Rhetorie,. Civil Government. 
W. H. Cook, Seeretary—U. 8S. History, Physiology, Agricult- 
ure, Bookkeeping, Physics. 
C. P. Jester—Arithmetic, School Management, Algebra, 
Pedagogy.

STATE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED 
TEACHERS, UNION CITY. 
June 8, Three Weeks. 
Sir: The following report of the State Institute for the 
eolored teachers of West Tennessee, held at Union City June 8 
to 26, 1903, is hereby respectfully submitted. 
The Institute opened promptly on the morning of the day 
appointed with a large number of representative citizens present 
to show their appreciation and to extend greetings to the faculty 
and student teachers of the Institute. As there were no appli- 
cants for the secondary course the time was given wholly to pri- 
mary work. 
A program having been previously arranged by the faculty 
the work was carried on from day to day on the plan of a well 
regulated school. On each day the topics to be discussed in the 
next recitation or lecture were announced and the members of 
the Institute showed commendable zeal in preparing for the next 
day’s work, bringing up those points which they had found most 
difficult to understand or to teach. It was made the aim of the 
recitation not only to teach the subject matter, but to exemplify 
those methods of instruction which were deemed the most effect- 
ive and the most widely practicable in the country schools with 
their limited facilities. One period a day was given to Peda- 
gogy, with Page’s Theory and Practice of Teaching as.a basis. 
Superintendent P. L. Harned of Clarksville, representing 
the State Superintendent, favored us with one lecture on school 
law. Prof. Don L. Milum of Fulton also visited the Institute 
and gave an interesting talk on character building. Prof. W. A. 
Singleton of Fulton and Prof. T. L. Johnson of Martin gave us 
one lecture each on subjects of practical importance to the teach- 
ers. Superintendent J. M. Moore of Obion County visited the 
Institute frequently and contributed much to its suceess. A 
number of ministers and leading teachers of this: section of the 
State visited the Institute, but very little time was consumed in 
listening to speeches of a general character. The closing exer- 
eises were held at one of the churches of the city on the evening

of the last day, at which time resolutions were adopted commend- 
ing the work done and expressing the thanks of the teachers 
and the citizens generally to Hon. S. A. Mynders for having 
placed the Institute within their reach, thus giving renewed 
stimulus to the work of education in this part of the State. I am 
glad to bear testimony to the faithful work of my associate in- 
structors, Professors B. K, Sampson and EB. L. Honesty.

STATE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED 
TEACHERS, COLUMBIA. 
June 15 to July 3, 1903. 
Str—I hereby transmit for your inspection my report of the 
State Peabody Institute, held in the Colored High School build- 
ing at Columbia, from June 15 to July 8, 1903. 
The institute was opened promptly on the morning of the 
15th, in accordance with your published circular of announce- 
ment. Hach member of the faculty was in his place. The insti- 
tute first listened to an address of welcome by his Honor, Mr. E. 
Yeost, the Mayor of Columbia. The address was well received 
and loudly applauded. Response by Dr. F. G. Smith, conductor 
of the institute. The address of welcome on the part of the 
teachers of Maury County was given by Sampson Brown. 
His words of welcome were full of friendship, and the teachers 
were made to feel that they had fallen in the midst of friends 
Response by Prof. C. B. Lowe, a member of the faculty. Rev. B.- 
Frierson delivered the welcome address in behalf of the preach- 
ers, the business men and the citizens. Rev. Frierson is an 
eloquent divine of the ‘‘old school,” and his fervid oratory was 
pleasing and helpful. Response by Prof. A. T, Hill. The morn- 
ing of the second day witnessed the beginning of institute work 
proper. The program below will indicate plainly the faculty 
and the division of the work. 
Instruction. 
I wish to commend most heartily the character of the in- 
struction given in this institute. It was of a superior.kind. It 
merited and received the unanimous approval of the entire insti- 
tute. This being the first State Institute ever held in Columbia, 
some apprehension was felt as to how its establishment would 
be received by the colored teachers. The conductor was, there- 
fore, very anxious that the faculty should bring to the institute 
the best scholarship and most thorough preparation on the vari- 
ous subjects that they were to teach. This was thought necessary 
in order to make a good impression for proficiency from the very 
lu
-P-A-G-E-167
—162— 
start, and thus to win the confidence of the institute. This 
point was emphasized in all correspondence, and as a result the 
teachers received better instruction and some members of the 
faculty increased their reputations as expert teachers. 
Puncruatiry. 
One of the most noticeable features of the institute was the 
prompt attendance of the teachers. Not a few of the teachers 
lived many miles distant, and it required some effort and per- 
sonal] sacrifice to drive through the country and reach the school 
building by roll call. But the teachers discovered that 8:30 
meant 8:30 with the faculty, and an important lesson in punctual- 
ity was learned. 
Primary Work. 
Your appointment of a teacher to give the institute some 
instruction in primary methods was wise and proved very bene- 
ficial. This was a new feature in colored institutes, and the 
work of Mrs. Trimble received the highest commendations from 
all Her work was well planned and faithfully executed. 
Hosprrairy. 
The teachers and citizens of Columbia won the esteem and 
friendship of the faculty and visiting teachers by the royal way 
in which they entertained the institute. Reception after recep- 
tion was given, and everything was done to make our stay agree- 
able and its recollection pleasant. 
Pupiic ADDRESSES. 
At all educational gatherings, conventions, etc., many 
prominent men can be found who expect to be called on fora 
speech, and it is sometimes both delightful and instructive to 
listen to some of them. Rather than subject the regular program 
of recitations to interruptions, the faculty fixed upon Friday of 
each week, from 11:30 to 12:30, as the time for these addresses. 
The following persons addressed the institute: Rev. J. T. Gil- 
more, Rev. W. N. DeBerry, Dr. J. C. Quinn, Prof. J, H. Kelley, 
Prof. W. H. Johnson, Rev. W. H. Young, Rev. Shatteen, Rev. 
J.C. Lawrence, Prof. W. M. Bell and Rev. Shelby. The insti- 
tute was also honored with an address from our State Superin- 
tendent, Capt. S. A. Mynders. °*

CoMMITTEE or ARRANGEMENTS. 
I cannot close this report without a word of praise and 
thanks to Profs. A. T. Morrell, A. J. Armstrong, and Prof. W. C.

institute. The success of the institute depended very largely

Resolved, That we hereby acknowledge the debt of thanks we 
owe our faculty, who by their teaching, example and scholarship 
have benefited us and stimulated us to higher ideals.

STATE INSTITUTE FOR COLORED 
TEACHERS, KNOXVILLE. 
June 23, Five Weeks. 
Knoxvuiz, Tenn., Aug. 10, 1903. 
Hon. 8. A. Mynders: 
Dear Sir—I have the honor to report to you our summer 
normal term, which was known as Knoxville College Summer 
School and East Tennessee Institute for Colored Teachers. The 
school was in session from June 23 to July 31. The corps of in- 
structors was as follows: 
Institute Conductor—R. W. MeGranahan, President Knox- 
ville College. 
Psychology, Pedagogy, Civil Government and History of 
Tennessee—J. B. Work, Knoxville College. 
Mathematics, Geography and School Law—C. W. Cansler, 
Knoxville City Schools. 
‘English—Wm. G. Kennedy, Knoxville College. 
Drawing, Reading, Physiology and U. 8. History—W. H. 
Singleton, City Schools, Chattanooga. 
Musie—Miss L. V. Childers, Knoxville College. 
Manual Training and Physics—Harold Russell, Annapolis, 
Md., City Schools. 
Chemistry—H. W. Speer, Knoxville College. 
Physical Culture—Miss E. C. Lapsley, Chattanooga City 
Schools. 
Basketry — Miss Alice Burris, Henderson, N. C., Normal Col- 
lege. 
The course of lectures given was the most notable feature of 
the institute. The Summer School of the South in session at the 
same time at the University of Tennessee made it possible to se- 
cure the best talent of the land. The list of lecturers included 
th following: 
Hon. 8. A. Mynders, State Superintendent of Tennessee, two 
lectures. 
Prof. Sam. E. Hill, Superintendent of Knox County, one 
lecture.
-P-A-G-E-172
—167— 
Dr. Lewis B. Moore, Howard University, six lectures. 
Dr. Liberty H. Bailey, Cornell University, two lectures. 
Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, Atlanta University, six lectures. 
Dr. Wm. G. Frost, Berea College, one lecture. 
Prof. Kelley Miller, Howard University, five lectures. 
Prof. J. H. Phillips, Superintendent of Schools, Birming- 
ham, Ala., two lectures. 
Geo. W. Carver, Tuskegee, Ala., six lectures. 
Dr. E. G. Murphy, Montgomery, Ala., one lecture. 
Prof. P. P. Claxton, University of Tennessee, one lecture. 
Prof. T. Gilbert Pearson, State Normal School of North Car- 
olina, two lectures. 
President C. W. Dabney, University of Tennessee, one lec- 
ture. 
Mrs. Nellie Kedzie Jones, Berea, Ky., one lecture. 
Miss Celestia Parrish, Georgia State Normal School, one lec- 
ture. 
Hon. L. D. Harvey, Madison, Wis., one lecture. 
Prof. Calloway, Tuskegee, Ala., one lecture. 
Dr. Henry R. Sanford, New York, five lectures. 
The enrollment reached 191, teachers coming from seven 
States. The attendance at the lectures included many who did 
not enroll. 
Of the $776 expended for the summer school and institute, 
$100 was given from the State through the State Superintend- 
ent; $50 was given from Knox County through Supt. 8. E. Hill; 
$115 was received from fees, and the balance of $511 was provid- 
ed by Knoxville College. : 
Secondary certificates were issued to sixteen persons who 
passed a satisfactory examination. 
A teachers’ parliament met and discussed subjects of special 
interest to teachers. A spirit of earnestness prevailed among the 
teachers and there was a manifest eagerness to secure from the 
classes and the lectures those things that would be needed to im- 
prove the teaching rather than simply to secure a certificate. 
The following resolutions were adopted by the institute: 
‘We, the teachers of the summer school of Knoxville Col- 
lege, representing different States and sections, do adopt the 
following as our declaration of principles:
-P-A-G-E-173
—168— 
1. We do declare ourselves in full sympathy and accord 
with the movement now spreading all over the Southern States 
for better teachers, better schools and a longer school term. We 
believe that money expended in the edueation of its children is 
the best investment that the State can make. 
We believe that the South will only share in the national 
prosperity of other sections of our country in the proportion 
that it gives opportunity within its borders. We appreciate the 
burden under which the South has labored in the education of 
its citizens since the Civil War and recall with pleasure the fact 
that every attempt heretofore made in the South to place the 
burden of the education of the colored children exclusively upon 
the colored people has failed to receive the support or encourage- 
ment of the best citizens of the South. 
2. Believing that one of the first great needs of our section 
is teachers trained along proper lines, we endorse the idea of 
summer schools for the proper training and education of the 
teachers who as has often been expressed are the school. We be- 
lieve that more attention should be given to psychology and child- 
study, to pedagogy and the proper methods of presenting the 
subjects taught in school, to manual training and nature study, 
and believe that back of it all the teachers should possess a broad 
and thorough scholarship for efficient and effective work. 
We pledge ourselves to devote part of our time to attending 
some summer school each year, whenever possible, for the better 
preparation of ourselves for our work and to encourage others to 
do so, and to give ourselves such professional training as will 
cause the public to subject our profession to the same differentia- 
tion of other professions. 
3. Knoxville College, by reason of its superb location, its 
situation in a mountainous and healthful region, its location at 
the seat of the great Summer School of the South, and the advan- 
tage it offers in the lecturers who come to it from the Summer 
School of the South, and its excellent corps of instructors, is an 
ideal place for a great summer school for colored teachers, and 
has met in a most excellent way the demand for such a school. 
‘We endorse the work of this summer school and commend it to all 
who are striving for a higher excellence in their professional 
work.
-P-A-G-E-174
—169— 
4. We endorse the administration in Tennessee of State Su- 
perintendent S. A. Mynders. From all that we have seen of him 
and have heard of him we believe that through his efforts the 
cause of education will receive an impetus in the State of Ten- 
nessee. We are proud of him and the ‘‘educational Governor’’ 
under whom he serves. 
5. We feel under obligations to Dr. Charles W. Dabney and 
Prof. P. P. Claxton for their services in securing for us many of 
the lecturers who have come to us from the Summer School of 
the South. 
6. Finally, we tender our thanks to those lecturers who have 
visited us and whose words have been so helpful and inspiring. 
Many have made sacrifices to come and have come in spite of 
other demands upon their time. They have recognized us in 
these lectures as fellow teachers and co-workers in the cause of 
education and have given to us the best results of their research 
and experience. With them we shall continue to labor for the 
spread of the gospel of education and shall strive to create such a 
sentiment in our different fields of labor as will cause the educa- 
tion of its children to be the first care of the State.

REPORTS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
Cunton, Tenn., Aug. 1, 1908. 
Supt. 8. A. Mynders, Nashville, Tenn.: 
Dear Sir—I herewith hand you the report of our County In- 
stitute which was held at Clinton from July 13 to July 24. The 
institute work was principally done by Prof. H. B. Alexander of 
Fayetteville, Tenn. This was, without doubt, the greatest educa- 
tional gathering ever held in Anderson County. On the second 
Wednesday of the Normal we had a combined directors’ and ed- 
ucational mass meeting. Supt. S. A. Mynders was present and 
addressed at least 400 people on ‘‘The Educational Outlook in 
Tennessee.’ The meeting was addressed also by Chancellor 
James A. Tate. As a result of this meeting the people are tak-. 
ing renewed energy. Everybody is demanding better schools. 
The teachers are more determined than ever before, and J thinix 
they will do the best work they have ever done. 
I have sueceeded in getting three schools thrown into one at 
both Briceville and at Coal Creek. At other places I have in- 
fluenced the directors to discard small and weak schools, thereby 
giving their strength to other schools.

  I am glad to say that the schools just at the present time are 
in a better condition than they have been in several years. 
It has never before been the custom to visit the schools in 
this county, but I have visited every school in the county once, 
and some of them twice, and gave an address of encouragement 
and advice to both teachers and pupils. And I am glad to say 
that reports came to me from pupils and teachers that the schools 
were improved much thereby. I noticed very particularly the 
kind of instruction given and how it was presented; took 
notes of everything and then lectured the teachers in the in- 
stitute. 
Our first institute was held in August and was the best ever 
held in the county, and resolutions to that effect were passed by
-P-A-G-E-190
—185— 
the institute and published. The educational enthusiasm among 
the teachers, patrons and directors is causing quite a revolution 
in the schools and I think will be productive of much good. The 
teachers are becoming better qualified, and are demanding better 
salaries. More interest is being manifested in institutes than 
ever before, and in order to secure a full attendance I offer cer- 
‘tain per cent on all examinations. We hold our institutes in the 
different districts and get the people out as much as possible. 
Our colored teachers are very much interested now in insti- 
tute work and are having them every month. Their institutes 
are conducted by Prof. A. D. Cate, one of the instructors of the 
Cleveland colored public school, and is very enthusiastic in the 
work. : 
T hope to have a much better report next year as but little of 
my work appears in the report I have submitted. Our county is 
very grateful to the State Superintendent for past favors, as the 
county has been given three State Institutes. 
Very cordially yours, 
J. F. Harrison, 
County Superintendent. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
The annual teachers’ institute was held at Jacksboro from 
July 6 to July 15. The institute was one of the most profitable 
and interesting of any ever held in this county. A large number 
of teachers were in regular attendance, and paid close attention 
to the instructions given. The greater part also took part in the 
discussions that arose from time to time. A special feature was 
the reading class introduced by Mrs. D. R. Case. The class was 
composed of children ranging from 5 to 9 years of age. They 
brought their books and Mrs. Case conducted a recitation, show- 
ing by actual example the methods best adapted to primary 
classes. 
Arithmetic was taken up by Prof. D. R. Case on each day of 
the Normal. Prof. Case is a master of Mathematics, and made
-P-A-G-E-191
~-186— 
a splendid exposition of the subject. Prof. Case also gave in- 
struction in Geography and Grammar. Prof. G. B. Brown and 
Supt. Jennings gave instruction in History. 
Pedagogy, Advanced Reading and Physiology were handled 
by Prof. Wm. L. Stooksbury. Prof. Stooksbury has had long 
and successful experience in all grades of school work, and has 
also traveled extensively. His lectures and methods were of the 
best and his presence and interest were the most profitable fea- 
tures of the Normal work. 
In addition to the regular institute work three high class en- 
tertainments were given during the week. On Wednesday even- 
ing Dr. L. E. Prentiss delivered his inspiring lecture, ‘‘An Open 
Vision,’ to a large audience. Thursday evening Chancellor Jas. 
A. Tate of Harriman, in his brilliant style, delivered a superb 
address on ‘‘Christian Education.’’ On Friday evening the Jel- 
lico Concert Company gave the most delightful musical and elo- 
cutionary entertainment ever rendered in Jacksboro. The com- 
pany is composed of Mrs. Maud Yeager Harkness, Miss Lillian 
Jones, Messrs. Y. P. and Homer Rodeheaver. 
During the institute a Teachers’ Association was organized 
and places and dates arranged for the district meetings to be held 
during the school term. .We are looking forward to a prosperous 
and successful school year. There were ninety applicants ex- 
amined, and eighty-seven teachers’ licenses issued.

County Superintendent. 
CANNON COUNTY. 
The Cannon County Teachers’ Institute for white teachers 
was held in the courthouse at Woodbury beginning June 29, 
1903, and continuing five days. Seventy teachers were enrolled 
and we had a very good attendance throughout the entire time. 
We had as our instructors Prof. J. B. Clark and Supt. L. E. 
Summers of Warren County, and Prof. Andrew McClellan of 
Rutherford County. These all did most excellent work, which 
met the approval of all the teachers..

Prof. 8. A. Link of Nashville was furnished by the State 
Superintendent, and we can truthfully say of his work that it was 
good, and to show our appreciation of him we would say to the 
State Superintendent we would be pleased to have him with us 
again next year. 
Our motto in Cannon County is: To have better teachers 
and fewer schools.

CHESTER COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my annual report for the scholastic year 
just closing. The school year has been a most prosperous one 
and I am highly pleased with the results. The teachers are be- 
coming more cognizant of their duties and responsibilities. They 
are studying the great school problem, reading educational jour- 
nals and attending all our county and district institutes. 
In my annual examination the work is extended so as to ne- 
cessitate a more comprehensive reading by the teachers. The 
“‘keepers’’ are fast being relegated and the progressive, practical 
teachers are taking their places. . 
Libraries are being established in our rural schools and the 
teachers, pupils and patrons are seeing the great benefits de- 
' vived from them. 
My annual institute for white teachers was held in the G. 
R. C. College building June 30 to July 4. About seventy-five 
teachers were enrolled. An interesting and profitable program 
was discussed. The teachers were loud in their praises of the 
work. I am greatly indebted to Capt. J. W. Carroll, Profs. G. 
G. Butler, J. W. Stewart, I. B. Day, C. Brooks and others for the 
help given me. 
The colored schools of the county are in good condition and 
the teachers are doing fine work. They are very attentive at all 
our school meetings. 
I am anticipating a great improvement in our rural schools 
when the school and civil district law becomes operative. There 
have been too many small districts for any benefit to the major- 
ity of children. 
With few exceptions the past year has been the banner one 
in the history of the county. The teachers are among the best in 
the State. C. B. Isams,. 
Superintendent.

CLAY COUNTY. 
You will find my first annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1903. I am a little late on account of the negligence of 
directors to make their reports. This report is as accurate as I 
could make it from data at hand. Our institute met at Celina, 
Tennessee, June 29 and closed July 4. Our conductor was Prof. 
J. T. Stamps of Macon County. He was assisted by Profs. W. P. 
Bean, Sam Birdwell, B. L. Wright, C. M. Copeland, B. C. Led- 
better and myself. We can truthfully say that our institute was 
one of success ; the teachers were all interested in the work. I am 
glad to say that the cause of education is gradually advancing in 
Clay County. I am doing my best for the young and rising gen- 
eration, and expect to continue. We hold our meetings monthly, 
known as the Clay County Teachers’ Association, and I find 
much benefit derived from them. I am visiting schools and di- 
rectors and will continue the work until I have been in every 
school in the county and seen every school director of my county. 
I have urged the directors to fully discharge their duty. We 
trust the day is not far distant when the opportunity of obtain- 
ing a good, practical education shall be placed in the hands of 
every child in Clay County and the State of Tennessee. 
I trust the members of the County Court will stand nobly 
by the school interest in the future, as they have ever done in the 
past. : 
May God speed the day when the people of Clay County will 
view this subject in its true light. I am making a strong effort to 
consolidate the schools in order to lengthen the term. 
Wishing you much success in the great cause of education, I 
am as ever, your friend.

COCKE COUNTY. 
The Annual Normal Institute for Cocke County was held 
from July 13 to 18, and never before in our county has so lively 
an interest been manifested in our public school work. Our in-

Coffee County Teachers’ Institute met at Manchester June 
29, 1903. Prof. J. I. Ensey was made Chairman and Prof. 8. L. 
Phillips was elected Seeretary. The program that had been ar- 
ranged by the Executive Committee was carried out. Forty-two 
Coffee County and eighteen visiting teachers were in attend- 
ance. Although the County Superintendent had to leave the 
institute the second day on account of sickness, the institute was a 
success. A resolution was adopted authorizing the Superintend- 
ent to invest the surplus funds on hand belonging to the insti- 
tute in a library for the teachers. The outlook for good schools 
in Coffee County is encouraging.

The teachers’ institute met at Decaturville July 6, and was 
in session five days. The institute was conducted by Prof. Don J. 
Milam of Fulton. Prof. Milam is a splendid institute instructor, 
and we are very thankful to the State for sending him. He was 
the principal instructor, assisted by Profs. A. M. Smith, J. C. 
Duek and Robert L. Sutton. 
Our enrollment was sixty-three, forty of whom were cexam- 
ined and passed. Some say this was the best institute ever held 
in Decatur County. 
On Tuesday we organized a Teachers’ Association, and all 
seem to be better prepared to enter school work this year than in 
former years.

teachers took a deep interest in them. 
Prof. James D. Rives, Sr., delivered several able lectures on

FAYETTE COUNTY. 
After conferring with many of the leading teachers in the 
county it seemed advisable to hold a County Institute for Fay- 
ette County, although such an institute had not been held for ten 
or fifteen years. 
Almost every day of the institute session brought rain, ren- 
dering attendance very difficult, yet a small but earnest band met 
with remarkable regularity and manifested great interest in the 
work. 
We are deeply grateful to the State Superintendent, for send- 
ing us two excellent instructors, who did us very efficient work, 
also for his own timely visit with the earnest talk to our institute 
and his able address to the public. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the institute was held under 
great difficulty, still all seem agreed that much good has resulted. 
The teachers expressed themselves as much benefited, public in- 
terest is greatly increased, and all seem encouraged. Arrange- 
ments have been completed and a Teachers’ Professional Library 
will be opened in the Superintendent’s office in August or Sep- 
tember. 
While I commend above the high order of work done by the 
instructors sent to us by the State Superintendent, I would not 
neglect to express my high appreciation of the very efficient work
-P-A-G-E-205

done by our own county teachers also. The following resolutions 
were unanimously adopted: 
Resolved, That we fully endorse State Superintendent S. A. 
Mynders in every feature of the work he has undertaken for the 
advancement of educational interest in the State, and pledge him 
our undivided support in the accomplishment of these ends. 
2. That we extend our thanks to him for the interest he has 
manifested in Fayette County, for his visit and for the most ex- 
cellent discourse delivered to the teachers and citizens of this 
county. 
3. That we approve most heartily of the instructors he has 
sent to us; and also the able manner in which they have eon- 
ducted this institute. 
4, That we earnestly request the aid and cooperation of the 
schoo! directors of this county in advancing the interest of the 
public school system. 
5. That we appreciate most fully the kindness of the Board 
of Directors of the Somerville High School Building for grant- 
ing us the use of same; of the county officials for the use of the 
courthouse, and of the citizens of the town for the hospitable 
manner in which they have entertained us. 
6. That we fully endorse the work of our County Superin- 
tendent, the fair and impartial manner in which he has conduct- 
ed this institute, and that we will aid him as far as in our power 
to better the work done by our own county teachers.

GIBSON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my annual report and the report of the 
Gibson County Teacher’s Normal Institute, which met at the 
courthouse in Trenton on Monday morning, May 25, 1903: 
The institute was under the general supervision of the 
County Superintendent as conductor, and taught by Dr. A. L. 
Peterman of Nashville, as chief instructor, ably assisted by many 
of Gibson County’s most progressive teachers. The purpose of 
this institute as stated in the announcements sent out by the 
Superintendent was to make a rapid review of the public school 
branches; to improve the methods of teaching and to raise the 
standard of education in our schools. This was one of the most 
harmonious working institutes ever held in the county. 
Dr. Peterman showed himself master of the situation in his 
various discussions before the institute, always capturing the 
hearts of the teachers present. His work was highly appreciated 
both by the teachers and the citizens of the town and country. 
A daily program was printed and carried out almost to the 
letter. The normal as designed by the Superintendent, second- 
ed by a large majority of the teachers, partook more of the 
“‘practical school features,’’ and less of the ‘‘entertainment fea- 
tures’’ than hitherto. Our teachers attended the institute for 
work, and not for entertainment, and hence our institute was a 
marked success; one of the best in the history of the county. 
The enrollment was 137, not so large as it was last year, but
-P-A-G-E-208
—203— 
equally as enthusiastic. Many of our teachers attended the State 
institutes at Jackson, Union City, Huntingdon and Dickson. 
At night, June 2, Dr. Peterman lectured to a large and ap- 
preciative audience on ‘‘In Black and White,’’ in which he very 
dexterously, logically and philosophically discussed the ‘‘nepro 
problem.’’ June 3 he lectured before the institute on ‘The 
Pleasures and Pains of Teaching,’ treating the subject very 
graphically and pleasingly. 
On June 1 the institute was favored with the presence and 
addresses from the State Superintendent and Supt. G. R. Me- 
Gee, both pioneer pedagogues of Gibson County, whom our peo- 
ple proudly welcome at any time. 
The following resolutions were read and adopted just be- 
fore the institute adjourned: 
We, the members of the Gibson County Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, in annual convention assembled at Trenton, Tennessee, do 
hereby adopt the following resolutions: 
1. We extend to Dr. A. L. Peterman of Nashville our sincere 
thanks for his deep interest manifested in the teachers of our 
association, and for his valuable services rendered in giving in- 
struction throughout our session. 
2. To the citizens of Trenton for their genial hospitality, and 
to the young ladies and little girls who so delightfully enter- 
tained with their music and recitations, we extend our thanks. 
3. We thank our Superintendent for his able services as 
conductor, and also our secretary, the instructors, and all others 
who have contributed in any way to the interest and success of 
the association.

GILES COUNTY. 
I hereby submit my report of Giles County Institute held at 
Pulaski from June 15 to June 29. This has been termed the most 
satisfactory institute held in the county for many years. We 
used the lecture and method plan combined. I never saw greater 
interest, nor more enthusiasm. This interest and enthusiasm was 
brought about by our monthly teachers’ meetings prior to the 
institute. A few of the leading teachers determined to aid me in 
raising the standard of teachers and to aid you in developing a 
school interest generally over the State. To say that they suc- 
ceeded is but to give them what is justly theirs. I am greatly 
indebted to Profs. Ed. R. Cox; 8. R. Logue, W. B. Scott, W. D. 
Aymett, R. P. Collins, E. C. McCormick, Ed Ingrum, M. T. New- 
man, Floyd Ranck, 8S. A. Moore, C. H. Walker and Miss Lizzie 
Abernathy, Mrs. Geo. Witt and Mrs. Martin Coker for services 
rendered. Each vied with the other in doing all he or she could 
for the instruction and pleasure of the institute. Your visit and 
address was quite favorably received and resulted in much good 
to the cause of education in our county. I am sure I am safe in 
saying that things have an upward tendency educationally in 
Giles.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
The Grainger County Teachers’ Institute met at Rutledge 
July 20, 1908, and continued one week. The institute was con- 
ducted by Prof. Jasper C. Barnes, Chair of Pedagogy, Maryville, 
College, Tennessee. John E. Kinsland, Esq., did our teachers 
some good by his lecture and addresses during the week. Mr. 
Kinsland has taught for a number of years in different parts of 
‘Yennessee and in other States. He is a member of the bar at this 
place. 
Prof. J. E. Wickham, formerly of Holbrook Normal Col- 
lege, Fountain City, Tennessee, was worth much to our cause dur- 
ing the Normal. . 
We had a number of visitors from our leading colleges pres- 
ent at different times during the week. 
Our Normal was a success in every particular. Every teach- 
er who teaches in the county this year was present. All teachers 
took the examination. All those who made an average of 90 and 
did not fall below 70 in any study will be excused from the ex- 
amination next year, provided they take the course of reading as 
outlined by our Teachers’ Reading Course. Our people seem 
to think, by the efforts of our State Superintendent in his cam- 
paign of education in Tennessee, that we surely will have bet- 
ter schools, longer terms and greater results. Our schools opened 
first Monday in August. I will begin visiting the first of Sep-

The morning of the first day was spent in organizing; Mr. W. 
R. Campbell being elected Chairman, and Miss Lou Henley, Sec- 
retary. After a few speeches from various teachers and an out- 
line of the work for the week by the County Superintendent, the 
institute was adjourned till 1 o’elock p. m.

The evening session, as were all the sessions, was devoted to 
real, faithful, painstaking work. The whole body was a working 
body and each and every one performed his or her work well. 
The faithful and efficient teaching of Mr. Dillon deserves special 
mention. Miss Murphey, sent us by State Superintendent Myn- 
ders, also did good and faithful work in each of her departments. 
Only ten of the teachers attending were compelled to take the 
full examination at the close of the week’s work. Of these, eight 
were licensed to teach. A number of the other teachers took a 
part of the examination, and all showed marked progress. 
The young ladies of Tracy City, assisted by the local teach- 
ers, gave a reception and entertainment on Saturday evening to 
the visiting teachers. The large auditorium of Shook School 
Building, where all the mectings were held, was crowded, and all 
enjoyed the music, songs, recitations and refreshments. 
‘While the number of teachers in attendance was small, yet 
the quality of work was just such as was needed, and the interest 
manifested was never greater.

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
The Hamblen County Normal Institute for 1903 was marked 
by the interest manifested by so many teachers. It was attended 
by a larger number than any previous year, and the work ac- 
complished during the institute was encouraging. The work 
was conducted by Prof. Cartright of Blountville, and Prof. Grif- 
' fitts of Lenoir City.

HAMILTON COUNTY. 
You will find enclosed my annual report of the public schools 
of Hamilton County. While our educational condition is far 
from the ideal, yet we think the educational sentiment is be- 
coming stronger from year to year, and our schools are grad- 
ually growing, both in public esteem and efficiency. 
The report will show an increase in the teacher’s salary, in 
the length of term, and in number enrolled. 
Our teachers are putting forth every effort for self improve- 
ment. This year we had thirty who attended the Summer School 
at Knoxville and elsewhere. We have a course of professional 
reading for our county teachers and almost every one takes an 
interest in the work. 
‘We have no surplus of teachers, hence no underbidding and 
no settlement wrangles over who shall teach the schools. 
We held a two weeks’ institute in Chattanooga, beginning 
June 1. Our faculty, composed of Prof. 8. G. Gilbreath, Dr. Ju- 
nius Jordan, Dr. L. W. Fike, Mrs. A. E. Bell, Mrs. J. H. Phillips 
and Miss Emily Hughes, was all that could be desired. Each 
teacher could not have been excelled in the work assigned to him 
or her. We had one hundred and eleven teachers present. We 
also held a two weeks’ institute for the colored teachers, begin- 
ning June 15. Our instructors, Prof. W. J. Hale and Miss Judia 
Jackson, did a high type of work. Sixty teachers were present. 
‘We are working upon the plan of campaign mapped out at — 
our Edueational Conference held in Nashville last April. 
During the present scholastic year three small schools have 
been consolidated and by next year we hope to be able to report 
several more. 
Educational conferences and parents’ meetings are being 
held throughout the county and a larger eprollment and better 
attendance will most surely be the result. 
‘We have introduced manual training into our suburban 
schools, under the guidance of a supervisor, and with the hearty 
approval it has thus far met, both on the part of the teachers,
-P-A-G-E-219
—212— 
pupils and patrons, we feel warranted in predicting it will be a 
complete success. 
In conclusion permit me again to thank you for the aid you 
furnished us in cur Summer Normal; also for your presence and 
helpful address delivered before our teachers and directors.

HANCOCK COUNTY. 
I herewith subrait annual report of Hancock County. Be- 
ing among the hills of East Tennessee, blessed with pure water 
and excellent health, we are still moving upward in the line of 
education. 
Our schools are in very good condition. The greatest trouble
-P-A-G-E-220
—2138— 
with which we meet is waut of more money, fewer schools, bet- 
ter houses and more worthy teachers. 
‘We have some good teachers in the public school work in 
this county. We have a number of young teachers who are not 
very well qualified, but I am glad to notice some improvement. 
Most of the teachers are alive to the times and are doing excellent 
work. 
‘We had a very successful institute at Sneedville, of six days’ 
duration, which was well attended and great interest was mani- 
fested by all teachers. 
‘We have the county divided into institute districts, and will 
hold one institute each month during school term. I am glad to | 
notice more interest being manifested by the patrons throughout 
the county in the public school.

HARDIN COUNTY. 
I send herewith my annual report. I have delayed to the 
limit in my endeavor to have it correct. You will find, if you 
compare closely with previous reports from Hardin County, that 
it varies considerably from them. Take, for instance, the average 
number of days taught last year and compare it with this year. 
Previous reports show that Hardin County had an average of 79 
days last year; I find the average for this year to be 63—a great 
reduction. Although the schools in Hardin County are in a de- 
plorable condition, yet I believe they are improving, and I 
believe if the previous report had been correctly made this year 
would show an improvement. I made an earnest effort to have 
all the teachers send in their abstracts, but. as many of the schools 
had already closed when I was elected I had no way to compel 
the teachers to make them, especially if they did not intend to 
teach in Hardin County again. 
I sent out a circular letter to each district clerk asking that 
they give the scholastic population as nearly accurate as possible, 
and also asking for the directors’ report. As a result I have, I 
believe, the most nearly correct report ever gotten out in our 
county. Out of 83 districts in our county 82 have sent in their 
scholasties; the one missing being a small district in the farthest 
corner of the county. Sixty-five made reports and those not 
making them, in nearly every case, saw me and made a verbal 
report. As a result of this I have been enabled to come very 
close to the correct number, kind and value of schoolhouses. 
You will notice that the value of our schoolhouses is placed at
-P-A-G-E-223
—216— 
$14,591 —a ridiculous sum. Our courthouse cost that much. Our 
jail is worth half of the amount. 
One great drawback to the schools of Hardin County is the 
summer school. It is customary in Hardin County to have a two- 
months’ school taught during July and August. If the district 
has enough money to operate three months, two months must be 
taught in summer and the other after cotton picking time—No- 
vember or December. By dividing our school term, short as it 
is anyway, we badly cripple our schools. I believe we can remedy 
this. My efforts shall be given along the line of uniformity of 
schools and terms, consolidation of weak schools, better teachers. 
In my examinations July 2 and 3, one-third of those taking 
the examinations failed. I intend to make the examinations more 
rigid all along till we have reached the proper standard. 
During August I intend to hold rallies at the various cen- 
ters in the county and try to educate the people up to the idea of 
better schools. 
The County Court at the July term made my salary $500, 
and influential members promised me $600 for next year. 
The various instructors paid more attention to methods than 
they did to cramming the teachers with facts. Many live issues 
were discussed. One evening was set apart for talks along the 
line of libraries and trained teachers. A library fund was es- 
tablished and the County Superintendent was authorized 
to purchase a course of reading for the teachers. Supt. P. 
L. Harned of Montgomery County addressed the teachers and 
many citizens on June 27. Special notice was given that on that 
day consolidation of schools and other live topics would be dis- 
eussed, and many directors and citizens were present. Prof. 
Harned ably handled the issues of the day and many went away 
feeling that our schools need improvement and that the way to 
improve them is along the line of consolidation of schools, better 
teachers, and a larger school fund. Although there were fewer 
teachers in attendance at the institute than for the past two years, 
yet there was a marked difference in the material. The teacher 
who is incompetent is fast disappearing in Hardin County.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
The Hawkins County Institute for white teachers was held at 
MeMinn Academy in Rogersville, beginning June 22 and closing 
June 30, 1908. The institute was conducted by the County Su- 
perintendent, who was ably assisted by Mrs. Gennie Mynders of 
Knoxville, Miss Lelia M. Jones, Mrs. Jennie Lyons, and Prof. 
W.C. Patton. Mrs. Mynders, whom you kindly sent to assist us, 
did excellent and quite satisfactory work. At the appointed time 
for her talks on Primary Methods we had many visitors, and 
great interest was manifested by both teachers and visitors. 
‘The institute for colored teachers was held at Swift Memo- 
rial Institute in Rogersville, beginning July 1 and closing July 4, 
1903. The institute was conducted by Rev. W. H. Franklin, 
Principal of Swift Memorial Institute. The teachers made good 
grades, showing much improvement in their work. 
Ninety white teachers were examined and certificates were is- 
sued to sixty-seven. Some young men and women not expecting 
to teach this year were examined. Twelve colored teachers were 
examined and certificates were issued to ten. 
‘We begin the new school year very much encouraged. I 
have endeavored to license the best teachers, and the directors 
have agreed to pay them better salaries. 
During our institute we organized a County Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation, which we hope will prove valuable to our educational 
work. Our teachers will have regular monthly meetings in dif- 
ferent parts of the county, and do more professional work this 
year than ever before. Our outlook is growing brighter.

HENDERSON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report of the annual teachers institute 
of Henderson County, which was held in the Lexington Normal 
College, June 22-30, 1903. The institute was under the super- 
vision of the County Superintendent as Conductor. Prof. A. G. 
Freed of the G. R. C., Henderson, and Prof. W. D. Dennison of 
the L. N. C., Lexington, were employed as instructors. Special 
credit is due the faculty for the excellent manner in which they 
rendered each day’s work. The valuable information and in- 
structions the teachers received from this institute will beyond a 
doubt result in much good for the schools of Henderson County 
and bear fruit a hundred fold in years yet to come. The teach- 
ers manifested a great interest, and at the close of the institute 
gave forth an expression in the form of resolutions as being 
highly pleased and greatly benefited by the work of the in- 
structors. 
Dr. A. E. Booth of the 8. N. U., Huntingdon, delivered an in- 
teresting address of valuable information before the institute on 
“Character Building.’? On Friday evening June 26, 1908, Dr.
-P-A-G-E-229
—222— 
J. M. Carter and Elder T. P. Clark delivered some interesting 
addresses during the week. 
Prof. W. M. Broom of Jackson conducted the institute for 
the colored teachers June 30 to July 6, in which he did good work 
for the colored teachers. 
Our schools as a whole are on an upward tendency, and it is 
evident that our teachers, school officers and patrons, will not 
cease to put forth every effort possible, until the public schools 
of Henderson County are second to none with her sister counties. 
The public school work this year has been the best. and most 
suecessful of any in the educational history of the county.

County Superintendent. 
HENRY COUNTY. 
The institute held in and for the county of Henry opened 
June 22, 1903, with eighty-two teachers present. In considera- 
tion of the fact that the State Institute was held so close by, at 
Huntingdon, and that some of the teachers were in attendance 
there, this was very flattering. 
The institute grew in numbers and interest from day to day, 
and the program was carried out with few exceptions. ‘The 
greatest disappointment came when it was known that our State 
Superintendent, Hon. S. A. Mynders, was unable to be with us. 
On Wednesday the institute adjourned to attend the educational 
rally at Huntingdon, the regular program being carried out that 
evening. 
Supt. P. L. Harned of Clarksville was with us in lieu of Hon. 
§. A. Mynders, and delivered two very interesting lectures, which 
were very much enjoyed by all present. 
The institute closed Thursday evening and the examination 
for teachers was held Friday and Saturday.

HOUSTON COUNTY. 
The Houston County Teachers’ Institute was held in the 
Erin High School Building, Erin, Tennessee, June 8 to 13, 1903, 
closing with examinations. The educational interest of Houston 
County is improving. The teachers took great interest in insti- 
tute work this year and they are more professional in their work, 
and many are holding schools for several terms in succession. 
We hold monthly meetings. Have arranged to establish a 
Teachers’ Library and organize an association.

JACKSON COUNTY. 
This report, as usual, is only approximately true; district 
clerks failing to make accurate reports, and Trustee failing to 
make his report according as directed (does not keep the money 
separate according to purpose), an accurate report need not be 
expected of Superintendent. We did not get our supplies in time 
for scholastic census to be taken in July. But we are glad of 
making even a slight gain in population. We are delighted that 
we can have a five-month school this year, instead of seventy-nine 
days. Our pro rata this year is $1.80—$1.50 last year, and some 
districts in debt: Indebtedness of those districts was what 
brought our average of school days down to seventy-nine. Some 
schools run one hundred and five days. 
Every one in Jackson County is jubilant over an increased 
school tax. Sorry, indeed, that we have neither a circulating li- 
brary nor a County High School. But thanks to kind Providence, 
every day grows brighter for the common cause of education in 
this county, and I believe it will more and more unto the perfect 
day. Our citizens realize more each day that the only hope of 
prosperity, happiness and good government is in the education, 
mentally, morally and spiritually of her youths. If we would 
bless our offspring, we must educate them. This can best be 
done through the public school system.

JAMES COUNTY. 
You will notice that twenty-four teachers were licensed last 
year and none examined. - My predecessor gave certificates with- 
out examination to those who had taught in the county the year 
previous and would attend the Peabody Institute at Cleveland 
at least five days. Nearly all the teachers attended. 
We held an institute five days in July at Ooltewah, conducted 
by C. K. Gallaher; 0. W. Johnson and myself assisting. The 
teachers are anxious that we get Prof. Gallaher next year. He 
gave general satisfaction. Many thanks to our State Superin- 
tendent for sending him. 
I gave an examination at close of institute and licensed most 
of the teachers. I examined the others at stated periods in Aug- 
ust and September. 
My report is approximately correct. I positively could not 
get all my reports from clerks, giving definite statistics. 
Schools are doing reasonably well. The greatest trouble now 
is a lack of comfortable houses and seats. , 
’ J. D. CAMPBELL,

JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
Our regular summer institute, which convened from June 
22 to 26, was beyond the average in point of interest. Some of 
the best teachers of our county were in attendance upon the Sum- 
mer School of the South at Knoxville, Tennessee, which lessened 
the attendance somewhat at our institute. But we had an en- - 
rollment of sixty-seven teachers in regular attendance and at 
least twenty more visiting teachers were present more or less 
throughout the sessions of the institute. 
I was exceedingly fortunate in securing the services of Prof.

F. M. Gill of Maryville, Tennessee, who was the principal in- 
structor of the institute. He is one of the ablest and most popu- 
lar men that has ever assisted in institute work in this county. 
There was one noticeable feature of our institute, and that 
was the large number of new teachers who were in attendance 
upon it. There were twenty-one who had never had any expe- 
rience as teachers and many more who had only one or two years’ 
experience as teachers. On the whole we had a very pleasant and 
profitable institute. 
There was no special division of work. I was assisted by 
Prof. F, M. Gill, Maryville, Tennessee, in the matter of instrue- 
tion. I was assisted in the examinations by Profs. Garrett and 
Sharp.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
Enclosed you will find my annual report. The school in- 
terest in Johnson County the past year has been reasonably sat- 
isfactory. There is plenty of room for improvement, but it is 
gradually getting better, as there is more interest shown by di- 
rectors and patrons. 
In June I held a two-weeks’ institute, conducted by Prof. 
W. W. Motney of the city schools of Knoxville, Tennessee. It 
was well attended and we had quite an interesting and profita- 
ble time. . 
A teachers’ association was organized and has been very well 
attended. I hope to make it very beneficial for the teachers of 
the county. : 
Summing it up as a whole we are progressing reasonably 
well on lines suggested by our worthy State Superintendent. 
Very respectfully, 
R. P. Donneuy, 
Superintendent Johnson County. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
In compliance with the requirements of law I herewith hand 
you annual report of the public schools of Knox County for the
-P-A-G-E-237
—230— 
year ending June 30, 1903. In submitting the same, I desire to 
eall your attention to some of the conditions of the schools of the 
county. The year 1902-3 was the most successful in the history 
of our present public school system. Never before was there 
such manifestation of interest on the part of not only the teach- 
ers, but also the school officials and school-going public. 
ENROLLMENT. 
This interest on the part of the teachers, officials and pa- 
trons had much to do with the increased registration which sur- 
passed all previous records. Of the 15,945 school children (dis- 
tricts outside of Knoxville), there were enrolled 10,529. This 
enrollment, taking into consideration the unfavorableness of sur- 
rounding conditions and the extreme of the maximum age limit, 
speaks well for the teachers and their efforts in bringing about 
this splendid result. 
INCREASE IN LENGTH OF TERM. 
The average length of term for schools of the county (city 
schools not considered) for the year is one hundred and twenty- 
three days. This shows an inerease of twenty-four days in two 
years, which comes as a result of painstaking care on the part of 
those having in charge the financial management of the schools 
and an increased school fund made possible by an increase in the 
tax levy (5 cents additional by County Court of 1902), and an 
adjustment of the scholastic population which, for many years 
on account of the padded census, had caused an unfair distribu- 
tion of school moneys among the districts of the county. Our 
school districts are in excellent financial shape and the outlook is 
favorable for even a longer term for the current year. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES. 
The compensation of the public school teacher has been and 
is now wholly out of proportion to the importance of his work. 
If we ever reach the time when all of our schools are taught by 
wide-awake and enthusiastic teachers we will be found paying 
them something in comparison with the worth of their work. Of
-P-A-G-E-238
—231— 
course, the teacher is not expected to teach for money alone, but 
if we are to attract and hold men and women of ambition to the 
duties of the teacher we must offer a sufficiency of money to pro- 
vide a competency of the necessities of life, thereby freeing them 
from straitened circumstances, thus leaving them unhandicapped 
with an opportunity for giving of their best to the work of their 
schools. 
The average salary for the last year was $35.33 for the rural 
teacher. This is but a slight increase, but shows the trend, and 
we hope the day is not far distant when we shall all be happy in 
a realization of our most ardent desire—proper remuneration of 
the teacher. 
PUPILS COMPLETING GRADES. 
For a number of years, there has been little or no attention 
given to the work of the higher grades. There has been lack of 
inducement and encouragement to pupils of the higher grades to 
complete the work of the secondary schools. We are glad to re- 
port development of interest in the grades of the secondary 
schools. Last year there were twenty-six pupils graduating from 
the secondary schools and more than one hundred from the pri- 
mary schools. ‘These numbers are not as large as they should be, 
but they are gratifying in view of the fact that until recently lit- 
tle or no interest has been given to this phase of the work. 
The custom of having a graduation exercise for each school 
district where there are graduates has been instituted. The ex- 
ercises of this day are looked forward to from the very begin- 
ning of the school year with eager anticipation by patrons and 
pupils alike. These exercises afford a mest excellent opportunity 
for bringing the people together on an occasion where the ques- 
tion of public schools is the feature of the day. In this way much 
good has been accomplished. The people are made acquainted 
with the purposes of the public schools, and the children are en- 
couraged to remain in school until the course is completed. 
SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. 
There were employed during the year in the public schools of 
the county 202 teachers. These teachers are reasonably well qual- 
ified and work faithfully in the performance of their duties.
-P-A-G-E-239
—232— 
There were schools taught in 151 houses. Of this number there 
are 31 secondary schools, 29 white and 2 colored, all of which did 
good work for a liberal patronage. The work of consolidation is 
progressing nicely. The idea is growing in favor, and before the 
beginning of another school year we shall be able to bring a num- 
ber of our weak schools together, which will increase their effi- 
ciency and decrease the running expense. 
Through the assistance of friends and the cooperation of lo- 
cal authorities, we are building a model rural school, which will 
be ready for occupancy about the first of November of this year. 
The school is situated near Concord, about fourteen miles from 
Knoxville, and when completed will be the first of the kind in 
Tennessee, and will have for its purpose the embodiment of those 
things which are intended to give realization to the ideas of 
school management as presented by the most progressive school 
men of the times. We hope to find the workings of this school a 
practical solution of many of the difficult school questions now 
confronting the men who have in charge the administration of 
school affairs. 
SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
The Summer School in session at the University of Tennes- 
see at Knoxville, June 23 to July 31, was, perhaps, the biggest 
educational gathering of the kind ever held in the South. By aid 
of a liberal appropriation made by the County Court of Knox 
County, the teachers of our county were given the privilege of 
this school without cost of registration fees. More than one hun- 
dred and sixty teachers availed themselves of the opportunity 
thus afforded and are now actively engaged as teachers in the 
schools of the county. The colored teachers were amply provided 
for at the Knoxville College. Their school was provided by State 
and eounty appropriations and through the efforts of Dr. Me- 
Grannahan, whose labors made the school an unprecedented suc- 
cess. 
These things with cther facts contained in statistical tables 
here attached tell of a year’s work which we believe to be well 
done. 
Our people are interested and we look forward to a suceess-
-P-A-G-E-240
—233— 
ful close of the year which is now open with flattering pros- 
pects. Respectfully submitted, 
Sam E. Hin, 
County Superintendent. 
To the Citizens of Knox County: 
Your attention is hereby called to a series of educational 
gatherings which have been arranged for different sections of the 
county for the benefit of the public schools, and your hearty eoop- 
eration is asked to make these meetings the success worthy of the 
cause whieh they represent. 
The object of these meetings is to afford the teachers, chil- 
dren and patrons of the county schools an opportunity to mingle 
with each other and to hear the discussion of current educational 
problems, thereby preparing them to better understand existing 
conditions and to more thoroughly appreciate suggestions for the 
betterment of our educational system. 
Some of the best men of Tennessee have agreed to address 
you at these meetings. Their consent to speak comes as a source 
of great encouragement. Among the list of speakers which have 
been engaged are the names of Gov..J. B. Frazier, Supt. 8. A. 
Mynders, Supt. 8. G. Gilbreath, ex-Gov. R. L. Taylor, Prof. P. P. 
Claxton, Hon. J. W. Caldwell, all of whom are well prepared not 
only to entertain but also to give much that will help us in the 
execution of the duties of life. 
Meetings will be held on the following dates at the following 
places: 
Thursday, September 24, New Prospect Church, Fourteenth 
District, for the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and Twenty- 
first Districts. 
Friday, October 9, Asbury Church, Seventeenth District, for 
the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Twenty-second, Twenty-third and 
Twenty-sixth Districts. 
Saturday, October 17, Beaver Dam Church, Seventh Dis-
-P-A-G-E-241
—234— 
trict, for the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, 
Eighteenth and Twentieth Districts. 
Friday, October 28, Ball Camp Church, Nineteenth District, 
for the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth and Nineteenth 
Districts. 
Programs will be made out in advance of each meeting and 
will be made up of such things as will best promote the develop- 
ment of interest in public school work. 
It is a sincere wish that an individual responsibility for the 
success of these meetings will be realized by all, that no citizen 
will be absent except for such reasons as would naturally excuse 
them from the duties of every-day life. All should feel a person- 
al responsibility and give of their best toward making the meet- 
ing of each of the above divisions a pronounced success. 
It is suggested that the citizens of each section where a meet- 
ing is to be held call a preliminary meeting for the purpose of 
appointing a committee whose duty it shall be to look after mat- 
ters of detail. These gatherings will be all-day affairs and, of 
course, the hospitality of our people will be shown in abundant 
preparation for dinner, which will be served on the grounds. 
Let us begin work at once. Programs and announcements will 
follow later. 
Again asking all for a full measure of cooperation, I am 
Very truly yours, 
Sam E. HI, 
County Superintendent of Schools.     
LAKE COUNTY. 
No county institute was held in Lake County this year. Our 
teachers attended the State Institute at Union City, which is in 
an adjoining county. The time was doubtless spent more profita- 
bly there than could have been done in a county institute.

LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
I send herewith my annual report with my regrets for the 
long delay in its preparation, which was caused by several cireum- 
stances. Jn the first place, the new school district Jaw (the wis- 
est piece of legislation enacted in Tennessee in years) seemed to 
bewilder the directors, notwithstanding I sent them plain and ex- 
plicit written directions about how to proceed, and I was com- 
pelled to send their reports back to some of them more than once 
or twice, and failed then to get some of them right. Some seemed 
to think that as, on the passage of the new law, ‘‘Othello’s oceu- 
pation would be gone;’’ they were no longer responsible, while 
others seemed to be controlled by the inherent ‘‘cussedness’’ of 
human nature, and did not care a cent. These and other draw- 
backs have compelled me to evolve some portions of my report. 
from my “‘inner conseiousness.’?  * / 
Then for the past week I have been sick, and am quite feeble 
now ; so much so, indeed, that if at the conclusion of this labor of 
love, the County Court of this county were to offer me $50 extra 
as partial compensation for the extra trouble I have had (which 
they should do but will not), I would not have strength enough to 
refuse it. There are some errors in it, I am sure, but I can find 
no way to correct them. For instance, in the financial report, 
which you know is furnished me by the County Trustee, it ap- 
pears that there was paid out during the last scholastic year for 
‘teachers’ salaries,’’ the sum of $20,216.31. This, I am sure, is 
not correct, being much more than was actually paid them. From 
the best light before me, it must have come about this way: The 
immediate predecessor of the present Trustee, in making his last 
settlement at the close of his official term in September, 1902, may 
have entered some portions of his disbursements as ‘‘teachers’ 
salaries’? which should have been classified under some other 
heads. At least, the present Trustee could not tell where else to 
place them. There is no doubt that every dollar of the expendi- 
tures has been disbursed honestly and properly. As to the pres- 
ent Trustee, even his enemies—if he had them, which he has not— 
would say he is as just as Aristides. His predecessor settled with 
the finance committee of the county and was clear of all respon- 
sibility in a few hours after the present Trustee was sworn in.
-P-A-G-E-243
—236— 
The aggregate of receipts and expenditures is without doubt cor- 
rect. 
One great imperfection in our public school system has been 
‘removed by the enactment by the last Legislature of the School 
District Law. Another amendment that I think would be of ines- 
timable value would be the application of the Montgomery Coun- 
ty Law to the whole State. The present system of directorship 
is so defective, and is such a hindrance to the cause of the public 
schools that I think every County Superintendent would hail the 
suggested amendment with delight. It would certainly secure to 
the schools a much more uniform and efficient system of super- 
vision. 
Then again, the compensation allowed County Superintend- 
ents by the County Courts is so inadequate that with the excep- 
tion of perhaps half a dozen, every County Superintendent in the 
State is compelled, in order. to make a living, to carry the su- 
perintendency as a sort of side line. (I do not.) I devote at 
least four-fifths as many hours as a working man devotes to his 
trade, to school work in some shape. For this the County Court 
pays me this year the munificent sum of $425. Next year they 
may take a notion to cut it down as much as $50. Some of the 
court tried it last year. A man cannot possibly do more than 
barely live on that salary, and he could not even go to heaven on 
such a pitiful sum were it not for the fact that transportation 
over the ‘‘straight and narrow way’’ is furnished ‘‘without 
money and without price.’’ The County Court of Tipton County 
realize the value of a good Superintendent and they pay theirs the 
decent and reasonable sum of $1,000 a year. And yet I have been 
told by persons in a position to know that I do at least as much 
work as he does. 
T beg leave to call your attention to the amendments I sug-_ 
gest in answer to the questions printed on the back of my report, 
and ask you to consider their pertinency. 
With the hope that you will pardon the delay in making my 
report, and that you will accept it in spite of its imperfections, 
and with the desire and confident belief that you will accomplish 
more in your official work than any of your predecessors ever did, 
Tam Very truly yours, H. T. Hanxs, 
County Superintendent.

McMINN COUNTY. 
Enclosed find my annual report of the schools of my county. 
This report is delayed on account of the district directors not re- 
porting earlier. 
The State Institute, conducted by Prof. J. 8. Cline of Cum- 
berland County, and assisted by Prof. Duggan of South Pitts- 
burg, Mrs.Rice of North Knoxville Schools, Miss Oliver of Nash- 
ville, Miss Emily Hughes of Jackson and the County Superin- 
tendent, was held here in the County High School Building from 
June 15 to July 10. This institute was a great success, teachers 
attending from Monroe, Polk, Bradley, Meigs, James, McMinn 
and Knox Counties. One hundred and seventy-one were enrolled 
in all departments. 
‘During the year the County Court purchased the Female 
College building and boarding hall, situated in a beautiful grove 
of large oaks, on a five-acre plat of ground in the corporate lim- 
its of the city, and at the July term of the County Court J. C. 
Cate, R. 8. Henderson, B. P. Ward, James P. Thompson, W. A. 
Millard and John Garrison were elected a Board of Directors, 
who decided to run the school eight months in the year, to begin 
September 7. They elected the County Superintendent, Princi- 
pal, and Miss Eva Coltharp of Monroe County, Assistant.

This property is a very valuable acquisition to the schools of 
the county and much credit is due Prof. P. P. Claxton of Knox- 
ville for the noble work he did in presenting this matter to the 
court. 
A Teachers’ Training Course for the special benefit of the 
teachers of this and surrounding counties is organized in connec- 
tion with the same. Yours truly,

Mc NAIRY COUNTY. 
Our county institute was held in June and was attended by 
nearly every teacher in the county. I was accorded a hearty sup- 
port by all the teachers, and had one of the most interesting insti- 
tutes ever held in the county. I was assisted by Hon. W. K. Aber- 
nathy, Conductor; Profs. H. J. Cox, J. D. Mullins, Harry 
Hodges, C. E. Wilkerson, J. A. Houston, and Frank Lock. 
‘We are hoping that the operations of the new school law 
will bring us good results, several of our schools already having 
consolidated. I have held several school rallies, meeting many 
teachers, pupils and patrons. I believe the people are taking 
more interest in educating their children at home than ever be- 
fore. During my term I shall strive to popularize the idea of 
fostering good schools in the rural districts, and feel certain that 
I will meet with success. _ Turry ABERNATHY, 
County Superintendent.

My report is not as accurate as I would like to have it, from 
the fact that the Superintendent moved away last year about the

middle of August, consequently I have had a great deal of trouble 
getting in reports. However, I have done the best I could under 
existing cireumstances. Some of our directors are very indiffer- 
ent toward educational interests. 
I have found, however, that nearly all of our teachers are 
working with energy and taking a great deal of interest in their 
work. Many of them take educational journals and nearly all of 
them attend school during the winter months. 
The institute for this county was conducted by Supt. Al- 
bright and Prof. J. T. Stamps. There were about seventy teach- 
ers in constant attendance. They manifested great interest in 
the work—more than ever before. 
We have organized a County Teachers’ Association, which 
meets monthly in different parts of the county. Upon the whole 
the outlook is very flattering for a great improvement in the 
schools of the county. Very respectfully, 
J. C. Prics, 
County Superintendent.

- Our people are taking more interest than usual in the cause 
of public education; our teachers are better prepared for their 
work than ever before; and, as a result, our schools are pro- 
gressing fairly well. 
We had a splendid institute at Monteagle in June and, al- 
though Monteagle is in the edge of Grundy County, almost our 
entire teaching force attended. 
The institute was in session two weeks and most of our teach- 
ers were present the entire time. Prof. J. A. Setliff of Chatta- 
nooga, and Prof. F. M. Vancie of Fort Benton, Montana, did 
splendid work as instructors. Yours truly,

MONROE COUNTY. 
I have the honor of submitting herewith my first annual re- 
port of the public schools of Monroe County. This report has 
been unavoidably delayed, and at best is not at all satisfactory. 
It is a hereuvlean task to get some directors and teachers to make 
their reports correetly and punctually. 
It is the current opinion that the public schools of our county 
have been on the decline for some time. However this may be, I 
am satisfied that public interest in our schools is now on the in- 
crease. 
Our Normal seemed to give universal satisfaction. The pub- 
lie generally, as well as the teachers, took an active part in the 
work. All seemed anxious to make it a success. Prof. J. C. 
Hicks of Sweetwater deserves credit for efficient work during the 
whole term. “Dr. Bachman of Sweetwater gave us several highly 
instructive lectures. Acknowledgments are also due Prof. Wal- 
lace of Madisonville, Prof. Parks of Gudger, Prof. Summit of Hi- 
wassee College, and others too numerous to mention for their en- 
couragement and timely assistance. 
We are organizing district institutes over the county, and are 
determined to rouse teachers, directors, patrons and all con- 
cerned to more vigorous and systematic efforts in behalf of our 
public schools.

MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
I am sending you herewith my annual report of the public 
schools of Montgomery County for the scholastic year ending 
June 30, 1908. On account of very considerable errors in the 
scholastic enumeration of four districts, I am reporting again the 
scholastic population of the previous year. It will also he ob- 
served that the enrollment is somewhat less than during the year 
before. This is accounted for in the great number of changes of 
teachers and the unusually large number of beginners employed
-P-A-G-E-252
—245— 
last year. In two points especially, however, the report is griti- 
fying—the term, 138 days, was longer than ever before, and the 
per cent of attendance was higher. 
Since July the new system—the unit area of taxation and 
school government being the same in the county—has brought 
about some improvements which were not possible under the old. 
Since the salary of teachers for similar work is nearly the same 
over the entire county and since all rural schools are to be run 
the same term, many communities will, for the first time, have 
an opportunity to send the children to as good teachers as can 
be found in the county and the children in such communities will, 
for the first time, have an opportunity to go to school long 
enough to complete the public school course. Already the attend- 
ance is large enough in some schools to force the board to provide 
more seats, and it is now certain that both the enrollment and 
attendance will be better than ever before. 
All the schools running the same term, there will be uni- 
form grading throughout the county and pupils will be promoted 
on the basis of uniform examinations sent out from this office. 
The institute was one of the best ever held at Clarksville. 
The attendance was excellent and the work done by the instruct- 
ors was of the highest grade. The institute is grateful to you for 
sending Mr. J. L. Brooks of Jackson. He did good work and 
gave general satisfaction.

MEIGS COUNTY. 
It was my intention this year to consolidate my annual in- 
stitute with the State institutes at Athens and Harriman, but I 
found that it would be impracticable to do so. Several teachers 
attended the State institutes, however, and consequently the at- 
tendance at our county institute was not as large this year as it 
commonly is. 
I was assisted principally by Prof. J. G. Paul, an ex-Super- 
intendent of the county, and a graduate of Peabody Normal Col- 
lege. 
Reviews and drills were conducted by different teachers 
upon most all the subjects upon which examinations were to be 
held, and this method of instructing proves to be very profitable. 
Prof. J. 8. Ziegler gave the institute a lecture on History and 
methods of teaching the same, which was very profitable. 
Among the visiting teachers who favored us with talks and 
addresses were the following: Prof. Ayers of Carson and New- 
man College, Supt. Fred B. Frazier, Profs. Henry and Gil- 
breath of Rhea County, and Misses Jarvis and Otwell of Athens. 
We had a very interesting and profitable time during the 
week, and the teachers seemed to be encouraged to do better work 
this fall than they have ever done before. 
A very noticeable progress is being made along educational 
lines in Meigs County. The people are becoming more interested 
in educational work, and seem to have a greater desire to lend a 
helping hand. 
A County Board of Education has been appointed, and it is 
expected that the county will soon have one or more county high 
schools. There is at present considerable controversy as to the 
location of the high school, and it may be that two will have to be 
established in order to convenience the students. 
The interest in our county institute continues to grow and I 
am very much in hope that it will continue to do so until every 
teacher and director will attend regularly every month.

PERRY COUNTY. 
Enclosed is a report of our county institute held at Linden 
beginning June 29 and continuing five days. 
The institute was conducted by Prof. Don J. Milan of Ful- 
ton, Kentucky, who was ably assisted by Prof. A. F. Aydelott of 
Centreville, Tennessee. To these gentlemen should be given the 
credit of the success of the institute, as it was pronounced by all 
to be the most successful one ever held in Perry County. 
There were several able educators from other counties adja- 
eent to Perry, who took active interest in the work, and aided in 
many ways. Among the number might be mentioned Prof. A. W. 
Daniel of Centreville, Prof. J. C. Duck of Scott’s Hill, Prof. R. 
L. Sutton of Lexington, and Prof. F. A. Tucker of Scott’s Hill. 
On the last night of the institute Prof. Milan delivered a lec- 
ture on ‘‘The Schools of Tennessee,’’ at the Methodist Church, 
which, from the interest manifested by all the teachers and the 
people of Linden and different parts of the county, produced 
great effect in arousing great enthusiasm for better schools, bet- 
ter houses and better teachers throughout the county. 
I think much and lasting good has been accomplished, and 
if our institutes continue to grow in length as they have in at- 
tendance, it will be but a short time till we will be second to none 
in this line,

POLK COUNTY. 
Our Polk County Annual Institute of 1903 had, for the first 
time in the history of our county institutes, a regular public ex- 
amination in the Secondary Course. 
The Secondary examinations were accompanied by instruc- 
tion in nearly all of the Secondary branches. This was given by 
Prof. H. B. Alexander, Dr. W. W. Hooper of Grant University, 
and the County Superintendent. 
There are only three Secondary schools of the fifty-three 
schools in the county, but many of our Primary teachers were 
persuaded by me to take the Secondary Course—the object in 
view being to advance them much further in knowledge than the 
simple Primary Course affords or requires. 
But few of them had studied all of the Secondary branches, 
many had not studied any of them in school, so that the fact 
that six of the twenty-four on examination received Secondary 
Certificates, two of them getting first grades, speaks well for 
them. Only one of the twenty-four expected to teach in a Sec-
-P-A-G-E-261
—254— 
ondary school, and so they deserve credit for doing (to them) 
difficult work. , 
Prof. Alexander’s instruction was splendid and his work was 
highly appreciated. The following resolution adopted unani- 
mously by the institute was a faithful statement of the feeling of 
the teachers: 
**We, the teachers of the Polk County Annual Institute of 
1903, desire to express our heartfelt thanks to the Hon. 8. A. 
Mynders, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, for his 
sending us such a splendid instructor, Prof. H. B. Alexander, 
Superintendent of the Fayetteville, Tennessee City Schools. 
Prof. Alexander’s work during the week has been the main fea- 
ture, and many interesting and instructive things have heen said 
and done. His instructions have been earnest, foreeful, faithful, 
interesting and beneficial. We earnestly ask that he be sent to aid 
us in our next annual institute. We are very grateful to him for 
his good work for our advancement.’’ 
Dr. Hooper’s instruction was most excellent. The conductor, 
A. B. Nicholson, did effective work, as he has been doing as con- 
ductor in the past nine Normals held in this county. 
The organization of the institute follows: Miss Nora Mat- 
lock, Secretary; J. V. Rymer, Superintendent of Harriman City 
Schools, Critic; and two grading committees, namely: Second- 
ary, J. P. Morris, J. V. Rymer, N. B. Fetzer; Primary, G. L. 
Williams, J. R. Masengil and W. B. Humphreys. 
I believe this institute did more effective work than any one- 
week institute ever heretofore held in Polk County. 
During 1902-1903 the school interests of this county have 
kept up a steady, rapid advancement along nearly all lines of 
public school work. One result of three years’ efforts to get cor- 
porations assessed adequately, is the increase of school revenue 
from this source sufficient to add over two months to the length of 
our free school terms. From a per capita expenditure of from 
95 cents to $1.25, an increase has been made to from $1.80 to 
$2.40. 
The teaching force of the county is becoming much more ef- 
ficient; attendance at institutes is becoming more regular; a 
Teachers’ Circulating Library of only two years’ standing is do-

ing much good and is growing steadily; and a healthy public 
sentiment is sustaining and demanding longer terms, better 
teachers and better school facilities. 
During the past six years, teachers’ salaries have advanced 
from $22 to $30 average per month; thirty-one good frame school- 
houses have been built and four more are now under contract; 
over twelve hundred new desks have been bought to take the 
places of makeshifts; and thirty-nine school libraries consisting 
of bookeases, with forty-two excellent, standard books in each 
ease, have just been placed in our schools, yet the present term. 
of school will be longer than ever before in the history of the 
county. The enrollment is 17 per cent larger than for the pre- 
vious year. In three years the school lands of the county have 
yielded $3,627.05 revenue, increases on alien and corporation 
tax payers have yielded over $12,000 in school revenue alone. 
Yet I hope and believe that the good work is to go on, with what 
has been accomplished as only a beginning.

were given to lectures and recitations. on the common sehool 
branches, and to discussions on the methods of teaching. All 
teachers of the county but about five enrolled in the institute, and 
did very good work. The instructors were W. E. Stephens, J. C. 
Fooshee, 8. A. Gortner and J. B. Ziegler of Dayton, and Miss 
Virginia C. Johns of Nashville. This was regarded as one of the 
best bodies of instructors we have ever had, and they certainly 
performed their duties admirably. In resolutions adopted at 
the close of the institute the teachers expressed their hearty ap- 
preciation of the interest and cooperation which State Superin- 
tendent Mynders manifested in our work. Miss Virginia Johns, 
the lady he sent to assist us, proved especially fitted for her work 
here, and was greatly appreciated by the teachers. Also we de- 
sire to thank him for the visit he paid us during the institute and 
for the very interesting and instructive address which he deliv- 
ered in the courthouse on Directors’ Day. This day was specially 
set apart for the school directors to attend, and about fifty of
-P-A-G-E-266
—257— 
them were present. Announcements were sent all over the coun- 
ty giving due notice of it. The large number of visitors present 
was very encouraging. Supt. P. L. Harned of Montgomery 
County aecompanied the State Superintendent on his visit here 
and delivered a very interesting address to the directors and pa- 
trons. Miss Johns also made some very timely remarks on the 
condition of education in the county. 
One point emphasized through the institute and by the State 
Superintendent was the value of school consolidation. This move- 
ment is bearing fruit already, as proven by the fact that many di- 
rectors and patrons have already signified their desire to see even 
their own little schools consolidated with others and thereby se- 
eure better instruction and longer terms. 
At the close of the institute the County Teachers’ Association 
was reorganized, and a constitution adopted providing for four 
Vice Presidents, one for each civil district of the county. They 
are to have charge of the institute work in their respective dis- 
tricts, and to assist the County Superintendent along these lines. 
The Finance Committee recommended a charge of $1.50 to 
be paid by each teacher—half to go toward defraying the ex- 
penses of the institute, and the other half to go toward establish- 
ing a County Teachers’ Library, to be placed in the office of the 
County Superintendent. The library is progressing nicely. Hon. 
R. L. Taylor is to lecture at Dayton August 29, under the aus- 
pices of the Teachers’ Association, and the proceeds derived from 
his lecture are to go to the library fund.

Very respectfully yours, 
Frep B. Fraztar, 
County Superintendent. 
ROANE COUNTY. 
I am satisfied that my district clerks in some instances have 
been inaccurate in their figures. This comes by inaccurate rec- 
ords kept by teachers and from deficient clerks. It is my only 
resource, however. 
I was elected Superintendent at the April term of the Coun- 
ty Court. Practically I know very little of the school work in 
the county last year. The same court by which I was elected, at 
my request, raised the taxes in the county from 15 cents on the 
hundred to 25 cents on the hundred, which, together with the 
15 cents paid to the State for the same purpose, makes 40 cents 
on the hundred paid by my county for publie school purposes. 
The same court, at my request, provided for a County High 
School. This school has been combined with Rittenhouse Acad- 
emy, the Kingston High School, and is now under successful 
way. At your kindness we were given a State Normal at 
Harriman, beginning June 22, and continuing four weeks. 
This school under the able management of Capt. Douglass and
-P-A-G-E-268
—259— 
his efficient faculty, was a marked success. The people of Harri- 
man gave it their generous support. The city was at that time 
scourged with smallpox and this fact damaged the attendance. 
The work, however, was thorough and will bear good fruit. We 
have four thriving towns in the county, having each a splendid 
system of city schools, Oliver Springs having been recently in- 
corporated. The schools of the county are now all under way and 
prosperous; in fact the schools are on a boom in Roane County. 
The like has never been before, so the people say. We have fifty- 
seven female teachers and forty-seven male teachers, with eigh- 
teen colored, all doing first-class work. In addition to the public 
schools we have Roane College, an old institution, that has ac- 
complished much in the years gone by. Also the Harriman Uni- 
versity, an institution of the Christian Church. These schools 
have opened well, so I understand. Roane County is a rich farm- 
ing, mining and manufacturing county. Not many counties in the 
State have more invested capital on which taxes can be collected 
for school purposes than Roane. My great desire is to awaken the 
people on the vital subject of public schools until my county 
shall stand in the front line among the best counties in the 
State. This county was, as you know, redistricted by the last 
Legislature. There are now only five districts in the county, hav- 
ing fifteen school directors. This fact, in my opinion, will sim- 
plify and strengthen the work in the future. I am now cam- 
paigning the county with a series of picnie rallies. The interest 
is at highwater mark. The future is hopeful. The morning is 
radiant with the glory of the coming day. 
Fraternally yours, 
/ J. C. Wrrexr, 
County Superintendent.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
The annual institute for Scott County was held at Hunts- 
ville from June 29 to July 11. Supt. Mynders sent Prof. Setliff, 
a practical teacher of Chattanooga, to aid us. Prof. Setliff did 
his work in a very satisfactory manner. We did a great deal of 
class work this year and the results were good. 
This was my third institute and IJ regard it as one of the best 
held in this county. We are gradually gaining ground along edu- 
cational lines. Our school term will be longer this year than ever 
before. We have enough money in the treasury to pay one 
month’s salary of all the teachers. 
About 65 per cent of the teachers applying for certificates 
were licensed. Our school term is getting to be such that we 
can command a better teaching foree. 
We organized a Teachers’ Reading Cirele and marked out a 
course of study for the coming year. We meet in institute once 
a month for eight successive months and discuss the subject 
matter studied for that month. Those completing the course sat- 
isfactorily will be given special consideration at the next yearly 
examination. 
We extend our thanks to Supt. Mynders for his kind consid- 
eration of this county, and hope to show that it is not without. 
good results.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
The annual Normal Institute for Sevier County began June 
29, 1903, and continued ten days. 
It was the most successful meeting of the kind ever held in 
the county. The teachers showed great interest in the work and 
were very punctual in attendance ‘and prompt in the perform- 
ance of any duty assigned them. 
The instructors did excellent work. Our teachers all join 
me in thanking our worthy State Superintendent for the kindness 
he showed us in sending us such efficient help as Mrs. Mynders. 
Her instruction was very helpful and greatly enjoyed by all pres- 
ent. 
The schools in this county are not what we would like for 
them to be, but they are improving. I have endeavored to pro- 
eure the best teaching force possible under the existing cireum- 
stances. 
We have a teachers’ library of one hundred and fifty 
books, which are being read by the teachers. 
‘We have a course of professional reading for the teachers. 
They are manifesting considerable interest in self-improvement.
-P-A-G-E-273

At our last teachers’ meeting the Teachers’ Association di- 
vided the county into three divisions and appointed a local man- 
ager for each division. There will be a teachers’ meeting held in 
each of these divisions onee each month. There will also be one 
general meeting held once each month for all the teachers in the 
county. 
‘We have been conducting a series of educational mass meet- 
ings and will continue this work during the summer. 
The people are becoming aroused on the subject of education. 
and we look forward to great advancement in the school work in 
Sevier County.

SMITH COUNTY. 
In submitting to you my annual report, I am very proud to 
report that Smith County schools are enjoying’ a healthier 
growth than ever before. New life and greater aspirations for 
more efficient work seems to have taken hold of our teachers. 
We began the new school year with determined resolutions to 
correct as many of the evils as possible in the working of our 
schools. We are striving in every possible way to raise the stand- 
ard of teaching in Smith County. To,this end, among other things, 
we are now perfecting plans to introduce a Teachers’ Library and 
Reading Circle. I have found since becoming Superintendent 
that the great body of our teachers are reading practically no 
books on methods, school management, history of education, ete. 
It is my purpose to enlist the hearty cooperation and interest of 
every active teacher in this county on this subject. 
I desire to report also that a reorganization of our County 
Teachers’ Association has been effected, with the highest proba- 
bilities of suecess. Almost every teacher of the county has 
pledged his support in our efforts to make this one of the greatest 
agencies for educational progress. With the hearty and contin- 
ued support of the one hundred teachers of my county, great 
achievements may be attained during the new year. 
Our annual institute was largely attended and much interest 
shown. Owing to the serious illness of myself, Prof. J. G. Mitch- 
ell was appointed conductor. He endeared himself to all the 
teachers, presiding with fairness and satisfaction to all. 
The institute for colored teachers was held at Gordonsville, 
June 15 to 20. The attendance was large and interest unusually 
good. The character of the instruction was of a very high order. 
Am glad to report great improvement in the colored teachers of 
our county. 
Tn conelusion, I wish to say that the educational outlook in 
Smith County is extremely encouraging. Laboring unitedly in a 
common cause with one common purpose, we expect to accom- 
plish great things for the cause of education during the year.

STEWART COUNTY. 
Educational conditions in Stewart County are still, 1 am 
glad to say, in a prosperous condition. Of course there are a 
great many things we would like to have different from what 
they are, but on the whole we have very little complaint to make. 
We have a County Court that is very favorable to education and 
the sentiment throughout the county is strongly in favor of it and 
is becoming stronger every day. There is some opposition to the 
law making civil and school districts coextensive, but this is due 
very largely to a failure to understand the provisions of the law. 
We think the law will prove to be quite an improvement over the 
old. Elections were held in every district in the county and not 
a single board was elected which does not meet our unqualified 
approval. . 
We have arranged to have at least two rallies at every 
schoolhouse during the fall and intend to raise funds at these to 
establish libraries where none have been established, and to en- 
large those that we have. 
Out teachers’ library and monthly meetings are still in a 
prosperous condition and accomplishing great good. 
Our institute for white teachers was held in Montgomery 
County this year in conjunction with the institute from that 
county. <A report of this institute will be found in the report 
from Montgomery County. 
We had an institute for our colored teachers lasting one 
week, conducted by P. Moore of Elkton, Kentucky. The teachers 
manifested great interest and did some good work. 
A number of our teachers attended the Summer School at 
Knoxville and reported a pleasant and a profitable time. Stew- 
art County furnished the largest delegation of teachers of any 
county represented at the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association. 
We are expecting to accomplish much during the coming 
year. J. J. ALLMAN, 
County Superintendent.

SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
My report is at last ready. Never before have I had greater 
difficulty in getting full and aceurate reports from district 
clerks. The scholastic census came in rather mixed, but I think 
I have it now about correct. 
Most of our schools will open the first week in September, 
and the outlook at present presages satisfactory and efficient 
work for the coming school year. I have been careful to license 
only the best qualified teachers and, as a result, we are this year 
somewhat short in our teaching force. 
Sullivan County has ever had good Normal Institutes, and 
the one held this year was one of the very best we have ever held. 
Supt. Charles Mason, than whom there is no better institute in- 
structor in the State, was our leader. He was ably assisted by 
Profs. R. M. Shank, J. K. Shipley and others. 
Prof. W. 8. Gass of Carson and Newman College, Drs. J. A. 
Wallace and Geo. D. Booth of King College, and Prof. R. H. 
Freeland were with us and contributed much in the way of in- 
teresting and instructive lectures to incite our teachers to strive 
for a higher grade of work in the future. 
Most truly, 
J. E. L. SENEKrER, 
County Superintendent. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
The 1903 Sumner County’ Annual Institute is conceded to 
have been one of the most interesting and best attended insti- 
tutes ever conducted in Sumner County. The work continued 
for two weeks. The institute was conducted by Capt. ©. S. 
Douglass, Superintendent of the Gallatin City Schools. He has 
been with us several years and to him we owe a great deal of the 
eredit for the good attendance and enthusiastic support of the
-P-A-G-E-278
—269— 
institute. THe was assisted by Prof. P. A. Lyon of the Nashville 
City Schools, and Prof. H. H. Howser of LaFayette College. 
Subjects were taken np and ably discussed from time to 
time by some of our home teachers. Tuesday, June 23, was set 
apart for the directors, a great many of whom were with us and 
took part in the exercises. The State Superintendent, Hon. Sey- 
mour A, Mynders, was present on director’s day, and-addressed 
the teachers and directors. Our teachers, directors and people 
appreciated very much the interest that our State Superintend- 
ent took in our work. 
We have monthly meetings of the teachers in different sec- 
tions of the county while the schools are in session. These meet- 
ings do a great deal of good. By this means one can reach the pa- 
trons of the schools. 
The colored teachers had a successful institute, with twen- 
ty-seven in attendance. The interest manifested by the teachers 
and people was greater than usual and every one said it was one 
of the most enthusiastie and best attended institutes ever held in 
the county. 
The people of this county want better schools and are inter- 
ested in the eause of education, and we are having better work 
than ever before.

The Trousdale County Institute met June 30, and under the 
able management of Prof. Jackson Reeves and Miss Pattie Ma-

in Trousdale County. The teachers of Trousdale County desire 
to thank Supt. Mynders for sending Prof. Reeves and Miss Pattie 
Malone and are unanimous in saying that they want them back 
next year. 
During the institute every teacher in the county was present 
except three, and the attendance of teachers over 85 per 
cent. Our teachers are progressive and want to improve their 
condition, and show it by attending and taking part in the insti- 
tute work. :

UNICOI COUNTY. 
The work done in the institute just closed is by far the best 
that has ever been in the county. Prof. J. E. Crouch, City Su- 
perintendent of Johnson City, was sent by the State Superin- 
tendent to conduct the work. ‘To say that he is thoroughly up to 
his business is a very mild way of expressing it. Tis instruction 
is clear, concise and logical. He is eminently qualified for his 
high position, using common sense and judgment and making 
everything practical for the teachers. He may be equaled, but 
not surpassed in institute work. 
Prof. J. L. Hilbert of Jonesboro also rendered invaluable as- 
sistance. His quiet, unassuming manner wins for him the love 
and respect of all. Knowing the needs of the public schools of 
the State as few men do, he was qualified to give invaluable aid in 
that line. 
Prof. G. H. Easley of Milligan instrueted on penmanship 
in the public schools and made the topie very instructive. He 
also gave an excellent lecture on Thursday night on the sub- 
ject of ‘‘Finding and Filling a Place in the World.’’ 
Prof. Haynes of Tusculum, Prof. Gass of Carson College and 
Prof. Cooter of Washington College all rendered good work in 
the institute. 
Rev. C. H. Carpenter of New York presided at the organ and 
gave music for each service. His comic songs were full of laugh- 
ter. 
The interest of the community was high. The courtroom was 
packed at night and good crowds all day.

UNION COUNTY. 
The annual institute for Union County was held at May- 
nardville, beginning on July 6 and closing on July 11. Prof. 
U. C. Gregg of Crossville, Tennessee, conducted the institute 
work. He was assisted by Prof. J. C. Webster of Luttrell, and 
Prof. G. W. Morton of Agee. Prof. W. L. Gentry of Harriman, 
and Prof. J. C. Barnes of Maryville College, delivered lectures 
during the week on vital questions of education. 
The attendance of teachers was no better than at previous 
institutes, but the attendance of the general public was said to 
be the greatest ever witnessed in this county at an educational 
meeting. Ata private meeting of the teachers it was decided that 
to make a good grade in a searching examination each month on 
one study of the free school course and on one professional book 
18

should be considered the necessary yearly progress of the teacher 
to entitle him to a renewal of his certificate. All teachers to en- 
gage in the same studies each year. 
The county was divided into districts. The teachers of each 
district are held collectively responsible for the holding of one 
teachers’ institute some time this fall.

Prof. Mudge led in school work and gave many valuable les- 
sons on school management, while he also took an active part in 
Grammar. The work was nearly like school work—telling and 
showing how to teach. Prof. Furgerson did good work on Arith- 
metic and Prof. J. F. Gallaher on Tennessee History. In fact 
they changed work and kindly swapped out. It was a short insti-
-P-A-G-E-285
—276— 
tute and we were all glad that the State sent so good a man as 
Prof. Mudge. It was the best institute ever held in Wayne 
County. 
The colored people had a few in their institute, though so 
few there was little interest taken.

The institute for the colored teachers was conducted at the 
same time, but in a different building, and the same examination 
questions were used. Their instructors were selected from their 
own body, and they did very creditable work. 
We have two good monthly teachers’ associations—one for 
the white and one for the colored teachers. The teachers, white 
and colored, read educational journals, study works on teaching, 
and are interested in their work. 
A good per cent of my teachers attend State Teachers’ Insti- 
tutes, and our Nashville and Monteagle associations. 
Respectfully, 
Frep J. Pas, 
County Superintendent. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
Our institute here this year was, I believe, above an average 
in attendance and lively interest. All our instructors were the 
very best, wide-awake people who exerted themselves to make 
the institute a success. President Mitchel kindly offered us the 
use of Cumberland University, which we gratefully accepted. 
The conveniences and accommodations were many and an en- 
joyable time was spent by all present. 
Only thirty took the examination at the close of the institute. 
They all passed and many others will take the examination next 
Friday and Saturday.

EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE. 
At the Educationational Conference held in the city of 
Nashville, April 7, 8 and 9, 1903, the following resolution was 
unanimously adopted: 
RESOLUTIONS. 
We, your committee, believe that the sense of this Educa- 
tional Conference is that the County Superintendents and school 
officials should carry into their respective communities the idea 
that it is the desire of the people of this State to have better 
schools, and in order to obtain this result we must first create a 
strong educational spirit among the people. 
We, therefore, recommend an active and vigorous educa- 
tional campaign in every county and civil district in this State 
byjall persons interested in developing the children into an edu- 
cated citizenship; and to this end we especially recommend the 
thorough discussion of the following subjects in these various 
rallies: 
(1.) We-heartily endorse and urge the consolidation of 
schools in the rural districts because they give us, at less cost, 
longer terms, better teaching, and more individual attention to 
the pupils. 
(2.) We commend the idea of having a good practical 
teachers’ library for the teachers of each county, said library to 
be kept in the County Superintendent’s office, and a good library 
in eachschoolhouse in the county, for the broader culture of the 
pupils. 
(8.) We recommend an increased appropriation by the 
State for school purposes, and most heartily endorse local taxa- 
tion by the several County Courts in order that we may have 
better school buildings with modern equipments and attractive 
grounds, better teaching and more efficient supervision. 
(4.) It is the sense of this conference that primary instruc- 
tion is of paramount importance, and that for this work better 
trained teachers for primary work should be employed.

REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 
I have the honor to submit to you the twenty-eight annual 
report of the Peabody College for Teachers. The scholastic. year 
just closed, which began in October, 1902, and ended July, 1903, 
has been a year of uninterrupted prosperity, as shown in the 
number of students in attendance and by their earnestness and 
success in their studies. The number attending the College De- 
partment was 633; the number attending the School of Observa- 
tion was 202; making a total of 835. The organization and 
work of each of these departments is given below as follows: 
THE COLLEGE DEPARTMENT. 
The scholastic year of the college is divided into three terms. 
The fall term began in October, 1902, and ended January, 1903; 
the spring term began in February and ended in May, 1903; the 
summer term began June 3 and ended July 29, 1903. 
The fall and spring terms are organized for students who 
are able to devote their entire time to the work of preparation 
for teaching. The summer term, while suited to,the same class 
of pupils, is especially organized to meet the needs of teachers 
already in the field, who desire to devote their vacation to im- 
provement in their profession. The course of instruction in 
the summer term is exactly the same in thoroughness and com- 
pleteness in the branches taught, as in either of the other terms. 
It differs from the other terms only in the fact that fewer 
branches are taught, mainly those required for the degree of Li- 
centiate of Instruction. The schedule of study for this term is so 
arranged that students take fewer subjects and recite on these 
oftener than in the other two terms, thus accomplishing in each 
branch of study the required amount of work. 
It may be proper here to remark that the summer school 
held at the college last year was regarded as an experiment. It 
was In session six weeks, and was held in connection with a 
Teachers’ Institute of two weeks’ duration. 
(287)
-P-A-G-E-299
—288— 
So successful was this experiment that it pointed out the 
means of extending the usefulness of the college. The summer 
term has, therefore, been made a regular term of the college, 
and affords the teachers of the South an opportunity, by at- 
tending for a course of years, to accomplish all the work required 
for the degree of Licentiate of Instruction. : 
Of the 633 students attending the three terms of the schol- 
astic year 1902-3, 131 received at the close of the spring term the 
degree of Licentiate of Instruction, of whom 50 were from Ten- 
nessee, 388 women and 12 men; 32 received the degree of Bach- 
elor of Arts, 7 from Tennessee, all men; 8 received the degree 
of Bachelor of Science, 3 from Tennessee, 2 of whom were wom- 
en; 6 the degree of Bachelor of Letters, 2 from Tennessee, both 
women; one woman received the degree of Master of Arts. At 
the end of the summer term 21 received the degree of Licentiate 
of Instruction, of whom 13 were from Tennessee, 9 women and 
4men. Of the 633 students in the College Department 343 were 
from Tennessee. 
The Peabody Board has, during the year, contributed the 
usual amount for salaries, and has maintained as heretofore 192 
scholarships, 33 of which are given to Tennessee. These scholar- 
ships are worth $100 per collegiate year (i. e., $12.50 per month), 
and railroad fare to Nashville and return home. 
Heretofore students have been scholarships for two years; 
the Peabody Board has indicated its intention to abolish the 
scholarship system at the end of this year, and all scholarships 
awarded this summer have been given for the year only. If this 
change is made it is probable that the number of students at the 
college will be perceptibly diminished, as the possession of schol- 
arships enabled many to attend who would without them 
have been unable to do so. The exclusion of students not pre- 
pared to enter the college, while bringing better material, and 
giving the college better standing, has also decreased the attend- 
ance. The Peabody Board has also made the usual appropriation 
of $500 for books for the library, and has in addition given $5,- 
000 for repairs on the buildings, which is now being expended. 
The University of Nashville, in addition to giving the use 
of its buildings and paying the insurance on them, continues to
-P-A-G-E-300
—-289— 
maintain the Winchester Chair of Modern Languages at an ex- 
pense of $800 per year. 
The number of professors in the college is 23; the number 
of assistants is 5; and there are five officers of administration. I 
attach report for the summer term, made by Dr. W. R. Garrett, 
Dean. James D. Porvrer, 
President. 
NASHVILLE, TENN., July 29, 1903. 
Hon. James D. Porter, President Peabody College for Teachers,

The experience of the past has shown that provision must be 
made in the summer term for three distinct classes of students: 
1. The regular students of the college who desire to utilize 
the summer term in order to complete their courses of study soon- 
er than they could otherwise do, or to make up some deficiency. 
2. Those who expect to enter the college as regular students, 
but find it necessary to take a preparatory course to fit them- 
selves to meet the requirements of entrance. 
3. There is a large number of teachers who are engaged in 
teaching during the fall and spring terms, but who have leisure 
during the summer term to devote the vacation to improvement, 
or who desire to perfect themselves in special branches. 
The course of the summer term was, therefore, arranged to 
meet the needs of these three classes. 
The first class was provided for by a course of study inelud- 
ing the branches required for the degree of Licentiate of Instruc- 
tion, and a few other branches. The subjects are taught as 
thoroughly and completely, and cover the same ground as in the 
other two terms, and subject to the same regulations for passing. 
The shortness of the term is overcome by more frequent recita- 
tions; thus making the number of recitations in most of the 
branches equal to those of the other two terms, and the student 
is restrained from overwork by limiting the number of studies 
which he is permitted to take. 
For the benefit of the second class a preparatory course was 
provided, including those studies on which students are required 
to be proficient for entrance in the college. 
Both of the courses mentioned above are open to the third 
elass for their election, and a few branches were added for their 
benefit, especially in the line of Philosophy and Pedagogy. For 
the benefit of this large class of teachers already in the field, spe- 
cial arrangements were made with Hon. 8. A. Mynders, State 
Superintendent of Tennessee, through whose courtesy the college 
is enabled to confer State Certificates on the teachers from Ten- 
nessee who complete the requirements. 
These State Certificates include: 
1. The Primary Certificate, which entitles the holder to
-P-A-G-E-307
—294— 
teach in any primary school in any county in Tennessee, and is 
good for one year. 
2. The Secondary, or Roll of Honor Certificate, which en- 
titles the holder to teach in any school of any grade in the State, 
and is good for four years. 
The Roll of Honor Certificate cannot be conferred on any 
person who has not attended either the Peabody College or one of 
the State Institutes for two terms, and has also previously re- 
ceived the Primary State Certificate. 
Both of these certificates are renewable without further ex- 
amination upon proof that the holder has been continuously en- 
gaged in teaching, is of good moral character, ete. 
Those teachers desiring to continue in the college through a 
series of summer terms, in order to graduate, are thus protected 
during the time by State Certificates. 
At the close of the term, State Certificates were awarded as 
follows: 
ROLL OF HONOR CERTIFICATES. 
J. W. Hinkley, H. M. Eastis, 
Horace Williams. 
PRIMARY CERTIFICATES. 
Miss Sue Adams, T. C. Hassell, 
Miss Ethel Beasley, Mrs. Lillie W. Kerr, 
Miss Mary Bennett, Miss Margaret McElroy, 
J. D. Blevins, Walter E. Nants, 
M. M. Floyd, Mrs. Erin Walker, 
W. 8. Harper, ©. R. Watkins, 
W. T. Wright. 
The work of the summer term was of the most satisfactory 
character. The students were thoroughly in earnest, attentive, 
studious, regular in attendance, and exemplary in deportment. 
All my colleagues took deep interest in their respective de- 
partments, and deserve your approbation. I have the honor to 
be Your obedient servant, 
W. R. GARRETT, 
Dean.

THE WINTHROP OBSERVATION SCHOOL. 
The Winthrop School was founded when the imperative 
need of those preparing to teach was to witness the working of a 
schoo] well graded, and run on lines distinctly modern. 
Since the methods employed in teaching young children dif- 
fered more radically from the old system than those used in the 
higher grades, the school at first consisted of five grades only. 
Here, under an expert instructor, were illustrated that fact of 
kindergarten work which embraces the initial steps in Manual 
Training, Nature Study, and a course in languages that laid the 
foundation for a love of good literature, and enable the child to 
express his thought with clearness and simplicity. 
As the school has progressed, adding grade to grade, until 
its work leads to the college door, these lines have been advanced 
and strengthened until now the pupil teacher from the college 
sees illustrated all lines of publie school work; hand and head 
working in intelligent sympathy. That nothing can take the 
place of experience no intelligent person questions; but there are 
those who entertain grave doubts as to the work of a student, self- 
conscious under the eye of the critic teacher, with mind concen- 
trated upon the minute part of school work under his care, ner- 
vously aware that he is not the master, constituting in any ade- 
quate sense experience. In the Observation School an oppor- 
tunity for quiet, thoughtful consideration of the methods and 
devices employed by the expert teacher, and, what is of far 
greater moment, the spirit and motive actuating his efforts, is 
afforded; and the numbers of students who sit daily in earnest 
study of the system, and their hearty expressions of grateful ap- 
preciation go far to show that the work has not been in vain. 
To a limited number the school has offered a field for practice 
that constitutes a rea] experience in that it employs both grad- 
uates and undergraduates as substitutes and as assistants. 
A long list of those who have gone from this school to fill 
places of honor as teachers, South and North, attests the value of 
this experience:
-P-A-G-E-309
296 
Mrs. Alexander, for several years at the head of the City 
Training School, Macon, Ga., and Miss Mattie Martin, now critic 
teacher in the State Normal College of Michigan, are of this num- 
ber. 
The primary grades of the Winthrop school are under the 
eare of Miss Mary P. Jones, trained at Teachers’ College, New 
York City; our other departments are under the care of our 
own graduates, who have supplemented the work of the Peabody 
College by special work at Chicago, Harvard and Columbia, and 
who have the ability which years of experience in the best schools 
give. . 
It is intended the coming year to extend the lines of Man- 
ual Training in the school as fully as the ‘‘sinews of war,’’ mon- 
ey and brains, shall enable us to do. The child is taken at 8 
years of age, and for eight years is advanced along the lines of 
the best graded public schools. Then at 14 he is ready for High 
School work. He is then given two years of work preparatory for 
the college. To the great numbers of children and youth whose 
homes are outside the city limits, and thus cut off from the priv- 
ileges of city schools, the model school affords an opportunity not 
otherwise to be had for systematic and thorough preparation for 
college work, and that at tuition substantially free. To the 
model school pupils all the privileges of the gymnasium, inelud- 
ing regular instruction there under the gymnasium director, are 
given, and a playground unequalled in extent and beauty gives 
opportunity for all the outdoor exercise that growing bodies need 
for healthful development. 
The average attendance for the past eight years has been 
nearly three hundred per year, and the teachers are five in num- 
ber. 
Many pupils come from distant parts of our own State and 
not a few from other States.

UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
Davidson Academy, the first incorporated school in the ter- 
ritory now known as Middle Tennessee, was the outgrowth of a 
determination by the first settlers to give to their children the 
opportunity for education. 
The charter, to which was attached a grant of 240 acres of 
land, was secured from the Legislature of North Carolina in 
1785; five years after the first cabins were built on the Cumber- 
land and eleven years before the admission of Tennessee to the 
Federal Union. 
James Robertson, who was the leading spirit in the founda- 
tion, the defense and the development of the colony, was also the 
principal mover in the foundation of its first institution of learn- 
ing; he was a member of the Legislature which granted the char- 
ter, a member of the Board of Trustees of the Academy and 
probably induced the Rev. Thomas B. Craighead to unite him- 
self to its rather uncertain future. As an illustration of the un- 
settled condition, which existed to a much later period, it is a his- 
torical fact that one of the Trustees named in the charter, Col. 
Anthony Bledsoe, was killed by Indians at his own house, three 
years after the foundation of Davidson Academy; and it was 
not until 1794 that a peace was concluded, which freed the resi- 
dents on the Cumberland from the dangers of Indian hostilities. 
Mr. Craighead was a Presbyterian minister, a graduate of 
Princeton, and by virtue of an upright character, scholarly at- 
tainments and strong convictions, exercised great influence in the 
new community. He was the head of Davidson Academy until 
its elevation into Cumberland College in 1806 and President of 
the latter from 1807 to 1809. Many of the Trustees originally 
named by the Legislature of North Carolina went into the board 
governing Cumberland College, but none of them seemed to have 
lived to witness the erection of the University of Nashville in 
1825 on the foundations of the two other institutions and aid in 
starting it upon its long and illustrious career. 
Mr. Craighead was succeeded by Dr. James Priestly, an ac- 
complished teacher, who, prior to coming to Tennessee, had had
-P-A-G-E-311
—298— 
as some of his pupils some of the ablest men of their day in Ken- 
tucky. His connection with the college continued with a short 
hiatus until his death in 1821. 
Dr. Philip Lindsley, the first President of the University, 
resigned the Vice Presidency and refused the Presidency of 
Princeton to come to Nashville. He hoped to maintain not only 
collegiate but scientifie and professional departments, a hope 
which the limited population of the country, and the absence 
of any endowment other than unproductive land disappointed. 
Dr. Lindsley’s connection with the University, covering 
a quarter of a century, was of inestimable value, not only to 
Tennessee, but to the whole Southwest. 
Although the classes of the University were never large and 
the means placed at his command by the Trustees always lim- 
ited, the standards of collegiate attainment and morality main- 
tained by Dr. Lindsley in the University from 1825 to 1850, gave 
to the country some of the highest types of manhood. 
The University passed a critical period after Dr. Lindsley’s 
resignation and its literary department became a few years, prior 
to the war, a military school of great reputation, under the name 
of The Western Military Institute, whose students and professors 
left its halls in 1862 to become soldiers. 
In 1874, when the gentlemen to whom had been intrusted 
the administration of George Peabody’s gift to the eause of 
Southern education were seeking a location for a Normal Col- 
lege, the advantages of Nashville were at once apparent to them 
and the diffieulty they experienced in finding buildings suitable 
for their purposes was solved by an offer from the Trustees of 
the University of Nashville of the grounds and buildings the 
Peabody College has since occupied. 
The property could have been dedicated to no nobler uses, 
and if the University, by giving the greater part of its estate 
to aid in the foundation and maintenance of the Peabody Col- 
lege, has impaired its ability to establish other departments and 
to extend its usefulness in other directions, it has done an ineal- 
culable service to the State and the South, by its cooperation 
with the Peabody Board and the State in the great work of teach- 
ing the teacher.
-P-A-G-E-312
—299— 
To this object the greater part of its real estate and a con- 
siderable part of its income have been devoted for nearly thir- 
ty years, and the Trustees, many years ago, formally decided by 
resolution that this use of the property should continue as long 
as the Peabody Board maintained there the Peabody Normal 
College or other similar institution. 
The University, as it is now organized, consists of the Pea- 
body College (of which the Winthrop Model School is a part), 
the Medical College and the Montgomery Bell Academy, and re- 
ports of each are furnished herewith. 
The report of the Peabody College is made separately, and 
for information relative to it, reference is made thereto. 
The University has had a successful year; the total attend- 
anee in all departments was 1,266, and the number of instructors 
was 64. 
UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
MepicaL DEPARTMENT. 
The Medical Department of the University of Nashville was 
opened for the instruction of students in medicine, October 11, 
1850. It was one among the first colleges of medicine to be es- 
tablished in the South and from the beginning enjoyed a liberal 
patronage and exerted a strong influence in the field of medical 
education. 
In 1895 the old building on South Market street was aban- 
doned and the Trustees erected a splendidly appointed building 
located further out Market street, opposite the grounds of the 
Literary Department. Tt has large, well-lighted and well-ven- 
tilated lecture halls and laboratories on each story, with a ca- 
pacious museum hall and general offices on the first story, and is 
equipped with lighting and heating apparatus of the most im- 
proved patterns. Every appointment is complete for the teach- 
ing of medicine in accordance with the most advanced methods. 
The curriculum now consists of twenty-three lecture courses, 
each accompanied by a review quiz or recitation, seven labora-
-P-A-G-E-313
—300— 
tory courses and three hours daily of clinical work in the hos- 
pital and dispensary. The practical laboratory courses offered 
are Chemistry, Histology, Physiology, Anatomy, Bacteriology, 
Pathology and Surgery. The required time of study for the de- 
gree of Doctor of Medicine is four years, except in the case of 
students presenting diplomas from literary and scientific insti- 
tutions of good standing. These latter are permitted to apply for 
the degree after three years, upon certain conditions. 
The course of study is carefully graded, the first and see- 
ond years being devoted largely to the study of the fundamental 
branches, viz.: Chemistry, Histology, Anatomy, Physiology, Ma- 
teria Medica and Pharmacy, Bacteriology, Pathu:osgy and The- 
rapeutics. In the third and fourth years the practical branches, 
Medicine, Surgery, Obstretries, Gynecology, Neurology, Diseases 
of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat, Pediatrics and Medical Juris- 
prudence. In the third year, Hygiene, Regional Anatomy, Op- 
erative Surgery and Veneral Diseases are studied in addition to 
the other practical branches. During the third and fourth years 
the student spends three hours daily in clinical work at the 
Nashville City Hospital and the University Free Dispensary. 
The faculty now consists of thirteen professors, one adjunct 
professor and ten lecturers, demonstrators and assistants. Dur- 
ing the session of 1902-3 there were 317 bona fide students in at- 
tendance, coming from eighteen States, as follows: From Ten- 
nessee, 92; Mississippi, 65; Louisiana, 33; Texas, 30; Alabama, 
25; Arkansas, 22; Kentucky, 19; West Virginia, 7; South Caro- 
lina, 4; Georgia, 4; Florida, 4; Illinois, 3; New York, 2; North 
Carolina, 2; Indiana, 2; Indian Territory, 1; South Dakota, 1; 
Cuba, 1. 
The college fees for a session of six months aggregate $65, 
which amount covers all fees payable to the college for one course 
of lectures. In the senior year there is an additional gradua- 
tion fee. The entire expenses for one course, including board, 
room, fuel, light, laundry, books, instruments, and tuition ranges 
from $155 to $190, according to the habits of the individual. The 
above estimate does not include pocket money. 
The session opens October’ 1 of each year and continues 
twenty-six weeks, exclusive of vacation allowance, closing early
-P-A-G-E-314
—301— 
in April. At the last annual commencement fifty applicants re- 
ceived the degree of M.D. The total number of graduates to 
date is 4,453, 
The officers of the Medical Department are Dr. William G. 
Ewing, Dean, and Dr. Dillard Jacobs, Secretary, and the fac- 
ulty as follows: ‘IT. L. Maddin, M. D., Professor of Nervous 
Diseases and General Pathology; W. G. Ewing, Ph. G., M. D., 
Professor of Materia Medica and Therapeutics; 8. 8. Crockett, 
M. D., Professor of Obstretries; M. C. MeGannon, A. M., M. D., 
Professor of Diseases of Women and Abdominal Surgery; L. B. 
Graddy, M. D., Professor of Diseases of Eye, Ear, Nose and 
Throat; James M. King, B. S., M. D., Professor of Chemistry ; 
Larkin Smith, M. D., Professor of Pathology and Bacteriology ; 
Charles Brower, M. D., Professor of Surgery; Edwin G. Wood, 
©. M., M. D.; Professor of Praetice and Medicine and Clinical 
Medicine, J. Dillard Jacobs, A. M., M. D., Professor of Physiol- 
ogy and Hygiene; Alberto Hudson, M. D., Professor of Anat- 
omy. 
MONTGOMERY BELL ACADEMY. 
By his will executed in 1852, Mr. Montgomery Bell, a sue- 
eessful ironmaster of Tennessee, who had himself felt the disad- 
vantages of the want of early education, gave to the Trustees of 
the University of Nashville a sum of money for the foundation 
and maintenance of the Montgomery Bell Academy, to be lo- 
cated in Nashville and to be conducted for the benefit of boys 
from 10 to 14 years of age ‘‘who are unable to support and edu- 
cate themselves, and whose parents are not able to do so.’’ 
He provided that these boys should be taught in the ‘com- 
mon branches of an English education—Reading, Writing, 
Arithmetic, Geography, and such other branches including Math- 
ematies and Ancient and Modern Languages, as may be deter- 
mined by the University Trustees. Mr. Bell died in 1855 and the 
Trustees had then no funds with which to erect buildings for the 
use of the academy. The war then followed, and it was not until
-P-A-G-E-315
—-302— 
1867 that the Trustees were able to organize the school, which 
was done in the buildings occupied by the Peabody College; but 
in 1881 they erected for it with funds and on ground belonging 
to the University, a suitable structure which has since been used 
exclusively by the academy. 
The corpus of Mr. Bell’s legacy, thus supplemented by the 
Trustees, has not only been kept intact, but materially increased, 
and the interest of the entire fund has been devoted to the main- 
tenance of the school. Being by this partial endowment made to 
some extent independent of popular patronage, the Trustees 
have sought from the beginning to give the academy a character 
for thorough instruction along useful Lines rather than for the 
size of its classes, or the number of studies included in its curri- 
eulum. 
In proof of the wisdom of this policy, a large proportion of 
the 1800 pupils who have received education there, occupy prom- 
inent places in professional and commercial life, while very many 
others who have sought occupation in other directions have be- 
come useful and intelligent members of the community. 
Much eare is taken in the selection of those boys who receive 
the free instruction provided for by Mr. Bell, and scholarships 
are given with the understanding that they will be withdrawn 
from those who are unappreciative or inefficient. Boys living 
outside of the city are preferred to others, for the reason that the 
latter have access to the city schools. 
In order to enable the Principal to maintain a larger corps 
of instructors than would be possible in a school limited to twen- 
ty-five pupils, he has been permitted to receive others who pay 
the fees usually charged in schools of this character. 
He has in this way been able to give scholarship pupils in- 
struction in branches which the interest of the Bell fund might 
not be sufficient to provide; for instance, Elocution, which is a 
notable feature of the course, Composition, Literature, Geology, 
Draughtsmanship, ete. This plan has been found satisfactory 
for many years and by this extension of the curriculum those 
who finish the course are qualified to enter college, and are ad- 
mitted without examination to many colleges and universities. 
The University of Tennessee gives three free scholarships to
-P-A-G-E-316
—303— 
graduates of the Academy. Occasional access to the Peabody 
College library, and the use, when not occupied, of its athletic 
field, gymnasium and lecture rooms, gives the pupils privileges 
enjoyed in few similar schools. The academy has a good library 
containing all necessary books of reference and many standard 
works; a laboratory well equipped with chemical and philosoph- 
ical apparatus and a growing collection of minerals. 
Three courses of study have been arranged: A classical for 
those who seek the A. B. Degree; a Latin scientific leading to the 
B. 8. Degree, and a business course for those contemplating com- 
mereial pursuits. 
The number of pupils for the session of 1902-3 was 114; the 
teachers were five in number: §. M. D. Clark, Principal, Clas- 
sies; P. H. Manning, Natural Science, French; J. W. Brister, 
Mathematics, History, German; A. B. Armstrong, Grammar De- 
partment; John Lowry, Elocution. 
JAs. D. Porter, Chancellor. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Str—TI have the honor to submit to you the annual report of 
the Tennessee School for the Blind for the year ending June 4, 
1903. 
This session opened very auspiciously. There were more 
pupils in attendance than ever before at any opening of the 
school. The entire building was in better condition than ever 
before. A spirit of cheerfulness, friendliness and good fellowship 
pervaded the air. Classes were soon organized; work was as- 
signed in the various departments; pupils and teachers fell into 
their respective places without the least confusion and abso- 
lutely without friction. The third day saw the school fully or- 
ganized and in actual operation. 
The work in the Literary Department has been especially 
good, reflecting great credit on the teachers whose earnestness
-P-A-G-E-317
—304— 
and unswerving attention to duty have yielded such excellent re- 
sults. The pupils as a whole have readily and cheerfully re- 
sponded to the call of the teacher. 
It may be of interest to mention a few facts in connection 
with the Industrial Department. last year we introduced the 
raffia work merely as an experiment. JT employed an experienced 
teacher and in a short time the children succeeded so well that I 
decided to adopt it as one of our employments, and although 
it has little commercial value, it serves to train hands and fin- 
gers. Articles of taste and beauty have been made which are 
pronounced equal to anything done in the same work by the echil- 
dren of the public school. We also make jewelry. Some of the 
boys are very expert. The watch chains, finger rings, bracelets, 
etc., which are made are pretty and showy and find ready 
sale in the country. 
We often admit young men and women who have recently 
lost their sight to learn some of the work in the shops. If they 
manifest ability and a desire to study they are taught reading, 
writing and arithmetic. In one or two years they can master 
our simple trades and are then able to earn their bread if they 
are energetic and persevering. I call to mind several we have 
helped in this way. Some of them have succeeded remarkably 
well, managing their business as skillfully and as successfully as 
their seeing competitors. 
Three years ago a girl came to us 19 years old and totally” 
blind. She had never attended school of any kind; her parents 
eonstantly impressed upon her her sad and helpless condition; 
she was Jed about from place to place; all attempts to do for her- 
self were discouraged. And yet she possessed a bright mind, and 
in ordinary affairs pertaining to home surroundings, was pretty 
well informed. But this suppression of development, this stunt- 
ing of the mind and body to which she was subjected, made a 
girl of 19 years no more developed than the average girl of 15. 
Few children have surpassed her in eagerness to learn. She 
threw her whole heart and soul into the work, learned the alpha- 
bet in part of a day, read quite fluently in three months, and in 
three years has completed six grades. But, that is not all. In 
the work room, she has learned to sew, to use the sewing ma- 
chine, to make her underclothes, to cut and fit her dresses, and
-P-A-G-E-318
—305— 
the only assistance she requires from her teacher is to be told the 
right side of the goods. She has also learned musie and, in va- 
cation, employs the time in giving piano lessons to the children in 
her neighborhood. She is now 22 years old; is a well-grown 
woman, and weighs 130 pounds. This is the result of coordinate 
and physical training. We find Physical Culture of the greatest 
importance in this school. We employ a teacher who is a grad- 
uate of some school of national reputation. Blind children are 
naturally less developed than seeing children; hence the import- 
ance of the exercise of lung and muscle that this training in- 
volves. It is readily understood that if the adult blind ean ac- 
complish so much in the short time allotted to them, what may 
we not expect from children within school age? 
In this school. we use the same text books and the same meth- 
ods of instruction adopted and practiced by the best schools for 
the seeing. The progress cf our pupils in the primary grades is 
somewhat slower than that of children in the ordinary school. 
But in the higher grades from the fifth up the progress is about 
equal to that made by sighted children. 
. Blindness is a great misfortune, a ealamity that is only mit- 
igated by the blessings of an education and by the ability to earn 
one’s own living. In Great Britain blindness has decreased four- 
teen per cent in the last fifty years, which is ascribed to the bet- 
ter condition of living, improved surgery, and greater protec- 
tion in perilous employments. The Board of Health of New 
York City having declared that ophthalmia is a contagious dis- 
ease, especially prevalent among school children, eleven physi- 
cians were appointed to visit public schools, examine the chil- 
dren, and report each case to the Board. One physician, who ex- 
amined 2,000 pupils, found twenty per cent suffering from con- 
tagious eye diseases and more than one-fourth of these cases 
were of so serious a nature that relief could only be hoped for by 
operation. From the foregoing it appears that blindness may be 
guarded against by good and sufficient food and by intelligent 
medical attention. I would add strict adherence to cleanliness 
and absolute protection from exposure to light in infaney; in 
ease of accident, to use only simple remedies until an oceulist 
examines the patient ; to require teachers to examine their pupils’ 
20
-P-A-G-E-319
—306— 
eyes and report all cases of defective vision and contagious eye 
diseases. 
The enrollment of pupils this session has been 287; white, 
236; colored 51. An inerease of thirty-seven over last session’s 
enrollment. The final written examination was held on the 
three last days of May. Only two failed to make the promotion 
average, and thirteen were conditioned. Those averaging eighty- 
five per cent or above are on the Honor Holl, and the majority 
of the children in all the classes won that distinction. The high- 
est per cent attained in Primary Department was 99 2-5; in the 
Grammar School, 99 2-5; High School, 96. 
There were three graduates in the Literary and Musical De- 
partments and one in the Tuning Department. The three young 
ladies who graduated, Misses Bruce and Sullivan, High School; 
and Miss Cook, in the Grammar Department, came to us when 
they were about 9 years of age. They were studious, ambitious, 
well-mannered and ladylike, and I am confident that they will 
succeed in making a living for themselves, if necessary, and also 
succeed in making those with whom they come in contact purer 
and better. One young man completed the course in piano tun- 
ing. Respectfully submitted, 
J. V. ARMSTRONG, 
Superintendent. 
TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
Sm—lIt again becomes incumbent upon me to present to you 
a statement of affairs pertaining to the work of the Tennessee 
Industrial School. During the past two years the health of the 
pupils has been good and many things have been accomplished 
for the betterment of our hygienic surroundings that in future 
will, we believe, prove of great benefit to us. 
The deportment of the children has been very satisfactory 
and as the young people who have once been pupils here pre- 
sent themselves in the strength of a young and useful man and 
womanhood, the incentive becomes greater to every scholastic 
generation entering upon the activities which lead them to suc-

cess. The Tennessee Industrial School and its work are known 
throughout the length and breadth of our country and other 
lands have paid us tribute. We hope we have received these 
courtesies and accepted the plaudits of our friends in the same 
spirit they were intended to convey by answering all questions 
relative to our work, its cost, its scope and effectiveness, its va- 
ried appliances and the spirit of its application. 
We have received since opening the institution three thou- 
sandonehundredand sixty-seven (3,167) pupils; twenty-four hun- 
dred and sixteen (2,416) were white boys, five hundred and fifty- 
five (555) were white girls, one hundred and ninety-eight (198) 
colored boys and one (1) colored girl. We have dismissed since 
opening twenty-three hundred and fifty-five (2,355) pupils; 
eighteen hundred and ninety-six (1,896) were white boys; three 
hundred and eighteen (318) were white girls, and one hundred 
and forty-one (141) colored boys. We had remaining in school 
at the close of the fiscal year, December 19, 1902, eight hundred 
and twelve (812) pupils; six hundred and thirty-seven (6387) 
were paid for by the State, one hundred (100) by Davidson 
County, and seventy-five (75) by parents, guardians and friends. 
During the past two years we have received from all sources one 
hundred and seventy-six thousand three hundred and twenty-sev- 
en dollars and seventy-eight cents ($176,327.78); we have ex- 
pended on subsistence account one hundred and _ forty-eight 
thousand nine hundred and seventy-four dollars and forty-four 
cents ($148,974.44) ; on furnishing account six thousand nine 
hundred and ninety-six dollars and twenty-five cents ($6,996.- 
25); on improvement account nineteen thousand nine hundred 
and eighty-one dollars and five cents ($19,981.05). These fig- 
ures inelude all special appropriation for 91-92 of five thousand 
dollars ($5,000) for small girls’ department, four thousand three 
hundred and fifty-five ($4,355) dollars for indebtedness in- 
curred during the two years, and also three thousand five hun- 
dred ($3,500) dollars for crematory, sewerage and water filter- 
ing. During the two years our farm has been ‘fairly productive; 
at times it was necessary to purchase vegetables and fruits; at 
other times these important factors of our living were abundant. 
We keep our land well fertilized with barnyard manure and 
from it we get from two to three crops a year.
-P-A-G-E-321
—308— 
We raise principally Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, peas, 
beans, onions, lettuce, radishes, butter beans, carrots, parsnips, 
beets, cabbages, cucumbers and tomatoes. 
You will readily understand that of necessity we must work 
Mother Earth for all we can get, to keep up the demand. 
It takes seven barrels of Irish potatoes for one day; for one 
meal we need at least fourteen barrels of cabbages or greens; 
while eleven barrels of sweet potatoes disappear at the noon day 
meal. We require twelve barrels of string beans for dinner and 
about the same quantity of green peas; twenty bushels of toma- 
toes are consumed each day during the tomato season, which by 
planting a succession of crops continues from June 20 until the 
last of October. It is generally admitted that this community of 
young people have good and lasting appetites, but if ever the 
vegetables they consume make any difference in the consumption 
of other foods, I have never diseovered it. To us they are only 
appetizers. 
Our work shops and manual training features are a source of 
constant pleasure. The children have at all times displayed a 
spirit of cheerful willingness in performing whatever duties 
have been assigned them, and have manifested an interest in and 
a desire to thoroughly master the trades and branches taught. 
How well they have succeeded in this laudable desire is abund- 
antly evidenced by the fact that few, if any, of the young men 
learning a business here fail to find steady employment at good 
salaries, after their dismissal from the institution.. 
Of the twenty-three hundred and fifty-five pupils who have 
left the school, many of whom are engaged in most of the lead- 
ing trades and some have entered the professions, many nvtable 
examples of their success might be cited. 
The children are engaged in the following trades and indus- 
tries: Bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy, arch- 
iteetural and free hand drawing, printing, cabinet-making, wood 
carving, furniture finishing, carpentry, manual training, 
mattress-making, upholstering, painting, barber shop work, 
broom-making, tailoring, blacksmithing, bread-baking, harness 
and shoe-making, store-keeping, steam laundry, work in machine 
shops, care of steam boilers, plumbing, farming, vegetable gar-
-P-A-G-E-322
—309— 
dening, fruit gardening, floriculture, work in hot. beds, vineyard, 
barn and eare of stock. Each of these various departments are 
helpful to the institution and children alike. All of the shoes, 
clothing, furniture, brooms, ete., consumed and used by the in- 
stitution are made by the pupils. 
We raise most of our vegetables, do our own printing, car- 
pentry, painting and general plumbing repairs. 
The practicability of maintaining each of the foregoing de- 
partments is unquestionably of economical value and of greater 
import—helpful to the children. 
The economical product is an important factor in solving the 
problem of feeding, clothing and educating a child on an annual 
per capita, allowance of one hundred dollars ($100). In their 
school work the children are doing nicely and their conduct and 
advancement have been satisfactory. 
General examinations for promotion are held annually and 
individual test examinations are given as often as there is cause 
for same. The daily school hours are divided into two sessions. 
The morning session extends from 7 until 11 o’elock, and the 
afternoon session from 1 until 5 o’clock. 
The advantages of this system are many, inasmuch as it is 
made possible by its adoption to keep both manual and literary 
branches in operation during the entire day, thus affording op- 
portunities to a greater, number of children to devote a portion 
of their time to some useful course of training. It also affords 
each child more time and attention for both mechanical and lit- 
erary teachers, insuring a more thorough understanding and 
more rapid advancement. As only lady teachers are employed 
in the literary departments, every child is placed’ for about five 
hours each day under the influence and management of ladies. 
Our music departments continue to support the reputation 
they have established. Our brass band, composed of boys be- 
tween the ages of 12 and 17, is generally and favorably known 
throughout the State. There are also classes in vocal and instru- 
mental musi¢ at each of these several departments, which are 
arranged and directed by competent teachers. 
The official force of the institution has been effective in its 
efforts collectively and individually to promote the general wel- 
fare and advancement of the children.
-P-A-G-E-323
—310— 
Many of these workers are young people who have beep 
beneficiaries of this institution’s training—young people, who as 
pupils have been educated and made useful for the work they 
are now performing. Respectfully submitted,

ConpITIONS or MEMBERSHIP. 
Good moral charagter, good behavior, and regular and pune- 
tual attendance. 
Tuition free. Text books, stationery, pens and drawing ma- 
terials must be furnished by students. 
It is the purpose of the Commissioners to adapt these schools 
to the wants of those whose necessities compel them to work dur- 
ing the day. Preference will therefore be given to those who are 
unable to attend day schools. 
There are no restrictions of age or sex. 
Persons over 21 years of age, whose education has been neg- 
lected, will find a welcome to this school, and a course specially 
suited to their needs. 
The school will be cpen every night in the week, except Sat- 
urday, from 7:20 to 9 o’clock. Students desiring admittance 
should be present on the opening night.

If your Board should desire to examine the statistics more 
in detail they may be found in the detailed monthly reports and 
general rolls on file in the record book, and in the several class 
registers. The fifteenth annual session just closed has been the 
most prosperous session of the school. The total enrollment and
-P-A-G-E-327
—312— 
the average monthly enrollment have been greater than ever be- 
fore. The total number of days belonging to the school for the 
session. ending December 18, 1901, was 7,568; for the session just 
closed it was 12,369. The total enrollment for 1901 was 242; for 
1902 it was 443. There was also an increase of 42 per cent in the 
average number in daily attendance. 
I cannot too highly commend the enthusiastic and faithful 
work of all the teachers, and the diligence and admirable spirit 
of the pupils. 
I call your special attention to the large number of for- 
eigners who enter the school in order to learn to speak and write 
English. This number increased so largely during the past year 
that it became necessary to provide a special teacher for them. 
Miss Felicia G. Porter was selected for this position and has per- 
formed the duty skillfully. I recommend that this department 
be continued and a separate room be provided for this class. 
if the same ratio of increase shall continue in the school, ad- 
ditional room and additional teaching force will become impera- 
tive. Even the continuance of the present attendance demands 
some enlargement of the facilities for instruction. These mat- 
ters will be diseussed in a special report which will be submitted 
later. 
I cannot close this report without expressing my obligations 
to Mr. Joseph Carels, superintendent of the building, for the val- 
uable aid he has rendered to the school, and to the members of 
the Board of Commissioners for assistance and uniform courtesy. 
Respectfully submitted, 
W. RB. Garrett, 
Superintendent. 
Warkiss Insrirvre. 
This institution owes its existence to the benevolence of Mr. 
Samuel Watkins, a highly respeeted citizen of Nashville, who 
died in 1880, leaving $100,000 for its establishment. 
After the execution of his will and before his death, Mr. 
Watkins bought for $30,000 the lot on the corner of Church and 
High streets, on which the buildings were subsequently erected 
by the Commissioners.
-P-A-G-E-328
—313— 
Mr. Watkins stated in his will that, having by a life of indus- 
try and economy accumulated a relatively large estate, and hav- 
ing during his life tried to discharge his duty, he dispensed his 
benefactions with a proper sense of his obligations to society. 
He therefore gave the sum of $100,000 to the State of Ten- 
nessee in trust for the establishment in the city of Nashville of 
the Watkins Institute; to promote the diffusion of knowledge and 
to enable the youth of Nashville who are without the means to at- 
tend schools and colleges where the higher branches of education 
are taught, to acquire information upon such subjects as will be 
beneficial in the business of life. : 
He appointed as Commissioners to carry out his purposes 
three life-long friends: James Whitworth, John M. Lea and Will-. 
iam Cooper; he provided that as vacancies should occur the Gov- 
ernor of the State should make appointments which were to be 
ratified by the Senate; and that the Commissioners should never 
receive compensation for their services. . 
In 1881 the State of Tennessee, by legislative enactment, ac- 
cepted Mr. Watkins’ gift, and in March, 1885, the buildings be- 
ing completed, the Watkins Institute was formally opened, and 
with appropriate ceremonies dedicated to the purposes contem- 
plated by its benevolent founder. 
It was some years before the Commissioners ascertained by 
experiment the best method of applying Mr. Watkins’ benefi- 
eence to the objects which he intended; and when this was done 
it was through the agency of a free night school, conducted by 
experienced instructors, with courses of instruction adapted to 
pupils whose daily vocation prevented their attending city and 
other day schools. 
The school has both in attendance and general results met 
with marked and uninterrupted suecess since 1889. The average 
annual enrollment during this period has been about 330 pupils, 
but the number enrolled at the session of 1902 was 443. These 
are very largely the children of industrious but poor people, and 
are employed by day in the shops and stores of Nashville; and 
while in many cases they are prevented from attending regu- 
larly, and continuously through the session, their work when in 
school is characterized by zeal and earnestness; and the Com-
-P-A-G-E-329
—314— 
missioners believe that the benefits of the school are reaching the 
identical class of people Mr. Watkins desired to help. 
The good accomplished by the school attracted the attention 
of the public, and many citizens of Nashville and other parts of 
the State, after becoming acquainted with them, were pro- 
nounced in approval of its objects and its methods. 
Among other visitors was Mrs. Ann E. Webber, an estima- 
ble lady of Nashville who, like Mr. Watkins, had accumulated a 
considerable fortune by her own exertions. 
She became so far interested that she determined,without the 
solicitation or even the knowledge of any one except her attor- 
ney, to devote a large part of her wealth to aid in this benevo- 
lent public work. 
In 1902 she executed to the State of Tennessee a deed of con- 
veyance in trust of two storehouses in Nashville, the income of 
which is to be used by the Commissioners of the Watkins Insti- 
tute for purposes similar to those intended by Mr. Watkins; and 
in improving and enlarging the organization of Watkins In- 
stitute Night School and lengthening its term. 
This generous donation will enable the Commissioners to add 
new departments of instruction, increase the number of teach- 
ers, lengthen the session from four to six months, and supply the 
school with typewriters, electrical apparatus and instruments 
for drawing, ete., for want of which it has heretofore been se- 
riously embarrassed. 
The organization of the school and the course of study here- 
tofore followed is indicated by the report of Superintendent W. 
R. Garrett hereto attached; and the same for the ensuing year is 
stated in the announcement also attached. 
The instructors employed are with one or two exceptions in 
the technical branches, persons of long and snecessful expe- 
rience in teaching, and it is believed that the faculty selected by 
the Superintendent is second to none in the State. 
By virtue of the wide discretion given by Mr. Watkins, the 
Commissioners have been authorized to use portions of the build- 
ing for public purposes which tend to-literary and educational 
improvement; with this motive the Tennessee Historical So- 
ciety; the Nashville Art Association; the Howard Library and
-P-A-G-E-330
—315— 
its successor, the Carnegie Library, have for many years been 
given convenient rooms in the institute, and the pupils of the - 
night school at intervals visit these rooms and hear addresses and 
explanations on the objects of these associations. 
After these societies move to the building now being erected 
for the Carnegie Library, three large rooms will be available for 
the night school which its growing attendance will make it nec- 
essary to use.

OBJECTS OF THE SCHOOL. 
The course of study is arranged to suit the needs of two 
classes of pupils: children within the school age whose duties 
prevent them from attending day schools, and persons whose ed- 
ueation has been neglected in youth, and who are now passed the 
school age. The course in the literary department offers prac- 
tical instruction in the ordinary English branches of study, em- 
bracing the subjects usually included in the first eight grades of 
city schools. 
The courses in the three technical departments are designed 
to prepare students for practical work in the affairs of life. 
Students completing any department, upon giving satis- 
factory evidence of proficiency, as tested by examination, will be 
awarded certificates, setting forth their qualifications in the spe- 
cial departments of business, or industry, for which they are 
fitted. 
Tuition is free. No fees of any kind are charged, but stu- 
dents must provide their own text books, stationery, drawing ma- 
terial, ete. 
There are no restrictions of age or sex. 
The school will be open every night in the week, except Sat- 
urday, from 7:20 until 9 o’clock. Students desiring admittance 
should be present on the opening night, September 21. 
Good moral character, good behavior, regular and punctual 
attendance and the faithful performance of duty are the only 
requirements. . 
TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Hon. 8. A. Mynders, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn.: : 
Smm—I have the pleasure of being able to report a very pros- 
perous session of the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School for the 
scholastic year 1902-3. The attendance was the largest in the
-P-A-G-E-335
—318— 
history of the institution. The total enrollment was 262 pupils— 
224 in the white department and 38 in the colored department. 
The health of the pupils was exceptionally good, there being 
no deaths among the white pupils and but one in the colored de- 
partment, and but few cases of serious illness. 
Except for overcrowding in some of the departments, condi- 
tions were favorable for good work, and I think I may truthfully 
say that our work was the best ever accomplished by the school in 
any year. I say this in no spirit of boasting or self-satisfaction, 
but with a feeling of gratitude and of encouragement for the 
future. . 
No class of the citizenship of our State is so ignorant as the 
uneducated ieaf—none more in need of education or more bene- 
fited thereby. The teachers of the State can render this class of 
children, as well as the school, great service by putting the officers 
of the institution in communication with the friends of the deaf 
children in their respective neighborhoods. May I not here make 
an appeal for such service from the thousands of* teachers 
throughout our commonwealth ? 
The work of a school for the deaf is, primarily, to put chil- 
dren (whose deafness isolates them completely, while uneducat- 
ed, from the world of knowledge and activity) in communica- 
tion and in touch with the world about them, that they may un- 
derstand life’s privileges and duties. 
While giving the deaf language the ordinary school branches 
such as arithmetic, history, geography, grammar, etc., are easily 
- taught. . . 
From the beginning we try to teach our pupils punctuality, 
neatness, industry and politeness—matters quite often neglected 
in the home through mistaken efforts to be specially kind to such 
children. We try to make them useful and respected members 
of society by giving them daily instruction and practice in some 
trade or special line of industry. Last year results in manual 
training, as well as those in school room work, were encouraging 
to the friends of the school. 
The overcrowding which has heretofore existed in dormi- 
tories and sitting rooms will soon be relieved by the occupancy 
of a small boys’ cottage which is now being erected on the prem-

UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT. 
I have the honor to submit my annual report upon the con- 
ditions and needs of the University, together, with the reports of 
the heads of the different departments and the several professors 
and officers, describing in brief the results of the work done dur- 
ing the year 1908. Lask your careful attention to all these reports. 
Progress hag been made during the year in all the depart- 
ments. The influence of the University is growing and its serv- 
ices to the people of Tennessee and the South are receiving 
more recognition each year. The organization continues the 
same with the exception that a Department of Education was 
added last year and commenced active work on the first of Jan- 
uary, 1903. 
The needs of the University for better buildings and equip- 
ment and of funds for operating expenses were presented to the 
General Assembly by the President and a comnniittee of the Trus- 
tees. The committees from that body visited the institution and 
made an unusually careful investigation, with the result that 
very favorable reports were made. The most important fact in 
the history of the University during the past year was the ap- 
propriation by the Generar Assembly of $10,000 fur the purchase 
of land for the University Experiment Station. This is notable, 
not by reason of the size or object of the appropriation, but for the 
fact that it is the first direct appropriation made to the institution 
from the treasury of the State. The fund was duly applied for the 
purpose named and a deed taken for a tract of 36 32-100 acres of 
land heretofore known as the Thomas land, lying immediately 
westof the University farm, betweenit andtheriver. This rounds 
out our farm in beautiful form and makes it one of the best in 
the country. Grateful acknowledgments are made to the com- 
mittees and to the friends who aided us in getting this appro- 
priation, which we must believe is the beginning of a series of 
large gifts for the enlargement and support of the State University.

The year has been notable also by a number of gifts from pri- 
vate parties, as was to be expected. When the State shows its pur- 
pose to support the institution its private friends are sure to 
follow its example. A gift of $1,000 for the support of the De- 
partment of Education was received from each of the following 
gentlemen: The Hon. Robert C. Ogden, Mr. George Foster Pea- 
body, and the Hon. D. Willis James, all of New York City. Mr. 
Peabody’s gift was for the equipment of laboratories for manual 
training and domestic science in the Department of Education, 
and has been applied to that end. The University has received 
the first payment of $5,000 pledged by the General Education 
  Y. M. C. A. BUILDING. 
Board for three years from October, 1902. Suitable acknowledg- 
ments have been made to these generous donors. Contributions 
for the Students’ Loan Fund have been received from the Hon. 
Leon Jourolmon, Mr. John L. Rhea of Knoxville, Hon. Xenophen 
Wheeler of Chattanooga, Mrs. Peter Cumming, Mr. E. O. Silver 
and Mr. Arthur Curtis James of New York City. Mrs, Sarah 
Powell and Mr. and Mrs. J. Allen Smith, the executors of Miss 
Maude Powell of Knoxville, recently deceased, have established 
a fund of $5,000 for the use of deserving students, to be called 
the “ Maude Powell Student Aid Fund of the University of 
Tennessee.” Miss Powell, who for many years had been deeply 
21
-P-A-G-E-341
—322— 
interested in educating worthy, but poor, young men and women, 
originated this plan herself. The fund is to be loaned to stu- 
dents of the University in small sums for a low rate of interest, 
‘to be used by them in completing their education, the principal 
and interest to be returned to the fund and loaned to others in 
perpetuity. Mr. Frederick Lewisohn, of New York City, has 
pledged $250 per annum for five years to be used as a scholar- 
‘ship, and to be awarded to the best student needing help to com- 
plete a course preparatory to teaching the industrial arts in 
Southern schools. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association of the University is 
aseparate organization, having a building upon the University 
grounds for the use of the male students of the institution. It 
is so closely related to our University, however, that bequests to 
it are properly mentioned here. Through the generosity of Mr. 
George Foster Peabody, of New York City, the Trustees of the 
University and numerous alumni, students and friends of the 
institution, a debt of $8,500 upon the building of the association 
has been extinguished during the year. Numerous small, but 
useful, gifts of machinery, apparatus and supplies have been re- 
ceived by the library and various departments, and are duly ac- 
knowledged in the respective reports.

The session of 1908-04 has opened with good prospects. 
One hundred and twenty-nine new students have entered the 
Academic Department and ten in the Law Department, making
-P-A-G-E-344
—325— 
a total of new students in the departments on University Hill, 
at the opening of the session, 139, which is nine more than at 
the same time last year. The prospect is that the total attend- 
ance will equal that for last year. The number of scholarships 
allowed by law has already been taken. The average number of 
new students entering the Academic Department each year, 
counting the whole session, runs from 130 to 150. We find that 
this compares favorably with other institutions in the South, 
none of the purely academic institutions receiving more students 
in this department than we do. 
On the average 11 per cent of our Freshmen graduate. Our 
graduating classes are made up of students who enter the Sopho- 
more classes chiefly, and also the Junior and Senior. How 
shall we interpret this? I believe it means that persons enter- 
ing the Freshman class are very deficient in preparation and are 
also lacking in that interest in education or general purpose in 
life which is necessary to carry them through a four years course 
at college. Those who enter later come almost entirely from the 
other colleges and are better prepared and have a purpose which 
holds out better for the shorter time required. We find that the 
experience of other Southern institutions is exactly similar to 
ours. Those that have been studied show that only about 10 per 
cent of the students entering the Freshman class ever graduate. 
An incomplete census of all the preparatory schools of every 
class, public and private, in Tennessee, which by their courses 
should bring students up to our standard of entrance, shows that 
last year they graduated or brought to this point of proficiency 
775 persons, boys and girls. If we may judge from our past ex- — 
perience probably not half of these could actually pass our en- 
trance examinations. Probably not one-fourth of them went 
to college anywhere this year. Still we have to date this year 
106 Freshmen from Tennessee, a really remarkable result, of 
these 76 are men, 30 women; 11 only were prepared in 
country public secondary schools, 47 were prepared in pub- 
lic town or city high schools, 80 in private training schools 
and 18 at other colleges or universities. Of the 25 students who 
entered the higher classes this year 14 came from other colleges 
and universities, 8 from city high schools mostly outside of the 
South, and 5 from private training schools. Of the 139 new 
students entering all departments, law included, this year, 34
-P-A-G-E-345
—326— 
came from other colleges and universities, 57 from city high 
schools, 38 from private training schools and only 11 from coun- 
try schools. From the very beginning of the correspondence 
candidates with questionable preparation were discouraged from 
entering and advised to go to preparatory schools. By exami- 
nations at the University and away from here we eliminated all 
the doubtful cases. We have enough failures at the best. We 
saw above that from 30 to 40 per cent fail or drop out before the 
end of the Freshman year and 75 per cent before the end of the 
Sophomore year. After all our care not over 30 per cent of the 
students entering the Freshman class in the last 10 years have 
proved sufficiently prepared. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The highest manifestation of the present educational revival 
in the South is exhibited in the eagerness of teachers for 
improvement and professional training. This has found its 
chiefest expression so far in the great crowds attending the 
summer schools held since this educational campaign was com- 
menced in 1902. 
No movement looking towards a permanent advance in 
education can ignore the training of the teacher. The best 
‘ school plant is so much dead material without a scholarly, well 
trained teacher. The great regenerating force in the world is: 
the living human personality. For this there is no substitute. 
Between the whole system of educational machinery on the one 
side and the child on the other stands the living teacher to 
transform the mechanical into the vital, to translate material 
appliances over into more abundant life and power and social 
efficiency. Thus the educational campaign comes in time by 
the logic of its own inner development to find in the teacher a 
focal center of interest. . This is true of all our schvols of every 
grade. The training of teachers is the chief problem, how to 
accomplish it the burning question in the South today. Lven 
the inefficiency of our rural schools, the chief subject of our
-P-A-G-E-346
—327— 
solicitude at present, cannot be adequately stated in terms of 
poor buildings, short terms, and antiquated courses of study. 
The real improvement of the elementary schools waits upon the 
education of teachers and the training of superintendents. 
The normal schools of the South are doing a great work, but 
they are altogether inadequate to the demands for new teachers, 
to say nothing of the great army at present in the field needing 
and desiring better preparation for their work. From this situ- 
ation came the suggestion of a great summer school and-of a 
higher professional school of education for the whole South, 
situated at some central and accessible point and equipped to 
  JerFerRsoN HALL. 7% 
meet the needs of the teachers in all grades of service. At the 
suggestion and request of President Dabney, the University of 
Tennessee offered in 1902 its whole plant free of charge for a 
term of years for the use of such a summer school. The people 
of Knoxville, the genera] agent of the Peabody fund, the General 
Education Board and private friends of the cause made the 
experiment possible by providing funds. The whole Southern 
educational campaign contributed to make it possible by the 
sentiment for education which it had awakened. Thus all the 
interests and forces of the whole movement for which the General 
and Southern Education Boards stand were for the time merged
-P-A-G-E-347
—328— 
in the Summer School of the South, which opened first as an 
experiment at the University of Tennessee on June 19, 1902. 
This school was at once a conference for education, a propaganda, 
and a school of solid academic and professional instruction, con- 
tinuing for six weeks and touching every Southern State, every 
phase of educational interest, and every grade of educational 
activity from the kindergarten to the university. 
The unparalleled success of this summer school, illustrating 
and enforcing the demand for this training on the part of South- 
ern teachers, led the University of Tennessee, as a next step, to 
organize a Department of Education with a faculty of seven per- 
sons, a practice school and laboratories of psychology and manual 
training, which gives free tuition to qualified persons preparing: 
to teach. It is proposed at this place to tell the story of this 
undertaking for the improvement of Southern teachers. 
THe SumMER ScHoor or THE SouTH. 
This school is no mere popular assembly of teachers, but 
a university summer term where teachers can spend six weeks of 
their summer vacation in pleasant and profitable intercourse 
with their fellow teachers, while improving their scholarship in 
special lines and gaining professional knowledge and skill in 
teaching. 
The first term of the school was held at the University of 
Tennessee, Knoxville, from June 19 to July 31, 1902, and was 
attended by 2,019 persons, about 1,500 of whom were teachers in 
Southern schools. Two-thirds of them were graduates of colleges 
or of normal schools; 687 were men and 1,832 were women. 
Twenty-nine States, the District of Columbia and Canada were 
represented at this term. 
About one hundred different courses were offered, covering 
all the subjects taught in the public schools, the high schools 
and the liberal arts courses of the college. Among the 65 mem- 
bers of the faculty, eleven were presidents or ex-presidents of 
colleges and universities, three were state superintendents, four 
were city superintendents, and all were speciaiists in the sub- 
jects in which they gave instruction. The leading institutions 
in fifteen different States were represented in this faculty. 
The very large attendance of teachers at the first session and 
the many expressions of approval of the work offered, indicated
-P-A-G-E-348
—329— 
that the time was opportune, the place well chosen, and the prin- 
ciples on which the school was organized correct. The friends of 
the school, therefore, decided to make it permanent, and partial 
provision was made for its support for three years. This assur- 
ance of permanency made it possible to eliminate temporary 
features, to erect buildings and to so adjust the organization as to 
meet all the real needs of the teachers and schools of this section. 
The second session of the Summer School of the South was 
held at the University of Tennessee from June 23 to July 31, 
1908. One hundred and forty-nine different courses were offered 
in kindergarten, primary and rural school work; in drawing, 
art, manual training and domestic science ; in expression, music 
and physical culture; in nature study, agriculture and horticul- 
ture; in physiology and hygiene, geology, geography, physics, 
and chemistry; in the liberal arts, the English language and lit- 
erature, the literature of the Bible, Latin, Greek, French, Ger- 
man and Spanish and their literatures; in history, economics and 
sociology ; in pure mathematics and astronomy ; in bookkeeping; 
in banking; in literature for schools and library work, and in psy- 
chology, philosophy and history of education. A large majority of 
these courses continued through the entire six weeks and all were 
well attended. Class enroliment varied from half a dozen to four 
hundred. Besides the courses in the several departments of ped- 
agogy, numerous courses were offered in the organization and 
conduct of rural school work, and in county, city and state super- 
vision, which are recognized as the weakest places in Southern 
education. No such complete courses in these subjects were ever 
offered before in any American school. There was a model kin- 
dergarten with a director and several assistants; several model 
primary schools and a large number of model classes in different 
subjects. 
Ninety-one professors and instructors were present and did 
their full work. Of these, 61 were present the entire six weeks, 
1 five weeks, 4 four weeks, 7 three weeks, 9 two weeks, and 
6 one week. The shorter courses were connected, so as to form 
a continuous course for the six weeks. There were in addition 
seventeen lecturers and preachers who gave seventy-seven lec- 
tures, conferences and round tables. 
The school of 1902 having far exceeded the capacity of the 
halls and lecture rooms of the University, a number of large
-P-A-G-E-349
—330— 
wooden pavilions were erected for the session of 1903, which fur- 
nished comfortable accommodations for the school. A large 
auditorium, called Jefferson Hall, has a capacity of 2,500 
and is used for the general meetings and lectures. Four 
other lecture pavilions were named for the great leaders of South- 
ern education—Curry, Wiley, Ruffner, and McDonogh. Audu- 
bon, an inclosed pavilion with a capacity of 400, was equipped 
with illustrative apparatus and devoted to the work in 
geography and natural history. Ogden Hall contained school 
exhibits and model libraries. Two large dining pavilions were 
also erected. Some three hundred students found lodgings in 
  OGDEN HALL, WHERE SCHOOL WoRK WAS EXHIBITED DURING THE 
SUMMER SCHOOL, 
the University buildings. The people of Knoxville opened their 
homes to the visitors very generally, with the result that every- 
one found pleasant accommodations in private families, boarding 
houses, or hotels as they preferred. A bureau of information 
arranged these matters in advance and did much to prevent dis- 
comfort and confusion. 
Visitors came to Knoxville on account of the Summer School 
as follows: From points in Alabama 337, Arkansas 27, Wash- 
ington and North 61, Florida 72, Georgia 343, Indiana 2, Illinois 
1, Indian Territory 3, Kansas 1, Kentucky 108, Louisiana 100, 
Mississippi 69, Missouri 24, North Carolina 131, Ohio 36, Okla- 
homa 14, South Carolina 127, Tennessee, outside of Knox Coun-
-P-A-G-E-350
—331— 
ty, 785, Texas 98, New York 9, from scattering points 138, mak- 
ing a grand total of 2,506. At least 700 persons from Knoxville 
and Knox County attended some of the exercises, making a total 
of at least 3,200 perso in attendance on the school for from a 
few days to six weeks. 
The Registrar’s report shows an enrollment of 2,150 regular 
students, who took three or more courses, not including ninety- 
six children in the model schools. This does not include per- 
sons present for only a few days ora week. Among the latter 
were many superintendents of city schools, college presidents, 
members of college faculties, etc. Over two thousand visitors’ 
tickets were given for specific classes for a limited time to prin- 
cipals, superintendents, supervisors and other persons entitled 
to this privilege. 
Students were registered from 31 states and territories, and 
from Canada, Porto Rico, India andJapan. Those from Tennes- 
see numbered 1,172; 978 were from other states and countries. 
Of the 2,150 regular students enrolled 662 were men and 1,488 
women, a much larger per cent of men than is usually enrolled in 
summer schools, 847 were graduates of colleges and 1,346 were 
under contract to teach this year. Fully 1,600, or 80 per cent, 
were preparing to teach. This is the largest registration of actual 
teachers ever known at a single school. 
A series of State meetings was devoted to a discussion of 
the educational conditions and needs of the different Southern 
States, conducted usually by the State Superintendent or some 
one selected by the State delegation. They proved most useful 
in bringing out information about the schools and in stimulating 
and organizing the educational campaign in the different States, 
The fourth of July was devoted to a discussion of the educa- 
tional interests of the South at large, concluding with a patriotic 
demonstration of great.interest and power. The State organiza- 
tions marched in procession into the hall bearing State banners 
and mottoes expressing their opinions on Southern educational 
problems. The different State delegations, each of whom sang 
their songs, made brief statements or addresses. The Committee « 
on Resolutions presented a report and there were two addresses 
thereon. Following the adoption of the resolutions the State 
delegations presented their banners at the front of the platform 
and grouped them around the national emblem, while the au-
-P-A-G-E-351
—332— 
dience sang “America.” The enthusiasm for the improvement 
of the schools thus awakened continued throughout the whole 
term and has since extended to all portions of the South. 
A very valuable feature of this sess%@h was the exhibit of 
school work, including drawings, manual training work, written 
work, reports, programs, etc., from two dozen or more of the best 
city school systems in America. Two model. libraries were 
formed and exhibited. One library contained about 1,250 vol- 
umes suitable for public school libraries in city, village and rural 
schools. The books were carefully catalogued and graded and a 
catalogue published. Another library contained three or four 
hundred volumes of the best books for teachers, mostly on peda- 
gogical subjects. Another interesting exhibit was that of text- 
books, school apparatus, school supplies, etc., made by some of 
the leading publishing and school supply houses. 
The University of Tennessee gave the school the use of all 
its buildings and equipment, light, water, gas, janitors and ordi- 
nary supplies. The actual expenditure on these last accounts 
amounted to four or five thousand dollars, and is not included 
in the statement below. The school of 1902 cost nearly $17,000. 
The expenditures for the school of 1908 amount to date to 
$30,352.26. The school is practically free, only a small fee being 
charged for registration. The daily admission for unregistered 
students was only 25 cents. The entire receipts from these 
sources was $6,362.25. The balance was provided by the Gen- 
eral Education Board, the people of Knoxville and Knox County 
and private friends of the enterprise. 
Tue Department oF Enucation. 
One of the most valuable results of this great Summer School 
movement has been the establishment of a Department of Edu- 
cation at the University of Tennessee. This department aims to 
meet the demand for special professional instruction and train- 
ing for teaching which was so clearly manifested in the Summer 
School. It aims especially to prepare teachers for responsible 
positions in public and private schools of cities, towns and 
country districts; for positions as superintendents of rural 
schools and principals of town schooijs, and as teachers of English, 
history, geography, mathematics, chemistry, physics, nature
-P-A-G-E-352
—333— 
study, agriculture, horticulture, drawing, music, manual train- 
ing, domestic science and other special subjects. 
Teachers need sound scholarship and full, accurate knowledge 
of subject matter. Though their work may be only in element- 
ary schools, it will be better done if they have had the advan- 
tage of a college course. For teachers of children of all grades, 
and in schools of all kinds, the most important element of prep- 
aration is thorough, broad scholarship. Technical knowledge 
alone is not sufficient. To assist teachers who are to be leaders 
to gain this element, the whole plant of the University is 
offered freely. . 
Thirty-six courses, each extending through the entire college 
year, are offered in psychology, ethics, history of education, phi- 
losophy of education, science and art of teaching, school organi- 
zation and management, history and methods of teaching his- 
tory, geography and methods of teaching geography, literature 
and methods of teaching literature, methods of teaching English, 
domestic science and art, drawing and manual training, nature 
study, agriculture and horticulture. Special short courses will 
be organized for teachers who can attend only during the winter 
and spring terms. A ten week’s course is now offered in manual 
training, general agriculture, dairying and horticulture. 
The special faculty of the department now consists of seven 
men and women of broad and accurate scholarship in their sev- 
eral lines, all of whom have had experience as teachers in element- 
ary and secondary schools. They are aided by the academic, 
engineering and agricultural faculties of the University. 
The Department of Education has its own library for special 
work, a laboratory of psychology, a laboratory of manual train- 
ing, domestic science and art, and a model and practice school. 
On the first of January a model rural school will be opened un- 
der the supervision of the officers of this department at a point 
in Knox County convenient for observation by the students. 
A collection has been begun for an educational museum. 
Tuition is free to actual teachers and to persons pledging 
themselves to teach. The conditions for admission are the same 
as those to the Academic Department of the University. The 
school is supported by the University of Tennessee, the General 
Education Board and by private contributions. 
The Department of Education opened on January 1, 1908,
-P-A-G-E-353
—334— 
and was attended during the first term by ninety-six persons, 
thirty of whom were local teachers. It is helping to supply the 
most serious need of Southern teachers and can not fail of great 
usefulness, 
Assistance for both the Department of Education and the 
Summer School is earnestly solicited.

Amid some encouraging features of the college department 
two or three facts deserve our serious attention, 
(1) That while the total number of students remains about 
the same, the number of male students is not increasing as it 
should. 
(2) That of these fewer seem to purpose or desire to remain 
long enough to complete any course. : 
(8) That the trend seems to be in the direction of getting 
some technical training, and this only in part, with a view to 
making a living rather than to getting an education. 
Over against these is the unquestioned fact that such students 
as have completed the courses, either literary or technical, have 
met with marked success and rapid promotion. They are almost 
without exception filling honorable and lucrative positions, and 
we are not able to supply the demand for them. This would 
seem to indicate that the fault is not in the training they get. 
But whatever and wherever it is, a larger number of the young 
men of the State ought to be taking advantage of the oppor- 
tunities here offered. Respectfully submitted, 
T. W. Jorpan, Dean.

REPORT OF THE DEAN OF THE WoMAN’s DEPARTMENT. 
The Woman’s Department of the University shows an in- 
creasing activity in all lines of development. Barbara Blount | 
Hall is full to overflowing; several young women have had to 
seek accommodations in town. The life of the hall is normal 
and happy, and as nearly like that of the family as is possible 
under the circumstances. J am glad to report that the matter of 
discipline is the least perplexing question that I have to con- 
sider. The young women themselves are in sympathy with my 
  
  BARBARA BLOUNT HALL, THE WOMAN’S DORMITORY. 
views in regard to individual self-government, and I have only 
to intimate my preference in regard to any of the details of our 
community life to meet with their hearty cooperation. 
Already there are enrolled as many students in this depart- 
ment as during the entire session last year. We have thirty- 
three young women in the Freshman class, by far the largest en- 
tering class we have ever had. As a body our young women stu- 
dents are earnest and industrious; and yet they recognize that 
their duty to the University and to themselves goes beyond the 
routine of class preparation and recitation. In the larger life of 
the college community, they usually stand for loyalty and devo- 
2
-P-A-G-E-357
  —338— 
tion to existing institutions and hearty reception of new ones. 
In exhibiting college spirit and supporting college enterprise they 
stand almost with the young men. Nor are they less active in 
' fostering their own individual life as young women in the 
University. : : 
The Young Woman’s Christian Association through its 
weekly meetings, various committees and divers means of show- 
ing its spirit of friendly helpfulness tries to touch in some way 
every young woman in college. This organization, though com- 
paratively small, has always by its own efforts met its obligations 
as one in the association of colleges and sent delegates to the 
Summer Conference at Asheville and to other conferences held 
to discuss Christian work among Southern colleges The Bar- 
bara Blount Literary Society, although for the past two years 
languishing considerably after the manner of most societies of 
the kind in colleges, has this year manifested a most progressive 
spirit in adapting itself to new démands. In my opinion it is 
now doing—and doing well—a by no means unimportant part in 
the culture side of college life. Although seriously handicapped 
by the lack of a gymnasium, the young women manage to keep 
alive a healthy interest in rowing, tennis and basket ball. The 
Athletic Association is only awaiting the erection of a suitable 
building to mature plans for the advancement of physical work 
among its members. The Dramatic Club continues in close 
touch with all the interests of the women students. In the past 
it has helped financially both the University Athletic Association 
and the Young Woman’s; and now it is proposing to assist a 
recently organized attempt to erect on the campus a new build- 
ing that will contain a gymnasium for women. 
As it affects vitally the future development of the Woman’s 
Department I feel that my report must in a measure explain 
this plan. A number of the prominent women of the State, 
Jed by Mrs. Benton McMillin, have organized themselves into a 
body to be known as the Tennessee Hall Association for the 
purpose of securing enough money from the people of the State 
to erect a building that will contain rooms at a nominal rent for 
young women who are preparing to teach in the schools of the 
State, and a gymnasium for the use of all the women in college. 
As we are now forced to send young women out in town to find 
board and lodging and as for the past four years we have felt
-P-A-G-E-358
—339— 
keenly the need of a gymnasium, I am giving the association 
my heartiest cooperation. 
I feel very hopeful for the future. In reviewing the pastfour 
years 1 find that much has been accomplished. The number of 
young women in college has doubled; a large proportion of those 
entering take the regular academic work. More students each 
year come to us from the other two sections of the State. The 
women’s clubs are beginning to offer. scholarships to deserving 
and competent students. A new dormitory has been erected and 
filled. The people of the State under the leadership of some of 
its prominent women are recognizing the importance of the work 
that we are doing and are making an effort to supply our most 
urgent needs. Respectfully submitted, . 
FLORENCE SKEFFINGTON, 
Dean of the Woman's Department. 
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
ScHooL or AGRICULTURE. 
Some substantial additions have been made to the equip- 
ment of the department during the past year. The last General 
Assembly appropriated $10,000 for the purchase of more land for 
the use of the School of Agriculture and the Experiment Station. 
The staff of the Department of Agriculture is also charged with 
conducting the investigations of the Experiment Station, hence 
the work of the school and of the station are very closely associ- 
ated, and it is a difficult matter to distinguish them. Suffice it to 
say that the equipment of the Experiment Station furnishes the 
basis for the instruction of agricultural students, while on the 
other hand any material addition to the equipment of the School 
of Agriculture provides better facilities for the investigation of 
experimental problems. Thus the purchase of more land for the 
farm provides better facilities for both purposes in that it will 
now permit of the establishment of a three years rotation of 
crops, and so provide data of a more practical nature for the
-P-A-G-E-359
—340~— 
instruction of agricultural students in the management of farm 
lands in Tennessee. 
Several frietids of agriculture in the State have recognized 
the efforts being put forth to improve the facilities for student 
instruction, and have seen fit to donate valuable prizes, aggregat- 
ing $325, to stimulate our students. Mr. Overton Lea, of Nash- 
ville, has donated a pair of pure bred Sussex cattle for the 
foundation of a herd of this particular breed. Mr. R. P. Hite, of 
Gallatin, has given a pair of pure bred Poland China hogs for the 
same purpose, and other gentlemen have signified their intention 
of assisting us in the development of a truly representative 
department of animal industry in the University. Mr. Jos. J. 
Kittel, of New York Vity, has loaned a carload of high grade 
Hereford cattle to feed the present winter, thus enabling the 
  
  UNIVERSITY Farm. 
department to place before the students a better class of beef 
animals for stock judging than it has hitherto been able to ob- 
tain. These gifts lend color to the belief that the effort being 
made to develop a rational system of agricultural instruction in 
the University is being recognized and appreciated by the citizens 
of the State. If this be true it is indeed an encouraging sign, for 
it shows that there is a growing interest in agricultural education 
which has not been so strikingly evinced before. 
The dairy barn was considerably enlarged the past year by 
the erection of a new wing for the housing of the young stock. 
This barn is three stories in height, the top story being occupied 
by the seed room, where samples of all grains, both threshed and 
unthreshed, produced on the University farm can be stored 
away for the purpose of student instruction in thé classes in
-P-A-G-E-360
—341— 
cereal judging which were first instituted last year. It has now 
been demonstrated that through a simple process of selection the 
yield and quality of the principal cereals, as wheat, corn, oats, 
etc., can be greatly improved. It has been shown that the yield 
of corn may be increased 10 bushels per acre by the careful selec- 
tion of seed ears, and as a bushel of corn will plant about six 
acres, the increased value of the crop on that area of land at 40 
cents per bushel would be $24. Another course of special inter- 
est to agricultural students which has recently been organized 
is that of farm poultry. Mr. T. E. Orr, Secretary of the American 
Poultry Association and Superintendent of Poultry at the 
World’s Fair, has been secured to give the instruction for the 
present winter. 
The accumulation of experimental data on the farm makes 
it possible to place before our students accurate information 
relative to agricultural crops and conditions prevailing in the 
South, and also to provide them with reliable data relative to the 
feeding of various classes of live stock. The instruction provided 
is thus more accurate than where it has to be confined to a 
general use of text books and to making deductions from work 
performed in other States. It is certainly not stating it too 
strongly to say that the character of information furnished the 
students is 100 per cent better than it was possible to give them 
several years ago, before the accumulation of the data referred to 
made the present system of instruction possible. 
A new system of score cards was devised the past year for 
use by students of the School of Agriculture. It consists of a 
cloth cover containing a number of perforated sheets of different 
forms used in the judging of different classes of stock; also quiz 
sheets. This system requires the student to give a written reason 
for his judgment in every particular. Guide cards are given the 
students on the front of which is printed a standard or ideal of 
the breed and class; on the back outlines of the characteristics 
the ideal should possess are shown together with the points and 
regions used in estimating quality. While the general system is” 
not new, the method of application is original and the satisfactory 
work done by the students the past year proves the merit of the 
system. 
During the past year more than five hundred lantern slides 
have been adden to the collection. It is thus possible to illus-
-P-A-G-E-361
—342— 
trate largely the lectures delivered before the agricultural students 
and emphasize the facts set forth. : 
Some additions have been made to the library during the 
past year and it now contains about 5,000 books and pamphlets. 
The library is open throughout the day and as an endeavoris made 
to interest the students in reading the leading agricultural papers 
and reviewing the bulletins of the experiment stations, it serves 
a useful purpose in the course of instruction. The library is 
being more generally used and appreciated by the agricultural 
students, 
The number of students receiving instruction in all classes 
for the collegiate year, 1902-1903, was seventy-six. The increase 
in students in all classes makes the work of instruction much 
more laborious than it has been in the past, and it is evident 
that if it continues it will be necessary to provide additional 
teachers for two reasons: First, as a means of relief to the pres- 
ent staff; and second, because of the necessity of adding new 
courses of instruction and thereby permitting greater specializa- 
tion on the part of both student and instructor. Specialization 
in teaching agricultural subjects is quite as essential in the School 
of Agriculture as in any other department of the University, and 
it is a well recognized fact that agricultural instruction is just 
now assuming a proper pedagogic form and so the need of more 
teachers to cope with new phases of the work is not surprising. 
The short courses in agriculture were well attended. There 
were thirty-eight young men in the class representing almost 
every section of the State. The course was first offered four 
years ago and since then one hundred and seven young men 
have taken it. The increased attendance is very gratifying and 
indicates that the course serves a long-felt wantin our system of 
agricultural instruction, as it enables the men who have not had 
a chance to obtain a liberal education to acquire much useful and 
practical information at a comparatively small cost. It is inter- 
esting to note that most of the young men who have taken the 
course are farming in the State, and so the fear of many that 
agricultural education will lead the boy away from the farm is 
certainly not well founded. 
The officers of the School of Agriculture are in great demand 
as speakers at agricultural meetings in various parts of this and 
other States. They are also frequently called on to address the
-P-A-G-E-362
—343— 
rural schools. While these duties entail a good deal of traveling 
and require much personal sacrifice, they undoubtedly afford one 
of the best means of reaching out and helping the people of the 
rural districts. Addresses on the courses in agriculture offered 
in the University of Tennessee were delivered at the following 
places: Henderson, Selmer, Savannah, Rogersville, Cleveland, 
Jefferson City, Greeneville, Clinton, Jackson, Dickson, Cooke- 
ville, Harriman, Pulaski, Dayton, Sweetwater, Johnson City, 
Athens and the East Tennessee Farmers’ Convention. Many 
articles on agricultural education have been contributed to the 
press of the State during the past year. A large number of these 
were written by request, and the press of the State has been 
exceedingly kind and appreciative of our efforts and has seemed 
glad to assist in the endeavor to arouse an interest in agricultural 
education. As usual an agricultural yearbook was published by 
the department. 
It is a pleasure to report that all members of the staff have 
performed their work in a satisfactory manner and are constantly 
endeavoring to better fit themselves for the special instruction 
work entrusted to their charge. Mr. Fain, who was formerly 
foreman of the farm, was elected Assistant Professor of Agriculture 
during the year. Dr. Jacob, instructor in veterinary science 
and medicine, resigned to accept a position in the Iowa Agricul- 
tural College and was succeeded by Dr. Shaw, a graduate of the 
University of Pennsylvania.

There has been made since the last biennial report no ma- 
terial change in the arrangement of the courses in botany and 
geology, or in the general methods of instruction. These courses 
_ are fully outlined in the last annual catalog. With the object 
of better accommodating the agricultural students, the freshman 
botany was transferred from the fall to the spring term. This 
appears, however, to offer no real advantages to the Agricultural 
Department, and at the same time tends to reduce the attendance 
in this school, since students from other general courses are thus 
practically debarred.

  Several plans for the development of this school are under 
consideration. Materials for offering a general course in eco- 
nomic botany are nearly all now available, and it is hoped that 
such a course may be offered next year. 
It has been found that field work is a most valuable aid in 
teaching botany and geology, and with a view of making the 
most of the excellent facilities offered for field work in this sec- 
tion a survey has been begun of Knox County, attention being 
paid especially to the points where materials may be found for 
class demonstration. This work will probably require sevéral 
years for completion and is being actively participated in by 
students in this school. 
Botany is a science which furnishes much valuable material 
for nature study. The writer has spent six or seven weeks in 
farmers’ institute work during the past year, lecturing on the 
subject of plant diseases and insect pests. The effort was made 
to make these lectures educational, and it is believed that much 
good has been accomplished in a practical way. It is believed 
that much more could be done by making a tour of the State, 
lecturing on the educational features of botany before a number 
of the preparatory schools. In view of the widespread interest 
in nature study and the frequent lack of means for studying 
these subjects independently, such lectures, according to the 
writer’s own experience and observation, can be made of great 
value to teachers at institutes, etc. The writer conducted in 
the Summer School a class of students in advanced botany, . 
which, being composed almost exclusively of teachers, strongly 
emphasized the value of such work as that bere outlined. 
In order to carry out better the class instruction and be pre- 
pared for better illustrating public lectures, the stock of lantern 
slides belonging to this school has been increased by about two
-P-A-G-E-364
—345— 
hundred during the past summer, until now nearly every line of 
botanical study may be readily illustrated with the magic 
lantern. 
Several pieces of apparatus have been added to the labora- 
tory during the year. Especial attention may be called to the 
fact that most of the money spent for botanical investigation in 
the Agricultural Experiment Station for the past eight or ten 
years has been invested in books and apparatus of permanent 
value for instruction as well as for research work. The appro- 
priations for this work, though small, have, it is believed, thus 
been wisely expended, and an equipment has gradually accumu- 
lated which furnishes excellent facilities for class demonstration 
of a high order. 
The most important addition to the library for botanical lit- 
erature, as well as for all other scientific subjects, is a set of 
Comptes rendus Academie des Sciences Puris, from 1878 to 1902. The 
files of many of the more important botanical periodicals of 
America and Europe are kept in the station library accessible to 
students in this school. 
In view of the frequent demands made on the writer for ad- 
dresses before farmers’ institutes, it is hoped that an assistant 
may be provided for this school at an early date.

Professor of Botany. 
ScHoon oF HorTIcULTURE AND Forestry. 
For the first time in its history this school now has students 
from all four classes of the University, and the work of the cur- 
rent year is the most satisfactory that we have yet been able to 
do. The experiment orchard and garden has continued to de- 
velop well, and every year becomes more useful, both as afford- 
ing material for demonstration and instruction, and for practical 
experiments in fruit culture. During the past season experi- 
ments in the use of various commercial fertilizers for tomatoes 
and for strawberries have been inaugurated, and a bulletin on 
the treatment of San Jose scale has been issued detailing the re- 
sults of experiments during the year. The Western Fruit 
Grower, of St. Joseph, Mo., has asked permission to print this
-P-A-G-E-365

bulletin entire, as being the most practical work that has yet. 
appeared on the subject. 
The Junior class in landscape gardening has prepared a 
plan for the improvement of the grounds of the Knoxville Gen- 
eral Hospital, which has been accepted by the authorities and 
will be executed the coming spring. Requests for syllabi of 
“courses as given in the University have been received from two 
other Southern State institutions, and the correspondence of the 
school with practical growers continues to increase. 
Arrangements are being perfected with a prominent lumber 
company whereby forestry students can spend some time at a 
logging camp in the Great Smokies to study present methods of 
logging in the South and the rate of growth of leading commer- 
cial timbers. Respectfully submitted,

ScHooL oF METEOROLOGY. 
The year’s work has been of a very gratifying character to 
the instructor. A higher standard has been aimed at and 
attained in a satisfactory degree. This is especially true of the 
Summer School work. Although the enrollment was small, only 
nine in number, the interest and enthusiasm manifested in the 
subject was both surprising and gratifying. 
The experimental work referred to in previous reports has 
been continued with success. Although, as previously outlined, 
these experiments are of a purely scientific character, practical 
results have followed so fast that liberal funds have been pro- 
vided by local capitalists for conducting this work on a more 
elaborate scale. A special laboratory has been provided and 
equipped with electrical and mechanical appliances, and a corps. 
of expert assistants has been furnished the instructor who has. 
supervision of the work. 
The apparatus referred to in last report, for automatically 
recording river stages, forms the subject of a special bulletin 
lately issued by the Government. A model instrument is now 
being constructed by the United States Weather Bureau which 
will become a part of the Government exhibit at the Louisiana 
Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Mo. 
Public lectures upon meteorological topics have been delivered
-P-A-G-E-366
—347— 
from time to time by the instructor. An invitation has been 
accepted to lecture before the public schools of Chattanooga at 
an early date. The lecture will be given in the city auditorium 
and the schools will attend en masse, The occasion is intended 
as a step towards the introduction of meteorological instruction 
into the public schools on a higher and more liberal basis. 
The instructor has been pleased to receive requests from 
teachers for copies of the bulletins and maps issued at the Univer- 
sity Observatory. Such requests always receive careful atten- 
tion. Respectfully submitted,

The enrollment is about the same as last year at the cor- 
responding time. There has been a decided increase in the num- 
ber of engineering students and a corresponding decrease in the 
number of literary students. Quite a number who are scheduled 
as Freshman literary in the above classification are really en- 
gineering students who have been conditioned and are making 
up algebra. 
Withdrawals from the school have been fewer than usual, 
and most of those are women students. There are about fifteen
-P-A-G-E-367
—348— 
women students who are not taking mathematics. This acts 
quite detrimentally to them when they determine to try for a 
degree, as it makes them irregular and it is difficult for them to 
make up their deficiency. 
Mr. Hardin, a graduate of last year, has been teaching one 
section of the literary Freshman. There ought to be three sec- 
tions of literary Freshmen and two of engineering Freshman, 
but it is impossible for the professor in charge to teach these ad- 
ditional classes. Students would then get more individual 
attention, better work would be secured, there would be fewer 
failures, and, as a result, more students would return to complete 
their course. 
The recitation room has been nicely furnished with new 
blackboards, and the general equipment is complete, except a 
few models, which can be easily made by the Mechanical Depart- 
ment. 
Tam generally optimistic, and this year I feel more certain 
than usual that better work is being done. Very few show a lack 
of sufficient preparation.

the equipments of the School of Chemistry were so poor that the 
results accomplished were exceedingly meager and discouraging. 
The number of ‘students was also small. With the facilities at 
hand I was unable to carry out the work I had planned in chem- 
istry and metallurgy. Therefore in my first report 1 recom- 
mended the construction of a new and modern laboratory build- 
ing equipped with proper modern conveniences and facilities for 
teaching the above subjects. In that report 1 emphasized the 
importance of chemistry, especially in Tennessee, and its rela- 
tion to other sciences and to the leading industries. 
The Board of Trustees decided to construct such a building 
soon after my report was made, and upon its completion in 1891
-P-A-G-E-369
—350— 
it was called Science Hall. The commodious laboratories and 
the excellent equipments of this new building gave a great 
impetus to the work in chemistry, which then offered opportu- 
nities for betterand more advanced study. The outlook became 
very encouraging. Since that time the equipment of the Chem- 
ical Department has been constantly improved and now consists 
of thirteen elegantly appointed laboratories. This year a new 
pulverizer, a new cupel machine, and a heavy pulverizing plate 
have been added to the assay laboratory. 
The School of Chemistry has grown rapidly and the increased 
attendance has taxed the lecture rooms and the laboratories 
beyond their capacity. The high character of the work done is 
shown by the fact that much of it has found its way into scien- 
tific periodicals, reflecting credit not only upon the school, but 
also upon the University. : 
In former reports I have mentioned the nutrition investiga- 
tions which have been conducted here for the United States 
Department of Agriculture. Already four bulletins, Nos. 29, 53, 
89 and 111, descriptive of these investigations, have been pub- 
lished in the United States Department of Agriculture, and there 
yet remains to be published the results of the investigations of 
three years.

The total enrollment in the Department of Physics for the 
present year, 1993-4, is as follows: 
Freshman Class 
Junior class... 
      In reference to the numbers enrolled the most noticeable 
thing is the large increase in the number of engineering students. 
While the Junior class ordinarily contains engineering and 
literary students in about equal numbers, the present class, which 
is larger than usual, has no literary students. The Freshman 
class also contains more than the usual proportion of engineer- 
ing students. 
This tendency will necessarily call for an increase in the 
equipment of the schools and especially in physics, where but 
little apparatus has heretofore been duplicated. 
The question is also forcibly presented whether the policy 
of the institution should not recognize the increasing demand in 
this direction by decided increase in the facilities for the work. 
While the opportunity for literary education is provided to a 
reasonable extent by many colleges accessible to nearly all parts 
of our State, there is no such opportunity for scientific and 
engineering education. The broad-minded policy of this institu- 
tion during recent years has placed this University in a leading
-P-A-G-E-371
~~352— 
position in respect to scientific education, and while this policy 
seems to be justified by the character of the students now 
coming here, yet the University cannot long maintain this 
position unless it shall do much more than remain satisfied with 
present conditions. 
There has been some addition to the equipment of the 
physical laboratory during the past year, especially in alternate 
current apparatus. A motor, several transformers and instru- 
ments for testing them have been obtained. The current from 
the city electric lighting plant has been brought into the labor- 
atory at a pressure 2,200 volts. The current is brought to the 
laboratory through an underground cable furnished by the gener- 
osity of the makers. , All possible precautions have been taken 
against accidents to persons or property. 
In addition to its use for experimental purposes, arrange- 
ments have been made to use the current for lighting purposes 
in case our own plant should become overloaded or break down. 
The employment of a student assistant, made well- nigh 
necessary by the. increase in the number of students, has also 
increased the effectiveness of the work, and will make possible 
* certain much needed improvements. 
In the School of Physics there are two classes of students, 
and two corresponding needs to be met. A considerable number 
of students is to be given a general introduction to scientific 
‘ideas and methods of thought. A much smaller number is to 
be given a more special training to prepare them for engineering 
pursuits. It is not thought wise by educators at present to. 
undertake to complete the engineering training in college, but. 
rather to give the men such theoretical and general training as ~ 
shall fit them toenter on the more practical preparation furnished 
by manufacturing companies. Our students have nearly all 
adopted this course, and I am glad to be able to report that they 
are acquitting themselves in such manner as to be a credit to 
themselves, and to us. Respectfully submitted,

One year ago the School of Drawing and Machine Design 
-was united with Mechanical Engineering, with the purpose of 
correctly correlating this work, which is closely related, and pre-
-P-A-G-E-372

venting omissions and duplications which might otherwise occur. 
At that time all the mechanical drawing was removed to Esta- 
brook Hall, the home of the Mechanical Engineering Depart- 
ment. 
While no radical changes have been made in the plan of the 
work, yet we have been steadily following several principles 
which, in the end, will materially affect our engineering course, 
and which, we hope, will make it stronger in every way. 
In all our shop work we endeavor as far as possible to assign 
students tasks which are steadily progressive, bringing into use

tools in their logical order, but always working on articles which 
have some intrinsic value, either to the student himself or to the 
University. To illustrate: The first work of the Freshman in 
the wood shop is to make a bench hook, which he needs every 
day in his work. Later, when his work requires it and he has 
sufficient skill, one of his exercises is to make a mitre box. 
We are steadily planning to intensify the work in our shops 
in the early part of the course, in order to give advanced students 
more time for experimental work, and also for the additional rea- 
son that we observe that the most enthusiastic shop work is done 
by students in the Freshman and Sophomore years.

By putting our mechanical drawing-room. in close prox- 
imity to the machine shop we are able to make the work more 
useful and practical. Students are sent to study machines, to 
make sketches of them and finished working drawings. In the 
study of machine design we are endeavoring to carry out the 
principle laid down by Prof. Klein, of Lehigh, who says that 
mechanical engineering is the study of the science of machines. 
We are, therefore, relieving our Juniors and Seniors of the mere 
routine work of finishing mechanical drawing, but are giving 
them instead more of the theoretical study of machines, the 
stresses which come on them, the materials of which they are 
made, and the relative motions of their parts. 
Perhaps the most profitable work of the year to mechanical 
engineers is that of conducting complete tests of various power 
plants in the city. Knoxville manufacturers have very gener- 
ously given us the privilege of using their plants for this pur- 
pose, and we have been able to work out some very interesting 
and very valuable problems along the line of efficiency of coal con- 
sumption and the economical utilization of steam in the engine. 
By very careful manipulation of the annual appropriation 
allowed by the Board for current expenses, by the industry of 
our students and the instructors and assistants associated with 
me, and by the generous cooperation of leading manufacturers, I 
am pleased to announce that we have increased our equipment, 
either by purchase, by gifi, or by construction in our shops, about 
$2,000 since the first of September, 1902. .

There has been no material change in either the require-

This total is smaller than for several: years past. Compara- 
tively few of the high schools of the State can or will fit their 
students for entrance to our Freshman class in Latin. This fact 
together with the fact that the number of students in the Aca- 
demic Department as a whole is smaller than usual accounts, I 
think, for the smaller numbers in Latin. There may be other 
reasons of which I am not aware. . The course is stated in detail

Relatively to the total number of students in the University 
the number taking Greek is increasing, and compares more than 
favorably with the proportion of Greek students in State colleges 
and universities of other sections of the country. 
The interest of the students and the quality of their work 
are better than in the past three years. The quickening influence 
of the Cecil Rhodes scholarships is already perceptible. 
This year courses are being given in the drama, lyric poetry, 
oratory, history and the New Testament. The instructor makes 
supplementary translations from the drama and gives brief lect- 
ures on ancient Greek life. While the New Testament is not
-P-A-G-E-375
~—356— 
classical Greek in the strict sense, still it serves well to strengthen 
the knowledge of classical Greek by the contrasts in forms and 
syntax, and it never fails to interest. Its thought being in gen- 
eral familiar leaves only the form for the student to struggle 
with, and makes it possible for him to read very rapidly. 
It is desirable to make Greek attractive in every legitimate 
way; and, while it can not be entirely divested of difficulty, it 
can be made very lucid. A well known classical instructor has 
recently said: “In these days of horseless carriages and wireless 
telegraphy the learner may be led to expect a workless Greek 
book. Careful attention, common sense and some study are 
necessary.” The struggle, disagreeable though it may sometimes 
be, with plain, real, concrete facts in the way of declensions and 
conjugations is not merely a necessary means to an end, but is, 
and is likely to remain, decidedly valuable in itself. Constant 
oral practice is given on the forms and accent, but it is always 
supplemented by work on the blackboard, since errors that might 
escape the ear are at once apparent in writing.

Beginning with the session of 1903-04, it was deemed best 
to omit Spanish from the courses offered in modern languages, 
as only a one-year course could be offered together with the three- 
year courses in French and German. The professor in charge, 
preferring to have all his work in his own hands, again took up 
the work in elementary German, which had for several years been 
ably carried on by the professor of Greek, to whom his thanks 
are due. At present there are three-year courses both in French 
and German, each class reciting three times a week. Graduate 
courses are offered in both languages in addition. - 
There have been no important changes in the courses of 
study in this school, The amount of reading and other work is 
greater than in a majority of the Southern universities and col- 
leges. A careful investigation, based on the catalogs of eighteen 
representative institutions in the South, shows that the total 
amount of reading, both in French and German, was exceeded
-P-A-G-E-376
—857— 
by only two other institutions, both of which have a separate 
professor for each language. 
During the session of 1902-03 there were two graduate 
classes in German. In one class the period immediately pre- 
ceding Luther was studied in connection with Franke’s “Social 
Forces in German Literature” and several representative works 
of this period, including selections from Luther’s writings, were 
read. In the other class the old German epic poem, the “ Niebe- 
lungenlied,” was read in the original, and the medieval life and 
customs were thoroughly studied, and a comparison was made of 
the middle High German with the modern German language. 
A number of students and recent graduates of this school are 
now engaged in teaching one or both of these languages at other 
institutions. 
At the 1903 session of the Summer School of the South Ger- 
man courses were given as follows: (a) A course for beginners; 
(b) an intermediate course in reading, composition and syntax; 
(¢) a course in German classic literature, with readings from 
English translations of the representative writers, and (d) a 
similar course in the most recent literature. The professor was 
ably assisted in this work by Dr. C. M. Lotspeich, a graduate of 
this institution and of Leipzic. 
The international correspondence, which has been carried on 
for two years, had to be given up on account of the inactivity of 
the committees abroad. Many students applied for correspond- 
ents, but were not assigned by the foreign committees.

As in previous years the class work of the Freshman class 
consists mainly of instruction in rhetoric and composition to- 
gether with constant practice in the writing of themes. During 
the last two years a course of parallel] reading in the Nineteenth 
Century prose writers has constituted a part of the work of this 
class, and last year a classroom course (occupying one term) was 
given in the authors from whose works the parallel reading was 
taken, the text-book used in connection with this course being 
Saintsbury’s History of Nineteenth Century Literature. The in- 
troduction of parallel reading into the work of this class, supple- 
mented by the above mentioned classroom course, has proved 
very satisfactory and no further changes in the arrangements of 
the Freshmen course are contemplated at present. 
During the present year, as last year, the whole time of the 
Sophomore class will be given to a general course in the history 
of English poetry, with Halleck’s History of English Literature 
and Ward’s English Poets as the basis of the class work. Weekly 
themes and reports alternating with each other are required of 
this class. The prescribed reading this year, as heretofore, con- 
sists of a great number of the chief representative longer poems 
from the sixteenth century down. 
The work of the Junior class is directed this year, as usual, 
to a study of nineteenth century poetry. Wordsworth, Cole- 
ridge, Scott and the other great poets of that century are taken 
up in order and the principal works of each are studied with the 
class. The fortnightly reports which are demanded of this class 
deal mainly with biographical and critical works relating to the 
poets who are studied with the class, but some of the prose master- 
pieces of the nineteenth century not included in the Freshman
-P-A-G-E-378
—359— 
parallel reading are also assigned to be reported on. Lastly fort- 
nightly themes (alternating with the reports) are required of the 
Junior class as of the Sophomores. : 
There will be no change during the present year in the 
course of the Senior class. The work in the classroom is devoted 
entirely to Shakespeare, and about twenty of the plays are 
studied especially with reference to the construction of plot and 
characterization, but attention is also paid to questions of 
sources, etc. A course of prescribed reading constitutes a part 
of the work of this class as of all the English classes. In the

case of the Senior class this reading consists of the most part of 
works relating to the Elizabethan drama, standard works on 
Shakespeare, critical and biographical, selected plays of Marlowe, 
Ben Jonson, ete. Only during the first term a few representa- 
tive prose works of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries are required to supplement the work of the earlier 
classes in nineteenth century prose.

Constitutional History and International Law. 
I would respectfully report that the work under my charge 
in the School of History has shown little change during the past 
year. 
It is elective for law students and for members of the Junior 
and Senior classes in the Academic Department. . ; 
. The students who take it have usually acquired before com- 
ing to me an interest in historical study and some experience in 
library work. . 
The course has remained about the same for a number of 
years, but experience has led to some changes in methods of pres- 
entation. I have begun this \ear the custom of holding weekly 
half-hour written examinations on the lectures and reading 
required. 
The results seem, on the whole, more satisfactory and more 
likely to ‘prove a fair test of individual attainment in a large 
class than the ordinary oral recitation. : 
The subjects studied by the class remain unchanged. Five 
terms, or one and one-third years, are devoted to the constitu- 
tional history of the United States. It presupposes such knowl- 
edge of the general history of the country as can be obtained in 
a good high school. 
It traces the development of constitutional forms, as modi- 
fied by geographical and social institutions. from the landing of 
the first colonists to the present time. It does not seek to deter- 
mine which party was right in any of the contests which have 
taken place, but traces the origin, development and results of the 
various movements. 
The work is done mostly by lectures and parallel reading, 
which reading is in the original sources so far as they are 
accessible. 
The remaining term, or one-third of a year, is given to inter- 
national law. This subject possesses considerable attraction to 
students and is well adapted to close a course of historical study. 
It not only prepares the student for an intelligent reading of the 
foreign news in the daily papers, but it requires for its illustra- 
tion a fair knowledge of all history since the Peace of Westphalia 
in 1648. Caries W. TuRNER,

European History. 
I began my work in the University as assistant professor of 
history in September, 1900, with one class in English history. 
The number of students in that class during the fall term was 
24, and the number enrolled during the year was 35. The num- 
ber in regular attendance after the fall term was 27. 
T began to extend the history course in January of my first 
year when I offered a course in modern European history for 
Junior and Senior students. The number of students in that 
class was 22. During my first year I arranged to introduce a his- 
tory course extending from the Freshman through the Junior 
and Senior years. This course was inserted in the curriculum 
for 1901-02 and it’ includes periods of European history extend- 
ing from the beginning of the Middle Ages through the nine- 
teenth century. 
The enrollment in the different classes since September, 
1901, is shown in the following table: 
Year Freshman Sophomore Juniorand Senior Total 
1901-1902 17 9 61 
1902-1908.. 18 16 70 
1903-1904 19 9 64 
  New students usually enter the Freshman and Sophomore 
classes at the opening of the winter term. The Freshman and 
Sophomore classes of the present term are the largest I have had 
during any fall term. The class in Junior and Senior history is 
smaller than it was last year, but the number of Junior and 
Senior students in the University is much smaller. Judging 
from past experience, the number of students taking the course 
in European history this year will be larger than it was in the 
preceding years. 
The full course in history has been established sooner than 
I thought it would be. Interest in the study is increasing rap- 
idly and the work is constantly improving. The following isa 
list of the subjects of theses written under my direction last year: 
1. Historical Study of the Letters of Junius. 
2, English Intervention in Egypt. 
3. The Holy Alliance and its Relation to the Monroe 
Doctrine.

    The course of study is the same as that outlined by the 
President, with a few minor changes. It is my intention to ex- 
tend the course in economic history and also in the history of 
economics. More time should be devoted to the study of soci- 
ology, and with an additional hour allowed for each week this 
year I shall be able to accomplish more in this subject. 
The interest manifested by students enrolled in the classes. 
in economics and sociology has always been satisfactory. Much 
less effort is required to arouse interest in these subjects than in 
the subjects of history. The classes will increase in numbers as 
the student body learns more of the nature of the subjects. A 
great many people have not yet learned that economics is another 
name for political economy. The change in name is good, but I 
believe it has resulted in some unfortunate misunderstanding. 
No subject is growing more rapidly in importance.

  THE CADET BATTALION. 
Only the Freshmen and Sophomore classes are required to 
drill. Military duty is optional with the Senior, Junior and law 
students. There are 25 volunteers from these classes. I havea 
well drilled battalion for the first term, and a most excellent 
band, all cadets except the leader. 
My aim is to give the cadets a graceful, erect and easy car- 
riage, and to teach them neatness, promptness, and obedience 
to superior authority; to teach them how to enlist, organize and 
drill a company or battalion; to keep all records, and make out 
all property returns; in other words, I teach them how a soldier 
enters and leaves the service, how he is accounted for, paid, fed, 
clothed, armed, and how his military duties are regulated. 
During the fall and spring terms, five hours per week are

devoted to practical instruction, which embraces infantry drill, 
squad, company and battalion, both in slose and extended order, 
advance and rear guards, and outposts, marches, battalion 
review, inspection, parades, guard mounting, escort of the colors, 
infantry target practice, instruction in first aid to the injured. 
During the winter term the Freshmen and Sophomore classes 
devote two hours per week to recitation in infantry drill regu- 
lations and the manual of guard duty. The Junior class devotes 
two hours per week to infantry drill regulations, battalion cere- 
monies, including parades, reviews, inspections, etc.; also the 
manual of guard duty. The Senior class devotes two hours per 
week as instructors to the Freshman and Sophomore classes, and 
three hours per week to recitation in infantry drill regulations, . 
manual of guard duty and lectures. 
The military department of this University was inspected 
June 3, 1903, by Capt. Charles Miller of the Third Infantry, 
and in his report to the Inspector General of the United States 
Army he stated that the following improvements are needed: 
1. Dormitories for quartering the cadets separately from 
the other students. 
2. Compulsory military instruction for the Junior and 
Senior classes, certainly for the Juniors. 
3. A limited appropriation from the income derived by 
this institution from the United States for the payment of cadet 
officers. 
4, Provision for a suitable armory, drill hall and shooting 
gallery. 
5, The setting aside of 10 days during each school term for 
an encampment of the cadet battalion. 
6. The erection of a flagstaff on the grounds for flying the 
national colors.

about 5,000. While the library can not possibly keep up to date 
in all branches, still an endeavor is made to supply as rapidly 
as possible the books recommended by the heads of the various 
departments. This year the principal additions have been made 
in the Schools of History, Philosophy and Education. 
The students are given free access to the shelves and are 
allowed to draw two books at a time for home use. The follow- 
ing statistics will show the extent to which the library is used :

  About seventy-four of the best periodicals, both popular and

being placed in the reading room for general use. Later many 
of these are bound and are extensively used for reference work 
in connection with the Poole index. 
It is quite impossible for a college library with limited 
funds to supply the demand for new books, especially new fic- 
tion. This want is being met, in part at least, by the use of a 
Bodley Club library. This collection of books, named for Sir 
Thomas Bodley, the founder of the famous Bodleian Library, is

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. 
The Department of Education was organized last January, 
at the beginning of the winter term, and the first day of the 
term was devoted to special exercises appropriate to the opening. 
The faculty of the department then consisted of five men and 
women, but has since been increased to seven. They are all per- 
sons of broad and accurate scholarship, and all have had expe- 
rience as teachers in elementary and secondary schools. The 
purpose of the department is to prepare teachers for responsible 
positions in public and private schools of cities, towns and 
county districts—for positions as superintendents, principals, 
supervisors and teachers of special subjects. The demand for 
well-trained teachers, with good scholarship in such positions, is 
greater in the South than ever before, and is much in excess of 
the supply. The work of the department also has a culture 
value not inferior to that of other departments. 
Thirty-six full courses are offered, each requiring one year 
for its completion—four in the history and philosophy of educa- 
tion, four in the science and art of teaching, one in geography, 
four in history and methods of teaching history, four in litera- 
ture and language and methods of teaching them, eight in 
domestic science and art, three in manual training, one in draw- 
ing, one in nature study, and one in botany. Most of these are 
for students of Junior and Senior classes, and for graduate stu- 
dents. During the winter and spring of 1903-04 special courses 
will be arranged for teachers who may come here for one or more 
- terms after the close of their schools. Full courses of four years, 
leading to the degrees of B. A. and B. S., have been arranged by 
combining a liberal amount of academic work with a few required 
professional courses, and all students of the department who can 
remain more than one year are advised to pursue one of these. 
Sound scholarship is the first requisite for the successful 
teacher, and without it no amount of professional training will 
avail. Several students who entered this department last year, 
expecting only to devote a term or two to the history of educa-
-P-A-G-E-386
—367— 
tion and methods of teaching, were persuaded to undertake a 
full course for a bachelor’s degree, and are now among the best 
regular students ot the University. This should continue to be 
the policy of the department. But, above all, the department 
wants graduate students who have taken a bachelor’s degree at 
this University or another college of good standing, and have 
attained such maturity of years and thought as will enable 
them to do the advanced professional work to the best advantage, 
‘Only with students of this kind can it become the real univer- 
sity department of education for which it was established. 
- Already a few such students have entered, and quite a num- 
ber have indicated their intention to do so after Christmas or 
next fall. 
The attendance has been about as large as could have been 
expected. The total enrollment last year was 96. Of these 66 
matriculated as students of the University, and 80 were in Sat- 
urday extension classes. Most of the latter were teachers in the 
schools of Knoxville and Knox County. Of the matriculated 
students 51 were from Tennessee, 5 from North Carolina, 2 from 
Georgia, 3 from Mississippi, 2 from Arkansas, 1 from Alabama, 
1 from Texas, and 1 from Indiana. 
All the members of the faculty of this department taught 
in the second session of the Summer School of the South, each 
giving two or more courses of six weeks each, and the attendance 
on all these classes was large. Dr. Breese, Prof. Rose and myself 
also took part in the management of the school, Prof. Rose serv- 
ing as secretary, Dr. Breese as registrar, and I as superintendent, 
Credit is given by the department for work done in the Summer 
School after consultation with the chairman. 
At the beginning of the present college year an arrangement 
was made with the School Board of the city of Knoxville by 
which we are permitted to use the Rose Avenue School as a model 
and practice school. The school now has five grades and about 
120 children. In addition to the three teachers elected and paid 
by the City School Board, Miss Amanda Stoltzfus, recently of 
‘Teachers College, gives most of her time to the school, teaching 
manual training in all the grades. All members of the faculty 
of the department do some work in this school, and students of 
the department observe in the school and teach under careful 
supervision. Two or three meetings a week are held by the
-P-A-G-E-387
—368— 
teachers of the school for the discussion of methods of teaching. 
Members of the faculty of the department, the teachers in the 
model school, and students who observe and teach in it come . 
together weekly to discuss the course of study, the management 
of the school and the special problems which arise from time to 
time. Theschool is becoming more and more the central feature 
of the department. It serves the department as the laboratory 
serves a department of chemistry or physics. It is hoped that it 
may soon become a model for the study of school officers and 
teachers throughout the South. 
Since the organization of the department beginnings have 
been made for a general library of professional books and 
special libraries for the several schools. Through the energy of 
Dr. Johnson and the generosity of the publishers, a very valu- 
able collection of works on history has been made. This library _ 
should begin to collect all that is most valuable for the study of 
the history of Tennessee. Under certain restrictions a large 
number of books loaned to the Summer School may be used by 
the school of literature and language. A beginning has been 
made on an educational museum, which, when finished, should 
be very valuable to the University and to students of education 
throughout the Southern States. Steps should be taken to obtain 
for this museum a good part of the exhibits in the Department 
of Education at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition to be held at 
St. Louis next year. So large a collection would, however, need 
more room than is now available. There is great need of a few 
more maps, charts, slides and models, both for the model school 
andthe class rooms of the several schools of the department. 
One of the most pressing needs of the department is for living 
rooms for its students, and especially for the young women. 
These rooms should be on the grounds of the University, and 
should be rented to them at the lowest rates possible. 
The department is already beginning to do its part towards 
popularizing the University in and out of the State, and should 
soon be the means of bringing students to the University for 
work in all departments. This cannot fail to come about when 
its students are filling important positions in schools from which 
boys and girls go away to college. Being the only University 
Department of Education in the South projected on anything 
like so large a scale as it is, its possibilities for growth and useful- 
ness are very great.

Scrmence anp ART oF TEACHING. 
Five courses are offered in this school as follows: (1) A 
course in the fundamental principles of school education, includ- 
ing organization and management; (2) a course in methods of 
teaching; (8) a course in religious education and methods of 
Bible study and Sunday school teaching; (4) a course in geogra- 
phy and methods of teaching it; (5) a seminar for the discussion 
of special problems in theory and practice, and for the considera- 
tion of educational conditions and needs in Tennessee and other 
Southern States. 
  Science HALL. 
Last year only the first two of these were offered. The class 
in science of teaching enrolled 12 students, the class in art of 
teaching 11. This term there are no students prepared for the 
work in art of teaching, which is planned for seniors and gradu- 
ates, but the course is given, with omissions and modifications, 
for special students of lower grades. There are yet no students 
for the work in geography. The meeting of the teachers of the 
model school and the faculty and students of the department is 
at present allowed to take the place of the semimar, which will, 
however, be organized after Christmas. There are no students 
yet in the class in religious education and Bible study, but Iam

Men’s Christian Association. The class meets once a week at 
night, and is doing the same kind of work which has been 
planned for this course. As soon as the course in geography is © 
begun there will be immediate need for a good outfit of globes, 
maps, charts and lantern slides.

ScHoou oF THE History anp PuriLosopyy oF Epvucarion. 
The School of the History and Philosophy of Education was 
organized last January. During the year courses have been given 
in the history of education, comparative study of national sys- 
tems of education, the philosophy of education and educational 
classics. ~The courses in this schoo] are open to Junior, Senior, 
and graduate students. The course in educational classics is 
being given as an extension course primarily for the teachers of 
Knoxville and Knox County. 
The history of education is presented as an aspect of the his- 
tory of civilization: An effort is made to see such educational 
system in its relation to the larger life in which it is embodied 
and to see the development of educational thought and practice 
in relation to social evolution. The purpose of the course in 
philosophy of education is. to ground educational thought on 
fundamental principles. To this end the course opens with a 
study of development, first as cosmic evolution, then as biolog- 
ical development, then as progress of the individual on the con- 
scious plane, and, finally, as social evolution. From the point 
of view thus established a critical study is made of the school as 
a social institution, the problem of the curriculum, the problem of 
methods, and the problem of organization. The course requires 
some maturity and is open only to Senior and graduate students. 
The enrollment of students at present is as follows:

Scuoot oF PsycHoLocy anp Eruics. 
This school was opened last January at the beginning of the 
winter term of the session 1902-03. During the winter and 
spring terms of this session three courses in psychology were 
offered to the regular students of the University, and one Satur- 
day extension course in psychology to the teachers of the city 
and county. The course in ethics was not offered until the 
beginning of the present session 1903-04, 
During the Summer School, session 1903, with the assistance 
of Dr. Edward Lee Thorndike, of Teachers College, New York 
City, this school offered four courses for teacherr, as follows: 
‘One course in child study, one course in educational science, and 
two courses in experimental and analytical psychology. 
This year the courses in the school have been opened to 
Juniors and Seniors only. All except one (psychology 1, re- 
quired of Juniors in the Department of Education) are electives. 
The following are offered: Psychology 1, an analytical and 
experimental study of mental phenomena with special attention 
to accurate observation and description; psychology 2, an ad- 
vanced course from the genetic point of view; psychology 3, a 
seminar; ethics, an outline of ethical doctrines in so far as they 
may be understood without a knowledge of metaphysics. 
Recognizing the need of psychology in the art of education, 
due value has been given to applied psychology, or to the so- 
called “educational psychology,” in just so far as it finds justifi- 
cation in the science of psychology. On the other hand, an 
attempt has been made to overcome the tacit assumption made 
by some that the message of psychology is for the teacher alone, 
or that the teacher gets a special message different from that 
which psychology has to give to others. The laws of mental 
phenomena are everywhere operative, and affect us in every 
phase of life. Hence they are applicable to the process of educa- 
tion in a broader and deeper sense. 
About one hundred dollirs have been expended during the 
year for material and apparatus for the laboratory. No attempt 
has been made to equip it for anything more than very simple 
experimentation. 
Some of the best standard works on psychology and ethics 
have been added during the year to the library, which before 
contained almost nothing on these subjects.

The number of students enrolled during the fall term of 
the present session in each of the two subjects is as follows: 
Psychology 5, ethics 8,

Scnooz or History. 
In selecting the courses in history for this department my 
purpose was three fold: First, to supplement the work in his- 
tory in the University, and not to trench upon the fields already 
covered ; second, to present subject matter which the students. 
would probably be called upon to teach; third to give instruc- 
tion in the methods of teaching history. 
The first course, therefore, is one in Oriental History, 
Ancient Greece and Rome, a period which precedes that taken up 
by Prof. Hoskins, and one which is generally taught in the 
secondary schools. My purpose in this course is to lead the stu- 
dents to see the methods employed in the modern scientific study 
of history. They are not confined to a text book, but are taught 
to use a library, and are required to know the best sources, both 
primary and secondary, and to use them in the preparation of 
special topics. 
The course upon the Methods of Teaching History is given 
with special reference to the work of the secondary and element- 
ary schools. After a discussion of history, its nature, purpose, 
materials, and methods, there followed a discussion of a pro- 
gram of history for the elementary schools. Then the class 
began work upon American History, beginning with the Age of 
Discovery. Believing that the student must know the subject- 
matter before he can present it properly, great stress is laid upon 
the study of the subject, but the practical side is not neglected, 
as, under my supervision, this class is teaching history in the 
third and fifth grades of the Rose Avenue School. 
The third course is a seminar in East Tennessee History. 
Since last January thirty-five students have registered in 
my department. On the whole the work has been very satisfac- 
tory. The students have shown keen interest and marked prog- 
ress in the ability to use books and to carry on research work. 
The work has been greatly assisted by a special historical
-P-A-G-E-392
—373— 
library to which over five hundred books were presented by the 
publishers and by the universities. This collection is housed in 
Old College, where a very attractive seminary room and library 
has been fitted up. This library is open to students in other 
classes and other departments, and the students declare it the 
best best place on the hill to work in.

Ene.isH IN THE DEPARTMENT or EpucarTion. 
The courses in English offered by the Department of Educa- 
tion have a two fold purpose: First, to stimulate general culture 
and literary appreciation; second, to develop self-expression and 
the power of selecting and presenting material. The study of the 
literary classics is based on the belief that the effort to compre- 
hend and enjoy in their entirety such works as Homer’s Iliad 
and Odyssey, Dante’s Divine Comedy, and Goethe’s Faust is of 
the highest value in training the sense of literary form, in devel- 
oping the analytic and synthetic faculties, in broadening the men- 
tal horizon, and in deepening and directing the emotions. The 
noble and sane views of humanistic, social and religious relations 
of these great poems are important factors in character develop- 
ment and in guiding those who will later be teachers of others to 
a large and wholesome outlook upon life. 
The course ranks as Sophomore work and the seven members 
of the present class are earnest and enthusiastic workers. During 
the fall term they have finished the study of the Iliad and are 
now nearing the completion of the Odyssey. Their gain in ap- 
preciation, in the use of oral and written language and in the 
understanding of the ethical value of the best literature is marked. 
While the course in literary classics especially emphasizes 
general culture the course in teaching of literature in the grades 
lays stress upon the principles of interpretation and the art of 
communication. It includes a study of the larger meaning of 
Greek and Scandinavian mythologies; of the value of the myth 
to the child, who himself is a myth maker; of the selection of lit- 
erature suitable to the intellectual and emotional needs. of the 
growing child; of the essential elements of the short story; and 
of the vital presentation of literature thus selected. The re-
-P-A-G-E-393
—374— 
sults have been satisfactory and it is believed that real gain has 
been made in investigations of importance to the elementary 
schools. The course ranks as Junior work and can be undertaken 
only by mature students. My personal supervision of the liter- 
ature work of the model school gives the students in English the 
opportunity to apply practically the views and principles. 
The course in teaching English in the grades and high 
schools includes language study. composition and grammar, prin- 
ciples and methods of teaching rhetoric and the study of typical 
forms of prose. 
In addition to the work in the University and in the model 
school, I have once a month in Chattanooga an extension class 
in literature for the Reading Circle of the Hamilton County 
teachers. This class numbers over a hundred, and its members 
are earnest and interested. The work is systematic and of a 
high grade, and, at Superintendent Jones’ request, will be tested 
with written reviews. This work in Hamilton County I deem 
of special importance to the University. 
During the last session of the Summer School I gave a course 
in American literature and one in pre-Shakesperean drama. 
The results in both cases were excellent. The class in American 
literature had 186 registered working members, while the class in 
the drama, although small, did unusually good work, two of its 
members being college graduates, one of Wellesley and one of 
Radcliffe. Respectfully submitted,

Scoot oF Domestic Science AND Domestic Arr. 
As appears in the announcement of the Educational Depart- 
ment, six courses in domestic science are offered and two in 
domestic art. 
Courses I and IT are open to the students in Freshman and 
Sophomore classes in the college. The work corresponds to that 
done in the high school of Horace Mann School, New York City. 
The actual course, however, is designed for this particular 
environment. The work is not restricted to cookery, but in- 
cludes such knowledge as will tend to the making of good house- 
wives rather than teachers of domestic science. 
Course III in advanced cookery, for Junior and special
-P-A-G-E-394
—3875— 
students, has been an elaboration and continuation of the work 
of last year. 
With a study of ferments they learned to prevent or destroy 
fermentation, and so preserve foods; and also by the cultivation 
of a ferment they were taught to make bread. 
Typical dishes from each class of foods were cooked, and 
their composition, nutritive value, manufacture and digestibility 
studied. 
The girls show a grasp of the subject and an independence 
in practice that has been very satisfactory, a fact which demon- 
strates that their work last year has been beneficial. 
Lectures and discussion have heen held each week, sum- 
marizing the past lessons and giving an insight into the work to 
follow, 
The note books kept are neat, systematic and convenient, 
containing far more than a cook book. 
This class should be offered and required to take a course in 
household chemistry.’ It is impossible in the cooking laboratory 
to carry on allthe chemical experiments that the student should 
perform, 
A course in biology and bacteriology is a prime necessity to 
each and every student. 
The work of domestic science is to apply that knowledge 
obtained from physiology, physics, biology, bacteriology, chem- 
istry and history. We cannot even pretend to teach these sub- 
jects. But when the student is unacquainted with them it 
makes their application almost an impossibility. 
I should like to see the list of requirements for graduation 
in domestic science made out including these subjects. If I give 
“sugar-coated” science in this diluted fashion the students will 
be obtaining high school instruction, and we will stand no 
chance of competing with college courses given at other univer- 
sities. 
The class of women expecting to become teachers of domestic 
science has been the most earnest of my students. They have 
learned to plan lessons suitable for the fifth grade of the Rose 
Avenue School, and have observed the teaching of that class, 
handing in written criticisms of the lessons. Hach student has 
served her time, first as assistant, then as teacher of this class, 
under my criticism. Twice a week we have met for discussions
-P-A-G-E-395
—376— 
of the work, and for lectures on the theory and method of teach- 
ing cooking 
IT would suggest that each student desiring to become a 
teacher of domestic science be required to take the following 
course : 
Junior Year—Inorganic Chemistry, Biology and Bacteriology, 
Physiology, Psychology, History of Education, Domestic Science 
UIand1V. Electives: Domestic Art land 2. 
Senior Year—Theory and Practice of Teaching, Philosophy 
of Education, Household Chemistry, Domestic Science V and VI. 
Electives: Advanced Sewing and Manual Training. 
Until we are able to demand this much from our students, 
and furnish them with the opportunity to take this work, we will 
find our students going North to complete their studies. We 
want to establish here in the South a department that will attract 
and hold the earnest student. Courses in household chemistry, 
biology, bacteriology are all that are needed to make our course 
equal to any in the country. 
The sewing class has completed the work designed for this 
term. They have had drillsin using thimbles, threading needles, 
and cutting with scissors—means necessary in the teaching of 
primary children, Following up this idea we have applied each 
stitch in some way suitable to work in each grade of school. The 
students have kept a sampler of their stitches, the description 
and definition of which have gone into their note books. Then 
special samplers of each stitch, on muslin, were required, after 
which they put their knowledge into practice in the making of 
the various articles convenient and necessary in « work basket. 
Thus by making a pincushion, needle book, emory bag, button 
bag, scissors case, etc., they have cemented their knowledge of 
basting, running, gathering, shirring, backstitching, stitching 
and hemming. 
The sewed baskets of reed and raffia which form the nests 
for these attractive articles will be useful for holding the work to 
be done lat sr in the year. 
The bandwork course began with work inthe soft material, 
cord. The idea throughout has been to use cach material in all 
possible ways suitable for each grade in school from primary to 
high. Following the cord work came lessons in raffia, beginning 
with simple picture frames, bags, baskets, hats, etc. Then we
-P-A-G-E-396
—377— 
made chains, belts and fobs with beads, woven in original design 
on looms made by the students. 
At present the class is working on baskets combining the 
soft raffia material with the stiff reed. 
This fall we collected native materials for weaving and dye- 
ing. We feel the success in dyeing with walnut, hickory, sumach 
and pokeberries is deserving of mention, as is also the indigo 
blue made after the fashion of our grandmothers, 
Respectfully submitted,

LAW DEPARTMENT. 
The full report of the organization, progress, aims and status 
of this department submitted last year suggests as sufficent for 
this year a brief report of the changes in condition and prospects 
occurring during the twelve months past, and the causes. 
Most notable is the State law, foreshadowed in the last report, 
enacted last March, whereby admission to the bar has been placed 
upon a uniform and in most circuits a higher standard than ever 
before since the Civil War. , 
In the days following it, a generous sentiment suggested that’ 
it was sufficient qualification for a law license that a man had 
been a good soldier; and not a few applicants gained admission 
to the bar on that score. Later, social standing, oratorical gifts 
and political activity have occasionally furnished passport of ad- 
mission to this learned profession. No fixed and definite stand- 
ard of admission was prescri-ed by law. The terse provisions for 
license were that any two Judges or Chancellors, or the faculty of 
any law school in the State, may examine the applicant touching 
his legal acquirements, and, if satisfied of his qualifications and 
that he is of good character, shall grant him a license to practice 
law in the different courts of the State. 
Under this peculiar statute a varied practice arose in the 
various circuits of the State, each Judge and Chancellor con-
-P-A-G-E-397
—378— 
struing the statute for himself, and some holding, in favor of 
applicants, that the examination was permissive and optional 
(“may”), and the granting imperative (‘shall’), and also ruling 
that judicial courtesy forbade them to examine any applicant who- 
had first obtained the signature of one Judge or Chancellor to his. 
license. Of consequence, it often resulted that the lowest stand- 
ard of any indulgent Judge was sufficient to pass the candidate. 
Moreover, law schools, so called, having a charter from the 
State, were not only granting license without examination, but 
at least one was selling degree and license, at less than a year’s 
tuition, to residents and nonresidents, which would admit them 
to the bar of our State. The result was reproach and scandal to 
the bar and to the State. : 
Under the active and persistent promotion of the State Bar 
Association, and the aid of the Deans of the Law Departments of 
Vanderbilt and this University, the act was passed which con- 
ferred exclusive jurisdiction of license and admission to the bar 
upon the Supreme Court, and authorized the appointment of a 
Board of Law Examiners by it, and the making of rules’ to 
govern it. Under this law every applicant is subjected to a 
thorough'written examination, and required to prove his qualifi- 
cation by attaining an 80 per cent standard of scholarship. 
All the members of the law class of 1903 who attended the 
Board examination passed and obtained license under this new 
standard. The necessary result of the new method must be the 
elevation of the standard of legal education in the State, and 
some measure of credit to this University for its part in attaining 
such a happy condition by upholding always and everywhere 
true standards of scholarship in all its departments, and con- 
tributing its share to all efforts to better education in the State. 
Another consequence to be expected is an increase in number 
of students in this department, as soon as new applicants for 
license shall come to see the requirements of the new standard, 
The membership of this department is about equal in num- 
bers to that of last year, and is composed of students of good hab- 
its, earnest application, regular attendance and exemplary con- 
duct. They bear their fair share of University burdens and con- 
tribute ratably to its esprit de corps, and I doubt not they will be- 
come worthy members of the body of legal alumni, who are show- 
ing themselves most loyal and helpful alumni of the University. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Henry H. IncEersoui, Dean.

MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 
Tt is with pleasure that I comply with your request for a 
report from the Department of Medicine, and at no time could I 
report more satisfactory progress, both to myself and the faculty, 
than at present. 
The University was influential in the organization of the 
Southern Medical College Association, which association selected 
from our faculty their first president; and now in the short 
period of eight years the requirements for a medical education 
have been increased from two short sessions of five months each 
to four courses of study of seven months each, no two of which 
can be taken in the same year. This has had a salutary effect, 
both upon the number and character of young men who desired 
to study medicine, and has raised the standard until at present 
only those fitted mentally and morally can enter. This has 
materially added to the standing of all Southern medical colleges 
which are members of the above association, which association 
is in affiliation with the American Medical College Association, 
to which all of the better colleges of the East belong. 
T take pleasure in reporting a perfect post-graduate record for 
all of the alumni of last session, each of whom passed satisfactory. 
examinations before the various State Boards of the country, and 
led in their general average before the State Boards of Tennessee, 
Missouri, Louisiana, Oklahoma Territory and New Jersey. 
The students of this department, as you know, are not con- 
fined to State limits, but are in attendance this year from New 
York, Minnesota, Michigan, California, North and South Carolina, 
Connecticut, Louisiana, Kentucky, Texas, Arkansas and Missis- 
sippi, with a foreign representation of Japan, Hungary and 
Switzerland. 
The aim of the faculty of this department has not been 
so much to increase the number of students as it has been 
to elevate the standard of entrance requirements and length of 
study, and our efforts in this direction have met with the 
approval of the entire profession throughout the State. We 
have this year repeatedly refused to admit any one not meeting 
the requirements of the Southern Medical College Association,
-P-A-G-E-399
—380— 
and have in every particular conformed to its laws. That asso- 
ciation is earnestly endeavoring to elevate the standard and 
requirements for a degree in medicine; and it is to be hoped that 
we may continue to lead in these reforms which will make this 
department in every way worthy of a State University. 
We have during the past year adopted the rigid graded 
course, and students must complete the studies of each year 
before they are advanced into the succeeding one. 
The time for admission of students having come to an end 
for this year, I am permitted to report at college about 150 
students divided into the four years, with an increase of first 
year students over 50 per cent greater than the number last year. 
The great calamity to the greater part of Texas, due to the boll 
weevil, has reduced the number of students from that State, but 
from all other States the proportion remains favorable as com- 
pared with last year. 
We have made considerable improvement in the Bacteri- 
ological School, and are now well equipped, not only to teach 
the branch thoroughly, but to make such investigations and 
experiments as we may see fit, and our aim is to encourage this 
feature of the department. 
We take pleasure in reporting a very healthy condition of 
this department in number and character of students, in finances 
and in equipment. Respectfully submitted,

DENTAL DEPARTMENT. 
In making this my twenty-sixth annual report of the Depart- 
ment of Dentistry let me state first that the Association of Den- 
tal College Faculties has fora period of years been advancing the 
requirements for dental education. If you will permit me to go 
back over a few of the actions of that association it will possibly 
show more clearly to you and the Board the enormous amount 
of work placed upon dental colleges and the advancement made 
in this science.
-P-A-G-E-400
—381— 
To begin with, in the year 1892 we changed from a five 
months session of two years requirements to three years of seven 
months each. 
In the year 1895 the entrance requirements of the associa- 
tion for all dental colleges connected with that association were 
that of a common school education, and in 1898 a resolution was 
passed requiring the pupil to have attained a sufficient education 
to enter a second year of a high school. In the year 1900 the re- 
quirements were advanced so the student would have an educa- 
tion sufficient to enter the third year of a high school. 
At the present time, last year’s resolution taking effect, they 
must have passed the high school requirements. Beginning with 
the year 1903-1904 the requirements were advanced to a four 
years course of seven months each. This is thought by many to 
be too much at the present time, and we feel that for the South it 
is advancing rapidly, and we felt a great deal of uneasiness 
with reference to the outcome of our department until the open- 
ing period was over. 
We are pleased to report to you that while last year we had 
54 in our Freshman class under the three years ruling, this year 
under the four years ruling, we have 37 matriculates. We feel 
that we have done remarkably well under the circumstances. 
We have heard reports from 26 other colleges, and we believe we 
can report to you, with but one exception, that we have fewer 
losses from last year, in number of Freshmen, than any other 
college. 
We feel very much gratified over the outcome of this year’s 
class, Iam happy to report to you that we have 115 matricu- 
lates and 107 in attendance. You will note there has been a fall- 
ing off in matriculates of t1; however, we had a larger proportion 
of non-attending matriculates last year than this, therefore the 
falling off in regular attendance has not been so great in com- 
parison with last year. The personnel of the students of the 
school is far superior to that of any other session. 
Comparing our school with others of the South, we believe 
our record will prove the equal of any, if not in numbers, in 
instruction. 
In order that your Board may understand the character of 
work being done by this school, permit me to state that most of 
the States have State Boards of Dental Examiners who do not rec-
-P-A-G-E-401
—882— 
   
ognize a diploma of any school, therefore all students receiving 
license in these States must undergo an examination before the 
State Board. Iam happy to inform you that in the 15 years of 
my connection with the school, as its Secretary and Dean, we 
have never had a student, I mean a graduate, going before one 
of these Boards, fail to receive license. I am also pleased to 
announce to you (yet with regret) that in the last seven years 
we have had between 50 and 60 undergraduates pass State Boards 
and obtain permanent license to practice. While I regret to 
make this statement, yet it is with due pride we can report such 
advancement in our work. We feel that this department has 
made wonderful progress. Six years ago, when the present offi- 
cials took charge of this department, we had no place for instruc- 
tion or equipment. At the present time we have leased a build- 
ing that was built especially for the department and is equipped, 
so far as the equipment goes, with the very best. We have ex- 
pended something over $10,000 for equipment. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J.P. Gray, 
Dean.

SCHOOLS FOR THE COLORED. 
ENOXVILLE COLLEGE. 
Kwoxvitte, TENN., Aug. 10, 1903. 
Hon. 8. A. Mynders: 
Dear Str—I submit the following report of Knoxville Col- 
lege for the year ending June 30, 1903: 
The past year has been in many respects the best in the his- 
tory of the college. The enrollment reached 407; twelve were 
graduated. Twelve students attended as State Normal scholar- 
ship students, receiving the $50 per scholarship from the State, 
appropriated for that purpose: 
Knoxville College is under the control of the Board of Mis- 
sions to the Freedmen of the United Presbyterian Church of 
North America. . 
By arrangement with the University of Tennessee the college 
is also the industrial department of the university for colored 
students. For this purpose the university appropriated $5,000 
last year to be used in that department. This gives to each stu- 
dent the privilege of learning a trade and at the same time earn- 
ing a part of his expenses. It is the constant aim of the college 
to give the most thorough instruction in the literary department 
and at the same time provide for the most helpful industrial 
training. 
The courses of study offered are classical, scientific, theolog- 
ieal, normal and common school. The industrial department 
offers training in agriculture, carpentering, printing, blacksmith- 
ing, brick-making, wheelwrighting, baking, sewing and cooking. 
The agricultural department controls more than 100 acres on 
which is maintained a dairy of twenty-five cows; small garden- 
ing is extensively carried on and scientific agriculture is taught. 
An electric light plant is run entirely by the students and by it 
all the buildings are lighted. All the buildings are heated by 
steam from a central plant. : 
%
-P-A-G-E-405
—386— 
The college occupies a commanding site on one of the hills 
made historic by the'siege of Knoxville in the Civil War. The 
buildings number nine. The college property is valued at $125,- 
000. While the students come from eighteen States and Central 
America, yet a majority come from Tennessee. 
The expenses are merely nominal, scarcely covering the act- 
ual living expenses. Tuition is only $1.50 a term; boarding, heat, 
light, furnished room are charged for at the rate of $6.85 a 
month. Very little charity help is given, but by giving stu- 
dents the opportunity to work for wages and keeping the ex- 
penses at the lowest figure, self help is encouraged and the foun- 
dation laid for useful citizenship. 
R. W. McGrananan, 
President. 
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT FOR COLORED STUDENTS. 
During 1908 there has been a good growth and enlargement 
of the Industrial Department of Knoxville College, in which 
provision has been made for the training of colored students, as 
a department of the University. The interest in the Industrial 
Department has more than kept pace with the. growth of the 
college. 
The increase from time to time in appropriation from the 
University, amounting now to $6,000 for this year, has enabled 
us to enlarge the work very much. The department is in a good 
condition, and thorough instruction and training in the various 
branches are given. What has been done is only a beginning of 
what can and will be done. . 
Those employed in the Industrial Department include pro- 
fessors of agriculture and mechanics, foremen in carpentering, 
printing, farming, blacksmithing, wheelwrighting and teachers of 
sewing and domestic science. 
The equipment of the department has been increased by 
machinery for printing, brickmaking, blacksmithing, wheel- 
wrighting, stock for the farm, and supplies for the Chemical and 
Mechanical Departments.
-P-A-G-E-406
—387— 
The Agricultural Department, including farming, gardening, 
dairying, greenhouse culture, etc., is our best-developed branch. 
The college owns forty-eight acres, but leases adjoining lands so 
that twice that much is farmed. Intensive farming is empha- 
sized, and it is the aim to supply as nearly as possible the needs 
of the more than two hundred boarders, and thus inculcate 
habits of economy and thrift. A dairy herd of twenty-two cows 
is maintained, The most modern dairy machines are used, and 
at the same time all departments of dairy work are taught in a 
way that students can put it into practice when they leave the 
institution and take up work for themselves on a smaller scale. 
Silos, cattle barn, cream separator, butter worker, and so on, 
make it possible to teach the science of butter-making thor- 
oughly. The theory of agriculture, and all the related sciences, 
are required studies of all the agricultural students. In connec- 
tion with their work they receive pay for their remunerative 
labor. Every effort is made to create such love for farm life that 
young men will not be ready to leave the country and go into 
the overcrowded cities. 
A large greenhouse, costing more than $500, heated by hot 
water, has been built this year. This will be used for raising 
winter vegetables, and with cold frames will give large oppor- 
tunity for floriculture and spring garden culture. 
The industrial building is equipped with a 25-horse power 
engine, a dynamo capable of lighting 250 lamps of 16-candle 
power, a circular saw, planer, lathes and work benches, with out- 
fits for tools for work in wood. Sloyd is taught to the students 
of the grades pursuing a regular course. The more advanced 
ones are given a regular course in carpentering. They are under 
the direction of a competent foreman, and produce many articles 
to be sold for the market price. They are made familiar with 
the tools, and are taught how to care for them and how to keep 
them in order. 
An addition of a room to the mechanical building provides 
for the newly introduced department of blacksmithing, while a 
wheelwrighting room and paint room are found in the same 
building. 
The printing room, equipped with a large cylinder press and 
such other machinery as is needed in an ordinary office, does a 
large business in catalog, circular and commercial lines.
-P-A-G-E-407
—388— 
Almost a million bricks were made in the college brick-yard 
the past season. A part of these have been used on the college 
property but the most have been disposed of on market. 
A bakery and laundry provide instruction in these lines and 
do the work for the college. 
In the Industrial Department students are taught useful 
- trades and at the same time have constantly impressed on them 
the nobility of labor. A large number of the students earn all 
their expenses by working during the summer in the brick-yard 
or on the farm and during the school year, as they are able, with- 
out crippling their class work. 
The military company is in good condition. Drills are held 
twice a week. The company numbers about 85. It is equipped 
with guns received from the Government through the University. 
A summer school was held last year, for six weeks, during 
the same time of the Summer School of the South at the Uni- 
versity. A splendid spirit was manifested. The enrollment was 
191. A very great interest was shown in all departments but 
especially in those connected with industrial work. Plans are 
already made for a similar school to be held next summer. Pros- 
pects for a large attendance are good. 
One large room is devoted exclusively to dressmaking and 
another to plain sewing. Two teachers of practical experience 
superintend the work. Opportunity is given the students to 
acquire skill in cutting and fitting, provided they have sufficient 
practice in the use of the needle. Lessons are given daily to all 
girls, in plain sewing, in classes from the second year primary to 
the eighth year training, inclusive. Lessons in dressmaking are 
given daily to all girls in the Normal and Collegiate Departments, 
The sewing machine is used by those who have acquired skill in 
the use of the needle. All the work is done by strict inspection, 
and no garment is allowed to leave the room without examina- 
tion by the teacher. No girl is graduated who has not made her 
graduating outfit entire. ue 
In addition to the cooking of the Boarding Department, all 
of which is done by the students under the direction of the 
Superintendent, special instruction is given in a course of scien- 
tific cooking. The chemistry of foods, the principles of health- 
ful preparation of food, courses in plain cooking, invalid cook- 
ing, and fancy cooking, are taught in this department.
-P-A-G-E-408
—389— 
The attendance in all departments of the college thus far 
has reached about 350. Many more will enter after the holidays. 
Those who take industrial training number about 200, of whom 
59 have received appointments as State students.

APPOINTMENT COMMITTEE. 
As chairman of the Appointment Committee of the Univer- 
sity, I desire to make the following report of positions filled since 
my last report. All of these positions have not been obtained 
by the immediate help of the committee, but are inserted to 
make the report as complete as possible. 
Again the supply has not been equal to the demand. Since 
September 1 a number of requests for good teachers have been 
received, but we were compelled to reply that we had none avail- 
able. The small number of graduates this year will hamper the 
committee in its efforts to further the cause of education by 
supplying first-class teachers. The fact that first-class teachers 
are in such demand is to me indicative of an increased interest 
along educational lines. A study of the list will show that 
many of our strongest graduates are going out of the State be- 
cause they thus obtain better positions and better salaries.

ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
Unber THE AUsPICEs or THE AMERICAN Baptist Home Mission 
Socrety or New York. 
GENERAL PURPOSE. 
The general object of this old and well-known institution is 
stated in a plain and straightforward way in the official cat- 
alogue to be ‘‘to furnish the elements of a solid and liberal Chris- 
tian education for negro youth.’’ It has been founded and main- 
tained in the belief that the negro, as a man, needs, is capable of 
receiving, and hence is entitled to, the same training as any other 
Iman. 
A comparison of the curriculum of the university with that 
of schools of similar grade for whites will show that there -is 
no attempt to make psalm-singing and Sunday school instruction 
a substitute for genuine and severe mental discipline. The gen-
-P-A-G-E-411
—392— ‘ 
eral theory of the school is that whatever line of activity a man 
may pursue, his greatest need will always be the power to think 
correctly and to act righteously. The school aims, therefore, to 
send out from year to year not.a given number of carpenters or 
blacksmiths or shoemakers, nor yet a given number of preachers 
and teachers, but a given number of men and women, trained in 
mind and heart and prepared to fill ereditably any niche in life 
to which Providence may assign them. 
RESULTS. 
That the graduates are able to do this and are doing it, may 
be seen from the statement that the ninety-one living graduates 
from the college department of Roger Williams University are 
today to be accounted for as follows: 
Pastors of important churches, 10; presidents of other col- 
leges, 6; teachers on college faculties, 5; principals of high 
schools and academies, 9; principals of city schools, 9; teachers 
in city or important schools, 14; practicing physicians, 9; attor- 
neys at law, 5; business men, 10; pursuing further study, 5; 
wives, not otherwise included, 2; United States Consul, 1; Unit- 
ed States mail service, 1; present occupation unknown to writer, 
5. Total, 91. 
These are all honored and respected members of their sev-' 
eral communities, the leaders of thought among their people and 
a mighty, conservative, uplifting force in the various depart- 
ments of complex social life. 
Tue Past Yuar’s Work. 
The school closed on May 20 a very successful and satisfac- 
tory year. The work has been quiet and steady and character- 
ized by a more serious spirit and a more earnest devotion to the 
business in hand than for several years past. The high standard 
of the past as to scholarship and conduct has been rigidly main- 
tained. The faculty has been a unit in the conviction that it is 
far more important to have a good school than to have a large 
one. The enrollment for the year was 218; boys 127, girls 91. 
The college department numbered 32. Twelve men were grad- 
uated from the college department and 21 from the other de- 
partments—theological, academic and normal.
-P-A-G-E-412
—393— 
While the school does not claim to be particularly active 
along ‘‘industrial’’ lines, still all the work in the care of build- 
ings and grounds, repairs, ete., has been done by the students, 
and a very ereditable 16-page college journal has been issued 
from the printing department regularly each month of the school 
year except the first. 
Sewixe DEPARTMENT. 
We are justly proud of our sewing department, which in 
point of painstaking and conscientious instruction and in point 
of enthusiasm and genuine improvement is not excelled by much 
larger and better known institutions. Over 400 different arti- 
cles were made by the girls in the course of the year’s instruction, 
and many of the girls made duplicate patterns, etc., to carry 
home for the purpose of instruction and use there. 
CARE OF THE GIRLS. 
Though the young ladies have been governed much more 
strictly than in some institutions of which we know, the most 
eordial relation has existed throughout the year between the 
girls and the preceptress. There has seemed to be a most hearty 
and encouraging response to the earnest effort to give them the 
very best possible instruction and advice on all questions af- 
fecting life and conduct. 
Reuicious INTERESTS. 
The study of the Bible is made a part of the regular work of 
the school and is on the program along with the languages and 
mathematics. In addition to this, there have been during the 
year three regular, voluntary classes meeting weekly for the 
study of missionary topics and fields. Missionary meetings are 
held on the first Sunday night of each month, at which the en- 
tire resident school is present. Several of the best students are 
prayerfully considering the question of service in the foreign 
field. 
Twelve of the students were hopefully converted during the 
year. At the close of the year not one of the boarding girls and 
only two or three of the boarding boys remained unconverted. 
The prospects for the coming year are very good. The mot-
-P-A-G-E-413

to and effort will be the same as heretofore—not quantity but 
quality, reality not sham. Respectfully submitted, 
P. B. Guernsey, 
President. 
  
FISK UNIVERSITY. 
  
The year 1902-3 has been a very prosperous one at Fisk 
University, We have catalogued the largest number of stu- 
dents for many years—518, and our largest college department 
and our largest graduating class, the former 93, the latter 21. 
The quantity of the student body has been fully matched by 
its quality. Our students come to us from all the Southern 
States, with a few from the North and the West. As the years 
go by the secondary schools are furnishing us better equipped 
students for the college. 
The demeanor of the students has been excellent. The young 
men of their own accord formed a self-government club early in 
the year. Discipline has, consequently, been easy and the faculty 
have been able to devote their entire energies to their teaching. 
The graduating class numbered five young women and four- 
teen young men. The young women and about one-half of the 
young men are to teach; the remainder of the class will pursue 
medicine, theology or the law; the doctors largely outnumbering 
the other two professions. They bid fair to keep up the tradi- 
tions of Fisk, viz.: That its alumni work along the line that 
they have been educated. In this connection it might be said 
that we keep a close tally of our alumni and publish every year 
their present occupation, and stand ready to prove that our out- 
put is beg employed for the purpose for which a college educa- 
tion fits them to a much larger extent than is true of the Eastern 
institutions offering the same kind of an education. 
During the last year we have arranged for a new course, a 
teachers’ college course. This is offered in the junior year, and 
is optional with German. It includes pedagogy and kindred stud- 
jes with the opportunity to teach in the practice school under the

eye of a trained normal graduate. This teacher not only holds 
a diploma from an Iowa normal school, but has also had several 
years’ experience at the head of a normal school. The teaching 
force has been strengthened by the appointment as professor of 
T. W. Talley, A. M., who for several years has taught at Tus- 
kegee Institute, and who belongs to several national societies of 
chemists in Europe and America. He is an alumnus of Fisk, as 
is also another professor, J. W. Work, A. M., who next year will 
return to the university after a four years’ absence in charge of 
the Jubilee Singers. 
Our institution is glad to feel that it is affording a contri- 
bution to the great commonwealth which has chartered it toward 
universal education.

PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The object of the Peabody Board in maintaining scholar- 
ships in the Peabody College for Teachers is to affect public edu- 
cation in the South through thoroughly and professionally edu- 
cated teachers; and the accomplishment of this purpose implies 
on the part of teachers high moral aims; capacity to teach; a 
knowledge of the history, theory and art of education, and the 
pursuit of teaching as a vocation.

The present number of scholarships is 192, divided as fol- 
lows: Tennessee, 33; Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Vir- 
ginia, 18 each; Arkansas, 17; Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi 
and South Carolina, 13 each; West Virginia, 10; Florida, S. 
The holder of a scholarship receives $100 per year—$12.50 
per month for eight months—and railroad fare (which does not 
inelu'c charges for meals or sleeping-cars) to Nashville, and re- 
turn home by the most direct continuous route. Railroad tickets 
will, when practicable, and when desired, be supplied to schoiar- 
ship students, before leaving home; when this is not done the 
railroad fare will be refunded after arrival at the college. 
It is the present intention of the Peabody Board to main- 
tain these scholarships until June, 1904. 
Payments to holders of scholarships cover only the time of 
actual attendance; return railroad fare will not be paid to those 
who leave the college before the end of the year. 
Scholarships will be withdrawn for irregular attendance; 
for failure to report at the beginning of the year; for unsatisfac- 
tory scholarship or conduct; and for failure to pay board bills. 
At the close of the collegiate year, the president of the col- 
lege will notify State Superintendents of the number of vacan- 
cies to be filled from their respective States, and furnish a list 
of non-scholarship students attending the college who are deemed 
worthy of appointment. If these nominations are not acted on 
within two weeks after being forwarded, the persons named can 
be enrolled as scholarship students. 
State Superintendents are expected to determine by compet- 
itive examination the merits of applicants for scholarships; to 
secure uniformity, the questions to be used will be furnished 
them by the president of the college for distribution to the ex- 
aminers. : 
These questions, with specific instructions for use, should be 
sent to the examiners in sealed envelopes, which are not to be 
opened till the hour for examination. 
The most satisfactory results have been obtained by having 
the papers, handed in by competitors, graded at the college by a 
eommittee from the faculty, appointed by the president. 
In the award of scholarships, preference is given, all other
-P-A-G-E-424
—403— 
- things being equal, to students who have been in the college one 
or more years, without scholarships, and have there demonstrat- 
ed their fitness for teaching. , 
The qualifications of a competitor for a scholarship are as 
follows: The applicant must not be less than 17 years of age, nor 
more than 30; of good moral character; in good health; with no 
physical defects, or habits which interfere with success in teach- 
ing; and must be willing to sign the pledge hereinafter included. 
The task of the examiners will be simplified by making a 
preliminary examination, as suggested above. Good health is in- 
dispensable. Any candidate who has a chronic affection, such as 
weak lungs or weak eyes, should be rejected at once. 
The use of tobacco in any form is a disqualification for a 
scholarship. 
If it should appear that a candidate intends to use his 
scholarship chiefly as a means of securing an education, or of 
ultimately preparing for some profession other than teaching, 
he should not be allowed to compete. 
Persons of indolent temperament, of slovenly habits, or 
vicious disposition, should be rejected at once. 
When a choice must be made between a young man and a 
young woman whose examination papers are of equal merit, the 
former should be preferred. This is not intended to discrim- 
inate against women, but it is thought that men will more prob- 
ably continue the vocation of teaching. . 
As fitness for teaching involves other qualities besides pro- 
ficieney in studies, scholarships will be withdrawn from stu- 
dents who have habits or elements of character incompatible 
with the teacher’s office. 
For the minimum literary qualifications required of all stu- 
dents matriculating for a degree, see ‘Conditions of Admission,”’ 
page 16. 
Students who have by competitive examination obtained 
scholarships are exempt from further examination for admission 
to the college. 
Students taking the competitive examination for a scholar- 
ship and failing to secure it, may enter the college without addi- 
tional examination on production of a certificate from the State

satisfactory. 
The scholarships for Tennessee are awarded only on com- 
petitive examination held by the State Superintendent of In- 
struction, usually through the Superintendents of the counties 
composing the senatorial district for which the vacancy exists. 
Students receiving scholarships will be required on registra- 
tion at the college to sign this scholarship pledge:

State or TENNESSEE, 
DrpaRTMENT oF Pusiic Instruction. 
NasHviiz, March 17, 1903. 
Vacancies having occurred in the office of County Super- 
intendent in the counties of Cumberland, Roane and Moore, the: 
State Board of Education ordered a special examination to be 
held in those counties March 26, 27 and 28 for the purpose of 
examining applicants who desired to become candidates for 
County Superintendent. The following letter was addressed to 
the Chairman of the County Court of the respective counties: 
Dear Str—The State Board of Education has fixed Thurs- 
day, Friday and Saturday, March 26, 27 and 28, as the time and 
the courthouse as the place for a special examination of those 
who desire to become candidates for the office of County Super- 
intendent. 
It is your duty under the law to appoint three good, capable 
citizens of your county to conduct this examination—men who 
are neither interested in nor related to any of the applicants for 
office. Please make these appointments and send me at once the 
name and postoffice address of the three men selected by you so 
that I may send questions and instructions to them. 
This special examination is made necessary by reason of 
the fact that the records of this office show that a legal election 
for County Superintendent was not held in your county at the 
regular term of the January Court, and there is no one that we 
ean legally recognize in sending out instructions and blanks. 
Yours very truly,

INSTRUCTIONS GOVERNING THE EXAMINATION OF 
CANDIDATES FOR COUNTY SUPER- 
INTENDENTS. 
Start or TENNESSEE, 
DEPARTMENT OF PuBLic INSTRUCTION. 
NASHVILLE, March 20, 1903. 
The examination of those who expect to be candidates for 
‘County Superintendent will be held on March 26, 27 and 28, at 
the county seat, and on no other date. Questions have been pre- 
pared upon every subject provided by law to be taught in the 
public schools. These questions are mailed direct to the Exam- 
ining Board in three envelopes, upon the outside of which are in- 
dicated the subjects contained in them and the date when such 
‘subjects shall be given to applicants. 
The Board of Examiners shall meet daily at 8:30 each morn- 
ing and, in the presence of the applicants, break the seal and 
-open the envelope containing questions for that day only. The 
questions should be placed upon’a blackboard, subject by sub- 
jeet, and each subject should be completed before another is 
placed upon the board. No communication shall be permitted 
among applicants, and it would be best if they could occupy sep- 
arate seats. After questions are placed upon the board, no ap- 
plicant should be permitted to leave the room until the examina- 
tion upon that subject is completed. If the applicant does leave 
the room, then such person should not be permitted to answer 
questions then on the board upon his return. 
I recommend that the Board, after the first morning, fix the 
hour for opening, closing, and dinner. So arrange the examina-° 
tion that the subject upon the board will be entirely completed 
before adjournment for dinner and that in the afternoon the 
‘subject then upon the board shall be completed before adjourn- 
ment for the day. : 
The especial duty of the three men appointed by the Chair- 
man of the County Court is to see that this examination is con- 
ducted fairly and impartially. Simply place the questions upon 
‘the board; let each applicant for himself answer the questions;
-P-A-G-E-437
—416— 
do not permit conversation among applicants or friends; let the 
examination be so conducted that there can be question about its 
fairness. I desire that the applicants receive grades upon their 
answers fairly and freely made, without assistance from any 
source. 
Let each applicant write his name and address and county 
upon every sheet of paper used in answering the questions, so 
that the papers may not be confused when transmitted to me. 
‘When the examination is completed, all papers should be 
packed in one bundle and either mailed or expressed to me at 
Nashville, and with them this certificate: 
“The examination of applicants for County Superintend- 
ent was conducted by the committee appointed by the Chairman, 
and in accordance with the regulations of the State Superin- 
tendent in every respect. No communication was permitted 
among applicants, and no aid was allowed any person; and in 
all other respects the specific instructions of the State Super- 
intendent were follewed, and this examination was honestly, 
fairly, and impartially conducted.’’ 
The questions should be returned to this office at once, so 
that papers can be graded and applicants notified of the result.

To County Superintendents in Tennessee: 
We have arranged for a one-fare rate on all roads in Tennes- 
see for the Educational Conference to be held here beginning on 
the night of April 7. Be sure to see that you get a round trip 
ticket for one fare, plu’ 25 cents. If your agent refuses, take a 
regular ticket and be sure to get his receipt for the same. If you 
eannot buy a ticket through to Nashville, buy it to the nearest 
point and then buy another, taking a receipt both times. Ask for 
a round trip ticket. 
This conference is open to everybody that may wish to at- 
tend and I hope for a large attendance of superintendents, di- 
rectors, magistrates, teachers and friends of our public schools. 
Please see that your newspaper this week contains a good 
notice of the conference and its purposes, with the statement that 
a one fare rate has been secured. 
As I notified you last week, I have arranged to refund the 
railroad fare of all superintendents attending, but of course can- 
not pay the fare of other persons. If you cannot come yourself, 
I authorize you to deputize some person to come for you, and in 
that case the railroad fare of that party will be paid, provided I 
have a written notice from you. 
Let us make this the greatest educational gathering in the 
history of the South. Very truly yours, 
Seymour A. MynprErs, 
State Superintendent.

The Peabody State Institute for East Tennessee has been 
combined with the Summer School of the Knoxville College, R. 
W. McGranahan, President. : 
State Institutes for the colored teachers of Tennessee will 
be held in the three grand divisions of the State at Columbia, 
Union City and Knoxville, respectively. These institutes will 
continue three weeks. Institutes have been located at these points 
with the hope that they will be accessible to a large number of 
teachers. 
Instructors have been selected because of their ability, ex- 
perience, success and recognized efficiency in school work in all 
its departments. This is a summer school of methods for teach- 
ers, and the work will embrace all subjects required by law to be 
taught in the primary and secondary public schools of Tennessee. 
The work will be thorough, practical, systematic and in accord- 
anee with the mest improved methods of teaching, school man- 
agement and supervision. The institute is a business institution 
for teachers, and is eenducted by authority of the State, and un- 
der the supervision of the State Superintendent. 
The econdneter, as the presiding officer, after conference with 
the members of the faculty, will assign instructors and teachers 
their work from day to day, determine the order of business, the 
time of meeting, the number of hours consumed daily, and upon 
advice of the members will make other necessary regulations for 
the convenience of the teachers and the success of the institute. 
Supplementary work, lectures upon school law, school man- 
agement, the best method of conducting institutes, ete., will be 
an important feature. All local arrangements will be made by 
the Citizens’ Committee.

ROLL OF HONOR CERTIFICATES. 
The State Institutes were established and are now main- 
tained as summer schools for teachers. Under this law, all teach- 
ers must be examined annually, except those holding diplomas 
from the Peabody Normal College, or those receiving certificates 
from a State Institute. The course requires two years for com- 
pletion. The primary course should be taken the first year, and 
the secondary the next year. Teachers, however, may take the 
work in either primary or the secondary course at will, Any 
teacher may take the primary examination, but the secondary 
examination will not be allowed any teacher, except such per- 
sons as may present a primary certificate from a State Institute. 
All teachers taking the primary course who stand a satisfactory 
examination will be given a certificate freeing them from county 
examination for one year; all teachers who successfully pass 
an examination upon the secondary branches will be given a Roll 
of Honor Certificate, which exempts them from examination for 
a period of four years. No teacher will be permitted to stand 
either examination or receive either certificate unless such teach- 
er has attended this or another State Institute at least fifteen 
days. 
There will be a secretary of the faculty, whose duty will be 
to keep a correct record of the daily attendance. Certificates will 
be signed by the State Superintendent, the conductor and secre- 
tary of the institute. 
At the close of the institute the faculty will examine all 
teachers who desire certificates in either the primary or second- 
ary public school courses. The examination will be of ques- 
tions upon all subjects required by law to be taught in the pub- 
lic schools. In addition to these questions, teachers should also be 
examined on school management, theory and practice, school law, 
and the examination should have especial reference to the work 
performed in the institute. The papers of each applicant will be 
graded by the instructors, after which the questions, answers and
-P-A-G-E-474
—455— 
grades of all teachers upon all subjects will be securely packed 
and expressed to the State Superintendent at Nashville. The 
State Board of Education will regrade papers of this examina- 
tion and mail certificates and diplomas to those entitled to re- 
ceive them. The faculty will elect a seeretary, who will keep a 
correct record of the name, postoffice address, and daily attend- 
ance of each teacher. This record must be enclosed. with ques- 
tions to be expressed to this office. The conductor of the insti- 
tute will make a written report, giving the number, name, pest- 
office address, and daily attendance of all teachers. He will also 
report fully upon the work done in the institute, interest mani- 
fested, and such other information as will be of use to this de- 
partment generally, and which will be ineluded in the annual 
report of institute work in Tennessee. All certificates when 
signed by the State Superintendent, conductor, and secretary of 
the institute will be mailed direct to teachers according to the list 
furnished in the above report. 
Those desiring further information eoneerning either insti- 
tute should confer with Superintendent P. W. Dodson, Colum- 
bia; R. W. MecGranahan, Knoxville; Superintendent J. W. 
Moore, Union City.

NASHVILLE, May 16, 1903. 
To all Friends of Public Education in Tennessee: 
The work of preserving the Hermitage and retaining therein 
all the relics and mementoes of the great Jackson has long been a 
cherished plan of the Ladies’ Hermitage Association.” 
A recent movement has been inaugurated to purchase all the 
belongings, relics, mementoes and curios now the the property of 
Col. Andrew Jackson, the grandson of the ‘‘Old Hero.’’? Un- 
less purchased soon these relics will be sold out of the State and 
be lost forever to the Hermitage and to Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-475
—456— 
To prevent this loss, and to establish the relics in the Her- 
mitage, I have appointed Wednesday, May 20, to be observed 
throughout the public schools of the State as ‘‘Jackson Day,’’ 
when patriotic exercises, bearing on the life and character of An- 
drew Jackson, will be held. In addition to the exercises a more 
substantial feature will be contributions of 10 cents from every 
man, woman and child who attends these exercises. This plan is 
proposed not only for the public schools but for the private in- 
stitutions also. 
Principals, superintendents, teachers, will you not join with 
us in this enterprise, and by sending your contributions. aid in 
preserving to the Hermitage and to the State these priccless rel- 
ies? : 
The Nashville Daily News will act as treasurer for this fund 
and all moneys may be sent to the ‘‘News,’’ this city. 
Very sincerely yours, 
Seymour A. Mynprrs, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
TENNESSEE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association will hold its next 
meeting at Monteagle, July 28-31, 1903. 
All friends of education are eligible to membership, and we 
hope to have the largest attendance in the history of the associa- 
tion. : 
We have arranged for a one fare rate for the round trip on 
all railroads, and the Monteagle Assembly gives us the priv- 
ilege of its grounds, without charge, for the week. Some of their 
best attractions are on the program for the week of this meeting. 
This is an excellent opportunity to spend a week’s vacation 
at the most delightful summer resort in the South, and at the 
same time attend the meeting of your State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion. / 
Every school official and teacher in Tennessee should be a 
member of this association.

‘The program is being prepared and will be issued in a few 
days. 
For particulars address Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, Chairman of 
Executive Committee, or S. A. Mynders, Secretary, Nashville. 
County Superintendents will see that their teachers are in- 
formed of this meeting, and newspapers are requested to call at- 
tention to it.

° NASHVILLE, TENN., June 18, 1903. 
To County Superintendents: 
At a meeting of the State Board of Education held June 13, 
1903, the State Superintendent was authorized to renew for one 
year all ‘‘Four Year Roll of Honor Certifieates’’ from Peabody 
State Institutes, where the holder has been engaged in teaching 
and the County Superintendent will state that his work hag been 
satisfactory. 
In such eases write on back of Roll of Honor Certificate, 
“The holder of this certificate is entitled to renewal of same in 
aecordance with regulation of State Board of Edueation,’’ and 
sign your name as County Superintendent. Have the certificate 
sent me for renewal. Very truly yours,

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
DepParTMENT OF PuBLic INSTRUCTION. 
Nasuviiis, June 9, 1903. 
To County Superintendents: 
The act passed by the last Legislature making the school and 
civil districts coextensive will take effect August 1. Under this 
act, in all distriets not heretofore coextensive, directors will be
-P-A-G-E-477
—458— 
elected at a special election to be held on the first Thursday in 
August, but in all districts where the school and civil districts are 
already coextensive, no election will be held. Directors elected 
in August shall serve until the regular election in 1904. All di- 
rectors elected in August of this year will qualify on the first 
Monday in September. 
The present directors should take the scholastic population 
this year as usual, on the blanks furnished by this office. In the 
eolumn marked ‘‘Civil Distriet in which Child Lives,’’ the per- 
son taking the census should be careful to note the number of the 
civil district. The County Superintendent will then be able to 
prepare for the State Superintendent and the County Trustee, as 
required by law, the census by civil districts. Do not pay any 
clerk for taking census until he has filed with you reports in full 
for all schools taught in his district for scholastic year ending 
June 30. 
For schools opening the first of September, the present di- 
rectors have the right to contract; for schools opening after that 
time, except where it has been the custom to elect at the close of 
the previous term, the new directors should elect and contract. 
Under this act, no schcol can be maintained with a scholastic 
population of less than seventy. This does not mean attend- 
ance. This clause does not necessarily abolish any school that 
should be continued, as the act provides that where the scholastic 
population is less than seventy the school may be maintained if 
by abolishing the same would require children to walk over two 
and one-half miles to another school, of if there are natural bar- 
riers. The purpose of this provision in the law is to consoli- 
date the small schools with larger ones, thus enabling us to run 
the schools longer and furnish better school facilities. 
Schools under contract for summer terms may be continued, 
but the directors should be urged not to continue schools that 
have not the required population after that time. 
When the present school districts are abolished any money 
left to the credit of a school district should go to the civil district 
in which the child lives—that is to say, the County Superintend- 
ent with the County Trustee should, from the scholastic popu- 
lation as furnished by the district clerks, distribute the school
-P-A-G-E-478
—459— 
money on hand to the credit of the civil districts out of which the 
said school district was heretofore established, in proportion to 
the number of children enumerated from the different civil dis- 
tricts. 
The law provides that the child can attend the school nearest 
to it, whether in its own or another civil district, so that it is im- 
possible to take off from any one sehool any part of the scholas- 
tic population in order to make the number above seventy for any 
school. The manner of apportioning the money where children 
attend school in a district other than their own is fully set out in 
the act, copies of which have been sent you. 
Districts that have been created by special acts of the Legis- 
lature remain as heretofore and the directors remain the same. 
EXAMINATION OF TEACHERS. 
T cannot too strongly impress upon you the necessity for 
great care in the examination and licensing of teachers. Under 
no consideration should an incompetent person be employed to 
teach in the public schools. We cannot hope for better schools 
until we raise the standard required of our teachers. 
Remember that examinations on all the branches required 
to be taught in the schools and upon Theory and Practice of 
Teaching should be thorough, practical and uniform, and that 
only persons possessing ability to teach and of good moral char- 
acter should be granted certificates. You have no-right to grant 
a certificate to a persen who has failed as a teacher or who is of a 
doubtful character. The fact that a person holds a certificate 
from a State Institute does not justify you in issuing him a cer- 
tificate if you are not satisfied as to his moral character. In brief 
you are instructed to license only persons who are in every way 
worthy, capable and thoroughly qualified. 
You are to exempt from examination only persons holding 
diplomas from the Peabody Normal College or certificates from 
the Peabody State Institutes, or such persons as have been in reg- 
ular attendance at the county institutes and have shown by pre- 
vious examination and successful experience, under your obser- 
vation in the school room, that they are worthy of such considera-
-P-A-G-E-479
—460— 
tion, and these cases should be very few. As a rule, I would not 
encourage duplicating certificates and I instruct against this. 
TIMES OF EXAMINATIONS, 
County Superintendents are directed to hold public exam- 
inations at the following times and to give no private examina- 
tions: 
Annual Examination—At close of County Institute. 
Second Examination—-First Friday and Saturday in Aug- 
ust. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in Oc- 
tober. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in Jan- 
uary. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in 
March. 
Fix the time and place for the examination, announce be- 
forehand the number of hours to be consumed daily and then 
follow your announcement. 
Do not permit perscnal consideration, importunities of 
teachers, directors, or influential friends in any way to influence 
you in licensing teachers. All certificates should be made to ex- 
pire at the close of the scholastic year, June 30. 
COUNTY TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
If you have not already done so, you should at once organize 
a County Teachers’ Association and hold regular meetings. All 
teachers should be urged to attend these meetings and their at- 
tendanee and work in such meetings should be taken into consid- 
eration in granting them certificates. This is a good opportunity 
to test their knowledge of theory and practice teaching. 
The new Roll of Honor Certificates provided for the Pea- 
body State Institutes will be good for four years, but they’ are 
not certificates to teach. The holders thereof will be entitled to a 
county certificate from you upon presentation of said Roll of 
Honor Certificate if they are in other respects worthy. The fol- 
lowing clause has been added after the words ‘‘for four years:”’
-P-A-G-E-480
—461— 
“Provided the holder hereof has attended the county association 
and complied with all other regulations made by the County Su- 
perintendent.’’ 
WORK OF INSTITUTES AND ASSOCIATIONS. 
I sineerely hope that this year, in ali of your teachers’ meet- 
ings, you will give attention to the subject of improvement of 
methods in our primary schools. In any successful school sys- 
tem it is very important that the foundation be well laid. Good 
primary teachers are few and our schools need improvement in 
this particular department. 
PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS. _ 
Our law provides for three grades of schools and as we now 
have the civil and school districts coextensive, I urge that where 
practicable not more than one secondary school be established in 
a district, and that children from the entire district be allowed to 
take the secondary branches in this school. The secondary 
school should have not Jess than two teachers. The other schools 
of the district should be primary and graded so that the district 
will have a system of graded schools running through the pri- 
mary and secondary grades just as are found in the cities. 
County High School where established should be at the head 
of the public school system of the county, and pupils should be 
encouraged to attend school until they have finished the second- 
ary and high schools. 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
The University of Tennessee is the head of our public 
school system and you should see that the scholarships in it, as 
provided by law, are all filled. If you have not had applicants 
sufficient, to fill these, urge upon some worthy young men or 
women in your county the necessity of taking advantage of the 
great opportunity offered by this institution. 
EDUCATIONAL MEETINGS. 
As outlined to you at the conference for education held in 
the city of Nashville in April, you are urged to hold educational 
rallies or meetings in every district in your county. Urge the
-P-A-G-E-481
—462— 
people to come together and discuss freely matters pertaining to 
our public school system. Organize your county by having a 
good central committee, and under it district committees, and 
earry on the work of an educational campaign in a systematic 
way. On these committees bring into serviee influential men of 
your county. 
Urge the people to keep their children in school throughout 
the entire term. Create a sentiment in favor of longer terms, bet- 
ter schoolhouses, better facilities, consolidation and grading of 
schools. , 
Wishing you success in your year’s work and assuring you 
that I am ready to covperate and help you in any way, I am 
Very sincerely,

To the County Superintendents: 
Information has been received at this office that certain par- 
ties are canvassing the State selling school libraries, and repre- 
senting that they are working under the instructions or advice of 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
It is also reported that they state that at the conference of 
superintendents held at Nashville in April, steps were taken for 
supplying schools with libraries, and that their books were se- 
lected by a special committee from the Publie School Officers’ 
Association. 
It is further reported that they represent that provision has 
been made by the State for the buying and paying for said li- 
braries. 
All such representations are absolutely false. The State Su- 
perintendent has never endorsed the purchase of said libraries, or 
given any recommendations whatever. 
The conference held in April was simply for the study of 
educational conditions in the State, and no plan was formulated 
for the establishment of libraries in the schools. 
The Public School Officers’ Association has never appointed 
a committee to select books for libraries. 
The State has never made any provision for buying or pay- 
ing for libraries. Very respectfully, 
Srymour A. Mynpers, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

To County Superintendents and Teachers: 
Chapter 172, Acts of 1887, makes it the duty of the County 
Superintendent of each county to set apart some day in No- 
vember of each year as ‘‘ Arbor Day,’’ to be observed by all the 
pubie schools of the county, ‘‘that trees may be planted around 
the buildings’’ and ‘‘that the grounds may be improved and 
beautified.’’ 
The act further provides that the planting be attended with 
appropriate and attractive ceremonies, that the day may be one 
of pleasure as well as of instruction for the young. 
To secure uniformity, I recommend that Friday, November 
20, 1903, be observed by the publie schools of the State of Ten- 
nessee as Arbor Day. 
1 suggest that the teachers of each school arrange a pro- 
gram of music, recitations and addresses and that the patrons 
be urged to attend. 
Please see that your county papers. are interested in this 
matter and that your teachers are urged to observe the day. 
Very truly yours, 
Seymour A. Mynprrs,

NasuviLue, October 20, 1903. 
To County Superintendents: 
The Tennessee Commission for the World’s Fair at St. 
Louis has arranged for an educational exhibit. 
It is hoped that all the counties of the State will be repre- 
sented, and that the work of the schools of Tennessee will sur- 
pass that of any other State. 
I ask that you interest. your teachers in this matter, and be- 
gin at once the preparation of a suitable exhibit for your county. 
The enclosed plan is simply suggestive, and you may make 
such changes as your work may require. 
Very truly yours, 
Seymour A. Mynbers, 
State Superintendent. 
Suggestive Outline for Exhibit of Schools of Tennessee, World's 
Fair, St. Louis, 1904, as Approved by 
Tennessee Commission. 
First—That photos of school buildings, from the rural 
schoclhonse to the latest public school buildings, be exhibited ; 
and that designs of the more recent ones showing modern systems 
of heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation, be obtained, if 
possible, and, if obtained, properly exhibited. That photos of 
school rooms and school yards be exhibited. 
Second—That high schools, colleges and universities be re- 
quested to furnish for exhibition photos and models of apparatus 
and school appliances used in teaching. 
Third—That all authors in this State, of books, original con- 
tributions to human knowledge and monographs on any subject, 
be requested to furnish copies for exhibition.
-P-A-G-E-489
—470— 
Fourth—That the State Superintendent of Public Instrue- 
tion is requested to secure an exhibit from the public schools, pre- 
pared in accordance with the following regulations: 
Exhibit Regulations—Flat exhibits (charts, drawings, pho- 
tos, ete.) should be shown in wall frames or wall cabinets. For 
the latter, the standard dimensions of the card will be 22x28 inch- 
es, the latter dimension being vertical. Photographs for albums 
or wall cabinets should be either 8x10 inches, or 11x14 inches, and 
should be mounted directly on the full-sized cardboard. 
WRITTEN WORK. 
1. Pupil’s work should be written on paper of good quality 
8x10 inches in size, except in the subjects of drawing and botany 
and in these not over 22x28 inches. 
2. At the left of each sheet a margin of 114 inches should 
be left for binding. Three-fourths of an inch margin is recom- 
mended on the other side: Pupils must not write on one side of 
the sheet, care being taken to preserve the binding margin. 
3. In drawing and in mounting botanical specimens the 
standard sizes of paper may be used (not over 22x28}. ‘The 
same margins should be left as noted above. 
: 4. At the top of the first sheet of each pupil’s work should 
be written the name, age and grade of the pupil. 
5. Only regular class work is desired. 
6. Wherever the subject demands, a single set of questions, 
printed or neatly written by the teacher, should precede the an 
swer in each subject. In addition, the pupil shall write each 
question, properly numbered, before the answer. 
7. The written work in each subject should be preceded by a 
“‘Teacher’s Statement’’ blank, earefully filled out. Sample 
blanks will be furnished by the State Superintendent of Publie 
Instruction on application. 
8. The work of cne grade in one subject should be arranged 
for binding by itself. 
9. A photograph of the class or of the school as a frontis- 
piece to each volume would add greatly to its interest.
-P-A-G-E-490
—471— 
TO BE CLASSIFIED. 
Fifth—That the exhibit from the public schools of the State 
shall be made as a whole, classified into grades, except those from 
an incorporated city with many schools, when, by request, such a 
city will be permitted to install its system as a unit. 
Sixth—That all colleges, universities, convents, scientific, 
industrial and engineering schools, professional schools of law, 
medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and commerce, art and music 
schools, libraries and museums, institutions for the blind, deaf 
and dumb and insane, summer schools, chautauquas, teachers’ in- 
stitutes, scientific societies and associations, for both sexes and for 
both races, are requested to prepare and to deliver to the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction suitable exhibits. 
Seventh—The above schools may make such exhibits as they 
deem proper and consistent with the rules of the exposition, but 
the following suggestions are offered as to what are considered 
appropriate exhibits for each of the above schools: 
1. Topographical map of grounds. 
Photos and models of grounds and buildings. 
Charts of course of study and equipment. Boo Graphies showing growth of school or its departments. on Photes of interior of libraries, laboratories, workshops 
and classrooms. 
6. Publications of any of its faculty. 
7. Publications of the school, including catalogues, rules and 
nee programs, ete. 
8. Theses of graduates, typewritten or printed monographs, 
records of special investigation, ete. 
9. Products of the workshops, laboratories, drawingrooms, 
museums, ete. 
10. Specimens of manual and industrial training from pub- 
lie and private schools. 
11, All school exhibits should be prepared and ready for de- 
livery to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, by Jan- 
uary 1, 1904.
-P-A-G-E-491
—472— 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
Private institutions of learning may follow the above sug- 
gestion as to the outline of their exhibits, or adopt any plan they 
may prefer consistent with the rules of the exposition. The State 
Commission will pay the freight, take care of, and return such 
exhibits, but the expense of preparing and installing such ex- 
hibits will be borne by the exhibitor. Private schools that pre- 
fer to employ special custodians for their exhibits may do so, oth- 
erwise the custodians employed by the commission will have 
charge of all the Tennessee exhibits. 
Tennessee is famous for her private schools and a large part 
of their patronage comes from abroad. 
Those having charge of private institutions of learning who 
will make exhibits at St. Louis should notify Hon. B. A. Enloe, 
Secretary and Director of Exhibits, Nashville, Tennessee, at 
once, so that space may be secured for them.

To Members of the County Courts in Tennessee: 
GENTLEMEN—It is with great pleasure that I announce the 
distribution for school purposes of the surplus in the State Treas- 
ury today. : 
On the recommendation of Governor Frazier, the Fifty-third 
General Assembly passed an act giving to the public schools of 
the State the surplus at the end of the year, to be distributed 
-among the several counties according to scholastic population. 
This surplus remains after paying 10 per cent of the gross rev- 
enues of the State on the State debt and all current obligations. 
It represents largely the economical administration of the various 
departments of the State government, which has kept constantly
-P-A-G-E-494
—475— 
in view the necessity of as large a fund as possible for the schools 
of the State. 
T have been officially notified by Mr. Theo. King, Comptroller 
of the Treasury, that the amount to be distributed is $271,000, 
or 35 cents per capita. Multiplying the scholastic population 
of your county by 35 cents will give the amount that you will 
receive. A warrant for this will be sent to your Trustee within 
a few days. 
The great needs of the publie schools in Tennessee are a 
longer average term and more efficient instruction in the pri- 
mary schools. To supply these needs will require more money. 
As this help from the State comes without any inerease of taxa- 
tion, I urge upon your honorable body to meet it by increasing 
your county appropriation for school purposes. -No county in 
the State should have an annual term of less than six months, 
and the stronger counties should provide for at least eight 
months. Demand of your school directors that the money re- 
ceived from both State and county be used to inerease the school 
term and provide competent teachers. Throw around the school 
fund every possible protection against extravagance and useless 
expenditure. 
Assuring you of my readiness to cooperate with you in 
every possible way for the improvement of the schools in your 
county, I am . 
Very truly yours, 
Seymour A. MyNpgErs, 
State Superintendent.

A motion was made and carried to limit each speaker in the 
discussion of a subject to three minutes.

in order to close entire program in the afternoon. 
The report of 8. G. Gilbreath, Chairman of the Executive 
Committee, was read and adopted. It showed the association to 
be in fine condition financially—the best since the organization— 
and the committee was commended for its splendid work. 
REPORT OF AUDITING COMMITTEE. 
The financial report of the Secretary and Treasurer, Hon. 
8. A. Mynders, has been audited by the Executive Committee and 
found correct. His statement of receipts and expenditures is 
filed herewith, and made a part of this report. 
The balance on hand at last report, as shown by Executive 
Committee of that year, was $83, while our report shows for the 
same time a balance of only $13.68. This difference was due to 
the including in receipts by the Executive Committee last year of 
the membership fee of the 1902 meeting, which showld not have 
been so included, and which, in the report, were approximated. 
Your committee this year with the Secretary and Treasurer, 
beginning with a balance on hand of $13.68, has paid all old 
debts contracted prior to the meeting last year, has printed, pub- 
lished and paid for the Proceedings of the 1892 meeting, has paid 
all new obligations up to this date, and reports a balance in the 
treasury of $1.64, no debts, and the receipts of the present meet- 
ing untouched. This will give the new Executive Committee am- 
ple funds for the publication of the Proceedings of this meeting 
and the payments of obligations entered into by them.

SIXTEENTH ANNUAL SESSION OF THE PUBLIC 
SCHOOL OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The sixteenth annual session was called to order in the audi- 
torium of the Tulane Hotel at 2 o’clock Tuesday afternoon, Janu- 
ary 20, with the following officers present : 
R. L. Bynum, President; A. J. Brandon, Vice President; 
Frank Goodman, Secretary and Treasurer; P. L. Harned, Assist- 
ant Seeretary; Clande J. Bell, Sam E. Hill, A. R. Thomas, and 
W. F. Albright, members of the Executive Committee. 
Dr. J. O. Rust of Nashville opened the meeting with prayer. 
On account of the inaugural exercises, the Governor was un- 
able to be present to deliver the address of welcome, but he was 
ably represented by Dr. J. O. Rust, who gave the members of the 
association a most hearty welcome. 
Superintendent Seymour A. Mynders, in a very appropriate 
way, responded to the address of welcome. 
President R. L. Bynum read the annual address of the Pres- 
ident, which was referred to the following committee: P. P. Clax- 
ton, W. BR. Garrett and Homer L. Higgs. 
The important features of the President’s address are given 
in the following recommendations: 
1. The present uniform text-book law should be made per- 
manent, but cities having separate school systems should be ex- 
empt from its operation. ‘The State depositories should be abol- 
ished and publishers should be required to deal directly with the 
local dealers. The Governor should not be a member of either of 
the text-book committees. 
2. The State Superintendent should be a teacher and not a 
politician. He should be paid a salary of not less than $2,500 a 
year. 
3. The State tax levy for publie school purposes should be 
increased to 25 cents, and the rural schools should be made as 
good as city schools. :
-P-A-G-E-515
—496— 
4. County Superintendents should be paid better salaries 
than at present, and should have the same power in the county 
that the City Superintendents have in the city. 
5. The eivil district and the school district should be made 
coextensive and the schools should be consolidated where pessi- 
ble. : 
6. Every county showld have one or more county high 
schools with a manual training department. 
7. Negro children should be educated for work. Some form 
of manual or industrial training should be made a part of the 
course of study in every negro school. 
8. The State should have a compulsory attendance law. 
9, Music should be required in the public schools, and pro- 
visions should be made for kindergarten in the publie schools of 
the cities and towns. 
10. The State should support liberally the institutions of 
higher léarning. The Legislature should continue to contribute 
$20,00¢ a year to the University of Nashville, and a liberal ap- 
propriation should be made to the University of Tennessee. 
11. The Summer School of the South was heartily com- 
mended. : 
Messrs. W. R. Garrett, T. C. Gordon and H. L. Higgs were 
appointed members of the Memorial Committee. 
Upon motion of Mr. Jester the regular afternoon program 
was begun. The Assistant Secretary called the roll by counties 
and the Superintendents responded in the usual five-minute re- 
ports of the conditions of the public schools in their respective 
counties. 
Just before the close of the session of the afternoon Senator 
Jere Baxter and Representatives Hunt of Dickson and Romine 
were introduced and made short addresses in the interest of rural 
schools. 
Vacancies on the committees were filled and the association 
adjourned for the day to give the various committees time to 
prepare their reports.

WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 21. 
At 9 o’clock the association was called to order by President 
Bynum and the exercises begun with prayer by Superintendent 
M. R. M. Burke. 
Upon motion of Superintendent A. R. Thomas the roll call 
by counties was deferred and the program of the day was taken 
up. 
Superintendent J. B. Cummings introduced the following 
resolution, which was unanimously adopted: 
Wuereas, Our new Governor has just appointed our worthy 
ecolaborer, Superintendent S. A. Mynders, State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction; therefore 
Resolved, That we, the members of the State Publie School 
Officers’ Association, heartily endorse the appointment and con- 
gratulate Superintendent Mynders and pledge him our hearty 
support in all his efforts to improve the publie schools. 
President Bynum appointed Messrs. J. B. Cummings, H. L. 
Higgs, and C. B. Ijams to inform the Governor and the newly ap- 
pointed State Superintendent of the action of the association. 
Messrs. W. H. Cook, C. P. Jester, W. F. Albright, R. L. 
Jones, and O. C. Barton were appointed a Committee on Reso- 
. lutions. 
The new State Superintendent was introduced and thanked 
the association for the hearty endorsement and pledge of coopera- 
tion, and promised to give his undivided attention to the improve- 
ment of the public schools of the State. 
Hon. Ed. T. Seay, Speaker of the Senate, was introduced and 
expressed a desire to do all in hig power to have enacted any law 
that would improve the school system. 
State Superintendent Morgan C. Fitzpatrick spoke of the 
work done during his administration in all the departments of 
his official province. He very earnestly indorsed the appointment 
of his suceessor, and commended him to the association as a man 
in every way capable of a successful administration. _ 
Dr. D. C. Kelly was introduced and made an earnest ap- 
‘peal for improvement of the rural schools.

Judge Allison was also introduced to the association and re- 
viewed the work of the schools. 
The subject, ‘‘Should the country. school district contain 
a minimum number of educable school children?’’ was discussed 
at length and the following recommendations of the committee 
were concurred in: 
1. That school districts be made ecoterminus with civil dis- 
tricts when practicable, provided that no district shall contain 
less than twenty square miles, except in case of physical barriers, 
impassable rivers, swamps, mountains, ete. 
2. That if this body should adopt the county system, having a 
County Board of Directors, we would recommend that the board 
be restricted as above provided in the location and the establish- 
ment of schools of the county.

Superintendent J. B. Cummings read the report of the com- 
mittee on, ‘‘Is it necessary that teachers make prompt reports to 
directors, directors to County Superintendents, and County Su- 
perintendents to State Superintendents, and is legislation needed 
on this subject?’’ The committee stated: That if our education- 
al statistics are to become more reliable and useful there must, in 
some way, be instruction given to both teachers and clerks, and 
we most respectfully suggest that the County Superintendents 
be urged to do this work. The teacher can be instructed at the 
annual institute, and the director at the directors’ meetings, and 
especially can he instruct both on his visits to his schools. We be- 
lieve if the Superintendents would vigorously pursue this course, 
that in two years there would be an increase of fifty per cent in 
the quality of the facts gathered, and in consequence a like value 
in the conclusions drawn from them. 
As to legislation needed we recommend three things: 
1. That the annual report of the general conditions of the 
schools be required of directors as well as the scholastic popula-
-P-A-G-E-518
—499— 
tion report before a warrant is given for taking the scholastic 
population and in addition to the two cents per capita that fifty 
cents be added for this report. 
2. That it be made an imperative duty of the County Super- 
intendent to examine the registers and records of the teachers as 
he visits the schools; and that he also visit the clerk of each dis- 
trict and examine his books and records and give such instruction 
in keeping them as may be necessary. 
3. Any and all legislation that will tend to require the en- 
tire time of the County Superintendent upon the duties of his 
office and any and all legislation that will force a better qualifi- 
cation of the teacher. .

The report, ‘‘How can the County Superintendent improve 
the efficiency of the teachers under his charge?’’ was read by Miss 
Maude Moore, Superintendent of Shelby County, and adopted as 
read. 
1. The County Superintendent can improve the efficiency of 
the teachers under his charge by having a flexible course of 
study outlined by the State Board of Education with suggestions 
for its adoption to small and large schools, published by the State 
and required to be used in summer institutes. 
2. By requiring of every teacher a thorough study of some 
subjects included in the school course, each year, and laying spe- 
cial stress on that subject in the annual examination. 
3. By requiring a definite minimum amount of professional 
reading, each year, and examining on it. 
4. By having power to relieve teachers from examinations 
after certificates are once issued on condition that they do this re- 
quired professional reading. 
5. By visiting the schools of his county, giving to each not
-P-A-G-E-519

less than one day, and teaching classes in the presence of the 
teacher.

Messrs. W. C. Lawson, C. B. Ijams, F. K. Henderson, W. H. 
Fuqua, and C. T. Townsend submitted their report on ‘‘Should 
County Superintendents be guaranteed a fair compensation for 
their work by law, and be required to devote their entire time to 
the duties of the office,’’ which was, adopted. 
“We, your committee, beg leave to report that inasmuch as 
County Superintendents are required to stand an examination 
which would bring them not less than $50 a month, ten months 
in the year, in States demanding such qualifications, and as the 
county schools should have competent supervision, and should 
pay for the same, we believe no Superintendent in Tennessee 
should be paid less than $500 a year. Having thus secured com- 
petent supervision and paid for the same, we believe the time of 
the Superintendent, which will be thus under contract in consid- 
eration of the salary, should be given to schools and school in- 
terests.’’ 
Upon motion of Supt. S. A. Mynders, subjects 10 and 11 
were made a special order for 7:30 p. m. The association ad- 
journed until that hour. 
At 10 o’elock p. m. about eighty members of the association 
with invited guests assembled in the dining room of the Tulane 
Hotel to take part in the annual banquet. Prof. Wharton 
Jones of Memphis was toastmaster and the following gentlemen 
responded to their respective toasts: Judge Allison, ex-Governor

On account of a committee of the House of Representatives 
having to use the auditorium of the hotel there was no place for 
the association to meet at 7:30 Wednesday evening. 
Supt. Sam E Hill read the report of the committee 
on ‘‘Should the County Superintendent have a voice in the selec- 
tion of teachers for every school in the county, and should county 
supervision be made as rigid and effective as city supervision ?’’ 
which was adopted and referred to the Committee on Resolutions. 
Supt. 8. A. Mynders, Chairman of Committee No. 4, stat- 
ed that the report of his committee was covered by the re- 
port of the Committee on Rural Schools, and asked that that sub- 
ject be passed informally. . 
The report of the committee on ‘‘Should there be a uniform 
time for opening the public schools throughout the State, and for 
the close of them in each county?’’ was tabled. 
Dr. W. R. Garrett made a verbal report on the President’s 
address, which was adopted. 
The association adopted a motion to complete the work of the 
annual session at 1 o’clock p. m., all persons on the program to be 
notified of the action of the association. 
Supt. P. L. Harned, Chairman of the Committee on Prac- 
tical Plans for the Improvement of the Rural Schools, made 
the following report, which was adopted: The committee 
stated that there should be a more economical way of expending 
the public school funds; there should be fewer school districts 
and fewer schools; there should be fewer school directors; more 
funds should be provided for the public schools and a larger 
amount should be provided by the State as a whole; the course 
of study should be made more practical, and there should be 
manual and industrial training ; better provisions should be made 
for the training of teachers, and the law should require parents 
to send their children to school. 
We recommend that instead of the district school boards 
there be a county board of education composed of one member 
from each civil district of the county and the County Superin- 
tendent, who shall be Chairman of the County Board of Educa- 
tion. That this board have all authority now exercised by district 
directors. The County Superintendent should draw all war-   
     
-P-A-G-E-521
— 502 — 
rants and should make itemized reports to the County Court 
quarterly, which reports should be audited by the regular aud- 
itors of that body. Sites for school houses should be selected 
without regard to civil district lines, and all the schools of a 
county ‘should run the same number of days.

A. R. THomas,

Prof. P. P. Claxton offered the following resolution, which 
was unanimously adopted: 
“The University of Tennessee being recognized by law as a 
part of the system of public education of the State, and it being 
a well established policy of our American democracy to foster 
higher education as well as the more elementary education of the 
common schools, the public good requiring it; therefore he it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this body that the State 
should support liberally and generously the University of Ten- 
nessee, and that the General Assembly of the State should ap- 
propriate to its use annually a sum not less than $20,000 in ad- 
dition to the State’s portion of the national land grant funds 
which this university now reeeives.’’ 
The report of the Committee on Resolutions summarized the 
recommendations of the association and it was adopted. 
The following resolution was unanimously adopted : 
“Resolved, That we indorse the administration of State Su- 
perintendent Morgan C. Fitzpatrick as wise, practical and pro-

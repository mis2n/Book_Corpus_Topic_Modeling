A garden is a lovesome thing, God wot!

Fringed pool,

Of peace; and yet the fool 
Contends that God is not— 
Not God! in-gardens! when the eve is cool? 
Nay, but I have a sign;

   PREFACE 
        The country around Nashville has always impressed me with its 
. beauty. For more than a century the people of this section have 
been home-makers and home-lovers, with an appreciation of the free 
life of the country inherited from their Anglo-Saxon forefathers. 
        
    It has been said that sentiment underlies everything that is last- 
‘ing and worth while. It is the soul of patriotism, the bond of the 
home, and the foundation of all social and religious customs.          
    The people of the old South were full of sentiment and imagi- 
nation and I have compiled this book with a loving hand, hoping to 
catch an afterglow of that life which made these homes a region of 
romance and of dreams.

  “THE HERMITAGE,” HOME OF GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON, WHO_WAS SEVENTH PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, 1829-1837
-P-A-G-E-10
  Aaron Burr Made his Famous Visit to the Hermitage in 1805, 
and was Entertained in this Log House 
“The Hermitage” 
- | NHE Hermitage, the home of Andrew Jackson, is situated 
on the Lebanon Pike, about twelve miles from Nashville. 
The original Hermitage was built in 1804. It was 
made of logs and part of it is still standing. Jackson was living 
“Before me rose an avenue Oca ete eee rouse, eto ae The Back Gallery, Looking Of tall and sombrous pines.” he returned to this humble home the conquering hero and idol Eats the Gander 
of the nation. The present site was selected in 1819, and the 
house was built of brick made on the place. LaFayette was entertained at the Hermitage in 1825. 
Mrs. Rachel Jackson, wife of General Jackson, died in 1828, just after he was elected President, and on the eve of his departure 
for Washington for the inauguration. 
The adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jr., was married in 1831 to Miss Sarah Yorke, of Philadelphia. All of their children were 
born at the Hermitage, and the family were the solace and comfort of General Jackson’s declining years. The daughter, Rachel, mar- 
tied Dr. John M. Lawrence. She is still living and tells many interesting incidents of the home life at the Hermitage and in Wash- 
ington City. 
General Jackson died in 1845, at the age of seventy-eight years, and was buried by the side of his wife in the tomb in the garden. 
The Hermitage farm of five hundred acres was sold by Andrew Jackson, Jr., in 1856, to the State of Tennessee, for the sum of 
$48,000. The family remained at the Hermitage during the Civil War. General Thomas, commandant of the post at Nashville, 
sent out a detailed guard to protect the place, and thus saved it from devastation. Andrew Jackson, Jr., died in 1865, leaving his 
widow, and her widowed sister, Mrs. Marian Adams, the sole occupants of the Hermitage. The sons of Andrew and Sarah Jackson 
and also of Mrs. Adams, five in number, joined the Confederate service. Only one, Colonel Andrew Jackson, returned. 
The State Legislature allowed Mrs. Sarah Jackson to remain tenant at will during her lifetime. She died in 1888 and was 
buried in the garden.

  The Four-horse Coach used by Jackson at the White House for 
all State and Social Purposes, and for Several Trips 
to the Hermitage, which Trip took 30 Days. 
  “Still stands the forest primeval.” 
The Hermitage is built in Old Colonial style of architecture. 
There is a wide hall, with double rooms on each side, and wings 
supplementing these. Entering the hall, one notes at first glance 
the pictorial wall paper, which represents the story of Telemacus 
in search of Ulysses, his father, and is that part of the story which 
tells of his landing on the Island of Calypso. 
The house is full of interesting relics. General Jackson’s bed- 
room is as it was the day he died. One is also shown the room 
occupied by LaFayette and that of Colonel Earle, who spent many 
years at the Hermitage. He painted a number of portraits of 
Jackson, and assisted in laying out the beautiful garden and the 
interesting grove of cedars which are placed in the form of a guitar, 
Nothing so well indicates the character, manliness and chivalry 
of Jackson as the epitaph which he wrote for his wife’s tomb. It 
is as follows:    “Still bloom the flowers 
With their old-time sweetness.”
-P-A-G-E-12
“Here lie the remains of Mrs. Rachel Jackson, wije of President Jackson, who died the 22d of December, 1828, aged 61 years. 
Her face was fair, her person pleasing, her temper amiable, her heart kind; she delighted in relieving the wants of her fellow creatures, 
and cultivated that divine pleasure by the most liberal and unpretending methods; to the poor she was a benefactor; to the rich an example; 
to the wretched a comforter; to the prosperous an ornament; her piety went hand in hand with her benevolence, and she thanked her Cre- 
ator for being permitted to do good. A being so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound, but could not dishonor; even Death, when 
he bore her from the arms of her husband, could but transport her to the bosom of her God.” 
The people of Nashville and of 
Tennessee owe a debt of gratitude to 
the Ladies’ Hermitage Association, a 
band of noble women, whose zealous 
efforts have preserved and restored 
this historic home. President Roose- 
velt, while occupying the White House 
in 1907, made a visit to Nashville for 
  The Grave of Andrew Jackson and of Rachel 
Deep in the shadow of the friendly trees, 
In that eld garden of the Hermitage, 
All color-crammed, like some rare-pictured page 
Whose quaint old patterns still essay to please; 
Where valley lilies in the Southern breeze 
Hang their pale bells against the scarlet sage, 
Deep-scarred and war-worn, ends his pilgrimage, 
Among the lily bells and wandering bees.    
His troubled heart, fierce with the world’s unrest, 
No longer throbs wild beating to the tread 
Of bugle-summoned, fear-defying horde; 
But dust to dust, and still dead breast to breast, 
Bravely content beside his gentle dead, 
The warrior to the lover yields his sword. 
—W.A.D the special purpose of inspecting the 
Hermitage. His subsequent act in 
recommending it to Congress as a 
subject deserving of National sup- 
port and assistance, illustrates the 
fine qualities of the man, and his 
teady perception of the worthy thing 
to be done.

“CLOVER BOTTOM”
-P-A-G-E-14
  “Clover Bottom” 
farm, situated seven miles from Nashville on the Lebanon Road. This farm was purchased by Hon. Andrew Price in the 
early eighties, and consists of over fifteen hundred acres of fertile rolling uplands, rich fields, green, shady woods and velvety 
sward that stretches on both sides of the road, a delight. to the passerby. 
To quote from one of Tennessee’s distinguished writers, John Trotwood Moore, in a recent magazine article, “I struck real 
history first, some seven or eight miles out, at beautiful ‘Clover Bottom,’ on the picturesque Stones River. It is worth a. visit 
of miles to see this splendid estate, with the fine old mansion sitting back among the trees of maple and oak, its lawn of sweet 
grass, billowy with bunches of smutty faced, pure-bred Southdowns, its paddocks dignified by the blooded matrons of bluest blood, 
its distant fields shimmering in new coming wheat or drowsy and dreaming meadows. ‘Clover Bottom’ is now the property of 
Hon. Andrew Price, a large sugar planter of Thibodeaux, Louisiana, who spends part of his time here; a gentleman of the old school, 
and a fond lover of trotters, he has left nothing undone to make the place typical of his love of land and the things that grow thereon.” 
The spacious, dignified, colonial house was built in 1858 by the former owner, Dr. James Hoggatt, and, while it has been mod- 
ernized and beautified, the original lines and plans remain unaltered. 
In the halls are the old time pictured papers, representing scenes from the Revolutionary War, and an English Deer Chase. 
Mr. Price was a thorough student of pedigree and a rare judge of individual merit in the American trotting horse, and the trotting 
stud at “Clover Bottom” was carried on as a means of recreation and pleasure. In the blue grass paddocks grazed royally bred 
mares, such as Clover-Belle, Summer Morn, Lydia Wilkes, Effie Hill, Lady Washington, and dozens of others equally well bred, with 
Egotist by the great Electioneer, and Lord Curzon by Prince of India as the premier stallions. 
Lying in a bend of Stones River is a beautiful level tract, once owned by Andrew Jackson, known as “Clover Bottom.” It is A MONG the many splendid country estates around Nashville, none is more historical or more beautiful than “Clover Bottom’”’

  “Bare, ruined choirs, where once the sweet birds sang.” 
from this bottom that the farm takes its name, and it was here that the old “Clover Bottom Course” was located, upon which taced 
the horses of General Andrew Jackson and the prominent gentlemen of his day. 
On the rise of the hill west of the race track is an old foundation of the store owned by Jackson and kept by Coffee, the firm 
being Jackson & Coffee. At The Hermitage is shown, among other relics, old account books of the Clover Bottom Store, 1804 and 
1806. History relates that the early settlers of Nashville drifted down the Cumberland River into Stones River and planted corn 
in this bottom in 1780, and while harvesting their crops were attacked by the Indians and many of them massacred. 
The old Blue Brick, one of the houses on Clover Bottom Farm, is said to be one of the oldest two-story brick houses in Davidson 
County, outside of Nashville, and it was there that Jackson was said to have recruited his troops when going to New Orleans.

Gayly shalt play and glitter here.”

hundred acres of beautiful and fertile land, and it takes its name from the fact that it lies at the junction of the Stones River 
with the Cumberland. This place was originally owned in 1819 by Mr. William Harding, the uncle of General William G. 
Harding of Belle Meade, and the father of Mrs. David McGavock, whose son is the present owner. 
The residence was erected by Mr. David McGavock in 1859, and it is one of the best built homes in Davidson County. Mr. 
McGavock was his own architect and builder, cutting with his own mill all the timber from trees on the place. All the brick 
were made and the stone quarried by his slaves. An evidence of the thoroughness and skill of the work is that to-day there 
is not a seam, crack, or the slightest sign of decay in any part of the building. The large halls, galleries, and spacious rooms 
indicate the liberal and permanent scale of the construction. The names of Mr. and Mrs. David McGavock and their only son and 
heir are cut and burned in the brick which are laid in the wall near the side entrance. 
On this estate, on the bluffs of the river, Dr. Priestley built and taught one of the first girls’ schools in this section of the 
country. The foundation stones still remain, and the spring bearing the name of Priestley Spring is still used by Mr. McGavock. 
Dr. Priestley was President from 1809 to 1816 of Cumberland University, which afterwards became the University of Nashville.

6c Be AIR,” the old Nichol home, was originally a part of the very large tract of land which was granted to John Harding 
It was given to his daughter, Betty, upon her marriage to Joseph W. Clay, of Kentucky. The gift contained one thousand 
acres of land. Mr. Clay built the original house, which was greatly added to and improved by Mr. William Nichol, who pur- 
chased the place in 1839. The thousand acres of this now valuable land was bought at ten dollars an acre. The Nichol family 
lived there for nearly half a century, and the house became the center of a very charming social life. In 1882, after Mr. Nichol’s 
death, the house and two hundred and fifty-seven acres were purchased by Mr. A. E. Burr, who unfortunately destroyed the beau- 
tiful flower garden. This garden was one of the most famous in this section of the country, and in ante-bellum days, from its 
lovely roses, was made rosewater that furnished all the bed rooms. The remainder of the place was divided between Mr. Edgar 
Nichol and Mr. H. D. Nichol. The place has since changed hands several times. It was for a number of years owned by Mr. T. P. 
Ayers, who recently sold it to Mr. R. A. Coleman.

kK freesboro Pike. It came into the hands of the family of the present owner about the year 1831, when Thomas S. King, 
Esquire, grandfather of Mrs. Joseph E. Harris, took up his residence on the place, which at the time of his death, comprised 
about five hundred acres. He erected the present dwelling house and occupied it until his death in 1851. Upon the death of his 
widow, the part which had constituted her dower, the mansion being included, was purchased by Mr. Dempsey Weaver, who had 
married her daughter, Frances L. King. The house was remodeled by him about 1860. In the year 1889, upon a division of the 
estate of Mr. Weaver, his daughter, Mrs. Joseph E. Harris, inherited the home and a small acreage immediately about it—some 
fifty acres—and at her death in rgro, it passed to her children.

  ‘DUN ATLIE”
-P-A-G-E-30
“Dun Ailie” 
r i NHIS beautiful country place, the home of Mr. and Mrs. L. R. Campbell, on the 
Murfreesboro Road, was formerly owned by Mrs. Campbell’s mother, and the Gaelic 
name, meaning “‘Ellen’s Hill,’’ is appropriate to the Scotch ancestry of the family. 
“Dun Ailie” is situated on a wooded hill rising a hundred feet above the Murfreesboro 
Road and commanding a magnificent view of the Overton and Brentwood hills. The 
lawn in front of this home contains one of the finest groves of oaks and poplars—giant 
survivors of the “forest primeval’’—to be seen in the State. There are a number of large 
and free springs, and the water has fine medicinal properties. 
There is an Indian spring on the place, which is the only reminder of the Indian village 
which gave it its name. 
That part of the drive which is seen in front of the house was once the old stage road 
leading to Murfreesboro, and on the site of the present residence was the old “Sangster 
Tavern,’ where, in pioneer days, travelers stopped for rest and refreshment. 
In 1857 Obadiah Hurt built the house which is now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Campbell. 
Not long afterwards it passed into the hands of Mr. James, a banker of Nashville. 
During the war the house 
was occupied by Federal 
soldiers. After one or two 
changes of ownership, the 
place passed into the hands 
of Dr. W. P. Jones, former Superintendent of the Central Tennessee 
Insane Asylum, and afterwards Postmaster in Nashville, who occu- 
pied it as his home for many years. 
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Wheeler, the latter Dr. Jones’ daughter, 
made their home here for several years, and shortly after they 
moved to the city the place was bought by Mrs. Ellen C. Marshall, 
who made extensive additions. 
Mrs. Marshall lived at ‘‘Dun Ailie’’ until 1904, when she sold it 
to Mr. F. M. Ewing. By him it was sold to Senator J. B. Frazier, 
who owned the place less than one year, and by him it was sold to 
Mr. Campbell.

“ALAMO”
-P-A-G-E-32
  “Alamo” 
, i \HE home of Mr. and Mrs. John M. Gaut is located on the 
Murfreesboro Pike. It takes its name from the fact that 
around it are a number of poplar trees, Alamo being the 
Spanish name for poplar or tulip tree. 
The house is located on land granted by the State of North 
Carolina in 1793, at the price of fifty cents per acre (ten pounds 
per one hundred acres), to Thomas Hardiman. Hardiman con- 
veyed 510 acres of the land to Robert C. Foster in 1802, and it 
had remained in the Foster family for seventy-eight years, when 
it was purchased by Mr. Gaut. A large body of Federal soldiers 
encamped upon the land during the Civil War. There is a fine 
spring in the foregrounds, about 150 feet from the Murfreesboro 
Road. In the level space intervening between the spring and 
the road, there stood, many years ago, a rude “still house,”’ where whiskey and brandy were manufactured. On the exact spot 
where this distillery was located there is now a circular basin of 
beautiful water, in the middle of which is a fountain. The 
spring being higher than the basin, the water, by its natural 
gravity, spouts up in the fountain to a height of eight feet. 
On the margin of the turnpike road there is a stone drinking 
fountain and a stone watering trough, both supplied with pure, 
cold water from the spring, for the accommodation of the public 
man and beast. The hundreds of travellers who daily drink at 
this fountain should know that for this blessing they are indebted 
to the benevolent spirit of Mrs. Gaut. 
Surrounding the dwelling is a large number of trees, most of

and planted with artistic arrangement by Mr. and Mrs. Gaut. 
It is a unique fact that two of the bed-chambers in the house 
are finished in wood—one of them in sugar maple and the other 
in black walnut—which grew on the place.

HE home of Mr. and Mrs. D. Shelby Williams is located 
about four miles out on the Murfreesboro Road. 
The residence was built by Major Goff in 1852. The 
brick were burned on the place and most of the construction work 
was performed by the owner’s negro slaves. The farm now em= 
braces nearly eight hundred acres of land, with.a strong flowing 
creek running through it for more than a mile and a half, and in 
addition to this, water is supplied by numbers of sparkling springs 
that never go dry. 
The entire farm is in pasture and grazing land and is devoted 
to the raising and development of Jersey cattle. It contains a 
high-class dairy, which is equipped with all modern methods and 
facilities for producing sanitary milk and cream.

Tennessee. In 1855 it was purchased by the late Hon. 
Andrew Ewing, who lived there until Nashville was taken by the 
Federal forces. Messrs. Foster and Ewing were party leaders, and 
this house was the scene of many important and interesting gath- 
erings. The spacious lawn was then adorned with oaks and elms 
of rare beauty, but these were cut away by the soldiers camped 
there. The place is now owned and occupied by Captain John W. 
Morton, Chief of Artillery under General N. B. Forrest in the Civil 
War, and afterwards Secretary of State.

  “Woody Crest” 
OR ages it has been a maxim among the Brahmins, that to ‘‘whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belongs the fruit 
of it.” In the year 1784, Captain John Rains, one of the first and most active of the Cumberland settlers, caused to be sur- 
veyed a tract of 640 acres of land on the waters of Brown’s Creek. In 1786, the State of North Carolina issued to him grant 
   “There is a quiet spirit in these woods 
That dwells where’er the gentle south wind blows.’
-P-A-G-E-43
No. 96 for the land, “‘with all woods, waters, mines, minerals, hereditaments and appurtenances belonging.’’ From that good year 
there has not been a day that some of his descendants have not lived upon the land, and his tribe has increased to hundreds; but 
no part of it has been so well and beautifully kept as ‘‘Woody Crest,’’ whose bosky verdures still delight the eye, and this notwith- 
standing the residence was the center of one of the fiercest conflicts that was fought around Nashville during the war between the 
States from ’61 to ’65, the residence having been used by General Wood, (who commanded the Federal forces), as headquarters, and 
which on this account became the target for the Confederate batteries. The walls of the older parts of the building still show marks 
of the bombardment through which it passed during that unhappy struggle. 
It has been truthfully said that “One generation cometh and another goeth, but the earth abideth forever,” and after passing 
through the fiery ordeal of war, ‘‘Woody Crest’’ has come down to this day more attractive and beautiful than ever before. There 
is no sentiment more deep-rooted in the human heart than the love of home. And it is well that it is so; for upon it is founded 
patriotism, philanthropy, and our civilization itself. It is this love that inspires us to improve and beautify the land, whether it be 
the mere shack upon the broad prairie, or the palatial residence upon the older and more cultivated parts of the country. Among 
the latter, ‘Woody Crest’’ stands as a conspicuous example. 
This home, the property of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Robinson, which is naturally one of the most beautiful in the State, has been sup- 
plemented by whatever the most artistic taste could suggest. Since 1784, it has not been out of the Rains family, and still affords 
not only the most gracious hospitality to the stranger, but shelters and comforts the heirs of that hardy old pioneer even to his 
children’s children’s children’s children.—M. W.

  “To muse and brood and live again in memory” 
“Travellers Rest” 
CC’ i \RAVELLERS REST” gained its name, which it has worthily borne for over ninety years, from the fact of the many guests 
it has entertained. John Overton, afterward Justice of the Supreme Court, came from Virginia in 1793 and built a two-room 
log house on the site of the present building. He was one of the first lawyers to practice in this section of the country, 
and the little brick office.in the yard was also the first law school. Here many of the pioneer lawyers were educated, making their 
home meanwhile with Judge Overton in the house which had been enlarged to meet the growing needs of his hospitality. 
In 1820, being then well advanced in years, he married Mrs. Mary White May, the widow of Dr: Francis May. Soon after 
their marriage the house was enlarged to practically its present proportions. 
Judge Overton and General Andrew Jackson were warm personal and political friends and the correspondence between them 
during the period of Jackson’s presidency and until the former’s death was voluminous and intimate. Judge Overton’s only son, 
Colonel John Overton, inherited the place. He married first, Miss Rachel. Harding, who lived only a few years, leaving one son, the 
late John Overton of Memphis. His second wife was Miss Harriet Maxwell, a girl of eighteen when she came as a bride to “Travellers 
Rest.’’ It was during their long life there together, of over forty years, that the hospitality of the place reached its zenith. 
During the four troubled years of the Civil War, the house was never closed, and although. situated almost on the battle field, it 
escaped practically uninjured. 
In the winter of 1864, when Hood made his remarkable march into Tennessee, the present sitting room at ‘‘Travellers Rest’’ was 
his headquarters for a few days. Mrs. Overton was often heard to say that the proudest day of her life was during a cold, bleak 
day in December when seven Confederate Generals sat at her dining table.
-P-A-G-E-47
Through the long, anxious years of reconstruction and the natural troubles of readjustment, after the upheaval of social conditions, 
Colonel and Mrs. Overton’s home circle continued unbroken and the house became the center of an ever widening circle of friends 
and relatives. They lived to see all of their six children married, and, with one exception, living in the immediate vicinity of the 
old home place. Since their deaths, which occurred within a few weeks of each other, the house is owned and occupied by their 
eldest son, May Overton, under whose loving care many improvements have been made, but the house itself has been kept unchanged 
in its unpretentious, home-like exterior. 
This sketch should not end without mentioning Mrs. Overton’s old-fashioned garden which stood, in a way, as the mother 
garden of all those in the neighborhood. Whenever a new home was. started she felt it her greatest pleasure to make the first 
donation to the garden, and many of her friends have some beautiful reminder of her in the living presence of a rose, a jasmine 
or a clump of snowy phlox.

Tudor style of architecture for manor houses, andéstands in the midst of a large park, thickly. wooded 
with giant forest trees. There have been effectively planted many varieties of evergreens and flowering 
shrubs in groups and borders. These, with the closely clipped hedges which surround the formal garden and- 
greenhouses, carry out the idea and appearance of its English architecture and planting. The land on which 
Overton Hall stands was granted by the United States government to Jesse Maxwell, the great grandfather of 
its present owner, for services in the Revolutionary War.

only from 1857, but it occupies the site of the one built prior to 1823, by John 
Thompson, a son of Thomas Thompson, who was born in 1793 in a*block house on 
the part of the property now owned by Joseph H. Thompson. , | \HE present house at “Glen Leven,” the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Thompson, dates 
  The elder John Thompson was married four times and it was after his last marriage 
that he decided to build a larger house in the same yard with the one he had occupied 
for more than thirty years. It was completed, and the night before the furniture was to be moved in from the old house to the 
new, both caught fire and were burned to the ground. Then the present house was built. 
When the Civil War came on, Mr. Thompson was quite an old man, nearly seventy, and his sons were too young to be any pro- 
tection, so the place suffered a great deal from vandalism after the occupation of Nashville by the Federals in 1862. The day of the 
battle of Nashville, Mrs. Thompson sent word to one of the surgeons that she had prepared several rooms for the reception of the 
wounded, and that she would be glad to have them brought there. Her invitation was accepted, and the large square piano was 
wheeled out on the back porch, and Mrs. Thompson assisted at the amputations, which, needless to say, took place without anes- 
thetics. Mrs. Thompson rarely spoke of her war sufferings, of which she bore her white hair as a token, although she was at the 
time little over forty. 
Mr. Thompson’s death, at the age of eighty-three, removed one of the last links with pioneer days. He passed his long and 
useful life on the same tract of land which his father had taken up as a homestead from North Carolina, in 1782. He had seen

“Brightwood” 
N 1782, North Carolina granted to Thomas Thompson 
I 640 acres of land, which he, in turn, gave to his son, 
John Thompson. Five hundred and eleven acres of 
this grant John Thompson partitioned to his younger son, 
Joseph Hamilton Thompson. It was on this very. estate 
that Thomas Thompson, grandfather of Elizabeth Thomp- 
son Horton, John Thompson, and Joseph Hamilton Thomp- 
son, built his fortified block house. John Thompson, son of 
this early pioneer, was born in this fortification at a time 
when Nashville was a trading post, before Tennessee was a 
State, and when the canebrakes were still the lurking place 
of the Cherokee Indians. It was here that this stalwart 
man of honor helped to clear the canebrakes which were to 
be followed by beautifully cultivated fields. In 1877, 
Joseph Hamilton Thompson built his home, ‘“Brightwcod.” 
The house is situated in the center of a beautiful grove. 
These mighty trees seem to spread their strong branches, as 
in a benediction, over the home of a man whose life is ever 
the story of a true and tried friend, a gentle counsellor, and 
a devout Christian.

“Elmwood” 
, | \HE residence of the Berry family, “Elmwood,” is among the attractive and interesting old places in the vicinity of Nashville. 
It has been the home of the Berry family for fifty-eight years. The house, of the Italian villa type, is situated on a com- 
manding site, three miles from the city, on the Franklin Pike. It is surrounded by rolling fields and woodlands, and its 
beautiful views and lovely old garden make it a most charming home. ° It was purchased in 1852 by Mr. W. W. Berry from George 
W. Martin, Esq., who had improved it with everything requisite for the most luxurious Southern country life. Beautiful shrubbery, 
gardens, orchards, productive farm lands, and all the necessary outhouses, rendered the place a self-supporting community. 
In 1860, it was decided to build the present house, and the family removed to a cottage on the place, expecting to spend a year 
ther. while the new house was under construction. This was partially completed, the*walls being up and the roof on, when war was 
declared, and the work stopped. It is an interesting fact that the same conditions were true of the Maxwell House. The brick in 
both of these buildings was made on the Overton farm, at the same time. 
After the fall of Ft. Donelson and the consequent surrender of Nashville, the place was occupied by Buell’s Army as a camp. 
The scene on their arrival, a cold, rainy winter’s night, was indescribably weird and horrible. Every rail fence on the place was 
used for their camp fires, and the shouting of the soldiers as they pitched their tents, the sharp ring of their axes, the bleating of the 
released and terrified sheep, the lowing of cattle, and the crackling of the burning wood, combined to make an impression never to 
be forgotten. The next day, the country home was a city of tents. 
From this time on, it was occupied by different divisions of the Federal Army, until the time of Hood’s raid, when the Confed- 
erate Army advanced after the Battle of Franklin,.and spent two weeks on the Elmwood hills.° They constructed a line of breast- 
works diagonally across the lawn, within three feet of the house at one point. These were soon abandoned, and there was no heavy 
fighting on the place, though shells from Fort Negley and the bullets of sharpshooters made it an unsafe refuge. Many of these
-P-A-G-E-73

relics were picked up after the war. On the retreat of the Confederate Army the war was virtually over, and there were no more 
camps nor soldiers, but the despoiled home was a striking illustration of the horrors of war. It is estimated that there, were at 
least six hundred trees felled, and the gardens and orchards were a waste. Many of the outhouses were destroyed. The lawns were 
so cut up with trenches and ditches that they had to be plowed in order to level them again. The house alone remained, by a mir- 
acle, uninjured. The architect, Major Heiman, was killed in battle, but when work was resumed in 1866, many of the same work- 
men returned to complete their job, and in the autumn of 1867 the family were at home in their new house. The old spring house 
still bears the marks of the war, in the autographs of the soldiers of many regiments. The grounds have never been restored to 
their former beauty, but it has been a home where hospitality has reigned and where children and grandchildren have loved to 
gather, and it is endeared to them by many sacred memories.

V. Brown, who was a distinguished orator and statesman. He was Governor of Tennessee,-and afterwards Postmaster- 
General under President Buchanan. While living in Washington City, Mrs. Brown was notéd as a gracious and beautiful hostess. 
She was frequently asked to preside at the White House entertainments. Governor Brown died before the outbreak of the Civil 
War, and Mrs. Brown and her two daughters lived alone at “Melrose” during that turbulent time. However, she was pro- 
; tected by the officers of both 
armies, and the place suffered no 
devastation. Many prominent 
men were entertained at “‘Mel- 
rose.”’ The place passed out of 
the hands of Mrs. Brown and

Westwood 
T* home of the late Robert Woods, is situated on the Franklin Pike, and is the oldest house on this road except “Travellers 
Rest,”’ the home of Mr. May Overton. : 
It was built in 1804 by Mr. Deaderick, and many of that family are buried in the old graveyard situated-near the 
garden of this place. 
The name was given by Mr. Woods who married a Miss West. The two names written together made Westwood. Mrs. Woods 
was a sister of William West, an artist of some note, who was a cousin of the famous artist Benjamin West, who was president 
of the Royal Academy of London, succeeding Sir Joshua Reynolds. : 
William West is buried in the old city cemetery at Nashville. 
Some years ago an article in the Century Magazine gave a sketch of Percy Bysshe Shelley by W. E. West. It was made 
at Villa Roma, near Leghorn, in 1822, and was thought, by Lord Byron, to be a fine likeness. From the sketch West afterwards 
made a portrait, but whether this was done in the quiet Florence studio with only the sketch as a guide or whether he obtained 
other sittings at Monte Nero is a question. Certainly there are suggestive differences. The dress and arrangement of the hair 
are unlike, but the pose is the same. This sketch is supposed to have been the last picture made of Shelley, and it was made by 
accident. West was making a portrait of Lord Byron and Shelley happened in to see him, and while the two were engaged in con- 
versation the artist made the pencil sketch: The pictures of Byron and of Shelley were, for many years, the property of a mem- 
ber of the Norvell family of Nashville, who were relatives of West.

Home of Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Berry 
, i \HE residence of Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Berry is on a part of the tract of land formerly owned by the late James A. Woods. This 
tract consisted of more than one hundred acres and extended from the Protestant Orphan Asylum to Vaulx Lane and embraces 
the property of Dudley Gale. It was, prier to the ownership of Mr. Woods, a part of the land owned by the late R. R. Curry, 
the latter owning all the land at one time on the east side of the Franklin Pike from Curry Hill to Vaulx Lane. 
Long prior to the Civil War, there was located on the hill just back of this residence, an old frame-building known as the Binns 
School House. Mr. Binns, the principal, was a well known teacher of his day, and many of the young boys and girls of the neigh- 
borhood were students there. . 
This house remained until the late Andrew J. Duncan became the owner in 1867 or 1868, when it was torn down to make room 
for the cottage built by him. Upon part of this original tract was located that famous school known as “Kirkwood School,” the 
principal of which was the late Andrew Campbell. It was built by the neighbors and was of handsome design. “Mr. Campbell 
continued as principal from its beginning in 1857 until its destruction by fire during the war, or shortly thereafter. It was known 
far and wide, and numbered among its students not only boys from its neighborhood, but many from the city and other States. 
Mrs. Fanny Ring’s residence is near the situs of the school building.

  “Woodstock” 
F HE home of Mr. and Mrs. James C. Bradford was built by 
T Mr. Joe Woods, a prominent member of the Woods family 
of Nashville, and was famous in ante-bellum days for its 
abundant hospitality. Like most of the houses of this section of 
the country, the style of architecture dated about 1830. Its 
magnificent grove of white oak trees extended for quite a mile on 
the pike, and the estate was very extensive. The preservation of 
these trees is due to the fact that during the Civil War, when the 
Federals were devastating this section of the country, a wounded 
Federal officer who had his headquarters in the Woods house 
spared the trees on account of the courtesy shown him by the 
Woods family. After the war, the Woods home passed into other 
hands, and ten years ago Mr. James C. Bradford bought it, giving it the name of ‘Woodstock,’ the name of the old Brad- 
ford estate on the Granny White Pike, the home of his 
great grandfather. 
The house was added to by Mr. Bradford, without 
destroying the beauty of the Colonial architecture. The 
place had been rented for a number of years and much 
abused, there being no evidence of a garden or orna- 
mental landscape effect usually found in these old South- 
ern homes. The hedges, shrubbery and kitchen gardens 
were planted under the direction of Mrs. Bradford. The 
garden is a typical Hardy Garden, planted according to 
color effect and succession of bloom.

“TLealand” 
: | \HE home of Mr. Overton Lea, is situated on the east side 
of the Granny White Road, six miles south of Nashville, 
and contains about twelve hundred acres. The larger 
part of the tract, and that upon which the residence is located, 
is a portion of the original estate of his maternal grandfather, 
Judge John Overton, and has been in possession of the family 
for over a century. Three of the “Harpeth Hills,” which attain 
a considerable elevation above Nashville, are embraced within 
the premises. 
The road to the city, skirting the western boundary, is called 
“Granny White’ in honor of an old lady of the name, who 
owned a small farm, now part of “Lealand,”’ at the foot of the 
gap through the Harpeth Hills. This road is part of the old 
“Natchez Trace,” and the~original road to Franklin and the 
South. 
Thomas H. Benton, who represented Missouri in- the United “And ever and anon the wind 
States Senate so long and so ably, lived at one time on an emi- ee are caer Mies hen 
nence in the rear of the present dwelling house, and read law with Judge Overton. He knew 
“Granny White’’ well, and immortalized her in several of his speeches in the Senate. The old 
lady was very thrifty, and on one occasion he likened the United States ‘government to her, 
holding on tightly to what she had, and ever grasping after more: On another occasion he 
described her farm as so fertile, and the hillside so steep, the pumpkins had-to be fastened to 
stakes to prevent them by their own weight from rolling down into the valley. 
The battle of Nashville, fortunately not characterized by large fatalities, but most important 
in its results, was fought in part on the second day upon “‘Lealand.” The Confederate line ex- 
tended from west of the Granny White Road along:the entire front of ‘Lealand,” and through 
the premises, now owned by Mr. V. L. Kirkman, and those owned by the heirs. of the late Col. 
John Overton, to the ‘Peach Orchard Hill,’» north of and near the old homestead of Judge 
Overton. The first break was west of the road, and as the line held, proceeded east, thé greater 
part of the defeated army made its retreat through “‘Lealand.”’ : 
General Hood, in command of the Confederates, established his headquarters in-the lawn. 
The late Judge John M. Lea, the father of Overton Lea, used to relate an amusing incident con- 
nected therewith. General Hood requested a pitcher of water be sent to him and Judge Lea 
called loudly and several times for his coachman, who finally emerged from behind a stone wall 
and approached, dodging from tree to tree. On learning what was required, he replied, ““Now, 
Mars.-John, if you wants de water, I’ll go get it from the spring, doe de bullets is flying mighty 
thick, but if Mr. Hood ‘wants it, he’ll have to send a sojer or go get it hisself,” and Judge Lea 
himself carried the water to General Hood.

at close range. In the picture may be seen the holes made by the cannon balls as 
they passed through the railing of the upper gallery. These defenseless women, 
courageous as the men who wore the gray, made their way through the darkness, by 
a circuitous route, to the home of Mr. McCrory, nine miles out on the Granny White 
Pike, where they spent the night, the young girls huddled in a small room, while the 
older woman stood guard at the door during the terrible hours of that night. Break- 
fast. being served next morning from the old-fashioned log cabin kitchen detached 
from the house, it is laughingly told that as hot biscuits were brought across to the 
dining-room, straggling soldiers, lurking about, would snatch them from the plates 
about as quickly as they were replaced. 
When the little band of women were carried home next day, it was a sorry 
sight which greeted them. Floor coverings had been taken up and cut into great 
pieces to use as wagon covers. All clothing and provisions were gone, and the only 
reason that a sum of money was left unmolested was because a few weeks previously, 
in anticipation of such an event, the mother herself, assisted by her daughter, had 
dug a hole in the old smoke-house floor, buried this money and with their own unaided 
strength had dragged a huge salt barrel over the spot to cover its hiding place. 
The old home was used for a while as a hospital, the piano being taken as a dis- 
secting table, and the family were driven for a while to seek shelter elsewhere.

STLETOE LODGE,” the home of Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Talbot, is situated on the Granny White Pike, which is a very his- 
toric and romantic old high road. The historian, Fisk, in his account of the battle of Nashville, has thrown an added charm 
over this pike, and so impressed a Tennessee poet that he wrote ‘‘The Granny White Pike should hold as important a place 
in our mind as the road leading to the Hermitage.”

“Glenstrae” 
LENSTRAE,” the home of Mr. and Mrs. 
J. H. Baird, is one of the old homesteads 
near Nashville, located on the Granny 
White Pike, five miles southwest of the city. It 
was the site of one of the earliest ‘stations’ 
erected as outposts to the fort at Nashville, and 
is mentioned in the account of several attacks 
by the Cherokees and Creeks.on the settle- 
ments on the Cumberland. A part of the pres- 
ent building is an old ‘“blockhouse’’ built of 
brick, evidently burned on the spot, the walls of 
which are sixteen inches thick, with loop-holes 
still to be seen. 
  At a very early period the place was the home of a family: named Johnston, of which no survivors are known. Near one 
of the corners of the present tract, just over the line in a small coppice, is a forgotten burial plot, in which are headstones of 
members of the Johnston family whose births ‘date back well into the eighteenth century. Later and for many years the place was 
the home of the late John Johns, a number of whose descendants still live at Nashville; and the place is still known to old residents 
as the “Johns Place.” ; 
It may be mentioned that the old home at ‘“‘Glenstrae,” now considerably enlarged from the pioneer days, was the headquar- 
ters of General A. P. Stewart for several days preceding the bloody battle of Nashville. General Stewart, with several of his staff, 
narrowly escaped capture in the house by a squadron of Federal cavalry sent out from Nashville, effecting their escape only by 
leaving untouched a fine breakfast prepared by Mrs.-Johns. All over the place minnie balls, solid shots, fragments of shrapnel, 
broken bayonets, belt buckles, etc., are yet to be picked up—grim remindets of the desperate but ill-starred effort of the gallant 
Hood to wrest Tennessee from the grasp of the invaders. 
Of far older history is the evidence to be found in all the fields of the fact that the neighborhood of the beautiful spring, which 
is just back of the house, was a favorite spot with the Indians. Though, when the white people first came to this région the valley 
of the Cumberland was claimed by no tribe as a place of residence, and according to traditions, then current, had been for generations 
a sort of neutral hunting zone between the Southern tribes of Creeks, Chickasaws and Cherokees, and the Northern group of tribes 
inhabiting the Miami Valley, the evidence is conclusive that at one time, and for a very long time, the region was populous with a 
resident people, the name and ethnology of which are alike unknown. Everywhere—and this is true of the whole region about 
Nashville—the stone-encased graves of these old-time forest dwellers underlie the fields. These graves are nearly invariably paved 
at the bottom with broken pottery, still bearing the fire marks received in use. Erosion and the plow have broken up thousands 
of these graves, and the bits of pottery, containing fragments of half burnt river shells, glistening in the sun, are a familiar feature 
of the upturned soil.

“Noelton” 
HE home of Mr. and Mrs. O. F. Noel is situated on the 
[ Granny White Pike, and~is probably one of the oldest 
houses in this section. In 1835 Dr..Thomas Gale, of Mis- 
sissippi, purchased the land from Mr. Nathan Ewing, grandfather 
of Mr. Orville Ewing. Dr. Gale built the house with the view of 
making it his summer home. When Nashville passed into the 
hands of the Federal troops, Dr. Gale and family were in Missis- 
sippi and they did not return until the spring of 1864. ‘At that 
time Hood’s Army was drawing near Nashville. His picket was 
stationed at a barn which then stood on the western corner of the 
place. A Federal battery was stationed at what is now called 
Belmont Terrace. General Walthall, who commanded a division 
of the Confederate Army, threw up breastworks which ran diag- 
onally through the Noel place. The -house .was shelled in the 
                 
  early part of the engagement, and when the Con- 
federates fell back, the Federals-took possession 
of it and converted it into a field hospital: The 
house was seriously damaged and was filled with 
the most gruesome. sights and stains which it 
took years to obliterate. In the year 1878 the 
place passed into the hands of its present owner, 
Mr. O. F. Noel. 
“And the landscape lay as if new-created in all its beauty and freshness.”

’ [ \HE E. T. Noel home is situated on the Granny White Pike. This house stands on land granted to Andrew Ewing, one of the 
pioneers of Nashville, February 8, 1792, four years before the entry of Tennessee into the Union. He conveyed to his son, 
Nathan Ewing, who was the father of the late Hon. Andrew Ewing, member of Congress from the Hermitage District and a 
well remembered member of the Nashville bar. The graves of Andrew Ewing, Sr., and Nathan Ewing, with appropriate inscrip- 
tions on their tombs, are located in the old garden. The original mansion occupied by them burned. The present structure was 
erected by G. M. D. Cantrell, who owned the place prior and subsequent to the Civil War. The venerable O. F. Noel purchased 
the property from him many years ago and occupied it as his home until he gave it to his son, the late Edwin T. Noel, whose heirs 
are now the owners. The surroundings are extremely beautiful.

“Tdlewild” 
} : \HE residence of Dr. and Mrs. L..G. Noel represents one of the historic old homes of Davidson County, for many years known 
as the Benton place. It became the property of Mrs. Jesse Benton by purchase, in the early fifties, from a family named Adams. 
Jesse Benton was a brother of Senator Thomas H. Benton of Missouri, whose greatest achievement: perhaps was causing 
the purchase of California from Mexico in 1848. 
It will be remembered that the Bentons had a quarrel with Andrew Jackson in 1812 which culminated in an encounter between 
them, in which Jackson received a wound from which he.never entirely recovered. Jackson and Thomas H. Benton had always 
been friends, but this difficulty was brought about by meddlesome go-betweens. It is pleasing to know that the breach was healed 
before Jackson’s death, for he sent for Benton during his last illness and expressed for him undying friendship 
At the time of Mrs. Benton’s purchase the house was a small one of cedar logs, one of the oldest in the county and doubtless 
contemporaneous with the old Hermitage. Mrs. Benton built the more modern front, remodelling the whole structure, adding porches 
to front and rear. The original log structure was retained, but obscured by siding and. plaster. The old cedar servants’ “quarters 
remain to this day. 
Mrs. Benton was a first cousin of Mrs. James K. Polk, the widow of .President Polk, and between the two there was a strong tie 
of love and friendship. 
During the Civil War this property. was purchased by Mr. John Armstrong Shute, re presented it to his daughter, Mrs. Ste- 
phen W. Childress, for a home. Judge Stephen W. Childress was a nephew of Mrs. Benton’s. The old place was very pleasing and 
home-like until Nashville fell into the hands of the Federals. By the time the fight was over it was but a sad wreck. Shot

and shell had so riddled the 
structure that sunshine and rain 
found easy access to its rooms. 
When, after the war, the Chil- 
dress family took possession of 
their home, months were re- 
quired to repair the damages to 
the property. This, fortunately, 
was done in such a way as to pre- 
serve many of the battle scars 
to this day. These are evi- 
denced by blocks of wood neatly 
fitted, but showing visible re- 
pairs, and by floors still plowed 
with bullet marks. 
During Mrs. Benton’s life 
and residence here the place had 
become famous for its hospital- 
ity, and Mrs. Childress was so 
famous a hostess her house was 
seldom without guests and they 
never could forget the charms 
of her home after once entering 
it. She, being an admirer of 
Robert E. Lee, called the place ‘“‘Lee Monte.”’ Sometime in the seven- 
ties the place was sold to Mr. Joseph Spence, who moved to Texas, 
leaving his brother, Wm. Spence, formerly of Murfreesboro, in posses- 
sion. Mr. Spence, having several daughters, the old house kept up its 
reputation for gaiety and hospitality under their regime. In 1881 the 
property was purchased by its present owner, Dr. L. G. Noel, and has 
been occupied by him ever since. He changed the name of the place to 
“Tdlewild.”’

From the house there is a lovely outlook in every 
direction. Beyond the spacious fields are the ever- 
encircling and interlacing blue hills which surround 
Nashville in such unfailing beauty. 
The house is well over a hundred years old. It 
was given by Mr. Joseph Phillips to his daughter, 
Mary, who married Mr. Jesse Wharton. The place 
has changed hands many times, but the graves of 
the original owners remained there until recently, 
when the dead were removed. <A pathetic incident 
” connected with this removal was that all that was 
found in Mrs. Wharton’s resting place was a hand-

many years.

  “BELLE MEADE”

  “We see and feel the old time over all.” 
“Belle Meade” 
NE of the most picturesquely romantic homes of the 
Q) South was “Belle Meade’’ farm on the Harding Pike. 
Historic from every standpoint is this splendid old prop- 
erty—historic in its first ownership, and in its long and splendid 
life; in the famous men it has sheltered, and the famous stock 
it has bred; historic as a type of the Southern home of a period 
that has passed away, and in the life and service of the men 
who made its greatness. 
In 1779, John Harding of Virginia came to Tennessee, and 
in 1803, on Richland Creek, he laid the foundation of the won- 
derful plantation that was to arouse a national admiration. 
However, it was William Harding, the second master of the place, — 
who brought ‘Belle Meade’ into her world-wide reputation as 
a nursery of great stock, and in his declining years, General 
William H. Jackson, his son-in-law, relieved him of his heavier 
responsibilities, taking charge of the place. General Jackson’s 
life was of much historic importance. A young soldier, just out 
of West Point, he served in the war with Mexico, and on the 
frontier he fought against the Indians in company with Kit 
Carson and La Rue, the famous French guide. Last of all, he fought for the Southern cause in the Civil War. In his Memoirs, 
General Grant gives an interesting account of how he narrowly 
    “Across its antique portico 
Tall poplar trees their shadows throw.”

beautiful picture. Here Grover Cleveland and his young bride

were entertained. Immediately following the days of the Civil 
War, weary old Confederates met here to discuss the large and 
difficult problem of rebuilding their lost fortunes and their 
devastated South. Theodore Roosevelt visited the master of 
the mansion, and with him helped to found the Boone-Crockett 
Hunting Club, to which no man was eligible to membership 
until he had brought down some one of the three big game of 
America—the bear, the elk or the buffalo. Benjamin Harrison, 
President of the United States, once visited “Belle Meade,” and 
many other famous and historic characters from all over this 
country and from Europe have enjoyed the hospitality of this 
historic home; and here the Hon. J. M. Dickinson for a brief 
season made his home. 
“Belle Meade”’ was the oldest thoroughbred breeding establish- 
ment in America. General Harding, who was a devoted lover 
of fine horses, always spoke of them as ‘The Royal Family.” 
Among the noted horses of his day was the famous Priam, 
sire of Crucifix, winner of the One Thousand and Two Thousand 
Guineas and Oaks; Bonnie Scotland, Great Tom, Sovereign, and 
John Morgan, whose bones are buried on the soil whose fame 
was theirown. The great mares, Gamma and Mariposa, are also 
buried at “Belle Meade,’ and here, too, lies Iroquois, famous 
as the only American horse to win the English Derby, and 
winner of the St. Leger and Prince of Wales stakes. Luke 
Blackburn, peer of any racing horse in America; Proctor Knott; 
the Enquirer, to whose greatness the Cincinnati Enquirer erected 
the monument at “Belle Meade;’’ and last of all, the Commoner, 
who still lives—are but a few of that famous establishment. 
In speaking of all these great horses, we must not fail to 
mention their faithful groom, Uncle Bob. With his placid black face and true loyal heart, he outlived the several masters 
of the estate on which he was born. On his dying bed he sent 
for the young widow of his last master, and he exacted a promise 
from her that his bones should be carried back to ‘‘Belle Meade”’ 
and there his dust should rest until the last awaking. 
On the death of General William H. Jackson, his son, William 
Harding Jackson, assumed control of the property, which gave 
gallant promise of retaining its prosperity, when the young owner 
was stricken with fever and after a brief suffering passed away. 
In the death of William Harding Jackson was sounded the death 
knell of “Belle Meade” the Beautiful; the queen of Southern 
farms passed under the hammer.

sides of the Harding Pike. It adjoins the celebrated Belle*Meade deer park, and was purchased by Judge 
Malone, who here started the raising of Jersey cattle. He was one of the first importers of this variety of 
stock. 
The original home was completely destroyed by fire in 1903, and it was replaced by the present, house. 
It is built of stone found on the place... This stone is not only of a peculiar color and composition, but is said

The old house of some fifteen rooms was built of brick and 
stone, the brick being molded and burned and the stone quarried 
and hauled by the slaves. The floors of this old house were 
hand dressed and of ash; the sleepers and rafters were cut out 
by hatchet and adz and are as good to-day as when put into 
the house. The shingles were of cedar and hand made and some 
of them are on the house to-day, though this building was com- 
pleted about 1850. 
The only daughter of W. E. Watkins married Dr. William 
Bass, Of this union there were five sons. Those living are 
Major W. J. Bass of Chattanooga, and O. E. Bass of West Nash- 
ville, both of whom now own a greater part of the old tract. 
During the Civil War a great many important events took 
place on this property. : 
Dr. William Bass left home to cast his lot. with General For- 
rest; was commissioned captain and ordered’ to Nashville to 
recruit a troop of cavalry. 
After Captain Bass had recruited a troop of cavalry he came 
in close to Nashville and passed one night at General Harding’s, 
on the Harding Pike, known as “Belle Meade.’ Some of the 
negroes informed the Federals of his whereabouts, but he got 
away in time not to be captured. 
tain Bass, with a few select men, went into camp on the Cum- 
berland River, near the Charlotte Pike, and alone went to see 
his wife and children at the old Watkins place, leaving orders 
for his troop of cavalry to come for him at three o’clock in the A night or so after this, Cap-- morning in order that they might attack the Federal pickets 
stationed on the Barrow hill, near Nashville. Some of the 
darkies on the place learned of Captain Bass’ arrival at home 
and immediately reported to the Federals at Nashville. The 
Thirty-third Michigan Regiment was ordered out (and it is not 
stated definitely who was commander, whether Rosecrans or 
Alger). This regiment reached the old place about two o’clock 
in the morning, surrounded the house, and: called upon Captain 
Bass to’come out. He came to the front door, thinking the call 
was from his own men, and without a word of warning he was 
shot down by this Federal regiment, and left in the front yard. 
Hardly a part of his body escaped the bullets. The old home 
was ransacked and almost torn to pieces. Captain Bass’ wife, 
with five little children, was left on the place alone, every negro 
being ordered away. W. E. Watkins, then nearly seventy years 
of age, was also taken prisoner to the city. This young mother, 
with her five children was left to care for as best she could the 
murdered husband, and it was several days before proper burial 
-~- arrangements could be perfected, the Federals refusing to allow 
anyone to pass through the lines and declining to permit any 
help whatever. 
Several days after this, Forrest came into this section and had 
his revenge. Several gunboats were captured on the river and 
burned. Before these gunboats were captured, an attempt was 
made to destroy the old house, and several cannon balls were 
shot through it. 
On the river banks, high in the hills, there are many graves 
where the dead are buried, with no marks to distinguish them. 
The writer of this article recalls, as a child, standing by and 
seeing four or five soldiers buried in a trench, in their uniforms, 
the Federals in one place and Confederates in another. 
Much more could be written of the same history, but what is 
the use of recalling to this generation the bloody deeds and cruelty 
of-a generation that is past.

whole of Robertson’s Bend, and is in the shape almost 
exactly of a horseshoe, there being no outside fencing 
except a stone wall extending across the front of the 
place, east and west from the river on one side to the 
river on the other. The land in the bend of the river 
was granted in 1784 by the State of North Carolina to 
General James Robertson, who led the first colony 
making a permanent settlement at Nashville. The 
house was built by Josiah Robertson, a son of James 
Robertson, about 110 years ago. A daughter of Josiah 
Robertson married Leonard Cheatham, who was Post-

The house stands upon an imposing em-

  “Through all the long mid-summer day 
The meadow sides are sweet with hay.” 
Mr. and Mrs. Baxter have taken great pleasure in improving 
the houses and grounds, until now there is perhaps no other 
large farm in the State in a higher state of cultivation than this. 
The place contains 1,800 acres of culti- 
vated land, about 1,000 acres of which 
is in beautiful meadows of timothy, 
alfalfa and clover, and the lawns and 
woodlands are set in blue grass. The

  “Sylvan Hall” 
NE of the first brick habitations built in Middle Tennessee, in 1808, is now standing in good preservation and is known as the 
() William D. Philips home, built by his father, Joseph Philips 2d, who emigrated from Tarboro, Edgecombe County, North 
Carolina, in 1791, with his wife, Milbry (abbreviation of Milberry), one daughter and a number of slaves. 
The old Philips residence is six miles from Nashville on the Dickerson Pike. 
The first purchase of land by Joseph Philips 2d was one section, on which the old home now stands—a grant from the State of 
North Carolina, which Joseph Philips 2d purchased from the grantee in 1790, the year before he emigrated to this section of the 
Territory of North Carolina. His first residence, built in 1791, of logs and hand-sawed plank, was burned in March, 1808, and the 
construction of the old home now standing, was commenced at once. The brick were made on the place, the plank and timbering 
cut with the primitive overhead or whipsaw from the wild forest adjacent, a deep cellar underlying the entire main building was exca- 
vated, and two rooms were occupied the following Christmas. The furniture—tables, chairs and bedsteads—was made on the place, 
and some of the furniture saved from the burning of oe first residence is now, after a lapse of one hundred and twenty years, part 
of the furnishing of the ancestral home. 
The brick kitchen and spinning room, with the olden time loom, on which was woven into cloth the cotton and wool grown on the 
place to clothe the family of the owner and his slaves, are still standing. The old kitchen has been used by five generations of the 
family and it contains an open, wood fireplace and bread oven in one side of the chimney wall. Numerous articles for domestic ser- 
vice, brought from North Carolina with the forefather of the Philips family, are still in use by the present owner of the old home- 
stead, Mary Elizabeth Polk, only child of Rufus King Polk and Margaret Philips Polk. 
The original barn, stables and granary are untouched by decay. 
William D. Philips was born in 1804. He married Eliza Dwyer of Franklin, Tennessee, in 1824, who died in 1871. To them
-P-A-G-E-151
  were born six children—Milbry, who married William P. Harding; Mary, who married John Felix DeMoville; Joseph 3d, who married 
Annie Cozart of Columbus, Mississippi; Daniel Dwyer, who married Mary Elizabeth Finn of Nashville, Tennessee; and Margaret, 
who married Rufus King Polk of Ashwood, Tennessee. William D., Jr., died in boyhood. 
William D. Philips, before his death in 1879, divided his farm of about one thousand acres and conveyed by deed of gift the sub- 
divisions to his children, his daughter, Margaret, becoming the possessor of the old home built by her grandfather, Joseph Philips 2d. 
In contrast with the spirit of unrest and change that characterizes American life of the present, this property has been in the 
Philips family, by direct inheritance and unbroken title, for one hundred and twenty years.

“Maplewood” 
, i \HIS beautiful farm of fourteen hundred acres, situated 
four miles from Nashville, on the Gallatin Pike, will always 
be a spot of interest to the people of this community on 
account of the owners and occupants who have lived and loved, 
married and died there. 
The residence was built by Colonel Josiah Williams of Chapel 
Hill, North Carolina. It was one of the first brick houses erected 
in this vicinity, and, in its day was considered a model of archi- 
tectural beauty and elegance. 
“Maplewood” was the scene of the marriage of three of Colonel 
Williams’ daughters to the three distinguished Ewing brothers, 
Edwin, Andrew and Orville. Mrs. Andrew Ewing was the 
mother of Mrs. Henry Watterson. On the occasion of her mar- 
tiage the weather was so cold that the wedding guests were 
driven across the river on ice. The other daughters were Mrs. 
James C. Warner, Mrs. A. J. Duncan, Mrs. Whitaker, and Mrs. 
Kennedy. 
From Colonel Williams the place passed into the possession 
of Dr. David W. Yandell, who afterwards moved to Louisville 
and became one of the most eminent physicians of Kentucky. 
He was the uncle of the sculptress, Miss Enid Yandell. Dr. Yandell sold the place to Mr. George W. Payne, grand- 
father of Miss Mary Hannah Johnson. The next owner was 
Colonel Henry Blood, who sold it to Colonel Jere Baxter. Colo- 
nel Baxter improved the place, retaining intact, however, every- 
thing of intrinsic beauty. The old flower garden and the fine 
lines of the Colonial house were left undisturbed—not even the 
interior was touched except to put in modern conveniences. 
The paneled doors, high mantels and the quaint staircase were 
retained. 
Colonel Baxter had for many years been a collector of objects 
of art and “Maplewood” was filled with treasures brought from 
all over the world. There was also an extensive library, contain- 
ing many volumes of rare editions. 
Colonel Baxter imported direct his Welsh and Shetland ponies, 
Holstein and Jersey cattle, and Norman and Percheron horses. 
He gave fourteen acres of the land to the Masonic Widows’ 
and Orphans’ Home. He added the McIver place to “Maple- 
wood,” thus greatly extending the property. When the city 
grew out to the farm and made the land very valuable, Colonel 
Baxter was persuaded to sell it to a land syndicate, and with him 
passed from “Maplewood” its last individual owner.

HE country home of Mr. and Mrs. Percy Warner, located 
two and one-half miles from the city on the Gallatin 
Pike, was purchased by Mr. Warner's father, Mr. James 
C. Warner, for his summer home, in 1890. He remodeled the 
house and beautified the grounds. 
This is one of the oldest places in the county,-and when pur- 
chased by Mr. James C. Warner, it had not changed hands for 
one hundred and four years. At his death, in 1895, it became 
the home of Mr. Percy Warner. 
The gardens at “‘Renraw” are very beautiful, having been 
the special care of Mrs. James C. Warner, whose love for flowers 
prompted her constant care, which the gardens liberally rewarded 
with their beautiful flora. In her greenhouse she has rare plants 
which she has cared for more than forty years.

“Riverwood” stands in undisturbed dignity one 
of the best of the fine old country houses around 
Nashville. Four miles on the Porter Pike, which was 
built and named for the original owner, lies “Riverwood” 
farm, belonging to the family of Colonel Duncan B. 
Cooper. The place was first owned by Alexander James 
Porter, a prominent wholesale merchant and land owner 
who came to Tennessee from Ireland in 1793. He built 
the house in the first years of the nineteenth century, 
and it was the home of three generations of Porters— 
Alexander James, son of the first owner; then James 
Alexander and his son, Alexander James. 
The place was typically the Southern country home 
of generous hospitality, many slaves, fine horses, and 
lavish entertainment. Its white-columned entrance wel- 
comed all the notables of the times. 
Of*particular interest is the original name of this 
place, “Tammany-Wood,”’ called for the old estate .of 
the Porters in Ireland, “Tammany Hall.” Long years before the “Tammany Boss” came into 
power in New York, a Tammany flourished in the fair groves of Tennessee, but in a more gentle, gracious way. The Civil War 
left its devastating mark upon this goodly estate,.many of the great trees being demolished and the furniture chopped up for kindling 
wood by the soldiers of the invading army. In 1851 Captain Alexander Porter sold the place to Judge William Cooper, Tennessee’s 
most noted Chancellor. The name was then changed to “Riverwood,” but by many of the old residents, ““whose yesterdays look 
backward with a smile,’’ it is fondly remembered as ‘‘Tammany-Wood.”’ | AVING weathered the storms of over a century,

“Belmont” 
Mrs. Joseph H. Acklen. It was built in 1850, and, at that 
time, it was, perhaps, the handsomest' private establish- 
ment in the United States. Mrs. Acklen’s first husband was 
Mr. Franklin of Sumner County. He was a man of great wealth 
and lived most of the time on one of his plantations, of which 
he owned seven, and a large number of slaves. After his death, 
his widow married Colonel Acklen, who built their Belmont home. 
It was an exact reproduction of an Italian villa. In front of 
the house was a lovely formal garden, with beds of flowers, stat- 
uary, fountains, and a beautiful lake, in the center of which 
was a tower with an observatory. In the distance, always to be 
seen, were the ever changing blue hills. 
In 1864, during the Battle of Nashville, the tower was used 
by the Federals to learn the movements of the Confederate Army. 
The following interesting history, in connection with this 
place, was taken from the war reminiscences of Mrs. S. A. Gaut, 
who was a life-long friend and relative of Mrs. Acklen. 
“After the death of Colonel Acklen, in 1863, his wife felt that 
it was necessary for her to go to Louisiana to look after her 
estates there. 
The Federals held the river and the Confederates were a few B's toes “Belmont” was the palatial home of Mr. and miles back. Mrs. Acklen persuaded me to go with her, saying 
I could leave my children at Belmont with her mother, who was 
also my aunt, Mrs. P. B. Hayes. After reaching the plantation, 
we learned that General Polk of the Confederate Army, had 
ordered all cotton to be burned. 
Mrs. Acklen, not being strong, asked me to see General Polk 
and get him to rescind the order. Under the protection of an 
old gentleman friend, I drove, in a carriage drawn by mules, 
over mud roads. When we had gone 150 miles and were within 
twelve miles of General Polk’s headquarters, we were compelled 
to turn back on account of the rapid advance of General Sher- 
man’s Army. I made, in all, eight trips to see various generals, 
suffering many hardships. However, the cotton was saved, and 
Mrs. Acklen was permitted to send it to New Orleans. From 
there it was shipped to Liverpool and sold for seventy-five cents 
a pound. From this sale she realized nine hundred and sixty 
thousand dollars.”’ : 
This beautiful home is now the property of Belmont College. 
It has been greatly enlarged, and the owners have shown the 
good taste“to keep the architecture of the additions in perfect 
accord with the original place. It now stands as one of the larg- 
est and most elegant girls’ schools in the South.

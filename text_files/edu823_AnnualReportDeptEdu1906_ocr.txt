DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
: Nasuvitix, Tenw., December 1, 1906. 
To His Excellency, John I. Cox, Governor of Tennessee: . 
In. compliance with Section 7, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873, 
T herewith submit the Annual Report of the Department of Public 
Instruction for the year ending June 30, 1906. 
CAMPAIGN FOR EpucaTION. 
The success of any educational system depends not only upon 
the amount of money raised and the number of children attending 
the schools, but upon the sentiment of the people and their interest 
in educational affairs. The most important work of the Depart- . 
ment of Public Instruction cannot be told in statistical tables; but 
the results are found in the interest of the people manifested in 
their public schools, the qualification and work of the teachers, . 
the improvement in methods, and the real education of the pupils. 
On assuming the duties of this office in 1903, I undertook a thor- 
ough campaign of the State with a view of setting before the people 
the real objects and purposes of our public-school system. In this 
work I was fortunate in having as a leader that splendid educator, 
Prof. P. P. Claxton, of the University of Tennessee, who gave his 
services to the cause without cost to the State and has worked ear- 
nestly and zealously for it. The State owes him a great debt of 
gratitude, and on behalf of the children of the State whom I rep- 
resent, I publicly acknowledge that obligation. We have gone into 
every county in the State, and have represented the public-school 
system as a great business enterprise through which the State is at- 
tempting to develop the character and wealth-producing power of its 
citizenship. We have urged the establishment and maintenance of a 
. thorough system of schools, beginning with the primary grades and 
ending with the State University. Through such ‘a system only
-P-A-G-E-27
can all of the available talent of the State he prepared for the 
great work of developing our resources and making our citizenship. 
We have urged the education of every child in the State on the 
ground that the State is strong only when it is composed of strong 
citizenship, and that as in a chain, one weak link can weaken the 
entire chain, so one small part of the citizenship uneducated can 
interfere to that extent with our progress and development. 
It is urged that the doctrine of universal education is unsafe on 
' the ground that it would leave tio one to “ dig the ditch” and “do 
the drudgery of life.’ The answer is plain. The educated man 
will do the work, or more likely he will invent an easier way 
through machinery for doing it. Universal education means the 
elevation of all of our citizenship, and not the destruction of any 
industry or calling. 
In this educational campaign we have urged the necessity for 
larger county. taxation to meet the additional appropriations re- 
cently made by the State. We have shown the necessity for a 
larger appropriation by the State for the maintenance of the 
county schools, the establishment of normal schools and high . 
schools, and the support of the State University. In every county 
_in the State the people have responded to these sentiments by pass- 
ing. resolutions favoring appropriations for these purposes. We 
have also urged the building of comfortable and attractive school 
buildings, the consolidation of schools, the employment of good 
teachers, full-and-regular attendance for the schools, and the cre- 
ation of such.sentiment in every community as will force. every 
man to take advantage of the opportunities given by the State for 
the education of the children. 
In April we announced a list of dates for a series of educational 
Inass meetings, embracing every county in the State. This’ cam- 
paign began on July 30 and continued until the middle of Novem- 
ber. Every county in the State was visited, and the interest mani- 
fested by the people was perhaps greater than in any political. or 
other campaign the State has ever had. We estimate that fully 
100,000 people attended the meetings. One may ask: “ What are 
the results?” -As stated, it is-impossible to tell. We only know 
that .the sentiment in Tennessee is in favor of improvement of all
-P-A-G-E-28
—21— . : 4 
public schools; and the fact that both political parties are pledged 
to this, that every man offering for office in the State declares him- 
self in favor of better public schools, is evidence ‘of the sentiment 
of the people. bes : ee 
In the campaign work there was no more important factor than 
the press of the State’ The city dailies, as well as the county 
weeklies, used their’columns freely to help in the great cause.’ ~ 
County SUPERVISION. 
I must again urge upon the General Assembly the necessity of 
such legislation as will insure to County Superintendents a salary 
enabling them to give their entire time, at least during the school 
term, to the duties of their office. At present many Superintend- 
ents in the State are paid as low as $150: per year, and some even 
less than that. This will barely defray the expenses of the office; 
and as a result they are compelled to devote almost all of their 
time, to some other employment. Without competent supervision 
and direction no enterprise can succeed. The business of educa- 
tion is no exception to the rule) The County Superintendent 
should be trained to his work and capable of executing plans for 
the improvement of the schools in his county and the better train-_ 
ing of his teachers. He should be able to carry on among the peo- 
ple a campaign to stimulate interest in the schools and to create a 
sentiment in favor of the schools. This,"in my opinion, is to-day 
the strategic point in the educational system of this State, and we 
should at least fix a minimum salary for this office. ‘The Act re- 
quiring a certificate of qualification to be eligible to the office of 
County Superintendent has accomplished great good, and I believe 
we have in the State an efficient corps of County Superintendents; 
but they must be better paid to enable them to render the service 
required of their office. A competent Superintendent could save 
to the county the full amount of his salary by carefully watching 
the finances of the schools. , 
' STATISTICS. 
The statistical tables contained in this report show encouraging 
progress in our public schools. I have endeavored this year to get
-P-A-G-E-29
—29— 
accurate reports from all counties and cities. The County Super- 
intendents were instructed not to include in their reports anything 
but statistics actually furnished -by the school directors, teachers, 
and county officials. This eliminated from consideration districts 
failing to report, and probably reduced in many cases the aggre- 
gates from what they otherwise would have- been, but I have 
thought it best to confine my report strictly to the actual figures 
given. Owing to the changing of City Superintendents in a num- 
ber of cities in the State, it was impossible to get accurate reports 
for the year; and County Superintendents, in making their reports, 
did not include these cities in their annual reports. A number of 
city reports were received at this office after the County Superin- 
tendents’ reports had been closed, and are included in the report 
of city schools, but not in the aggregate for counties. 
On. account of yellow fever at New Orleans, a rigid quarantine 
was established, covering a great part of West Tennessee. This 
interfered with the attendance of the schools in many counties in 
that section. Notwithstanding this fact, the reports show an in- 
’ erease of 895 in number of pupils enrolled and 2,934 in average 
daily attendance over the previous year. The school property in- 
creased in value $701,460. Of this, $329,294.79 was actually paid 
“out of the school fund, and the remainder is accounted for by the 
issuance of bonds and private subscriptions. The total annual re- 
ceipts from all sources for schools were-$3,315,385.84, while the 
previous year the total was $3,101,847.33. This is exclusive of the 
balance on hand at the beginning of the year. It will be seen that 
we have gained in’ annual receipts $213,538.51, notwithstanding 
the fact that the State appropriation from the surplus was nearly 
$200,000 less than the previous year. The amount on hand at 
_the end of the school year—June 30, 1906—was $1,277,822.54. It 
will be understood. that this amount was available for the summer 
and fall schools and before the collection of taxes assessed for the 
year 1906. The average school term was 116 days, while in 1905 
it was 113 and in 1902 it was 95. This estimate is made by mul- 
tiplying the average length of term in each county by the number 
of schools in the county and then dividing the sum of these prod- 
ucts by the aggregate number of schools in the State. If instead
-P-A-G-E-30
—93— 
of the number of schools I had used the number of teachers, as is 
done in some States, the length of term would show about 123 
days. I believe the estimate as made in this report to be upon the 
correct basis. 
The figures given in this report, compared with the report of 
1902, will show an increase of 23,653 in enrollment and 10,085 in 
average daily attendance. The. school term is increased in four 
years one month and one day, while the average salary paid teach- 
ers has increased $7.34, or a little over 25 per cent. The value of 
school property has increased $1,700,089.24. Special attention is 
called to the fact that as the State has increased its appropriations, 
the counties have done likewise; and while four years ago thirty- 
two counties in the State were levying as high as 25 cents on the 
$100 special county tax, there are now fifty-nine counties levying 
this amount. As stated in my last annual report, our school sys- 
tem is a State and county system combined ; and it is especially 
gratifying to know that the people in the county are willing to 
levy local tax to increase their school facilities. 
Some plan must be devised to get more accurate reports from 
county Trustees. This department has made every possible effort 
to this end, and yet there are some discrepancies in this report. 
This is shown especially in the amount reported on hand at the 
close of the year. The difference is accounted for merely from the 
fact that the new Trustees went in on September 1. The new re- 
ports show the balance on hand at that date, while the old reports 
give the balance on hand at the close of the school year, June 30. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
In my previous reports I have emphasized the necessity of bet- 
ter preparation of teachers. I have repeatedly- urged County Su- 
perintendents to license only persons fully qualified for the work 
and of good moral character, but so long as the State fails to pro- 
vide schools for the special training of teachers we will continue 
to have a large per cent of untrained and poorly prepared men and 
women engaged in the responsible work of training our boys and 
girls. Much of the energy, effort, and time of such teachers is
-P-A-G-E-31
—24— 
wasted on account of their lack of knowledge-of child nature, men- 
tal development, and right method of instruction. ‘It is poor econ- 
orhy on the part of the State to allow this-great waste, _ when, ‘with 
the expenditure of a few thousand dollars, we could gave so” “much 
time and money. ' The time has come when ‘the State should es- 
tablish good training schools for teachers in each grand division 
of the State, and I urge appropriations for this purpose. Learn- 
‘ing is not education, and the mere fact that our boys and girls are 
able to pass their examinations on the subjects taught in our public 
schools is no’ evidence of the efficiency of our schools. We must 
look to the real development—mentally, morally, and physically— 
for results; and. this can only be secured by having in our schools 
well-trained and thoroughly equipped teachers that understand how 
to use the work of the school for the real development of the child. 
Summer ScHoots anp [NsTITUTES. 
The great body of our teachers are dependent upon the summer 
schools and institutes for all the professional training that they get. 
‘The Summer School of the South, at Knoxville, had pérhaps the 
most successful session in its history. No help was received from 
‘the State, and it was dependent upon the income from personal 
donations and fees of teachers attending. This school has unques- 
tionably been a great help in developing the professional spirit — 
among our teachers, and deserves substantial recognition. 
The Peabody College for Teachers held its annual summer ses- 
sion with the largest attendance in its history, and I could not too 
highly commend its work. This likewise was maintained without 
State help. The money was raised through the efforts of Chan- 
-cellor Porter and the fees of persons attending. 
The reports of our State and County Institutes will show that : 
the greater number of the teachers of the State attended an insti- 
-tute of some kind, and that the work done was perhaps of a higher 
order than ever before. When it is considered that the teachers 
of the State received an average of only $36 a month for less than 
six months in the year and that attendance upon institutes and 
summer schools required an outlay of money for board and: ex
-P-A-G-E-32
—25— 
penses, it must be seen that the report of these institutions shows’ 
a decided advance in the professional spirit. 
In addition to County. Institutes in every county in the State, 
the usual number of State Institutes: was held, and the reports 
show a decided increase in attendance. These institutes are of the 
nature of summer schools, and.have accomplished much good for 
the teachers of the State. I. urge a continuation of an appropri- 
ation for this purpose. 
CONSOLIDATION. 
The Act of 1993 making school and civil districts coextensive 
has resulted in the consolidation of a number of rural schools, but 
nothing like the number that should have been consolidated. There 
are yet several hundred small schools in the State that should be 
abolished. / 
The consolidation of schools leads to the erection of more com- 
modious buildings, with larger accommodations and better means 
of instruction. It tends to secure the services of more competent 
teachers. It offers facilities for classifying those of different ages 
and attainments and for employing a higher class of teachers for 
their-instruction. It economizes in school funds, and, by cover- 
ing a larger territory, gives a broader field for the selection of 
school officials. Everything possible should be done to encourage 
the consolidation of schools, and I believe the time has come when 
the most progressive counties in the State can undertake the trans- 
portation of pupils. 
ScHooL ARCHITECTURE. * 
In my report of 1904 I suggested that the Legislature make an 
appropriation for the preparation and publication of a. pamphlet 
giving designs and specifications for public-school buildings. 
f renew this recommendation, and urge as reasons:- It would - 
insure more suitable houses, with proper ventilation, conveniences, 
and surroundings. It would result in the saving of thousands of 
dollars now spent in the erection of houses suited to ‘the purposes. 
The schoolhouse should be the pride.of the community and the best 
building in the entire community. It should bea place attractive
-P-A-G-E-33
—26— 
not only to children, but to the entire citizenship; and this can only 
be secured by the plan suggested. 
Stare EXaMINATION oF TEACHERS. 
I believe the time has come when some arrangement should be 
made for uniform examination of teachers. Under the present 
system, the granting of county certificates is solely in the hands of 
the County Superintendent. While having as a guide the general 
directions issued by the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, the County Superintendent really sets his own standard, and 
his markings may be very liberal or rigid. In the grading of one. 
County Superintendent 90 per cent may mean no more than 50 
per cent by. another. The County Superintendent is also subjected 
to the importunities of relatives and friends of unsuccessful candi~ 
dates, and has before him the temptation of straining a point that 
a certificate.may be issued to some applicant who has in fact failed 
in the examination. 
So long as we have ninety-six County Superintendents we would | 
have as many standards. The ideals. of what teachers should be 
are so low in some counties that teachers holding first-class certifi- 
cates in these counties could obtain only a second-class or third- 
class in others. Being the sole judge of the fitness of applicants, 
the County Superintendent may often become careless or negligent. 
A State examination and certification of teachers would make 
a certificate good in any county in the State and remove all of the 
above objections to it. 
Counry Hien Scuoots. 
In all parts of the State interest in the public high school is 
growing rapidly. The law authorizing County Courts to estab- 
lish and maintain public high schools was enacted in 1899. Up 
to July, 1905, seven counties had levied a tax for high schools or 
‘ had-made appropriations for them out of county funds, and five 
of these counties had established one school each, At the time of 
writing this report—December, 1906—seventeen counties have lev- 
ied taxes or made appropriations for high schools, and in fifteen
-P-A-G-E-34
= 
of these counties thirty-two schools have been established. The 
annual income of these schools from taxes and appropriations is, 
approximately, $80,000; and they own property valued at some- 
thing like $175,000. Most of the schools are taught in buildings 
belonging to city or district schools. In more than a dozen other 
counties committees have been appointed and other steps taken 
preliminary to voting on the question of establishing high schools 
and levying taxes for their support. 
This movement is in harmony with the policy of all progressive 
‘States and nations. .In the United States, as a whole, the number 
of high schools has increased in the last forty years from a few 
dozen to about seven thousand, and at no time has their growth 
in number and efficiency been so rapid as at present. 
No longer is the high school regarded as a luxury, an unnecessary 
appendage to the common-school system, or only as a necessary 
connecting link between the elementary school and the college. 
Everywhere it is coming to be thought of as an essential part, a 
most important part, of the entire school system—its heart and cen-. 
ter, from which the currents of life and interest flow downward 
through the elementary school and upward through the college 
and university. Boys and girls enter the high school at the most 
critical period of life—the period of early adolescence—when they ~ 
are passing from childhood to manhood and womanhood and when 
character is made and fixed as at no other time. The high school 
must give them that deeper and broader knowledge of history, lit- 
erature, and science, and such skill in modern industrial arts and 
household economics, as is necessary for good citizenship and suc- 
cessful living in our modern industrial democracy. . 
Among the most patent practical reasons for the establishment 
and maintenance of public high schools in all the counties of this 
State at this time may be mentioned the following: 
1. The opportunity thus offered for the better education of teach- 
ers for the elementary schools. With good public high schools in 
every county, it will be easy to make graduation from a high 
school, or equivalent education, the minimum requirement for a - 
teacher’s license, and thus to increase immensely the value and 
efficiency of all these schools. ‘This reason alone would justify the
-P-A-G-E-35
98 
counties and the State in making the necessary appropriations for 
the support of public high schools. 
2. Influence on the attendance and interest in the lower schools. 
Without the high school, the county school system is incomplete. - 
There is no common goal toward which all the pupils in the pub- 
lic schools of the county may work; hence many quit school, fall- 
ing out irregularly before the elementary school course is finished. 
The maintenance of good public high schools always strengthens 
the lower schools, increases their attendance, and deepens their 
interest. 
3. In every: county of the State much time is lost by the teachers 
of elementary schools attempting to teach a few pupils in advanced 
subjects. ‘wo or three pupils in a district school of forty or fifty 
children take up much valuable time of the teacher which should 
be given to the studies of the larger number of pupils in lower 
grades. ‘To teach a class of two or three in these advanced subjects. 
requires as much time as it does to teach twenty or thirty in the 
lower and larger classes. Nor is it to be expected that the higher 
work can be done satisfactorily in the elementary schools. There 
is always danger that these older pupils, out of sympathy with the 
work and play and discipline of the younger children, may become 
disturbing elements in the school. Plainly, it will be good econ- 
omy to transfer all such pupils to central high schools, where they 
can be taught. more effectively and more economically, in larger 
classes, with others of their own age and advancement, thus leay- 
ing the elementary teachers. to do the work expected of them and 
for which they are better prepared. : 
4. There is an ever greater demand for men and women with the 
education and training of the colleges, universities, and technical 
schools. Such men and women are sought for leadership in all 
our social and industrial life, and to them go. the most liberal:re~ 
wards. In a democracy such education must be accessible to all 
alike. But without the public high school, this is impossible. 
Few farmers, mechanics, country merchants, and professional men 
are able to send their sons and daughters away to private prepar- 
atory schools for three or four years and then give them the as- 
sistance necessary to make even a beginning in college. By giving
-P-A-G-E-36
—99— 
the opportunity of adequate college preparation at a minimum 
expense, the public high school will become an open door to these © 
higher schools. 
5. But only a few.will go to college or the technical school. The 
“great majority must depend upon the local high school for a knowl- 
edge of the elementary principles of physics, chemistry, biology, 
and economics, and their practical application in the home, in the 
shop, on the farm, and in the store, which our boys and girls must 
have if, as men and women, they are to hold their own in the 
world-wide competition of modern industrial and commercial life 
and do their part in the world-wide codperation through which all 
life is lifted to higher levels. The rural high school should give 
special attention to the principles of agriculture and household 
economics. Upon the public high school also must most of our 
boys and girls-depend for preparation for citizenship and the 
culture and refinement of their own souls, both of which are cer- 
tainly not less important than their ability to do their part in the 
industrial world. 
Our public high school law is a very good one, and is working 
well in every county in which it has been adopted; but to make it 
most effective, the following changes should be made in it: 
1. The State should make a liberal appropriation out of its 
treasury to encourage and assist the counties in establishing and 
maintaining high schools, as it makes appropriations to assist in 
maintaining elementary schools.. This is done in almost all other — 
States and countries that have public-school systems. The appro- 
priations for this purpose in other States and countries range from 
fifty thousand to many hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. 
2. The high schools should be more uniform in their work and 
standards and more closely connected with other parts of the 
school system. The Superintendent of Public Instruction and the 
Board of Education of the State should exercise a closer supervision 
over them. : 
3. There should be some clearer provision for the consolidation - 
of county and city schools and of county high schools with district 
secondary schools.

PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 
One of the most important measures to come before the next 
General Assembly of Tennessee will be the proposition made to 
the State by the Peabody Education Board. This measure should. 
receive the most favorable consideration. The Peabody Board in 
the past has dealt generously with Tennessee on education, and has 
spent in this State between the years 1875 and 1906 the enormous 
sum of $1,130,600. This amount was-used in the early days of 
our common-school system to aid in the establishment of city and 
graded. schools,.the training of teachers through teachers’ insti- 
tutes, and since 1875 in maintaining the Peabody Normal College 
at Nashville. In this college 5,527 Tennessee pupils have received - 
training, and nearly all of them have gone into the school work 
in this State. Graduates of the Peabody College are to-day presi- 
dents of colleges, of State Normal and industrial schools, professors 
in universities and colleges, superintendents of county and city 
schools, and principals and teachers of high schools. They are 
found all over the South. The influence they have exerted for the 
cause of education and the upbuilding of Tennessee and the South 
cannot be estimated. 
The proposed Peabody College for Teachers would, in my opin- 
ion, become the greatest educational institution in the South, and 
be to the Southern States, and especially to Tennessee, what the 
. New York Teachers’ College is to New York and the United 
States. The small investment of $250,000 would, under the prop- 
osition of the Peabody Board, guarantee an investment in Nash- 
ville for education of not less than $2,000,000. Surely as a busi- 
ness proposition the State should accept the offer. I believe this 
is qur great opportunity, and I sincerely trust that the people of 
Tennessee will show their appreciation for the splendid work that 
ex-Governor Porter has-done in securing this proposition for the 
State by giving it unqualified indorsement. The present situation 
can best be given in the following extract taken from a leading 
school journal: / 
“The Peabody Board, at a called meeting in Washington, in 
January, 1905, passed the following resolutions :
-P-A-G-E-38
—3i— 
“RESOLUTION OFFERED BY MR. MORGAN. 
“«*Wrerras, The question connected with the establishment of 
a Teachers’ College at Nashville, to bear the name of George Pea- 
body and to be a memorial to him, is now before this board; there- 
fore be it 
“Resolved, That the application of 1,00 000,000 of the capital of 
this trust be approved; and, further, 
“Resolved, That Messrs. Fenner, Gilman, Ported, Lawrence, 
and Courtenay be a committee to prepare and determine the terms 
and conditions upon which such application should be made, such 
terms and conditions to be reported to this board and to be adopted 
by them.’ 
“ These resolutions were passed unanimously under a ‘yea’ and 
‘nay’ vote; and thereupon the committee immediately reported 
the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted under 
a ‘yea’ and ‘nay’ vote: 
“*Waernas, This board recognizes that the establishment of a 
college for the higher education of teachers for the Southern State: 
is essential to the completion of an efficient educational system for 
said States and would be the noblest memorial to George Peabody ; 
“¢Wrereas, The board is of the opinion that said college should 
be located at Nashville, Tenn., and should be established as the 
successor of the Peabody Normal. College, already established by 
this board in said city, and for the purpose of continuing on broader 
and higher lines the great work which has been done by said Nor- 
mal College for the cause of Southern education ; : 
“<*WreEreas, This board is willing to appropriate the sum of 
$1,000,000 out of the funds under its control for the establish- 
ment of said college, provided it can secure from other sources fur- 
ther contributions of $800,000 in- money value for the purpose 
aforesaid ; 
' “ ¢Wirermas, The board is advised that the county of Davidson, 
Tenn., has authorized the issue of $50,000 in bonds, to be delivered 
to the board whenever it shall take proper action to locate per- 
manently in the city of Nashville the Peabody College for Teachers, 
and shall also endow said institution with not less than $1,000,000 .
-P-A-G-E-39
by appropriation from the funds under its control; and that the 
city of Nashville has authorized the issue of $200,000 of its bonds 
to be delivered to this board, subject to the same terms and condi- 
‘tions; and that the trustees of the University of Nashville have 
executed a conveyance to this board of land, buildings, appurte~ 
nances, ett., now occupied and used by the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege, subject to the same terms and conditions, which property is 
conservatively valued at not less than $250,000; and is further as- 
sured that the Legislature of the State of Tennessee will at its 
present session appropriate the sum of $250,000 to be delivered to 
this board, subject to the same terms and conditions; and 
“¢Wuereas, This board is assured that, in addition to the fore- 
going, an additional sum of $50,000, or its equivalent, will be raised 
from other sources and placed at the disposition of this board within 
one year from the present date, subject to the same terms and con- 
ditions; be it, therefore, 
“ ‘Resolved. (two-thirds of the members of the board concurring) , 
That if, within one year from this date, there shall be delivered to 
this board, or shall be placed at its disposition : 
“*(1) Bonds of the county of Davidson for $50,000; 
“*(2) Bonds of the city of Nashville for $200,000; 
““(3) The sum of $250,000 appropriated by the State of Ten- 
mnessee ; : . 
“<(4) Sixteen acres of land and the buildings and appurte- 
nances now occupied and used by the Peabody Normal College and 
conveyed by the trustees of the University of Nashville; and 
“*(5) The further sum of $50,000 in money, or its equivalent— 
“This board will immediately take proper action to establish 
in Nashville, Tenn., a college for the higher education of teachers 
for the Southern States, to be the successor of the present Peabody 
Normal College in said city, and to be known as the “ George Pea~ 
body College for Teachers,” and to be duly incorporated in said 
name under competent authority, and to be under the government 
of trustees to be named and appointed by this board and to have 
the power to. fill all vacancies which may occur on said board. 
“<And, further, that this board hereby pledges itself to appro- 
priate $1,000,000 out of the funds in its hands as a permanent
-P-A-G-E-40
—33— 
endowment of said college, said $1,000,000 to he-held as a perma- 
nent fund, only the income thereof to be applied to the mainte- 
nance of the institution. , 
“‘And, further, that as soon as the said “George Peabody Gol- 
lege for Teachers” shall duly incorporate, this board will imme- 
diately assign, set over, and deliver unto the said corporation, or its 
aforesaid trustees, the said sum of $1,000,000 of its funds, and also 
all other moneys, bonds, and property above referred to, which shall 
have been received or placed at the disposition of this board for 
said purpose, to be received and used by said trustees for the es- 
tablishment, maintenance, and development of the said “George 
Peabody College for Teachers” as an institution for the higher 
education of teachers for the Southern States.’ 
“This proposition was brought before the Legislature of Ten- 
nessee, which was then in session. The Legislature promptly 
voted the $250,000 asked of the State, making the appropriation 
in the form of a State certificate, to be paid in ten annual install- 
ments of $25,000 each. This was regarded by members of the Leg- 
islature, by the college, and by all members of the Peabody Board 
who were consulted in the matter as being altogether satisfactory. 
The remaining sum of $50,000 was raised in July, and it was 
thought that all the conditions had been fulfilled. Final action 
on the part of the Peabody Board was expected at its regular meet- 
ing in October. 
“At this meeting the legal committee reported favorably on the 
fulfillment of all the conditions except the appropriation by the 
State. On this point the committee reported that a State certificate 
to be paid in ten annual installments is not the equivalent of $250,- 
000, as called for by the board’s resolutions, and the Act making 
the appropriation was subject to repeal.. The board then voted to 
extend the time to July, 1907, in order to give the State an oppor- 
tunity to change the form of this appropriation so as to make the 
$250,000 available. 
“In the meantime interest in the proposition to establish at 
Nashville a central teachers’ college, with adequate permanent 
endowment, has grown. New friends have offered codperation. 
It is now proposed to raise a fund of $3,000,000 for the endowment
-P-A-G-E-41
—34— 
and equipment of the college. This second proposition, involving 
$1,200,000, is awaiting the action of the State of Tennessee and ° 
the Peabody Board in closing the original proposition, which in- 
volves $1,800,000. 
“When the Staté changes the form of its appropriation so as to 
make the whole amount of $250,000 available, the Peabody Board 
will have a called meeting to carry out its part of the obligation, 
and the whole movement for the adequate endowment of a great _ 
teachers’ college in Tennessee will go rapidly forward to its com- 
pletion.” 
THE Universrry OF TENNESSEE. 
It is with pleasure that I refer to the encouraging and excel- 
lent report made by the president of our State University. 
This institution, as the head of our public-school system, should 
"be the pride of every citizen of the State, and it should receive sub- 
stantial encouragement from our General Assembly. Until four 
years ago Tennessee was the only State in the Union that did not 
make appropriations direct from its treasury for the support of a 
State university. The General Assembly of 1903 appropriated 
$10,000 to buy additional lands for the Agricultural Department, 
_and the General Assembly of 1905 appropriated $25,000 to be used 
to assist in paying traveling expenses of students and to erect a 
new mechanical building. 
The great demand in Tennessee is for an institution that will 
prepare our boys to take part in the great industrial development 
of the South. Such an institution, in addition to furnishing the 
usual university education, must be well equipped with industrial, 
mechanical, engineering, and mining departments. These depart- 
ments must be sustained by the State Goverfiment; and the appro~ 
priation of $50,000 a year needed for this purpose would, in my 
opinion, be the best investment the State could make. 
ToLLerr Bi. 
The last Legislature passed the following Act amending the sur- 
plus Act of 1903:

Education in the distribution of the $50,000 provided for under 
the Tollett bill. 
It is important that all questions be correctly answered and the 
blank returned to your County Superintendent not later than-No- 
vember 20; otherwise your district cannot get the benefit of this 
distribution. Very truly yours, 
Seymour A. Mynpers, 
State Superintendent.

In addition to the above information, the County Superintend-

pared the reports of the district clerks with the reports in their 
office made from the Trustee’s books and found them correct. 
The State Board of Education met on December 20, 1905, and 
adopted the following regulations to govern the committee in sug- 
gesting the distribution of the $50,000 available under this Act on 
January 1, 1906: 
“1. The expense per month shall be fixed at the amount reported 
by each district clerk. 
“2. The special committee shall ascertain from each report how 
much would be necessary to increase the school term of each dis- 
trict to six months, provided the income were used only for ex- 
penses of the current year. 
“3. The special committee shall make.a recommendation as to

the distribution, using the facts above secured, but not so bound 
by these facts as to prevent the use of these funds for the purpose 
of stimulating local self-help and recognizing improvement in in- 
crease of taxation and other ways.” 
On December 29 the State Board made the following distribu- 
tion, based upon the. reports of district clerks as audited by the

  The reports from district clerks were unsatisfactory, as we found 
in many cases the clerks did not keep the accounts as required by 
law, and there is much carelessness in looking after their financial 
accounts. It must be remembered that under the provisions of the 
bill the above distribution is made to the school districts, and not 
to the county as a whole. : 
One of the original intentions of the Act was to encourage the 
counties to increase their local tax, and I am pleased to report that 
in this respect we have exceeded the most sanguine expectations 
of the friends of this measure. Before the passage of the Act there 
were but thirty-five counties levying as high as 25 cents on the $100 
in addition to the 15 cents levied by the State. There are now 
sixty counties levying this tax or higher. Many districts in the 
State that were formerly unable to run anything like an efficient 
school have built good schoolhouses and have fairly good schools 
running six months in the year. In my opinion, this is one of the _ 
most beneficial measures that has been passed by the Legislature 
in the history of our school system; and I recommend that such 
legislation be enacted as will insure more accurate reports from 
the district clerks and county officials, and that this appropriation 
be continued or increased. 
HistoricaL SKETCHES. 
Recognizing the necessity of placing in some permanent form 
the history of our school fund and system and of the different edu- 
cational institutions of the State, I have had prepared and publish
-P-A-G-E-49
—49— 
in this report, without expense to the State, a series of historical 
reports. Attention. is especially called to the excellent article by 
Mr. J. I. Finney on “The Progress and Development of the Ten- 
nessee Public School. System.” . Mr. Finney was furnished with 
such information as the department had and the annual reports 
of the State Superintendent. In addition to these articles, there 
will also be found sketches. of the State. Historical Society, the 
Peabody College, the Watkins Institute, and the University of 
Tennessee. These have all been prepared by men familiar with 
the history of these institutions. 
Conctusion, . 
In conclusion, I acknowledge my obligation to the teachers of the 
State for their undivided support during my administration, to 
the press of the State for the cordial codperation given me, and to 
you for your kindly sympathy and great help in all the efforts of 
this department to advance the public schools.

PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT OF TENNESSEE’S 
PUBLIC-SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
By James I. -Frvney. 
y 
\ Of the history of common schools in Tennessee prior to the es- 
tablishment of the present system in the State in 1873 it has been 
well said by Phelan, the historian, that “the history of the com- 
mon schools is, in the main, the history of public lands in Ten- 
nessee, ‘and the history of public lands in this State is the history 
of confusion. . More than three hundred Acts have been passed _ 
upon: subjects growing out of the relation between the public 
schools-and the school lands of the, State.” } 
4 Before ‘1852 no direct tax was levied by the State for the estab- 
lishment ‘or\maintenance of public schools in Tennessee. Until 
that time the aid given by the State for common schools consisted 
almost, if not entirely, of the donation of public lands or the pro- 
ceeds from the sale thereof. (‘The efforts of the State were directed 
toward the erection of a great public-school fund, the interest or 
revenue from which was designed to be the revenue for the com- 
mon schools, 
Until the year mentioned, the niore simple, direct, and satistac- 
tory method of supporting the educational interests by tax levy 
had never appealed successfully to any Legislature of the State. 
With the possible exception of the Act of 1867, of which more will 
be hereafter said, the school legislation in Tennessee until 1873 
can properly be characterized ag crude, inefficient, and in many 
instances positively detrimental to the very cause whose interests 
it was designed to promote.

Harty History.* 
Not that in the early days of the history of this Commonwealth 
the people were not impressed with the necessity for an educated 
. citizenship, for the contrary is true. The purpose of the laws en- 
acted in the interest of general education were, in the main, laud- 
_able; the spirit which the early settlers manifested with respect ~ 
to this subject was commendable; but there is apparent, from an 
inspection of the hundreds of Acts passed between the organization 
of the State and 1873, an almost utter lack of ability to secure prac- 
tical results. The best laws in-many instances proved a complete 
disappointment, and the schemes which on their face looked so 
inviting were frequently demonstrated to be wholly without merit. 
As stated, however, from the very earliest moment the settlers 
of this State realized the great importance of public education, 
and the legislation of both Tennessee and North Carolina bears 
witness to the truth of this statement. As early as 1783 the Leg- 
islature of North Carolina incorporated Martin Academy, in, Wash- 
ington County, which at that time embraced within its bounds 
the greater part of what is now tte State of Tennessee. 
This Act was followed two years later by one incorporating Da- 
vidson Academy, in Nashville. This institution was the germ’ of 
Cumberland College, establishéd in 1806, and became the Univer- 
sity of Nashville ia 1826. : 
Nine years after the establishment of Davidson Academy, in 
1794, Blount College, which is now the great University of Ten- 
nessee and the head of the public-school system of Tennessee, was 
established at Knoxville. In the same year Greeneville College, 
at Greeneville, was established. 
Two of the institutions above named, the University of Nash- 
ville and the University, of Tennessee, are really a part of the gen- 
eral public education. system of the State; and therefore, in com> 
piling the record of public schools in Tennessee, it is proper to

briefly outline the history of legislation in so far as it relates to 
State aid in behalf of these worthy institutions. : 
Compact oF 1806, 
The very complicated and not always very creditable history of 
public schools in ‘Tennessee may be said to have begun just a cen- 
tury ago, as the result of a compact to which the States of Ten- 
nessee and North Carolina and the United States Government were 
parties. The terms of this compact are expressed in the words 
of the Act of Congress of April 18, 1806. 
By this compact the United States, being the legal owner of 
these lands, subject to certain rights reserved by North Carolina, 
conveyed so much of them as lay north and east of a certain line 
‘to the State of Tennessee, under specified conditions. The line 
to which reference was made came afterwards to be known as the _ 
Congressional Reservation line. It began where the main branch 
of Elk River crosses the south line of Tennessee and ran dué north 
to the main branch of Duck River; thence down Duck River to 
an older line, known as the military line; thence west with the 
military line to the Tennessee River; thence down the Tennessee 
River to the north line of the State. This reservation, therefore, ~ 
included all of West Tennessee and a large area in Middle Tennes- 
see. The right to dispose of land in this jurisdiction was conceded 
by Tennessee to the general government. The lands outside of the 
reservation were conceded to the State upon certain conditions. 
The conditions annexed to the cession to the State of Tennessee 
were, in substance: 
That Tennessee should satisfy all North Carolina land claims 
out of the same. 
‘That it should appropriate 100,000 acres-in one tract south of. 
French Broad and Holston Rivers and west of Big Pigeon River, 
in East Tennessee, for the use of two colleges—one in Fast and 
the other in West Tennessee. At this time there were but two’ 
grand divisions of the State. . : 
That the State should appropriate 100,000 acres within the same 
limits for the use of academies, one to be érected in each county. 
That the State should locate throughout the ceded territory 640
-P-A-G-E-57
—4g— 
acres out of each six square miles, where existing claims would al- 
low it, which should be appropriated for the use of schools for the 
instruction of children forever. 
AcaDEMy Lanps, 
It was also provided that the college and academy lands should 
not be sold for less than $2 per acre, provided that where they were 
already occupied the occupants might perfect their rights at $1 
per acre. This proviso reduced the value of the cession to the 
schools very materially, because it was found afterwards that a 
very great part of the lands were occupied. The claims of the set-. 
tlers were generally respected, with the result that what appeared 
to be a very mimificent gift yielded less than half the revenue 
expected. : : 
The academy system is no longer in operation in this State; and 
as it was never really a part of the public-school system, no effort 
will be made here to trace the history of the academies. Many 
were at once established. The college and academy lands were set 
apart with a degree of promptness that was creditable to the legis- 
lators, but this act of good faith was but the prelude to many years 
of conflict and litigation in which good faith did not always emerge 
best in the struggle with demagegy. 
What ought to have been foreseen from the first soon developed. 
The academy and college lands were, in the main, located in a sec- 
tion which had already been in part settled. The settlers had 
contended against the savage; they had suffered every hardship 
known to frontier life; they had won their homes by incessant 
toil; and while it is doubtful if they had legal possession of the 
land, under the circumstances it was hardly to be expected that 
they would regard with favor the technical points of law which 
were asserted against them. Neither the highest sense of justice 
nor the most reverential regard for legal regularity can overcome 
the sentiment or sympathy for these hardy pioncers. Their claims 
were recognized -by the first Constitution of the State, public sen- 
timent was with them, and in a measure justice and right was -on 
their side: Neither the State nor the Federal Government had - 
helped them to conquer the savage. or settle the wilderness. Nat-
-P-A-G-E-58
—49— 
ural law was on their side. By their own unaided efforts they hads 
made their way in what but a few years before was a » trackless 
wilderness. 
It should have been seen from the first that it would never be 
possible to realize $200,000 from the college lands under the pro- 
viso in favor of the settlers. From the first effort to carry into 
effect the provisions of the compact effectual resistance on the part: 
of the settlers began. Occupation rights were confirmed upon con- 
dition of long payments, and the time was extended time and 
again. -The prices were lowered, interest was remitted, and the 
lands at last passed beyond the control of the State and of the 
schools. It was not until fourteen years after the compact that 
East Tennessee College was able to open its doors. : 
. GoveRNoR McMinn’s Mussacn. 
Conditions existing in 1821 are thus stated in the message of 
Governor McMinn to the Legislature: “We all know that 200,000 
acres of land south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers at 
the price of $1 per acre was appropriated to the establishment of 
and support of colleges and academies; but in what manner col- 
lections on the sale of those lands have been made and to what 
amount, how much of the principal or interest has been voluntarily 
or otherwise paid, or how much still remains due or to become 
due, is scarcely known to any individual within the State; and 
perhaps it would not be practicable for the Legislature to inform 
themselves satisfactorily on the various points connected with the 
subjects by reports drawn from any department of the govern- 
ment.” The advice of the Governor that the Legislature take 
steps to acquire full information on the subject was rejected by the 
House of Representatives. The whole matter has continued ina 
state of confusion from that date. 
In 1822 the State, by an Act of great generosity, atoned in a 
measure at least for its delinquency. In that year a compact was 
entered into between the State and the University of North Caro- 
lina to the effect that grants should be issued upon warrants of the 
university; that all lands owned or acquired by it in Tennessee 
should be exempt from taxation until 1850; that the university,
-P-A-G-E-59
—50— 
in turn, should transfer 60,000 acres of land warrants to public’ 
seminaries to be designated by the commissioners. This agree 
ment was carried out; and the commissioners designated Hast 
Tennessee College and Cumberland College as the recipients of the 
donation, the former receiving 20,000 and the latter 40,000 acres. 
The lands thus accruing to the colleges were laid off in the Con- 
gressional Reservation, and legislation enacted in 1825 had the 
effect of charging the colleges in part at least with these lands as 
payments under the compact of 1806. 
INTOLERABLE CONDITIONS. 
By 1829 the condition of affairs had become intolerable. The 
legislative conscience responded to the appeals of the colleges, and 
a proposition was made to the colleges to accept in settlement of 
the unpaid balances due them one-half township each of lands in 
East ‘Tennessee south of Hiwassee River to which the Indian title 
had not been extinguished, but which was extinguished six years 
later. The proposition was accepted by the colleges—not, how- 
ever, without great reluctance. 
In 1839 Hast Tennessee College derived from the sale of this 
half township which was in the Ocoee District the sum of $34,- 
927.29. Other specific sums known to have been received by the 
college under the two compacts or agreements were $5,000 in 1826 
and about $19,000 after 1842. These amounts aggregate about 
$60,000, and it is certain that they were not all. It seems reason- 
ably certain that something was received prior to the date of the 
first mentioned of these payments, but the exact amount will doubt- 
Jess never be known. 
On the whole, it seems certain that Hast Tennessee College must 
have received in the neighborhood of three-fourths of the amount 
to which it was entitled under the original compact of 1806, pro- 
vided the lands could all have been sold for $2 per acre, and about 
fifty per cent more than it would have received had the lands been 
sold for but $1 per acre. 
It is not certain that this college or Cumberland College received 
as large a sum as $75,000, but it was probably ‘not less than this 
amount. It is certain that the latter institution obtained $40,000
-P-A-G-E-60
51 a 
from its share of these land set apart under the agreement of 
1822; and as it received twice as much as East Tennessee College, 
there appears little room to doubt it secured as much money there- 
from as the East Tennessee institution. : 
Heap oF SysTEM. 
For the reason heretofore stated, that East Tennessee College, 
now the University of Tennessee, and Cumberland College, now 
the University of Nashville, are in fact the hedd-and an integral 
part of the common-school system of the State, the history of 
legislation conferring upon these institutions public aid has been 
traced. It may be added that the real estate of both institutions 
was selected wisely, and is now worth many times the amount re- , 
ceived originally from the State. 
Coming more properly to a consideration of the legislation cre- 
ating the common-school system, one encounters from the outset, 
a mass of confusion and enters a labyrinth of conflicting and very 
frequently wholly inefficient and unsatisfactory laws. It is from 
the first a scene of confusion from which it is exceedingly diffi- 
cult to reach correct conclusions. 
The Federal Government had set apart in the Northwest Terri- 
tory the sixteenth section of each township for the public schools, 
vesting the title thereto in the inhabitants thereof. The Cession 
Act of 1789 stipulated that the people of the ceded territory should 
_ enjoy all the privileges, benefits, and advantages set forth in the 
ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory, and this 
was accepted by Congress. 
The Supreme Court of Tennessee, in the case of Lowry vs. 
Francis, reported in 2 Yerg., 234, has declared that every promise 
set forth was a part of our contract with the United States, and 
that one of these was that schools and the means of education 
should be forever encouraged, not by words, but by useful means. 
It was pursuant to this part of the contract that the provision 
for common schools was inserted in the Act of Congress of 1806. 
By the terms of this Act, however, the title to the common-school 
lands was vested, not in the inhabitants of the several townships,
-P-A-G-E-61
as in the Northwest Territory, but in the State, in its corporate 
capacity, not to sell the lands, but to appropriate them and their 
rents, issues, and profits for the use of schools for the instruction 
of children forever. 
: Lanp OFFICE OPENED. 
The land office of the State was opened in 1807; and it became 
apparent soon thereafter that the provisions for the common schools, 
_while apparently munificent, were in fact inconsiderable and wholly 
inadequate for the maintenance of such a system of schools as 
would confer without cost to the people the benefits of education 
upon the children of all of the State’s inhabitants. © 
It must be borne in mind that the lands set apart for the schools 
were to be located when existing claims would allow. The im- 
mense area of the Congressional Reservation was not available, 
and was never made available. The lands lying north and east of 
the reservation were estimated at 16,000,000 acres; and if this 
land had been laid off in townships six miles square, the thirty- 
sixth part thereof, which was the amount set apart for the pro- — 
motion of education, would have been nearly one-half million of 
‘acres. But, except for a large area in the lower part of East 
Tennessee, these lands had been long open for settlement. 
As early as 1824 the people became dissatisfied with the pro- 
vision for the schools, and the Legislature made complaint to Con- 
gress. This complaint was accompanied by a statement summa- 
rized in a report made by James K. Polk, then a Representative | 
from this State in Congress. 
/ Report or James K. Poi. 
In this summary it was stated that of the 444,000 acres of land 
to which the schools were entitled, only about 22,700 acres had 
been laid off, and that the good lands were all occupied, and those 
that remained were worth on the average not exceeding 124 cents 
per acre. Therefore an appeal was made to Congress that the de- 
ficiency in the school lands be made good from the unoccupied 
lands of the Congressional Reservation. The appeal, although ad- 
mittedly of great merit, was made in vain, however, and Tennes- 
XY
-P-A-G-E-62
—53— 
see received no lands for the common schools except from the terri- 
tory not embraced in the Congressional Reservation. It is prob-. 
able that the common schools did ‘eventually receive more than 
the 22,700 acres mentioned; but there is. no direct proof of this 
- fact, and the most trustworthy and reliable authorities generally 
agree that the above included all of the lands received in the dis- 
tricts afterwards formed. ‘ 
That the earlier legislation of the State upon the subject of 
common schools was extremely crude and frequently ill-advised 
is abundantly evidenced by the Act of 1815, which provided for the 
education of the orphans of persons who had died in the service ‘of 
their country, describing them as those “ poor orphans who have no 
property to support and educate them.” 
While this was a humane and a charitable Act, it was most 
unwisely limited in its purposes, and, like certain similar enact- 
ments of later date, was of no appreciable benefit. It indicated 
an utter lack of appreciation of the obligation which the State 
owed its people to give all, without regard to their condition in 
life or their ability to otherwise procure it, a common-school edu- 
_ cation.. The recognition of this obligation is the very foundation 
stone of the splendid system which the State has established in 
more recent years and which at some day. in the not too far dis- 
tant future is surely destined to be the chief glory of the Com- 
monwealth, the common heritage of all her citizens, and the pride 
of posterity. Our carly legislators failed to appreciate what has 
long since been demonstrated as an incontrovertible fact—that 
common schools, in order to succeed and to perform the great mis- 
sion for which they were designed, must be open to and attract 
all classes of the State’s future citizenship. 
Tue Act or 1823. 
By Chapter 49 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1823 the 
first step toward the creation of a system of common schools in 
Tennessee was taken. By the terms of this’ Act offices for receiv- 
ing entries for vacant lands north and east of the Congressional 
Reservation line were established, the lands to be entered at 124 
, 4
-P-A-G-E-63
—54— 
cents per acre, and the money received to be paid by the entry 
takers every three months to the agents of the Bank of Tennes- 
see in all counties-except Davidson and Knox, where’ they were to 
be paid to the principal bank. These moneys were to be loaned 
at interest, and it was declared that the principal was to “remain 
and constitute a perpetual and exclusive fund for the establish- 
ment and promotion of common schools in each and every county 
in the State.” 
The taxes on these lands were ‘also to be a part of the public: 
school fund, to be kept separate by the tax collectors and be paid 
over by them to the bank or its agents, who were to make semi- 
annual distribution of interest and taxes among the school commis- 
sioners created by the same Act. Of these commissioners there 
were to be five for each county, electe sted_by tho County Court. 
' Thus far the Act was a wise one, but that lack of appreciation of 
the real purpose for which public schools are instituted was again 
demonstrated in the following provision: “That the said board of 
school commissioners shall appropriate all money by them received 
under the provisions of this’ Act to the education of the poor, either 
by establishing poor schools in their different counties | or by pay- 
ing the tuition of poor children.” 
Thus again did the Legislature, by the unfortunate and unneces- 
sary use of the word “ poor,” limit the usefulness of the schools, 
and at the very outset tended to discourage, rather than encourage, 
the patronage of the common schools by the people of all classes, 
without which they can never serve the high purpose for which’ 
they are maintained by the State. The State cannot afford to 
encourage or by law recognize class distinction any more in the 
educational system than it can in any other function of govern- 
ment. To do so is not only to place unwise and dangerous lim- 
itations on the system, but to create a class prejudice that will 
cause the more fortunate of its citizenship to frown upon and view 
with contempt those who receive the State’s bounty. 
Lack or PERCEPTION. 
Tt was not’ conceived ‘in the beginning or in this and some of 
the subsequent Acts upon this subject that the paramount duty
-P-A-G-E-64
—5a 
of a.free people is to provide that means of education for its future 
citizenship that will fit them and all of them for the responsibilities 
which await them in directing the affairs of the Commonwealth. 
It will be generally admitted that an uneducated, an illiterate, and 
an ignorant people are wholly unfitted for self-government. Class 
distinctions are likewise dangerous to free government. Hence the 
State that by practice or by solemn enactment encourages a class 
feeling or prejudice among its children can hardly expect to view 
with satisfaction the results to follow therefrom. 
Happily, the lawmakers who came after those of the early days 
saw the great mistake that had been made; they profited by the 
errors of the past; experience taught them the necessity for open- 
ing the common schools to all alike; they realized the importance 
of giving to all the State’s citizens an education that would fit 
them for that high and responsible station, with the result that 
to-day Tennessee stands right on the threshold of that glorious 
dawning when every child of the Commonwealth, whether born in 
a hut or in a palace, whether the child of poverty or of luxury, 
may receive without cost and upon a common plane the benefits 
of education, and thereby fit himself for citizenship in the greatest 
nation of free people that the world has ever seen. 
It would probably not be profitable to refer in harsh terms to the 
mistakes of the past but for the reason that the wise always profit 
by mistakes; they are taught by the lamp of experience and get 
wisdom from the errors of those who were less fortunate or less 
capable than they. In an outline of school history and- school. 
progress in Tennessee such as this paper is intended to be it is also 
necessary that reasons be plainly presented for the failure of the 
school system to attain that degree of popularity and receive that 
support from the people without which its progress was impossi- 
ble. By constant reference to the mistakes made in the early days 
of the State’s legislation upon this most important of all subjects 
and by diligently seeking to keep clear of the breakers that then 
threatened the development of the cémmon schools can the con- 
tinued and full success of the system. be assured.

Served Goon Purpose. 
This Act of 1825, harshly, however, as it has been criticised, did 
not fail to serve a good purpose after all. It helped to create that 
very sentiment which in after years brought the schools to their 
present high standard. { The people were not satisfied with the 
establishment of pauper schools, and gave expression to this senti- 
ment in an Act passed by the Legislature of 1827. By the terms 
of this Act the following sums were appropriated for the use of the 
schools forever: ; : 
All the capital of the recently organized State Bank, except one- 
half of the sum already received and the interest on the capital, 
which was a million dollars in bills emitted on the credit and se- 
curity of borrowers, guaranteed by the State on the proceeds of its 
unappropriated lands. 
The proceeds of the sales of the lands in the Hiawasse District. 
All the lands previously appropriated in the State to the use of 
schools. 
All the unappropriated land in the State to which the State then 
“had or thereafter should have title. : 
All rents and mesne profits of school lands accrued and not ap- 
propriated. 
All school funds under the Act of 1823 not already otherwise 
" disposed of. 
In addition, a number of small gifts made to the State, all gifts 
that might thereafter be made to the State except for some other 
specific purpose, and all lands escheated to the State were by the 
terms of this Act set apart for the common schools. 
This Act was defective, however, in that it failed to provide for 
the carrying of the same into execution by making any provision 
for the application of the fund sought to be created. In 1829 an 
effort was made to cure this defect and to complete the system.’ _ 
CREATION OF SYSTEM. 
\This Act of 1827 really created the public-school system of Ten* 
nessee, just as the Act of two years previous had created the public- 
_ school fund.) The system was .at the best, however, cumbersome;
-P-A-G-E-66
—37— 
the machinery designed to carry the law into execution was clumsy, 
ponderous, and unnecessarily burdensome and complicated. 
This Act provided, in substance, that the County Courts should 
at their first sessions after January 1, 1830, and annually there- 
after, appoint a commissioner in each captain’s company, and that 
these commissioners should on the third Saturday in April, 1830, 
_meet at the regimental muster ground and divide the regiment into 
five districts. For each of these districts the people thereof “were 
to elect five trustees to hold office for one year. The trustees so 
elected were to meet and elect a board of school commissioners 
for the county, to consist of not less than five nor more than seven , 
members; and these, in turn, were to choose a chairman for the _ 
county. ‘The proceeds of the school fund derived under previous 
legislation were to be paid annually by the officers of the Bank of 
Tennessee to the trustees, and by them equitably apportioned among ... 
the districts. 
Let those who criticise the present admittedly unsatisfactory Sy5- 
tem of administering the school interests and expending the school 
funds of a majority of the counties ponder over the provisions of 
_ this Act of 1829 before making the assertion that some uninformed 
are given to expressing that there has been no progress in school” 
management in Tennessee. Bad and imperfect as our system of 
school management is, it looks like the sum of' all human intelli- 
gence and bears the mark of the highest order of statecraft in com- 
parison with the first system inaugurated seventy-five years ago. 
F FREE Books PRovIDED. 
At least in one respect, however, our fathers were more charitable 
and more solicitous of the interests of the poor and unfortunate 
_than we have been. In one section of this Act it was provided that 
$20 might be expended annually in each county for the purchase 
of books and writing material for the children of such parents as 
were too poor to buy the same. But here again was manifested 
that idea which seems to have been engrafted more or less dis- 
tinctly upon the system from. the earliest legislation, that the 
common schools were primarily intended as the poor man’s school. 
Out of these enactments there grew into the minds of the people
-P-A-G-E-67
—58— 
of the State a prejudice against the State-supported schools that 
did not wholly disappear until years after the late War between’ 
the States in many sections of Tennessee. For years there was a 
large element of the State’s population who scorned to send their 
children to public schools lest they be classed among the poor and 
otherwise unfortunate who were forced to become beneficiaries of 
the State’s charity. . 
‘TYiere are citizens of the State yet living who declare that “they 
would have remained forever away from school rather than be- 
come a pupil at the public schools. Happily, these very people now 
are among the first to point the finger of pride toward our public-_ 
school system and to not a few of them is due the progress and 
development of the system, until now it is esteemed an honor and 
a privilege to attend the best school in the world, the common 
school—the school that knows no class distinction—where the child 
of wealth and the little urchin of poverty’s vale mingle on equal 
plane on the playground or contest on terms of perfect equality 
for. the academic honors. Ke 
Epvucatep CITizENSHIP. 
If this nation is to survive, if it is to meét and overcome the 
perils which have beset all the democracies of the past, it must have 
a patriotic, educated citizenship—a citizenship taught to love lib- 
_ erty and venerate the flag and what it represents, that will honor 
and glorify the-country’s history. There is no place where such 
a citizenship can be prepared except in the common school—the 
school where all children are taught to be commoners and are 
taught those priceless truths enunciated by the fathers, that “all 
men are created equal” and that “all just powers of government 
are derived from the consent of the governed.” 
Imperfect and inefficient as-was much of our school legislation of 
the past, it was not wholly without merit; on the contrary, not- 
‘withstanding the just criticism of the Act of 1829 creating the sys- 
tem, it was not a bad beginning and was a long step forward, far 
ahead of any previous law upon the subject. But the plan proved 
too cumbersome and the machinery for its execution too ponder- 
ous, and was carried into execution only in a limited number of
-P-A-G-E-68
—59— 
counties, in some of which, however, the schools proved. to be 
fairly efficient. 
Tn 1831 the profits of the State’s stock in the Union Bank of 
Tennessee were set apart for the use of the common schools; and 
when the Planters’ Bank, of Memphis, was organized in 1833, one- 
half of one per cent of its capital stock, payable annually to the 
State, was likewise appropriated ; and a similar disposition was 
made of a bonus of five per cent payable annually by the Tennessee 
Fire and Marine Insurance. Company on its net profits. -After- 
wards in the same manner other banks and insurance companies 
were required to contribute to the support of the schools. 
CONSTITUTION gr 1834, 
This legislation indicates the state of the school fund at the time 
of the adoption of the Constitution of 1834, By that instrument 
the purpose of the Act of 1827 was made effective by a provision 
which declared that the school fund, together with any increase 
thereof, should remain a perpetual fund for the use of common 
schools, the principal of which should never be diminished by 
legislative appropriation and’ the interest of which should be-“ 
violably appropriated ” to the encouragement and support of com- 
mon schools. 
_ Some interesting information touching the state of the school 
fund at this date (1834) is furnished by the report of a committee 
appointed by the Constitutional Convention. This report stated 
that of the capital of the Bank of Tennessee there had been ap- 
-.propriated to the use of common schools up to that time the amount 
of $455,133.33; and it was calculated that the schools would de- 
rive from the Union Bank during its life, or down to 1863, about 
$720,000; from the Planters’ Bank during the same period, $270,- 
000. . 
This report also stated that the school commissioners of seven 
counties had invested the funds received by them in the stock of 
the Union Bank, three in turnpike stock companies, and that the 
others had loaned their funds at interest to individuals upon per- 
sonal security. ‘The committee very properly characterized these 
last investments as exceedingly precarious, and advised a revision of
-P-A-G-E-69
—60— 
the method of managing school funds, and, therefore, suggested. 
the constitutional provision referred to above, and which is sub- 
stantially incorporated in the Constitution of 1870. 
OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT. 
The report of the committee and the action of the convention ap- 
pears to have borne fruit at an early day, for in 1836 an Act car- 
ried out the constitutional intent of recalling the school fund from 
all other custodians and giving control of it to the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction or some authorized agent of the board of 
common school commissioners. This Act created the office of 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and for the f. 
the public-school system really took form and had a responsi 
and manager. It was provided that this official was to b: 
by joint ballot of the two Houses of the General Assemlny, anu, 
with the Comptroller and’ the Treasurer, was to constitute the 
. “Board of Commissioners of Common Schools for the State of 
Tennessee.” The Superintendent’s term was made two years and 
his salary fixed at $1,500 per annum. Owing, however, to the 
various sources of income for the public schools, the close relations 
between the schools and the banks of the State, the Superintendent 
was more of a bookkeeper and financial agent than a Superintend- 
ent of Schools as we understand the duties and responsibilities of 
that officer to-day. 
OFFICE ABOLISHED. 
In. 1844 the office of State Superintendent was abolished, and . 
from that date to 1867 the duties of this office were performed by 
the State Treasurer as ex-officio Superintendent—further evidence 
that the Legislature of the early days of the State did not realize 
the full importance of the public-school system. In 1867 the of- 
fice was again established, to be filled by popular election; but this 
Act was repealed in 1870, and the State Treasurer was again made 
ex-officio Superintendent of Public Instruction.. By the Act of 
1878, reorganizing the public-school system and really inaugurating 
the system as it exists to-day, the office was once again created and 
the Superintendent appointed by the Governor. This Act is in
-P-A-G-E-70
—6bi— 
- force to-day. However, the powers, duties, and responsibilities of 
- the State Superintendent have been increased by various subse- 
quent legislation; and the office by general consent is to-day con- 
sidered one of the most important, if it is not really the most im- 
portant, in the State. 
An Act was passed in February, 1836, requiring the Superin- 
tendent to prepare plans for the organization of a system of free 
schools. More definite and comprehensive instructions to the same 
effect were outlined in an Act passed two years later. . 
Scoot System Onaanizp. 
Now, under the powers conferred and duties imposed: by. these 
~ two Acts, the State Superintendent in J uly 1838,-took. necessary 
steps to organize a system of free, _ schools, Tt is really from this — 
date that the history of common schools in Tennessee as a definite 
and intelligent system begins. By the end of. the following year, 
according to Goodpasture’s “History of Tennessee,” 911 of the 
987 school districts of the State had chosen trustees, and at major- 
ity of them had opened schools. From the same authority it is 
learned that the first apportionment of school funds under this 
arrangement was made in 1839. The scholastic population was 
"185,432, and the per capita apportionment was 624 cents—not a 
bad beginning, all things considered. By the Act of 1838 the jus- 
tices’ districts, now called the “civil districts,’ were made the 
school districts for the time. With but a few exceptions, this plan 
of making the civil district the school unit of administration was 
restored in all the counties by the Act of 1903, and is in force 
to-day. 
As early as 1837 “it was ouggested that the people tax themselves ¢ 
for the support ‘of the common schodls. Two years later a com- 
_ mittee of the Legislature again- made this recommendation, and 
the school system then in vogue was condemned in the: severest 
terms. 
The first experiment with a Superintendent proved very disas- 
trous. The practically unlimited discretion as to the investment ~ 
of funds which this official possessed was greatly abused, and seri- 
ous losses followed extended litigation. It was doubtless because
-P-A-G-E-71
—62— 
"of these losses and the abuses of the powers vested in that officer 
that the office was abolished and the duties conferred on the Treas- 
urer. 
For Locan Taxation. 
One of the striking features of the message of Gov. Neil 8. 
Brown to the General Assembly of 1847 was a strong recommen- 
dation. in favor of local taxation for the maintenance of the com- 
mon schools, but the Legislature took no action to carry this very 
wise suggestion into effect. 
From the Comptroller’s reports it is learned that the amount 
appropriated to the common schools for the year ending October 
1, 1837, was $17,705.26; for the next two years it was $113,926; _ 
and for the two years ending October 1, 1841, it was $191,576.82. 
. 4. On February 28, 1854, the Legislature passed the first Tennes- 
“ee Act for the levying of a direct tax for the support of the com- 
on schools. This was probably the most important Act on jhe 
subject of education passed by the Legislature prior to the War 
between the States. It really marks the beginning of the present 
method of sustaining the schools. After all, it is the only plan 
by which sufficient funds can be obtained for the maintenance of 
’ the schools and long enough at a time to be of real value to the © 
children; and at the same time the plan of direct taxation brings 
the school more closely in touch with the people than the method 
of supporting them by the revenues from a great fund, even were 
the latter sufficient for the purpose. Where the taxpayers con- 
tribute directly and annually to a definite purpose, they are likely 
to take that interest in and exercise that supervision over the object 
of their contributions that they would not under the plan originally. 
provided. 
The average citizen feels a livelier personal interest in that de- 
partment of the government to which he makes the most direct 
contribution. It is the same way in the lesser affairs of life. The 
benefactor of a charity will be more concerned about the welfare 
and prosperity of the institution which receives his charity than 
those who have never contributed a cent toward its maintenance, 
although the latter may be the indirect beneficiaries of the gift. :

First Tax Levy. 
This Act of 1852, which every student of school legislation and 
school administration in Tennessee must ever regard as one of the 
most, if not the most, important advance steps in the history of _ 
school legislation in the State, provided for a tax of 25 cents on 
polls and 24 cents on the taxable property of the State; and, in 
addition, the County Courts were authorized to ny ole a 
tax for the same purpose. The assent of two-thirds of the court 
was required; or if this could not be obtained, a popular election 
might be called and the question decided by a majority vote. 
The following provisions of the Code of 1858 will give the sub- 
stance of the school legislation in Tennessee as it existed just prior 
to the War of 1861-65. It was provided that the common-school 
fund should remain in the Bank of Tennessee, where it was by 
law invested. The fund at that time was declared to consist of 
$1,500,000 deposited in the bank, for which a certificate was held 
by the Treasurer as State Superintendent; of property given by 
will or deed to the schools; of the proceeds of sales or rents of © 
escheated lands or lands bought in for taxes; and of the personal 
effects of intestates leaving no kindred entitled by law to réceive the 
same. . / 
The annual fund for distribution among the schools was thus 
described by the Code of 1858: $100,000 dividend of the Bank of 
Tennessee to common schools and- $18,000 to academies; bonuses 
of banks and dividends of other corporations; moneys derived from 
privileges, specific taxes, fines, and penalties for school purposes; 
and $2,000 annually paid by the State in lieu of certain taxes on 
lands paid the school fund. All of the funds above enumerated, 
together with the tax of 20 cents on polls, 24 cents on the $100 of 
property, $100,000 appropriated out of the treasury, and one-fourth 
of the annual State tax received from privileges, were annually to 
be- distributed to the counties according to scholastic population. 
Xx Ixcorroratep Towns. 
The Code authorized incorporated towns to levy a school tax 
not exceeding the State tax when a majority of the qualified voters
-P-A-G-E-73
should so decide. By. the Code it was made the duty of the Gen- 
eral Assembly to appoint a board of commissioners for such time 
as they might think proper, -who should have general superintend- 
ence of the school fund. By a subsequent section it was provided. 
that the president and directors of the Bank of Tennessee were 
to constitute the board of commissioners. The civil districts con- 
tinued to be the unit of school administration, but the County 
Courts by two-thirds vote were authorized to lay off districts at 
their discretion. All children from the ages of six and twenty- 
one were to have the advantages of the free schools—a provision 
that was changed, but is now the law. 
While the system as here outlined lacked very much of being a 
perfect one and the funds provided were inadequate for the main- 
tenance of such a system as was doubtless intended, at the same 
time it was a great improvement over any previous plan, and was 
the very highest evidence that the people of that period recognized. 
the importance and value of public education. Along with this 
- recognition of the inestimable benefits to be derived from general 
education there went, however, that prejudice against the common 
- schools which had been nurtured and fostered by the unfortunate 
limitations imposed upon the system in the earlier Acts of the 
Legislature and- to. which more extended reference has heretofore 
been made. 
Like everything else—government, churches, and charities— 
during the great War between the States, the school system of 
Tennessee was completely disorganized. The Bank of Tennessee, 
which held the “sacred”? school fund, fled before the advancing 
hosts of the invading army, and did not return to the State until 
after peace had been once again restored in the land. 
Bank IN LigumDATION. 
. February, 1866, the reconstruction Legislature passed an Act 
lace the Bank of Tennessee in liquidation, by the terms of 
th the directors were required to execute a deed of trust. or 
assignnient, which, among other things, was to prefer the school 
fund. This Act provided in express terms that no creditor of the
-P-A-G-E-74
—65— 
bank, except persons having special deposits, was to receive any- 
thing until the entire school fund chargeable to the bank, together 
with interest from May 16, 1861, should have been paid. , 
As would naturally be expected, this Act was vigorously at- 
tacked in the courts of the State by depositors, who took the posi- 
tion they were to be preferred to the stockholders—a doctrine of — 
law that has doubtless never been seriously controverted by any 
competent court in the history of the English-speaking people. 
This view was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State in 
the cage of State and Watson, Trustee, vs. the Bank of Tennessee, 
reported in 5 Baxter, 1. The court held that when the common- 
school fund was placed in the bank to constitute a part of the cap- 
ital, it became assets of the bank, to which creditors had a right to 
look for the payment of their debts. The Act of 1866 was, there-. 
fore, invalid so far as it sought to give preference to the achool 
fund. From this decision it resulted, as has well been said by a 
distinguished constitutional lawyer and historian of Tennessee, 
that “the school fund. became and remains an indisputable but 
commendable and salutary Jegal fiction.” 
ct of March 5, 1867, steps were taken by the General Assem- 
the reorganization, supervision, and maintenance of com- 
thools.' This’ law was one of the best, wisest, and ablest - 
of legislation on the subject of the common schools that has 
corned the statute books of Tennessee. It is refreshing to 
king through the statute books madg at a time when passion. 
auu uate ruled the State to find so well-considered and wholesome 
a measure as this upon the most vital question of public educa- 
tion. Whatever may be said in condemnation of the reconstruction 
Legislature (and upon many grounds the Acts of that unfortunate 
period cannot be too severely criticised), the General Assembly of - 
1867 has to its credit what the writer believes on the whole to be 
the best. piece of practical school legislation ever ‘Placed on the 
statute books of Tennessee. 
’ 
PLAN OF SUPERVISION. 
First, this Act wisely provided"for State and county supervision 
of the educational system; it also provided for district directors.
-P-A-G-E-75
—66— 
In substance, the plan of supervision outlined herein was carried 
into the Act of 1873, from which the present system dates. The 
State Superintendent was to be elected by vote of the people; the 
district directors, by vote of the districts; and the directors were 
required to assemble and elect the County Superintendent. This 
was as good as, if not an improvement on, the present method of 
electing these officials by the County Court. 
The Act provided for a tax levy of 2 mills on the dollar for 
the support of-the schools, and, in addition, a tax of 25 cents on 
each poll. It also contained this section: “After June 30, 1867, 
every railroad company chartered by or having the right of way 
in this State shall collect’ and pay into the treasury of the State 
“ quarterly one-fourth of 1 cent per mile upon each and every pay- 
ing passenger transported by said company.” 
This fund was to be apportioned by the Comptroller among the 
several counties according to scholastic population. Both white 
and black children were to share in the benefits of the law, but 
they were to be taught in separate schools. This latter is an in- 
teresting provision of the law, passed as it was by those who had 
helped to disfranchise the white Confederate soldiers and to en- 
franchise the ignorant negroes, but recently slaves of the former. 
It was the intention of the fathers of this legislation that there 
should be five months’ school in every district of the State; and a 
provision was inserted to the effect that in the event the fund for 
any district was insufficient for this purpose an election might 
be held, and, upon vote of the majority, a special tax to make good 
the deficiency might be levied. ‘The courts held the latter Provi- 
sion to be unconstitutional. 
Act or 1867 REpEatep. 
This Act of 1867 was elaborately amended, and as amended 
constitutes probably the best devised system of free schools ever™ 
provided for the people of Tennessee. Unfortunately, before the 
Act could be carried well into execution it was repealed. While 
all credit must be given to the Radical Legislature for the enact- 
ment of the laws of 1867 and 1868, that party must likewise share
-P-A-G-E-76
—67— 
in part at least the blame for their repeal. It is probable, however, 
that the fact that the laws mentioned were passed under reconstruc- 
tion régime was at least in part responsible for their repeal. 
The law of 1870 which took the place of the Acts of 1867 and 
1868 was in every respect inferior. This Act is best described in 
the language of John M. Fleming, afterwards State Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction. Quoting from his report of 1875: 
“The-school law of 1867 was supplanted by that of 1870, which 
virtually remitted the whole subject of popular education to the 
several counties without imposing any obligation on them to take 
action in the premises. All State taxes levied upon property for 
school purposes were repealed and a tax retained upon polls of only 
50 cents. The law of 1870 was not inspired by hostility to the 
publie schools, but was manifestly believed to Be the best that the 
temper of the public mind and the disordered financial condition 
of the State would then admit.” 
But the Act of 1870 is not to be so lightly excused. After the 
experience of over half a century in dealing with that important 
subject, after having the advantage of the wise and sagacious pol- 
icy displayed by the Radical Legislature of 1867, this Act of 1870 
may well be characterized the most inexcusably unwise and vicious 
law on the subject ever passed in Tennessee. The legislators de- 
liberately voted for a law providing a plan which past experience 
had shown to be an utter failure. That it failed wholly to serve 
any good purpose is abundantly evidenced by the report of Assist- 
‘ant Superintendent Killebrew submitted three years after its enact- 
ment. Of this report more extended notice will be hereafter take 
J . AoT oF 1873. 
— As before stated, the present system of school administration in 
Tennessee dates from the Act of 1873. It was not until that date 
that Tennessee really had a system of public education that guar- 
anteed to all of the children of the school ages prescribed. some 
educational advantages. It marked the beginning of a ~plan that 
within the next year will guarantee to every child of the 
matter whether he or she may live in the centers of civilidgtion    
-P-A-G-E-77
—68— 
or in the most remote corners of the State, the advantage of six 
months’ free school every year. 
This Act provided that the schools should be administered by a 
State Superintendent, County: Superintendent, and district direc- 
tors. The Act was entitled “An Act to establish and maintain a 
uniform system of public schools.” Experience has demonstrated 
that the Act was capable of serving the purposes for which it was 
designed: 
The following provision was inserted in the Constitution of 
1870: “The fund called the ‘common-school fund’ and all the 
lands and proceeds thereof, dividend stocks, and other property of 
every description whatsoever heretofore by law appropriated, shall 
remain a perpetual: fund, and shall not be'diminished. The State 
taxes derived fromthe polls shall be appropriated to educational 
purposes.” 
"The vexed question of the amount of the school fund was for- 
ever set at rest and removed from political discussion by the pro- 
vision of the Act of 1873, which declared that it should be: “ The 
$1,500,000 ascertained and declared by the Code of 1858 and rec- 
ognized by the Constitution of the State to be the permanent school . 
fund. To this shall be added the interest which has accrued on 
the same and not paid by. the State, amounting on January 1, 
1873, to the sum of $1,012,500, making the entire permanent 
school fund $2,512,500.” For this amount a certificate was issued 
by the Governor providing for the payment thereon of 6 per cent 
interest per annum. To this fund was added substantially the - 
items heretofore set out in the Code of 1858. 
Prrmanunt Scwoon Funp. 
Regardless of the merits of the controversy concerning the dis- 
appearance of the school fund, by this Act of the Legislature full 
justice has been done the schools, and no child will lose the ben- 
efits of one dollar of the revenue from the fund lost as a result 
of the war and the failure of the Bank of Tennessee. The fund, 
although an imaginary one, is so hedged about with legal and con- 
stitutional safeguards that the schools of the State are forever
-P-A-G-E-78
—69— 
guaranteed the benefits of the revenue thereon, much more securely 
evidenced than even when the fund formed a part of the capital 
stock of the Bank of Tennessee. 
By the. Act of 1873 a school tax of 10 cents on the $100 was also 
levied. This tax in 1887 was raised to 15 cents, the amount now 
levied. It was also provided in this Act that where the funds 
furnished by the State were insufficient to maintain the schools in 
any county for five months the County Courts were authorized 
to levy additional taxes. This provision virtually authorized every — 
county in the State to make the levy. County Superintendents 
were to be elected by the County Courts and disttict directors by 
popular vote of their constituencies. These provisions are un- 
changed. : — : 
Imperfect as the system is, despite the many improvements made 
by subsequent legislation, it is the only real system the State has 
ever had; and under it conditions have improved so rapidly in ° 
thirty-three years that to-day the average term is six months, the 
average school levy more than three times that of 1873, the school 
enrollment greater than the scholastic. population of 1873, and 
there is not a district in the State which does not have a school 
taught every year. That there is room for greater improvement, : 
no one will doubt or controvert; but when one compares present 
conditions with those of thirty years ago, considers the difficulties 
that have been encountered, the unequal struggle of a people just 
emerged from the most devastating war of modern times, with poy- 
erty and with the new problems which that war evolved, Tennessee’s 
record in educational advancement and progress is one that should 
cause every patriotic son of the old “ Volunteer State” to swell 
with pride and to look the future in the face with confidence that 
. the day is not long off when our means and methods for common- 
school education will be second to that of no other State of the 
Union and when our citizenship will be as well educated as that of 
Massachusetts. 
ACHIEVEMENTS o¥ THIRTY YEARS. 
Let those critics who are given to discounting the advantages — 
of our system and who affect to doubt the progress that has been
-P-A-G-E-79
—T0— 
made in the past thirty years read the story of conditions that 
existed in Tennessee in 1873 and then ask themselves if Tennessee 
has not just cause for pride in the achievements made in’ educa- 
tional endeavor. : 
The conditions which obtained in this. State in 1873 are best 
described in the very able and comprehensive report of J. B, Kille- 
brew, at that time Assistant Superintendent. Commenting on the 
prevalence of illiteracy in the State, this report states: : 
“From advance sheets of the ninth census it appears that the 
number of illiterate persons in the State of Tennessee, adults and 
minors ten years old and over, is 364,668, of whom 138,955 are 
between the ages of ten and twenty-one years; the remainder - 
(225,713), twenty-one years old and over. Of the adults there 
are of white males, 37,713; colored, 55,92%-—ageregating 93,640 . 
male adults unable to read and write, and yet whose votes are as 
potential for good or evil as those of the wisest men in the State. 
The total vote cast at the last gubernatorial election was 120,479, 
and yet ignorance had the power of casting 93,640 of them. The 
bare statement of these facts is alarming. It shows upon what a 
precarious and unstable foundation the highest interests of our 
State rest. 
. CoNnDITIONS IN 1873. 
” “But it is for the children that we feel the deepest solicitude. 
There are 72,189 white children between the ages of ten and 
twenty-one who can neither read nor write, and 66,766 colored. 
It may safely be assumed that a large proportion of the white chil- 
dren have been made orphans by the war. Their natural pro- 
tectors have laid down their lives in the defense, as they honestly 
believed and felt, of the rights of property. Shall property now . 
hesitate to educate these children and make them useful members 
of that society which the valor of their fathers illustrated and’: 
defended? Whatever may be said of others, these orphans at least 
- should be liberally educated by the property of the State. 
“There is another lamentable fact deducible from the census of 
1870. It is that while the white population has increased but 13 
per cent, the increase in the number of white illiterates has been
-P-A-G-E-80
—T1— 
50 per cent. The white population has increased from 826,722 to 
936,119. The number of illiterates among the adults has increased 
from 71,114 to 106,538. And this illiteracy is to-day increasing 
at a greater rate. Ten years without schools and the necessity 
which has compelled many of the white people to perform manual 
labor has not served to intensify their desire for education. There 
have been fewer schools in the rural districts during the last decade 
than was ever known in the State in proportion to population. 
The policy pursued by the State has been, in the main, detri- 
mental to the cause of education. Public schools are unpopular 
becatise they have been, with few exceptions, totally inefficient. 
The constant changes which have been wrought in our school sys- 
tems by nearly every legislative body that has met have created 
in the public mind a sense of their inconstancy, inability, and 
inefficiency. They have not only failed to supply a much-felt ne- 
cessity in every community, but, with the parsimonious appropri- 
ations, have just been sufficient to interfere with and in a meas- 
ure break down all private enterprises. The amounts distributed 
to each county have heen totally inadequate to accomplish any good. 
ALARMING SITUATION. 
“The commissioners in many cases, to relieve themselves of any . 
responsibility, would employ a few peripatetic teachers, wholly unfit 
oftentimes for the duties devolving upon them, and suffer them to 
teach until the funds were exhausted, when the announcement 
would be made that the schools would be suspended until the fol- 
lowing year, when they would be resumed for one or two months 
more.” 
No wonder Professor Killebrew was alarmed at these conditions. 
Think of it—out of a white population of less than a million there 
were nearly 75,000 white children over the age of ten years who 
could neither read nor write! Illiteracy among the whites increas- 
ing at the rate of 50 per cent a decade! 
Consider these conditions, then study the returns for 1906, and 
let the reader ask himself if he does not feel like thanking Provi- 
dence for the wisdom and the patriotism that have characterized 
the enactment and the execution of laws on the subject of educa-
-P-A-G-E-81
—19-— 
tion during the past thirty years. Then Tennessee was second in 
illiteracy. At the next census it is confidently believed that her 
per cent of illiteracy will.be less than that of any Southern State 
and the per cent of white illiteracy among those between the ages 
of ten and twenty years will compare favorably with the record of 
the oldest and wealthiest Commonwealths of the nation. 
Touching conditions as they existed a year later than the date 
of the report from which the foregoing excerpts have been taken, 
Assistant Superintendent Killebrew said in his report to the 
Thirty-eighth General Assembly, which was the first hopeful and 
confident note that had been sounded in regard to public educa- 
tion in more than a decade: 
CHANGE OF SENTIMENT. 
“A great change has taken place in the public mind in regard to 
schools in thie last twelve months. Even the politicians, who float 
on the surface of public opinion and ride into office, not by personal 
merit, but by pandering to public sympathy, are outspoken in their 
advocacy.of public schools and are manifesting a decided interest 
in the matter. These barometers of public opinion indicate an 
earnest desire by the great mass of people for a complete and thor- 
ough system of public schools. Such a system as will furnish 
ample elementary educational facilities to every class in the State, 
and one in which the rich as well as the poor will feel an honest 
pride and be worthy of their support and confidence, is earnestly 
demanded. 
“The nioney heretofore appropriated by the State for the main- 
tenance of public schools has been worse than thrown away. Not 
only has it been insufficient, not only has it not educated any one, 
but it has been in the way of private enterprises, impeded the cause 
of education, detracted from the respectability of public schools 
_ by furnishing a few mouthfuls to migratory cormorants, who would. 
go from school district to. school district gathering up the crumbs 
disbursed from the public treasury, to the manifest injury of pri- 
vate schools and the still greater injury to the children of the State. 
“Tt speaks well for the native good sense and intelligence of the 
people of Tennessee that in spite of this inefficient and destructive
-P-A-G-E-82
—T3— 
system—a system that has lived by pretensions, and not by per- 
formance; a system that has been perpetuated only to relieve the - 
publie conscience—it speaks well, I say, for the people that in spite - 
of this. incubus they are still in favor.of publi¢ schools. The pub- 
lic heart beats warmly toward an efficient system, and those persons 
who are instrumental in fashioning and perfecting a system 
adapted to our society and our necessities will be in the future re 
garded as public benefactors.” : ‘ 
KEYNOTE or Succuss. 
In this very able and exhaustive report Mr. Killebrew struck the 
keynote of prosperity and success for the public schools when he 
declared that what was needed was a system that would be a source 
of just pride for all classes, the well to do aswell as those, depend- 
ent upon the State’s charity for means of education. If the senti- 
ment here announced had been appreciated by those who sought to . 
build up the system in the earlier days, conditions would not have , 
been as this report describes them. The failure of public schools 
in Tennessee was due largely to a lack of conception of the idea 
which ndW none will dispute that in order to successfully engraft 
the system upon the State the schools must be maintained for 
every class, open alike to all, the common property and pride of | 
every citizen. : 
Continuing, this report says: “ Under the county system now in 
operation only twenty-nine of the ninety-three counties in the 
State have levied a tax for school purposes. In some of them the 
tax is only nominal, and in others sufficiently liberal to keep up 
schools for several months in the, year.” . 
In marked contrast with this statement. is the current report of 
Superintendent Mynders, in which it is shown that not only has 
every county in the State levied a school tax, but the rate in none 
of them is less than 30 cents, and in a majority it is 40 cents and 
over. / 
In giving a list of the counties which levied school taxes in 1873 
and the amounts levied, it should be remarked that at the time this 
table was made no tax was levied by the State; therefore the levies -
-P-A-G-E-83
—T4— 
are the totals made for school purposes. There are few of these 
counties which do not now levy a larger tax than they did in 1873, 
and, in addition, all receive the full amount derived from the State 
tax of 15 cents. In other words, the tax rate in nearly all is 
larger by the amount of the State levy than it was in 1873. The 
following counties were the only ones that levied a school tax in 
1873 and the amounts levied on the $100 of property: 
Rou. or Honor. 
Bledsoe, 5 cents; Bradley, 20 cents; Cannon, 15 cents; Camp- 
bell, 40 cents; Carter, 20 cents; Dickson, 30 cents; Fayette, 5 
cents; Greene, 15 cents; Gibson, 25 cents; Grundy, ‘20 cents; 
Hamblen, 40 cents; Hancock, 10 cents; Knox, 20 cents; Marion, 
“ 10 cents; Polk, 20-cents; Roane, 20 cents; Union, 20 cents; Wash- 
ington, 15 cents; Williamson, 124 cents; Wilson, 5 cents; Warren, 
20 cents; Rutherford, 15 cents; Maury, 3 cents; Stewart, 20 cents ; 
Coffee, 20 cents; DeKalb, 15 cents; Davidson, 20 cents on prop~ 
- erty, 5 mills on merchandise, and half of the tax on privileges. __ 
In addition, McNairy County reported a levy sufficient to pro- 
duce $5,500 of school funds. All State taxes on polls under the 
Constitution went to the school fund. 
_ At the date of this report the scholastic population of the State 
was estimated at 391,000, which is just about the average enroll- 
ment in the schools at this time. But the worst of the story is 
yet to be told. 
“rom the returns as published,” continues the report, “it 
would be safe to say that not one-fifth of that population has any 
means of education. Indeed, in some of the counties visited -last 
summer there was not a single school, either public or private, 
in operation. Nor were there any efforts being made by the -citi- 
zens to rémedy the deficiency.” 
Assuming for the sake of argument that one-fifth of the scholas- 
tie population as estimated in 1873 had some means of education 
and that all of this fifth took advantage of that opportunity—a, 
rather far-fetched supposition, it will be conceded; but assuming 
this to be the case, there were in school at this time less than 60,000 
of the future citizens of Tennessee. The white population of the
-P-A-G-E-84
—T5— 
State has increased during the past three. decades less than 50 
per cent; yet the school enrollment to-day ig nearly 400,000, or 
almost seven times as much as it was in 1873. This is also as- 
suming that all of the 60,000 supposed to be in school were in the 
public schools, when it is known that at least a respectable per cent 
of those attending school thirty years ago were going to private 
institutions. 
INCREASED ENROLLMENT. 
In other words, while the population of the State has increased 
less than 50 per cent, the school enrollment and attendance has 
increased nearly 700 per cent, or about fifteen times as fast as the _ 
population. In 1873, although no State tax was levied for schools, _ 
less than 33 per cent of the counties levied any tax for education. 
Now the State levies a tax equal to the average levied by the coun- 
ties thirty-three years ago, and, in addition, contributes nearly a 
half million dollars per annum direct from the treasury; every 
county in the State levies a tax at least equal to the State levy, 
and in more than two-thirds more than the State levy. 
No better or more eloquent argument was ever made in behalf . 
of public education than was contained in the report from which 
we have just quoted. No man ever served the school interests bet- 
ter, and by serving them’ ever served his State better, than Pro- 
fessor Killebrew. It was latgely due to the campaign which he 
made of the State that the people were aroused to the importance 
of taking definite steps to guarantee the maintenance of an ade- 
quate system of public schools. The following quotation from his 
report is well worth preserving: 
“Tn all governments founded upon the supposition that the peo- — 
ple are intelligent and are able to govern themselves it is mani- 
festly their first duty to provide for their own perpetuation by 
providing means by which the children shall be instructed in such 
branches of learning as experience has showh to be necessary to 
inform them of their duties to the government and to make them 
good citizens. The whole subject was discussed in my former re- 
port; and statistics collected from various counties show that the 
law is general, that crime is directly as ignorance and inversely.
-P-A-G-E-85
—i6— 
as intelligence. If this is so, the first duty of the legislator should 
be to provide for the suppression. of crime rather than for the 
punishment of the criminal. And the tendency of all modern 
legislation is in this direction. , 
VALUE OF EDUCATION: 
“Viewed from another standpoint, and the value to the State 
in providing an efficient system of public education cannot be esti- 
mated. We have only considered briefly the negative benefits, but 
the advantages that would accrue in an industrial point of view are 
far greater. Not only is the productive capacity of an educated 
man or woman greatly increased by education, but the attractive 
force which intelligence adds to a community or a State has a value 
beyond calculation. Like seeks like. Intelligent men and women 
will not seek homes among the ignorant or among those who offer 
no educational advantages. Immigration to our State finds here 
its greatest check. 
“In my own judgment, formed deliberately after traversine 
nearly every portion of the State, there is no investment, n: 
the preservation of the credit of the State, that would pay 
handsome profit.as the establishment of a thorough, vigorous, and 
efficient system of public instruction, with a competent head, vested. 
with ample powers to inaugurate and sustain such a system.” 
The writer of these concluding lines indeed had a prophetic eye. 
- The material, industrial, and commercial advancement of the State, 
to say nothing of the moral improvement, has kept pace with the 
advance of its educational interests. 
_ © No State in the South has made greater progress in education 
than Tennessee; no State in the South has experienced. a more ~ 
healthful, rational, and beneficial progress along lines of indus- 
trial and commercial endeavor than this State. It is doubtful if 
" there is a State in the South, or in the Union for that matter, 
that has made greater progress along the lines of moral regener- 
ation. ‘The schoolhouse has literally driven the saloons out of 
eighty-five counties in the State. 
Think of conditions now and compare them with what some
-P-A-G-E-86
—TI— 
are pleased to refer to as the “good old times.”. In those “good . 
old times,” about 1873, there was not a county in Tennessee that 
did not have from one to a hundred low. grogshops; liquor was 
sold at every cross-roads; the liquor interests. dominated -politics, 
made the laws, and where they were administered at all were exe. 
cuted by those elected by and through the influence of the perni- 
cious liquor interests. Then the credit of the “State was so low 
that it was almost bankrupt. Now instead of the saloon in every 
’ county, we have the saloon in eleven counties; instead of the school- 
-house in twenty-nine counties, we have the schoolhouse in every - 
district of every one of the ninety-six counties of the State; in- 
stead of the place-seeking politicians courting the liquor interests, 
we see them singing the praises of public.schools. . 
Sazoow 1s DETHRONED. 
When one contemplates the change that time has wrought in 
this grand old State since the report from which we have: quoted 
went to the General Assembly, he must indeed be a very indifferent 
and callous citizen who does not first thank a wise and beneficent 
Providence for its controlling and directing hand, and, secondly, 
take a just and wholly laudable pride in his citizenship in such a 
Commonwealth and among a people who, almost unaided, without 
outside efforts, but by their own perseverance and labor, have en- 
throned. education and dethroned thé saloon. This people have . 
elevated the schoolhouse, with all of its attendant blessings, and by 
80 doing have destroyed forever the pernicious and damning influ- 
ence of the grogshop. 
If Tennessee has ‘ever had an Augustan era, it has been the past 
four years. During the years 1903; 1904, 1908, and 1906, thanks” 
to the wisdom and labors of those. who have directed the affairs 
of the government, and to a good, healthy, sustaining public senti- 
ment, more saloons have been closed and more schools have been 
opened than during any similar period in the history of this or 
probably any other Commonwealth that the world has ever known. ° 
For the scholastic year ending in August, 1874, marked progress 
is noted in the educational interests of the State. . According to
-P-A-G-E-87
—18— 
the annual report of John M. Fleming, the first Superintendent 
under the new system, the total receipts for the public schools from 
State and county sources was $788,404.70, of which amount $265,- 
‘951.53 was contributed by the State and $522,453.17 was paid by 
the counties. This sum credited to the State includes the amount 
received from the taxes on polls and interest on the public-school 
fund. Under the present system the poll tax-remains in the coun- 
ties, and, although levied by the State, is credited to the county 
fund. Hence the only fund contributed directly by the State was 
the interest on the permanent school: fund, amounting to about. 
$150,000. 
Including in ‘the total the amounts received from district ‘and 
city tax levies, the entire public-school revenue of the State for 
the scholastic year amounted to $998,459.10, which is nearly ten 
times the amount of interest that was received from the State on 
the original school fund, and which prior to the war constituted 
practically all the revenues of the public schools. ° 
EXPENSES OF SCHOOLS. 
These funds were expended as’ follows: Paid salaries of teach- 
ers, $769,459; building, repairing, and furnishing: schoolhouses, 
$101,875.98 ; salaries of County Superintendents, $37,023.64. To- 
~ tal, exclusive of expenses of city schools, $777,492.97. The cost 
of the pupils per month, exclusive of the cities, was 814-5 cents. 
The per cent of enrollment upon the scholastic population was 61. 
per cent, and the per cent of average attendance upon the enroll- 
ment was 62 per cent, making the per cent of average attendance 
upon the scholastic population only 38 per cent. - 
In 1874 there were thirty-nine counties which levied no taxes. 
_ upon polls for the support. of the schools; one levied 10. cents}. 
three, 25 cents; twelve, 50 cents; and thirty-four, $1; with three’: 
unreported. There were thirty-four counties which levied no prop- : 
erty tax for this year, as compared with sixty-four two years pre. -- 
‘vious—a gain of nearly 100 per cent. There were five counties: 
levying 5 cents tax; one levied.9 cents; twenty-nine levied 10. 
cents; ten levied 15 cents; one levied 18 cents; five levied 20 cents}
-P-A-G-E-88
—T9— 
three levied 25 cents; and three from which no Teports were re- 
ceived. Sixty-two counties did not levy any privilege taxes for 
the schools. . - 
In this report attention was called to the fact that no provision 
was made for the selection of County Superintendents in the event 
that vacancies occurred, and a recommendation was made that some 
means be made to elect this official where the County Courts re- 
fused to do so, as had been the case in some of the counties. ‘This 
‘fact indicates that there was yet not only an indifference to the 
cause of public education, but that there was decided hostility to 
the system in some sections of the State. ‘ 
The Superintendent as early as 1874 recognized the necessity 
for securing uniformity in the selection of text-books, although 
the remedy or plan suggested proved in after years to bexholly © 
unsatisfactory. Upon this point he says: “The law, as I think, 
very wisely left the ultimate authority over the subject of text- 
books with the district directors. The result has been very little 
complaint of the abuses that have prevailed, or at least have been 
charged, under different ‘systems in other States. Uniformity in 
text-books is certainly desirable, and in many of the counties the 
directors by concert of- action have secured practical uniformity.” 
Uniform TEXT-BOOKS. 
“Concerning the suggestion made at that early date for State uni- , 
' formity in the selection of text-hooks the Superintendent remarks: 
“ Of State uniformity in text-books I have nothing to say, deeming 
it for the present wholly impracticable.” 
_ +A feature of this report is a strong recommendation that the 
State make an adequate appropriation to aid in the establishment 
of a State Normal school for the training of the teachers. - Super- 
intendent Fleming says: “From what has already been said’ re- 
garding the difficulty of securing competent teachers in ‘all cases 
it will hardly require an argument to demonstrate the need of an 
institution for the education and training of teachers. School- 
teaching is a profession for the successful practice of which, barring 
rare exceptional cases,.a preparation is as necessary as for that 
of the other learned professions.” ”
-P-A-G-E-89
—80— 
A: bill proposed at the session of the Legislature of 1873 to ap- 
propriate $6,000 per annum for the support of a Normal school 
passed the Senate, but-was not acted upon in the House, and fa- 
vorable action upon the measure is urged by the Superintendent. 
This: appropriation was conditioned on the Peabody Educational 
Board making a like. appropriation. 
Continued progress in school affairs is evidenced by the first 
annual report of- Superintendent Trousdale submitted to the Gov- 
ernor in: December, 1875. There still lingered that prejudice 
against public schools in some sections of the State, however, that 
prevented many of the counties from receiving any material or 
practical benefits from the system. This is demonstrated in the 
following quotation from. the report: 
aa 
EvipENCES ov Presuptoz. 
“Tn some counties no compensation whatever is allowed by. the 
County Court to the Superintendent, which is a virtual annulment 
of the office, and acts directly as a denial of the intention of the 
Legislature to make a fair experiment of the public-school system. 
In other cases the County Courts have taken upon themselves to 
instruct the Superintendent to omit certain duties imposed by the 
law, that they might have a reasonable pretext for curtailing their 
compensation. _ 
“Tn happy. contrast: to the delinquencies I have noted, which 
have served as obstructions to the harmonious working of the sys- 
tem, I take pleasure ‘in stating that several of the counties have 
managed their school affairs with great. intelligence and public 
spirit, and. have employed as agents zealous and capable men. ~ 
Such instances have invariably demonstrated how successfully the 
schools may be conducted and how powerfully they may be made 
‘to answer to the benign intention of the Legislature where proper 
_ support and codperation are invoked:and where friendly instead of 
~ hostile elements are called.to their aid, Indeed, the striking con- 
trast thus presented between the employment of County Superin- 
tendents who have been permitted,-by reasonable compensation and 
encouragement, to bring to their work their whole energies cand
-P-A-G-E-90
_31— 
attainments, and the hostile policy of some necessarily resulting 
from the election of inefficient and poorly paid Superintendents, 
triumphantly vindicates the wisdom of the county supervision 
which the law intended to create and organize.” 
During Superintendent Trousdale’s administration an Act was 
passed to abolish the office of State Superintendent, but Governor 
Porter. killed the measure with a “pocket” veto. 
County SUPERVISION. ee 
Evidently at the date of this report there was a strong and for- 
midable prejudice against the county system and a demand for the 
abolition of the office of County Superintendent, for the Superin- 
tendent devotes considerable space to an, exhaustive argument in 
favor of a continuation of the system. He vigorously opposed a 
return to the old plan of allowing the district directors the full 
power of direction and supervision.’ Time has, however, so. thor- 
oughly ‘demonstrated the wisdom of having an executive head for 
the schools in each county that a repetition of the statements then 
made would serve no purpose but to show the lack of information 
upon and conception of the importance of having capable and di- 
rect official supervision of the educational interests in order. that 
' a harmonious and responsive system might be built upon all over 
the State. 
According ‘to this. report the number of pupils enrolled in the . 
schools for the scholastic year 1875 was 199,058, seventeen coun- 
ties failing to report the enrollment. The average daily attendance . 
was. 136,805. Eight of the ninety-three counties reported no 
schools—viz., Cheatham, Fentress, Gibson, Houston, Jackson, 
Lewis, Macon, and Perry. This is in striking contrast with con- 
ditions reported three years before, when more than a majority 
of. the counties. were without any educational facilities, either pob- 
lic or private. : 
-. During the year 3,127 white schools were in operation and 770 : 
‘ colored, with 45 not classified. The total number of. teachers:em- - 
ployed was 4,210. The average term was three and one-third: 
months, or about sixty-seven days—but little more than half the:-
-P-A-G-E-91
—39— 
average term during the year 1906. Both the enrollment and the 
average attendance for 1875 showed a decrease as compared with 
the previous year, and there were also about 1,200 fewer schools 
reported in the State. 'The average salaries paid the teachers was 
$30.84, as compared with $33.03 the year before. . 
‘ATTENDANCE IN 1875. 
The per cent of attendance on the scholastic population was the 
same, however, for 1875 that it was for the preceding year—38 
per cent. hat there was a decided opposition to*county super- 
vision on the part of the County Courts is abundantly evidenced — 
from the fact that the average salaries paid these officials fell from 
$420.81 for 1874 to $176.18 for the following year. 
The following very substantial reasons are given for the falling 
off in the enrollment of the schools : 
“ First, the postponement of the collection of the taxes of 1874 
by the General Assembly until November. This postponement ren- 
dered’ it necessary to shorten the terms of many schools, and thus 
to preclude the enrollment of such as could attend at that season 
of the year. 
“ Second,.the financial pressure prevented many from enrollment 
who would have otherwise attended.” The short crops of 1878 cre- 
ated an. absolute necessity for every available hand on the farms 
in the subsequent year. Absolute poverty and want thus cut of 
the attendance. - . 
“Third, the reckless misceloulations of the school officers in 
some counties in 1873-74 involved them in an indebtedness which 
niade it impossible to open their schools until the debt was finet, 
" paid to the creditor teacher.” 
The total school receipts for the year 1875 were $740,316.63, as. 
compared with $998,845.10 for the preceding year. The amount. 
disbursed was $703,358.98. ‘These figures. include the amounts . 
received and disbursed by the cities. : 
The report furnishes:a table by counties of the.average per cené. 
of attendance on population that furnishes interesting food for 
sthought. One would have imagined that the best showing would
-P-A-G-E-92
—g3— 
be made by the counties of Hast Tennessee, where there were then, 
as there are now, comparatively few negroes. This is not the case, 
“however. Warren County, with 72 per cent, stands at the head of 
- the list; while the rich and populous county of Knox had but 37 
per cent; Jefferson County, 42 per cent; and Johnson County, 46 
per cent. 
Stars Normat Scnoot. 
The General Assembly of 1875 responded to the demand for the 
establishment of a State Normal school, and a bill to organize a 
system of Normal schools was passed. A Board of Education, 
composed of EH. 1. Ewing, of Rutherford; S. Watson, Dr. J. B. 
Lindsley, and L. G. Tarbox, of Davidson; R. W. Mitchell, of Shelby ; 
and J. J. Reese, of Knox County, was appointed to carry the law 
into execution. 
Soon after the organization of this board -a proposition from the 
trustees of the University of Nashville tendering the use of their 
college buildings, grounds, ete., for two years, and. also the in- 
come arising from their permanent fund and that of the Mont- 
gomery Bell Academy, amounting together to $6,000 per annum, 
on the condition that the academy be kept in operation as here- 
tofore and as a model training school. to the Normal university 
proposed to be established, was received and accepted by the board. 
At the same time the agent of the Peabody Educational Fund 
modified: the proposition formerly made by him to the State so that 
the sum’ of $6,000, which he had proposed to appropriate for the 
establishment of a State Normal school on condition that the 
State would-appropriate a like sum, was absolutely tendered by him 
for two years by accepting the loan of the tniversity. in lieu thereof. ~ 
These two donations, amounting to $12,000 per annum, together 
with the use of the buildings, grounds, library, etc., with the con- 
ditions annexed, were accepted by the State Baard of Education ; 
and Eben-S. Stearns was elected president of the Normal Col- 
lege, and, subsequently, by the trustees, chancellor of the Univer- 
sity of Nashville. 
The formal opening of the State Normal College took place 
on Wednesday, December 1, 1875, in the hall of the House of Rep-
-P-A-G-E-93

resentatives. This was the beginning of ‘an institution that has 
come to be recognized as. one of the greatest teachers’ training 
schools in the South, and which has probably done more for the 
advancement of the cause of popular education by fitting teachers 
for the responsible duties of their high calling than’ any similar 
institution south of the Ohio River. 
TeacHers’ INSTITUTES. 
To this date no provision had been made by law for the holding 
of County, Teachers’ Institutes. A strong plea is made by Super- 
intendent Trousdale for the establishment of auxiliary training 
schools. 
According to reports from fifty-four counties, there wére 138 
new .schoolhouses erected in the State for the year ending August, 
1875. -A majority were reported to be plain, substantial frame 
structures, a few of a better quality, and some of an inferior 
quality. 
Attention is called to the fact that at this date there were no 
reliable statistics from which the value of the common-school prop- 
erty of the State could be ascertained. 
In addition to the $6,000 appropriated by’ the Peabody Educa~ 
tional Fund. in 1875 for the Normal College, $1,500 was. ap- 
propriated to turnish the office of the State Superintendent with 
such assistance as would enable him to bestow more time and. en- 
ergy upon canvassing and arousing the public mind on the, qques- . 
tion of free schools; $1, 500 was appropriated for the Shelbyville 
‘High School; and, in’ addition, appropriations aggregating $6,000 
: were made to twenty-se#en free schools, making the- grand total 
"| received from this fund by the people of Tennessee over $15, 008. = 
Touching the organization of city schools which was then: just 
- beginning, except the Nashville schools, which were organized Prior. 
to the war, the report makes this comment: 
“The séparate reports of the city schools of Nashville, Mem- 
phis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Edgefield, which constitu 
important part of our general system, deriving their support’. 
part.from the State and county taxatioi, which is supplemented    
     
   
-P-A-G-E-94
—85— 
with taxes levied by the city authorities, are referred to as con- 
stituting a noble living monument of the enlightened public spirit 
of the citizens of those municipalities: These schools, mostly con- 
ducted as they are on the most advanced principles of educa- 
tional purposes, adapted to the genius of the people by whom they 
are sustained, and conservative of all that is valuable in the treas- 
ured traditions of the past, with every improvement that is useful, 
while rejecting all that is merely newfangled or novel, may be 
regarded as landmarks for guidance in the earnest effort being 
made 'to spread their blessings into every portion of the State. In 
_ this light they are a study to the practical educator; and their 
methods, discipline, organization, and details should form an in- 
ductive basis upon which to build the future superstructure of our 
free-schoo] system.” 
It should be stated that Edgefield, to which reference is made, 
became a part of the city of Nashville in 1881, and the school sys- 
tem of that city was merged with the splendid system for so long 
maintained by the capital city. The educational system of the 
greater city justly deserves the encomiums bestowed in the fore- 
going quotation. 
HipucaTion or UNFORTUNATES. 
By this date (1875) the State had also liberally provided for the 
proper training and education of. the blind within her borders, and. 
had also established a Deaf and Dumb School at Knoxville. - 
“A feature of the meeting of the State Teachers’ Association, an 
organization that has contributed so much to the upbuilding of 
the public-school system of Tennessee, during this year was the 
presence of ex-President Andrew Johnson... He was invited to 
deliver an address, but declined, saying, however, that his whole 
life gave evidence that he favored the cause of education. He 
promised to address the meeting at some future date. Alas! Be- 
fore the next annual meeting the great commoner had paid the last 
debt to nature. . 
From the report submitted at this meeting it appears that the 
Peabody Educational Fund had expended during the previous year
-P-A-G-E-95
—86— 
$36,000 on public schools in Tennessee. It was also remarked by 
the agent of the board that if the Legislature abolished the offices 
of County and State Superintendent and remitted the. entire man- 
agement of the public-school system to the district directors, he 
would deem it advisable that the board withdraw its aid and go 
into States where an adequate system of school supervision was 
guaranteed. , 
The Act of 1875 establishing the Normal University for the first 
time in Tennessee created the State Board of Education, a board 
that is still in existence. The first board was composed of the Gov- 
ernor as ez-officto president and six members, two to be appointed. 
for two years, two for four years, and two for six years. At the 
expiration of the terms of the members their successors were to 
serve six years. ‘The names of the members of the first Board of 
Education have been heretofore given. 
The scholastic population of the State for the year ending Au- 
gust, 1876, was 434,131; the number of schools in the State, 3,879, 
of which 3,070 were white and 827% were colored. The average 
number of days taught was 71.9—an increase over the previous year 
of about four days. The enrollment was 194,180, and the aver- 
age daily attendance was 125,908. The per cent of attendance 
on. the school population showed a very lamentable decrease'as com- 
pared with 1875, being only 28 per cent. Thus only a fraction 
more than a fourth of the children of school ages in Tennessee 
were attending the public schools. 
Tuacumrs’ SALARIES. 
The average salaries paid the teachers showed an increase, being 
$32.18 per month. For the first time in the history of the State, 
a statement of the number. and value of the schoolhouses was-sub- 
mitted by Superintendent Trousdale. Before this date there is 
no information extant'from which these statistics can be obtained. 
The number of schoolhouses were: Stone or brick, 106; frame, 
1,073; and log, 1,977. Thus nearly two-thirds of all the school- 
-houses were log. ‘The total number in the State was 3,156, and 
the estimated value thereof, including sites, seats, desks, etc., was
-P-A-G-E-96
—37— 
$1,011,853.79; the value of school apparatus, including globes, 
charts, etc., was $37,090; making the total value of all the public- 
school property of the State, $1,048,943.79. 
There were erected during the year 295 schoolhouses, of which 
- 185 were log, 2 were brick, and the remainder frame. The aver- 
age salaries paid the County Superintendents was $207.98—a very 
substantial increase over the amount reported for 1875, demon- 
strating that the system was growing in favor all the time. The 
number of private schools in-the State was 1,251, attended by 
31,000 pupils. Thus less than 40 per cent of the children of 
school age in the State were attending any school, public or pri- 
vate, 
The estimated value of the school property of the cities main- 
taining separate systems is given at $400,000; the expenditures 
for the year, at $169,000; the average attendance, 7,855, out, of a , 
population of 25,226. ‘Thus, despite the superior advantages of- 
‘fered by the city schools as compared with those of the rural dis- 
tricts, less than a third of the children of. school age attended 
_. school. 
For the year ending August 31, 1876, the total amount expended 
for all purposes for public schools in the State amounted to $698,- 
220.36, there being an excess of $8,680.75 in the expenditures over 
the receipts. Of the amount expended, the teachers received in 
salaries $558,518.20; while $47,000 was expended for school sites, 
buildings, repairs, furniture, fixtures, etc. 
The opening paragraph of Superintendent Trousdale’s ‘report of 
1877 shows that during the year progress was made by the schools, 
despite the financial depression of that time and the decrease ‘in 
the receipts. He says: : 
: Procress EXHIBITED. 
* “The summaries here submitted exhibit-a decided and gratifying 
progress in our public-school system during the scholastic year end- 
ing August 31, 1877. It will be noted that there-has been a de- 
crease in the receipts of school money as compared to any pre- 
vious year since the inauguration of our present system, which was
-P-A-G-E-97
—838— 
-followed, .of course, by a decrease in expenditures. This decrease 
amounted to $120,311.67 as compared with the previous year, and 
to $280,035 as compared with the year 1874, when the public 
schools under the operation of the present law were opened. This 
fact, united with the general depression in financial affairs, when 
allowed its due weight, presents very high encouragement in esti- 
mating the marked advance niade in enrollment, average attend-. 
ance, and the improved standard of teaching as shown by the re- 
ports of the County Superintendents.” 
The scholastic population of the State in this year was 442 158, . 
an increase of 8,327. The average daily attendance was 142,266, 
the highest of any year since 1874 and over 16,000 larger than it © 
was for the preceding year. "The average term was seventy days, 
a decrease of two days as compared with the former year. The 
_ average salaries paid the teachers was $28.53, a decrease of $3.65. 
However, the per cent of attendance of the scholastic population 
increased from 28 to 33 per cent. 
The number of schoolhouses in the State was 3,388, and during 
the year there were 272 new schoolhouses erected, and the esti- 
mated value of all the public-school property of the State is placed 
at $1,090,814.49, an increase over the previous year of $41,870.70. 
The receipts of the schools during the year were as follows: From. 
the State, $162,280.28; from the counties, $244,503.82; from other 
sources, $71,923.28. Total, $718,423.48. Ixclusive of the items 
marked “other sources,” the receipts were $647,000, as compared. 
with $698,000 the year before. 
Countizs Levyine Taxus. 
According te this report, there were thirty-seven counties which 
levied no property taxes for the year; and of these, thirty-four 
levied no tax whatever. But one county levied 30 cents; two, 25 
cents; three, 15 cents; while thirty levied 10 cents, one levied 8 
cents, and four, including the rich and populous county of Shelby,. 
levied but 5 cents. The tax in Maury County was the lowest— 
only 2 cents. 
The schools were embarrassed during the year by the nonpay-
-P-A-G-E-98
—89— 
ment of taxes, resulting from a postponement of the same by an 
Act of the Legislature. The net balance on hand at the close of 
the previous year, aggregating $1,324.93, as reported by the coun- 
ties, partially remedied this drawback and enabled them to exhibit 
the gratifying increase in enrollment of 17$ per cent and an in- 
crease in attendance of over 16,000, in addition to the opening of 
807 new schools and the employment of 791 more teachers than 
during the previous year. The employment of the additional 
teachérs and the opening of the new schools resulted, however, in 
the reduction of the teachers’ salaries, and to that extent discour- 
aged the. employment of the best talent. 
Notwithstanding this fact; however, reports submitted by the 
County Superintendents showed an improvement in the standard 
of teaching, due to the greater care exercised by the County Super- 
intendents in scrutinizing the qualifications of teachers and in 
granting certificates to teach and by a spirit of inquiry among the 
teachers themselves as to the best methods to be pursued in their 
avocation. . 
The annual expenditure for public schools at this period was 
‘only $1.51 per capita of the school population of the State and 
only 51 cents to each inhabitant of the State. At this same time 
some of the States of the Union were expending as much as $22 
per capita of the school population. ‘Therefore, is it to be won- 
dered that progress and advancement in education has been slow in 
this State? : 
First Institutes Hep. 
_ Another marked improvement is noted during 1877, and thai 
was the holding of teachers’ institutes, the first regularly organize, 
institutes that had been held. One of these institutes was held in © 
each congressional district of the State. The institutes were from 
every standpoint successful, and were attended by an average of © 
about fifty teachers to the institute; and a majority of the County 
Superintendents, together with many of the district directors, were 
also present. So successful were the institutes that a decision to 
hold them annually thereafter was promptly reached. - 
The State Teachers’ Colored Institute also held about fifteen
-P-A-G-E-99
—90— 
institutes in different parts of the State during the year, with great 
advantage to the teachers of that race. 
In addition to $9,000 appropriated by the Peabody Educational 
Fund to the State Normal College in 1877, $5,750 was appropri- 
ated from that fund to assist schools in nineteen counties of the 
State, the amounts varying from $150 to $1,500 for the school. 
During this year the president of the East Tennessee Univer- 
sity and State Industrial College addressed a circular to the County 
Superintendents, asking their codperation in selecting the most 
efficient and worthy pupils who passed through the public-school © 
course of study for matriculation as free scholars in the university. 
Notwithstanding the embatrassments from financial distress dur- 
ing the scholastic year ending August 31, 1878, the summaries of 
the public schools for that year exhibited an unprecedented increase 
both as to their scope and efficiency. The scholastic population 
was 448,917; the number of school districts in the State, 1,895 ; 
and the number of schools, white and colored, 5,346.. The aver- 
age number of days taught had increased from seventy to seventy- 
seven, or exactly 10 per cent. Five hundred graded and consoli- 
dated schools were reported, a notable gain over previous years. 
ENROLLMENT IN 1878. 
The enrollment of children between the ages of six and eighteen 
years was 261,162, and the daily average attendance was 172,198— 
larger by more than 10,000 than during any previous year since 
the inauguration of the system. The percentage of attendance on 
school population was 38; the average cost of tuition per pupil 
enrolled was only 66 cents. 
Unfortunately, another decrease, though only a slight one this © 
time, is noted jn the average salaries paid the teachers, which was 
but. $28.12 per month. During the year 316 schoolhouses were 
erected, of which 131 were log. The estimated value of school 
property of the State was $1,051,398.67. During the year sixty- 
one counties levied a property tax for the maintenance of the 
schools, fifty-three levied poll taxes, and twenty levied’ privilege 
taxes. Twenty-nine did not levy any taxes for schools. This is 
the’exact number which five years before levied school taxes.
-P-A-G-E-100
—9i— 
However, the average property tax was exceedingly low, being 
only a fraction more than 124 cents on the $100. The- total re- 
ceipts of the schools amounted to $904,427.78 and the expenditures 
to $794,231.57, the balance on hand being $170,162.77. From the 
balance should be deducted the indebtedness due at that time, 
amounting to $47,580.77, leaving the net balance to the credit of 
the schools, $122,582. During the year 153 County Teachers’ In- 
stitutes were held, as compared with 104 for the previous year. 
It is worthy of mention that as the public schools increased in 
efficiency and scope, they grew very perceptibly in popular favor. 
This is evidenced not alone by the increase in the attendance, but 
also by the decrease in the number of private schools of the State. 
“The number of private schools in 1877 was 1,025; a year later 
there were only 988 schools of this class in the State. 
For the period ending August 31 there was a very gratifying 
movement in many counties for the supplying of better and more 
commodious schoolhouses; but in many districts the accommoda- 
tions were still wretched, in a number of districts the schools being 
taught in churches, and sometimes in private buildings. 
Pzasopy DONATIONS. 
From the Peabody Educational Fund for 1878 the State re- 
ceived altogether $13,200, of which amount $9,000 was given to the 
State Normal College, $1,000 to congressional institutes, and $200 
to colored institutes, the remainder being distributed to about 
fifteen schools scattered over the State. , 
Of the progress made by the Normal College, Superintendent 
Trousdale, in his report of 1878, says: “ The report of the secretary 
of. the State Board of Education is herewith submitted, from which 
it appears that the institution has had a successful career, far be- 
yond the expectations of its friends. I have had occasion person- 
ally to make frequent visits to the college, and was always deeply 
impressed with its efficiency and usefulness in its high special 
sphere of preparing teachers for the public schools of the State. 
Having been founded by the beneficence and enlightened public 
zeal and spirit of others, and never having taxed the treasury of
-P-A-G-E-101
—99— 
the State or the school fund a cent, it should not only receive a 
generous and grateful appreciation, but should become the object 
of the wise fostering care and supervision of the State.” 
Again, as the result of the postponement of the collection of 
taxes by the Legislature, the school revenues for 18%9 were cut. 
short about $100,000. But notwithstanding this serious drawback, 
the reports for that year show an. increase both in enrollment and 
average attendance and’ a larger number of schools taught and 
teachers employed. The reports of the County Superintendents, 
with a few exceptions, indicated also a better class of instruction, 
a higher standard of teaching, and a very noticeable and gratify- 
ing spirit of improvement in all the details of school management. 
Staristics or 1879. 
The scholastic population of 1879 was reported at 514,643, an 
increase of 65,726. The large increase was almost entirely due, 
however, to the action of the General Assembly of 1879, which 
increased the school ages from six to eighteen years to six to twenty- 
one years. There were 5,612 ‘schools open in the State, of which 
542 were graded schools, an increase in this class of 42. 
The school enrollment was 264,687, an increase of 3,535 as com~ 
pared with 1878. The most gratifying increase noted, however, 
was in the average attendance, which showed a gain of 13,964 as 
compared with the previous year. The estimated value of school 
property of the State showed an increase of over $111,000 for the 
year. During the year licenses were granted to 5,590 teachers, 
an increase of 499. . 
Property taxes had been levied “by seventy-two counties, an in- 
crease of eleven ; while sixteen more counties levied a supplemental 
“poll iax for schools than made that levy the year before.- The 
public-school revenues for all sources amounted to $785,051.27 
and the disbursements to $710,651.72. As compared with the pre- 
ceding year, there was a decrease in the receipts of $119,376 and 
a decrease in the disbursements of $87,579.85. 
Due to the decreased receipts, and also to the large increase in 
the number of schools, the average number of days for the term
-P-A-G-E-102
—93— 
in 1879 fell to sixty-nine, the smallest since the inauguration of 
the system, with one exception. Likewise, probably for the. same 
causes, the salaries of teachers fell to $25.67, the smallest since 
the law of 1873 was passed. There was a-notable gain in the 
number of institutes held, 172 having been suocessfully operated 
during the year. 
The average cost of tuition per pupil in the public schools in 
1879 was 60 cents, as compared with 90 cents for the preceding 
year and with $1.46 per pupil in the private schools. There was 
an increase of 425 in the number of school districts. 
INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
At this time the question of industrial education began to agi- 
tate the minds of the people, as was evidenced by the action of the 
Legislature in providing for the study of the elements of agri- 
culture in the public schools by directing that a text-book on this 
subject should be designated or prepared. To Tennessee belongs 
the honor of inaugurating this wise movement. 
Under the authority conferred by the Act referred to, the State 
Superintendent had prepared by Prof. N. T. Lupton, professor of 
chemistry of Vanderbilt University, a text-book on the elements of 
agriculture, which was introduced. into the public schools, the fol- 
lowing year. , 
In this year the agents of the Peabody Educational Fund an- 
nounced that thereafter it would not make any additional appro- 
priations for graded schools except it be in special and -extraor- 
dinary cases, but instead the whole income would ‘be devoted to 
sustaining or aiding the Normal college and institute work. 
By. Act of the Legislature of 1879 the duty of holding compet- 
itive examinations for cadetships in the University of Tennessee 
was devolved upon the State, City, and County Superintendents. 
Of the 225 students who matriculated at the university in the fol- 
lowing year, 124 were State appointments. The wisdom of this 
legislation was speedily demonstrated.’ 
A number of other Acts relating to the administration of public 
schools was passed by the Legislature of 1879, which, briefly sum- 
marized, follow:
-P-A-G-E-103
* —94— 
The Act before referred to making the school ages from six to 
twenty-one years and providing for an annual enumeration of the 
scholastic population. 
An Act requiring school warrants to.be approved by the County 
Superintendent, and providing that no indebtedness be ‘incurred. 
beyond the power of the directors to meet from the current incom- 
ing taxes. 
An Act requiring that on or before September 15 “of each year 
the County Trustees make report to the County Superintendent of 
the amount of school money received and disbursed by him for the 
year ending August 31. This Act required that the sources from 
which the funds were received be designated and the disbursements 
properly classified. 
Suppivision or Disrricrs. 
An Act was passed authorizing the district directors to subdivide 
the school districts, subject to the approval of the County Courts. 
The County Superintendent was required to make and keep 'a rec- 
ord of the numbers and boundaries of the school districts and of 
the changes that may be made from time to time. 
By 1880 conditions in the public-school system of the State 
showed a most gratifying and in many respects wonderful prog-' 
~ ress. In that year there were but ten counties in the State which 
did not levy any property tax for the schools, and the average tax 
levy was nearly 15 cents to the county. 
The school enrollment had increased from 264,000 to 290,000 
and the average attendance from 186,000 to 191,000, while the 
number of teachers employed had increased to 5,954. The total 
receipts for the year were $799,217.40, and the disbursements 
amounted to $724,862.04. The average number of days taught 
was sixty-eight, a decrease of one day; but the average sal- 
ary paid to the teachers showed a gain of about $1 per month, 
although it was yet ridiculously small and wholly inadequate. 
Under the authority conferred by Section 31 of the school law, 
the State Superintendent in 1880 suggested the course of studies 
to be taught in the graded schools, the schools being divided into 
three grades. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
—95— 
During the years,1881 and 1882 the school interests of the 
State continued to prosper, although owing to the intense political 
struggle during those years over the question of the settlement of 
the State debt the schools did not always receive that attention 
from legislators and others directly concerned with the adminis- 
tration of the school affairs that they deserved. In the reports 
submitted by Superintendents Doak and Crawford progress and _ 
improvement is noted. 
’ SUPERINTENDENT PaIny. 
During the four years following the administration of Superin- 
tendent Crawford the school affairs of the State were ably admin- 
istered by Superintendent Thomas H. Paine. In his first report, 
dated June 30, 1883, the Legislature having made that date the 
close of the school year, he says: 
“In the general prosperity which a bountiful Providence has 
vouchsafed to the people of Tennessee during the past year the 
cause of education has fully shared. Personal visitation and ob- 
servation, together with the evidence furnished by the reports of ” 
County Superintendents, have satisfied me that the interest in 
favor of our system, as fixed by the Act of 1873 and Acts amenda- 
tory thereof, is steadily increasing and assuming a more intelligent 
and well-defined form of action. Active opposition to the system 
has almost ceased, and universal recognition of the fact that the 
State should maintain ‘a uniform system of public schools’ is 
nearly assured. The growth of population continually requires — 
additional educational facilities; but our increasing wealth at the 
same time supplies the means for meeting the new demands,. so” 
that our school interests are steadily keeping pace with the gen- 
eral progress of the State.” : 
The school receipts for the State for the year ending June 30, 
1883, were $1,204,738.40, an increase of over 40 per cent in three 
years. The scholastic population was 561,495, and there were 
6,111 schools open. The school districts at this date were 2,586, 
showing that the number was constantly increasing, adding to the 
difficulties of securing capable and energetic -district supervision.
-P-A-G-E-105
—6— 
One of the great weaknesses of our system has been and is now in 
the fact that responsibility for school management and ‘for the 
expenditure of school funds has been divided between too large a 
number of directors. Just a little more concentration of author- 
ity in our school administration would undoubtedly promote both 
economy in the expenditure of funds and give to the schools more 
efficient teachers. - 
EXPENDITURES IN 1883. 
The expenditures for the schdols for the y year amounted to $918,- 
863.03, which to that time was the largest amount ever expended 
in one year on public education since the State was admitted to the 
Union. Of this amount the teachers received nearly $800,000. 
There were then 4,506 schoolhouses in the State, of which 2,198 
were frame and 2,193 were log. This marked the beginning of 
the decline of the log schoolhouse. In no year since then has there 
been as many log schoolhouses in Tennessee as there were frame 
houses. The number of houses erected of stone or brick begins 
here to show a substantial increase, 115 houses of this class being 
“reported in 1883. The number of houses of the better class have 
from that time constantly increased. During the year ¥ brick, 231 
frame, and only 59 log houses were erecied. The value of the 
school property had now grown to the very substantial ‘total of 
$1,120,549.96. The school term had lengthened to seventy-eight 
days; the average salary of the teachers had increased to $27.79 ; 
and eighty-three counties had Jevied a property tax, the average 
rate being 18 cents on the $100. , 
By Act of the General. Assembly of 1883 the first State aid to 
" Peabody Normal College for Teachers was appropriated. The bill 
carried an annual appropriation of $10,000, which was subse- 
quently increased to $20,000 per annum. The Act making this 
appropriation declared that it was conditioned on the general agent 
of the Peabody Board of Trustees allowing to this State scholar- 
ships on the same conditions as those granted to other States. .This 
condition was accepted, and this State allowed fourteen scholar- 
ships. Under the first arrangement competitive examinations were 
held in each of the ten congressional districts, the remaining four

scholarships being appointed from: the pupils of this State in ‘the 
Normal. College by the State Superintendent. 
STATISTICS FOR 1885. 
During the two years ending in June, 1885, the schools con- 
tinued ‘to prosper and advance in all lines, as is evidenced by the 
report submitted by the State Superintendent at that time. The 
scholastic population increased to 603,831; the enrollment, to 373,- 
877; and the average daily attendance, to 192,403. During the 
year there were 7,249 teachers examined, of whom 6,575 were 
licensed. The total receipts of the schools during. the year 
amounted to $1,330,839, which was an increase of $38,676.29 over 
the preceding year. The salaries paid to teachers aggregated 
$876,000, the average per month being $28.52. Highty-three coun- 
ties levied a supplemental property tax, and the same number 
levied an additional poll tax. The estimated value of school prop- — 
‘erty exceeded by nearly a half million dollars the amount reported 
ten years previous, being placed at $1,375,780.86.. / 
The reports of the County Superintendents showed a very ae- 
cided increase of interest on the’ part of teachers in county insti- 
tutes, there having been 349 held during the year. A majority of 
them were well attended, and the interest manifested in them by 
the public generally evidenced a healthy and gratifying sentiment : 
in favor of public schools throughout the State. / 
Improvements in the service performed by the County Superin- 
tendenis was one of the most gratifying signs of the time. . An 
important. recommendation of the Superintendent’s, report of this 
.year is that the Legislature make an appropriation. to aid the State 
teachers’ institute work, the expenses of which to this time. had - 
been provided by the Peabody Educational Fund. 
. [voreasep ATTENDANCE IN 1886. 
It is gratifying to note the increase in the average daily attend- 
ance for the year ending June 30, 1886; which was 278,276, an in- 
‘crease of 85,873 over the preceding year. However, this increase 
to some extent was only apparent, and not real, but was due to
-P-A-G-E-107
—98— 
an ‘improved system of reports and to the extraordinary efforts 
made by the State Department to secure accurate reports. After 
making all allowances for the imperfect records of preceding years, 
it is evident that the year witnessed a large increasé in the average 
- daily attendance over any preceding year since the establishment 
of the system. The increase was largely in excess of the increase 
of scholastic population or enrollment. Taken in connection with 
the increase in the number of schools and teachers, these facts af- 
ford incontestable evidence of the growth in public favor and 
esteem of the public-school system. 
Four-MiLE Law. 
- While not primarily intended for that purpose, yet one of ‘the 
“most important Acts ever passed affecting the public schools of 
Tennessee was the celebrated four-mile law of 1887. ‘The Act pro~ 
_hibited the sale of any intoxicants within four miles of a school- 
house, whethe? a school was kept there or not, except in incorpo- 
rated towns. The purpose of this Act was to drive-the saloon and 
grogshop to the incorporated towns, where there would be suffi- 
cient police protection to guard against the evils which follow in _ 
the train of the open saloon. This being the purpose, therefore 
it was a cause of congratulation to all the lovers of education that - 
within fourteen years after the organization of the public-school 
system schoolhouses had so multiplied that it was practically im~- 
possible to find a place in the State where liquor could be safely 
sold outside of an incorporated town. In other words, it is to the 
everlasting credit of the people of Tennessee that there were few 
places in the State where one could get as far as four miles. from a 
. schoolhouse. 
This Act was sustained by the courts, and has been the basis: of 
all subsequent legislation, which has resulted in driving the sa- 
loon entirely from eighty-five counties of the State and which in 
the near future seems destined to eliminate them froma majority 
’ of the remaining eleven counties. 
This. law, passed as it was in deference to an overwhelming pop- 
ular sentiment, evidences in the most eloquent terms. the. interest
-P-A-G-E-108
—39— \ 
which the people of Tennessee felt in the cause of education.-. It-also 
marks the beginning of the time when the politicians ceased: to pan- 
der to the vicious liquor interests and began to urge improvenient, _ 
in the public schools. The law was a ‘protection to the public 
schools, a protection to the boys, and an honor to the State whose 
statute books it acorns. A people that. would rise almost as one 
man and solemnly demand that the schools, the boys, and the homes 
-must be saved from the pernicious influences of the dramshops 
deserve the very best educational system. that the mind of man 
can devise. . 
“Arbor Day,” 
” At the same session of the Legislature an Act was passed requir- 
ing County Superintendents to set apart and designate some day 
during the month of November to be observed as “Arbor Day.” Un- 
der the provisions of this law arbor day has been observed in many 
of the counties, with the result that the school grounds. have been 
beautified and adorned and the occasion made one of great pleas- 
ure and instruction to the young people. 
“In 1887 the scholastic population of the State was 640, ott, and 
the average daily attendance was 252,248, the enrollment being 380,- 
625, and the total receipts of the schools, $1,424,650.94, of which 
amount $887,669.38 was expended for teachers’ salaries and $64,- 
000 for the purchase of sites, repairs, and school apparatus. 
On April 11, 188%, Dr. Eben S. Stearns, president of the Nor- 
mal College from the date of its foundation, twelve years before, 
died; and after consultation with the Peabody Board of Trustees, 
the State Board of Education elected Prof. W. H.. Payne, of the 
University of Michigan, his successor. The new president was, in- 
ducted into office with appropriate ceremonies on October 5, 1887. 
’ For the first time since the college was established every Southern 
State was represented among the students, the attendance in 1887 
being 261, as compared with 177 the year before. : ° 
Prapopy SCHOLARSHIPS. ’ 
Under the arrangement between the State Board of Education 
and the college the State was entitled to fourteen scholarships,- 
appointed from the senatorial districts by the State Senators.

MURFREESBORO, TENNESSEE
-P-A-G-E-109
—100— 
In the introductory to his report for the year ending June 30, 
1888, State Superintendent Smith says of conditions in Tennes- 
see: : 
“The accompanying statistics, when carefully compared with 
those of former years, will reveal the growth of public education 
in Tennessee; for, indeed, a school system is a growth, and of neces- 
sity must be a slow growth. But I do not hesitate to say that if 
the years from 1873 (the date when our present school law went 
into effect) to 1888 be compared with the same number of years in 
any other State in the Union, greater progress cannot be shown 
than is manifest in these years. The average enrollment and the 
average daily attendance has increased nearly 100 per cent, and 
the same per cent of gain is manifest all along the line. In school- 
houses and school furniture the improvement is nearly 100 per cent. 
“The length of the school term does not show such a marked 
_inerease; but when we consider the increased enrollment and the 
average daily attendance (and the school term has made some 
gains), it is evident that the amount expended for school Purposes 
has iricreased at about the. same ratio.” 
During the year ninety of the ninety-six counties of the State 
held county institutes, the largest number that had to that time 
ever held institutes. These institutes were attended by 4,350, or 
about three-fourths of the public-school teachers then employed in 
the State. Much credit for this showing is due to the organiza~ 
tion of the Public School Officers’ Association at Nashville in 1887, 
an organization-that has done and is doing so much for the advance— 
ment of the cause of education. 
Women ELiciBLe FoR SUPERINTENDENT. 
In ‘response to.a request from the State Superintendent, Attor~ 
ney-general Pickle rendered an opinion to the effect that under 
existing law women were not eligible to the office of County Su~ 
perintendent.. By Act of 1889 this disability was removed, and 
some of the best Superintendents the State has had since have been. 
women. 
In his report submitted for the year ending June 30, 1890, Su-
-P-A-G-E-110
—101— 
perintendent Smith makes an earnest plea for the enactment of a 
law that will compel the. County Superintendents to furnish the 
necessary data required to compile his reports. Under the law, 
where these officials fail to make reports within the time allowed, 
the State Superintendent is authorized to send an agent to the 
county to obtain the statistics, the cost therefor to be paid out of 
the salary of the delinquent. This law. has not, however, proved 
an effective remedy, for the reason that the salaries paid are small 
and are frequently paid up to the date that they are due. 
The average daily attendance at the schools for this. year, was 
296,765, a most gratifying increase over former years, while the 
total enrollment was 420,104. The average term taught was, 
eighty-six days, the longest term to this date; while the estimated 
value of school property of the State had increased to $2,380,319.61, 
there having been 265 schoolhouses built during the year. 
It is to be noted here that while the number of public schools: , 
opened and the number of teachers employed therein’ had been 
steadily increasing for seventeen years, there had been no increase 
in the number of private schools, the number in the ‘State remain- 
ing almost stationary, although there had been a substantial in- 
crease in the enrollment therein. 
The average salary paid the public-school teachers in 1890 was 
$31.24, evidencing an increase over former years. Superintendent 
Smith recommended’ that the school law be amended so that the 
school age would be eighteen instead of twenty-one years, a recom- 
mendation that has been repeatedly made in vain by some of Super- 
intendent Smith’s successors. 
ScHoo anv, Crvit Districts. 
An earnest recommendation was made that the school and civil 
districts be made coextensive in all of the counties, a plea that was 
not answered until during the administration of the present capa- 
ble Superintendent. At the date, of Superintendent Smith’s. re- 
port in many counties the school districts were in almost tnex- 
tricable confusion, due to the fact that in many cases the district 
directors undertook the responsibility of changing the districts,
-P-A-G-E-111
—102— 
while in others this duty was performed by the County Courts. 
He states that in the few counties where the districts are not co- 
extensive more trouble is: given the department than by the great 
majority of the counties which, have the better system. 
Touching the matter of graded schools, the following excerpt is 
taken from this report: “We have now adopted a graded course of 
study, which is being put into successful operation in many of the 
counties of the State. Those counties that have tried this course 
of study have found that it works admirably. One great advan- 
tage that it has is in securing better attendance upon the schools.” 
It was at this period in the State’s history that the agitation 
in behalf of county high schools commenced; and although the 
necessary legislation for the organization of these much-needed 
institutions was not passed for several years, it will be of interest 
to read how correctly Superintendent Smith estimated the ben- 
. efits to be derived therefrom, which experience has demonstrated 
to be the case. He said: 
“There is a growing demand throughout the State for the publie- 
school ‘curriculum to be extended. The only way this can be done 
with any success—yes, without injury to the common schools as 
they now exist—is by the establishment of county high schools; 
for if the public-school curriculum should be extended so that we 
would have, instead of a seven-years’ course in the primary schools, 
a ten-years’ course, the efficiency of the primary schools would be 
seriously retarded, 
Hiew ScHoois SvuacEstap. 
“The classes and grades would so multiply that no man, no 
matter what his qualifications are, could possibly discharge the 
duties of teacher as those duties shofild be discharged 5 but this can 
be met by permitting the counties desiring to do so to establish 
high schools~for the benefit of those pupils who have completed 
the public-school course as now required to be taught. This is also 
in keeping with the work of education in other States; and where 
these high schools have been established, they have been found to 
be successful and to pay. The only recommendation here made 
is that permission be granted to.the counties through their County ~
-P-A-G-E-112
—103— 
Courts to establish such high schools, and levy a tax for the benefit 
of the same if they see proper.” 
By an Act passed in 1891 two classes of schools were established, 
the primary and. the secondary. Municipal corporations are per- 
mitted to establish their own schools, and are authorized to add to 
the “amounts received from the State and county by direct taxes 
additional funds for their maintenance. . 
By subsequent legislation the appropriation to the State Normal 
College was increased to $15,000 per annum on condition that the 
State be allowed thirty-three scholarships of the value of $100: each 
and traveling expenses. It was provided that these scholarships 
be awarded in each senatorial district. upon competitive exam- _ 
ination. The Board of Education was also authorized to ex- 
pend $3,300 a year on the normal education of the negro teach- 
ers, but this appropriation was subsequently discontinued. The 
appropriation for State Normal institutes is, however, expended 
in behalf of the teachers of both races, and separate institutes are 
regularly held for the white and colored teachers. 
By 1890 in. almost every incorporated: town of the State there 
had been established a well-organized system of city schools by the 
election of a Board of Education by the Board of Mayor and Al- 
dermen and the levy of a corporate tax for school purposes: In 
many of these towns substantial and commodious schoolhouses, 
costing from $5,000 to $50,000, had been erected. By the present 
date (1906) there are very few incorporated towns of the State 
which have not availed themselves of the privileges of the law and 
organized separate city schools. . 
Vv 
Superintendent Smith was succeeded by Capt. W. R. Garrett in 
1891, and during the two years that he was at the head of the 
State’s public-school system it continued to prosper and. grow in 
public favor. Captain Garrett had been identified with the teach- 
ing profession of the State nearly all of his life, and had been.con- - 
nected with nearly all of the leading educational, enterprises and 
associations of his day, and was in every respect qualified to give SUPERINTENDENT GARRETT.
-P-A-G-E-113
—104— 
the State efficient service. That he did is evidenced by the. con- 
dition of the schools in 1893, when he'retired from office. 
The following are the summaries for 1893: Scholastic popula- 
tion, 701,229; enrollment, 447,938 ; average daily attendance, 308,- 
776. A decrease is shown in enrollment as compared with the 
previous year; but this was due largely to the failure of several 
County Superintendents to make the required reports, and in con- 
sequence the enrollment of a number of counties was eliminated 
from the totals.. There were in operation the following schools: 
White primary, 5,184; white secondary, 641; colored -primary, 
1,555; colored secondary, 24. Total, 7,404. Number of city 
schools, 156.. Grand total for the State, 7,560 schools, which’ were 
taught by 8,609 teachers, The average number of days taught was 
eighty-six; average compensation of the teachers, $31.10 per. 
month; average cost per pupil, 88 cents; number completing the 
first five grades, 1,398; number completing the course, 391. Dur- 
ing the year there were 245 schoolhouses erected, making the total 
number of buildings in the State 6,672, with a total estimated value 
of $2,582,144.87. ‘ 
The total income of the public schools for the year ending June 
30, 1893, was $2,342,645,10, made up from the following sources: 
Balance on hand July 1, 1892, $725,991.17; amount received from _ 
the State, $124,884.60; amount received from counties, $1,240,- 
838.68; amonnt received from other sources, $250,838.68. This 
was expended as follows: Salaries of teachers, $1,311,892.24; 
sites, buildings, and repairs, $147,733.31; furniture, fixtures, etc., 
$39,067.59 ; salaries of County Superintendents, $28,553.49; paid 
district clerks, $11,446; all other expenses, $109,105.53. Total 
expended, $1,647,799.06. Balance on hand, $694,846.04. 
ConFusion Fortows Act oF 1891. V . 
An Act was passed by the General Assembly of 1891 that brought 
confusion worse than ever before known to the system of school 
district management and supervision. Acting under authority of 
this Act, the County Courts of a large majority of the counties 
made each schoolhouse a separate school district, to the almost
-P-A-G-E-114
—105— 
complete demoralization of the system. The constituencies were 
necessarily made small, with the result that small men were very 
frequently elected directors—men who could not have been chosen 
probably by a larger constituency. Many of the directors chosen in 
this manner abused the system, abused their trust; and as a result 
it would not be an exaggeration to say that this plan cost the school 
fund of the State hundreds of thousands of dollars before it was 
finally abandoned ten years later. Speaking of the change at the 
time it was made, Superintendent Frank M. Smith, who, after 
the expiration of Captain Garrett’s term, was again called to the 
head of the school system, and to fill an office that for four years 
he had occupied with such conspicuous ability and fidelity, said : 
“The writer sees his error in recommending the passage of an 
Act giving the County Courts the power to change the lines of the 
school districts. Never did I for a moment think that any County 
Court would make each schoolhouse a school district. The civil 
district and the school district should be identical, and the State 
must come to this sooner or later. 
“There are many reasons why this is true. I have in mind a 
county that two years ago had fourteen. districts, That county 
now has seventy districts. It costs the State for blanks alone five 
times as much for that one county as it did formerly. Again, it 
will be impossible to establish secondary schools upon a perma- 
nent basis in such a county.” : 
ScHoot Orricers Act. 
At the convention held in 1894 the Public School Officers’ Asso- 
ciation indorsed this recommendation. Touching this action, Su- 
perintendent Smith adds: “This is by all means the most impor- 
tant recommendation made. The cutting up of school districts 
is doing us more damage than any other one thing. In some com- 
munities the schools that were prosperous have almost been de- 
stroyed. We cannot establish secondary .schools except in locali- 
ties where the population is dense or where we have large districts 
to draw from.” 
Pursuant to the recommendation of the State Superintendent, —
-P-A-G-E-115
—106— 
the Legislature subsequently passed an Act requiring all warrants 
except for teachers’ salaries to be approved by the County Super- 
intendent. It is, doubtless, no exaggeration to say that the chart 
sharps have annually robbed the public-school fund of Tennessee 
of an average of $10,000 since the establishment of the system. 
In recent years, under the watchful eye and careful supervision 
of Superintendent Mynders, this evil has been reduced to the min- 
imum, although it will never be fully eradicated until the district- 
director system gives place to effective and efficient county super- 
vision of all school funds. 
The Act above referred to was amended in 1905 so as to require 
certain school warrants to be approved by the Judge or Chairman 
and Clerk of the County Court. It is believed that this latter Act 
will do much to prevent waste of school funds in the purchase-of 
unnecessary and frequently absolutely useless school apparatus and 
school paraphernalia. 
In view. of the efforts made during the session of the Legislature 
of 1905 to repeal the wholesome and altogether wise law of 1903, 
making the school and civil districts coextensive (an agitation that 
_Tesulted in the passage of the bill in the House, but happily the 
State was saved from the demoralizing effects that followed similar 
legislation fourteen years before by the good sense and sound judg- 
ment of the Senate), it may not be out of place to state here the 
reasons given in 1894 why the school and civil districts should be 
coextensive—reasons that the experience of ten years have dem- 
onstrated to be sound and unanswerable: 
REASONS FOR Corxtensive Districts. 
“To secure in each, district as many schools—more or less as 
maybe found best—all of them, however, so organized as to be 
parts of a system adapted to the special wants of each community. 
“To end disputes about boundary lines. 
“To dispense with a large number of school officers, and to re~ 
duce largely the number of school elections. 
“To provide for each child going to the school which is most 
convenient and beneficial to him, considering his attainments and 
the studies he is pursuing.
-P-A-G-E-116
—107—' 
“To diminish the aggregate expenses of the schools. 
“To secure an efficient system of school supefvision for each 
district. . 
“To enable every district to establish a system of graded schools, 
thus giving to each district one or more secondary schools. 
“To secure for schools better teachers, and for teachers better 
compensation. 
“To improve schoolhouses, and. to provide them with what is 
needed for the use of the schools. / 
“To obtain more reliable statistics, and to secure and care for 
district libraries containing a greater variety and larger number 
of books than can be obtained under the small district plan.” 
" EXAMINATION OF SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The attention of the lawmakers was called to the defects in the 
system of county supervision by the State Superintendent in 1894, 
with the result that the Legislature of the following year passed 
an Act that has done much to raise the standard of the office of 
County Superintendent, and, by securing mofe efficient and capa- 
ble supervision, has done much to advance the cause of education. 
Better teachers have been secured, many incompetents have been ~ 
denied certificates, and the thorough wisdom of the law has been 
demonstrated in many ways. By the termis of this Act no person 
shall be qualified to hold the office of County Superintendent who 
has not first passed an approved examination to be held under 
such rules and regulations as are prescribed by the State Board of ~ 
Education. These examinations are held biennially, and as often 
in addition as may be necessary, in all the counties of the State 
on days appoitited by the State Board of Education. The exami- 
nation papers are transmitted to the board, and by the members 
opened; examined, and graded, and certificates issued to those mak- 
ing the requisite grade, entitling them to become candidates for 
Superintendent at the next election. Two classes of certificates 
are granted—one, the ordinary certificate, good for two years; the 
other, the life certificate, good for life, provided the holder is con- 
tinuously engaged in school work. The latter is granted only |
-P-A-G-E-117
—108— 
when an average grade of 90 is made by the applicant and his grade 
is not under 70 on any subject. / 
While the results from this law have been eminently satisfactory 
and more competent county supervision has been obtained, at the 
same time the best of talent cannot be secured or the most efficient 
service obtained until the County Superintendents are paid sala- 
ries commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of their 
office. © ‘ 
Frank M. Smith, for six years the official head of Tennessee’s 
public-school system, was succeeded as State Superintendent by 
8. G: Gilbreath, who held the office from 1895 to 189%, proving 
himself to be a most useful and thoroughly capable executive. 
SraTIsTros FOR 1895. 
The condition of the public schools of Tennessee in 1895 is 
shown in the following summaries of the Superintendent’s report 
of that year: Scholastic population, 720,623; increase for the year, 
12,425—about two-thirds white and one-third colored. Enroll- 
ment during the year: White, 377,626; colored, 100,499. Total, 
478,125, Average ‘daily attendance: White, 270,982; colored, 
67,348. Total, 338,330. In the average daily attendance the re- 
sults as compared with the» preceding year were very gratifying, 
showing a total gain of 25,648. Of this increase, 21,997 is cred- 
ited to the white and 3,651 to the colored schools. This was an 
increase of 6 per cent in ‘the enrollment and 8 per cent in the at- 
tendance. 
The average term was four months and four days, and the aver- 
age compensation paid to the teachers was $29.48, showing a ten- 
dency again on the part of the district directors to place the sala- 
ries of teachers at the lowest amount possible, regardless of the 
efficiency of the teacher.. This reduction in salaries was due also 
in .part to the change in the system which increased the number 
of districts and multiplied the number of school directors. 
The total value of the school property of the State for 1895 was 
placed at $3,092,502.95, which shows a substantial increase as com- 
pared with previous reports. During the year 181 schoolhouses 
were erected, bringing the total in the State to 6,892.
-P-A-G-E-118
—109— 
Receipts for the public schools from all sources for the year 
amounted to $2,190,998.20, which was disbursed as follows: Sal- 
aries of teachers, $1,294,937.48 ; sites, buildings, and repairs, $88,- 
041.02;. furniture and fixtures, $40,359.98; salaries of County 
Superintendents, $26,441.57; paid to district clerks, $12,023.59; 
all other expenses, $126,090.52. Total, $1,587,894.16—leaving a 
balance of $603,104.04 on hand. 
REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT GILBREATH. 
The last report of Superintendent Gilbreath, submitted in 1896, 
showed the scholastic population of the State to be 728,725, an 
increase for the year of 7,802; the enrollment was 481,585; the. 
average daily attendance, 338,176. There was a decréase in the . 
daily attendance of 154. There was a gain in the white attend- 
ance as compared with the previous year, but this was more than 
offset by the loss in the negro attendance. 
By this time the number of school districts had increased to_ 
about 3,100, showing the baneful effects of the legislation of 1891. 
Seven thousand and eight hundred teachers were employed in the 
county schools, the total for the State, including the teachers in the 
city schools, being 9,135. 
Touching the increase in school districts, the Superintendent 
’ says: “There has been an increase of 107 in the number of school 
districts, and a corresponding increase in the numberof district 
directors is noted. It is again urged that school and civil districts 
be made coextensive.” : 
There was a gain of 105 in the number of secondary schools 
opened during thé year. The average length of the term was four 
months and three days, a decrease of one day; while the average 
compensation paid the teachers was $29.41, or only 7 cents less 
than for the previous year. Notwithstanding the financial de- 
pression of that period, which affected T’ennessee in common with 
her sister States, there were 230 schoolhouses erected during the 
year, the number of houses in the State being 7,131, valued at 
$2,816,414.41. ‘Other property brought the total. value of public- 
school property to $3,080,944.93.

Instrrure Work. 
Reports from County Superintendents and institute conductors 
‘showed that the attendance at the teachers’ institutes was better 
during the season of 1896 than ever before. Not only was the at- 
tendance largely increased, but better work was done and more 
good was accomplished. : 
Speaking of the summer Normals, Superintendent Gilbreath 
said: “These summer Normals are becoming more and more train- 
‘ing schools for teachers, and are year by year losing their popular 
entertainment features. . Their growth has been steady and along - 
right lines. Heretofore the State Superintendents have tried to 
make the work more uniform, but until this year it was not found 
practicable to follow strictly the programmes marked out for them 
or to obey the rules and regulations prescribed for their govern- 
ment. But the work so ably planned by my predecessor has con- 
tinued to grow, until our summer Normals will compare favorably 
with those of other States having public-school systems much older 
than ours. That the teachers and school officers see the good re- 
sulting from them is evidenced by the growing demand for them 
and for professional instructors to conduct them. The demand for 
_these training schools should be encouraged by suitable legislation 
and liberal appropriation. In round numbers, 1,500 teachers at- 
tended these institutes an average of one month each. The cost 
of tuition to the State was $1 per month per teacher; and when 
it is remembered that they were conducted by the most efficient 
school workers in the State, no one will doubt but that the appro- 
priation justifies itself.” : 
Protection or Scxoon Funps. 
‘ 89% the General Assembly passed an Act that has long since 
Ay Senonstrat’ its wisdom, notwithstanding the specious objections 
then made to it that its enactment would be an unwarranted and 
an unwise concentration of authority in the hands of the State 
Superintendent and an interference with the autonomy of the coun- 
ties. This Act, briefly stated, gives to the State Superintendent 
authority to protect the school funds, either State or county.
-P-A-G-E-120
—l1l1— 
By its terms that official is authorized to institute suits, and 
incur attorneys’ fees in the prosecution thereof, to recover any 
school funds that have been wrongfully used or misapplied. He 
is also authorized to take legal steps to prevent the waste of such 
funds. Under the administration of the present incumbent the 
powers of this Act have been frequently invoked, and probably 
$100,000 as a result has been saved to the State and the counties 
thereof. In one suit more than half this sum was recovered. In 
other cases the injunction process of the courts has been invoked 
to prevent the payment of fraudulent claims upon the school funds. 
The constitutionality of the Act was vigorously attacked on vari- ~ 
ous grounds ; but in an able and exhaustive opinion rendered by the ~ 
Supreme Court at the December term, 1905, the constitutionality 
of the Act in every particular was sustained, the justice render- 
ing the opinion remarking that it was one of the wisest and most 
beneficial laws for the protection of the school funds ever placed’ 
on the statute books. , 
So far as official records of that period are concerned, the years 
1897 and 1898 are a blank in the school history of Tennessee. The 
Superintendent during that term published no record of his work, 
and, so far as: shown, no statistics were compiled. Just why this 
omission was made, no one has, to the writer’s knowledge, offered 
any satisfactory explanation. However, during this’ period some 
progress was made in the schools of the State, as is evidenced by 
the summaries contained in the report of Superintendent Morgan. 
C. Fitzpatrick, the efficient and energetic head of the State school 
system from 1899 to 1903. 
Counry Hien ScHoots.’ 
Notable legislation affecting the public schools was enacted by 
the Fitty-first General Assembly, two Acts in particular being of 
first importance. This Legislature passed what is termed a 
“County High School Bill,” which authorizes and empowers each - 
County Court in the State to elect a County Board of Education, 
with full authority to establish one or more high schools in each 
county. These schools, when established, are to be free to all stu-
-P-A-G-E-121
—112— 
dents of such county, under certain regulations to be prescribed 
by the County Board of Education. 
Under the provisions of this Act high schools have been estab- 
lished in seventeen counties. In fourteen counties these high 
schools have been established during the past. two years, and at 
the rate of increase noted during that period the day is probably 
not far distant when at least half of the countics of the State will 
provide a means of higher education for the children thereof. The 
first high school established under the provisions of this Act was 
that of Lake County. Since then the counties of Henry, Frank- 
* lin, Cumberland, Shelby, Meigs, Knox, Cheatham, Roane, Ander- 
son, Campbell, Hamilton, Washington, Cocke, and McMinn have 
established these institutions. Where the schools are established, 
a special tax is levied for their support and maintenance. In 
addition to the counties named, com:mittees have been appointed 
in others, charged with the duty of making an investigation and 
reporting as to the advisability of establishing the high schools. 
Text-Boox Law. 
An Act that completely revolutionized the method of selecting 
text-books for the public schools, known as the “Uniform Text- 
book Act,” was passed in 1899. Until that date the text-books 
had been selected by the district directors, with the result that fre- 
quently as many as a half dozen different sets of text-books. were 
in use in the same county. If a citizen moved from one end of 
the county to the other, or even across the imaginary line separat~ 
ing him from the adjoining school district, it was frequently neces- 
sary to purchase an, entire new set of books before his children - 
could enter school. The necessity for uniformity in the selecting 
of text-books had been frequently urged in the reports of State 
Superintendents, although none of them appear to have ever di- 
rectly suggested State uniformity. 
In response to a popular demand that there be established a uni- 
form system of selecting text-books, the Legislature of 1899 enacted 
the State law under which the same books are used in all sections 
of the State. Not only did this law provide uniform books and
-P-A-G-E-122
—113— 
in this respect save to the people of the State annually several- 
thousands of dollars, but under the contract which the text-book. 
commission made with the book dealers an average saving of not 
less than 25 per cent on the books purchased, as compared with 
text-books formerly in use, was made. 
The law provides that the Governor and State Superintendent, 
together with three members of the State Board of Education, shall 
constitute a text-book commission, whose duty it shall be to select 
and adopt a uniform system or series of text-books. for use in the 
primary and secondary public schools of the State and for use in 
the incorporated towns or cities in the high-grade common schools. 
The text-books so selected shall be used for a period of five years. 
All school-teachers and officers. in the schools mentioned are ex- 
pressly inhibited from using any text-book other than that selected 
and approved in the manner provided by this Act. The uniform . 
series includes the following branches of study: Orthography, read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, language lessons, 
history of Tennessee (containing the Constitution of the State), 
history of the United States (containing the Constitution of the 
United States), physiology and hygiene, elementary geology of 
Tennessee, elementary principles of agriculture, elements of alge- 
bra, elements of plane geometry, elements of natural philosophy, 
bookkeeping, elements of civil government, rhetoric, and higher 
English, and such other branches of study in addition to the fore- 
going as the commission may select and designate for use in the 
high-grade common schools. It is also provided that none of the 
text-books so selected shall contain anything of a sectarian or par- 
tisan character. 
PuroHase of Booxs. 
Under the Act the books submitted are referred to a subcom- 
mission composed of five members, not more than one of whom 
shall be selected from any congressional district, by whom the books 
are graded. Upon the report of the subcommission the text-book 
commission shall select the books and award the contract. No 
grade or report made upon the books by the subcommittee is con- 
clusive of the merits -of the book on the commission, which may 
reject the report of the former if deemed advisable.
-P-A-G-E-123
—114— 
After the selection of the books is made, it is then the duty of 
the Attorney-general of the State to draw a contract between the 
commission and the several firms to whom awards are made in ac- 
cordance with the terms of the Act. 
The first award or contract made under the terms of this Act 
took effect on the opening of the schools in September, 1899; so 
that the law has been in operation for more than seven years. It 
has accomplished the purposes for which it was enacted. The chil- 
dren of the State now purchase their books for an average of 40 
per cent less than before the law was passed; in nearly every in- 
stance the book is superior in matter and make-up to those selected 
under the old system; and, best of all, the law guarantees abso- 
lute uniformity. The law has demonstrated the wisdom and fore- 
sight of those who urged its passage, and a suggestion of its repeal 
- would meet with strenuous protests both from school-teachers and 
officers and the people also. 
Contract or 1904. 
Under the provisions of the law the first contract expired in 
1904. After long and laborious sessions of both the subcommis- 
sion and the State commission, new contracts to run until 1909 
were awarded. In many instances the books selected at the last 
award are much lower in price than those selected in 1899; but 
it must be said in justice to the first commission that their success- 
ors had the.advantage of five years of experience. A saving of 
about 14 per cent as compared with the prices of 1899 was made 
in the second award, which, added to the first saving, makes the 
text-books cost the children of the State about 40 per cent less 
than they did under the old system. It is estimated that text- 
books to the amount of $200,000 per annum are annually purchased 
in this State; hence the saving in cost, to say nothing of the ad- 
vantages of uniformity and better text-books, is a considerable one. 
According to the report of 1899, the scholastic population of the 
State was 760,162, the enrollment was 499,845, and the average 
‘daily attendance was 352,734. There being no reports made in 
1897 and 1898, no comparisons with these years is possible; but
-P-A-G-E-124
—115— 
the above statistics show a gain in enrollment over 1896 of 18,260, 
and in the average daily attendance of 14,558. A gratifying fea- 
ture of the enrollment statistics is that there was a substantial 
gain in the number enrolled in the higher grades, indicating that. . 
the children were going to school longer than formerly. 
STATISTICS FoR 1899. 
The average number of days taught in 1899 was eighty-nine; 
the average compensation of the teachers, $28.42; the average cost 
of tuition per pupil per month, 74 cents. Diplomas were awarded 
to 1,014 pupils completing the fifth grade and to 495 completing 
the public-school course. During the year there were, erected 185 
schoolhouses, of which only seven were of log, the balance being 
of frame, except four of stone or brick. The estimated value of 
the 7,076 schoolhouses in the State was $3,614,193, and the total 
estimated value of all public-school property in the State was $3,- 
935,670.83. : 
During the year 10,312 teachers were examined, of whom 9,497 
received certificates to teach. ‘he total receipts of the schools 
were $2,367,927.35, which was expended as follows: Salaries of 
teachers, $1,205,330.55; sites, buildings, and repairs, $67,358.37 ; 
furniture and fixtures, $37,870.81; paid County Superintendents, 
$26,767.98; paid district clerks, $12,472.85; all other expenses; 
$278,512.54; balance, $708,376.12. 
By the revenue Act. of 1887 the State levy for: school purposes 
was made 15 cents on the-$100 instead of 10 cents. Under the law 
this fund all remains in the county, as does the taxes derived from 
the State levy on poll taxes, and is prorated to the school districts 
just as are funds raised by county levy. - 
The appropriation for the State Normal College was also in- 
. creased from $15,000 to $20,000, where it remained for several 
years. In 1905 the Legislature appropriated $250,000 to this in- 
stitution, to be paid in ten equal installments of $25,000. This_ 
appropriation was made in order that the institution could receive 
the bulk of the Peabody Fund as an endowment.. The donation 
‘of this fund was conditioned on the State making an appropria-
-P-A-G-E-125
—116— 
tion of $250,000 and upon a similar appropriation by Nashville 
and the county of Davidson. The trustees declined to accept the 
. State appropriation as a compliance with the terms of the pro- 
posed donation; therefore this institution did not receive any 
funds from the State for. the years 1905 and 1906. 
Progress was made in all lines of educational endeavor during 
the year ending June 30, 1900. The average number of days 
taught increased to four months and sixteen days; the scholastic 
enrollment increased to 485,354; the average daily attendance in- 
creased to 338,566. Of the number enrolled, 35,000 only were in 
grades above the fifth. The average compensation of the teachers 
was $31.16, a slight gain; while there were erected during the year 
185 schoolhouses. 
‘VALUE Or ScHOOL PROPERTY. 
The value of the school property of the State is placed at $3,- 
063,567, while the year before it was estimated at about $900,000 
more than this. It is evident that the figures for 1899 were in- 
correct; and while-it is difficult to obtain accurate reports from all 
necessary sources of information, there is reason to believe that the 
figures here quoted are much nearer correct than those given in 
the previous year. This opinion is borne out by subsequent re- 
ports of Superintendent Fitzpatrick. In some way, either by error 
in addition in the State Superintendent’s office or through the care- 
lessness of the County Superintendents, a mistake of nearly $1,- 
000,000 was made in the valuation for 1899. : 
In the report of 1900 Superintendent Fitzpatrick made a strong 
appeal to the Legislature for an amendment to the law changing 
the school age from twenty-one to eighteen years, just as it was 
when the system was established. He offered the following substan- 
tial reason for this change: 
“Té our school age was from six to eighteen years, our showing 
-would then be correct and gratifying. We are charged now with 
a scholastic population of 768,843 and a total enrollment of 485, 
354, showing that only about three-fifths of our scholastic popu- 
lation are enrolled. If we deduct from the total population of
-P-A-G-E-126
—117— 
768,843 the many thousands in the State under twenty-one years 
of age who have long since completed the public-school course, 
- then it will be seen that our percentage of enrollment of those who 
are properly and in fact school students is very large. 
“Tf the law was changed, reducing the maximum from twenty- 
one to eighteen years, this would not alter conditions in the State 
or prohibit. many who now attend school from completing the 
public-school course. I make this suggestion and call attention to 
these figures in order that educational conditions may be presented 
to the world just as they are. A person reading our reports, not 
familiar with the facts, is led to believe that about 300,000 children 
of free-school age are not enrolled in the public school, when the 
facts are that a large majority of those enumerated and not enrolled 
have either completed the public-school course, gone into other 
schools, or abandoned going to school altogether.” 
SpecraL ScHoort Districts. 
This statement is incorporated here, not by way of a suggestion 
_that such a change ought to be made, but because in justice to 
the State it is believed that it should-be given to the public in order 
that people not familiar with conditions here who may ‘see’ this ° 
article will-understand why there is such an apparently large dif- 
ference between the scholastic population and.the enrollment and 
attendance statistics. What was said six years ago applies with 
equal force now. 
At the meeting of the Public School Officers’ Association at 
Nashville in 1900 the following were among the recommendations 
made: 
“The Legislature should repeal all Acts creating special school 
districts and those authorizing County Courts to create new dis- 
tricts. The civil district and school district should be coextensive, 
and this can be accomplished by one general Act, the passage of 
which we urge. 
“The Legislature should enact a general law ‘repealing all ex- 
_ isting laws concerning the election of school directors, and then 
provide that directors be elected biennially in August; that they
-P-A-G-E-127
—118s— 
qualify not later than September 1; and in specific terms state the 
duties and powers of directors, and with special reference to the 
selection of teachers and the management of schools.” 
If one should go over the recommendations for changes and im- 
provements in the public-school laws which have been made by this 
association and then examine the school legislation of the State, 
he would doubtless be surprised to find how many good laws this. 
association has originated or stood sponsor for, and the school sys- 
tem would be vastly improved: if more of the recomniendations 
made by the association had been incorporated into our laws. 
The progress of the public-school system and the difficulties un-_ 
der which the people of Tennessee have labored in bringing it to its 
present high standard are ably stated in the preface to Superintend- 
ent Fitzpatrick’s report for 1901: : 
Srrvation In 1901. 
“The public-school system as it exists in Tennessee to-day was- 
established since the War between the States, and its progress and 
development, while seemingly slow, has been retarded at every step 
by conditions in the State at the close of the war. That confligt” 
. destroyed property, devastated homes and plantations, and left the 
people financially unable to undertake the establishment of a great 
. system of education. It was a wise Legislature and the Repre- 
sentatives of a great people that planned our present system and 
enacted it into law a third of a century ago—an Act which was the 
real beginning of public free education in Tennessee. Not only 
.did the citizens of. the State at that time feel their inability from a 
financial standpoint to do more than was contemplated in the orig- 
inal Act, but they realized that. almost 100,000 children of their 
former slaves were charges of the State, for whom some Provision 
should be made. 
“Not only, therefore, did the taxpayers, through # their Repre- . 
sentatives, provide a free system of education for their own: chil- 
dren, but they guaranteed like schools and equal opportunities te 
the unfortunate children of the colored race. That was a serious 
problem then, and the weight of this responsibility and the doubt ©
-P-A-G-E-128
—119— 
in the public mind as to what should be done for the colored chil- 
dren has not lessened with the years. The public schools of Ten- 
nessee are equal to those of any Southern State; and the results 
of our system taken into consideration, the conditions existing 
when it was first established, the large number of nontaxpaying 
colored citizens provided for, and our taxable property, will com- 
pare favorably in money spent, work performed, and general re- 
sults shown with many States in the Union. 
-“Those who have aspired to criticise Tennessee’s public schools 
have disregarded the many thousands of helpless, moneyless col- 
ored citizens and their offspring, who are largely responsible for the 
unfavorable showing made in our statistical tables. 
By Drrect TaxaTion. 
“Our public schools are supported almost entirely by direct tax~ 
ation of the people, and every taxpayer contributes his pro rata of 
the expenses of the system. We have neither lands nor endow- 
ments, and our schools are a continual charge upon the property 
holders ‘of the State. National legislation has not increased the 
value of our tax-producing property or encouraged the investment 
of capital and the building of large properties in this State, from 
which we could expect to receive annually large sums of money, 
as elsewhere.” 
The following statistics are taken from the report from which - 
the above is quoted: Scholastic population—white, 559,349; col- 
ored, 188,173. Total, 753,198. Number of pupils enrolled dur- 
ing the year—white, 385,649; colored, 103,705. Total, 488,656. 
The average daily attendance of white pupils was 270,662, and of- 
negro children 67,904, making the total average daily attendance 
338,556—an increase as compared with the previous year, notwith- 
standing the fact that there was a decrease in the number of ne- 
groes attending the public schools. About 36,000 were enrolled 
in the grades above the fifth. . 
The average number of days schoo] was taught was ninety-three, as 
_ compared with ninety-six the year before. The decrease was due 
-in part to the fact that in many districts. the schools were short-
-P-A-G-E-129
—120— 
ened in order to save funds for the payment of debts which had 
been contracted in former years. ‘The average compensation of the 
teachers was only $28.60, as compared with $31.16 for the previous 
year—a rather discouraging feature, because all must recognize 
that the best talent cannot be secured to teach in the public schools 
if reasonable salaries are not paid. At the salary above mentioned 
the teachers, on an average, received less than $130 for the school 
term of 1901. / 
During the year 205 schoolhouses were erected, an increase of 
twenty as compared with 1900, making the total number of hetises 
in the State 7,241, which were valued at $3,337,532.07, the total 
value of the school property of the State being estimated at $3,691,- 
068.7%, an increase of about $600,000 as compared with the pre- 
vious year. 
Recxtprs For 1901. 
The receipts for the public schools of the State for the year 
were as follows: From permanent school fund, $140,305.06; bal- 
ance on hand, $736,049.26; received from State school taxes, $133,- 
281.80; received from counties, $1,631,588.98; received from other 
sources, $114,103.47. Total, $2,615,033.51. 
Disbursements: Salaries of teachers, $1,324,690.05 ; school sites, 
buildings, and repairs, $102,386.93; furniture, fixtures, ete., $29,- 
277.72; salaries of County Superintendents, $27,535.13; district 
* clerks, $12,896.42 ; all other sources, $314,717.34; balance on hand, 
$812,535.49. In addition, the city schools received during the 
year $627,142.54 and paid out $562,019.68. The total value of 
city school property is given at $1,931,490.56, an increase for the 
‘year of about $300,000. 
By comparison with the above, the following statistics for 1902 
show that during the year there was a gratifying advancement in 
all lines of school endeavor: Population, 1902, 771,965; number 
of pupils enrolled, 484,663; average daily attendance, 341,537; en- 
rolled in grades above the fifth, 35,000. Total number of teachers 
employed, 9,689; average length of school term, ninety-five days 
(a gain of two days) ; average compensation of teachers per month, 
$28.86 ; number of certificates issued to pupils completing the fifth

grade, 1,964. During the year there were erected 206 school- 
houses; making the total number in the State 7,333, valued at 
$3,858,706.43 ; and the total school property was valued at $4,179,- 
123.78, an increase for the year of nearly $500,000. The total re- 
ceipts of the schools for the year, less the balance on hand at the 
‘beginning of the year, were $1,883,744; expenditures, $1, 854,- 
394.72. 
iy his report for 1902 Superintendent Fitzpatrick indorses the 
reéomimendations formerly made by his predecessors, that the school 
: vil. districts be made coextensive. More liberal appropri- 
and increased tax levies for the schools are also urged. At- 
‘is called to the meager salaries paid to the teachers, and ~ 
ope is expressed that the Legislature and the County Courts 
will'take such action looking to an increase in public school rev- 
enues as will justify the payment of larger salaries to the teach- 
ers and County Superintendents.   
     
      
GQUBURNATORIAL CAMPAIGN OF 1902. 
"The: gubernatorial campaign of 1902 was remarkable in that it 
was the:first campaign in the history of the State where the public 
schools were made the dominant issue. James B.. Frazier, the 
Democratic candidate and future Governor, made the public schools 
the ‘paramount theme in his speeches all over the State; and as & 
result;he aroused a general public interest in the question of educa- 
tion-such as had never before been manifested to the same degree 
” by the people of Tennessee. 
The theme of all his speeches was an earnest and eloquent plea 
for: better educational facilities for the boys and girls of Tennes- 
see: “He urged that the schools of the most remote sections be — 
made equal to those conducted in the centers of population. This 
campaign: aroused a sentiment in favor of education that bore fruit 
_ in the next General Assembly, which convened in January, 1903. 
Excepting alone the Legislature of 1873, which gave birth to our 
splendid plan of free education, the General Assembly of 1903 was 
“probably ‘more generous in dealing with the common-school inter- 
ests than any that ever sat in Tennessee. The wise recommenda-

tions.of former Superintendents and the then State Superintend- 
ent, 8. A. Mynders, to the effect that the school and civil districts 
be made coextensive, were favorably acted upon, and a bill to this 
effect passed with little opposition. 
Governor Frazizr’s Mussacn. 
In his message to the Legislature, Governor Frazier earnestly 
urged that something be done to lengthen the school term and 
provide better means of education for those living in the rural sec- 
tions of the State. As. part-of this plan he recommended that 
all the surplus remaining in the State treasury at the end of the 
year, less 10 per cent to go to the sinking fund for the retirement 
of the interest-bearing indebtedness of the State, be distributed 
pro rata to the several counties of the State. 
The Governor’s recommendations were carried into the statute 
books, and as a result of this law there was distributed ‘to the 
schools of the State on January 1, 1904, the sum of $270,000, 
which, added to the interest on the imaginary school fund, made 
_ & total of over $420,000 paid directly from the treasury of the 
State. This was almost $1 per capita to the children enrolled 
according to the reports of the previous year. 
Tennessee was blessed with bounteous crops, abundant harvests, 
and industrial prosperity during the year 1904, with the result 
that taxes were more promptly paid and more closely collected than 
ever before; so that on January 1, 1905, the balance in the State 
treasury for distribution among the public schools amounted to the 
magnificent sum of $500,000. 
This was by far the Jargest sum ever appropriated direct from the 
State treasury to the public schools, and was an amount. beyond the 
dreams of the most optimistic supporters of the bill to divert the 
surplus from the sinking fund to the school fund. This act of 
generosity to the public schools was a splendid tribute to the patri- 
otism and liberality of the people of the State and the highest evi- 
dence of their love for and interest in the cause of popular educa- 
tion. This sum alone was more*than five times the annual inter- 
est on the original school fund of $1,500,000, which was practically
-P-A-G-E-134
—123— 
all that the State contributed to the support of the schools before’ 
the war. Added to the interest on the permanent fund, and it made 
a total of nearly $650,000, or nearly $1 per capita to the children 
of school age and more than $1.75 to the children enrolled in the 
public schools. 
SUPERINTENDENT MyNDERS. 
Governor Frazier did not manifest his interest“in the cause of 
popular education alone by recommending the enactment. of wise 
and. beneficent laws, but he selected for the head of the department 
a teacher who had spent practically his entire life in school work. 
He appointed Capt. Seymour A. Mynders, of Jackson, Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction. Superintendent Mynders, before 
‘his appointment, was superintendent of the Jackson ‘city schools. 
He had served twenty years as instructor in institute work, and was 
in every respect qualified for the position to which he was ap- 
pointed. His interest in and zeal for the public schools of the 
State arnounts to a passion. His whole ambition has been to see 
the improvement of the public schools. His every energy has been 
directed toward that end. With zeal and enthusiasm and well- 
directed energies he has sought the advancement and promotion 
of the public-school interests of Tennessee every day that he has 
been Superintendent. 
Conditions existing less than a year after he had qualified | as 
Superintendent are thus described by Superintendent Mynders in 
his first annual: report: . ~ 
“©The report will show an increase of 4,076 in scholastic popu- 
lation. The increase in the number of pupils enrolled during the 
year was 8,113, with an average daily attendance of 1,094.over that 
of the previous year. By reference to. the tables showing the en- 
rollment by grades it will be found that there has been a decided : 
increase in the higher or secondary grades. This shows that the 
pupils are remaining in school longer than heretofore. 
Report or. 1903. 
“Especial attention is called to the miscellaneous table, which . 
shows an average compensation of teachers per month of $37.30,
-P-A-G-E-135
—124— 
an increase of $8.44 per month over the previous year. This also 
shows the number completing the fifth grade and receiving certifi- © 
cates to be nearly double that of last year. The fact that the 
school-property table does not show a larger number of school 
buildings than the previous year is accounted for largely by the 
fact that under the new district law many districts were abolished, 
and the property is not given in this report. 
“The provision of the law making school and civil districts co- 
extensive and fixing a minimum limit on scholastic population for 
the maintenance of the school was to force the consolidation of the 
small, weak schools, and thus provide schools large enough to draw 
sufficient money to run longer terms and employ more competent 
teachers. Then, again, it is intended that the districts having a_ 
number of schools should establish a system similar to the cities— 
that is, they should declare all the schools primary except one cen- 
tral one, and this should be a.secondary school for the entire dis- 
trict. This will open a way for the successful grading of schools. 
I estimate that under this Act at least 1,000 small, weak schools 
have been discontinued.” . 
The following ‘statistics are taken from the report of 1903: 
Scholastic population, 776,041; pupils enrolled during the year, 
492,779; average daily attendance, 342,631 ; enrolled above the fifth 
grade, 43,000; average number of days taught, 96; average com- 
pensation of teachers per month, $37.30; number of certificates to 
pupils completing the school course, 3,425; diplomas to pupils com- 
pleting the public-school course, 1,036. During the year 136 
schoolhouses were erected, and it is worthy of note that not one 
of them was built of logs. The total value of school property 
shows an apparent decrease of about $100,000; but this is ex- 
plained in the excerpts above quoted, and_was due to the new dis- 
trict law. 
RECEIPTS FOR 1903. 
The total receipts of the schools were $2,093,724.16, a gain of 
over $200,000 as compared with the previous year. Of this amount 
$1,741,427.98 was paid out in salaries to teachers, the largest: sum 
“ever expended in one year for that purpose. The total scholastic
-P-A-G-E-136
—195— 
population of the cities maintaining a ‘separate system in 1903 was 
59,354, the total enrollment was 42,787, the average term was 177 
days, and the average compensation paid to the teachers was $52.75 
per. month. 
In 1903: the Legislature passed an Act creating a County Board 
of Education. for Montgomery County, to be composed of one mem- 
ber from each civil district, and the old boards of district directors 
were abolished. The county instead of the district was made the 
unit for taxation and school government. Under this plan every 
school in the county jis on an equal footing, the schools are all open 
for the same length of time, and the children of every section have ~ 
educational advantages equal to those enjoyed by the-children of 
any other section of the county. ‘The wisdom of the law has been 
thoroughly demonstrated, as is evidenced by the following report of 
the County Superintendent made in 1904: 
County Boarp oF “Epveation. 
“The longer school term is permanent under the management 
of the County Board of Education. It will be eight months a year 
so long as the tax levy and collection for school purposes are what 
they-now. are, and-the additional money coming from the State 
will be used to increase the teachers’ salaries in order -to employ 
none but’ the real teacher for every community. 
“Tt.is also gratifying to report that our teachers find much more 
convenience in the county system. It has done everything claimed 
for the system, and even more. All the schools open the same day, 
run the same number of days, and close with a uniform examina- 
tion for.the promotion of pupils on the same day. Hence for the 
first time the teachers are able to work a uniform course of study.” 
In 1905 substantially the provisions of this Act were extended 
to thé county of Lauderdale, and reports from there are to the effect 
that the system of county government is becoming as popular and 
-working as admirably as it has in Montgomery County. Ifthe next 
Legislature will follow the recommendations of the.State Superin- 
tendent. and extend the system to every county in the State, the 
prediction is made that within two years the average school term 
for the State will increase by a full month.
-P-A-G-E-137
—126— 
The statistics furnished by the Superintendent’s annual report 
for 1904 furnish a just cause for encouragement. The average 
school term increased from 95. days to 103 days, while the enroll- 
“ment was 9,554 more than for 1903 and 17,667 more than for 1902. 
The increase in scholastic population for the two years was only 
4,757. In other words, in these two years the enrollment in- 
creased four times as fast as the scholastic population. In 1902 
there were in the eighth grade and above 7,852; two years later 
there were 16,013, or an increase of 103 per cent. In 1902 only 
829 diplomas were issued to pupils completing the public-school 
course; in 1904 the number was 1,774. The average comipensation 
of the teachers increased during the year from $37.30 to $38.90. 
The-receipts of the public schools from all sources for 1904 were 
$2,741,188.59, which, added to the balance on hand at the close of 
the previous year, gave the schools an income of $3,647,494.17, an 
amount larger by nearly $1,000,000 than the income two years 
before. : 
Goop ScHooLHovses. 
One of the most hopeful signs of advance in educational senti- 
ment in the State was the erection of a large number of good, sub- 
stantial public-school buildings during the year ending June 30, 
1904. There was expended in the erection of school buildings 
alone $444,799.41. This sum does not include the amounts ex- 
pended for buildings in the cities. : . 
For the six years ending June 30, 1905, the increase in the scho- 
lastic population of the State was very small, but the enrollment 
in the public schools increased by 22,760. For the year it increased 
5,093, while the daily average attendance showed a gain of 3,806. 
_ Especial attention is directed to the increase in the value of school 
property. In 1902 the school property of the State was valued 
at $4,179,123. The report for 1905 shows the estimated value 
thereof to be $5,171,753, an increase in three years of $992,630, or - 
nearly 25 per cent. These figures do not, of course, include the 
buildings which were erected during this time by the municipali- 
ties of the State. The average salaries of the school-teachers in 
the rural sections increased from $28.96 in 1902 to $34.87. in 1905.
-P-A-G-E-138
—127— 
The most notable improvement, however, during the three’ years 
was in the increase in school revenues. In 1902 the receipts of the 
schools of the State amounted to $1,883,744; while for the year 
ending June 30, 1905, the total receipts were $3,101,947, an in- 
crease of over $1,100,000, or more than 50 per cent. The increase 
in the average term taught was 18 days, the number of days school 
in 1905 being 113, the largest by a month ever known in the his- 
tory of the system. The average term for 1906 was more than six 
months. 
Epucational CAMPatIen. 
As the result of a mecting of the Superintendents, directors, and 
citizens from all parts of the State held in Nashville in April, 1903, 
a great educational campaign was planned. It was then decided 
to undertake a thorough campaign of the State for better schools, 
more money, better buildings, and better teachers. This campaign 
was carried into all parts of the State, and educational gatherings 
were held in every county. The result was that a healthy and even - 
enthusiastic public sentiment in favor of better educational facili- 
ties was aroused. 
In East Tennessee a campaign committee was organized, and 
during the summer and fall of 1905 educational gatherings were - 
held in every county of that division, the State Superintendent 
attending and participating in nearly all of the meetings. The 
meetings were attended by crowds of from 600 to 5,000 people, 
and the greatest interest and enthusiasm were everywhere mani- . 
fested for the cause. The Southern Education Board gave material: 
aid to the work hy furnishing moncy to assist in carrying on the 
campaign. Where it was possible, prominent speakers addressed 
the County Courts in behalf of improved educational facilities. 
The campaign begun in Hast Tennessee and carried on with such - 
splendid resylts was in the summer and autumn of 1906 carried 
into the Western and Middle Divisions of the State, meetings be- 
ing held in every county in those sections, which were attended in 
-all places by large and enthusiastic crowds. 
At the close of the campaign in these sections another campaign 
in East Tennessee was made. It is estimated that altogether 100,-
-P-A-G-E-139
—128— 
000 people attended the educational meetings during 1906. Nearly 
al: the counties were personally visited by the State Superintendent, 
and the result has been a genuine educational revival that resulted 
in the County Courts of twenty-five counties increasing the tax 
rate for schools, while several authorized the erection and main- 
tenance of adequate high schools. 
” LaGisLaTion oF 1903. 
The General Assembly of 1905 proved itself to be thoroughly 
alive to the interests of the public schools. The surplus Act of 
two years before was amended so as to limit the amount thereun- 
der to be‘apportioried to the schools of the State to $250,000. In 
addition, the Act’ provides that $50,000 shall be annually appro- 
priated. to lengthen the school term: to six months in the districts 
' where the term is less ‘than that. 
In addition, however, the Act encourages local aid to the schools 
by providing, in substance, that no county shall receive any portion 
of this fund of $50,000 unless it shall first levy a tax of 25 cents 
on the $100 of school property in addition to the State levy of 15 
cents. ‘The first apportionment was made on January 1, 1906, 
thirty-five counties participating. The fund was sufficient to raise 
the average term in every one of these counties to six months. 
Since that time the County Courts of twenty-five counties have 
levied as much as 25 cents school tax; so that sixty counties par- 
ticipated ‘in the distribution of January 1, 1907. Should this 
fund be increased to $100,000, as advocated by the author, Sen- 
ator E. G. Tollett, and Superintendent Mynders, sufficient funds 
will be provided’ to guarantee six months’ school or over in every 
one of the counties levying the requisite amount of taxes to share 
in the fund. 
An Act was passed by the Fifty-fourth General Assembly further 
safeguarding the’ issuance of warrants by district school directors 
by requiring that all warrants for the purchase of maps, charts, 
libraries, and other school furniture or apparatus shall he signed 
by the County Judge or Chairman. of the County Court and the 
Clerk of ‘the County Court before being presented to the Trustee
-P-A-G-E-140
—~129— 
for payment. The Trustee is inhibited from the payment of any 
‘of said warrants unless signed as above required. 
Computsory EDUCATION. 
An Act was also passed by the Legislature of 1905 providing a 
system of compulsory education for the counties of Union and 
Claiborne. While this Act has not been given a fair trial and 
time has demonstrated that the penalty clause is insufficient to 
enforce compliance with its provisions, in the main the results have 
been satisfactory, and the attendance on the public schools would 
doubtless have been materially increased but for a smallpox epi- 
demic. 
It is interesting in this connection to note the. different ‘spirit 
now manifested toward the public schools from that which existed 
among the people and the County Courts when the system was . 
established thirty-three years ago. The Act organizing the sys- 
tem made a tax levy of 10 cents. Only twenty-nine counties lev- 
ied additional taxes. The State levy is now 15 cents, and every 
county in the State levies a supplemental tax both on property 
and.on polls, and a majority on privileges. In 1878 the State dis- 
_ tributed about $150,000, the interest.on the permanent fund to 
the schools annually. 
Now the State annually distributes $450,000 from the treasury 
to the public schools. In addition, the Legislature of 1905 made 
an appropriation of $25,000 for the University of Tennessee, the 
first direct legislative aid ever given by the State to that splen- 
did institution. For the four years ending January 1, 1907, the 
State has distributed from the treasury to the common schools a 
sum approximating $1,970,000. This does not include the receipts 
from the State tax levy of 15 cents or the $1 levy on each poll, 
all of which remains in the county where collected for the support 
of the schools. 
Stare ScHoou. Funps. 
The State levy will bring to the schools, approximately, $600,000 
per annum, and the poll tax about $100,000, making a total of
-P-A-G-E-141
_—130— 
about $700,000 per year, to say nothing of the portion of mer- 
chants’ privilege taxes which accrues to the State fund. In four 
years this would dmount to $2,800,000, which, added to the amount 
from direct appropriation and interest on the school fund, brings 
the total during the past four years to almost, if not quite, $5,000,- 
000, or an average of $1,250,000 per annum, or more than fifteen 
times the interest on the original school fund of $1,500,000. 
It is a sum several times the interest that would, have accrued 
on the school fund if every acre of land set apart for educational 
purposes had then been sold at the market value and every dollar 
had been properly husbanded and administered. Tennessee has 
been slow to establish a school system; it was slow in doing justice 
to the educational interests; but its generosity in recent years 
should silence in a measure at least criticism of its penuriousness 
and inefficiency in providing a system of free schools in the early 
days of its history. 
Averace Tax Levy. 
Thirty years ago less than half of the counties levied a supple- 
mental school tax, dnd in those which made the levy the average 
rate was 184 cents, which would make the average at that time 
. for the State less than 10 cents, exclusive of the State levy, and, in- 
cluding that, less than 20 cents. In 1906 the average school levy 
in the ninety-six counties of the State, county and State, was 374 
cents on the $100, while the amount distributed by the State out 
of the treasury is equal to a levy of an additional 10 cents; so that 
the taxpayers of Tennessee now contribute on the average nearly 
50 cents per annum per $100 of taxable values to the support of 
the public schools; for it must be remembered that the permanent | 
“fund is only an imaginary one, and the interest thereon is annually 
appropriated from the State treasury, and is, after all, directly 
contributed by the people of the State. , 
These figures do not take into consideration the $300,000 which 
the municipalities of the State receive from taxes levied upon the 
property situate therein for the support of the schools. If this 
sum were added to the amount above enumerated, the total would 
represent an average tax levy of over’50 cents. Certainly Tennes-
-P-A-G-E-142
—131— 
_seans have abundant cause to be proud of the record their State 
has made in educational advancement during the past three decades, 
and specially should they view with satisfaction the magnificent 
strides made during the past quadrennium. 
It is not so much now a question of additional funds, but of 
improving the system so that there will be an absolute guarantee 
that every dollar of the State’s magnificent school revenues may 
be properly and economically applied. If the Legislature will but 
make the county the unit of administration instead of the school 
“district, establish County Boards of Education, pass a minimum , 
salary law for County Superintendents, and increase the powers 
of the State Superintendent, especially with reference to the exami- 
nation and licensing of teachers, it will be but a brief period until 
Tennessée’s public-school system will be second to none in this glo- 
rious land of freedom and equal opportunities. May an aroused 
and enlightened public sentiment hasten that day. y

The Superintendent’s annual report for 1876 is the first that 
gives complete educational statistics of the State; therefore the 
great progress which thé State has made during the thirty years 
ending with the report of 1906 can best be realized by showing in 
parallel columns conditions as they existed then and now. These

In making comparisons in enrollment and population it should 
be remarked that in 1876 the scholastic ages were from six ‘to. 
eighteen years; now they are six to twenty-one years; so that in

CAUSE FOR CONGRATULATION. 
Thus during @ period of: “thirty years the enrollment in ‘the 
schools has increased by nearly 250 per cent; the per cent ‘of aver- 
age attendance to enrollment has increased, notwithstanding the, 
lengthening of the school ages; the ‘average compensation of the 
- teachers has inéreased almost 20 per cent; the value of school. 
property has increased over 500 per’ cent; the jJength of the term 
taught has increased from less than four to over six months; the 
average tax levy for all the. State has increased to 374 cents from. 
an average of 23 cents for less than half of the State; the annual 
receipts have grown from tess than $1,000,000 to 1 more than $3,- 
500,000. : 
In the contemplation © of the facts revealed by these statistics 
~ we certainly have no cause to feel ashamed, and no reason is afforded 
for doubting the capacity, ability, and patriotism of the people ‘to 
meet any emergency and accomplish any result that can be attained 
by the people of any other Commonwealth. These figures are a 
lasting testimonial] to the sound judgment, good sense, and patriot- 
ism displayed by those who have directed the school affairs. of the. 
State during the past three decades, and are a monument to the. 
wisdom of the members of the General Assembly of 1873 which 
planned and inaugurated our present system.

existed at various periods of the State’s history is likewise that. of- 
the writer, and represents his convictions formed only after a most 
thorough and painstaking investigation and the most careful re- 
search. They were inspired alone by a patriotic impulse and an
-P-A-G-E-146
—135— 
earnest desire to better the great cause of popular education in the 
proud old “ Volunteer State.” 
If this account shall cause any critic of our school system to — 
realize how great has been the burden of our people, and yet how 
generously they have educated not only their own, but the children 
of their former slaves; if it shall inspire our people to yet greater _ 
efforts and our legislators and County Courts to still more generous 
response to the demands for additional funds; if the suggestions 
herein made shall prove of value to those who really desire the im- 
provement of our system, then the writer will be satisfied that he 
has not labored altogether in vain. It is sincerely hoped that the 
foregoing may prove of interest and value to those who desire a 
knowledge of the history and advancement of the cause of popu- 
lar education. 
Our State has accomplished much for education in the past ; 
but there is much, very much, yet to be done. Many improvements 
are needed; more money is necessary; better attendance upon our 
schools must be secured. 
In an art gallery in one of our cities two pictures of deep sig- 
nificance are exhibited. One represents Italy, leaning on an Etrus- 
can tomb, with the eye of retrospect looking back over the past and _ 
finding the evidences of her glory in the wrecks of vanished great- 
ness ;.the other represents America, standing in the midst of im- 
mense achievements already wrought, but oblivious of the past, 
with head erect and countenance ablaze, with the eye of prospect 
looking to the future. May this be the attitude of the friends of 
education. Forgetting those things which are behind and reaching 
forth unto those things which are before, may we press forward to 
that true democracy where every person, of whatever state or caste, 
through equal educational advantages, shall have an equal oppor- 
tunity one with the other in the great race of life. Hasten that day.

' For the past year he had been manager of the Webb & Ware

The above is the story, briefly told, of a pure and noble life. He 
sacrificed self for the good of his fellows while living, and died

spirit of helpfulness—genuine, sincere, inspiring. 
He was a true teacher—scholarly, studious, sympathetic, gen- 
tle, loyal, and devoted to the profession of his choice. 
His influence was ever for the right and good, positively so, and 
will continue to strengthen the many lives it has touched. His life 
was a blessing, and made the world better by its purity of purpose 
and gentleness of spirit. We shall ever cherish his memory.

THE E. W. GROVE SCHOOL, PARIS, TENN. 
This institution of learning is something rather unique in school 
building in Tennessee. Mr. E. W. Grove, of St. Louis, Mo., an 
enterprising, philanthropic, Christian gentleman, desiring to do 
something for the higher education of the boys and girls of Henry 
County, Tenn., where he had formerly lived and made his start in 
business life, submitted a proposition to Henry County that if the 
county and city of Paris would buy the grounds and erect the build- 
ings, he would endow the school to the amount of $80,000, and 
guarantee an income thereon to the amount of $4,000 a year, the 
school to be free to the children of every bona fide citizen of the 
county and to the teachers of the county. 
The city and county accepted the proposition, and have com- 
pleted a handsome, modern, up-to-date building, of which the ac- 
companying cut is a true picture, at a cost of $46,000 for the build- 
ing, and fifty acres of ground which lies in three-fourths of a mile 
of Court Square, of Paris, Tenn., an historic old town that has 
given to the State and nation more than its share of eminent states- 
men, scholars, and divines; a town of about 5,000 population, of a 
high order of citizenship, of splendid churches and no saloons. 
The school building is situated on an eminence, the highest point 
in West Tennessee, and beautifully and healthfully located. 
_ The school is intended to be a first-class training school, not a 
college or university, but one that will prepare students for en- 
trance into the best colleges in the country, or to go out into the 
struggles of life, well equipped, morally and mentally, for its bat- 
tles. 
The school is under the supervision of Messrs. Chappell Brothers 
as principals, and has opened with a fine student body of more 
than one hundred in attendance. 
This school, together with the graded public school of the city, 
affords splendid educational advantages to Paris and Henry County, 
Tenn.

STATE INSTITUTE, LAWRENCEBURG. , 
. Supt. S. A. Mynders: 
Sir—Agreeable to your instructions, the State Institute 
at Lawrenceburg was opened on June 11 and continued in 
session for twenty days, closing July 6, 1906. | 
The examinations were conducted. after hours of tuition, 
thus giving full time, both-to teachers and instructors, for 
a complete review of all subjects required by the State. 
For four years in succession you have conferred upon 
me the honor of conducting State institutes, and in no in- 
stance do I feel that my efforts have met with such signal 
success as that which attended me at Lawrenceburg, Tenn. 
The instructors whom you appointed to assist me consti- 
tuted an ideal faculty, and to them, by virtue of their spe- 
cial fitness for the character of work assigned each to do, 
together with the sincere and hearty co-operation of Supt. - 
L. C. White, is due in a large measure the eminent success 
of our efforts to improve the teaching force of the State. 
Out of. a total enrollment of 148, we examined 114, and 
_licensed 64, which was indeed fulfilling the scriptural in- 
junction that many shall be called but few shall be chosen. 
It is needless to say that those who passed successfully 
were quickly employed to teach the best schools in the 
county, and at an increased salary. The interest manifested 
by the directors in the results of the State’s examination 
was unusual, and acted as a powerful incentive to teachers 
to prepare themselves for their work. In this connection 
it may be said that in few, if in any, counties in the entire 
State, do the directors and teachers show such deference 
to their Superintendent as is shown in Lawrence County. 
As a result of this mutual confidence and respect, there is
-P-A-G-E-239
—224— 
a united effort upon the part of the citizens of Lawrence- 
burg and of Lawrence County to establish a county high 
school,. which shall supply, not alone the present but future 
-generations of their people with well qualified teachers, 
business men and women. 
: If space may be permitted, I should like to bear testi- 
mony to the deep interest taken in the primary work, 
especially in the subjects of reading, writing and spelling; 
it was the second year for Miss Mary Arthur, of the Pea- 
body College for Teachers, to lecture to the teachers of 
Lawrence County on these subjects; and with the founda- 
tion she so skillfully laid the first year, it was indeed 
delightful work to build thereon a superstructure of Aids 
and Helps to teachers and pupils. In her style of presen- 
tation Miss Arthur makes a knowledge and thorough under- 
standing of those subjects an easy acquisition on the part 
of her students. 
A more than usual interest was aroused by Prof. Page, 
County Superintendent of Williamson County, on the sub- 
ject of Theory and Practice. Prof. Page has not a superior 
“in the State as a lecturer on this subject, which is of 
such vital importance to teachers. It is safe to say that 
every teacher who heard his lectures will profit by them, 
by acquiring a collection of the very best books written on 
our profession, and in forming reading circles, where these 
subjects are discussed. 
What a blessing it would be if every school in the 
State had a George Simmons to teach Tennessee History. 
His lectures on this: subject aroused a veritable old camp- 
meeting interest; they were given somewhat in the style of 
“Old Tales Retold,” by Mrs. Zollicoffer Bond, and left every 
teacher hungry to know more of the early history of our 
State. 
“Man, know thyself,” is the creed of Prof. Sherrill, of the © 
Paris Public Schools, and his lectures on Physiology and 
Hygiene, given much in the style of a veteran demonstrator,
-P-A-G-E-240
—225— 
proved that he knew his subject and how to press its im- : 
portance as one of the major subjects of the State’s curricu- 
lum of study. : 
From the very beginning to the close of the month’s 
work there was a rigid adherence to the program, a copy of 
which is herewith submitted, so that an equal share of time 
was alloted for instruction in each subject. 
Our Daily Paper, edited by Chas. T. Crawford, and con- 
taining an account of each day’s proceedings, was a potent 
factor in stimulating the interest and arousing the teachers 
to their best efforts. 
The most memorable occasion was the advent of our 
State Superintendent, his visit to the lecture hall, and the 
powerful plea which he made for better conditions for his 
myriads of clients—the children of the State. His lecture, 
which made a profound impression on the splendid audience 
which greeted him, is already bearing fruit in every district 
in the county.

REPORT OF HON. S. G. GILBREATH. 
Hon. Seymour A. Mynders, State Superintendent Public In- 
struction, Nashville, Tenn.: 
DEAR SiR—I herewith submit a report of my visits to 
and inspection of the State and County Institutes to which 
I had the honor of being assigned by your appointment. 
The institutes visited by me were held in the following 
counties at the places named: Polk County, Benton; Mon- 
roe County, Madisonville; Jefferson County, Dandridge; 
Cocke County, Newport; Bradley County, Cleveland; 
Greene County, Mosheim; Campbell County, LaFollette; 
Roane County, Harriman; Sevier County, Sevierville; An-
-P-A-G-E-243
—228— 
derson County, Clinton, and Union County, Maynardville. 
All were county institutes except the one held in Roane 
County, and were under the control of the County Super- 
intendents. The attendance represented a large per cent of 
the teaching force of the counties, and in some of the 
counties the interest was very good. 
As I have already submitted to you a-detailed oral report 
of my work and inspection, I shall content myself in this 
report with more general observations. / 
1. The Need for the Institute-—As will be shown in your 
statistical report, -the vast majority of the children en- 
rolled in the public schools are in the primary grades. These 
children are taught by men and women whose average 
standard of qualification is not high. The larger number of 
teachers have been educated in the schools to which a little 
later they are returned as teachers, and many of them 
have enjoyed no other or higher type of training for the 
duties of the profession which they assume. They may-be 
earnest and conscientious, but they are in woeful ignorance 
of the demands to be met, and, of course, of the better way 
in which to discharge the obligations of their office. Their 
salaries are low—in some instances less than $100 a year, 
and very seldom reaching $300 a year. 
The teachers’ institute is the only means they have of 
enjoying any professional training. It is the only place 
where they may hear explained and discussed the problems 
peculiar to their profession. It is the only place they can 
receive the assistance of their better prepared dnd more 
experienced colleagues, and be led into higher aspiration by 
the work and presence of educational leaders. I submit 
again the conclusion I reached years ago, that no more wise 
appropriation or expenditure is made than that for the 
annual teachers’ institutes, or one that yields larger returns 
to the children of the State. 
2. Changes Suggested.—At the Harriman State Institute 
I found an excellent faculty, working under the wise direc-
-P-A-G-E-244
—229— 
tion of Supt. R. L. Jones, of Hamilton County, a public 
school man -of successful experience and high ideals. The 
average attendance at the institute was about 100, largely 
made up of the teachers of the county in which the institute 
was located. The average number in attendance at the 
county institutes I visited was nearly equal to the number 
in attendance at the State Institute. In some of the county 
institutes the instructors were doing a fair type of pro- 
fessional work, in others it was very poor—the instruc- 
tors needing to be learners rather than pupils; in all the 
need for efficient instruction was pressing. I believe no 
mistake would be made should you discontinue the State 
institutes, in East Tennessee, at least, and instead send 
competent instructors to a larger number of counties. The 
’ work of five instructors one month in a State institute is 
equal to that of two instructors two weeks in five institutes 
or one week in ten institutes. This change, if made, would 
give to a larger number of teachers a higher type of in- 
struction. 
While the primary need of the public school teachers is 
for better scholarship, it is my belief that they should be 
discouraged from attempting to acquire such scholarship in 
the short term of an institute. To this end it might be well 
to make the instruction professional and pedagogic rather 
than academic. Another measure which has been proposed, 
looking in this direction, is that the examination of appli- 
eants should be held at the beginning instead of at the 
closing ‘of the session. 
General Observations.—In many of the counties visited 
it was easy to see that political considerations entered 
largely into all public school problems,:- influencing in the 
selection of superintendents, directors and even teachers. 
This evil can best be met by the abolition of the boards of 
directors and ‘the substitution therefor of the’ County Board 
of Education. 
The higher standard of qualification required of super-
-P-A-G-E-245
—230— 
intendents, and your earnest campaign for the elimination 
of incompetent teachers is raising the qualifications of 
teachers in many counties, but not in all. All the influence 
in favor of the incompetents is local, and the election of 
the superintendent is likewise local. As a consequence the 
instructions of the State Superintendent are sometimes dis- 
regarded or disobeyed. To correct the abuses practiced 
under the present system the law should be amended so as 
to give to the State Superintendent full control in the 
examination and certification of teachers. The State 
Teachers’ Association in 1905 passed a resolution favoring 
such amendment to the present law. 
The annual teachers’ institute develops the organization 
or lack of organization of the educational forces of a county. 
While some of the counties visited have effectively organ-— 
ized, it was apparent that a pressing need in all the counties 
is for stronger organization. Some of the superintendents 
maintain a teachers’ association, and make it a power for 
good—others have no association worthy the name, and do 
‘not seem to realize the need of any. This need is so vital 
that the: State should lend a helping hand. This can be 
done in two ways, one within, the other without. (a) The 
salaries of County Superintendents should no longer be left 
to County. Courts, but should be regulated by law, and all 
County Superintendents should be required to devote their 
entire time and attention to the public school interests of 
their respective counties. (b) Your visits to countiés and 
addresses to the people have been many, and the results 
in every instance have been productive of large results. But 
all the industry, activity and interest you have brought to 
your administration have not enabled you to spend much 
time in any one county. 
The policy the State has adopted in other departments 
should be carried into the Department of Public Instruc- 
tion, and the State Superintendents should be given assist- 
ants for each division of the State, to assist in the organi-
-P-A-G-E-246
—231— 
zation. of the educational forces in the counties, in the 
certification of teachers, in the creation, in every legitimate 
way, of a stronger and more universal sentiment in favor 
of the education of all the people. The State has no greater 
interest to encourage and foster, and this should be done, 
not only in political platforms and campaign orations, but 
by wise legislation and more liberal appropriation. 
Thanking you most sincerely for the many courtesies 
shown me, and for the opportunities you have given me 
_to contribute my poor help to the great work you are 
doing for the children of the State, I am, 
Very respectfully yours, 
SIDNEY G. GILBREATH.

STATE INSTITUTE, CARTHAGE. 
Hon. S. A. Mynders: 
Dear Stk—The following I submit as my report of the 
State Teachers’ Institute held in Carthage, beginning Mon- 
day, June 11, and closing Friday, July 6, 1906. The faculty 
_ was composed of C. L. Douglass, Conductor; Profs, P. A. 
Lyon, C. B. Ijams and L. S. Gillentine, instructors. The . 
institute was. formally opened with an appropriate address 
by the Hon. L. A. Ligon, Mayor of the city, whose cordial 
welcome from himself and the citizens at once made us feel 
“at home,” assuring us that we were among friends, who 
were ready to second our exertions in the great cause that 
we represented. In the very beginning a splendid success 
was insured, inasmuch as we felt that we would receive 
the strong endorsement and liberal co-operation of this. gen- 
erous and hospitable people. ~ 
The regular committees for the institute were appointed 
at once, the enrollment had, faculty placed in charge of 
_ their respective classes, and regular work assigned. 
One session was held each day, opening at 8 o’clock and 
closing at 1 p. m. 
There was not the slightest friction during the entire 
institute, the teachers were thoroughly interested in the 
work, and on examination plainly manifested their deep 
interest in the production of good papers. : 
I feel that the success of this institute was especially 
due to my efficient, energetic and courteous assistants, who 
are alive to every school interest, and whose energy and. 
forcefulness are always deeply felt. They certainly did 
their part well. Would mention as a meritorious feature 
of this convention our educational rally, in which we en-
-P-A-G-E-248
—233— 
joyed splendid music, entertaining recitations and a very 
telling speech from Superintendent Mynders. An unusual 
digression was our reception by the County Court, which 
was highly enjoyable, and I think resulted in much good 
to the teachers of Smith County. 
During our session we had some splendid speeches, 
which being practical and in close touch with our work, 
gave us much encouragement. Among those speakers most 
prominent I. would mention L. A. Ligon, W. V. Lee, Gov. 
McMillin, Rev. Ewton, Superintendent Piper, of Macon 
County, and Bradley McGinnis. 
We remember with pleasure the kindness of Mrs. Gar- 
denhire and the Misses Gold, who entertained us so often 
with their good music. : . 
The institute should certainly be grateful to Messrs. S. 
M. Johnson and S. D. Kemp, the first having discharged so 
well the laborious duties of Secretary; the other who was 
Chairman of- the Musical Committee, and did his work 
so well. 
The conductor and faculty were relieved of much hard 
work and much anxiety by the unceasing vigilance, the un- 
tiring efforts and the courteous aid rendered by the 
efficient County Superintendent Curtis. He is certainly an 
ideal Superintendent, and he is thoroughly appreciated by 
the teachers and his people. , 
Right here I would mention that Prof. Lyon, having 
been called home on account of sickness in his family, that 
during his absence of one week, Miss Minnie Fisher was 
appointed as.one of the faculty. She certainly is efficient 
and untiring, and right well did she discharge every duty. 
During the institute there were enrolled 182. Teachers 
in primary, 175; males, 89; females, 86. Secondary depart- 
ment, 7; males, 4; females, 3. 
In conclusion, would say that you were very fortunate 
in your selection of Carthage. It was needed, and it was 
profoundly appreciated. The teachers were grateful and
-P-A-G-E-249
—234— 
the people, than whom I have never known a more hospita- 
ble and generous, lent their best aid toward making the 
institute a glorious success. In truth, through its courteous 
and progressive Mayor, the city was turned over to us in all 
of its length, breadth and thickness. We feel that you 
have done a great work, and regret that your administra- 
tion is drawing to a close, yet there should ever abide with 
you the pleasant consciousness that you have discharged 
your _bublic duties thoroughly and faithfully; and on 
retiring from this high office, we feel that you will receive 
the commendation, “Well done, thou good and faithful 
servant.” Respectfully, 
as. DoucLass. 
RESOLUTIONS. 
The State Institute in session at Carthage, Tenn., has 
brought together teachers from twelve different counties of 
the State. We feel that by our social relations, our ex- 
change of ideas and the able instruction of the faculty, that 
our professional sympathies have been deepened, our ideas 
of school work broadened, and that we are in every way 
better prepared for the very important and responsible 
duties of our profession; therefore we, the teachers in 
attendance, take pleasure in expressing our appreciation of 
the good. that has been accomplished by resolving: | 
1. That our sincere thanks are due State Supt. S. A. 
Mynders for locating the institute in Carthage, and. for 
the very able faculty sent us. 
2. That we tender the Board of Education our thanks 
for the use of the school building during examination. 
8: That we shall remember with pleasure the cordial 
welcome extended us on the day of our assembling by Mayor 
L. A. Ligon, and his continued efforts, aided as he has 
been by the citizens of the town, to make the institute a 
success, and our stay in Carthage pleasant and enjoyable. 
4, ‘That our thanks are due Prof. J. R. Curtis, Smith.
-P-A-G-E-250
—235— 
County’s capable and obliging Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, for his courtesy to teachers and visitors, and 
his efforts for the success of the institute. 
5. That our organist, Miss Niel Gold, and her com- 
mittee on music are entitled to our respect and appreciation 
for the way in which they have performed their duties. 
6. That we are especially indebted to Superintendent 
Mynders and to Ex-Gov. Benton McMillin for their splendid 
addresses before the institute; also to all others who have 
in any way contributed to our entertainment since we have 
been in session. 
7. That we are indebted to the press for their r publi- 
cations and complimentary notices. 
8. Especially are we grateful to the County Court that 
so readily voted an appropriation of $150 for the purpose 
of aiding the State Superintendent in defraying the ex- 
penses of the institute. 
9. That in Capt. Douglass we fully realize that we 
have had as our conductor one .of the very best equipped . 
men in the State for the place, and that the success of the 
work has been greatly due to his kind and courteous dispo- 
sition and to his impartial procedure. 
10. That we cannot commend too strongly the efficient 
work of the excellent faculty sent us in the personages of 
P. A. Lyon, C. B. Ijams, L. S. Gillentine and Miss Minnie 
Fisher. . : 
11. That we express the hope, and make this our re- 
spectful but earnest request to the State Superintendent, 
whoever he may be at that time, that another State insti-

STATE INSTITUTE, CUMBERLAND CITY, 
JUNE 11 TO JULY 6, 1906. 
Smr—The following brief report of the State Institute 
conducted at Cumberland City from June 11 to July 6 is 
most respectfully submitted: 
Immediately following your announcement of instruc- 
tors, each member of the faculty was assigned his work and 
came to Cumberland City, knowing exactly what he would 
have to do during the whole session of four weeks. 
The institute convened promptly at 10 a. m. on the open- 
ing day, and organized by establishing both a primary and 
secondary department. We had one session a day, begin- 
ning at 7:45 a. m., and closing at 12:30 p. m. The in- 
structors were assigned as follows: 
W. H. Cook, of Rives, Conductor—Physiology, Geome- 
try, Bookkeeping, Civics. 
J. H. Bayer, Cumberland City, Secretary-—_U. 8. History, 
School Management, Agriculture, Geology. 
W. C. Lawson, Pulaski—Grammar, Arithmetic, Psy- 
chology, Rhetoric. ‘ 
_E. B. Wilson, Dickson—Geography, Tennessee History, 
Algebra, Physics. 
Miss Rebecca Bayer, Cumberland City—Primary 
Methods. 
The entire faculty did everything possible to make the 
institute a success, and I believe no institute had more able, 
consecrated, faithful workers than did this one. The 
student-teachers were earnest, faithful and prompt to obey 
all regulations. Cumberland City Academy is an ideal place 
for an institute, and both instructors and teachers profited 
by the superior advantages afforded.. The resident minis-
-P-A-G-E-253
—238— 
ters, business men and citizens in general sought to make 
the institute both pleasant and. profitable. 
A delightful feature of the institute was the able, force. 
ful and eloquent address delivered by our State Super- 
intendent, Hon. Seymour A. Mynders. 
In conclusion, I would thank you for the strong and 
able work you are doing for the public schools of Ten- 
nessee, and assure you that we are in thorough sympathy 
with your administration. Respectfully, 
W. H. Cook, 
Conductor. 
We, your Committee on Resolutions, submit the follow- 
ing for your approval: 
WHEREAS, It has been such a great source of profit and 
pleasure to all who are interested in the great problems of 
education, and especially those who have been in the insti- 
tute; and whereas, the citizens and authorities of Cumber- 
land City have spared no pains to make this institute a suc- 
cess in every particular; therefore, 
Resolved, 1. That our sincere thanks be tendered our 
State Superintendent, Capt. S. A. Mynders, for his untiring 
efforts in the upbuilding of the public schools of Tennessee 
and for the inspiring address delivered to this institute; and 
especially do we thank him for locating the institute at 
this place, and we sincerely petition that another institute 
be located here next year, and that the same faculty be given 
us again. 
2. That we express to the Conductor, Prof. W. H. Cook, 
and to the other members of our beloved faculty, our sin- 
eere thanks for the thorough and efficient instruction 
given us.

7. That we thank all others not before mentioned for 
whatever they have done to make this institute a success.

STATE INSTITUTE, HARRIMAN. . 
' Hon. Seymour A. Mynders, Nashville, Tenn. 
Dear Sir—I herewith submit a report of the State 
. Institute held at Harriman June 18 to July 18, 1906. 
The institute convened in the assembly hall of the Harri- 
man University promptly “at 10 o’clock. 
Chancellor James A. Tate, of the University, delivered 
the address of welcome in behalf of the citizens of Harri- ~ 
man, which was responded to by the conductor and other 
members of the faculty. 
The plan of work was outlined and subjects for discus- 
sion on the following day announced. 
The following schedule of recitations was carried out 
each day: 
7:30 to 7:40—Opening Exercises. 
7:40 to 8:10—Rhetoric—Armstrong; Reading—North- 
: ern.

—243— 
I desire to thank and commend you for the most excel- 
lent faculty you associated with me. Each instructor thor- 
oughly prepared the work and brought .a live message to 
the teachers that could not fail to give them not only in- 
formation but inspiration as well. 
The student teachers manifested a deep interest in the 
work from the very beginning and while a very small per 
cent of them received State Certificates, in my opinion they 
are the equal of the average teaching force in‘the State. 
_ I think before any one should receive a State Certificate 
he should be able to make an average grade of 85 per cent 
in a fair and reasonable examination with fair and honest 
grading of papers. 
If a State Certificate is valuable it should stand for 
higher ‘scholarship and superior professional knowledge 
to that required of receiving a County Certificate, and in 
proportion as the requirements for receiving a State license 
increase respect and confidence in the State Certificate 
will increase. : 
In addition to the twenty certificates issued upon exam- 
ination, there were four certificates and two “Roll of Honor” 
renewed on recommendation of County Superintendents, 
the attendance requirement having been met. 
In concluding this report I desire to express the thanks 
of the faculty and the entire student body to our worthy 
State Superintendent for his visit to the institute and for 
his most excellent address, and to Supt. S. G. Gilbreath, 
who came as the representative of the Department of Pub- 
lic Instruction and delivered a splendid address, also to 
Supt. J. C. Wright, whose untiring efforts in Roane and 
adjacent counties made it possible to secure a good attend- . 
ance of teachers. Yourstruly,

STATE INSTITUTE, M’KENZIE, 
JUNE 11 TO JULY 6, 1906. ° 
Sir—As conductor of the State Institute at McKenzie, 
I beg leavé to submit the following report and recommenda- 
tions. The good people of McKenzie were a unit in their 
efforts to care for the members and to make the institute a 
success in every particular. 
The teachers on their arrival at McKenzie were placed 
in the splendid and elegant homes of the town, by previously 
chosen committees. This work was systematic; the homes 
were the very best. No institute was ever better cared for, 
and the teachers left McKenzie feeling that no effort had 
been spared by the citizens to make their stay pleasant and 
profitable. We wish to thank Mayor Burkhalter and the 
entire population of the town for many favors and courte- 
sies. . “ 
The faculty appointed to assist in ‘the work, Supt. J. B. 
Cummings, Prof. H. E. Watters, Prof. W. E. Johnston, Supt. 
J. F. Duncan and Prof. J. B. Reed were’ efficient helpers. 
They were untiring in their labors and rendered able and 
efficient help. The conductor wishes to thank them for 
valuable aid and earnest co-operation in all the work of the 
institute. — 
The enrollment was 515 actual teachers, the largest ever 
in the State before. There were, in fact, too many in the 
institute to accomplish. the best results. The personnel of 
the institute was good——there were fewer boys and girls 
and a larger per cent. of mature men and women and experi- 
enced teachers. 
The scholarship of the members was also above the 
average and yet there were many failures. It was found in
-P-A-G-E-261
—246— 
many instances, that teachers were endeavoring to take the 
Secondary examination in branches which they had not 
previously studied, such teachers depending on the instruc- 
tion given in the institute as their sole preparation. 
The time of the institute was devoted wholly to the work 
in hand. No time was given to any form of entertainment 
or to parties with ‘axes to grind.” 
- The examinations were thorough and practical, the 
grading was fair and liberal. While there were many dis- 
appointments and a large per cent. of failures, I regard this 
_ as the best and most satisfactory institute I have ever 
been in. 
In view of the experience in this and other institutes, I 
would make the following recommendations: 
1. That as soon as practicable, teachers take all of the 
Secondary work in one year, just-as they now do in the 
Primary. 
2. -That an entrance examination be required, or some 
means be adopted to keep teachers from undertaking ex- 
aminations in branches which they have not previously 
studied. . 
3. That the “powers that be,” the State Legislature or 
the State Board of Education, establish, either with or 
without State aid, three State Normal Schools for the train- 
ing of public school teachers. 
4. That holders of honor roll certificates attending in- 
- stitutes for renewals without examinations, be required to 
attend the first 15 days of the term or to take one examina- 
tion for each day missed ; provided that the branch on which 
~ examination shall be given shall be selected by the conductor 
and that no certificate shall be renewed for less than 15 
days’ work and attendance. .  T. B. Loceins,

our care and comfort while in their midst. 
2. That we thank Prof. W. E. Johnston of McKenzie, 
and Supt. E. H. Harrell, of Carroll County, for their untiring 
efforts in behalf of the teachers individually and the insti- 
tute as a whole. / 
3. That we extend our thanks to our able State Super- 
intendent, Capt. S. A. Mynders, for his helpful address to 
our body and for courtesies shown us. We heartily endorse 
his administration as able, clean and efficient and free from 
partisanship of every kind. The State has had no worthier 
officer or one who has done more for the public schools of 
the State. 
: 4, That we, teachers of the McKenzie State Institute in

locate another institute at McKenzie in 1907. 
5. .That we heartily endorse the able, efficient and im- 
partial manner in which Prof. T. B. Loggins has conducted 
this institute, and it is our judgment that he has dealt fairly 
with both the State and the school children of Tennessee in 
_ all his work while here. J. B.. CUMMINGS,

STATE INSTITUTE, COVINGTON. 
Hon. S. A. Mynders, Nashville, Tenn. 
DEAR Sir—It is my pleasure to submit the following 
report of the State Institute, held at Covington from June 
A, 1906, to June 29, 1906. 
’ We enjoyed a most successful institute. The attendance 
was good, and the student-teachers took an earnest interest 
in the work.’ A professional spirit pervaded the entire insti- 
tute. The teachers seemed to want to go beyond the mere 
knowledge of text-books. An effort to learn how to teach 
the public school curriculum, to acquire a pedagogical 
knowledge of the subjects required to be taught in our com- 
mon schools was a characteristic feature of the institute. 
The instructors endeavored to destroy the idea that an insti- 
tute is a school in which a knowledge of text-books is to be 
acquired; but rather that the purpose of the institute is to 
give the student-teachers a pedagogical training for their 
work in the public schools. 
The members of the faculty were earnest and prompt in 
the discharge of every duty. They deserve to be commend- 
ed for their efficiency and faithfulness. 
We desire to acknowledge our appreciation of your .visit 
and address to our institute; also, of Supt. W. S. Jones, of 
Memphis,.and Miss Elizabeth Messick, Superintendent of 
Shelby County schools. 
We desire also to express our appreciation of Prof. A. 
L. Rhoton’s valuable services rendered the institute. 
Supt. J. A. Cotten was untiring in his efforts to make the 
institute both pleasant and profitable to the teachers. He 
is to be congratulated for the splendid public school spirit 
in his county.
-P-A-G-E-266
~—251— 
Our most grateful thanks are due the Covington press, the 
pastors and citizens of Covington for the keen interest mani- 
fested in the institute work. Tipton County has a public- 
spirited court. It has appropriated $400 a year for the past 
two years to supplement the institute fund in Tipton County. 
This court deserves the highest commendation for the 
interest it has manifested in the public schools of its county. 
You will find below the names of the faculty and division 
of the work:

Government. 
C. P. Jester, Secretary—Arithmetic, School Manage- 
ment, Pedagogy and Bookkeeping. . 
C. J. Heatwole—United States History, Physiology, 
Physics, Geology and Agriculture. 
J. C. Fooshee—Tennessee History, Geography, Geome-

On account of the serious illness of Superintendent Heat- 
wole’s wife, he was compelled to give up his work at the 
close of the second week, and Prof. W. E. Miller, Principal 
of the Union City High School, took his place. Professor 
Miller proved to be a very strong institute instructor.

STATE INSTITUTES 
FOR COLORED TEACHERS

STATE INSTITUTE, COLORED, CLARKSVILLE, 
JUNE 18 TO JULY 6, 1906. 
I herewith transmit for your inspection my report of the 
State Institute held in the Colored High School building at* 
Clarksville, Tenn., June 18 to July 6, 1906. 
The institute was opened promptly on the morning of 
the 18th in accordance with your published circular of an- - 
nouncement. Each member of the faculty, with the excep- 
tion of Mrs. Helena Trimble, was in his place. 
No time was wasted in preliminary speech making. As 
the institute was only of three weeks duration, I considered 
the first day of too much value to spend it in oratorical 
efforts or in outbursts of fervid eloquence, therefore I di- 
rected each member of the faculty to have the first day’s 
work ready and to be thoroughly prepared to proceed with 
the recitations from the first morning. This was done and 
the first day was one of hard work and lessons. 
INSTRUCTION. 
I wish to commend most heartily the character of the 
work done in this institute. It was of a superior kind. It 
received the unanimous endorsement of the whole institute. 
It had been a good many years since a State Institute had 
been held in Clarksville and I was informed that State cer- 
tificates had fallen a little into disfavor. This was due to . 
the fact, I was told, that the faculty of the last State Insti- 
tute had let loose some rather poor material upon the county. 
As conductor, I was, therefore, very anxious that the faculty 
should bring to the institute the very best scholarship and 
that their instruction should be first class. I also made it a 
point to see that the examinations were honestly conducted,
-P-A-G-E-271
—256— 
and that the questions were fair and reasonable. Every 
precaution was taken to avoid cheating and favoritism. 
The result was that the returns from the examinations gave 
perfect satisfaction. Only 17 out of 58 passed. But these 
17 represented the best intellects of the institute and all felt 
that only those that deserved it had made certificates. Of 
course, there was some disappointments, but those who 
_ failed felt that justice had been done and gave the faculty 
full credit for honesty and impartiality. 
ARITHMETIC. 
Candor and truth compel me to state that the teachers of 
Montgomery County know more arithmetic than any county 
teachers it has ever been my pleasure to meet. It was an 
agreeable surprise to me to find them so well up in this 
branch. This was true, not of two or three teachers, but of - 
a majority of them. Grammar, however, did not seem so 
well understood, and I think that more time should be given 
to this subject all over the State. . , 
ENROLLMENT. 
The enrollment was not as large as it should have been. 
I account for this by reason of the fact that so many County 
Institutes were held on the same date as the State Institute. 
These conflictions should not occur. I think it would be a 
step in the right direction to hold the County Institutes 
either before or after the State Institutes. 
VISITORS. 
The institute was attended by many visitors. Some came 
to remain only a half hour, but afterward became so inter- 
ested in the work that they remained all day and came back 
on other days. Among some of the prominent visitors were 
Revs. Geo. W. Hampton, I. S. Jones, John H. Henderson,

STATE INSTITUTE, COLORED, COVINGTON, 
JUNE 29 TO JULY 6, 1906. 
Hon. 8. A. Mynders, State Superintendent, Nashville, Tenn. 
DEAR SiR—I have the honor ‘to submit the report of the 
joint institute for colored teachers, held at Covington, Tenn., 
beginning on June 25 and continuing one week. 
Prof. Joe A. Cotton, -the County Superintendent, gave 
many timely suggestions. I was also ably assisted by W. G. 
Webster.. Two sessions were held each day. The total 
number of teachers enrolled, as shown in the minutes, was 
eighty. 
There was a deep interest manifested by the citizens, 
for not a session was held but that we had a good represen- 
tation of the people. Judge S. E. Stephens, Attorney W. A. 
Owen and Esquire Exum visited the institute and made 
able talks, giving the institute much profitable information. 
These institutes and the work accomplished by them, I 
regard as prime factors in educational growth of the State. 
Accompanying this report you will find a set of resolu- 
tions endorsing the work done by the conductor. Also a 
petition asking you to place a State Institute at Covington 
next summer, for the colored teachers of that part of the 
State. Supt. J. A. Cotton expressed a desire for such an 
institute. I think Covington, Tenn., a very desirable place 
for said institute. Yours obediently, 
J. B. BATTE, 
Conductor.

STATE INSTITUTE, COLORED, JACKSON. 
To Hon. S. A. Mynders, State Superintendent: 
I have the honor to submit to you the following report: 
The Jackson Institute, which opened June 24, and closed 
June 29, 1906, was unusually successful. Most of the 
teachers were from West Tennessee, but all sections of the 
State were represented. From beginning to end the great- 
est amount of interest and enthusiasm was shown. 
Although the requirement was only for three weeks, 
the bulk of the teachers remained the entire four weeks. 
The fact that the institute is assuming the character of a 
permanent location at Jackson in the Lane College build- 
ings is of much help to the institute. 
Careful attention by experienced teachers of depart- 
ments is given to the work. It will be observed that each 
instructor is a teacher of experience and broad training. 
These institutes are becoming more helpful to the 
_ teachers of West Tennessee. Resolutions were adopted by 
the more than 200 teachers present expressing their appre- 
ciation of the work and requesting of the State Superin- 
tendent that the institute for West Tennessee be continued 
at Lane College, Jackson. The advantage of the school 
buildings, with their equipment, is clearly seen to be great. 
In addition to the advantage of reviews and the presen- 
tation of methods of teaching, the instructors gave much 
attention to methods of study, believing that the teachers 
who studiously and systematically apply themselves to 
study must need be helped to a small extent. Systematic 
study, systematic teaching, and systematic school regula- 
tions, in the minds of the instructors of this institute, will 
bring about the proper results for any school.

REPORTS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
The Anderson County Normal convened at the high 
school building in Clinton, Monday, July 16, for a session 
of two weeks. Without exception this was the best attended 
and most successful normal ever held in the county. The | 
institute work was done almost entirely by Prof. R. M. Shipp, 
of Winchester, Ky. His work was entirely satisfactory. 
There has been great improvement in the schools of 
Anderson County in the last few years. The beginning dates 
back to the time when E. L. Foster was Superintendent. 
Under his administration the first graded course of study 
was prepared for the schools. He also organized the Ander- : 
son County Circulating Library Association. About the 
same time the town of Clinton organized a public library. 
For several years these libraries were conducted entirely- 
independent of each other. Later they were combined and 
are known now as the Anderson County Public Library. 
The membership fee was fixed at one dollar and the annual 
dueg at fifty cents. Any person in the county can now read 
the best literature published at a minimum cost. This has 
had much to do with the raising of the standard of education . 
in Anderson County. Teachers have always been excused 
from examination in theory and practice of teaching on con- 
dition that they read the books on education designated by 
the County Superintendent. : 
The examinations, as a whole, have been such as to pass 
only the most qualified teachers in the county. Very few 
now ask for license to teach who are not qualified. 
Anderson County, as well as all other counties of the 
State, need most of all a County Board of Education. . A non-
-P-A-G-E-285
—270— 
. bolitical County Board of Education would'do more toward 
raising the standard of teachers than anything else. It 
would do away with the hiring of nieces and nephews to 
teach the schools.. This matter was thoroughly discussed in 
our normal on directors’ day. The general opinion was that 
we ought to have a special law on this subject for Anderson 
County. . “ 
' Directors’ day is looked to by the teachers and citizens 
of Clinton as a most enjoyable occasion. The annual ban- 
quet given by the teachers on the evening of Directors’ day 
has become a fixture in Anderson County Normals, and, 
inasmuch as it brings the teachers and patrons into closer 
touch, its educational value cannot be over-estimated. 
With improved roads, improved condition of things gen- 
erally, length of term increased to 111 days, and salaries 
increased to nearly forty dollars per month, we naturally 
expect and demand a better class of teachers. These condi- 
tions have forced out of the schools several of the oldest 
teachers, who were not willing to keep abreast of the times, 
and in their stead are young men, full of energy, whose 
. mark is yet to be made.

BLOUNT COUNTY. 
The Blount County Teachers’ Institute met June 18, in 
Maryville College. 
The attendance was the best in the history of institute 
work in our county.: There was no loitering or lagging on the 
part of the teachers. Everyone found his or her place and 
“was ready and anxious to gain something that would 
strengthen them for the work before them.

The instructions given by Professor Gamble and Profes-

teachers. 
A’special programme was arranged and carried out for 
- visitors’ day. A special invitation was sent to all directors 
and members of County Court. Quite a number came in 
answer to the invitation. 
The Institute in general was considered a success. 
motto is “Advancement.”

BRADLEY COUNTY. 
The Bradley County Institute convened at the high school 
building July 2, and continued in session five days. The 
. school interest in the county is slowly but gradually increas- 
ing. - . 
Terms are being lengthened and salaries increased at.a 
very low rate of per cent. We had no State help during the 
session, but the teachers resolved themselves into a body 
of workers and did efficient work in rendering the institute 
a success. 
We hope ‘to effect a complete organization of Superin- 
tendent, directors, teachers and justices during the ensuing 
- year. . With such an organization we feel that with the aid 
. our State Superintendent can render we will be able to raise 
. the standard several per cent. 
The county’s greatest obstacle in the way of educational 
progress is a lack of funds to make the schools of long 
enough duration.

CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Our Annual Institute for Campbell County convened at 
LaFollette July 2, and continued six days, with the last two 
days devoted exclusively to examinations. 
Prof. John A. Hicks, of Jellico, conducted the institute, 
but received valuable assistance from Prof. M. M. Dossett, 
of Jasper, and Dr. 8. A. Walker, of Andersonville. 
On Thursday afternoon Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, of Chatta- 
nooga, gave a lecture, with’which every teacher present was 
greatly delighted. : 
We need a better qualified class of teachers for the pri- 
mary schools, as possibly seventy-five per cent of our citizen- 
ship never go beyond the primary schools. 
We have this year established two county high schools, 
so we can hope to have a much better class of teachers in 
the near future than is being used at present. Then when 
compulsory education shall have been extended throughout 
the length and breadth of “Sunny Tennessee,” ignorance and 
superstition will flee from our borders and a better class of 
citizenship will reign in their stead. 
We hope to have better schools this year than ever before, 
and prospects are very bright at present, as parents are be- 
ginning to realize that they must stand by the public schools 
of our State, for in them rests the fate of the nation.

CANNON COUNTY. 
The Cannon County Teachers’ Institute met at Wood- 
bury, June 25, 1906. County Superintendent W. H. Finley 
was elected chairman, Prof. Charley Melton chairman pro 
tem., and Prof. L. A. Smith was elected secretary. Every 
session was attended by a large crowd of teachers and vis- 
itors. Prof. J. H. Sykes, of Nashville, was sent by Supt. 
Seymour A. Mynders to assist us in the work, and did effi- 
cient work, both in theory and practice, and reading. All 
the teachers took a lively interest in the work, both in the 
class work and discussions. Wednesday was directors’ day, 
and several. directors and magistrates were present and , 
listened to able addresses delivered by Hon. Walter Hancock, 
Hon. Jesse Davenport and Hon. H. T. Stewart, on school 
topics generally. We expect to hold several teachers’ meet- 
ings in the different parts of the county this fall. Our schools 
will run five months this fall. The prospects are encour- 
aging. 
RESOLUTION. 
The following resolutions were unanimously adopted by 
the Cannon County Teachers’ Annual Institute for 1906: 
That we commend our able County Court for taking ad- 
vantage of the Tollett Fund, so that Cannon County may
-P-A-G-E-294

have longer terms, and that children in Cannon County may 
have equal opportunities with the children of other counties 
in the State and elsewhere. That we thank Profs. J. H. 
Sykes, J. B. Clark and J. E. Brandon for the able and effec- 
tual way in which,they handled the subjects they have dis- 
cussed during the institute, and for their kind and gentle- 
manly bearing, and commend them as capable and worthy 
school men. That we further thank our County Superin- 
tendent, W. H. Finley, for his efforts and energy in making 
this institute a success, and for his kindness and for the care- 
ful, systematic way he has kept his office and made his re- 
ports, That we point with pride and gratification to the 
manifest improvement of our schools and pledge our support 
to the end that we aid in carrying the great work of educa- 
tion on to perfection.

CARROLL COUNTY. 
There being a State Institute at McKenzie, Tenn., we did 
not hold a County Institute. We requested the teachers to at- 
tend this institute, and there-were very few who did not com- 
ply with the request. It was the largest institute in the his- 
tory of the State, the enrollment reaching over five hundred. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
—281— 
- This being the third State Institute in our county within four 
years, a large per cent of our teachers have Honor Roll cer- 
tificates. Quite a number have State certificates, but they 
are not teaching this summer, hence they have not asked for 
county: certificates. This accounts for this report showing 
so many unlicensed teachers out of the number examined. 
I am devoting more time to the work than any of my pre- 
decessors, both as to gathering and recording statistics and 
in visiting schools. 
We are making an aggressive campaign for the establish- 
» ment of a County High School. 
Our teachers are now doing their part toward educational 
advancement, We need to stir up the citizenship and create 
a stronger public sentiment in favor of better schools and 
right there we are principally directing our forces. 
Rev. James Edwards (colored) was Conductor of the 
Institute for Colored Teachers. He was assisted by Prof. 
Wm. Knight and Miss Amanda Cunningham. The institute 
was held at Huntingdon, June 25-30, 1906, with good results. 
I am serving as Superintendent by appointment, Mr. 
Traywick having resigned last December. In justice to him 
I must say that he had worked up a good interest in Carroll 
County. I am doing my best to excel him.

CARTER COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report of the Carter County Insti- 
tute, which met.in Elizabethton July 2, and closed July 
10. : 
The institute was under the supervision of the County 
Superinténdent as Conductor, who was assisted by the most 
progressive teachers of this county as instructors. 
In the selection of instructors it was the purpose of the 
Superintendent to secure those who would elevate and mag- 
nify the office of the teacher and give us broader views and 
higher conceptions of what true teaching means. Hach in- 
structor gave special directions as to the best methods of 
teaching his subjects. . 
In each class principles, processes and the products of 
- teaching were thoroughly discussed. The. work of the insti- 
tute was eminently practical and professional, made so by 
giving each member of the institute something pleasant and 
profitable to do. It was a working institute. Every effort 
possible was put forth to make the institute profitable to 
teachers and visitors alike. A daily programme was carried 
out almost to the letter, thus rendering the work regular . 
and systematic. As a result of these reforms, the general 
public are beginning to regard the institute a practical busi- 
ness educational institution, rather than an opportunity at 
public expense for the display of oratory or vocal gymnas- 
tics, : 
The schools need more efficient and experienced teachers, 
a larger enrollment, a higher per cent of attendance, more 
suitable and comfortable houses as a means of more rapid 
advancement. 
For the past year I have been trying to solve the financial 
problem in order to secure sufficient funds to increase the 
school term and employ more competent teachers. I was 
favorably impressed with the idea that if the Superintendent 
and teachers would manifest to the pupils, parents and 
County Court that we were energetic teachers, worthy of
-P-A-G-E-299
—284— 
the honorable calling in which we had enlisted, that the 
court would inerease the tax levy for school purposes. This 
idea met the approval of the entire institute in session at 
Elizabethton last year. 
Before the institute closed the Superintendent was in- 
structed by the teachers to notify the County Court that the 
teachers would exert eyery effort in their power for the bet- 
terment of the public schools, and that the court one year 
hence would be asked to express their approval or disap- 
proval of teachers’ work by increasing or diminishing the 
tax levy for school purposes. 
The court received the information with pleasure, ad- 
journed, each member returned home, the institute com- 
pleted its work, adjourned, each teacher entered his field of 
labor, the magistrates watching the teacher, and the teacher 
watching the magistrates. Time went on slowly. But the 
school year for 1905-6 ended, and with it the teachers’ work, 
good or bad, ended. The school year for 1906-7 is now here. 
.. The magistrates reassembled at their court, and the teachers - 
in their institute on same date. The Superintendent sug- 
gested that the entire institute as a body march to the court- 
“house and hear the verdict of the court. Increase of tax levy 
means approval of the teachers’ work. Decrease of tax levy 
means disapproval of the teachers’ work. The institute ac- 
cepted the suggestion and marched as a unit to the court. 
The finance committee read their reports recommending an 
increase of tax levy from 35 to 45 cents on the $100. Mo- 
tion made to change the report so as to read 50 cents on the 
one hundred dollars. Lively and sarcastic discussion fol- 
lowed. Tension reached white heat. Motion carried, twen- 
ty-two to seven. Teachers return to the institute highly 
elated. This signal victory is highly gratifying to both the 
Superintendent and teachers, and we go forward this year 
full of determination and enthusiasm. 
The educational rally held at Elizabethton August 30 by 
the State Superintendent, assisted by others, and the twenty-
-P-A-G-E-300
—285— 
two subsequent rallies held in the various parts of our county 
by the County Superintendent, has unmistakably served as 
an incentive to higher thought and educational action on the 
. part of both the teacher and parent. The educational waves 
caused by the rallies are now vibrating from one side of the 
State to the other. The good resulting therefrom will never 
be accurately told or measured. oO 
We feel confident that such public-spirited men as our 
State. Superinterident and the Superintendent of the Knox: 
ville University, and others who participated in the rallies, 
will live long in the hearts of the generous people of East 
Tennessee. .

CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
In compliance with your request I herewith furnish 
you, on the attached blank, a report: of the institute for 
white teachers just closed in this county. 
The interest manifested by our teachers at this institute, 
and the work done by them was everything that could be 
expected of even teachers. The instruction given by our 
faculty was able as well as entertaining and instructive. 
The work done by our visiting instructors, Mrs. W. L., Hill, 
Dr. E. L. Roberts and Capt. C. S. Douglas, was given out of 
their abundant experience, scholarly attainments and at- 
tractive manner. The help afforded by our local teachers, 
Prof. 8. A. Link, and Messrs. J. H. Judd, Sterling Brewer, 
and J. H. Dunn, furnished a strong supplement for our 
other instructors, and so all together we think we had a 
good institute. 
A program was adopted and regular monthly meetings 
planned. for the coming term. These meetings have been 
held regularly for several years. They -have proved to be 
profitable to the teachers and schools and have been well 
attended. 
The prospect for good schools seems to be brighter in 
this county now than it has ever been. For the past several
-P-A-G-E-303
—288— 
years it has been necessary to spend a good deal of money 
in building and equipping school houses, and while they are 
not now what we would like for them to be, still in most ° 
places we have a comfortable building well seated. This - 
expense having been satisfied it seems a longer school is in 
store for us, especially if we continue to receive assistance 
from such measures as the ‘Tollett bill. 
At the July session of the County Court of this county, 
our-County Court made provision for the establishment and 
maintenance of a County High School, which has been 
located at Ashland City. Those who have a great interest 
in the cause of education in the county feel that the perma- 
nent establishment of this school means a great deal to the 
county. : 
The people of Ashland City have raised by private sub- 
scription a fund with which they propose to build and equip 
a building for the use of this school free of charge to the 
county. — :

while most of them have but little experience, I believe they

CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
My annual report shows an increase on enrollment and 
average daily attendance of about 14 per cent over last 
year. This increase is due to a deeper interest in education 
and to the Compulsory Education Law. The increase in 
enrollment by studies is from 10 to 25 per cent, mostly in 
the elementary branches, which shows that teachers realize 
that more thorough work must be done in the Primary 
Grades——a tendency for the better and full of hope. The 
length of term increased from 80 to 88 days and the teach- _ 
er’s average monthly salary is $34 instead of $28 for last 
year, while the average monthly tuition per, pupil decreased 
from 80 cents to 78 cents, which is due to the increase in 
daily attendance. The average number of pupils belonging 
to each school is about 100 and the average number as- 
signed each teacher is almost 90, while the average daily- 
attendance under each teacher is not over 50. It is obvious, 
however, that each teacher has a full quota of work. 
The class of applicants for teachers this year is much 
ahead of what it was only a short time ago. Many have 
learned that “just anybody” cannot teach school, so the 
best talent is enlisted in the work. Teachers are getting 
better qualified, generally and professionally, which is due 
in a measure, to the persistent efforts of both County and 
State Officials, and partly to new ideas and inspirations 
brought among us by our institute conductors and visiting 
educators. Teachers are giving much more attention to pro-. 
fessional reading and study than ever before, and have real- 
ized that much daily preparation is necessary to successful 
teaching. This spirit of growth and development, education- 
ally, has found a dwelling place.in the hearts of our people 
and they are looking forward to better things. This is no- 
ticeable in the increases over last year. Eight new houses, 
worth some three thousand dollars, have been built and more 
are being planned. The schools are practically free from
-P-A-G-E-307
——292— 
debt and a 45-cent tax levy has been made on property and 
- $2 on polls for school purposes. 
Our institute, conducted by Superintendent Burke, was 
well attended and in every way beneficial. Many teachers 
have expressed themselves as greatly benefited and made 
more enthusiastic in the work. Lincoln Memorial University 
was represented in the person of Dean J. H. Moore. This 
school is located near picturesque Cumberland Gap, and is 
helping many worthy young people to get a coveted educa- 
tion. Many here prepare themselves to teach. The Claiborne 
. County Teachers’ Association was re-organized and will 
have a regular course of reading and carry on an aggressive 
educational campaign. :

CLAY COUNTY. 
The Teachers’ Institute for Clay County convened: in 
Celina, July 2, 1906. Nearly all of the teachers were in at- 
tendance. The work was thorough and practical. I was 
assisted by D. Henry Piper and the teachers of the county. 
I made the examination’ searching enough to test the 
knowledge of the applicant and practical enough to render 
it possible for none to fail who were really competent and as 
a result about 30 per cent of the teachers failed to pass.
-P-A-G-E-309

This will put the teachers to work, and they will be better 
qualified for next year. 
There has been good seed sown in this institute and the 
harvest will come by and by.

COCKE COUNTY. 
Excellent work was done in our institute held at New- 
port this year by Prof. Samuel H. Thompson and Prof. 
Robert E. Wolfe, representatives of the State Department. 
The attendance was unusually good, which shows that the 
teachers of Cocke County are interested in their work. 
Though much remains to be done, educational conditions 
in this county are rapidly improving. The School Directors 
are realizing that better salaries must be paid the teachers 
in order to secure better results and in most of the Districts 
they are acting accordingly. 
A number of schools have been consolidated this year 
and the County Court has made an appropriation for High 
School purposes and has also appropriated a considerable 
amount for the encouragement of Secondary Schools. 'These 
additional appropriations will greatly assist in raising the 
standard of Cocke County educationally.
-P-A-G-E-311
—296— 
Considering local conditions, our teachers compare fav- 
orably with any in the State, and yet we have the best of 
reasons for believing that considerable improvement is yet 
ahead for us. / 
Judging from the interest being manifested at this time 
in the Public School work I confidently believe that the 
following school year will be the best in the history of 
Cocke County.

COFFEE COUNTY. 
I take great pleasure in reporting to you the work of 
Coffee County Teachers’ Institute for the year 1906. The 
institute met in the study hall of Manchester College on 
June 25, 1906. 
In the absence of the regular chairman, Prof. J. I. Ensey, 
Prof. F. M. Turner, President of Manchester College, kindly 
consented to preside over the institute. 
Prof. W. P. Charles acted as secretary in the absence 
of the regular secretary, Prof. S. L. Phillips. 
The programme, which had been previously arranged, 
was then taken up and carried out with a slight variation. 
The work of the instructors was very fine, especially 
that of Prof. M. M. Summar in School Management and 
Mrs. M. M. Summar, who had charge of the Primary work — 
fora part of the time.
-P-A-G-E-313
——298— 
Prof. P. B. Wingo, principal of the Manchester Public 
School, was with us two days and gave us valuable assist- 
ance. : 
I am under many obligations to Prof. F. M. Turner for 
the use of the building, and the efficient help rendered in the 
work of the institute. 
I desire to return to you my thanks for sending us such 
an able educator as Prof. M. M. Summar +o assist in the 
work of the institute. Both he and his estimable wife will 
be long remembered by the teachers of Coffee County. 
There was more interest in this institute than any we 
have ever had: in Coffee County. We are commencing a 
campaign of education in Coffee County which we @ hope 
will result i in better schools.

We spent the second Thursday and until 12 o’clock the fol- 
lowing Friday in examination. Had no failures. 
Prof. R. J. Hayes, of the Jackson City Schools, assisted 
in our institute. Professor Hayes proved to be a most effi- - 
cient worker and our teachers soon learned to love him. We 
would like so well to have him with us again. ‘Our institute 
seemed to be a regular feast for the teachers from. begin- 
ning to end.. We had in attendance 38 females and 30 males. . 
On each of the two Friday afternoons we had regular 
“Friday exercises,” consisting of readings, recitations and 
declamations.. These exercises were well attended by ‘the 
people in and around Alamo. The room was well filled at 
each entertainment. The young people acquitted themselves 
admirably. 
A strong resolution was unanimously passed approving 
the work of our representative, the Hon. J. P. Baldridge, in 
the last Legislature and endorsing what is known as the 
“Baldridge Bill.” 
Hon. Seymour A. Mynders, our State Superintendent of 
. Publie Instruction, was strongly endorsed and the resolu- 
tion suggested that the next Governor of our State retain 
him in the same relation to our public schools. 
Mrs. Mary Lee Conley was kind enough to loan us an 
organ and with Miss Marian Hess and Miss Mary Nunn 
as organisés and the teachers as vocalists we had the very 
best music during the institute. The greatest harmony and 
very best feeling prevailed during the entire time. 
. J. R. McDONALD, 
County Superintendent. 
During the first week in July we held an institute for 
the colored teachers. We have only a few colored teachers 
in our county. The work was done mainly by C. B. Powell 
and Jas. H. Roberts. They are both well prepared and did 
good teaching for the colored teachers. I.was sick the last 
two days and sent T. &. Lowry and R. C. McDonald to finish

Our institute was held in our new court house, which was

The educational outlook in this county is much brighter 
than a year ago. Our Teachers’ Association has been very 
successful and our teachers are much encouraged. We 
never had a Summer Normal in our county until this year, 
but’ we had eight weeks normal this year. The teachers 
attended reasonably well and are much improved. The 
examination this year was more rigid than any before and 
several failed, some of ten or fifteen years’ experience. We 
look for much improvement in the next year.

DICKSON COUNTY. 
Dickson County is having its share in the great educa- 
tional revolution now sweeping the State of Tennessee. The 
school term has been lengthened within the last few years 
from three to an average of nearly six months. There is 
a greater stimulus along educational lines now than there 
has ever been. Good school houses are being built, and in 
quite a number of instances schools are being consolidated. 
These houses are furnished with modern desks and other 
necessary conveniences to make the schools pleasant, at- 
tractive and’ comfortable. 
I have held quite a number of institutes in different 
places in the county, and I find it easy to get a large audi- 
ence at every appointment, with a great deal of interest 
manifested by the patrons. I succeeded so well with our bi- 
weekly meetings that I shall pursue this course again. 
Teachers would go into the remotest parts of the county, 
and take active part in the exercises. Dinner was always 
prepared by the patrons where institute was held and eaten 
on the school grounds. Every district is anxious for a 
teachers’ meeting this fall. This is the only plan which 
has aroused the people to a knowledge of their duty. 
We have a far better grade of teachers now than we 
have ever had, and the attendance is likewise far better. 
If we have as an efficient State Superintendent in the 
next administration as we have had in the last two, Tennes- 
see can vie with some of her sister States so boastful of 
their educational progress.

DYER COUNTY. 
The teachers of Dyer County met in annual institute at 
Dyersburg, Monday, June 11, 1906, and closed their session 
June 21, with a two days’ examination. 
Prof. J. H. Stover, of Fulton, Ky., was conductor, 
assisted by Supt. S. B. Tatum, Miss Josephine Tardiff, of 
Union City; Miss N. Dorah Bowen, G. B. Harris and W. 
L. Hunt. 
We wish to make special mention of the excellent instruc- 
tion given by Mr. Stover and Miss Tardiff, and wish to 
thank Superintendent Mynders for sending them to us. 
The institute was well attended by a body of earnest, 
enthusiastic teachers and much interest was manifested 
throughout the session. Considering the character of work 
done by our teachers during the institute we feel assured 
of the fact that Dyer County is making good progress in 
the development of its public school system. Captain Myn- 
ders visited our institute and gave an address of interest to 
the teachers; and in the afternoon he addressed a large audi- 
ence of the citizens and teachers of the county, pleading 
for better facilities for educating his clients, the boys and 
girls of Tennessee. His co-worker in the educational cam- 
paign in West Tennessee, Prof. P. P. Claxton, did much 
in his strong and eloquent appeal, to arouse united interest 
‘in the cause of education. . 
The colored teachers had a week’s institute beginning 
June 11, conducted by Professor Fort, Principal of the 
Bruce High School of this place. 
Professor Fort gave the colored teachers a two days’ 
examination at the close of the institute. 
The teachers of the county are better organized and the 
schools in better condition than ever before. I have done 
considerable persona] work among the schools of the county 
during the past two years, and note greatly improving condi- 
tions everywhere. The greatest defect in our public school

system at present is non-attendance and irregular attend- 
ance. We hope this can and will be remedied soon. _

FAYETTE COUNTY. 
The Teachers’ Annual Institute for Fayette County began 
June 11 and closed June 16. This was the most successful 
and helpful institute that has been held in our county within 
my knowledge. 
Prof. B. F. Watson, of Kenton, was the instructor from 
out of the county, and did excellent work. Prof. A. L. 
Rhoton, of the Chair of Mathematics in the Southwestern 
Baptist University at Jackson, was a welcome and helpful 
visitor. The rest of the work of the institute was ably 
done by our own county teachers. 
The notable feature of the improvement over former 
institutes was the addition to a deep and lively interest in 
all that was done, a willingness and even eagerness to take 
part in every exercise and discussion. 
A thorough examination was given at the close of the 
institute a year ago, and those who made high grades on 
that annual examination and participated in the exercises of 
_the association-and the institute regularly, as well as taught 
successfully,during the year, had their certificates renewed
-P-A-G-E-324
—309— 
at the close of this institute, hence the small number to take 
the examination at the close this year. 
The colored institute opened Tuesday, June 26, and closed 
with.the examination, June 30.. It was well attended and 
successfully conducted by N. G. Walker, assisted by other 
colored teachers. The County Superintendent addressed the 
teachers from time to time and observed closely the work 
of the institute. I think much good was accomplished.

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
I herewith submit to you the report of the Annual Teach- 
ers’ Institute of Fentress County, which was held at James- 
town, Tenn. The work was conducted by Prof. 8S. H. Prof- 
fitt and Supt. E. H. Boyd, both of Cookeville, Tenn. These 
_ gentlemen, with the assistance of Prof. R. C. Cowper, Dr. 
Wood and myself, have rendered the greatest service given 
the teachers of this county in many years. I feel that the 
teachers leave the institute better qualified to do their work 
this year than ever before. . 
This closed one of the most successful school years Fen- 
tress County has ever had. Ten years ago the average 
length of term was forty-seven days, last year we had 
eighty-seven days, and if we get our part of the Tolett fund 
this year our schools will surely run five months. We had 
longer terms last year and our attendance proportionately 
better than ever before. 
There seems to bea general awakening along educational 
lines among all concerned, and the future of our county will 
certainly show rapid progress. 
We are exceeding glad to know that on Sept. 5 we are
-P-A-G-E-326
—311— : . . 
to have the State Superintendent speak to us in behalf of 
our schools. This will be the first time a State Superin- 
tendent ever came to this county for such a purpose.

FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
‘The past year has witnessed more than the ordinary 
activity along educational lines, accompanied with .consid- 
erable strife between the advocates of progress and those 
of ultra-conservatism, but the end of the year finds us on 
higher ground. 
The idea of consolidation of schools is growing in the 
minds of the people, and we have several districts that have 
furnished splendid examples of what may be accomplished 
along that line. 
The monthly teachers’ meetings have been well attended 
through the whole year, and have served to mould public 
sentiment on educational questions, and to inspire the 
teachers with higher ideals. 
The ten days’ work in the Annual Institute showéd an 
improvement in the personnel of the teaching force and 
more of the. teacher-spirit than ever before. The small 
number of failures in the examinations show that the teach- 
ers have employed their time well in self-improvement,

JOHN T. RENNOLDs, 
County Superintendent. 
- GIBSON COUNTY. 
The institute met at the Court-house in Trenton, Mon- 
day, May 14, 1906, and continued two weeks. The colored 
institute met in the Colored College, Monday, May 21, and 
contined one week. 
Both institutes were under the general supervision of 
the County Superintendent as conductor, who was assisted 
by the best and most progressive teachers of the county as 
_ instructors. In the selection of instructors this year, as 
before, it was the purpose of the County. Superintendent to 
secure those who would elevate and magnify the office of 
the teacher, and give to them broader views and higher 
ideals of what true teaching means. In addition to teach- 
ing the subject-matter, each instructor gave special instruc- 
tions as to the best methods of teaching the subject under 
consideration, recognizing the fundamental truth that
-P-A-G-E-332
—315— 
teachers must not only know the “what,” but the “when,” 
the “why,” and the “how” of teaching every subject. 
The work of both institutes was eminently practical and 
purely professional, made so by giving each member of the 
institute something pleasant and profitable to do each day. 
It was a working institute from which “glittering generali- 
ties,” “fanciful flights of oratory,” and “flimsy fads’ for 
tickling the popular risibles were practically eliminated. A 
daily program was printed and carried out almost to the 
letter, thus rendering the work regular and systematic. As 
a result of this systematizing, teachers and the general pub- 
lic recognize the summer institute as a practical business 
educational institution with definite aims and well-defined 
purposes, rather than an opportunity, at public expense, for 
the display of Fourth of July oratory, elocutionary pyro- 
technics, instrumental aesthetics and vocal gymnastics. 
You will observe that a larger per cent of the appli- 
-eants for certificates failéd on examination than ever be- 
fore. Nearly 33 per cent of the whites, and of the colored 
nearly 73 per cent. This can be attributed to at least two 
causes: (1) Many of the applicants were immature pupils 
cf the primary schools. (2) The County Superintendent 
is making the examinations more rigid, that the standard 
of teaching may be raised. Immature boys and girls and 
incompetent men and women should not be permitted to 
wreck and ruin the future manhood and womanhood of our 
State by false and vicious teaching. ‘As the teachers are so 
will the schools be; as the schools are so will the State be.”

GILES COUNTY. 
We are in the midst of an educational campaign which 
will culminate in the county rally, Oct. 1. An educational 
platform was drawn up and adopted at the institute, every 
district is the county is organized, and district rallies are 
being held. These rallies are usually well attended, and 
much interest is manifested generally. I am of the opinion 
the tax levy for school purposes will be raised soon, and I 
look for a nine months’ term. The average salary paid 
teachers was better last year than ever before; new houses — 
are goirig up; the enrollment and average attendance of 
pupils are improving, and, upon the whole, we are greatly 
encouraged. . . 
The institute was held in the new Martin College—an 
ideal place. Methods were both demonstrated and discussed. 
The presence and help of Prof. F. M. Massey, special in- 
structor sent by the State, added greatly to the life and 
interest of the institute. My teachers were greatly benefited 
by his enthusiastic spirit-and profound scholarship. 
Applicants for certificates who passed creditable exami- 
nations last year, and whose attendance upon the monthly 
meetings has been satisfactory, were not required to take 
the examinations.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
The Annual County Institute for Grainger County was 
held in Madison Academy, at Rutledge, June 25-30. The 
attendance was the largest since my election as County
-P-A-G-E-340
—321— 
Superintendent, six years ago, and the interest was the best 
I have ever seen in this county. 
The Grainger Teachers’ Association was reorganized 
with Prof. Sam R. Wester, chairman, and Prof. A. E. Duns- 
more, secretary. Eivery teacher in the county is a member 
of this association. Our teachers study. White’s Pedagogy, 
White’s School Management, and the Little Schoolmistress. 
In Grainger County we hold educational rallies in every 
district during the school term, and we find that this is doing 
a great deal to bring about a better interest and co-opera- 
tion of parents, directors and members of the County Court. 
The attendance in some districts is not what it ought to 
be, and it is the opinion of our people that the only way 
to remedy this is to have a compulsory school law passed for 
this county. We have some very good houses for country 
. Schools, but we need more good houses and fewer schools. 
Our school term is now five months, when but a few years 
since we only had public school from three to four months 
in the year. Teachers’ salaries have advanced from $20 
and $25 per month to $30 and $40 within the last few 
years. The County Superintendent’s salary has advanced 
from $150 to $400 within the last five years. 
Graingér County needs a county high school, and it 
is hoped that the new County Court will take up this matter 
at once and levy a tax, as provided by law, to establish at 
least one high school. We need the Montgomery County 
school law in Grainger County very much, as the director 
system i is a failure here. .

GREENE COUNTY. 
Extensive repairs on the Greeneville School building 
made it necessary to change the location of the annual insti- 
tute even after announcements had been published. The 
‘work was.done at Holston College, in Moshejm, where 
ideal conditions for good work existed. Your representa- 
tive, Supt. S. G. Gilbreath, was with us at the opening and 
enthused all with his splendid address on service. Good 
work was done by the entire faculty, and education received 
a great stimulus from the meeting. 
In addition to this county institute, four examinations 
for teachers was presented by myself at Tusculum, Bailey- 
ton, Chuckey and Mosheim, and the teachers of the county 
are now better qualified than for years. A number of those 
who would make no progress were taken care of by these 
examinations, and the county relieved of their services. A 
part of these made quite a howl, but this has passed by and 
the better element are rejoicing over being released from 
such teachers. 
District’ directors are awakening to the necessity of con- 
solidation and better salaries, and all together the conditions 
are now favorable for great progress in the future. 
My report will show an increase on most items that go to 
make a successful system, and with a vigorous administra- 
tion of educational affairs of this county in the near future, 
grand results should be achieved. 
More and better educational addresses have been deliv- 
ered in Greene County the past year than ever in the his- 
tory of the county, and as a result sentiment is demanding 
better. educational advantages than ever before in this’ 
county. To meet this I have endeavored to elevate the stand- : 
ard of teaching and inspire teachers to become profes- 
sional teachers, and should no reaction take place, educa- 
tional success in Greene 'is assured.

GRUNDY COUNTY. 
As has been the custom for several years past, the An- 
nual Teachers’ Institute for Marion and Grundy Counties 
convened at Monteagle, June 18, and continued in session 
for two weeks. There were eighty odd teachers in attend- 
ance and much interest was manifested and the attendance 
was more regular than ever before. The teachers seemed 
anxious to learn, and took advantage of every opportunity 
for improvement. Besides the regular work, there was a 
period each day for lectures, and these periods were filled 
by members of the faculty of the University of the South | 
and other educators, and proved to be a valuable part of 
the work. : 
The teachers, by a unanimous vote, decided to meet in 
Monteagle next year, the last week in June and the first 
week in July. Monteagle is an ideal place for a teachers’ 
institute, and teachers from other counties are cordially 
invited to attend.

HANCOCK COUNTY. 
We think there is some progress being made along the 
line of education in this county. Prof. Burke, who was
-P-A-G-E-346
—327— 
sent by the State Superintendent to conduct the institute, - 
is a man well suited to the work. Large crowds of citizens 
came to hear his talks, which were very instructive as well 
as entertaining. , 
Our greatest difficulty at present is to get school direc- 
tors to pay salaries sufficient to keep our good teachers in 
the county. It tends to keep the quality of the teaching 
force down when other counties around us are offering good 
teachers $10 per month more than our directors are willing 
to pay. We are trying to keep the standard of qualifications 
of teachers as high as any of the surrounding counties, and 
we hope the directors will make teaching remunerative 
enough that people will qualify themselves to follow it as a 
profession.

HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
The Annual County Institute for Hardeman County was 
held at Bolivar, June 25-30. The institute was conducted 
by the County Superintendent and Prof. Sam F. Howard, of 
Humboldt, who was sent to us by the State Superintendent. 
Prof. Howard’s work was efficient and satisfactory. 
The work was divided so that the primary and secondary 
‘teachers occupied separate rooms. With a very few excep- 
tions ail of our teachers attended the whole time of the insti- 
tute. The enrollment was larger than ever in the history 
of the county. 
Prof. J. A. Baber, of Huntington, was with us one day, 
and delivered an appropriate address upon English Gram- 
mar. Prof. Watters, of Martin, also gave us a splendid lec-_ 
ture upon “How to Arouse an Interest in a Country School.” 
The outlook in Hardeman County is encouraging. The 
last General Assembly reduced our school districts from 
twenty-one to nine. It is very probable that the County 
Court will raise the school tax. Rural schools have been 
_ consolidated, and good substantial houses are being built. 
Teachers are beginning to. realize the great need of pro- 
fessional training. 
The County Teachers’ Association is doing telling work. 
Monthly meetings are held and a series of rallies are planned
-P-A-G-E-348
—329— 
among the rural schools. A reading circle has been organ- 
ized and the prescribed course of study will be pursued. 
The colored teachers had a splendid institute the first 
week of July. About fifty-eight teachers were enrolled. 
Their work was satisfactory.

HARDIN COUNTY. 
A large per cent of the teachers of the county, besides 
a number from other counties, attended the two weeks’ 
summer institute which was held at Savannah. The time 
was profitably spent in presenting matter and method to 
the teachers in a way that is tangible to their everyday work. 
Monday of the second week was observed as directors’ and 
County Court day, and on this occasion the practical side 
of school matters was discussed by members of the Court 
and directors’ body by members of tte institute faculty and 
by the Superintendent. 
The County Teachers’ Association has completed a suc- 
cessful and effective year’s work. These meetings are held 
on the first Saturday of each calendar month. The fore- 
noon of each session is devoted to the reading course, which,
-P-A-G-E-350
—331— 
during the past year, consisted of White’s School Manage- 
ment and American Literature. During the ensuing year 
the regular reading course prescribed by the State will be 
pursued. A series of rallies will be held in the several dis- 
- tricts, and by means of these we expect to arouse new school 
enthusiasm. The campaign of last year aided materially in 
bringing about a better school spirit among our people. : 
The following resolutions were adopted by the teachers 
at the close of the summer institute: 
Whereas, The teachers of Hardin County, having held 
one of the most successful institutes in the history of the 
county, and having enjoyed many courtesies, pleasures and 
benefits; therefore, be it : 
_ Resolved, 1. That we thank our instructors for their 
patient, untiring and able instruction. 
2. That we appreciate the efforts of our County Super- 
intendent, W. O. Mangum, to raise the standard of teach- 
ing, and that we give him our loyal support in all things that 
have for their ends the improvement of the schools of Har- 
din County. 
3. That we express our thankfulness to State Superin- 
tendent Mynders for sending us an efficient instructor in the 
person of B. F. Watson. 
4, That we appreciate the high character of work being 
done for the schools of the State by Superintendent, Mynders, 
and that we pledge him our support in his able efforts to 
benefit the schools of Tennessee.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
The Hawkins County Institute convened at the Rogers- 
ville Synodical College building and continued in session 
seven days. The attendance of teachers was indeed very 
good and much interest was manifested in all the work of 
the institute. Our Teachers’ Association elected new officers _ 
for the year and outlined the work to be done. We have 
planned for a rally in September. 
_A number of teachers were examined on the reading 
course selected at the institute last year. This course will 
no doubt improve our teaching force. Most all of our teach- 
’ ers take school journals. 
I am sure that we have better teachers now than for- 
merly. We are trying to make improvement along this line 
each year. 
The length of our school term was ninety-seven (97) 
days. Wecould have run our schools longer, but we need so 
many new school buildings we are trying to build each year 
as many as possible. Some good buildings were erected dur- 
ing the past year. : 
We still have a sufficient amount of school money on 
hand to enable us to pay our teachers at the end of each 
month this year. / 
The railroads now under construction in this county will, 
when completed, increase our tax assessment about one mil- 
lion dollars, which, of course, will be a great help to our 
schools. 
Our County Court, at the April term, raised the county 
levy for school purposes to 25 cents on the $100. State 
Supt. S. A. Mynders made an address to the Court at that 
time. The new County Court, elected in August, will be in 
favor of better schools, more money, ete.

HENDERSON COUNTY. 
I am pleased to hand you the report of my institute, 
which was a very marked success. 
We had the largest enrollment known in the history of 
the county. 
Several of my teachers are holding State certificates, and 
we are gradually but surely securing a more permanent set 
of teachers. 
Salaries are increasing, making the work more inviting, 
and the teachers are very much interested in every educa- 
tional movement in the county, showing they mean to stay 
with the work. 
The colored institute, under Prof. Pool, was in session 
during the time of the other institute, and did some good 
work, 
On the whole, we are making excellent progress and hope 
soon to have a six months’ free school in every house.

HENRY COUNTY. 
The schools in Henry County, for the school year end- . 
ing June 30, 1906, were well attended and gave general 
. satisfaction. : 
The Henry County Teachers’ Institute was held July 9 
to 14, inclusive. Examinations, July 18 and 14. 
'- Our institutes have been growing in interest for several 
years, but the consensus of opinion was that this was the 
best and most. enthusiastic institute ever held in Henry 
County. The attendance was good and interest incréased at 
every meeting. : 
Auxiliary to the annual institute, we , have a county 
association, which holds bi-monthly sessions during the 
entire year. 
The educational outlook for Henry County is encour- ” 
. aging. Teachers are better remunerated and have fewer © 
os difficulties, the people are more interested and attendance 
is better than at any time in the past. 
‘On the 26th of June the cornerstone of the E. W. Grove 
Q High School building was laid, at which time there was a 
. grand educational rally, attended by citizens of every part of 
the county and many from the surrounding counties. Sev- 
.-eral splendid addresses on the subject of education, were 
' -délivered, but one: by State Superintendent Mynders de-. 
Serves special mention, as it was not only favorably re- 
ceived by all, but went far toward creating an interest-and 
establishing confidence in our public schools among the peo- 
"ple of the rural districts.

HICKMAN COUNTY. 
The annual institute was held at Centreville from June 
4 to 9. There was much interest manifested by both teach- 
ers and friends of education. The large hall in the Training 
School building was filled at each meeting by enthusiastic 
hearers. 
_ The address by Supt. S. A. Mynders was highly enjoyed. 
It has done much to arouse interest throughout the county. 
The general condition of our schools is rapidly increas- 
ing. The term is longer, teachers better and school-houses 
more convenient and commodious. Our county gets for the 
present year $1,905 from the Tollett fund. This will give 
each school an average of six months’ term. 
: There were twenty-two failures to get certificates. This 
has had a very healthy effect with directors and teachers. 
Our people are in favor of a compulsory educational law 
that compels. The County Superintendent, in addressing 
the people of the county at the court-house in January, took 
a vote as to who favored compulsory education, and found, 
to his surprise, that every one present favored it.

No annual institute was held this year. My teachers 
attended the State Institute at Cumberland City with good 
results. : 
With a few exceptions our schools were very satisfac- 
torily taught last year. The attendance was reasonably 
good. The educational work is improving, yet we have a 
great, deal to do. We are using every effort to build up the 
work.

JACKSON COUNTY. 
The Jackson County Teachers’ Annual Institute, which 
met June 4 and continued six days, showed a large enroll- 
ment for the county and a very much higher per cent of 
attendance than any previous institute. 
All of.the teachers manifested the greatest interest in 
the institute and seemed determined to secure the greatest 
benefit possible from it. 
I had a good corps of instructors, and they did their part 
.well, They were always willing, ready.and waiting to do 
their part. s 
The teachers of Jackson County join me in expressing 
our sincere thanks to Hon. S. A. Mynders for sending us 
such a splendid instructor in Prof. M. L. Caneer,. of Car- 
thage,-Tenn. His instructions were earnest, forceful, inter- 
esting and highly beneficial. 
The address during the institute by Profs. Proffit and 
Hatfield, of Cookeville; Prof. Gillentine, of Lafayette, and 
Attorneys W. W. Draper and R. C. Gaw, and Rev. Hewgly, 
were interesting and well received by the institute. The 
recitations that were rendered were entertaining. , 
We hold monthly teachers’ associations at different 
points throughout the county while the schools are in ses- 
sion. These meetings have been a stimulus to the educa- 
tional interest of the county. The people are manifesting 
a greater interest in education than ever before. They de-
-P-A-G-E-363
~ —3842— 
sire better schools and are interested in the education of 
their children. 
The teaching corps of this county is better qualified and 
doing better work than ever before. The County Court has 
manifested a greater interest by raising the school tax from 
15 cents on $100 to 25 cents. 
Some. schools have been consolidated and others are 
being consolidated. Some new houses have. been com- 
pleted and others are near completion. : 
We are hopeful and can see the dawning of a better day 
for Jackson County. More money and better-prepared teach- 
ers are the sources through which it must come. May that 
better day soon dawn.

JAMES COUNTY. 
James County Institute opened July 2 and closed July 6, 
1906. The attendance was not so good this year as last, 
owing to the fact that six of the schools of the county had 
no teachers. However, all of those schools have been sup- 
plied. Certificates issued in my annual report includes those 
issued at the two days’ examination in August. 
The enrollment for the year ending June 30, 1906, was. 
better than that of the preceding year by about 200. The
-P-A-G-E-365
—344— 
graded system and promotions increased the daily attend- 
ance beyond expectation. 
You will notice that the County Court raised the rate of 
taxation from 35 cents per $100 to 40 cents per $100; county 
* 25 cents and State 15 cents. 
At our County Institute we organized a ‘Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation.”. Our teachers have secured the Reading Circle 
Course books, and we are devoting the principal part of our 
time in the monthly teachers’ meetings to these books.

D. A. SUANFIELD, 
County Superintendent. 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
Our institute this summer was one of more than or- 
dinary interest. 
The lectures and talks of Mrs. G. Mynderse, of Knox. 
ville, who was sent by State Superintendent Mynders, gave 
added interest to the institute. Her management of a class 
of small children, who had never been to school was still an- 
other attractive feature of the institute and was a means of 
entertainment to the visiting public. 
The cause of education in the county is making slow, but 
gradual progress. We build a new school-house most every 
year, and are putting in some modern desks, both in new 
buildings and in others. 
We had an educational rally last summer and are plan-' 
ning to have another this summer. The one we had last 
summer has been productive of much good and we are look- 
ing for still greater results from the one we expect to have 
this season. 
Our teachers are organized into a Reading Circle and
-P-A-G-E-367

seem to be enthusiastic in regard to the work outlined for 
the fall meetings of our Teachers’ Association.

JOHNSON COUNTY. 
The educational interest in Johnson County the past year 
has been fairly satisfactory. ' Our two weeks’ institute held 
_in June was a splendid success, and we highly appreciate 
the kindness of Superintendent Mynders in sending us so 
able a man as Prof. 8. C. Brown to conduct it. He was ably 
assisted my Professor Matney, of Asheville, N. C. The at- 
tendance was the best we have ever had, and the interest 
good. Four States were represented. 
We reorganized our Teachers’ Association, and have had 
one meeting, and a good number of the teachers in at!end- 
ance. We have usually had good attendance at these meet- 
ings, and they have been of much benefit to our teachers. 
: We also organized a “State Teachers’ Reading Circle,” 
and the teachers are very enthusiastic about: the work. I 
predict much good from this source. 
The educational rally that we had last year done a great 
deal of good in arousing the patrons to a sense of their duty. 
The County Court at the July term made a small in- 
crease in the tax levy for school purposes. 
The general interest of the patrons is much better than it
-P-A-G-E-369
—348— 
has been, and the teachers are taking good school journals, 
buying a number of books on school management, teach- 
ing, ete. 
We are progressing on general lines and: striving to get 
our teachers better prepared, patrons more interested and a 
healthier educational sentiment aroused than we have ever | 
bad in our county. We hope to get a compulsory educational 
system soon, for we need it. . 
We had a splendid parents’ day and Thanksgiving pro- 
gramme in every district of the county. These exercises 
were well attended and received by the patrons and much 
good was accomplished by having these exercises. 
We are going to push the work in our coynty, and our 
aim is to strive to be in the near future second to none in 
the State.

R. P. DONNELLY, 
County Superintendent. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
In compliance with the requirements of law and the rules 
of your office, I herewith hand you statistical report of the 
public schools of Knox County for the scholastic year ending 
June 80, 1906. Accompanying the same, you will find table 
showing the scholastic population of Knox County as re- 
ported by the district clerks for the scholastic year begin- 
ning July 1, 1906. This population will be used in making - 
apportionments of all moneys belonging to Knox County for 
the current year. I hand you also copies of the Trustee’s 
quarterly and annual reports for the scholastic year which
-P-A-G-E-371
—850— 
ends June 30, 1906. In submitting these reports, I ask the 
privilege of making a few remarks intended to call your at- 
tention to some of the most pointed features connected with 
the past year’s work and I trust that all will receive favor- 
able consideration at your hands. 
SCHOLASTIC POPULATION, ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. 
The scholastic population of all Knox County for the year 
1905-’06 was 28,204. Of this number, 10,682 belonged to 
the city of Knoxville and 17,522 to the rural districts. The 
enrollment for the city was 5,833 and for the rural districts 
12,225, making an aggregate enrollment of 18,058 for the 
entire county. Considering the enrollment for the city 
and country districts separately, we find 54.6 per cent. of 
the children of the former and 70 per cent. of the children 
of the latter enrolled in school. The average daily attend- 
ance of the city was 4,595 and for the country districts 7,425. 
Comparing the average daily attendance of the city and rural 
districts with the entire scholastic population of each place, 
we find that 48 per cent. of the children of the city and 
- 42 per cent. of the children of the country districts were in 
school. ‘The actual gain in number of pupils enrolled and in 
average daily attendance over last year is as follows: City’s 
gain in enrollment, 157, and in average daily attendance, 89. 
The county’s gain in enrollment is 899 and in average daily 
attendance, 739. , 
The enrollment for the country districts, taking into 
‘consideration all of the circumstances, is to be regarded as 
excellent. The average daily attendance, on the other hand, 
as shown by the figures, is to be regarded as poor. Espe- 
ciaily is this. true with the country districts. But looking 
at the situation as it actually presents itself, a different con- 
clusion is to be reached. <A school term of eight months 
which begins in August necessarily extends through the en- 
tire winter season, which makes it impracticable for many
-P-A-G-E-372
—351— 
children that enter at first to remain in school throughout 
the session. Cold, bad weather, long, muddy roads, a re- 
stricted financial condition of many parents and sickness of 
children cause a falling off that will not permit a good show- 
ing when figures are presented giving the entire population, 
enrollment, and average daily attendance. Along this line of 
work special stress of effort has been given by officials 
and teachers and a marked improvement is noticeable. 
‘LENGTH OF TERM AND PROGRESS OF PUPILS. 
It is with a feeling of pride that I call your attention to - 
the progress that has been made in the work of lengthening 
the term. From the table which I herewith enclose, you will 
see that the term for the city was 179 days and for the 
country districts 157 days. This means that the schools of 
the county outside of the city are now running something 
like eight months and represents a gain since 1900 of nearly 
_ 60 days or three months. This increase of term is proving 
a blessing to many parents who are now enabled to keep 
their children in school a sufficient time each year to enable 
them to make some real advancement in the work of the 
grades. 
_ The enrollment in the higher grades is increasing very 
rapidly. In 1901 the enrollment in the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 
grades aggregated 1,492. For the year ending June 30, 
1906, the enrollment in the above grades was 2,494. These 
figures are for the schools outside of the city and represent 
a gain of 1,002 for a period covering five years. This in- 
crease shows the tendency of the parents to keep their chil- 
dren in school until the course is completed and is indica- 
tive of a growing sentiment favorable to the education which | 
the higher grades provide. In course of time, the higher 
grades of the public schools of the rural districts will be 
as well patronized as the corresponding grades of the city 
schools are now. When such is realized an ample support 
will be found for high schools.

SUMMER SCHOOL. 
It is a source of pleasure to mention the Summer School 
of the South. I have been giving short reports of the work 
of this school for four years. The session of 1906 was equal 
in every respect to the sessions that have preceded it. The 
apportionments that have been coming from the General 
Educational Board were discontinued this year. It was 
thought, at first, that the school could not succeed without 
these’ allowances,: but the people of Knoxville and Knox 
County responded liberally to the demands of the occasion 
and by the untiring efforts of Prof. P. P. Claxton the school 
was made a pronounced success. It is impossible for me 
to say too much by way of praise for the Summer School. 
The good that it has done for Knox County cannot be ex- 
- pressed in words and I trust that future session will be held 
to assist us in the work of providing better needs for the 
public schools. This school, in view of its importance to the 
people, should receive a substantial financial recognition on 
the part of the State. The State could do nothing better than 
to provide for the permanent existence of this school at the 
University of Tennessee and thus make it possible for it to 
be recognized as an institution dedicated to the noble purpose 
of building up a strong teaching force for the schools not 
only of Tennessee but also of the entire Southern section. 
HicH ScHOOL. 
The County Court of Knox County at its January session 
of last year levied a five cents tax for the support and 
elected a County Board of Education to manage a high 
school. It is estimated that the levy for this purpose will 
provide something like $15,000. The Board of Education, 
after a careful consideration, decided to establish a central 
high school which should be located at some point con- 
_ venient to the masses of the people and which should have a 
course of study embracing four years’ work and including, in
-P-A-G-E-374
—355— 
addition to the regular academic work, such features as do- 
mestic science, industrial training and commercial work. The 
property of the Tennessee Normal College at Fountain City 
was purchased for this purpose and preparations were com- 
pleted for the opening of school on the 10th of September 
this year. The school opened at the appointed time with an 
initial attendance of more than 200 children. The outlook | 
is favorable for an attendance of more than 400 students the 
first year. A corps of excellent teachers has been elected 
and excellent work is assured. I am firmly of the belief that 
this county is to have one of the best high s schools that is to 
be found anywhere in the South. 
In addition to the Central High School, the board has es- 
tablished another near Concord. The property of the Far- 
ragut School, estimated to be worth about $10,000, has been 
turned over to the County Board of Education for’ the 
purpose of running a high school in which agricultural edu- 
cation is to be emphasized in connection with the other 
features mentioned above for the Central High School. The 
high school work means a great deal for the entire school. 
system of the county. Ere long, we trust the primary, sec- 
ondary and high school work will be correlated in a way so 
as to make a system that will provide a uniform course from 
the kindergarten to entrance in classes in the State uni- 
versity. 
In the Trustee’s annual report, y you will find the balance 
to the credit of the rural districts to be $54,582.90. This 
amount in connection with the money that is to come in this 
year ought to enable the districts to run their schools eight 
months. As you understand, the school money is appor-_ 
tioned on a scholastic basis. This arrangement causes some 
districts to receive a great deal more money than others. 
The districts that have a congested population are thus 
enabled’ to educate their children more cheaply than those 
who have a large area and a sparsely populated community. 
So it is that some districts will have a longer term than
-P-A-G-E-375
—+356— 
others. There ought to be a system devised whereby all of 
the children of the county would have the same privileges, 
especially when days in school are concerned. Any other ar- 
rangement is inequitable and unjust. 
The schools of the county have opened with a splendid at- 
tendance. In fact, the enrollment in some places is so large 
that it is impossible for the teacher in charge to anything 
like approach the service that should be rendered. Upon 
the whole, I am confident that the work is in a better con- 
dition than at any other time in the history of the county. 
If at any time, I can serve you in any way, I shall be 
pleased to do so: Respectfully submitted, 
Sam E. HILL, 
County Superintendent. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. | 
The State Institute, held here, was a marked success. 
The earnestness which characterized the work of all con- 
cerned was remarkable, and the work and its results are 
certainly highly satisfactory to all. The State certificates 
issued have in many instances been awarded the best places 
in the county to teach, but they have not been recognized so 
fully as the County Superintendent urged, a condition which 
emphasizes the importance of a change from the director to 
the board system. County certificates were issued to those 
who failed to make the required grades in the State exami- 
nation based upon State reports, and were issued to those 
whose average was above 75, and who made no grade less 
than 50. There is a strong school sentiment in thig county 
and a great deal was accomplished toward establishing a 
high school by agitation of this question. Supt. A. E. 
Darrah made a strong and eloquent appeal to the County
-P-A-G-E-376
—857-—— 
Court on the subject, which was received with favor by that 
body. Dr. R. H. Harvey, representing the Court, favored 
the movement, and the County Superintendent gave it his 
endorsement. The enthusiasm among the people is at a 
high pitch and it is the determination of all to make this 
our greatest educational year. 
The address by Superintendent Mynders was heard by 
a large and appreciative audience and created a profound 
impression. Sentiment is strong here for his retention in 
the office, and resolutions were adopted demanding it of 
our next Governor. Other resolutions were thuse commend- 
ing the faculty, County Superintendent, and school officials 
for their interest. ‘The school rally is planned to be the 
greatest in the State this year. Demands are coming from 
many people of the county for better teachers and higher 
school taxes are well favored..

LOUDON COUNTY. 
The Loudon County white teachers’ institute of 1906 
was, for work and enthusiasm, far superior to anything we 
have ever had in this county. Without any preliminaries our 
teachers “buckled” down to work and kept at it, without 
any “let-up,” for two weeks. From the very first hour they: 
seemed to understand that they had assembled for work, 
and they worked. They were better prepared for work in 
every respect than they had ever been before, and the work 
done was far more profitable to them. 
Our attendance was not equal to that of last year. 
Several who felt that they were not as well prepared as they 
ought to be, absented themselves at the last moment, and 
thus have dropped out of the profession. This is as it should 
be, and we have no regrets. 
Most of the time was devoted to methods. Special atten-
-P-A-G-E-378
—3859— 
tion was given to methods in Language, Reading, Grammar, 
Arithmetic, History and Geography. Our teachers have 
studied these subjects during the year in the association 
meetings and showed during the institute that these monthly 
meetings bear good fruit and lots of it. These meetings will 
continue during 1906 and 1907, 
The great rally of September, 1905, had much to. do 
with the success of this institute, and we think it would be 
advisable to have a similar rally every year. The speeches 
of State Superintendent Mynders, Prof. P. P. Claxton, Rev. 
W. T. Rodgers, Congressman Hale and Supt. Sam E. Hill 
are still ringing in the ears of our teachers, and this, in a 
great measure, explains the wonderful enthusiasm of the 
1906 institute. 
Our schools are improving in every way: Salaries are 
being gradually increased, one district paying not less than 
forty dollars per month. Terms are being lengthened all 
around. School directors are looking after the buildings 
more carefully, and, taking everything into consideration, 
the outlook is more hopeful than at any. time during our 
connection with and our knowledge of the county. ” 
We still hope (will it only remain a hope?) for the 
abolition of the directorate. As long as it exists the educa- 
tional wheels of the county will be clogged and hindered. 
It is hoped that the next Legislature will abolish it forever. 
Away with it!

MACON COUNTY. + 
The 1906 Macon County Teachers’ Annual Institute is 
conceded to have been the most interesting and best attended 
in the history of the county. 
The institute continued six days and consisted of a review 
of the public school curriculum, regular work in the theory 
and practice of teaching and lectures by the members of the 
faculty of instructors. : 
I am glad to report the reorganization of the Macon 
County Teachers’ Association ; the teachers are putting forth 
their best efforts to make this one of the sreatest agencies 
for educational progress. 
Every possible effort is being exerted to increase the ef: 
ficiency of the public schools by the elimination of the indif- 
ferent and incompetent teachers. Quite a number of appli- 
cants for teachers’ certificates failed to make the required 
grade in my recent examination. : / 
A graded course of study will be put into effective opera- 
tion this year. Our school buildings are in fairly good con- 
dition. I shall spend the greater part of my time in visiting 
the schools of the county during the fall term. Last year I 
visited each of the sixty-four schools of the county. 
A most interesting and successful institute for the col- 
ored teachers was held at Hughes by Prof. W. D. Greer, 
Principal of the M. and O. Academy, the leading school for 
the colored in the county. At the close of their institute the 
_ colored teachers organized the Macon County Colored Teach- 
ers’ Association, which promises to be a potent factor in 
arousing educational interest among the colored citizens. 
In conelusion I wish to say that the educational outlook 
in Macon County is extremely encouraging. Laboring unit- 
edly in a common cause with one common purpose we expect 
to accomplish great things for the cause of education during 
the year. -

D. HENRY. PIPER, 
County Superintendent. 
M’MINN COUNTY. 
Our annual institute convened July 16. We had in attend- 
ance sixty teachers. We have seventy white schools. The 
teaching profession has been considerably decreased in this 
county on account of the establishment of the R. F. D. sys- 
tem, many of the experienced teachers engaging in this 
work. Especially is this true of male teachers, only about 
one-fourth of our teachers being males. 
The general outlook in our county is good. Teachers are 
qualifying themselves better, school-houses are being built 
and repaired, the County High School is doing a good work 
in better qualifying teachers and creating a greater interest 
for a better education. The County Court, at the January 
term, increased the tax so that we now have 40 cents. Our 
school term the past year was five months, and we hope 
the present year to extend the time. 
There are many suggestions which we might make for 
the improvement of the system, but this matter should be 
left to the work of the Committee on School Law. of the 
Public School Officers’? Association. 
J congratulate you upon the marked improvement made 
throughout the State during your administration.

" W’NAIRY COUNTY. 
The McNairy County Teachers’ Institute began Monday, 
June 25, and continued one week, the last two days being 
given to examination and grading. The week was spent very 
profitably. The attendance was good from the start, and the 
average daily attendance was better than usual: We had 
with us Prof. A. L. Rhoten, of the Southwestern Baptist 
University, Jackson, Tenn. He imparted new ideas and new 
methods to the teachers, and gave them an inspiration which, 
I believe, will be the means of creating enthusiasm wherever 
they go. — - 
The outlook is more encouraging than ever before. Most 
of our schools are being taught in the winter, which insures 
longer terms and more satisfactory results. “At the April 
term of the County Court a special tax levy of 10 cents 
was made. This makes the total for the county 40 cents 
for school purposes, and entitles the county to share in the 
distribution. as provided in the Tollett bill, which will 
secure for us an average term of six months. 
An encouraging sign which I note is the disposition of 
school directors to employ the best equipped teachers. They 
are requiring a higher standard and are raising the salary 
accordingly. There has never been greater interest mani- 
fested in our schools than at present. The policy of the 
State Superintendent to maintain as few weak schools as
-P-A-G-E-385
—366— 
_ possible has proven to be a wise one. I have consolidated 
many small schools, and invariably the result has been satis- 
factory. Let us continue our plea for fewer schools, longer 
terms and more efficient teachers. 
I have given a good deal of time usually given to visit- 
ing schools to educational rallies. I find that the teachers 
as a rule are doing their work very well, but that the 
patrons are not. aroused as they should be, hence the neces- 
sity for having publi¢ meetings which will bring them 
out. I feel like more good has been accomplished at these 
meetings than has heretofore been done by visiting schools 
and holding institutes. I desire to impress upon public 
school workers the importance of district rallies.

Enclosed you will find reports of the institute held here 
last year. The examination was separate from the insti- 
tute. This was the first institute held in Madison County, 
and the teachers were a little slow to respond. Our institute 
was much better this year than last year. We cannot run 
the institute without some money to pay our instructors.

MEIGS COUNTY. 
The annual institute of Meigs County was held in Deca- 
tur, July 2-7, 1906. . 
The institute was conducted by Prof. W. L. Lawrence, ° 
one of the State instructors, who did some excellent and 
efficient work for the teachers of the county. Prof. F. H. 
Hurst, of Memphis, who is employed to teach in the county 
for the present school year, also gave some valuable aid. The 
institute as a whole was both enjoyable and beneficial. The 
- worst feature of the meeting was the small attendance of 
teachers. I find this was due largely to negligence of — 
directors, as no teachers have yet been employed in many of 
the schools. It seems from observation of our county insti- 
tutes that there should be some legislative enactment mak-
-P-A-G-E-390
—3T1— 
ing it obligatory on directors to employ teachers before the 
. opening of the Summer Normal. 
The past year has been one of the most profitable the 
county has ever had in public school work. The school terms 
were longer and the attendance better; school rallies were 
held in almost every school-house in the county. 
At the central rally in Decatur, Oct. 6, 1905, one of the 
. largest audiences the town ever had was addressed by ©

MONROE COUNTY. 
I submit you my annual réport of Monroe County and 
will say that the institute held at Madisonville this year was 
the most interesting and instructive ever held in this county. 
Professor Justus, of Chattanooga, had the work in charge, 
and was assisted by Prof. W. L. Wallace, of Newport, Ark.; . 
Mrs. Gennie Mynders, of Knoxville; Miss Sallie Mann, of 
Knoxville, and others from our county. We did not attempt 
any work in the texts at all the first week, but gave all the 
time to lectures and general discussions on many subjects 
of vital importance to the public schools of this county. 
The second week was devoted to examinations and practical 
work in the text. The forenoon of each day was devoted 
to examinations and the afternoon to practical work. ~ Hon. 
S. G. Gilbreath, of Chattanooga, visited the institute one 
day and in the afternoon addressed the institute.. Mrs.
-P-A-G-E-392
—~373— 
Mynders’ work (the primary work) was especially inter- 
esting and instructive and many teachers have gathered 
ideas from her that will be of vast importance to them and 
the pupils. Miss Mann aroused a great deal of enthusiasm 
by her work in Geography and Reading, while Professor 
Wallace was always ready with his Arithmetic. : 
. The school conditions are better than ever in the history 
of the county; we have an average term of 120 days this 
year, compared with 90 last year, and an increase in salary 
of 75 cents per month. At the January term of court the 
county school tax rate was raised from 10 cents to 25 cents, 
thus insuring more money for school purposes and, of 
course, long terms. 
Prospects are good for the consolidation of some of our . 
schools this year, just how many I cannot say, but we 
appreciate the need of fewer but better schools. 
The High School question is receiving quite a little dis- 
cussion now and an educational campaign for a County High 
School will be made this fall. 
A Teachers’ Association was formed at the County In- . 
stitute, with Prof. W. A. Jones; of Ironsburg, Tenn., as 
President, and it is planned to have a‘series of district 
meetings held this year, one in each civil district, at which 
all teachers in that district are expected to attend. At these 
meetings will be discussed the “ups and downs” of the 
teachers, but more especially any question of importance to 
the district, and the paramount question of all, the High 
School question. In this way we hope to arouse ‘public 
sentiment, and thus create a public demand for our County 
High School. 
In my report you will note that the number of teachers 
‘examined is 97, and number licensed is 82; 14 of those 
licensed are either Summer School students or excused 
from examination for other reasons. 
I find that of the 97 teachers examined, 10 have never 
studied anything above the primary branches, that 15 have
-P-A-G-E-393
~874— 
never taught, that only 8 have completed either 
school or college course. 
My report also embraces the second examination held 
for the licensing of teachers, which was held Aug. 3 and 4. 
The institute unanimously passed resolutions thanking 
Hon. S. A. Mynders for sending Miss Mann and Mrs. 
Mynders, also thanking Professor Justus for his earn- 
est and efficient work, also Professor Wallace for his pains- 
‘taking and interesting work.

  - MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
I'am sending herewith my annual report of the public schools 
of Montgomery County, which shows improvement when compared 
with my last report. 
Our schools are being better graded year by year, and there is 
much more system in the work, especially in classifying and pro- 
moting pupils. We have as good a corps of teachers as can be 
found in the rural schools of any county of the State, and a large 
majority of the teachers are in the work to stay. 
We closed our last term with more money on hand than we had 
when our new system was. established, which shows, after three 
years’ trial, that the eight-months’ uniform term will continue. 
Our finances were never in better condition, and our expendi- 
tures are guarded against all waste of funds. 
During my sixteen years’ service there has not been a single case
-P-A-G-E-395
—876— 
to be decided by the courts, except in the prosecution of one person 
for theft. of coal.’ 
Our institutes this year have been very helpful to all connected 
with the public schools. Besides some local workers, we employed 
Prof. Wickliffe Rose, of the Peabody College for Teachers; Dr. 
J. B. Wharey, of the Southwestern Presbyterian University; and 
Miss Mattie Butler, of the Trenton public schools, who did. excel- 
lent work. : 
The colored institute was conducted by instructors appointed by 
yourself, and I desire to state here that their work was entirely 
satisfactory. : 
All our teachers, county and city, are taking the regular course 
of study under your directions; and this, too, is satisfactory. 
P. L. Harwep, 
County Superintendent. 
MOORE COUNTY. 
The eighteenth annual session of the Moore County 
' Teachers’ Institute was held at the court house in Lynch- 
burg and,continued two weeks. This was one of the best 
institutes we have ever had. Large crowds attended each 
day. Much interest was taken in the work by the edunty 
teachers, visiting teachers, and the people of the county 
generally. The work of the institute consisted of a brief 
review of some of the public school branches, talks on 
pedagogy and the study of two choice pieces of English: by 
the teachers. Short talks on Physiology were made by 
Prof. Ben Gowen, of Baltimore, Md.; Dr. Arch Mitchell, of 
Tullahoma; Drs. Dance, Zoller, and Baldwin, of Lynch- 
burg, and Dr. Graham, of Booneville. 
The institute was also favored with an address on Liter- 
ature by Prof. E. A:. Fritter of the University of Middle
-P-A-G-E-396
—3TT— 
Tennessee. The work of Prof. C. F. Holt, who was sent us 
by the State Superintendent, deserves special mention. His 
talks on school management and the solution of difficult 
school problems were most interesting and instructive. The 
teachers unite in expressing the wish that he may be sent 
te our aid again next year. At the close of the institute an 
examination of teachers was held. For faithful work in the 
County Teachers’ Association, several experienced teachers 
who hold first-grade certificates were exempted. from ex- 
amination. : 
Our County Teachers’ Association, which is in its third 
year, will carry on the campaign for education in different 
districts of the county this fall. The work will consist chiefly 
of the State Teachers’ Reading Circle course of study. 
A number of new books will be added to our Teachers’ 
Library soon. The Lois School has a well-chosen library of 
over one hundred volumes. The pupils are reading these 
books and deriving much good from them. 
This closes a year of hard work. The County Superin- 
tendent visits each school in the county and endeavors to 
keep in touch with its work. 
The difficult problems of poor attendance and lack of in- 
terest in school matters still confront us. Yet there are 
some encouraging features. We now have a longer school . 
term than we have ever had. The average salary paid 
teachers is higher than it has ever been. Our County Court 
has increased the county school tax from 20 to 25 cents on 
the $100. On the whole the new school year opens with fair- 
ly good prospects and by united effort we hope to accomplish 
some good for the schools of Moore County.

MORGAN COUNTY. . 
More interest is being taken this year in the subject of . 
' education in this county than ever before. 
In proof of the above statement I give the following: 
During the last school year there have been established in 
this county three more “Secondary Schools.” One at Oakdale, 
one at Lancing, and one in the Second School District, known 
as the “Oakwood School.” Also the school tax has been 
raised by our Honorable County Court 10c. on the hundred 
dollars of taxable property, which makes our county school . 
tax at the present time 30c. on the hundred, which entitles us 
to our pro rata of the $50,000 to be distributed to various 
counties in order that their school terms may be six months. 
Now this 10c. increase and our pro rata of the $50,000 will 
make all our schools run six months this year, against 85 
days last year. The movement is now on foot and progress- 
-ing*nicely to establish a high school.for this county. 
A large per cent. of the teachers are taking educational 
journals and all readily take part in “District Educational . 
* Rallies,” which are held from time to time in different paris 
of the county while the schools are in session. 
The daily attendance is gradually growing in’ all the 
schools, but is not what it ought to be, and will likely not be 
until this county gets the “panacea” for this dreaded 
“malady,” which is a “compulsory school law.” 
. Our institue this year was the best attended and the 
greatest enjoyed of any ever held in this county, and the 
good work done by Messrs. Lankford, Shipp, and Broyles 
will have a lasting impression on Morgan County teachers 
throughout their existence on this mundane sphere of ours.

OBION COUNTY. 
Our County Institute was, in my estimation, a very 
great, success. Our teachers worked with almost unparalleled 
energy. Much stress was laid on the importance of the 
teacher being so interested in his work that he was held in 
the highest esteem by even those who had been indifferent 
to educational advantages. Securing such a hold on the ~ 
community, it was then an easy matter to get the children 
into school. 
The County Institue unanimously promised me that each 
one of them would do his best this year to enroll every child 
of school age in his district. The result of our County In- © 
stitute will be expressed in a decided improvement in school 
interest in our county. My assistants were three of our live- 
liest and most efficient teachers. They did their work well. 
No county has purer, better men than Profs. Stover, Hayes,

PERRY COUNTY. 
The Teachers’ Institute for Perry County closed Satur- 
day, June 30, 1906. I might say in general that it was ‘the 
most successful institute ever held in Perry County. The
-P-A-G-E-402
—383— 
attendance was better and the interest greater. There was 
. also greater interest manifested by the people-of Linden and 
from different parts of the county, many visitors being in 
evidence during the entire week. The work was conducted 
by Prof. H. C. Neville on the part of the state, and Prof. 
A. W. Daniel on the part of the county. These gentlemen 
handled the work admirably. Prof. Daniel being a native of 
Perry County and coming up through the public schools from 
the lowest to the very highest, knew every condition of our 
schools and teachers. Prof. Neville, with the tact that he is 
naturally endowed: with, at once realized our situation and 
immediately adapted himself to our conditions. At the 
close of the institute, an examination was held. This in 
every particular was thorough and practical, but in no wise 
technical. Thirty-four out of the 50-applicants were award-- 
ed certificates. 
Our teachers are going forth more determined than ever 
to succeed; directors more inclined toward better teachers 
and higher salaries; the people more enthused over longer 
terms, better houses, and better attendance.

POLK COUNTY. 
In this, my tenth annual report, it is a pleasure to be 
~ able to state that Polk County’s advancement in educational 
interest, means, facilities and results continues along solid 
pathways. Better beaten trails and roads leading to better 
kept buildings, in charge of better paid and better prepared 
teachers, with longer terms of service, are in evidence. 
In our larger schools, additional teachers ‘are being 
placed and rooms added to accommodate the children better. 
In our Annual Institute, ex-State Supt. S. G. Gilbreath, 
representing State Supt. Mynders, delivered an address 
which did much good. Prof. W. L. Lawrence did us a good 
week’s service as State Instructor, and at the close the 
teachers voted him their thanks by rising affirmatively as 
one man. . . 
Mrs. A. B. Nicholson, of Chattanooga, who has conducted 
a dozen Polk County Normals, helped greatly by presiding 
during the first session. Miss Elizabeth Taylor as Secretary, 
and H. M. McClary as Critic, did efficient service. 
Upon request of the County Superintendent, a commit-
-P-A-G-E-404
—385— 
tee was elected to audit his accounts as secretary and treas- 
urer of the Teachers’ Library Association. 
The association ordered bookcases and record books pur- 
chased for the three branch libraries, and amended its con- 
stitution so as to make the County Superintendent’s success- 
or in office also his successor as librarian. The association 
has 282 books listed and 106 members. After the teachers at 
close of the week’s work had, by resolution, without opposi- 
tion, endorsed the administration of the County Superintend- 
ent, asked the next County Court to re-elect him and to pay 
a reasonable salary, they did the very commendable thing 
in requesting by unanimous vote that each applicant, ex- 
cept those exempt by State law, be required to pass an ex- 
amination in 1907. Led by the County Court Chairman, 
G. C. Parks, and Esquires J. H. Williamson.and J. H. Rymer, 
a resolution favoring a paid directorate passed unanimously 
Friday afternoon. 
We are grateful to Supt. Mynders for so much aid ex- 
tended to Polk County in the past.

PUTNAM COUNTY. 
The 1906 Putnam County Teachers’ Annual Institute 
was held in the City Public School building, in Cookeville, 
and is conceded to have been one of the most interesting,
-P-A-G-E-406
—387— 
successful, and best attended institutes ever held in this 
county.’ The institute work consisted of a review of the 
public school curriculum, lectures by members of the faculty 
of instructors, regular work in the theory and practice of 
teaching, and drills and discussions as to the best methods 
of study,.teaching, and school government, and examina- 
tions. All of the teachers manifested the greatest: interest 
in the institute and seemed determined to secure the great- 
est benefit possible from it. As a result of the four State 
Institutes which have been held in Cookeville a large number 
of the teachers of this county hold State certificates, either 
Secondary or Primary. 
The April term of the County Court levied an additional 
10. cents school tax, making our school tax 40 cents, the 
terms this year will therefore be longer than ever before. 
The people of Putnam County are enthusiastically in 
favor of a compulsory attendance law, and have been for 
several years, and it is hoped by the people generally that. 
the next General Assembly will reflect the sentiments of the 
people of the State by enacting such a law, thereby enabling 
all children to secure the benefits of our schools. 
We hold semi-monthly teachers’ institutes and educa- 
tional rallies at different points throughout the county, while 
the schools are in session. These meetings have been a 
wonderful stimulus to the educational interests of the coun- 
ty. Nevér before in the history of Putnam County was 
there so much interest manifested by the people in public 
education as at present. They desire better schools and 
are deeply ,interested in the education of their children. 
The teaching corps of this county is better qualified and 
doing better work than ever before. We have endeavored 
for several years to thoroughly grade the schools of the 
county and the teachers are adhering as nearly as practica- 
ble to the grade schedule and course of study. . 
The Teachers’ County Reading Course is doing much
-P-A-G-E-407
—388— 
good, every teacher in this county reads one or more educa- 
tional] journals and all are studying the prescribed course of 
works in teaching and are thoroughly interested in their 
work. 
I am exerting every possible effort to increase the effi- 
ciency of the public schools of the county by eliminating 
the incompetent and indifferent teachers. A considerable 
number of applicants for teachers’ certificates failed to 
make the required grade in my recent examination. I re- 
fused to raise the grade of a single applicant who failed 
and shall persist in this course so long as I am superin- 
tendent. A number of young teachers who have failed 
during my four years incumbency have later attended 
schoo! and afterwards made good grades. I believe that the 
examinations should be made more difficult each year in 
order that all teachers will be students and none will be 
content with the mere qualification necessary to obtain a 
primary certificate in an ordinary examination. 
I. gratuitously furnish all of the teachers of the county 
with monthly report blanks for their schools, and urge them 
to promptly furnish parents with a complete record of the 
progress, standing, attendance, and deportment of their 
children, thereby enabling the parents to keep informed as 
to the educational progress and deportment of their chil- 
dren. 
The colored teachers had an interesting and successful 
institute, with seventeen teachers in attendance. Their 
institute was conducted at the same time as the institute 
for white teachers, but in a different building.. Their in- 
structors did very creditable work; fourteen received cer- 
tificates. 
The future for education in Putnam County is full of 
hope.

ERNEST H. Boyn, 
County Superintendent. 
RHEA COUNTY. 
There is a falling off of 30 in the scholastic population, 
and of 15 in the number of pupils enrolled in school, but 
notwithstanding this we have an increase of 96 in the aver- 
age daily attendance. This increase is very gratifying, as 
special efforts were put forth both by the teachers and schoo} 
officers to secure a better daily attendance. This was urged 
in the school rallies and parents’ meetings held throughout 
the county. However gratifying this increase may be, we 
are convinced that not much progress can be made along this 
line until some form of compulsory attendance is obtained. 
This report also shows an increase in the school term of 32 
days, making 122 days. The average salary has increased 
$3.15, making $40.10, and the tuition reduced from 70 
cents per pupil to 67 cents. During the past two years the 
County Court has increased the school tax 50 per cent. and 
last January granted a 10 cents additional levy for a county 
high school. This school has been located at Dayton—the
-P-A-G-E-410
—391— 
county seat—and has brilliant prospects for success... The 
enrollment has increased in most of the branches—for in- 
stance, we find 490 more in arithmetic, 44 more in geology, 
_ 27 more in algebra, 55 more in agriculture, 200 more in 
grammar, 333 in reading, 82 in United States History and : 
461 in writing, than last year. In some other branches we 
find a slight falling off. 
The schools are now better organized than they have 
been in some time. The new course of study put into opera- 
tion last year has been a great benefit and the schools are 
now very well graded. The schools begin and end the same 
day as nearly as possible, thus giving the children the same 
advantages. Much of this progress has been due to the effi- 
cient management of our school boards. We find that a few 
men handle the schools much better than a large number, 
and our present boards are placing the school funds in splen- 
did condition. 
Our Teachers’ Association is 5 organized into a primary 
and secondary reading circle; monthly meetings are held 
and for the seven months’ school term practically every 
teacher -was present. 
Our county library is growing rapidly, some 50 books on 
teaching and history being recently added. September and 
October were given by teachers to entertainment in the in- - 
terests of libraries and about $175.00 were raised. 
. Uniform mid-term and monthly examinations are con- 
ducted through the County Superintendent’s office and 
promotions made. Monthly reports and grade cards are 
furnished the schools by the directors.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
The school conditions in Scott County are far from 
ideal, but I am glad to be able to report that there has never 
been such an educational sentiment in the county as now 
exists, nor the school system in a more healthy, growing 
condition. . 
The annual report from this county will show the 
average term for the year just closed to be about 140 days, 
‘with a fair increase in salary of the teacher. A county high
-P-A-G-E-414
—395— 
school has been created and will be in session by Oct. 1, and 
the County Court has made appropriations to two of the . 
best schools of the county, centrally located, in order to 
enable them to carry on high school work. 
I find that the Court is more easily approached on edu- 
cational matters than ever before, and the citizens generally 
are more appreciative of the schools and the work they are 
attempting to do. 
Owing to the commercial development of the. county a 
large per cent of the teaching corps changes each year, 
which has a bad effect on the school system, but this will 
probably be remedied in the near future by the increase in 
the term and the salary of the teacher. 
There are at least two things that I believe the next 
Legislature should give attention to. They are: Laws look- 
ing to compulsory attendance and to rid the schools of the 
old director system.

Teachers too inexperienced. Salaries too small as a- 
general thing. Terms too short to fulfill provision in law 
that all schools shall continue not less than five months. 
None of our schools continued longer than five months, and 
not more than four continued so long. Hope some arrange- 
ments may be made to lengthen the schools of so small and 
dependent: counties. County high school badly needed. 
Attendance not so good as should be. Compulsion needed 
in some form. Any provisions in law to lengthen terms, 
increase salary and encourage regular and enforcing attend- 
ance will be a great help and highly appreciated by Sequat- 
chie County. Arbor Day is not used as ordered by the 
provision of law. Hardly noticed at all. Our school furni- 
ture and supplies were and are very deficient, and on 
account of means cannot at preseyt be supplied to meet 
proper demands and practical use even. 
Hope for a more prosperous year for both county and, 
State.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
A sentiment in favor of education is steadily growing in 
our county. The people are awakening slowly to the great 
need of a more enlightened citizenship. The educational
-P-A-G-E-418
—399— 
rally held at Sevierville last year by Superintendent Myn- 
ders and Prof. Claxton aroused much interest in the public 
school work. The people’s eyes were opened to some. extent 
to the little stress that is placed on the most important and 
vital things of individual and national life, but our schools 
cannot nearly approach the standard that should be until 
there is a law in our State to compel parents to give their 
children educational advantages. Salaries and efficiency 
in teaching are increasing, not fast, but some ‘each year. 
Our teachers’ institutes and educational rallies held in 
the various parts of the county this year were largely 
attended, and the whole people seemed to take greater 
interest in the upbuilding of school work than was ever 
before shown. z a Mn, 
The teachers belonging to our Librar. sSochatl Ai nave? hy 
read almost twice as many books thi dy’ 
last. They are showing themselves iaore efficient in} 
methods, and their scholarship has improvely J the past’ 
year, as most of them are students “i ‘in ;some ers) Vary 
spring term. 
Our annual institute met at Sevier Aik De, July 16, afd ) 
closed July 25. Prof. J. W. Trotter, who’ yas sent’ to (8 by 
the State, did very efficient and earnest work. ‘Heis up with 
the times in his profession, and always gives teachers 
something of worth. Prof. E. F. Goddard and Prof. C. M. 
Thompson were very efficient and interesting in, the 
branches assigned them. Supt. 8. G. Gilbreath, of Chatta- 
nooga, was with us on Wednesday of the first week of our 
institute as a representative of the State Superinténdent. 
He knows the needs of rural schools, and his addresses 
struck to the point. We hope the State Superintendent 
will send him to us again, as he can do the public school 
cause here much good.

SHELBY COUNTY. 
Since June 30, 1905, we have instituted a system of high 
schools in Shelby County, in which schools Latin, English, 
History and college entrance work in English have been 
added to the curriculum of thé secondary schools. The 
twelve teachers employed as high school teachers represent 
such institutions as Peabody College, Vanderbilt; Knox- 
ville, Wellesley, University. of Chicago, . Hollins’ Institute 
and the Sophie Newcomb College. The salaries paid these 
teachers at present is $75 per month. Our high school fund 
is secured by a two-cent levy on the hundred dollars. ° 
An effort is being made to combine the schools of each 
district into one large central high school, and to establish 
the Wagonette system. This plan is not yet in practice; 
however, three of the smaller schools have been discontinued 
this year. / 
A county traveling library has been established, con- 
sisting of 800 volumes, ten volumes to a box, which box 
remains at.a school one month, and is then forwarded to 
the next school. : 
Besides our regular reading circle work, the teachers of 
Shelby County have taken a course in English by cor- 
respondence which has proven of great benefit to them in 
their daily work. 
‘Five new school buildings have been erected, ranging
-P-A-G-E-421
—=402— 
in value from one to six thousand dollars. In five instances 
an additional room has been built to furnish the necessary 
accommodation for the increase in attendance. 
In three districts the salaries of teachers have been 
increased, the average now being a little over $40. The 
average school term in the county is eight and. one-half 
months.

SMITH COUNTY. 
We certainly appreciated having a State institute this 
year. It was an entire success. A report of same will be 
found under the heading of “State Institutes.” We want to 
thank Capt. Mynders, our most worthy State Superin- 
tendent, tiBcating it at Carthage, also for sending us 
such a strong faculty. Capt. C. S. Douglass, the able con- 
ductor, and Profs. P. A. Lyon, L. §. Gillentine and C. B. 
Ijams, the capable instructors, made themselves very 
agreeable, and won the love and praise of all the teachers. 
' They instilled in our teachers a greater love for the work, 
also higher aspirations. ; 
I am making special efforts to have our schools better 
graded; have issued a course of study or grading list in 
pamphlet form, and placed it in the hands of our teachers 
and directors. I have given good supplementary readers 
suited to each grade, as I think more supplementary is one 
of the greatest needs of the rural schools. The teachers —
-P-A-G-E-423
—404— . 
seem to appreciate my efforts, and are doing all they can 
to help me. 
The Smith County Teachers’ Association met and re- 
organized. It adopted the reading course suggested by the 
committee for the “State Teachers’ Reading Circle.” . This 
association, which meets monthly, has done a great deal in 
preparing our teachers for better work, and the efforts are 
_being greatly felt in our schools. J. R. Curtis, - 
County Superintendent. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
In addition to my annual statistical report, I will say 
we are moving very satisfactorily along educational lines. 
Better results could, I think, be brought about were a few 
changes made in our school law. 
During the past year many of our school-houses were 
repaired and much needed furniture added. As usual, sev- 
eral of our best teachers have “stepped down” to other pro- 
fessions, trades, etc.,.and their places will. lejpecupied by 
raw recruits. 
As to our annual institute, it was s not the best we have 
had, but I am pleased to say it was well attended, and was 
-a most successful, satisfactory normal. Prof. E. M. Wright, 
our principal instructor, gave universal satisfaction. Mrs. 
Ellen Pope did excellent work. Efficient aid was also given 
by Profs. Jones, Sherfey, Pope, Shipley, Erwin, and Miller, 
also Misses Maude Norvill and Ollie V. Cox. Drs. Wallace 
and Ramsey and Prof. DeArmond favored us with most 
entertaining and instrtctive addresses. As far as possible 
we avoided all unfamiliar technicalities and theoretical gen- 
- eralizations, and dealt with the plain matter-of-fact prob-
-P-A-G-E-424
—405— 
lems of the school—management, method, and discipline. 
We are laboring to make better teachers, knowing that the 
true teacher can mould and shape public sentiment, causing 
it to grow broader and broader until we shall have a school 
for every child and every child in school.

SUMNER COUNTY. 
Our County Institute, which was held at Gallatin from 
June 4 to 11, was one of the best in the history of the 
county. We had an attendance of 123 teachers, most of 
whom were teachers of some experience. The work was 
conducted by home talent. Our institute was quite a suc- 
cess, and teachers’ meetings are expected all over the county 
during this year. I am trying to awaken greater interest 
among our teachers, directors, and patrons in behalf of our 
public schools. : 
Every teacher in this county reads one or more educa- 
tional journals. They attend the county institute and take 
part in the work. Several of our teachers also attend sum- 
mer schools. I am encouraging this, and I find that the 
work is much better than it has been in the past,

UNION COUNTY. 
The Union County Teachers’ Institute was held at May- 
nardville, beginning July 16 and closing July 27. The insti- 
tute was conducted by Prof. C. C. Justus, of Chattanooga, 
whom you sent us, together with the leading teachers of our 
county. 
In view of better qualifying our teaching force, lessons 
were assigned by the instructors and regular class work 
was carried through the first week of the institute. Both 
teachers and citizens agree that our institute, under the 
new method, was the most successful ever before held in 
Union County. 
While we feel proud of the advancement of our teaching 
force as a whole, we are especially proud of the services of 
our leading teachers, who seem so earnest in their work 
and so desirous of making teaching their profession. 
Realizing the importance of an awakening of the educa- 
tional interest of our county, we have organized a Union 
County Teachers’ Association, through which we hope to
-P-A-G-E-428
—409— 
accomplish a great deal, viz.: better qualified teachers, bet- 
ter salaries, better and more comfortable school-houses, 
better furnished houses, as to seats, etc., and, in general, 
to raise the standard of education in our county. 
I believe before the end of the fiscal year 1907 Union 
County will have a county high school. 
From observation and experience I conclude that we 
not only need the above mentioned things, but since the 
county is the least unit of taxation, and since every citizen 
should be an equal beneficiary with every other, every 
school district should be co-extensive with the county, thus 
giving each and every child in the county the same number 
of days schooling. We need a County Board of Education © 
‘rather than district directors in order that selfish motives 
may be eliminated from the employment of teachers. Now- 
adays few men will do public service gratuitously, therefore 
if we had some of our laws changed or modified, a County 
Board of Education could be paid for their services, thereby 
insuring acceptable service. 
I mention these things as my views rather than sug- 
gestions. We feel very grateful to you for the interest 
you have taken in the advancement of the educational in- 
terests of our county.

WARREN COUNTY. 
I have returned from the Summer School of the South, 
Knoxville, to make my reports for you. I held an insti- 
tute for the examination of teachers for Warren County, 
Tenn., this fall (1906). I thank you very much for send- 
ing me Mr. M. M. Summar to help me. I think that we 
had the best institute that we have had for several years. 
We had very fine attendance on the part of the teachers, 
and also on the part of the public. There is a marked 
interest above last year. I have secured a better teaching 
force where needed. 
We have had some trouble with the directors in some 
of the districts to get them to employ enough teachers for a 
few of the schools (secondary schools generally). We are 
overcoming this trouble. We have a good body of young 
teachers in our school this fall. The salary of the teachers 
has been raised a fraction. Now we are expecting a good 
educational rally on Aug. 29 at McMinnville, Tenn. I want 
you to be with us then.

WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my second annual report of the pub- 
lic schools of Washington County. We have made some 
improvement along important lines, yet much remains to 
be done. The school term is fifteen days longer than last 
year. The enrollment has been increased about 500, and 
the daily attendance is much better than it was during the 
previous year. The average salary of teachers has been 
raised $1.50 per month, and I believe I see a greater 
interest manifested on the part of the people in general 
than has been shown for many years. 
Our standard of qualification of teachers is being grad- 
ually raised, and already good results have followed. How- 
ever, on account of short terms and low salaries, we find 
it very difficult to secure and hold teachers of extraordinary 
ability in our public schools. These things will, perhaps, 
be overcome, but it takes time, energy and money. 
The County Court has done well by our public schools.. 
The common school tax is now 25 cents on the hundred 
dollars, with an additional 10 cents on the hundred dollars 
for high school purposes. 
We are hard at work and success is crowning our efforts. 
We face the future with brave hearts and strong determina- 
tion. I believe the day is not far distant when the public 
schools of Washington County will take their proper places 
and rank among the best in the State of Tennessee.

The Washington County Teachers’ Institute met in the 
auditorium of the High School building Monday, July 9, 
and continued two weeks. This, I believe, was one of the 
greatest educational meetings in the history. of Washington. 
One hundred and fifty-two teachers were enrolled, and the — 
attendance was good indeed. Through the kindness» of a 
Superintendent Mynders, Mrs. Gennie Mynders,. of .Knox- 
ville, Tenn., was with us one week, and the splendid work 
which she did was appreciated by every teacher in Washing- 
ton County. By her pleasant manner, her great. interest 
and her efficient work, Mrs. Mynders won the respect and: 
esteem of all our people, and she will ever find a most 
hearty welcome in the old county of Washington and the 
good town of Jonesboro. 
On Tuesday of the second week of our institute, our 
“Flag Raising” exercises were conducted in the High 
School auditorium. This was, indeed, a great educational; 
and patriotic day for Jonesboro. Among the many promi- 
. nent educators and distinguished speakers were Hon. E. J. 
Baxter, President of the Board of Education, Jonesboro, 
Tenn.; Prof. John T. Henderson, President Southwestern 
Virginia Institute, Bristol, Va.; Dr. M. D. Jeffries, Presi- 
dent Carson and Newman College, Jefferson City, Tenn., 
and Rev. C. B. Waller, of Chattanooga, Tenn. Splendid 
music was furnished and the entire programme was well. 
rendered. This closed our teachers’ institute, and I feel that 
it was the beginning of a great educational revival in 
Washington County. I believe we are standing on the 
very threshold of a great educational awakening. I believe 
I see. not far distant a great, strong spirit for better 
schools, which cannot be suppressed, and we are doing what 
we can to hasten the coming of a greater, better, brighter 
day for the public schools of our country.

WAYNE COUNTY. 
One drawback to the institute work is the examination 
in August. Some teachers will fail to attend and say 
the .State Superintendent “sets the date for fellows in 
August.” All examinations should -be by the State, and 
there should be a law binding all teachers to attend insti- 
tutes and take an active part in institute work. Our best 
teachers attend the institutes. The teacher needing the in- 
structions, modes of teaching and best methods of giving 
instructions in primary school work, is absent from the 
‘institute, but is always on hand for the August examina- 
tion. 
But sometimes I am asked this question, ““Do you expect 
me to attend the school (some school) institute, all teachers. 
meetings and teach three months at $30 per month, which is 
$90?” The best students in many schools never complete 
common fractions. Some schools get through long division 
and the teacher feels that he is qualified to successfully 
master the situation without spending all he can or does 
make with little prospects of improvement or advancement 
in salary. To the boy or girl who has mastered the books

our fine institutes are failures—just theorizing on how to 
teach, but I am glad to say Prof. Joe Sims, Prof. Jim Strick- 
lin and Prof. M. M. Whitworth evaded the old way and 
eame down to the simple method of forming classes in the 
institute and doing actual school work, and the forty-five 
teachers present enjoyed the work and derived lasting 
benefit from it, and my opinion is that I could find out more 
about the teacher’s ability to teach by watching them from 
day to day than by a long tedious examination, for there 
are some that cannot impart their knowledge ‘to others— 
“can’t tell what they-know.” Our instructors this year were 
all native of this county, Wayne. We missed it in just 
one thing—it was not long enough. Four weeks would 
have brought. out more teachers and better work from the 
instructors on account of better classes. Our school tax 
should be-doubled. The State should examine the teachers.

I thank you most earnestly for aid in conducting my 
county institute. I furnish a statistical report on another 
page of this sheet. 
Notwithstanding thirty-five of my teachers attended 
the Lawrenceburg State Institute, the attendance during my 
county institute was large and regular. Deep interest was
-P-A-G-E-440
—491— 
manifested by instructors and teachers, and I feel quite sure 
that much and lasting good will result. 
I conducted a colored institute and was assisted by 
a faculty of competent colored teachers. I gave the colored 
teachers the examination questions I gave the white teach- 
ers. I enclose statistical report of colored institute. 
My teachers, white and colored, have regular monthly 
meetings, and a good course of study is followed under my 
supervision. A number of my teachers attend the summer 
schools at Nashville and Knoxville, the State Teachers’ 
Association and the State Public School Officers’ Associa- 
tion. 
-Year by year we have fewer schools, larger schools, 
longer terms, better salaries, and, we are glad to say, 
more efficient teaching. We commend most emphatically 
your very laborious and effective work in the interest of the 
public schools of our State. :

  REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
  
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. . 
          
ithe Honorable Superintendent of Public Instruction: vo Ten: 
enessee. 
  -iDwak Sie: I take great pleasure in submitting 1 my annual:te 
 pott of the organization and work of the University of ‘Tennessee - 
for the session of 1905-1906. 
“The University of Tennessee can justly. claim to: be in every sense 
“the university of the State and of all the people of the State, this 
“@aim being justified both by history and by present actual fasts. 
‘ Blount, College, from which the present university is descended i in 
direct line, was founded in 1794, and was the first undenomina- 
ional college to be established west of the Alleghany Mountains. 
~The charter of Blount College provided that the Board of Trustees 
thereof “shall take effectual care that students of all denominations 
may and shall be admitted to the equal advantages of a liberal edu- 
_eation, and to the emoluments and honors of the college, and that 
they: shall receive a like fair, generous, and equal treatment during . 
their residence therein.” This clearly indicates that the college to 
“Be established was to be a public institution—a college for all the 
“people. On October 26, 180%, the Legislature of Tennessee passed 
“ah Act to establish a college in Hast Tennessee, the preamble of 
~ ¥hich is as follows: 
“+ Whereas it is provided by an Act of the Congress of the United 
States, entitled ‘An Act to authorize the State of Tennessee to issue 
étants to certain lands therein described, and to settle the claims to 
the: vacant and unappropriated lands within the same,’ passed the 
eighteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and six, that 
théte ‘shall: be one hundred thousand acres of land laid off on the 
south side of Holston and French Broad, and west side of Big 
   
-P-A-G-E-451
—430— 
Pigeon Rivers, to which the Indian claim had been extinguished ; 
and that the proceeds of the sales of the said one hundred thousand . 
acres of land shall be appropriated in such way by the Legislature 
of this State that the profits thereof should be applied to the sup- 
port-of two colleges in this State, the one in Hast and the other 
in West Tennessee, to be established by the Legislature of this 
State; and whereas it is expedient that this General Assembly 
should establish a college in East Tennessee, capable of receiving 
that part of said donation, designed by said Act to be given to the 
college to be established in East Tennessee aforesaid. Therefore, 
ete.” The charter under which the University of Tennessee is now 
operating is the charter of 1807, from which quotation has been 
made. The public character of the institution is thus again made 
clear. In a supplementary Act to the one just quoted, passed on 
December 8, 180%, the Legislature decrees: “And whereas the trus- 
tees of Blount College ‘have agreed . . . that, provided this 
General Assembly should establish the college for East Tennessee’ 
within two miles of Knoxville, the funds of Blount College might 
be incorporated with the funds of the college so to be established ; 
- + .- and whereas this General Assembly has established East 
Tennessee College within two miles of Knoxville, whereby said 
trustees of Blount College are bound to incorporate the funds of 
Blount College with the funds of East Tennessee College. . There- 
fore, etc.” The public college established by the Legislature of 
. the territory south of the River Ohio thus became merged with the 
public college established by the General Assembly of the State of 
Tennessee, to the end of securing one strong institution fitted te 
become in time the public university of a great State. 
Another and momentous action of the Géneral Assembly was that 
taken on January 16, 1869, when it appropriated to the university 
the proceeds of the sale of agricultural.scrip appropriated by Con- 
gress for the establishment of an institution of learning devoted 
to agriculture and, the mechanic arts. This indication of the public 
character of the university was in strict accord with other acts 
passed before it in the many years of the university’s useful career. 
The State, however, was not for many years in a condition to sup- 
plement the Congressional gifts referred to above by such appropri-
-P-A-G-E-452
—431— 
ations from its own treasury as were needed to make the university. 
a virile leader of public education in the State. Conditions have 
changed, however, and the last two Legislatures have made small 
appropriations for greatly needed additions to the university plant. 
With the growth of the understanding both of the need of a great 
State university by our State and of the conscientious efforts of 
the governing body of the University of Tennessee to supply the 
need as effectively as its méans will allow, we trust that the General 
Assembly will provide such generous support as will allow the op- 
eration of a State university worthy of the great State of Tennessee. 
The year 1907 will mark the completion of the first century of the 
university under its present charter. Will it not be peculiarly fit- 
ting for the Legislature of 1907 to take as epoch-marking a step as 
was taken by the Legislature of 1807, when it established the uni- 
versity, and by suitable appropriations provide for a new birth of 
this child of the State, which has so long and so nobly striven with 
the great handicap of poverty to be worthy of the parentage from’ 
which it sprung? 
The University of Tennessee has been organized on broad lines 
adapted to modern needs and ideals. As now constituted, it com- 
prises the following departments: 
1. The Graduate Department. 
2. The College of Liberal Arts. 
8. The College of Engineering. 
4. The College of Agriculture. : 
5. The Industrial Department (at Knoxville College) for Col- 
ored Youth. 
6. The School of Pharmacy. 
% The Law Department. * 
8. The Medical Department. 
9. The Dental Department. 
.The Medical and Dental Departments are located at Nashville. 
The other departments are located at Knoxville. The Graduate 
Department, the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Pharmacy, 
the Industrial Department, and the Dental Department are open t to 
women.
-P-A-G-E-453
—432— 
_ The aim of the university is to truly occupy its place as the head 
of the public-school system of the State. Its plans and courses of 
study will therefore always be made with this aim constantly in 
mind. It will not make the mistake of establishing standards for 
admission that will exclude any faithful student of the public-school 
- system as it is, yet it will constantly strive to assist the movement 
for better public schools, and will itself quickly respond to the 
improvement by readjusting its standards from time to time. In 
the College of Liberal Arts the grade of admission is that of the 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern 
States, of which the university is a member. This is a standard 
that can be readily reached by the better class of public high schools. 
It is hoped that the present splendid movement for the establish- 
ment of county high schools will soon add a large number to the 
list of schools in Tennessee that are able to reach the Association 
standard. The College of Liberal Arts provides two principal 
courses of instruction leading to baccalaureate degrees—the Liter- 
ary Course and the Scientific Course. In the Literary Course either 
Latin or Greek is required throughout the four years. In the Sci- 
entific Course many suitable combinations of scientific and literary 
subjects may be made, each one of which will give a full and vigorous 
training. In both courses there is opportunity for election of stud- 
ies in accordance with the best current practice. The methods of 
instruction are modern, both in the languages and other literary 
subjects and in the physical and natural sciences. Well-developed 
laboratory courses are given in physics, chemistry, botany, zodlogy, 
psychology, home economics, drawing and art, etc. It is believed 
that the preparation of high-grade teachers is one of the proper 
functions of a State university, and with this end in view instruc- 
tion is given in the history of education, theory and practice of 
teaching, educational psychology, home economics, free-hand draw- 
ing, the principles of agriculture, and other subjects especially 
adapted to the needs of students looking forward to the career of 
the teacher. All the advantages of the College of Liberal Arts are 
opened to properly. prepared and earnest young women, who find 
here most congenial surroundings and favorable conditions for the 
higher education. The Barbara Blount Hall affords them an ad-
-P-A-G-E-454
—433— 
mirable home under refined conditions and influences. The young 
women are not simply tolerated, but their interests are carefully 
looked out for, under the conviction that the State owes.a duty to its 
women in the provision of equal opportunity for Preparation ‘for 
the most effective citizenship. 
The College of Engineering is making steady advance along the _ 
most approved lines in perfecting its courses in mechanical, electri- 
cal, civil, mining, and'chemical engineering. During the past sum- 
mer there has been erected a large and well-planned addition ‘to the 
engineering building, which makes available a total floor space three 
times as great as was afforded by the original building. In this 
new building, which was erected by means of an appropriation by 
the General Assembly of 1905, there is ample provision for the pres- 
ent needs of the departments of mechanical, electrical, and civil 
engineering, including large class rooms, drawing-rooms, workshops, 
and laboratories for steam and other heat engines, hydraulics, 
strength of materials, electrical testing, dynamo machinery, fuel 
and oil analysis, etc. A considerable amount of new equipment 
has recently been added to these departments by purchase, by dona- 
tion from manufacturers and others, and by the operation of our 
own workshops. We are now in a position to plan out the arrange- 
ment of our laboratories on a scale and in a manner appropriate to 
the technical school of a great State. The location of the univer- 
sity is peculiarly adapted to the development of a great technical 
school. It is our earnest desire and it, will be our effort to make 
this engineering college rank among the most effective in the 
country. 
The College of Agriculture has made good advance during the 
past year in the addition of new members to its faculty; in a con- 
siderable addition to its equipment, both on the farms and in the 
laboratories; and in the careful working out of improvements in its 
courses of study. It is our desire by this.college and its associated 
agricultural experiment station to serve the highest interests of the 
farming community, constituting the large majority of the citizens 
of the State. No young man can afford at the present time to take 
up the profession of agriculture without a study of the sciences un-
-P-A-G-E-455
—434— 
derlying his calling and of the best practice in farming operations 
generally. The courses are adapted to the actual present condi- 
tions in the State, both as to the educational requirements for ad- 
mission and the character of studies pursued while in attendance. 
Three courses are offered. One extends over four years and leads to 
graduation with the degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture; 
one extends over two years, and is very practical in its character; 
the third is a series of short winter courses, each lasting two weeks, 
and the whole series being completed within three months. These 
latter courses are especially suited to the needs of farmers who can 
only be absent from the farm at that time. They deal with all the 
usual agricultural subjects—such as farm crops, cereal judging, an- 
imal husbandry, stock judging, poultry raising, dairying, horticul- 
ture, veterinary science, agricultural chemistry (including fertili- 
zers), farm mechanics, bee culture, domestic science, ete. We are 
trying to make these short courses attractive to the farmer him- 
self, as well as to his sons, his daughters, and his wife. Special 
attention will be given to the subjects of interest to the women on 
the farm, young and old. No charge is made for these short 
courses, 
In these days of improved methods and machinery and active 
competition no young man can afford to enter upon the life of a 
farmer without proper study of the principles of his profession and 
the sciences underlying it, Every facility is afforded at the uni- 
versity for the study of these subjects. Besides the fine scientific 
laboratories and workshops, there are two beautiful experiment 
farms, one of one hundred and forty-five acres and one of ninety 
acres, to both of which students have free access and in the con- 
duct of which they have an opportunity to take part, under the 
guidance of skilled instructors. The expenses of the agricultural 
courses are as small as they can be made. Some students support 
themselves partly by their own labor while at college. Others bor- 
row from loan funds which have been given to the college to be 
used for this purpose. The East Tennessee Farmers’ Convention 
voted at its last meeting to use the entire fund in its treasury as a 
Joan fund to assist young farmers to attend the short courses in 
agriculture. No more profitable use can be made of the funds of
-P-A-G-E-456
—435— 
any agricultural society. At the recent State Fair, at Nashville, 
the prize winners in the stock judging and other contests were young 
men who had attended the short courses of the university. There 
is no question of the great and pernianent value to the farmer, young 
or old, of attendance on these short agricultural courses. 
The statutes of the State placing the agricultural and mechan- 
ical fund at the University of Tennessee direct “that no citizen 
of the State otherwise qualified shall be excluded from the privi- 
leges of the university by reason of his race or color, but the accom- 
modations for persons of color shall be separate from the whites.” 
In order to mect these requirements the trustees of the university 
have established the Industrial Department for Colored. Youth, 
which by special contract is operated at Knoxville College, an ex- 
cellent institution, where the student of the Industrial Depart- 
ment has all the advantages of a good literary institution in addi- 
tion to the special training in handicraft, in agriculture, and in 
military tactics for the young men, and domestic science, launder- 
ing, sewing, and dressmaking for the young women. Appointments 
of colored students to the Industrial Department are made by mem- 
bers of the Legislature as in the case of white students. ‘The char- 
acter of the instruction given is such as to prepare the colored youth 
for self-respecting and useful citizenship. 
The Graduate Department provides advanced courses of study 
for graduates of our own or other colleges in most of the, subjects 
taught in the university, these courses leading to the Master’s 
Degree and to the professional degrees of civil, electrical, mechan- 
ical, mining, and chemical engineer. : 
The School of Pharmacy gives excellent training for all branches : 
of pharmacy. The graduate is assured a thorough qualification for 
the prescription table and as the chemist of the medical profession. 
The student has full advantage of the laboratories of chemistry, zo- 
ology, and botany, as well as of the pharmaceutical laboratory 
proper, 
A two-years’ course in law has been conducted for a number. of 
years with marked success. This department numbers among its 
graduates many of the foremost lawyers of this and other States.
-P-A-G-E-457
—436— © 
Law students may take academic studies without additional charge. 
The fees for the law course are $70 per session of eight and a half 
months. No graduate of the Law Department has ever failed to 
pass the State examination. A graduate course in law is offered 
to our own graduates and those of other law schools of equal grade. 
This course leads to the degree of Master of Laws. 
The Medical Department of the university is located at Nash- 
ville. It occupies a commodious building especially erected for 
the purpose of medieal teaching and equipped with lecture rooms, 
laboratories, dissecting rooms, etc. The building has recently been 
remodeled and rebuilt and now represents the most approved 
method of construction of such a plant. The hospital advantages 
are excellent. Expenses are quite lew. The Dental Department 
is also located in Nashville. It occupies one of the most modern 
dental college buildings in the country. A complete new equipment 
of the most approved character has been installed during the past 
year, and the faculty has been greatly strengthened and enlarged. 
Every facility is provided for a thorough course in all branches of 
dentistry.. The college is a member of the National Association of 
Dental Faculties, and its fees are those established by that body. 
The most epoch-marking event in the history of the university 
during the past year was the construction of the addition to Esta- 
brook Hall, the engineering building already referred to. The fact 
that this is the first building erected on the university campus by 
money voted to the institution by the General Assembly made the 
fact of its erection a significant one. The corner stone of the build- 
ing was laid with appropriate ceremonies on University Day, Mon- 
day, April 15, 1906. The principal address of the day was deliv- 
ered by Dr. Alexander C. Humphrey, president of the Stevens In- 
stitute of Technology, at Hoboken, N. J. The Governor of the 
State had expected to make an address and lay the corner stone, 
but on account of urgent affairs of State he could not attend, but 
delegated the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to repre- 
sent him on this occasion. The corner stone was thus laid by Su- 
perintendent Seymour A. Mynders. The building was substan- 
tially completed before the opening of the following session. It. 
adds greatly to the equipment of the university.

“The'rate of tuition in the academic colleges is low, and living 
expenses are moderate. There are two hundred and seventy-five 
free scholarships, to which appointments are made by the members 
of the Legislature, three to each Representative and two to each 
Senator. The students’ loan funds provide means by which a‘ sti- 
dent may borrow money to pay his expenses, repaying the debt 
after graduation. There are also opportunities for a student to 
earn money by his own labor. In every way the university desires 
to honor and assist the young man or young woman that is trying 
under difficulties to obtain an education.” . 
The Summer School of the South held its fifth session at the 
university during the months of June and July, maintaining its 
high grade of work and enrolling its usual large number of teachers
-P-A-G-E-459
—438— 
and other students in attendance. The total enrollment was one 
thousand eight hundred and eight. The quality of work done was 
even better than in previous years, and it is greatly to be hoped that 
it may be organized on a permanent basis, as the demand for a 
summer school of the high grade of this one is clearly indicated by 
its remarkable success. As heretofore, the school was under the 
management of Prof. P. P. Claxton, of the university. 
During the past year an arrangement has been in effect by which 
a part of the time of our professor of education, Professor Claxton, 
is regularly devoted to- the work of assisting in establishing and 
stimulating the development of county high schools. In this work 
he has had the strong codperation of State Superintendent Mynders. 
As a result of the agitation of these gentlemen, about eighteen 
county high schools have been established in the State during the 
past year, and a number of other counties are preparing to fall into 
line at an early date. This is a very important work for the edu- 
cational interests of our State, the fruits of which will be soon seen 
in the improvement of the lower schools and in the larger number 
of students prepared for college. 
Since the writing of my last report a systematic educational cam- — 
paign has been carried out by the State Superintendent in codper- 
ation with Professor Claxton and President Ayres, of the Univer- 
sity of Tennessee, assisted by several members of the university 
faculty and a large number of persons interested in educational 
work. Rallies have been held in every county of the State, and 
in many counties two or more rallies have been held within this 
time. The interest has been most gratifying, the average attend- 
ance having been over one thousand, the attendance in several cases 
exceeding four thousand and reaching occasionally to six and seven 
thousand. The awakened interest of the people must bear fruit in 
better schools, taught by better teachers, for longer terms, to a 
larger number of children. No work of statesmanship of the pres- 
ent time is more important to our State than the work just de- 
scribed. 
Tt has been the object of the members of the agricultural faculty 
to assist in every possible way in the work of educating the farmers
-P-A-G-E-460
—~439— 
of the State to a higher standard of farming and a more intelli- 
gent pursuit of their calling. To this end they have codperated 
with the State Commissioner of Agriculture, Hon. W. W. ‘Ogilvie, 
in conducting great farmers’ institutes in the three grand divisions 
of the State. They have also attended many local institutes, and 
have given personal aid to a large number of farmers seeking advice ~ 
from time to time. They have also acted as judges and lecturers - 
at the State Fair at Nashville, and have made addresses before a 
number of woman’s clubs and other organizations in different parts 
of the State. This work is an indication of the policy of the uni- 
versity to serve the people in as many ways as practicable and in the 
greatest possible measure. The university of a great State cannot 
have a small ideal of its mission. It must be a source of helpful- 
ness and strength to all the activities of the State where expert and 
intelligent aid and guidance is demanded. To old and young alike 
it must be a lighthouse lighting up the dark places and guiding all 
to a safe harbor of prosperity, intelligence, and content. 
Very respectfully, . 
Brown AYRES, 
October 1, 1906. . President. 
REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE STATE. 
To the Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee: 
Your special committee appointed to report on “ the exact rela- 
tion existing between the University and the State” beg leave to 
report as follows: 
’ This relationship can be best shown by the following historical 
review of the principal legislative Acts and events by which it has 
been established and illustrated : 
wcrien Biounr COLLEGE CHARTERED, 1794, 
By an Act of the Territorial Legislature passed September 10, 
1794, the president and trustees of Blount College were created a
-P-A-G-E-461
—440— 
body politic and corporate, with appropriate powers for conducting 
the college, this Act providing that the trustees “ shall take effectual 
care that students of all denominations may and shall be admitted 
to the equal advantages of a liberal education.” By virtue of this 
provision of the Act, the college became, it has been said, “ the first 
strictly nondenominational college established under the jurisdic 
tion of the United States.” (Acts of 1794, Chapter 18; 1 Scott’s 
Revisal, 504.) - 
While the Governor and other territorial officers were among the 
trustees appointed, the college received no legislative endowment 
and was purely a private corporation for educational purposes. 
The college purchased from the founder of Knoxville for thirty 
dollars the entire town square on the east side of the present Gay 
street on which the First Baptist Church now stands (deed, James 
White to President and Trustees of Blount College, April 27, 1795; 
Reg. Off., Knox Co., Bk. C, Vol. 1, p. 250) ; and a two-story frame 
building was erected, by subscription, near the northwest corner of 
the square, in which for several years it carried on its educational 
work, being “dependent for its support solely upon the patronage 
of the public ” (Colonel Moses White’s “ Early History of the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee,” pp. 9-15). Whatever property it acquired, 
which was probably little, was entirely its own private property. 
ConeREssionaL Cession Act oF 1806. 
By an Act of Congress passed April 18, 1806, in settlement of a 
controversy as to the ownership of the vacant lands within the bor- 
ders of Tennessee, the United States ceded to Tennessee all its 
right and title to the lands lying north and east of a line running 
across the western part of the State near the present site of Colum- 
bia (commonly known as the Congressional Reservation line or the 
Elk River line), to take effect upon the release by Tennessee of all 
its claims to the lands south and west of this line. This cession 
Act, however, provided, as one of its “express conditions,” that 
Tennessee should appropriate a tract of one hundred thousand 
acres, to which the Indian title had been extinguished, within the 
limits reserved to the Cherokee Indians by North Carolina in 1783
-P-A-G-E-462
—441— 
(being the area containing some eight hundred thousand acres, 
lying south of the French Broad and Holston and between the Ten- 
nessee and Big Pigeon Rivers, commonly known as the district 
south of the French Broad and Holston), which hundred-thousand- 
acre tract should be sold by the Legislature at not less than two 
dollars an acre, and the proceeds invested in funds for the use of 
two colleges to be established by the Legislature, one in East and 
one in West (now Middle) Tennessee, with a like tract of one hun- 
dred thousand acres for the use of academies to be established in 
each county of the State, the intention of Congress thus being to 
provide from the sale of lands so appropriated a fund of $100,000 
for the use of each of the two colleges and a fund of $200,000 for 
the use of the academies. (1 Scott’s Rev., p. 936.) 
This cession Act was accepted by the Tennessee Legislature by 
an Act passed September 6, 1806. (Acts of 1806, Ch. 10; 1 Scott’s 
Rev., p. 936.) : 
As a matter of fact, however, a large part of the fertile land in 
this district in which the college and academy lands were to be set 
apart, although not hitherto subject to legal: entry, had been for 
many years settled by occupants, whose rights of preémption and 
occupancy had been referred to by North Carolina in its cession 
Act of 1789 and guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution of 1796 
(Art. 1, Sec. 31); and Congress in the cession Act of 1806 spe- 
cifically provided that the residents in this territory “provided for 
by the Constitution of the State of Tennessee” should be secured 
in their rights of occupancy and preémption and receive title for 
their claims, not exceeding six hundred and forty acres each, at 
“not less” than one dollar an acre (Sec. 2); and further recited 
that if this territory should not contain sufficient land fit for culti- 
vation to perfect all the claims ‘charged thereon, Congress would: 
thereafter provide for the deficiency out of the lands west or south 
of the Congressional Reservation line (Sec. 3). 
In view of the conflicting claims of the colleges and academies 
on the one side and of the occupants on the other, and the impossi- 
bility of locating in the designated territory two tracts of fertile 
land containing one hundred thousand acres each, exclusive of oceu-
-P-A-G-E-463
—449— 
pant claims, to be used for the benefit of the colleges and acad- 
emies at two dollars an acre, as required by the Act of Congress, 
it was possible for Tennessee either to sell the occupant claims at 
two dollars per acre (Congress having fixed one dollar merely as 
the minimum price and without establishing any maximum) or to 
increase from its other lands the acreage of the college and academy 
lands, so as to yield the intended amount at a less rate per acre, 
or to ask Congress for additional lands for the colleges and acad- 
emies. However, none of these things were done; but by an Act 
passed September 6, 1806, the Legislature, after providing that the 
occupants of lands south of the French Broad and Holston should 
be entitled to grants for their claims, in accordance with the Con- 
stitution and cession Act, at the rate of one dollar per acre, pay- 
able in ten annual installments (Sec. 2), directed that there should 
be laid off in this district two entire tracts, each containing one 
hundred thousand acres “of land actually claimed by occupancy, 
or fit for cultivation and improvement,” for the use of the colleges 
and academies, respectively, which tracts should be granted “on 
the same conditions, limitations, and restrictions” as the other 
lands south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers, except that 
the Treasurer should keep separate all moneys paid on account of 
land within these two tracts, which should be subject to the future 
disposal of the Legislature, so that the interest and profits of one 
tract should go to the two colleges and of the other to the acad- 
emies. (Sec. 23; Acts of 1806, Ch. 2; 1 Scott’s Rev., 915.) _ 
-By this Act, cutting in half the price of so much of the college 
and academy lands as were subject to occupant claims, the endow- 
ment provided for by the Act of Congress was at the outset, reduced 
to much below the $100,000 contemplated by the Act of Congress. 
East TENNESSEE COLLEGE CHARTERED, 1807. 
The Legislature in the following year, by an Act passed October 
26, 180%, entitled “An Act to establish a college in East 'Tennes- 
see,” after reciting the provisions of the cession Act’and the ‘expe- 
diency of establishing a college in Hast Tennessee capable of receiv- 
ing its part of the donation of land made thereby, enacted that
-P-A-G-E-464
—443— 
thirty persons should be appointed by the Legislature, who should 
be and were constituted a body politic and-corporate, by the name 
of the “ Trustees of East Tennessee College,” and should “have 
perpetual succession,” and who, with their successors, should be 
“endowed with, and receive in such manner as. the General Assem- 
bly of this State may from time to time direct, that part of the 
donation aforesaid, which was designed for the college in East Ten- 
nessee,” and should “be capable in law to purchase, receive, and 
hold to them and their successors forever, or for any less estate, 
any lands, tenements, goods, or chattels which shall be given, 
granted, or devised to them or purchased by them to the use of said 
college, and to use and dispose of the same in such manner as to 
them shall seem most advantageous for the use of said college” 
(Sec. 1) ; said trustees being also authorized to elect officers, confer 
degrees, and the like, and being given full power and authority 
“to make such by-laws, rules, and regulations for the government 
of said college and the promotion of education therein as in their 
opinion may be expedient or necessary,” provided the same are “ not 
inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States 
or of this State” (Sec. 3), and to “ sell, exchange, assign, transfer, 
or convey. any of the real or personal estate of said college by deed 
or otherwise, except the proceeds of the sales of one moiety of said 
one hundred thousand acres of land, with which the said college is 
endowed by this Act.” (Sec. 7; Acts of 1807, Ch. 84;.1 Scott’s 
Rev., 1047.) 
_ This Act further provided: “That upon the death, removal out 
of the county in which he resides, or resignation of any of the said 
trustees, the vacancy thereby occasioned shall be supplied by the 
remaining trustees appointing some other person, a resident of the 
same county in which the one deceased, resigned, or removed re- . 
sided; which appointment shall remain until the expiration of the 
next session of the General Assembly, within which time the Gen- 
eral Assembly shall supply such vacancy.” (Sec. 4.) 
’ By this Act the college was to be established on ten acres of land 
near Knoxville, at the Rocky or Poplar Spring (within the suburb 
afterwards known as Shicldstown), “conveyed in trust, for the use 
of said college, by Moses White.”. (Sec. 8.)
-P-A-G-E-465
—444— 
There is, however, no such conveyance recorded in the Register’s 
Office of Knox County, or other evidence that the college was ever, 
in fact, established upon this tract. 
SUPPLEMENTAL INcoRvoRATION Act oF 1807. 
By a supplemental Act passed December 3, 1807, thirty designated 
persons were appointed trustees of East Tennessee College, twenty- 
three being “ appointed amongst the different counties in East Ten- 
nessee, according to the present ratio of representation, and the 
remaining seven in the county adjacent to said college, for the pur- 
pose of conveniently attending to and conducting the ordinary af- 
fairs and business of said college.” (Sec. 1; Acts of 1807, Ch. 78; 
1 Scott’s Rev., 1059.) 
This Act further appointed three “commissioners to superin- 
tend the management of the fund appropriated by the Act of Con- 
gress of the United States for the support of said college and for 
the support of Cumberland College, heretofore established in West 
Tennessee, in pursuance of said Act of Congress,” and authorized 
these commissioners to receive from the treasurers of the land dis- 
tricts all moneys paid into their hands from the sale of the above- 
mentioned one hundred thousand acres of land appropriated for the 
use of the two colleges, which moneys the commissioners were au- 
thorized to invest in the capital stock of some reputable bank or 
banking association, taking the stock in their names for the use of. 
the two colleges, which stock they could not thereafter sell without 
special authority from the Legislature ; all dividends or profits from 
such stock to be paid over by them in equal portions to the two col- 
leges. (Sec. 2.) 
It was further provided that the trustees of East Tennessee Col- 
lege might carry on the college in the buildings of Blount College 
until suitable buildings should be prepared at the place designated 
for the establishment of Hast Tennessee College. (Sec. 3.) 
Further, in accordance with a resolution unanimously adopted 
by the trustees of Blount College, the Act incorporating Blount 
College was repealed, and it was enacted: “That the funds of 
Blount College shall be, and they are hereby, declared to be ‘incor-
-P-A-G-E-466
—445— 
porated with the funds of East Tennessee College and made a part 
of the same. And the trustees of East Tennessee college are hereby 
authorized and empowered to demand and receive from the trustees 
of Blount College all the funds and effects of said college, of what- 
ever nature and description; and said trustees of Blount College 
are hereby authorized and required to pay and deliver up to the 
trustees of East Tennessee College aforesaid, on demand, after the 
first meeting of said trustees, all moneys, goods, chattels, and effects, 
of whatever nature or description, belonging to Blount College in 
the hands of said trustees, or held in trust by any person or persons 
for the use of. said college, (and) by deed to convey to said trus- 
tees of East Tennessee College, and their successors in office forever, 
. all lands, tenements, and hereditaments belonging ‘to or appertain- - 
ing to said college; and said trustees last mentioned shall and may 
use and dispose of the same in like manner as they may use and dis- 
pose of any other property belonging to said college of Hast Ten- 
‘nessee” (Sec. 4); provided that debts due Blownt College were to - 
be retained and collected by it (Secs. 3, 4, and 5). 
How much property was received by East Tennessee College from 
Blount College in addition to the college site in Knoxville cannot 
be ascertained, but the amount was probably not large. 
The trustees of Hast Tennessee College organized in 1808, and 
carried on operations for a while in the Blount College building, 
but, from lack of funds, took no immediate steps toward the erec- 
tion of a new building, and in 1809, after the death of President 
‘Carrick, suspended the work of instruction, which was not resumed 
for several years. (White’s Early History, pp. 16-23.) 
REDUCTION AND PosTrONEMENT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL. 
ENDOWMENT, 1807-1822. 
The conflict of interest between the two colleges and the acad- 
emies, on the one hand, and the settlers.on the land which had been 
appropriated to college and academy uses, on the e other, resulted 
disastrously to the colleges and academies. 
Beginning with 1807, the Legislature, at the instance of the set- 
tlers, made, during a long succession of years, repeated and almost
-P-A-G-E-467
—446— 
regularly recurring extensions or indefinite postponements of the 
times of payment of the principal of the purchase money install- 
ments due from the settlers south of the French Broad and Holston 
Rivers, both on the college and academy lands and on the other 
lands sold by the State for ber own benefit, with repeated postpone- 
ments and occasional ‘remissions of accruing interest for longer 
or shorter repriods (Ch. 67, Acts of 1807; Ch. 34, Acts of 1809;

sufficient funds, unable to again open its doors until 1820, and then 
_ only in connection with Hampden-Sydney Academy. (White’s 
Karly History, p. 21.) 
Apparently the old Blount College building was again its college 
home, and nothing seems ever to have been done in reference to 
- building on the Poplar Spring site. 
“Act Dirsctine THe Levine Our or Contees Funp, 1809. 
By an Act passed April 22, 1809, it was recited that where “a 
considerable sum of money ” had been paid to the treasurer of the 
land districts, “which proceeded from the sale of occupant claims, 
appropriated to the use of colleges,’ no part of which had been 
drawn,out by the commissioners heretofore appointed, three per- 
sons were designated whose duty it should be to loan out this money 
on good security “at any rate of interest they can contract for,” 
not exceeding 15 per cent and not less than 6 per cent, and to pay 
over the interest thereon in moieties to the treasurers of Kast Ten- 
nessee College and Cumberland College (which had been designated 
as the western recipient of the college fund). (Acts of 1807, Ch. 
59; 1 Seott’s Rev., 1122.) 
AcT FoR THE BENEFIT OF COLLEGE AND ACADEMY STUDENTS, 1809. 
By an Act passed November 14, 1809, it was provided that no 
student should be expelled from “any or either of the colleges or 
academies in the State” unless two-thirds of the trustees. were
-P-A-G-E-468

present at the time of such expulsion, or suspended unless one-half 
of the trustees were present, a majority of those present voting for 
such suspension. (Acts of 1809, Ch. 52; 1 Scott’s Rev., 1160.) 
Acr AurHorizinc Lorrery ror BENEFIT OF THE COLLEGE, 1809. 
By an Act passed November 22, 1809, trustees were appointed

By an Act passed November 21, 1811, the commissioners of 
the college and academy funds were directed to collect in the

63.) . 
Act Directing InvustMant OF CoLLEGE AND ACADEMY 
Funps in Bank Stroox, 1813. - 
By an Act passed September 17, 1813, it was directed that one- 
half of all moneys theretofore or thereafter collected for the use 
af colleges should be paid over to the president and trustees of 
Cumberland College, who should “ vest ” same in stock of the Nash- 
ville Bank or the Bank of the State of Tennessee, and should be 
authorized to use the interest accruing, but should in no event be 
permitted to use any part of the principal. (Acts of 1813, Ch. 
106, Sec. 1; 2 Scott’s Rev., 166.) 
It was further provided that all moneys theretofore or thereafter 
collected for the use of academies in West Tennessee should be 
paid to the Treasurer of West Tennessee, and vested by him in like 
bank stock, and that all the accruing interest should be added to 
and made a part of the principal of said academy money until oth- 
erwise provided (Sec. 2) ; and, 
Further, that that part of said moneys which belong to the col- 
leges and academies of Hast Tennessee, respectively, should be dis-

cept that no part of same need be vested in Nashville bank stock. 
(Sec. 3.) 
Act Directing Payment or COLLEGE AND ACADEMY FUNDS 
To THEIR TRUSTEES, 1815. 
By an Act passed November 15, 1815, three additional commis- 
sioners were appointed for the college and academy funds, and the 
commissioners were directed to pay to the treasurers of Hast and 
West Tennessee, respectively, a moiety of the moneys collected for 
the use of colleges and the proportionate amounts of the academy 
fund to which East and West Tennessee were entitled—to wit, sev- 
enteen thirty-eighths and twenty-one thirty-eighths, respectively ; 
and on receipt of same, and once a year thereafter, or oftener if 
necessary, the said treasurers were directed to notify the trustees 
of the colleges and academies, by public advertisement, that they 
had received said moneys, and, on application, to pay the college 
moneys to the trustees of Cumberland College and “Blount Col- 
lege” and one-thirty-eighth part of the academy moneys to each 
academy, taking from the trustees of the colleges and academies 
bonds “conditioned that they will not waste the principal amount 
so received.” (Acts of 1815, Ch. 171; 2 Scott’s Rev., 271.) 
Act Recrtine Status or COLLEGE AND ACADEMY FuNDS AND 
Directine THEIR INVESTMENT IN BANK Stocks, 1817. 
By an Act passed November 22, 1817, it was recited that the 
commissioners of the college and academy funds had loaned. out 
$4,719.89 and two-thirds of principal and $103.98 and three-fourths 
of interest of the moneys collected for the use of colleges, at 10 per 
eent per annum, and $5,749.49 of principal and $125.96 and one- 
fourth of interest of the moneys collected for the use of academies ; 
that there had been paid to the Treasurer of West Tennesse $1,- 
032.56 and one-half of principal and $72.98 of interest of said money 
due to colleges and $2,615.91 and one-half of principal and $148.25 
and one-half of interest of said money due to academies, “of which
-P-A-G-E-470
—449— 
no part has been invested in bank stock,” as required by the Act of 
1813; and that there remained in the hands of the Treasurer of 
East Tennessee “money by him collected, in addition to the sums 
above named, for colleges, $619.44 principal and $123.62 interest, 
and for academies, $521.32 and one-half principal and $51.66 and 
one-half interest, which has not been divided.” In order to pro- 
vide for the application of said moneys for the purposes for which 
they were intended, it was enacted | (Acts of 1817, Ch. 174; 2 Scott’s 
Rev., 431) : 
That the Treasurer of East Tennessee should forthwith receive 
from the commissioners all moneys theretofore or thereafter col- 
jected by them on the above loans (when all their power and author- 
ity should cease), and should pay over to the Treasurer of West 
Tennessee, and from time to time as collected, one-half of the prin- 
cipal and interest of the whole amount collected for colleges, in- 
cluding the sum theretofore paid him, and twenty-three of forty- 
two equal parts of the principal and interest of the aeademy m money, 
including that already paid over to him (Sec. 1). 
That the. Treasurer of East Tennessee should loan out the acad- 
emy moneys and pay over the interest to the trustees of the differ- 
ent academies (Secs. 2 to 5), and should vest all moneys thereto- 
fore or thereafter received by him for the benefit of Hast Tennessee 
College in-stock of the bank of the State of Tennessee, at fifty dol- 
lars a share, by subscription or purchase, which should be taken in 
the name of the Treasurer of East Tennessee and held by him in 
trust, all profits made upon such stock to be paid to East Tennes- 
.see College for its use and benefit (Secs. 6 to 8); and that the 
Treasurer of West Tennessce should subscribe for and vest in the 
capital stock of any chartered bank of West Tennessee, in which 
he thought most advisable, and in the name of the president and 
trustees of Cumberland College, all principal. sums theretofore or 
thereafter received by him for Cumberland College, the dividends 
on which should be drawn and applied to the use of the college, and 
should pay over to Cumberland College all interest belonging to 
said college theretofore or thereafter received by him; and should 
in like manner subscribe for and vest in bank stock for the use of
-P-A-G-E-471
—450— . 
academies in West Tennessee all principal sums received by him for 
their use, and pay over to them all interest received (Secs. 9 to 11). 
APPOINTMENT OF ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES, 1820. 
By a joint resolution adopted July 29, 1820, the Legislature ap- 
pointed five “additional trustees” for Hast Tennessee College. 
(House Journal, 1820, p. 188.) 
TRUSTEES APPOINTED AND QuoruM PrescriBED, 1821. 
. By an Act passed November 16, 1821, the Legislature appointed 
nine trustees of the college, but whether or not to fill vacancies does 
not appear, and also provided that seven trustees should constitute 
a quorum. (Acts of 1821, Ch. 219.) 
Aot AUTHORIZING East TENNESSEE COLLEGE To SrLL Its Bank 
Stock aND CoLLEGE SIrm-anD ro Buy a NEw SITE, 1822. 
By an Act passed August 21, 1822, the trustees of East Tennessee 
College were authorized to sell any bank stock theretofore pur- 
chased, with the interest of moneys duc the college, and use the 
proceeds as they deemed most conducive to its interest (Sec. 1) ; 
to appropriate in such manner as should benefit the institution the 
interest on moneys belonging to the college that had been deposited, 
under the laws, in any banks of the State, which should thereafter 
be under the control of the trustees, and, two-thirds of the trustees 
concurring, to sell the lots and houses designated by law as the 
site of East Tennessee College, and appropriate the proceeds to the 
purchase of a more eligible site in the vicinity of Knoxville and 
the erection of other buildings for the institution. (Acts of 1822, 
Ch. 122.) 
The college site referred to, which was evidently the original - 
Blount College site, was not sold, however, until 1832. 
UNIversItY oF Norta Carolina CoMPact, 1822. 
In 1822 the University of North Carolina presented its memorial 
to the Tennessee Legislature, reciting that in pursuance of the res-
-P-A-G-E-472
—451— 
ervations made by North Carolina in her cession Act of 1789 and 
the compact made between the two States in 1804 and ratified by 
Congress in 1806, by which Tennessee was required to issue grants 
upon land warrants issued by North Carolina for the services of her 
revolutionary officers and soldiers, the State of North Carolina had 
issued to the University of North Carolina warrants for many thou- 
sand acres of land in Tennessee, founded upon the services of her 
revolutionary officers and soldiers who had died without heirs, and 
praying that Tennessee would now issue grants to the university 
upon these warrants and exempt them from taxation, and offering 
to give a fair equivalent for such exemption. , 
By an Act passed August 24, 1822, the Governor of Tennessee 
was directed to appoint two commissioners to investigate and adjust 
the claims of the University of North Carolina, who should be au- 
thorized to enter into an agreement with the university which should 
be binding upon the State. (Acts of 1822, Ch. 3; Whitney’s Land 
Laws, p. 480.) 
Governor Carroll having appointed Jenkins Whitesides and James 
Trimble ‘as commissioners, they on August 26, 1822, entered into 
a compact with the agent of the University of North Carolina, 
agreeing that the State of Tennessee should issue grants upon the 
warrants held by the University of North Carolina, and that all its 
Jand in Tennessee should be exempt from taxation until 1830; while 
the University of North Carolina, in return, agreed to transfer 
60,000 acres of its land warrants to two public seminaries desig- 
nated by the commissioners—that is, one-third, or 20,000 acres, 
to East Tennessee College, and two-thirds, or 40,000 acres, to Cum- 
berland College; and further agreed to assign to these two colleges 
in like proportions one-half of all military land warrants which 
might thereafter be issued to it from North Carolina. (Compact; 
' Whitney’s Land Laws, p. 481.) ~ 
From this generous gift, made by the State through its worthy 
commissioners, the Day Book of Hast Tennessee College shows that 
it realized from April 30, 1832, to February 22, 1859, in proceeds 
’ of sales, $19,112.98, less expenses, the exact amount of which can- 
not now be ascertained. (Hdward 'T. Sanford’s.“ Blount College
-P-A-G-E-473
—452— 
and the University of Tennessee,” p. 54.) What, if anything, ' was 
received prior to that date is not known. 
SETTLEMENT ACT, 1823. 
By an Act passed November 15, 1823, the Legislature, endeav- . 
oring to further indulge the residents south of the French Broad 
and Holston Rivers, whose necessities were in some instances great 
(as many as 466 tracts in this district having been advertised for 
sale -in 1821 for default in purchase money—House Journal, 1821, 
ps 120), and to do justice at the same time to the colleges and acad- 
emies, remitted, altogether, in the first instance, one-third of the 
entire amount, principal and interest, due on all lands previously 
sold south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers, and provided 
that the remainder should be paid in seven annual installments, 
and then, “in consideration of the delays of payments heretofore 
and hereafter to be sustained by the colleges and academies,” vested 
in the trustees of East Tennessee and Cumberland Colleges, one- 
half to each, the proceeds, principal and. interest; which would be- 
come due from tracts surveyed for the use of colleges, and in com- 
missioners of the academy fund created by the Act the whole of the 
proceeds of the tracts surveyed for the use of academies, and also 
vested in said trustees and commissioners, in the proportion of one- 
fourth to each of the colleges and one-half to the academy commis- 
sioners, the proceeds to become due “of the residue of the lands 
surveyed in said tract of country for the use of the State,” which 
should be paid over to the college trustees and academy commission- 
ers as collected; it “being intended to make a final appropriation 
and investiture of the moneys and lands aforesaid in said tract of 
country, and to put it out of the power of the Legislature to inter- 
fere hereafter by indulging the debtors, or in any other way what- 
soever.” (Acts of 1823, Ch. 30, Sees. 1 to 5; Whitney’s Land Laws, 
378.) 
It was further provided that when any lands in the district should 
be thereafter sold for default in payment of purchase money in- 
stallments and bid in by the Treasurer of East Tennessee, the right 
to all such lands within the college tract should be vested in the
-P-A-G-E-474
—453— 
trustees of Hast Tennessee and Cumberland Colleges in equal moie- , 
ties ; to all lands within the academy tract, in the academy commis- 
sioners; and to all other lands in said district, one-fourth each in 
the two colleges and one-half in the academy commissioners, and, 
after the time of redemption had expired, should be conveyed to 
them by the Treasurer in fee simple. (Sec. 6.) : 
The expectations raised by this Act were, however, largely dis- 
appointing ; for while considerable payments were made by -the set- 
tlers in 1824, though less than the sums required by the Act, in 
1825 they “almost unanimously ” refused to pay any more (Memo- 
rial of University of Nashville to Congress, 1834; 7 Amer. Hist. 
Mag., 80), and the trustees were authorized to resume the policy 
of postponing payments. (Ch. 24, Acts of 1824; see also Ch. 73, 
Acts of 1823.) : 
Miurary Lanp Warrant Act, 1825. 
In the meantime, however, the University of North Carolina had 
apparently received from North Carolina further military land 
warrants, one-half of which, according to the compact of 1822, it 
had agreed to assign to Hast Tennessee College and Cumberland 
College, the validity of which had never been adjudicated; and in 
. 1825 an Act was passed by the Legislature providing for a commis- - 
sioner who should examine all military land warrants issued to the 
University of North Carolina which should be laid before him by 
the university or by Hast Tennessee or Cumberland Colleges, and 
adjudicate their validity, not exceeding in the aggregate 105,000 
acres, upon which adjudication a corresponding amount of. land 
south and west of the Congressional Reservation line should be sold 
by the State at from 50 cents to $1 an acre, one-third of the pro- 
ceeds to be paid to the University of North Carolina, one-third to 
be appropriated to the use of common schools, two-ninths to be 
paid to Cumberland College, and the remaining one-ninth to East 
Tennessee College; the Act further providing that all sums so paid 
’ to the two colleges were to be received “ for the relief of the people 
residing on the college and academy lands south of the French 
Broad and Holston Rivers,” and “credited as a payment made ta
-P-A-G-E-475
—454— 
the said colleges and academies,” and that of the moneys subse- 
quently collected from the college and academy lands south of the 
French Broad and Holston Rivers the academies should first be 
paid an amount equal to that received by the colleges from these 
warrants; and East Tennessee College should be then equalized with 
Cumberland College. (Ch. 30, Acts of 1825; Whitney’s Land 
Laws, p. 487.) . 
It cannot now be definitely ascertained how much was received 
by East Tennessee College from this indirect gift made it by the 
State in lieu of its claims against the settlers which the State had 
postponed and remitted. It is probable, however, that in 1826 it 
received from this source one-ninth of the proceeds of about 91,000 
acres sold at 50 cents an acre, or about $5,000. (Letter of Daniel 
Graham, Secretary of State, Amer. St. Papers, Public Lands, Vol. 
9, p. 32; Sanford’s Blount College, p. 53, note 83, and p. 55, 
note 84.) : 
TRUSTEES APPOINTED, 1826. 
- By an Act passed December 6, 1836, the Legislature appointed 
eight trustees, but whether or not to fill vacancies does not appear. 
(Priv. Acts of 1826, Ch. 101.) 
Purcitase of Conince Hiti, 1828, anp Erection oF 
New BUILDINGS. 
In 1828 the college purchased for $600 the forty acres constitut- 
ing its present site, now known as College Hill (deed, Pleasant M. 
Miller to trustees of E. Tenn. College, Jan., 1828; Reg. Off., Knox 
Co., Bk. U, Vol. 1, p. £15), and erected thereon the present center 
college building, at a cost, it is said, of $13,000, and three one-story 
dormitories. (White’s Early History, pp. 23, 27.) 
Proposep SETTLEMENT OF 1829. 
By an Act passed December 31, 1829, the Legislature, weary of 
the long struggle between the colleges and academies and settlers, 
after reciting the long-continued controversy, the detriment to other 
legislative business, and the expense and perplexity which it had
-P-A-G-E-476
—455— 
produced, and “for the purpose of producing harmony and quiet 
between a respectable portion of the citizens of this State and the 
literary institutions therein and for the purpose of avoiding all 
future legislation respecting said subject,’ authorized the issuance 
to the trustees of Hast Tennessee College and the University of 
Nashville (the successor of Cumberland College) of a grant for a 
half township of land in the newly created Hiwassee District, and 
another half township for the use of the. academies of the State, 
provided the colleges and academies should first execute a deed 
releasing the citizens south of the French Broad and Holston Riv- 
ers from all judgments and other claims and demands of every 
character and all rights in lands sold and bid off for their benefit. 
(Acts of 1829, Ch. 47; Whitney’s Land Laws, p. 383.) 
This offer was accepted by East Tennessee College and a deed 
of release executed by its trustees on April 20, 1830, in which, how- 
ever, they protested against its being “construed to operate as a 
release to the State from its obligations to pay this institution the 
balance of its proportion of the congressional donation.” (Regis- 
ter’s Office, Blount County, Book 24, p. 9.) 
However, neither the University of Nashville nor the majority 
of the academies would consent to this settlement, which, there- 
fore, fell through. 
FInancran ConpITION OF East TENNESSEE COLLEGE, 1830. 
Owing to the loss of the college Cash Books prior to 1830, neither 
the source nor the amount of its earlier receipts can now be ascer- 
tained. On October 21, 1830, the report of the Auditing Commit- 
tee showed that the college then had on hand $3,249.25 in cash 
and $9,080 in notes for money loaned. (Day Book, Fol. 12); but 
how much had been obtained from Blount College, from the lands 
south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers, from the sale of 
lands obtained from the compact of 1822, and from the land war- 
rant Act of 1825, it is impossible to even accurately estimate. In 
addition to the money and notes above shown, the college also owned 
at that time the old Blount College site that had not been sold, the 
new site and college buildings, and also a tract of land in Knox
-P-A-G-E-477
—456— 
County, which it had bought in 1827 for $2,304, and which it after- 
wards sold, in 1834, for $3,100. (Deeds, Reg. Off., Knox Co., 
Bk. W, Vol. 1, p. 333; Bk. X, Vol. 1, p. 414.) 
Sauz or OriciInaL Blount Couiecs Sirs, 1832. 
-In 1832 the trustees of East Tennessee College, in pursuance.of 
the Act of 1822 authorizing the sale of the college site, sold, in four 
parcels, the entire town square constituting the original site of 
Blount College for the aggregate sum of $2,495, paid and secured to 
be paid. (Deeds, Oct. 20, 1832, Reg. Off., Knox Co., Bk. W, Vol. 
1, pp. 274, 306, 312, and 317.) 
MEMORIAL TO ConGress BY UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE, 1834. 
In 1834 the University of Nashville prepared a memorial to Con- 
gress, “ giving a history of the land grant fund and praying to be 
_ indemnified by another grant; ” but to no avail. 
ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES APPOINTED, 1836. 
By Resolution No. 3, passed November 19, 1833, the Legislature 
appointed six new trustees, all of whom were probably residents of 
the district south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers (Acts 
" of 1833, p. 120) ; but the existing college records do not show that 
any of them ever qualified or acted as trustees. 
CHARTER AMENDED AS 'TO Board MEETINGS AND COLLEGE 
Sessions, 1837. 
By an Act passed October 27, 1837, amending the college char- 
ter, the trustees were empowered to fix the beginning and ending 
of the college sessions, and. the stated meetings of the board were 
appointed on the last day of each session. (Acts of 1837-8, Ch. 
266.) 
New Trostens APPOINTED, 1837. 
By an Act passed November 9, 1837, the Legislature appointed 
five trustees, but whether or not to fill vacancies does not appear. 
(Acts of 1837-8, Ch. 62.)
-P-A-G-E-478

FINAL SETTLEMENT oF 1838. 
In 1838, the Jands south of the Hiwassee River having been, 
acquired by treaty from the Indians and established as the Ocoee 
District of Tennessee, the University of Nashville at length con- 
sented to.the settlement; and by an Act passed January 26, 1838, 
the Legislature directed that the entry taker of Ocoee District should © 
select and designate “the two half townships of land which have 
been reserved by law for the use of colleges and academies, the 
money arising upon the entry of which shall be paid-over to the 
trustees of Hast Tennessee College and the Nashville University 
in equal proportions, upon their agreement to receive the same: in 
full satisfaction of all claims which they have against the State - 
or the citizens residing south of the French Broad and Holston : 
Rivers.” (Acts of 1837-8, Ch. 196.) 
In this Act no compensation was made to East Tennessee Col- 
lege for the-excess of western lands that had been given to Cum- 
berland College. meee 
Out of these Ococe District lands, which were almost immediately — 
sold, East Tennessee College realized something over $34,000, its 
Day Book showing cash receipts in 1839 from this source aggre- 
gating $34,397.29, (Fol. 124.) A large part of these proceeds 
were apparently used in the erection of new college buildings. 
This is the last legislative enactment concerning the land grant 
fund of 1806, from which Congress had expected that the college 
in East Tennessee would have received, many years earlier, the sum . 
of $100,000 as its share of the educational endowment created by 
the cession Act. < . 
Name CHANGED to East TunNussen UNIVERSITY AND 
Powrrs EnLarGep, 1840. 
By an. Act passed January 29, 1840, the name of the college was 
changed to the trustees of Hast Tennessee University ; and the trus- 
tees, in addition to their original charter powers, were given the 
right to hold property for the support of schools for the learned 
professions, to confer medical degrees, and to enjoy all other rights,
-P-A-G-E-479
—458— 
privileges, and powers usually conferred upon universities. (Acts 
of 1839-40, Ch. 98.) 
DEED OF RELINQUISHMENT, 1844. 
By an indenture dated March 6, 1844, between the trustees of 
East Tennessee University and “the people south of the French 
Broad and west of Big Pigeon Rivers,” which was executed on 
behalf of the university by its president and secretary and under 
its corporate seal, it was recited that whereas by Act of January 
26, 1838, the Legislature of the State of Tennessee gave to Hast 
- Tennessee College, since East Tennessee University, and the Nash- 
ville University two half townships of land “in full satisfaction 
of their claim against the State of Tennessee and the people south 
of the French Broad and Holston Rivers,” in consideration thereof 
the trustees of Hast Tennessee University thereby relinquished “ all 
_ right, title, interest, claim, and demand of all and every kind which 
we may have in and upon the State of Tennessee or the people 
south of the French Broad and Holston and west of Big Pigeon 
Rivers.” (Reg. Off., Knox Co., Bk. H, Vol. 2, p. 450.). 
TRusTEES APPOINTED, 1850. 
By an Act passed February 9, 1850, the Legislature appointed 
twelve trustees, but whether or not to fill vacancies does not appear. 
(Acts of 1849-50, Ch. 130.) 
RESOLUTION or Inquiry, 1860. 
By joint resolution No. 35 adopted by the Legislature, March 
19, 1860, the judges of the Supreme Court were requested to report 
at the next session the facts in regard to the appropriation of the 
college lands under the Act of Congress of 1806, and to state their 
opinion as to the equitable right of the two universities to further 
compensation on this account; but, probably on account of the 
Civil War, nothing was ever done in this matter. (Acts of 1859- 
60, p. 676.)

ACT OF Concress Donating PuBLic LANDS FOR AGRICULTURAL

By an Act of Congress approved July 2, 1862, entitled “An Act 
donating public lands to the several States and Territories which 
may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the me- 
chanic ‘arts,” commonly called the Morrill Act, the United States 
granted to each of the several States thirty thousand acres of pub- 
lié land for each Senator and Representative in Congress, or, in 
default of sufficient public lands within any State, then land scrip 
to the amount of such acreage, which should be sold by the State, 
: paying all expenses out of its own treasury, and the entire pro- 
ceeds, “without any diminution whatsoever,” invested “in stocks 
of the United States, or of the States, or some other safe stocks, 
yielding not less than five per centum,” which should _“ constitute 
a perpetual fund,” the interest of which should be “inviolably ap- 
propriated ” to “the endowment, support, and maintenance of at 
least one college where the leading object shall be, without exclud- 
ing other scientific and classical studies and including military tac- 
ties, to teach such branclies of learning as are related to agriculture 
and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the Legislature of the 
States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal, 
and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pur- 
suits and professions of life” (Secs. 1 to 4.) 
Among the express conditions of this grant, it was provided that 
if any portion of the fund invested, or of the interest thereon, should 
by any action or contingency be diminished or lost, it should be 
replaced by the State, “so that the capital of the fund shall remain — 
forever undiminished ” and the annual interest applied “ with- 
out diminution ” to the purposes of the Act, except that not exceed- 
ing ten per centum of the amount received by any State might be 
_ expended for the purchase of sites or experimental farms when- 
ever authorized by the Legislature; that “no portion of said fund, 
nor the interest thereon, shall be applied directly or indirectly, un- 
der any pretense whatever, to the purchase, erection, preservation, 
or repair of any building or buildings; ” and that any State claim- 
ing the benefit of the Act should “ provide, within five years, .at

ACCEPTANCE BY TENNESSEE OF FUND For AGRICULTURAL 
AND MECHANICAL COLLEGE, 1868. 
The Civil War having prevented the acceptance of this gift by 
Tennessee before 1865 (Acts of 1865, Ch. 22), when the time orig- 
inally limited by Congress for its acceptance had expired, Congress, 
by joint resolution of February 28, 1867, extended and made appli- 
cable to Tennessce the provisions of the Act of July 2, 1862, and 
of an amendment of July 23, 1866. 
Thereupon, by an Act passed February 1, 1868, Tennessee again 
accepted all the provisions of the Act of Congress of July 2, 1862, 
and assented to the conditions, and directed that all necessary steps 
be taken to obtain the land scrip to which Tennessee was entitled 
under the Act; that the same when received should be sold and the 
proceeds “invested in six per cent interest-bearing bonds of this 
State, the principal of which bonds shall be forever held sacred 
for the purposes directed in the Act of Congress aforesaid, and the 
interest thereof shall be paid over semiannually; and that all costs 
and expenses in carrying the Act into effect should be paid out of 
the State Treasury. (Acts of 1867-8, Ch. 32.) 
In pursuance of this Act, the State received from the United 
States Government 1,875 pieces of land scrip, which were sold in 
New York City; and the proceeds, less expenses of $4,208.55 and a 
cash balance of $466.45, were invested in the purchase of $396,000 
of six per cent Tennessee bonds. 
The State, having now obtained its quota of scrip and invested 
them in its own bonds, in order to comply with the Act. it became 
necessary to “provide” the required college. This, various insti- 
tutions of the State, among others Hast Tennessee University, of- 
fered to do for the State if given the benefit of the congressional 
fund. 
ADDITIONAL TRUSTEES APPOINTED, 1868. 
_~ By an Act passed March 8, 1868, the Legislature appointed eleven 
additional trustees. (Priv. Acts of 1867-8, Ch. 88.)

Acr Appropriarinc AGRICULTURAL AnD MECHANICAL Funp 
to East TENNESSEE Universrry, 1869. 
By an Act passed January 16, 1869, entitled “An Act to estab- 
lish the Tennessee Agricultural College” (Acts of 1868-9, Ch. 12), 
it was enacted “that the proceeds of the sale of the agricultural 
scrip, provided by Congress for the establishment of an institution 
of learnirig, devoted to agriculture and the mechanic arts, be, and 
are hereby, appropriated to the University of Hast Tennessee, upon 
the restrictions and conditions herein mentioned; ” “ that it. shall 
be the duty of the trustees of said university to establish an agri- 
cultural college, so as to strictly conform with the congressional 
enactment making the appropriation ;” and “that the fund hereby 
appropriated shall be used only according to the terms of the con- 
gressional enactment making the appropriation to the State.” (Acts 
of 1868-9, Ch. 12, Secs. 1-3.) 
_It was further provided that as soon as the trustees of the uni- 
versity had completed buildings for the accommodation of 275 stu- 
dents.and furnished the same with appropriate school’ furniture, 
and also not less than 200 acres of suitable lands, ‘so that the whole ; 
property should be worth not less than $125,000, it should be law- 
ful to issue to its trustees “the bonds of the State in which the 
proceeds of the sale of the agricultural scrip had been inves 
(See. 4.) 
- It was further provided by this Act and an amendment passed 
December 5, 1871 (Acts of 1871, Ch. 57), “that three students 
from each county in the State of Tennessee shall at all times be 
entitled to receive free tuition in said college, said students to be 
nominated by the several Representatives to the Legislature from 
‘each county in the State, and preference being given . . . to 
those who’ excel in public schools, it being understood that in all - 
cases prior claims should be given to those whose cixcumstances 
especially require it.” (Sec. 6.) 
By this. Act the Governor, Secretary of State, and State Super- 
jntendent of Public Instruction were made ex-officio members of 
‘the board of trustees of the university. (Sec. 8.)
-P-A-G-E-483
—462— 
Six new trustees were also added to the board—three from Mid- 
dle Tennessee and three from West Tennessee. (Sec. 11.) 
The board.of trustees. were also required to deposit with the Sec- 
retary of State their bond in double the amount of the issue of 
State bonds received, binding them to carry into effect the con- 
gressional enactment making the appropriation. , (Sec. 9.) © 
The trustees were also required to “ make a report to each biennial 
session of the Legislature, giving the number of students, together 
with a detailed statement of the workings of the institution and of 
receipts and expenditures,” and at the same time secure the above- 
mentioned bond. (Sec. 12.) 
The last section of this Act is as follows: “'That the Legislature 
reserves the right to control and manage said fund by whatever 
legislation may be deemed necessary for its protection and safety; 
provided, no such legislation shall extend to the removal of said 
fund from the University of East Tennessee, so long as it shall 
comply with and observe the requirements of the Act of Congress 
donating said fund.” (Sec. 14.) 
The trustees of the university at once accepted the trust imposed 
by this Act, and took steps to carry out its provisions. By May 
of 1869 the necessary land had been obtained and the other condi- 
tions of the Act complied with, and in September of that year the 
Agricultural College went into operation. 
TrRusrEss APPOINTED, 1870. 
By joint resolution No. 23, approved June 25, 1870, the Legis- 
lature appointed four trustees, but whether or not to fill vacancies 
does not appear. (Acts of 1870, p. 207.) 
’ Loss in INTEREST.ON AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE FUND, 1873-77. 
Owing to the straitened financial condition of the State for sev- 
eral years after the Agricultural College was established, the State 
not only often delayed the payment of interest on its bonds, but 
frequently paid the same in depreciated State warrants, which the 
university was obliged to peddle upon the open market for what 
they would bring, the treasurer’s report showing that between the
-P-A-G-E-484
—463— 
years 1873 and 1877 the university lost over $12,000 by this pay- 
ment in depreciated State warrants alone.’ The Legislature by res- 
olution No. 33, adopted February 5, 1875, appointed a committee 
to inquire into this matter (Acts of 1875, p. 298); but although 
the State in its Act of 1868 had directed that the interest on the 
bonds should “be paid over semiannually,” and although the Act 
of Congress of 1862 provided that “if any portion of the fund 
invested ... . or any portion of the interest thereon should 
by. any action or contingency be diminished or lost, it should be 
replaced by the State, to which it belongs, so that the capital of 
the fund should remain forever undimjnished, and the annual inter- 
est thereon shall be regularly applied without diminution ” to the 
support of the college, nothing has ever been- done in the matter. 
NuMBER AND APPORTIONMENT oF StaTE STUDENTS, 1873. 
By an Act passed March 22, 1878, Section 6 of the Act of 1868 
establishing the Tennessee Agricultural College was amended so as 
to provide “ that two hundred and seventy-five (275) students from 
the State of Tennessee shall-at all times be entitled to receive free 
tuition in said college, the said students to be appointed by the sev- 
éral Senators and Representatives in the General Assembly of the 
State, each Senator being entitled to appoint two and each Repre- 
sentative three, according to the population of the counties repre- 
sented by them” (Sec. 1); that the trustees’ biennial report should 
be made at least ten days before the commencement of the Legis- 
lature and transmitted by the Governor, together with his regular 
message (Sec. 2) ; and that the university should provide “all nec- 
essary and suitable accommodations and buildings” for the num- 
ber of students to which the State is entitled (Sec. 3, Acts of 1872, 
Ch. 81). -

August there shall still remain vacancies unfilled by Senators or 
Representatives, the president of the university shall be authorized 
-to fill the same from the list of qualified candidates by appoint- 
ments for one year only, giving preference to counties or cities 
whose quota has not been filled and to those persons who stood 
highest in the order of merit. (Acts of 1879, Ch. 155.)

By a an Act passed November 28, 1881, the Comptroller was aie

on‘account of costs which had been deducted from the proceeds of 
‘the ‘sale of land scrip donated under the Act of Congress of 1862, 
and the small unexpended balance of the proceeds of said sale; but 
no: interest was paid on these amounts. (Acts of 1881, Ch. 43.)

ifuble institutions and funds held for educational purposes,” it was 
“enacted ‘that any literary or charitable institution incorporated un-

bonds that had belonged to the East Tennessee University, and re- 
ceived in exchange nine certificates of indebtedness of $1,000 each, 
bearing five per cent; and on February 21, 1891, it surrendered to 
the State the $396,000 of six-per-cent bonds it had received as

" object and duty of said experiment stations to conduct original re- 
searches or verify experiments on the physiology of plants and ani-

edies for the same; the chemical composition of useful plants at 
their different stages of growth; the comparative advantages of 
rotative cropping as pursued under a varying series of crops; the

in accordance with the Act of Congress approved March 2, 1887, 
the additional sum of $5,000 per annum for the first year and an 
annual increase for five years of $2,000 over the preceding year, 
aftér which the annual amount to be paid to each State and ‘Ter-

LxeatsLative INsrecTion aND REGULATION SINCE 1868. 
Furthermore, during almost, if not all, of the biennial sessions of 
the Legislature since 1868, and regularly in recent years, the uni- 
versity has been visited, its-properties inspected, and its affairs ex- 
amined by one or both of the legislative committees on Educational 
Institutions and Agriculture. The Legislature has also from time 
to time, since 1868, adopted various resolutions in reference to the 
conduct of the university and investigation of its affairs, among 
which may be cited: House Joint Resolution No. 14, adopted Feb- 
ruary 22, 188%, in reference to “scientific and classical studies ” 
(Acts of 1887, p. 443); House Joint Resolution No. 21, adopted 
February 28, 1887, directing the Committee on Charitable Institu- 
tions to investigate complaints against the university (Acts of 1887, 
p. 443) ; Senate Joint Resolution No. 10, adopted January 30, 1889, 
appointing a committee to visit the university and report as to its 
“condition and affairs (Acts of 1889, p. 512); Senate Joint Reso- 
lution No. 16, adopted March 29, 1887, commending the policy of 
the university in reference to industrial education (Acis of 1887, 
p. 431); and House Joint Resolution No. 57, adopted April 12, 
1905, directing the Attorney-general of the State to examine and 
report as to the property held by the university and the method of 
selection of its trustees (Acts of 1905, p. 1293). 
It should be added that in the appointments of trustees to fill 
vacancies the Legislature has, we believe, without exception, per- 
manently appointed the persons selected by thé board of trustees to 
fill vacancies; but this has been merely a matter of courtesy to the 
trustees, and the Legislature, of course, has the full and undisputed 
legal right to disregard the temporary appointments made by the 
board and to fill the vacancies permanently with any Persons whom 
it may desire.

Status or THE UNIVERSITY. 
Summarizing, it will be seen that the foundation of the university 
is the charter and property of Hast Tennessee College, which was 
inéorporated by the Legislature for the express purpose of receiving 
one-half of the land grant fund created by the congressional ces- 
sion Act of 1806 for the use of two colleges in the State; that un- 
der this charter the Legislature not only appointed all the original 
trustees, but also specifically reserved the right of permanently fill- 
"ing all vacancies arising in the board; and that during the succeed- 
ing years the Legislature from time to time passed laws affecting 
this land grant fund, adding other trustees to the board and regu- 
lating the college in various ways. 
We are of the opinion, in the light of the decision of the Supreme 
Court of Tennessee in the case of the Trustees of Carrick Acad- 
“emy vs. Clark, 112 Tenn., 483, involving the charter of an academy 
created for the. purpose of receiving part of the academy fund cre- 
ated by the same cession Act of 1806, that the college, under its 
charter, became, as a public corporation, one of the educational 
agencies of the State to accomplish the object specified in the ces- 
sion Act, and that this public agency, together with the express. 
power reserved by the Legislature of ultimate control of its affairs 
by the permanent appointment of all of its trustees, made it in 
substance and in fact a State institution for the purpose of carrying 
out that portion of the cession Act for which it was chartered. 
Coupled with this original foundation, and in addition to the 
original purpose for which it was created of establishing a general 
educational institution, it has become, by virtue of the Act of 1869, 
constituting in effect a contract made by the State with the uni- 
versity, and by various subsequent Acts, the agency designated by 
the State of Tennessee to receive and administer, in its behalf, the 
funds given by Congress for the benefit of agricultural and me- 
chanical colleges and experiment stations established in connec- 
tion therewith, and for these purposes has been designated as the 
beneficiary of such funds, and charged, on behalf of the whole State, 
with the duty of administering, for the whole State and as a State 
institution, the agricultural college and experiment station funds.
-P-A-G-E-496
—473— 
Further, by virtue of this original contract of 1869 and the 
amendments thereto which have been from time to time tacitly, at 
least, acquiesced in by the university, the State has acquired, 
through the appointment of ex-officio trustees, the requirements 8 
to the geographical distribution of trustees, the reports of its oper- 
ations to the Governor, and State scholarships in the agricultural 
college, and in other ways, the right of close inspection.and super- 
vision of the college in order to see that the conditions attached by 
Congress to its grants for agricultural colleges and experiment sta- 
tions are faithfully and effectively carried out and that the privilege 
of free tuition in the Agricultural College is granted: to students 
of the State in accordance with the contract. made by the univer+ 
sity; while, on the other hand, the State, by giving the wniversity 
the name of the State and providing for the distribution of the 
State’s scholarships by a system of public examinations throughout 
the State and by recent gifts from its treasury for the purpose of 
purchasing experiment station property, developing the university, 
and paying the traveling expenses of State students, has given its 
official seal to the university as a State institution administering, 
for the. benefit of the State, and as its representative, the agricul- 
tural college and experiment station funds, for whose administra- 
tion the State was required to provide. by the terms oft the congres- 
sional gifts. 
In its essence, therefore, the university seems to us to be a public 
corporation, whose ultimate control, through the appointment of 
trustees, rests entirely in the Legislature, and which, as an educa- 
tional agency of the State, has been vested, in behalf of the people 
of the entire State, with funds to be administered for their benefit 
and for whose faithful use it has incurred the highest and most sol- 
- emn obligation. 
While we have no specific recommendation to make in the prem- 
ises, we are yet of the opinion that the close relationship which 
exists between the university and the State is not generally real- 
ized, and that its true function as an educational agency and State 
_ university engaged in carrying out the most-important higher edu- 
cational work that has devolved upon the State has not been gener- 
ally appreciated. As a result, on the one hand, private citizens,
-P-A-G-E-497
—474— 
regarding it as a State institution, have been unwilling to contrib- 
ute to any great extent to its support; while, on the other hand, 
not only has the obligation which it has incurred to the State of 
giving free tuition to State students in the Agricultural College 
made it practically impossible to collect tuition fees to any consid- 
erable extent from any of the students in any other department of 
the university and limited its income in the main to the public 
funds which it-receives, but there has also been on the part of many 
of the State authorities a feeling that the university was really a 
private institution not subject to State control, and hence not enti- 
tled, except as a matter of generosity, to support from the State 
treasury. 
We are of the opinion, as already stated, that in its essence the 
university is a State institution and subject to ultimate control of 
the State for the purposes of its trusts. We hope that this organic 
relationship between the university and the State may be yet more 
fully appreciated, and that the State, realizing that the university 
is an institution of the entire State, not merely in fact, but in law, 
may continue the work, so generously begun, of the financial sup- 
port which is necessary in order that the university may keep pace 
with the demands of the time and give to the youth of the State. the 
efficient and practical educational equipment needed in the work of 
preserving the high standard of its citizenship and the development 
of the splendid resources of the State.

ing as ‘to the title of their governing board, the method of their 
: selection, the terms for which. they are selected, and the relation- 
ship to the board of the president and alumni to the institution. 
These replies are filed herewith. . 
-We have summarized these replies and obtained’ the following 
‘information therefrom : 
TITLE oF GovERNING Boarp.

Mernop or SgELectind THE GOVERNING BoarD. 
The widest divergence appears in the method of selecting the gov- 
erning board. Disregarding ex-officio members, the other members 
are selected as follows: 
In twenty institutions<namely, California, Florida, Georgia, In- 
diana (Purdue University), Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Ore- 
gon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington (State

appointed by the Governor. 
In Maine the entire eight members are appointed by the Governor, _ 
but one is appointed on the recommendation of the alumni. 
In twelve institutions--namely, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi (University of Mississippi and Agricultural and Me- 
chanical College}, North Dakota (except one life member), Ohio 
(Ohio University, Miami University, and State College), Washing- 
ton (University of Washington), Virginia, and West Virginia—they 
are appointed by the Governor, subject to confirmation by the

In four—namely, Colorado, QWinois, Michigan, and Nebraska— 
they are chosen at general public “elections,” there being in Col- 
orado regular party nominations as in case of other State officers. 
In North Carolina they are elected by the Legislature.
-P-A-G-E-500
471 
In Arizona they are appointed by the Governor and confirmed 
by the Legislative Council. 
In Indiana University, out of a board of eight, five are selected 
by the State Board of Education and three by the alumni. 
In Cornell twenty members are elected by the board of trustees, 
ten by the alumni, and one by the New York State Agricultural 
Grange. 
In Iowa one member is elected by the General Assembly from. 
each of the eleven congressional districts. 
In New Hampshire ten members are appointed by the Governor, 
and one alumnus is elected by the alumni by ballot. 
In Vermont one-half of the board is elected by the Legislature, 
and the other half is self-perpetuating. 
In Alabama the members were originally appointed by the Gov-

by the remaining members, subject to confirmation by the Senate. 
In Connecticut ‘six members, are appointed by the Senate for 
terms of four years each, one selected by the alumni for two years, 
and one elected annually by the Board of Agriculture. 
In Pennsylvania nine members are elected by the alumni, six 
- appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate, and 
twelve chosen by certain State agricultural societies, county agri- 
cultural societies, the Franklin Institute, and the mining and man- 
ufacturing associations of the State. 
(In South Dakota the members are removable by the Governor 
_ without assigning cause.) 
RESTRICTIONS ON MEMBERSHIP. 
In Alabama one member is elected from each congressional dis- 
trict, except that in which the university is located, which has two 
members. 
In Arkansas and Iowa there is one member from each ¢ congres- 
sional district.

four from the State at large, and two from the city of Athens. 
In Louisiana, of the twelve members appointed by the Governor, 
one is required to reside in Baton Rouge, and only one member 
allowed from any one parish, except New Orleans, which has two. 
In Missouri not more than five of the nine appointed members 
can belong to the dominant party, and not more than one can come 
from any congressional district. - 
In Mississippi, of the sixteen appointed members, one is appointed 
from each of the eight congressional districts and eight from the 
State at large. 
In Rhode Island one member is appointed from each county in 
the State. . 
In Wisconsin the members are appointed from each congressional 
district and two from the State at large. 
NUMBER OF BoarD. 
While specific inquiries were not made as to the number of mem- 
bers in the governing boards, it incidentally appears from the re~ 
plies of twenty-seven institutions that the number varies greatly ; 
thus, including ew-officio members, in two, Nebraska and Nevada, 
the board consists of four members; in three, North and South Da- 
kota and Florida, of five; in one, Arizona, of six; in three—Ar- 
kansas, Kansas, and the University of Washington—of seven; in 
three—Michigan, Maine, and Indiana University—of eight; in 
three—Missouri, Utah, and the Mississippi Agricultural and Me- 
chanical College—of nine; in two, Alabama and Connecticut, of 
ten; In one, Montana, of eleven; in one, Illinois, of twelve; in two, 
towa and New Hampshire, of thirteen; in two, Wisconsin and 
Louisiana, of fifteen; in one, Massachusetts, of seventeen; in one, 
California, of twenty-three; in one, Pennsylvania, of thirty-two; 
and in one, Cornell, of thirty-nine. The number is generally 
smaller in the new States and larger in the old States, and the 
average in these twenty-seven institutions is almost exactly twelve 
members.

Trrm oF OFFicE. 
In Ohio University the term of office is for life; in California, 
sixteen years; in Alabama and Oregon, twelve years; in Miami 
University, nine years; in Georgia and Michigan, eight years; and 
in Massachusetts, Maine, and Ohio State University, seven years. 
In. fourteen institutions, or almost one-third of the- whole num- 
ber—-namely, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana (Purdue Uni- 
versity), Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi (University and 
Agricultural and Mechanical College), Nebraska, South Dakota, 
Washington (University and State College), and Wyoming—the 
term is six years. 
In two—namely, | Cornell and Rhode Island—the term is five 
years. 
In nine—namely, Arizona, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Utah, and West Virginia —the 
term is four years. 
In four—namely, Indiana University, New Hampshire, Pennsyl- 
vania, and Wisconsin—the term is three years. : 
In Missouri the term is for various periods of two, four, and six 
years; in Connecticut, from one to four years; in Florida and Ne- 
vada, from two to four years. 
In Texas the term is two years. 
In Vermont the term of those elected by the Legislature i is six 
years, and the term of those elected by the board is indefinite. 
In California, of sixteen members, the terms of two expire every 
second year; in Illinois, of nine elective members, three aré selected 
at the time of each general election; in Kansas, of six appointed 
members, three are appointed each legislative year; in Louisiana, 
of twelve appointed members, three are appointed each year; in 
Massachusetts, of fourteen appointed members, two are appointed 
each year; in Michigan, of eight members, two are elected every 
second year; in the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical Col- 
lege, out of nine appointed members, three are appointed every sec- 
ond year; in Montana, of the eight appointed members, two are 
appointed each year; in Nebraska, of the six elected members, two 
are elected every second year-—one for a term of four years and
-P-A-G-E-503
—480— 
one for two years; in Cornell, of the thirty members elected by the 
board and by the alumni, six are elected each year; in Pennsyl- 
vania, of the nine alumni representatives, three are chosen each 
year, and, of the six members appointed by the Governor, two are 
appointed each year; in South Dakota, of the five regents, two are 
appointed every two years, except the third period, when one is ap- 
pointed, the term of office of one-half of the members expiring every 
two years; and in the State College of Washington, where the term 
"is six years, not more than two go out’ at any one time, 
In a letter received from President Ayres, accompanying the 
replies from the foregoing institutions, he writes as follows: 
“An examination of these papers will show that in the majority of 
cases the method of appointment of the boards of trustees is by. 
direct appointment by the Governor, with the approval of the Sen- 
ate. In the cases of the best type of institutions, however, the sys- 
tem is that of aboard of regents of a somewhat limited number, 
say eight or ten, serving six or more years, two members coming 
in and the same number retiring at every general election. I beg 
to call your attention to the interesting case of the University of 
Alabama, where the system of appointment by the Governor for- 
' merly existed and where they have lately, under the new Constitu- 
tion, changed the system to one very similar, if not identical, with 
our own; except that ithe term of service is limited to twelve years.” 
In the reply received from the University of Alabama referred 
to by President Ayres it is stated that the board of trustees were 
“ originally appointed by the Governor, one from each congressional 
district, except that in which the university is located, which has 
two members. Under the new State Constitution, vacancies on the 
board are filled by vote of the remaining members, subject to con- 
firmation by the State Senate. The term of service is twelve years. 
The Alumni Society, under enactment of the Legislature, 
selects an Advisory Committee of three, who sit with the board of 
trustees and enjoy all of the ‘privileges of members except that of 
voting. One member of this committee is selected annually by the 
society of the alumni.”

TENNESSEE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. 
The first historical association in Tennessee was organized on 
October 21, 1819, and was called the “ Tennessee Antiquarian Soci- 
ety.” It included among its original membership the names of 
such men as John Haywood, then on the supreme bench; Henry 
Crabb, who afterwards succeeded him on the bench; William Car- 
roll, afterwards Governor of the State; Sam Houston, who suc- 
ceeded him in the executive chair; and Wilkins Tannehill, an emi- 
nent citizen, a man. of letters, and a recognized authority on the 
Masonic craft. 
Judge Haywood was then engaged in collecting materials for two 
important books—the Civil and Political History of Tennessee, and 
the Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee—both of which 
were published in 1823. To recognize the value of the Tennessee 
Antiquarian Society, one has only to note the immense amount of 
valuable material preserved in these two volumes, which have won 
for their author the title of “ Father of Tennessee History.” 
The officers of this society were: John Haywood, president; Will- 
iam Hume, vice president; F. B. Fogg, corresponding secretary ; 
Wilkins Tannehill, recording secretary; Henry Crabb, treasurer; 
and R. E. W. Earl, librarian. 
The minute book of the Tennessee Antiquarian Society, a large
-P-A-G-E-508
—485— 
record book, is still preserved in the archives of the Tennessee His- 
torical Society. It contains the constitution and minutes of the 
society and many valuable historical contributions by its members 
and correspondents. The first recorded minutes are of the meet- 
ing appointed for the adoption of by-laws, and set forth: 
' “Saturday, July 1, 1820.—The members of a proposed society 
_for-the collection and preservation of important events in the his- 
tory of the State of Tennessee, and inquiries into the antiquities of 
the Western country, etc., met at the courthouse in the town of 
Nashville, when John Haywood, Esq., was appointed chairman, and 
Wilkins Tannehill secretary. 
“The business of the meeting was opened by an appropriate ad- 
dress from. the chairman. Mr. Roane, from the committee, re- 
: ported a system of rules and regulations for the government of said 
society, which being read, and various amendments being made 
“thereto, was adopted as follows.” 
The stimulus afforded by Judge Haywood’s investigations hav- 
ing subsided, the meetings of the society were held at increasingly. 
. irregular intervals, and finally ceased with the called meeting of 
_ August 24, 1822. 
From this date until 1849 the State was without a historical so- 
tiety at its capital. The sphere of historical activity in the State 
seems to have been removed to Hast Tennessee, whete Dr, J. G. M. 
Ramsey, an accurate and trustworthy historian, was engaged in © 
writing his Annals of Tennessee, which appeared in 1853. In 
this important work he acknowledges himself indebted to the East 
Tennessee Historical and Antiquarian Society. But at this date 
another effort was made at Nashville. In pursuance to-a call made 
through the public press, a number of patriotic citizens met at the 
library rooms of the Merchants’ Association, on Tuesday evening, 
May 1, 1849, and organized a society having for its object “the 
collection and preservation of the facts relative to the natural, ab- | 
otiginal, and civil history of the State of Tennessee.” 
he officers of this new society were: Nathaniel Cross, president; 
A.W. Putnam, vice president; W. A. Eichbaum, treasurer; John 
H:. Eakin, corresponding secretary; and W. F. Cooper, recording 
secretary.
-P-A-G-E-509
——486— 
For a year or two the meetings of this society were well attended ; 
but so difficult is it to maintain interest in a voluntary association 
" of this sort without some immediate stimulus that, as soon as the 
novelty wore off, the interest abated, and between the years 1851 
and 1857 there occurs almost a hiatus in the proceedings of the 
society. Still this society was doubtless of vast importance to the 
history of the State. Its vice president, Col. A. W. Putnam, be- 
came interested in Tennessee history, and conceived the purpose of 
writing his extensive and painstaking History of Middle Tennes- 
see, which he brought out in 1859. 
Under the stimulus of this new enterprise a reorganization of the 
society was effected on February 28, 1857, with the following corps 
of officers: A. W. Putnam, president; Thomas Washington, vice 
president ; W. A. Hichbaum, treasurer ; R. J. Meigs, Jr., correspond- 
ing secretary ; Anson Nelson, recording secretary; and J okn Meigs, 
librarian. 
~ Soon after the reorganization of the society the General Assem- 
bly, by joint resolution, extended to it the use of so much room as 
it might need in the State Library at the Capitol. Accordingly its 
collection was installed with the State Library. Contributions of 
valuable manuscripts, newspapers, relics, etc., poured in from all 
parts of the State, and its museum soon became one of the attract- 
ive features of the State Library. It continued its connection with 
the State Library until 1886. 
_ In the meantime the Civil War came on, and after the September 
meeting, 1860, the society ceased active operations until 1874. In 
that year it was reorganized, with Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey, president; 
Dr. R..C. Foster, vice president; Dr. John H. Currey, treasurer ;

incorporation Act of 1875, “to collect, preserve, and perpetuaté

In 1886 the Tennessee. Historical Sociely was crowded out of the 
State Library. The trustees of the Watkins Institute Building— 
the benefaction of a laboring:man;.the late Samuel ‘Watkins, as a 
temple of art and science—offered them a home in the Watkins In- 
stitute Building, which was accepted, and thither their collection 
.wag removed. In this building the society has. ever since stored its 
collection and maintained a historical and: archeological museum, 
to which the public is freely admitted. . 
Jn 1884 Dr, J..G. M. Ramsey died, and was succeeded as presi- 
dont of the Tennessee Historical Society by Judge John M. Lea, 
who presided until his death in 1903...On-the death of Judge Lea, 
Gov. James D. Porter was elected president. The present officers 
of the society are: James D. Porter, president; Gates P. Thruston, . 
vice president for Middle Tennessee; W. A. Henderson, vice. presi- 
dent of the Tennessee. Historical Society by Judge John M. Lea,

«As to the value of its collection and the present needs of the so- 
wiety, I desire to add an extract from the Memorial of the Tennes- 
see Historical Society to the Fifty-fourth General Assembly, pre- 
pared by Dr. Frederick W. Moore: 
“Your memorialists further respectfully represent that the .so- 
‘ciety has ever been diligent in pursuing the purposes of its organi- 
zation. In particular, it has accumulated a large and valuable col- 
lection of original documents, portraits, and antiquarian and arche- 
Ological objects, setting forth and illustrating the history of the 
State from aboriginal times to the present. These collections in- 
clude portraits of the Presidents whom the State has furnished to 
the Union and of most of the’ Governors, from William Blount 
down; State documents; letters and nartatives of early pioneers, 
~ statesmen, and scholars; original contributions to-history and biog-
-P-A-G-E-511
—488— 
raphy; and archwological- objects. typical of this region, in which 
are found examples of flints and pottery unexcelled by the aborigi- 
nal remains in any other part of the United States. These items, 
too numerous to mention’ in detail, are set forth in Exhibits ‘B, 
“OC, and ‘D, which have been laid before your honorable bodies 
and to which your attention is respectfully directed. 
“RICHNESS AND VALUE OF THE COLLECTION. 
“ The richness of the collection may be illustrated by the mention 
of rare examples of aboriginal pottery in conventionalized animal 
shapes, of ceremonial flints seventeen inches long, and of documents 
such as the ‘Proposed Constitution of the State of Franklin;’ 
‘The Journals of the Territorial Government of the Territory 
South of the Ohio River under Governor William’ Blount;’ 
‘Treaties between the United States and Indian Tribes in and 
Adjacent to the State;’ ‘The Diary of John Donelson, who led 
the families of the early settlers of Nashville by boat from East 
- Tennessee to their destination; ‘The Early Records of the County 
of Washington, in East Tennessee;’ and ‘The Cumberland Com- 
. pact,’ or the original articles of government agreed to by the early 
settlers on the Cumberland River. Barely one of these many val- 
uable documents exists in duplicate, and very few have ever been 
printed. They exist in these sole and singular forms only; they 
would be irreplaceable if destroyed; and without them important 
facts of the State’s history cannot be written and illustrated. For 
the members of the Tennessee Historical Society your memorialists 
know, and for the people of the State they believe, that the carcless 
Joss of one of them would be condemned as gross negligence, and 
the willful destruction or disposal of them as a most unpatriotic act. 
“Tn the true and proper sense they are invaluable, beyond valua- 
tion. Yet by comparison with similar objects as they are bought 
and sold among collectors and dealers in antiquities, it is possible 
to put a commercial valuation upon them with some degree of ap- 
proximation. By a gentleman, a member of the society and well 
acquainted with its collections, who is a man of recognized business 
judgment and who is a dealer in such objects, your_memorialists
-P-A-G-E-512
—489— 
are informed that, in his judgment, a collector in the United States 
to-day might spend one hundred thousand dollars and still not: ac- 
cumulate so rich and choice a collection as that which the ‘Tennessee 
Historical Society has accumulated and now possesses. 
“The Watkins Institute Building was then [when entered by the 
society] new and considered of standard construction ; nor were the 
buildings adjacent so close or put to such dangerous uses as those 
now standing nearest to it. It is now considered, by reason of its 
construction and surroundings, one of the greatest fire risks in the 
city, and the insurance rates charged upon it and its contents are 
from four to five times as great per thousand as those upon an or- 
dinary brick dwelling and its contents. 
“ TNABLLITY OF THE SOCIETY TO PROTECT ITs COLLECTIONS. : 
“Tn view of these changed conditions, the society has become very 
much concerned for the safety of its collections, and jealous lest, | 
by leaving them where they may some unfortunate day be irrepara- - 
bly destroyed, it should be judged unfaithful to the patriotic publig 
trust it has voluntarily assumed. 
“ But your memorialists on behalf of the Tennessee Historical So- 
ciety are compelled by necessity to say, and. héreby respectfully rep- 
resent, that the society is financially incapable of giving to its col- 
lections the care and protection which they ought, without question, . 
to have. Its resources, consisting of the dues of members and the 
jncome from a small bequest made to the society by the late Mr. 
M. H. Howard, amount to less than-three hundred dollars per an-~ 
num, and are more than exhausted by the necessary current ex~ 
penses for janitor and custodian service; for stationery, postage, 
and printing; for insurance; and in the purchase of one hundred: 
_copies of the American Historical Magazine, which are-used to ex- 
change with various historical and learned societies for their val- 
uable publications. It has not even funds to prosecute vigorously 
the work of collection, much less the means to build or rent a swit- 
able fireproof building or room in which to deposit its treasures 
and to maintain a public museum. For nearly twenty years it has 
accepted the generous hospitality of the Watkins Institute trustees ;
-P-A-G-E-513
—490— 
but, without prejudice to their public-spirited action in the circum~ 
stances, your memorialists respectfully submit that the best these 
gentlemen have to offer is insufficient to. meet the Present needs of 
the society. 
“APPEAL TO THE STATE FOR AID. 
“ Clearly the Tennessee Historical Society, in order still to exercise 
due diligence in the care of its collections, must prosecute a deter- 
mined search in some direction for outside assistance. Such being 
the circumstances, the. society believes, and your memorialists are, 
instructed respectfully to represent to your honorable bodies, that. 
it is to the State of Tennessee that it should first look for aid in 
caring for these objects which it has collected out of regard for the 
history of the State, and which are, and will continue to be, of more 
historical and sentimental interest to the people of this State than. 
_ to any one else: 
““ Therefore your memorialists, in behalf of the Tennessee Histor- 
ical Society, respectfully memorialize and petition your honorable 
bodies. — 
_. “THE CoLLections OFFERED TO THE STATE. 
“ First, to take and*hold the collections which the sgciety now has: 
and hereafter, from time to time, may accumulate; caring for and 
preserving them as like objects, the property of the State, are cared 
for and preserved ; cataloguing and filing them in the same manner 
as its own archives are catalogued and filed; exhibiting certain il- 
lustrative and instructive documents in the collection in a public 
historical and archeological museum; and allowing the access of- 
proper parties to them under suitable precautions, ‘distinguishing 
them from its own only by some characteristic mark which shall. 
indicate the.relation of the Historical Society to them—a relation 
in which the society does, and ever will, take great pride. : 
“ On its part the Tennessee Historical Society offers freely to turn 
over its collections to the State to hold-in trust and perpetual de- 
posit as soon as the State shall provide a suitable fireproof deposi- 
tory and museum and a State archivist properly authorized to re- 
ceive them. and to act as custodian of them.

“On its part, further, the Tennéssee Historical Society desires 
and intends that, should it ever dissolve, its collections should be- 
come the property of the State.in full ownership; and if, in order 
properly to accomplish this, any legislation amendatory of its char- 
- ter.should be thought necessary, it stands ready to accept heartily 
all such changes. 
“The society desires to maintain its organization and activity, be- 
lieving that there will be work for it to do within the scope of its 
‘purpose, as expressed in its charter, and desiring to be engaged and 
have. a part-in the work of promoting knowledge of the history..of 
the State of Tennessee and cultivating pride and interest * therela 
among the present and the future. generations, 
“But your memorialists believe that in asking your “honorable 
bodies to make provision for the acceptance.of the collections of: the 
Tennessee Historical Society in trust on the conditions indicated, 
" they are not asking all that, as public-spirited citizens, it is at this :

TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL For THE BLIND, 
NASHVILLE, TENN., June 19, 1906. 
&. A. Mynders, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nash- 
ville, Tenn. 7 
Dezar Siz: Another year has passed into oblivion, leaving memo- 
ries of joys and sorrows, the wreck of shattered hopes and bitter 
disappointments; and yet, while our highest expectations have not 
been realized, sufficient good has been accomplished to command our 
love and thanks to Almighty God for his ever watchful care and 
guidance. 
The school, following’ Nature’s law, is slow and gradual in its 
growth. ‘Tied to the past by prejudice and ignorance, it is hard to 
break away, to seize upon new ideals and to hew new paths in fields 
of knowledge hitherto unexplored, which might be profitable to the 
blind in this busy, practical, everyday world. 
There are some questions connected with the education of the 
blind which are receiving very serious consideration and which may 
change or modify our present system; but I shall hold to the belief 
that the higher and broader the education, the larger will be the 
blind man’s world and the greater and more numerous will be his 
opportunities. It is true that the majority cannot attain to higher 
education, but nearly all can take the grammar-school course, which 
is a good English education. All can be trained in morality, in 
right living, and in right thinking, and all may be taught to use 
their hands skillfully in the employments now practiced in the 
school. 
I regret that our poverty precludes the addition of the Sloyd sys- 
tem to our manual training department. I trust that the time is 
not far distant when this very useful system can be introduced. 
A printing press, which has become almost an indispensable ad- 
junct to large schools, would be of great service to.us in saving time 
of pupils by printing lessons, music, and extracts that would be so 
helpful, and which cannot be obtained in embossed books.
-P-A-G-E-516
~—493— 
The gymnasium, which was almost destroyed by fire, has been 
rebuilt and equipped. 
A workshop containing four large rooms has been built, the main 
building has been repaired and painted, and the grounds improved, 
all of which facilitate work and add much to the comfort of the 
pupils. 
On September 19 there were in attendance one hundred and sev- 
enty white pupils and twenty-nine colored pupils. On December 
19 there were one hundred and eighty-eight white pupils and thirty 
colored pupils. Fifty-eight new children have been admitted this 
session, thirty of these being under twelve years of age. Total en- 
rollment for the year, two hundred and thirty-eight. About twenty 
returned home with vision sufficiently improved to attend seeing 
schools. . 
‘The health of the school for the session just ended has been re- 
markably good, not a single case of diphtheria, mumps, measles, 
and kindred diseases common with children having appeared. One 
death has occurred, the first in four years. The Board:of Health 
placed this institution fully abreast with the best institutions in the 
State for health, drainage, sanitation, and hygiene. 
The progress and success of the colored school has been remark- 
ably good. Order and discipline have been strictly maintained, and 
work mapped out for schoolroom and shop has been fully carried 
out. Two girls graduated from this department, receiving gram- 
mar-school certificates. , 
“Since Congress granted free mailage for embossed matter, every 
school for the blind has become a circulating library. The library 
of this school consists of over three thousand volumes, and is 
drawn upon by the blind of the State. We are almost daily receiv- 
ing ‘requests for books. 
The usual quarterly examinations and the final examination were 
held, with results most gratifying, the excellent marks showing close 
appligation to study and a good understanding of the branches pur- 
sued. Five graduates received grammar-school certificates. 
The annual declaratory contest for medals was held by the boys 
on May.23, 
 
-P-A-G-E-517
—494— 
o-Qn the evening of May 31 the band gave a recital. 
The girls’ contest in expression for medals took place on June 1. 
,:On Sunday, June 3, the closing ‘sermon was delivered by Rev. 
F.-S..Parker, D.D. : : 
- A-musical and literary | entertainment was given by the interme- 
diate pupils on June 4, 
"On the afternoon of June 5 the primary pupils gave ‘their enter- 
tainment, and the closing exercises were held on Wednesday even- 
ing, June 6... : 
* According to your request, I subjoin an account of the early at- 
fenipt at the education of the blind anda brief history of this school. 
While some individuals among the blind have in all ages ‘mas- 
tered the learning of their day and attained distinction in letters; 
mathematics, and philosophy, yet it does not appear that the idea 
of making a provision for their education as a class entered into 
the minds of either Greeks or Romans. They procured a precarious 
subsistence by begging by the wayside or at the entrance of the 
temple ; but there was no one who could teach them more honorable 
theans of obtaining a livelihood or rescue them from the insupera- 
Ble evils connected with a life of mendicancy; nor amid the noble 
and philanthropic reforms introduced by Christianity was there any 
Provision made for the training and instruction of the blind. They 
begged on as before, though now frequenting the doors of Christian 
churches instead of heathen temples, and asking alms in the name 
of Christ instead of Aisculapius and Isis. 
* The first real effort to educate the blind was made by Abbe Hauy, 
in Paris, in 1784. Abbe Hauy was the inventor of the émbossed 
alphabet. About 1790, schools for the blind were established in 
Liverpool, Edinburgh, and many other points in a short time after- 
wards. These schools were especially designed to teach some em- 
ployment whereby blind persons might earn a livelihood. Reading 
and a little music were taught, but nothing of a higher character 
either in literature or music was attempted. 
It was not until 1832 that schools for the blind were established
-P-A-G-E-518
—495— 
in this country. Dr. John Fisher, of Boston, while in Paris, visited 
the Institution for the Blind, and was so impressed by its success 
‘that, on his return home in 1829, he secured a charter from the 
Legislature empowering him and his associates to establish a school 
for the instruction of the blind. Dr. Samuel G. Howe was selected 
to take charge of the enterprise. He at once went to Europe to 
study methods of instruction, and upon his return, in 1832, a 
school, with six children, was opened in Boston. In the same year 
Dr. Russ opened one in New York, and in the following year a sis- 
ter school was established in Philadelphia by Dr. Freelander. 
These are called the pioneer schools, and from them all others have 
sprung. 
‘A little more than a decade elapsed from the time | schools for the 
blind were established in New. York and Boston, when .a similar 
school was founded in Nashville, Tenn., by Rev. James Champlin, 
a blind gentleman. Mr. Champlin instructed a few children, gave 
exhibitions before the public, and a final exhibition of the attain- 
ments of his pupils before the Legislature caused that body to adopt 
this school as a State institution and make an appropriation for its 
support by an Act passed on January 29, 1844. From this time 
until 1852 the progress of the school was necessarily slow, and few 
pupils were in attendance. . 
_ In this year Mr. J. M. Sturtevant, a man of much ability, took © 
charge of the school, and through his efforts appropriations from 
the Legislature were secured, the number of pupils increased, the 
interest of the public was aroused, and it steadily advanced until 
closed by the Civil War. It was reopened in 1867, and was cat- 
ried on in rented buildings until 1873, when it moved into its Pres: 
ent home. 
In 1872 Judge John M. Lea made his first visit to the school 
which was then conducted in a vented building. He saw how-de- 
pendent, helpless boys and girls were metamorphosed. into bright, 
hopeful, happy, independent men and women. .This was a revela- - 
tion to him. His heart was touched, and his sympathy was thor- 
‘gughly aroused. His wife warmly entered into his. plans with an 
enthusiasm equal to his own, and soon the elegant residence of Mr.
-P-A-G-E-519
—4196— 
Claiborne, with its spacious grounds, was purchased by Judge Lea, 
and by him conveyed to the State for the sole use of the School for 
the Blind. : 
From time to time appropriations have been made by the Legis- 
lature to enlarge the old buildings and to erect new- ones. .T'wo 
‘ hundred pupils can now be accommodated in the school. 
More than sixty years ago the good people of the State felt that 
right and justice demanded that some provision must be’ made 
whereby blind children may have an opportunity to obtain an edu- 
cation. . They reasoned that if education is essential to the welfare 
and success of the child blessed with the greatest of all blessings— 
the sense of sight—then it is a thousand times more necessary that 
the blind be educated and fitted for the battle of life. Think for 
a moment of the pathetic and pitiable condition of the blind who 
are uneducated. Cut off from most of the amusements and pleas- 
. ures of youth; a burden to their friends for their daily bread; led © 
from place to place, perhaps by unwilling hands; objects of pity, 
and sometimes of aversion; their untutored minds and rude man- 
ners made the subject of jest and ridicule; without hope and seem- 
ingly forgotten of Heaven, their lot is indeed lamentable and miser- 
able beyond description! But education changes all this; the light 
of knowledge fills the soul, quickens the perceptions, exercises’ the 
, faculties, unfolds and develops man’s entire nature, and thus the 
blind. man becomes the equal of his more fortunaté brothers and 
sisters. But that is not all; it refines the manners, does away with 
oddities and peculiarities; it encourages hope, awakens ambition, 
and teaches him. to earn his bread and to know what independence 
means. 
This school is a part of the public-school system. - All children 
from six years of age to twenty-one who are totally or partially blind 
and who cannot be educated in the ordinary schools are entitled to 
a scholarship in this ‘school. 
Manual training, which has recently been introduced in many 
of the public schools and has been found of so much practical ben- 
efit to their pupils, has formed one of the most important depart- 
_ ments of this school from its establishment. Here boys learn the
-P-A-G-E-520
—497— 
use of tools, to tune pianos, make hammocks, brooms, mattresses, 
and to cane chairs; while the girls learn to sew, to cut and make 
their own clothes, and also to fashion many. fancy articles in 
worsted, raffia, and beads. 
The school is carefully graded, comprising twelve grades, em- 
bracing primary, grammar, and high-school departments. The 
course is similar to that pursued in the best public schools. In the 
Musical Department the pupils are thoroughly instructed in piano, 
' pipe organ, and vocal music, and also in theory and harmony. 
As so many of the children come to us weak, awkward, and poorly 
developed, we find it-very beneficial to give them careful and sys- 
tematic physical training; for a strong, wholesorhe, and well-devel- 
oped body is the prime requisite in a successful development of the 
intellect. A physical-culture teacher is, therefore, employed, arid _ 
combines with this physical training the art of correct reading, or’ 
elocution.. This field opens to the blind great opportunities. The 
well-trained speaker can always find an audience. The church, the 
bar, and the forum are open to him. Tlustrious blind men -have 
shown the way. Sir John Fielding, chief justice of England ; Hon. 
Henry Fawcett, member of parliament and postmaster general 
when Mr. Gladstone was premier; and our own Dr. Milburn, chap- 
lain of the United. States Senate, are surely instances sufficient to 
show what blind men can do when trained and educated. 
The instruction given in schools for the blind aims, first, at the 
general cultivation of the intellectual faculties. They are after- 
wards taught some art, which may enable them to provide 1 for their 
. subsistence, - : 
‘In the case of persons destitute of sight it is necessary to have 
recourse to the other senses to supply the want of the eyes. Knowl- _ 
edge obtained in this way must, of course, be acquired much more 
slowly than that received-by the sight. The senses of touch and 
sight differ in this respect—the former ascends by. degrees from 
the perception of the part to the perception of the whole, while the 
latter views the whole at a single glance. It is, therefore, evident 
that the blind cannot be instructed in some branches in the common 
_ Schools.’ In’the first place, because the means of instruction by
-P-A-G-E-521
—498— 
touch are wanting; and, secondly, because the progress of the other 
* ehildren would be retarded wherever color, light and shade, draw- 
ing, pictures, and operations with the blackboard are brought into 
use. But in departments purely intellectual—such as mathematics, 
_ philosophy, and language—they are the equal of their seeing breth- 
ten, and have often secured the highest prizes in our most famous 
universities. Nevertheless, as the blind form no small part of the 
population of every country, particular institutions have necessarily 
been established for their instruction. For many years most of the 
teaching in schools for the blind was oral, this being a necessity 
from lack of text-books. 
A number of systems of print for the blind were invented, but 
the first to merit recognition was that by Dr. Howe, in 1836. This 
was gradually introduced into the schools of this country. This 
system was the alphabet used by the seeing, raised. But it was not 
satisfactory, as it could not be written, and but few of the adult 
blind could read it. 
Louis Braille, a-blind gentleman, invented the system which bears 
his name. This system consists of six dots, or points, arranged in 
two vertical rows of three points each, and by the omission of one 
or more of these points sixty-two different and distinct signs are 
formed, which represent the entire alphabet, the Arabic numerals, 
marks of punctuation, prefixes, suffixes, contractions, and numerous 
word signs, as well as a complete system of musical notation. Its 
superiority lies in the fact that it is more tangible than the raised 
letter—it can be written and it can be read by old and young. 
From this other systems have been constructed—-namely, American. 
Braille and New York Point. These two systems are now used ‘in 
all American schools. Since these systems have. come into such 
prominence, the printing press has not ceased day or night, ahd 
it is estimated that we have to-day one hundred and ten thousand 
volumes in schools and in libraries, public and private. Text-books 
in embossed print (the same as those used in seeing schools) and 
tangible writing have miade the instruction in schools for the blind 
correspond in general to that given in schools for the seeing. 
- As we have no kindergarten, when young children enter this
-P-A-G-E-522
—499—. 
school, they are placed in the Primary Department, which consists 
of the first and second grades. Here they are taught to read and 
write.and combine numbers, orally and on. their slates, and to re- 
‘produce selections read by their teacher. In the third and succeed- 
ing grades our text-books and method of instruction are similar to 
that in seeing schools. i 
Classes in this school must of necessity be smaller than in other 
schools, never, if possible, numbering more than fifteen or twenty 
students. The opportunities of the bljnd being few and. circum- 
scribed and being barred from most pursuits, his‘ training: should . 
‘be very careful and thorough. An education that is not practical, 
that does not train the hands of the blind child, as well as the mind, 
: to some useful occupation whereby a living can be earned, is almost 
a crime. 
The following shows what eduestion is to the blind. In 1878 
an exhaustive census of the graduates from all the schools for the 
blind in the United States was compiled. Sixteen became superin- 
tendents of institutions; two hundred became teachers or were oth- 
erwise employed in institutions; thirty-four, ministers of the gos- 
pel; eighty-four, authors, publishers, or lecturers; three hundred _ 
and ten engaged as teachers of music or were vocalists; sixty- 
nine, organists in churches; one hundred and twenty-five, piano 
tuners; nine hundred and thirty-seven, teachers, employees, and 
workers in handicraft; two hundred and seventy-seven, storekeep- 
ers; forty-five, real estate; seven hundred and sixty (mostly 
women), employed at home work. 
It is pleasant to reflect upon what has been done to ameliorate 
the condition of the blind. Years ago their education was.some- 
thing unmentioned and unknown; total physical darkness’ threw 
a gloom over the intellectual and moral life of its victim; if alms: 
were given, his body was comforted, but no hand extended lasting 
aid ; the sufferings of his mind were beyond relief; whether at home . 
a drone or abroad a wandering beggar, existence was alike weari- 
some to himself and a burden to others; had he once been a com- 
panion of princes, his fall was none the less. abject, only more bit-: 
ter; though free, the dungeon was still about him, so narrow that ~
-P-A-G-E-523
—500— 
its impenetrable walls were just beyond his reach; not a familiar 
face, no work of art, not one enchanting scene of nature, was open 
to his view. But now, though still shut out from the light of day 
—in a prison from which cunning nor giant efforts can ever set” 
him free—he may yet feel that he is a man scarcely less blessed 
than his fellows. He may seek work instead of alms; his hands, 
aided by invention, supply, in part, the want of sight; the eager 
ear performs a double task, and the bewitching treasures of knowl~ 
edge fly open to his touch if legislative wisdom or private munifi- 
cence can afford ‘a golden key. Respectfully submitted,

UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
The desire for education was evident at an early period in the 
history of Middle Tennessee. The sentiment which has since made 
Nashville so prominent in all educational matters took practical 
shape in December, 1785, when the Legislature of North Carolina 
was asked for a charter for Davidson Academy, and which it 
granted because “the good education of youth has the most direct 
tendency to promote the virtue, increase the wealth, and extend the 
fame of any people; and because it is the indispensable duty of 
every Legislature to consult the happiness of a rising generation and 
endeavor to fit them for an honorable discharge of the social duties 
of life.” oO 
During the following summer Davidson Academy was opened, 
with Rev. Thomas B. Craighead. as president, a few miles north of 
Nashville, on ground owned by Mr. Craighead, and the rate of tui- 
. tion was fixed at five pounds “hard money.” A list of text-hooks, 
which is in the archives of the Tennessee Historical Society, indi- 
cates a rather advanced course of study, and also shows that the 
books were owned by the academy. 
The institution became Cumberland College in 1809, and Dr.

James Priestly, of Kentucky, was elected its head. It became the 
University of Nashville in 1824, under the presidency of Dr. Philip 
' Lindsley, of New Jersey, who remained in office. until 1850. The 
uniyersity struggled on with small attendance and very limited re- 
sources until 1855, when the academic department became, under 
Gen. Bushrod Johnson, a military school of great popularity and 
efficiency, which was broken up by the Civil War. The buildings 
‘were then occupied by the Montgomery Bell Academy from 1867 
until the organization of the Peabody College for Teachers in 1874, 
to whose purposes they have since been dedicated, the Montgomery 
Bell Academy meanwhile having been provided with another build- 
‘ing on the same grounds, : : 
The Medical Department of the Univerkity, which was organized 
in 1850 ahd held its first commencement in 1852, has had a career 
of prosperity uninterrupted only by the war of 1861-1865, and, in 
' fact, for many years constituted the only living member of the 
institution. 
The university is practically without endowment, except a small 
sum left by Valerius P. Winchester, of Tennessee, for the estab- 
lishment of a chair of modern languages, which, supplemented by 
the university funds, maintains that chair in the Peabody College. 
The university as now constituted has the following departments: 
1. The Peabody College for Teachers, which includes the Win- 
throp Model School. : . 
2. The Medical College.

PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 
_, The year 1905-1906 has been full of encouragement to the friends 
of Peabody College. With a teaching force larger than in former 
years, working harmoniously over a wider field of effort than here- 
tofore, the college now offers greater opportunities for the larger 
culture and training of teachers than ever. 
In order that any institution may do its work efficiently, there 
must, be unity i in its organization. The law of an organization is to 
be found in its purpose. The purpose of Peabody College is to equip 
its students for the profession of teaching and to emphasize the im- 
- portance of dignity of school work; to give its students a scholar- 
ship and culture that shall be recognized everywhere as equivalent 
to that of one holding a bachelor’s degree from a university, and 
also-to show how knowledge is of specific value as it ministers to 
the art of teaching; to make enough of scholarship and intellectual 
culture to satisfy the growing demand of the strongest students who 
look forward to an educational career where the higher and better 
possibilities of a vocation are assured; to so teach the general doc- 
trine of instruction and school management as not to destroy in its 
graduates the power and habit of initiative. ; 
Since the college holds that the teacher must have a high order of 
both academic and professional equipment, this dual preparation of 
the teacher becomes the purpose and law of its organization. Both 
the academic and professional departments of the college have been 
conducted during the last year by specialists and experts of superior 
ability and skill. A broader preparation is demanded of those ap- 
plying for admission to the college than in former years. This 
raising of the standard for entrance has given us a student body bet- 
ter equipped than heretofore for doing efficient and more advanced 
work, 
When Dr. Barnas Sears, the first general agent of the Peabody 
Board, was, in 1875, seeking a suitable location for the institution 
which has become the most important of those fostered by the fund, 
he announced to the Governor of Tennessee: “I have visited every 
State capital and every important town in the South, and have:
-P-A-G-E-526
—503— 
decided that Nashville is the place for the Teachers’ College.” And 
this institution, then and there established, has ever had as its ideal 
the aim for which it was founded. How far it has realized’ this 
aim is evident by the number of students that have come under 
its impress, by the wide extent of territory that it has constantly 
.ministered to, and by the quality of service rendered by its grad- 
uates., . 
a This college, with a few exceptions, i is the only one of note in 
the | South not dominated either by a State. or by a denomination. 
And to have connected the teachers’ college, with. a State institution 
would have localized it and have given it a State horizon. To have 
connected it with a denominational institution would. have - es- 
tranged, many people and have minimized its ‘influence i in spite of 
all. the physical advantages that such a coalition might seem to have 
offered. Here, from the beginning, students in large numbers from 
all the Southern States have freely mingled with a common pur: 
pose. Here Protestants, Jews, and Catholics have. found a con- 
genial college home; and out of this complex life there has grown a 
common ideal that has been destructive of provincialism and illib- 
erality. And if the college is still to make the greatest possible con- 
tribution to the larger life of the South, that the South in tum 
may contribute positively to the life of the nation, this freedom and 
this atmosphere must be preserved.” 
_ Since its foundation the enrollment by States, outside of Tennes-, 
see and other States not here enumerated, has been: For Arkansas, 
477; Alabama, 546; Florida, 210; Georgia, 809; Louisiana; 369; 
Mississippi, 459 ; North Carolina,-502; South Carolina, 384; Texas, 
626; Virginia, 588; West Virginia, 264; Kentucky, 72. Now, if 
we remember that the teacher belongs, of necessity, to a migratory 
_ population, and if we then add to the above numbers the nearly 
equal number from Tennessee and other States, we realize how 
vitally: ‘this army of twelve thousand young men and young women, 
going forth quietly year after year all over this Southern country, 
into each nook and corner, to spend themselves in service, has af- 
fected. directly or indirectly the life of every community in the 
South. - 
   
-P-A-G-E-527
. To-day Peabody graduates are presidents of colleges, of State 
normal schools, of State industrial institutions; professors of uni- 
versities and colleges, superintendents of county and city schools, 
principals and teachers of high schools, widely scattered throughout 
the “ Peabody territory.” They are likewise prominent in the fac- 
ulties of the normal or industrial schools of the States of Virginia, 
West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, - 
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas; yet the supply has 
never equaled the widespread demand. In fact, the demand for 
them is so great and within the past two or three years has so in- 
creased that it has become necessary to provide some agency which 
will bring together those who need professionally trained teachers 
and-those who seek positions. This is now done by a bureau of in- 
formation which is under the supervision of the “Committee of 
Appointments,” consisting of three members of the faculty, and the 
whole time of a salaried official of the college is required to transact 
the business.of the bureau. The bureau is not a teachers’ agency ; 
no commission is charged on the teacher’s salary, and there is no 
expense except a small amount intended to cover postage. More 
than five hundred applications for teachers have been received dur- 
ing the past summer, of which the bureau has been able to supply 
about one hundred and fifty. 
The attendance at the college during the past year is in excess 
of that of the previous. year, which is a surprise in view of the fact 
that many who applied for admission were unable to meet the re- 
quirements for entrance. The number of students last year, for 
the winter session, was 359; for the summer session, 284; in the 
Winthrop Model School, 305. At the winter session 69 received 
the Licentiate of Instruction diploma, 20 the degree of Bachelor 
of Arts, 9 the university degree of Bachelor of Science, and 1 the 
* degree of Bachelor of Letters. At the end of the summer session 
16 received the Licentiate of Instruction diploma and 1 the uni- 
versity degree of Bachelor of Science. Of the students attending 
the winter session, 79 were-men and 280 were women; at the sum- 
mer session, 77 were men and 161 were women. 
The attendance from the different States for the two sessions 
was:

  The summer session has long since become an important and val-

who cannot attend the winter session. 
I attach hereto the report of Dr. Little, superintendent of the 
summer session for 1906. , 
NASHVILLE, TENN., October 27, 1906. 
President James D. Porter, Nashville, Tenn. . 
Dear Sir: I beg to submit the following report of the fifth sum- 
mer session of the Peabody College for Teachers. The quantity 
and quality of work done in this séssion surpass those of any pre- 
vious summer, whether measured by our faculty and the number 
of courses given and the high standing of both, or measured by the -
-P-A-G-E-529
—506— 
large student-body and their excellence. A harmonious and zeal- 
‘ous faculty has done much to inspire the students to faithful “and 
even brilliant work, but-the students themselves have in turn ‘in- 
spired the instructors to higher efficiency. Never has a summer 
of all our five sessions.seen such rich results from both: sides— 
from instructors and those instructed. 
From the first the college has worked toward this end, and now 
the satisfaction is experienced of seeing some of its aim fulfilled. 
The summer session. is neither.a Chautauqua for indulging in the 
pleasures of literature. and. art, nor.an institute for putting tem- 
porary props under incompetent teachers, nor‘an overgrown edu- 
cational rally for dispensing really choice oratory. and lectures to 
dazed listeners who need systematic work in the fundamentals. By 
a wise choice and combination of. these several aims the college has 
produced here a type of. summer school with solid content and per- 
manent effect. This. recognition is so generally conceded to the 
eollege that everywhere throughout the South its reputation stands — 
for thoroughness and breadth of opportunity for summer students, 
particularly teachers. 
“ Tennessee, of course, reaped the largest benefit this summer from 
the work of the’ college, as 197 students out of an enrollment of 
285 were from Tennessée. It is a source of gratification. that the 
State is so fully compensated year after year for its very generous 
" arid uniform interest in the welfare of the college. While hunareds 
go out each year to recruit permanently the teaching force of the 
South and lend a progressive nucleus to the entire mass of educa- 
tional work, the college contributes a continuous stream of teach- 
ers to Tennessee, its home. Respectfully submitted, 
. . Cranes HE. Lirris, 
Superintendent of Summer Session. 
THE WINTHROP MODEL SCHOOL. 
- This school was established in 1890, in a building erected by the 
trustees of the Peabody Fund on the college campus, and in the de-
-P-A-G-E-530
==50T— 
‘sign and construction of which every precaution was taken to’ se- 
cure good light and ventilation, proper temperature, and perfect 
adaptation to the purposes for which it was to be used. From the 
opening day it has been practically full, although it has room for 
over three hundred pupils. The pupils have during schéol hours 
free use of the college campus, sixteen acres in area, for Yecreation, 
and are, in addition, required to take thirty minutés? daily work 
in the college gymnasium under the instruction’ of the college 
teacher. 
. ” Daily instruction in vocal choral music is given, by the professor 
of. that department in the college, and members of the college staff 
frequently give instructions on special subjects to. _the pupils. 
ere are six regular teachers, most of them graduates of the éol- 
lege, i in the Model School, and it has been under the successfull and 
efficient management of Miss A. G. Glover as principal since 1893. 
The school proper has eight grades corresponding in a general 
way to the grades in primary studjes in the public schools. For 
the benefit of pupils who desire to take the college course later, 
but more especially to meet the needs of some students who, wholly 
or in part, fail to pass the examination required for entrance to 
the college, two grades of secondary work were addéd to the courses 
of the school five years ago. These grddes have given opportunity 
to many teachers unable to take work in the college to review studies . 
and to observe methods of teaching. ‘ 
The enrollment of pupils for the scholastic year of 1905- 1906— 
305—was largely from the suburbs of Nashville, suburban towns, 
many from other parts of Tennessee; and not a few fromi other 
Southern States. As the school is maintained by the college, it is 
not dependent upon tuition receipts; its principal, therefore, is in 
position to reject applicants whovhave not satisfactory records in 
proficiency and deportment, the standard in both cases being very 
high. 
In the first, second, and third grades, reading and its related sub- 
jects—language, spelling, phonics and writing, arithmetic, litera- 
tare in the form of stories read and told, and poems, analyzed and 
memorized—are taught. Provision is made for nature study, ob-
-P-A-G-E-531
—508— 
servational geography, and form study, and for the latter in vari- 
ous forms of hand work—sewing, paper cutting and folding, card- 
board construction, cord work, weaving, plaiting in raffia, and clay 
modeling. 
In the fourth grade are taught: Language—Study of verse and 
prose; punctuation and capitalization ; letter writing and element- 
ary principles. Geography—First use of text-book; home geog- 
raphy (including study of nature); the earth as a whole; map 
making. Arithmetic (mental and written)—Drill in notation and 
numeration; simple work in fractions; form study. Reading— 
Grade reading, together with the reading of poems and stories. 
Spelling (oral and written)—Exercises in meaning of words; dic- 
tation exercises. Geography (second year)—A full study of North 
America; home geography, including nature study. Arithmetic— 
Decimals ; factors, measures, multiples; common fractions. Spell- 
ing (oral and written)—Pronunciation, syllabification, and phonic 
-analysis ; frequent and intelligent use of the dictionary. 
In the fourth and fifth grades, manual training—Basketry ; raf- 
fia, rattan; weaving; yarn, cord; hammock making; burnt wood ; 
wood carving, carpentry; clay modeling. 
The work is developed throughout the sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades, making a school of observation in which the students in the 
college supplement their study by familiarity with methods in actual 
use. College students in the Department of Education have for 
years visited the Model School for practical work, under the obser- 
vation of expert, critical teachers. 
THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 
The Medical College of the University of Nashville was estab- 
lished in 1850, largely through the efforts of Dr. Jobn Berrien 
Lindsley, who maintained all his life active connection with the 
educational, and especially with the medical and sanitary, affairs 
of Nashville and Tennessee. The necessity for a school of -medi- 
cine and surgery to be located at a point accessible to students from

—509— 
the Southern and Southwestern States and to -be conducted on a 
plane that would correspond with the position even then held by 
the medical faculty of the South was immediately demonstrated. 
- One hundred and twenty students were enrolled the first year; 
and although the medical colleges at Philadelphia and Louisville, 
then well known and popular throughout the Union, had behind 
them years of prestige and experience, with: much advantage in the 
way of clinic and material from which to draw instructors, the 
new ‘school maintained its high standing from the beginning. 
Many of its instructors have been men of national reputation, and 
their work as teachers has usually’ been marked by earnestness and 
success. : 
The.total niimber of alumni (1906) is about 4,700. The -num- - 
ber of graduates during the year 1906 was 58, and the number it 
attendance was 443, from twenty-one States and foreign countries; 
12 postgraduates were enrolled. The six States contributing the 
greatest number were, respectively: Tennessee, 128; Mississippi, 
85; Alabama, 58; Louisiana, 51; Texas, 28; Arkansas, 22. — 
The college enjoys clinical privileges at the City Hospital, St. 
Thomas Hospital, and at the Woman’s Hospital, all of Nashville, 
in addition to those of the University Free Dispensary, which is 
open throughout the entire year. 
The session comprises two terms of six months each—the fall 
and spring terms. Attendance upon either term entitles the stu- 
dent to a time credit of one year. A complete course of instruction 
is given during each term. Final examinations are held at the 
close of each term—in March and June, respectively. 
The student may elect to begin an official course either in: Octo- 
ber or in January. At the close of each term tickets are issued 
-in accordance with the regulations of the Southern Medical As- 
sociation, of which the institution is a member. There must be 
an interval of eleven months between the beginning of one course 
and the beginning of the next succeeding course. 
: The required time of study for the degree of Doctor of Medicine 
is four years. 
Every student applying for matriculation must hold a certificate 
from some reputable physician testifying to his character and his ~
-P-A-G-E-535
-—510— 
fitness to enter the study of medicine, and a diploma of graduation 
from some literary or scientific institution, or a certificate from 
some recognized high school, State or county superintendent of in- 
struction, showing that the applicant possesses at least the educa- 
tional attainments required of the first-grade teachers of the public 
school. . 
Students having attended two courses elsewhere are admitted to 
the third year upon passing satisfactory examinations here, or upon- 
proof of having passed the required examinations in schools for- 
merly attended. , 
There are in the college eleven professors and twelve assistants, 
-The curriculum embraces twenty-five lecture courses and seven full 
laboratory courses. In the laboratories of clinical microscopy, bac- 
tericlogy, and pathology, junior students are thoroughly prepared 
for bedside clinics in the City Hospital; in the senior year, under. 
the supervision of associate professors of practice. In the second- 
year course analysis of adulterated and impure foods receives the 
attention that such an important subject demands. 
. The laboratory courses include those of chemistry, anatomy, his- 
tology, pathology, bacteriology, clinical microscopy, and operative 
surgery. . . 
The courses of lectures include: Materia medica, therapeutics, 
and clinical medicine; obstetrics; diseases of women and abdomi- 
nal surgery; diseases of the eye, ear, throat, and nose; chemistry; 
pathology, bacteriology, and hygiene; principles and practice of sur- 
gery; practice of medicine, clinical medicine, and nervous diseases ; 
physiology; anatomy ; operative surgery ; diseases of children ; medi- 
eal jurisprudence; hospital facilities and clinical instruction; dis- 
‘pensary and outdoor clinics. 
The museum of the college is one of the most complete in the. 
South. ; For more than fifty years it has been the depository for. 
rare specimens by distinguished surgeons and physicians who have 
been connected with-the school. It contains models found in but 
few museums in America, and is, therefore, a source of valuable in- 
struction to the students of medicine. Among these are the re- 
markable models of the entire arterial and venous system, made by 
Dr. Thomas B. Buchanan while professor of anatomy.

MONTGOMERY BELL ACADEMY. 
_ In 1856 Montgomery Bell, who came from Kentucky to Ten- — 
nessee at an early date and made a large fortune in the manufacture 
of iron, died, leaving to the trustees of the University of Nashville 
a “bequest of twenty thousand dollars for the establishment and 
maintenance of an academy for the gratuitous education of twenty- 
five boys, This fund was invested in Tennessce bonds, and handled 
so judiciously by Mr. Dempsey Weaver, of Nashville, that in 1867, 
wher, the trustees of the university were in position to consider car- 
tying out Mr. Bell’s wishes, the fund was materially incréased, and 
the school was established with a broader plan and a fuller course of 
study than Mr. Bell had stipulated for; but he had wisely allowed: 
the trustees much discretion in the branches to be taught. : 
‘In the selection of the boys to be taught, preference was to be 
given to residents of Davidson, Montgomery, Williamson, and Dick- 
_ son Counties; and the Montgomery Bell committee of the trustees, 
to whoin the management of the academy is intrusted, usually in- 
sert. notices in the newspapers of those counties, asking for appli- 
cations for the scholarships. In making appointments from David- 
son County, preference is given to boys who live outside of Nash- 
ville and cannot attend the city schools. Under the rule of the 
committee, a pupil who does not pass his grades and show an appre- 
- ciation of the value of his scholarship loses it, and’ another is ap- 
_ pointed. : . 
In order to enable the principal to maintain a full-corps of. in-
-P-A-G-E-537
-—512— 
structors and offer an extended curriculum, in which the twenty- 
five scholarship boys participate, a number of pay pupils are re- 
ceived in the school. 
For the year 1905-1906 the instructors numbered six and the 
pupils one hundred and twelve. The school is equipped with a 
well-selected library, philosophical and chemical apparatus, a good 
selection of minerals and geological specimens, and spacious play- 
grounds. 
All the departments usually taught in first-class academies of 
similar scope are given, including modern languages, elocution, 
bookkeeping, commercial law, etc.; in fact, every branch which may 
be useful to boys preparing to enter commercial life or prosecute 
their studies farther to enter college. The graduates of the school 
are admitted on the certificates of the principal to a number of 
Southern universities and colleges without examination. The 
Washington and Lee University, of Virginia, and the Tulane Uni- 
versity, of Louisiana, have given each a scholarship, and the Uni- ° 
versity of Tennessee has given three, to the academy. 
At the close of each quarter exercises are held illustrating class 
work; ‘on February 22, exercises commemorative of the day; and at 
the end of the second quarter, the public contest in elocution. Lec- 
tures on important subjects, illustrated by stereopticon views, are 
given the students, and much emphasis is given to elocution, which 
. 1s always taught by a competent instructor. 
Since its organization, in 1867, about two thousand pupils have 
received instruction in the Montgomery Bell Academy. It has been 
since 1886 under Mr. S. M. D. Clark as principal, who has main- 
tained for it a high reputation for thorough and honest work. , 
WATKINS INSTITUTE. 
  
Hon, 8. A. Mynders, Superintendent of Education. 
Dear Sir: The commissioners of Watkins Institute respectfully 
submit the following report:
-P-A-G-E-538
—513— 
This important educational institution was founded by Samuel 
Watkins, a benevolent and highly respected citizen of Nashville, 
who died in 1880, leaving by will the large sum of one hundred 
. thousand dollars for its establishment and maintenance. 
After the execution of his will and prior to his death, Mr. Wat- 
kins bought for thirty thousand dollars the eligible lot on the cor- 
ner of Church street and Sixth avenue, on which the buildings were 
subsequently erected by the commissioners. 
Mr. Watkins stated in his will that having, by a life of industry 
and economy, accumulated a relatively large estate, and having dur- 
ing his life endeavored to discharge his duty, he dispensed his ben- 
efactions with a proper sense of his obligations to society. He, 
therefore, gave the sum of one hundred thousand. dollars to the 
State. of Tennessee in trust for the establishment in the city of 
Nashville of this educational institute, to promote the diffusion of 
knowledge and to enable the youth of Nashville, who are without 
means, to attend schools and colleges where the higher branches of 
education are taught, to acquire information upon such subjects as 
will be beneficial in the business of life. 
He appointed as commissioners to carry out his purpose three 
lifelong friends—James Whitworth, John M. Lea, and William 
Cooper. He provided that as vacancies should occur the Governor 
of the State should make appointments, which were to be ratified 
by the Senate, and that the commissioners should never receive com- 
pensation for their services. 
In 1881 the State of Tennessee, by legislative enactment, ac- 
‘ cepted Mr. Watkins’ gift, and, in March, 1885, the buildings being 
completed, the Watkins Institute was formally opened and, with 
appropriate ceremonies, dedicated to the purposes contemplated by 
its benevolent founder. 
Fortunately, Mr. Watkins gave to the commissioners such wide 
discretion in administering the fund that it was clearly within their 
power to establish a free night school in the institute. It was 
opened in 1889, and from that time has had a career of great suc- © 
cess and usefulness. The average annual enrollment during this 
period has been about four hundred and fifty pupils, but the num- 
ber enrolled during the past year, 1905,-has been five hundred and
-P-A-G-E-539
—514— 
fifty-eight. Probably ninety per cent of the students are engaged 
all day in stores, shops, and factories, and would be unable to get 
an education without the assistance of this free night school. The 
remainder are young persons who need more advanced instruction” 
in. bookkeeping, stenography, typewriting, and similar branches 
than is given in the public schools, and are not able to pay tuition 
in regular commercial colleges. A notable element in the school 
is the number of young foreigners who learn here to speak, spell, 
and read English. Some of the students are not less than fifty 
years ‘of age, and many American men and women. twenty-five to 
thirty years old begin here to learn the alphabet and multiplica- 
tion table. This has been the case ever since the primary depart- 
ment has been organized. The work of the students when in the 
school is characterized by zeal and earnestness, and the commission- 
ers are satisfied that the benefits of the school are reaching the'class 
of people Mr. Watkins desired to help. 
The good accomplished by the school has attracted the attention 
of the public in a marked degree, and citizens of Nashville and other 
sections of the State are heartily approving the objects and methods 
of the school. 
Among other persons visiting the school, Mrs. Ann E. Webber, 
an estimable lady, of Nashville, who, like Mr. Watkins, had accu: 
mulated a considerable fortune by her own exertions, became in- 
terested in the school, and, after careful investigation, determined 
to devote the main portion of her fortune to aid this useful educa- 
tional’ and charitable institution. In 1902 she executed to the 
State of Tennessee a deed of conveyance in trust of two valuable 
storehouses in Nashville, the income from which she directed should 
‘be used in improving and increasing the usefulness of the Watkins 
Free Night School, in adding new. departments of instruction, in . 
lengthening the sessions of the school, and in supplying the school 
with typewriters, electrical apparatus, instruments for drawing, and 
otber means of technical instruction. Unfortunately for the school, 
the brothers and sister of Mrs. Webber, as her heirs, have claimed 
her estate and instituted legal proceedings in the chancery court at 
Nashville enjoining the commissioners from taking possession of
-P-A-G-E-540
~—515— 
the two storehouses, and these proceedings are now W pending hefore 
the supreme court for final adjudication. 
Meantime, with the increased rentals received and to be ‘received 
from the four storchouses and other buildings heretofore-erected 
‘by the commissioners, the school will be successfully: conducted and 
its usefulness from time to time increased. 
Prof. Alexander Fall, the superintendent of the achool, and our 
corps of teachers are persons of long and successful experience: in 
teaching, and we believe the Watkins Free Night School will com- © 
‘pare favorably with the best institutions of its class. The commis- 
sioners take pleasure in commending the efficient and earnest .ef- 
forts of the principal and teachers, nearly all of whom have béen _. 
connected with the school for years, and are devoted to théir duties

‘GENTLEMEN : According to the usual custom, I inclose to you a 
final report for the eighteenth session. 
"As heretofore, the school opened under favorable auspices on 
September 18, 1905, closing the first term of three months on De- / 
eember 8, 1905. 
The second term opened on January 1, 1906, and closed on March 
23, 1906, with very complete, satisfactory, and enjoyable exercises— 
music, essays, awarding of prizes, and distribution of rewards of 
merit. 
The enrollment for the session was very gratifying, the work was
-P-A-G-E-541
—516— 
exceedingly satisfactory, and the general percentages much better 
than any previous year in the history of the school, which is shown 
by the superintendent’s report attached hereto. 
The faculty of the school remained as formerly, with the excep- 
tion that Mrs. Charles J. Metz was placed in charge of the Primary: 
Department, vice Miss Porter, given leave of absence. 
* It gives me a great deal of pleasure to report to you that the 
order during the entire session has been exceptionally good, far 
better than in any previous session. :

MECHANICAL. AND ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. 
Instruction was given in mechanical and topographical drawing, 
structural geometry, applied trigonometry, mensuration, and dle- 
* mentary subjects leading to the study of civil engineering. 
The Society of Colonial Dames of Tennessee, which is doing 
much to encourage the study of American history, offers each year 
a prize of ten dollars in gold for the best essay on a historical sub- 
ject selected by that society. Mrs: Maggie L. Hicks, in memory of ©
-P-A-G-E-543
—518— 
her son, Alfred Hoyt Hicks, offered another prize of ten dollars in 
gold. This prize, known as the Alfred Hoyt Hicks prize, was pre- 
sented to the students who had been the most regular attendants 
during the entire session. We are informed that these prizes will 
be. continued. 
Just here permit me to say that it is with pleasure that I look 
forward to a much larger enrollnient and greater usefulness for the 
Watkins Institute Night School in the session which will open on 
September 17, and will embrace a separate and distinct department 
for bookkeeping, and, in addition thereto, a department for telegra- 
phy, also a department for telephony and electricity. 
I am quite sure the population of Greater Nashville fully realizes 
_ the usefulness and beneficial influence of this worthy benefaction 
of Mr, Samucl Watkins and Mrs. Ann E. Webber. The latter, we 
trust, will be available in the near future, and it is doubtless the 
intention of the commissioners, as soon as this “ consummation so 
devoutly to be wished ” is realized, to add materially to the equip- 
ment of the school by introducing other important departments. 
. Tnclosed please find consolidated report for the entire session, 
which I hope will be satisfactory ; and I trust that the acceptability 
of the work which has been accomplished will warrant the hope on 
the part of your superintendent and corps of teachers that we may 
be associated hereafter under the same harmonious relationship. 
, Respectfully, 
ALEXANDER Fat, 
Superintendent.

THE TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
This institution had its origin in legislation of the General As- 
sembly of Tennessee enacted by the Legislature of 1843-4, the 
Board of Trustees having been organized on July 27, 1844. The 
school.was opened for work in 1845, sixty-one years ago. 
Senator John Cocke, of Grainger County, was the moving spirit 
in the legislation establishing the school. His memory: as the 
founder of the institution, and thus of deaf-mute education in 
Tennessee, is still gratefully cherished. 
The original appropriation by the State was $1,000. This was
-P-A-G-E-545
—520— 
supplemented by private contributions of about $400, making 
$1,400 which the management had to carry on the school for the 
first session of five months, with an attendance of from six to nine 
pupils. ° . . 
The succeeding Legislature declined to make any appropriation 
for buildings, and there was fear for a time that the effort to es- 
tablish the school on a permanent basis would fail; but through 
the efforts of special agents appointed by the trustees, a sum 
amounting to several thousand dollars was contributed by the peo- 
ple of Knox County and adjacent counties for the erection, in 
1846, of the three-story brick building which now constitutes the 
east wing of the main building. 
Calvin Morgan, Esq., of Knoxville, had in the meantime donated 
to the school two acres of land, then just west of the limits of the 
town of Knoxville. ° 
"Thereafter the State made liberal appropriations from time to 
time, for the enlargement of the premises and the erection of new . 
buildings as needed, till a well-equipped and commodious insti- 
tution now stands well within the city limits, the premises being 
considered by many one of the most attractive places in the State. 
In 1881 a separate school for colored deaf mutes was organized 
in rented premises. Four years later the Legislature of the State 
appropriated money for the purchase of twenty-seven acres of land, 
containing suitable buildings for the colored department, located 
two miles east of Knoxville. Later a dairy for both departments 
was established here, where it is now conducted. 
It may be of interest in this connection and not inappropriate 
to mention the results of experience in the matter of raising alfalfa 
on quite heavy clay soil, as showing the adaptability of this won- 
derful food and soil-renewing plant to the climate and lands of 
“Tennessee. Five years ago a good stand of alfalfa was obtained 
on a small piece of ground—less than an acre. ‘T'wo years later a 
good stand was secured on several acres. In the sedson of 1905 
five cuttings of fine hay were realized, with six cuttings for the 
present year (1906), the yield averaging about a ton per acre per 
cutting. The feeding of this alfalfa as hay has resulted in im-
-P-A-G-E-546
—521— 
provement of quantity and quality of milk and of the condition 
of the stock. 
The boys of the colored department are instructed in dairy 
work, gardening, and shoemaking; and the girls are taught laun- 
dry work, sewing, and housework. : 
There are now 26 pupils in attendance at the colored department. 
The attendance of the main school, the white department, is 220 
at the present time. 
Without doubt there are yet many deaf children in our State 
who are growing up in ignorance and who ought'to be in school. 
I desire here to renew the plea made by me in former reports to 
the Department of Public Instruction for the State, asking teach- 
ers throughout the State to put the school in communication with 
any such children in their respective communities. 
The management of the school desires most earnestly that the 
deaf children of our great Cotmmonwealth shall share in the great 
educational advancement now being made in Tennessee through 
her, public-school system. To that end it is constantly sought to 
bring year by year a larger number of pupils within the benefits of 
the institution and to steadily advance the grade of the work of 
the school. 
The chief aim—the most ditficult part of the work of instruct- 
ing the deaf—is to give them the English language; to put, liter- 
ally, “in their hands” a means of communication with the world 
about them, that they may understand others and léarn from them, 
that they may have access to the field of knowledge through the 
printed page, that they may give expression to their own thoughts. 
In doing this we teach the common-school branches, including 
writing, arithmetic, geography, history, grammar, etc., so that the 
knowledge of pupils in these branches will compare favorably with 
that of their more fortunate hearing brothers and sisters in corre- ~ 
sponding grades. - 
A generous Commonwealth here makes provision for the free 
education of every deaf child in the State whose friends will take 
interest enough in the child’s welfare to see that the golden oppor- 
tunity is not lost or delayed till best results are impossible.
-P-A-G-E-547
—522— 
‘The method of instruction followed at this school is that of most 
of the State schools for the deaf throughout the country, and is 
known as the combined method. The oral method—instruction 
by means of speech and lip reading—is used with such pupils as 
profit most thereby, the others being taught manually, writing be- 
ing largely used with all. 
_ That they may become self-supporting and useful members of 
society, the pupils are taught to work, and they learn work by 
doing it. 
Excepting the cooking and washing, the pupils do a large part 
of the work necessary to carry on an institution containing over 
200 people. In addition to their household duties, the girls learn 
sewing, fancy needlework, etc. ‘The boys learn printing, carpen- 
try, and shoemaking. 
The living apartments of the small boys are separate from those 
of the larger boys, their home being known as the “ Little Boys’ 
Cottage.” : 
A well-constructed and well-equipped hospital building affords 
facilities for taking the best care of the sick and protection against 
contagious diseases. 
A first-class gymnasium has been in use for several years, with 
marked. beneficial effect upon the health, bearing, and strength of 
the pupils. : 
For -some years the school was “cramped i in the matter of chapel 
and assembly-hall room. This was remedied by the Fifty-fourth 
General Assembly of the State, which appropriated $5,500—the 
amount asked by the Board of Trustees—for the necessary addition 
to the old chapel building, which had been erected in 1881-2, when 
the attendance of pupils was less than half of what it now is. 
In freedom from serious sickness and from death thé school has 
been signally blessed during the past year, no death having oc- 
eurred among the pupils and but little sickness of a serious nature. 
Though in the great work of educating the youth of the State 
the Tennéssee Deaf and Dumb School can bear but a humble part,
-P-A-G-E-548
—523— 
the management, realizing the necessity, the helpfulness of its 
part of that work, is prosecuting it enthusiastically, hopefully. 
Very respectfully, 
Tuomas L. Moszs, 
Superintendent.

STATE TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLE. 
To County Superintendents and Teachers: 
The Public School Officers’ Association at its annual 
meeting in January, 1906, authorized the State Superintend- 
ent to appoint a committee to organize and select 4 course of 
study for a State Teachers’ Reading Circle. 
The State Superintendent appointed ‘said Committee and 
they organized as follows: 
W. E. Lumley, of Paris, Chairman. : 
Miss Elizabeth Messick, of Memphis, Secretary. 
Alfred Livingston, of Clarksville, Treasurer. 
Fred J. Page, of Franklin; Fred B. Frazier, of Dayton, 
and R. H. Watkins, of Bristol. 
The above will constitute the Board of Managers until 
changed by the Public School Officers’ Association. 
The Board of Managers selected the following course of 
study: 
FOR PRIMARY TEACHERS. 
The Little Schoolmistress by:C. L. Hayes, published by 
. Claude J. Bell Publishing Company, of Nashville. 
Hodge’s Nature Study and Life, published by Ginn & 
Company, Chicago. 
_ White’s School Management, published by American 
Book Company, Cincinnati, O. 
FOR SECONDARY TEACHERS.

—558— 
Superintendents and Teachers are hereby notified that 
after January 1, 1907, all teachers will be required to pass 
an examination on the above books before being granted 
certificates. This requirement is made in accordance with 
Sec. 7, subsection 10, of the Public School laws. 
Superintendents will at once organize their teachers into 
_ an association and arrange for monthly meetings for review 
and discussion on the above works. I suggest that you make 
these subjects the pricipal work of your teachers’ associa- 
tions. Teachers should purchase the books and begin their 
: study at once. 
Under the regulations made by the Board of Managers 
each county will organize a circle and a fee of 10 cents for 
each member will be collected and forwarded to Miss Eliza- 
beth Messick, Secretary, Memphis, Tenn. This will entitle 
those who complete the course satisfactorily to a certificate 
that will exempt them from examination for the current 
year in the theory and practice of teaching and such other 
subjects as the County Superintendent may direct. This fee 
will be used for the necessary expenses, such as printing, 
preparation of outlines and circulars of information. No 
member of the Board of Managers will receive any salary. 
At the meeting of the Public School Officers’ Association 
in January, 1907, additional regulations will be made. 
Books should be ordered direct from the publishers, as 
the State Department of Public Instruction will under no 
circumstances receive any money or order any books. 
Please bring this matter to the attention of your teachers 
at once. Very truly yours,

The foregoing is most respectfully submitted as the statement

Most respectfully, P. L. Harnep,

amined the books. of your secretary and treasurer. We find his 
report correct. Respectfully submitted, = 
: E. H. Boyp, 
W. C. Lawson, 
Frep B. FRrazter. 
’ Your Committee on Memorials most respectfully submit the fol- 
lowing report: 
We have sustained the loss of but one member from the list of 
County Superintendents during the year 1905. In the early days 
of October, 1905, Superintendent Hugh T. Hanks, of Lauderdale 
County, passed quietly away in the town of Ripley. “Captain 
Hanks,” as he was familiarly called by all who knew him, had been” 
in bad health for several months, scarcely able to attend to office 
business at home. Though’ in a very feeble condition, he exerted 
‘every possible effort to complete and make perfect his annual re-
-P-A-G-E-611
——586— 
port for the school year ending June 30, 1905. He succeeded. in 
making the report, which proved to be his last official work. 
In the early. years of his life Captain Hanks qualified himself 
. for the profession of law, but his kind and genial disposition would 
not permit him to spend his life in so cold and stern a profession; 
so he began teaching, and was rapidly rising in thé profession when 
the trouble between the States came up in 1861. He cast his for- 
tunes with the Confederacy, and became captain of one of the com- 
panies in the Fifty-seventh Tennessee Regiment. He did his duty 
manfully during the war; and when the Confederacy went down 
at Appomattox, Captain Hanks returned home, reéntered the teach- 
ing force of Lauderdale County, in which he spent the greater part 
of his life. He was a good citizen, loved and honored by all who 
Knew him. In 1896 the late Mrs. Watkins, having served as 
County Superintendent of Lauderdale County quite a number of 
years, retired from the school work; and Captain Hanks became 
County Superintendent of his county, in which capacity he served 
his people most efficiently until called to a higher and more exalted 
life. Both teachers and patrons had great love and respect for 
Captain Hanks. No one scattered more sunshine and happiness 
~ in the pathway of those with whom he associated than did Captain 
Hanks. Tle was a strict miember of the Presbyterian Church, and 
lived the life of a pure Christian. To his beloved wife and other 
. loved ones we extend the sympathy of the Public School Officers’ . 
Association of. Tennessee, and hope that they and his professional 
associates tnay so imitate his noble Christian traits that when the 
end comes they may all be prepared to joint him in the great un- 
known future where there can be no more partings. 
We submit this for ratification, and ask that the secretary of 
this association be requested to furnish a copy of this report to the 
family of the deceased. J. R. McDowatp, Chairman 5

We, your Committee on Resolutions, beg leave to report as fol- 
lows : 
The State Public School Officers’ Association, being composed of 
those officials and teachers who are charged with the direct admin- 
istration of the school laws and school economies of the State, may 
claim without arrogance to be in position to judge rationally of the 
efficiency, the progress, the defects, and the needs of the public- 
_ school system of Tennessee. Therefore, hg it resolved, 
1. That we heartily commend the able administration. of educa- 
tional affairs by State Superintendent S. A. Mynders as ‘wise, pro- 
gressive, and popular; that we congratulate him ‘and the State on 
the unprecedented advance in both State and county appropriations 
for educational purposes, on. the increased enthusiasm in every part 
of the State, on the close and efficient organization of educational 
workers and the consolidation of small schools, on the elimination. . 
of the incompetent and-the advancement of the capable, on the 
‘full and comprehensive reports of the State’s educational condi- , 
tion-—in.a word, on each item of an administration that i is an. hoor 
to the State Superintendent and a benefit. to the State. . 
2. This association gratefully recognizes the valuable aid our ed- 
ucational interests have received from the Southern Education 
Board, and we respectfully ask that their appropriations be con- 
tinued for an organized, systematic campaign in Middle and West 
Tennessee similar to that which has been conducted i in East Ten- ' 
nessee during the past year. 
3. That by this resolution our legislative committee be author- 
ized to appoint subcommittees to confer with committees from 
other organizations in the State for the purpose of devising and 
securing wise legislation in the interest of popular education. And 
‘we recommend that the State increase its per capita appropriation 
to 75 cents per annum for each child of school age; that $25,000 
be appropriated to each of three teachers’ training schools, one in 
each grand division of the’ State; and $50,000 to our State Uni- 
versity. 
4. We tender sincere thanks to the officers of our association for. 
the programme and business arrangement that have made this de-
-P-A-G-E-613

lightful meeting possible, to the railroads for favors in transpor- 
_ tation, to the officials of Carnegie Library for the use of their com- 
modious halls, to Governor Cox for his kindly welcome and unfail- 
‘ing interest in educational affairs, to the ‘Tennessee Library Asso- 
ciation for its genial friendship and comraderie, and to the press 
for the graceful manner in which it has exploited us in the news- 
paper world. By the committee, G. R. McGues, 
. : Chairman. 
Whereas, Miss Helen M. Gould, of New York, has taken such 
great interest in the schools of Tennessee as that she has sent Col. 
J. W. Brown, a specialist in bird study and bird life, that he may 
work with ‘school people and school children, educating them in 
bird value; and whereas the said I. W. Brown has delivered to us a 
most interesting address; therefore be it 
Resolved by the School Superintendents of the State in institute 
. assembled, That we send to Miss Gould our most sincere thanks 
for her kindly thought. for us. 
Recommended as part of proceedings of Wednesday, J anuary 17, 
1906. By the committee, G. R. McGuer, — 
: : Chairman, 
_ Whereas, under the distribution of the $50,000 set apart by an 
Act of, the General Assembly of 1905, known as the “ Tolleti Bill,” 
practically all the schools in those counties with a sufficient school 
levy to receive aid. from the same will be enabled to run schools 
six months of the year 1906; as shown by the report of the State 
Board of Education; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That this association heartily indorse the provisions 
of said bill and the distribution of the funds under the same.

PROCEEDINGS. _ 
Turspay Evenine, JuLcy 24,°1906. 
The fortieth annual meeting of ‘the Tennessee State Teachers” 
- Association was called to. order ‘by President Robert L, Jones at 
8: 30 o’clock in the Auditorium, Chattanooga. 
Prayer was offered by Dr. Ira M. Boswell. 
Mayor W. L. Frierson was introduced by. President Jones. . The 
“Mayor, in a very pleasing address of welcome, delivered the keys 
of the city to the teachers. : 
Hon. H. Clay Evans welcomed the teachers in behalf of the 
Chamber of Commerce. Among other things, he said: “ The pros- 
perity of the republic depends upon the intelligence of its citizen- 
‘ ship. The public schools are necessary to good government. 
‘Teach the children not.only literature and science, but honesty, 
truth, and morality.” 
The teachers were welcomed in behalf of the public schools of 
the city by Col. L. T. Dickinson. His address was exceptionally 
- interesting and appropriate to the occasion. “The architect,” said 
Colonel Dickinson, “makes blue prints of each building before 
him ; so the teacher must make blue prints on-his braixi of the mind 
and character of each pupil.” 
Dr. W. 8. Bobard, dean of the ‘Theological Department of Grant 
University, welcomed the teachers in behalf of the colleges. He 
. spoke of the close relations that ought to exist between the college 
and the: public-school teacher, and urged upon every teacher the: 
necessity of inspiring his pupils with a desire for a college edu- | 
-eation. 
The address of wreleothe on the, part of the private schools of the . 
2 city was delivered by Prof..S. J. McCallie. He deplored the ex- 
istence of a distrust between the public and the private school. 
_Tn speaking of the public and private schools of Chattanooga, he 
expressed his gratitude to Superintendent Gilbreath for having
-P-A-G-E-619
—594— 
used his influence in establishing very cordial relations between 
them. — 
Chancellor B. L. Wiggins, of the University of the South, in 
behalf of the colleges and universities, responded to the address 
of welcome. He based his appeal for higher education on this 
thought: “A nation cannot rise above the intellect of its citizens.” 
. He spoke briefly of the relation of public schools and higher. in- 
. stitutions of learning to the improvement of our citizenship and 
to the general welfare of our country. 
The response for the public schools of the State to the addresses of 
welcome was delivered by Superintendent J. B. Cummins, of Tren- 
ton. In speaking of the three divisions of the State, he said: 
“hough divided politically and industrially, we are united edu- 
cationally.” : 
Following these mutual greetings, Vice President C. B. Tjams © 
took the chair, and President Robert L. Jonés delivered the annual 
address. He gave a brief history of public-school legislation in 
“Tennessee, and showed that the condition of the schools could not 
be improved till the State increases its appropriation for public 
education and provides adequate training schools for teachers. *’ 
' ‘The meeting adjourned till 10 o’clock Wednesday morning. 
Wepngspay Mornine, JuLy 25, 1906. 
The association met in the High School Building, and was called 
to order by President Robert L: Jones, of Chattanooga. 
Professor P. P. Claxton, of the University of Tennessee, ade 
dressed the association on “County High Schools.” The argu- 
ments advanced by Professor Claxton for. the immediate establish- 
ment of high schools in every county, of the State are unanswerable, 
Superintendent J. B. Cummings continued the discussion by em- 
phasizing the arguments of Professor Claxton and urging the teach- 
. exs of the public schools to aid in this movement. , 
. At the conclusion of Professor Claxton’s address the following 
resolution was offered by C. B. Ijams and was S unanimously adopted 
by the association : 
“Resolwed, That we, the members of the Tennessee State Teachers’
-P-A-G-E-620

Association, in convention assembled, do most heartily indorse the 
address made by Prof. P. P. Claxton-on ‘ County High Schools;’ 
and we do hereby pledge ourselves to do all in our power to assist 
’ in the further establishment of county high schools in each county, 
and that we use-every energy to aid the State Superintendent in 
“the educational rallies to be held over the State toward the further

_ torium. 
The evening session was devoted to addresses by Hon. J. H. 
Hinemon, State Superintendent of Arkansas and Hon. Seymour 
A. Mynders, State Superintendent of Tennessee. Both addresses 
were practical and stimulating. Superintendent Hinemon handled 
his subject, “'The Teacher and Good Citizenship,” in a masterly 
manner. His words were encouraging and inspiring to the teach-- 
ers. Superintendent Mynders spoke on the subject, “ The State 
and Public Schools.” The. teachers listened attentively: to every 
word, and fully indorsed the sentiments expressed in the address.

ical paper on “ The Duty of the State to Establish Normal Schools 
for the Training of Teachers.” 
Professor Rose was followed by Prof.-W. 8. Gass, of Carson and 
Newman College, in the further discussion of this subject. 
Miss Skeffington, the popular State Librarian, then addressed the 
association, and petitioned for their influence in ‘passing a bill for 
an appropriation of $2,500 from the Legislature, the money to be 
used in buying seventy-five libraries of fifty volumes each, to be 
' given to the County Superititendents of each county for circula- 
tion in the rural schools. Each library is to be divided into two 
sections. No half iibrary shall be kept by one school, longer than 
three months or no library by one county longer than a schoo year 
of nine ‘months. 
The address of Superintendent W. B. Merritt, of Georgia, fol- 
lowed, and was one of the gems of the convention. It was filled 
with humor and pathos, and was keenly enjoyed. The burden of 
-the thought of the speaker was greater attention to the rural schools. 
The association adjourned until 8 P.M. 
Tuurspay Evenine, JuLy 26, 1906. 
The association met in the Auditorium, and was called to order 
by the President. 
Superintendent H. L. Whitfield, of Mississippi, addressed the 
association, making an earnest plea for a better school system in 
the South. “There is evidently no hope,” argued Superintendent 
Whitfield, “that the South can assume a front rank, industrially, 
in this generation; and the thing for us to do is to train up a race 
of industrial experts who will, in the next generation, carry this 
section of the country to the high place it deserves by virtue of its 
natural resources and of the great, noble-blodded, unmixed Anglo- 
Saxons who inhabit it. Brute force goes for almost nothing these 
days, and trained intelligence counts for almost everything.” 
_ Superintendent P. A. Lyon, of Murfreesboro, made a short ad- 
dress on “ Short Salaries.” . 
The Executive Committee made its financial report. Said-re- 
port appears in full in the proceedings of this meetnig.

: Superintendent Sam E. Hill offered the following resolutions, 
which were unanimously adopted by the association : 
“Viewing with a sense of deep appreciation the result of efforts 
. which have, through years of varying degrees of success, worked 
out a public-school system that has done and is doing a work of in- 
estimable value for the citizenship of our splendid’Commonwealth, 
and recognizing in the children of our people qualities which, if 
properly developed, will erfable the citizenship of to-morrow to not 
only enjoy the bounties afforded by the lavish provisions of nature, 
but also to occupy a place in the affairs-of society that is in keep- 
ing with the excellency of the natural ability of the men and women 
who have contributed so riuch to the permanency of our existence, 
"owe, the representatives of the teachers of Tennessee, in association 
assembled, desire to acknowledge: 
’ 1, A debt of gratitude for the most excellent benefits which 
.. have come to us as a result of a work inaugurated by.a noble band 
of educational pioneers in the first days of our existence. The 
wisdom of the policies adopted by our forefathers has been proved. 
They builded better than they knew, and it is becoming for us to 
honor their memories by doing the best of which we are capable 
.. for the education of all the people. : 
-“2, An expression of confidence in the disposition and ability 
‘of our people to carry on the work of public education until our 
schools.are made to respond to every demand created by the organ- 
ization of modern life. 
“3, A vote of thanks to Prof. P. P. Claxton and others for the 
persistent efforts which they have directed to the work of better- 
ing conditions of the common schools’ of the State. Already the 
’ seed which they have sown is bearing fruit. We commend their 
work as being worthy of our support, and hereby pledge our un- 
stinted codperation in all their future efforts. 
., “4 We recognize the administration of Superintendent 8. A. 
: ‘Mynders as being eminently successful, and we hereby give our 
* *hearty and unqualified indorsement to the work which he has done.
-P-A-G-E-623
-—-598— 
He has labored earnestly, unceasingly, and efficiently to develop 
a higher citizenship by improving the public schools of the State. 
He has impressed all by his every word and: official act that his 
one motive for constant labor is his desire to make better the oppor- 
tunities offered to the children of Tennessee. We promise Super- 
imtendent Mynders to coéperate with him in the work which he has 
instituted for the betterment of our educational enterprises. He 
has worked faithfully; his influence has reached far. Coming 
days will reveal to all the intrinsic value of the results of a work 
~ that was given, in an unselfish way, to the uplifting of the children. 
“5. Feelings of appreciation for the work of Superintendents 
8. G. Gilbreath and R. L. Jones and: Prof. William L. Lawrence 
in making the present meeting of the association an unprecedented 
success. Their efforts, together with those of the Executive Com- 
mittee, have given us the best meeting in the history of the asso- 
ciation. We thank them heartily, and commend the example which 
they have set to the favorable consideration of the incoming offi-’ 
cials. If their plan is followed, ‘Tennessee erelong will have a 
. Teachers’ Association of which the State may feel proud. 
“6. That Chattanooga has treated us royally. Her citizens have 
been cordial, our welcome genuine, and our enjoyment complete. 
We extend our thanks especially to the railroads for their accom- 
modation in rates and the press for their assistance. 
_ “Again pledging ‘ourselves to the support of the measures that 
are now uppermost in the minds of our educational leaders, we 
declare that our support shall be given to candidates for public 
office who are in sympathy with our aims and efforts. These meas- 
ures we énunciate as follows:

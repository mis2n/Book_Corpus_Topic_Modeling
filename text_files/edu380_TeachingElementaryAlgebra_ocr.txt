  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
I spout like to have every teacher of elementary 
algebra read this book; not only read it, but study and 
ponder it. There can be little doubt that elementary 
algebra, in its traditional form, has been the least satis- 
factory of our secondary-school mathematical courses. 
The author’s analysis of the reasons therefor is inter- 
esting, his proposed remedy is at once original and 
sane. His discussion of the “practical” problem and 
of why it is unsuitable is illuminating. Above all, his 
method of problem analysis constitutes, I believe, a 
real contribution to mathematical methodology. 
The author has brought to his work an unusual pre- 
paration. He has had many years’ experience in shop 
and industrial practice; for the past several years he 
has taught in a public high school. He has thought 
deeply both on the need of the general citizen for 
mathematical training and on how to impart such 
training effectively. His fellow teachers may not in 
every instance agree with his conclusions, but I am 
confident that no thoughtful teacher will fail to find his 
exposition stimulating and suggestive. No further 
word of introduction on the part of the Editor seems 
called for. Let the book speak for itself.

PREFACE 
ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA causes more trouble than all 
the other courses of the curriculum put together. It is 
usually held directly responsible for a high percentage 
of freshman mortality. Aside from this, the fortunate 
few who obtain passing grades seem unable to make 
much use of their training. They can solve the most 
complicated examples in factoring or simultaneous 
quadratics, but are unable to solve ordinary quantita- 
tive problems, which require insight and mental power 
rather than skill in symbolic manipulation. It is 
hardly necessary to add that most of them are totally 
unable to formulate a problem from scattered data or 
measurements; that is, to choose between the relevant 
and the irrelevant. In short, elementary algebra does 
not appear to be organized in such a way that tangible 
and practical results are obtained. 
A large number of books claiming to remedy this 
situation have been published. We have all learned 
from past experience that books using purely deduc- 
tive methods fail to produce satisfactory results with 
most students. Most of us have learned through bit- 
ter experience that purely practical books, which give 
only formulas and direction for their use in practical 
problems, do not contain that subtle and elusive thing 
which, once grasped, gives mastery over mathematical

processes. Some of us are now learning to our surprise 
that a combination of the former theoretical with the 
present practical also fails to develop sound habits of 
quantitative thinking. 
In the past we have blamed, analyzed, and greatly 
improved various special features: training of teachers, 
textbooks, methods of presentation, and organization 
of subject, yet the situation has remained essentially 
unchanged. We must evidently turn our attention to 
the very foundation of the structure, the features that 
have stood so long that we have come to look upon 
them as being essential or unchangeable. The author 
proposes to discuss the following fundamental topics: 
1. Lack of proper motivation. Motivating the sub- 
ject is usually understood to mean the presentation of 
details and facts related to the subject in such a way 
that the pupil is induced to study. This narrow inter- 
pretation is one of the causes of our troubles. The 
author takes the position that a school or life task will 
be more expeditiously performed if the reason for its 
performance is plainly seen. Therefore an extensive 
discussion of the “practical” problem is included. 
2. The inductive method. This method of teaching 
mathematics is very popular at the present time. The 
fallacy on which the method rests will be pointed out. 
This should not be taken to mean that a return to the 
old deductive methods is advocated. It means rather 
that a sane combination of the two methods, together 
with a clear understanding of the learning process, 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
PREFACE vii 
seems to be the only sound foundation of mathematical 
teaching. 
3. Relationships. What is meant by relationships 
among quantities? Can the student be taught to “ex 
press the relationships among the quantities in sym- 
bolic language,” a common phrase in discussion, when 
the teacher does not show him how to express the rela- 
tionships in plain English, does not teach him how to 
find them, often does not give a single illustration of 
what is meant by arelationship? A full answer to this 
troublesome question is given. A number of problems 
are analyzed, and as a further aid a simple diagram- 
matic way of exhibiting these relationships is given 
which will be found of great assistance in the analysis 
of problems. 
4. The use of the function concept in unifying the 
subject. Every one speaks of the function concept as 
being the great unifying idea in mathematics. Yet 
few make use of it. It is the author’s purpose to show 
that every problem solved by means of the function 
idea strengthens the pupil’s grasp of the subject as a 
whole. 
5. Fundamentals. The author recklessly plunges 
into this dangerous topic. He may be wrong in some 
of his conclusions, but hopes that the reader will be 
indulgent toward the mistakes of a pioneer. Let us 
stop talking about fundamentals in speeches and find 
out what they are. Let us drag what we call the 
fundamentals out into the open, examine them in 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
  
  viii PREFACE 
broad daylight, and see how they can be used to per- 
form their main function, that of unifying the subject. 
What most people seem to call the fundamentals of 
mathematics are only the fundamental rules of sym- 
bolic manipulation. 
6. The characteristic formula. This name is here 
given to that element in an algebraic problem which a 
little thought and use will show to be one of the true 
fundamentals of mathematics. It will be found to 
embody a unifying idea in problem-solving. It is an 
idea which has been functioning for ages, controlling 
mathematical thinking, yet apparently never clearly 
seen nor recognized. Without a clear conception of 
the réle of the characteristic formula, it is difficult to 
see how to solve algebraic problems, excepting through 
the hit-or-miss methods in vogue among schoolboys 
and quite a few of their elders. Ignorance of the char- 
acteristic formula, therefore, is at the root of many of 
our troubles in elementary mathematics. No pains 
have been spared to make its working so clear that the 
teacher will find no difficulty in establishing sound 
habits in the recognition of quantities and their rela- 
tionships, without which there cannot be any con- 
trolled association nor any effective quantitative rea- 
soning. The idea of a characteristic formula is so 
simple, and its application so obvious, that the reader 
will probably pay the author the compliment of claim- 
ing that he knew it all the time. But when he sees 
that the conscious application of it is essential to the
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE ix 
long-sought general method for the solution of pro- 
blems, as described in this book, he will agree that its 
teaching is of fundamental importance. 
In addition, the reader will find some new methods 
of simplifying problems, of justifying formal drill and 
“academic” problems, of introducing symbolic nota- 
tion and the concept of negative numbers, ete. The 
aim at all times is to present the material in such a way 
that it can be used by the teacher word for word, at 
least in the presentation of fundamentals. 
No attempt has been made to discuss methods of 
teaching symbolic manipulation. The technique of 
developing skill therein is well understood and modern 
textbooks can hardly be improved upon in this field. 
Neither has any attempt been made to establish new 
methods in some of the advanced parts of the subject. 
After the child has made a sound start, has learned to 
organize the material that he learns, can solve pro- 
blems, and feels that he is mastering a useful subject in 
the correct way, any standard method will produce 
satisfactory results. 
The author wishes to render full acknowledgment to 
the faculty of the McClymonds High School of Oak- 
land for their interest and aid in the way of criticism 
and suggestions after reading the manuscript. He is 
especially indebted to Principal W. A. Tenney, with- 
out whose assistance and continued interest the psy- 
chological experiments confirming the soundness of the 
methods described could not have been performed.
-P-A-G-E-10

Most of all he wishes to express his appreciation to 
Professor J. W. Young, of Dartmouth College, whose 
constructive suggestions enabled him to organize the 
material on a sound basis.

INTRODUCTION 
Tue average teacher finds it difficult to obtain satis- 
factory results. Methods of instruction which ap- 
peared easy to follow as expounded by some great 
educational authority are found to be applicable only 
after a class has been organized and well started, and 
only after it has a sound background of well-assimilated 
information. Great authorities too often forget to 
mention the insignificant details of the method through 
which fundamentals are mastered. 
The same thing may be said of most textbooks. 
After the first few chapters are mastered, the rest is 
easy. But the trouble is that the contents of the first 
few chapters rarely are mastered; hence the rest is not 
easy. The first few chapters contain nothing which 
will give a grasp of the fundamental concepts and a 
view of the whole. Every author loves to get into the 
difficult part of his subject, which he would expound to 
students trained by some one else in the fundamentals. 
Authors are too prone to take for granted that the 
teacher has already learned what these fundamentals 
are and how to teach them. 
Many teachers follow the lead of these authorities. 
They are impatient to get into the interesting parts of 
the subject, the parts which they assume will be inter- 
esting to their pupils. They do not like to linger on 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  xvi INTRODUCTION 
the fundamentals, for a very sufficient reason: very 
few of them have themselves learned the fundamentals. 
They remember their own bewilderment when begin- 
ning the subject; they remember that after a while 
it became clear. They therefore assume that their 
pupils will react in the same way. Very few do so. 
If we analyze honestly the results of our teaching at 
the end of the term, we find that about five per cent of 
our students have obtained a reasonable mastery of 
mathematical processes, mainly in symbolic manipula- 
tion. We grade these “excellent.”” The rest, includ- 
ing the most of those graded “satisfactory,” have 
merely done their work in a more or less satisfactory 
manner. We feel that they will never be able to use 
mathematical methods with facility. Instructors in 
mathematics in any university will testify to the truth 
of this statement. Let us observe a diplomatic silence 
about those who “passed,” and the failures. 
It is our purpose to analyze the causes of this un- 
satisfactory situation and not only to suggest some 
remedies — the great national pastime in educational 
circles — but also to explain the “insignificant details” 
of successful methods used in starting the average class 
on its way to a real mastery of the subject. In short, 
our aim is to point out the stumbling blocks, and to 
help the teacher to remove them from the student’s 
way. This will be done by: 
1. Showing how the study of mathematics can be 
justified to the class.
-P-A-G-E-17
INTRODUCTION xvii 
2. Giving a clear and comprehensive view of the 
fundamentals. 
8. Unifying the subject around the function con- 
cept, thus providing a definite method of attack- 
ing the problems met in elementary algebra. 
4. Simplifying some of the traditional methods used 
in introducing various parts of the subject. 
5. Showing the place of practical problems in the 
sequence of study. 
These topics have been arranged with a view to 
classroom use. The reader, however, may begin with 
the chapter on “The Use of the Function Concept in 
the Solution of Problems” (Chapter VII). He will 
then obtain more quickly a clear idea of the plan 
followed.

THE TEACHING OF 
ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA’ 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO THE CLASS 
The situation in the classroom on the first day of the 
term 
You have finished the routine details, the children 
are seated and attentive, expecting the traditional 
speech of introduction. What are you to say that will 
create the right attitude toward the subject? The 
first words, the first five minutes, will have a great in- 
fluence on the results that you will obtain this term. 
You are about to create an attitude toward yourself 
and toward the subject which will in turn create good, 
bad, or indifferent habits. 
The importance of these first few minutes can hardly 
be overemphasized. The word “curiosity” properly 
describes the feeling of the whole class. Here is a new 
teacher, in a strange place, talking about a strange 
subject. This subject has an evil reputation. Many 
children have failed in the study and have had to leave 
the school as a consequence. It is said by some to be 
as useless as it is difficult. What is the best way to
-P-A-G-E-20
  
  2 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
obtain a good grade with the least work? These and 
similar thoughts are passing through their minds. 
The teacher speaks: “‘Mathematics is the science 
of quantities . . . antiquity ... the Phoenicians... the 
Arabs ...the Hindoos...” and so on. The class 
listens more or less attentively, then forgets everything 
immediately on leaving the classroom. The ice has 
been broken, but not in the right way. The next day 
the struggle will begin. But it will be a struggle be- 
tween the teacher and the children instead of being a 
struggle between the children led by their teacher and 
the subject. 
What has happened? What should have been done? 
What is the correct way to interest the class, to moti- 
vate the subject? The answer to these questions 
forms the subject of this chapter. 
Attitude of children 
Let us return to the attitude of the children at the 
beginning of the teacher’s introductory speech. It is 
an attitude of expectancy as well as of curiosity. Psy- 
chologists tell us that curiosity can be changed to 
motivating interest, while expectancy leads to thought. 
Unfortunately, they are rather hazy as to the means 
through which such desirable results can be obtained. 
They have told us that we must arouse and maintain 
interest, but have failed to describe a clean-cut and 
result-producing plan of action. The principal reason 
for this failure is that the nature of interest is usually
-P-A-G-E-21
  
INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO CLASS 3 
misunderstood. This is well proved by various educa- 
tional fads which appear from time to time, all justify- 
ing themselves by the claim that they arouse the inter- 
est which all other methods have failed to arouse. 
Analysis of interest 
In the final analysis, interest in most instances is 
only a product of egotism. We are interested in per- 
sons, objects, and subjects in the exact proportion in 
which they promise to influence our immediate or 
future welfare or environment. Hence, if we do not 
perceive, or cannot be made to perceive, any relation 
between them and ourselves, our interest will not sur- 
vive the initial stage of novelty. Such interest de- 
serves only the name of curiosity. It is a mild and 
polite feeling, not the motivating interest that induces 
effort. What interests people? “Themselves,” an- 
swered Lord Northcliffe. He understood the funda- 
mental psychology of interest. 
This suggests a plan of action. We must relate the 
subject to the students. This is usually done by relat- 
ing it to life in general, by showing that some one uses 
it somewhere. Then it is fondly expected that the 
students themselves will somehow make the rest of the 
connections. A few of the more intelligent do so, but 
the great majority do not. This is due to the lack of 
realization on the part of teacher or author that the 
background in youth is very limited, and that the 
relations given are not numerous enough, not sufli-
-P-A-G-E-22
4 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
ciently emphasized, nor understood clearly enough to 
create a lasting impression. Each student must be 
convinced that the subject has an important bearing 
on his own future welfare. Besides this, he must fre- 
quently be made to recall this conviction until the 
right attitude is created. That mild fear of the future 
which is usually called “ambition” must be aroused 
and fed by direct or indirect means. 
The seven questions 
Psychologists have formulated laws of learning. 
Unfortunately they have not yet given us laws that 
can be used to advantage by an average teacher, when 
trying to persuade an average, skeptical, and unwilling 
student that mathematics or indeed any mental effort 
is good for him. The following home-made analysis 
may lead us to the formulation of such laws. It de- 
scribes the usual reaction on the part of the pupil when 
a new subject or object is introduced. 
1. What is this? 
2. What is it good for? (Who uses it?) 
. Will I ever have any use for it? Show me. 
. How does it work? 
. Will you let me try it? 
. Why does it act this way? (What are the under- 
lying principles?) 
7. What other uses has it? (Generalization.) 
Questions 1 and 2 are due to pure curiosity; judg- 
ment is suspended. It should be noted at once that 
Qa 
ke
-P-A-G-E-23
    
  
INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO CLASS 5 
a satisfactory reply to these questions must give the 
pupil a conception of mathematics as a whole, must 
give him some idea, however vague, of a general plan. 
The exhibition merely of details is fatal to future inter- 
est. We shall return to this point presently. 
Until you have answered Question 3 in such a way 
that the student is absolutely convinced that he needs 
mathematics, you cannot secure his best efforts. He 
is probably a descendant of Euclid’s practical pupil. 
The subject does not promise to influence his life. He 
will not in general be induced to ask Questions 4 and 5 
because he is not interested in them. To expect Ques- 
tions 6 and 7 under such circumstances is futile. 
How to make each individual in the class realize that 
he actually needs the subject for immediate or future 
use is then the teacher’s first and probably most im- 
portant problem, because once this need is realized the 
class will practically teach itself. Incidentally this 
will also solve the discipline problem. 
A crude attempt to obtain this result is usually made 
when the students are told, in indefinite terms, that the 
subject is important, or when vague reasons are given 
tending to show that their efforts will be rewarded in 
the dim future. But such talks are useless; for, as 
Dewey says, “General appeals to a child to think (and 
hence to study), irrespective of the existence of some 
difficulty that troubles him and disturbs his equilib- 
rium, are as futile as advice to lift himself by his boot- 
straps.” The average boy, like the average man,
-P-A-G-E-24
  
  6 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
wants action. He is impatient of results. Also he has 
only average intelligence; that is, unlike exceptional 
students, he fails to perceive from a few casually 
spoken words that there is any relation between the 
subject and himself. He has often heard similar 
speeches and never noticed any startling benefits to 
himself due to hard study. In short, he fails to react 
in the desired way, and may even react negatively 
since the word “study” directly and at once suggests 
mental effort, in most cases a painful process! 
Let us, then, begin by answering Questions 1, 2, and 
8 in the best possible way before we begin the actual 
study of mathematical processes, principles, notions, 
and devices. Questions 4 and 5 will be answered later 
in the present discussion; for answers to Questions 6 
and 7 the reader is referred to any standard textbook 
on mathematics. 
Question 1: What is mathematics? 
Classroom presentation. Mathematics is a tool. 
Through the use of it we obtain answers to questions. 
To what kind of question? To questions containing 
such expressions as how long, how much, how heavy, how 
safe, how fast, etc. Such questions are often asked 
when direct measurements with tapes, scales, gallon 
measures, and similar implements are not possible or 
practicable. These questions, called “problems,” usu- 
ally contain numbers and quantities and certain rela- 
tions between them, some known and others unknown.
-P-A-G-E-25
  INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO CLASS 7 
These quantities and relations must be manipulated 
according to certain definite rules before the answers 
can be obtained. The study of mathematics consists 
mainly of the study of these rules and of the devices 
through which they are applied to the solution of pro- 
blems. In short, mathematics is a tool. We use it to 
obtain answers to questions regarding quantities. 
A quantity is anything that can be measured, any- 
thing that can be increased or decreased, anything that 
can be expressed in numbers, in terms of units. We 
measure quantities because our daily work is essen- 
tially concerned with quantities. Lengths, volumes, 
weights, and costs are continually affecting our lives 
and fortunes. We must learn to calculate and manip- 
ulate quantities. We must learn to use the tool by 
means of which this is done, namely, mathematics. 
Discussion. It has been found by actual trial that 
an answer of this type satisfies the children. It is cer- 
tainly far more satisfactory than the following types of 
answer: 
1. Mathematics is the science of quantities, or of 
numbers. 
2. It saves time to use letters instead of words or 
numbers. 
8. Mathematics is a generalized arithmetic. 
Our answer appeals to practical-minded children. 
They are ready for the next question.
-P-A-G-E-26
  8 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Question 2: Of what use is mathematics? Who uses it? 
Classroom presentation. A large number of problems 
in our textbook illustrate the practical use of mathe- 
matics in shops, stores, and construction work, mainly 
in finding costs of products and processes. Besides 
technically trained scientists, teachers, inventors, engi- 
neers, and surveyors, we find that the following classes 
of men have a special need of mathematics: 
(1) Farmers and business men who want to know 
costs before ordering material, machinery, or build- 
ings. They must know selling costs, overhead charges, 
and profits. They need and demand exact figures in 
detail for every step in transportation, manufacturing, 
and distribution. They must be skillful in detecting 
. those errors the neglect of which sometimes causes 
large losses. 
(2) Contractors and managers of plants who have to 
bid on contracts. They must know exact costs, 
weights, strengths, dimensions, and sizes. 
(3) Estimators, assistants to managers, employed by 
the members of Classes (1) and (2). 
(4) Drafismen and designers of machinery, build- 
ings, ete. 
(5) Foremen, who have to calculate the small detail 
work constantly arising in shop routine which the un/ 
trained mechanics cannot handle. 
(6) Skilled mechanics who have to lay out the work 
for the machine hands and routine workers. 
Competition is becoming more and more strenuous.
-P-A-G-E-27
  INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO CLASS 9 
Rule-of-thumb, snap judgment, guessing methods are 
not allowed in important work any longer. These 
men must be sure that they are right before they do 
anything. A mistake or a wrong guess usually means 
loss of life or property. Everything, as far as is pos- 
sible, must be foreseen or calculated accurately and 
efficiently. The person who does not know how to 
plan and calculate size or cost is of little use in im- 
portant positions. The mechanic works with hand 
tools; the man who directs the mechanic’s efforts uses 
the brain tool, mathematics. 
We live in an age of rules. Whenever we wish to do 
anything without knowing just how to proceed, we ask 
advice from some one who does know. This person 
usually gives us rules: First you do this, then do that, 
and so on, until you obtain the desired result. Whether 
you wish to play ball, solder a kettle, wind a dynamo, 
or build a house, you first make sure that you know the 
rules that you are going to apply. Arranged properly, 
they form your plan of action. They are the result of 
the experience of mankind. They have proved their 
value in numberless cases. To disregard them may be 
the means of discovering some better way, but more 
usually leads to trouble and loss. 
We all use rules. In fact, the more rules we know 
and can apply, the higher our skill and standing. Some 
of the rules relate to manual work, the operation of 
tools and machinery. Still other rules relate to design, 
measurement, and laying-out. At present we are con- 
cerned with these latter rules only. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  10 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Measurements are of two kinds, direct and indirect. 
Direct measurements are obtained by the use of such 
implements as yardsticks, protractors, scales, etc. 
The use of these is well known or easily learned, and 
further mention is unnecessary. 
Indirect measurements come into play when we 
wish to measure any quantity to which direct measur- 
ing tools, for various reasons, cannot be applied. Thus 
the object to be measured may be impossible to reach; 
it may be inconvenient to handle; it may even not 
exist, except in our imagination, as when we design. 
The tool used for indirect measurements is mathe- 
matics. The only alternative is the guess. 
Discussion. The above statements about people 
who use mathematics usually produce startling results 
in the class. The pupils are fully prepared to hear 
that they will need mathematics the moment they 
begin to work in shops, offices, or stores. But they 
have already learned from various sources that almost 
no mathematics is actually used by the average person, 
so the teacher’s statement would have produced very 
little result. They are prepared for appeals to exert 
themselves on the ground that the subject will be im- 
mediately useful. But they are totally unprepared for 
the statement that they will not need mathematics so 
long as they are satisfied to remain in lowly positions. 
In this unprepared state the suggestion that only 
better-salaried persons need mathematics, with the 
accompanying fear that they may not be among the
-P-A-G-E-29
  
INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO CLASS 11 
elect unless they exert themselves, enters their minds. 
This is the motivating thought. It causes the student 
to answer the third question himself, the best and most 
convincing answer. 
The ethical purist may take issue with this method 
on the ground that mercenary motives should not be 
used, and that the only appeal to the lower instincts 
ethically permissible is inducing fear of failure in pro- 
motion and graduation. The same purist speaks of 
rousing ambition without realizing that ambition is 
partly fear of not having a good position in the future, 
and, also partly, a desire to have more than one’s share 
of the good things of life. The only answer needed is 
that appeals to higher and better motives made to 
adolescents have very seldom produced the desired 
reactions. It is about time for educators to begin to 
realize this fact. 
Let us speak plainly. There is little use in denying 
that the average child is intensely selfish and practical- 
minded, as well as complacent and perfectly satisfied 
with what he knows. He must be made to realize that 
training for life, like training for athletics, is a series of 
strenuous efforts; that men who occupy responsible 
positions have put themselves through intensive train- 
ing for those positions. The child must be shaken out 
of his complacency. His ambition must be aroused by 
a specific and direct method. It must be motivating 
ambition, not merely the vague desires that usually 
masquerade under the name of ambition.
-P-A-G-E-30
  12 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Other uses of mathematics 
While the above method will produce good results 
with the majority of pupils, it will fail with quite a 
few, especially with girls. The latter can hardly be 
expected to take much interest in industrial efficiency. 
For their edification, then, the teacher should mention 
other places where mathematics is used: 
1. In the study of sciences and in general scientific 
reading. 
2. In keeping household and personal accounts and 
budgets. 
8. In household management and the care and train- 
ing of children. 
4. In assisting children with their studies, by par- 
ents. 
5. In forming valuable habits of planning and 
logical thinking, thus directly useful in language 
work. 
6. In the arts: music, sculpture, painting, and de- 
sign. 
The teacher should have such arguments at his 
ready disposal, since doubts of the usefulness of mathe- 
matics are hard to dispel. Yet they must be dispelled 
if earnest effort is desired. Each of these doubting 
Thomases must be convinced that the subject is useful 
tohim. No real interest or progress can otherwise be 
expected from any but the exceptionally intelligent 
few who find mathematics an enjoyable intellectual 
recreation.
-P-A-G-E-31
  INTRODUCING MATHEMATICS TO CLASS 13 
Most textbooks do but little to assist the teacher in 
this vital point. Authors seem to consider that the 
beauty of logical reasoning, a few mathematical puz- 
zles solved in a way novel to the pupil, and a few 
problems with a “life setting,” will vitalize the sub- 
ject. Some authors even go so far as to state that 
mathematics has only a disciplinary value; that all the 
mathematics that people need in life-work can be 
taught to them in a few lessons. Pedantic statements 
of this kind, unsupported by any specific proof and 
displaying gross ignorance of industrial activities 
and needs and of the length of time required to as- 
similate fundamental principles, are gravely quoted 
and too often form the bases on which curricula are 
planned and textbooks on “practical” mathematics 
are written. 
The need of mathematics 
There are plenty of mathematical problems in life- 
work, but they generally remain unformulated owing 
to ignorance. Often they are not even recognized, 
somewhat as danger is not recognized by little children. 
It is natural in such circumstances to claim that they 
do not exist! The need of mathematics is then more 
real than apparent. Unable to avail themselves of 
mathematics, people substitute guessing methods with 
all the attached danger and costs. Then to the end of 
life they remain convinced that mathematics is a use- 
less or unnecessary subject. Breakages, accidents,
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
losses of contracts, and so on, are considered inevitable 
factors in business. Not having standards of com- 
parison, they never realize the high cost of their 
ignorance.! 
Let us now assume that the student is thoroughly 
aroused and in a responsive frame of mind; that he is 
convinced that he needs mathematics. He is ready to 
do a reasonable amount of work, provided that he sees 
some plan of work leading to a definite result, and pro- 
vided that we remind him from time to time that 
mathematics is useful and practical. We will discuss 
the plan, show how the child may be made aware of it, 
then examine the methods that should be used in con- 
stantly recalling his initial impressions; that is, in sus- 
taining his interest. 
1 For a further elaboration of this point see Chapter IX. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  CHAPTER II 
FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS — THEIR FUNC- 
TION IN THE LEARNING PROCESS 
Question 4: How does it work? 
Tue student is now ready to give careful attention to 
an exhibition of mathematics in action. His attitude 
can be compared to that of a customer convinced by a 
salesman that a machine is worthy of a careful trial. 
The trial begins. The customer watches the machine, 
first as handled by an expert, then by himself. The 
fact that he does not get as good results as the expert 
does not discourage him. He is willing to submit to a 
period of learning. He has faith in the machine, for he 
has seen it producing good results. He acquires skill 
in operating the machine by following a definite plan. 
He runs it as well as he can, then studies the parts, runs 
it again, again examines the results, and repeats this 
until he thoroughly understands the operation. 
The teacher who is selling mathematics to his class 
must create a similar situation. He must first show 
how mathematics is used. He takes a practical prob- 
lem which the student cannot solve, although the latter 
fully understands the situation described and the need 
for a solution. The teacher analyzes the problem and 
through the manipulation of certain symbols obtains a 
solution. The student is led to perceive that this 
manipulation follows some definite law of procedure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  
16 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
He sees mathematics working as a machine. He sees 
the useful results and is eager to try his skill. He 
understands that he must submit to a period of learn- 
ing, because he realizes that he must learn something 
of the parts before he can operate the whole. Yet heis 
aware of the existence of the whole. He sees dimly that 
there is a general plan and that each part has some 
definite relation to the whole and is necessary thereto. 
The following example, illustrating the use and value 
of mathematics, has been found to be very effective at 
the beginning of the term: 
Classroom presentation. A plumber was offered 65 
pounds of solder of unknown composition. If it con- 
tained a reasonable amount of tin, it was a bargain, tin 
being worth 30 cents a pound, while lead is only worth 
10 cents. In order to ascertain its composition, he 
weighed the mass in water and found that it lost 6.025 
pounds of its weight. If tin loses 0.137 of its weight in 
water, and lead loses 0.089, how did he find the weight 
of the tin in the mass? (Specific gravity of tin = 7.35; 
S.G. of lead = 11.4 approx.) 
We can make this statement (write on the black- 
board): 
The tin and the lead weigh 65 pounds. 
In symbols: 
Be ee ih = 65 
or, 
T+L=65 qd
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 17 
The weight lost in water by one pound of tin is 
0.137. The weight lost by 7 pounds would be 0.137 T. 
Similarly the weight lost by L pounds of lead would be 
0.089 L. 
We can then make this statement (write): 
Weight lost by tin added to weight lost by lead is 6.025 Ibs. 
In symbols: 
0.1387 T + 0.089 L = 6.025 
or, 
0.137 T + 0.089 L = 6.025 2) 
Multiplying each side of (1) by 0.089, we have 
0.089 T + 0.089 L = 5.785 
Subtracting this from (2) we obtain: 
0.048 T = 0.24 
Dividing each side of the equation by 0.048, we 
obtain 7 = 5. That is, there were 5 pounds of tin in 
the solder. From this result the plumber calculated 
its true value. 
Discussion. The objection that problems and 
methods of this type discourage the students is found 
to be unsound in most cases. The students constantly 
see difficult work, utterly beyond their own small skill, 
performed by experts in various lines. We usually 
find that children are stimulated rather than discour- 
aged by such experiences. Difficult feats challenge
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
them to effort, because they realize that they may be 
required to duplicate them. On the other hand easy 
tasks fail to interest them, for they know that they can 
perform them if necessary, without training. 
The above method of presentation, followed by 
practice drills, should be repeated frequently. The 
presentation should not be only of material that the 
student can learn thoroughly or use immediately. 
This would defeat the main purpose, which is to give 
some conception, no matter how vague, of the subject as a 
whole; of how the mathematical machine works in the 
hands of an expert. This conception of the plan will 
become stronger with each repetition, while the parts 
remain unified and interrelated. The subject will not 
be built piecemeal. It will gradually emerge into the 
full light. It will advance from the vague to the 
definite. 
At the beginning of the term, then, illustrative ex- 
amples should be frequently presented. They should 
be fully worked out by the teacher. A wealth of detail 
should be put in, with frequent references to the unify- 
ing plan. Besides a conception of the subject as a 
whole, the aim should be to create familiarity with the 
vocabulary of mathematics. A number of problems in 
this book fully illustrate the method of procedure. 
Fundamentals 
The word “fundamental” has been much over- 
worked and misused. Everybody speaks of funda-
-P-A-G-E-37
oe eh eee CF ORS THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 19 
mentals; but few define them, state them, or show the 
use of them. Each mathematician has his own list 
of fundamentals, differing from other people’s lists. 
The author takes advantage of this custom to give his 
own list. This will be done after what may be a rather 
novel definition of fundamentals is offered. 
The fundamentals in any science are the principles, 
facts, and concepts which the student must know well and 
understand clearly before beginning the study of that 
science. We do not establish fundamentals; we con- 
nect the subject tothem. When the principles, etc., of 
the science have been connected with what the learner 
already knows, then, and only then, do they in turn 
become the fundamentals. A proof of this is easily 
given. If we have not learned the principles called 
fundamentals by the authors it is because we have not 
associated them when presented. Associated with 
what? Obviously with what we knew before we began 
the study. Thus the axioms of mathematics become 
fundamentals as soon as the child perceives that what 
he already knows is utilized in the new subject through 
the use of axioms. In short, establishing funda- 
mentals means that we show the child that he already 
knows something about the subject. We should or- 
ganize what he knows before introducing new facts. 
Too often it is forgotten that in every subject there 
are only a few main ideas, while there are many details 
and facts. The latter become significant and useful 
only after they have been related to these main ideas,   
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  20 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
and through them to each other. The whole system of 
ideas then functions as a unit. These main ideas must 
be acquired and defined through their relation with 
what previously was fundamentally known, preferably 
through some concrete experience. This fundamental 
relation must be established as early as possible; these 
main ideas must ever be kept in the foreground; and 
new material must consciously and deliberately be 
related to them. 
The fallacy of the inductive method 
The author fully realizes that the above plan runs 
contrary to the present popular, so-called psycholog- 
ical, methad of teaching, which begins with new de- 
tails, particulars, and concrete elements. This latter 
method was developed in reaction against the excessive 
difficulty of the older, so-called deductive, method. 
Like most reactions it went to the other extreme, creat- 
ing evils which are just as great as those it avoided. 
The main claim of the partisans of the inductive 
method is that children learn details with more ease 
and interest through it than through the old method, 
and that therefore it is the correct psychological 
method. This is perfectly true so far as the details are 
concerned; learning details is the psychologically cor- 
rect method of learning details. But that is all. In 
practice we find that things learned psychologically are 
forgotten just as psychologically, that is, just as fast 
andeasily. After learning what seem to him unrelated
-P-A-G-E-39
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 21 
details by associating them with other unrelated de- 
tails the child fails to organize them into a significant 
whole which functions as a whole and which he can use. 
He fails to recall the details when he needs them be- 
cause they have been associated during the learning 
process with other disconnected details, The teacher 
or author has failed to show him how to organize his 
knowledge. Complaints from university instructors 
and from business men show the results of the induc- 
tive method. “Young people do not know anything 
well and are not interested in anything worth while,” 
is a well-nigh universal criticism. The inability of 
many people to take any interest in broad questions, to 
foresee consequences of acts and policies, may also be 
attributed to this vicious method of instruction. How 
can we expect people to grapple with great problems 
when we teach them only details, and carefully restrain 
any attempt at a generalization “before the pupil is 
prepared for it”? 
Some never are prepared for it. They are deliber- 
ately left without any guiding plan for a whole term. 
They are then expected to develop organizing ability 
unconsciously, without practice or help. Our induc- 
tive friends forget that very few people have the ma- 
turity of mind necessary for unaided generalization — 
the power to deduce a principle from a large number of 
apparently disconnected details.
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Reason for its popularity 
The inductive method is popular because it is easier 
to teach details and parts separately than it is to teach 
them in an organized way. It is easier to compile 
catalogues of mathematical processes and facts, claim- 
ing that the contents are arranged psychologically, 
than it is to write result-producing textbooks: the kind 
that organize facts as fast as they are presented. The 
inductive method is also popular because it yields im- 
mediate though small results. It looks like a short cut 
to knowledge. It appeals to our sense of efficiency and 
to the general human desire to get something for no- 
thing. But we are beginning to notice that we are not 
obtaining lasting results, and hence to suspect that the 
method must be fundamentally wrong. 
Common-sense tells us that we cannot begin by ex- 
amining the means to the end before we ascertain what 
the end is. A child cannot build out of parts a whole 
that he has never perceived. To expect him to dis- 
cover a relation between a fact and a unifying principle 
or definition, in the total absence of the factor to be 
related, may be psychologically correct; but has any 
child ever lived up to that expectation? 
“Thought consists in the establishment of relations. 
There can be no relation established, and therefore no 
thought framed when one of the related terms is absent 
from consciousness.” (Herbert Spencer.) How does 
this agree with “Definitions and general principles 
must grow out of the pupil’s concrete experience”?
-P-A-G-E-41
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 923 
They must, but they never do! They cannot grow 
unless the seed is present. The outlines of the defini- 
tions and general principles must be present from the 
beginning of the study, and they must grow more de- 
finite as progress is made. It is not necessary nor is it 
possible for the child to understand or see them clearly 
from the first. They may be dim, but the mind 
vaguely perceives some relation to each detail learned. 
Constant recall, however, will eventually make them 
more significant. 
The abuse of the deductive method 
The deductive method was sound in one point. It 
started from a unifying principle or definition, and 
worked down to the details and applications. A dim 
perception of the whole was obtained, together with its 
relation to the details. So far, the method was produc- 
ing good results. Repeating the process a few times 
with different details would give the students a fair 
idea of the function of the principle or definition. But 
some overzealous logicians, the efficiency experts of 
the period, began to tinker with the machine. They 
decided that it would save time to learn thoroughly all 
the fundamentals at the beginning of the course. The 
students were then required to memorize them and to 
have them ready at the tips of their tongues whenever 
their applications were needed. They were obliged to 
recite them and explain them clearly before they ever 
had a chance to apply them; for the applications came
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
after the essentials were “learned.” These essentials 
were also made criticism-proof by producing “gems of 
human thought,” much admired by logicians, but in- 
comprehensible to children, owing to the kind of words 
used and to the length of all-embracing sentences. We 
all know the results of this extreme formalism. The 
public rebelled and the whole method was scrapped, 
the good along with the bad. A thorough reform was 
demanded. 
The abuse of the inductive method 
Radical reformers rushed at once to the other ex- 
treme. They started their courses with concrete facts 
and details. So far their method was sound. If we 
present something known and tangible before we pre- 
sent the unknown we stand a good chance of forming 
the right association with an organized fact, and hence 
of getting the unknown learned. But the efficiency 
fanatics who started from the right premise: “Know- 
ledge rests on concrete experiences,” arrived at the 
wrong conclusion: “Therefore imparting knowledge 
must consist of the presentation of concrete experi- 
ences only.” They said that all true knowledge begins 
with concrete experiences and ends the same way. 
This may be true, but what happens between the be- 
ginning and the end? 
These short-sighted reformers tried to improve edu- 
cational methods by presenting concrete elements by 
the cartload, and expected the pupils to classify and
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 25 
generalize the entire mass at once at the end of the 
period, or worse still, at the end of the term. This was 
to be done by the unaided efforts of immature pupils 
who were to develop the power of generalization “psy- 
chologically” out of thin air, without any practice or 
even consciousness of the process. Such feats are 
sometimes performed by exceptional students, due to 
unconsciously correct generalization and classification 
developed in spite of the method. Such students are 
then cited as examples of the soundness of the pro- 
cedure. 
Illustrations of such methods are given by textbooks 
of so-called “practical” mathematics. These try to 
teach the use of formulas before the student has ac- 
quired the fundamental notion that the various parts 
of geometric figures are related to each other. Similar 
methods are exhibited in modern “practical” arith- 
metics when children are trained to juggle numbers 
before forming judgments of relative magnitude or are 
expected to solve problems without the fundamental 
notion that quantities are related in definite ways. 
It must be acknowledged that children like the in- 
ductive method. To them it seems practical and 
useful, as it apparently shows quick results. It is easy 
to work exercises that follow a given model. But 
when an attempt is made to increase the difficulty, its 
attractiveness disappears. It requires but little men- 
tal effort to memorize predigested facts and rules which 
can be recalled by any one who knows the cues. But
-P-A-G-E-44
26. TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
the only persons who know these cues are the authors 
or the teachers. The result is that the children can do 
fine work in class or with some particular book, and 
still fail to recall anything when the problem is pre- 
sented in some unfamiliar setting, outside of the class- 
room. Weare beginning to hear persistent talk about 
soft pedagogy. The pendulum is swinging back to the 
deductive method. Let us try to stop it halfway be- 
tween the two. 
Analysis of the learning process 
A comparison of the good points in both the induc- 
tive and deductive methods leads to an analysis of the 
learning process somewhat as follows: 
The mind vaguely grasps something as a whole, 
moves from this to some of the parts, returns to the 
whole which then becomes clearer, returns to the parts 
embracing a few more, and soon. This may be called 
an inductive-deductive, analytic-synthetic, or concrete 
abstract process. The mind combines a number of 
parts into a whole and separates it again into parts, 
repeating the process so long as further details are dis- 
covered to make up the whole. 
Objections to the natural way of learning - 
The above describes the natural way of learning. 
But looking at it from the point of view of modern 
needs, this natural way is defective in one vital point: 
the “whole” described in the preceding paragraph may
-P-A-G-E-45
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 27 
be anything plausible in appearance and available at 
the time of the presentation of the unknown material. 
That is, unless properly directed, we may organize and 
classify with the wrong group. Thus we may see a bat 
flying and by a natural error classify it with the bird 
group. 
The second objection to this natural way of learning 
is that undirected and haphazard classification does 
not provide any means of recalling the facts learned. 
But modern education has a definite objective: certain 
facts must be learned and they must be under control; 
i.e., they must be recalled whenever needed. Obvi- 
ously then we must introduce the right “whole” in the 
learning process, the function of this whole being to 
organize groups of facts and to serve as a beacon guid- 
ing the child’s effort. 
We find also considerable misunderstanding about 
the “known,” to which the new fact is to be related. 
Teachers and authors are inclined to consider as known 
anything which they have at any time mentioned, or 
that the children can “recite.” They confuse the 
“known” with the “should be known.” They also 
consider that anything which they term a fundamental 
immediately becomes one, and that whole chapters of 
the subject can be related thereto through their state- 
ments. They can be so related, but the connecting 
bonds are mere threads, not cables that can stand 
the recalling strain. Every teacher can tell of the 
extraordinary misconceptions of fundamentally im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
portant principles revealed in examination papers or in 
problem work as a result of such teaching. 
An illustration 
The results obtained by the inductive and deductive 
methods may well be compared by taking a hypotheti- 
cal case. Let us assume that it is purposed to teach a 
class how to set up and operate a linotype machine. 
Assume also that this class knows nothing about lino- 
types or their use, and cares still less. 
A teacher using the purely inductive method would 
bring a number of separate parts such as gears, keys, 
shafts, and pinions to the class. He would have his 
pupils learn the names and uses of these parts by com- 
parison with similar parts of well-known machinery 
such as automobiles or watches. At the end of this 
course the children would be expected to know how to 
set up and operate a linotype. They would be ex- 
pected to discover by themselves what the whole ma- 
chine looks like and how it is used and operated. For 
have they not learned the parts, more quickly than 
they could by any other method? 
On the other hand, a teacher using the purely de- 
ductive method would show blueprints of a linotype on 
the first day and briefly explain its use. He would 
then state those fundamental principles of mechanics 
and chemistry involved in its design and use, requiring 
that these be memorized. The children would be 
instructed to learn the application of these principles
-P-A-G-E-47
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 29 
to the various parts, class work being done from blue- 
prints. We can imagine what amount of interest 
would be displayed! At the end of the course the 
children would be expected to be able to learn actual 
operation of a linotype in minimum time. 
Obviously neither method would produce satisfac- 
tory results. The sensible way would be to show the 
machine in operation at intervals during the course, to 
use blueprints and separate parts, and to study the 
parts, not only as independent units, but also with due 
regard to their position in the machine, their function, 
and their relation to the other parts, and to teach the 
principles involved. At the end of such a course the 
children would be ready to begin intelligent study of 
the installation and operation. 
This third method apparently requires more time 
than the other two. In practice, however, it would be 
found to require less time than the first method be- 
cause it is easier to learn parts when the general plan is 
ever present, to which every part may be consistently 
connected as well as to the other parts. It would also 
be found to require less time than the second method 
because interest is maintained by actual handling of 
the parts and by sight of the machine in operation. 
The third method clearly follows the natural method 
of learning. First we consider the whole, then some 
details, the whole again, then other details, and so on. 
The machine gradually becomes better known as the 
study progresses, not through addition of detached
-P-A-G-E-48
  30 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
parts, but as a complete unit. From the beginning of 
the course to the very end the learner never loses sight 
of the whole plan, of the use of the machine, of the 
method of operation, nor of the purpose of the course, 
that he will operate the-machine eventually. 
Application of the third method to the study of mathe- 
matics 
At the beginning of this chapter we learned how to 
show the use of mathematics. The illustrative ex- 
amples throughout the book aim to maintain interest, 
that is, to keep in touch with the purpose of the study. 
A conception of the general plan and methods of opera- 
tion must gradually be acquired by the pupil through 
the constant use of the tools that we call the funda- 
mentals. The two main functions of fundamentals 
are: (1) our authority for statements, definitions, prin- 
ciples, and processes; (2) our unifiers and organizers of 
the subject. 
It is not essential thoroughly to understand every 
possible meaning and application of a fundamental 
before using it for the above two purposes, any more 
than it is necessary to know every possible use of a 
hand tool before using it for some specific purpose. 
Lack of realization of this fact has kept many teachers 
from organizing their courses in a desirable way. 
They have felt that they ought to do everything 
“thoroughly.”
-P-A-G-E-49
  
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MATHEMATICS 31 
Fundamental notions essential to learning 
We may take for granted that the following condi- 
tions essential to learning have been established. 
There must be present: 
1. A personal motive, creating the right attitude 
toward the subject. 
2. Some general notion of the end in view. 
8. Some unifying principle, more or less clearly 
understood. 
4. Some known fact with which association is made. 
This fact must be known to be related in some 
way to the unifying principle, or fundamental. 
Keeping in mind these four conditions, the author 
offers the following list of fundamentals which must be 
introduced and assimilated as early as possible. They 
are the means by which the teacher will lead the child 
to a mastery of mathematical processes. | 
1. I want to learn all I can about mathematics. 
2. A problem is not a meaningless puzzle. It can be 
shown to be in most cases an abbreviated de- 
scription of some difficult life situation which 
some person has had to meet, and which I in turn 
may have to meet. 
8. Higher mathematics is used in the solution of 
problems when arithmetic methods are inade- 
quate. Its processes are easier, quicker, and less 
liable to error. The results obtained are easier to 
check. 
4. Statements of problems contain or imply some 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
32 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
kind of relationship between the quantities in- 
volved. (This is the function concept in its 
initial form.) Such relations can be expressed 
by means of sentences. These sentences can be 
translated into equations. 
. The general plan of solution of a problem is 
then: 
(a) Recognize the quantities described and 
implied in the statement of the problem, 
(b) List the statements explicitly made con- 
cerning these quantities, 
(c) Discover the form of the characteristic 
formulas ! needed, : 
(d) Translate these statements and relations 
into symbols and solve the resulting equa- 
tions. 
. Symbols stand for words and sentences. They 
are used because they show at a glance the rela- 
tionships between the quantities, the plan of 
operation, and the necessary processes. It saves 
time to use symbols, and they are easier to handle 
than sentences. 
. The aim of symbolic manipulation is to place one 
unknown on one side of the equation alone, all 
the other (known) terms being on the other side. 
To attain this end we perform operations not 
contrary to the law of equations: namely, what- 
ever operation is performed upon one side of the

equation must also be performed upon the other 
side. 
These notions should constantly be reiterated by the 
teacher. They are the motivating and unifying prin- 
ciples. 
Laws of symbolic manipulation 
We have also fundamental rules or laws of symbolic 
manipulation. Their main function is to authorize 
certain special processes. They are well known and 
we will mention them without comment, merely calling 
attention to the advantage of a brief and simple pre- 
liminary statement or definition, even though it may 
not be completely accurate. These laws are: 
1. Tue Law or Equations: Whatever is done to one 
side of an equation must also be done to the other 
side. 
2. Tae Law or Siens: Hither in multiplying or di- 
viding, like signs give plus, and unlike signs give 
minus. 
8. Tue Suprraction Law: To subtract, change the 
signs and add. 
4. Taz Exponent Law: When two powers to the 
same base are to be multiplied, the exponent of the 
’ product is equal to the sum of the exponents; when 
they are to be divided, the exponent of the quotient is 
equal to the difference of the exponents. 
5. To Remove ParEenTHESES PRECEDED BY A

be traced to the neglect of the “fundamental notions”

student has acquired at least a few of these notions, no 
motivating interest can reasonably be expected from 
him, no matter how well the laws are illustrated or the 
fundamental devices are introduced and presented. 
He sees no reason for exerting himself.

CHAPTER III 
THE INTRODUCTION OF SYMBOLIC NOTATION AND 
ITS USE e 
The meaning and use of symbols 
Brewners find great difficulty in realizing that the 
operating signs —, +, X, +, etc., can be used to repre- 
sent many different words and meanings in various 
problems. In their case operating symbols are to a 
great extent abstract, and consequently of little assist- 
ance in the solution of problems. Beginners also fail 
to realize that the letters used represent numbers. 
For these reasons our next discussion will aim to make 
clear the use of symbols as well as to show the use of 
mathematics. 
Classroom presentation. My purpose to-day is to 
show one of the methods used in the solution of pro- 
blems. We may call it the symbolic method. 
A symbol is a sign which stands for a number, a 
word, or a thought. We use symbols because they 
make our work easier and save space. Thus, instead 
of writing one hundred and thirty-seven dollars and 
sixty-five cents, we write $137.65. If we were told to 
multiply seven hundred and sixty-two by three hun- 
dred and fifty-one, we would write it this way: 
7162 
X 351 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  36 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
The figures 762 and 351 stand for the words seven 
hundred and sixty-two and three hundred and fifty- 
one respectively, and the sign X stands for the words 
multiply by. We took our written directions and 
translated them into symbols. Why? Because it is 
easy to multiply with figures, while it would be very 
difficult to multiply if we had to use words only. The 
result of the multiplication is also obtained in figure 
symbols which can be translated back into words 
whenever we choose. 
Problem-solving in mathematics is performed in the 
same way. We take word-problems, we assign sym- 
bols to the quantities and relations described. Then 
we manipulate the symbols so as to obtain the result 
that we desire. By quantity is meant anything that 
can be measured, anything that can be increased or 
decreased, such as length, period of time, area, volume, 
cost, ete. 
When we have a problem to solve, we first resolve 
what is to be done; we form a plan of action. After 
this we apply such rules and processes as we know to 
what is given: the numbers, relations, and quantities. 
When we cannot solve a problem, it is always because 
we cannot see our way clearly; we do not know where 
to begin and what todo. That is, we have no definite 
plan of action. 
You should keep in mind the fact that every pro- 
blem contains the suggestion of the plan of solu- 
tion. Unfortunately, this suggestion is often hard
-P-A-G-E-55
INTRODUCING SYMBOLIC NOTATION = 87 
to find, being mixed up with other words and sen- 
tences. 
In order to find it, it is usually advisable to remove 
this unnecessary matter, to husk the problem. After 
this you can rewrite it in fewer or different words that 
are more significant. 
Example. From a cylindrical tank, half full of 
crude oil, 100 gallons are removed and 36 gallons are 
lost by evaporation and leakage. The tank is then one 
third full. How much does it hold when full? 
You should always read the problem carefully and 
try to guess the probable answer. This is very im- 
portant, because you can usually guess fairly close to 
the right answer, thus getting a check on your work in 
case you should obtain some absurd result through 
some mistake in calculation. Besides, you will thus 
learn exactly how much you can trust to your guessing 
ability. The tank looks as if it would hold about 800 
gallons. 
On re-reading the problem, you decide that the 
words cylindrical, crude oil, by evaporation and leakage, 
are not necessary to the solution. They distract your 
attention from the main points. Also you can com- 
bine the amounts removed: 100 and 36. You then 
rewrite: 
From a tank one half full, 186 gallons are removed, 
leaving it one third full. How much does it hold when 
full? 
It is clear that you obtain a better view of the pro-
-P-A-G-E-56
8 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
blem when it is in this form. The solution is easier 
because you can see some relation between the quan- 
tities. But suppose that you cannot see any plan of 
solution. In this case change the rewritten problem: | 
From one half of the tank 186 gallons are removed, 
leaving one third. 
Or, in a different way, using figure symbols: 
From 4 tank we take away 136, the result is 3 tank; 
or, 
%tank less 136 equals 4 tank; 
or, 
hi = 136 = ht. 
If you let the symbol ¢ stand for the number of gallons 
in the full tank, the symbol — stand for the words less, 
or take away, or are removed, the symbol = stand for the 
words equal, is the same as, leaving, or the result is, you 
have the problem in this form: 
41-186=41. 
The plan of solution is now obvious. The difference 
between one half and one third is one sixth. This 
sixth is equal to 136 gallons. Hence the whole, or six 
sixths, is 136 X 6, or 816 gallons, the capacity of the 
tank. The guess of 800 gallons shows that the answer 
is reasonable. 
One important point to note is that all the quan- 
tities in the statement showing the relations were 
gallons; that is: 
. ¥ tank (in gal.) less 136 gal. equals § tank (in gal.)
-P-A-G-E-57
INTRODUCING SYMBOLIC NOTATION 39 
‘ When we shortened the sentences into words, these 
words became symbols which represented the whole 
sentences. When we substituted signs such as — and 
= for the words are removed, or are taken away, or the 
result is, these signs became symbols which to us had 
a full meaning. We used symbols because, when the 
statement of the whole problem is reduced to a few 
letters or signs which show the operations to be per- 
formed, the plan becomes clearer. We know what to 
do. Solving the problem directly from the first state- 
ment was difficult. By rewriting it, without any great 
mental exertion we made an easy problem of it. 
The method illustrated above may be called the 
symbolic method of simplifying the problem by substi- 
tuting letters or figures for words representing quan- 
tities, and signs or symbols like — and = for words 
showing the relations existing between the quantities 
and the operations to be performed upon the quan- 
tities. 
You should note that the signs or symbols +, —, X, 
and the rest of the signs used in arithmetic are symbols 
for word directions telling you what to do with the 
numbers or quantities. Also note that they may be 
made to represent many operations described in differ- 
ent words. Thus, the sign or symbol — may stand for 
minus, less, take away, subtract, diminish, decrease by, 
1The words sign and symbol are repeated together in order to 
make the meaning of the rather unfamiliar word symbol clear to the 
learner. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA _ 
remove, go down, to the left, backward, and other words 
having similar meanings. 
In like manner the sign or symbol + may stand for 
plus, add, and, increase, increased by, go ahead, to the 
right, go up. 
And the symbol = may stand for the following 
meanings: equals, is the same as, is, what is left is, the 
result is, balances, gives, leaving, makes, and so on. 
The symbol + or / may stand for per, for each, divide 
by. 
You should make a list of the various meanings of 
these operating symbols from the problems that you 
solve, as you will find that when you recognize these 
phrases in problem statements they will become hints 
to solutions. That is, recognition of these words that 
ean be replaced by symbols greatly facilitates the 
translation of verbal into symbolic statements. 
We begin to see how mathematics is applied to the 
solution of problems. 
1. Every problem may be considered as a statement 
or a group of statements, or as a description of 
some situation. 
2. We translate such verbal statements into sym- 
bolic statements, which show at once the rela- 
tions between the quantities described, and also 
the operations which must be performed. 
3. We then manipulate these symbols for the pur- 
pose of obtaining a numerical solution.
-P-A-G-E-59
   INTRODUCING SYMBOLIC NOTATION 41 
Discussion. The estimate of the answer should be 
insisted upon. Its value is great in the beginning 
of the term for the following reasons: 
1. It obliges the pupil to read the problem atten- 
tively at least twice. This increases the chances 
of solution. 
2. It promotes habits of suspended judgment by 
showing him that his guess is of little value. It 
weakens his complacent attitude. 
8. It livens the class-work. The various guesses, all 
tabulated on the blackboard, arouse a great deal 
of interest. 
4, It is excellent practice in perceiving relations be- 
tween magnitudes or between parts of figures. 
5. It develops the ability to grasp a situation as a 
whole. 
Rewriting and restating a problem, dividing it into 
separate statements, is a very valuable classroom de- 
vice, which will be used throughout this book. Re- 
stating a problem, rearranging the words, taking out 
the unnecessary words, introducing new and more 
significant words, all provide a good form of exercise in 
language and thought training. These processes pro- 
mote valuable habits of precise thinking and word 
analysis. It stands to reason that before expressing 
relations by means of symbols, it is necessary to ex- 
press them in English. 
The setting of a problem, that which makes it inter- 
esting by showing its relation to life, becomes an ob-
-P-A-G-E-60
42 'TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
struction to solution as soon as it has served its moti- 
vating purpose. The unnecessary details distract at- 
tention. That which is material is obscured by that 
which isirrelevant. The teacher cannot pay too much 
attention to this apparently small point. The pupils 
should be trained to discover the important points and 
to eliminate the non-essential. 
This is one of the reasons why textbooks in “practi- 
cal” mathematics produce such poor results. The 
students pay more attention to the setting than they 
do to the method of solution. Diagrams and sketches 
are also bewildering to the beginner until he is trained 
to isolate the particular part that is to be studied. 
For this reason elaborate drawings in mathematical 
textbooks should always be accompanied by a skeleton 
design which clearly brings out the essential points, 
lines, or angles. Training in abstraction should not be 
confined to words and sentences only. 
Giving various meanings to symbols will be found 
to be of great assistance in problem-solving. These 
meanings should be copied in large characters on a 
large sheet of paper which can be left in full sight of the 
class. Each pupil should be instructed to make a copy 
of it on a loose sheet of paper which should also contain 
a list of the important formulas and the skeleton of 
solution described later. 
Analysis of a problem from another point of view 
A problem contains two essential parts: a question,
-P-A-G-E-61
INTRODUCING SYMBOLIC NOTATION 43 
and the answer to the question. This answer is com- 
monly called the statement of the problem, the descrip- 
tion of the conditions, etc. In the final analysis it is 
only the distorted answer. An example will justify 
this statement: 
Question. What is the capacity of this tank in gal- 
lons? 
Answer. 840 gallons. 
Question. Same as above. 
Answer. One half of the tank contains 420 gallons. 
Question. Same as above. 
Answer, One sixth of the tank contains 140 gallons. 
Question. Same as above. 
Answer. One half of the tank less one third of the 
tank is 140 gallons. 
Question. Same as above. 
Answer. If from one half of the tank we take away 
140 gallons, what is left is one third of the 
tank. 
And the answers may become more and more com- 
plicated and distorted, and still remain answers. 
That is, we reach the same conclusion as before: 
The problem contains everything necessary for the 
answer. 
By a mathematical operation, then, we mean any 
process through which the answer is turned, rear- 
ranged, simplified, etc., until it becomes direct. The 
easiest way of obtaining this result is to put the an- 
swer in symbolie form, beeause symbols are easier to
-P-A-G-E-62
44 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
manipulate than thoughts. They can be written 
quickly and are amenable to definite laws. 
EXERCISES 
The following exercises provide practice in translation of word- 
statements into symbolic statements. They also aim to motivate 
the symbolic manipulation drills given later. For this reason the 
students should be told that solutions need not be obtained. They 
should also be directed to rewrite the statements if necessary and to 
use the list of symbol meanings given in this chapter.

  CHAPTER IV 
INTRODUCTION TO THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 
The balance method 
Tue balance method, or the use of the balance in in- 
troducing the concept of the equation and its law, is 
excellent. It is fundamentally sound, because it com- 
pares the equation to a familiar object, and associates 
it with a fact that every child knows — that a change 
on one side of the balance must be accompanied by a 
corresponding change on the other, if equilibrium and 
equality are maintained. The method of presentation 
is well described in several modern textbooks. One 
reason for describing it in detail in this chapter is that 
the addition of the simplification-of-statement process 
and of the short statement of the Equation Law to the 
usual balance method produce somewhat better results 
than the customary procedure. 
Besides the balance method the reader will find four 
other methods of establishing the equation concept. 
While these are inferior to the balance method, they 
are valuable in that they confirm and generalize the 
initially established notion that the symbol = stands 
for equality between the two sides of the equation. 
That is, the pupil learns that the symbol = means 
equality of such quantities as length, cost, volume, 
etc., as well as equality of weights. 
It is believed that the Equation Law is more com-
-P-A-G-E-66
  
  48 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
prehensible and serviceable when reduced to a short 
sentence than when expressed in the form of four 
axioms. Besides this, the author challenges the as- 
sumption that those axioms are self-evident to children 
of normal mentality. Many children no more know 
‘that things equal to the same thing are equal to each 
other, until they see it demonstrated and think it over, 
than they know that yellow and blue make green. In 
the short universal form here given the Law of the 
Equation becomes authority for all symbolic trans- 
formation processes from the simplest equation to the 
most difficult differentiation or integration. 
Classroom presentation. The following technique 
is used in explaining symbolic transformation in the 
early part of the subject: 
Example. 32+ '7 = 22; find the value of 2. 
Our purpose is to find the value of z. By this we 
mean that x shall be made to stand alone on one side 
of the equation. The other letters or numbers prevent 
this. Let us get rid of them. To get rid of them, we 
have to follow one rule, the Equation Law, which 
states that whatever we do to one side of the equation we 
must also do to the other. Now this 7 is in our way. 
We do not want it. Let us remove it. How? By 
taking 7 away from it. But the Law says that we 
must take away the same amount from the other side, 
lest the balance be destroyed. (Recall of fundamental 
concrete experience.)
-P-A-G-E-67
THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 49 
We want to get rid of this 3 which multiplies the x. 
Let us remove it. How can we do this? By dividing 
it by 3. But the Law states... and so on. 
. We use four methods for removing numbers that are 
in our way, according to the part that they play in the 
equation. How doI know which to use? I follow one 
rule: perform that operation which is opposite to the 
operation indicated by the sign connecting the unde- 
sired number. If this sign is —, I perform the opposite 
operation and add. If it is +, or not expressed, the 
sign + being understood, I subtract. If it is X, I 
divide, and if it is +, I multiply. 
That is, we have one law to obey, the Law of Equa- 
tion; and one rule to follow: to remove a number, per- 
form the operation opposite to the operation indicated 
in the expression. 
Discussion. This procedure should be adhered to 
until the children understand the routine perfectly. 
It may be found advisable to place the sign + before 
the first term and the sign X between factors until the 
operation is thoroughly understood. Otherwise, at 
the end of the course the teacher may still find some 
children who do not know how to:proceed. Constant 
repetition of essential processes of the above type is im~ 
perative. 
Example 1. Fig. 1 shows a balance. In one pan 
there are 5 large bolts. In the other pan there is a 
weight of 20 pounds. How much does each bolt 
weigh? Answer, 4 pounds.
-P-A-G-E-68
  
60 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA . 
How did you obtain this result? You divided 20 
by 5. Why? What you really did was to divide the 
weight of 5 bolts by 5 to obtain the weight of one bolt; 
  Ficure 1 
and to divide the number of pounds in the other scale 
pan by 5also. One bolt in the one pan now balances a 
weight of 4 pounds in the other pan. Having per- 
formed the same operation on the contents of each pan, 
you have not destroyed their balance. 
We may simplify our problem into one sentence 
which fully describes the situation: 
The weight of five bolts is twenty pounds. 
Or, in symbols, 
5b = 20, 
provided that we agree to have the symbol = mean 
balances, or have the same weight as, or equals; to have 
the symbols 5 and 20 stand for the words five and 
twenty, and the letter 6b stand for the number of pounds 
that each bolt weighs. Such a symbolic translation of 
a statement in which two expressions have the same
-P-A-G-E-69
THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 51 
value (in terms of some definite unit of measurement) 
is called an equation. It shows by means of symbols or 
signs the meaning of a word-statement. That is, it 
gives a clear, concise, usable expression of the situa- 
tion. It is useful because it shows at a glance what 
arithmetic or algebraic operations should be performed 
in order to obtain the result desired. In our problem 
the desired result is the weight of one bolt, or, symboli- 
cally, the value of b. 
5b= 20 
Wewant16. The factor 5 isnot wanted. Toremove 
it, we divide it by 5; that is, by the same number. 
But the moment we divide by 5 on one side, the bal- 
ance is destroyed; there is only one bolt left in the one 
pan, while the twenty pounds are still in the other pan. 
We must divide the 20 in the other pan by 5 also, or 
divide the other side of the equation by 5. The bal- 
ance or equality is then reéstablished. 
esa: or b=4 
which we translate back into words; one bolt weighs 
four pounds. 
This suggests a thought: Dividing each side of an 
equation by the same number does not destroy the 
equality. As this always holds true, we may consider 
it a rule. 
This rule, however, is only a partial application of
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
the following general rule which governs all the opera- 
tions performed on equations: 
Any operation performed upon one side of the equa- 
tion must also be performed upon the other side 
Or, Whatever is done to one side of the equation 
must also be done to the other side. Or, Like changes 
must be made on each side. The balance must be 
preserved. 
This is the fundamental rule or Law of Equations. 
All the other rules or laws are only partial applications 
to special cases. Thus we may say: If we add some 
number to one side of the equation, we must add the 
same number to the other side. If we multiply or 
divide one side of the equation by some number, we 
must multiply or divide the other side by the same 
number. If we subtract some amount from one side 
of the equation, we must subtract the same amount 
from the other side, and so on. 
  Ficure 2 
Example2. Fig. 2 shows some bolts of another kind 
being weighed. In one pan we have 5 bolts and a
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 53 
3-pound weight; in the other pan we have 18 pounds, 
How much does each bolt weigh? 
We first simplify the statement: 
The weight of 5 bolts and 3 pounds balances 18 pounds. 
Replacing by symbols, 
5b +38=18 
The 3 on the left side of the equation is in the way. 
The Law of Equations states that we can take away 
this 8, provided we also take away 3 from the other 
side. We choose then to take 3 away from each side; 
that is, to subtract 3 from each side. We have left, 
5b=15 
To get rid of the 5 we apply the law again and divide 
each side by 5. This gives us 
5b 15 bes 
which we can translate into words: One bolt weighs 
3 pounds. 
In order to make sure that we have the right result, 
we examine the statement of our problem. Each bolt 
weighs $ pounds. Five bolts weigh 15 pounds, 15 and 
3 balance 18 pounds. This is our check. 
The same method may be applied to other problems. 
Thus: 
Ezample 3. A man bought 6 hinges. He gave the
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
storekeeper 50 cents and received 2 cents in change. 
What was the cost of one hinge? Rewrite and 
simplify: 
50 cents have the same value as 6 hinges and 2 cents 
In symbols, 
50 = 6h + 2 
or, 
50=6h +2 
Taking 2 away from each side, 
  — Cae 
48=6h 
Dividing each side by 6, 
8=h 
Translating back into words: Eight cents is the cost 
of one hinge. 
Check. On re-reading the problem, we find that this 
value satisfies the given conditions. Six hinges, at 
eight cents each, and two cents, amount to fifty cents. 
Example 4. Thirteen nails are placed in a single 
line with the ends touching. The line lacks ten inches 
of being one yard long. How long is each nail? (One 
yard = 36 inches.) 
Rewrite and simplify: 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 55 
The length in inches of 13 nails and 10 in. make 36 in. 
In symbols, 
isa =F 10 = 36 
or, 
13 n+ 10 = 36 
Taking away 10 from each side and then dividing 
each side by 13 are evidently the next steps. You can 
see now that putting the problem into a symbolic form 
automatically gives you the plan of solution. The 
signs tell you what to do. 
Example 5. A bucket holds 21 pints of water. We 
fill a bottle 6 times from it and have 8 pints left in the 
bucket. How many pints does the bottle hold? 
Simplifying: 
The number of pints in 6 bottles and 8 pints is the 
number of pints in the bucket, 
66 + 3= 21 
or, 
6b+3=21 
The rest of the solution is as above. We subtract 3 
from each side, then divide each side by 6, the object 
being to get b alone on one side of the equation. 
Example 6. Fig. 3 shows 4 books (of equal weight) 
and 3 pounds in one pan of the scales, and 3 books of 
the same weight and 5 pounds in the other pan. How 
much does each book weigh?
-P-A-G-E-74
56 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
  Simplifying: 
4 books and 3 pounds balance 3 books and 5 pounds 
In symbols, 
4b + 3 = 86 + 5 
or, 
4b4+3=86+5 
Taking 3 b away from each side, gives us 
6+3=5 
Then taking 3 from each side leaves us 
b=2

Example. Fig. 4 shows a little emergency weigh- 
ing situation. The package p is too heavy to weigh 
on the scales directly. A beam 0 is used, one end of 
which rests on the block w and the other on the scales. 
  Ficurs 4 
The package is hung in the middle, so the scales 
show exactly one half of the weight of the package 
after the pressure due to the beam has been found to 
be 6 pounds. A weight of 26 pounds secures the 
balance. What is the weight of the package? (The 
weight of the beam is to be neglected.) 
Simplifying the statement: 
One half weight package and 6 Ib. bal. 26 Ib. 
or, 
3 P +6 =26 
or, 
£Ept+6=2%6 
Subtract 6 from each side, 
$ p= 20 
One half of the package weighs 20 pounds, how much
-P-A-G-E-76
  ‘68 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
does the whole package weigh? We all know the an- 
swer, but let us try to find it from the equation; be- 
cause, while we can solve an easy problem mentally 
without knowing exactly how we do it, when we have 
a more complicated problem we must have a method 
which we know will yield results. 
We must obtain p = 40. The only way in which we 
can obtain this is by multiplying each side by 2. 
Then: 
2X4p=2X2 or p=40 
Discussion. It becomes advisable now to assign 
drill problems. Good results can be obtained from 
these if the equations derived from the problems at the 
end of Chapter III are used, as the usefulness of the 
drill is thus emphasized. The pupils will form the all- 
important notion that an equation is only a symbolic 
form of a statement. It is suggested that at least a 
week be given to individual assistance during class 
periods, instead of the usual recitation procedure. 
The teacher will thus be enabled to judge the capaci- 
ties of the various individuals, and also the results of 
the presentation. 
Conditions essential to effective drill 
Additional drill exercises are not given here, as 
practically every textbook has this aspect of the sub- 
ject well organized. If anything, it is too well organ- 
ized, for too many exercises are given, some of which
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 59 
require an amount of time out of proportion to their 
usefulness. The important points here are the atti- 
tude toward the drill, the directions given, and the 
extent to which they are followed, and not the con- 
tents. If the child does not perceive the necessity for 
the drill, the facility acquired under compulsion is of 
doubtful value and easily lost. By significant drill, 
then, we mean a process during which the objective is 
constantly kept in mind and certain steps are mentally 
repeated. It is the lack of this mental recall that 
makes the average drill of so little value. The de- 
scription of a specific case will illustrate: 
Illustration of defective training 
Two high-school students were found to be unable to 
perceive how 
78 
22 
could be equal to 54. Searching questioning brought 
out the following facts: 
1. They had worked very many exercises in multi- 
plication of fractions in their earlier school work. 
These exercises were given in groups of twenty or 
more, speed being the main aim. 
2. They had solved very many reduction-to- 
improper-fraction examples, also in groups, also 
for speed. 
8. They could quote correctly the rules applied.
-P-A-G-E-78
  
60 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
But the three had been “learned” as separate units, 
and hence did not function together. 
The process involved was thoroughly explained to 
both students, beginning with the conception of the 
fraction, and a number of drill exercises were assigned 
them. Directions for mentally repeating the rule and 
the reason for the drill before starting each example 
were given. 
One of the students followed directions and later 
applied the same procedure to all drill work. Al- 
though rather dull, he acquired mastery over mathe- 
matical processes. The other student was not per- 
suaded that he needed to change his method of learn- 
ing. He handed in the examples, claiming that he had 
followed directions. Similar deficiencies in his mathe- 
matical training were found later and similar attempts 
were made to correct them, with similar results. He 
did the work by imitation and refused to think or to 
associate the process with the rule. Only his failure to 
obtain a passing grade brought him to reason. He 
then acknowledged his disregard of directions, and 
eventually became an enthusiastic and successful stu- 
dent of mathematics, which subject he had previously 
“hated.” 
An experiment in teaching mathematics 
The author does not believe in assigning drill in 
symbolic manipulation before showing how equations 
are derived from word-problems. He has taught one 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  
| THE EQUATION AND ITS LAW 61 
class the process of translation of word-problems into 
equations before teaching symbolic manipulation sys- 
tematically. It was quite interesting to observe how 
some students indicated the multiplication of mono- 
mials and binomials without the use of exponents and 
parentheses, and solved equations by improvised 
common-sense methods. i 
Eventually some of the boys complained and asked 
for systematic instruction in common processes. 
Some were even found to have learned the processes 
and drilled on them, without being taught and in addi- 
tion to the regular assignments. The class was evi- 
dently ripe for intensive drill work. A few words of 
instruction and directions as to how to obtain the best 
results from the drill were given, and the class started 
on the go-as-you-please plan. How they did cover the 
ground! It was not uncommon for the children to 
bring in several pages covered with examples, or even 
all the examples in a chapter. Drill under such condi- 
tions is a pleasure, as the child feels the satisfaction of 
overcoming a difficulty voluntarily, and is conscious of 
his growing power. The usual meaningless and ob- 
ligatory drill is drudgery. , « ? 
Kinds of drill 
Besides the well-known drill examples in simple and 
simultaneous equations, factoring, etc., given in mod- 
ern textbooks, valuable drills can be assigned in the 
following processes:
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
1. Drill in analysis of the situations described in the 
problems; in rejection of non-essentials; in reduc- 
tion to mathematical terms. 
This is especially valuable toward the end of the 
course, when practical problems are studied. A few 
days devoted to the examination of a large number of 
such problems without the actual solution will prove 
to be of inestimable value for rounding off the course in 
the case of pupils who will not take more mathematics, 
as well as for those who intend to pursue the study in 
higher branches. The latter will be ready to begin the 
next term’s work with the right attitude. It is some- 
times feasible to get assistance from the English de- 
partment in this kind of drill. 
2. Translation of statements into symbols, without 
complete solution. 
An example of this is given in the problems at the 
end of Chapter III. This should be given very early in 
the term. It has been found to be of high value in 
motivating the drill in simple and simultaneous equa- 
tions. 
8. Drill in finding implied statements, and in sepa- 
rating the problem into statements describing or 
relating the quantities. 
This will be described in Chapter VII.
-P-A-G-E-81
CHAPTER V 
THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS — SETTING VERSUS 
METHOD 
Simultaneous equations in the traditional arrange- 
ment and in modern procedure 
Trapvition places the study of the simultaneous 
equation in the middle of the one-year course, the vari- 
ous methods of solution being grouped together. 
This arrangement was logically correct when symbolic 
solution was taught before any problems were pre- 
sented. But this sequence causes considerable trouble 
in the earlier parts of the subject now that problems 
are presented from the first. Restriction to problems 
which can be expressed at once in one equation, com- 
bined with the unwise addition of difficult problems, 
has made teaching of these earlier parts arduous, dull, 
and discouraging. What teacher, when asked by the 
class to solve some complex problem by the one- 
equation method, has not wished for the simpler and 
more effective many-equation method! How often the 
time of a class has been wasted by fruitless efforts to 
“write down” an equation in terms of one unknown! 
Why is the comparison of ratios taught in the seventh 
grade considered too hard for high-school freshmen? 
Why is substituting on paper considered more diffi- 
cult than substituting mentally, as when the student is 
told to “express” the other unknowns in terms of one? 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
An experiment was recently conducted to test the 
soundness of the traditional sequence. Two classes of 
about the same average ability with the same teacher 
were taught, one in the usual sequence, while the other 
was introduced very early to simultaneous equations. 
It was soon found that the many-equation method was 
greatly superior in that it allowed the use of a larger 
number of illustrative problems. It was found espe- 
cially valuable in justifying the use of parentheses and 
in illustrating the change of signs in negative quan- 
tities inside of parentheses. It facilitated the work so 
much that by the end of the term one class led the 
other by so wide a margin in amount of ground covered 
and in thoroughness that even superior ability could 
not be claimed as the determining factor in the case. 
Argument for the early introduction of simultaneous 
equations 
A careful examination of most of the problems classi- 
fied as “simple-equation” problems will convince the 
reader that they are only simultaneous-equation pro- 
blems in disguise. They contain two or more separate 
statements. Solving such problems by using one un- 
known, and expressing the other unknowns at once in 
terms of that unknown in one equation, is a far more 
difficult process to learn than the substitution method 
of simultaneous equations, when one equation is writ- 
ten for each statement. 
Moreover, the latter method is the one used in
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 65 
formula work. Practical users of algebra naturally fall 
into the habit of writing down all of the equations and 
substituting into the most promising one. Why, then, 
teach a student a method which will not be used subse- 
quently, not even in his later study, when he has fully 
learned all the other methods of solution of simultane- 
ous equations? The most that can be said for it is that 
it is good mental training, the excuse usually given 
when no other excuse is available. 
Furthermore, if the student does not retain anything 
from his study of mathematics excepting a thorough 
understanding of the methods used in formula work, 
substitution, and evaluation, his time will not have 
been wholly wasted. An early introduction means, 
then, in the case of most students, a large amount of 
practice in these essential processes. 
Finally, the simultaneous-equation device is an inte- 
gral part of the functional method of solving problems. 
The traditional method of expressing all the unknowns 
in terms of one has probably been the means of pre- 
venting the development of this method. 
Besides mental training, the only strong argument in 
favor of the traditional sequence is that negative quan- 
tities must be studied before simultaneous equations. 
But even this is not a good argument, as the concept of 
the negative quantity is best acquired by seeing it 
used. It has been found that the formal study of 
negative numbers is easier after the idea has been in- 
formally acquired. :  
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
The pupil’s attitude toward academic problems 
Having justified the use of simultaneous equations 
near the beginning of the subject, we pass to another 
troublesome point, the attitude of children toward 
problems. 
At first the class will accept any kind of problem; 
then questions begin to arise. Is this what algebra is 
for? — to solve problems about clocks, railroad trains, 
ages of fathers and sons, or about capitalists who forget 
how much money they have invested and want to cal- 
culate it from the interest received? Truly the “life 
problems” given by most books are wonderful! If the 
teacher incautiously promises that presently the pro- 
blems will become more practical, he gets into deeper 
trouble, because some imp is sure to examine the back 
of the book and find that the problems there are of the 
same type, a little more complex, to be sure, but just as 
unpractical. 
Practical problems are unsuitable for beginners 
If in desperation the teacher turns to practical text- 
books, he finds that he has only jumped from the 
frying-pan into the fire. The problems there are too 
difficult for his class to solve. They necessitate a pro- 
cess of translation into mathematical language which 
ean be learned only through long practice and special 
training. If in spite of this he tries to teach their solu- 
tion by means of formulas, he will discover that at the 
end of the year the children can only solve problems of 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 67 
a very commonplace type. They have learned the 
problems, not a general method through which pro- 
blems are solved. 
Still, we can hardly blame children if they do not 
take much interest in problems of this sort: “One 
number is five times another, and their sum is thirty. 
Find the numbers.” The teacher does not obtain 
much help from textbooks when he tries to persuade 
children that such problems are necessary steps to 
more difficult problems, that they lead to real life 
problems, and that the method of solution is of far 
more importance than the wording of the problem. 
Very few textbooks attempt to show the method 
underlying the solution of word-problems. 
Changing the setting of a problem 
It will be shown later that, once certain fundamental 
relations between quantities are well understood by 
the teacher, he can easily give almost any problem in 
any book a convincingly practical setting. A few illus- 
trations of such transformations will be given occa- 
sionally in this book. These will usually show that the 
statement of one problem may be totally different 
from that of another, yet both problems be solved by 
identical methods, using identical coefficients. At the 
beginning of the term the following series usually con- 
vince pupils that the method of solution is of more 
importance than the verbal setting. 
Classroom presentation of various settings of one

problem. (Problems to be written on the black- 
board.) 
  ‘ Example 1. Fig. 5 shows a pocketknife open and 
closed. When it is open, the total distance between 
pin A and point Bis 7 inches. When closed, the dis- 
tance from point B to pin A is1linch. How long is the 
blade, and how far is it between pins A and C? 
This problem does not seem very useful or practical, 
but when we compare it with the next problem, we find 
that the method of solution is the same. The same 
problem is often used in mechanics; for instance, in the 
design of connecting rods and cranks of engines. 
Example 2. Find the lengths of the two links shown 
in Fig. 6. When the links are open (like an open 
pocketknife) the total length AB is 7 inches. When 
closed, the distance from A to B is 1 inch.
-P-A-G-E-87
  
THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 69 
Example 3. In a machine two forces act differently 
at different times, sometimes acting in the same direc- 
tion and sometimes oppositely. When acting to- 
gether, they exert a total force of 7 tons; when opposed 
their combined effect is 1 ton. Find the forces. 
  We may write another problem as follows, using the 
same figures and obtaining the same numerical result. 
Example 4. The sum of the ages of two children is 
% years; the difference between their ages is 1 year. 
What are their ages? 
It is clear that this problem can be stated in terms of 
any quantity, such as cost, speed, volume, etc. But 
finally we can write it thus: 
Example 5. The sum of two numbers is 7; their 
difference is 1. What are the numbers? 
This last problem is easily solved mentally. One of 
the numbers is 4 and the other 3. On looking over the 
preceding statements, we find that these numbers also 
satisfy the conditions described. Which of the pro-
-P-A-G-E-88
    
70 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
blems was easiest to solve? Why was it easiest? It 
was the easiest because it was stripped of attention- 
distracting details. In the last, how did you obtain 
the answer? You must have performed some mental 
computation or else guessed the answer. If you 
guessed, can the guessing method be applied to more 
complicated problems of the same type? Can it be 
applied, for instance, to: 
The cost of a motor-cycle with a side-car is $167, and 
the motor-cycle costs $53 more than the side-car. 
What is the cost of each? 
It is clear that this problem can be written thus: 
The sum of two numbers is 167 and their difference 
is 53. What are the numbers? 
In this form it is far easier of solution. We learn, 
then, that problems containing numbers only are the 
easiest to solve. We therefore conclude that, if we 
wish to learn to solve problems, the easiest way is first 
to learn the method of solution when numbers only are 
used, because we can direct all of our attention to the 
method, and no effort need be wasted on an irrelevant 
setting. 
Another illustration will now be given, of how pro- 
blems stated in different words and describing totally 
different situations are yet solved by exactly similar 
steps and yield the same numerical results. 
Example 1. A machinist wanted to find the weight 
of some large bolts and nuts. Not having any scales, 
he rigged up a balance as shown in Fig. 7a. Not hav-
-P-A-G-E-89
  
THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 71 
  Ficure 7a 
ing weights, he used a bag of nails which was known 
to weigh 3 pounds. After several trials he found that 
5 bolts balanced 4 nuts and'3 pounds. In another trial 
he found that 3 bolts and the 3-pound weight balanced 
8 nuts (Fig. 7b). Show how from these measurements 
he found the weights of the bolts and nuts. 
  Ficure 7b 
Solution: We find that we can make two statements 
about the quantities described (the weights of the 
bolts and nuts):
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
1. Five bolts balance four nuts and three pounds. 
Or, in symbols: 
5 6b = 4 on + 3 (1) 
2. Three bolts and three pounds balance three nuts. 
Or, 
Cr Ot ES = 3 n(2) 
Our purpose now is to combine these two equations 
in such a way that one of the unknowns is eliminated 
(got rid of). 
Dividing each side of (2) by 3, we have 
. b4+1=n 
Multiplying each side of this equation by 4, 
4b+4=4n 
Now we have a value of 4n. We can substitute this 
value of 4 7 in (1); that is, we can write 4 b + 4 instead 
of 4.n in (1), which then becomes 
5b=46+44+38 
or, 
5b=4b4+7 
Subtracting 4 b from each side of this equation we get 
b=7
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 3 
or, 1 bolt weighs 7 pounds. Using this value in (2), we 
have (since 8 bolts weigh 21 pounds), 
214+3=3n 
or, 1 nut weighs 8 pounds. 
Check: Substituting these values in (1), we have 
6X7=4X8+3 
This balances, showing that our solution is correct, 
for the equation is satisfied.

Ezample 2. A man had some copper tanks and dip- 
pers, as shown in Fig. 8. He wished to find how many
-P-A-G-E-92
  '%4 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
pints they would hold. The only accurately gauged 
implement that he had was a measure holding three 
pints. Using the dippers and measure, he found that 
tank A holds exactly the contents of three dippers, a, 
and three pints. In another trial he found that tank 
A could also be exactly filled with the contents of three 
dippers, 6. In a similar way tank B could be filled 
either with 5 dippers, a, or 4 dippers, b, and 3 pints. 
What are the capacities of the tanks and dippers? 
We find that we can make two sets of statements: 
1. Three dippers, a, and three pints fill tank A. 
Three dippers, 8, fill tank A. 
Since three dippers, a, and three pints or three dip- 
pers, 6, can fill the tank A, the total quantities must be 
the same; that is: 
Three dippers, a, and three pints equal three dip- 
pers, b. 
In symbols: 
‘$a+3=856 (1) 
2. Five dippers, a, fill the tank B. 
Four dippers, 6, and three pints fill tank B. 
As before, the two quantities are equal, since they each 
fill tank B. 
Five dippers, a, equal four dippers, b, and three pints. 
In symbols: 
5a=4b+8 (2) 
Comparing (1) and (2) with the equations of the pre-

ceding problem, we find that they are exactly alike, 
with the exception of the letters used. We can see 
that the solution can be obtained in an exactly similar 
way, and the same numbers will appear. That is, 
a= 1, and b= 8.

Example 8. A furniture man had some brass rods of 
two different lengths, a and 6. The only measuring 
implement at his disposal was the end edge of an 
envelope which he knew to be exactly three inches in 
width. In order to measure the rods he proceeded as 
follows: He placed the rods, a, as shown in Fig. 9, with 
the ends touching. He placed the rods, b, beside them. 
After several trials he found that three rods, a, and 
three inches were exactly of the same length as three 
rods, b. In another trial he found that five rods, a, 
measured exactly the same length as four rods, b, with 
three inches added. What was the length of the rods?

% inches long; rod 6 8 inches long. 
Example 4. A draftsman must design some gears in 
such a way that 3 revolutions of the first gear and 3 
teeth are equal to 3 revolutions of the second gear, 
and 5 revolutions of the first gear are equal to 4 revolu- 
tions of the second gear and 3 teeth. How many teeth 
must there be on each gear? 
The conditions and numbers are obviously so much 
like those of the preceding problems that no comment 
is needed. 
Example 5. Two boys went to a store to buy mar- 
bles. One found that he had paid 3 cents more for 
3 glass marbles than he had paid for 3 china marbles. 
The other boy found that he had paid 3 cents more for 
5 china marbles than he had paid for 4 glass marbles. 
Find the cost of each kind. 
Example 6. If you add 8 to three times a certain 
number, you get three times a certain other number, 
while five times the first gives three more than four 
times the second number. What are the numbers? 
These problems are placed together in order to show 
you: 
(1) That the mathematical process used in the solu- 
tion of a problem can be used in a large number 
of problems of the same type.
-P-A-G-E-95
THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 7 
(2) That the process used is important to you; not 
the particular result or terms used in the de- 
scription of the situation. 
(3) That number problems, not interesting, and ap- 
parently of no practical value whatever, are the 
easiest to solve and best show the method of 
solution. 
The best way to learn to solve problems then is to 
solve them in the following order: 
1. Number problems, without any distracting de- 
tails; for the sake of learning the method of solu- 
tion. 
2. Simple and perfectly understood situations, such 
as boys buying marbles. 
8. Everyday life situations of the kind that you 
understand fairly well, such as simple shop 
problems. 
4. Industrial problems. 
These are likely to contain technical terms about 
machinery or processes of manufacture. Unless these 
terms are thoroughly understood, you will have trouble 
in forming a clear enough idea of the situation to solve 
the problem. After you have solved it, you will find 
that you have spent much more effort on the industrial 
details than on the mathematics. Learn mathematics 
first, then learn the industrial applications of mathe- 
matics. Beginners cannot do both efficiently at the 
same time. Industrial problems are easily solved once 
the mathematical processes are so familiar that the en- 
tire attention can be focused on the industrial feature. ,
-P-A-G-E-96
    
78 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Discussion. Such problems have been found very 
effective in satisfying practical-minded boys. After 
seeing that the same method and the same equation 
will solve either a marble problem or a mechanic’s 
problem, they will cheerfully solve the problems usu- 
ally found in academic textbooks. The forbidden 
fruit, “practical” mathematics, will lose its fascina- 
tion. But the teacher must not be deceived into be- 
lieving that the fight is over. Once in a while dissatis- 
faction will reappear. For this reason, whenever he 
notices a problem that he can state in two or more 
different forms, using the same numbers and coeffi- 
cients, he should avail himself of the opportunity to 
impress on the class that the all-important thing is the 
method and not the setting. 
Objections to practical problems 
We begin to see now why machinery and process 
problems used in textbooks of “practical” mathe- 
matics are not well adapted to teaching mathematical 
processes. In them what is important is obscured by 
what is pedagogically unimportant. The measure- 
ments are not easy to visualize, for they usually in- 
volve quantities and technicalities beyond the know- 
ledge of the pupil. The whole situation does not easily 
lend itself to clear and accurate visualizing. Such 
problems require much time for realization of the situa- 
tion and thus leave a comparatively short time for the 
solution. But in order to learn mathematics, students
-P-A-G-E-97
  
THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS" 79 
should spend the larger part of their time in discover- 
ing and analyzing the relations among the quantities 
involved. Hence beginners need problems which 
bring mathematical relations among familiar quanti- 
ties to the foreground, not unfamiliar settings. It will 
be found that whatever success has been obtained by 
students using “ practical’? books has been obtained at 
an expense of time and effort entirely out of proportion 
to the results. The same results could have been ob- 
tained in a fraction of the time if some of the theoreti- 
cal aspects of the subject had first been examined and 
mastered. 
Good drill exercises in simultaneous equations can 
be found in any textbook, so none are presented here. 
It is suggested again that the two- or more-statement 
problems left unfinished at the end of Chapter III be 
used to motivate the drill work. 
Introduction to systematic methods of solving pro- 
blems 
In order to be of any constructive value, problem- 
solving should follow a definite procedure. The writ- 
ten work should show that the following steps have 
been consciously taken. 
1. The guess or estimate of the answer. 
2. The recognition of the quantities involved and 
of their units. 
8. The separation of the statement into partial 
statements relating the quantities or completely  
-P-A-G-E-98
  80 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
describing the quantities. (This will be more 
fully explained in Chapter VII.) 
4. Translation of the partial statements into symbols. 
5. Symbolic solution. 
6. Check. 
This is only a partial list of steps. Later a complete 
scheme of solution will be described. 
Problem 1. A machinist and his helper earned $264 
working together ona job. If the helper received four 
sevenths of what the machinist received, what was his 
share? 
Solution: 
Step 1. He received about $100. 
Step 2. The quantities involved are the dollars 
earned by each. The unit is one dollar. 
Step 3. Statements relating the quantities: 
A. The machinist and helper received $264. 
B. The helper’s share was four sevenths 
of the machinist’s. 
Step 4. Translation into symbolic form: 
“A” of Step 3 may be restated thus: the 
number of dollars received by the machinist 
and the number received by the helper add 
up to $264. Or, in symbolic form: 
$M + $H = $264 
Or simply, 
M+ H= 264 (1)
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 81 
Statement B of Step 3 may be translated 
directly into symbols: 
H=4/7M (2) 
Step 5. Symbolic solution: 
We take the value of H obtained in (2) 
and place it in (1), which becomes: 
M+ 4/7 M = 264 
11/7 M = 264 
Multiplying each side of this equation by 7, 
then dividing each side by 11 gives us: 
, _264X7 M= 
ll   
or M = 168 
Which we translate back into words: the 
machinist gets $168. 
By subtracting the value of M from 264, 
we obtain 96 for the helper’s share. 
Step 6. Check: 96 is 4/7 of 168. 
It should be noted that the two statements in Step 3 
are related by the fact that they are dealing with the 
same persons on the same job. That is, the equations 
are related by the fact that M and H have the same 
values in each. 
The second equation stated that H was 4/7 of M; 
that is, that H was the same thing as 4/7 M. There- 
fore 4/7 M can be written instead of H in the first

equation. This apparently simple thought causes 
trouble if left unexplained. 
Problem 2. John’s age exceeds Sam’s by 20 years. 
In 15 years he will be twice as old as Sam. Find the’ 
present age of each. 
Step 1. The estimate is that Sam is very young. 
Step 2. The quantities involved are the ages. The, 
unit is 1 year. 
Step 3. Statements relating the quantities: 
A. John’s age is greater than Sam’s by 20 
years. 
B. In 15 years John will be twice as old 
as Sam (is then). 
Step 4. Translation into symbols: ~ 
A. J=S+20 (1) 
B. J+15=2(S+15). 2) 
Step 5. Symbolic solution: 
Substituting the value of J given by (1) 
in (2): 
S+20+ 15=28+80 
Subtracting 30 from each side, then sub- 
tracting S from each side: 
5=8 
The age of Sam is 5 years; that of John 25 
years.
-P-A-G-E-101
  
Step 6. THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 83 
Check: In 15 years John will be 40 and Sam 
will be 20; that is, John will be twice as old 
asSam. This is the condition stated in the 
problem. 
Problem 3. Three boys sold tickets for a school play. 
Altogether they sold 372 tickets. The first boy sold 
147 more than the third, and the second 129 less than 
the first. 
Step 1. 
Step 2. 
Step 3. 
Step 4. 
Step 5. How many did each sell? 
We guess that the second and third boys 
sold about 100 each. 
The quantities involved are the numbers 
of tickets sold by each. The unit is 1 
ticket. 
Statements relating the quantities: 
A. Three boys, A, B, and C, sold 372 
tickets. 
B. The first boy, A, sold 147 more than 
the third boy, C. 
C. The second boy, B, sold 129 less than 
the first boy, A. 
Translation into symbols: 
A. A+ B+ C= 372 (1) 
B. A=C+147 (2) 
C. A-129= B (3) 
Symbolic solution. Our aim is to form an 
equation containing only one unknown. 
Let us then solve (2) and (8) for B and C 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  
  84 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
and substitute the values in (1). Subtract- 
ing 147 from each side of (2) gives us, 
A-147=(C, 
or, 
C= A-— 147 
(3) can be written, 
B= A— 129 
Substituting these values of C and B in (1), 
we have, 
A+ A—129+ A— 147 = 372 
Collecting terms: 
8 A — 276 = 372 
Adding 276 to each side: 
8 A = 648, and A = 216 
From this the other values, B and C, can 
‘ readily be obtained. 
' Step 6. Check as before.

CHAPTER VI 
PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 
The parenthesis symbol 
Tux parenthesis symbol offers some difficulty to be- 
ginners. The box device described will be found to be 
of great help to the teacher at this juncture. If we can 
connect the parenthesis notion to the idea of a package, 
bundle, or box full of quantities that must remain 
bound together so long as the symbol is present, and to 
the idea that the number outside multiplies every 
number inside the parenthesis, we have solved the 
hardest part of our problem. The examples also help 
the pupil to realize that he has used parentheses un- 
consciously in his everyday quantitative thinking. 
Classroom presentation. Example 1. It is often con- 
venient to subtract numbers while performing some 
other operation. Thus, if we had 9 pieces of wood 
each 1 foot, 11 inches long, what would be the total 
length? 
We may reduce to inches, then multiply the number 
of inches by 9, then divide by 12, obtaining 17 feet, 
8 inches for the total length. 
But it is shorter to reason thus: 
1 foot, 11 inches is one inch less than 2 feet; 9 times 2 
is 18, subtract 9 inches. We obtain 17 feet, 3 inches. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
This can be performed mentally. Symbolically we 
would show it thus: 
9X (2’— 1") = 18-9" 
= 17'+12”-9” 
= 17+ 8" 
Or we may do it this way: 
gi—y" 
x9 
18’ ak of 
The symbol ( ) is called a “parenthesis.” It 
means that the terms inside of it act together as a 
single term so far as the other terms in an equation are 
concerned. It is plain that 2’ — 1’’ must be considered 
as one quantity, since it takes both of the numbers to 
stand for the length of one board. The 9 multiplies 
the 2’ and also multiplies the — 1’. That is, we may 
say that the 9 outside multiplies every term inside. 
9X (2’—- 1") =9X2—-1"x9 
We should notice also that the feet are measured in 
one direction, while the inches are measured in the op- 
posite direction. We add all the feet and subtract all 
the inches. 
We may compare the parenthesis to a box or bundle 
of quantities tied together for more convenient hand- 
ling. Thus, suppose that we have 5 boxes and that 
each box contained 4 apples and 7 pears. How many 
apples and how many pears would we have?
-P-A-G-E-107
PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 89 
We would show the situation thus: 
5X (4a+7p) or 5(4a+7p) 
and we would know that the last expression is equal to 
20a+35p. That is, 
5 (4a+ 7 p) = 20a+ 35 p 
The parenthesis symbol is used whenever two or 
more quantities must be considered as acting as one 
whole in a statement. Although the student may not 
be aware of it, he has often used the parenthesis prin- 
ciple in his everyday calculations. Thus, let us sup- 
pose that’some boys have sold tickets for a school en- 
tertainment at 25 cents a ticket. Sam sold 6, Fred 
sold 9, and Jim sold 9. How much money should they 
turn in? 
‘ 25 (6+9-+ 5) = 25 X 20 
= 500¢, or $5 
We add the number of tickets and multiply the 
result by 25. 
Example 2. What is the cost of 7 hammers at 95 
cents each? 
We may multiply on paper: 95 X 7, which would 
give $6.65, or we may say 95 cents is 5 cents less than 
one dollar, so the result is 35 cents less than $7. The 
symbolic way of showing the last operation would be: 
7(100—5) or 7X100-—7X5

Example 3. Five equal-sized bags of sugar weigh to- 
gether 36 pounds. Three of them are full, while 7 
pounds have been removed from each of the other two. 
What is the weight of one full bag? 
Rewriting and simplifying: 
8 full bags and 2 bags from which 7 pounds are re- 
moved weigh 36 pounds 
3b6+2(b— 7) = 36 
Removing the parenthesis, 
8b+2b—14= 36 
Simplifying, 
5b— 14= 36 
From which we obtain 
b=10 
Example 4. Seven castings in the rough and 15 
pounds balance 8 finished castings and 3 pounds. A 
finished casting weighs 7 pounds less than a rough 
casting. What is the weight of a rough casting? 
Simplifying, we have two statements: 
Statement 1: 
7 rough castings and 15 pounds balance 8 finished 
castings and 3 pounds 
or, 
YR+15=8F+38 ()

Symbolically,

or, 
F=R-7

8F=8(R-7) 
Substituting this value of 8 F into (1),

Example 5. A foreman gave an apprentice a rod and 
the following directions: “From this 16-foot board cut 
5 pieces as long as this rod, 4 pieces 1 inch longer, and 6 
pieces 1 inch shorter.” The length of the piece of 
board left uncut was 33 inches. How long was the 
rod? Simplifying the statement: 
5 pieces and 4 pieces 1 inch longer and 6 pieces 1 inch 
shorter and 33 inches make 192 inches. 
5p+4(p+1) +6 (p— 1) + 33 = 192
-P-A-G-E-110
92 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Removing parentheses, 
5pt+4p+4+6 p—6+33 = 192 
Combining, 
15 p+ 37 — 6 = 192 
15 p+ 31 = 192 
Taking 31 away from each side, then dividing each 
side by 15 gives p = 11’. 
Example 6. Two drums of equal size contain the 
same amount of gasoline. From one drum 37 gallons 
are drawn, and from the otker 7 gallons are drawn. 
The quantity remaining in one drum is now 7 times the 
quantity remaining in the other. How much did each 
drum contain at first? 
We can make this statement: 
The amount left in one drum is seven times the amount 
left in the other: 
D-7=17(D-— 87) 
or, 
D-T=7 D— %9 
and the rest of the solution is easy. 
Example 7. A man was hired for 26 days. Every 
day that he worked he was to receive $3, and every day 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 93 
he was idle he was to pay $1 for his board. At the end 
of the month he received $62. How many days did he 
work? 
We can make the following statement: 
The money earned, less the money paid for board, is 
$62. 
E-B=62 (1) 
The money that he earned was $3 multiplied by the 
number of days, or 3 N dollars, if N is the number of 
days. The number of days that he did not work is 
26— N. If he paid $1 for each idle day, he paid 
1X (26 — N) or simply (26— N). 
Substituting these two values into our first equation, 
we have: 
8 N—(26— N) = 62 
Or, removing the parenthesis, 
3 N—26+ N= 62 
For (26— N) means a number “ N less than 26.” 
Hence when we subtract the 26 we have subtracted N 
too much, and must, therefore, add it. 
Adding 26 to each side and combining 3 N and N, 
4N=88 or N=22 
We deduce the rule: To remove a parenthesis preceded 
by the — sign, change the sign before every term. The 
sign + inside the parenthesis is changed to —, and the
-P-A-G-E-112
  
94 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
sign — to-+. It should be kept in mind always that 
the first term inside the parenthesis is supposed to have 
the sign +, unless the sign — is shown. 
Drill exercises in nests of parentheses are not easy to 
justify, as textbooks do not give practical applications. 
The following example (which can be modified to con- 
tain more parentheses by adding more discounts) will 
be of assistance to the teacher if he finds it necessary to 
introduce nests of parentheses. 
Example. In answer to a query about the price of 
some machinery and tools, a shop man received a 
number of answers of the following type: “The cata- 
logue price of this machine is $214.35 less 35% and 
22% off, and 5% off for cash.” What is the net price 
of the machine? Work out a formula for solving 
quickly quotations of this sort. 
Solution: 
Instead of the price $214.35, let us use the symbol C. 
Then the net price is: 
(C — .85C) — 22 (C — 850) — 05 [(C—.85 C) — 22 (C —.350)] 
Since every term contains C, we can factor it out. 
We have then, 
Price = C [.65 — .22 X .65 — .05 (.65 — .22 X .65) ] (1) 
= C (.62— .05 X 52) or =C (.52— .026) 
= 214.35 X 494 
Equation (1) can be factored thus, 
P=C (1— .05) (.65 — .22 X .65)
-P-A-G-E-113
  
PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 95 
A little study of the formula shows how it can be 
applied to any discounts. The .05 does not need com- 
ment, nor does .22. The .65 is obviously 1.00 — .35. 
Negative numbers 
History tells us that the negative quantity was not 
used until the beginning of the seventeenth century. 
This fact of itself is sufficient evidence of the intrinsic 
difficulties involved in the conception of a negative 
number. These difficulties are responsible for a di- 
vergence of opinion as to the way in which the subject 
should be introduced and handled in an elementary 
course. The general consensus of opinion, founded on 
the experience of the last twenty years, seems to be 
that the best results are obtained by showing how 
negative numbers are used, and then showing why they 
are used. A satisfactory analysis of the fundamental 
principle or concept involved, through which an easy 
association could be made, apparently does not exist. 
Until one is made, we must remain satisfied with the 
present method. 
We may, however, analyze the weak points of the 
present method from a common-sense point of view, 
and suggest slightly more effective illustrations. It is 
believed that the two additional illustrations described 
in this chapter will be found of value in overcoming 
some of the initial difficulties.
-P-A-G-E-114
  
96 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Analysis of traditional illustrations 
Most textbooks show the use of negative numbers 
through the following illustrations: 
1. The thermometer, when the mercury is above or 
below zero. 
2. Financial situations, the negative sign indicating 
debts. 
8. A time scale, the eras A.D. and B.C. being used. 
4. A balloon pulling upward on some weight, or 
other opposing forces. 
5. A distance scale or a number scale. 
The first four are of doubtful value for the following 
reason: They try to create a mathematical notion by 
means of experiences or phenomena rather unfamiliar 
to most pupils. This may be more simply described as 
a process of founding deduction without perception. 
The inventors of these devices did not look at things 
from the child’s point of view, and did not, apparently, 
realize that the objects and situations that were con- 
crete to them were mainly abstract or even unknown 
to most of their pupils. Thus it was found by actual 
test that three fourths of the ninth-grade children in a 
Southern town could not remember ever having heard 
of a zero temperature; while one half of them did not 
know what a thermometer was, could not describe one, 
or did not understand how it worked. To illustrate an 
abstract idea through another abstract idea is not 
sound pedagogy. 
The same criticism applies with equal force to the
-P-A-G-E-115
  PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 97 
time scale, using years A.D. and B.C. It will be found 
that many children do not know nor understand 
clearly what these letters mean, or how they are used. 
The financial situation illustration is also weak be- 
cause children do not see the use of the symbolic nota- 
tion. To many of them debts of thousands of dollars 
are abstract things. The balloon illustration is weak 
for similar reasons. Most children’s conception of a 
balloon is that it is a large object that floats in the air. 
They have no knowledge that it pulls upward. Action 
and reaction are not usually known to them. 
The teacher is earnestly advised to make sure that 
explanations of fundamental notions do not them- 
selves need explaining. The excuse that physics or 
history is being taught at the same time by these 
methods invites the retort that it is difficult enough to 
teach fundamentals without burdening the process 
with attention-distracting details. Illustrative pro- 
blems should be carefully differentiated from problems 
showing applications. 
The distance and number scales are more concrete 
and can be understood by all, a point in favor of the 
device. But it is rather weak on account of its lack of 
practical application. The thought induced is, “Yes, 
we can see that we may describe this distance from a 
certain point as —3, but who ever does this?” 
The introduction of the concept 
After careful consideration of these objections to the  
-P-A-G-E-116
98 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
usual methods, it can be seen that problems showing 
the use of negative numbers should precede the usual 
formal introduction. Many interesting problems of 
this type can be found which require the methods of 
simultaneous equations; that is, which introduce nega- 
tive numbers in a natural way. Elimination by sub- 
stitution quickly teaches the use of parentheses. 
Whenever tried, this method has produced good re- 
sults. The children form the all-important notion 
that negative numbers and parentheses are used in 
problems. 
After these notions are acquired, it becomes neces- 
sary to organize the knowledge and to establish the 
few rules and laws governing the use of negative num- 
bers. We present this introduction in the form of a 
review followed by two illustrations carefully devised 
with due regard for the comprehension of the whole 
class. Going up or down stairs from a sidewalk, or the 
years before and after one was born, are situations 
which are thoroughly understood or readily visualized 
by every one. Such illustrations do not contain 
attention-distracting details; or, rather, the non- 
essential details disappear while the main principle 
remains in the foreground. It is advisable, then, to 
use these two devices first, to follow up with number 
and distance scales, and to wind up with the debts, 
Christian era, balloon, and thermometer devices. We 
cannot have too many illustrations.

old. i My father built this barn 5 years after I was 
born. How old is the barn? 
My father built this house 5 years before I was born. 
How old is the house? 
Why do you subtract 5 from 14 in the first case, and 
add 5 to 14 in the second case? 
What was the length of time between the building of 
the house and barn? Why do you add the two 5’s? 
My father will sell this house 5 years from now. 
How old will I be then? 
In all the above situations I began to count time 
from the day that Iwasborn. But time existed before 
that. So I count backward when I mention something 
that happened before my birth. If I put the years of 
my life on a line, as shown in Fig. 10, the beginning 
must be at “no years” or zero.

in Fig. 11:

In order to distinguish the years before my birth 
from the years after, to show on what side of zero they 
are, we will put the signs + and — before the numbers. 
Thus the present is the year + 14, the house will be
-P-A-G-E-118
  100 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
sold in the year + 19, the house was built in the year 
— 5, the barn was built in the year+ 5. It can readily 
be seen that time and space will be saved by the use of 
these symbols. The sign+ would stand for “after I 
was born,” and the sign — would stand for “before I 
was born.” 
The operations in the first part of the example would 
be shown thus: 
+14 My age 
+ 5 When the barn was built 
+ 9 This must be the age of the barn 
' We know that we must subtract + 5 in order to 
obtain +9. Symbolically this operation would be 
shown thus: . 
+14 
— (+ 5) (subtract + 5) 
+9 (for the result)   
Notice that we subtract when we want to find the 
number of years between two dates. 
In the second part of the example: 
+14 My age 
— 5 When the house was built 
+19 Must be obtained for the age of the house 
Here also we want the number of years between two 
dates; that is, we ought to subtract. Symbolically the 
operation would then look like this:
-P-A-G-E-119
  PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 101 
+14 
—(— 5) (subtract — 5) 
Ao 
But this, so far as the final result is concerned, is the 
same as: 
+14 
+54) 
+19 
You will observe that when I put a+ sign in front of 
a number to indicate the number of years after my 
birth, and when I put a — sign in front of a number to 
indicate the number of years before my birth, I have 
represented more than merely a number of years; that 
is, more than merely an amount or magnitude. Ihave 
added the idea of direction to the idea of magnitude. 
Thus + 5 does not merely represent a magnitude of 5 
units, but represents 5 units after, or, as we shall see 
later, it may represent 5 units more than, or 5 units 
above, or 5 units to the right of. Similarly, — 5 does not 
mean merely 5 units (magnitude), but means 5 units 
before (or less than, or below, or to the left of). 
You see, then, that the + sign and the — sign are 
used not only to indicate the operations of addition 
and subtraction, but also to indicate two opposite direc- 
tions or senses, as before and after, more than and less 
than, above and below, to the right of and to the left of ; and 
we shall find still other examples of such opposites. 
You will find that this new use of the + and — signs is
-P-A-G-E-120
   
102 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
very convenient and useful in solving certain kinds of 
problems. | 
After this we shall call numbers preceded by such a 
+ or — sign, indicating one of two opposite directions, 
signed numbers. ‘The ones preceded by a+ sign, mean- 
ing after zero or above zero, we shall call positive 
numbers; those preceded by a — sign, meaning before 
zero or below zero, we shall call negative numbers. 
A positive or a negative number gives both a magni- 
tude and a direction. 
The magnitude represented by a signed number is 
called its numerical value or its absolute value. Thus 
the absolute value of —5 (or of + 5) is 5. In arith- 
metic we use absolute values only. 
This last example leads to the following rule: 
To subtract a negative number gives the same result as 
adding the corresponding positive number; that is, the 
positive number having the same absolute value. 
Or, 
To subtract a negative number, change the sign and 
add. 
Example 2. Two trains start at the same time from 
the same station. One runs at the rate of 30 miles an 
hour, the other at the rate of 40 miles an hour. How 
far apart are they at the end of two hours? 
It is clear that we cannot answer the question until 
we know whether the trains are going in the same or in
-P-A-G-E-121
  PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 103 
opposite directions. Let us assume first that they are 
both going east, and that east is indicated by +. Then 
the station is the zero point on the number scale.

found thus:

This shows only the positions of the trains on the 
line, and we write the result because we can perceive it. 
We see that we have to subtract in order to obtain 10. 
The symbolic operation would be shown thus: 
+40 
— (+ 30) 
+10 
Suppose, however, that the trains had been going in 
opposite directions. The symbolic operation would 
then be slightly changed. The — sign before 30 would 
be showing the direction, while the — sign before the 
parenthesis would show that subtraction was required:

and again we should obtain the result: subtracting a 
negative quantity is the same as adding the corre- 
sponding positive quantity. Also the rule of subtrac- 
tion is confirmed: When subtracting, change the direc- 
tion sign, then add. ,

Example 3. Fig. 13 shows a sidewalk, with flights of 
steps running up and down from it. As in the time 
scale and the distance scale previously used, we may 
designate the sidewalk level by 0, the steps upward 
+1, +2, +3,...3; and steps downward — 1, — 2, 
— 3,... We may also represent walking up by the 
+ sign and walking down by the — sign. 
If a man starts at the sidewalk and walks up 5 steps, 
and then walks up 8 more steps, his final position is on 
step + 13. Symbolically this would be shown thus: 
+5+(+8)=+18 
If he walks down five steps (— 5), and then walks down 
eight more steps (— 8), he would find himself on step 
— 18. This would be shown thus: 
—5+(-8)=-18
-P-A-G-E-123
PARENTHESES AND NEGATIVE NUMBERS 105 
Observe that the words and then have been replaced 
by the symbol +, that is, by addition. Now if the man 
walks up five steps (+ 5), and then walks down eight 
steps (— 8) he would, of course, be on step — 3. Hence 
we write: 
+5+(-8)=-8 
Similarly we should find that 
-5+(48)=+38 
Such considerations lead to the rules: 
To add two positive numbers, add their absolute values 
and prefix the + sign. 
To add two negative numbers, add their absolute values 
and prefix the — sign. 
To add a negative and a positive number, take the 
difference of their absolute values and prefix the sign of 
the numerically greater number. 
These rules, combined with the rule for subtrac- 
tion — 
To subtract any number (positive or negative) change 
its sign (from + to —, or from — to +) and add 
— give all the rules necessary for the addition and sub- 
traction of signed numbers.

CHAPTER VII 
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT IN THE 
SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS 
Lack of system in the traditional method of solution 
Tue average pupil beginning the study of mathe- 
matics by the traditional method follows directions 
blindly for a while. He works at problems which 
apparently become more and more complex. To him 
each problem seems different from the one before and 
has to be attacked in a different way. He does not 
feel that his skill is increasing in any definite direction. 
He does not see that there is any definite method or 
objective in view. Sooner or later he asks the inevi- 
table question: What is the general method through 
which all classes of problems are solved? 
Some teachers never hear this question. They have 
never won the confidence of the students, or they have 
diverted attention from word-problems through drills 
in symbolic manipulation so long that the pupils have 
come to the conclusion that mathematics is the art of 
juggling symbols, and that word-problems partake of 
the nature of puzzles, to be solved by guessing meth- 
ods. This opinion is frequently shared by the teach- 
ers. They consider that a person who has attained 
great skill and speed in symbolic manipulation is a 
mathematician, even though this person is unable to
-P-A-G-E-125
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 107 
solve word-problems of moderate complexity, or to 
explain clearly the process used when he does solve 
them. 
The average teacher dislikes word-problems because 
he has to make sure of his solutions every time he 
assigns them. He must also make sure that he can 
explain clearly the various steps if the class should ask 
him. This is not always easy, as some problems, while 
readily solved by advanced methods, are not always 
simple of solution by the elementary methods at the 
disposal of the class. 
How do people solve problems? 
Is there a special mental process for each problem, or 
is there a systematic general procedure, with definite 
rules and a minimum of directed mental effort? 
A long investigation, during which many leading 
textbooks were examined, once led the author to the 
usual conclusion that there was not and could not be 
any system, and that mathematics did not have any 
general method through which problems could be 
solved. A few quotations will illustrate the usual 
directions for solving problems, as given in modern 
textbooks: 
. .. Indicate by means of algebraic signs, the same operations 
on the unknown quantities as would be necessary to verify 
the value of the unknown quantity, were such value 
known.... 
This sounds easy, until you try it. This author un-
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
fortunately forgot to illustrate his method by means of 
examples. 
... Denote the unknown number by a letter, then translate 
the verbal statement of the number relations into symbolic 
statement in equation form.... 
Evidently this writer never tried his method him- 
self, otherwise he would have discovered that the 
“number relation” is frequently implied and not 
directly stated. Thus, the problem: At what time 
after 3 o’clock are the hands of a watch at a right angle, 
is rather difficult to solve by this method. What is the 
verbal statement of the number relations? 
.- see clearly which things in the problem are known and 
which are unknown. ... By a careful study of the relations 
between the parts of the problem, express the word state- 
ment in algebraic form... . 
This last author cautiously adds: 
Sometimes this will mean an equation and sometimes not. 
Bese Seti by aay the problem, to write down an equa- 
tion. . 
Here is certainly a “gem of human thought”! This 
author has tersely described the “method” used by 
schoolboys (and many of their elders) for the last few 
centuries. This method was extensively used by the 
author in his youth. You read the problem, write 
down an equation, solve it, find that the result is not 
satisfactory, read the problem again, write down an- 
other equation, and so on, repeating the process until 
the right result is obtained. Then you write the steps
-P-A-G-E-127
  , 
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 109 
which you (should have) used, and finally you analyze 
the problem. People who have never tried the method 
can hardly realize how much easier it is to analyze a 
problem after it is solved! 
But most authors are more cautious and either con- 
fess inability to give clear, positive directions, or simply 
omit the subject. An algebra published in 1923 does 
not give any method of solution. The child is left to 
invent a system of his own. According to the induc- 
tive theory of learning, this should be easy: generalize 
after learning special instances and concrete examples. 
But how many do? 
The textbook writers, then, do not give any assist- 
ance whatever in the formation of an adequate plan of 
solution or of good habits of mathematical reasoning. 
They try to convince the children that mathematical 
skill can be acquired only through the solution of a 
large number of problems in some haphazard way. 
They offer exercises which give more practice in sym- 
bolic manipulation than is needed by any one not a 
professional mathematician, and teach symbolic opera- 
tions more complex than the average engineer will ever 
use. Then they call this meaningless collection of use- 
less devices mathematics, and claim that the study of 
it induces quantitative thinking! Will they ever learn 
that thinking about quantities and their relations is a pro- 
cess entirely different from the manipulation of symbols? 
This lamentable condition of affairs is due to the 
strongly entrenched traditional method which imposes
-P-A-G-E-128
  110 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
a definite procedure. The latter begins the study of 
simple equation problems thus, “Express the un- 
known by one of the last letters of the alphabet”; and 
winds up, “Express the other unknowns in terms of 
that unknown.” Under such conditions the transla- 
tion of a complex problem into symbolic form is no- 
thing short of an acrobatic performance. But this 
mental gymnastic feat is not needed. Neither is the 
skill developed through it used later, when simultane- 
ous equations force the use of more unknowns. It will 
be found that, if the idea of relationship (through the 
function concept) is properly utilized, problems can 
be solved by a general form of analysis with a min- 
imum of mental exertion and of time; while skill in 
solving problems increases definitely with every pro- 
blem solved. 
The lack of a unifying idea 
Lack of any observable system in solution is, then, 
one of the sources of dissatisfaction and loss of interest. 
Much trouble is also caused by the lack of a unifying 
idea, of a central core around which the subject can be 
grouped or organized. 
The National Committee on Mathematical Require- 
ments recommends: 
The one great idea which is best adapted to unify the 
course is that of the functional relation.... The primary 
and underlying principle of the course . . . should be the idea 
of relationship between variables. . . .*

-P-A-G-E-129
  THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 111 
In what way is it so valuable? How do you teach 
it? Modern textbooks are strangely silent on these 
points. 
One can hardly blame the authors. Information 
about the function concept in elementary mathe- 
matical education is meager, rather difficult to obtain, 
and still more difficult to understand or use after it is 
obtained. A few quotations from standard authorities 
follow: 
Teach the idea of relationship between variables. 
This authority has left the small details to the 
teacher. All that he has done is to furnish the inspira- 
tion. 
Lead the pupil to form the habit of thinking about the 
connections that exist between related quantities. 
Again no suggestions are given about the means to 
such a desirable end. 
Do not pass any instance in which one quantity is related 
to another without calling attention to the fact and trying 
to have the student “see how it works.” 
This last thinker is less reticent and gives more 
specific directions; but his directions are not very help- 
ful to the average teacher. 
The last two sentences of Chapter VII of the Report 
of the National Committee are illuminating: 
It is hoped that sufficient variety has been mentioned to 
demonstrate [to the teacher] the existence of functional ideas 
throughout elementary algebra and geometry. The com- 
   
-P-A-G-E-130
    
112 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
mittee feels that if this is recognized, algebra and geometry 
can be given new meanings to many children, and indeed to 
many educators, and that all students will be better able to 
control the actual relations which they meet in their own 
lives.* 
The use of the function concept 
The following pages will show: 
(1) In what way the function concept can be made 
the unifying idea of algebra. 
(2) How it can be explained in language so simple 
that the average pupil can understand it and 
utilize it to organize the various rules, devices, 
and processes around it. 
(3) That one of its chief values lies in the fact that it 
can be used systematically in the translation of 
problems into symbolic form. 
Through this fact we can develop a definite and gen- 
eral method of solving algebraic problems. By this 
method problem statements can be completely ana- 
lyzed and solved so far as obtaining the necessary 
equations are concerned, once the implied conditions 
are determined. In order to obtain this result, how- 
ever, it is necessary to alter some of the traditional 
methods and to establish what may well be considered 
one of the fundamental devices of mathematics: the 
recognition and use of what we have ventured to call 
“characteristic formulas.” 
1 Loe. cit, p. 73.
-P-A-G-E-131
  
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 113 
An analysis of problem relations 
Every problem consists of statements describing one 
or more “situations.” Each situation in a problem is 
described or characterized by a formula giving the 
fundamental relation connecting the quantities which 
are characteristic of this situation. An example will 
make clear our meaning. Consider the following 
problem: : 
A man has 22 minutes to go to the station, a distance 
of 2 miles. If he takes a car which travels at the rate 
of 1 mile in 8 minutes, at what distance from the sta- 
tion can he get out and walk, if he walks at the rate of 
1 mile in 16 minutes? 
In this problem we have two situations: the man 
walking and the man riding. The quantities entering 
each of these situations are: distance (d), time (¢), and 
rate (r). What we mean in this case by the character- 
istic formula — that is, the formula which character- 
izes or governs each of these situations — is the uni- 
form rate formula, d = rt. 
We must distinguish between two kinds of relations 
in problems involving more than one situation: 
1. Relations between the quantities in a given situa- 
tion. This is the kind of relation already referred to as 
the characteristic formula. It is never (or rarely) 
given in the statement of a problem. Moreover, this 
kind of relation is often between quantities having 
unlike dimensions; that is, between unlike quantities. 
Thus, d = rt, is a relation between distance, time, and
-P-A-G-E-132
  114 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
the rate, the latter being of the nature of distance per 
time. This is a functional relationship which gov- 
erns every situation involving motion at a constant 
rate. 
2. Relation between situations. This kind of relation 
connects like quantities in two or more situations. 
Such relations may be given explicitly in the statement 
of the problem or they may be implied therein. In the 
above example if we represent by capital letters (D, 
T, R) the quantities entering the “walking” situation 
and by small letters (d, ¢, 7) the quantities entering the 
“riding” situation, we have, in addition to the char- 
acteristic formulas D = RT and d = rt, the relations 
connecting like quantities in the two situations: the 
time spent in walking and riding is 22 minutes, 
T + ¢= 22; and the distance covered in walking and 
riding is two miles, D+d=2. It will be observed 
that these relations are implied in the statement of the 
problem, not explicitly given. 
In addition to these two kinds of relations between 
quantities, every problem contains statements giving 
the value of certain quantities. In our example, the 
walking rate is given as one sixteenth of a mile per 
minute (R = 1/16), the riding rate as one eighth of a 
mile per minute (7 = 1/8), the total time as 22 minutes 
and the total distance as 2 miles. This preliminary 
analysis has yielded a classification which will apply to 
a large variety, if not to all, problems met in elemen- 
tary algebra: 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 115 
The statement of a problem contains: 
I. Relations between quantities 
1. In a given situation — the characteristic 
formula, 
2. In different situations — connecting like 
quantities; 
a. explicitly given, 
b. implied. 
II. Quantities explicitly given. 
One more illustration may be useful at this point: 
On looking over a daybook we find the following 
items: John worked 3 days and Sam worked 4 days; 
amount paid to both, $18. John worked 4 days and 
Sam worked 3 days; amount paid to both, $17. At 
what rate of pay did each work? 
We have four situations, two describing John’s ac- 
tivities and two describing Sam’s. When we write 
8J+48=18 and 4J+3S=17, we have uncon- 
sciously used the characteristic formula: amount = 
rate X time, or A = RT; and the relation between the 
situations: amount earned by one + amount earned by 
the other = total amount. This problem is so simple 
that an elaborate analysis is unnecessary, but it serves 
to show that even to such simple problems the same 
principles apply. 
The formQ = NU. We have called attention to the 
fact that what we have called the characteristic for- 
mula of a situation is rarely given in the statement of a
-P-A-G-E-134
  
  116 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
problem. The pupil is supposed to know it and to 
recall it when needed. It is probably for this reason 
that the characteristic formulas which actually occur 
in problems found in elementary algebras are all of a 
very simple nature, and, indeed, are nearly all of the 
same form,Q= NU. That is, the great majority of 
situations which the pupil will meet in his study of 
elementary algebra are governed by a formula contain- 
ing three quantities and such that one of the quantities 
equals the product of the other two. In order to sub- 
stantiate this statement, a few of the most commonly 
met characteristic formulas will now be examined. 
1. The uniform motion formula. 
D=RT 
Here we have clearly the two quantities length and 
time; these two are related by R, the rate, which is a 
length per unit of time. 
2. The amount formula. (Amount produced or used 
at a uniform rate.) 
A=RT 
Here the amount and the time are two of the quan- 
tities. The rate is amount produced or used per unit 
of time. 
8. The cost formula. Total cost = cost of one article 
multiplied by the number of articles. 
C= RN
-P-A-G-E-135
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 117 
4. The interest formula. Interest = Rate multiplied 
by principal. 
I= RP 
It is clear that many of the special formulas used in 
science and the arts are also of this form. Thus we 
have in hydraulics, @ = AV; in the machine shop, the 
cutting speed-gear-belting formula, S=CN; the 
weight formula, the length formula, ete. In physics 
we have the moment of force formula, the work 
formula, etc. 
A fundamental principle — The characteristic formula 
The general principle which we desire to emphasize 
primarily in the preceding discussion may be formu- 
lated as follows: 
Every situation in a problem is governed by a char- 
acteristic formula. The recognition of such situations 
and of their characteristic formulas is essential to the 
understanding and solution of the problem. 
The use of this fundamental principle will become 
clearer to the reader after he has seen it applied to the 
illustrative problems later in this chapter. He will 
then perceive the great simplification in the problem- 
solving process and the definiteness of the method of 
attack which it gives. He will also perceive that in- 
complete realization or ignorance of the existence of 
the characteristic formula is the main cause of the  
-P-A-G-E-136
  118 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
trouble that our children experience in their quantita- 
tive thinking. Teachers know that many children are 
never sure when solving a problem whether to multiply 
or to divide one particular number by some other 
number. The difficulty is due to the fact that they are 
not taught consciously the three aspects of the char- 
acteristic form, which we have cited: 
Q= NU, v-% and u-%. 
But, until we acquire in some way the habit of using 
various special instances of this form in their three 
aspects, until we realize that every quantity in each 
situation must be recognized whether or not it is men- 
tioned in the statement, no real progress in mathe- 
matics can be expected. If mathematics is studied 
without a realization of this general principle, problems 
are solved, to be sure, but many apparently unrelated 
rules have to be learned, to be applied to as many ap- 
parently different cases; that is, we use mathematics in 
the solution of problems, but we use it empirically, 
without any insight into the underlying general prin-' 
ciple. On the other hand, if this principle is learned 
consciously, with full knowledge of the interrelation of 
the various formulas and of their dependence on the 
general unifying idea, control over problem-solving 
processes is obtained in a fraction of the time needed 
for the disorganized method used at present. It will 
be found that the use of the function concept in solving
-P-A-G-E-137
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 119 
problems, through its continual use of the character- 
istic formula, very quickly gives a mastery over the 
latter. 
After the children have realized that problems are 
amenable to this principle, that each element in the 
characteristic formulas plays a definite réle in the solu- 
tion of problems, and hence that problem-solution fol- 
lows a definite procedure, they become more willing to 
drill on any kind of problem, because they discover 
that skill acquired in the solution of one kind of pro- 
blem can be transferred or utilized in solving problems 
of some other type. This should be frequently empha- 
sized by the teacher, as he will find that such a realiza- 
tion is of great assistance in maintaining interest. 
The following illustrates the actual procedure used 
in introducing the function concept to a class of fresh- 
men, about one month after the beginning of the term. 
The previous instruction had been part individual and 
part recitation, with some five-minute talks at the be- 
ginning of the periods. These lectures were immedi- 
ately followed by quizzes about the topics presented. 
This method secured intense attention for a few min- 
utes. The home work following this particular lecture 
consisted of the complete analysis of one out of three 
problems and translation of the statements into sym- 
bols. The symbolic solution was not required, as the 
class was not sufficiently advanced for some of the 
steps requiring the use of parentheses, the negative 
quantity, etc.

The function notion. Classroom presentation. To- 
day we shall examine a notion which is very useful in 
the solution of problems. 
Whenever you have a perplexing situation, when- 
ever you are stopped or delayed in some activity by a 
condition of affairs that you do not understand, but 
that you must know about in order to bring about 
some desired result, you have a problem. d 
Thus you have conduct problems, health problems, 
and civic problems. Your subsequent actions are de- 
termined by your selection of a plan of action out of the 
several suggested by the situation. 
When your problem contains numbers and quan- 
tities or magnitudes such as length, weight, power, 
cost, and so on, it is a quantitative problem, or, as we 
say, a mathematical problem. Its solution is obtained 
by following a plan of action suggested by the state- 
ment. This statement is often the disarranged de- 
scription of one or more situations.!_ This description 
does not necessarily give everything in the best pos- 
sible shape for the mathematical solution. It may 
contain unnecessary material, and it may be incom- 
plete, some additional statements being implied (hid- 
den). But it must always contain these elements: 
1. The question; 
2. Some numbers and quantities; 
38. A relation or relations between the quantities. 
1 See the tank-problem discussion in Chapter II. 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 121 
To us the most important element is the third. 
Problems deal with quantities that are related; that is: 
(Write on the blackboard.) 
The quantities described in the problem are related in 
some way or ways 
They have something in common. They are con- 
nected with each other by means of this something, 
this relation. By means of this they may be compared 
with each other. The problem can always be re- 
written into separate statements about the quantities. 
These statements are of two types: 
1. Some completely describe a quantity. Thus: 
His rate is 10 miles per hour. R= 10. 
2. Some describe the relation between like quan- 
tities. Thus: The distance traveled by A was 10 
miles more than the distance traveled by B. 
A=B+10. 
Both types of statements can be translated into 
equations. If'we have enough of these equations, the 
solution can generally be obtained by well-known 
processes. 
The vital importance of the notion that quantities 
are related can now be seen. Let us always keep in 
mind: (Write on the blackboard.) 
1. That the problem contains quantities; 
2. That the quantities must be related;  
-P-A-G-E-140
  122 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
8. That these relations can be expressed in state- 
ments; 
4. That the statements can be translated into equa- 
tions; 
5. That some of the quantities are completely de- 
scribed in one statement (are given), while other 
statements describe the relation between like 
quantities; 
6. That some of the relations are assumed to be so 
well known and obvious that they are not given 
in the statement. 
We have, then, a definite plan in our mind when 
we attack a problem. The problem is already half 
solved! 
If we cannot perceive any relations between like 
quantities involved in the problem, then either: 
1. It is impossible to solve the problem; or 
2. Some of the quantities are not necessary to the 
solution. 
Example 1. Tf, in a broad jump, a boy can jump 15 
feet when he takes a running start of 30 feet, how far 
can he jump with a running start of 300 feet? 
To us the 800 feet is a useless quantity, because we 
know that, beyond a certain distance, the running 
start does not affect the distance jumped. That is the 
quantity 300 feet is useless because it is not related to 
the 15 feet. The problem cannot be solved by mathe-
-P-A-G-E-141
   THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 123 
matical methods because the relation between the 
quantities described is not known. 
Example 2. If a farmer obtains a $300 crop from one 
acre of fruit trees planted 20 feet apart, how much 
would he obtain from the same acre if the trees were 
planted 2 feet apart? 
We know that trees only 2 feet apart would interfere 
with each other’s growth. But we do not know to 
what extent this interference would affect the crop. 
That is, the needed relation is not given or implied in 
the statement nor do we know it, and we cannot solve 
the problem. 
Example 8. What is the unit stress at the base of a 
brick wall 18 inches thick and 50 feet high, if brick 
weighs 125 pounds per cubic foot? 
The unit stress is the stress per unit of surface, per 
square inch or square foot. The 18 inches is not a 
necessary quantity, is not related to the unit stress, 
and the problem can be solved without using it. 
The problems that will be given you in this course 
contain all the relations necessary for solution. Some- 
times they are given directly; sometimes they are im- 
plied and must be discovered. Usually restatements 
have to be made before these statements can be 
translated into equations. 
We shall now solve a few problems for the purpose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
124 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
illustrating the use of the relation idea in the system- 
atic solution of problems. 
Example 1. A man has 22 minutes to get to the sta- 
tion, a distance of 2 miles. If he takes a car which 
travels at the rate of 1 mile in 8 minutes, at what dis- 
tance from the station can he get out and walk, if he 
walks at the rate of 1 mile in 16 minutes? 
Analysis: The relation idea suggests that the quan- 
tities are related. What are the quantities? How are 
they related? What are the units in terms of which 
they are described? This problem contains two situa- 
tions: the man walking (Situation 1) and the man 
riding (Situation 2). 
We find statements about distance, rate, and time. 
The units are miles, minutes, and miles per minute. 
Statements about the quantities: 
1. The distance that he walks and rides is two miles. 
(Relating two like quantities, distances, in the 
two situations.) 
2. The walking rate is 1 mile in 16 minutes, or 1/16 
of a mile in 1 minute. (A complete description, 
belonging to Situation 1.) 
3. The riding rate is 1 mile in 8 minutes, or 1/8 of a 
mile in 1 minute. (A complete description, be- 
longing to Situation 2.) 
4. The time spent in walking and riding is 22 min- 
utes. (Relating two like quantities, time, in the 
two situations.)
-P-A-G-E-143

  THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 125 
Translation into symbols: 
Let the capital letters refer to the walking (Situation 
1), and the lower-case type to the riding (Situation 2). 
D+d=2 (1) 
1 1 
167 5 (2) and (3) 
T+t=22 (4) 
We have used all the relations described in the state- 
ment. It is clear that, since we cannot use R and r 
directly in (1) and (4), we have to change them to some 
form that we can use. We must then go beyond the 
data given in the statement. We must find some con- 
nection between R and r and the other quantities. 
Such a connection is supplied by a formula which be- 
longs to the situation we are talking about. In this 
particular problem it is the well-known uniform mo- 
tion formula: distance = rate X time. This formula 
has three aspects: 
d d d=rt,r=~ andt=; t te 
Symbolic solution: 
Applying the second aspect to (2) and (3) we have: 
pee ead R= pandr=7 
and 
d 
o- and + ole Oi 
or, 
16 D= T and8d=t
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Substituting these values in (4) we obtain:, 
16 D+8d= 22 (5) 
Multiplying each side of (1) by 8 and subtracting the 
resulting equation from (5), 
8D=6 or D=3/4 
The man may walk three fourths of a mile. 
We should specially note that a statement giving a 
relation, before it can be reduced to the symbolic form, 
must deal with quantities having the same unit of 
measurement on both sides of the equation. 
We had in (4): 
Time (in min.) + time (in min.) = total time (in min.). 
And in (1): 
Dist. (in mi.) + dist. (in mi.) = total dist. (in mi.). 
That is, we cannot have: 
time + distance = time 
And we cannot have an equation of this type: 
3 hours + 17 minutes = 20 minutes 
In short: The quantities to be added or subtracted in 
a statement must be of the same kind and expressed in 
terms of the same unit. Oversight of this rule is a 
fruitful source of error.
-P-A-G-E-145
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 197 
The relation diagram 
The reader has probably noticed the peculiar ar- 
rangement of the Equations (1) to (4). Inserting 
the signs X and = in the proper places we obtain the 
“relation diagram”: (Read D = RT and d = rt verti- 
cally.) 
D+d=2 
t Ml 
1/lé=R r=1/8 
xs 
T +t= 22 
When the two characteristic formulas are placed as 
shown, and the diagram is read vertically as well as 
horizontally, the arrangement shows clearly the way in 
which the two situations are related and illustrates the 
two types of relations. That is, the diagram not only 
shows how the quantities are related in the character- 
istic formulas of their own situations, but also how they 
are related to the like quantities of the other situation. 
This diagram is, then, a complete translation of the 
problem into mathematical symbols. Jé contains 
everything given and implied in the statement. Once 
every quantity is related to another quantity of the 
same kind or completely described (given), we are 
ready for the well-known substitution and elimination 
process. On the other hand, there is little use in start- 
ing the symbolic solution before every quantity is 
described or related; that is, the diagram automat- 
ically indicates any missing relation. This latter is
-P-A-G-E-146
  128 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
usually found to be implied somewhere in the state- 
ment,! 
Another important feature is that the diagram, 
when completed, shows clearly the plan of solution. 
The latter is best carried out by eliminating the sym- 
bols of quantity before substituting the numerical 
values in the final equation. In the above problem we 
eliminate the 7’s by substituting their numerical values 
in the characteristic formula r = d/t. After this we 
have a choice between eliminating either the ?’s or the 
d’s, leaving two equations and two unknowns. 
As the great majority of the situations found in our 
algebra problems are governed by relations of the 
form Q = NU,? the method described is practically a 
general method of solution. A systematic and definite 
procedure is followed which can be divided into the 
following steps: 
Step 1. We examine the problem with the object of 
finding the quantities involved and the way 
in which they are related. Words like dis- 
tance, time, cost, etc., immediately give 
1 See the clock problem, farther on in this chapter, for an illustra- 
tion of a missing relation found through the use of the diagram. 
2 Editor’s note: A caution may, however, be in order here. Care 
should be taken that students do not gain the impression that all 
characteristic formulas are of the form Q= NU. We need only 
think of the formulas for the area of a circle or square, the volume 
of a cube, the distance traversed by a falling body, the strength of a 
beam, etc., to realize that many characteristic functional relation- 
ships are not of the simple linear form. The development of the 
ability to think quantitatively involves the ability to recognize dif- 
ferent forms of functional relation.

Step 2. 
Step 3. 
Step 4. 
Step 5. us a suggestion of the type of character- 
istic formula required. The function con- 
cept is recalled every time this step is 
made. 
We write the characteristic formulas (verti- 
cally), using capitals for one situation, and 
lower-case letters for the other, or letters 
with subscripts. 
We examine the problem again and find the 
quantities fully described and the state- 
ments showing the relations between like 
quantities in the two situations. 
These steps constitute the analysis of the 
problem. 
We translate the statements found in Step 3 
into equations, which we write in our rela- 
tion diagram. An examination of the dia- 
gram shows when the problem is ready for 
symbolic solution. This occurs when every 
quantity is either described, or related to the 
like quantity in the other situation. If 
some quantity is not so related, we examine 
our problem again to discover the implied 
statement arising from the assumption that 
the relation is known, or is so simple that it 
does not need description. 
This is the translation step. 
Symbolic solution by substitution and 
elimination.
-P-A-G-E-148
  130 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
We can see now why the search for a systematic 
solution of problems was useless so long as the tradi- 
tional method of “expressing all the quantities in 
terms of one, preferably the smallest,” was adhered to. 
This method destroyed right from the start all possi- 
bilities of organization around a central idea; of show- 
ing in what way all problems are similar. The right 
method can be seen to be the division into separate 
statements, using as many symbols as there are quan- 
tities. But even this is of little use unless a clear con- 
ception of the réle which the characteristic formula 
plays is acquired. 
The relation diagram is not an essential part of the 
method of solution. The teacher, however, will find it 
a valuable device in graphically showing the nature of 
relationships. Furthermore, its use obviates the neces- 
sity for a verbose description of each symbol. The 
teacher who has used the tabulation method will find 
the diagram easier to use, and of more value to the 
student. 
It may be asked: Can children learn this method? 
The conclusive answer is that many, even of the less 
intelligent, have already learned it and like it. Mental 
tests have shown that some of these successful students 
have intelligence quotients a little under one hundred, 
while the brighter children grasp it after a single ex- 
planation followed by a few illustrations. 
The preceding steps in problem-solution can be con- 
densed into the accompanying table (see page 131).

It is suggested that a wall chart be made and kept in 
sight during the term. This would show the purpose 
of the detail studied at any time. 
The desire for practical problems 
Practical-minded boys often want to know how such 
a method of analysis can be applied in industrial work. 
The following example illustrates the similarity of solu- 
tion between an academic and industrial setting: 
Example 2. A contractor has 22 days to finish a con- 
tract to remove 2000 tons of rock. If he rents a steam 
shovel which can handle 1000 tons in 8 days, how long 
should he keep it, if his own shovel can handle 1000 
tons in 16 days? 
If we compare this example with Example 1, we find 
that the numbers used are the same, and that the re- 
spective quantities are related through similar char- 
acteristic formulas. 
We can make the similar relating or describing state- 
ments: 
1. The amount removed by one shovel added to the 
amount removed by the other shovel is 2000 tons. 
2. One shovel removes 1000 tons in 8 days: that is, 
its rate of work is 1/8 thousand tons a day. 
3. Similarly the rate of the other shovel is 1/16 
thousand tons a day. 
4. The time that one shovel works added to the time 
that the other shovel works is 22 days.
-P-A-G-E-151
  
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 133 
These statements can be translated into equations, 
a and A standing for the amounts removed by each 
shovel, the capital letters standing for the quantities in 
one situation, while the lower-case letters apply to the 
other. 
A+a=2 (1) 
itl 
1/8=R r=1/16 (2) and (8) 
xx 
T+i=2 (4) 
It is obvious that this problem can be solved by 
exactly the same method as the preceding and will give 
the same numerical result, the numbers, of course, hav- 
ing different meanings. 
It should be noted that a practical problem of this 
type would usually be worded as follows: 
A contractor has to remove 2000 tons of rock in 22 
days. His steam shovel can remove 62} tons a day. 
He rents another shovel which can remove rock twice 
as fast. As the excavation is narrow, he can use only 
one shovel on the job. How much will he have to pay 
for the rent of the shovel at $50 per day, if he uses his 
own shovel as much as possible? 
An examination of this statement reveals one of the 
sources of trouble in “practical” problems. The ques- 
tion about the total cost is misleading. It obscures the 
real question, which is about the number of days re- 
quired. It introduces another problem into the first: 
If it takes n days for the rented shovel, and the cost is  
-P-A-G-E-152
  1384 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
$50 a day, what is the total cost? Such a setting 
makes the problem sound business-like; connects 
mathematics with life — and beginners find it almost 
impossible to solve. 
That the last statement is true was demonstrated 
once when the academic setting and the last setting 
were assigned together as home work to a class trained 
by the traditional method. Most pupils solved the 
first, but not one succeeded in solving the second! ! 
We may give still another setting of the same pro- 
blem. 
Example 3. A tank has to be filled in 22 hours. One 
pump can fill itin 8 hours. Another pump can fill it in 
16 hours. How long should the faster pump be worked 
if it is desired to work it as little as possible, and if only 
one pump can be used on the job? 
A comparison with the two preceding examples will 
show that the methods of solution are identical. 
The resetting of practical problems 
The problems examined suggest an idea: If a pro- 
blem is too complicated, contains too many technical 
terms, restate it in some better-understood setting, 
using the same numbers and the corresponding ele- 
1 This problem was proposed to School Science and Mathematics 
readers, and its solution discussed in the June, 1924, number, page 
637. Only two of the many answers received were correct!

THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 135 
ments in the respective characteristic formulas used. 
The following example illustrates the procedure: 
Example 4. Two contractors are building a road, 
each building one half, and each starting from one end. 
A has a concrete mixer, which mixes enough concrete 
per batch for 1 yard of road, while B’s mixer gives 
enough for 7 feet of road; but B’s mixer only gives two 
batches during the time that A’s mixer gives three. 
Ahas a start of 60 yards. Working continuously, they 
finish at the same time, each having done his half of the 
road. How long did it take the first man, if he mixes 
one batch every 10 minutes? 
This is a very complicated problem. It would take 
a good deal of time to analyze it and to evolve a plan of 
solution. We should have trouble in visualizing the 
relations between the various quantities. Let us, 
then, adopt the above suggestion: restate the problem, 
using familiar situations. 
Example restated. A boy, pursued by a policeman, 
has a start of 60 yards. He takes 8 strides to the 
policeman’s 2, but 3 strides of the policeman cover the 
same ground as 7 strides of the boy, who covers 1 yard 
in each stride. How many yards (boy’s strides) must 
the policeman run to overtake the boy? 
This statement is far easier to visualize. We under- 
stand clearly every separate condition. Yet a com- 
parison with the contractor problem shows that identi- 
cally the same numbers were used with the correspond-
-P-A-G-E-154
136 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
ing quantities and similar relations, both in character- 
istic formulas and in the two situations described in 
each statement. The number of yards that the boy 
will run is equal to the number of yards made by the 
first contractor. On the other hand, the second state- 
ment is of such a nature that the quantities and their 
relations are in the foreground; the policeman and the 
boy occupy a secondary position when we try to keep a 
view of the problem as a whole in our mind, while form- 
ing a plan of solution. 
Analysis. Two situations dee described: the boy 
running, and the policeman running. The situations 
are related by the fact that the time elements involved 
are equal (this is an example of an implied statement), 
and by the fact that the distance run by the policeman 
is 60 yards greater than the distance run by the boy. 
Rate of stride relations are also given. 
The quantities described are distances, rates, and 
time. These suggest that the characteristic formula 
needed is the uniform motion formula. 
The following relating and describing statements can 
be made: 
1. The boy covers 1 yard, or 8 feet, in 1 stride. 
2. The policeman covers the same amount of ground 
in 3 strides as the boy covers in 7, or 21 feet. 
That is, the policeman has a 7-foot stride. 
8. Two strides of the policeman, 14 feet, and 3 
strides of the boy, 9 feet, are made in the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  “THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 187 
length of time. That is, the distance covered by 
the boy in a unit length of time — his rate — is 
9/14 that of the policeman.! 
4. The distance run by the policeman = distance run 
by the boy + the boy’s start. 
Statements 1 and 2 were combined to form State- 
ment 8, so no equation derived from them is needed. 
We translate Statements. 3 and 4 into symbols, to- 
gether with the implied statement that the time ele- 
ment is the same in both situations.

Substituting the value of 7¢ obtained from (2) 
into (1), 
D=9D/14+ 60 
5 D/14 = 60; or D = 168 
The policeman runs 168 yards. The boy runs 108 
yards. 
1 At this point a person skilled in the perception of relationships 
may introduce.a short cut: Since the time elements are equal, 5/14 
of the total distance is 60 yards. But any one who has met the 
hare-and-hound problem in algebras knows that such a mental pro- 
cess is beyond the power of a beginner.

Degrees of difficulty in problems 
Uniform rate problems, in which amount of work 
done enters as an element, are very often met in in- 
dustry. Owing to the complexity of the statements 
and to lack of sound mathematical training, direct 
solutions are usually avoided and guesses are made. 
But the complexity of the situations often disappears 
when other problems are made up which use some 
other instance of the characteristic formula, as has 
been shown in the contractor-policeman problem. 
Problems can be divided into four classes: 
1. They may have simple settings and simple rela- 
tionships; 
2. They may have simple relationships and complex 
settings; 
8. They may have complex relationships and simple 
settings; 
4. They may have complex relationships and com- 
plex settings. 
It is rather astonishing that writers who devise tests 
of ability to solve problems never grade problems from 
this point of view. The relation diagram shows at a 
glance just how difficult the problem is from the point 
of view of relationships. On the other hand, psy- 
chologists have considerable information about the 
vocabulary of school children and their ability to 
understand meanings. A test taking both elements 
into account could be devised without much difficulty.

We shall now proceed to show, by means of further 
illustrations, how situations in which work, for ex- 
ample, performed at two different rates can be com- 
pared to situations in which trains or automobiles 
travel at different rates. Our aim is to demonstrate: 
(1) that rate problems of any kind, in any setting, are 
highly practical; (2) that the study of the relations be- 
tween quantities and of the methods of solution is 
more important to the learner than the industrial 
terms which make the problem appear practical, but 
which really obscure the solution and retard the de- 
velopment of power in quantitative thinking; (3) that 
the skill acquired in solving any kind of problem can be 
transferred to the solution of practical problems, pro- 
vided the underlying principles are known and appre- 
ciated. 
Again we repeat: Children develop capacity for 
quantitative thinking by handling problems in which 
quantities and their relations are recognized and con- 
sciously kept in the foreground, the complexity of the 
setting being gradually increased. They cannot de- 
velop such capacity when they learn to solve problems 
by means of rules and directions imposed from with- 
out, especially when these problems are complicated.

Further illustrative examples 
Example 5. Two gangs of sidewalk builders start 
from the same end of a street on opposite sides. One  
-P-A-G-E-158
  140 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
gang makes 12 yards of sidewalk more than does the 
otherevery day. The faster gang reaches the end, 240 
yards away, and turns back at once on the other side 
of the street, meeting the slower gang 192 yards from 
their common starting-point. Find the time taken. 
Example rewritten. Two automobiles start at the 
same time from a certain town. One travels 12 miles 
an hour faster than the other. The faster machine 
reaches another town 240 miles distant and turns back 
at once, meeting the slower one 192 miles from their 
common starting-point. Find the rate of each. 
The two situations in this problem are related by the 
times being equal, and one rate being 12 miles per hour 
greater than the other. The quantities are distances, 
times, and rates. The units are miles, hours, and 
miles per hour. 
Statements describing or relating the quantities and 
situations: 
1. The slow machine travels 192 miles. (A com- 
plete description, belonging to Situation 1.) 
2. The faster machine travels 288 miles. (A com- 
plete description, belonging to Situation 2.) 
8. The rate of the faster machine is 12 miles an hour 
greater than the rate of the slower. (Relating 
two corresponding quantities — rates — in the 
two situations.) 
4, The time of traveling of both is equal. (An im- 
plied statement, relating two corresponding 
quantities — times — in the two situations.)

Substituting this value in (3),

Translating into words, the rate of the slower ma- 
chine is 24 miles an hour. This result can be checked 
by seeing that it satisfies the conditions of the state- 
ment. 
After a keener perception of relationships has been 
developed, this problem may be solved as follows: 
1. The faster machine travels 96 miles more than 
the slower. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  142 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
2. Since it travels 12 miles an hour faster than the 
slower machine, the time required is 96/12 = 
8 hours. The rate of the slower machine is 
192/8 = 24. 
Such solutions are gravely given as illustrating 
“methods of solution,” and children are often berated 
because they fail to “learn” them. But teachers know 
from bitter experience that logical reasoning processes 
are not learned by imitation. Their problem is to 
teach the art of thinking, and not how other people 
have thought in former times. 
In designing or adjusting machinery, a problem of 
the following type frequently arises: Two parts of the 
machine start from different points at different times, 
and move at different rates. At what time and in 
what position will they be at some given distance 
apart? It would be of little use to the student to 
examine a specific case of this type; first, because the 
statement would be very complicated, and hence would 
require a large amount of time without a proportionate 
return of usefulness, and secondly, because he may 
never meet this particular problem in practical experi- 
ence. It is, however, very useful to learn the general 
method of solution of such problems; this is best done 
by using an easily visualized situation, dealing with 
well-known quantities. The following problem con- 
tains all the elements of the machinery problem sug- 
gested above.

Example 6. A bicycle rider starts from A toward B, 
200 miles away. His rate is 9 miles an hour. Three 
hours later an automobile starts from C, which is 20 
miles on the other sidefrom A, passes through A, reaches 
B, where it stops for an hour, then returns toward A; 
how soon after leaving B will the automobile be 15 miles 
from the bicycle rider, if its rate is 26 miles an hour? 
This problem is easily visualized and the relation 
diagram written down. Let 2 be the distance that the 
automobile traveled after leaving B.

869 = 35% 
Whence ¢ = 103% hours,

  144 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Clear thinkers may adopt the following short 
cut: 
After the bicycle rider has traveled 4 hours — that 
is, covered 36 miles — the two men approach each 
other at the rate of 35 miles an hour. The sum of the 
distances (traveled by both at the same time) is: 
200 + 220 — 15 — 36 = 869 miles, 
and the time is 369/35. 
The unprejudiced reader must acknowledge the 
superiority of the method shown over the traditional 
method. Many algebraic problems are practically 
impossible of solution without a systematic analysis by 
statements, which the described method easily sup- 
plies. We can easily find the statements describing or 
relating the quantities once we know what to look for. 
But we know what to look for only if we keep the idea 
of relationship in mind, as the National Committee on 
Mathematical Requirements recommends. The par- 
ticular form of the characteristic formula required is 
usually apparent at once from the words used in the 
statement. These two, then, are the fundamental 
notions needed for systematic problem-solving. 
If the notation is carefully observed, translation into 
symbols does not present any particular difficulties. 
It has been found that children learn this part of the 
solution very quickly. After this the symbolic manip- 
ulation is clearly indicated, and can usually be carried 
out in more than one way. It is evident, then, that,
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 145 
for a large class of problems, we have here a general 
method of solution. 
The plan of solution of the last problem is easily 
applied to one of the traditional problems, the clock 
problem. ‘This problem illustrates the incomplete 
statement sometimes present, and also shows how the 
notion that quantities are related through the char- 
acteristic formula assists in the automatic recall of the 
missing relations. 
Example '7. At what time after 3 o’clock will the 
two hands of a clock be at a right angle to each 
other? 
We have two situations, the two hands moving at 
different rates. The quantities described are the angle 
(or length of arc) between the two hands, and the time 
of starting. The statement is very brief because it is 
assumed that every one knows the conditions under 
which a clock runs. We assume that the unit of time 
is the minute, the unit of arc the minute-space, and we 
observe that the hands start moving at 3 o’clock (just 
as an automobile and a pedestrian start from different 
places at the same time) and that at the end they are 
to be 15 minute-spaces apart. 
Statement about the quantities: 
1. The time during which the two hands move is the 
same for both. 
2. The arc covered by the minute hand is the sum of 
the 15 minute-spaces necessary to reach the

and 15 minute-spaces besides.

Ror

T=t 
It is evident that, since R and r are neither given nor 
related, we cannot solve the problem. There must be 
a statement implied, relating or describing the rates. 
This statement is: The minute hand moves at the rate 
of one minute-space a minute, and the hour hand 
moves at one twelfth of this rate. That is R = 1, and 
r= 1/12. 
This enables us to complete the relation diagram.

Substituting the values of D and d in (1),

THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 147 
That is, the two hands will be 15 minute-spaces 
apart, or at right angles, at 3 hr. 32,4; min. 
It should be noted that all the usual clock problems 
can be solved by using the last diagram. The only 
change due to different conditions will be in the 
number 30. That is, the relative position of the hands 
is automatically followed by a corresponding change in 
the statement about the distance covered by the min- 
ute hand, in Equation (1). 
Quadratic equations 
As it is not intended to discuss quadratic equations 
very extensively, the following example will merely 
illustrate the application of our method of solution to 
this often difficult class of problems: 
Example 8. A certain bar of iron weighs 36 pounds. 
If the bar had been one foot longer, each foot would 
have weighed one half pound less. Find the weight of 
the bar per foot and its length. 
The characteristic formula takes the following form 
in this two-situation problem: 
Total weight = weight per foot X number of 
feet. : 
T=WN 
We can make the following statements relating or 
describing the quantities: 
1. The weight remains unchanged (implied), and is 
86 pounds.
-P-A-G-E-166

2. The length is increased one foot in the second 
situation.

in the second situation.

Substituting 7/N and t/n for W and w in (8), we

Substituting the values given in (1) and (2), 
36 n — 36 (n+ 1) =— 3n(n+1) 
Which reduces to the quadratic equation, 
n+n=—72=0 
Solving this, we obtain n = 8 feet.

lyzed in Chapter VIII, including problems leading to 
cubic equations. 
Criticism of the method 
The method described is young, but it has already 
run the gauntlet of adverse criticism: offered mainly by 
educators who have not given it a trial. We quote 
from one conservative: 
This diagram method makes problem solution so easy, so 
systematic, that the disciplinary value of the study of mathe- 
matics is lost. It kills analysis. It provides a mental slide- 
tule. By it children are enabled to solve problems without 
thinking, or at least without doing the severe mental work 
which is good for them. It should be carefully examined by 
experts for a few years before being published ... 
Thorough acquaintance with the method, and analy- 
sis of the results obtained in classroom work, enable 
the author to answer these objections as follows: 
1. The so-called analysis popular at the present time 
has no scientific basis. It depends for success upon a 
mixture of apperceptive background, common-sense, 
native shrewdness, recollection of problems solved in 
the past, and patience in trying various equations until 
the right solution is accidentally obtained. While it is 
but fair to say that some modern authors have given 
directions for solving problems systematically — for 
instance, by tabulation, or by writing down statements 
— these methods are illustrated only through simple 
problems leading to linear equations, such as any 
bright student could write down readily after reading  
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
the problem. Furthermore, the tabular or statement 
and reasoning methods are far more cumbersome than 
the method described, and do not provide the con- 
scious and constant recall of the function concept given 
by the latter. 
If the method described kills the traditional analy- 
sis, it replaces it with a different kind of analysis of far 
higher educational value. The pupil is trained in 
minute observation of exact meaning of words and 
sentences, in paraphrasing until he obtains a sentence 
that can be translated into an equation. But, most 
important of all, he is trained in watching for and dis- 
covering relationships, not once, but several times in 
each problem. The teacher does not need to “point 
out relationships whenever they occur” (National 
Committee Report), the pupil finds them himself, and 
uses them. 
What this critic called analysis is only the orderly 
arrangement of steps and post-mortem examination 
held after a problem is solved. No one ever analyzed 
by pure logic a difficult problem that he had never 
before met. On the other hand, the author has often 
seen unfamiliar problems analyzed systematically by 
children using his method. The problems were solved 
in such a short time that it was evident that the steps 
were taken consecutively and no guessing was done. 
Thus, one of his pupils analyzed twenty-five rate pro- 
blems correctly in ten minutes, at times filling in the re- 
lation diagrams as fast as he could read the statements.
-P-A-G-E-169
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 151 
2. The fact that ordinary problems given in an ele- 
mentary course become too easy when the function 
method is used should not be a reason for rejecting the 
method. More difficult problems are easy to provide. 
That is, more ground can be covered in the same length 
of time. This should effectively answer the “destroy 
the disciplinary value” and “severe mental effort” 
arguments. 
8. Nine tenths of all students taking a ninth-grade 
course will not go to college. To them mathematics 
becomes significant only after they become convinced 
that it can be useful after they leave school. The de- 
finition of mathematics as being the art through which 
problems dealing with quantities can be solved is the 
only one which satisfies this class of students. To 
them mathematics must be shown to have a social 
value before they can be induced to apply themselves 
energetically to it. Ignoring the rights and needs of 
these students is one of the causes of the present dis- 
satisfaction with high-school mathematics. 
4, Analyses of the results obtained from the tradi- 
tional teaching of the first year of high-school mathe- 
matics are anything but satisfactory. Pupils have 
learned to solve equations, but not problems. Truth- 
ful pupils will often acknowledge that they solved 
problems by guessing the answer, then working back- 
ward in some haphazard way to the equation, or that 
they solved by arithmetic methods whenever it was 
possible. The reader is probably well acquainted
-P-A-G-E-170
  152 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
with these devious and highly reprehensible prac- 
tices. 
Motivating features of the method 
The chief value of the method described here lies in 
the fact that through it the child is enabled to solve 
problems almost from the beginning of the term, and 
notices that his power of attacking problems increases 
rapidly. The usual result is that he quickly becomes 
impatient at his own lack of manipulative skill and 
voluntarily drills in the mechanical parts of the subject 
with an earnestness unbelievable to a teacher using the 
traditional method. It is needless to comment on 
results obtained under such conditions. 
Need of reorganization 
We have divided the solution of problems into four 
main steps: 
1. The analysis of the statement; 
2. The translation into symbols; 
8. The manipulation of the symbols; 
4. The interpretation of the result. 
If we examine the ninth-grade textbooks used in our 
schools, we find that what is called mathematics is 
mainly a more or less logical arrangement of descrip- 
tions and dissertations concerning the third and fourth 
steps. Many authors and teachers are still of the 
opinion that training in symbolic juggling creates abil+
-P-A-G-E-171
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 153 
ity to solve problems. They seem to consider pro- 
blems as little diversions which should not distract at- 
tention from mathematics proper. 
But the public knows from long experience that this 
symbolic manipulation leads nowhere in the case of 
most students. One year of it has no practical value 
whatever. Hence the protests, hence the gradual 
elimination of mathematics as a requisite for gradua- 
tion from high school. Fifty years ago mathematics 
was one of the main subjects of the curriculum. At 
the present time it is in danger of occupying a second- 
ary position and of losing ground every year. And 
what is being done to remedy this condition of affairs, 
to restore mathematics to the place that it should 
occupy? Only rearrangement of the contents, addi- 
tion of what some adult considers interesting material, 
and elimination of other parts considered less interest- 
ing. But the main point is overlooked: you cannot 
teach symbolic manipulation effectively before the 
pupil knows what it is all about and what it is good for, 
and you should not teach equations before he knows 
how equations are obtained. 
Principles underlying the reorganization 
Mathematics must be reorganized from the problem- 
solving point of view. The equation must be derived 
before the need of the symbolic solution is perceived. 
The end must be known before the means are discussed 
or studied. Teaching symbolic solution before its 
   
-P-A-G-E-172
eS eee eee 
154 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
need is perceived may be logical, but like many other 
logical methods it fails because the human element is 
overlooked. It may be intended psychologically, but 
psychologists must surely know that no child can keep 
up his interest month after month unless he knows that 
he is progressing, is mastering a useful subject, and 
sees the end in sight. A subject so organized that the 
end is remote and indefinite, or even not in sight, is 
bound to produce such results as we are generally ob- 
taining from ninth-grade mathematics at the present 
time. 
When manual training was first introduced into the 
schools, the regular teachers took hold of the instruc- 
tion and attempted to teach the subject logically and 
pedagogically. The pupils were first requested to 
memorize the names of tools and to be able to describe 
their uses and the methods of handling them. Then 
they were given exercises which were supposed to de- 
velop certain skills with some tools. They had to be- 
come proficient in tool-handling before they were 
allowed to make any useful articles. The results ob- 
tained were so poor that this method was soon thrown 
on the scrap-heap. Manual-training teachers are now 
practical mechanics who show their pupils how to 
make useful articles from the start. The pupils learn 
the names and uses of tools as they go along and de- 
velop skill from the actual use of tools in real work. 
Why cannot mathematics be taught in the same 
way? Let the pupils try their skill on problems from
-P-A-G-E-173
THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 155 
the very start. Show them briefly how to analyze and 
translate into symbols. Teach them bits of symbolic © 
manipulation as they go along, only as they need them. 
Help them to finish their problems, just as the shop 
teacher adds the finishing touches to his pupils’ work. 
It will not be long before they become impatient 
at their lack of skill and ask for drill in manipula- 
tion. 
The equation, the negative quantity, and the paren- 
thesis are easily mastered when used as tools in 
problem-solution in the first semester. On the other 
hand, when learned as separate units with “illustrative 
examples” of their use, they fail to arouse interest. 
It is remarkable that psychologists have overlooked 
this method of motivating the study. They have paid 
entirely too much attention to attempts to make 
a competitive game out of it and to other artificial 
ways of causing “satisfaction.” But the “neurone- 
tickling” process is pretty well discredited now, mean- 
ingless drills are still nothing but drudgery, while the 
skill acquired by such artificial methods is easily lost. 
Then we resort to reviews and reviews of reviews, in 
vain attempts to create habits of quantitative thinking 
without ourselves having clear ideas about the nature 
of relationships among quantities. 
Essential features in the reorganization 
Elementary algebra must, then, be reorganized 
along the three following main lines: 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
156 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
1. Problem analysis must be given its proper place 
in the scheme of instruction. 
2. Symbolic manipulation must be restricted at each 
stage to the types and to the complexity needed 
to solve the problems. 
8. Sequence of subject-matter must be determined 
by the number of situations involved in problems 
and the nature of the relations between the quan- 
tities in these situations. Toward the end of the 
course, problems should become more and more 
practical; that is, contain a setting of increasing 
complexity from the point of view of technical or 
commercial terminology. 
Such an arrangement would satisfy everybody with 
the possible exception of the college authorities. But, 
when it is considered that a college-bound student will 
take another year of algebra and one year of geometry, 
we can see how a clear understanding of the methods 
and uses of mathematics, a vivid perception of the 
derivation and use of symbolic notation, and a com- 
prehension of the function concept will eventually 
more than make up for any lack of facility in symbol- 
juggling. Furthermore, it is already noticeable that 
college officials are beginning to see the light. They 
are beginning to change their obsolete entrance re- 
quirements, and to recognize that problem-solving 
ability and not manipulative skill is the better criterion 
of mathematical preparation. They are just begin- 
ning to learn that students trained in schools where 
+
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE USE OF THE FUNCTION CONCEPT 157 
small regard is paid to college-entrance requirements 
often succeed better in later academic work than those 
trained by regulation college-preparatory methods. 
The former learn the mathematical language; the 
latter attempt to learn only the shorthand of this 
language. The former learn to handle thoughts; the 
latter learn to handle only symbols of thoughts.
-P-A-G-E-176
  CHAPTER VIII 
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 
Present methods do not teach analysis 
By a gradual process of evolution we have arrived at 
the present method of teaching elementary mathe- 
matics, which apparently aims to show the child how 
to use mathematics in life work, but does not show why 
certain fundamental processes are used, nor when to 
use them. The child learns how to multiply or divide, 
but not when to multiply or divide. He learns to 
solve equations, but not how to obtain equations. 
The child learns rules through highly developed psy- 
chological methods. After these rules are learned, 
they are seldom applied to problems because the analy- 
sis which would show where these rules should be ap- 
plied has not been taught. The next step in these 
methods is the haphazard solution of a large number of 
problems at break-neck speed, leading to the gradual 
acquisition of skill and experience for the few sur- 
vivors. Learning mathematics according to present 
methods has been described by an “authority” as a 
process of “solving such a large number of problems 
that a new one is recognized as belonging to a certain 
type already solved.” 
If this were true, we should cease to wonder that so 
few people can solve problems, and also cease to teach
-P-A-G-E-177
  
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 159 
mathematics to that great majority who will not solve 
thousands of problems in the course of their training. 
But it is not true. It has been shown that the chief 
difficulty is due to lack of knowledge of essentials and 
lack of system in analyzing problems. It has been 
shown that problem-solving is comparatively easy 
once the general structure of problems is understood. 
We have analyzed a few problems dealing with ordi- 
nary situations and given a general method of attack- 
ing well-known types. It is now our purpose to extend 
this analysis a little farther and to show how problem- 
solving can be taught to children who have learned 
long division, fractions, and the simple equation. 
After this we shall examine the practical industrial 
problem. 
Elementary problems. Classroom presentation. Be- 
fore we can play baseball we have to learn to throw the 
ball and to bat. After this we have to learn the rules 
and methods of playing. The best batter, runner, and 
catcher of balls on earth could not play baseball unless 
he knew the rules and knew what to do after catching 
a ball or hitting one. 
The same is true of mathematics. The pupil who 
can work the largest number of exercises in division or 
equations and do them correctly may be unable to 
solve simple problems because he does not understand, 
and hence cannot apply, the rules that must be ob- 
served in the solution of problems. These rules are 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
160 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
best learned by analyzing problems before solving 
them, breaking them into parts. We find two ele- 
ments in most problems: 
1. The mathematical element, consisting of num- 
bers, and words necessary to the solution. These 
describe the situation in such a way that we can 
find some unknown quantity. 
2. The setting, consisting of words that are intended 
to make the problem interesting and to make you 
understand that you are learning something use- 
ful. 
But the moment you begin to solve problems, you 
discover that the settings are in your way. Their 
interesting aspects distract your attention from the 
essential points, the points which you must combine 
and manipulate in order to solve the problems. You 
find that in order to obtain solutions you must actually 
strip the problems down to the essential elements, re- 
duce them to what may be called the mathematical 
words. 
After you have done this stripping, you may still 
have a deal of trouble in deciding what to do next. 
You should then examine the rewritten problems to see 
how many different situations are described and how 
many quantities are involved. 
Example 1. A Peet walked twelve miles in four 
hours. How fast did he walk?
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 161 
This is a one-situation problem. ‘Two quantities are 
completely described: a distance and a period of time. 
The question is about a third quantity which is related 
to the other two by the rule: rate = distance divided by 
time; that is, by the formula r= d/t. To solve the 
problem, we write 12 instead of d, and so on. 
Example 2. Twelve shovels weigh sixty pounds. 
What is the weight of one? 
This is a one-situation problem. The quantities 
fully described are the number of articles and the total 
weight. The question is about a third quantity which 
is related to the other two by the rule: weight of one 
equals total weight divided by number of articles; that 
is, by the formula w = W/N; and so on. 
Example 8. How long a board is needed if seven 
pieces each two feet long are desired? 
The quantities are the number of pieces and the 
length of each piece. The question is about the third 
quantity, the total length. The formula required is 
T=LIN. 
You should always keep in mind the existence of the 
third factor in each situation when solving problems in- 
volving multiplication or division. It is always sup- 
posed to be present. Your progress in problem- 
solving depends largely upon your ability to recognize 
it and to state it when it is not given directly.

Discussion. Exercises of this type develop ability 
to recognize the quantities and characteristic formulas 
involved in one-situation problems. They establish 
the fundamental notion of problem structure. 
It has been repeatedly stated here that the failure to 
recognize clearly all the factors involved in problems 
requiring multiplication or division is the main cause of 
our early quantitative troubles. This failure is usually 
due to the desire to save time and cover a large amount 
of ground in early school work. While the objectives 
are clearly established, the means needed are more 
than hazy. We are trying to train children to recog- 
nize relations among quantities without telling them 
what we want them to do, without telling them specifi- 
cally what the quantities are, and without pointing out 
clearly the nature of the relationships that we want 
them to see. 
Thus the problem: What is the cost of one hat if 
twelve hats cost $36? is usually solved by dividing 36 
by 12, without a thought about the reason for the step. 
Many children will say that they did it because 36 is a 
larger number than 12. Such children would also 
divide 36 by 12 if the problem were: What is the cost of 
one hat if thirty-six hats cost $12? Few teachers ask 
children how they solve problems. They are only in- 
terested in results, and consider that a process is 
learned when correct answers are given. But the un- 
soundness of the training becomes apparent as soon as 
the child is given a problem of the following type: 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 163 
147 yards of rope cost $4.67; what is the cost of 43 
yards? 
If able to solve it when the elements are presented in 
the above order, the child will often fail when the 
sequence is varied, as in: 
What is the cost of 43 yards of rope if $4.67 is the 
cost of 147 yards? 
Careful observation has shown that a great many 
children will try manipulation of the three numbers 
until they find a chance answer that appears reason- 
able. It has also shown that most children acquire the 
notion that problems must be solved by using the 
numbers given in the problem, and that the only per- 
missible combinations are obtained through the use 
of the four “fundamental” processes. That is, the 
notion that relationships are often implied is com- 
pletely lacking. 
This deplorable condition of affairs is due to the mis- 
taken practice of: (1) Introducing short cuts before the 
child is taught to analyze or even to perceive the ele- 
ments of the problem, and before he has a chance to 
learn that quantities are related and the nature of the 
relationships; (2) giving the high-speed drills devised 
by efficiency experts aiming at quantity production. 
It has been found in industry that efficiency experts 
often overlook some essential process. We find in edu- 
cation that our experts frequently overlook the funda- 
mental fact that thinking requires time and leisure.
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
We cannot associate and organize unless we are given a 
definite amount of time. Mental processes are slow in 
adults; in children they are still slower. 
The slow method 
In the first problem, “If twelve hats cost $36, what 
is the cost of one?”’ the child should be taught to recog- 
nize and state the three quantities involved as factors 
of the characteristic formula C= RN. Substituting 
the values given, 36=12R. Translating back into 
words: Twelve times the cost of one is thirty-six. 
What is the cost of one? R=? The child thinks and 
sees the symbols of thought at one and the same time. 
The thought gives meaning to the symbols, and the 
symbols assist the thought in taking a definite direc- 
tion. The information has been associated and 
organized. 
The unitary reasoning 
Such a method would also develop power in unitary 
reasoning, the only short-cut device of any value from 
the pedagogical and the practical point of view. For 
some unknown reason this device is no longer taught, 
being replaced by “psychological” methods which pro- 
ceed “from easy to difficult” by first providing prac- 
tice in easy examples, gradually accelerating the pro- 
cess until top speed is obtained, then abruptly jumping 
into two-situation problems in which the main rela- 
tionship is implied. These methods trust to rules, |
-P-A-G-E-183
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 165 
drills, and ingenious habit-forming devices to develop 
thinking about quantities without mentioning quan- 
tities. Troublesome explanations about fundamentals 
are left out in the hope that children will form methods 
of their own inductively. Few do so. 
Objections to proposed methods 
It may be objected that the methods described in 
this book are unnecessarily profuse in trivial details; 
that a relatively unimportant process or principle can 
be learned faster by “psychological”? methods; that 
the method described is not practical; that the child 
needs practical drills in short cuts or short methods, 
not long-drawn-out analyses; that this method cannot 
be used in business, as it is too slow. 
The only answer needed is that this method is funda- 
mental. It gives a process essential to clear under- 
standing and future growth. Short cuts partake of the 
nature of blind alleys. The user of short cuts gets into 
a frame of mind in which he solves drill problems with- 
out thinking, and sees no need of using analytic 
methods (quantitative thinking) for the solution of 
problems which can be solved by means of short cuts. 
He does not realize that practice in the longer reason- 
ing methods is imperative if complex problems, beyond 
the scope of the short cut, are to be attempted later. 
There is no transfer of training in reasoning to other 
studies, because rules do not require reasoning. Our 
numerous mathematical failures are due to the lack of 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
166 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA ' 
development of mathematical reasoning in the early 
grades; they are due to methods which can only pro- 
duce inhibition of original thinking. We are too easily 
influenced by the impractical demands of self-styled 
“practical” people that aaa be taught something 
tangible, not theorizing (that is, not thinking). 
The reasoning of these efficiency experts runs some- 
| what as follows: “To solve a problem by analytic 
methods takes ten times as long as by short-cut 
methods. Therefore the short-cut method is the 
best.” But results speak for themselves: few children 
become proficient in short-cut methods, and the rest 
cannot solve problems at all, if the complaints of busi- 
ness men and college professors is a criterion. Whena 
problem is met in life work, the main objective is to get 
the correct solution; the length of time used in the pro- 
cess is usually of little relative importance. On the 
other hand, a person who has to solve a large number 
of problems of one sort finds little difficulty in devising 
or looking up short cuts after the first few are solved 
by analytic methods. Is it not preferable that chil- 
dren should be slow in solving their problems, rather 
than that they should not be able to solve them at 
all? 
The temptation to teach “practical” short cuts is 
almost irresistible to many teachers. But careful 
analysis shows that most short-cut methods omit at 
least one step in reasoning, or require the perception of 
some implied relation utterly beyond the capacity of 
|
-P-A-G-E-185
| THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 167 
the learner. This at once makes the use of the short 
cut conditional upon the recall of some memorized rule 
and upon the recognition of the feature which makes 
the problem possible of solution by that particular 
short cut. Is this practical? 
Classification of problems 
It is suggested that problem-solving be taught in the 
following sequence of topics, determined by the com- 
plexity in the “structural” relationships between the 
quantities: 
1. One-situation problems, with an analysis of the 
more commonly used characteristic formulas, 
pointing out the resemblance between them, and 
the properties of the factors. 
2. Two-situation problems, in which the situations 
are not related. The solution of such problems is 
obtained by the comparison of like quantities. 
8. Two-situation problems, in which the situations 
are so related as to lead to the equality of two 
ratios, that is, to proportion problems. 
4. Two-situation problems in which the relations do 
not lead to a proportion, solved by simultaneous 
equations. 
5. Two-situation problems solved by quadratic 
equations. 
6. Problems with three or more situations. 
7. Problems with technical settings, requiring a pro- 
cess of translation into mathematical language.
-P-A-G-E-186
    168 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
We shall now proceed with a brief analysis of pro- 
blems falling into each of the above groups. 
One-situation problems 
We first note that one-situation problems, excepting 
those dealing with fractions or parts of some quantity, 
usually contain two avanti and the factor showing 
their relation, or, as we assume for convenience in our 
discussion, of three quantities. Then the character- 
istic formula needed for the solution can take any of 
the three forms: 
  
4 a ig Q= NU, N= or = 
Thus in the uniform motion problem, we have 
d=rt,r=d/t,andt=d/r. That is, we can have only 
three types of problem: 
2. Given the distance and the time, find the rate. 1. Given the time and od rate, find the distance. 
8. Given the distance and the rate, find the time. 
The teacher should point out the similarity between 
the uniform motion fen the general constant rate 
formula, and whatever characteristic formula happens 
to be involved in the particular problem examined. 
If this policy is adhered to consistently, the child will 
form a habit of looking - the characteristic relation 
in every problem presented. Some day, when con- 
fronted by a difficult problem involving some little-
-P-A-G-E-187
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 169 
used form, he will consciously compare it with some 
well-known and well-understood form. When he does 
this, we may consider that he has acquired sound 
habits of quantitative thinking. 
One-situation problems, when met in elementary 
textbooks, usually require the use of one of the follow- 
ing characteristic formulas: 
1. The uniform rate formula for work: A = RT. 
. The uniform rate formula for distance: D = RT. 
. The cost formula: C = RN. 
. The weight formula: T= WN. 
. The length formula: T = LN. 
. The interest formula: J = PRT.! OQ oO & CO %~O 
Two-situation problems comparing like quantities 
1. A man purchases a bond for $279, and receives 
$17.80 interest in one year. His friend purchases 
another bond for $380, and receives $24.63 in the 
same period of time. Which bond pays the 
higher rate? 
2. A farmer rents 47 acres and pays $350 a year 
rent. His neighbor pays $510 for the rent of 67 
acres of the same kind of land. Which pays the 
higher rate? 
8. A boy batted 57 hits out of 147 times at the bat. 
1 The last is a “compounded” characteristic formula. We may 
show the compounding as follows: The interest for one year is 
I; = PR. This is one characteristic relation. The interest for T 
years is ly = I; T, This is another characteristic relation. 
   
-P-A-G-E-188

| Another boy batted 72 hits out of 170 times. 
| Which is the better batter? 
4. One kind of coal costs $10 a ton. It contains 
8 per cent ashes. Another kind contains 11 per 
cent ashes, but its cost is only $9 a ton. Which is 
the cheaper? | 
5. Three varieties of wheat are planted in separate 
plots of ground in the same field; 350 pounds of 
seed of the first kind produce 7860 pounds har- 
vest; 490 pounds of the second kind produce 9765 
pounds; and 264 pounds of the third kind produce 
5142 pounds. Whi is preferable? 
6. A cow gives 40 pounds of milk containing 3.1 per 
cent butter fat. Another cow gives 32 pounds of 
milk containing 4 per cent butter fat. Which 
gives the more butter? 
Analysis shows that these problems contain groups 
of unrelated situations. We solve each characteristic 
formula for its unknown factor, and compare the re- 
sults in pairs. They are valuable because all the quan- 
tities are in plain sight, and every factor of the char- 
acteristic formula must be used. 
Problems of this type are valuable because they 
show the utility of mathematics in everyday life situa- 
tions. A farmer compares returns from seeds, fields, 
or stock. The Ritec unas the returns from 
various pieces of property. The housewife compares 
numberless values. In general we compare for efli- 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 171 
ciency. Every day we have to make decisions based 
on some point of similarity between situations. Too 
often we decide by snap judgment when quantitative 
calculation is entirely practicable. 
Motivating, practical, and educative, these problems 
are unduly neglected by our textbook writers. It is 
recommended that a large number be gathered and 
worked by the class itself, not only for motivating pur- 
poses, but also because such problems give the best 
kind of practice in the recognition and classification of 
the elements of the characteristic formulas involved. 
It certainly appears reasonable to teach unequal ratios 
before we teach equal ratios in which one factor of the 
characteristic formula is eliminated without conscious- 
ness of the process. 
Sound quantitative thinking is developed when such 
problems are worked out in class somewhat as follows: 
Problem. Which is the more profitable for a farmer 
and how much: to sell his corn on December 1 at 46 
cents per bushel or on May 1 at 52 cents a bushel? 
In May? Yes, but are there not other things to be 
considered? Suppose that the farmer must borrow 
money at 6 per cent... 
He is still ahead. But suppose the shrinkage is 
10 per cent... 
And the teacher introduces other factors, such as 
cost of storage, insurance, difference in cost of hauling, 
or working time available. 
     
-P-A-G-E-190
  172 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
That most people lack training in the discovery of 
the quantities involved in everyday business trans- 
actions is only too apparent to the observer. One 
instance will be sufficient. People buy houses on 
the installment plan. Apparently everything is cal- 
culated: interest on the money, insurance, repairs, 
taxes. But how many consider depreciation? Ex- 
perts consider that about twenty-five per cent of busi- 
ness failures are due to oversight of depreciation 
alone! 
Two-situation problems involving the comparison of 
two equal ratios — the proportion problems 
A/B= K, and a/b= K; therefore, A/B = a/b 
When the characteristic formula method is used, 
teaching the solution of proportion problems is easy. 
The simplest device that can be used in class demon- 
stration consists of writing some characteristic formula 
vertically instead of horizontally on the blackboard. 
We can show that there are three possible relations be- 
tween the two situations: 
@=q Q'¢ @ @ 
oll id ae 
Rr R=r Bor 
x xX x1 xX x xX 
U u U0 u U=u 
Problem 1. If 12 yards of cloth cost $48, what is the 
cost of 7 yards? 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
   THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 173 
The characteristic formula involved is the cost 
formula: 
C= RN 
Adult reasoning shows that R = r is the implied rela- 
tion. But we have a better way of finding the missing 
relation and the operations required when we arrange 
the formulas vertically. Forty-eight dollars is evi- 
dently the total cost in one situation while the question 
is about the total cost in the other situation. Twelve 
and seven are clearly like quantities in both situations. 
Since they are not rates, they must be represented by 
N and n.

23 12=N =7 
We notice immediately that R and r are neither de- 
scribed nor related in the statement or diagram. But 
the fact that the rates are equal is the foundation of the 
solution. This rate-equality is then the relation be- 
tween the two situations. It must be found before we 
can solve the problem; that is, we must do the fol- 
lowing: 
48=C c=?

  174 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
We then proceed to solve for R and r: 
48/12= R=r=c/7 
oP 48/12 = ¢/7 
— and the child sees every step of the solution. 
It has been found by actual classroom use that this 
method is far easier to learn than the traditional 
method, besides being applicable to problems not 
containing the proportion feature. The traditional 
method, consisting of rules to be applied in various 
cases, fails to function for the simple reason that the 
child fails to recognize the proportion feature in pro- 
blems outside of the chapter on proportion or loses faith 
in it after trying to solve problems that cannot be 
solved by proportion methods. If he does recognize it, 
he must decide upon the particular rule needed. After 
he has left school and forgotten the rule, he is help- 
less. 
Some proportion problems are stated in such a way 
that the solution is very difficult if the numbers given 
are used. We cannot relate the two situations di- 
rectly. We give an example, of the percentage type. 
Problem 2. In a mass of solder weighing 600 pounds, 
there are 180 pounds of tin, and the rest is lead. How 
much tin should be added so that 100 pounds of the 
new solder shall contain 34 pounds of tin? 
The method of solution usually given in textbooks 
has been found to be incomprehensible to most chil-
-P-A-G-E-193
_ 
dren. Too much reasoning is required to solve it as 
stated. In order to relate the two situations directly, 
we restate the problem using the pounds of lead be- 
cause the relation between the two situations lies in the 
fact that the lead remains unchanged in weight. THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 175 
Problem restated: In 600 pounds of solder there are 
420 pounds of lead. How much tin should be added so 
that 100 pounds of the new solder shall contain 66 
pounds (66 per cent) of lead? 
The characteristic formula is per cent = rate X base, 
or P= RB. Let T be the unknown amount of tin 
added. Then, since 420 is 70 per cent of 600, and the 
lead remains unchanged, 
420 = 420

600 (600+ T) 
or, 
-70 X 600 = 420 = 420 = .66(600+ T) 
Whence T = 36.36 pounds ! 
1 By the unitary method this problem would be solved as follows: 
420 pounds become 66 per cent of the whole mass, M, after the tin is 
added. Therefore,   
1 tu 2 per cent of ~ = 
and 
100 per cent of M= $90 100 030,86 = M 
Then subtract the original mass, 600 pounds. ,

Some teachers and authors write down the propor-

persuade the class that the equation is correct, and 
make the children try to imitate their feat. An ex- 
amination of a pupil’s scratch pad would show the 
following “‘system”: 
70-600 7+T 420 70 600+7 
66 420+ T 66 600 420—St—t«G     
and similar combinations. That is, the children try all 
possible combinations of the numbers given until they 
stumble on the right one. 
“These children will not think!” the disgusted 
teacher then exclaims. The children are willing to 
think, but they have not any plan, they do not even 
know how to start. All that teachers or books show 
are only the final results of complicated mental pro- 
cesses of perception and elimination. 
Problem 3. 147 yards of rope cost $4.67; what is the 
cost of 43 yards? 
The quantities mentioned in the problem are length 
and cost. This suggests that the characteristic 
formula involved is C = RN, total cost = cost per 
unit of length multiplied by the number of units of 
length.
-P-A-G-E-195
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 177 
The total cost, C, is $4.67, while N, the number of 
units of length having the same cost, is 147. 
The third quantity described in the problem, 43, 
cannot belong to the same situation; it is the same kind 
of a quantity as 147, a number of yards; it is not a rate, 
the factor required to complete the group in the 
formula. There must, then, be two groups of related 
quantities. One of the groups is 
C=RN, where C = 4.67, and N= 147. 
That is, we can write 
4.67= 147 R 
R is not given, but is seen to be equal to 4.67/147. 
The second group ise = rn. The question, What is 
the cost? shows that the formula must be of the aspect 
c= rn; total cost =? We are given n= 43; do we 
know anything about r? Yes, it is implied to be the 
same or equal to R, which in turn is = 4.67/147, and 
we have: 
c= rn = 43 X (4.67/147) 
After this, the child should be shown the relation 
between the two situations by means of the formulas in 
vertical positions.

formed. We find R and transfer the value obtained to 
the right-hand situation. In symbolic form this would 
proceed as follows:

This device has proved successful in making the plan 
of operation clear to some children after all other 
methods had failed. But we should not trust to it 
alone. The notion of relationship between quantities 
and the nature of that relationship should be presented 
from as many angles as possible. The teacher should 
also constantly remind the class that there are two 
kinds of relations in a two-situation problem: 
(1) The characteristic formula; 
(2) The relation between like quantities in the two 
formulas involved. “Also that the latter kind is 
often implied. 
We may arrive at the same solution in a different 
way. 
We have found that R = 4.67/147. In the second 
part of the problem, 7 = ¢/43. 
But the rate is the same for both. That is, R=r.

THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 179 
This process partakes of the nature of a short cut, for 
the elimination is done mentally. It should be used 
only after the other methods are fairly familiar. If 
used too early, the children are likely to try to save 
still more time and invent methods of “setting up” 
two or three equations, selecting the right one by com- 
paring the results. 
We can see now that the solution of proportion pro- 
blems is easily taught when approached from the char- 
acteristic formula point of view. Proportion problems 
are not essentially different from other two-situation 
problems, and there is little justification for the present 
method of teaching them as if they were in a class 
by themselves, using short-cut rules which completely 
ignore the idea of relationship. 
Many proportion problems can be handled as double 
problems. Thus our problem could have been stated 
as follows: vf 
1. One hundred and forty-seven yards of rope cost 
$4.67. At what rate is it sold, or what is the cost 
of one yard? 
2. If the cost of one yard of rope — the rate — is 
4.67/147, what is the cost of 43 yards? 
And then the solution would not have been so diffi- 
cult to a beginner. Such a method would also develop 
power in unitary analysis, the only short-cut device, as 
has previously been pointed out, which has value from 
the pedagogical and the practical point of view.

Two-situation problems not involving proportion and 
leading to linear equations 
Most algebraic problems in elementary courses are 
of this type. We have already given some illustrative 
examples in Chapter VII. The following are added 
because of the interesting analysis required. The first 
illustrates the difficulty encountered sometimes in the 
determination of the proper quantity to use. 
Problem 1. Ten hours after a man had started on a 
trip, a second man followed, gaining 3 miles an hour on 
the first. When the second had been gone 8 hours, he 
met a traveler going in the opposite direction and at 
the same rate as his own. The traveler told him that 
he had passed the first man 2 hours 24 minutes before. 
How long did it take the second man to overtake the 
first? 
This is clearly a problem requiring the characteristic 
formula D= RT. But while the rates and the times 
are easily determined, the distance is rather puzzling. 
If we take the distance to be measured to the point 
where one man overtakes the other, we find that we 
have not enough relations to solve the problem. 
Again, if we try to use the point where the second man 
meets the traveler, the data prove insufficient. Fin- 
ally, we select the third and least conspicuous dis- 
tance: 
Let D=d be the distance to the place where the 
first man met the traveler.
-P-A-G-E-199

It took the first man 18 — 2.4 = 15.6 hours to reach 
that place.

The rest of the problem is now easy.? 
The following problem, solved in about the same 
way in several well-known algebras, illustrates the tra- 
ditional method of solution. Note that the plan of 
solution is kept dark. The reason for each step can be 
perceived only after a review. That the originator 
lacked clear perception of relationships and conse- 
quently used poor analytic methods will appear when 
the solution is compared with the solution through the 
function method following it. 
Problem 2. A train, after traveling an hour from A

three-situation problem — one situation for each man. (Editor.)

toward B, meets with an accident which detains it half 
an hour; after which it proceeds at four fifths of its 
usual rate, and arrives an hour and a quarter late. If 
the accident had happened thirty miles farther on, the 
train would have been only one hour late. Find the 
usual rate of the train. 
Let y = the number of miles from A to B; 
and 5 x= the number of miles the train travels per hour. 
(How would a beginner ever think to use this con- 
venient number?) 
Then 4 = the rate of the train after the accident. 
Then y — 5 x = the number of miles the train has to go 
after the accident. 
  
  Hence 
y—5e ; ee the number of hours required usually; 
and 
y— 5x ee eee the number of hours actually required. 
Therefore, 
Y= Se ye oie

But since the train was detained a half-hour and 
arrived one and a quarter hours late, the running time 
was three quarters of an hour more than usual. 
That is:

the function method. Half of the class brought in the 
following solution:

Many two-situation problems leading to simple 
simultaneous equations can be solved without formal 
analysis. Such problems can be solved by the tradi- 
tional method of “reading the problem and writing 
down the equation” or “expressing all the unknowns 
in terms of one.” Success with easy problems leads 
the inexperienced mathematician to believe that the 
method is general. One illustration will be sufficient. 
Problem 3. The composition of a two-pound bar of 
solder is half lead and half tin, and its cost is $1.32. If 
the cost of tin is five times that of lead, what is the cost 
of one pound of tin? 
The relation diagram shows clearly the reason 
why the equation can be “written down after reading 
carefully.”

Two-situation problem leading to quadratic equations 
Problem. A man bought some tables for $100. If 
the number had been one more, the price for each 
would haye been $5 less. How many did he buy? 
The characteristic formula used is: C = RN, total 
cost = cost of one X number of tables. 
The quantities are all clearly described or related. 
We write the relation diagram: 
100 = C = c = 100

We have

Substituting (1) in (2) : 
(100/n — 5) (n+ 1) = 100 
a quadratic equation. Solving it, we obtain n = 4.

We should note that we can solve for N, R, or r just 
as easily. These alternate methods of solution should 
be emphasized. The pupils should not get the im- 
pression that a problem can be solved only in one way. 
Three-situation problems 
Many problems belong to this type. Many pro- 
blems usually found in the “simultaneous equation” 
chapter, the simple “work” and “cistern” problems, 
are found to be three-situation problems. 
Problem 1. A dealer has two kinds of coffee worth 30 
and 40 cents a pound respectively. How many pounds 
of each must be taken to make a mixture of 70 pounds 
worth 36 cents per pound? 
We have here three situations: the two kinds of 
coffee and the mixture. Each situation is controlled 
by the characteristic formula C = RN; total cost = 
cost per pound X number of pounds. 
The relating statements are: 
1. The cost of the mixture = the sum of the costs of 
the different kinds. 
2. The weight of the mixture = the sum of the 
weights of the different kinds. 
Let M = cost of the mixture.

| Problem 2. Two men together can do a piece of work 
in 4.8 days. One man requires 4 days less than the 
other to do the work alone. Find the number of days 
each requires alone. _ 
This “work” problem contains three situations: 
One man doing the work alone, the other man doing 
the work alone, and the two men working together. 
Each situation is described by the characteristic 
formula, A = RT: amount of work = rate of work 
X time. 
We can make the following relating statements: 
1. The total amount, Q = the sum of the amounts. 
2. The two men together can do it in 4.8 days.

Dividing by Q, and substituting the value T = ¢+ 4, 
given in (1), we have: 
Which is the form that some textbook writers expect 
the student to “write down from a careful study of the 
relations between the parts.” 
Reducing the last result leads to the quadratic equa- 
tion: 
4.8t+ 4.8 (t+ 4) =t(@¢+ 4) 
Solving, we find ¢ = 8, and hence T = 12.

Four-situation problems 
We meet here two types: The strictly four-related- 
situation problem and the pair of two-situation pro- 
blems. In the latter type the relation diagram is built 
in two sections. 
Problem 1. Two men start from opposite shores of a 
lake to row directly across. Their rates of rowing are 
uniform, but not the same. They meet 720 rods from 
the left-hand shore, then each rows to the starting- 
point of the other, rests five minutes, and rows back 
again. This time they meet 440 rods from the right- 
hand shore. Find the distance across the lake. 
It is clear that the five-minute statement is superflu- 
ous, as the time element involved is the period during 
which they row. We shall therefore neglect it. The 
implied relations between the two sets of situations 
are: x, the distance across, is the same, and the rates 
remain unchanged, in both sets. 
Situations 1 and 2: 
One man rows 720 rods; the other man rows the rest 
of the distance. The length of time is the same in both 
cases,

-P-A-G-E-209
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 191 
The above method of eliminating like quantities in 
pairs can be applied to many problems of the same 
type. 
This problem is interesting from another point of 
view. It can be solved arithmetically as follows: 
1. The sum of the distances that the men row is 
three times the distance across. (Each man goes 
across once; then they meet.) 
2. The first man rowed 720 rods of the first crossing. 
8. Therefore he rowed 720 rods of each of the three 
hypothetical crossings, or 720 X 3 rods. But he 
lacked 440 rods of rowing twice across. 
Therefore 2 a — 440 = 720 X 8, or x = 1720. 
This problem was offered for solution to a number of 
mathematics teachers. Some solved it by roundabout 
algebraic methods, and some did not solve it at all. It 
was also proposed to persons who had never studied 
symbol juggling. Some solved it by arithmetic meth- 
ods, and some did not solve it at all. The remarkable 
thing is that the arithmetic solution requires a very 
keen perception of relationship among quantities, 
acquired in some mysterious fashion without formal 
training. 
But such special solutions are not always possible, 
and the four-situation problem may lead, even in the 
case of our simple characteristic formulas, to an equa- 
tion of the third degree, just as the two-situation pro- 
blem often leads to an equation of the second degree.

  192 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
The mathematician is then in his element, while the 
untrained man is helpless. While such problems are 
not handled in elementary mathematics, we shall ex- 
hibit one for the purpose of demonstrating the power 
of our method of attack. 
Problem 2. An army column is twenty-five miles 
long and is marched twenty-five miles. At the same 
time that the column started to march, a courier 
started from the rear and rode forward to the head of 
the army, then immediately returned to the rear. He 
found that the rear was occupying the same ground as 
that occupied by the head of the army at the begin- 
ning of the march. Find how many miles the courier 
traveled. 
Let x = distance that the army marches before the 
courier arrives at the head; then, while the army 
marches x miles, the courier rides x + 25 miles. 
We plan to eliminate the rates as in the preceding 
problem.

Problems leading to equations of the third degree 
We give some examples of four-situation problems 
leading to equations of the third degree. It is hoped 
that these will be found useful in motivating the usu- 
ally dreary study of such equations. It is also hoped 
that, when the technique of problem-building is more 
universally known, more problems of this type will be 
devised. So far as the author knows, these are the 
first problems leading to equations of the third degree 
ever devised for practical purposes. As was said be-
-P-A-G-E-212
  194 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
fore, such problems exist, but people solve them by 
guessing methods. 
Problem 1. Three contractors bid on an excavating 
job. The equipment that A has would have enabled 
him to complete the job alone 14 weeks faster than B, 
and 21 weeks faster than C. All three were put to 
work at the same time and finished the job in ten 
weeks. How much did each get if the contract price 
was $308,700? 
This is recognized as a variation of the cistern pro- 
blem. The characteristic formula is A = RT; amount 
of work = rate X time. 
Let x be the number of weeks that it would have 
taken the first man alone, and Q = the total amount of 
work done.

Which reduces to:

From this, we obtain z = 21. The second man re- 
quires 35 weeks, and the third 42 weeks, The first 
man gets 10/21 of the total amount, the second 10/35, 
the third 10/42. 
If there had been four contractors in the problem, 
we should have had an equation of the fourth degree, 
and so on. 
Problem 2. A man wishes to travel 135 miles in his 
automobile in a certain number of hours. After trav- 
eling 45 miles at the scheduled rate, he is delayed a 
half-hour. He then goes 5 miles per hour faster than 
before, traveling thus 70 miles more. Then he in- 
creases his speed 5 miles an hour for the remaining 20 
miles, and arrives on schedule time. Find his original 
rate. 
Since the distances are all given, we shall not use d 
for distance in the diagram. 
We can make the following relating statements: 
1. The sum of the distances is 135 miles. 
2. The scheduled rate, R, equals the rate for the 
first 45 miles; the increased rate for 70 miles is
-P-A-G-E-214
  196 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
R+ 5; for the 20 miles it is R+ 10. 
3. The total time is the traveling time + the delay. 
135 = 45 + 70 + 20 ()

Clearing of fractions: 
R’ + 15 R* — 1050 R — 9000 = 0 
From this the value R = 80 is obtained. 
It is clear that, if we had introduced one or more 
additional changes in the rate, we should have ob- 
tained equations of the fourth or higher degree. The 
relation diagram, however, would not have become 
any more complex. 
Change of setting 
The setting of a many-situation problem can be 
changed as easily as the setting of simpler problems. 
We give a few examples. 
Example 1. Two competing merchants are selling 
suits of the same kind and at the same price. Each 
sells 12 suits. A cuts the price $3 per suit and sells 8
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 197 
suits at the new price. B cuts the price $6 a suit and 
sells 18 at the new price. Each deposits the same 
amount in the bank as a result of the sale. What was 
the price before the cut? 
Example 2. Twelve boxes of apples cost $3 per box 
more than 8 boxes of pears. The apples and pears 
were exchanged for 12 boxes of peaches and 18 sacks of 
potatoes. The peaches cost as much as the apples, 
and the potatoes cost $6 a sack less than a box of 
apples. What was the cost of a box of apples? 
Example 8. Ten hours after a burglary was com- 
mitted, a detective starts after the burglar, gaining 3 
miles every hour on the former. After he had been 
gone 8 hours, he increased his speed 3 miles an hour. 
But at this time the burglar also increased his speed 
83 miles an hour. It took the detective 12 hours to 
overtake him, after he had increased his speed. How 
far did they go? 
These three examples can be solved by means of the 
same relation diagram, the only change being made in 
the interpretation of the characteristic formulas. We 
give the diagram for the last example. 
D + D, = d + d

Solving the vertical equations for the d’s and substitut-

Substituting the values of R,, 7, and 7, 
8R+12(R+38)=18(R-3)+12R 
20 R+ 36= 30 R—- 54 
Whence R= 9.   
Interesting variations may be obtained by making 
one rate decrease while the other increases. 
A further illustration 
The following is an example of the class of problems 
which become possible of solution when the relation- 
diagram method is used. We may classify it as a pro- 
blem having a very simple setting and very complex 
relationships. It should be especially noted that the 
symbolic manipulation is facilitated by the recognition 
of the fact that the quantities eliminated in pairs are of 
the same dimension, and therefore will bear a numeri- 
cal ratio to each other. The reader will probably find 
it easier to build a diagram and translate the relations 
from the statement of the problem than to check the 
equations on the diagram below.   
Problem. A man and a boy were hired to work on a 
certain job. They started at 8 a.m. and finished one 
half of the job the first day. The boy came alone at
-P-A-G-E-217
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 199 
8 a.m. the next day and worked for one third of the 
time that it would have taken the man to do the whole 
job alone. Then the man came and finished the job 
alone, working two hours later than he worked the first 
day, doing twice as much work as the boy did the first 
day. What proportion of the money should each get? 
The characteristic formula is: Amount done = rate 
of working X time. 
This is clearly a four-situation problem; two for each 
day. Let Q = one half of the job.

Substituting in (1), we find 7, = 2, and T = 2. 
Substituting in (2), we find r/R = 1/2, or 2r= R, 
and since Q = 1 (one half of the job): 
rt+ RT = 1, or 8r= 1/2. 
r= 1/6, and R= 1/3. 
That is, the boy does one twelfth of the job per hour, 
and the man one sixth. 
The difficulty of the symbolic solution will probably 
be better realized if the conventional symbols are used. 
Thus, let: 
r=2,R=y, T, =v, T, = 2, and T =t. 
Then the above equations can be written as follows: 
2/3y=w 
awt+ yz=1 
yz/2+ yt=1 
y2/2 = xt 
t=wtz-2.
-P-A-G-E-220

In this form there is not any hint as to the procedure 
to be followed. The conventional symbols for un- 
knowns do not suggest that the ratios of some of the 
quantities are numerical. 
Six- and eight-situation problems 
The many-situation problem is often met. Bulky 
statements usually make such problems appear more 
difficult than they really are. The analyses are often 
easy, once the various situations are clearly under- 
stood, and the right symbolic notation is used. The 
following is an example of a six-situation problem, 
solved by eliminating rates in pairs. 
Problem. A and B start to run a race to a certain 
post and back again. A, returning, meets B 90 yards 
from the post, and arrives at the starting-place 3 
minutes before him. If, then, he returns immediately 
to meet B, he would meet him at one sixth of the dis- 
tance between the post and the starting-point. Find 
the length of the course and the duration of the race. 
Let the distance between the posts be = z. 
Taking the first pair of situations, A, returning, 
meets B;:

THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 208 
Since T = D/R, we obtain by substitution in the T 
equation: 
D/R = d/r, or R/r = D/d. 
Substituting this value in (1), 
R/r= (x+ 90) + (2 — 90) (2) 
Taking the last set of conditions: 
If the distance between the two posts is x, then A 
runs 22+ 2/6, or 13 2/6, and B runs 22-— 2/6, or 
  11 2/6. 
_ Then: 
D/d= RT/rt = R/r = 18/11 (8) 
Comparing (2) and (8), 
13_ 2+90

Whence x = 1080 yards. 
The time can easily be found from Situation 2 and 
the ratio of the rates. We give the diagram,

Whence T = 16.5. 
This problem can be solved by arithmetic methods 
once the necessary relations are perceived. But 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
while such solutions can be perceived after the pro- 
blem is solved, the relation-visualizing process is too 
difficult to be used in most cases. We give one 
solution: 
A lead of 180 yards for one half the race makes 360 
yards for the whole race. { 
But this is one sixth of the distance. 
Therefore the whole distance is 360 X 6 = 2160 
yards. 
And the distance between the posts is 1080 yards. 
i Another six-situation problem. 
Problem. Early in the morning mail accumulates in 
an office. During the working day it arrives at a uni- 
form rate. At first the office practice was to put the 
entire force of 22 clerks to work sorting it at the be- 
ginning of the working day, the job being done in 20 
minutes. Later the number of clerks was reduced to 
12. These catch up with the incoming mail in one 
hour. As it is desired to reduce the office force still 
further, the manager wishes to know: (1) How many 
clerks will be needed to catch up with the incoming 
mail in 5 hours? (2) How many clerks will be needed 
to keep up with the mail the rest of the day? 
The characteristic formula is: Amount = rate of 
work X time. 
Let R = the rate of work of one clerk, and x = the 
number of clerks necessary to keep up with the incom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 205 
ing mail. Then a R is the rate at which the mail is 
arriving. 
The basal relation is clearly: 
Amount accumulated before working hours + 
amount that comes in during working hours = amount 
disposed of: 
A+ A, = Ay 
It is clear that the rate of working is the rate of one 
clerk multiplied by the number of clerks.

Solving (1) and (2) for A and comparing: 
12 — x= 22/3— 2/3 
86—32= 22-2 
Whence x = 7. 
That is, seven men can keep up with the mail.. An 
obvious proportion solves the rest of the problem. 
While this solution is clear and satisfies the beginner, 
the more advanced student would probably attack the
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
problem as follows, using relationships not so directly 
mentioned: 
In both cases the accumulated amount is the same 
and hence must be removed in the same number of 
clerk-hours; that is, (22 — x) clerks working for one 
third of an hour do the same work as (12 — 2) clerks 
working for one hour; or: 
(22 — 2) X1/8= (12—2)X1

an abbreviated plan of solution. 
We may change the setting of this problem to the 
following: 
Example. The work on a contract is delayed by a 
storm. In order to get back to schedule time the con- 
tractor increases his force to 22 men for a period of 
8 days. Later another storm of the same duration as 
the first forces him to employ 12 men for 9 days. Ifno 
delay had occurred, how many men would have been 
sufficient?

  THE ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS 207 
Example. Coal is on deck and coal is running on 
the deck from a chute at a uniform rate. Twelve men 
can clear the deck in an hour, while 22 men can clear it 
in 20 minutes. How many men can keep the deck 
clear after it has once been cleared? 
An eight-situation problem leading to simultaneous 
cubics will finish our analysis of algebraic problems. 
Problem. A launch sails across a still lake, then 
down a river having a current of 2 miles an hour, the 
distance down the river being equal to the distance 
across the lake. Without stopping, it then returns to 
its starting-point, the round trip taking 3 hours. An- 
other launch, sailing faster by 2 miles an hour than the 
first, can make the round trip in 2 hours. What is the 
distance across the lake?

using the function method of analysis, can obtain from 
problems of the constant rate type equations so com- 
plex that the practiced mathematician’s manipulative 
skill will be taxed to obtain a solution. And since 
analysis is comparatively easily learned, the necessity 
for mastering symbolic manipulation is again em- 
phasized. This forms a natural basis for motivating 
formal drill.

CHAPTER IX 
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA IN SCHOOL 
AND IN LIFE 
Tue preceding chapters were concerned mainly with 
the development of sound and systematic methods of 
procedure. The material used was shown to be of 
secondary importance. The main aim is to teach the 
pupil to solve problems before teaching him any one 
kind of problem; to develop skills, habits, and attitudes 
rather than to impart specific knowledge. To be sure, 
problems with practical settings are used once in a 
while for the purpose of maintaining the indispensable 
connection with life and of stimulating the pupil to see 
that there are problems to be solved. But academic 
problems are the principal tools used. 
On the other hand, the student will have to use his 
skill in the solution of life problems. On this every one 
agrees. But here, as in the case of the function con- 
cept and of other fundamentals, we find that, while 
every one speaks of life problems, no one defines them. 
Very few even try to establish the difficult connection 
between book and life. The following questions, then, 
are in order: 
What are the problems that we meet in life? 
What is their nature, their complexity; how do they 
present themselves? Just what skill, technique, and 
information is needed to solve them?
-P-A-G-E-229
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 211 
As in many other life situations, a thorough investi- 
gation of what is needed will suggest a definition of the 
trouble, a clear statement. This clear statement will 
suggest a method of procedure. 
A fallacy 
A widespread fallacy is that children will learn 
science and mathematics when confronted with real 
problems of their own. Let them feel the desire or 
need to do something, and they will study and rea- 
son in the attempt to satisfy that desire. So it is 
argued. 
But we find in practice that nothing of the kind 
happens. The children are almost sure to resort to the 
crudest of means of their own invention unless they are 
trained beforehand to adopt technical methods. In- 
stead of preparing for solution by means of a thorough 
study of the situation, they will start with some very 
vague plan, trusting to luck and inspiration to help 
them in the disposition of troublesome details. 
This trait is not peculiar to children. Untrained 
and unskilled adults exhibit it. Even persons trained 
along given lines show it in other and unaccustomed 
conditions. With this trait in mind, let us examine 
the average citizen’s need of algebra. 
The need of algebra 
The amount of training in algebra actually needed 
by the people at large has been a burning issue in edu-
-P-A-G-E-230
  212 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
cational circles for a long time. Eminent authorities 
have stated that all the algebra that can be assimilated 
should be taught to all the people capable of learning; 
just as great authorities have asserted that the amount 
actually needed by the masses is infinitesimally small. 
This divergence of opinion exists mainly because the 
exact nature of the material used in practice and of the 
material presented in class is rather vaguely under- 
stood. 
The first group of experts has so far presented but 
few if any valid proofs that high-school algebra de- 
serves an obligatory position on the curriculum. The 
members of the second group are in still worse position. 
Their strongest argument is founded on fallacious 
reasoning. They generally start from the right pre- 
mise, “People use very little algebra,” but arrive at the 
wrong conclusion, “Therefore they have very little 
need of it.” 
Inadequacy of usual research 
The usual method of analyzing the situation by 
examining the nature, complexity, and frequency of 
problems met by the average person will always yield 
inconclusive results because: 
1. The investigator cannot possibly visualize all of 
some one else’s activities, opportunities, and 
needs. Asa very large number of persons in each 
class of society have to be investigated and ques- 
tioned before the name scientific can be applied to
-P-A-G-E-231
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 213 
the research, the difficulty of the task becomes 
apparent. ut 
2. If the person questioned does not understand 
algebra well enough to use it, his opinion is of 
little value and the investigation of his activities 
and needs by the question method becomes al- 
most impossible. 
8. Seeking for specific or possible uses of algebra in 
trades or occupations is to a large extent a useless 
activity, unless the investigator is thoroughly 
familiar with all the conditions met at all times. 
Otherwise very few problems will be found. 
Thirty years of industrial experience in shop and 
construction work, in constant contact with various 
classes of clerks, artisans, and laborers, have enabled 
the author to appreciate the needs, unexpressed wants, 
and dissatisfaction with the present methods of in- 
struction felt by these people. Too many writers 
seem to have formed their opinions from reading one 
anothers’ books and from interviewing a few educated 
foremen and employers. 
A rational basis of investigation 
The need of algebra in vocations or other life activ- 
ities can best be appreciated after an examination of 
the results obtained by people who get along without 
it; how ineffectively they dispose of their material, 
their time, their energy, their earnings, their savings; 
how unwisely they act in various situations in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    
214 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
algebraic notions and processes would be of assistance. 
It will be found that people do not use algebra simply 
because they do not know how to use it. They do not 
miss something that they never possessed. Not know- 
ing what can be done through algebra, nor even what it 
is, people fail to perceive the need of it in their own lives. 
They are much like savages who never miss the 
benefits and comforts of an undreamed-of civilization. 
When a savage finds himself in a situation where he 
would be benefited or his life saved through the use of 
the tools or drugs of civilization, he uses whatever 
makeshifts are available, prospers or fails, lives or dies, 
in blissful ignorance of the factors that really deter- 
mine the issue. Similarly, our average citizen, when 
confronted by some situation requiring quantitative 
thinking and knowledge, calmly sidesteps the issue 
through the use of makeshifts, the guess and trial-and- 
error methods. If lucky in his guesses, he becomes a 
prominent business man firmly convinced of the use- 
lessness of schooling. If unlucky, he is speedily re- 
moved from places of responsibility and his opinion is 
considered to be of no importance. 
Needs more real than apparent 
The need of “sound quantitative notions” is more 
realthan apparent. In this respect it may be classified 
with a large number of other needs. Many people see 
no need of “sound hygienic notions,” and have to be 
driven by law into taking the most elementary sanitary
-P-A-G-E-233
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 215 
precautions. The same may be said of sound notions 
about safety, fire hazards, citizenship, and so on. 
When we have not the slightest conception of the 
existence or use of a notion, we never miss it, and are 
likely to resent the attempts of well-meaning persons 
forcibly to impart information about it. 
To the mathematically trained observer, who is also 
active in life affairs, the lack and need of quantitative 
training are everywhere apparent. By quantitative 
training, however, is not meant the ability to solve 
equations of any particular degree or complexity or to 
demonstrate theorems, but the ability to perceive the 
existence of quantities and their relations, accom- 
panied by the ability to use the results of observation 
of these relationships in everyday activities. 
But such perception and ability are seldom met and 
seldom developed in our schools because educators do 
not seem to be able to visualize the industrial or gen- 
eral life situations that lead to problems. Business 
men often comment on the fact that persons who study 
and teach only book mathematics frequently display 
an amazing lack of ability to recognize geometrical 
figures, relating lines and essential quantities in actual 
objects; that they even fail to perceive the existence of 
physical problems which are obvious to men more 
accustomed to handling their environments. Howcan 
we expect men so poorly equipped to plan mathemati- 
cal courses providing training in recognition of essen- 
tial measurements in practical work?
-P-A-G-E-234
  
  216 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
The cost of ignorance 
The lack of clear objectives in teaching produces 
disastrous results. The words inefficient, irrespon- 
sible, unreliable, describe a large percentage of our 
population, lacking in sound quantitative reasoning 
ability, lacking the ability to relate, to associate, to put 
two and two together. Millions of people fail in their 
careers, millions waste their resources and the re- 
sources of the nation, millions waste their lives and 
health because the relations among the quantities 
surrounding them are unintelligible to them. 
“But,” will object the reader, “how will the ability 
to solve simultaneous quadratics or to find the area of 
acycloid help these people? Of what use are sines and 
cosines to a pick-and-shovel man? How will the 
ability to simplify an ‘apartment-house’ fraction help 
the busy housewife, the tired business man, or the 
movie actor?” 
This brings us to the important part of our discus- 
sion. The kind of algebra taught at the present time 
is of little use to most people. While some transferred 
value may be claimed for it, and while some general 
development is undoubtedly obtained, these two ends 
hardly justify imposing the study on everybody. The 
important question before us is, then: 
The key question 
Are symbolic manipulation and the solution of a few 
book problems the whole of algebra for the average
-P-A-G-E-235
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 217 
man? Is the study of these two the study of algebra? 
Since algebra is a key course, the fate of secondary 
mathematics depends upon the answer that educators 
will give to this question in the next few years. If they 
answer in the affirmative, then the widely prevalent 
tendency to remove mathematics from the secondary 
curriculum can only continue to gather strength. The 
people at large do not use secondary mathematics; 
they see no more use for it than they see for Greek, and 
will soon refuse to foot the bills for teaching it. Al- 
ready the observant teacher notices a deterioration in 
the classroom attitude toward the subject. Bad news 
travels fast, and many schools enroll propagandists 
who tell their fellow students about more enlightened 
high schools where they have pitched “Math.” over- 
board. 
But if symbolic manipulation and academic pro- 
blems are not the whole of algebra, then what is the 
rest? Or, rather, what is the whole of algebra? What 
did: the people want when they demanded algebra in 
the high schools a few decades ago? An attempt will 
be made to answer this last question. 
What the people want 
People dimly perceived that algebra was the science 
of “figuring,” of measuring indirectly. Calculating 
values has been a world’s need ever since men began to 
design, sell, make, and use material; in short, to handle 
quantities. Mathematics was originally devised to 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
218 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
measure quantities expeditiously and accurately. 
‘Symbols were devised to expedite mathematical opera- 
tions. Laws governing the use of these symbols were 
discovered. We all know the history of the develop- 
ment of the science and how the applications of mathe- 
matical methods revolutionized industry and enriched 
the few. 
But how is the average citizen faring at present? 
His little stock of quantitative wisdom has not kept 
pace with the increased complexity of his business en- 
vironment. If anything, it has fallen behind owing to 
reduction in number of his opportunities to learn from 
home environment. It is insufficient to enable him to 
share fairly in the benefits of civilization. People who 
have discovered his quantitative ignorance are taking 
advantage of him at every turn. Everything is cun- 
ningly devised to separate a “quantitatively ignorant” 
person from the results of his labor and to give him the 
minimum in return. Fashions are devised which make 
him discard perfectly good clothes, houses, machinery, 
and appliances long before they have outlived their 
usefulness. Small packages have replaced bulk goods. 
“Free” delivery and so-called “service” in numberless 
lines are indulged in by people who cannot afford them, 
but do not know that they cannot. Middlemen thrive 
whose sole excuse for considering themselves useful is 
that they are able to attach themselves leechlike to 
some unnecessary detail of distribution. Money that 
should be reserved for necessities or a “rainy day”’ is
-P-A-G-E-237
     A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 219 
wasted on fancied needs or illusory pleasures, the desire 
for which is created by advertising. Individual and 
national waste have replaced thrift. Our forests, our 
coal, our petroleum, the fertility of our lands, are going 
the same way as the buffaloes and wild pigeons went. 
Classes, blocs, and groups are trying to promote their 
selfish interests with blind disregard of the conse- 
quences to the rest of the people. Everywhere we 
notice poverty, discomfort, and discontent produced 
by the lack of quantitative thinking. Men seem to 
have lost their sense of relative cost, their sense of 
values. 
What they are taught 
But did they ever in their school years acquire 
enough of this sense to function under modern condi- 
tions? Have they ever learned, are our pupils learning 
now, to put two and two together? Are they getting 
now a training in associating, in relating quantities? 
No; they are merely learning to juggle symbols as fast 
as possible. They are taught (?) to express by means 
of algebraic symbols relations that they do not per- 
ceive and cannot express in plain English. 
Our present aim seems to be to train them to work a 
hundred examples a day in case they should become 
assistants to persons who discover, formulate, and 
solve a hundred problems a day, and who leave the fin- 
ishing details to their assistants. We develop spe- 
cialists in the solution of examples; that is, our children
-P-A-G-E-238
220 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
learn only a part of a mental process. We teach them 
how to steer and “step on the gas.” A knowledge of 
the machine is not needed so long as they are willing to 
pay exorbitant prices for more or less fictitious service 
to keep the machine in running order. 
The efficiency fad in elementary mathematics 
A study of past conditions and methods is often 
illuminating. Our fathers did not try to cover as much 
ground as we do; what they did attempt they covered 
more thoroughly than we. Their arithmetics and al- 
gebras were of insignificant size when compared to our 
modern catalogues of rules and short cuts. They 
seem to have paid more attention to reasoning than to 
rules, to methods than to immediate results, to train- 
ing than to information. 
But this is an age of efficiency and of efficiency 
experts. The latter are people who can improve any- 
thing developed by our fathers simply by applying 
“scientific” methods to it. Unfortunately, these 
improvements are usually evanescent because some 
fundamental underlying principle has been overlooked. 
Thus we have had scientific management of labor 
which would have revolutionized industry if our work- 
men had but consented to be devitalized or brutalized 
in the course of a few years. 
But children are more easily experimented upon 
than men. Also they stay in school only a few years; 
that is, educational mistakes, like medical mistakes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 221 
are quickly hidden from view. If exposed by mis- 
chance, it is a simple matter to place the blame on 
teachers who did not follow instructions, or upon the 
natural perversity of youth; therefore, efficiency ex- 
perts flourish in our educational system. They are 
applying scientific methods which “expose” the child 
to numberless bits of desultory information, and they 
make him go through the most efficient motions used 
in business or industry. The only thing he lacks is a 
clear understanding of what is acquired and of how to 
use it for any purpose whatsoever. 
We may compare the modern school child looking 
for an education to a green athlete who wants to train 
for long-distance running. His efficiency expert has 
read that old-time athletes ran twenty miles every day 
when training, and his sense of efficiency rebels against 
such a waste of time and effort. Why not use modern 
methods to cover the distance? Why not use an 
automobile? The athlete could then cover twice the 
amount of ground and do it ten times as fast as the old- 
fashioned runner, besides learning how to run a ma- 
chine. Tangible results will be obtained more quickly 
and with less effort! 
Similarly, in mathematics rules and short cuts give 
quick and immediate results. Ten times as many pro- 
blems are solved. A large amount of (book) ground is 
quickly covered. But these results are obtained at the 
expense of organization, thinking, and the formation of 
desirable habits of concentration and suspended judg. 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  222 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
ment. We save a good deal of time so far as obtaining 
answers to conventional questions is concerned, and we 
also save a deal of effort in slow, cumbersome, elemen- 
tary thinking. But does this develop sound mental 
habits? 
What the people need 
People need the algebra of quantities and relation- 
ships before they can use the algebra of numbers and 
other symbols. Handling the symbols of thought is 
not synonymous with thinking. 
But what is this mysterious algebra of quantities 
and relationships? 
Casual observers are often puzzled by the efficient 
and successful way in which apparently ignorant and 
untrained men handle their business. According to 
all the canons of scholarship, they are incompetents, 
should fail, should be replaced by our college gradu- 
ates. Instead of this they amass fortunes or give other 
evidence of ability and efficiency while the college grad- 
uates work for them in subordinate positions. A care- 
ful analysis will reveal at least one factor of their suc- 
cess: almost invariably they have sound quantitative 
notions and the ability to keep a problem in mind un- 
til it is solved to their entire satisfaction. Their rea- 
soning shows that they perceive clearly the relations 
among quantities, although they cannot express them 
in symbolic language. 
Two hundred and fifty high-school graduates were
-P-A-G-E-241
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 223 
given recently an examination containing this problem 
among others: If Sam can do a job in 2 days and Jim 
can do the same job in 8 days, how long would it take 
them to do the job if they worked together? One stu- 
dent answered 0 days, probably having attempted to 
subtract 3 from 2. Another, obtaining —1 by the 
same method, interpreted it “less than one day.” 
Others, more fortunate in their selection, obtained 1 
day, having subtracted 2 from 3. Quite a few ob- 
tained 5 days, and some deduced 6 days, the method 
being obvious: The most popular answer was 23 days 
— the “average length of time.” Only six students 
gave the right answer. Of these six, how many solved 
the problem because they remembered the traditional 
method of solving “work” or “cistern” problems, and 
not through reasoning out the situation, unfortunately 
was not mentioned in the report, but it is fairly safe to 
assert that most did. 
The same problem was proposed to a number of un- 
schooled but successful men. While most of them 
were unable to give the correct answer, all the an- 
swers showed a recognition of the relationships in- 
volved and all their guesses approximated very closely 
the correct answer. 
The students had juggled symbols in order to obtain 
meaningless answers, while the business men had kept 
the conditions of the problem in mind, gathered 
thoughts, arranged them, passed judgments, arrived at 
tentative conclusions, compared the conclusions with 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
ee errr nee 
224 TEACHING OF — ALGEBRA 
the conditions, and reached final conclusions. They 
had used a rudimentary algebra of quantities and rela- 
tions without symbols, crude and slow, to be sure, 
but effective enough for their needs. Most of them 
were entirely unaware of the fact that mathematical 
processes are in existence which would have enabled 
them to obtain correct answers in a fraction of the time 
used. 
The arithmetic solution given by persons possessing 
sound habits of reasoning is as follows: 
In one day A does one half of the work. 
In one day B does one third of the work. 
In one day A and B together do five sixths of the 
work. 
Since five sixths of the work is done in five fifths of 
one day, one fifth of a day is required to do one sixth of 
the work, and six fifths of a day will be required to do 
the whole job. 
But it is impossible to teach children to solve pro- 
blems by such a method. A careful analysis of the 
solution shows that two quantities are inextricably 
mixed in the statements: the amount of work and the 
rate of doing the work. The teacher solving the pro- 
blem vaguely perceives some quantities and relation- 
ships and uses terms which approximately translate his 
thoughts. He cannot explain the mental process. He 
can only show the finished product, the steps in reason- 
ing. The pupil understands the reasoning and may 
even learn the steps for that particular problem, but is
-P-A-G-E-243
     A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 225 
“absolutely incapable of solving some similar problem 
in which the relationships are different. Thus, the 
problem — 
Two men together can do a piece of work in 4.8 days. 
One man requires 4 days less than the other to do the 
work alone. Find the number of days each requires 
alone — 
cannot be solved by arithmetic methods. 
Quantitative thinking 
The efficient person, then, is he who has somehow 
acquired the ability to recognize situations and quanti- 
tative relations, to gather data toward a given end, to 
relate cause and effect, to form correct judgments. 
When such a person has a quantitative problem to 
solve, he systematically twists it around, analyzes it, 
keeps it in the focus of his attention, looking at it from 
different points of view, while the “stream of con- 
sciousness” continues to deliver new suggestions for 
examination, acceptance, or rejection. Through a 
process of weighing data, of trial-and-error, an ap- 
proximately correct result is finally obtained. We may 
call this process arithmetic reasoning without numbers, 
or an algebraic method in which quantities are used 
instead of their symbols. 
The trained mathematician would have solved the 
same problem correctly in a fraction of the time 
through the use of algebraic laws and symbols — if it 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  226 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
had been presented to him all formulated, with the 
irrelevant details removed, with all the conditions 
necessary, all ready for analysis. But trained mathe- 
maticians do not often solve the world’s problems, usu- 
ally because the problems are not formulated when 
they present themselves in the everyday processes of 
industry and commerce. They are solved by the man 
who discovers them, often without the formality of 
writing them down. 
Problems in life 
The last sentences give the key to the situation. 
Ninety-nine per cent of the world’s problems are never 
formulated. Problems in industry and other activ- 
ities seldom advertise themselves. All that there is to 
make you suspect that there is a problem of some sort 
somewhere around is the fact that things are not run- 
ning smoothly, that your competitor is succeeding 
better than you are, or that your promotion is slow in 
coming. After the problem is solved, you realize that 
its difficulty lay in searching for, comparing, and select- 
ing data; that is, in recognizing quantities. Symbolic 
solution is usually the least difficult part of the pro- 
cess, and approximate results usually answer the pur- 
pose. 
This, then, is the reason why present-day methods 
fail to satisfy the public. We are not training children 
to recognize problems in their environment, to formu- 
late them after recognizing them, to analyze them
-P-A-G-E-245
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 227 
after formulating them, to bring in related situations 
and quantities during the analysis. We do not even 
teach them what quantities are! All that we teach 
them to do is to take the results of some one else’s ob- 
servation, or, worse still, merely to take the results of 
analysis already translated into symbols, apply certain 
complicated rules and principles, and obtain some re- 
sult meaningless to them. This is not the mathe- 
matics needed or wanted by the public, nor ever can 
be. 
Tur Remepy 
Specific definition of needs 
The average citizen needs: 
1. The ability to recognize problems in his environ- 
ment; 
2. The ability to recognize the quantitative features 
of these problems; 
8. The habit of suspending judgment in quantita- 
tive matters, which habit leads to the practice of 
gathering all the factors bearing on a situation 
and of weighing their relative values; 
4, The ability to state a problem properly; 
5. The ability to reduce the solution of a problem to 
a single thought embracing a general plan; 
6. A clear conception of the comparison process; 
7. Skill in the translation process: in deciding when 
to multiply or divide, in selecting formulas, in 
writing equations;
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
8. Knowledge of quantities and units of measure- 
ment; 
9. Manipulative skill and accuracy. 
Without this last people naturally dislike and avoid 
written calculations, But manipulative skill and ac- 
curacy are of very little use without the other elements 
involved in quantitative thinking. 
The nature of life problems 
Earlier discussion in this book has outlined a method 
and technique by means of which quantitative think- 
ing, conscious and systematic thinking about quan- 
tities and relationships, can be developed. 
But in this chapter it has been shown that when the 
pupil has learned to solve problems of the types de- 
scribed, we cannot consider our task completed. We 
have not yet given him all that we should, for he is not 
yet ready to attack the problems of life. 
It is not intended to examine here commercial pro- 
blems dealing with money and goods. These quan- 
tities are usually well understood, and the problems 
involving them arise naturally and directly. Nor is it 
intended to examine the comparatively small number 
of complex problems met in specialized activities only, 
and hence of little interest to the general public. We 
are concerned rather with the large class of problems 
involving mensuration or the application of the prin-

ciples of mechanics. The increasing number of such 
problems found in elementary textbooks indicates that 
educators recognize their importance in civilized en- 
vironment. 
Experience has shown that training in the solution of 
these problems by means of formulas, rules, and type 
solutions seldom functions in later life. The principal 
reason for this is that an essential condition is usually 
overlooked. 
A condition essential to the solution of practical pro- 
blems 
We are familiar with certain quantities, slightly ac- 
quainted with other quantities, and totally ignorant 
of still others. We can perceive relationships between 
quantities only when these quantities are familiar. The 
merchant is familiar with money, time, and percent- 
age; the farmer can think quantitatively when live 
stock and crops are discussed; the chemist is at home 
among molecules; and so on. In these days of spe- 
cialization, every trade and profession has its own 
problems involving characteristic quantities. These 
quantities are used so frequently that the relationships 
become as well known as the quantities. The result is 
that complex problems are often solved by persons ap- 
parently ignorant and untrained. But the process of 
acquiring such a familiarity is long-drawn-out and 
painful. We seek to accelerate it and make it less dis- 
agreeable when we teach algebra, that organized set of
-P-A-G-E-248
  230 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
principles and processes by means of which problems 
in general can be solved. We present problems se- 
lected from various phases of human activity. But 
are we not frequently overlooking the fundamental 
principle quoted above? Is it reasonable to expect 
that children can perceive relationships among quan- 
tities, when they have never perceived the quantities 
themselves? 
Let an American teacher propose the following pro- 
blem to his class: If a dozen apples cost sixpence, how 
many apples will you get for a crown? Will it be a 
sign of low mentality if a boy fails to solve this pro- 
blem, or simply an indication that he does not know 
the relationship between the unfamiliar quantities, a 
penny and a crown? 
The concept of the moment of a force as a unit 
quantity 
Here is another illustration. Every teacher of 
physics knows that the principle of moments is very 
difficult to teach. A class may solve a large number of 
problems involving the law of the lever and other ap- 
plications, yet simple problems requiring a clear per- 
ception of that quantity called moment of a force, the 
tendency of a force to cause rotation about a point, are 
not solved. Why not? Because the quantity called 
moment of a force is invariably eliminated in “writing 
down” the equation. We write F X L, and the child 
perceives the quantities force and lever-arm length, but
-P-A-G-E-249
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 281 
does not perceive that quantity which tends to produce 
rotation about a point.! 
Ignorance of this quantity then obliges the use of a 
number of rules and formulas. We understand that 
the principle of moments is the unifying thought, yet 
we do not use the concept of a moment of a force as a 
single quantity when solving a problem. The char- 
acteristic relationship M = FL is not learned, nor is 
the fundamental relationship M = m, when two situa- 
tions are described.2 Therefore, the formula FL = fl 
is not understood. But when we put this formula in 
the form f = Ewe go tothe limit of absurdity by sepa- 
rating the quantities involved in each individual situa- 
tion. Let us see how such a formula functions in life 
affairs. 
Problems involving moments 
A man going to market was asked to purchase a 
1 To a certain extent this is due to traditional methods in teaching 
physics. The unit moment is clearly the moment produced by a 
unit force at a unit distance from the point of rotation. But do we 
use the concept? It is interesting to note here that the unit of work 
is measured by a unit of force acting through a unit of distance; that 
is, it also equals F X L. To avoid confusion, the scientist calls units 
of work ergs, but leaves the bewildered schoolboy to struggle with 
foot-pounds in measuring two different quantities. The former uses 
a word which means a unit quantity to him, while the latter has to 
use a composite word not suggestive of unit quantity and having to 
be interpreted in two different ways. 
2 This relationship is usually expressed as M — m=O, or as 
= M = O, which formulas are approved by logicians, but incompre- 
hensible to too many students.

turkey for each of three neighbors. Upon his return it 
was found that the storekeeper had neglected to mark 
the weights separately. The receipt read: “To three 
turkeys, 37 lbs. @ 30¢ a pound, $11.10.” The turkeys 
being of different sizes and no scales being available, 
the problem was to determine the individual weights. 
Note the distinctive feature of the situation. It is 
desired to know the individual weights. The only 
quantities apparently available for the indirect meas- 
urement of these weights are the total weight and the 
total cost. Can the relationship of these quantities to 
the individual costs be established? Obviously not 
without additional measurements of some kind, for the 
purpose of introducing additional quantities and rela~ 
tionships. 
This problem was assigned to a class in physics after 
it had thoroughly(?) studied mechanics. No satis- 
factory solutions were offered. It was then suggested 
that the principle of moments could be used, and that 
it might be assumed that a foot-rule or measuring-tape 
was available. This hint did not produce any result. 
A mention of the law of levers did not help. Even the 
suggestion that the turkeys be balanced two at a time 
while tied to a balanced stick or to a stick of negligible 
weight did not prove sufficient. It was only when 
three equations containing the traditional 2’s, y’s, and 
2’s were written that the class perceived that, since the 
equations could be solved, the problem could be solved. 
The class was then ready to “solve” problems in
-P-A-G-E-251
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 233 
which the numbers were different and in which hams or 
pumpkins were weighed instead of turkeys. But does 
this readiness show that they had really learned the 
principle of moments so that it would be available 
when needed? 
The systematic mental process that should be used 
in the solution of this problem may be described some- 
what as follows: 
What scientific principle can be used in the solution? 
Since we want to find weights, we must use a principle 
involving weights. These are usually found by means 
of scales. Scales work on the principle that when 
moments are equal there is not any motion. Moments 
are measured by weights and lever-arms. Can we 
create a situation in which the lever-arms can be meas- 
ured? We can, by balancing the turkeys two at a 
time. We should then have sets of measurements re- 
lated by the fact that the sum of the weights is thirty- 
seven pounds. 
The formal analysis of the problem would then be as 
follows: 
We have a four-situation problem: turkeys A and B 
being balanced, then turkeys B and C being balanced. 
The characteristic formula is M = FL; the tendency 
of a weight to cause turning is equal to the product of 
the weight by the lever-arm. The following state- 
ments can be made: 
1. The sum of the weights A, B, and C is 37 pounds,
-P-A-G-E-252
  284 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
2. The moments are equal one to the other (since 
there is no turning).

And the lengths being known, the weights are quickly 
found. 
A few more examples relating to the principles of 
mechanics are given to illustrate the need of sound 
quantitative notions in actual experience. 
1. Three laborers were observed carrying straight 
timbers. One man supported one end, and the other 
two held a stick upon which the timber rested at a 
point one third of the total length, as measured from
-P-A-G-E-253
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 235 
the other end. This explanation was given by the 
laborers, and also by numerous other persons to whom 
the problem was later submitted: It stands to reason 
that the man at one end carries one third, and that the 
other two men carry two thirds, since the two thirds at 
their end, if cut off from the rest, would balance upon 
their stick! 
2. A number of men were loading telegraph poles on 
flatcars. They were told not to load any car above 
fifteen tons. On the other hand, the freight rate was 
by the carload; so that underloading would increase 
the shipping cost. No scales were available nor were 
the weights of the poles known. This problem was 
cleverly solved thus by the foreman: He balanced each 
pole in order to find its center of gravity, which he 
marked. He then balanced each pole off center, using 
his own (known) weight on one side. By measuring 
the lever-arms, the approximate weight of each pole 
was then easily calculated. 
8. A heavy engine was being installed. A substan- 
tial inclined runway was built, the plan being to roll 
the machine up to its foundation. No account was 
taken of the known weight of the engine nor of the 
pulling force available. The slope of the runway 
proved too steep, so, after wasting valuable time on 
futile efforts, the machine had to be backed off and the 
runway torn down and reconstructed correctly. The 
waste of time and material could have been avoided if 
the foreman had known the work equation W = FL, 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  236 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
the relationship work input = work output + friction, 
and had allowed twenty-five per cent for friction. 
4, A small community drew its water supply from 
individual wells. After an epidemic of typhoid fever, 
forty householders combined resources and installed a 
pipe bringing water to a reservoir from a distant river. 
The size of the supply pipe was “estimated” by experi- 
menting upon the amount delivered by a short section. 
Head and friction in long pipes and elbows were 
entirely overlooked factors. As soon as the reser- 
voir was filled, the service of er to the households 
commenced. Although the supply pipe was running 
day and night, the reservoir was emptied in four 
weeks. [ 
Sixteen more families joined the original group, a 
new “estimate” was made, and the first plant was 
duplicated. The two reservoirs were filled from the 
two pipes as before, before water was served to the 
households, but ten weeks later they were empty 
again. 
Before putting down a third pipe of the same size as 
the other two, the householders any to know whether 
it will provide enough additional water to insure a 
steady supply. 
The problem may be restated as follows: 
One full reservoir fed from one pipe serves 40 houses 
4 weeks. Two reservoirs fed by two pipes serve 56 
houses 10 weeks. The water flows into the reservoirs 
at a uniform rate. At what rate is the water flowing 
   
-P-A-G-E-255
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA |= 237 
into the reservoir and how much does the average 
household use? 
Let the amount of water in one full reservoir = Q. 
The amount incoming through one pipe in one week 
=G. 
The number of reservoirs = N. 
The number of households = n. 
The amount that one household uses in one week 
= 8. 
The time in weeks = T. 
We can make the relating statement: The amount of 
water in one reservoir (A:) plus the amount that flows 
in (A2) equals the amount used (As). 
There will be two relation diagrams of the form: 
Ait As= Az

Solution: 
NQ+ NGT =nST 
In the first case, 
Q+4G=160S 
In the second case, 
2Q+20G=560S 
Solving these gives: Q = 4G  
-P-A-G-E-256
238 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
That is, the rate of inflow is one fourth of the reservoir 
capacity per week. 
We also obtain: Q = 80S 
That is, one household uses one eightieth of the amount 
in one full reservoir each week (if no water flowed in). 
Hence, one supply pipe will provide enough water for 
twenty households. 
G=208 
And one additional pipe will, therefore, be sufficient for 
the needs of the fifty-six households. 
Mensuration formulas 
Our discussion would not be complete without some 
consideration of mensuration, since most elementary 
textbooks contain mensuration problems.   The ability to visualize objects 
and spatial imagination — is vei that is, pictorial 
unequally devel- 
oped in different children. Before assigning problems 
in mensuration, it is advisable to 
well the class can picture problem scertain just how 
conditions. Pre- 
sentations of the following type may be used: 
Show the class a cube, the edge 
three inches long, and say: 
“Notice that this cube is paint 
cut it into three equal flat slabs, t 
straight chalk lines showing the ‘s 
have cut the cube into slices one inc 
  of which is about 
Suppose that I 
us.” (Draw two 
ting planes.) “I 
h thick. Suppose
-P-A-G-E-257
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 239 
now that, keeping the slices together, I cut them thus.” 
(Show two more chalk lines at right angles to the first 
ones.) “I now have some blocks one inch by one inch 
by three inches long. Keeping the blocks together in 
the form of the original cube, I cut them again, thus 
...1 have now a number of small cubes. Some of 
them are painted on one face, some are painted on two 
faces, and so on. Now, without using pencil and 
paper, try to figure mentally how many cubes of each 
kind I have cut. Write down and hand in your result 
as soon as you are satisfied that you are right.” 
Repeat this explanation until every one understands 
the problem, and remove the cube from sight. 
Some of the children will find as many as fifty-six 
small cubes, while others will be satisfied with about a 
fourth of that number. Many will overlook the cube 
that is not painted on any face, or stoutly maintain 
that they can see small cubes painted on five or six 
faces. : 
After this, instruct the children to imagine that a 
piece is cut from each vertex of the cube and to count 
the new vertices and the old and new edges and faces 
mentally. Tabulate the results, right and wrong, on 
the blackboard, and discuss with the class. 
Teachers can obtain valuable information as to their 
pupils’ ability from such tests, especially if the children 
are questioned about their mental processes. 
It is a waste of time and effort to assign mensuration 
problems to be solved by rules and formulas without

  240 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
first making sure that the children have some percep- 
tion of the measurable features of the objects con- 
sidered; that is, of the quantities involved. It can 
only lead to a process of blind substitution in some 
uncomprehended formula, followed usually by a ma- 
nipulation of meaningless numbers, and producing a 
still more meaningless result. Thus the problem — 
A billet of steel is a inches thick, 2 a inches wide, and 
4ainches long. What are its dimensions if its weight 
is 2000 pounds, and the weight of one cubic inch of 
steel is .283 pound?

-P-A-G-E-259
  
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 241 
volves a process of abstraction and generalization addi- 
tional to the processes required for academic problems. 
We have to translate the names of objects into mathe- 
matical words, names of quantities, which through fre- 
quent association have acquired the power to recall 
certain formulas and processes. In short, we translate 
into an academic setting. Thus before we analyze a 
pulley problem, we must see that the feature that can 
be analyzed by mathematical methods is the circle, 
and understand that every time we meet the word 
pulley in the problem it means circle. Such a process 
immediately removes distracting details, and brings to 
our assistance the area and circumference formulas and 
the notion that the parts are interrelated, so that a 
change in one produces corresponding changes in all. 
Simple and obvious as this process of abstraction 
may seem to the habituated teacher, non-use of it is 
one of the main causes of the inability of students to 
apply to practical purposes what they have “learned,” 
and hence one of the causes of their growing dissatis- 
faction and lack of interest as the course progresses. 
To the inexperienced teacher it seems a matter of 
course that, once the geometric forms have been 
learned by name and their properties described, their 
uses and applications should become evident. But in 
practice we find that nothing is self-evident save to 
him who sees it. In our teaching experience we find 
that children will read problems about familiar objects 
having circular or rectangular features without feeling
-P-A-G-E-260
  242 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
the slightest necessity for recalling the formulas con- 
cerning circles or rectangles. The association between 
the circle seen in the textbook as a simple mathemat- 
ical figure occupying the field of attention alone, and 
the circle as one of the many measurable features of 
some ordinary object, has not been made. Hence the 
generalization that the properties of the circle become 
measurable features in circular objects is not made. 
For instance, children perceive pulleys, their diameters, 
and their circumferences, but apparently these percep- 
tions remain unrelated, hence cannot be considered 
together. 
We find that even formulas and rules apparently 
fail to form associations in children’s minds. This is 
probably because rules do not state explicitly that de- 
finite relations exist among the quantities concerned, 
that some are functions of others. Worded as they 
are, rules do not cause perception of relative magni- 
tude, hence pupils cannot form judgments of relative 
magnitude. 
Absurd answers to problems are often the result of 
this “rule” method of teaching. To the question — 
What is the circumference of a circle having a diameter 
of three inches? — the pupil is likely to answer 9.4248 
inches, 94.248 inches, or .94248 inches, if a mistake has 
been made in placing the decimal point. He recalls 
the rule, but has no perception of the relation between 
the magnitudes. The rule merely connects the cir- 
cumference and diameter through a number; that is, it
-P-A-G-E-261
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 243 
does not cause the pupil to make any comparison be- 
tween the two. For this reason it is to a large extent a 
useless activity to learn rules containing numbers as 
many textbooks give them, even though illustrative 
examples and problems immediately follow these rules. 
Comparison of academic and practical problems 
It will be instructive at this point to compare the 
formulations of one problem, first as given in academic 
textbooks, then as given in practical books. Such 
comparison leads to better methods of presentation. 
Let us first take the academic setting. 
  Find the length, Z, of a cylinder, A, the volume of 
which is equivalent to that of the solid, B (Fig. 14). 
The parts a and 6 of the solid are cylinders, c is a cone, 
and d the frustum of a cone. The diameters of A and 
B are equal. 
This statement contains all the technical words de- 
fining the quantities and relationships. It also con- 
tains a cue for formulating the hypothesis or plan of 
solution. But it does not contain any setting, any- 
thing to show that the studént may ever have to solve 
such a problem in order to earn his living. It is only
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
one problem out of the many in the book that look just 
like it; hence it is not of particular interest. 
In practical textbooks we should find the following 
setting: 
B shows the dimensions of a steel pin forged from 
the billet A. What was the length of A before forging? 
While this statement may be defended on the ground 
that it reproduces actual shop conditions, it is entirely 
unsuitable for beginners who are not very familiar 
with the mathematical terms into which the statement 
must be translated, and with the conventional methods 
used in showing shapes. It does not contain any clues 
to the solution. The essential relationship, that the 
volume remains unchanged, is difficult to perceive. 
Many students will get the impression that they are 
dealing with rectangular solids, or even with areas. 
This illustrates a defect commonly found in carelessly 
compiled books, one which needlessly aggravates the 
inherent difficulty of the problem. 
Aside from this, an experienced boy would challenge 
the usefulness of the problem on the ground that the 
shop practice is to estimate the length needed before 
cutting, allowing about one inch for waste. The cost 
of the material wasted would be less than the cost of 
calculating the exact length needed. The same criti- 
cism will apply to many “practical” problems. It is 
feasible to remedy this objection by supplementing 
such statements with some element of high cost of
-P-A-G-E-263
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 245 
material, safety of operation, quantity production, and 
soon. This makes the problem more interesting with- 
out overloading the statement proper. Thus our pro- 
blem might be presented as follows: 
A blacksmith has to make 500 forgings of the shape 
shown in B (Fig. 14), from long round bars. These are 
cut into lengths, Z, before forging. What should be 
the length, L, if no stock is to be wasted? 
Supplementary statement: 
The blacksmith needs the exact length because if the 
billets are too short they will be scrapped; if they are 
too long by one inch, 500 inches will be wasted. This 
means about 40 feet of the 3-inch bar. At 10 cents a 
pound, it would mean a waste of about $75. 
On looking over the last statement and comparing it 
with the other “practical” setting, we do not notice 
much difference so far as hints toward solution are con- 
cerned. The problem is more interesting, but it is 
more difficult than the academic problem. It must be 
simplified and translated into mathematical language 
before it can be solved. The latter alone has the 
power to recall automatically the formulas needed for 
the solution. 
Translating problems into academic language may 
appear lengthy to practical-minded teachers and 
authors. To them it looks very simple to call certain 
quantities x and y, and to write down the equation at 
   
-P-A-G-E-264
  246 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
once from the statement; then to explain why the 
equations are correct. But, while some beginners will 
be able to follow the reasoning, they will seldom learn 
the process. The ability to keep the end in view while 
mentally gathering the data is slow to develop. 
After a number of problems have been worked out 
and the reasons for the various steps are well under- 
stood, the preliminary work can be dispensed with, at 
least on paper. But even then the pupil should be 
instructed to go through the whole process mentally 
every time he solves a problem. We cannot repeat too 
often that nothing can be considered learned until it 
can be consciously recalled for a definite purpose. It 
cannot be recalled consciously unless it has been asso- 
ciated consciously. Finally, this association can be 
formed only if the teacher or the book repeats a 
definite formula, showing the chain of associations 
every time a problem is presented. 
Illustration of a chain of associations 
In a fly-wheel problem the chain of associations 
would run somewhat as follows: We solve practical 
problems by translating them into mathematical lan- 
guage, because mathematical terms do not distract at- 
tention from the essential parts of the problem. The 
geometric name of the fly-wheel is the circle. When 
we hear the word circle, we must recall immediately 
that the various parts of the circle are related in a de- 
finite way, and that these relations are described in 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 247 
formulas. What are the formulas of the circle? What 
are the formulas which show how the parts of the circle 
are related? 
Once such a chain of thoughts is established, the 
solution of the practical problems found in books 
through the use of formulas becomes easy as well as 
valuable. We shall not, therefore, spend more time in 
discussing the subject, except to suggest that a table of 
the more commonly used formulas be made by the 
pupil. Such a table would be of great value in recall- 
ing automatically to him the fact that the elements of 
formulas are interrelated, and in showing how needed 
dimensions are found. Comparatively few formulas 
are needed; it is best to put them together. 
We may summarize as follows: 
The true function of the practical problem is first to 
create interest by keeping in touch with life; second, at 
the end of the course, to apply the knowledge and skill 
developed. 
But so far as the actual learning process is con- 
cerned, the practical problem is worse than useless be- 
cause: (1) the student cannot learn a systematic 
method of solution based on the study of quantity 
relationships; (2) he cannot acquire skill in symbolic 
manipulation, the mechanical skill which is necessary 
if the plan of solution is to be kept in mind instead of 
attention being diverted to the successive steps; (3) 
solution by rules and blind substitution is not quanti- 
tative thinking.
-P-A-G-E-266
  248 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
The “life” problems given in our textbooks often 
exhibit the worst features of both the academic and the 
practical problem. They are difficult, and they are 
not interesting; they do not train for life, and they do 
not train for mathematics. The golden mean is not in 
the compromise problem; it is in the sane combina- 
tion of truly practical problems which aim to show 
the use of mathematics in difficult situations, and 
true academic problems presented with the sole aim 
of developing quantitative thinking and manipula- 
tive skill. 
But the student should not be kept in the dark in 
this matter. He should understand the purpose of the 
academic drill. He should be allowed to try his powers 
of analysis and symbolic solution on the difficult life 
problem once in a while. Such a course would show 
him his deficiencies and needs better than any other 
method. In short, the student should be shown the 
end in view: the difficult life problem, and the means 
through which he can learn to solve it: the academic 
problem. He must firmly believe that there must be a 
judicious mixture of theory and practice, of how and 
why. He must build his habits on a real understand- 
ing of the subject. 
The function concept in practical problems 
The most important concept, the unifying idea of 
mathematics, is the function concept. But, while the 
notion of dependence, of variation, of functionality, is
-P-A-G-E-267
A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 249 
useful in school mathematics, it is of little use when it 
is desired to establish fundamental relationships, and 
it is of still less use in practical life. In the latter case 
the notion that should be developed is not that quan- 
tities depend upon one another for their values, are re- 
lated, vary together; but that quantities can be made 
to depend on one another, can be related, can be made 
to vary together. 
This means that if we have some unknown quantity, 
the value of which must be found (the usual practical 
setting of a problem), we must start with the idea that 
there must be some quantity of the same kind some- 
where in the environment, or one that can be brought 
intoit. The unknown must be in some kind of a situa- 
tion; quantity number two must be in some similar 
situation. The two situations must be or can be re- 
lated, they must have something in common, or can be 
made to have something incommon. The discovery or 
introduction of these relationships means the solution 
of the problem, for once found or established they can 
be stated in sentences and these sentences can be 
translated into equations. 
The demonstration of such a process teaches the 
concept of a variable as a quantity that can be made to 
vary. An examination of the results of the changes 
produced in the physical environment by the variation 
of such a quantity would usually bring to light the

250 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Conclusion — A proposed sequence of topics 
The process of the perception of quantities, of formu- 
lation, and of analysis described in these pages can be 
taught to the child of ordinary ability; it has been 
taught, and it is not difficult to teach once the ob- 
jectives are clearly understood. The following se- 
quence of topics has been successfully used in a year’s 
course: 
1. Academic problems, in which the quantities and 
their relationships are clearly and fully given. 
Objective: To teach the recognition of quantities and 
the nature of relationships. To teach the statement of 
the relationships in plain English, then the translation 
of the relating sentences into equations, and the sym- 
bolic solution. 
2. Academic problems, in which some quantities or 
relationships, or both, are implied, or in which the 
relationships are more complex. 
Objective: To teach how to search for implied condi- 
tions. 
8. Practical problems of type 1. 
Objective: To teach translation into mathematical 
language. This step necessarily includes the study of 
technical terminology. 
4. Practical problems of type 2. 
Objective: To teach how to search for implied or 
related conditions.

  A JUSTIFICATION OF ALGEBRA 251 
5. Practical unformulated problems, stated as fol- 
lows: How would you find . . . (give a single un- 
known quantity and nothing else). 
Objective: To teach the student to make the relation, 
to search for significant data, and to formulate the 
problem. 
6. Analysis of industrial, household, or civic pro- 
blems stated as follows: Is this process efficient? 
What quantities enter as factors or can be made 
to enter as factors? Which can safely be varied? 
What would be the result of variation? 
Objective: To develop the ability to discover pro- 
blems in life work. 
It is plain that the ability to handle problems of 
types 5 and 6 would be useful to most citizens. Those 
authorities who stated that people should be taught as 
much mathematics as they can assimilate had visions 
of problems of this type. 
Those authorities who stated that the ability to 
solve quickly equations or formulas obtained from 
some one else’s analysis is of slight value were also 
right. Riding in an automobile will never develop a 
distance runner! 
Two conditions are essential for successful teach- 
ing: 
First, the teacher must know what he is teaching; he 
must understand the objectives, the means, and the 
fundamental principles.  
-P-A-G-E-270
  252 TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA 
Second, the student must know why he has to learn 
the subject, and must have some conception of the 
objectives, the means, and the fundamental 
ples. ! rinci-

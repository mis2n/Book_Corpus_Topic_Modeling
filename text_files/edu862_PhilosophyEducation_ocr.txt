  EDITOR’S PREFACE.

* Speculative Philosophy, appearing in volumes

tended for the use of philosophical students—

e English. An edition of two thousand copies 
printed in a separate volume. Demands for the 
continuing after the first edition was exhausted, it

on the whole work has been undertaken by the editor, 
who has also prefixed to it a full analysis of the text 
and commentary. 
It is believed that the book as it now appears will 
meet a want that is widely felt for a thorough-going 
Philosophy of Education. There are many useful and 
valuable works on “The Theory and Practice of Teach- 
ing,” but no work that entirely satisfies the description 
of a genuine Philosophy of Education. To earn this 
title, such a work must not only be systematic, but it 
must bring all its details to the test of the highest prin- 
ciple of philosophy. This principle is the acknowl 
_edged principle of Christian civilization, and, as such, 
Rosenkranz makes it the foundation of his theory of 
education, and demonstrates its validity by an appeal to 
psychology on the one hand and to the history of civi- 
lization on the other. 
This work, on its appearance, made an epoch in the 
treatment of educational theory in Germany. It brought 
to bear on this subject the broadest philosophy of mod- 
ern times, and furnished a standard by which the value 
of the ideas severally discussed by radicals and conserv- 
atives could be ascertained. It found the truth lying 
partly on the territory of the established order and 
partly on the territory of the reformers—Ratich, Co 
menius, Rousseau, Pestalozzi, and their followers. It 
showed what was valid in the idea that had come to be 
established in the current system of education, and also 
exposed the weakness that had drawn the attack of the 
reformers. : 
tts Author—Johann Karl Friedrich Rosenkranz 
was born at Magdeburg, April 23, 1805. He took up

his residence in Berlin in 1824, distinguishing himself 
as a disciple, first of Schleiermacher, and afterward of 
Hegel. In 1833 he became Professor of Philosophy at 
K6nigsberg, and occupied for forty-six years, until his 
death in 1879, the chair held for twenty-four years 
by the celebrated Herbart, and for thirty-four years by 
the still more celebrated Kant. He wrote extensive 
works on philosophy and literature, and published the 
present work in 1848 under the title of Paedagogik als 
System. 
Points of Great Value.—Special attention is called 
to the deep significance of the principle of self-estrange- 
ment (Selhst-Entfremdung) as lying at the foundation of 
the Philosophy of Education (p. 27). It furnishes a key 
to many problems discussed by the educational reformers 
from Comenius to Herbert Spencer. Since man’s true 
nature is not found in him already realized at birth, but 
has to be developed by his activity, his true nature 
is his ideal, which he may actualize by education. 
Hence the deep significance of this process. Man must 
estrange himself from his first or animal nature, and 
assimilate himself to his second or ideal nature, by 
habit. At first all things that belong to culture are 
strange and foreign to his ways of living and thinking. 
Education begins when he puts aside what is familiar 
and customary with him, and puts on the new ard 
strange—that is to say, begins his “self-estrangement.” 
The nature of such important matters as work and play 
(p. 28) and habit (§§ 29-34) becomes evident from this 
insight. 
The distinction of corrective and retributive punish- 
ment (§§ 38-45) is of great value practically in deciding

viii EDITOR'S PREFACE. 
upon the kind of punishment to use in an American 
school where pupils have a precocious sense of honor. 
The part of this work devoted to educational psy- 
chology (§§ 82-102) is believed to possess great interest 
for the thoughtful teacher, as tracing the outlines of the 
only true science of the mind. The phases most worthy 
of the educator's attention are certainly those that relate 
to the development of the intellectual and moral powers; 
it is their development rather than their mere existence 
that the practical teacher wishes to know about. This 
treatise is commended to the notice of those who have 
hitherto been unable to find a satisfactory psychologi- 
. eal basis for their educational theories. ‘They are in- 
vited to ponder what is said about attention (p. 73); how 
the lower faculties grow into higher faculties, and how 
the higher faculties re-enforce the lower (pp. 75, 76); 
the function of the imagination in forming general types 
and in leading to abstract ideas (pp. 84-87). 
The methods of treating the three grades of capacity 
—the blockhead, the mediocre talent, and the genius— 
are especially suggestive to the teacher (p. 109). 
The subject of morality is treated with great care, 
and all will admire what is said on the inadmissibility 
_ of vacations in moral obedience (p. 153), as well as what 
is said (p. 147) on the subject of urbanity (politeness 
with a dash of irony), as the flower of social culture. 
Rosenkranz very properly makes religious education 
the last and highest form of the particular elements of 
education. In no place may one find deeper insights 
in regard to the proper culture in religion in an age 
abounding in unbelief and skeptical influences. His dis- 
tinction of three stages of theoretical culture in religion
-P-A-G-E-8
EDITOR'S PREFACE, ix 
—(a) pious feeling, (6) enjoyment of religious symbols, 
(c) interest in the dogmas as such—to which he adds 
the three practical stages of (a) self-consecration, (6) 
performance of church ceremonies, (c) the attainment 
of a pious trust in the divine government of the world 
—these distinctions are thorough-going. What he says 
(p. 167) on the dangers of unduly hastening the child 
from the stages of religious feeling to religious thought 
and reflection, or, on the other hand, of unduly repress- 
ing religious reflection in those who have begun to ask 
questions and suggest doubts, is very instructive to re- 
ligious teachers, whether in the Sabbath-school or in the 
family. So, too, is the distinction (p. 170) drawn be- 
tween the provinces of morality and religion. 
The entire third part of the work is taken up with 
a history of education, based on the philosophy of his- 
tory. It is rather an outline of the history of human 
culture than a special history of schools or of pedagog- 
ies. As such, it is highly valuable, not only for the 
teacher or parent, but also for all who desire to see in a 
condensed form the essential outcome of human history. 
In this brief survey of the philosophy of history the 
reader will take note, first of all, of the deepest contrast 
—that found between the Oriental and Occidental world- 
principles. The former is that of obedience to exter- 
nal authority, the latter that of independence in all its 
forms. The educator will here find practical hints on 
all points of school management. In China, for in- 
stance, he may see exactly what kind of education will 
make conservative citizens—mere mechanical memoriz- 
ing will do this (p. 197). He may see how too much 
stress on education for one’s vocation may lead to castes
-P-A-G-E-9
x EDITOR'S PREFACE. 
like those of India (p. 200), while abstract, asceticism in 
education may produce something akin to Lamaism. 
The enlightened reader will find it of great interest, 
in these days of the study of Buddhism (“The Light of 
Asia”’—as well as the so-called “Esoteric Buddhism ”), 
to read the distinction between Buddhism and Christi- 
anity (pp. 205 and 256), i.e., the distinction between the 
renunciation of selfishness and the annihilation of self- 
hood itself. 
- The “active” or restless peoples of Western Asia 
are of very great importance in the history of culture— 
mediating as they do between the extremes of the East 
and the West (p. 212). But, above all, we of modern 
times are most eager to study the three kinds of indi- 
viduality which Europe has furnished us (p. 218) in the 
Greek, the Roman, and the Teutonic peoples. For these 
three elements of individuality, dominated by the spir- 
itual idea which we received from Judea—the idea of 
God asa Divine Person—are the elements that enter 
our civilization and compose it. We have to study 
these four strands of our civilization in order to know 
ourselves. What is said about the religious significance 
of the games to the Greeks (p. 220) and the interpreta- 
tion of Nature by the unconscious poetic power of the 
Greek mind (p. 223), as well as the characterization of 
the Roman principle (p. 230), will be recognized as a 
new elaboration of Hegel’s insight given in his “Phi- 
losophy of History ”—a work which alone would give 
its author a rank among the foremost of the great think- 
ers of the world. The Roman idea of genus humanum 
and its relation to the ideal of the Hebrew prophets 
—the Messiah, Prince of Peace, to be worshiped of all

nations—is th}; key to the explanation of the adoption 
of Christianity as a world-religion (p. 249). The spirit 
of modern history is characterized as that which seeks 
to realize the good of all men in each man (p. 251). 
The reader will find a mine of important ideas by fol- 
lowing out the lead of any one of these thoughts. Es- 
pecial mention, however, should be given to the appli- 
cation of the principle of self-estrangement in explain- 
ing the study of the classics (pp. 277, 278), and to the 
remarks on Rousseau (p. 283). 
Omissions.—Occasional references to contemporary 
educational literature, to German customs, and to local 
or temporary interests have been omitted, and the fact 
of omission has been indicated by ...... , or, if it is of 
the slightest importance, by express notice inserted in 
the text. Nearly all that is omitted may be read in the 
first edition of the work.

ence—presupposing and using others—resembling medicine. What 
other sciences it presupposes-—its place in a complete arrangement of

treatises due to the vagueness of the definition of the province of 
education (p. 9). § 8. Business competition in education increases

same department as the ethical sciences. It begins in the family 
(p. 10). § 5. The science of education contains the principles—the 
art of education relates to the devices of applying them, taking into 
consideration the local circumstances (p. 12). § 6. The local cireum- 
stances must not be elevated into general principles (p. 13). § 7. The

“with a sort of irony (p. 147). § 144. The necessity of training one 
to prudent wariness against the dangers that arise from human self- 
ishness in the world (p. 149). 
Cuaprer XIV.—Moral Culture. § 145. Morality is the true es- 
sence of social culture. Its categories are duty, virtue, and conscience 
(p. 150). § 146. Unconditional obedience to duty is the first demand 
of moral education; not happiness, but duty, must be the guide of 
the will (p. 151). § 147, The training of the will to obey duty re- 
sults in virtue; three things to be noticed—dialectie of virtues, moral 
discipline, character (p. 151), § 148. Dialectic interdependence of 
virtues (p. 151); the doctrine of the mean (p. 152); no unessential 
virtues; no vacations to be permitted in moral obedience (p, 153) ; 
missteps undo the whole work (p. 154). § 149. Self-government to 
be atiained by disciplining the will to renounce some things that are 
permitted it (p. 154), § 150. The development of character is the 
final result of discipline of the will in self-control (p. 155); the fac- 
tors that form it are temperament, external events, the energy of the 
will. § 151. Conscience is the consciousness of one’s ideal self (p. 
156) in contrast to the real self, 
Cuarter XV,.— Religious Culture. § 152. Conscience is the 
bridge that leads over from morality to religion; the difference be- 
tween the atheistic moralist and the religious moralist (p. 157); the 
unconscious irony of atheism (p. 158), § 153, The change of heart 
{p. 159). § 154, Three things in religious education—the theory or 
view of the world taught in religion, the discipline in the practice 
of religious observances, the union with a particular church (p.

tion the basis of religion; but, if only a feeling, then only fetichism 
is possible; Schleiermacher’s opinion (p. 161). § 157. Above mere 
emotion is the religious act which forms mental images of the Divine 
Being and his relation to man (p. 162). § 158, Mysticism an ar- 
rested development of the mind on this stage of religious feeling 
(p. 162). § 159. Religious imagination not an idle exercise of the 
fancy, but the fancy under the control of unconscious reason (p. 163). 
§ 160. By reflection on the meaning and significance of the religious 
images, there arises a clear insight into the essential nature of the 
divine (p. 163). § 161. If the mind is arrested in its development at 
this stage of religious imagination, polytheism and idolatry arise; 
education must not for this reason reject the religious imagination 
altogether (p. 164). § 162. Religious thought, as a higher stage than 
religious imagination, has three stages—abstract, reflective, specula~ 
tive (p. 165), § 163. The abstract stage, which sets up dogmas with- 
out.any attempt to show their connection or their necessity in reason, 
is forced to give way before reflection, which, unless guided properly, 
will discover difficulties and become skeptical (p. 167); education 
must take care not to attempt to develop the reflective stage prema- 
turely; it should, however, be careful to direct the inquiries of those 
already advanced to the stage of reflection, so that they may attain 
the speculative insight into the necessity of religious truth. § 164. 
The final stage of religious instruction in doctrinal matters therefore 
endeavors to give philosophical insight (p. 168). 
Cuaptzr XVII—The Practical Process of Religious Culture. 
§ 165. The three phases of religious discipline—consecration of self, 
performance of religious ceremonies, religious reconciliation with 
one’s lot (p. 169). § 166. Distinction between the moral and the re- 
ligious standpoints—the latter looks upon duty as the action of the 
Divine Will, and thus comes into personal relation to God (p. 169); 
distinction of sin, crime, and evil as the categories of religion, civil 
authority, and morality (p. 170). § 167. Consecration of self, the re- 
nunciation of selfish egotism; observance of religious ceremonies is 
intended to make consecration easy, because it gives the support of 
the whole church to each member of it (p. 170); but there is danger 
‘sometimes of confounding ceremonies with religion itself (p. 171). 
§ 168. Religious peace and reconciliation may come through conse- 
eration of self, or through that and the practice of religious cere- 
monial (p. 171); but often it is only the rough discipline of life 
which brings home to the mind the truth of religion (p. 172); recone

Cuaprer II. First Group—the System of Passive Education. 
§ 184. The rational basis of passive education, the desire to free man 
from the thralldom of Nature by mutual social help ; its defect lies in the fact that it produces a new thralldom to social order, which, how- 
ever, is better than the former thralldom to Nature (p. 196). § 185. 
Family education, in its purest form in China (p. 196). § 186. The

obedience; Hegel’s description of the Chinese (p. 198); the Chinese

The Chinese Buddhism and Indian hermit system form a natural 
transition to the cloister system of Thibet (p. 204); the defect of 
quietism ; contrast of Lamaism and Christian monasticism ; nirvana ;

of Buddhist theology (p. 205).

+ THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION, 
INTRODUCTION. 
81. Tux science of education can not be deduoud 
from a simple principle with such strictness as logic, 
ethics, and like sciences. It is rather a mixed science, 
which has its presuppositions in many others. In this 
_ respect it resembles medicine, with which it has this 
. also in common, that it must make a distinction between 
a sound and an unhealthy system of education, and must. 
devise means to prevent or to cure the latter. It may, 
therefore, have, like medicine, the three departments of 
physiology, pathology, and therapeutics. 
[* The science of education is nota complete, independent sei- 
ence by itself. It borrows the results of other sciences, e. g., it 
presupposes psychology, physiology, zsthetics, and the science 
of rights (treating of the institutions of the family and civil 
society, as well as of the state); it presupposes also the science 
of anthropology, in which is treated the relation of the human 
mind to nature, Nature conditions the development of the in- 
dividual human being. But the history of the individual and 
the history of the race present to us a record of continual eman- 
: cipation from nature, and continual growth into freedom, i. e., 
; into ability on the part of man to know himself and to realize 
himself in the world by making the matter and forces of the

world his instruments and tools. Anthropology shows us 
man as a natural being—i. e, as having a body—is lim 
There is climate, involving heat and cold and moisture, 
seasons of the year, etc.; there is organic growth, invol 
birth, growth, reproduction, and decay; there is race, invol 
the limitations of heredity ; there is the telluric life of the pl 
and the circulation of the forces of the solar system, wh 
arise the processes of sleeping, waking, dreaming, and kin. 
phenomena; there is the emotional nature of man, involv 
his feelings, passions, instincts, and desires; then there are 
five senses, and their conditions, Next, there is the science 
phenomenology, treating of the steps by which mind rises fr| 
the stage of mere feeling and sense-perception to that of s 
consciousness, i, ¢., to a recognition of mind as true substa 
and of matter as mere phenomenon created by Mind (G. 
Then follows psychology, including the treatment of the sta, 
of activity of mind, as so-called “ faculties” of the mind, e. 
attention, sense-perception, imagination, conception, understa: 
ing, judgment, reason, and the like. Psychology is genera! 
made (by English writers) to include, also, what is here call 
anthropology and phenomenology. After psychology, there 
the science of ethics, or of morals and customs; then, the scien 
of rights, already mentioned; then, theology, or the science 
religion ; and, after all these, there is philosophy, or the scien 
of science, Now, it is clear that the science of education trea

§ 2. Since education is capable of no such exact 
definitions of its principle and no such logical treat- 
ment as other sciences, the treatises written upon it 
abound more in shallowness than any other literature. 
Short-sightedness and arrogance find in it a most con- 
genial atmosphere, and uncritical methods and declama- 
tory bombast flourish as nowhere else. The literature 
of religious tracts might be considered to rival that of 
the science of education in its superficiality and assur- 
ance, if it did not for the most part seem itself to belong, 
through the fact that it attempts to influence human 
conduct, to the science of education. But teachers as 
persons should be treated in these their weaknesses and 
failures with the utmost consideration, because with 
most of them the endeavor to contribute their mite for 
the improvement of education arises from pure motives,
-P-A-G-E-35
10 THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION. 
and the work of teaching tends to foster the habit o 
administering reproof and giving advice. 
[The scope of the science of education being so broad, and it 
presuppositions so vast, its limits are not well defined, and it 
treatises are very apt to lack logical sequence and conclusion 
and, indeed, frequently to be mere collections of unjustified an: 
unexplained assumptions, dogmatically set forth. Hence th 
low repute of educational literature as a whole.] 
§ 3. The charlatanism of educational liter: 
increased by the fact that schools have becom 
undertakings, and the competition in this bu: 
to encourage the advertising of one’s own merits. 
When “ Boz” in his “ Nicholas Nickleby ” exposed the shockin, 
doings of an English boarding-school, many teachers of such schoo: 
were, as he assures us, so accurately described that they openly com- 
plained he had aimed his caricatures directly at them, 
[Moreover, education furnishes a special vocation, that of 
teaching. (All vocations are specializing—being cut off, as it 
were, from the total life of man, The “ division of labor” re- 
quires that each individual shall concentrate his endeavors on 
his own specialty and be a part of the whole.)] 
§ 4. In the system of the sciences, the s: 
education belongs to the philosophy of spirit 
this, to the department of practical philosc 
problem of which is the comprehension of tk 
of freedom; for education is the conscious inf, 
one will upon another, so as to produce in it a 
ity to an ideal which it sets before it. The id: 
jective spirit, as well as that of art, science, anc. 
forms an essential presupposition for the s: 
education, but does not contain its principle. | 
plete exposition of practical philosophy (ethics: 
ence of education may be distributed under ez: 
several heads. But the point at which the «
-P-A-G-E-36
INTRODUCTION. 1 
education branches off in practical philosophy is the idea 
of the family, inasmuch as here the distinctions of age 
and degrees of maturity are taken account of as arising 
from nature, and the claim of children upon their par- 
ents for education makes itself manifest. All other 
phases of education, in order to succeed, must presup- 
pose a true family life. They may extend and comple- 
ment the school, but can not be its original foundation. 
In this systematic exposition of education, we must not allow 
ourselves to be led into error by those theories which do not recog- 
nize family nurture as an essential educative influence, but demand 
that children shall be removed from their parents at an early age, 
and brought up in institutions provided for infants. The Platonic 
philosophy is the most respectable representative of this class. Mod- 
em writers who testify their great pleasure at seeing the world full 
of children, but who would dispense with the loving care of the fam- 
ily in their education, offer us only a weak and impractical imitation 
of the Platonic “ Republic.” 
[The science of education, as a special science, belongs to the 
collection of sciences (already described, in commenting on § 1) 
included under the philosophy of spiritual being or Mind, and 
more particularly to that part of it which relates to the will (ethics 
and science of rights, rather than to the part relating to the in- 
tellect and feeling, as anthropology, phenomenology, psychology, 
esthetics, and religion. “Subjective spirit” includes anthro- 
pology, phenomenology, and psychology. ‘‘ Theoretical” relates 
to the infellect, “ practical” relates to the will, in this philoso- 
phy). The province of practical philosophy is the investigation 
of the nature of freedom, and the process of securing it by self- 
emancipation from nature. The science of education presup- 
poses the conscious exertion of influence on the part of the will 
of the teacher upon the will of the pupil, with a purpose in view 
—that of inducing the pupil to form certain prescribed habits, 
and adopt prescribed views and habits. According to this defi- 
nition, the unconscious influences which are so powerful in 
forming human character are not included under the term 
“education” (Erziehung) as here used. The entire science of

   man (as above shown) is presupposed by the science of educ: 
tion, and inust be kept constantly in view as a guiding ligh’ 
The institution of the family (treated in practical philosophy! 
is the starting-point of education, and, without this institutioy 
properly realized, education would find no solid foundation, 
The right to be educated on the part of children and the dut: 
to edueate on the part of parents are reciprocal; and there is 
no family life so poor and rudimentary that it does not furnish 
the most important elements of education—no matter what the 
subsequent influence of the school, the vocation, and the state.] 
§ 5. Much confusion also arises from the fact that 
many do not clearly enough draw the distinction be. 
tween education as a science and education as an art. 
As a science, it busies itself with developing a prioré 
the idea of education in the universality and necessity 
of that idea, but as an art it is the concrete special re- 
‘alization of this abstract idea in any given case. And, 
in any such given case, the peculiarities of the person 
who is to be educated and, in fact, all the existing cir- 
cumstances necessitate an adaptation of the universal 
aims and ends, that can not be provided for beforehand, 
but must rather test the ready tact of the educator who 
knows how to take advantage of the existing conditions 
to fulfill his desired end. Just here it is that the edu- 
cator may show himself inventive and creative, and that 
pedagogic talent can distinguish itself. The word “art ” 
is here used in the same way as it is used when we say, 
the art of war, the art of government, ete. ; and rightly, 
for we are talking about the possibility of the realization 
of the idea or theory. 
The educator must adapt himself to the pupil, but not to such a 
degree as to imply that the pupil is ineapable of change; on the con- 
trary, he must be sure that the pupil shali learn through his ex- 
perience the independence of the object studied, which remains un

INTRODUCTION. 13 
influenced by his variable personal moods, and the adaptation cn the 
teacher’s part must never compromise this independence. 
[The science of education distinguished trom the art of educa- 
tion: the former containing the abstract general treatment, and 
the latter taking into consideration all the conditions of con- 
crete individuality, e. g., the peculiarities of the teacher and the 
pupil, all the local circumstances, and the power of adaptation 
known as “tact.”] | 
§ 6. If conditions which are local, temporal, and in- 
dividual, are fixed as constant rules, and carried beyond 
their proper limits, unavoidable error arises. The for- 
mule of teaching are admirable material upon which to 
apply the science, but are not the science itself. 
[The special conditions and peculiarities considered in educa- 
tion as an art may be formulated and reduced to system, but 
they should not be introduced as a part of the science of edu- 
cation.] 
§% The science of education must (1) unfold the 
general idea of education ; (2) must exhibit the particu- 
lar phases into which the general work of education is 
divided ; and (8) must describe the particular standpoint 
upon which the general idea realizes or will realize it- 
self in its special processes at any particular time. 
[The science c* education has three parts: First, it considers 
the idea and nature of education, and arrives at its true defini- 
tion; second, it presents and describes the special provinces into 
which the entire field of education is divided ; third, it considers 
the historical evolution of education by the human race, and the 
individual systems of education that have arisen, flourished, and 
decayed, and their special functions in the life of man.] 
§ 8. The treatment of the first part is logically too 
evident to offer any difficulty. It would not do to sub- 
stitute for it the history of education, because’ history 
uses and hence presupposes all the ideas that are treated 
of in the general and particular divisions of the system.
-P-A-G-E-39
4 THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION. 
(Reference to G., Thaulow’s pamphlet on “Pedagogics as 
Philosophical Science.” Berlin, 1845.) 
[The scope of the first part is easy to define. The history o: 
education, of course, contains all the ideas and definitions of th 
nature of education; but it must not for that reason be substt- 
tuted for the scientific investigation of the nature of education, 
which alone should constitute this first part (and the history of 
education be reserved for the third part).] 
§ 9. The second division unfolds the subj 
physical, intellectual, and practical culture of 
race, and constitutes the main part of all bor 
science of education. Here arises the greates 
as to the limitations, partly in relation to the 
explanation to be given to the ideas that are 
from other sciences, partly in relation to the 
amplification allowed to the details. Here i

ferent species which may arise, it is evide: 
can extend his treatise indefinitely ; he may, 
ple, go into the consideration of technological 
all kinds, for mining, navigation, war, art, ete. 
[The second part includes a discussion of the threefold nature 
of man as body, intellect, and will. The difficulty in this part 
of the science is very great, because of its dependence upon 
other sciences (e. g., upon physiology, anthropology, etc.), and 
because of the temptation to go into details (e.g.,in the prac- 
tical department, to consider the endless varieties of schools for 
arts and trades).] 
§ 10. The third division distinguishes bei 
different standpoints which are possible in th: 
out of the conception of education in its s; 
ments, and which therefore produce different systems o1 
education wherein the general and the particular are
-P-A-G-E-40
INTRODUCTION. 18 
united or realized in different ways. In every system 
(historically realized) the general principles that belong 
to the idea of education (treated under the first division), 
and the different phases of physical, intellectual, and 
practical culture of man (treated under the second di 
vision), must be found. But the mode of treatment is 
decided by the historical standpoint which gives reality 
in a special form to the system of education. Thus it 
becomes possible to discover the essential contents of 
the history of education from its idea, since this can fur- 
nish only a limited number of systems. 
The lower standpoint always merges into the higher, and in so 
doing first attains its full meaning, e. g.: Education for the sake of 
the nation is set aside for higher standpoints, e. g., that of Christi- 
anity ; but we must not suppose that the “national phase” of edu- 
cation was counted as naught from the Christian standpoint, but 
rather that now, being assigned its proper limits, it can unfold its 
true idea, This is seen to be the case in the fact that the national 
individualities become indestructible by being incorporated into 
Christianity—a fact that condemns the abstract seizing of such re- 
lations. 
[The third part contains the exposition of the various nation- 
al standpoints furnished (in the history of the world) for the 
bases of particular systems of education. In each of these sys- 
tems w:?! be found the general idea underlying all education, 
but it will be found existing under special modifications which 
have arisen through its application to the physical, intellectual, 
and ethical conditions of the people. But we can deduce the 
essential features of the different systems that may appear in 
history, for there are only a limited number of systems possible. 
Each lower form finds itself complemented in some higher form, 
and its function and purpose then become manifest. The sys- 
tems of “national” education (ic. Asiatic systems, in which 
the individuality of each person is swallowed up in the substan- 
tility of the national idea—just as the individual waves get 
Jost in the ocean on whose surface they arise) find their com- 
plete explanation in the systems of education that arise in Chris

tianity (the preservation of human life being the object of the 
nation, it follows that, when realized abstractly or exclusively, 
it absorbs and annuls the mental independence of its subjects. 
and thus contradicts itself by destroying the essence of what it 
undertakes to preserve, i. e., human life, which demands freedom 
and enlightenment; but within Christianity the principle of the 
state is found so modified that it is consistent with the infinite, 
untrammeled development of the individual, intellectually and 
morally, and thus not only life is saved, but spiritual, free life 
is attainable for each and for all).]

[The nature of education, its form, its limits, are now to be

CHAPTER I. 
THE NATURE OF EDUCATION. 
$13. Tux nature of education is determined by the 
nature of mind—that it can develop what it is in itself 
only by its own activity. Mind is in itself free; but, if 
it does not actualize this possibility, it is in no true sense 
free, either for itself or for another. Education is the 
influencing of man by man, and it has for its end to lead 
him to actualize himself through his own efforts, The 
attainment of perfect manhood as the actualization of 
the freedom essential to mind constitutes the nature of 
education in general,

race in each individual). Hence, education has freedom for it

§ 14. Man, therefore, is the only fit subject for edu

one tries to teach mechanically, not through the almighty power of 
the creative Logos, but through the powerless and fruitless appeal te 
physical pain,
-P-A-G-E-46
THE NATURE OF EDUCATION. Qt 
[Man is the only being capable of education, in the sense 
above defined, because the only conscious being. He must know 
himself ideally, and then realize his ideal self, in order to become 
actually free, The animals and plants may be trained, or eulti- 
vated, but, as devoid of self-consciousness (even the highest ani- 
mals not getting above impressions, not reaching ideas, not 
seizing general or abstract thoughts), they are not realized for 
themselves, but only for us. (That is, they do not know their 
ideal as we do.)] 
§ 15. The idea of education may be more or less 
comprehensive. We use it in the widest sense when 
we speak of the education of the race, for we under- 
stand by this expression the connection which the situa- 
tions and undertakings of different nations have to each 
other, as steps toward self-conscious freedom. In this 
the world-spirit is the teacher. 
[Education, taken in its widest compass, is the education of 
the human race by Divine Providence. Here education (Br- 
ziehung) is recognized to include much more than the “con- 
scious” exertion of influence as defined in § 4.] 
§ 16. In a more restricted sense we mean by educa- 
tion the shaping of the individual life by the laws of. 
-nature, the rhythm of national customs, and the might of 
destiny ; since, in these, each one finds limits set to his 
arbitrary will. These mold him into a man often with- 
out his knowledge. For be can not act in opposition to 
nature, nor offend the ethical sense of the people among 
whom he dwells, nor despise the leading of destiny with- 
out discovering through experience that upon the Neme- 
sis of these substantial elements his subjective power can 
dash itself only to be shattered. If he perversely and 
persistently rejects all our admonitions, we leave him, 
as a last resort, to destiny, whose iron rule must educate 
him, and reveal to him the God whom he has ignored. 4 :

22 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION, 
It is, of course, sometimes not only possible, but necessary 
one, moved by the highest sense of morality, to act in opposition 
the laws of nature, to offend the ethical sense of the people that s 
round him, and to brave the blows of destiny; we are not, howev 
now speaking of a sublime reformer or martyr, but of the perve: 
the frivolous, and the conceited. 
[in a narrow sense, education is applied to the shaping 
the individual by his environment, so that his caprice a: 
arbitrariness shall give place to rational habits and views, ij 
harmony with nature and ethical customs. He must not abu: 
nature, nor slight the ethical code of his people, nor despise t. 
gifts of Providence (whether for weal or woe), unless he is wi 
ing to be crushed in the collision with these more substanti 
elements]

usual one, we mean by education the inf

teacher must, therefore, be relatively fi 
own education, and the pupil must pos: 
confidence in him. If authority be wantii 
side, or respect and obedience on the othe | 
basis of development will be lacking, and 
replaced by talent, knowledge, skill, or pruucucc. 
  Education takes on this form only under the culture which ha: 
been developed through the influence of town life. Up to th 
we have the naive period of education, which is limited to t] 
eral powers of nature, of national customs, and of destiny, anc 
lasts for a long time among the rural populations. But in° 
a greater complication of the environment owing to the unc 
of the results of reflection (one’s environment being chiefly human 
and given to reflection, and not so simple as the rural environment 
of plants and animals), the specializing of individuality, through the 
need of the possession of many arts and trades (and consequeut 
division of labor), these render it impossible for men longer te be

ruled by mere custom. The Telemachus of Fénelon was educated 
to rule himself by means of reflection; the actual Telemachus in the 
beroic age lived simply according to custom. 
[In the narrowest but most usual application of the term, we 
understand by “education ” the influence of the individual upon 
the individual, exerted with the object of developing his powers 
in a conscious and methodical manner, either generally or in 
special directions, the educator being relatively mature, and ex- 
ercising authority over the relatively immature pupil. Without 
authority on the one hand and obedience on the other, educa- 
tion would lack its ethical basis—a neglect of the will-training 
could not be compensated for by any amount of knowledge or 
smartness. ] 
§ 18. The general problem of education is the de- 
velopment of the theoretical and practical reason in the 
individual. If we say that to educate one means to 
fashion him into morality, we do not make our defini- 
tion sufficiently comprehensive, because we say nothing 
of intelligence, and thus confound education and ethics. 
A man is not merely a human being in general, but, as 
a rational, conscious subject, he is a peculiar individual, 
and different from all others of the race. 
[The general province of education includes the development 
of the individual into the theoretical and practical reason im- 
manent in him, The definition which limits education to the 
development of the individual into ethical customs (obedience 
to morality, social conventionalities, and the laws of the state— 
Hegel's definition is here referred to: “The object of education 
is to make men ethical ”) is not comprehensive enough, because 
it.ignores the side of the éntellect, and takes note only of the 
will, The individual should not only be man in general (as he 
is through the adoption of moral and ethical forms—which are 
generat forms, customs, or laws, and thus the forms imposed by 
the will of the race), but he should also be a self-conscious sub- 
ject, a particular individual (man, through his intellect, exists 
for himself as an individual, while through his general habits 
and customs he loses his individuality and spontaneity).]
-P-A-G-E-49
4 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION, 
§ 19. Education must lead the pupil, by a conne: 
series of efforts previously foreseen and arranged tk 
teacher, to a definite end; but the particular form 1 
this shall take must be determined by the individua. 
of the pupil and the other conditions. Intermittent 
fort, sudden and violent influences, may accomplish m 
but only systematic work can advance and fashio™ 1? 
in conformity with his nature ; and, if this is lack 
does not belong to education, for this includes in. 
the idea of an end, and that of the technical meaus 
its attainment. 
[Education has a definite object in view, and it proceeds 
grades of progress toward it. The systematic tendency is es: 
tial to all education, properly so called.] 
§ 20. But as culture comes to mean more and. mo 
‘there becomes necessary a division of la” 7 
on account of technical qualifications an : 
mation demanded, because as the arts a 
continually increasing in number one can : 
in any one branch only by devoting him | 
to it, and hence becoming a specialist / 
hence arises, which is also one for the 
serving, in spite of this unavoidable : 
the unity and wholeness which are nurroomy us 4 
manity. 
The naive dignity of the happy savage and the good-natu. 
simplicity of country people appear to very great advantage .w} 
contrasted with the narrowness of a special trade, and the end] 
curtailing of the wholeness of man by the pruning processes of ¢ 
life. Thus the often-abused savage has his hut, his family, his coc 
tree, his weapons, his passions ; he fishes, hunts, plays, fights, ado. 
himself, and enjoys the consciousness that he is the center o: ; 
while a modern citizen is often reduced by culture to a mere | 
humanity.    
    
-P-A-G-E-50
THE NATURE OF EDUCATION. Od 
[Division of labor has become requisite in the higher spheres 
of teaching. The growing multiplicity of branches of knowl- 
edge creates the necessity for the specialist as teacher. With 
this tendency to specialties it becomes more and more difficult 
to preserve what is so essential to the pupil—his rounded human 
culture and symmetry of development. The citizen of modern 
civilization sometimes appears to be an artificial produet by the 
_ side of the versatility of the savage man.] 
§ 21. As it becomes necessary to divide the work of 
instruction, a difference between general and special 
schools arises, also, from the needs of growing culture. 
The former give to the pupil with various degrees of 
completeness all’ the sciences and arts reckoned as be- 
longing to “general education,” and which ‘were in- 
cluded by the Greeks under the general name of Ency- 
clopedia. The latter are known as special schools, 
suited to particular needs or talents. 
The isolation of country life renders it often necessary, or at least 
desirable, that one man should develop culture symmetrically in very 
different directions, The poor tutor is required not only to instruct 
in all the sciences, he must also speak French, and be able to play the 
piano. 
[From this necessity of the division of labor in modern times 
there arises the demand for two kinds of educational institu- 
tions—those devoted to general education (common schools, col- 
leges, ete.), and special schools (for agriculture, medicine, me- 
chanic arts, ete.)]. 
§ 22. For any person, his actual education compared 
with its infinite possibilities remains only an approxima- 
tion, and it can be considered as only relatively finished 
in particular directions. Education is impossible to him 
who is born an idiot, since the want of the power of 
generalizing and of ideality of conscious personality 
leaves to such an unfortunate only the possibility of a 
mechanical training.
-P-A-G-E-51
26 TEE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
Sugert, the teacher of the deaf-mutes in Berlin, has made laud: 
ble efforts to educate idiots, but the account, as given in his public: 
tion, “ Cure of Idiots by an Intellectual Method,” Berlin, 1846, show 
that the results obtained were only external; and, though we do no} 
desire to be understood as denying to this class the possession of 
mind én potentia, it appears in them to be confined by disease to a: 
embryonic state. 
{The infinite possibility of culture for the individual leaves, o 
course, his actual accomplishment a mere approximatic 
complete education. Born idiots are excluded from thi 
bility of education, because the lack of universal ideas i. 2... 
consciousness precludes to that class of unfortunates anything 
beyond a mere mechanical training.] 
CHAPTER II. 
THE FORM OF EDUCATION. 
§ 23. Tur general form of education is determined 
by the nature of the mind: mind has reality only in 80 
far as it produces it for itself. The mind is (1) immediate 
(or potential ; but (2) it must estrange itself from itself, 
as it were, so that it may place itself over against itself 
as a special object of attention; (8) this estrangement is 
finally removed through a further acquaintance with the 
object—it feels itself at home in that on which it looks, 
and returns again enriched to the form of immediate 
ness (to unity with itself). That which at first appeared 
to be another than itself is now seen to be itself. 
Education can not create ; it can only help to develop to reality 
what was already a possibility; it can only help to bring forth te 
light the hidden life.
-P-A-G-E-52
EN THE FORM OF EDUCATION. QT 
[Spirit, or mind, makes its own nature; it 7s what it produces 
a self-result, That is to say; it produces its ideas through 
self-activity, and only in proportion to its stock of ideas—their 
number and importance—can mind be said to be realized. Ideas 
form. its “nature,” and they are made by the self-activity of 
mind. From this follows the form of education. It commences 
with (1) undeveloped mind—that of the infant—wherein nearly 
all is potential, and but little is actualized ; (2) its first stage of 
development is self-estrangement—it is absorbed in the observa- 
tion of objects around it; (8) but it discovers laws and principles 
(universality) in external nature, and finally identifies them with 
reason—it comes to recognize itself in nature—to recognize con- 
scious mind as the creator and preserver of the external world 
~and thus spirit becomes-at home in nature. Education does 
not create, but. it emancipates. It does not make self-activity, 
but it influences it to develop itself. “Self-estrangement” as 
here used is perhaps the most important idea in the philosophy 
of education, Rosenkranz and others have borrowed it from 
Hegel, who first used it in his “ Phenomenology of Spirit ” (p. 
353) in explaining the revolutionary reaction against established 
authority and traditional faith as it had been manifested in the 
French Revolution. The explanation of the effect of the study 
of classics, pure mathematics, the effect of foreign travel, of the 
isolated life of students at universities, of wearing special garbs 
that distinguish one’s order from the rest of the community, in 
short, of any study of strange and far-off phases of the world— 
the explanation is to be found in the principle of self-estrange- 
ment, and its annulment by changing what was foreign into 
what is familiar.] 
§ 24. All enlture, whatever may be its special pur- 
port, must pass through these two stages—of estrange- 
ment, and its removal. Culture must intensify the dis- 
tinction between the subject and the object, or that of 
immediateness, though it has again to absorb this dis- 
tinetion into itself; in this way the union of the two 
may be more complete and lasting. The subject recog- 
nizes, then, all the more certainly that what at first ap-
-P-A-G-E-53
28 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
peared to it as a foreign existence belongs to i poten- 
tially as its own possession, and that it comes inte actual 
possession of it by means of culture. 
Plato, as is known, calls the feeling with which knowledge must 
begin, wonder; but this can serve asa beginning only, for wonder 
itself can only express the tension between the subject and the object 
apon their first, presentation to each other—a tension which would 
be impossible if they were not in themselves identical. Children 
have a longing for the far-off, the strange, and the wonderful, as if 
they hoped to find in these an explanation of themselves. They want 
the object to be a genuine object. That to which they are accus- 
tomed, which they see around them every day, seems to have no 
longer any objective energy for them; but an alarm of fire, banditti 
life, wild animals, gray old ruins, Robinsons’ adventures on far- 
off happy islands, ete.—everything high colored and glaring—leads 
them irresistibly on. The necessity of the mind’s making itself for- 
eign to itself is that which makes children prefer to hear of the ad- 
venturous journeys of Sindbad rather than news of their own city 
or the history of their nation. On the part of youth this same 
necessity manifests itself in their desire of traveling. 
[This process of self-estrangement and its removal belongs to 
all culture. The mind must fix its attention upon what is for- 
eign to it, and penetrate its disguise. It will discover its own 
substance under the seeming alien being. That is to say, it will 
discover the rational laws that underlie the strange and foreign 
being, and thereby come to recognize reason or itself. Wonder 
is the accompaniment of this stage of estrangement. The love 
of travel and adventure arises from this basis. Culture endeav- 
ors first to develop the contrast of the strange to the familiar, 
but it does this in order to annul it and make the alien into the 
well-known. Thus it enlarges the individual by making him 
more inclusive, by making him contain his environment.} 
§ 25. This activity of the mind in concentrating it- 
self consciously upon an object with the purpose of 
making it one’s own, or of producing it, is work. But 
when the mind gives itself up to its objects as chance 
may present them, or through arbitrariness, careless as
-P-A-G-E-54
THE FORM OF EDUCATION. 29 
to whether they have any result, such activity is play. 
Work is laid out for the pupil by his teacher authori- 
tatively, but in his play he is left to himself. 
{Labor is distinguished from play: The former concentrates 
its energies on some object, with the purpose of making it con- 
form to its will and purpose; play occupies itself with its object 
according to its caprice and arbitrariness, and has no care for 
the results or products of its activity; work is prescribed by 
authority, while play is necessarily spontaneous. ] 
§ 26. Thus work and play must be sharply distin- 
guished from each other. If one does not insist on re- 
” spect for work as an important and substantial activity, 
he not only spoils play for his pupil (for this loses all its 
attraction when deprived of the antithesis of an earnest, 
set task), but he undermines his respect for real exist- 
ence, On the other hand, if he does not give him space, 
time, and opportunity, for play, he prevents the pecul- 
jarities of his pupil from developing freely through the 
exercise of his creative ingenuity. Play sends the pupil 
back refreshed to his work, since in play he forgets 
himself in his own way, while in work he is required 
to forget himself in a manner prescribed for him by 
another. 
Play is of great importance in helping one to discover the true 
individualities of children, because in play they may betray thought- 
lessly their inclinations. The antithesis of work and play runs 
through the entire life. Children anticipate in their play the earnest 
work of after-life; thus the little girl plays with her doll, and the 
boy pretends he is a soldier and in battle. 
[Work and play: the distinction between them. In play the 
child feels that he has entire control over the object with which 
he is dealing, both in respect to its existence and the object for 
which it exists. His arbitrary will may change both with per- 
fect impunity, since all depends upon his caprice ; he exercises 
his powers in play according to his natural proclivities, and
-P-A-G-E-55
380 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
therein finds scope to develop his own individuality. In w 
on the contrary, he must have respect for the object with w: 
he deals. 1t must be held sacred against his caprice, must 
be destroyed nor injured in any way, and its purpose must li 
wise be respected. His own personal inclinations must be entir 
subordinated, and the business that he is at work upon must 
carried forward in accordance with its own ends and aims, a 
without reference to his own feelings in the matter. Thus w 
teaches the pupil the lesson of self-sacrifice (the right of supe 
ority which the general interest possesses over the particul. 
while play develops his personal idiosynerasy.] 
_ § 27. Work should never be treated as if i‘ 
play, nor play as if it were work. In general, th 
tice of the arts and the study of the sciences st 
this relation to each other: the accumulation of 
of knowledge is the recreation of the mind which 1s er 
gaged in independent creation, and the practice of art 
fills the same office to those whose work is to collec 
knowledge. 
{Without play, the child would become more and more a mez 
chine, and lose all freshness and spontaneity—all originality 
Without work, he would develop into a monster of caprice an 
arbitrariness. From the fact that man must learn to combin 
with man, in order that the individual may avail himself of th 
experience and labors of his fellow-men, self-sacrifice for th 
sake of combination is the great lesson of life. But as thi 
should be voluntary self-sacrifice, education must train th 
child equally in the two directions of spontaneity and obedi 
ence. The educated man finds recreation in chang’

ditions formally all progress; for that which is not 
yet become habit, but which we perform with design 
and an exercise of our will, is not yet a part of our- 
selves, 
[Education seeks to assimilate its object—to make what was 
alien and strange to the pupil into something familiar and 
habitual to him. The pupil is to attack, one after the other, 
the foreign realms in the world of nature and man, and con- 
quer them for his own, so that he can be “at home” in them. 
It is the necessary condition of all growth, all culture, that one 
widens his own individuality by this conquest of new provinces 
alien to him. By this the individual transcends the narrow 
limits of particularity and becomes generic—the individual be- 
comes the species. A good definition of education is this: It is 
the process by which the individual man elevates himself to the 
species.} 
§ 29. (1) Habit may be, in the first place, indiffer- 
ent as to the subject-matter to which it relates. But 
that which is to be considered as indifferent or neutral 
can not be defined in the abstract, but only in the con- 
crete, because anything that is indifferent as to whether 
it shall act on this particular man, or in this special situ- 
ation, is capable of another or even of the opposite 
meaning for another man or even for the same man in 
other cireumstances. Here, then, appeal must be made 
to the individual conscience in order to be able from 
the depths of individuality to decide what we can per- 
mit to ourselves and what we must deny ourselves. 
The aim of education must be to arouse in the pupil 
this spiritual and ethical sensitiveness which does not 
look upon anything as merely indifferent, but rather 
knows how to seize in everything, even in the seem- 
ingly unimportant, its universal human significance. 
But, in relation to the highest interests, he must learn
-P-A-G-E-57
82 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
that what concerns his own imm: 
is entirely indifferent, and must b: 
them. 
[Therefore, the first requirement in education is that t 
pupil shall acquire the habit of subordinating his likes and di: 
likes to the attainment of a rational object. It is necessary th: 
he shall acquire this indifference to his own pleasure, even b| 
employing his powers on that which does not appeal to his i 
terest in the remotest degree. Habit is “formal,” i.e., it is a 
empty form that will fit any sort of activity or passivity. Habi 
can make anything a second nature.} 
§ 80. The indifference of habit to it 
disappears when external consideration 
or hurtfulness (advantage or disadvant 
view. Whatever tends as a means to the reauzauun v. 
an end is useful, but that is hurtful which, by contra 
dicting it, hinders or destroys it. Usefulness and hurt 
fulness being then only relative terms, a habit which i: 
useful for one man in one case may be hi “*~ * 
another man, or even for the same man, unde: 
circumstances. Education must, therefore, accusvuu ue 
youth to judge as to the expediency or inexpe ~ 
any action by its relation to the essential vocat 
life, so that he shall avoid that which does not 
its success. 
[Habit soon makes us familiar with subjects which seem re. 
mote from our personal interest, and they become agreeable tc 
as. The objects, too, assume a new interest upon nearer ap: 
proach, as being useful or injurious to us. That is useful whick 
serves us as a means for the realization of a rational purpose 
injurious, if it hinders such realization. It happens that object: 
are useful in one respect and injurious in another, and vice versa 
Education must make the pupil capable of deciding on the use- 
fulness of an object by reference to its effect on his permanent 
vocation in life.
-P-A-G-E-58
THE FORM OF EDUCATION, 33 
§ 31. But the absolute distinction for the subject- 
matter of habit is the moral distinction between the 
good and the bad. For from this standpoint alone can 
we finally decide what is allowable and what is forbid- 
den, what is useful and what is hurtful. 
[But good and evil are the ethical distinctions which furnish 
the absolute standard to which to refer the question of the use- 
fulness of objects and actions.] 
§ 32. (2) As relates to form (in contradistinction to 
subject-matter), habit may be either passive or active. 
The passive is that which teaches us to bear the vicissi- 
tudes of nature as well as of life with such composure 
that we shall hold our ground against them, being al- 
ways equal to ourselves, and that we shall not allow our 
power of acting to be paralyzed through any mutations 
of fortune. Passive habit is not to be confounded with 
obtuseness in receiving impressions, a blank abstraction 
from the affair in hand, which at bottom is nothing - 
more than a selfishness which desires to be left undis- 
turbed; it is simply composure of mind in view of 
changes over which we have no control. While we 
vividly experience joy and sorrow, pain and pleasure— 
inwoven as these are with the change of seasons, of the 
weather, or with the alternation of life and death, of hap- 
piness and misery—we ought nevertheless to harden our- 
selves against them, so that at the same time, in our con- 
sciousness of the supreme worth of the soul, we shall build 
up the inaccessible stronghold of freedom in ourselves. 
Active habit (or behavior) is found realized in a wide range of 
activity which appears in manifold forms, such as skill, dexterity, 
readiness of information, ete; It is a steeling of the internal for ac-. 
tion upon the external, as the passive is a steeling of the internal- 
against the influences of the external,

34 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
     
       
    
       [Habit is (a) passive or (b) active. The passive habit is t| 
which gives us the power to retain our equipoise of mind| 
the midst of a world of changes (pleasure aud pain, grief 
joy, etc.). The active habit gives us skill, presence of mii 
tact in emergencies, ete.] 
§ 33. (8) Habit (i. e., fixed principles of behavi 
active and passive) is the general form which culture (| 
the outcome of education) takes. For, since it reduc| 
a condition or an activity within ourselves to an inst 
ive use and wont (to a second nature), it is necessary: 
any thorough education. But as, according to its conte: 
(or subject-matter to which it relates), it may be eith 
proper or improper (§ 29), advantageous or disadv. 
tageous (§ 30), good or bad (§ 31), and according to i 
form may be the assimilation of the external by the i 
ternal, or the impress of the internal wpon the externa 
(§ 82), education must procure for the pupil the powe 
of being able to free himself from one habit a1 | 
adopt another. Through his freedom he must be | 
not only to renounce any habit formed, but to form : 
new one; and he must so govern his sys: | 
that it shall exhibit a constant progress of 
into greater freedom. We must discipime ourseive: 
constantly to form and to break habits, as a means to 
ward the ever-developing realization of the good in us. 
We must characterize those habits as corrupting which relat. 
only to our convenience or our enjoyment, They are often noi 
blamable in themselves, but there lies in them a hidden danger tha‘ 
they may allure us into luxury or effeminacy. It is a false and me. 
chanical way of looking at the mind to suppose that a habit 
has been formed by a certain number of repetitions can be brol 
an equal number of denials. We can never renounce a habit, 
we decide to be pernicious, except through clearness of judgiweni 
and firmness of will

(Edueation deals altogether with the formation of habits. 
For it aims to make some condition or form of activity into a 
second nature for the pupil. But this involves, also, the break- 
ing up of previous habits. This power to break up habits, ag 
well as to form them, is necessary to the freedom of the indi- 
vidual.] 
§ 34. Education comprehends, therefore, the recip- 
rocal action of the opposites: authority and obedience ; 
rationality and individuality ; work and play; habit and 
spontaneity. If these are reconciled in a normal man- 
ner, the youth is now free from the tension of these 
opposites. But a failure in education in this particular is 
very possible through the freedom of the pupil, through 
special circumstances, or through the errors of the edu- 
cator himself. And for this very reason any theory of 
education must take into account in the beginning this 
negative possibility. It must consider beforehand the 
dangers which threaten the pupil, in all possible ways 
even before they surround him, and fortify him against 
them. Intentionally to expose him to temptation in 
order to prove his strength, is devilish; and, on the 
other hand, to guard him against the possible chance of 
dangerous temptation, to wrap him in cotton (as the 
proverb says), is womanish, ridiculous, fruitless, and 
much more dangerous; for temptation comes not alone 
from without, but quite as often from within, aud secret 
> inclination seeks and creates for itself the opportunity 
for its gratification, often perhaps an unnatural one. 
The truly preventive activity consists not in an abstract 
seclusion from the world, all of whose elements are in- 
nate in each individual, but in the activity of instruc- 
tion and discipline, modified according to age and 
culture.
-P-A-G-E-61
36 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
The method that aims to deprive the youth of all free and in 
vidual intercourse with the world only leads to continual espiona; 
and the consciousness that he is watched destroys in him all elasticii 
of spirit, all confidence, ali originality. The police shadow of co 
trol undermines all self-reliance, and systematically accustoms bi 
to dependence. The tragi-comic story of Peter Schlemihl * show: 
it is true, that one can not lose his own shadow without falling int 
the saddest fatalities; but the shadow of a constant companion, a 
in the pedagogical system of the Jesuits, undermines all na 
and ease of mind. And if one endeavors too strictly to guar 
that which is ill-mannered and forbidden, the intelligen: 
pupils reacts in deceit against such efforts, till the educ..w-. u. 
amazed that such crimes as often come to light can have arisen unde: 
such careful control.

ses): (a) authority and obedience ; (| 
and individuality ; (c) work and pla. 
and spontaneity. The development

object to be kept in view, but a too early use of freedom may 
work injury to the pupil. To remove a pupil fror 
tion would be to remove possibilities of growth in 
resist it ; on the other hand, to expose him needle:

ness, or oddity, may arise from some real needs of the 
youth which in their development have only taken a 
wrong direction. 
[Deformities of character in the pupil should be carefully 
traced back to their origin, so that they may be explained by 
their history, Only by comprehending the historie growth 
of an organic defect are we able to prescribe the best reme- 
dies, Such deformities are often mere symptoms of deeper 
evils.} 
§ 36. If it should appear on such examination that 
the negative action was only a product of willful igno- 
rance, of caprice, or of arbitrariness on the part of the 
youth, then this calls for a simple prohibition on the 
part of the educator, no reason being assigned. His 
mere authority must be sufficient to the pupil in such a 
case. Only when this has happened more than once, 
and the youth is old enough to understand, should the 
prohibition be accompanied with a brief statement of 
the reason therefor. 
This should be brief, because the explanation must retain its 
disciplinary character, and must not become extended into a doc- 
trinal essay, for in such a case the youth easily forgets that it was 
his own misbehavior which was the occasion of the explanation. The 
statement of the reason must be honest, and it must present to the 
youth the point most easy for him to seize. False reasons are morally 
blamable in themselves, and they tend only to confuse. It is a great 
mistake to unfold to the youth the broadening consequences which 
his act may bring. These possibilities seem to him too uncertain to 
affect him much. The severe lecture wearies him, especially if it be 
stereotyped, as is apt to be the case with fault-finding and talkative 
instructors. But more unfortunate is it if the painting of the gloomy 
background to which the consequences of the wrong-doing of the 
youth may lead, should fil) his feelings and imagination prematurely 
with gloomy fancies, because then the representation has led him one 
step toward a state of wretchedness which in the future man may 
become fearful depression and degradation.

{If the negative behavior of the pupil (his bad behavior) 
sults from ignorance due to his own neglect, or to his will 
ness, it should be met directly by an act of authority on the 
of the teacher (and without an appeal to reason). An -ap; 
should be made to the understanding of the pupil only when 
is somewhat mature, or shows by his repetition of the offense t 
his proclivity is deep-seated, and requires an array of all g& 
influences to re-enforce his feeble resolutions to amend.] 
§ 37. If the censure is accompanied with a thr 
of punishment, then we have the kind of re: 
in daily life we call “scolding”; but, if : 
is given, the pupil must be made to feel tuac 1 1s 
earnest.

but is even rendered necessary on account of the 
try that is inherent in human nature, which assigus to 
a deed many motives (and takes refuge against blame 
by alleging good motives).
-P-A-G-E-64
EE THE FORM OF EDUCATION. 39 
[After the failure of other means, punishment should be re- 
sorted to. Inasmuch as the punishment should be for the pur- 
pose of making the pupil realize that it is the consequence of 
his deed returning on himself, it should always be administered 
for some particular act of his, and this should be specified. The 
“overt act ” is the only thing which a man can be held account~ 
able for in a court of justice; although it is true that the har- 
boring of evil thoughts or intentions is a sin, yet it is not a 
crime until realized in an overt act. It is a mistake to punish 
for “general naughtiness,” or for evil intent, or for the “ subject- 
ive totality” as Rosenkranz calls it. Any particular deed is one 
of a thousand possible deeds—the intention or disposition con- 
tains the totality of all these possible deeds, but they belong to 
the pupil as his exclusive property for which he is not respon- 
sible to his fellow human beings until he by an act of the will 
makes one of the possible deeds actual.] 
§ 89. Punishment as an educational means is never- 
theless essentially corrective, since, by leading the youth 
to a proper estimation of his fault and a positive change 
in his behavior, it seeks to improve him. At the same 
time, it stands as a sad indication of the insufficiency of 
the means previously used. The youth should not be 
frightened from the commission of a misdemeanor or 
from the repetition of his negative deed through fear 
of punishment—a system which leads always to terror- 
ism; but, although this effect may be incidental, the 
punishment should, before all things, impress upon him 
the recognition of the fact that the negative is not al- 
lowed to prevail without limitation, but rather that the 
good and the true have the absolute power in this world, 
and that they are never without the means of overcom. 
ing anything that contradicts them. 
In the statute-laws, punishment has a different office. It must 
first of all satisfy justice, and only after this is done can it attempt 
to improve the guilty. If a government should proceed on the same 
basis as the educator, it would mistake its task, because it has to dea!

    with adults, whom it elevates to the honorable position of respo! 
bility for their own acts. The state must not go back to the gene! 
of a negative deed in the disposition, or the motives, or the circu: 
stances, It must assign to a secondary rank of importance the bil 
graphical factor which contains the origin of the deed and the cij 
cumstances of a mitigating character, and it must consider first 
all the deed in itself. It is quite otherwise with the educator; for 
deals with human beings who are relatively undeveloped, and w! 
are only growing toward responsibility. So long as they are sti 
under the care of a teacher, the responsibility of their deed belon, 
in part to him. Hf we confound these two standpoints on which pun 
isbment is administered, that of the state and that of education, w 
work much evil. 
{Corrective punishment seeks solely the improvement of th 
Gelinquent ; retributive punishment under statute laws secks 
only the return of the deed upon the doer; i.e, to satisfy the 
claims of justice. Hegel, in his “ Philosophy of History,” in 
speaking of state punishments in China, drew this distinction 
and pointed out: its significance.] 
§ 40. Punishment as a negation of a negation, con- 
sidered as an educational means, can not be determined, 
as to its application, by mere reference to the deed, but 
must always be modified by the peculiarities of the i in- 
dividual offender and by the other circumstances. Its 
administration calls for the exercise of the ingenuity and 
tact of the educator. 
[Punishment should be regulated, not by abstract rules, but in 
view of the particular case and its attending circumstances, for 
the reason that it is for correction and not for retribution. 
Retributive punishment need only consider the magnitude of 
the offense.] 
§ 41. Generally speaking, we must take into consid- 
eration the sex and the age: (1) some kind of corporal 
punishment is most suitable for children, (2) isolation 
for older boys and girls, and (3) punishment based on 
the sense of honor for young men and women.
-P-A-G-E-66
THE FORM OF EDUCATION. 41 
[Sex and age of pupil should be regarded in prescribing the 
mode and degree of punishment. Corporal punishment is best 
for pupils who are very immature in mind; when they are more 
developed they may be punished by any imposed restraint upon 
their free-wills which will isolate them from the ordinary rou- 
tine followed by their fellow-pupils. (Deprivation of the right 
to do as others do is a wholesome species of punishment for 
those old or mature enough to feel its effects, for it tends to 
secure respect for the regular tasks by elevating them to the 
rank of rights and privileges.) For young men and women, the 
punishment should be of a kind that is based on a sense of 
honor. This distinction by Rosenkranz is very important. It 
is based on Hegel’s distinction alluded to above (§ 89) of correct- 
tive from retributive punishment. In cities, suspension of the 
pupil from school, and his transfer to another school on resto- 
ration, is one of the most effective means ever devised for devel- 
oping in the pupil a self-control that secures good behavior 
without resort to corporal punishment.* 
§ 42. (1) Corporal punishment is the production of 
physical pain, generally by whipping, and this kind of 
punishment, provided always that it is not too often ad- 
ministered or with undue severity, is the kindest method 
of dealing with willful defiance, with obstinate careless- 
ness, or with a really perverted will, so long or so often 
as the higher perception is closed against appeal. The 
imposing of other physical punishment, e. g., that of 
depriving the pupil of food, partakes of cruelty. The 
view which sees in the rod the panaceat for all the 
teacher’s embarrassments is reprehensible, but equally 
zo is the false sentimentality which assumes that the 
dignity of humanity is affected by a blow given toa

To leave a child entirely to himself without any supervision, eve 
if one shuts him up in a dark room, is as mistaken a practice as t 
leave a few together without supervision, as is sometimes done whe: 
they are kept after school; in such situations they give the frees 
rein to their childish wantonness and commit the wildest pranks. 
[Isolation makes the pupil realize a sense of his dependence. 
upon human society, and of his need for the constant exy 
of this dependence by co-operation in the common tasks.

who has arrived at a sense of honor. In communities where 
children acquire this sense at a very early age, corporal punish- 
ment should be dispensed with altogether, and punishments re- 
sorted to that develop # sense of responsibility by causing the 
culprit to feel the effect of his deeds in depriving him of privi- 
leges common to all good pupils.)) © 
§ 44. (8) This way of isolating a child does not prop- 
erly touch his sense of honor, and is soon forgotten, be- 
cause it relates to only one side of his conduct. It is 
quite different. from punishment based on the sense of 
honor, which, in a formal manner, shuts the youth out 
from social participation because he has attacked the prin- 
ciple which holds society together, and for this reason can 
no longer be subsumed under its generality (i.e., allowed 
to participate in the society of his fellows). Honor is the 
recognition of one individual by others as their equal. 
Through his transgression, or it may be his misdemeanor, 
he has simply lost his equality with them, and in so far 
has separated himself from them, so that his banishment 
from their society is only the outward expression of the 
real isolation which he himself has brought to pass in 
his inner nature, and which he by means of his negative 
act only betrayed to the outer world. Since the pun- 
ishment founded on the sense of honor affects the whole 
ethical man and makes a lasting impression upon his 
memory, extreme caution is necessary in its applicatior 
lest a permanent injury be inflicted upon the character. 
The idea of his perpetual continuance in disgrace, de- 
stroys in a man all aspiration for improvement. 
Within the family this feeling of honor can not be so actively 
developed, because every member of it is bound to every other im- 
mediately by natural ties, and hence is equal to every other. Within 
its sacred circle, he who has isolated himself is still beloved, though 
it may be through tears, However bad may be the deed he has com-

mitted, he is never given up, but the deepest sympathy is felt for hil 
becanse he is still brother, father, ete. But first in the relation 
one family with another, and still more in the relation of an in 
vidual with any institution which is founded not on natural ties, b 
is set over against him as an entirely independent existence, this fee} 
ing of honor appears. In the school, and in the matter of ranks an 
honors in a school, this is very important. : 
[Punishment based on the sense of honor may or may ni 
be based on isolation, It implies a degree of maturity on th 
part of the pupil. Through his offense the pupil has destroy 
his equality with his fellows, and has in reality, in his inmost 
nature, isolated himself from them. Corporal punishment is ex 
ternal, but it may be accompanied with a keen sense of dishonor. 
Isolation also may, to a pupil who is sensitive to honor, be a| 
severe blow to self-respect, But a punishment founded entirely 
on the sense of honor would be wholly internal, and have no ex- 
ternal discomfort attached to it. He who “attacks the principle 
that holds society together,” by doing things that tend to de- 
stroy that social union, should be excluded from it or “not sub- 
sumed under its generality.” Social union is a common bond, 
a general condition, or a participation. Regularity, punctuality, 
silenge, attention, and industry, are indispensable for the associ- 
ated effort of the school, and the pupil who persistently violates 
these conditions should he isolated from the school.} 
§ 45. It is important to consider well this gradation of 
punishment—which, starting with physical pain, which 
appeals to the senses, passes through the external tele- 
’ ology (appeal to external motives) of temporary isolation 
up to the idealism (appeal to one’s ideal) of the sense of 
honor—both in relation to the different ages at which 
‘they are appropriate and to the training which they 
bring with them. Every punishment must be consid- 
ered merely as a means to some end, and, in so far, as 
transitory. The pupil must always be deeply conscious 
that it is very painful to his instructor to be obliged to 
punish him. This pathos of another’s solicitude for his
-P-A-G-E-70

eure, which he perceives in the mien, in the tone of the 
voiee, in the hesitation with which the punishment is 
administered, will become a purifying fire for his soul. 
[The necessity of carefully adapting the punishment to the 
age and maturity of the pupil renders it the most difficult part 
. of the.teacher’s duties. It is essential that the air and manner 
of the teacher who punishes should be that of one who acts from 
a sense of painful duty, and not from any delight in being the 
cause of suffering. Not personal likes and dislikes, but the ra- 
tional necessity which is over teacher and pupil alike, causes the 
infliction of pain on the pupil.) 
CHAPTER Iii. 
THE LIMITS OF EDUCATION. 
§ 46. As respects its form, education reaches its Jim- 
its with the idea of punishment, because this is the ef- 
fort to conquer the negative reality (i. e., the resistance 
which it meets in the pupil’s opposition) and to make it 
conformable to its positive idea. But the general limits 
of education are found in the idea of its function, which 
is to fashion the individual into theoretical and practical 
rationality. The authority of the educator at last be- 
comes imperceptible, and it passes over into advice and 
example, and obedience changes from blind conformity 
to free gratitude and attachment. Individuality wears 
off its rough edges, and is transfigured into the univer- 
sality and necessity of reason without losing in this pro- 
cess its personal identity. Work becomes enjoyment, 
and he finds his play in a change of activity. The

youth takes possession of himself, and can be left 
himself. 
There are two widely differing views with regard to the limi 
of education. One lays great stress on the weakness of the pupil an: 
the power of the teacher. According to this view, education has fo) 
its province the entire formation of the youth. The despotism o! 
this view often manifests itself, where large numbers are to be edu 
cated together, and with very undesirable results, because it assumes 
that the individual pupil is only a specimen of the whole, as if th 
school were a great factory where each piece of goods is to be stamped| 
exactly like all the rest. Individuality is reduced by the tyranny of 
such despotism to one uniform level till all originality is destroyed. 
as in cloisters, barracks, and orphan asylums, where only one indi- 
vidual seems to exist. There is a kind of pedagogy, also, which fan- 
cies that one can thrash into or out of the individual pupil what one 
will. This may be called a superstitious belief in the power of edu- 
cation. The opposite extreme is skeptical, and advances the policy 
which lets alone and does nothing, urging that individuality is uncon- 
querable, and that. often the most careful and far-sighted education 
fails of reaching its aim in so far as it is opposed to the nature of the 
youth, and that this individuality has made of no avail all efforts to- 
ward the obtaining of any end which was opposed to it. This view 
ot the fruitlessness of all edutational efforts engenders an indiffer- 
“ence toward it which would leave, as a result, only a sort of vegeta- 
tion of individuality growing at hap-hazard. 
[Punishment is the final topic considered under the head of 
“Form of Education,” and it introduces us to the next topic, 
“The Limits of Education.” In the act of punishment, the 
teacher abandons the legitimate province of education, which 
secks to make the pupil rational or obedient to what is reason- 
able, as a habit, and from his own free-will. The pupil is pun- 
ished in order that he may be made to conform to the rational, 
by the application of constraint, Another will is substituted for 
the pupil’s, and good behavior is produced, but not by the pu- 
pil’s free act. In disobedience and in the occasion for the use 
of punishment accordingly education encounters its negative 
limit—the limit that excludes it and refuses to receive it. While 
education finds a negative limit in punishment, it finds a posi- 
tive limit in the accomplishment of its legitimate object, which     
    
   
       
-P-A-G-E-72

is the emancipation of the pupil from the state of imbecility. 
as regards mental and moral self-control, into the ability to 
direct himself rationally. The school has done its work and is 
no longer needed. When the pupil has acquired the discipline 
which enables him to direct his studies properly, and to control 
his inclinations in such a manner as to pursue his work regular. 
Jy, the teacher is superfluous for him—he becomes his own teach- 
er. There may be two extreme views on this subject—the one 
tending toward the negative extreme of requiring the teacher to 
do everything for the pupil, substituting his will for that of the 
pupil, and the other view tending to the positive extreme, and 
leaving everything to the pupil, even before his will is trained 
into habits of self-control, or his mind provided with the neces- 
sary elementary branches requisite for the prosecution of further 
study.] . 
§ 47. (1) The first limit of education is a subjective 
one, a limit found in the individuality of the youth. 
This is a definitive (insurmountable) limit. “Whatever 
does not exist in this individuality as a possibility can 
not be developed from it. Education can only lead and 
assist ; it can not create. What Nature has denied toa 
man, education can not give him any more than it is, 
able, on the other hand, to annihilate entirely his origi- - 
nal gifts, although it is true that his talents may be sup- 
pressed, distorted, and measurably destroyed. But the 
decision of the question in what the real essence of any 
one’s individuality consists can never be mage with cer- 
tainty till he has left behind him his years of. develop- 
ment, because it is then only that he first arrives at the 
consciousness of his entire self; besides, at this time, 
many superficial acquirements will drop off ; and on the 
other hand, talents, long slumbering and unsuspected, 
may first make their appearance. Whatever has been 
forced upon a child in opposition to his individuality, 
whatever has heen only driven into him and has lacked

AS THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION, 
receptivity on his part or a demand for cultivation, re- 
mains attached to his being only as an external orna- 
ment, a parasitical outgrowth which enfeebles his own 
proper character. 
We must distinguish from that false tendency which arises 
through a misunderstanding of the limit of individuality, the affecta- 
tion of children and young persons who often suppose, when they seo 
models finished and complete in grown persons, that they themselves 
are endowed by Nature with the power to develop into the same. 
‘When they see a reality which corresponds to their own possibility, 
the anticipation of a like or a similar attainment moves them to an 
imitation of it.as a model personality. ‘This may be sometimes car- 
ried so far as to be disagreeable or ridiculous, but should not be too 
strongly censured, because it springs from a positive striving after 
culture, and needs only proper direction. 
‘ [The subjective limit of education (on the negative side) is 
to be found in the individuality of the pupil—the limit to his 
natural capacity.] 
§ 48. (2) The second or objective limit of educa 
tion lies in the means which can be appropriated for it. 
That the talent for a certain culture shall be present is 
certainly the first thing; but the cultivation of this tal- 
ent is the second, and no less necessary. But how much 
cultivation can be given to it extensively and intensively 
depends upon the means used, and these again are con- 
ditioned’ by the material resources of the family to 
which one belongs. The greater and more valuable the 
means of culture which are found in a family, the greater 
is the immediate advantage which the culture of each 
one has at the start. With regard to many of the arts 
and sciences this limit of education is of great signifi- 
cance. But the means alone are of no avail. The finest 
educational apparatus will produce no fruit where cor- 
responding talent is wanting, while on the other hand
-P-A-G-E-74
THE LIMITS OF EDUCATION. 4g 
talent often accomplishes incredible feats with very lim- 
ited means, and, if the way is only once open, makes of 
itself a center of attraction which draws to itself with 
magnetic power the necessary means. The moral cult- 
ure of each one is, however, fortunately from its very 
nature, out of the reach of such dependence. 
In considering the limit made by individuality we recognize the 
side of truth in that indifference which considers education entirely 
superfiuous, and in considering the means of culttre we find the 
truth in the other éxtreme, that of pedagogical despotism, which fan- 
cies that it can command whatever culture it chooses for any one 
without regard to his individuality. 
[The objective limit to education lies in the amount of time 
that the person may devote to his training. It, therefore, de- 
pends largely upon wealth, or other fortunate circumstances.) 
§ 49. (8) Finally, the absolute limit of education 
is the time when the youth has apprehended the prob- 
lem which he has to solve, has learned to know the 
means at his disposal, and has acquired a certain facil- 
ity in using them. The end and aim of education is 
the emancipation of the youth. It strives to make him 
self-dependent, and as soon as he has become so it 
wishes to retire and leave to him the sole responsibility 
for his actions. To treat the youth after he has passed 
this point of time still as a youth, contradicts the very 
idea of education, which idea finds its fulfillment in 
the attainment of this state of maturity by the pupil. 
Since the completion of education cancels the original 
inequality between the educator and the pupil, nothing 
is more oppressing, nay, revolting to the latter than to 
be excluded by a continued state of dependence from 
the enjoyment of the freedom which he has earned. 
The opposite of this extreme, which protracts education beyond 
its proper time and produces this state of inward revolt, is the undue
-P-A-G-E-75
50 THE GENERAL IDEA OF EDUCATION. 
hastening of the emancipation.—The question whether one is pre- 
pared for freedom has been often opened in politics. When any peo- 
ple have gone so far as to ask this question themselves, it is no longer 
@ question whether that people are prepared for it, for without the 
consciousness of freedom this question would never have occurred tu 
them. : 
{The absolute limit of education is the positive limit (see § 46), 
beyond which the youth passes into freedom from the school, as 
a necessary instrumentality for further culture.] 
§ 50. Although teachers must now leave the youth 
free, the necessity of further culture for him still re- 
mains. But it will no longer come directly through 
them. Their prearranged, pattern-making work is now 
supplanted by self-education. Each sketches for him- 
self an ideal to which in his life he seeks to approximate 
every day. 
In the work of self-culture one friend can help another by advice 
and example; but he can not educate, for education presupposes in- 
equality of acquirement and authority.—The necessities of human 
nature produce societies in which equals seek to influence each other 
in a pedagogical way, since they establish certain grades or orders 
based on steps of culture. They presuppose education in the ordi- 
nary sense, But they wish to bring about education in a higher 
sense, and therefore they veil the last form of their ideal in the mys- 
tery of secrecy.—To one who tives on contented with himself and 
without the impulse toward self-culture, unless his unconcern springs 
from his belonging to a savage state of society, the Germans give 
the name of Philistine, and he is always repulsive to the student 
who is intoxicated with an ideal. 
[The prearranged pattern-making work of the school is now 
done, but self-education may and should go on indefinitely, and 
will go on if the education of the school has really arrived at its 
“absolute limit ’—i. e., has fitted the pupil for self-education. 
Emancipation from the school does not emancipate one from 
learning through his fellow-men. Man’s spiritual life is one 
depending upon co-operation with his fellow-men. Each must 
avail himself of the experience of his fellow-men, and in turn
-P-A-G-E-76

communicate his own experience to the common fund of the 
race. Thus each lives the life of the whole, and all live for 
each, School-education gives the pupil the instrumentalities 
with which to enable him to participate in this fund of experi- 
ence—this common life of the race. After school-education 
comes the still more valuable education, which, however, with- 
out the school, would be in a great measure impossible.]

THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
INTRODUCTION. 
§ 51. Epvcarion in general consists in the develop- 
ment in man of his inborn theoretical and practical ra- 
tionality ; it takes on the form of labor, which changes 
that state or condition, which appears at first only as a 
mere thought, into a fixed habit, and transfigures in- 
dividuality into a worthy humanity, Education ends 
in that emancipation of the youth which places him on 
his own feet. The special elements which form the 
concrete content of all education in general are the life, 
cognition, and will of man. Without life mind has no 
phenomenal reality; without cognition, no genuine— 
i. e., conscious—will; and without will, no self-confirma- 
tion of life and of cognition. It is true that these three 
elements are in real existence inseparable, and continu- 
ally exhibit their interdependence. But none the less 
on this aceount do they themselves prescribe their own 
succession, and they have a relative and periodical as- 
cendency over each other. In infancy, up to the fifth 
or sixth year, the purely physical development takes the 
precedence; childhood is the time of learning, in a

    proper sense, an act by which the child gains for 
self the picture of the world, such as mature mind. 
through experience and insight, have painte” ~ 
finally, youth is the transition period to practic 
to which the self-determination of the will 
the first impulse. 
{Education is the development of reason innate in man 
theoretical as intellect, practical as will-power. It is a labo 
that changes an ideal into a real, making what is potential int 
an actual; transfiguring the “natural” man. so to’ speak, into 
spiritual man. Education forms “habits.” It develops id 
human nature into real human nature by means of this forma: 
tion of habits. (Play differs from labor in this, that it does no 
seek to transform an ideal into a real, but to make a se 
of contradiction between the ideal and real; it makes 
seem to be what it is not.) There are three special ele ____ ___ 
man, each of which needs education: these are life (bodily or- 
ganism), cognition (knowing faculty or intellect). and will. To 
some extent there is a succession of periods based on this dis- 
tinction: (1) the period of nurture, lasting till the sixth year, 
or during infancy, in which the education of the body is more 
important than the education of the mind; (2) the period of 
the school, lasting through childhood—say to fourteen yea 
in which general or intellectual education is most important ' 
the period of youth—from fourteen to eighteen—in which vue 
most important education is the specializing of the practi 
plication of knowledge and strength to particular forms 0! 
hence will-education. While these periods are thus wouu 
guished by the relative importance of the three different disci- 
plines, it is essential that no one of these disciplines shall he 
neglected in any period.] . 
§ 52. The classification of the special elemen 
education is hence very simple: (1) the physica 
the intellectual, (3) the practical (in the sense of 
education). We sometimes apply to these the words 
orthobiotics, didactics, and pragmatics.
-P-A-G-E-82
INTRODUCTION. 57 
ARsthetic training constitutes only an element of intellectual 
education, just as social, moral, and religious training form elements 
of practical (or will) education. But because these latter elements 
concern themselves with the action of the individual upon the ex- 
ternal world, the name “ pragmatics” is appropriate. In this sphere, 
education (Pidagogik) should coincide with politics, ethics, and re- 
ligion. But it is distinguished from them through the skill with 
which it puts into practice the problems of the other two (life and 
cognition). The scientific arrangement of these ideas must therefore 
show that the former, as the more abstract, constitutes the condition, 
and the latter, as the more concrete, the ground of the former, which 
is presupposed ; and in consequence of this it is itself their principle 
and teleological presupposition, just as in man the will presupposes 
the cognition, and cognition life; while, at the same time, life, in a 
deeper sense, must presuppose cognition, and cognition will, 
[The classification in pedagogics is based on the distinction 
of the three elements in man that require education: (1) Physi- 
cal (correct living = orthobiotics) ; (2) intellectual (correct per- 
ceiving, knowing, and thinking = didactics) ; (8) practical (cor- 
rect action, proper habits = pragmatics). Aisthetic training, or 
the sense for the appreciation and production of the beautiful, 
falls, in a threefold division, into the second—into theoretic 
education. Social, moral, and religious training belong to the 
third division, as they concern the will and its utterance in deeds, 
“ Pragmatics ” signifies the doctrine of human deeds, and in- 
cludes the spheres of ethics, politics, and religion. (There may 
be defined a fivefold system of education, basing the distinction 
on the institutions of civilization: (a) Nurture = the education 
of the family; (b) the school, or education into the convention- 
alities of intelligence ; (c) the art, trade, or profession that forms 
the vocation in life = the education of civil society; (d) the 
political education into citizenship, resulting from obedience to 
Jaws and participation in making and sustaining them; (e) re- 
ligious education. ‘These five forms of education depend on (a) 
the family, (b) the school, (c) civil society, (d) the State, (e) 
the Church, The school is properly a transition between the 
family and civil society, and forms the institution of education 
par excellence, Hence, while education, very properly, is defined. 
so as to include all of human life, there is a period specially 
characterized as “ education” which transpires in the school, a
-P-A-G-E-83
) 8 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
special institution that partakes of the character of the fandly 
on the one hand, and of civil society on the other. In the school, 
of course, there should be some attention paid to all spheres of 
education, but its main business should be the acquisition “of 
the picture of the world such as mature minds through experi- 
ence and insight have painted it” (see § 51 near the end), or, in 
other words, conventional items of information, insights into 
laws and principles, and the elementary processes of their com- 
bination. This makes the “view of the world” which each 
civilized human being is supposed to possess. It is important 
to know the exact province of the school, and to see that it is 
only one of the five forms of education that civilization provides 
for man, Much of the carping criticism leveled against schools, 
in times of financial distress or general social depression, is 
based on the assumption that the province of the school is all 
education instead of a small but very important fraction of it. 
The school may do its share of correct education, but it can not 
correct the effects of neglect of family nurture, nor insure its 
youth against evil that will follow if civil society furnishes no 
steady employment, no opportunity for settled industry, and 
the state no training into consciousness of higher manhood by 
its just laws, and by offering to the citizen a participation in 
the political process of legislation and administration, carefully 
guarding its forms so that its politics does not furnish a train- 
ing in corruption. Nor can the school insure the future of its 
pupils unless the Church does its part in the education of the 
individuals of the community.) “The scientific arrangement of 
these ideas ”—i. e., life, intellect, and will—* must show that the 
former, as more abstract, constitute the conditions ”—i. e., life 
is the condition of intellect, and both intellect and life the con- 
ditions of will—-while “the latter, as more concrete, are the 
ground of the former ”—i, e., intellect is the ground of life, or, 
in other words, its final cause, and so will is the ground and 
final cause of intellect. Intellect contains all that life contains, 
and much more—namely: While life realizes its totality of spe- 
cies only in many individuals, and each individual is a partial 
and special half of the species as male or female, the intellect 
as consciousness is subject and object in one, and each indi 
vidual intellect is potentially the entire species—each thinking 
being can think all the thoughts of the greatest thinkers of the
-P-A-G-E-84
PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 59 
race. So, will contains all that intellect contains, and more, 
For what is potential in intellect (the identity of subject and 
object of thought) is real in the will. The will makes objective 
its internal subjective forms, and in its highest ethical activity 
it becomes conscious freedom.] 
CHAPTER I. 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 
§ 53. Tax art of living rightly is based upon a com- 
prehension of the process of life. Life is the restless 
dialectic process which ceaselessly transforms the inor- 
ganic into the organic, and at the same time produces 
the inorganic, and separates from itself whatever part 
of its food has not been assimilated, and that which has 
become dead and burned out. The organism is healthy 
when it corresponds to this idea of the dialectic process 
of a life which moves up and down, inward and out- 
ward; of formation and reformation ; of organizing and 
disorganizing. All the rules for physical education, or 
of hygiene, are derived from this conception. 
{The rules of hygiene are derived from an insight into the 
twofold process of assimilation and elimination which goes on 
in the living organism with relation to the inorganic substances 
which it uses.] 
§ 54. It follows from this that the change of the 
relatively inorganic to the organic is going on not only 
in the organism as a whole, but also in its every organ 
and in every part of every organ; and that the organic, 
as soon as it has attained its highest point of energy, is
-P-A-G-E-85
60 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
again degraded to the inorganic and thrown out. Every 
cell has its history. Activity is, therefore, not contra- 
dictory to the organism, but favors in it the natural 
progressive and regressive metamorphosis. This process 
can go on harmoniously—that is, the organism can be in 
health—only when not merely the whole organism, but 
each special organ, is allowed, after its productive activ- 
ity, the corresponding rest and recreation necessary for 
its self-renewal. We have this periodicity exemplified 
in waking and sleeping, also in exhalation and inhalation, 
excretion and taking in of material. When we have 
discovered the relative antagonism of the organs and 
their periodicity, we have found the secret of the peren- 
nial renewal of life. 
[Perpetual change goes on in the living organism, converting 
the inorganic into organic tissue and then reconverting it. This 
alternation is the basis of the demand for the alternation of pro- 
ductive activity with rest and recreation in the whole physical 
system.] 
§ 55. Fatigue makes its appearance when any organ, 
or the organism in general, is denied time for the return 
“movement into itself and for renovation. It is possible 
for some one organ, without injury, as if isolated, to 
exercise a great and long-continued activity, even to the 
point of fatigue, while the other organs rest; as, e. g., 
the lungs, in speaking, while the other parts are quiet ; 
on the other hand, it is not well to speak and run at the 
same time. The idea that one can keep the organism 
in better condition by inactivity is an error which rests 
upon a mechanical view of life. Equally false is the 
idea that health depends upon the quantity and excel- 
lence of the food; without the force to assimilate it, 
it is poison rather than nourishment. True strength
-P-A-G-E-86
DIETETICS. 61 
arises only from activity. [Mention of works on hy- 
giene here is omitted in this translation.] 
[Fatigue defined. It may occur with the whole organism ot 
with a part. The idea that total rest is healthy isa misappre- 
hension. The organism requires alternation of rest and activity, 
which alternation itself is activity because it is change. Hence, 
“true strength arises only from activity.”’] 
§ 56. Physical education, as it concerns the repairing, 
the motor, or the nervous activities, is divided into (1) 
dietetics, (2) gymmastics, (3) sexual education. In real 
life these activities are scarcely separable, but for the 
sake of exposition we must consider them apart. In the 
regular development of the human being, moreover, the 
repairing system has a relative precedence to the motor 
system, and the latter to the sexual maturity. But edu- 
cation can treat of these ideas only with reference to 
the infant, the child, and the youth. 
[Physical education treats of (a) the repairing activity or nu- 
trition, (b) the motor or muscular activity, and (c) the nervous 
activity, as far as they concern children and youth. 
CHAPTER I. 
(A.) DIETETICS. 
§ 57. Dimrnrcs is the art of sustaining the normal 
repair of the organism. Since this organism is, in the 
eonerete, an individual one, the general principles of 
dietetics must, in their manner of application, vary with 
the sex, the age, the temperament, the occupation, and 
the other conditions of the individual. Education as a
-P-A-G-E-87
62 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
science can only go over its general principles, and these 
can be named briefly. If we attempt to speak of de- 
tails, we fall easily into triviality. So very important 
to the whole life of man is the proper care of his physi- 
eal nature during the first stages of its development, 
that the science of education must not omit to enumer- 
ate the various systems which different people, accord- 
ing to their time, locality, and culture, have made for 
themselves; many, it is true, embracing some preposter- 
ous ideas, but in general never devoid of justification in 
their time. 
[Dietetics defined. Details here are trivial.] 
[88 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, relating to diet, omitted. 
The following is a brief summary of the contents: 
§§ 58, 59, 60, 61, treat of food for infants. § 62, why 
children need much sleep. § 68 treats of clothing of 
children.] 
§ 64. Cleanliness is a virtue to which children should 
be accustomed for the sake of their physical well-being, 
as well as because, in a moral point of view, it is of the 
greatest significance. Cleanliness will not endure that 
things shall be deprived of their proper individuality 
through the elemental chaos. It retains each as distin- 
guished from every other. While it makes necessary 
to man pure air, cleanliness of surroundings, of clothing, 
and of his body, it develops in him a sense by which 
he perceives accurately the particular limits of being in 
general. 
[Cleanliness means “a place for everything and everything in 
its place.” T'o take a thing out of its proper relations is to “ de- 
prive it of its proper individuality,” and in an “elemental chaos ” 
everything has lost its proper relations to other things, and has 
no longer any use or fitness in its existence.]
-P-A-G-E-88
GYMNASTICS, 63 
CHAPTER III. 
(B.) GYMNASTICS. 
§ 65. Grnavastics is the art of the normal training 
of the muscular system. The voluntary muscles, which 
are regulated by the nerves of the brain, in distinction 
from the involuntary automatic muscles depending on 
the spinal cord, while they are the means of man’s inter- 
course with the external world, at the same time react 
upon the automatic muscles in digestion and sensation. 
Since the movement of the muscular fibers consists in 
the alternation of contraction and expansion, it follows 
that gymnastics must bring about a change of movement 
which shall both contract and expand the muscles. 
[@ymnastics.—The voluntary and involuntary muscles distin- 
guished : the voluntary muscles form the means of communica- 
tion with the external world, and also react on the automatic 
functions of digestion, sensation, ete. Gymnastics seeks to de- 
velop the voluntary muscles in a normal manner, and through 
these indirectly to affect favorably the development of the other 
bodily systems and processes.] 
§ 66. The system of gymnastic exercise of any na- 
tion corresponds always to its mode of fighting. So long 
as this consists in the personal struggle of a hand-to-hand 
contest, gymmastics will seek to increase as much as 
possible individual strength and adroitness. As soon as 
the far-reaching missiles projected from fire-arms be- 
come the center of all the operations of war, the indi- 
vidual is lost in a body of men, out of which he emerges 
only relatively in sharp-shooting, in the charge, in close 
contests, and in the retreat. Because of this incorpora- 
tion of the individual in the one great whole, and because
-P-A-G-E-89
64 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
of the resulting unimportance of personal daring, gym 
nastics can never again be what it was in ancient times. 
Besides this, the subjectiveness of the modern spirit is 
too great to allow it to devote so much attention to the 
care of the body, or so much time to the admiration of 
its beauty, as was given by the Greeks. 
The Turner societies and Turner-halls in Germany belong to 
the period of subjective enthusiasm of the German student popula- 
tion, and had a political significance. At present, they have been 
brought back to. their proper place as an educational means, and 
they are of great value, especially in large cities. Among the mount- 
ains, and in rural districts, special arrangements for bodily exercise 
are less necessary, for the matter takes care of itself. The situation 
and the instinct for play help to foster it. In great cities, however, 
the houses are often destitute of halls or open places where the chil- 
dren can tako exercise in their leisure moments, In these cities, 
therefore, there must be some gymnastic hall where the sense of fel- 
lowship may be developed. Gymmasties are not so essential for 
girls. In its place, dancing is sufficient, and gymnastic exercise 
should be employed for them only where there exists any special 
weakness or deformity, when it may be used as a restorative or pre- 
servative. They are not to become Amazons. The boy, on the con- 
trary, needs to acquire the feeling of good-fellowship. It is true 
that the school develops this in a measure, but not fully and simply, 
because in school the standing of the boy is determined through his 
intellectual ambition. The college youth will not take much inter- 
est in special gymnastics unless he can gain distinction in it. Run- 
ning, leaping, climbing, and lifting, are too tame for their more 
mature spirits. They can take a lively interest only in the exercises 
which have a warlike character. With the Prussians, and some other 
German states, gymnastic training is provided for in the military 
training. 
[Gymnastics affected by the national military drill. The an- 
cient tribes and nations found special bodily training indispen- 
sable to success in war, and even to national preservation. Gun- 
powder and improved fire-arms have almost rendered gymnas- 
tics obsolete—the successful army, other things equal, being the 
one composed of men thoroughly disciplined in manceuvres, and
-P-A-G-E-90
GYMNASTICS, 65 
possessed individually of tact and versatility necessary to ma- 
nipulate the destructive fire-arms now used. The Greeks (see 
$$ 204-216) paid so much attention to pure gymnastics because ~ 
they worshiped the beautiful as the highest manifestation of the 
divine, and therefore looked upon their own physical perfection 
as the highest object of life. ‘he favorite exercises with our 
students are boating, ball-playing, bicycle-riding, ete, rather 
than boxing, fencing, wrestling, and “exercises which have a 
warlike character,” as Rosenkranz enumerated them in 1840.] 
§ 67. The fundamental idea of gymnastics must al- 
ways be that the spirit shall rule over its body and make 
this an energetic and docile servant of its will, Strength 
and adroitness must unite and become confident skill. 
Strength, carried to its extreme, produces the athlete ; 
-adroitness, to its extreme, the acrobat. Education must 
avoid both. All gigantic strength, as well as acrobatic 
skill, fit only for display, must be discouraged and so too 
must be the idea of teaching gymnastics with the motive 
of utility; e.g., that by swimming one may save his life 
when he falls into the water, ete. Among other things, 
utility may also be a consequence; but the principle in 
general must always be the necessity of the spirit of 
subjecting its bodily organiem to the condition of a per- 
fect instrument, so that it may ever find it equal to the 
execution of its will. 
[Gymnastics, therefore, in modern times must aim chiefly at 
developing the body for the sake of physical strength and en- 
durance, with a view to the demands of useful industry and 
mental culture on the bodily health and vigor, Health requires 
harmonious development ; the exercises must develop the parts 
of the body so as not to produce disproportion. The result of 
gymnastics is to give the mind control over the body as a whole 
—the will interpenetrates, as it were, the various organs, and by 
this means the conscious mind can re-enforce the automatic 
functions of the body; the will-power can to a certain degree 
even ward off discase.]
-P-A-G-E-91
66 THE SPECLAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
§ 68. Gymnastic exercises form a series from simple 
to compound. There seems to be so much arbitrari- 
ness in plays and games that it is always very agreeable 
to the mind to find, on nearer inspection, some rational 
order. The movements are (1) of the lower, (2) of the 
upper extremities; (3) of the whole body, with relative 
predominance, now of the upper, now of the lower ex- 
tremities. . We distinguish, therefore, foot, arm, and 
trunk movements. 
[Gymnastic exercises classified: (1) of the lower extremities: 
(a) walking, (b) running, (¢) leaping (including varieties and 
modifications, such as walking on stilts, skating, dancing, bal- 
ancing, bicycle-riding, ete.); (2) of the upper extremities: (@) 
lifting, (b) swinging, (c) throwing (including also the modifica 
tions of climbing, carrying, pole and bar exercises, quoits, ball 
and nine-pin playing, rowing, etc.); (8) of the whole body: (8) 
swimming, (b) riding, (¢) fighting. Foot, arm, and trunk move- 
ments. Such games as base-ball, and such athletic exercise as 
rowing are practiced as whole-body movements.] 
§ 69. (1) The first series of footanovements is the 
most important, and conditions the carriage of all the 
rest of the body. They are (a) walking; (6) running; 
(c) leaping: each of these being capable of modifica- 
tions, as the high and the low leap, the prolonged and 
the quick run. Sometimes we give to these different 
names, according to the means used, as walking on 
stilts; skating; leaping with a staff, or by means of the 
hands, as vaulting. Dancing is only the art of the 
graceful mingling of these movements. 
§ 70. (2) The second series includes the arm-move- 
ments, and it repeats also the movements of the first 
series. It includes (a) lifting; (0) swinging; (c) throw- 
ing. All pole and bar practice comes under lifting,
-P-A-G-E-92
GYMNASTICS. 67 
also climbing and carrying. Under throwing, come 
quoits, and ball-throwing, and nine-pin playing. All 
these movements are distinguished from each other, not 
only quantitatively but also qualitatively, in the position 
of the stretched and bent muscles; e. g., running is 
something different from quick walking. [Omission 
here of notes on books relating to the physiology of ex- 
ercise. | 
§ 71. (8) The third series, or that of movements of 
the whole body, differs from the preceding two, which 
prepare the way for it, in this, that it brings the organism 
into contact with an object, which it has to overcome 
through its own activity. This object is sometimes 
an element, sometimes an animal, sometimes a man. 
Our divisions then are (2) swimming; (8) riding; (¢) 
single combat (fencing, boxing, wrestling, ete.). In 
swimming, one must conquer the yielding liquid by 
arm and foot movements. The resistance met on ac- 
count of currents and waves may be very great, but it 
is still that of a willless and passive object. But in 
riding man has to deal with a self-willed being whose 
vitality calls forth not only his strength but also his 
intelligence and courage. The movement is therefore 
very complicated, and the rider must be able perpetually 
to individualize his activity according to the cireum- 
stances; at the same time, he must give attention not 
only to the horse, but to the nature of the ground and 
the entire surroundings. But it is only in the struggle 
with men that gymmastics reaches its highest point, for 
in this man offers himself as a living antagonist to man 
and threatens him with danger. It is no longer the 
spontaneous activity of an unreasoning existence; it 1s
-P-A-G-E-93
68 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUUVATION, 
the resistance and attack of intelligence itself with 
which he has to deal. Fencing, or single combat, is the 
truly chivalrous exercise, and this may be combined 
with horsemanship. 
Tn the single combat there is found also a qualitative gradation, 
whence we have three systems: (a) boxing and wrestling ; (6) fencing 
with sticks; and (e) rapier and broadsword fencing. In the first, 
which was cultivated to its highest point among the Greeks, direct 
immediateness rules, In the boxing of the English, a sailor-like 
propensity of this nation, fighting with the fists is still retained as a 
custom, Fencing with a stick is found among the French mechan- 
ics, the so-called compagnons. Men often use the cane in their con- 
tests; it is a sort of refined club. When we use the sword or rapier, 
the weapon becomes deadly. The Southern Europeans excel in the 
use of the rapier, the Germans in that of the broadsword. But the 
art of single combat is much degenerated, and the pistol-duel, 
through its increasing frequency, proves this degeneration.

INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 
§ 80. Mens sana in corpore sano is correct as a peda- 
gogical maxim, but false in the judgment of individual 
cases; because it is possible, on the one hand, to have a 
healthy mind in an unhealthy body, and, on the other 
hand, an unhealthy mind in a healthy body. Neverthe- 
less, to strive after the harmony of soul and body is the 
material condition of all normal activity. The develop-
-P-A-G-E-94
| INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, ~ 69 
ment of intelligence presupposes physical health. Here 
we are to speak of the science of the art of teaching, 
technically called “ didactics.” This had its presupposi- 
tion on the side of Nature, as was before seen, in physi- 
cal education, but in the sphere of mind it presupposes 
psychology and logic. Instruction implies considera- 
tions of psychology as well as of logical method. 
[Education has to note bodily conditions of the mind, and to 
prescribe methods of physical training. It has more especially 
to note also the nature of mind and comprehend the science of 
psychology, and prescribe the methods of developing the several 
powers of the mind. It has also to study logic in order to mas- 
ter the proper arrangement of studies and the order of teaching 
the several topics belonging under each study.] 
(@ The Psychological Presupposition. 
§ 81. In a complete system of philosophy, didacties 
could refer to the conception of mind which would 
have there been unfolded in psychology; and it must 
appear as a defect in scientific method if psychology, or 
at least the conception of the theoretical mind, has to be 
treated again within the science of education. We must 
take something for granted. Psychology, then, will here 
be consulted no further than is requisite to place on a 
sure basis the educational function which relates to it. 
[Psychology, as a science, is unfolded within the philosophy 
of spirit as an antecedent presupposition of the science of ethics 
(which forms the third part of the science of spirit, see analysis 
and commentary to § 1, pages 4,5, of this work). Hence the 
philosophy of education, which belongs to ethics (or social sci- 
ence), presupposes psychology, and in its proper place in an 
entire system might refer to it as already established. Here, in 
treating of intellectual education, we must give an outline of psy- 
chology,]°

It is interesting to note how the higher faculties (so-called 
“ faculties”—one must not, however, suppose these faculties as 
isolated “ properties” of the mind, existing side by side, like 
properties of a thing) all originate from the process of attention; 
they are higher powers or “ potencies ” of attention. Isaac New- 
ton ascribed his superiority to other men in intellectual power 
simply to the greater power of attention, Attention appears: 
Jirst,as a mere power of isolating one object from others—a 
power of concentration upon it to the exclusion of others; sec- 
ondly, it discriminates distinctions within the object or analyzes 
it: thus analysis is continued attention—the second power or 
potence of attention ; thirdly, it seizes again upon one of the 
distinetions found by analysis, and becomes abstraction; ab- 
straction might be named the third power or potence of atten- 
tion; fourthly, the attention may be directed to essential rela- 
tions of the elements found by analysis and abstraction—their 
essential relations to each other. This is a process of synthetic 
thought, a grasping-together, a comprehension—a higher activ- 
ity of mind—a fourth potence of the power of attention. It isthe 
most important matter in psychology, this process of synthesis, 
through necessary relation. To find that one object of atten- 
tion, A, involves another, B (i. e., possesses essential relation to 
it, such that A can not exist without B) is to find a necessary 
synthesis. It is to discover that instead of A by itself, or B by 
itself, there is one existence having two phases to it, one phase 
being A, and the other phase being B. It is a finding of one in 
place of two, and is a synthetic act of mind. The synthesis is 
not an arbitrary one. It is a discovery of truth: A and B were 
really two aspects of one and the same being which we may call 
AB, but they seemed to be independent. The process of atten- 
tion, up to its fourth power, is thus an ascent of cognition from 
seeming to being. The perception of dependence (“ essential re- 
lation ” is dependence) is the perception of synthesis, and belongs 
to the activity of comprehension. Reflection, as a mental activ- 
ity (or “ faculty”), is the process of discovering relations and 
dependencies among objects—hence it is a stage of synthesis— 
belonging to what we call here the “ fourth power of attention.” 
The student of educational psychology should follow out this 
mode of exploring the mind, and define for himself all of the 
so-called “faculties ” and mental acts, in terms of attention, He
-P-A-G-E-97

must note, too, that the act. of attention is an act of the mind| 
directed upon itself, the will controlling the intellect, because it 
confines its own activity (i.e. the perception in general) to a 
special field), i. e., makes it a perception of a special object to the 
exclusion of others), This synthesis is, as just remarked, the 
most important theme of psychology—it is also the most won- 
derful—a veritable fountain of surprise. Forthe strangest thing 
to learn in psychology is that the process of reflection (the direc- 
tion of the mind in upon itself) discovers the truth about the 
objects or things in the world. The first activity of sense-per- 
ception notices objects as independent of each other, as having 
no essential relations. Reflection, or attention in its higher 
powers, discovers necessary relations, and forms more adequate 
ideas of the truth, Isaac Newton saw the sun and planets as 
one gravitating whole—a system—and his knowledge certainly 
came nearer the truth than did the knowledge of previous astrou- 
omers who merely knew the sun and planets in their separate 
existence. In going into the truth of objects the mind goes 
into itself at the same time. Psychology points backward to 
the great fact that reason made both the world and the human 
intellect.] 
§ 83. Attention, depending as it does on the self- 
determination of the observer, can therefore be im- 
proved, and the pupil made attentive, by the educator. 
Education must accustom him to an exact, rapid, and 
many-sided attention, so that at the first contaet with 
an object he may grasp it sufficiently and truly, and that 
it shall not be necessary for him always to be changing 
his impressions concerning it. The twilight and par- 
tialness of intelligence which force a pupil always to 
new corrections because he has all along failed to give 
entire attention must not be tolerated. 
{Attention (depending as it does upon the voluntary powers 
of the mind) can be developed or educated. (The fact that the 
child is capable of exercising his will-power on his intellect is 
the fundamental fact that makes all intellectual education pos 
sible. ‘There is no intellect, strictly speaking. until the will hes

combined with the perception.) Self-determination or self-activ- 
ity is the characteristic principle of life or living being. Related 
to itself it becomes consciousness. By new relations to itself it 
develops the mental orders or stages of thinking (perception, 
representation, understanding, reason, as described in the com- 
mentary to the preceding section), Aristotle (in his book on the 
Categories) distinguishes between first and second substances 
(ctofa) referring to the object of perception (¢his animal or 
thing) and the object of the intellect (animal or thing as general 
concept). By the Arabians (Avicenna) this doctrine becomes a 
psychological doctrine of first and second intention of the mind 
(intentio animé). With the first intention we perceive objects 
of sense or “primary substances”; with the second intention 
we perceive universal objects or “second substances.” “ Inten- 
tion” here signifies the act of attention or the directing inward 
of the intellect by the will upon its own processes, so that the 
process of the “ first intention ” becomes the object of the “sec- 
ond intention.” This wonderful insight is an anticipation of 
Fichte’s modification of the Kantian philosophy. In the “Science 
of Knowledge ” (Wissenschaftslehre) Fichte has laid the basis 
for the only true psychology by a deduction of the main func- 
tions of mind from self-activity as Ego. The intellect and the 
will are discriminated: the forms of sense-perception (time and 
space), the categories of the intellect (causality and substantiality), 
the principles of the will (the moral ideas of duty and virtue).] 
§ 84. We learn from psychology that mind does not 
consist of distinct faculties, but that what we choose to 
call so are only different activities of the same power. 
Each one is just as essential as the other, on which ac- 
count education must grant to each faculty its claim to 
the same fostering care. Although we construe the 
axiom @ potiort Jit denominatio quite correctly to mean 
that man is distinguished from animals by thought, and 
by will mediated by thought [i. e., will-activity based on 
- rational motives, action directed by moral principles], 
we must not forget that feeling and imagination are not 
less necessary to a truly complete human being. The
-P-A-G-E-99
14. THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION, 
special directions which the activity of cognitive (or 
theoretical as opposed to practical intelligence or the 
will) intelligence takes are (1) sense-perception, (2) 
representation (or imagination), (8) thinking. Dialecti- 
cally, they pass over into each other; not only dues per- 
ception grow into representation, and representation into 
thinking, but thinking goes back into representation, 
and this again into perception. In the development of 
the young, the perceptive faculty is most active in the 
infant, the representative faculty in the child, and the 
thinking faculty in the youth; and thus we may distin- 
guish an intuitive, an imaginative, and a logical epoch. 
Great errors arise from the misapprehension of these different 
phases and of their dialectic, since the different forms which are suit- 
able to the different grades of youth are mingled. The infant cer- 
tainly thinks while he perceives, but this thinking is to him uncon- 
scious. Or, if he has acquired sense-perceptions, he makes them into 
mental images, and manifests his freedom in making them the sport 
of his faney. This play of fancy must not be taken for mere amuse- 
ment; it also signifies that he takes care to preserve his intellectual 
balance, and his power of assimilation while engaged in filling his 
consciousness with material. Herein the delight of the child for 
fairy-tales finds its deeper reason. The fairy-tale constantly tran- 
scends the limits of common actuality. The abstract “common 
sense” can not endure this arbitrariness and want of fixed condi- 
tions, and thus would prefer that children should read, instead, 
home-made stories of the “ Charitable Ann,” of the “ Heedless Fred- 
erick,” of the “Inquisitive Wilhelmine,” ete. Above all, it praises 
Campe’s * “ Robinson Crusoe,” which contains much heterogeneous 
matter, but nothing improbable. When the maturity of youth neces- 
sitates the transition into the earnestness of real life, the drying up 
of the imagination and the sway of the understanding supervene. 
  
* J. H. Campe, the disciple of Basedow, wrote an adaptation of De Foe’s 
work, under the title of ‘‘ Robinson der Jingere,” with a view to teach how

[(Note what has been said above in § 82.) Perception, con- 
ception, and thinking are named as the three stages of intellect. 
Perception (German word, Anschauen) here refers simply to the 
contemplation of objects by the senses. Conception (German 
word, Vorstellen) makes in the mind a picture of the object, 
but a general picture—a representation of the object in its 
outlines—a representation that will correspond not only to the 
particular object, but to all objects of the same class. Think- 
ing perceives the essential relations of the object, its depend- 
encies on its environment, and the reciprocal action. Educa- 
tion produces in the pupil the ability to carry back the activ- 
ity of the higher faculties into the lower ones, as stated in the 
text. In the presence of perception the mind learns to be able 
to recall the general representation of the type or class of objects, 
and compare the object before the senses with the genera] type 
or the definition. It enables it also-to think in the presence of 
the object, and to perceive essential relations at the same time 
that it is occupied with perception and conception. Thus it 
elevates the lower faculties to thinking perception and to think- 
ing conception. The child delights in fairy-tales because they 
sport with the fixed conditions of actuality, and present to him 
a picture of free power over nature and circumstances. Thus 
they, to some extent, prefigure to him the conquest which his 
race has accomplished, and is accomplishing—it is made to ap- 
pear as the exploits of some Aladdin, or Jack the Giant-Killer, 
To modify, change, or destroy “the limits of common actuality ” 
is the perpetual work of the race, It molds the external world 
to suit its own ideas. Play is the first education that the child 
gets to prepare him for this human destiny. The term “dia- 
lectic” is a stumbling-block to the reader unacquainted with 
German philosophy. “Dialectically they pass over into each 
other "—i. e., in tracing out either of these phases of intellect 
. we discover that it implies each of the others in order to its own 
completeness and perfection. Perception is increased immensely 
in power by adding to it conception, which brings the aid of the 
general image in which are summed up all previous perceptions ; 
thus perception re-enforced by conception is an individual activ- 
ity re-enforced by the sum total of the race activity, or at least 
by the sum total of all previous activity of the same individual 
ag well as by what he has learned trom his fellows, Thus, toa,

   perception is still more increased by adding to it the thi 
activity which perceives necessary relations. Agassiz looks at 
new fish from the Amazon River and sees at once its type any 
its variations—knows at once the great mass of its propertie: 
functions, faculties, habits, and history, simply by its classific: 
tion under already known genera, species, and sub-classes. Thi

same manner a botanist (Prof. Gray, for example) glances at 
tree as he passes it rapidly, from the car-window. He sees it: 
resemblances and its differences, however, in that rapid glance 
because he subsumes it under all that he knows—all that i 
known, in fact, as the aggregate result of all observations fo: 
thousands of years. By recognizing its series, class,.sub-class,

on the subject of that one tree. He saw enough, too, in the

peculiar, Contrast this with the information obtained

§ 85. Sunsz-peRcrprion, as the beginning of intel: 
lectual culture, is the free grasping of an object immedi-

ately present to the mind. Education can do nothing 
directly toward the performance of this act; it can only 
assist in making it easy: (1) it can isolate the object of 
consideration ; (2) it can give facility in the transition 
to another; (3) it can promote the many-sidedness of the 
interest, by which means the return to a perception 
already obtained has always a fresh charm. 
[{Sense-perception (German Anschauung) is called intuttion 
in all the earlier translations of Kant, because the Latin word 
intueri was suggested by Kant as an equivalent for anschauen, 
Hence “ intuitive epoch” means epoch of sense-perception. Per- 
ception can be assisted by isolation of the object to be perceived. 
The pupil should be trained to look for certain properties and 
attributes, and to note their peculiarities. The categories under 
which one may classify these properties and attributes are fur- 
nished by reflection. Hence, when one in the so-called “object- 
lessons” trains the pupil to note in all objects certain constantly 
recurring predicates, such as color, shape, frangibility, solubility, 
size, number, taste, smell, ete., he is bringing thought and con- 
eeption “back into perception” (see previous section) and ele- 
vating mere perception into thinking perception. The difference 
between ordinary perception and scientific perception lies just 
here: while the former is unsystematiec and fragmentary, and 
does not accumulate or collect and retain data in the form of 
general ideas, the latter is systematic, exhaustive and cumu- 
lative. Tninking gives the system. Hence, the training of 
perception is the subordination of it to the will, and the intro- 
duction of complete systematic habits of activity in place cf 
accidental perception.] 
§ 86. There are many things which can not be pre- 
sented to immediate perception, however desirable it 
may be. We must then have recourse to a mediated 
perception, and supply the lack of actual seeing by rep- 
resentations through pictures and models. But here the 
difficulty presents itself, that there are many objects 
which we are not able to represent in their true size
-P-A-G-E-103
8 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
and we must have a reduced scale, whence results a diffi 
culty as to the selection of the best standard. An ex- 
planation is then also necessary as a judicious supple 
ment to the picture. 
[All perceivable objects should be learned by actual perception 
so far as is possible. When remoteness in space and time or in- 
accessibility on account of size prevents this, a good substitute 
offers itself in the way of pictorial representation. The picture, 
of course, idealizes much—it magnifies some objects and reduces 
others, and it never presents all of the features found in nature. 
But it omits unessential details for the most part, and this fact 
makes a picture much easier to learn than the real object, al- 
though the knowledge is not so practical. The picture is com- 
monly nearer the fype or general form of the object than rea) 
specimens; the real specimens have much about them that is 
accidental, and need much comparison to discover what is the 
normal type. The picture gives this type at once, and hence 
gives assistance to the pupil—half digests his mental food for 
him, in fact. Hence the pictorial representation has advantages 
(it is easy of apprehension because it is a perception reduced to 
conception), and disadvantages (the pupil does not get tle 
strength that comes from reducing the specimens of nature to 
their types by his own efforts).} 
§ 87. Pictures are extremely valuable aids to in- 
struction when they are correct and characteristic. Cor- 
rectness must be demanded in these substitutes for nat- 
ural objects, historical persons, and scenes. Without 
this correctness, the picture, if not an impediment, is, to 
say the least, useless. 
It is only since the last half of the seventeenth century, i, e, 
since the disappearance of the genuine art of painting, that the pict- 
ure-book has appeared as an educational means; first of all, coming 
from miniature-painting. Up to that time, public life was more 
picturesque with its display of arms, furniture, houses, and churches; 
and men, from their fondness for constant travel, had their hun- 
ger for immediate perception sated. It was only afterward, when, 
n the excitement of the Thirty Years’ War, the arts of sculpture and
-P-A-G-E-104
TE a INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 79 
painting and Christian and pagan mythology became extinct, that 
there arose a greater necessity for pictured representations. The 
Orbis Rerum Sensualium Pictus, which was also to be a janua lin- 
guarum reserata, of Amos Comenius, appeared first in 1658, and was 
reprinted in 1805, Many valuable illustrated books followed. Since 
that time innumerable illustrated Bibles and histories have appeared, 
but many of them look only to the pecuniary profit of the author ot 
the publisher. [The remainder of this section, devoted to a criticism 
of the German illustrated books of the period, is omitted.] 
[Accuracy is, above all, demanded in pictorial representations. 
- The picture-book came into use chiefly after the decline of paint- 
ing. Comenius (1658) gave a great impulse to education by his 
book, which attempts to convey a knowledge of the world by 
pictures.] 
§ 88. Children have naturally a desire to collect 
things, and this may be so guided that they shall collect 
and arrange plants, butterflies, beetles, shells, skeletons, 
ete., and thus gain exactness and reality in their percep- 
tion. Especially should they practice drawing, which 
leads them to form exact images of objects. But draw- 
ing, as children practice it, does not have the educational 
significance of cultivating in them an appreciation of 
art, but rather that of educating the eye, as this must be 
exercised in estimating distances, sizes, and colors. It 
is, moreover, a great gain in many ways, if, through a 
suitable course of lessons in drawing, the child is ad- 
vanced to a knowledge of the elementary forms of na- 
ture. 
That pictures should affect children as works of art is not to be 
required. ‘They confine themselves at first to distinguishing the 
outlines and colors, and do not yet appreciate the execution. If the 
children have access to real works of art, we may safely trust in their 
power, and quietly await their moral and esthetic effect. [Notice of 
a work on drawing omitted.] 
[Children should be exercised in classification. They should 
collect and arrange cabinets for themselves. This will give 
.
-P-A-G-E-105

them ability in recognizing the type in the specimen, the gen: 
eral in the particular. Drawing, too, is excellent for the train- 
ing of sense-perception, if from objects direct, inasmuch as it 
requires the pupil to omit all that is not characteristic of the 
object. How far lines suffice to delineate an object, and fix it 
unmistakably, and what these few lines are, the art of drawmg 
teaches, Characterization must be learned first before any at- 
tempt at wxsthetic effect, But true works of art must be piaced 
where the child will receive a silent education from them, al- 
though no positive instruction is given in them.] 
§ 89. In order that looking at pictures shall not de- 
generate into mere diversion, explanations should accom- 
pany them. Only when the thought embodied in the 
illustrations is pointed out, can they be useful as a means 
of instruction. Simply looking at them is of as little 
value toward this cnd as is water for baptism without 
the Holy Spirit. Our age inclines at present to the 
superstition that man is able, by means of simple sense- 
perception, to attain a knowledge of the essence of 
things, and thereby dispense with the trouble of think- Maungs, Y asp 
ing. Illustrations are the order of the day, and, in the 
place of enjoyable descriptions, we find inferior pict- 
ures. It is in vain to try to get behind things, or to 
comprehend them, except by thinking. 
[Pictorial representation is of little service, unless accom- 
panied by analysis and explanation. Mere gazing upon a 
picture is like the thoughtless gazing upon real objects—it is 
not systematic, and does not separate the essential from the 
accidental, nor exhaust the subject.] 
§ 90. The ear as well as the eye must be cultivated. 
Music must be considered the first educational means to 
this end, but it should be music inspired by ethical 
purity. Hearing is the most internal [i. e., it reveals to 
us the internal character of objects] of all the senses,  
-P-A-G-E-106
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, 81 
and should on this account be treated with the greatest 
delicacy. Especially should the child be taught that he 
is not to look upon speech as merely a useful vehicle for 
communication and for gaining information; it should 
also give pleasure, and therefore he should be taught te 
speak distinctly and with a good intonation, and this 
ean be reached only through careful attention. 
Among the Greeks, extraordinary care was given to musical cul- 
tivation, especially in its ethical relation. Sufficient proof of this is 
found in the admirable detailed statements on this point in the “ Re- 
public” of Plato, and in the last book of the “ Politics” of Aristotle, 
Among modern nations, also, music holds a high place, and makes 
its appearance as a constant element of education. Piano-playing 
has become general, and singing is also taught. But the ethical sig- 
nificance of music is too little considered. Instruction in music often 
aims only to train pupils for display in society, and the tendency of 
the melodies which are played is restricted more and more to orches- 
tral airs of an exciting or bacchanalian character, The railroad- 
gallop style only makes the nerves of youth vibrate with stimulating 
excitement. Oral speech, the highest form of the personal mani- 
festation of mind, was also treated with great reverence by the an-~ 
cients, Among us, communication is so generally carried on by 
writing and reading that the art of speaking distinctly, correctly, 
and agreeably, has become very much neglected. Practice in decla- 
mation accomplishes, on the whole, very little in this direction, But 
we may expect that the increase of public speaking occasioned by 
our political and religious assemblies may have a favorable influence 
in this particular. 
[Training of the ear by music and by correct speaking. Tones 
are of all kinds—solemn, joyous, lively, sad, contemplative, dis- 
cordant and suggestive of hate and bitterness, harmonious and 
sweet and suggestive of love and agreement, ete. There is a 
jong scale of degrees to each one of these feelings and passions, 
and music can present all shades of each. Even the keys have 
each a special character. The German composers have used 
these and other properties of tones to advantage in constructing 
great musical dramas, in which pure music accomplishes results 
similar to words in poetry.]

CHAPTER VI. 
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. (a) Psychology (continued) 
(2) The Imaginative Epoch. 
§ 91. Tue activity of perception results in the for- 
mation of an internal picture or image which intelli- 
gence can call up at any time at pleasure, and imagine 
it as occupying an ideal space, although the object is 
absent, in fact, and thus this image or picture becomes a 
sort of general schema (or pattern applicable to a class 
of objects), and hence an image-concept. The mental 
image may (1) be compared with the perception from 
which it sprang, or (2) it may be arbitrarily altered and 
combined with other images, or (3) it may be held fast 
in the form of abstract signs or symbols which intelli- 
gence invents for it. Thus originate the functions (1) 
of the verification of conceptions, (2) of creative imagi- 
nation, and (3) of memory. For their full treatment, 
we must refer to psychology. 
[(@) Verification of conceptions through comparison of the 
eonception with the perception ; (2) creative imagination, which 
modifies or combines images; (8) memory, which holds fast 
perceptions by attaching them to arbitrary or conventional 
symbols, such as words.] 
§ 92. (1) The mental image which we form of an 
object may be correct ; again, it may be partly or wholly 
defective, if we have neglected some of the predicates 
of the perception which presented themselves, or in 80 
far as we have added to it other predicates which only 
seemingly belonged to it, and which were attached to it
-P-A-G-E-108
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, 83 
only by its accidental connection with other existences, 
Education must, therefore, foster the habit of comparing 
our conceptions with the perceptions from which they 
arose; and these perceptions, since they are liable to 
change by reason of their connection with other objects, 
must be frequently compared with our conceptions pre- 
viously derived by abstraction from them. 
[Method of verification and its function.} 
§ 93. (2) We are thus limited in our conceptions by 
our perceptions, but we exercise a free control over our 
conceptions.. We can create out of them, as simple ele- 
ments, the manifold mental shapes which we do not 
treat as given to us by objects, but as essentially our own 
work. In the science of education, we must not look 
upon this freedom as if its exercise were only to afford 
gratification, but we must see in it the reaction of the 
absolute independence of mind against the dependence 
in which the empirical reception of impressions from 
without and their reproduction in conceptions place it. 
In this process, it not only fashions in itself or repro- 
duces the phenomenal world, but it produces for itself a 
world which is all its own. 
[Emancipation of the mind takes place through its ascent 
into formative power, and this is realized in two ways: (a) in 
reaching the general types of objects, the mind finds the one 
form that stands for many, and gains ability to see the one in 
the many, the power to hold the essential and permanent with- 
out depending on any one particular object or specimen or act of 
sense-perception ; (b) in reproducing, by aid of the general con- 
ception or abstract definition, a number of special examples, it 
is able to fashion them in various ways, and yet endow them all 
with possible attributes and characteristics. The mind thus has 
free scope of realization, and can, in an ideal world of its own 
creation. participate in creative activity.]
-P-A-G-E-109
34 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
§ 94. The study of art comes here to the aid of educa- 
tion, especially of poetry, the highest art and at the same 
time the most easily communicated. The imagination 
of the pupil can be led by means of the classical works 
of creative imagination to the formation of a good taste 
both as regards ethical merit and beauty of form. The 
proper classical works for youth are those which nations 
have produced in the childhood of their culture. These 
works bring children face to face with the picture of 
the world which the human mind has sketched for itself 
in one of the necessary stages of its development. This 
is the real reason why our children never weary of 
reading Homer and the stories of the Old Testament. 
Polytheism and the heroism (as well as hero-worship) 
which belongs to it are just as substantial an element of 
the view of the world that childhood forms as monothe- 
ism with its prophets and patriarchs. The standpoint of 
modern civilization is above both of these, because it is 
mediated by both, and embraces both in itself. 
The best literature designed for the amusement of children from 
their seventh to their fourteenth year consists always of that which 
is honored by nations and the world at large. One has only to 
notice in how many thousand forms the story of Ulysses is repro- 
duced by the writers of children’s tales. Becker’s “ Ancient Stories,” 
Gustav Schwab’s most admirable “ Sagas of Antiquity,” Karl Grimm’s 
“Tales of Olden Times,” ete., what were they without the well-talk- 
ing, wily favorite of Pallas and the divine swine-herd? And just as 
indestructible are the stories of the Old Testament up to the separa- 
tion of Judah and Israel, These patriarchs with their wives and 
daughters, these judges and prophets, these kings and priests, are by 
no means ideals of virtue from the standpoint of our modern lifeless 
morality, which would smooth out of its pattern-stories for the “ dear 
children” everything that is hard and uncouth. For the very reason 
that the shadow-side is not wanting here, and that we find envy, 
vanity, evil desire, ingratitude, craftiness, and deceit, among these

Jathers of the race and leaders of God’s chosen people, have these 
stories so great an educational value. Adam, Cain, Abrahav-, Joseph, 
Samson, and David, have justly become as truly world-historical 
types as Achilles and Patroclus, Agamemnon and Iphigenia, Hector 
and Andromache, Ulysses and Penelope. 
[In the epoch of the development of the imagination the study 
of art and literature comes in. The first classics for youth are 
those which have been developed by nations in their earliest 
stages. Not only the light sides, but the darker sides of char- 
acter in these naive stories, are essential to their educative 
effect, They furnish types of human character, and types of 
human situations, a knowledge of which constitutes wisdom, 
The conception of the characters of Cain, Joseph, Samson, 
David, Saul, Ulysses, Penelope, Achilles, and the like, furnishes 
a ready classification for special instances of character that we 
encounter in our experience.] 
§ 95. There may be produced, also, out of the sim- 
plest and naivest phases of different epochs of culture 
of one and the same people, stories which answer to the 
imagination of children, and represent to them the char- 
acteristic features of the past of their people. 
The Germans possess such a collection of their stories in their 
popular books of the “ Invulnerable Sigfried,” of the “ Heymon Chil- 
dren,” of “Beautiful Magelone,” “Fortunatus,” “The Wandering 
Jew,” “Faust,” “The Adventurous Simplicissimus,” “The Schild- 
birger,” “The Island of Felsenburg,” “ Leonard and Gertrude,” etc. 
Also, the poetical art works of the great masters which possess na- 
tional significance must be mentioned here, as the “ Don Quixote ” 
of Cervantes. 
[Every child should read as indispensable the stock of stories 
which furnish these general types of character and situation, 
“Robinson Crusoe,” “Gulliver’s Travels,” “Don Quixote,” the 
“ Arabian Nights,” Plutarch’s “Lives,” Homer’s “Iliad” and 
“Odyssey,” and the dramas of Shakespeare, should be read 
sooner or later. Harlier than these, the old English stories 
and fairy-tales, and even “ Mother Goose’s Melodies.” A scale 
thus extending from the earth to the fixed stars of genius 
furnishes pictures of human life of all degrees of concreteness 
8
-P-A-G-E-111
86 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
The meager and abstract outline is given in the nursery-tale, 
and the deep, comprehensive grasp of the situation with ail of 
its motives is found in Shakespeare. The summation of the 
events of life in “Solomon Grandy” has been compared to the 
epitome furnished by Shakespeare in the “Seven Ages,” and the 
disastrous voyage of the “Three Men of Gotham” is made a 
universal type of human disaster arising from ash adventure. 
The bald incident related in the nursery rhyme gives the child 
a typical fact or event which answers for a general concept and 
enables him to “re-enforce” (see commentary to § 84) his sense- 
perception, so that he acquires conscious experience far more 
rapidly than he could do without its aid.} 
§ 96. The commonest form in which the childish 
imagination finds exercise is that of fairy-tales; but edu- 
cation must take care that it has these in their proper 
shape as national productions, and that they are not of 
the morbid kind which artificial poetry so often gives 
us in this species of literature, and which not seldom 
degenerate into sentimental caricatures and silliness. 
The East Indian stories are most excellent because they have 
their origin with a child-like people who live wholly in the imagina- 
tion, By means of the Arabian filtration, which took place in Cairo 
in the flourishing period of the Egyptian caliphs, all that was too 
sharacteristically Indian was excluded, and they were made in the 
“Tales of Sheherazade,” a book for all peoples, with whose far-reach- 
ing power in child-literature the local stories of ‘a single people, as, 
e. g., Grimm’s admirable ones of German tradition, can not compare. 
Fairy-tales made to order, like those with a medieval Catholic tend- 
ency, or very moral and dry, as we often see them, are a bane to the 
youthful imagination in their insipid sweetness. We must here add, 
however, that lately we have had some better success in our attempts 
since we have learned to distinguish between the natve natural poetry, 
which is without reflection, and the poetry of art, which is more or 
iess molded by criticism and a conscious ideal. This distinction has 
produced good fruits even in the picture-books of children. The 
pretensions of the gentlemen who printed illustrated: books contain- 
ing nothing more solid than the alphabet and the multiplication- 
table have become less prominent since such men as Speckter, Fréh-
-P-A-G-E-112
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, 8? 
fich, Gutsmuths, Hofmann (the writer of “Slovenly Peter”), and 
others have shown that seemingly trivial things can be handled with 
intellectual power, if one is blessed with it, and that nothing is more 
opposed to the child’s imagination than the childishness into which 
so many writers for children have fallen when they attempted to de- 
scend with dignity from their assamed. lofty standpoint. Men are 
beginning to uriderstand that Christ promised the kingdom of heaven 
to little children on other grounds than because they had, as it were, 
the privilege-of being thoughtless and foolish. 
[Importance of avoiding morbid tendencies in the stories for 
children. They must be naive and not sentimental; but mere 
childishness is to be avoided.] 
§ 97. For youth and maidens, especially as they ap- 
proach manhood and womanhood, the cultivation of the 
imagination must yield place and allow the earnestness 
which deals with the actual affairs of the world to mani- 
fest itself in its undisgnised energy. This earnestness, 
no longer through the symbolism of play but in its ob- 
jective reality, must now thoroughly penetrate the con- 
ceptions of the youth so that it shall prepare him to 
seize hold of the machinery of active life. Instead of 
the allembracing Epos, now comes Tragedy, whose 
purifying process, through the feelings of fear and pity, 
unfolds to the youth the secret of all human destiny—sin, 
and its expiation. The works best adapted to lead to 
an interest in history and the affairs of the actual world 
are those of biography—of ancient times, Plutarch; of 
modern times, the autobiographies of Augustine, Cellini, 
Rousseau, Goethe, Varnhagen, Jung-Stilling, Moritz 
Arndt, ete. These autobiographies contain a view of 
the growth of individuality through its interaction with 
the influences of its time, and, together with the letters 
and memoirs of great or at least noteworthy men, tend 
to produce a healthy excitement in the youth, who must
-P-A-G-E-113
88 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
learn to fight his own battles through a knowledge of 
the battles of others. To introduce the youth to a 
knowledge of nature and man no means are better than 
books of travels which describe for us the charm of the 
first interview, the joy of discovery, instead of the gen- 
eral consciousness of the conquests of mind. 
If educative literature on the one hand broadens the field of 
knowledge, on the other it may also promote its elaboration into 
ideal forms. This happens, in a strict sense, through philosophical 
literature. But only two species of this are to be recommended to 
youth: (1) well-written treatises which endeavor to solve a single 
problem with spirit and thoroughness; or, (2) when the intelligence 
has grown strong enough for it, the classical works of a true philoso- 
pher. German literature is fortunately very rich in treatises of this 
kind in the works of Lessing, Herder, Kant, Fichte, Schleiermacher, 
Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Schiller, But nothing does more harm 
to youth than the study of works of mediocrity, or those of a still 
lower rank. They stupefy and narrow the youthful mind by their 
empty, hollow, and constrained style. It is generally supposed that 
these standard works are too difficult, and that one must first seize 
them in a trivial and diluted form in order to understand them. This 
is one of the most prevalent and most dangerous errors, for these 
“introductions” or “ explanations,” “easily comprehended treatises,” 
“summary abstracts,” are, because of their want of originality and 
of the acuteness which belongs to it, much more difficult to under- 
stand than the standard work itself, to which they propose to con- 
duct us. Education must train the youth to the courage which will 
attempt classical works in philosophy, and it must. not allow any suck 
miserable preconceived opinions to grow up in his mind as that his 
understanding is totally unable to comprehend works like Fichte’s 
“Science of Knowledge,” the “ Metaphysics” of Aristotle, or Hegel’s 
“Phenomenology.” No science suffers so much as philosophy from 
this false popular opinion, which understands neither itself nor its 
authority. The youth must learn how to learn to understand, and, 
in order to do this, he must know that one can not immediately un- 
derstand everything in its minutest subdivisions, and that on this ac: 
count he must have-patience, and must resolve to read over and over 
again and to think over what he has read.
-P-A-G-E-114
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, 89 
[Harnestness must predominate over play, as the child ad- 
vances into youth and youth into riper age. Aristotle said that 
tragedy purifies the mind, by fear and pity, from the passions 
depicted in the drama as having tragic results. Certainly in the 
dramas of Sophocles and Aischylus we see presented the great 
problem of a human deed and its reaction on the doer. But 
the Greek consciousness had not arrived at the solution of the 
problem of sin and responsibility which Christian nations now 
accept. CEdipus sins through ignorance but suffers all the same 
as if perfectly enlightened. According to modern ideas of 
justice, involuntary ignorance palliates the crime. The remarks 
on the study of the deepest. and most original works in philoso- 
phy can not be too highly praised. The “courage” which will 
attempt Aristotle, Kant, or Hegel is a rare and valuable disci- 
pline, at least for the sake of what it can do in mastering other 
subjects than philosophy. There is no lesson the student can 
learn so important to him as this: The most difficult of 
writings can be mastered by repeated attacks that: concentrate 
the whole energy on a small portion. Let a student read one 
page of Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason” when his mind is 
fresh, concentrating his full attention upon it. His first read- 
ing will not suffice to give him much insight. But if he repeats 
his reading of this one page every week for six months he will 
discover within himself not only new ideas but new faculties. 
While this progresses he will be delighted to find that other less 
difficult. works, which, however, formerly had required his full 
strength to master, have now become quite easy. It is like sub- 
stituting for the flame of an alcohol-lamp that of an oxy- 
hydrogen blowpipe: the difficulties melt away before his new 
power of analysis disciplined on the dry and abstruse philo- 
sophical work. By this exercise the youth overcomes that worst 
of intellectual obstacles—the belief that what he can not under- 
stand at first trial is permanently beyond his powers:—“ My 
mind was not made for that kind of work.” The motto of the 
school-room should be, “Hach may master the deepest and 
wisest thoughts that the human race has transmitted to us.” 
Repeated attacks by concentrated attention not only master 
the abstruse problem, but leave the mind with a permanent 
acquisition of power of analysis for new problems,—The biog- 
raphies of Plutarch present well-executed pictures of men of

colossal characters placed in difficult situations. Philosophicas 
works, if taken up in later youth, should be classical treatises on 
special problems of thought. Abstracts and summaries are 
generally to be avoided.] 
§ 98. (8) Imagination returns again within itself te 
perception in that it replaces, for conceptions, percep- 
tions themselves, which are to remind it of the previous 
conception [as, for example, imagination calls a crafty 
man a “fox,” and indicates a whole class of men by this 
symbol.” The symbol retains under the new meaning 
also the old meaning]. These perceptions may resemble 
in some way the perception which lies at the basis of 
the conception, and be thus more or less symbolical; or 
they may be merely arbitrary creations of the creative 
imagination, and are in this case pure signs. [When the 
symbolic term loses its old meaning, and retains only its 
new meaning, it becomes a “ pure sign,” and is no longer 
asymbol. Thus, a studious man may be called a “ book- 
worm,” which at first would suggest the mite that de- 
stroys books, but by-and-by loses that suggestion, and 
suggests only the concept of a person devoted to books. 
Thus “book-worm” is first a symbol, and then becomes 
a mere conventional sign of a conception.} In common 
speech and writing, we call the free retaining of these 
perceptions created by imagination, and the recalling of 
the conceptions denoted by them, memory. It is by no 
means a particular faculty of the mind, which is again 
subdivided into memory of persons, names, numbers, 
ete. As to its form, memory is the stage of the disso- 
lution of image-making representation; but, as to its 
content, it arises from the interest which we take in a 
subject-matter. From this interest results careful atten- 
tion, and from this latter, facility in the reproductive
-P-A-G-E-116
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. oY 
imagination. If these acts have preceded, the fixing of 
a name, or of a number, in which the content interesting 
us is, as it were, summed up, is not difficult. When. 
interest and attention animate us, it seems as if we did 
not need to be at all troubled to remember anything. 
All the so-called mnemonic helps only serve to make 
more difficult the act of memory. This act is in itself 
a double function, consisting of, first, the fixing of the 
sign, and second, the fixing of the conception subsumed 
under it. Since the mnemonic technique adds to these 
cne more conception, through whose means the things 
with which we have to deal are to be fixed, it makes the 
function of remembering three-fold, and forgets that 
the connecting link and its relations to the sign and the 
subsumed conception—wholly arbitrary and highly arti- 
ficial—must also be remembered. The true aid for 
memory consists in not helping it at all, but in simply 
taking up the object. into the ideal regions of the mind 
by the force of the infinite self-determination which 
mind possesses [that is to say, the true help consists in 
associating the object with its kindred through ideas of 
species and genera or classes]. 
Lists of names, as e. g., of the Roman emperors, of the popes, of 
the caliphs, of rivers, mountains, authors, cities, etc.; also numbers, 
as, e. g., the multiplication-table, the melting-points of minerals, the 
dates of battles, of births and deaths, etc., must be learned without 
aid. All indirect means only serve to do harm here, and are required 
as self-discovered devices only in case that interest or attention has 
become weakened. 
[Memory. The German word Geddechtniss is contrasted with 
the word Erinnerung ; the former may be translated “ memory,” 
and the latter “recollection ”—recollection, the reproduction of 
the perceived object. in its particular existence, and memory the 
reproduction of it by its general type. With the general type
-P-A-G-E-117
92 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
the mind is able to master the infinite diversity of nature and 
reduce all to a few classes. Mnemonic artifices are to be es- 
chewed. “Memory is the stage of the dissolution of the con- 
ception”; this means that the power of representation becomes 
less and less, a mere recalling of what has been perceived, and, 
as the mind strengthens, it passes over into a faculty which calls 
up universals, or general concepts in the place of particular im- 
ages. Memory, in this technical sense, deals with words—each 
word standing for some universal concept. Language is there- 
fore something that can be used by a whole people—its words, 
standing, as they do, for universals, express for each individual 
the contents of his observations, no matter how peculiar they 
may be. Memory, as thus contradistinguished from mere recol- 
lection, is therefore synthetic, inasmuch as it constructs or puts 
together the essential characteristics of the object in the form 
of a definition and subsumes objects perceived under it. While 
recollection recalls the exact object which it perceived before, 
memory recognizes in the object: before it its class or species, 
and thus recalls and adds to the object the sum total of previous 
experience in regard to this object. (See commentary to § 84 
for further discussion of this. The difference between the mem- 
ory of the scientific man and that of the unscientific is there illus- 
trated.) It must not be understood here that the “definition” 
implied in the “word” is a conscious one. Most of the words 
we use have never been defined consciously, that is to say, we 
have never reflected on the definition; but we carry with us 
an unconscious definition all the same, and, when we identify or 
recognize objects before us, we use the unconscious definition, 
taking notice of the features of the object. one after the other, to 
see whether they correspond to the features which we remember 
as general characteristics of the class. 
How what is symbolic becomes conventional is perhaps the 
most interesting question in the psychology of early education. 
The child passes from the symbolical stage to the conventional 
stage of culture, and enters the stage of “ youth ” in the techni- 
cal sense of the word; as here employed. Conventional studies, 
like the alphabet and orthography, can not be well taken up 
until the child has reached this conventional epoch of growth. 
In the old hieroglyphic system, the letter A represented the face 
of an ox, and was symbolic, Since the Pheenicians transplanted
-P-A-G-E-118
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 93 
the alphabet among other peoples, A has been a conventional 
sign for a particular sound. 
Recollection may be cultivated. A magnet will increase its 
force if a slight increase is made daily to the weight it supports. 
Se the memory of numbers and dates may be indefinitely in- 
creased by committing an additional one or two each day to 
memory, and taking care by frequent reviews that nothing once 
memorized shall escape. But equal care should be taken not to 
overburden the power of recollection by undertaking too many 
new items at atime. Let the student make a special effort with 
precisely the kind of recollection that, he is most deficient in, be 
it names, dates, shapes, or whatever it be, and he will find that, 
by persistent practice for a few months, he can bring the special 
power to the front. The habit of attention to likeness and dif- 
ference, so that the mind at once takes in the species and differ- 
entia involuntarily, is the habit that secures good memory.] 
§ 99. The means to be used (and these are based on 
the nature of memory itself) are, on the one hand, the 
pronouncing and writing of the names or numbers, and, 
on the other, repetition; by the former means we gain 
distinctness and by the latter sureness of memory. 
All artificial contrivances for quickening the memory dwindle in 
comparison with the art of writing, in so far as this is not looked 
upon as @ means of relieving the memory. That a name or a num- 
ber should be this or that, is for the intelligence a mere result of 
chance, an entirely meaningless accident to which we have uncondi- 
tionally to submit ourselves as something not dependent on our wills. 
The intelligence must be accustomed to put upon itself this con- 
straint. In the sciences, especially in philosophy, our reason helps to 
derive one thought from another by means of its dependence on it, 
and we can discover names through this fact of dependence and deri- 
vation. 
(Repetition and the writing down of names and numbers are 
the best means for fixing them in the memory.]

CHAPTER VII. 
INTELLECTUAL EDucation. (a) Psychology (continued), 
(3) The Logical Epoch. 
§ 100. In representation by means of mental im- 
ages there is attained a general idea or a notion in so 
far as the empirical details are referred to a schema, as 
Kant called it. But the necessity of the connection of 
the particular details with the general schema is wanting 
. toit. To develop this idea of necessity is the task of 
the thinking activity, which frees itself from all mental 
pictures, and with its clearly defined determinations 
transcends image-concepts. The thinking activity, there- 
fore, is emancipated from dependence on the senses, to 
ahigher degree than the processes of conception and 
perception. The notion, judgment, and syllogism, de- 
velop forms which, as such, have no power of being 
perceived by the senses. But it does not follow from 
this that he who thinks can not return out of the think- 
ing activity and carry it with him into the sphere of 
image-concepts and perception. The true thinking ac- 
tivity deprives itself of no content. The form of ab- 
_ 8traction affecting a logical purism which looks down 
upon conception and perception as forms of intelligence 
quite inferior to itself is a pseudo-thinking, a morbid 
and scholastic error. Education will be the better on 
its guard against this the more it has led the pupil by 
the legitimate road of perception and conception te 
thinking. Memorizing especially is an excellent pre-
-P-A-G-E-120
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. . 95 
paratory school for the thinking activity, because it 
gives practice to the intelligence in exercising itself in 
abstract ideas. 
[In the general images of the faculty of conception, necessity 
of connection is yet wanting. Thinking, technically so called, 
discovers necessary relations. The logical distinctions are no- 
tions, judgment, syllogism. Within the notion are the ideas of 
universal, particular and individual (or singular), The thinking 
activity “returns” to perception and conception, as illustrated 
in § 84, re-enforcing them. It is important for the teacher to 
be able to recognize the grades of simple perception from those 
grades re-enforced by thought as explained in that section. As 
an example of necessary relations, take the quantitative phases 
of any thing or event. In every triangle the sum of its three 
angles is 180°. Every circumference of a round object is equal 
to the diameter multiplied by 3:14159 +.] 
§ 101. The fostering of the sense of truth, from the 
earliest, years up, is the surest way of leading the pupil 
to gain the power of thinking. The unprejudiced, dis- 
interested yielding to truth, as well as the effort to shun 
all deception and false seeming, is of the greatest value 
in sirengthening the power of reflection, as this consid- 
ers nothing of value but the actually existing objective 
interaction of things and events. 
The indulging of an illusion as a pleasing recreation of the intel- 
ligence should be allowed, while lying must: not be tolerated. Chil- 
dren have a natural inclination for mystifications, for masquerades, 
for raillery, and for theatrical performances, etc. This inclination 
to illusion is perfectly normal with them, and should be permitted. 
The graceful kingdom of art is developed from it, as also the poetry 
of conversation with its jest and wit. Although this sometimes be- 
comes stereotyped into very prosaic conventional forms of: speech, it 
is more tolerable than the awkward honesty which takes everything 
in its simple literal sense. And it is easy to discover whether chil- 
dren in such play, in the activity of free joyousness, incline to the 
side of mischief by their showing a desire of satisfying their selfish 
interest. Then they must be checked, for in that case the sprightli-
-P-A-G-E-121
96 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
uess of harmless joking gives way to gloomy calculation and dissimu- 
lation. 
[A sense of truth should be fostered from childhood up. 
Prejudice and self-interest must be habitually set aside for 
the truth—for the perception of things as they actually are. 
Great care, therefore, must be exercised to prevent an undue 
tendency to illusions (the activity of the productive imagina- 
tion, however essential it may be) from weakening the sense of 
truth.] 
§ 102. An acquaintance with logical forms is to be 
recommended as a special educational help in the cult- 
ure of intelligence. The study of mathematics does 
not suffice, because it, itself, already presupposes logic. 
Mathematics is related to logic in the same way as 
grammar, the physical sciences, ete. The logical forms 
must be known explicitly in their pure independence 
and not merely in their implicit state as immanent in 
objective shapes. 
[An acquaintance with logical forms is important for the 
thorough education of the intellect. Logical forms give the 
archetypes or simplest shapes of all problems that occur else- 
where. Neither mathematics nor any other application of logie 
in the sciences can supply the place of a logical training.]

(b.) The Logical Presupposition, or the Method.

consciousness. The subject, the consciousness of the
-P-A-G-E-122
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, Ut 
pupil, and the activity of the instructor, interpenetrate 
each other in instruction, and constitute in actuality one 
whole. 
[Insiruction presupposes a certain logical order of develop- 
ment in its theme. In arithmetic, for example, fractions must 
not be studied before simple addition. Political geography 
should be studied after mathematical and physical geography ; 
grammar, after reading and writing; general history after the 
history of one’s own country. 
The three elements which instruction combines are: (1) the 
subject to be taught ; (2) the consciousness of the pupil; ey the 
insight and labor of the teacher.] ‘ 
§ 104. (1) First of all, the subject which is to be 
learned has a specific determinateness which demands 
in its exposition a certain fixed order of sequence. 
However arbitrary we may be, the subject has a certain 
determination of its own which no mistreatment can 
wholly crush out, and this inherent immortal rationality , 
ie the general foundation of instruction. 
To illustrate: however one may handle a language in teaching 
it, he can not change the words in it, or the inflections of the declen- 
sions and conjugations. And the same restriction is laid upon our 
inclinations in the different divisions of natural history in the theo- 
rems of arithmetic, geometry, ete. The theorem of Pascal remains 
still the same theorem wherever it is set forth, 
(The subject has a nature of its own which requires it to be 
studied in a certain definite order. Whatever modifications are 
made in the subject to adapt it to the immature mind of the 
pupil, this essential nature of the subject must not be changed. 
As regards the “logical presupposition” above spoken of, it 
is clear enough that all subjects to be taught possess logical. re- 
lations of dependence of one part on another and of the parts 
on the whole, There must be therefore a certain order of ex- 
position of the subject: the dependent parts must be shown in , 
their dependence, otherwise the subject will not be taught ptop- 
erly. We can not teach the zones or parallels and meridians 
unless we have previously taught “he spherical form of tae earth.
-P-A-G-E-123
98 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION, 
Much change and adaptation will be made by the teacher in 
order to make the subject entertaining to his pupil and easy of 
access, but the logical order of dependence of one topic on an- 
other within arithmetic, geometry, natural history, grammar, 
ete,, can not be changed; he must take it as it is, for that is its 
intelligible order and must be followed. The words of the 
classic author must be translated as they stand, and not from 
the end backward, if we would find sense in them.] 
§ 105. (2) But the subject must be adapted to the 
consciousness of the pupil, and here the order of pro- 
cedure and the exposition depend upon the stage which 
he has reached intellectually, for the special manner of 
the instruction must be conditioned by this. If he is in 
the stage of sense-perception, we must use the illustra- 
tive method ; if in the stage of image-conception, that 
of combination ; and if in the stage of thinking, that of 
demonstration. The first exhibits the object directly, 
or some representation of it; the second considers it 
according to the different possibilities which exist in it, 
and turns it around on all sides (and examines its rela- 
tions to other things); the third demonstrates the ne- 
cessity of the relations in which it stands either with it- 
self cr with others. This is the natural order from the 
standpoint of the developing intelligence: first, the ob- 
ject is presented to the perception; then combination 
with other things shows its relations and presents its 
different phases ; and, finally, the thinking activity cir- 
cumscribes the restlessly moving reflection by the idea 
of necessity. Experiment in the method of combina 
tion is an excellent means for a discovery of relations,

  Illustration is especially necessary in the natural sciences and 
also in esthetics, because both of these departments appeal tosense- 
perception, [Omission here of reference to editions of ‘atlases and’: {|} :

(With regard to the second point mentioned aboye—the con- a 
sciousness of the pupil or his grade of advancement, this toc 
must be considered, as well as the logical order of, the develop- 
ment of the subject. Inasmuch as instruction is a leading of ° 
the ignorant into knowledge by translating the unknown into 
the known, there are two factors involved: (a) the unknown 
subject; (b) the stock of knewledge already possessed by the 
pupil, The knowledge already possessed is the means by which 
the unknown can be grasped and retained. All learning is a 
translating of an unknown into a known, just as the learning 
of a foreign language proceeds by translating the unfamiliar 
words into familiar words and thereby changing the strange 
into the familiar. This being so, unless constant reference is 
had by the teacher to the stock of familiar ideas belonging to 
the pupil, there is imminent danger to instruction; it may pass 
off into the process of exchanging unknown words for unknéwn 
words—a movement entirely within the realm of the unfamiliar. 
Such a process is not instruction, whatever else it may be. Thus 
the method of instruction must be largely determined by the 
consciousness (what he knows) or stage of advancement of the 
pupil. If the pupil is young and has few ideas of abstract 
depth, but mostly ideas of objects perceived by the senses, then 
the method must be one of <dustration. It must translate the 
subject into particular objects of sense-perception so far as this 
is possible. If such a process is not possible with a given branch 
of instruction, then that branch must not be taken up now; its 
logical presupposition requires it to be preceded by other 
studies, . 
If the pupil has reached the stage of thinking by means of 
mental images or pictures of the mind (Vorstellungen), then the 
method may be less illustrative and may combine objects and 
symbolize to some extent (as in fairy-stories, or as in any stories 
when the objects used are types of whole classes of objects); 
or, in the stage of reflection there may be demonstration or the 
showing up of logical necessity, or the relations of cause and 
effect. or of power and manifestation, or phar aed logical pre

supposition, or,any logical relation the object may have to other 
objects or tp, thie whole environment in which it is found. 
These thee stages make up the range of the “consciousness” 
of the pupil—he inay be in the (a) first stage, and mere percep- 
tion or beholding of external objects be his chief mental ac- 
tivity, or (b) he may be active in representing objects, that is tc 
say, active, ik his fancy, imagination, or recollections; or (©) ac 
tive in discovering relations between objects, and hence active 
in the-application of such abstract conceptions as identity and 
difference, likeness and unlikeness, force and manifestation, 
whole and parts, cause and effect, thing and properties, etc. 
“Combination,” spoken of in the text, means the considera- 
tion of the various phases and properties of the subject under 
different relations, Jt is necessary to multiply the examples 
and see the object under new combinations in order to discover 
all of the possibilities in it. The individual oak-tree before us 
is only one of infinite possible examples of the oak, and, as 
each actual oak differs from every other in some respect, we 
jearn some new possibility with each new specimen. Thus we 
add or combine by experience the possibilities which together 
make up the nature or entire being of an object. Water is 
easily discovered to have three states—liquid, solid (as ice), and 
aériform (as steam), _ It iz only one of these states at a time, and 
all only in succession. Hence the necessity of “combination” 
or of discovery of different relations or of the behavior of the ob- 
ject under different “combinations” or environments, in order 
to learn its totality of possible being, The idea of necessity ar- 
rives when one has reached a totality of “combination.” This 
may be reached only relatively in the realm of experience; we 
may treat the total of states actually discovered thus far as the 
absolute totality—this we do as a fact in. practical experience, 
e. g., we do not hesitate to treat water as though it had only three 
possible states, liquid, solid, and gaseous, But the true absolute 
necessity comes only from the logical side of presupposition. 
Every fact has a presupposition which is the logical condition 
of its existence. This oak-tree presupposes space and time, and 
could not exist without them. All the properties that follow 
from the nature of space und time may be named as logical con 
ditions absolutely necessary to the existence of the oak-tree. 
“Experiment in the method of combination is an excellent

INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 101 
means for the discovery of relations,” but “it is no true dialec- 
tic,” or, in other words, it does not discover the inward necessity 
which appertains only to the logical presupposition, because the 
dialectical method does not make combinations or experiments 
at hap-hazard, but by careful analysis and observation of the 
object discovers in what manner its essential properties demand 
or presuppose other objects, Given one object, it unfolds the 
system to which it belongs. The dialectic proceeds from the 
part to the whole, following the thread of dependence which 
may be discovered in any object. 
In esthetics, or the science of art (architecture, sculpture, 
painting, and music), illustration is necessary, because presenta~ 
tion to the senses is essential to the nature of art. 
§ 106. The demonstrative method, in order to bring 
about its proof of necessity, has a choice of many differ- 
ent ways. But we must not imagine, either that there 
are an unlimited number, and that it is only a chance 
which one we shall take; or that they have no connec- 
tion among themselves, and run, as it were, side by side. 
It is not, however, the business of pedagogies to develop 
different methods of proof; this belongs to logic. We 
have only to remember that, logically taken, proof must 
be analytic, synthetic, or dialectic. Analysis begins 
with the single individual, and leads out from it by in- 
duction to the general principle from which its exist- 
ence results. Synthesis, on the contrary, begins with a 
general which is presupposed as true, and leads from 
this through deduction to the special determinations 
which were implicit in it. The regressive search of 
analysis for a determining principle is cnvention ; the 
forward progress of synthesis from the simple elements 
seeking for the multiplicity of single individuals is con- 
struction. The former method has been called the heu- 
ristic [from the Greek word for to discover, ebpety]; the

latter, the architectonic. Each, in its result, passes over 
into the other; but their truth is found in the dialectic 
method, which in each phase allows unity (of principle) 
to separate into diversity (of particulars), and diversity 
to return into unity. While in the analytic as well as 
in the synthetic method the mediation of the individual 
with the general, or of the general with the individual, 
brings in the phase of particularity as only subjectively 
connected with it, in the dialectic method we have the 
going over of the general through the particular to the 
individual, or to the self-determination of the idea, and 
it therefore rightly claims the title of the “genetic” 
method. We can also say that while the inventive 
method gives us the idea (notion) and the constructive 
the judgment, the genetic gives us the syllogism which 
leads the determinations of reflection back again into 
substantial identity. 
[The demonstrative method deals with necessary relations, 
and uses the forms of demonstration furnished it by logic, 
namely, analytic, synthetic, or dialectic. Analytic demonstra- 
tion, according to Rosenkranz, begins with some object, as a 
whole, and proceeds to find its derivation or dependence on some- 
thing else, and thus gradually leads out to the idea of that larger 
whole in which the object exists as a part (invention). Synthetic 
demonstration, on the other hand, proceeds from a principle to 
the particular results that follow from it (construction). “ Each 
of these passes over into the other in its result,” i, e., the result 
of analysis is synthesis, because in our analysis of the object we 
discovered dependence and derivation, and hence discovered that 
tt was not a true whole or totality, but involved something else 
—hence we found that the compass of its being was greater than 
we had at first supposed—we have added to it, and our analysis 
proves to have been synthesis rather. 
So, too, synthesis or construction is really an analysis of the 
constituent elements of the principle. By deducing (analyzing} 
what is given us in the principle, we discover the results or spw
-P-A-G-E-128
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 103 
cial characteristics that the principle produces; hence we rise to 
the idea of the total, which includes both the principle and its 
results, and the demonstration involves both analysis and syn- 
thesis. 
The one-sided methods of analysis and synthesis are therefore 
always united in fact, although they seem to be separate when we 
consider them abstractly ; we find them to be dialectic methods, 
therefore, if we look upon both of the phases of their activity. 
In the former (analytic), diversity returns to unity—the sub- 
ordinate unities are traced back to their higher unity, or in the 
latter (synthesis) unity separates into diversity; the higher unity 
gives rise to lower unities. In the analytic method there isa 
“mediation of the individual” object with the general object, 
ie, a tracing of the relations of the individual to other individ- 
uals with which it forms a totality or higher unity. In the syn- 
thetic method there is a “ mediation of the general or total with 
the particular object,” because we see how a force, power, energy, 
or principle develops particular forms. In both of these, when 
considered superficially or inadequately and one-sidedly, there 
is only a subjective connection stated between the particulars 
and the general—“ subjective connection ” meaning a connection 
only in our minds, and not an essential connection which would 
be one existing in the object as areal dependence upon other 
objects. In the dialectic method, or in the method which sees 
both synthesis and analysis in each step, we see in every phase» 
the principle of self-activity, because we see that the subordinate 
objects arise through the energy of the totality, and the energy 
of the totality produces the subordinate phases and unities. All 
totalities must be self-determined or self-active, because they can 
not be at the same time totalities and depend on anything be- 
yond them for their movement or form, This self-active totality 
is called by the Hegelian philosophy (from which Rosenkranz 
borrows it) “the self-determination of the notion (Begriff) or 
idea,” because in that philosophy the technical term for self- 
activity is Begriff (idea or notion), Tnasmuch as it shows self- 
activity as the principle that connects the general with the par- 
ticular, and hence explains all things through evolution, it 
“rightly claims the title of genetic (or development) method.” 
“The inventive or analytic method gives us the idea or notion” 
(Begriff). because it proceeds beyond the particular object to its
-P-A-G-E-129
104 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
genesis in a higher unity whose energy or self-activity has pro 
duced it; it has therefore explained the object through self- 
activity (Begriff), 
“The constructive method (synthetic) gives the judgment 
(Ortheil).” In Hegelian technique, the distinction arising 
through self-activity (distinction into active and passive or actor 
and acted upon) in the notion (Begriff) is called judgment (Ur- 
theil), 
The analytic method leads us back to self-activity (Begriff, 
notion). The synthetic method leads us to distinction of uni- 
versal and individual (Urthed, judgment), The genetic method 
leads us to syllogism (Schluss). In the same system of philoso- 
phy, Schluss, or syllogism, is the technical term for the unity of 
all the phases of self-activity, and includes the universal or self- 
active, and the particular (or distinguished phases of active and 
passive that form an antithesis), and it is the unity of these two, 
or that which is self-identical and self-distinct in one act (just 
as mind or consciousness is subject and object of itself).] 
§ 107. (8) The living mediation of the pupil with 
the content which is to be impressed upon his conscious- 
ness is the work of the teacher, whose personality cre- 
ates an individual or peculiar method; for, however 
clearly the subject may be defined, however exactly the 
psychological stage of the pupil may be regulated, the 
teacher can not do away with his own individuality 
even in the most objective relations. This individuality 
must penetrate the whole with its own exposition, and 
that peculiarity which we call his manner, and which 
ean not be determined @ priori, must appear. The 
teacher must place himself on the standpoint of the pu. 
pil, i. e., he must adapt himself; he must see that the 
abstract is made clear to him in the concrete, i.e., he 
must illustrate; he must fill up the gaps which will cer- 
tainly appear, and which may mar the thorough seizing 
of the subject, i.e., he must supply. In all these rela.
-P-A-G-E-130

tions the pedagogical tact of the teacher may prove it- 
self truly ingenious in varying the method according to 
the changefulness of the ever-varying needs, in contract 
ing or expanding the extent, in omitting or accumulat- 
ing examples, in stating, or only indicating, what is to 
be supplied. The true teacher is free from any super- 
stitious belief in any one procedure as a sure specific 
whieh he follows always in a monotonous bondage. 
This freedom can only be enjoyed by him who is capa- 
ble of the highest method. The teacher has arrived at 
the highest point of ability in teaching when he can 
make use of all means, from the loftiness of solemn 
seriousness, through smooth statement, to the play of 
jest—yes, even to the incentive of irony, and to humor. 
Education can be in nothing more ostentatious than in its 
method, and it is here that charlatanism can most readily intrude 
itself. Every little change, every pitiful modification, is proclaimed 
aloud as a new or an improved method; and even the most foolish 
and superficial changes find at once their imitators, who themselves 
conceal their effrontery behind some trifling differences, and, with 
ridiculous conceit, hail themselves as inventors. 
{The living mediation of the pupil,” etc. “ Mediation” here 
refers to the adjustment and adaptotion of the subjects taught 
to the pupil, so as to suit his intellectual and moral capacity and 
meet his special difficulties. The teacher adopts his own method 
within limits. He finds that his capacity and peculiarities make 
it most convenient to lead the pupil to his task in this way 
rather than in that way. But all teachers must (a) keep in view 
the standpoint of the pupil, (b) use illustration, (c) supply neces- 
sary steps to make the connection clear to the pupil. The live 
teacher is careful to avoid being hampered by the limits of any 
one method, although he finds use for all on occasions.]

§ 108. Art instruction starts from the inequality be 
tween those who possess knowledge and ability and 
those who have not yet obtained them. The former are 
qualified to teach, the latter to learn. Instruction is the 
act which gradually cancels the original inequality of 
teacher and pupil, in that it converts what was at first 
the property of the former into the property of the lat- 
ter by means of his own activity.

and ability, and the other lacking them.] 
(1) The Subjects of Instruction. 
§ 109. The pupil is the apprentice, the teacher the 
master, whether in the practice of any craft or art, or in 
the exposition of any systematic knowledge. The pupil 
passes from the state of the apprentice to that of the 
master through that of the journeyman. The appren- 
tice has to appropriate to himself the elements; jour- 
neymanchip begins, by means of their possession, to be- 
come independent ; the master combines with his tech- 
nical skill the freedom of production. His authority 
over his pupil consists only in his knowledge and ability. 
If he has not these, no external support, no trick of false 
appearances which he may put on, will serve to create 
it for him.
-P-A-G-E-132

[Distinction of three stages: (a) apprenticeship, (2) journey- 
manship, (c) mastership—after the old distinction of degrees of 
perfection in the trades.] 
§ 110. These stages—(1) apprenticeship, (2) journey- 
manship, (3) mastership—are fixed limitations in the di- 
dactic process; but they are relative in the concrete. 
The standard of special excellence varies with the dif- 
ferent grades of culture, and must be varied that it may 
have validity for each period of time. The master is 
complete only in relation to the journeyman and ap- 
prentice; to them he is superior. But, on the other 
hand, in relation to the infinity of the problems of his 
art or science, he is by no means complete; to himself 
he must appear as one who begins ever anew, one who 
is ever striving, one to whom a new problem ever rises 
from every achieved result. He can not discharge him- 
self from work, he must never desire to rest on his 
laurels. He is the truest master whose finished per- 
formances only force him on to never-resting progress. 
[The standard of mastership varies with the demands of the 
age or nation. In judging a particular example, we must always 
take the standard into consideration. The true master always 
regards himself an apprentice before the new problems that step 
forth out of the solution of the old ones.] 
$111. The possibility of culture is found in general, 
it is true, in every human being ; nevertheless, as a prac- 
tical matter, there. are distinguished: (1) incapacity, as 
the want of all gifts; (2) mediocrity; (3) talent and 
genius. It is the part of psychology to give an account 
of all these. Mediocrity characterizes the great mass 
of intelligences that are merely mechanical, and that 
wait for external impulse as to what direction their en- 
deavors shall take. Not without truth, perhaps, may
-P-A-G-E-133
108 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
we hypothetically presuppose a special talent in each 
individual, but this specia] talent in many men never 
makes its appearance, because under the circumstances 
in which it finds itself placed it fails to find the exciting 
occasion which shall give them the knowledge of its ex- 
‘istence. The majority of mankind are contented with 
the mechanical impulse which makes them into some- 
thing, and impresses upon them certain characteristics. 
Talent shows itself by means of the confidence in its 
own especial productive possibility, which manifests it- 
self as an inclination, or as a strong impulse, to oceupy 
itself with the special object which constitutes the ob- 
ject of its ability. Education has no difficulty in dealing 
with mechanical natures, because their passivity is only 
too ready to follow prescribed patterns. It is more dif- 
ficult to manage talent, because it lies between medioc- 
rity and genius, and is therefore uncertain, and not only 
unequal td itself, but also is tossed now too low, now 
too high, is by turns despondent and over-excited. The 
general maxim for dealing with it is to spare it no diffi- 
culty that lies in the subject to which its efforts are di- 
rected. Genius must be treated much in the same way 
as talent. The difference consists only in this, that 
genius, with a premonition of its creative power, usually 
manifests its decision with less doubt for a special prov- 
ince of activity, and, with a more intense thirst for cult- 
ure, subjects itself more willingly to the demands of 
instruction. Genius is in its nature the purest self-de- 
termination, in that it feels, in its own inner existence, 
the necessity which exists in the object to which it de- 
votes itself; it lives, as it were, in its object. But it 
can create no valid place for the new idea, which is in it

already immediately and subjectively, if it has not united 
itself to the already existing culture as its objective pre- 
supposition ; on this ground it thankfully receives in- 
struction. 
[Abstractly speaking, each human being has the possibility in ' 
him of every talent that has appeared or will appear in the 
human race. “But, practically, there is immense difference in 
the facility with which individuals can realize this possibility. 
Hence we have the scale: (1) incapacity (pure dunce); (2) medi- 
ocrity (mechanical intelligence, who can do the average task as 
others do); (8) the talent and genius who have great self-activity. 
The talent has an inclination to his vocation, but is not perfectly 
clear as to all of the means that lead to it; does not value indus- 
try as much as he ought. or despises the methods discovered be- 
fore him. The genius is clear as to methods—sees all that has 
been as tools and materials out of which to build his ideals—and 
therefore works with a passion.] 
§ 112. But talent and genius offer a special difficulty 
to education in the precocity which often accompanies 
them. But by precocity we do not mean that they 
early render themselves perceptible, since the early 
manifestation of gifts by talent and genius, through 
their intensity of decision and self-confidence, is to be 
looked at as perfectly legitimate. But precocity is 
rather the hastening forward of the human being in 
feeling and moral sense, so that, where in the ordinary 
course of nature we should have a child, we have a 
youth, and a man in the place of a youth. We may 
therefore find precocity among those who belong to the 
class of mediocrity, but it is developed most readily 
among those possessed of talent and genius, because 
with them the early appearance of superior gifts may 
very easily bring in its train a derangement of the feel- 
ings and the moral nature. Education must deal with

it in so far as it is inharmonious, and reminds us of the 
pourri avant @étre muri, and see to it strictly that 
the demands made on it from without shall not minister 
to vanity; and must take care, in order to accomplish 
this, that social naturalness and lack of affectation be 
preserved in the pupil. 
: Our age has to combat this precocity much more than others. 
We find, e. g., authors, who, at the age of thirty years, in which they 
_ publish their collected works or write their biography, are chilly 
-with the feelings of old age. . . . Music has been the sphere in which 
the earliest. development of talent has shown itself, and here we find 
the absurdity that the cupidity of parents has so forced early talents 
that children of four or five years of age have been made to appear 
in public. 
[Precocity defined: not intense self-confidence, but the omis- 
sion of some natural stage of development. Education must 
take care that its vanity is not encouraged, and do all in its 
power to prevent affectation and self-consciousness, which de- 
stroy the proper relation of the pupil to his fellows.] 
$113. Every sphere of culture contains a certain 
quantity of knowledge and ready skill which may be 
looked at, as it were, as the created result of the cult- 
ure. It is desirable that every one who turns his atten- 
tion to a certain line of culture should take up into him- 
self the traditional learning which controls it. In so far 
as he does this, he is professionally educated. The con- 
sciousness that one has in the usual way gone through a 
school of art or science, and has been made familiar with 
the general inheritance of the acquisitions of a special 
department, creates externally a salutary composure 
which is very favorable to internal progress. We must 
distinguish from the professionally educated the dilettant 
and the self-taught man. The dilettant or amateur busies 
himself with an art, a science, or a trade, from free incli-
-P-A-G-E-136
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 111 
nation, without having gone through any strict training 
in it. Asa rule, he dispenses with elementary thorough- 
ness, and hastens toward the enjoyment which produc- 
tion gives. The conscious amateur confesses this him- 
self, makes no pretension to mastership, and calls him- 
self—in distinction from the professional, who subjects 
himself to rules—a tyro. But the self-deluded dilet- 
tant, on the contrary, conceals his weakness, cherishes in 
himself the self-conceit that he is equal to the heroes of 
his art or science, constitutes himself the first admirer 
of his own performances, explains their want of suc- 
cess by accidental circumstances, never by their own 
want of excellence; and, if he has money, or edits a 
paper, is intoxicated with being the patron of talent 
which produces such works as he would willingly pro- 
duce or pretends to produce. The self-taught man 
has often true talent, or even genius, to whose develop- 
ment nevertheless the inherited culture has been denied, 
and who by good fortune has through his own strength 
worked his way into a field of effort. The self-taught 
man is distinguished from the amateur by the thorough- 
ness and the industry with which he acts: he is not 
only equally unfortunate with him in the absence of 
school-training, but is much less assisted by advice of 
the competent. Even if the self-taught man has for 
years studied and practiced much, he is still haunted by 
a feeling of uncertainty as to whether he has yet reached 
the standpoint at which a science, an art, or a trade, 
will receive him publicly. It is of very great conse- 
guence that man should be comprehended and recog: 
nized by man. The self-taught man, therefore, remains 
embarrassed, and does not free himself from the appre- 
rs
-P-A-G-E-137
112 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
hension that he may expose some weak point to a pro- 
fessional, or he falls into the other extreme—he be- 
comes presumptuous, steps forth as a reformer, and, if 
he accomplishes nothing, or earns only ridicule, he sets 
himself down as a martyr unrecognized by an unap- 
preciative and unjust world. 
It is possible that the dilettant may get beyond the stage of su- 
perficiality and subject himself to a thorough training ; then he ceases 
to be a dilettant. It is also possible that the self-taught man may be 
on the right track, and may accomplish as much as, or even more than, 
one trained in the usual way. In general, however, it is very desir- 
able that every one should go through the regular course of the in- 
herited means of education, partly that he may be thorough in the 
elements, partly to free him from the anxiety which he may feel lest: 
he in his solitary efforts spend labor on some superfluous work—su- 
perfluous because done long before, and of which he, through the ac- 
cident of his want of culture, had not heard. We must all learn by 
ourselves, but we can not feach ourselves. Only genius can do this, 
for it must be its own leader in the-new paths which it opens. Gen- 
ius alone passes beyond where inherited culture ceases. It bears 
this in itself as of the past, and uses it as material for its new crea- 
tion; but the self-taught man, who may possibly be a genius, wastes 
his time in doing things already accomplished, or sinks into eccen- 
tricity, into secret arts and sciences, etc. 
[The professionally educated, the dilettant or amateur, and 
the self-taught. (a) The professionally educated masters thor- 
oughly what the experience of the race has transmitted to his 
own specialty, and hence Increases his own stature by standing 
on the shoulders of the human race. (b) The dilettant wishes 
to eat of the kernel without breaking the shell, and is a sort of 
futile individual who amuses himself by producing what is good 
for nothing when produced, (c) The self-taught man works 
with great industry and thoroughness, but has not access to the 
best means, i. ¢., the traditional culture of the race as taught in 
the schools. He works under embarrassment, haunted with the 
feeling that the professionally educated see defects in his train- 
ing, or, throwing off his embarrassment, he plays the réle of 
“reformer,” and becomes imbittered against the world.]

$114. These ideas of the general steps of culture, of 
special gifts, and of the ways of culture appropriate to 
each, which we have set forth above, have a manifold 
connection with each other which can not be established 
apriort. We can, however, remark that apprenticeship, 
the mechanical intelligence and the professional educa- 
tion; secondly, journeymanship, talent, and dilettante 
ism ; and, finally, mastership, genius, and self-education, 
have a relationship to each other.

§ 115. In the process of instruction the interaction 
between pupil and teacher must be so managed that the 
exposition by the teacher shall excite in the pupil the im- 
pulse to reproduction. The teacher must not treat his 
exposition as if it were a work of art which is its own 
end and aim, but he must always bear in mind the need 
of the pupil. The artistic exposition, as such, will, by 
its completeness, produce admiration ; but the didactic, 
on the contrary, will, through its perfect adaptation, 
call out the imitative instinct, the power of new creation. 
From this consideration we may justify the frequent statement 
that is made, that teachers who have an elegant diction do not really

accomplish so much as others who resemble in their statements less 
a canal flowing smoothly between straight banks than a river which 
works its foaming way over rocks and between ever-shifting banks. 
The pupil’ perceives that the first is considering himself when he 
speaks so finely, perhaps not. without some coquettish self-compla- 
cency; and that the second, in the repetitions and the sentences 
which are never finished, is concerning himself solely with him. The 
pupil feels that not want of facility or awkwardness, but the holy 
zéal of the éeacher, is the principal thing, and that this latter uses 
rhetoric only as a means, 
[The teacher should expound the subject in such a way as to 
arouse in the pupil an impulse to reproduce it. It differs in 
this respect from a work of art, which seeks only complete pres- 
entation and the appearance of self-existence, The pupil sees in 
the elegant diction of one teacher a studied attempt to win ad- 
miration for himself, while in the inelegant repetitions and un- 
finished sentences of another teacher he feels the genuine and 
exclusive interest manifested in his own progress.] 
§ 116. In the act of learning there appears (a) a me- 
chanical element, (6) a dynamic element, and (¢) one in 
which the dynamic again mechanically strengthens it- 
self, 
[The process of learning involves (2) a mechanical element, 
(#) a dynamic element; (¢) a dynamic element re-enforced by 
the mechanical element (i. ¢., dynamic attention re-enforced by 
mechanic regularity, punctuality, and system, so as to constitute 
andustry).] 
§ 117. (@ The mechanical element consists in this, 
that the right time be chosen for each lesson, an exact 
arrangement observed, and the suitable apparatus, which 
is necessary, procured. It is in the arrangement that 
especially consists the educational power of the lesson. 
The spirit of scrupulousness, of accuracy, of neatness, is 
developed by the external technique, which, however, 
should be subordinated to the interests of the subject 
studied. The teacher must, therefore, insist upon it

that work shall cease at the exact time, that the work be 
well done, etc., for on these little things many greater 
things, in an ethical sense, depend. 
To choose one’s time for any work is often difficult because of 
the pressure of a multitude of demands, but in general it should be 
determined that the work requiring the strongest and keenest energy 
of the thinking activity and of memory should have appropriated to 
it the first half of the day, 
[The mechanical element consists in (1) right time (punctu- 
ality); (2) exact arrangement (regularity); (8) neatness and ac- 
curacy (system). These constitute the mechanical morals of the 
school-room, and furnish a sort of training in self-control and 
obedience to rule that forms the basis of all more spiritual mo- 
rality. , Attention to these punctilios often seems a waste of ener- 
gy; but it tells on the moral character as nothing else does, and 
makes his future life far more successful. The importance of 
choosing the morning hours for studies requiring hardest think- 
ing or greatest strain on the memory.] 
§ 118. (6) The dynamical element (i, ¢., the self-ac- 
tivity of the pupil) consists of the previously developed 
power of attention, without which all the exposition 
made by the teacher to the pupil remains entirely for- 
eign to him. All apparatus is dead, all arrangement of 
no avail, all teaching fruitless, if the pupil does not by 
his free self-activity receive into his inner self what one 
teaches him, and thus make it his own property. 
[The dynamical element is the activity of the pupil’s will 
directed on the intellect; its general form being attention (see 
§§ 82, 83). It is the door that opens the mind of the pupil—the 
mechanical element relates to externals, the dynamical to the 
internal, the self-activity of the pupil.] 
§ 119. This appropriation must not limit itself, how- 
ever, to the first acquisition of any knowledge or skill, 
but it must give perfect command over whatever the 
pupil has learned; it must make it perfectly familiar

and natural, so that it shall appear to be a part of him. 
self. This must be brought about by means of repe- 
tition. This will mechanically secure that which the 
attention first grasped. 
[Besides attention, there must be repetition—frequent reviews 
—in order to transmute the new knowledge and skill into per- 
manent possession (“into faculty,” as Herbert Spencer says). 
Repetition corresponds to habit in will-training, and is itself 
mechanical—hence with it the dynamical is re-enforced by the 
mechanical, and the best name for the union of the two is 
industry.| 
§ 120. (ec) The careful, persistent, living activity of 
the pupil in these acts we call industry. Its negative 
opposite is laziness, which is deserving of punishment 
inasmuch as it proceeds from a want of self-determina- 
tion. Man is by nature lazy. But mind, which is only 
what it does, must resolve upon activity. This connec- 
tion of industry with human freedom, with the very 
essence of mind, makes laziness appear blameworthy. 
The really civilized man, therefore, no longer knows 
that absolute inaction which is the greatest enjoyment 
to the barbarian, and he fills up his leisure with a variety 
of easier and lighter work. The positive opposite of 
industry is the unreasonable activity which rushes in 
breathless chase from one action to another, from this 
to that, over-tasking the person with the immense quan- 
tity of his work. Such an activity, seldom directed 
with proper deliberation, is unworthy of a man. It de- 
stroys the serenity and repose which in all industry 
should penetrate and inspire the deed. Nothing is more 
repulsive than the beggarly pride of such stupid labo- 
riousness. One should not permit for a moment the 
pupil, seeking for distinction, to begin to pride himself
-P-A-G-E-142
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, 11% 
on an extra industry. Education must accustom him to 
use a regular diligence. The frame.of mind suitable for 
work often does not exist at the time when work should 
begin, but more frequently it makes its appearance after 
we have begun. The subject takes its own time to 
awaken us. Industry, inspired by a love and regard for 
work, has in its quiet uniformity a great force, without 
which no one can accomplish anything essential. The 
world, therefore, holds industry worthy of honor; and 
to the Romans, a nation of the most enduring persever- 
ance, we owe the inspiring words, “ Zncepto tantum 
opus est, cetera res expediet” ; and, “ Labor improbus 
omnia vincit.” Unilinching labor conquers everything. 
“Hivery one may glory in his industry!” This is a true word 
from the lips of a truly industrious man, who was also one of the 
most modest. But Lessing did not, however, mean by them to char- 
ter Pharisaical pedantry. The necessity sometimes of giving one’s 
self to an excess of work injurious to the health generally arises 
from the fact that he has not at other times made use of the requi- 
site attention and the necessary industry, and then attempts suddenly 
and as by a forced march to storm his way to his goal. The result 
of such over-exertion is naturally entire prostration, The pupil is, 
therefore, to be accustomed to a generally uniform industry, which 
may increase from time to time without his thereby overstraining 
himself. What is really gained by a youth who has hitherto neg- 
lected time and opportunity, and who, when examination presses, 
overworks himself, perhaps standing the test with honor, and then 
must rest for months afterward from the over-effort? On all such 
occasions attention is not objective and dispassionate, but rather be- 
comes, through anxiety to pass the examination, restless and cor- 
rupted by egotism; and the usual evil result of such compulsory ine 
dustry is the ephemeral character of the knowledge thus gained, 
* Lightly come, lightly go,” says the proverb, 
A special worth is always attached to study far into the night, 
The student's “ midnight oil” always claims for itself a certain ven- 
eration. But this isa sad vanity. In the first place, it is injurious 
10
-P-A-G-E-143
118 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
to contradict Nature by working through the night, which she has 
ordained for sleep; secondly, the question is not as to the number of 
hours spent in work and their position in the twenty-four, but as to 
the quality of the work. With regard to the value of my work, it is 
of no moment whatsoever whether I have done it in the morning or 
in the evening, or how long I have labored, and it is of no conse- 
quence to any one except to my own very unimportant self. Finally, 
the question presents itself whether these gentlemen who boast so 
much of their midnight work do not sleep in the daytime! 
{Industry defined as the vital, cireumspect, persistent activity 
of the pupil. Its opposite is laziness, which deserves corrective 
punishment. Man by nature is lazy. Since mind develops into 
existence only through self-activity, industry is a fundamental 
virtue because through it alone can spiritual growth take place. 
Spiritual growth produces freedom, i. e., emancipation from the 
limitations of time and space, giving man possession of the past 
and present within himself and in his environment, however 
distant. The savage loves intervals of absolute inaction; the 
civilized man hates torpidity, but rests himself by change of 
work, He supplements his vocation by avocations. Industry 
has besides its negative opposite a positive opposite which is 
over-haste and over-exertion.} 
§ 121. But industry has also two other opposites— 
seeming-laziness and seeming-industry. Seeming-lazi- 
ness is the neglecting of the usual activity in one de- 
partment by the individual because he is so much more 
active in another. The mind possessed with the liveliest 
interest in one subject buries itself in it, and, because of 
this, can not give itself up to another which before had 
engrossed the attention. ‘I'hus it appears more idle than 
it is, or rather it appears to be idle just because it is 
more industrious. This is especially the case in passing 
from one subject of instruction to another. The pupil 
should acquire such a flexibility in his intellectual pow- 
ers that the rapid relinquishment of one subject and the 
taking up of another should not be too difficult. “Noth
-P-A-G-E-144
  INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 119 
ing is more natural than that when he has become thor 
oughly aroused on one subject he should, on going back 
to the subject that has just been presented to him, feel 
himself still attracted to the former, and remain indif- 
ferent to the following lesson, which may relate to an 
entirely different topic. The young soul is brooding 
over what has been said, and is really exercising an in- 
tense activity, though it appears to be idle. But in 
seeming-industry all the external motions of activity, 
all the mechanism of work, manifest themselves noisily, 
while there is no true energy of attention and produc- 
tivity. One busies himself with all the apparatus of 
work; he heaps up instruments and books around him 3 
he sketches plans; he spends many hours staring into 
vacancy, biting his pen, gazing at words, drawings, num- 
bers, etc. Boys, under the protection of so great a scaf- 
folding for work erected around them, often carry on 
their own amusements. Men, who arrive at no real 
concentration of their force, no ciear defining of their 
vocation, no firm decision as to their action, dissipate 
their power in what is too often a great activity with 
absolutely no result. They are busy, very busy; they 
have hardly time to do this thing because they really 
wish or ought to do that; but, with all their driving, 
their energy is all dissipated, and nothing comes from 
their countless labors. 
[Industry is opposed to (1) seeming-laziness, which neglects 
some things to attend to others which are considered more impor- 
tant; all specialization is of this character. (2) It is opposed 
likewise to seeming-industry, which goes through all the mo- 
tions of industry in a noisy and ostentatious manner, but is in- 
ternally idle. Importance of disciplining the mind to tura 
completely from one subject to another.]

§ 122. Now that we have learned something of the 
relation of the teacher to the taught, and of the process 
of learning itself, we must examine the mode and man- 
ner of instruction. This may have (/) the character of 
contingency : the way in which our immediate existence 
in the world, our life, teaches us; or it may be given 
(2) by the printed page; or (3) it may take the shape 
of formal oral instruction.

the instruction is given, hence its form or method. Instruction

page; (8) oral.] : 
§ 123. (2) For the most, the best, and the mightiest 
things that we know we are indebted to life itself. 
The sum of perceptions which a human being makes 
for himself up to the fourth or fifth year of his life is 
incalculable; and after this time we continue involun- 
tarily to gain by immediate contact with the world 
countless ideas. But we understand,.by the phrase “the 
school of life,” especially the ethical knowledge which 
we gain by what happens in our own lives. 
If one may say, Vile non schole discendum est, one can also say, 
Vita docet. Without the power exercised by the immediate world 
our intelligence would remain abstract and lifeless, 
[Instruction by experience begins with infancy and con- 
tinues through life. Especially in the first four or five years 
the sum of perceptions from this source is enormous, What

tue child learns of the ways of life, manners, and customs, and 
moral principles; proper habits of eating and drinking, care of 
the person and clothing, forms to be observed toward the various 
ranks in the family and society; glimpses of the action of the 
law of the state, its resistless might, its punishment of crime; 
numerous observations on the division of labor and its sustenta- 
tion by trade and commerce; the daily and weekly spectacle of 
the rites and ceremonies of religion: here is the education of 
life through the four institutions of civilization—family, civil 
community, state, and church. The education that one gets 
by adopting a trade or form of industry and earning his living, 
or by acting as a citizen, obeying the laws and assisting at the 
ballot-box to make them, or in the army risking one’s life to 
defend them—each of these is a peculiar form of the education 
that life offers, and its results can not be obtained through any 
other form—certainly not by the school—however much the 
school may re-enforce them.] 
§ 124. (2) What we learn through books forms a 
contrast to that which we learn through living. Life 
forces upon. us its wisdom ; the book, on the contrary, is 
entirely passive. It is locked up in itself; it can not be 
altered; but it waits by us till we wish to use it. We 
can read it rapidly or slowly ; we can simply turn over 
its leaves—what in modern times one calls reading— 
we can read it from beginning to end or from end to be- 
ginning; we can stop, begin again, skip over passages, 
or cut them short, as we like. To this extent the book is 
the most convenient means for instruction. If we are in- 
debted to life for cur perceptions, we must chiefly thank 
books for our understanding of our perceptions. We 
call book-instruction “dead” when it lacks, for the 
exposition which it gives, a foundation in illustration 
addressed to sense-perception, or when we do not add to 
the printed description the perceptions which it implies; 
and these two are quite different.
-P-A-G-E-147
122 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION, 
{Instruction through books is in some respects the opposite 
of instruction through: living, because life forces its wisdom on 
us, while the book is entirely passive. The book is the most con- 
venient form of instruction. We must have gained by experi- 
ence from real life a sort of alphabet or key, with which we may 
spell out or unlock the meaning of the wisdom stored up in 
books. Unless we can translate what the book says into elements 
of our own experience, it is dead to us.] 
§ 125. Books, as well as life, teach us many things 
which we did not previously expect to learn directly from 
them. From the romances of Walter Scott, for example, 
we learn, first of all, while we read them for entertain- 
ment, the English language, and English and Scotch 
history and geography. . . . We must distinguish from 
such books as those which bring to us, as it were acci- 
dentally, a knowledge for which we were not seeking, 
the books which are expressly intended to instruct. 
These “text-books” must (@) in their consideration of 
the subject give. us the principal results of any depart- 
ment of knowledge, and denote the points from which 
the next advance must be made, because every science 
comes to results which are themselves again new prob- 
lems; (6) in the consideration of the particulars they 
must be exhaustive, i. ¢., no essential elements of a sci- 
ence must be omitted. But this exhaustiveness of exe- 
eution has different meanings according to the stand- 
points of those for whom it is made. How far we shall 
pass from the universality of the principal determina- 
tions into the multiplicity of the particular, into the 
fullness of detail, can not be definitely determined, and 
must vary, according to the aim of the book, whether 
for the apprentice, the journeyman, or the master ; (¢) 
the expression must be precise, i. e., the maximum of
-P-A-G-E-148
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. . 123 
clearness must be combined with the maximum of 
brevity. 
The writing of a text-book is on this account one of the most 
difficult tasks, and it can be successfully accomplished only by those 
who are masters in a science or art, and who combine with great 
culture and talent great experience as teachers. Unfortunately, 
many masters of science hold in low esteem the writing of text- 
books because they think that they are called upon to devote them- 
selves entirely to the spread of science, and because the writing of 
compendiums has come to be in bad repute through the fact that 
authors and publishers have made out of text-books a profitable busi- 
ness and good incomes. In all sciences and arts there exists a quan- 
tity of material which is common property, which is disposed of now 
in one way, now in another. Hence the majority of compendiums 
ean be distinguished from each other only by the kind of paper, 
printing, the name of the publisher or bookseller, or by arbitrary 
changes in the arrangement and execution. The want of principle 
with which this work is. sometimes carried on is incredible. Many 
governments have on this account fixed prices for text-books, and 
commissioners to select them, This in itself is right and proper, but 
the use of any such book should be left optional, so as to avoid the 
one-sidedness of a science patronized by government and as it were 
licensed or introduced by law. A state may through its censorship 
oppose poor text-books, and recommend good ones for introduction ; 
but it may not... establish as it were a national system of sci- 
ence or of art, in which only the ideas, laws, and forms sanctioned by 
it shall be allowed. The Germans are fortunate, in consequence of 
their philosophical criticism, in the production of better and better 
text-books. .. . So much the more unaccountable is it that, with 
such excellent books, the evil of such characterless books, some of 
them defectively, some of them atrociously written, should still exist 
when there is no necessity for it. The good old fashion of paragraph- 
writing has become obnoxious, under the name of compendium-style, 
as the most stiff and affected style of writing. 
[The recorded wisdom of the entire human race is preserved 
in books, and hence the chief province of the school is to endow 
the pupil with the power to use books profitably through life so 
that he may perpetually draw from that reservoir of wisdom, 
and re-enforce and interpret his own life. A “text-book” (a)

it must use clear and precise language, and be brief. Govern- 
ment prescription of text-books.} 
§ 126. A text-book must be differently written ac- 
cording as it is intended as a book for private study or 
to be accompanied by oral explanation. If the former, 
it must go more into details, and must develop more 
clearly the internal relations; if the second, it should 
be shorter, and proceed from axiomatic and clear postu- 
lates to hints and suggestions that must have an epi- 
grammatic keenness which should leave something to be 
guessed. Because for these a commentary is expected 
which it is the teacher’s duty to supply, such a sketch is 
usually accompanied by the fuller text-book which was 
arranged for private study. [Illustrations here omitted.] 
[Text-books (a) for private study; (b) for use in school.} 
§ 127. (3) The text-book which presupposes oral ex- 
planation forms the transition to oral instruction itself. 
Since speech is the natural and original form in which 
mind manifests itself, no book can rival it. The living 
word is the most powerful agent of instruction. How- 
ever common and cheap the art of printing may have 
rendered books as the most convenient means of educa- 
tion—however the multiplication of facilities for inter- 
course and the increasing rapidity of transportation may 
have facilitated the immediate viewing of human life as 
' the most impressive educational means—nevertheless 
the living word still asserts its value. In two cases es- 
pecially it is indispensable: one is when some knowl- 
edge is to be communicated which is in process of dis-
-P-A-G-E-150
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 125 
covery and as yet is found in no compendium ; and the 
other when a living language is to be taught, for in this 
case the printed page is entirely inadequate. One can 
learn from books to understand Spanish, French, Eng- 
lish, Danish, ete., but not to speak them; to do this he 
must hear them, partly that his ear may become accus- 
tomed to the sounds, partly that his vocal organs may 
learn correctly to imitate them. 
[Oral instruction. The living word is the most powerful 
agent of instruction, and hence can produce effects where other 
means are inadequate. The latest discoveries, the commentary 
on the book, as well as the pronunciation of foreign languages 
—tor these things oral instruction is indispensable.] 
§ 128. Life surprises and overpowers us with the 
knowledge which it offers; the book, impassive, waits 
our convenience ; the teacher, superior to us, perfectly 
prepared in comparison with us, consults our necessity, 
and with his living speech uses a gentle force to which 
we can yield without losing our freedom. Listening is 
easier than reading. 
Princes seldom read themselves, but have servants who read to 
them, 
[Although oral instruction is the most powerful means of 
arousing and interesting the pupil, yet its object should be to 
emancipate the pupil from the need of it, and (a) make him in- 
terested in knowledge for itself, so that he will eagerly follow it 
through the (2) text-book, (2) reference-book, and (8) library ; 
(é) seek to master the material poured in upon him by experi- 
ence of life.] 
§ 129. Oral instruction may (J) give the subject, 
which is to be learned, in a connected statement, or (2) 
it may develop it by means of question and answer. 
The first method is called the acroamatic, the second 
the erotematic. The first (the acroamatic or lecture.

126 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
system) presupposes the theoretical inequality 
teacher and the taught. Because one can spea! 
many listen, this is especially adapted to the instruction| 
of large numbers. The second method (the erotematic) 
is either that of the catechism or the dialogue. The 
catechetical is connected with the first kind of oral in- 
struction above designated because it makes demand 
upon the memory only for what is already le: 
is very often and very absurdly called the 
method. In the dialogue, we try, by means 
terchange of thought, to investigate in com 
others some problem, proceeding according to the neces 
sary forms of reason. But in this we e: . ~

The system of alternate teaching, in which the pupil takes the 
teacher’s place and instructs others, can be used only where the sub- 
ject taught admits of a mechanical treatment. The Hindoos made 
use of it in very ancient times, Bell and Lancaster + have trans. 
planted it for the teaching of poor children in Europe and America. 
For the teaching of the elementary accomplishments—reading, writ- 
ing, and arithmetic—as well as for the learning by heart of names

INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION, 127 
sentences, etc., it suffices, but not for any scientific culture. Where 
we have large numbers to instruct, the giving of the fully developed 
statement (the acroamatic method) is necessary, since the dialogue, 
though it may be elsewhere suitable, allows only a few to take part 
in it. And, if we take the interrogative (erotematic), we must, if we 
have a large number of pupils, make use of the catechetical method 
only. What is known as the conversational method has been some- 
times suggested for our university instruction. Diesterweg, in Ber- 
lin, insists upon it. Here and there the attempt has been made, but 
without any result. In the university, the lecture of the teacher as 
a self-developing whole stands in contrast with the scientific discus- 
sion of the students by themselves, in which they as equals work 
over with perfect freedom what they have heard. Diesterweg was 
wrong in considering the lecture-system as the principal cause of the 
lack of scientific interest which he thought he perceived in our uni- 
versities. Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Schleiermacher, Wolf, Niebuhr, 
etc., taught by lectures and awakened the liveliest enthusiasm. But 
Diesterweg is quite right in saying that the students should not be 
degraded into writing-machines. This is generally conceded, and 
a pedantic amount of copying more and more begins to be con- 
sidered as out of date at our universities, Nevertheless, a new ped- 
antry, that of the mere lecture, should not be introduced ; but a brief 
summary of the lecture may be dictated and answer all purposes, or 
the lecture may be afterward written out by the pupil from memory. 
The great efficacy of the oral exposition does not so much consist in 
the fact that it is perfectly free, as that it presents to immediate view 
a person who has made himself the bearer of a science or an art, and 
has found what constitutes its essence. Its power springs, above all, 
from the solidity of the lecture, the originality of its content, and 
the elegance of its form; whether it is read or declaimed is a matter 
of little moment. Niebuhr, e. g., read, word for word, from his 
manuscript, and what a teacher was he! The catechetical way of 
teaching is not demanded at the university except in special exami- 
nations; it belongs to the private work of the students, who must 
jearn to be industrious of their own free impulse. The private tutor 
can best conduct reviews. The institution which presupposing the 
lecture-system combines in itself original production with criticism, 
and the connected exposition with the conversation, is the profes- 
sional school. It pursues a well-defined path, and confines itself to 
small classes of scholars whose grades of culture are very nearly the

same. Here, therefore, the dialogue can be developed with best effect 
because it has a fixed foundation, and each one can take part in the 
conversation ; whereas, from the variety of opinions in a large elass, 
it is easily perverted into an aimless talk, and the majority, having 
no chance to speak, become weary. 
[Oral instruction of two kinds: (1) the lecture, acroamatic, and 
(2) erotematic, or the form of catechism and dialogue. (Acroa- 
matic, from axpodouo, the Greek verb for to hear lectures, was 
applied to Aristotle’s oral lectures, which were given to a few

the exoteric, or outer, doctrines. Erotematic, from épwrdew, the 
Greek verb to ask, means the interrogative method.)] 
§ 180. As to the way in which the lecture is carried 
out, it may be arranged for those who have undertaken 
the entire course of instruction in its thorough, system- 
atic form, or for those who have in view only a gen- 
eral, inexact education, without intending to go through 
the complete course. The ancients called the first 
method the esoteric and the second the exoteric, as we 
give to such lectures now, respectively, the names scho- 
lastic and popular. The first makes use of terms which 
have become technical in science or art, and proceeds tc 
combine the isolated ideas in a strict, logical manner ; 
the second endeavors to substitute for technicalities gen- 
erally understood designations, and conceals the exact- 
ness of the formal conclusion by means of a style of 
narration. It is possible to conceive of a perfectly me- 
thodical treatment of a science which at the same time 
shall be generally comprehensible if it strives to attain 
the transparency of rea! beauty. A scientific work of 
art may be correctly said to be popular, as, e. g., has 
happened to Herder’s “Ideas toward a Philosophy of 
the History of Mankind.”
-P-A-G-E-154
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 429 
Beauty is the element which is comprehended by all, and as we 
declare our enmity to caricatures in picture-books and books of amuse- 
ment, and to the mischievous character of “ compendiums,” so we must 
also oppose the popular publications which style themselves “ Science 
made easy,” etc., in order to attract more purchasers by this alluring 
title... . Kant says: “In the effort to produce in our knowledge the 
completeness of scholarly thoroughness, and at the same time a pop- 
ular character, without in the effort falling into the errors of an af- 
fected thoroughness or an affected popularity, we must, first of all, 
look out for the scholarly completeness of our scientific Inowledge, 
the methodical form of thoroughness, and first ask how we can make 
really popular the knowledge methodically acquired at school, i e., 
how we can make it easy and generally communicable, and yet at the 
same time not supplant thoroughness by popularity. For scholarly 
completeness must, not be sacrificed to popularity to please the peo- 
ple, unless science is to become a plaything or a trifling.” It is per- 
fectly plain that all that has been said above (S§ 81-107) on the psy- 
chological and the logical methods must be taken into account in the 
style of the exposition in the two kinds of oral method, 
{Technical and popular lectures.] 
$131. It has been already remarked (§ 21), in speak- 
ing of the nature of education, that the office of the in- 
structor must necessarily vary with the growing culture. 
But attention must here again be called to the fact that 
education, in whatever stage of culture, must conform 
to the law which, as the internal logie of being, deter- 
mines all objective developments of Nature and of his- 
tory. The family gives the child his first instruction ; 
between this and the school comes the teaching of the 
tutor; the school stands by itself over against the fam- 
ily, and presents three essentially different forms accord- 
ing as (1) it imparts a general preparatory instruction, 
or (2) special teaching for different callings, or (8) a 
universal scientific cultivation. Universality and par- 
ticularity are united in individuality, which therefore 
contains both the general and the particular freely in

itself. All citizens of a state should have (1) a general 
education which (a) makes them familiar with reading, 
writing, and arithmetic, these being the means of all 
theoretical culture; then (6) hands over to them a pict- 
ure of the world in its principal phases, so that they as 
citizens of the world can direct their course on our 
planet; and, finally, it must (c) instruct each in the his- 
tory of his own state, so that he may see that the cir- 
cumstances in which he lives are the result of special 
circumstances in the past in their connection with the 
history of the rest of the world, and so may learn rightly 
to estimate the interests of his own country in view of 
their necessary relation to the future. This work the 
elementary schools have to perform. From this through 
the Realschule (our scientific course in the high-school] 
they pass into the school where some particular branch 
of art is taught, or through the Gymnasium (classical 
course of a high-school or college] to the university. 
Upon the general basis of university training develop 
(2) the educational institutions that aim at some special 
education which leads to the exercise of some art. 
These we call technological schools, where one may 
learn farming, mining, a craft, a trade, navigation, war, 
ete. This kind of education may be specialized indefi- 
nitely with the growth of culture, because any one 
branch is capable in its negative aspect of such division 
into special schools, as, e. g., foundling hospitals and or- 
phan asylums, blind, and deaf and dumb, institutions. 
The abstract universality of the elementary (common) 
school and the one-sided particularity of the technologi- 
cal school, however, unite in a sort of concrete univer- 
sality as a ground that includes both, which, without

aiming directly at utility, treat science and art on all 
sides as their own end and aim (and constitutes what 
is called the scientific spirit). “Scientia est potentia,” 
said Lord Bacon. Practical utility results indirectly 
through the progress which scientific cognition makes 
in this free attitude toward the world, because it collects 
itself and avoids dissipation through manifold details by 
seizing the idea of the whole and getting insight into 
the details by that means. This organic whole of in- 
struction is properly called a university. By it the edu- 
cational system is perfected. 
It is important to note that no more than these three types of 
schools can exist, and that they must all exist in a perfectly organ- 
ized civilization. Their titles and their plans and arrangements may 
be very different among different nations at different epochs, but 
this need not prevent the recognition in them of the three essential 
logical phases—universal, particular, singular—on which they are 
founded, Still less should the imperfect ways in which they mani- 
fest themselves induce us to condemn them. It is the modern tend- 
ency to undervalue the university as an institution which we had 
inherited from the middle ages, and with which we could at present 
dispense. This isan error. The university presents just as meces- 
sary a form of instruction as the elementary school or the techno- 
logical school. Not the abolition of the university, but a reform 
which shall adapt it to the spirit cf the age, is the advance which 
we have to make.* That there are to be found, outside of the 
university, men of the most thorough and elegant culture, who can 
give the most excellent instruction in a science or an art, is most cer- 
tain, But it is a characteristic of the university in its teaching to do 
away with the dependence on hap-hazard and mere luck which is un- 
avoidable in case of private voluntary efforts. The university offers 
to the student an organic, self-conscious, encyclopedic representation 
of all the sciences, and thus it creates to a greater or less degree an 
intellectual atmosphere which no other place can give. Through 
this, all sciences and their aims are seen in their just claims for con-

sideration, and a personal stress is laid upon the connection of one 
science with another. The imperfections of a university, which arise 
through the rivalry of external ambition, through the necessity of 
financial success, through scholarships, etc., are finite affairs which 
it has in common with all human institutions, and on whose account 
they are not all to be thrown away. Art-academies are for art what 
universities are for science. They are inferior to them in so far as 
they appear more under the form of special schools, as schools of ar- 
chitecture, of painting, and conservatories of music; because it must 
be granted that architecture, sculpture, painting, music, the orches- 
tra, and the drama, are, like the sciences, bound together in a w7t- 
versitas artium, and that by means of their internal reciprocal action 
new results would follow. Academies of art, as isolated schools for 
masters, which have no teaching properly so called, ar: 
pensable, and serve only as a pryfaneum for meritorio| 
and to reward industry through the prizes which the: 
their idea they belong with the university, this appearin; 
in the fact that most of their members are university pro:' 
as institutions for ostentation by which the ambition of the learned 
was flattered, and princes surrounded with a halo of : 
scientific corporations attached to courts, they have la 
nificance. They flourished with the Ptolemies and the 
caliphs, and with absolute monarchical governments, ) 
times we have passed beyond the abstract jealousy between the so- 
called “humanities” and the natural sciences, because we compre- 
hend that each part of the totality can be realized in a | 
only by its development as relatively independent. Th. 
nasium has its place as that elementary school which, be 
@ general culture, by means of the knowledge of the 1: 
history of the Greeks and Romans, prepares for the 
while, on the other hand, the Realschule, by special atte: 
ural science and the living languages, furnishes the required prepa- 
ration to the technological schools. Nevertheless, because the uni- 
versity embraces the science of Nature, of technology, of trade, of 
finance, and of statistics, the pupils who have graduated from the 
so-called high-schools (Aéhern Biirgerschulen) and from the Real- 
schulen will also be brought together at the university with the 
graduates of the Gymnasia.

§ 132. The organization of the school will be deter- 
mined in its details by its peculiar aim. But in general 
every school, no matter what it teaches, ought to have 
some system of rules and regulations by which the rela- 
tion of the pupils to the institution, to each other, to the 
teacher, and that of one teacher to another, as well as to 
the supervisory authority, the programme of lessons, the 
apparatus, the changes of work and recreation, shall be 
clearly set forth. The course of study must be arranged 
so as to avoid two extremes: on the one hand, it has to 
keep in view the special aim of the school, and according 
to this it tends to contract itself. But, on the other hand, 
it must consider the relative dependence of’ one spe- 
cialty upon other specialties and upon general culture. 
Tt must leave the transition free, and in this it tends to 
expand itself. Experience alone is competent so to 
assign the limits that the special task of the school shall 
neither be sacrificed nor deprived of the means of per- 
formance which it (since it is also always only a part of 
the whole culture) receives by means of its reciprocal 
action with other departments. The programme must 
assign the exact amount of time which can be appro- 
priated to each study. It must prescribe the order in 
which they shall follow cach other; it must, as far as 
11
-P-A-G-E-159
184 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
possible, unite kindred subjects, so as to avoid the use- 
less repetition which dulls the charm of study; it must, 
in determining the order, bear in mind at the same time 
the necessity imposed by the subject itself and the psy- 
chological progression of intelligence from perception, 
through conception, to the thinking activity which 
grasps all. It must be periodically submitted to revis- 
ion, so that all matter which has, through the changed. 
state of general culture, become out of date, may be re- 
jected, and that which has proved itself indispensable 
may be appropriated, so that it may be kept up to the 
requirements of the times. And, finally, the school 
must, by examinations and reports, aid the pupil in the 
acquirement of a knowledge of his real standing. The 
examination lets him know what he has really learned, 
and what he is able to do: the report shows him a his- 
tory of his culture, exhibits to him in what he has made 
improvement and in what he has fallen behind, what 
defects he has shown, what talents he has displayed, 
what errors committed, and in what relation stands his 
theoretical development to his ethical status. 
The struggle between the Gymnasia and the industrial interests 
of the community is a very interesting phase of educational history. 
They were asked to widen their course so as to embrace mathe- 
matics, physics, natural history, geography, and the modern lan- 
guages. At first they stoutly resisted; then they made some 
concessions; finally, the further they went the more they found 
themselves in contradiction with their true work, and so they pro- 
duced, as an independent correlate, the Realschule. After this was 
founded, the Gymnasium returned to its old plan, and is now again 
-able to place in the foreground the pursuit of classical literature and 
history. It was thus set free from demands made upon it which 
were entirely foreign to its nature.—The examination is, on its peda- 
gogic side, so adapted to the pupil as to make him conscious of his
-P-A-G-E-160
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 185 
own condition. As to its external side, it determines whether the 
pupil shall pass from one class to another or from one school to an- 
other, or it decides whether the school as a whole shall display its 
results to the public—an exhibition which ought to have no trace of 
ustentation, but which, as a matter of fact, is often tinctured with 
pedagogical charlatanism. 
[The rules and regulations of the school. The course of study, 
limited by the aim of the school, but, on account of the depend- 
ence of one specialty upon all the rest, must include some gen- 
eral outline of the whole that will indicate the position and scope 
of the specialty. The programme defines the amount of time 
given to each study, and the order of their sequence, It must 
conform to the laws of logical arrangement of topic, and of psy- 
chological development of the pupil. Examinations and reports 
aid the pupil by showing him where his work is successful and 
where defective.] 
§ 183. The direction of the school on the side of 
science must be held by the school itself, for the pro- 
cess of the intellect in acquiring science, the progress of 
the method, the peculiarities of the subject-matter and 
the order of its development, have their own laws, to 
which instruction must submit itself if it would attain 
itsend. The school is, however, only one part of the 
whole of culture. In itself it divides into numerous de- 
partments, together constituting a great organism which 
in manifold ways comes into contact with the other 
organisms of the state. So long as teaching is of a 
private character, so long as it is the reciprocal relation 
of one individual to another, or so long as it is shut up 
within the circle of the family and belongs to it alone, 
so long it has no objective character. It receives this 
first when it grows to a school. Historically speaking, 
the school first appears as an auxiliary of the church; 
but this first form, in time, disappears. “Religion is the 
absolute relation of man to God which subsumes all
-P-A-G-E-161
186 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
other relations. In so far as religion exists in the 
form of a church, those who are members of the same 
church may have common instruction given them on 
the nature of religion. Instruction on the subject is 
proper, and it is even enjoined upon them as a law—as 
a duty. But beyond the limits of their own society 
they may not extend their sway. The church may ex- 
ert itself to make a religious spirit felt in the school 
and to make it penetrate all the teaching; but it may 
not presume, because it has for its subject the absolute 
interest of men, the interest which is superior to all 
others, to determine also the other objects of education 
or the method of treating them. The technical aequi- 
sitions of reading, writing, and arithmetic, drawing and 
music, the natural sciences, mathematics, logic, anthro- 
pology and psychology, the practical sciences of finance 
and the municipal regulations, have no direc’ * 
to religion. If we attempt to establish one, 
evitably appears in them a morbid state whicl:

accomplishments and branches of knowledge ae sue su- 
cluded in its province. 
Such treatment of art and science may be well-meant, but it is 
always an error. It may even make a ludicrous impression, which 
is a very dangerous thing for the authority of religion. If a church 
has founded a system of schools, it must see to it that all which is 
there taught except the religious instruction, i. e., all of science and 
art, shall have no direct connection with it as a religiov~ *~***~**

§ 134. The church, as the external manifestation of 
religion, is concerned with the absolute relation of man 
to God, which, however, is special in itself as opposed 
to man’s other relations; the state, on the contrary, 
seizes the life of a nation according to its eziplicit 
totality. The state should conduct the education of ali 
its citizens. To it, then, the church must appear only 
as a school, for the church instructs its own people con- 
cerning the nature of religion, partly by teaching proper 
(that of the catechism), partly in an edifying way, by 
preaching. From this point of view, the state can look 
upon the church only as standing side by side in the 
same rank with those schools which prepare for a 
special vocation. The church appears to the state as 
that school which assumes the task of educating the re- 
ligious faculty. Just as little as the church should the 
state attempt to exercise any influence over the essential 
matters of science and art. In this they are exactly 
alike, and must acknowledge the necessity which both 
science and art contain within themselves and by which 
they develop their contents. The laws of logic, mathe- 
matics, astronomy, morals, sesthetics, physiology, etc., 
are entirely independent of the state. It can decree 
neither discoveries nor inventions. The state occupies 
the same ground as science, both presupposing the free- 
dom of self-consciousness. It is true that the church 
teaches man, but it demands from him at the same time 
belief in the truth of its dogmas. It rests, as the actnal 
ehurch, on presupposed authority, and sinks finally all 
contradictions which arise in experience in the absolute 
mystery of the existence of God. The state, on the 
contrary, elaborates its idea into the form of laws, i. e.,
-P-A-G-E-163
138 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
into general determinations, of whose necessity it con- 
vinces itself. It seeks to give to these laws the clearest 
possible form, so that every one may understand them. 
It concedes validity only to that which can be proved, 
and sentences the individual according to the external 
side of the deed (“overt act”), not, as the church does, on 
its internal side—that of disposition (the state of the 
heart). Finally, it demands in him consciousness of 
his deed, because it makes each one responsible for his 
own deed. It has, therefore, the same principle as 
science, for the proof of necessity and the unity of 
consciousness with its object constitute the essence of 
science. Since the state includes the school as one of 
its educational instrumentalities, it is from its very 
nature called upon to guide its regulation in accordance 
with the principles that govern the unfolding of con- 
sciousness. 
The church calls this “ profanation.” One might say that the 
church, in the absolute mystery which is the object of its faith, al- 
ways represents the absolute problem for science, while the state, as 
to its form, coincides with science. Whenever the state abandons 
strictness of proof—when it begins to measure the individual citizen 
by his disposition and not by his deed, and, in place of the clear in- 
sight of the rational self-consciousness, sets up the psychological 
compulsion of a hollow mechanical authority, it destroys itself. 
[* The state seizes the life of a people in its explicit totality,” 
ive, all human relations, and hence must conduct the education 
of its citizens. To the state the church is not the institution, 
but one of several co-ordinate institutions. The state should 
not dictate in matters of science and art, nor in matters of con- 
science. The state and science are alike in presupposing the free- 
dom of self-consciousress; the state in making the individual 
responsible for his deed requires consciousness and freedom as 
conditions of conviction in case of crime; science presupposes 
freedom of thought, freedom from authority, and clear insight
-P-A-G-E-164
INTELLECTUAL EDUCATION. 189 
into the necessity of the demonstration, i. e., clear consciousness, 
The church, however, does not relinquish the demand for au- 
thority.] 
§ 185. Neither the church nor the state should at- 
tempt to control the school in its internal management. 
Still less can the school constitute itsclf into a state 
within the state; for, while it is only one of the tem- 
porary means which are necessary for developing citi- 
zens, the state and the church lay claim to the whole 
man his whole life long. The independence of the 
school can then only consist in this, that a directory is 
created within the state which takes the schools under 
its control, and which as a school board endeavors to 
provide for the needs of the school, while externally 
it adjusts them to the church and state with the other 
ethical powers. The emancipation of the school can 
never reasonably mean its abstract isolation, or the ab- 
sorption of the ecclesiastical and political life into the 
school ; it can signify only the free reciprocal action of 
the school with state and church. It must never be for- 
gotten that what makes the school a school is not the 
total process of education, for this falls also within the 
family, the state, and the church; but that the proper 
work of the school is the process of instruction, by which 
the pupils shall gain knowledge, and the acquirement of 
accomplishments by practice. 
The confusion of the idea of instruction with that of education 
in general is a common defect in superficial treatises on these themes. 
The radicals, among those who are in favor of so-called “ emancipa- 
tion,” often erroneously appeal to “ free Greece,” which generally for 
this fond ignorance is made to stand as authority for a thousand 
things of which it never dreamed. In this fictitious Hellas of “free 
beautiful humanity,” they say the limits against which we strive to- 
day did not exist. The biographies of Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Di-
-P-A-G-E-165
140 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
agoras, Socrates, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and of others, who were 
condemned on account of their “impiety ” (0éeia), tell quite another 
story. 
{Limitations of church and state in their control over the 
school—school independent in the control of its internal man- 
agement. “ Emancipation of the school,” in 1848, a great politi- 
cal watchword. Edueation (Erziehung) distinguished from in- 
struetion (Unterricht).] 
§ 186. The inspection of the school may be carried 
out in different ways, but it must be required that its 
special institutions shall be included and cared for as an 
organized and interrelated whole, framed in accordance 
with the idea of the state, and that one division of the 
ministry shall occupy itself exclusively with it. The 
division of labor will specially affect the schools for 
teaching particular vocations. The prescription of the 
subjects to be studied in each school as appropriate to it, 
of the course of study, and of the object thereof, prop- 
erly falls to this department of government (the school 
board), is its immediate work, and its theory must be 
changed according to the progress and needs of the 
time. . . . Sketches of plans for school systems, how- 
ever correct they may be, depend upon the actual sum 
of culture of a people and a time, and must therefore 
continually modify their fundamental ideal. The same 
is true of the methods of instruction in the special arts 
and sciences. Niemeyer, Schwarz, Herbart, in their 
sketches of pedagogics, Beneke in his “Theory of Edu- 
cation,” and others, have set forth in detail the method 
of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic, languages, 
natural science, geography, history, ete. Such directions 
are, however, ephemeral in value, and only relatively 
useful, and must, in order to be truly practical, be often

CHAPTER XII. 
PRAGMATICS (EDUCATION OF THE WILL). 
§ 187. Born physical and intellectual education are 
in the highest degree practical. The first reduces the 
merely natural (i.e., the body) to a tool which mind 
shall use for its own ends; the second guides the intelli- 
gence, by ways conformable to its nature, to the neces- 
sary method of the art of teaching and learning, which 
finally branches out in the nation into a system of mu- 
tually dependent school organizations. But in a nar- 
rower sense we mean by practical education the method- 
ical development of the will. This phrase more clearly 
expresses, the topic to be considered in this division 
than another sometimes used in the science of education 
(Bestrebungsvermigen, conative power). The will is 
already the subject of a science of its own, i.e., of 
ethics; and if the science of education would proceed 
in anywise scientifically, it must recognize and presup- 
pose the idea and the existence of this science. It should

  “THE SPEC ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
not restate in fuil the doctrines of freedom, of duty, of 
virtue, and of conscience, although we have often seen 
this done in works on education. Education has to deal 
with the ideas of freedom and morality only so far as to 
_ fix the technique of their process, and at the same time 
to confess itself weakest just here, where nothing is of 
any worth without pure self-determination. 
[The special elements of education are: A. Physical Education ; 
B. Intellectual Education; C. Pragmatics, or Education of the 
Will. “Practical” refers to the will-power. The complete 
science of the will is called Ethics. Education borrows the 
conclusions of that science and restates them only in outline.] 
§ 138. The pupil must (1) become civilized ; i.e., he 
must learn to govern, as a thing external to him, his 
natural egotism, and to make the forms which civilized 
society has adopted his own. (2) He must become im- 
bued with morality; i.e, he must learn to determine 
his actions, not only with reference to what is agreeable 
and useful, but according to the principle of the good ; 
he must become internally free, form a character, and 
must habitually look upon the necessity of freedom as 
the absolute measure of his actions. (8) He must be- 
come religious; i.e., he must discern that the world, 
with all its changes, himself included, is only phenom- 
enal; the affirmative side of this insight into the empti- 
ness of the finite and transitory (which man would so 
willingly make everlasting) is the consciousness of the 
Absolute existing in and for itself. The Absolute, with- 
out change and entirely unaffected by the process of 
manifestation, constitutes no factor of its changes, but, 
while it actually makes them its object, permeates them 
all, and freely distinguishes itself from them. In so far 
as man relates himself to God, he cancels al) finitude

and transitoriness, and by this feeling frees himself from 
the externality of phenomena. Virtue on the side of 
civilization is politeness; on that of morality, consci- 
entiousness; and on that of religion, humility. 
[The youth must (1) become civilized; (2) acquire a moral 
will; (8) become religious. Civilized man subordinates his ani- 
mal selfishness and wears the forms of society as though they 
were his nature. Morality subjects all motives to one supreme 
motive, the principle of the good. Religion sees the world and 
all its phenomena, including the “ deeds done in the body,” to be 
mere transient appearances, while, on the other hand, in God it 
contemplates absolute existence above the realm of change and 
decay. 
Three stages of virtue: (a) politeness the virtue of civiliza- 
tion; (b) conscientiousness the virtue of morality; (c) humility 
the virtue of religion. Humility is the virtue named in the 
Beatitudes as possessed by “the poor in spirit,” the “poverty” 
wedded by St. Francis (Dante's Paradiso, canto xi, 58).]

EDUCATION OF THE WILL (continued). 
(@) Social Culture. 
§ 189. Tux social development of man constitutes 
the beginning of practical education. It is not neces- 
sary to suppose a special social instinct. The inclination 
of man to the society of men does not arise from the 
identity of their nature alone, but is also in each special 
instance affected by particular relations. The natural 
starting-point of social culture is the family. But this 
in turn educates the child for society, and by means of
-P-A-G-E-169
{A4 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION, 
society the individual enters into relation with the worlé 
at large. Thus natural sympathy changes to polite be- 
havior, and the latter again to the thrifty and cireum- 
spect deportment, whose proper ideal nevertheless is 
before all the ethical purity which combines with the 
wisdom of the serpent the harmlessness of the dove. 
[The beginning of all education of the will is to be found in 
social manners and customs. This is given in the family, where 
the child learns the manifold forms of behavior toward others, 
his equals, inferiors, and superiors.] 
§ 140. (1) The family is the natural social circle to 
which man primarily belongs. In it all the immediate 
differences which exist are compensated by ™ 
immediate unity of the relationship. The 
tion of the wife to the husband, of the chil¢ 
parents, of the younger children to their eld 
and sisters, ceases to be subordination, thro: 
timacy of love. The child learns obedience » 
while it satisfies its parents and finds its oi 
tion in their approval. All the relations | 
finds himself within the family are penetr 
warmth of implicit confidence, which can 
for the child by nothing else. In this sacrei 
tenderest emotions of the heart are devel« 
personal interest of all its members in what oppo. wo 
any one of their number, and thus the found’ ~ 
laid of a susceptibility to all genuine or hearty 
intercourse. 
Nothing more unreasonable or inhuman could exist than those 
modern theories (of French socialists) which would « 
family and would leave the children, the offspring of th 
natural instinct, to grow up in public nurseries. This aj _ 
very bunene to them; indeed, these socialists talk of nothing but
-P-A-G-E-170
IN EEE EEE ly EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 145 
the interests of “humanity ”—they are never weary of uttering their 
insipid jests on the institution of the family, as if it were the prin- 
ciple of all narrow-mindedness. Have these fanatics, who are seek- 
ing after an abstraction of humanity, ever examined our foundling- 
hospitals, orphan asylums, barracks, and prisons, to discover in some 
degree to what an atomic barren intelligence a human being de- 
velops who has never formed a part of a family? The family is, of 
course, only one phase in the grand order of the ethical organization ; 
but it is the substantial phase from which man passively proceeds, 
but into which, as he founds a family of his own, he actively returns. 
The child lives in the family, shares the common joy and grief, and 
feels sympathy with all. In the emotion with which he sees his 
parents approach death while he is hastening toward the full enjoy- 
ment of existence, he experiences the finer feelings which are so 
powerful in creating in him a deeper and more tender understand- 
ing of everything human, . . . 
[The family is the natural social cirele—its association does not 
depend on free choice, but on the natural accident of birth, All 
the differences of rank, all subordination and inferiority, are at 
once compensated by the natural intimacy of kinship and family 
love. Each one feels his unity of substance with the other mem- 
bers of the family, and hence suffers in their sorrow and rejoices 
in their happiness. Hence, obedience to the authority of the 
parents is tendered by the child with an intensé feeling of grati- 
fication at winning their approval. This development of living 
for others and through others in the family lays the foundation 
of social intercourse.] 
§ 141. (2) The family, however, educates the chil- 
dren not for itself but for civil society. In the latter a 
system of manners and customs is formed which fur- 
nishes a social formula or fixed code of etiquette to 
determine the behavior of the individual in society. 
This social code endeavors to subdue the natural rough. 
ness of man,'at least as far as it manifests itself exter- 
nally. Because he is a spiritual being, man is not to 
yield himself to his immediate impulses; he is to ex- 
hibit to man his naturalness as under the control of
-P-A-G-E-171
146 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
spirit. The etiquette of propriety on the one hand 
facilitates the manifestation of individuality by means 
of which one person becomes interesting to others, inas- 
much as it encourages free expression of individual dif- 
ferences, and, on the other hand, since its forms are 
alike for all, it makes them recognize the equality of 
each individual with all others, and so makes their inter- 
course easier. 
The conventional form is no mere constraint ; but essentially a 
protection not only for the freedom of the individual, but much 
more the protection of the individual against the rude impetuosity 
of his own naturalness, Savages and peasants for this reason are, in 
their relations to each other, by no meaus as unconstrained as one 
often represents them, but hold closely to a ceremonious behavior. 
There is in one of Immerman’s stories, “The Village Justice,” a 
very excellent picture of the conventional forms with which the 
peasant loves to surround himself. The scene in which the towns- 
man, who thinks that he can dispense with forms among the peasants, 
is very entertainingly taught better, is exceedingly vatuable in an 
educational point of view. The feeling of shame which man has in 
regard to his mere naturalness is often extended to relations where 
it has no direct significance, when this sense of shame is appealed to 
in children in reference to things which are really perfectly indiffer- 
snt externalities, 
[The object of the social code is to subdue the natural rude- 
ness that belongs to man as a mere animal, and thus clothe the 
brutal with a garb of unselfish forms. The essence of politeness 
consists in treating others as if they were perfectly ideal people. 
The polite person utterly ignores all rudeness shown him, and 
treats others as if they intended the same politeness toward him. 
He prefers others before himself, and adopts as @ second nature 
the form of divine charity or “altruism,” which devotes itself to 
the good of others. Politeness is only the form of this altruism; 
morality and religion are the substance of it. Since the form of 
politeness is the same for all—the same for the king as for the 
beggar—it follows that politeness is the ceremonial form by 
which we celebrate the equality of all men in the substance x
-P-A-G-E-172
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 14% 
their humanity. “All are equal before God”; and also before 
the ideal of politeness, This, as Rosenkranz says, makes social 
intercourse easier,] 
§ 142. Education with regard to social culture has 
swo extremes to avoid: the youth may, in his effort to 
grove his individuality, become vain and conceited, and 
fall into a sort of mania for attracting the attention of 
others; or he may become slavishly dependent on con- 
ventional forms, a kind of social pedant. This state of 
aullity which contents itself with the mechanical polish 
of social formalism is ethically more dangerous than the 
tendency to a marked individuality, for it betrays empti- 
ness; while the effort toward a peculiar differentiation 
from others, and the desire to become interesting to 
others, indicate power. 
[Two extremes of social culture to be avoided: (1) accentua~ 
tion of individuality by deviations from the code of politeness to 
such a degree as to become a mania for attracting attention; 
(2) slavish dependence on the conventional forms to such an ex~- 
tent as to appear constrained and pedantic. The latter indicates 
weakness of individuality, the former strength.} 
§ 143. When we have a harmony of the manifesta- 
tion of the individual with the expression of the recog- 
nition of the equality of others, we have what is called 
proper deportment or politeness, which combines dig- 
nity and grace, self-respect and modesty. We call it, 
when fully complete, urbanity. It treats the conven- 
tional forms with irony, since, at the same time that it 
yields to them, it allows the productivity of spirit to 
shine through them in small deviations from them, as if 
it were fully able to make others in their place. 
True politeness shows that it remains master of forms, It is 
very necessary to accustom children to courtesy and to bring them 
up in the etiquette of the prevailing social custom; but they must
-P-A-G-E-173
148 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION, 
be prevented from falling into silly formality which makes the 
highest perfection of polite behavior to consist in a blind following 
of the dictates of the last fashion-journal, and in the exact copying 
of the phraseology and directions of some book on manners. One 
can best teach and practice politeness when he does not merely copy 
the social technique, but comprehends its original idea. . . . 
[Urbanity the name for perfect politeness{Notice that ur- 
banity is from urbs, the Latin for city, while politeness is from 
the same root as polish—as if social culture were born in cities, 
where the constant intercourse of people polishes by giving a 
code of manners.) Urbanity “treats the conventional forms of 
politeness with irony,” i.e., it lets it be apparent that it does not 
practice the strict forms of etiquette mechanically, but merely 
submits to them outwardly, while within it feels a much more 
tender and hearty respect for others than is or can be expressed 
by those stiff, conventional forms. It therefore “makes small 
deviation from them” in the direction of greater familiarity 
and friendliness, showing that it possesses the substance of 
politeness in its devotion to the good of others, and that it can 
therefore invent new forms of etiquette. Within the family 
there reigns the unconstrained expression of devotion to others 
—in polite society, the conventional forms of considerateness 
for others’ welfare—in its perfect form of urbanity, a sort of 
shining through of the family love.] 
§ 144. (3) But to fully initiate the youth into the 
institutions of civilization one must not only call out 
the feelings of his heart in the bosom of the family, not 
only give to him the formal refinement necessary to his 
intercourse with society ; it must also perform the pain- 
ful duty of making him acquainted with the mysteries 
of the ways of the world. This duty is painful, because 
the child naturally feels an unlimited confidence in all 
men. This confidence must be modified and restricted 
but not destroyed. The mystery of the way of the 
world is the practice of deception which originates in| 
selfishness. We must provide against it by a proper
-P-A-G-E-174
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 149 
degree of distrust. We must teach the youth that he 
may be imposed upon by cunning, dissimulation, and 
hypocrisy, and that therefore he must not give his con- 
fidence lightly and credulously. He himself must learn 
how he can, without using deceit, gain his own ends in 
the midst of the throng of opposing interests. 
Kant in his pedagogics calls that worldly-wise behavior, by which 
the individual is to demean himself in opposition to others, impene- 
trability. By its means man learns how to “manage men.” Egotism 
is like the blast of a simoom in its withering effects on the moral 
character when it is practiced as Lord Chesterfield recommends it in 
his letters to his son. . . . The sum of his teachings amounts to this, 
that we are to consider every man to be an egotist, and to convert 
his very egotism into a means of finding out his weak side, i. e., to 
flatter him by exciting his vanity, and by means of such flattery to 
ascertain his limits, In common life, the expression “to know the 
world” means about the same thing as having been deceived and 
betrayed. 
[Social culture has also a negative duty—that of forewarning 
youth against the selfishness of the world and its forms of 
deceit and violence. Cunning, dissimulation, and hypocrisy, 
may impose on the youth. He must be on his guard.]} 
CHAPTER XIV. 
EDUCATION OF THE WILL (continued). 
(6) Moral Culture. 
§ 145. Tux essential element of social culture is 
found in moral character. Without this latter, every - 
graceful device of behavior remains worthless, and can 
never attain that purity of humility and dignity which
-P-A-G-E-175
150 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
are possible to it in its unity with morality. For the 
detailed treatment of this idea the science of education 
oust refer to ethics itself, and can here give the part of 
its content which relates to education only in the fi 
of educational maxims. The principal categories 
ethics in the domain of morality are the ideas of duc, yy 
virtue, and conscience. Education must lay ‘ 
the truth that nothing in the world has an 
value except will guided by the right. 
[Morality is a department of Ethics in the system here fol- 
lowed. Ethics includes manners and customs, forms of eti- 
quette, statute laws, forms of government, the organized forms 
of human industry and the like as well as morality, which is 
only the subjective aspect of Ethics. Ethics relates, therefore, to 
the whole of the formal part of life that fits man to live in the 
institutions of civilization. Morality refers to the individual 
conviction of duty—hence, to the internal ideal, the form of the 
perfect man. The principal categories of Morality are (1) Duty ; 
(2) Virtue; (8) Conscience. “Nothing in the world has an abso- 
lute value except will guided by the right,” Rosenkranz says, 
“except the pure will.” Jn his philosophy “pure will” means 
the will as self-related. When I guide my action by moral’ law 
I guide my will by my will instead of letting external circum- 
stances or internal impulses guide it. The will acting 
will is pure will, and this is the essence of moralit: 
morality is the form of will or that general form + 
which will not contradict itself and reduce to zero, 
acts injure one’s self and society, and, if persisted in, + =. 
mately cripple or destroy the self and society, and thus cancel the 
will itself. Hence, the pure will is the form in which the will 
of the individual re-enforces the will of society, and is in turn 
re-enforced by it.] 
§ 146. Thence follows (1) the maxim relating tc 
idea of duty, that we must accustom the pupil to ux- 
conditional obedience to it, so that he shall ; * 7 
for no other reason than that it is duty. Thi
-P-A-G-E-176
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 151 
ance of a duty may bring with it externally a result 
agreeable or disagreeable, useful or harmful; but the 
consideration of such consequences ought never to de- 
termine us. This moral demand, though it may appear 
to be excessive severity, is the absolute foundation of 
all genuine ethical practice. All “highest happiness ” 
theories, however finely spun they may be, when taken 
as a guide for life, lead at last to sophistry, and to con- 
traditions rninons to life. 
[The pupil must be accustomed to unconditional obedience 
to duty. Eudemonism, or the doctrine that we should seek the 
highest happiness, is not a sufficient theory, because it implies 
that the individual shall weigh the consequences of his deed. 
But no individual can weigh the consequences of his puniest 
act,] 
§ 147. (2) Virtue must make actual what duty com- 
mands, or, rather, the actualizing of duty is virtue. And 
here we may mention, by way of caption, that the prin- 
cipal things to be considered under virtue are («) the 
dialectic of particular virtues, (@) moral discipline, and - 
(©) character. 
[Virtue, ‘which is the practice of actualizing duty, involves 
three things: (@) the dialectic of the different forms of virtue; 
(6) moral discipline ; (¢) character as the result.] 
§ 148. (a) From the dialectic [i. e., the consideration 
of the interdependence of the virtues and their mutual 
support, as well as their reciprocal limitation] of particu- 
lar virtues there follows the educational maxim that we 
must practice all with equal faithfulness, for all together 
constitute an ethical system complete in itself, in which 
no one virtue is indifferent to another. 
Morality should recognize no distinction of superiority among 
the different virtues. They reciprocally determine each other, There
-P-A-G-E-177
152 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
is no such thing as one virtue which shines out above the, others, not 
is there any special gift for virtue. The pupil must be taught that 
there are no great and no small among the virtues, for that one which 
may at first sight seem small is inseparably connected with that 
which is seemingly the greatest. Many virtues are attractive by rea- 
son of their external consequences, as, e. g., industry because of suc- 
cess in business, worthy conduct because of the respect paid to it, 
charity because of the pleasure attending it; but man should not 
practice these virtues because he enjoys them: he must devote the 
same amount of self-sacrifice and of assiduity to those virtues which 
(as Christ. said) are to be performed in secret, 
Tt is especially valuable, in an educational respect, to gain an 
insight into the transition, of which each virtue is empirically capa- 
ble, into a negative as well as into a positive extreme. The differ- 
ences between the extremes and the golden mean are differences in 
quality, although they arrive at this difference in quality by means 
of difference in quantity. Kant has, as is well known, attacked the 
Aristotelian doctrine of the ethical perdrns, since he was considering 
the qualitative difference of the disposition or intention as the decid- 
ing principle. This is the correct procedure when treating of the 
moral subject that acts, but in the objective development of the 
actions themselves, we arrive, on the other hand, at the determina- 
tion of a quantitative limit, e. g.,a man, with the most earnest inten- 
tion of doing right, may be in doubt whether he has net, in any task, 
done more or less than was fitting for him. 
As no virtue can cease its demands upon us, no one can permit 
any exceptions or any provisional circumstances to come in the way 
of his duties. Our moral culture will always certainly manifest itself 
in very unequal phases if we, ont of narrowness and weakness, neg- 
Iget entirely one virtue while we diligently cultivate another. If 
we are forced into such unequal action, we are not responsible for 
the result; but it is dangerous and deserves punishment if we vol- 
untarily encourage it. The pupil must be warned against a certain 
moral negligence which consists in yielding to certain weaknesses, 
faults, or crimes, a little longer and a little longer, because he has 
fixed a certain time after which he intends to do better. Up to that 
time he allows himself to be a loiterer in ethics, Perhaps he will as- 
sert that his companions, his surroundings, his position, ete., must 
be changed before he can alter his internal conduct. Wherever edu- 
cation or temperament favors sentimentality, we shall find birth-days,
-P-A-G-E-178
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 158 
new-year's-day, confirmation-day, etc., selected as these turning- 
points. It is not to be denied that man proceeds in his internal life 
from epoch to epoch, and renews himself in his most internal nature, 
nor can we deny that moments like those mentioned are especially 
favorable in man to an effort toward self-transformation because they 
invite self-examination ; but it is not to be permitted that the youth, 
while looking forward to such a moment, should consciously persist 
in his evil-doing. If he does, we shall have as consequences that when 
the appointed time which he has set. at last arrives, at the stirring of 
the first emotion he perceives with terror that he has changed noth- 
ing in himself; that the same temptations are present to him, the 
same weakness takes possession of him. In our business, in our theo- 
retical endeavors, it may certainly happen that, on account of want 
of time, or means, or humor, we may put off some work to another 
time; but morality stands on a higher plane than these, because it, 
as the concrete absoluteness of the will [see commentary to § 145: 
morality demands only such actions as do not. contradict the will of 
the social whole; immoral acts are therefore such as would destroy 
society if persisted in], makes unceasing demand on the whole and 
undivided man. In morality there are no vacations, no interims. 
As we in ascending a flight of stairs take good care not to make a 
single misstep, and give our conscious attention to every step, so we 
must not allow any exceptions in moral affairs, must not appoint 
given times for better conduct, but must await these last as natural 
crises, and must seek to live in time as in eternity. 
[The dialectic is the interaction of the several species of 
virtues, where they conflict, or where they mutually limit, or, 
finally, where they re-enforce each other, 
Virtues are to be practiced not because they are pleasurable, 
but because of the duties they involve. 
Some virtues, however, have negative and positive extremes— 
wherein they conflict, and find quantitative limits, Aristotle 
mentions the following virtues as consisting in a mean (ueodrns) 
between two extremes—courage (between rashness and coward- 
ice), temperance, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, proper 
mean between ambition and the want of it, meekness, plain 
speaking of the truth, pleasantry, sociability, modesty, righteous 
indignation. 
No virtue may be neglected for another. The worst results 
follow from the habit of procrastinating the performance of a
-P-A-G-E-179
154 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
daty or the indulgence of a weakness until a fixed day. The 
person who “turns over a new leaf” on an important epoch is 
apt to turn it back again soon after. The will must not be 
trifled with. Duty must be obeyed now. To permit a tempo- 
rary lapse from virtue occasionally is as inadmissible as allow- 
ing one’s self now and then a misstep in ascending a flight of 
stairs, Such missteps undo the whole work.] 
§ 149. (6) From moral culture springs the injunction 
of self-government. The action of education on the 
will with a view to form habits in it, is discipline or 
training in a narrower sense. Moral training teaches us 
to know the relation in which we in fact, as historical 
persons, stand to the idea of the good, From our per- 
sonal knowledge of ourselves as individuals we derive 
the idea of our limits; from the absolute knowledge of 
ourselves as human, on the other hand, which reveals to 
us freedom as the innermost ideal of our spiritual na- 
ture, we derive the conception of the resistless power of 
the genuine will for the good. But to actualize this 
conception we must have practice. This practice consti- 
tutes the proper moral culture. Every man must devise 
for himself some special set of rules, which shall be de- 
termined by his peculiarities and his resulting tempta- 
tions. These rules must have as their innermost essence 
the subduing of self, the vanquishing of his negative 
arbitrariness by means of the universality and necessity 
of the will. 
In order to make this easy, the youth may be practiced in re- 
nouncing for himself even the arbitrariness which is permitted to him. 
One often speaks of moral discipline as if it belonged especially to 
the middle ages and to Catholicism; but this is an error. Ascetic 
discipline in its one-sided form as relying on works of piety, and for 
the purpose of mortification, belongs to them; but discipline in gen- 
eral is a necessary instrumentality of morals, The keeping of a
-P-A-G-E-180
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 4BB 
journal is said to assist in the practice of virtue, but its value de- 
pends on how it is kept. To one it may be a curse, to another a 
blessing. Fichte, Goethe, Byron, and others, have kept journals and 
have been assisted thereby ; while others, as Lavater, have been hin- 
dered by them. Vain people will every evening record with pen and 
ink their admiration of the correct course of life which they have 
led during the day. 
[From the exercise of virtue (German Askese, not quite “ as- 
ceticism,” from the Greek “Agxyois) arises the maxim enjoining 
self-control. The will for the good is (see § 145, commentary) 
the will for the form of all will that does not contradict itself— 
the form in which all may act, never contradict, but always 
re-enforce each other, and hence the good is the form of resist- 
less human might.] 
§ 150. (c) The result of the practice in virtue, or, to 
express it philosophically, of the individual actualization 
of freedom, is the methodical development of the indi- 
vidual will as character. This conception of character 
is a merely formal one, for it considers only the un- 
changeable habit formed by the will, and according to 
which it directs its course in dealing with external af- 
fairs. As there are good, strong, and beautiful charac- 
ters, so there are also bad, weak, and detestable ones. 
When in the science of education, therefore, we speak 
so much of the building up of a character, we mean 
good character, or the making permanent of a direction 
of the individual will toward the actualization of the 
good. Freedom ought to be the character of character. 
Education must, therefore, observe closely the inter- 
action of the factors which go to form character, viz., 
.(@) the temperament, as the natural character of the 
man; (8) external events, the historical element; (y) 
the energy of the will, by which, within its limits of 
nature and history, it realizes the idea of the good in
-P-A-G-E-181
156 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
and for itself as the proper ethical character. Tem 
perament determines the mode and manner of our ex- 
ternal manifestation of ourselves; the events in which 
we live assign to us the ethical problems, but the will in 
its sovereignty stamps its seal on the structure built up 
from these materials. Education aims at accustoming 
the youth to freedom, so that he shall always measure 
his deed by the idea of the good. It does not desire a 
formal independence, which may also be called charac- 
ter, but a real independence resting upon the conception 
of freedom as that which is absolutely necessary. The 
pedagogical maxim is, then: Be independent, but be so 
through doing good. 
According to preconceived opinion, stubbornness and obstinacy 
indicate a firm basis of character. But these may spring from weak- 
ness and indecision, on which account one needs to be well on his 
guard. A gentle disposition, through enthusiasm for the good, may 
attain to quite as great a firmness of will. Coarseness and meanness 
are on no account to be tolerated. 
[The methodical development of the individual will, by the 
practice of virtue or vice, produces character, in the formal sense 
of the word as indicating either good or bad character. We 
mean good character when we use the word absolutely, and 
speak of a “person of character.” Education takes account 
of the factors that form character. (1) The temperament and 
natural proclivities; (2) the external historic environment; (3) 
the energy of the will.] 
§ 151. (8) The consideration of the eulture of charac- 
ter leads to the subject of conscience. This is the com- 
parison which the moral agent makes between himself 
as he is and his ideal self. He compares himself, in his 
past or future, with his nature, and judges himself ac- 
cordingly as good or bad. This independence which 
belongs to the ethical judgment is the true soul of all
-P-A-G-E-182
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 457 
morality, the negation of all self-illusion and of all de- 
ception through another. The educational maxim is: 
Be conscientious. Depend in your final decision en- 
tirely on your conception of what is right. 
The self-examination prompted by conscience prevails through- 
out all the situations of life, and is the ground of all our rational 
progress. Fichte’s stern words remain, therefore, eternally true: 
* He who has a bad character, must absolutely create for himself a 
better one.” 
[Conscience the criticism which the ideal self makes on the 
realized self. This is the highest authority within man.] 
CHAPTER XV. 
EDUCATION OF THE WILL (continued). 
(0) Religious Culture. 
§ 152. Socrax culture contains the formal phase, mor 
al culture the real phase, of the practical mind. Con- 
science forms the transition to religious culture. In its 
universal and necessary nature, it reveals the absolute 
authority of spirit. The individual discerns in the 
depths of his own consciousness commands possessing 
universality and necessity to which he has to subject 
himself. They appear to him as the voice of God. Re- 
ligion makes its appearance as soon as the individual ; 
distinguishes the Absolute from himself, as a personal 
Subject existing for and by Himself, and therefore for 
him. The atheist remains at the stage of insight into 
the absoluteness of the logical and physical, esthetic 
and practical categories. He may, therefore, be per.

fectly moral. But he lacks religion, though he loves to 
characterize his uprightness by this name, and to trans- 
fer the dogmatic definitions of positive religion into the 
ethical sphere. It belongs to the province of religion 
that I demean myself toward the Absolute not merely as 
my own substance, I alone being the conscious subject, 
but that for me the substance in itself is also a conscious 
personal subject. If I look upon myself as the only ab- 
solute, I make myself devoid of spiritual essence. If I 
am the only absolute self-consciousness, there remains 
only the impulse to a persistent conflict with every self- 
consciousness not identical with me. Such a self-con- 
sciousness would be only theoretical irony [i. e., it would 
deny itself in another, while it pretended to recognize 
itself in that other]. In religion I know the Absolute 
as essence, when I am known by Him. Everything else, 
myself included, is finite and transitory, however sig- 
nificant it may be, however relatively and for the mo- 
ment the Infinite may exist in it. In all finite existence 
the Infinite manifests itself only temporarily. But the 
Absolute, realizing itself, distinguishing itself from it- 
self even in its unity with itself, is always self-identical, 
and takes up all the unrest of the phenomenal world 
back again into its simple essence. 
[Politeness is the form, morality the substance or reality of 
the will or practical side of man. Conscience is the bridge that 
leads from morality over to religion. Religion begins when the 
individual recognizes personality in the highest principle in the 
universe, A “moral order of the world,” a “persistent force,” 
a “supreme idea,” and “an absolute harmony” are, respectively, 
practical, physical, logical, and esthetic categories, but neither 
of them is a religious category. The highest principle must be 
a Person, and I must recognize him as such, and his recognition 
of me is the highest object of my destiny.]

§ 133. This process of the individual spirit, in which 
it rises out of the multiplicity of all relations into union 
with the absolute as the substantial subject, and in whom 
nature and history are united, we may call, in a re- 
stricted sense, a change of heart. . . . The highest emo- 
tions of the heart culminate in religion, whose warmth 
is inspired by practical activity and conscientiousness. 
[* Change of heart "—Rosenkranz says Gemiith, which means 
the inner life of the soul and also a cheerful disposition. Hegel 
says that only the Teutonic branches of the human race possess 
Gemith, “that undeveloped, indefinite totality of spiritual being 
realized in the will rather than in the intellect.” The Romanic 
nations he distinguishes as having “character,” but not Gemith. 
Character surrenders itself to a principle, but heart surrenders 
itself to a principle only with a reserve, for “heart” feels its 
own personality, and will not surrender to an abstraction, but 
only to a person.] 
§ 154. Education has to prepare man for religion in 
the following respects: (1) It gives him the conception 
of it; (2) it endeavors to have this conception realized 
in his life ; (8) it subordinates the theoretical and practi-.: 
cal process in adapting him to a special standpoint of 
religious culture. 
In the working out or detailed treatment of the science of educa- 
tion, the position which the conception of religion occupies is very 
uncertain. Many writers on education place it at the beginning, 
while others reserve it for the end. Others naively bring it forward 
abruptly in the midst of heterogeneous surroundings, but know very 
little to say concerning it, and urge teachers to kindle the fire of re- 
ligious feeling in their pupils by teaching them to fear God. Through 
all their writing, we hear the cry that in education nothing is so im- 
portant as religion. Rightly understood, this ‘saying is quite true. 
The religious spirit, the consciousness of the Absolute, and the rever- 
ence for Him, should permeate all. Not unfrequently, however, we 
find that what is meant by religion is theology, or the church cere- 
monial, and these are only one-sided phases of the total religious

process. [Allusion to religion in English colleges and universities 
omitted.] Religion must form the culminating point of education, 
It takes up into itself the didactical and practical elements, and gives 
to their matter a universal form. 
[The respects in which education has to prepare the youth for 
‘religion are threefold: (2) It must teach him its theory; (2) it 
vaust train him into the habit of religious observances and a re- 
ligious life; (3) it must make these theoretical and practical 
phases of religion conform to the tenets of some particular de- 
nomination or “ to some special standpoint of religious culture.”]

(1) The Theoretical Process of Religious Culture. 
§ 155. Reticton, in common with every spiritual 
activity, must pass through three stages—feeling, con- 
ception, and comprehension. Whatever the special 
character of any religion may be, it can not avoid this 
psychological necessity, either in its general history or 
in the history of the individual. The teacher must 
understand this process, partly in order that he may 
make it easier to the pupil, partly that he may guard 
against the perversion of the religious feeling which 
may arise through the fact of the youth’s remaining in 
one stage after he is ready for another and needs it. 
The science of education must therefore here refer to 
the philosophy of religion for a complete discussion of 
this idea.
-P-A-G-E-186
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 161 
[Religion has three stages: (a) feeling; (6) conception or repre- 
sentation ; (c) comprehension or insight. These, it will be noted, 
correspond to the three psychological stages of the intellect 
(§ 84), the perceptive (or- intuitive), imaginative, and logical 
epochs. ] 
§ 156. (1) Religion exists first as religious feeling. 
The individual is through feeling still immediately 
under the control of the divine, does not yet distin- 
guish himself from the absoluteness of his own essence, 
and is in so far swayed by it. In so far as he feels the 
divine, he is a mystery to himself. This beginning is 
indispensable. Religion can not be produced in men 
by an education in external matters; its genesis belongs 
rather to the primitive depths in which God himself 
and the individual soul are essentially one. 
The educator must not allow himself to suppose that he is able 
to make a religion. Religion dwells originally in every individua.. 
soul, for every one is born of God. Education can only aid the de 
velopment of the religious feeling, As far as regards the psychologi- 
cal form, it was quite correct for Schleiermacher and his followers 
to characterize the essential element of the religious feeling as the 
feeling of dependence, for feeling takes its character from that 
which it feels; it depends upon its object, But in so far as God con- 
stitutes the object of the feeling, there enters it absolute emancipa- 
tion, or the opposite of all dependence. I have maintained this in 
opposition to Schleiermacher. Religion lifts man above the finite, 
temporal, and transitory, and frees him from the pressure of external 
circumstances. Even the lowest form of religion does this; and 
when it is said that Schleiermacher has been unjustly criticised for 
this expression of dependence, this distinction is overlooked. 
[Feeling or emotion is the indispensable first basis of religion. 
But if it goes no further than mere feeling, the devotee does not 
find himself able to recognize God as personal. To him God is 
therefore a fetich, an immediate manifestation in matter, and 
hostile to man’s freedom and intelligence. Schleiermacher held 
that religion arose in the feeling of dependence, and that this 
remained its essential element. But Rosenkranz points out that
-P-A-G-E-187
162 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
religion lifts man above the trammels of the finite and transi 
tory, and therefore gives him independence of the world.} 
§ 157. But religious feeling as such rises into some 
thing higher when the spirit distinguishes the content 
of this religious feeling from any other content which 
it also feels, forms for itself a mental image of it, and 
thus objectifies it, and thereby is enabled to assume a 
free attitude toward it. 
We must not understand that the religious feeling is destroyed 
in this process; in rising from vague feeling to a mental image of 
the object of feeling, it persists as a necessary form of the intelli- 
gence, 
[A higher stage of religion rises out of this vague and nebu- 
lous condition of mere feeling, and begins to define the divine as 
an object of the imagination.] 
§ 158. If the mind is held back and prevented from 
passing out of the simplicity of feeling into the act of 
distinguishing its object by perception, or recalling it 
and representing it as a mental image, if its efforts 
toward the forming of this representation are continually 
redissolved into feeling, then feeling, which was as the 
first step perfectly healthy and correct, will become 
morbid and degenerate into a wretched mysticism. 
Education must, therefore, remember that this feeling 
is not destroyed by the progress of its content into per- 
ception and conception on the side of psychological 
form, but rather that it attains truth thereby. 
[Mysticism is produced by the arrested development of re- 
ligious feeling. The devotee holds back from mental images 
and forms of the imagination, fearing to anthropomorphize the 
conception of the Divine Being. He does not, however, for this 
reason, attain a purer idea of Him, but tends rather to destroy 
all the attributes of personality in his conception of the Absolute, 
and leave it an empty abstraction like the Brahm of the Hindoos, 
or the Supreme Being (’Etre Supréme) of the French deists
-P-A-G-E-188
— A EDUCATION OF THE WILL, 163 
Education, therefore, makes a mistake if it attempts to elevate’ 
the pupil at once from the stage of feeling to that of compre- 
hension and insight without passing through the stage of im- 
agination.] 
§ 159. (2) Representation retains perception, trans- 
formed into conception. It develops the different phases 
of the religious content, and follows each of these to its 
consequence. Imagination controls the individual con- 
ceptions, but by no means with that absoluteness which 
is often supposed ; for each picture has in itself its logi- 
cal consequence to which imagination must yield; e. g., 
if a religion represents God as an animal, or as half ani- 
mal and half man, or as man, the conception chosen has 
in its development its consequences for the imagination. 
[Religious imagination is not mere idle fancy, but its images 
have a logical sequence, and adumbrate a series of profound 
ideas, | 
§ 160. We rise out of the stage of representation 
when the mind tries to detine the universality of its 
content according to its necessity, i.e., when it begins 
to think, But for the imagination the necessity of its 
pictures is a hidden assumption. The thinking ac- 
tivity, however, recognizes not only the contradiction 
which exists between the sensuous, limited form of the 
individual representation, and the essential nature of its 
content, but also the contradiction in which the concep- 
tions find themselves with respect to each other. 
{It is in attempting to discover the contents of these feligious 
images that the mind rises to the true concrete insight. Thought 
needs at first these mental pictures, and without them can not 
begin at all. Hence so-called deism, which rejects the imagina- 
tive stage of religious culture altogether, is not able to rise to a 
-eonerete doctrine of God as a divine human Person: such as 
Christianity reveals, but makes Him to be a being with the nega-
-P-A-G-E-189
{64 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
tion of all attributes, because such a deity transcends everything 
finite, and everything thinkable is regarded as finite.] 
§ 161. If the mind is prevented from passing out of 
the motley pictures of conception to the supersensuous 
elearness and simplicity possessed by the object of the 
thinking activity—if the content which it already be- 
gins to seize as idea is again dissolved into the discon- 
‘nected images of the picture-world—then the religion of 
imagination, which was a perfectly proper form as the 
second step, becomes perverted into some form of idola- 
try, either coarse or refined. Education must therefore 
not oppose the thinking activity if the latter undertakes 
to criticise the images and pictures in which religious 
conceptions are embodied; on the contrary, it must 
seek to guide this thinking activity so that the dis- 
covery of the contradictions which unavoidably adhere 
to sensuous form shall not mislead the youth into the 
folly of throwing away, with the husk that has become 
useless, also the religious kernel itself. 
It is an error for educators to desire to hold back the imagi- 
nation from religious feeling, but it is also an error to detain the 
mind, which is on its formal side essentially the activity of knowing, 
in the stage of imagination, and confine it to the office of picturing 
the conventional religious allegories. The more, in opposition to 
this, the mind is carried away with the charm of thinking, the more 
is it in danger of condemning the essence of religion itself as a mere 
fictitious conception, As a transition-stage the religion of imagina- 
tion is perfectly normal, and it does not in the least impair freedcm 
if, for example, one has personified evil.as a living devil in bodily 
shape. The error does not lie in this, but in the making independ- 
ent existences out of these sensuous forms of religion. The reaction 
of the thinking activity against such sensuous embodiment then 
undertakes in its negative freedom and independence as realized iz 
critical thought to despise the content also, as if it were a mere con 
ception,
-P-A-G-E-190
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 165 
[ Again, if religion is arrested at the standpoint of imagination, 
it becomes fixed in the form of idolatry. Hence, education has 
before it the difficult task (especially in our Sunday-schools) of 
guiding rather than repressing the critical tendency of pupils 
who are beginning to inquire for themselves into the contradic- 
tions and absurdities of the images and allegories in which the 
imagination has embodied religious truth, Spiritually under- 
stood, these very contradictions are the most wonderful and ad- 
mirable product of the history of religion, and altogether the 
most valuable and profound part of its revelation.] 
§ 162. (8) In the thinking activity the mind attains 
that form of the religious content which is identical 
with that of its simple self-consciousness, and above 
which there is no further progress for the intelligence 
as theoretical. But we distinguish three varieties in 
this thinking activity: the abstract, the reflective, and 
the speculative. The abstract gives us the religious 
eontent of consciousness in the form of abstractions or 
dogmas, i.e., propositions which set up some doctrine 
as a universal, and add to it a reason for its neces- 
sity. The reflective stage busies itself with the mutual 
relation of dogmas, and with an examination of the 
grounds alleged for their necessity: it is essentially 
critical, and hence skeptical. The discussion of the 
dogmas, which is carried on in this process of reasoning 
and skeptical investigation, gives place to speculative 
thinking, which recognizes the free unity of the con- 
tent and its form as its own proper self-determination 
of the content, creating its own differences. Education 
must know these three stages of the intelligence, partly 
that it may in advance preserve an equipoise, and pre- 
vent going to extremes in the midst of the changes 
which the progressive development produces in the 
consciousness; partly that it may be able to direct the 
18
-P-A-G-E-191
r66 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
process of change itself, in accordance with the proper 
order of development of these phases of mind. We 
should, for example, not try to prevent the criticism of 
the abstract understanding by the reflective stage nor 
that of the imagination by the thinking activity. But 
the stage of reflection is not to be regarded as the last 
and highest possibility of the thinking activity, although, 
in the vain conceit of its skepticism, it often takes itself 
for such, and, with the emptiness of mere negation to 
which it holds, often brings itself forward into unde- 
sirable prominence. It becomes evident, in this view, 
how very necessary for man, with respect to religion, is 
a genuine philosophical culture, so that he may not lose 
a sure conviction of the existence of the Absolute in a 
life of culture divided between adherence to unyielding 
dogmas on the one hand, and shifting, unstable opinions 
on the other hand. 
[Three varieties of religious thought on the plane of insight: 
(a) abstract, (0) reflective, (¢) speculative. The abstract sets 
forth the doctrines as abstract dogmas. The reflective busies 
itself over the mutual relation of the dogmas and the proofs 
of their necessity. This leads to skepticism. The speculative 
thinking sees the logical necessity of self-activity in the Abso- 
lute, and hence the consequent logical necessity for concrete 
attributes such as belong to a Creator. It recognizes the person- 
ality of the Absolute, and now comprehends the contradictions 
and apparent absurdities in the allegorical forms submitted to it.] 
§ 163. Education must then not fear the overthrow 
of dogmatic abstraction, since its downfall is an indis- 
pensable means for theoretical culture in its totality, 
and the consciousness can not dispense with it in its 
history. But education has, in dealing with concrete 
cases, carefully to discern in which of these stages of 
culture its pupil is. For if mankind as a race can not
-P-A-G-E-192
ee 
EE 
LOO EDUCATION OF THE WILL 167 
get along without philosophy, it by no means follows 
that this necessity exists for each individual. To chil- 
dren, to women, and to all simple and limited lives, the 
form of the religion of the imagination is well suited, 
and the form of religion for the speculative intellect 
has only a smali degree of significance to them. Edu- 
cation must not, then, desire powerfully and prema- 
turely to develop the thinking activity before the in- 
telligence has grown through the earlier stages of 
development. 
The forced efforts at thinking which many teachers demand in 
the sphere of religion is no less impractical than the want of all 
guidance into rightly ordered meditations on religious subjects. It 
is natural that to the lower form of intelligence a higher form should 
appear to be frivolous in its behavior toward it, because it has as yet 
felt no need of change of form as the higher has; and on this ae- 
count it looks upon the discrediting of a sacred symbol or emblem 
or the overthrow of a dogma as the destruction of religion itself. In 
our time the idea is very prevalent that the substance itself must 
change with the changing of the psychological form, and that there- 
fore a religion on the stage of feeling can no longer be the same in 
its essence with a religion on the stage of representation in mental 
images, or on the stage of clear thought. These suppositions, which 
are so popular, and are considered to be high philosophy, spring 
from the superficiality of psychological inquiry. 
[Religious education, therefore, must not fear these changes 
from feeling to imagination and from imagination to reflection, 
for they are indispensable to the full religious consciousness, 
and Christianity is essentially a religion of all these stages, and 
especially of the highest thought. Just. as in psychology we said 
that thinking goes back and re-enforces sense-perception and 
conception (§ 100), so the stage of insight goes back and re- 
enforces religious feeling and religious imagination, And it is 
for feeling and imagination only as thus re-enforced by thinking 
insight that Christianity is the true religion. But for all this it 
is by no means proper to attempt to prematurely develop the 
stage of ‘religious insight, for such attempt can only end in pro

ducing that critical skeptical stage above described. It is in 
teresting to notice the view that Rosenkranz holds concerning 
the capacity of women to understand philosophy. It was the 
common view held throughout the civilized world forty years 
ago, when this book was written. Since that time the education 
of girls has ascended step by step until college education has 
proved the mind of woman specially adapted to high studies.] 
§ 164. The theoretical education of the religious 
feeling endeavors, therefore, to unite the presupposi- 
tion of reason in the religious content with the freedom 
of philosophical criticism, and to elevate it to self- 
assured insight by means of the proof of the necessity 
of its determinations. This is the only reasonable peda- 
gogical way, not only to prevent the degeneration of the 
religious consciousness into a miserable mysticism or 
into empty formality, but also to remove these if they 
are already existent. 
External seclusion avails nothing. The crises of the world- 
historical changes in the religious consciousness penetrate the 
thickest cloister-walls, . . , 
[Theoretical religious education endeavors to re-enforce the 
stages of religious emotion and religious imagination by the

thoughts of the Divine, and defines his relation to God. 
But in a narrower sense that education is practical 
which relates to the Will as such. Education has in 
this respect to distinguish (1) consecration, (2) the int- 
siation of the youth into the forms of worship as found 
in some particular religion, and (3) his reconciliation 
with his lot. 
{The wili side of religious education is treated under three 
heads: (a) consecration of self; (6) ceremonial initiation, and 
uniting with the church; (c) religious reconciliation with one’s 
Jot in life.] 
§ 166. (1) Religious feeling presupposes morality as 
an. indispensable condition without which it can not at- 
tain its ideal. But while man from a merely moral 
standpoint places himself in relation to the idea of duty, 
the religious standpoint of the Church differs from it in 
this, that it holds the necessity of the good to be the 
self-determination of the Divine Will, and thus gives all 
human conduct a personal relation to God, changing the 
good to the holy and evil to sin. Education must, 
therefore, first accustom the youth to the idea that, in 
doing the good, he unites himself with God as with the 
absolute Person, but that in doing evil he separates him- 
self from him. The consciousness that through his 
deed he comes into relation with God himself, affirma- 
tively or negatively, deepens the moral standpoint with 
its formal obedience to the commands of virtue, to the 
standpoint of the heart that finds its all-sufficient prin- 
aiple in love. 
[Distinction between the moral and the religious standpoint. 
While the moral makes duty the highest, the religious looks 
upon the good as the action of the Divine Will, and thus places ~ 
the individual in a direct personal relation to God. The good

thus becomes the holy, and evil becomes sin. The distinctio 
between stn, crime, and evil is a very interesting one: sin

accompanied by external deeds. In contrast to erime it lies i 
the disposition of the heart. Moral evil may be conscious or w 
conscious—strictly moral evil must be conscious and a violatio:

Kant has designated it in “ Religion within the Limits of Pure Rea- 
son.” Nothing is more destructive of the sensibility to all real re- 
ligious culture than the want of earnestness with which prayers, 
readings from the Bible, attendance on church, the communion, etc., 
are often practiced by teachers. But one must not conclude, from 
this defect on the part of teachers, that an ignorance of all sacred 
forms in general would be more desirable for the child. 
[The religious discipline of consecration educates to renuncia- 
tion of selfish egotism, while the union with the church teaches 
the expression of the religious feeling in prayer, the use of 
symbols, and the observance of the solemnities of the church. 
Education has to guard, however, against the danger of con- 
founding forms with religion itself.] 
§ 168. (3) It is possible that a man on the standpoint 
of ecclesiastical religious observances may be fully con- 
tented; he may be entirely taken up with the ceremo- 
nies of worship, and pass his life in these occupations 
in perfect religious peace. But by far the greater num- 
ber of men will see themselves forced to experience the 
truth of religion in the hard vicissitudes of their lot, 
since they engage in secular activities, and create for 
themselves a past whose consequences condition their 
future. They limit themselves through their deeds, 
which they perform as partly voluntary and partly in- 
voluntary authors: involuntary, in so far as they are im- 
pelled to their deeds by the totality of events; voluntary, 
in so far as they originate them and react on the world 
around them. Nay, man is responsible for deeds of 
omission as well as of commission. The history of the in- 
dividual man appears, therefore, on the one hand, if we 
consider its material, as the work of cireumstances ; but, 
on the other hand, if we reflect on the form, as the act 
of a self-determining agent. Want of freedom (the be- 
ing determined through the given situation) and free-

{72 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
dom (the origination of the act) are united in actual life 
as a finality which is exactly so, and can not become 
anything else. The essence of the spiritual being stands 
always over against this unavoidable limitation as that 
which is in itself infinite and eternal, as beyond all his- 
tory, because the absolute spirit, in and for itself, has no 
history. That which man calls his history is only the 
manifesting of himself and his continual withdrawal 
out of this manifestation into himself, an act which co- 
incides with the transcending of all manifestation on 
’ the part of the absolute spirit. From this infinite es. 
sential nature which belongs to him there arises for the 
individual spirit the impulse toward a beatific life, i. e., 
a life freed from external contingencies even in the 
midst of their process. He gratifies this impulse nega- 
tively through the contemplation of what has happened 
as past and gone, as that which lives now only ideally 
in the memory; or he contemplates it in a new actual 
existence more perfect than the old one which he has 
planned in order to realize the idea of freedom which 
constitutes his ideal nature. This constant new-birth 
out of the grave of the past to the life of a more beau- 
tiful future is the true solution of the problem of life. 
The false solution may assume different forms. It may 
abstain from all action becanse man through action limits 
himself and becomes accountable to others; but this is 
to despair of freedom, for it condemns the spiritual be- 
ing to the loss of its selfhood; for its nature demands 
activity. The abstract quietism of the Indian yogis, of 
the Buddhists, of the fanatical ascetics, of the Protest 
ant recluses, ete., is an error of this kind. Or, second- 
ly, man may become indifferent to the ethical conse
-P-A-G-E-198

quences of his deeds. In this case he acts, it is true; 
but, because he has no faith in the necessary connection 
of his deeds with their consequences as results of his 
choice, a connection which he would ascribe to mere 
chanee, he loses his spiritual essence. This is the error 
of indifference and its trifling, which denies the open 
mystery of human life as built up by freedom out of 
materials furnished by Fate. Education must, there- 
fore, imbue man with respect for the cireumstances and 
events of his environment, and at the same time inspire 
with faith in the inexhaustible resources of the human 
spirit, since only by continually producing better things 
can he elevate himself above his past. This practical 
acknowledgment of the necessity of freedom as the de- 
termining principle of life gives the highest satisfaction 
to which practical religious feeling may arrive, for the 
state of beatitude develops itself in it—that blessedness 
which refuses to admit that it is circumscribed by fini- 
tude and transitoriness, and which possesses the undy- 
ing courage to strive always anew for perfection, with 
cheerful resignation when defeated; and by this means 
happiness and misery, pleasure and pain, are conquered 
by the power of disinterested self-sacrifice and sincere 
humility. 
The escape from action in an artificial exclusion of all relation 
to external events, which often sinks to a veritable brutifying of man, 
is the distinguishing feature of all monkish education, In our time 
[1848] there is especial need of a reconciliation between man and des- 
tiny, for all the world is discontented. The worst form of discontent 
is when one is, as the French say, blasé ; though the word is not, as 
many fancy, originally French, but from the Greek Bad(ew, to wither.

has increased to that of thorough disgust at existence—disgust whict.

is blasé has enjoyed evérything, experienced everything, mocked at 
everything. He has passed from the enjoyment of pleasure to sen. 
timentality, i.e. to rioting in feeling; from sentimentality to that 
irony which despises the shallowness of mere feeling, and from this 
to the tormenting consciousness of his entire weakness and empti- 
ness when he has discarded feeling. He ridicules this also, as if it 
were a consolation to fling away the universe like a squeezed lemon 
and to assert that in empty nothing lies the truth of all things. And 
yet, nevertheless, this irony furnishes the point on which education 
can fasten, in order to kindle anew in him the religious feeling, and 
to lead him back to a loving recognition of the world, and to » 
proper interest in the circumstances and events of his time. ‘The 
greatest difficulty which education has to encounter here is the eo 
quetting with this blasé mood, the miserable affectation of superior- 
ity, and the self-complacency which have undermined the man and 
made him incapable of all simple and natural enjoyment. It is not 
tuo much to assert that many pupils of our Gymnasia are affected 
with this malady. Our literature is full of its products. We inveigh 
against its dissipation, and nevertheless at the same time can not re- 
sist a certain kind of pleasure in it. Diabolical sentimentality ! 
[Religious peace does not often come to the individual solely 
through personal consecration and the strict performance of 
ceremonial observances.. It is the encountering of the hard 
vicissitudes of life that brings home to the individual the 
jessons of religion and elevates him to that higher religious 
state of mind called reconciliation with one’s lot, or religious 
peace and consolation which are a sure indication that this indi- 
vidual has renounced the world and has joined his life to the 
eternal order, and is therefore secure from the arrows of fortune, 
no matter how much his energies may be given to the accom 
plishment of temporal enterprises. Quietism, which renounce 
all action, is the false religious peace, for spirit is essential ac- 
tivity, and the will must forever realize the good anew by 
changing nature into a more pliant instrument of the spirit. 
The antithesis of this consolation of religion is the state of mind 
described as blasé and Weltschmers.]

EDUCATION OF THE wILL. (c) Peligious Culture 
(continued). 
(8) The Absolute Process of Religious Culture. 
§ 169. In comparing the stages of the theoretical 
and practical culture of the religious feeling their in- 
ternal correspondence appears. Feeling, as immediate 
knowledge of God, and the consecration of the objects 
of sense to holy purposes by means of piety; imagina- 
tion with all its images, and the church services with 
their symbolism and ceremonial observances; finally, 
the comprehending of religion in its highest spiritual 
meaning, and the reconciliation of man with his lot as 
the internal emancipation from the dominion of external 
events—all these correspond to each other. If we grasp 
this parallelism as a whole, we have the course which 
religion must take in its historical process, in which it 
(1) begins as natural, (2) goes on to historical differences 
of form, and (8) unites these finally in a rational faith. 
These stages await every man in so far as he lives 
through a complete religious culture, but this may be 
for the individual a question of chance. 
[The absolute process of religious culture would take one 
through three stages: (a) beginning with the natural, (d) it 
would next develop differences of form, and (¢) unite these, 
through insight, in a rational faith.} 
§ 170. (1) A child has as yet no definite religious 
feeling. He is still only a possibility capable of growth 
in all directions. But, since he is a spiritual being, the
-P-A-G-E-201

essence of religion is active in him, though as yet in an 
unconscious form. The substance of spirit attests its 
presence in every individual, through his mysterious 
impulse toward the infinite and eternal, and toward in- 
tercourse with God. This is the elementary stage of 
natural religion, which must not be confounded with 
the religion which makes Nature the object of worship 
(fetichism, etc.). 
[In the child brought up in modern civilization natural re- 
ligion manifests itself as an impulse toward the infinite and 
eternal, and toward communion with God.] 
§ 171. (2) But the child comes in contact with defi- 
nite forms of religion, and will naturally, through the 
mediation of the family, be introduced to some one of 
them. His religious feeling takes now a particular di- 
rection, and he accepts religion in one of. its historical 
forms. This special realization of religion meets the 
precise want of the child, because it brings into his con- 
sciousness, by means of teaching and forms of worship, 
the principal elements which are found in the nature of 
religion. 
[The family introduces the child to its own chosen form of 
worship, and he accepts it and finds in it satisfaction.] 
§ 172 (8) In contradistinction to the natural basis of 
religious feeling, all historical religions rest on the au- 
thoritative basis of revelation from God to man. They 
address themselves to the imagination, and offer a system 
of objective forms of worship and ceremonies. But 
spirit, as eternal, as self-identical, can not forbear as 
thinking activity to subject the traditional religion to 
criticism and to compare it asa phenomenal existence 
with its perfect ideal. From this criticism arises a re
-P-A-G-E-202
EDUCATION OF THE WILL. 177 
ligion which satisfies the demands of the reason, and 
which, by means of insight into the necessity of the his- 
torical process, leads to the exercise of a genuine tolera- 
tion toward its many-sided forms. This religion recon- 
ciles the unity of the thinking consciousness with the 
religious dogmas and ceremonies, which, in the history 
of religious feeling, appear theoretically as dogma, and 
practically as the command of an absolute and incom- 
prehensible authority. The religion of reason is just as 
simple as the unsophisticated natural religious feeling, 
but its simplicity is at the same time master of itself. 
It is just as specific in its determinations as any histori- 
cal form of religion, but its determinateness is at the 
same time universal, since it is worked out by the think- 
ing reason. 
[If the individual reflects on the nature of religion in itself 
and the ground for its appearance in this or that denomina- 
tional form, he may arrive at a justification of all forms and 
ceremonies, finding the occasion of each in its historic genesis, 
In this he reaches a genuine toleration, but not the negative 
state of indifference that is wont to accompany toleration; for 
he sees, through these forms, their revelation of the divine.] 
§ 173. Education must superintend the development 
of the religious consciousness toward an insight into the 
necessary sequence of its different stages. Nothing is 
more absurd than for the educator to desire to avoid the 
introduction of a particular form of religion, or a defi- 
nite creed, as a middle stage between the natural begin- 
ning of religious feeling and its end in philosophical 
eultare. Only when a man has lived through the en- 
tire range of a one-sided phase—through the crudeness 
of such a conerete individualizing ‘of religion, and has 
come to recognize the universal nature of religion‘in a
-P-A-G-E-203
178 THE SPECIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
special form of it which excludes other forms—only 
when the spirit of a church has taken him into its num 
ber, is he ripe to criticise religion in a conciliatory 
spirit, because he has then gained a religious character 
through that historical experience. The self-compre- 
hending universality must have such a solid basis as this 
in the career of the man; it can never form the begin- 
ning of one’s culture, but it may constitute the end 
which turns back again to the beginning. Most men 
remain at the historical standpoint. The religion of 
reason, as that of the minority, constitutes in the differ- 
ent religions the invisible church, which seeks by pro. 
gressive reform to purify these religions from supersti- 
tion and unbelief. It is the duty of the state, by making 
all churches equal in the sight of the law, to guard re- 
ligion from the temptation of impure motives, and, 
through the granting of such freedom to religious indi- 
viduality, to help forward the unity of a rational insight 
into religion which is distinct from the religious feeling 
only in its form, not in its content. Not a philosopher, 
but Jesus of Nazareth, freed the world from all selfish- 
ness and all bondage. 
[These three phases in the absolute religious process are essen- 
tial to complete religious experience. Certainly the first and 
second forms are indispensable—the stage of religious emotion 
and the stage of membership in a denominational body. The 
third stage, that of membership in the invisible church, has no 
meaning to those who have not entered the visible church in 
some one of its communions.] 
§ 174. With this highest theoretical and practical 
emancipation, the general work of education ends. It 
remains now to be shown how the general idea of edu- 
cation shapes its special elements into their appropriate
-P-A-G-E-204

forms. From the nature of education, which concerns 
itself with man in his entirety, this exposition belongs 
partly to the history of culture in general, partly to the 
history of religion, partly to the philosophy of history. 
The pedagogical element in it always lies in the ideal 
which the spirit of a nation or of an age creates for it- 
self, and which it seeks to realize in its youth. 
[With religious education, which unites theoretical and prac- 
tical education by offering to the intellect the view of the first 
principle of the universe, and by offering to the will a revelation 
of the divine purpose in creation as the ultimate guide for all 
practical action, education ends. The science of education, hav- 
ing expounded these departments, has now left for it only the 
survey of the historical systems that have prevailed in the 
world.]

INTRODUCTION. 
HISTORICAL SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
§175. Tux general idea of education is individual. 
ized, in its realization in human history, according to its 
elements, into specific ideas which we call pedagogical 
principles. The number of these principles is not un- 
limited, but the idea of education admits only a certain 
definite number. If we deduce them, therefore, we 
deduce at the same time the history of pedagogics, 
which can from its very nature do nothing else than 
realize the possibilities involved in the idea of educa- 
tion. Such a deduction may be called an @ priori con- 
struction of history, but it differs from what is gener- 
ally denoted by this term in not pretending to deduce 
single events and characters. All empirical details are 
confirmation or illustration for it, but it does not attempt 
to seek this empirical element @ priori. 
The history of pedagogics is still in the stage of infancy. Some- 
times it is taken up into the sphere of politics; sometimes into that 
of the history of culture. The productions of some of the most dis- 
tinguished writers on the subject are now antiquated. [Omission

here of references to the works of Niemeyer, Schwarz, Cramer, Stral- 
sund, Alexander Kapp, of Brzoska’s and Mager’s “ Pedagogical Re- 
views."}] But with regard to modern pedagogics we have relatively 
very littie. Karl von Raumer,* in 1843, began to publish a “ History 
ot Pedagogies since the Time of the Revival of Classical Studies,” and 
has accomplished much of value on the biographical side. But the 
idea of the general connection and dependence of the several phases 
has not received much attention, and since the time of Pestalozzi 
books have assumed the character of biographical confessions. Striim- 
pell, in 1848, collected and systematized the educational material 
found in the writings of the philosophers Kant, Fichte, and Herbart. 
[The exposition of the historical systems that have prevailed 
in the world is derived partly from the history of culture, partly 
from the history of religion, and partly from the philosophy of 
history. The educational element in a nation must always be 
interpreted through the ideal which the spirit of a nation or an 
age creates for itself and secks to realize in its youth. 
Each historical system has a definite idea or principle lying at 
its basis. It may seem at first as though there might be an in- 
definite number of these principles, but such is not the fact. 
Human nature is a definite thing as a reality, and its ideal 
is also something definite, namely, rational culture, Reason is 
logical and systematic. Hence, the development of the human 
race into reason can give only such phases asthe two extremes 
and their combination permit. Man starts as a natural being 
and becomes a spiritual being. He begins in thralldom to time 
and space, and develops self-determination and freedom in his 
intellect and will. Man’s first phase of growth into civilization 
is characterized by absolute authority correlated with absolute 
subjection. The institutions which help him to free himself 
from nature (family, civil society, state, church) assume an atti- 
tude of absolute authority toward the individual, That is to 
say, the first stage of the development of civilization sets up its 
institutions of civilization in the form of nature. As civiliza-

eation.—Ep.

tion is the process of mediation between nature and spirit, three 
general phases only are possible in the history of civilization : 
(a) The phase in which institutions take on the form of nature, 
and. crush out all individual freedom; (b) the phase in which 
pure spirit or the personal God governs his people directly as 
a chosen people, and sets them free from all forms of Nature- 
worship; (¢) the phase in which man himself enters into the 
positive individual freedom of spirit. In § 177, Rosenkranz 
names three phases: (a) National Education; (b) Theocratic 
Education; (c) Human Education. There is in this classifica- 
tion an @ priort element which necessitates three and only three 
general forms (the subdivisions of these three forms are, of 
course, indefinitely manifold). Experience alone discovers for 
us the nations and people who may be classified under these 
three classes.] 
§176. Man is educated by man for humanity. This 
is the fundamental idea of all education. But, in the 
shaping of this science, we can not begin with the idea 
of humanity as such, but only with the natural form in 
which it primarily manifests itself—that of the people 
or nation. But the naturalness of this principle disap- 
pears in the course of its development, since nations act 
and react upon each other, and begin gradually to per- 
ceive the unity of their common humanity. But the 
freedom of spiritual being from nature makes its ap- 
pearance explicitly in the transcendent form of abstract 
theistic religion, in which God is recognized as the ruler 
over Nature, which on the other hand is conceived as 
merely dependent ; and his chosen people plant the root 
of their nationality no longer in the earth, but in this 
belief. The unity of the abstractly natural and ab- 
stractly spiritual determinateness is the concrete unity 
of the spirit with nature, in which it recognizes nature 
as its necessary organ, and itself as in its nature divine. 
Spirit in this stage, as the internal presupposition of the
-P-A-G-E-211
186 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
two previously named, takes up into itself on one hand 
the phase of nationality, since this is the form of the 
immediate individualization (of modern civilization) ; 
but it no longer distinguishes between nations as if they 
were abstractly severed the one from the other, as the 
Greeks shut out all other nations under the name of 
barbarians. It also takes up into itself the phase of 
spirituality, since it knows itself as spirit, and knows it- 
self to be free from nature, and yet it does not estrange 
itself from the world as the Jews did in their repre- 
sentation of pure spirit, to whom nature seemed to be 
only the work of divine caprice. Humanity knows na- 
ture as its own, because it knows the divine spirit and 
its creative energy manifesting itself in nature and his- 
tory, as also the essence of its own spirit. Education 
can be complete only with Christianity as the religion 
of humanity. 
[Man is educated by man for humanity, i, e., for the realiza- 
tion of all the possibilities of humanity as a whole in each in- 
dividual; education of the youth shall give him the results of 
all human experience. But humanity in its complete unfolding 
is not to be found at the beginning of history. The totality of 
a people or nation is the highest realization of humanity that 
can be found at first (countless ages pass away before science, 
art, philosophy, and theology come to exist). “The naturalness 
of this principle,” i. e., the bond that unites a people, is a natural 
and not an artificial bond; it does not depend on leagues and 
treaties, but on community of descent and consequent identical 
race-peculiarities, common language, manners and customs, and 
traditions. Each individual of a people finds himself living in 
this identity with his people just as he finds himself living in 
identity with a family. he family identity (called “identity” 
because it is a common life, the same for each, consisting of 
mutual relations and common possessions in which each owns 
an undivided share) is a “natural” one in the fact that it, too, 
arises from the laws of nature and not from free choice, Tho
-P-A-G-E-212
HISTORICAL SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 187 
individual, e. g., can not choose his ancestry. This natural 
unity of people gradually gives place to the recognition of com- 
mon humanity and an observance of humane duties toward all 
men. 
The spiritual nature of man (his will, intellect, and heart) is 
opposed to his animal nature. Matter is exclusive; animal 
gratifications are exclusive and selfish; spiritual life is par- 
ticipation; the intellect and the moral will develop through 
sharing all acquisitions with others. Wisdom is a product of 
the race, and not of one individual exclusively; the greater the 
number who participate in wisdom, the better for all. The 
second phase of the history of culture is the one in which God is 
revealed as @ pure spiritual being, not identical with the sun or 
moon or any part of nature, or indeed with the whole of nature. 
In the contemplation of this pure ideal man begins to see that. 
his own destiny is something transcending nature, “The 
chosen people plant the root of their nationality” not in any 
particular territory or feature of nature, but in their faith in 
Jehovah. The Jewish nationality is a sort of pivot on which 
the history of the world turns from the thralldom of nature to 
the freedom of spirit. Nevertheless, spirit is not free when it 
simply renounces nature and regards it as a work of divine ca- 
price. It must conquer nature and use it for spiritual purposes 
or rational ends before it is free in the highest sense. Concrete 
freedom is therefore said to be a unity of spirit and nature, but 
it is a unity in which nature is subordinated to an instrument, 
and spirit is exalted to the end and aim of creation. In this it 
“takes up into itself the phase of nationality,” or, in other 
words, modern civilization retains the form of the nation or of 
separate peoples, but at the same time it repudiates more and 
more the jealousy and hatred that was wont to be directed to 
outside nations. It also “takes up into itself the phase of 
spirituality,” i. e., besides retaining nationality, modern civiliza- 
tion also worships God as @ person, and places on the summit 
the ideal of the divine-human. By this it “knows itself to be 
free from nature,” i. e., to be immortal and able to survive 
death and live without this world. “Humanity knows nature 
as its own” because it recognizes its right to use it for its own 
advantage; it sees nature as created by Absolute Reason for the 
behoof of reasonable creatures made in his image. Hence edu-
-P-A-G-E-213
188 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
cation becomes “complete with Christianity as the ‘religion of 
humanity.”] 
§177. We have thus three different systems of edu- 
eation : (1) the National ; (2) the. Theocratic ; and (8) the 
Humanitarian. The first works after the manner of na- 
ture, since it educates the individual as a type of bis 
race. The original nationality endeavors sharply to dis- 
tinguish itself from others, and to impress on each per- 
son the stamp of its uniform type. One individual is 
like every other, or at least should be so. The second 
system in its manner of manifestation is identical with 
the first. It even marks the national difference more 
emphatically ; but the ground of the uniformity of the 
individuals is with it not merely the natural element in 
common, but the common interest is the result of the 
spiritual unity, which neglects nature, and concentrates 
its whole attention upon the events of its own history; 
satisfied with no present, it remains in continual self- 
alienation, looking back to its past, or forward to its fu- 
ture. The theocratic system educates the individual as 
the servant of God. He is the true Jew only in so 
far as he is this; the genealogical identity with father 
Abraham is a condition but not the principle of the 
nationality. The third system emancipates the indi- 
vidual, and elevates him to the enjoyment of freedom 
as his essence ; educates him within national limits which 
no longer separate but unite; and, in the consciousness 
that each, without any kind of mediation, has a direct 
relation to God, makes of him a man who knows him- 
self to be a member of the spiritual world of humanity. 
We can have no fourth system beyond this. From the 
side of the state-pedagogics we might characterize these
-P-A-G-E-214
HISTORICAL SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 189 
systems as that of the nation-state, the God-state, and 
the humanity-state. From the time of the establishment 
of the last, no one nation can attain to any sovereignty 
over the others. By means of the world-religion of 
Christianity, the education of nations has come to the 
point of taking, for its ideal, man as determining him- 
self according to the demands of reason. : 
[Three different systems of education founded on the stages of 
civilization : (a) National ; (b) Theocratic ; (¢) Humanitarian— 
“humanitarian” not used here in a sentimental sense; it ex- 
presses rather the missionary sense—love for the souls of men of 
whatever race or land; the care of the civilization for its un- 
fortunate, the care of the highest for the lowest. It is.a civil- 
ization that interests itself in all nature as a revelation of the 
divine, and hence specializes its work in the several sciences, in- 
vestigating the humblest orders of nature with as much pains- 
taking care as the mightiest. 
The National system works “after the manner of nature, since 
it educates the individual as a type of his race”; education among 
the people of Asia does not attempt to develop individualism, 
but only to repress individuality and produce perfect conformity 
to the established type of behavior, just as Nature compels new 
acorns to be like the old ones, Species is tyrannical in nature, 
allowing only the slightest of variations from the type. But in 
the highest civilization individuality is cherished to such a degree 
that social caste, intellectual modes of thought, habits of behavior, 
and vocation may be completely varied in the second generation. 
In the second system (the Theocratic) the uniformity of indi- 
viduals is based on its spiritual unity, a continual straining of 
the mind after what is not present—a past to which it looks 
back with longing as the days of patriarchal ancestors who lived 
in close personal favor with Jehovah, or a future in which it ex- 
pects peace and plenty, and the renewal of divine favor, The 
Jewish child must. be educated as a servant of God. The race 
principle, based as it is on nature, yields in the case of the He- 
brews to the purely spiritual principle of service of Jehovah. 
If one serves Jehovah, it is not necessary that he be descended 
from Abraham,
-P-A-G-E-215
190 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
The third system has for its ideal the brotherhood of all men, 
and continually impels the nations toward commerce in articles 
of use and beauty, necessity and luxury, as well as the inter- 
change of ideas and the mutual toleration of differences. 
There can ke no fourth system beyond this, because this com- 
pletely mediates the particular with the universal, holding as its 
end and aim the perfect collection of all that the individual pro- 
duces into the market of the world, material and spiritual, and 
the perfect distribution of all thence again to the individual, so 
that each helps all and all help each. Each person gives his 
mite to the world; each person receives from the world infinitely 
more than he gave, not in quantity but in quality, enriched by 
variety and all manner of precious attributes. For each locality 
has a limited number of precious material productions, and like- 
wise a few spiritual gifts; by world-commerce each locality is 
made to abound in the desirable productions of all climes, and 
the spiritual gifts of all places and all times are brought to every 
human being. This is achieved progressively by the inspiration 
of Christianity as it gradually regenerates society.] 
CHAPTER I. 
THE SYSTEM OF NATIONAL EDUCATION. 
§ 178. Tux National is the primitive system of edu- 
cation, since the family is the organic starting-point of 
all education, and it grows into the basis of nationality. 
Education has always in view the preparation of youth for life 
in institutions. Even inorganic peoples, those in a state of nature— 
the so-called savage races—are possessed of something more than a 
mere physical education; for, though they set much value upon 
gymnastic and warlike practices, and give much time to them, they 
ineulcate also respect for parents, for the aged, and for the decrees 
of the community. Education with them is essentially family train- 
ing, and its object is to cultivate in children a natural love and rev-
-P-A-G-E-216
| THE SYSTEM OF NATIONAL EDUCATION 191 
erence for the elders and those in authority. That the finer forms to 
which we are.accustomed are wanting must not be forgotten. Be- 
sides, education among all these people of nature is very simple and 
much the same, though great differences in its administration may 
exist, arising from differences of geographical situation or race char- 
acteristics, 
[The National is the primitive system of education because it 
is the education of the family, which is the germ out of which 
grows civilization. The education of the family lays chief stress 
on what Rosenkranz calls “natitrliche Pietdt,” i.e., love and 
reverence for parents and blood-relatives, and obedience to eld- 
ers—what the Romans called piefas, the affection and respect 
due to parents and departed ancestors; it expressed the piety of 
ancestor-worship, which is the oldest form of religion. (See Des 
Coulanges’ La Cité Antique.) Rosenkranz says: “Education 
has always in view the production of spirit (@eist)—Geist being 
the technical term in Hegel’s Philosophy for the social life. of 
man in the institutions of civilization; Geist might here be 
translated ‘civilization,’ although its literal ordinary meaning is 
gpirit.”] 
§179. National education is divided into three spe- 
cial systems: (1) passive, (2) active, (8) individual. It 
begins with the humble attitude of an utter subjection 
to nature, and ends with the arrogance of an equally 
entire rejection of nature. 
[Three systems of National education: (1) passive (China, 
India, Thibet); (2) active (Persia); (3) individual (Greece and 
Rome).] 
§ 180. Man subjects himself at first to the natural 
authority of the family; he obeys unconditionally its 
behests. Then he substitutes for the family, as he goes 
on in his culture, the artificial family of his caste, to 
whose rules he again unconditionally yields. To relieve 
himself from this artificiality and this tyranny, at last 
he breaks away from the family and from the training 
that prepares him for family and caste. He flees from
-P-A-G-E-217
192 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
both, and, becoming a monk, he again subjects him: 
the tyranny of his order. A monk presents to u 
a specimen of his species—all are alike. 
{(4) The passive. (a) Man begins in the humble attitude 
subjection to Nature as it is found in the family: he obeys t! 
authorities of the family implicitly. The Chinese state is founde} 
on patriarchal rule. (b) The Indian civilization substitutes cast 
_for family, and obeys its rules, (c) Then he revolts against 
tyranny of caste, and subjects himself to a new tyranny, the rul 
of the cloister—the Buddhist civilization in its purest forn 
These phases of civilization will be treated in detail further on 
§ 181. This absolute abstraction from nature an 
from education that fits one for life in family and cast 
this quietism of spiritual isolation, is the ull” 
of the passive system. In opposition to thii 
system seeks the positive vanquishing of | 
straints. Its people are courageous. They

They brave the dangers of the sea. The un 
of the patriarchal state, the fantastic dream; 
the caste-state, the ascetic self-renunciation of wu civisus 
state, yield gradually to the recognition of the world o 
reality, and the fundamental principle of Persian edu 
cation consisted in the inculcation of veracity. 
[The passive system (1) results in quietism or the renunciatiot 
of activity and the adoption of a life of seclusion and meditatior

§ 182. But the nationality which is occupied with 
simple, natural elements—other nations, death, the mys- 
tery of the ocean—may revert to the abstractions of the 
previous stage, which in education often takes on cruel 
forms—nay, often truly horrible. First, when spiritual 
being begins not only to suspect its nature, but rather . 
to recognize itself as the true essence; and when the 
God of Light places as the motto on his temple the 
command to self-knowledge, the natural individuality 
becomes free. Neither the passive nor the active sys- 
tem permits the free self-distinction of the individual 
from his fellows. In them, to be an individuality is a 
betrayal of the very idea of their existence, and even 
the suspicion of such a thing is suflicient to destroy ut- 
terly and mercilessly the one to whom it refers. Even 
the solitary individuality of the despot is not the one- 
ness of free individuality ; but he is also only a speci- 
men of his kind, although the only specimen. Nation- 
ality rises to individuality through the free dialectic of 
its component peoples, whereby it dissolves its presup- 
position, or the peculiarities that arise from limitations 
by alien nationalities. 
[The defects and limits of the “active” systems—liable to 
revert to the abstractions of the passive systems, and take on 
eruel forms (Phoenician Moloch-fires, Egyptian slavery, Persian 
luxury, ete), (8) The individual system is far in advance of the 
passive and active systems in the fact that it is based on a recog- 
nition of individuality in the divine, and hence permits itself to

ceed from natural conditions. Aisthetically it see 
ture, but nature in the form of living body, in orc 
penetrating it with mind, to make of it a work c. ..., 
practically it seeks it, partly to disdain it in gloomy res- 
ignation, partly to enjoy it in revels of excessive sensv- 
ality, and to heighten the extravagance of © . 
ternal morbid ‘self-consciousness by cruel 01 
public spectacles. 
The Germans were not savage in the common signification of this 
term. They were men each one of whom constituted himself will- 
ingly a center for others, or, if this was not the case, renounced them 
in proud self-sufficiency, All the glory and all the disgrace of our 
history lie in the power of individualizing which is divinely infused 
into our veins. As a natural element, if this be not controlled, it 
degenerates easily into intractableness, into violence. The Germans 
need, therefore, in order to be educated, severe discipline, the impo- 
sition of difficult tasks; and for this reason they attack such subjects 
as Roman law, Greek philology, Gallic usages, ete. in order to work 
off their superfluous strength. The natural love of independent. in- 
dividuality which characterized the German found its needed com- 
plement in Christianity. The history of the German race shows that 
it would have been destroyed by this extreme tendency tow 
viduality which led to minute political divisions and to weal | 
ties. The German people, full of faith in their own personal 4 
ventured forth upon the sea, and managed their ships as skillful 
horsemen their chargers,

[Individuality, however, must always have a natural basis, for 
its differences will not be found in the common rational endow- 
ment of intellect and will. Hence it happens that we find the 
first nation that sets up individuality as its principle seeking it 
in the form of the beautiful as it shines through physical nature, 
especially in the human body. The second nation, the Roman, . 
seeks individuality practically for epicurean enjoyment and 
sensuality, or for Stoic renunciation, setting up its natural in- 
dividual self as a target for the universe. (These peculiarities 
will be explained in detail in §§ 208-225.) The German “ab- 
stract individualism” (treated in § 226), which is that of the 
love of isolated personal freedom, needs severe discipline (such 
as feudal vassalage) to educate it into the necessary feeling of 
dependence on society.] 
CHAPTER IL. 
FIRST GROUP—THE SYSTEM OF- PASSIVE EDUCATION. 
§184. Ax education desires to free man from his 
finitude, to make him ethical, to unite him with God. 
It begins, therefore, with a negative relation to natural 
conditions, limits, and restraints, but at once falls into a 
contradiction of its aim, by converting this opposition 
to nature into a natural necessity. Spirit (that is to say, 
man acting in institutions) subjects the individual (1) to 
the rule of the family as the institution that is the closest 
approximation of nature; (2) to the rule of the caste 
as to a principle in itself spiritual, mediated through 
the division of labor, which it nevertheless, through the 
principle of hereditary descent, joins again to the fam- 
ily ; (8) to the abstract self-determination of the monk- 
ish quietism, which turns itself away as well from the

family as from work, and makes this flight from nature 
and human society, this absolute passivity, his educa- 
tional ideal. 
We shall not here enter into the details of these systems, but 
simply endeavor to make clear their distinctions and remove the 
vagueness which is generally found in the descriptions of them 
abounding in educational works, which employ the terms “ hierarch- 
ical and theocratical education ” without historical accuracy. 
-[The rational ground for the system of “ passive education.” 
It sets out to free man from thralldom to Nature, and hence as- 
sumes a “negative relation” toward “natural conditions,” i. e., 
it refuses to permit the individual to give free rein to his animal 
impulses, but constrains him to obey the rules and regulations 
ordained for the establishment and preservation of institutions. 
First, the institution of the family is set up as the supreme ob- 
ject of life in China. Secondly, the division of labor (the voca- 
tions of life) is made the basis of caste, which is the chief con- 
cern of the Hindoo, Then the renunciation of all concrete life 
for the sake of monastic institutions is the requirement of the 
third species of “ passive education,” as found in Central Asia, 
and more or less in Ceylon and Farther India.] 
I. Family Education. 
$185. The family is the organic starting-pcint of all 
education. The nation looks upon itself as a family. 
Among all uncivilized people education is family edu- 
cation, though they are not conscious of its necessity. 
Identical in principle with these people, but distin- 
guished from them through the fact that it is conscious 
of it, the Chinese nation, in its laws, regulations, and 
customs, has established the family as the absolute basis 
of its life, and the only principle of its education. 
[The “organic starting-point of all education” is the family. 
that is to say, the family is the institution that most resembles 
a product of Nature; it arises through the natural relations of
-P-A-G-E-222
THE SYSTEM OF PASSIVE EDUCATION. 197 
sex and parentage on the one hand, and through the necessary 
ethical laws that’ perfect and secure these natural relations on 
the other hand. The first form of the nation is a direct out- 
growth of the family. The tribe is patriarchal in its organiza- 
tion. The first collection of tribes into a nation retains the same 
form. The Chinese nation (437,000,000 of people !) is a vast fam- 
ily of families. Mere tribes can not be civilized because they 
have to devote their entire attention to protecting their narrow 
borders from neighboring tribes. When these tribes are united 
into a great nation the border-land recedes, and all classes of 
people may devote themselves to productive industry.] 
$186. The natural element of the family is found in 
marriage and kinship; the spiritual element, in love. 
We may call the nature of family feeling, which is the 
immediate unity of both elements, by the Latin name 
of pietas. In so far as this appears not merely as a sub- 
stantial feeling, but at the same time as conseious rule of 
action, there arises from it the subordination involved 
in the implicit obedience of the wife to the husband, of 
children to the parents, of the younger children to the 
elder. In this obedience man first renounces his will- 
fulness and his natural selfishness; he learns to master 
his passions, and to conduct himself with deferential 
gentleness. 
When the principle that governs the family is transferred to po- 
litical relations, there arises the tyranny of the Chinese state, which 
can not be fully treated here. We find everywhere in if an analogi- 
cal relation to that of parents and children. In China the ruler is 
the father and mother of the people; the civil officers are represent- 
atives of a paternal authority, etc. It follows that in school the chil- 
dren will be ranked according to their age. The authority of parents 
over children is absolute, but its exercise is in point of fact very mild. 
The abandonment of daughters by the poorest classes in the great 
cities is no instance to the contrary, for the government rears the 
children in foundling asylums, where they are cared for by nurses 
appointed by the state.

§ 187. These relations which are conditioned by na

We find in such moral sentences the substance of what is called, 
in China, philosophy. 
[The family preserves itself by a code of observances con- 
stituting a ceremonial or system of etiquette which forms the 
chief part of education. How to behave, is the important ques- 
tion. For details regarding the rules of etiquette in China, see 
Hegel’s “ Philosophy of History.” Five mutual duties named 
in the Shu-King as fundamental, (1) between the emperor and 
his people ; (2) between parents and children; (8) between elder 
and younger brothers; (4) between husband and wife; (5) be- 
tween friend and friend. “The son may not accost the father 
when he comes into the room; he must seem to contract himself 
to nothing at the side of the door, and may not leave the room 
without his father’s permission.” The same obedience must be 
shown to the elder brother. The son does not receive honor for 
his meritorious deeds; they are attributed to his father. The 
school flourishes there because it is the road to all preferment in 
the state. The Chinese alphabet has a separate sign for each 
word, and has to be mastered by an enormou: ~

with maxims relating to etiquette and beliakiufy fae have to ppe : 
memorized, words, characters, and alt, Strict Pr aaiced 
held to sift out the incompetent and adaiit the competent to a : 
higher course of study. The third grade of examination is held 
by the chancellor of the province twice in’ “thie: ‘years, and suc: we 
cessful candidates receive the degree of Bloohite Talent (B. Ce 
instead of B.A, /), and are qualified for primary teachers, lawyers, 
notaries public, or physicians, The fourth examinatiori ‘is held 
at the capital of the province and under the direction of twa 
imperial examiners sent from Pekin. In some instances as 
many as twenty thousand “blooming talents” attend this ex- 
amination, but only one in a hundred of the candidates is suc- 
cessful in obtaining the degree of “ Licentiate.” The licentiates 
may enter the fifth and highest examination held in the Im- 
perial Palace at Pekin, and if they pass are entitled at once to 
membership in the Imperial Academy and a salary for life. 
This academy furnishes committees of counsel to whom the 
emperor refers all difficult matters for consideration and report. 
These five sifting examinations have at last obtained as net 
result the men best fitted of all for carrying on the Chinese 
government in the prescribed path, for they have had not 
only to learn by heart the five classics of Confucius, filled with 
maxims of family piety and patriarchal etiquette, but they have 
had to prove in the final examination that they understand and 
are able to defend the doctrines on which the government is 
founded. In the first and second examinations only verbal 
memory is tested and no insight required. The minute details 
of Chinese education are of importance to us as proving clearly 
the function of the exclusive education of the memory. Con- 
servative people without aspiration and firmly bound to the 
established order of things can be produced without fail by 
schools that lay great stress on verbal memory (e. g., “learning by 
heart” the capricious orthography of the English spelling-book, 
historical dates, geographical names, arithmetical tables, etc., 
ete,).] 
§ 188. The theoretical education includes reading, 
writing—i. e., painting the letters with a brush—arith- 
metic, and the making of verses. But these accomplish- 
ments are not looked at as means of culture, but as 
   
-P-A-G-E-225

qualifications for official position. The Chinese possess 
formally all the means for literary culture—printing, 
libraries, schools, and academies; but the extent to 
‘swhich these appliances are used is not great. Their 
value has been often overrated because of their external 
resemblance to those found among us. 
[The effort requisite to learn the Chinese alphabet is sufficient 
to commit to memory all the Chinese classics. Hence, the library 
is not so important in that country as in Europe and America, 
where one may learn to read with so little trouble. Hence, too, 
the obstacle in the way of original literary production.] 
Il. Caste Education. 
§189. The members of the family, as a matter of 
course, differ from each other in sex and age, but this 
difference is entirely immaterial as far as the nature 
of their employment goes. In China, therefore, every 
position is open to each man; he who is of humblest 
birth in the great state-family can climb to the highest 
honor. But the next step in the development of the 
state, as an institution, is that on which the division of 
labor is made the principle, and a new distinction added 
to that of the family: each one shall perfect himself 
only in that labor which was allotted to him as his own 
through his birth into a particular family. This fatal- 
ism (the distinction of caste) breaks up the life, but in- 
creases the social tension, by the necessary mutual de- 
pendence that flows from the division of labor; for 
human civilization moves on the one hand toward the 
deepening of its distinctions ; on the other, toward lead- 
ing them back into the unity which continually works 
against the natural tendency to fix human activity in ruts
-P-A-G-E-226
IE THE SYSTEM OF PASSIVE EDUCATION. 204 
[Distinction of caste imposes a new yoke on the individual, 
The highest preferment-is not open to each as in the family 
state; in India, the station of life is absolutely determined by 
birth. If born a Brahman, he may be a religious teacher, and 
the object of unbounded reverence on the part of the other 
tastes. There are warriors and merchants and common labor- 
ers, besides many mixed castes founded on intermarriages, The 
members of the lowest castes are far more degraded and brutally 
treated than the negro slaves of the West India Islands.] 
§190. The chief work of education thus consists in 
teaching each one the rights and duties of his caste so 
that he shall observe their precise limits, and not pollute 
himself by passing beyond them. As the family-state 
concerns itself with fortifying the distinctions founded 
on nature by a far-reaching and vigorous ceremonial, so 
the caste-state must do the same with the distinctions of 
caste. A painful etiquette becomes more and more ex- 
acting in its requisitions, the higher the caste, in order 
to make the isolation more sharply defined and more 
perceptible. 
This feature penetrates all exclusively caste-education. All aris- 
tocracy exiles itself on this account from its native country, speaks a 
foreign language and loves its literature, adopts foreign customs, 
lives in foreign countries—in Italy, Paris, ete. In this way man be- 
comes “distinguished.” But that he should strive thus tq “ distin- 
guish” himself has its ultimate ground in the accident of his birth, 
and this is assuredly always the principle of the caste-state in which 
it is to be found in its most perfect form. The castes require gene- 
alogical records, which are of the greatest: importance in determining 
the destiny of the individual. The Brahman may strike dead one of 
a lower caste who has defiled him by contact, without becoming 
thereby liable to punishment; he would be regarded as criminal, in 
fact, if he neglected to kill him. Thus it was formerly with the 
officer who did not immediately kill the citizen or common soldier 
whe struck him a blow. 
[Education consists chiefly in teaching the etiquette and cere- 
monies proper to one’s caste, To omit one of these observances
-P-A-G-E-227
202 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
is to become defiled, and requires a complicated ceremony of 
purification. The Chinese etiquette is very simple compared 
with that of India: “ The Brahman must rest on a particular foot 
when rising; read the Vedas, each word separately, or doubling 
them alternately, or forward and backward; must. not look at 
the sun when rising or setting, nor at its reflection in the water; 
must not step over a rope at which a calf is fastened, nor go 
out when it rains; must not look at his wife when she eats, or 
when she sneezes; must not step on ashes, cotton-seeds, or 
broken crockery,” ete, etc. One of the lowest caste may be 
struck dead if he comes in the way of a Brahman; if he hears the 
Vedas read, he must have melted lead poured into his ears, ete] 
§ 191. The East Indian education is far deeper and 
richer than the Chinese. Its theoretical instruction also 
includes reading, writing, and arithmetic; but these are 
subordinate, as mere means for the higher activities of 
poetry, speculation, science, and art. The practical edu- 
cation limits itself strictly by the lines of caste, and since 
the caste system constitutes a whole in itself, and each 
for its permanence needs the others, it can not forbear 
giving utterance suggestively to what is universally hu- 
man in the soul, in a multitude of fables (Hitopadesa) 
and apothegms (sentences of Bartrihari), especially in- 
tended for the education of princes, and furnishing a 
sort of mirror of the world. 
Xenophon’s Cyropedia is not Greek but Indian in its plan. 
(The Brahman caste may be said to be devoted to religious lit- 
erature and worship. Through them have arisen epic and dra- 
matic poems, systems of philosophy, science, and art. The Hito- 
padesa is the Indian AXsop, and contains a multitude of fables 
for the instruction of the sons of a king. They are ingeniously 
interwoven, The animals of one fable relate other fables, The 
pigeon relates to the crow the fable of the tiger and the trav- 
eler; the king of the mice relates the fable of the deer, the jackal, 
and the crow; the crow relates the fable of the blind vulture 
the cat, and the birds, ete.]

THE SYSTEM OF PASSIVE EDUCATION. 203 
IIL. Monkish Education. 
§ 192. Family education demands unconditional 
obedience toward parents and toward all who stand in 
an analogous position. Caste-education demands un- 
zonditional obedience to the duties of the caste. The 
family punishes with the rod; the caste, by excommuni- 
cation, by loss of honor. The negative tendency against 
nature appears in both systems in the form of a strict 
ceremonial, distinguishing between the differences aris- 
ing from nature. The family as well as the caste has 
within it a fountain of manifold activity, but it has also 
just as manifold a limitation of the individual. The 
impulse toward higher civilization is forced, therefore, 
to turn against nature in general. It must become in- 
different to the family. But it must also oppose the 
social order, and the fixed distinctions of division of 
labor as necessitated by nature. It must become indif- 
ferent to labor and the fruits derived from it. That it 
may not be conditioned either by nature or by human 
civilization, it denies both, and makes its action to con- 
sist in producing an abstinence from all action. 
[Monkish education “turns against nature” altogether, and 
does not, like the family and the caste, lay emphasis on differences 
arising from nature (such as sex, age, birth, hereditary descent, 
ete). Labor, and even the fruits of labor, are a matter of in- 
difference to it. The activity of Buddhism is directed toward 
abstention from activity. Here the passive education culmi- 
nates.] 
§ 193. Such an indifference toward nature and the 
social order produces the education which we have 
called monkish. Those who perpetuate the race, care 
for food, clothing, and shelter, and for these material,
-P-A-G-E-229
204 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
contributions, as the laity, receive in return from thos¢ 
who live this contemplative life the spiritual reward of 
participation in the blessings which wait upon ascetic 
contemplation. The family institution as well as the 
institution of human labor is subordinated to the abstract 
isolation of the cloister, in which the individual lives 
only for the purification of his soul. All things are 
justified by this end. Castes are found no more; only 
those are bound to the observance of a special ceremonial 
who as nuns or monks subject themselves to uncondi- 
tional obedience to the rules of the cloister, these rules 
solemnly enjoining on the negative side celibacy and 
cessation from business, and on the positive side prayer 
and performance of ceremonial rites. 
{Such a system requires a distinction of the people into laity 
and monks. For with Buddhist monks alone the race would 
soon perish, The laity supply the material wants of the monks, 
and keep up the race. The dreadful oppression of ceremonial 
which prevails in Chinese etiquette and Hindoo observance of 
easte is avoided in Buddhism. All is simplified. There are 
three hundred million Buddhists scattered over China, Farther 
India, Ceylon, and among the Mongolians of Siberia. In China 
Buddhism takes on an essentially modified form: it does not 
replace the family principle as in Thibet.] 
§ 194. In the school of the Chinese Tao-tse, and in 
the command to the Brahman after he has established 
a family to become a hermit, we find the transition as 
it actually exists to the Buddhistic quietism which has 
covered the rocky heights of Thibet with countless 
cloisters, and reared the people who are dependent upon 
it into a, child-like amiability, into a contented repose. 
Art and science have here no value in themselves, and 
are regarded only.as ministering to religion. To be able 
to read, in order to mutter the prayers, is desirable
-P-A-G-E-230
IIE GOODS CO ALA, eT, THE SYSTEM OF PASSIVE EDUCATION. 205 
With the conscious purpose of the monk to reduce self 
to nothing, as the highest good, the system of passive 
education attains its highest point. But civilization can 
not content itself with this abstract and dreamy absence 
of all action, though it demands a high stage of cult- 
ure; it has recourse therefore to action, partly on the 
positive side to conquer nature, partly to double its own 
existence by building up human institutions. Inspired 
with affirmative courage, it descends triumphantly from 
the mountain-heights, and fears secularization no more. 
_ [In Thibet every father who has four sons must dedicate one 
of them to monastic life, The supreme object of life among the 
Buddhists where Lamaism prevails—for Lamaism is a political 
form, not at all coextensive with Buddhism as a religion—is to 
attain the elevated spiritual condition of the monastic order. 
Failing in this highest object, the people strive to share in the di- 
vine favors dispensed or obtained by the priests. The Buddhistic 
view of the world is in sharp contrast with the Christian view, 
although its monasticism as weil as its ceremonial has a close 
external resemblance to the forms of the Catholic Church; and, - 
in fact, Lamaism may have borrowed its ceremonial from East- 
em Christians in the eighth century or later. The Buddhist 
seeks nirvana, or the absolute repose of being; a state in which 
he is freed not only from all earthly cares and distracting 
thoughts, but also from all cares and thoughts of whatever 
description. In fact, while Christianity seeks deliverance from 
selfishness, Buddhism seeks deliverance from selfhood, and aims 
to lose all consciousness, as the Sankhya doctrine of India, which 
is apparently the root of Buddhist theology, plainly teaches. 
Tn this respect the “ passive” education comes most strongly into 
contrast with the “active” education. The former seeks to free 
itself from evil by passively renouncing not only all action, but 
life itself. The latter strives to conquer evil by action, and edu. 
vates to a life which helps itself by helping others.}

CHAPTER IIL 
> SECOND GROUP.—-THE SYSTEM OF ACTIVE EDUCATION. 
§ 195. Acrivz education elevates man from his com- 
plete subjection to the family, caste, and asceticism, into 
a concrete activity guided by a definite aim which sub- 
ordinates those institutions into means of its own devel- 
opment, and grants to cach independence on condition 
of its perfect accord with the spirit of the whole. These 
aims are the military state, the future condition after 
death, and industry. There is always an element of 
nature present, which gives occasion to the activity ; but 
this no longer appears, like the family, the caste, the 
egoistic personal seclusion of the cloister, as immedi- 
ately dwelling within the individual, but as something 
outside of himself which limits him; and yet, as his 
destined career has an internal relation to him, is es- 
sential to him and assigns to him the object of his 
activity. The Persian has for his object of conquest, 
other nations; the Egyptian, death; the Phcenician, 
the sea. 
[Active education in contrast to passive education directs its 
efforts outward with a view to accomplish some new conquest. 
Passive education was conservative, and aimed to crush out in- 
dividuality by imposing on it burdensome codes of etiquette, 
ceremonies, and moral order. Active education has the opposite 
tendency. The Persian strives to prepare his youth for military 
conquest, The Phoenician educates for foreign commerce, the 
perils of the sea and hostile lands. The Egyptian makes this 
life a preparation for immortality, building gigantic tombs, and 
embalming the corporeal hull of the soul, so that it may serve 
its purpose again at the resurrection.]

I. Military Education. 
§ 196. That education which would emancipate a 
nation from the passivity of isolation and one-sided de- 
velopment must throw it into a process of intercourse 
with other forms of civilization. A nation does not 
find its real limits in its territorial boundaries; it can 
leave its habitat and seek a new and distant one. Its 
true limit is made by another nation. The nation which 
feels its own genuine substantiality turns itself there 
fore against other nations in order to subject them and 
to reduce them to thé condition of mere accidents of it- 
self as substance. It begins a system of conquest which 
has in itself no limitations, but goes from one nation to 
another, and extends its course indefinitely. The final 
result of this attack on other nations is that it combines 
them against it, and is in its turn invaded and conquered. 
The early history of the Persian is twofold: the patriarchal in 
the high valleys of Iran, and the religio-hierarchical among the 
Medes. We find under these circumstances a repetition of the prin- 
cipal characteristics of the Chinese, Indian, and Buddhist education ; 
even the Indian is included, because in ancient Zend there were alsc 
castes. Among the Persians themselves, as they descended from 
their mountains to the conquest of other nations, there was properly 
only a military nobility. The priesthood was subjected to the royal 
power which represented the concrete might of the nation. Of the 
Persian kings, Cyrus attacked Western Asia; Cambyses, Africa; 
Darius and Xerxes, Europe; until at last the reaction of the spirit- 
ually higher nationality of Greece did not content itself with mere 
self-protection, but under the Macedonian Alexander returned the 
attack upon Persia itself. . 
[Intercourse with foreign nations is the prime source of na- 
tional activity. The Persian desires to establish an uncondi- 
tioned empire. To do this he must reduce to submission the 
tribes and states that border on his frontier. Out of the Hu

phrates Valicy in earlier times the Chaldeans and Assyrians had 
made inroads upon the separate branches of the Aryan race, 
which are now united and form the Persian Empire. On the 
north and east the Mongolian tribes menaced the peace of his 
border-land. Under Cyrus the valley of the Euphrates, and 
later, all Syria and Asia Minor are subdued; under Cambyses, 
Egypt. But the Persian can not annihilate border-lands, al- 
though he removes them thousands of miles from his capital. 
Beyond Asia lies Europe. Greece contains another Aryan peo- 
ple in whom are beginning the impulses toward a new civiliza- 
tion far more favorable to individual development than anything 
that has yet appeared. Darius and Xerxes attempt to conquer 
this new limit, but fail at last. Greece, aroused by the contest, 
and learning to know its own power, returns the attack in the 
following century, and all the territory that Persia had conquered 
yields to Alexander and his generals.] 
§ 197. Education enjoined upon the Persians (1) to 
speak the truth; (2) to learn to ride horseback, and to 
use the bow and arrow. There is implied in the first 
command a recognition and acknowledgment of the re- 
ality of things and events, the negation of all dreamy 
absorption, of all fantastical vagueness ; and in this light 
the Persian, in contrast with the Hindoo, appears to be 
sober and reasonable. In the second command is im. 
plied warlike practice, but as yet that of the nomadic 
tribes. The Persian fights on horseback, and thus ap- 
pears in contrast to the Indian hermit-seclusion and the 
quietism of the Lamas as restless and in constant motion. 
The family increases in value as it rears a large number of war- 
tiors. To have many children was a blessing. The King of Persia 
gave a premium for all children over a certain number. Nations 
were assembled as nations for war; hence the immense multitude of 
a Persian army. Everything—family, business, possessions—must 
be regardlessly sacrificed to the one aim of war. Education, there- 
fore, cultivated an unconditional obedience to the king; the slightest 
inclination to assert an individual independence was high treason

and was punished with death. In China, on the contrary, duty to 
the family is paramount to duty to the state, or rather is itself duty 
to the state. The civil officer who mourns the loss of one of his 
family is released during the period of mourning from the duties 
of his function. 
[The education of the Persians is said to have laid great stress 
on (1) speaking truth, and (2) learning to ride horseback, and use 
the bow and arrow. To speak the truth implies a respect for 
the facts and events of the world as they are. Under the pas- 
sive peoples there prevailed a greater respect for human ordi- 
nances, etiquette, caste, etc. ‘The Hindoo looked upon ail 
nature as pure illusion—a sort of dream which is imposed upon 
man because of his fallen condition. East Indian poetry gives 
rein to the imagination, and allows truth to interpose no limits 
to its exaggerations. Hence truth-speaking seems to have great 
significance. It could not be encouraged among people who 
despised real facts and events and held in contempt all ex- 
istence. We must not, however, count the civilizations of 
Brahminism and Buddhism as of no value, They are immense 
steps in advance of mere tribal civilization. In his first step 
away from mere savage life man exaggerates the importance of 
ethical usages and despises in a corresponding degree the facts 
and events of Nature. In mere tribal life the savage fears 
Nature, and has no peace from its inconstancy and dreadful 
might, After long progress he comes to revere human social 
order as superior. The members of the family are supple- 
mented and rendered equal by mutual help, so that infancy, old 
age, sickness, calamity, and sex are robbed of their special ter- 
rors. “The state performs a similar service in insuring the in- 
dividual against vicissitude, and especially against violence from 
mankind, Civil society protects the individual from famine, in 
case of failure of crops in one particular locality, But notwith- 
standing the importance of social order, the nations of Eastern 
Asia go to extremes in their reverence for it, The Western 
Asiatic nations, whom Rosenkranz calls “active nations,” cor- 
tect this one-sidedness in various ways. The Persian trained 
his youth carefully in observing accurately the exact state of 
facts and events by insisting on scrupulous statements, He 
taught him to ride horseback and use the bow and arrow. Heré 
the state as such became the most important institution, whereas

in China the family, in India the divisions of civil society, in 
Thibet the church, were most important.] 
$198. The theoretical education, which was limited 
to reading, writing, and to instruction in religious cere- 
monial, was in the hands of the magi, the number of 
whom was estimated at eighty thousand, and who them- 
selves had enjoyed the advantages of a careful education, 
as is shown by their gradation into Herbeds, Mobeds, and 
Destur-mobeds, i.e., into apprentices, journeymen, and 
masters. The very fundamental idea of their religion 
was military; it demanded of man to fight on the side 
of the king of light, and guard against the princes of 
darkness and evil. It gave to him the honor of a free 
position between the world-moving powers and thus the 
possibility of a self-chosen career, by which means vigor 
and chivalrous feeling were developed. Religion di- 
rected the activity of man toward the realities on this 
planet, making it its object to increase the dominion of 
the good, by purifying the water, by planting trees, by 
extirpating troublesome wild beasts. Thus it increased 
bodily comfort, and no longer, like the monk, treated 
this as a mere negative affair. 
[The Magi, a separate tribe, said to number eighty thousand, 
furnished the teachers of reading, writing, and religion. They 
had three degrees of advancement in culture among them—ap- 
prentice, journeyman, and master (Herbed, Mobed, and Destur- 
mobed), The religion of China has a family character—the wor- 
ship of ancestors; the religion of Old Persia has a character tend- 
ing to promote the interests of the state—a military tendency. 
Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd), the good spirit, fights against Angra- 
Mainya (Ahriman), the evil spirit, The Persian religion teaches 
that life is a warfare, and that all good men must fight on the side 
of Ormuzd, the king of light. It was enjoined by religion to eon- 
quer the desert by pianting trees and digging wells and increas- 
ing bodily comfort, This is in contrast to the spirit of Buddhism.]

Il. Priestly Education. 
§ 199. War achieves its purpose through its capacity 
to inflict death. Jt deals out death, and by its means 
decides who shall serve and who obey. But the nation 
that finds its activity in war, though it makes death the 
servant of its purpose, yet finds its own limit in death. 
Other nations are only its boundaries, which it can pass 
over by fighting with and conquering them. But death 
itself it can never escape, whether it come in the sands 
of the desert—that buried for Cambyses an army which 
he sent to the oracle of the Libyan Ammon—or in the 
sea, that scorns the rod * of the angry despot, or by the 
sword of the free man + who guards his household gods. 
On this account, a people stands higher that in the midst 
of life reflects on death, or rather lives for it. The edu- 
cation of such a nation must be priestly, because death 
is the means of the transition to the future life, and con- 
sequently it, like birth, becomes a sacrament. The fam- 
ily-state, the caste-state, the monkish-state, and the mili- 
tary-state are not hierarchies in the sense that the 
national life is directed by a priesthood. But in Egypt 
this was actually the case, because the chief educational 
tribunal was the death-court which judged only the 
dead, awarding to them or denying them the honor of 
burial as the result of their whole life. Its award, how- 
ever, affected also the honor of the surviving family. 
[War is directed against the limits of national sovereignty. 
Death is a natural iimit to life. War succeeds because it deals 
out death to the enemy. While the Persian directs his energies

against the limit of the state, the Egyptian occupies himseli 
with the consideration of the supreme limit of life itself. The 
leading idea of Egyptian civilization seems to be the prepara- 
tion for death. The death-court that decided upon the merits 
of the life of each individual at his decease furnished che most 
important educative influence in the land. It established an 
ideal standard of living and gave daily illustrations of its appli- 
eation to particular examples. Those who approximated this 
ideal were awarded the honor of being embalmed—they were 
considered fit to dwell with Osiris in the “still kingdom of 
Amenti.” The priestly caste in Egypt were the teachers.] 
§ 200. General education here limited itself to read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. Special education con- 
sisted properly only in training the youth for a definite 
vocation within the circle of the family. In this fruit- 
ful and warm land the expense of supporting children 
was very small. The division into classes was without 
the cruel features of the Indian civilization, and life 
itself in the narrow valley of the Nile was very social, 
abounding in festivities, and in eating and drinking, and 
was brave and cheerful, because the familiarity with 
death heightened the force of enjoyment. In a stricter 
sense only, the warriors, the priests, and the kings had 
an education. The aim of life, which was to determine 
at death its eternal future, to secure for itself a passage 
into the still kingdom of Amenti, manifested itself ex- 
ternally in the care which they expended on the pres- 
ervation of the dead hull of the immortal soul, and on 
this account devoted its temporal life to building tombs 
to last an eternity. The Chinese builds a wall to secure 
his family-state from attack ; the Hindoo builds pagodas 
for his gods; the Buddhist erects for himself monastic 
cells; the Persian constructs in Persepolis the tomb of 
his kings, where they may retire in the evening of their

lives after they have rioted in Ecbatana, Babylon, and 
- Susa; but the Egyptian builds his own tomb, and ear- 
ries on war only to protect it. 
[The Egyptian finds it possible to conquer Nature and make it 
serve him. He builds canals and dikes to regulate the over- 
flow of the Nile, and thereby get the utmost service from the 
fertilizing power of the fine soil that the river brings down ip 
him from the mountains at the south. Observation of Nature, 
necessary for the purpose of utilizing the Nile freshets, leads him 
toa knowledge of astronomy, the construction of calendars, and 
to hydraulic engineering. He understands irrigation, the con- 
struction of canals, dams, and reservoirs, He invents the science 
of geometry, so far as it is required in surveying, because he has 
to recover his farm every year after the inundation, and fix anew 
its boundaries. Farms on the banks of the river are liable to be 
washed away by new channels cut through by freshets, or the 
old landmarks may be covered up or destroyed; hence he is 
led to a more careful system of laws on the subject of landed 
property, the rights and privileges appertaining to its use and 
its ownership. Egypt invents writing by hieroglyphics, and 
develops out of it two other systems, the syllabic and alphabetic, 
The priestly caste taught arithmetic, geometry, surveying and 
mensuration, civil engineering, reading and writing and music 
to youth of their own caste as well as to the caste of warriors. 
Plato, however, tells us that the children of the Egyptians were 
taught to read in classes, Diodorus says that even the artisans 
were taught to read. Perhaps this was necessary to the numer- 
ous artisans who engraved inscriptions on the temples and 
tombs. We learn that arithmetic was taught by means of 
games and plays, such as trading pieces of money, guessing at 
the number of grains of wheat held in the hand, or by arrang- 
ing pupils in military lines, The cost of living was so cheap 
that four dollars in our money would have supported a single 
individual until twenty years of age.]

of the Red Sea to the foot of the Lebanon Mountains 
on the Mediterranean, and ventured forth upon the sea 
which before that time all nations had avoided as a dan- 
gerous and destructive element. The Phoenician was 
industrial, and needed markets where he could dispose 
of the products of his skill. But while he sought for 
them he disdained neither force nor deceit: he planted 
colonies ; he stipulated that he should have in the cities 
of other nations quarters for himself; he induced the 
nations to adopt articles of luxury, and insensibly intro- 
duced among them his culture and even his religion. 
The education of such a nation must have seemed pro- 
fane, because it fostered indifference toward family and 
one’s native land, and made restless and even passionate 
activity subservient to gain. The practical understand- 
ing and utilitarianism rose to a high dignity. 
[The Phoenician resembles the other active peoples in having 
for his supreme aim the conquest of a limit to his being. In- 
dustry aims to conquer Nature in so far as it limits our lives in 
the form of three wants—food, clothing, and shelter. In order 
to overcome these completely, man must lay under contribution 
all lands and all climates. One locality compensates for the de- 
ficiencies of another. Commerce, then, is the form of industry 
that aids most effectively the conquest over Nature. The Pheeni- 
cian leaves his home and braves the ocean. Education must be of 
such a character that it will wean the youth from love of home. 
Tyre, Sidon, Byblus, Berytus, Tripolis, Aradis, were places of 
great security on the land side, while they afforded security 
for shipping on the seaward side, Manufactures of metallic 
goods, glass, linen textures dyed with the wonderful Tyrian 
purple, furnished the home productions with which to obtain 
the coveted articles of foreign peoples. Tin from Cornwall, 
amber from the Baltic, gold-dust from Western Africa, were 
brought home and used in manufactures. Trains of loaded 
camels pierced the deserts and arrived at the great cities on the 
Euphrates. Phoenician colonies settled Cyprus, Crete, Carthage,

Gades (Cadiz). The Phoenician carried the alphabetic writing 
of Egypt to all parts of Europe, for in commerce writing is in- 
dispensable.] 
§ 202. Of the education of the Pheenicians we know 
only so much as to enable us to conclude that it was 
certainly various and extensive: among the Carthagini- 
ans, at least, that their children were practiced in read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic, in religious duties; sec- 
ondly, in a trade; and, finally, in the use of arms. 
Commerce became with the Phoenicians their chief oc- 
cupation, and self-interest made them brave to plow the 
inhospitable sea and, led by curiosity, penetrate the 
horror of its vast distances, but yet conceal from other 
nations their discoveries and wrap them in a veil of 
fable. 
It is a beautiful testimony to the quality of the Greek mind that 
Plato and others assign as a cause of the low state of arithmetic and 
mathematics among the Phoenicians and Egyptians the want of free 
and disinterested investigation. 
{Education assumes a utilitarian character for a commercial 
people—especially arithmetic and penmanship form the com- 
mercial arts. Inasmuch as affection for home and parents 
would injure the quality of the sailor, education rooted out this 
affection, The fearful worship of Moloch, the fire-god, to whom 
they sacrificed children, laying them in his red-hot arms in the 
presence of mothers who were not permitted to express their 
pain by cries was a powerful means of educating parental and 
filial indifference necessary to produce a population of commer- 
cial adventurers. Their religious rites thus assisted to form the 
national character. Not only arithmetic and writing, but eun- 
ning and deceit were taught, as necessary for skillful bargains,]

and its bravery, only for its peculiarity as such does it

claim value, and in the effort to secure this it is ready 
to hazard life itself. In its naturally growing existence 
this individuality is deep, but at the same time without 
self-limit. The nations educate themselves to this in. 
dividuality when they destroy the Roman world—that 
of self-limit and balance—-which they find. 
[Individuality contains both passivity and activity. Rosen- 
kranz understands by “individual education” that education 
which has for its sole aim the development of the individual, 
instead of seeking an external object for which it subordinates 
the individual. It desires not to have, but to de. The phases of 
“individual” education are three: (a) esthetic education, which 
seeks to make a work of art out of man; it develops into a love of 
truth, and finally sets aside seeming for being ; (b) practical edu- 
cation, that of Rome, deals not with the beautiful nor with the 
true, but with the realization of the will in its essence. The 
will of man is not revealed in caprice and arbitrariness, nor in 
mere customary usages, The essential forms are embodied in 
Jaws of justice and in rights. For these express what is and may 
be universal—the common ground of all particular volitions. 
Violate the law, and each man’s deed is against the deeds of all 
other men. Without law the aggregate action of man tends 
toward self-nullification. The Roman principle in the world- 
history concerns the discovery and enunciation of the just self- 
limitation of will, and it has bequeathed to the world the code 
of laws and forms of municipal government which make possi- 
ble modern civilization. The Greek has left us the ideal stand- 
ard of the beautiful and the statement of the true, as well as the 
form of its investigation. Each of these activities involves the 
culture of the individual: (a) the graceful body; (b) the de 
veloped intellect; (c) the formation of character. The Greek 
individuality is undermined by the discovery of the principle of 
truth as higher than beauty. The Roman principle is undei- 
mined by the conquest of all nations; its success destroys it by 
removing the tension which had existed against other nations, 
and which had. helped it to form the Roman character. It now 
encounters the third phase of individuality—that of the Gothic 
or Teutonic nations, These northern peoples do not make special
-P-A-G-E-243
218 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
individuality their object either in the form of the beautiful, of the 
true, or of the firm and just character. They make general indi- 
viduality their object, without any special aims, or with any and 
all aims. Individuality of this sort is called “demonic” by 
Rosenkranz, because it does not consider any other motives than 
recognition of the peculiar self of the individual, counting as 
naught all possessions, wisdom, justice, sacred ordinances, and 
demanding recognition solely. This trait of the Gothic race re- 
appears always when its individuals settle on a border-land or 
resort to partisan warfare, The chieftains of the Scottish bor- 
der-land, the Norse sea-kings, the Crusaders, the knights of 
Charlemagne, the Cid—even the “cow-boy” desperadoes of our 
own border-land—exhibit this supreme love of individuality for 
its own sake. Rome conquered the northern peoples, and then 
taught them civil law and military tactics, ‘They then assumed 
the mastership of the world, and modern history begins.] 
Il. 2£sthetic Education. 
§ 204, The system of individual education begins 
with the transfiguration of the immediate individuality 
into beauty. On the side of nature this system is pas- 
sive, for individuality is given through nature; but on 
the side of spirit it is active, for spirit must determine 
to restrain itself within limits as the essence of beauty. 
{ 2isthetic individuality involves a passive side, in so far as it 
presupposes the body as an organic product of nature. It pro- 
ceeds to cultivate its natural gifts by training through gymnas- 
tics, and this is its active side. Self-control, manifested physical- 
ly, produces what we call gracefulness, and gracefulness is the 
Greek ideal of beauty. It may be defined as the bodily mani- 
festation of freedom. Every limb of a Greek statue seems to be 
posed as it is because the soul within thus wills it. “Self- 
limitation” is a characteristic of Greek character—moderation, 
the golden mean, being its manifestation.] 
§ 205. Here the individual is of value only in so far 
ag he is beautiful. At first beauty is apprehended az
-P-A-G-E-244
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 219 
natural, but secondly it is carried over into the realm of 
spirit (i. e., into the institutions of civilization), and the 
good is posited as identical with the beautiful. The 
ideal of esthetic education demands always that there 
shall be also an eternal unity of the good with the 
beautiful, of spirit with Nature. 
We can not here give in detail the history of Greek education. 
It is the best known among us, and the literature in which it is 
worked out is very extensive. ... We must content ourselves with 
mentioning the chief epochs which follow from the nature of its 
principle. 
{The beautiful was first realized in the living bodies of ath- 
letes (the “natural” phase of the beautiful), In the next place 
it was realized in social forms, civil and political. The “natu- 
ral” phase of the beautiful was developed in the games. There 
were the great national games: the Olympian, celebrated once in 
four years; the Isthmian, once in two years; the Nemean, once 
in two years; the Pythian, once in four years; so that nearly 
every year there was a great national celebration in which it 
was determined who of all Greece should carry off the prize at 
wrestling, boxing, and throwing the discus, the spear, or the 
javelin; who could excel at running, leaping, the chariot-race, 
or the horseback-race. The preparation for these great national 
festivals took place in every village in the land every week and 
every day. The daily labor for the necessities of life was all 
well enough, but the Greek considered games of far greater im- 
portance. Games were in fact his highest religious ceremonies. 
For he believed that his gods were supremely beautiful human 
forms, in whose likeness human beings were intended to be. 
The games were instituted to celebrate this likeness of man to 
the gods as well as to develop and increase this likeness. The 
people attended these games and in time each and all became 
good judges of what is beautiful and graceful in human form 
just as a community that attends horse-races comes to know at a 
glance the good points of a horse. Neighboring villages unite 
for more general games on special occasions. Then the entire 
state has its festival. The victors in each state go up to those 
great national games founded by heroes and demi-gods in order
-P-A-G-E-245
220 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
to decide their relative claims for the leadership. Among a 
people thus educated as to the living work of art, it became 
possible for such artists to arise as Phidias, Polyeletus, and 
Praxiteles. Their works could be appreciated as never since. 
The perfection in form and gracefulness of carriage reached by 
the victors in the games are fixed for eternity in shapes of stone, 
and no one is considered fully educated in any civilized land 
until he knows something about the Greek ideal of the beauti- 
ful. Greek education has thus resulted in preparing for us one 
phase of the world-education. The statues of gods and demi- 
gods that have come down to us cause our unbounded astonish- 
ment at their perfection of form. It is not their resemblance te 
living bodies, not their anatomical exactness that interests us, 
nor their so-callea “truth to nature,” but their gracefulness and 
serenity, their “classic repose.” Whether these statues represent 
gods and heroes in action or in sitting and reclining postures, 
there is ever present this “repose,” which means indwelling 
vital activity, and not mere rest as opposed to movement. 
They are full of movement, though at rest, and full of repose 
when in violent action. In their activity they manifest con- 
siderate purpose and perfect self-control. The repose is of the 
soul and not a physical repose. Even sitting and reclining 
figures—for example, the so-called Theseus from the Parthenon, 
or the torso of the Belvedere—are replete with will-power in 
every limb, so that the repose is seen to be voluntary self- 
restraint, and not the repose which accompanies the absence of 
vital energy.] 
§ 206. Education was in Greece thoroughly national. 
Education gave to the individual the consciousness that 
he was a Greek and no barbarian, a free man, and so 
subject only to the laws of the state, and not to the ca- 
price of any one person. Thus the nationality was freed 
at once from the despotic unity of the family and from 
the exclusiveness of caste, through the fact that it com- 
bined within itself the manifold talents of individuals 
of different races. Thus the Dorian race held as essen- 
tial, gymnastics ; the Alolians, music; the Ionians, po-
-P-A-G-E-246
etry. The Alolian individuality was absorbed in the 
development of the two others, and the latter unfolded 
an internal antagenism. The education of the Dorian 
race was national education in the fullest sense of the 
word; in it a uniform public education was given to 
all in common, even including the young women; 
among the Ionic race it was also in its subjects taught 
traly national, but in its form it was select and private 
for those belonging to various great families and clans. 
The former, reproducing the Oriental phase of abstract 
unity, educated all in one mold; the latter was the nurs 
ery of particular individualities. 
[Greek education gave the individual the consciousness of 
freedom from the despotism of arbitrary will. The laws were 
the will for all. Neither family nor caste prevailed over the in- 
dividual. Since the Amphictyonic League united the different 
Greek states without consolidating them, the distinctions of in- 
dividuality were preserved. While the Dorian races (of Sparta, 
Argos, and Messenia) held to gymnastics almost exclusively, the 
olians (of Boeotia and Thessaly) cultivated music as of equal 
importance, and the Ionians (of Athens and the islands of the 
Archipelago) included poetry as especially essential. The Dori- 
ans tended toward the Persian form of Orientalism, educating 
all in one mold and repressing individualism. But, as the main 
object of its education was individualism, it contradicted itself 
by forcing all into one type. Especially in Athens we find the 
nursery of individuality in all its peculiarity.} 
§ 207. (1) Education in the heroic age was without 
any systematic arrangement, and left each one perfectly 
free. They told the histories of the adventures of other 
heroes, and by their own deeds.gave material for similar 
histories to others. 
The Greeks began where the last stage of the active system of 
education ended—with piracy and the seizure of women. Swimming 
was a universal practice among the sea-dwelling Greeks, just as In | THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 99)

England—the mistress of the ocean—rowing is the most prominent 
exercise among the students, and for its encouragement public re- 
gattas are held. ‘ 
[In the heroic age education fitted the individual for advent- 
ures, chiefly in the interest of the welfare of Hellas, however. 
Surrounding peoples were called “ barbarians,” and were thought 
to possess no rights that the Greek was bound to respect. The 
heroes belong to the maritime states, and are associated with ad- 
ventures on the sea. Hercules, who seems to have been sug- 
gested by the Phcenician Melkarth, is of a more humane type 
than the Pheenician educational ideal. There is a trace of a sun- 
myth in his twelve labors, showing Oriental origin, and doubtless 
the hero is a reminiscence, through several modifications, of the 
hero Izdubar and the famous god Mar-duk of the Euphrates Val- 
ley (the great “ Tower of Babel” was dedicated to Mar-duk).] 
§ 208. (2) In the period of state-education proper, 
education developed itself systematically; and gym. 
nastics, music, and grammatics, or literary culture, consti- 
tuted the general pedagogical elements. 
[Besides gymnastics and music, grammatics, or study of letters 
and literature, is named as an element of the later education.] 
§ 209. Gymnastics aimed not alone to render the 
body strong and agile, but, far more, to produce in it a 
noble carriage, a dignified and graceful manner of ap- 
pearance. Each one fashioned his body into a living, 
divine statue, and in the public games the nation crowned 
the victor. 
(Note on the Greek relation of dtrns and efemynaas here omitted.) 
[Objects aimed at in gymnastics. See commentary on §§ 204 
and 205.] 
§ 210. It was the task of music, by its rhythm and 
measure, to fill the soul with well-proportioned harmony. 
So highly did the Greeks prize music, and so variously 
did they practice it, that to be a musical man meant the 
same with them as to be a cultivated man with us
-P-A-G-E-248
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 223 
Education in this branch was very painstaking, inas 
much as music exercises a very powerful influence in 
developing discreet behavior and self-possession into a 
graceful naturalness. 
Among the Greeks we find a spontaneous delight in Nature—-a 
.istening to her voices, the tone of which reveals the internal qualities 
of things. In comparison with this tender sympathy of the Greeks 
with Nature-—who heard in the murmur of the fountains, in the 
dashing of the waves, in the rustling of the trees, and in the ery of 
animals, the voice of divine personality—the sight and hearing of the 
Oriental people for Nature is dull. 
[Music expressed to the ear what gracefulness did to the eye— 
asense of rhythm. Rhythm is appearance of an internal meas- 
ure, a principle that regulates and harmonizes external appear- 
ance, The Greek temple was a petrified hymn to the gods 
(Goethe said that architecture is “frozen music”). Music did 
not have the narrow meaning that it possesses in our language. 
It referred to the nine Muses and to all rhythmical culture. In 
Hegel’s “ Philosophy of History” is found the most wonderful 
characterization of the Greeks. The ear with which they list- 
ened to the tones of Nature—murmur of fountains, rustling of 
trees, cries of animals, etc.—revealed to them the spiritual beings 
which they conceived to be behind natural appearances. Tho 
faculty of thus interpreting Nature was called yavrela, as Hegel 
(p. 245, English translation) calls to our attention.} 
§ 211. The stringed instrument, the cithern, was pre- 
ferred by the Greeks to all wind instruments because it 
was not exciting, and allowed the accompaniment of 
recitation or song, i. e., a simultaneous spiritual activity 
on the part of the performer, in poetry. Flute-playing 
was first brought from Asia Minor after the victorious 
progress of the Persian war, and was especially culti- 
vated in Thebes. They sought in vain afterward to 
oppose the wild excitement raised by its influence. 
[The cithern («:6¢pa, pronounced nearly like guitar, which is ita 
modern equivalent) was first preferred. The flute, used after 
a

ward in Thebes, is spoken of by the ancients as dangerous to the 
virtues of the people. Aristotle (‘ Politics,” book viii, chap. vi) 
says, “ The flute is not a moral instrument, but rather one that 
will inflame the passions.” This surprises us.] 
§ 212. Grammar comprehended letters (ypdypara), 
Le., the elements of literary culture, reading and writ- 
ing. Much attention was given to correct expression. 
The fables of Alsop, the Iliad, and the Odyssey, and 
later the tragic poets were read, and partly learned by 
heart. The orators borrowed from them often the orna- 
ment of their commonplace remarks. 
[The favorite reading-books were “ AZsop,” the “Iliad,” and 
“Odyssey,” and later the tragic poets, certainly a rich collection] 
§ 213. (3) The internal growth of what was. peculiar 
to the Grecian state came to an end with the war for 
the Hegemony. Its dissolution began, and the philo- 
sophical period followed the political. The beautiful 
ethical life dissolved before the thoughts of the true, 
beautiful, and good. Individuality developed the habit 
of reflection, and undertook to subject freedom, the ex- 
isting regulations, laws and customs, to the criticism of 
reason, and to inquire whether these were in and for 
themselves universal and necessary. The Sophists, as 
teachers of grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, under- 
took to extend the cultivation of reflection; and this in- 
troduced instability where the moral customs had hith- 
erto obtained unquestioning obedience. Among the 
women, the Hetwre undertook the same revolution ; in 
the place of the wérvia yyrnp appeared the beauty, who 
stood apart from her sex in the consciousness of her 
charms and in the perfection of her varied culture, and 
exhibited herself to the public admiration. The tend- 
ency to idiosyncrasy often approached willfulness, ca
-P-A-G-E-250

price, and whimsicality, and opposition to the national 
moralsense. A Diogenes in a tub became possible; the 
genial but graceful frivolity of an Alcibiades charmed, 
even though it was openly condemned ; a Socrates com- 
pleted the rupture in the popular consciousness, and urged 
upon the system of the old morality the pregnant ques- 
tion, whether virtue could be taught? Socrates worked 
as a philosopher who was at the same time an educator. 
Pythagoras had imposed upon his pupils of both sexes 
the strict and narrow discipline of a common, exactly 
defined manner of living. Socrates, on the contrary, 
freed his disciples—in general, those who conversed 
with him—leading them to the consciousness of their 
own individuality. He introduced a revolution into 
the education of youth in that he taught them, instead . 
of a thoughtless obedience to moral customs, to seek to 
comprehend things and events by their purpose in the 
world, and to rule their actions by deliberate consider- 
ation of ends and aims. Outwardly he conformed to 
the popular standard in politics, and in war (as at Mara- 
thon); but in the direction of his teaching he was sub- 
jective and modern. 
[The Peloponnesian war broke up the internal unity of Greece 
and put an end to the worship of the beautiful. Teachers of 
grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy taught the youth to criticise 
egisting customs and regulations, All simplicity disappeared. 
Individuality approached whimsicality. Socrates completed the 
revolution. He is the first to elevate blind adherence to custom 
to free moral action. He recognizes conscience or individual 
standard of right, and urges each one to rule his actions by re- 
flection upon what is just and expedient. Before his time divi- 
nation was resorted to, or an appeal was made to the oracle or 
to the auspices on the occasion of any new undertaking. The 
will looked to some external event—some sign, portent, or omen
-P-A-G-E-251
226 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
—to guide its action. With Socrates begins the mode to which 
we are accustomed, the decision through reflection on several 
courses of action possible.] . 
§ 214. This idea, that virtue could be taught, was 
realized especially by Plato and Aristotle; the former 
inclining to Dorianism, the latter holding to the prin- 
ciple of individuality in nearly the modern sense. As 
regards the pedagogical means—gymnastics, music, and 
grammar—both philosophers substantially agreed. But, 
in the seizing of the pedagogical development in gen- 
eral, Plato held that the education of the individual be- 
longed to the state alone, because the individual was to 
devote himself wholly to the state. On the other hand, 
while Aristotle also holds that the state should, as a 
general thing, conduct the education of its citizens, and 
that the individual should be trained for the interest of 
the state, yet he recognizes also the family, and the pe 
culiarity of the individual, as positive powers, to which 
the state must accord relative freedom. Plato sacrifices 
the family to the state, and must therefore have sacred 
marriages, nurseries, and common and public educational 
institutions. Each one shall do only that which he is 
fitted to do, and shall work at this one employment so 
as to perfect his skill in it; but to what he shall direct 
his energies, and in what he shall be instructed, shall be 
determined by the government, and the individuality 
consequently is not left free. Aristotle also will have 
for all the citizens a uniform, common, and public edu- 
cation ; but he allows, at the same time, independence 
to the family and self-determination to the individual, 
so that a sphere of private life presents itself within the 
state: a difference by means of which a much broader 
scope of individuality is possible.
-P-A-G-E-252
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 22% 
These two philosophers have come to represent two very differ- 
ent directions in the science of education, which at intervals, in cer- 
tain stages of culture, reappear—the one, the tyrannical guardian- 
ship of the state which assumes the work of education, tyrannical to 
the individual; and the other, the free development of the liberal 
system of state-education, which directs itself against idiosyncrasy 
and fate, 
{Plato inclines to the Spartan form of civilization, and would 
have strict control exercised by wise men in power, Aristotle 
inclined to the direction of greater individualism, and his views 
are approximately those of the present day.] 
§215. The complete dissolution of the principle of 
ssthetic individuality takes place when the individual, 
in the decay of public life, in the disappearance of all 
beautiful morality, isolates himself, and seeks to gain in 
his isolation such strength that he can bear the changes 
of fortune with composure —“ataraxy.” The Stoics 
sought to attain this end by turning their attention in- 
ward into pure internality, and thus, by preserving the 
self-determination of abstract thinking and willing, 
maintaining their equanimity: the Epicureans endeav- 
ored to do the same, with this difference, however, that 
they strove after a positive satisfaction of the senses by 
filling them with conarete pleasurable sensations. Asa 
consequence of this, the Stoics withdrew from practical 
life in order to maintain their independence of external 
conditions, and to preserve their mental quiet unbroken. 
The Epicureans lived in companies, because they height 
ened the results of their pleasure-seeking principle 
through harmony of feeling and through the sweetness 
of friendship. In so far the Epicureans were Greeks 
and the Stoics Romans. With both, however, the beauty 
of manifestation was secondary to the immobility of the 
inner feeling. The plastic union of the good and the
-P-A-G-E-253
228 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
beautiful was destroyed by the extremes of thinking and 
feeling. This was the advent of the Roman principle 
among the Greeks. 
[With the principle of Stoicism the Greek has finally deserted 
the wsthetic standpoint and arrived at the Roman principle. To 
be imperturbable (“ataraxy”) in the midst of calamity is the 
object of both Stoics and Epicureans, The former strives, by 
cultivating his will through self-denial and his intellect through 
reflection, to build for himself a world in the depths of his soul 
secure from external events. The Epicurean seeks to make the 
most of the world as it actually is, and to make sure of happiness, 
but he takes care to hold his feelings under restraint, and, like the 
Stoic, to create his happiness by thinking and willing.) 
$216. The educational significance of Stoicism and 
Epicureanism consists in this, that, after the public 
moral life was: sundered from the private, the individual 
began to educate himself, through philosophical culture, 
into stability of character, for which reason the Roman 
emperors particularly disliked the Stoics. At many 
times, a devotion to the Stoie philosophy was sufficient 
to make one suspected. But, at last, a noble emperor, 
in order to win himself a hold in the chaos of things, 
was forced himself to become a Stoic, and took refuge 
in the inaccessible calm of the depths of thought oceu- 
pied in reflecting on its own nature, and of the will en- 
gaged in restraining itself by ethical maxims. Stoics 
and Epicureans both had what we call an ideal. The 
Stoics used for this ideal the expression, “kingdom”; 
as Horace says, sarcastically, “Sapiens est rex nisi— 
pituita molesta est.” 
(With Stoicism and Epicureanism, education assumes a new 
significance, because both depend on careful training of intellect 
and will. The early stages of Greek life were spontaneous; edu- 
cation simply enjoined the following of blind custom. Heredi

tary instincts rendered it all easy and natural. Greece carne 
under Roman power, and this contradiction between native 
Greek customs and the course of educated thought and feeling 
became very marked. Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor, 
whose “ Meditations” we prize so much, rendered Stoicism ac- 
eeptable with the government of Rome.] 
CHAPTER V. 
SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION (continued). 
IL. Practical Education. 
§ 217. Tux outcome of the dissolution of the beau- 
tiful individuality is the earnest individuality that di- 
rects all its labor to the achievement of purposes useful 
to the state, which, on the one hand, considers carefully 
end and means, and, on the other hand, seeks to realize 
the end through the corresponding means, and in this 
effort subordinates mere beauty of form to usefulness. 
The practical individuality is therefore directed to the 
achievement of an external object, since it is not its own 
purpose like the beautiful, as it was even in the case of 
the Stoies and Epicureans, but has an external object, 
and finds its satisfaction not so much in this after it is 
attained as in the striving for its attainment. 
[The Roman makes usefulness rather than beauty the supreme 
end. He looks upon things and events as means to ends, But 
the end or object for which all things, even the lives of individ- 
nals, are means, is Rome. While the individuality of the Greek 
is educated for beauty, and hence for its own culture and not for 
an external end and aim, the Roman individuality is educated 
for the preservation and prosperity of the state, But in this 
17
-P-A-G-E-255
230 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
we must not forget that the Roman differs from the Persian 
who is educated for the conquest of boundaries and the extension 
of the sway of the nation. The Persian does not distinguish be- 
tween the state in the abstract and the king in the concrete. 
But Romans always make this distinction, and never confound 
the abstract sovereignty to which all owe their lives and prop- 
erty with individuals in authority. Even the most absolute dic- 
tator is simply a means and not an end; he must “see that the 
republic does not suffer detriment.” Therefore it is that the 
Roman education is an “ individual system,” and not a one-sided 
“active” or “passive” system. The historical myths and le- 
gends relate that Rome was settled by fugitives and outlaws on 
the border-land of the Sabines, the Latins, and the Etruscans, 
This colluvies, as Livy calls it, the dregs of the surrounding 
peoples, must unite for its own safety, and form a govern- 
ment on a purely artificial basis. All other nations had united 
on a religious basis. But these peoples had different religions 
and different manners and customs, The political bond, pure and 
simple, is set up as the highest. It becomes the object of religion 
in fact, Another interesting feature is the fact that compact or 
contract is the essence of the Roman spiritual life. Founded 
not on religion, but on mutual agreement for common safety, the 
Roman state exists as a sort of higher will of each individual, 
Two or more wills unite and consolidate in a sort of higher, re- 
sultant will. Such is a contract. To sum up Roman education 
in a word, one may say that his idea of the all-importance of a 
contract and the implicit obedience which the individual should 
render it, is the great educative influence always present with 
the Roman in the republic. On the basis of this idea arises the 
noble patriotism which the citizen displays when he offers up 
his life and property for the safety and honor of Rome. On the 
same basis arises the opposite feeling of private right, the intense 
enjoyment of private property, and the network of civil laws 
which protect it, The Roman unites in his consciousness these 
two antithetic notions: (a) utter devotion of life and property 
for the state; (b) absolute freedom and independence within the 
limits of his private property. In his mind he reconciles and 
adjusts these two relations—the one for Rome, the other for him- 
seif. This makes the Roman character peculiar in the history of 
the world. There is this dualism in it.]
-P-A-G-E-256
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 931 
§ 218. The education of this system begins with 
strict simplicity. But, after it has attained its object, 
it gives itself up to the pursuit of esthetic culture as a 
recreation, not for the sake of producing works of art, 
but in order to enjoy them and without any further ob- 
ject. What was to the Greeks a real delight in the 
beautiful became therefore with the Romans simply an 
esthetic amusement, and as such must finally become 
wearisome. .The Roman earnestness of individuality 
made for itself a new object in mysticism, which was 
distinguished from the original one in that it concealed 
in itself a mystery and exacted an activity that was 
partly theoretical and partly ascetic. 
[4sthetie culture, which was religion with the Greeks, there- 
fore becomes mere idle amusement with the Romans. There 
are three epochs in Roman education : (1) the strictly simple edu- 
eation of the republic; (2) the education for amusement and 
the enjoyment of fine arts; (8) the education into secret rites 
and mysteries which took place in the latter days, when the 
special religions of all nations had been mingled, and a tendency 
to eclecticism prevailed.] 
§ 219. (1) The first epoch of Roman education, as 
properly Roman, was the juristic-military education of 
the republic. The end and aim of the Roman waa 
Rome; and Rome, as from the beginning an eclectic 
state, could endure only through the adaptation of its 
Jaws and external politics to hold together the composite 
elements of the nation, and subordinate each interest to 
the interest of the whole. It bore the same contradic- 
tion within itself as in its external attitude. The latter 
forced it into an attitude of violence against neighboring 
nations; the plebeians were likewise opposed to the pa- 
tricians in the same attitude of violence, for they robbed
-P-A-G-E-257
282 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
them gradually of all their privileges. On this account 
education directed itself partly to giving a knowledge 
of the law, partly to training for war. The boys were 
obliged to commit to memory and recite the laws of the 
Twelve Tables, and all the young men were subject to 
military service. The Roman possessed no individuality 
of native growth, but one formed through the inter- 
mingling of various national stocks; fugitives collecting 
‘on the Roman hills furnishing the population. This 
developed a very great energy. Hence from the first 
he was attentive to his own conduct; he watched jeal- 
ously over the limits that bounded his rights from the 
rights of others, measured his strength, moderated him- 
self, and constantly guarded himself. In contrast with 
the careless cheerfulness of the Greeks, he therefore ap- 
pears gloomy. 
The Latin tongue is crowded with expressions which paint pres- 
ence of mind, effort at reflection, a critical attitude of mind, the im- 
portance of personal control: as gravitas morum, sui compos esse, 
sibi constare, austeritas, vir strenuus, vir probus, vitam honestam 
gerere, sibimet ipse imperare, etc. The Etruscan element imparted 
to this earnestness a peculiarly stiff, ceremonial, solemn character. 
The Roman was no longer, like the Greek, unembarrassed in the 
presence of naturalness. He was ashamed of nudity; verecundia, 
pudor, were genuinely Roman, Vitam preferre pudort was disgrace- 
ful, On the contrary, the Greek gave to Greeks a festival in exhibit- 
ing the splendor of his naked body, and the inhabitants of Crotons 
erected a statue to Philip solely because he was perfectly beautiful 
Simply to be beautiful, only beautiful, was enough for the Greek 
But a Roman, in order to be recognized, must have done something 
for Rome: se bene de republica merert, 
[Rome, being an eclectic state, could exist only by subordinat- 
ing all interests to the supreme one of the safety of the state. 
The individual may cherish all other interests as private inter- 
ests, but must not allow them to interfere with the public cause. 
Here, for the first time, is freedom of the individual in such
-P-A-G-E-258
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 938 
matters as manners and customs and modes of religious worship 
that were peculiar to the separate tribes which united to form 
Rome. Each family had its own “household gods.” Strange, 
too, we find ancestor-worship in Rome in almost as pure a form 
as it exists in China. It seems to have been arrested in its de- 
velopment by the establishment of an artificial abstraction, the 
republic as absolute. Education had to make the youth ac- 
quainted with the written law of the “Twelve Tables,” which 
recited the fundamental limitations of private freedom and pos- 
session that are rendered necessary to secure the public weal. 
These laws concerned chiefly the forms of transference of proper- 
ty and the forms of recovery. The individuality of the Roman is 
realized in private property through the fact that the supreme 
power, political and religious, re-enforces his private will and 
protects it in its rights within the limits prescribed in the code 
of laws, Private ownership in this sense is a participation on 
the part of the particular will of the individual in the universal 
or collective will of the state. The other side of education was 
the preparation for military service. 
Most remarkable is the vocabulary of Latin words expressing 
the gravity, soberness, austerity, probity, honesty, self-restraint, 
composed manners, etc., of this people. His (the Roman’s) mind 
is divided between the private and the public interests, and 
always under a sort of constraint—never spontaneous and free 
like the Greek in early ages before Greek philosophy had super- 
induced reflection. All modern peoples that have entered civili- 
zation inherit from Rome this double consciousness of the self 
and the public interest, but not in the contradictory form which 
it once assumed. Christianity solved its contradiction by giving 
to it an infinite ground in the doctrine of the divine-human and 
of the atonement. ] 
§ 220. In the first education of children the Roman 
mother was especially influential, so that woman with 
the Romans took generally a more moral, a higher, and 
a freer position. It is worthy of remark that, while the 
beautiful woman set the Greeks at variance, among the 
Romans, through her ethical authority, she acted as 
reconeiler.
-P-A-G-E-259
234. PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
{Woman in Greece as the ideal of the beautiful in the person 
of Helen set states at variance. In Rome the daughters of the 
Sabines, stolen by the Romans, reconciled the conflicting armies, 
In Rome woman took a higher and freer position.] 
§ 221. The mother of the Roman helped to form 
his character; the father undertook the work of instrue- 
tion. When, in his fifteenth year, the boy exchanged 
the toga pretewtata for the toga virilis, he was usually 
sent to some relative, or to some respectable jurist, as 
his guardian, to learn thoroughly, under his guidance, 
the laws and political usages of the state; with the sev- 
enteenth year began military service. All education was 
for a long time entirely a private affair. On account of 
the necessity of the mechanical unity which war demands 
in its evolutions, the greatest stress was laid upon obe- 
dience. In its restricted sense instruction was given 
in reading, writing, and arithmetic; the last being, on 
account of its usefulness, more esteemed by the Romans 
than by the Greeks, who gave more time to geometry. 
The schools, very characteristically, were called Zudi, 
because their work was, in distinction from other occu- 
pations, regarded simply as a recreation, as play. 
The Roman recognized with pride this distinction between the 
Greek and himself; Cicero’s introduction to his “ Essay on Oratory” 
expresses it. To be practical was the one result aimed at by the 
reflective character of the Romans, which was always proposing 
to itself new objects and seeking the means for their attainment; 
which loved moderation, not to secure beauty thereby, but respected 
it as a means for a happy success (medium tenuere beati); which did 
not. possess serene self-limitation, or ewpootyy, but rather carefully 
estimated guid valeant humert, quid ferre recusent ; but which, as & 
matter of course, went far beyond the Greeks in persistency of will, 
in constantia animi. The schools were at first held publicly in 
booths at the intersection of streets; hence the name ériviuwm. Very 
significant for the Roman is the predicate which he conferred upon
-P-A-G-E-260
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION. 235 
theoretical subjects when he called them artes bone, optime, libera- 
les, ingenue, ete., and brought forth the practical element in them 
(their relation to the will), 
[The influence of the Roman mother over her son is well 
portrayed in Shakespeare's “Coriolanus.” At fifteen the Roman 
youth studied the laws; at seventeen entered the army. Obedi- 
ence emphasized. Branches of study. Schools called by the 
Romans places for sport and recreation (ludt); by Greeks, places 
of leisure (x0a4). ‘The difference between the Roman and the 
Greek in the matter of self-possession of individuality; the 
Roman has constancy of purpose; the Greck, serene self-limita~ 
tion, i. e., moderation and self-control in his reaction against 
impulses and external incitements.] 
§ 222. (2) But the practical education could no 
longer keep its ground after it had become acquainted 
with the esthetic. The conquest of Greece, Asia Minor, 
and Egypt made necessary, in a practical point of view, 
the acquisition of the Grecian tongue, so that these 
lands, so permeated with Grecian culture, might be 
governed effectively. The Roman of family and prop- 
erty, therefore, took into his service Greek nurses and 
teachers who should give to his children, from their 
earliest years, instruction in the Greek tongue. It is 
the first instance in the history of education in which 
anation has undertaken to teach a foreign tongue to its 
youth, 
Moreover, the usefulness of it in political and other 
affairs caused the study of Greek rhetoric, so that not 
only in the deliberations of the senate and in the assem- 
blies of the people, but in pleadings before the courts, 
the Roman citizen might gain his cause by its aid. 
Whatever effort the Roman government made to pre- 
vent the invasion of the Greek rhetorician was all in 
vain. The Roman youth sought this very useful knowl-
-P-A-G-E-261

edge even abroad, c. g., in the flourishing school of rhet 
oric on the island of Rhodes. 
At last, even the study of philosophy commended 
itself to the practical Roman, in order that he might 
obtain consolation amid the disappointments of life. 
When his practical activities did not bring him any re- 
sult, he devoted himself in his poverty to abstract con- 
templation. The Greeks desired philosophy for its own 
sake ; the ataraxy of the Stoics, Epicureans, and skeptics 
even wished to be considered the result of a necessary 
principle; but the Roman, on the contrary, wished to 
lift himself by philosophemes above trouble and mis- 
fortune. 
This direction which philosophy took is noteworthy, not alone 
in Cicero and Seneca, but at the fall of the Roman Empire, when 
Boéthius wrote in prison his immortal work on the “Consolation of 
Philosophy.” 
[After the conquest of Greece and the necessary introduction 
of the study of the Greek language in order to rule Egypt, Asia, 
and places where that language had been carried by the Alex- 
andrian conquests, the Roman education changes rapidly, and 
introduces literary studies. The useful art of rhetoric, so neces- 
sary to the politician and the barrister, initiated this change. 
Greek teachers of rhetoric taught the most eminent Roman 
politicians, Apollonius of Rhodes taught both Cicero and 
Cesar. Afterward the poets and historians, and finally the 
philosophy of Greece, came to be studied.] 
§ 223. The earnestness which pursued a definite ob- 
ject degenerated into its opposite. The idleness of the 
wealthy Roman, who felt himself to be the lord of a 
world without limits, led to desire for enjoyment and 
dissipation, which, in its entire want of moderation, 
abused Nature. The most elegant form of the educa- 
tion that became prevalent at this period was that in
-P-A-G-E-262

belles-lettres, which also for the first time came to belong 
to the sphere of education. There had been a degenera- 
tion of art in India and Greece, but never an artistic tri- 
fling. But in Rome there arose a pursuit of art in order 
to win a certain consideration in social position, and to 
sreate a species of recreation adapted to the ennai of a 
soul satiated with sensual debauchery. Such a treatment 
of art is unworthy, for it no longer recognizes its inde- 
pendent significance, but subordinates it as a means to 
personal gratification. Literary salons then appear. 
In the introduction to his “Catiline,” Sallust has painted excel- 
lently this complete revolution in the Roman education. The 
younger Pliny in his letters furnishes ample material to illustrate for 
us this pursuit of delles-letires. In Nero it became insanity. We 
should transgress our prescribed limits did we enter here into par- 
ticulars. Its analysis shows the perversion of the esthetic into the 
practical, the msthetic losing thereby its proper nature. But the 
Roman could not avoid this perversion, because, according to his 
original tendency, he could not move except toward the utile et ho- 
nestum, 
[Mere literature, as means of amusement, and trifling with 
matters of art, now entered the education of the idle Roman 
possessed of wealth. He did not attain the genuine esthetic, but 
rather destroyed it by perverting its aim to mere amusement. 
The Greek had produced it in a religious mood. The Roman 
enjoyed it as an idle pastime.] - 
§ 224. (8) But this pursuit of fine art, this mere 
showy display, must at last weary the Roman. He 
sought for himself an object to which he could devote 
himself again with some degree of exertion. His do- 
minion over the world was assured, and conquest as an 
object could no more charm him, National religion 
had fallen with the destruction of the national indi- 
vidualities. The soul looked out over its political life 
into an empty void. It sought to establish a relation
-P-A-G-E-263
238 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
between itself and another world filled with imaginary 
spiritual powers. In place of the depreciated nationality 
and its religion there enters the eclecticism of mystic 
orders. There had been, it is true, here and there, in 
national religions certain secret signs, rites, words, and 
meanings; but now, for the first time in the history of 
the world, there appeared secret organizations as edu- 
cational societies, which concerned themselves only with 
the private individual and were indifferent to nation- 
ality. Everything had been profaned by the roughness 
of violence. They believed no longer in the old gods, 
and the superstitious faith in ghosts and evil spirits be- 
came only a thing fit to frighten children with. Thus 
they took refuge in secrecy, which for blasé men had a 
piquant charm. 
[When the Roman Empire had conquered the world, she had 
at the same time destroyed the peculiar idiosyncrasy of the city 
of Rome which made it politically sacred. The rights of citizen- 
ship were conferred by the emperors on the inhabitants of cities 
in all parts of the world. The peculiar religions of the. con- 
quered nations were adopted and recognized and their gods trans- 
ported to Rome and set up in the Pantheon. Such toleration 
of all religions enforced on the peoples composing the Empire 
necessarily sapped the foundations of religious education and 
caused a wide-spread indifference as to sacred matters. One 
set of heathen gods is just as good as another, and neither of 
them receives the worship of the educated Roman. <Accord- 
ingly, the religious sentiment takes refuge in a sort of mystic 
pantheism, using especially Persian and Egyptian forms, The 
worship of Mithras and Isis became common.] 
» $225. The education of the mysteries was twofold, 
theoretical and practical. In the theoretical we find a 
regular gradation of symbols and symbolical acts through 
which one seemed gradually to approach the revelation 
of the secret; the practical contained a regular grada- 
\

tion of ascetic actions [disciplinary training] alternating 
with an abandonment to wild orgies. These two forms 
of education elevated one from the rank of the novice 
to that of the initiated. The degrees of the orders 
formed an instrumentality for the development of ethi- 
sal growth, and this form has been retained in the edu- 
cation of all such secret worship, mutatis mutandis, 
down to the Illuminati. 
In the Roman Empire, its Persian element was the worship of 
Mithras; its Egyptian, that of Isis; its Grecian,,the Pythagorean 
doctrines, All these three, however, were much mingled with each 
other. The Roman legions, who really no longer had any native 
country, spread these artificial religions throughout the whole world. 
The breaking away from established forms led often to clairvoyance, 
which was not yet understood, and to belief in miracles. Apollonius 
of Tyana, the messiah of heathenism, is the principal figure in this 
group; and, in comparison with him, Jamblichus appears only as an 
enthusiast, and Alexander of Abonoteichus as an ordinary impostor. 
[Secret societies with graded symbolism and secret initiations 
celebrated the esoteric or exer meaning which was supposed to 
underlie all religions, especially the Persian and Egyptian. 
Those who seized the deep meaning called themselves the ¢llu- 
minated. In 1776 Adam Weishaupt founded the Illuminati re- 
ferred to in the text. Apollonius of Tyana (a. p. 80-70) collected 
amass of doctrines from the East, resembling what passes for 
“esoteric Buddhism ” or “ theosophy” in our literature of 1886. 
Jamblichus was an extravagant Neo-Platonist, holding the doc- 
trines of the pre-existence of the soul and the descent of creation 
by a lapse (“ fall” or degradation) from the Absolute. Alex~ 
ander of Abonoteichus (in Paphlagonia), a notorious sorcerer, 
about the middle of the second century a. p., who gave himself 
out fora prophet. His life was written by Lucian.] 
Ill. Abstract Individual Education. 
§ 226. What the declining nations in their despair 
sought for in these mysteries was individuality, which
-P-A-G-E-265
940 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
in its special singularity is conscious of the universality 
of the-rational world of institutions as its own essence. 
This individuality existed more immediately in the Ger- 
manic race, but, nevertheless, on account of its peculiar 
nature, it attained its true actualization first in Christian- 
ity. It can be here only pointed out that the Germanic 
people most thoroughly, in opposition to Nature, to men, 
and to the gods, felt themselves to be independent, as 
Tacitus says, “ Seeurt adversus homines, securi adversus 
Deos.” This individuality, which had for its object 
only itself, must necessarily be destroyed, and was saved 
only by Christianity, which overcame and enlightened 
its demonic and defiant spirit. We can not speak here 
of a system of education. Respect for personality, the 
free acknowledgment of the clains of woman, the loy- 
alty to the leader chosen by themselves, loyalty to their 
chosen companions (the idea of comradeship)—these 
features all deserve to be well noted, because from them 
arose the feudalism of the middle ages. What Cesar 
and Tacitus tell us of the education of the Germans ex- 
presses only the free play allowed itself by individuality, 
which in its rudimentary savage state had no other form 
in which to manifest itself than wars of conquest. 
To the Roman there was something demonic in the German. 
He perceived dimly in him his future, his master. When the Ro- 
mans first met the Cimbri and Teutons in the field, their commander 
had to accustom them gradually to the fearful sight of the wild, 
giant-like forms. 
[The individualism of the Germanic race is called “abstract” 
by Rosenkranz because that race loved individuality pure and 
simple. They cared neither for men nor gods, having that in- 
toxication of bravery which utter desperation gives. The Ger- 
manic individuality is here called demonic (not demonic), in the 
Greek sense of “ possessed by a spirit.” It is a sort of madness

or frenzy—the Berserker rage, described in Kingsley’s “ Hypa- 
tia,” as possessing the Norsemen in battle. (See § 208.) They 
had loyalty to their friends and leaders, and acknowledged the 
elaims of woman. The tragedy of Brunhild in the old Norse 
Edda shows how deeply prophetic was their sentiment regarding 
woman.] 
CHAPTER VI. 
THE SYSTEM OF THEOCRATIC EDUCATION. 
§ 227. Tux system of national education was founded 
on the substantial basis of the family institution ; its 
second phase is the division of the nation by means 
of division of labor which it makes permanent in 
castes; its third stage presents the free antithesis of the 
laity and clergy; next it makes war, immortality, and 
trade, by turns, its end; after this, it sets up beauty, 
_ patriotic duty, and the immediateness of individuality, 
as the essence of human nature; and at last dissolves 
the unity of nationality in the consciousness that all 
nations are really one since they are all human be- 
ings. In the intermixture of races in the Roman world 
arises the conception of the human race, the genus hu- 
manum, Education had become eclectic: the Roman 
legions leveled the national distinctions. In the waver- 
ing of all objective morality, the necessity of self-edu- 
cation in order to the formation of character appeared 
ever more and more clearly; but the conception, which 
lay at the foundation, was always, nevertheless, that of 
Roman, Greek, or German education. But in the midst 
of these nations another system had striven for develop.
-P-A-G-E-267
249 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
ment, and this did not base itself on the natural bond of 
nationality, but made this, for the first time, only a sec. 
ondary thing, and made the direct relation of man to 
God its chief idea. In this system God himself is the 
teacher. He manifests to man his will as law, to which 
be must unconditionally conform, for no other reason 
than that he is the Lord and man is his servant who can 
nave no other will than His. The obedience of man is, 
therefore, in this system mere mechanical submission to 
authority, until through experience he gradually attains 
to the knowledge that the will of God has in it the very 
essence of his own will. Descent, talent, events, work, 
beauty, courage—all these are indifferent things com- 
pared with the subjection of the human to the divine 
will. To believe in God is the way to be well-pleasing 
tohim. Without this unity with God, what is natural 
in national descent is of no value. According to its 
form of manifestation, Judaism is not so advanced as 
the Greek spirit. It is not beantiful, but rather gro- 
tesque. But in its essence, as the religion of the con- 
tradiction between the absolute, divine ideal and the 
finite and the imperfect existence of the world, it takes 
a step beyond Nature, which it perceives to be created 
by an absolute, conscious, and reasonable will; while 
the Greek concealed in a myth concerning the birth of 
Gea, his mother-earth, the fact of the dependence of all 
Nature on a higher source. The Jews have been pre- 
served in the midst of all other civilizations by the elas- 
tie power of the thought of God as one who was free 
from the control of Nature. The Jews have a patriotism 
equal to that of the Romans. The Maccabees, for ex 
ample, were not inferior to the Romans in greatness. -

Abraham is the genuine Jew because he is the genuinely faith- 
ful man. He does not hesitate to obey the horrible and inhuman 
command of his God. Circumcision was made the token of the © 
national unity, but the nation may assimilate members to itself 
irom other nations through this rite. The essential condition 
of membership in the chosen people always lies in belief in a 
spiritual relation to which the natural relation is secondary. The 
Jewish nation makes proselytes, and these are widely different 
from the Socit of the Romans or the Metoeci (Méromuoi) of the 
Athenians, 
{Quite in contrast to the “individual” education is the sys- 
tem of “theocratic” education. The “unity of nationality is 
dissolved in the consciousness that all nations are really one 
since they are ali human beings.” This refers to the last stage 
of Roman history. The Romans had conquered all nations and 
imposed upon them the Roman law and the double conscious- 
ness (above described) of public and private rights, Upon the 
conquest of a new country, its youth, able to bear arms, were 
conscripted into the army and sent to some remote part of the 
empire where they were opposed to a foe so unlike themselves in 
language and customs as to cause them to cleave loyally to the 
Roman standard as the only means of self-preservation, Be- 
sides, it was only through Rome that they could ever hope to 
hear from their native land or return to it. By this plan the 
conquered peoples became thoroughly intermingled throughout 
the army, Those who fought side by side learned to respect 
each other. Slowly there arose the idea of the genus humanum, 
the idea of all men as of one blood. 
While this leveling of national distinctions had gone on 
within the Roman Empire, there arose another movement paral- 
lel to it, but in the deepest recesses of the human spirit. It was 
the theocratic education that developed the idea of the personal 
God, who is not a special limited God, but the God of all people. 
While Greek poetry is beautiful, Hebrew poetry is sublime. It 
presents the strong contrast between a Creator of infinite power 
and his finite works, God is above and apart from all Nature. 
The Persian makes Ahura-Mazda identical with the natura 
element, light. But the Bible says that light was created sd by a 
mere word of the Divine Person.]
-P-A-G-E-269

§ 228. To the man who knows Nature to be the 
work of a single, transcendent, rational Creator, she loses 
independence. He is negatively freed from her control, 
and sees in her only a means. As opposed to the hea- 
then conceptions richly endowed with the poetic imagi- 
nation, this seems to be a backward step, but for the 
emancipation of man it is a progress, He no longer 
fears Nature, but her Lord, and admires Him so much in 
his works that prose rises to the dignity of poetry even 
in this teleological contemplation (which celebrates the 
purpose of Nature rather than Nature herself). Since 
man stands above Nature, education is directed to morali- 
ty as such, and expresses itself in manifold qualifications, 
by means of which the distinction of man from Nature 
is definitely stated. The ceremonial law appears often 
arbitrary, but in its prescribed ceremonies it offers man 
the satisfaction of placing himself as will in relation to 
will (human will in relation to Absolute Will). For ex- 
ample, if he is forbidden to eat any specified part of an 
animal, the ground of this command is not merely nat- 
ural (i. e., based on hygienic reasons)—it is the will 
of the Deity. Man learns, therefore, in his obedience 
to such directions, to free himself from his self-will, 
from his natural appetites. This thorough renunciation 
of mere subjectivity (selfishness) is the beginning of 
wisdom, the purification of the will from all individual 
egotism. 
The Decalogue contains the rational substance of the law ex- 
pressed for all time. Many of our modern much-admired authors 
exhibit a superficiality bordering on shallowness when they confine 
their comments to the absurdity of the miracles, and omit all notice 
of the profound depth of the moral struggle of the Jewish people, 
and fail to see the practical rationality of the ten commandments,
-P-A-G-E-270
THE SYSTEM OF THEOCRATIC EDUCATION. 245 
[When a religion teaches man that Nature is only a created 
object, and that the Creator is a conscious person, he does not 
any longer worship forces and material forms, but sees in them 
only a means for the realization of spiritual ends. With such a 
belief education is directed toward what is ethical. In obeying 
the “law” man obeys the will of deity and not a mere blind 
necessity of unconscious Nature. ] 
§ 229. Education in this theocratical system is in 
one respect patriarchal. The family is very prominent, 
because it is considered to be a great happiness for 
the individual to belong from his earliest life to the 
company of those who believe in the true God. In 
another respect it is hierarchical, inasmuch as its cere- 
monial law develops a special function, to be filled by 
those whose duty it is to see that obedience is paid to 
its multifarious regulations. And, because these are 
often perfectly arbitrary, education must, above all, see 
that they are committed to memory so thoroughly that 
they may always be remembered. The Jewish mono- 
theism shares this necessity with the superstition of hea- 
thenism. . 
[In the theocratic system education is at first patriarchal be- 
cause the family is the link that connects the individual with 
the faithful chosen people. Secondly, the education is provided 
by the priests who have to preserve the ceremonial law in its 
purity, and see to its observance. What is prescribed by divine 
command must be committed to memory; hence the tendency in 
this species of education to exclusive cultivation of the memory.! 
§ 230. But the technique proper of the ceremonial 
mechanism is not the most important educational ele- 
ment of the theocracy. We find this in its ‘historical 
significance, since its history throughout has an educa. 
tional character. For the people of God show us always, 
in their intercourse with Him, a progress from the ex 
18
-P-A-G-E-271

ternal to the internal, from the lower to the higher, 
from the past to the future. Their history, therefore, 
abounds in situations very interesting in an educational 
point of view, and in characters which are eternal models. 
[To the command to obey is added a promise of material pros 
perity and a threat of punishment. The history of the chosen 
people shows a gradual progress away from the state of mind 
which looks to material reward for obeying spiritual laws. ] 
§ 231. (1) The will of God as the absolute authority 
is at first to this people, as law, external. But soon God 
adds to the command to obedience, on the one hand, the 
inducement of a promise of material prosperity, and on 
the other hand the threat of material punishment. The 
fulfillment of the law is also encouraged by reflection 
on the profit which it brings. But, since these motives 
are all external, we rise finally into the insight that the 
law is to be fulfilled, not on account of those motives, 
but because it is the will of the Lord; not alone because 
it is conducive to our happiness, but also because it is 
in itself holy, and written in our hearts: in other words, 
man proceeds from the standpoint of abstract legality, 
through the reflection of eudemonism (i. e., the expecta- 
tion of selfish gain for our obedience), to the internality 
of moral sentiment—the course of all education. 
This last standpoint is especially represented in the excellent 
collection of aphorisms of Jesus Sirach—a book rich in pedagog- 
ical insight, which paints with master-strokes the relations of hus- 
band and wife, parents and children, master and servants, friend and 
friend, enemy and enemy, and the dignity of labor as well as the 
necessity of its division. This priceless book forms a companion- 
piece from the theocratic standpoint to the “ Republic” and “ Laws” 
of Plato, in which he treats the province of ethics. 
[The history of the Jews shows the discipline that they un 
dergo. They come to see that the law must be obeyed, not be

cause it brings prosperity, but because it is the law of holinesa 
and its fulfillment makes men resemble God, In the progress 
of this nation we see three stages which are repeated in all in- 
dividuals who become thoroughly educated : (1) abstract legality, 
mechanical obedience without insight or purpose; (2) “the re- 
flection of eudemonism ”"—* reflection,” because the doer sees in 
his deed his own profit or gain, i. e.,a reflection of self as in a 
mirror; (8) to the internality of moral sentiment, obedience to 
the law, because it leads to holiness or union with God. See the 
book “ Eeclesiasticus” in the “ Apocrypha,” “containing the 
Wisdom of Jesus, the Son of Sirach,” for this insight into the 
law of holiness.] 
§ 232. (2) The progress from the lower to the higher 
appeared in the conquering of the natural individuality. 
Man, as the servant of Jehovah, must have no will of 
his own; but selfish naturalness arrayed itself so much 
the more vigorously against the absolute “Thou shalt,” 
allowed itself to descend into alienation from the law, 
and often reached the most unbridled extravagance. But 
since the law with its inexorable strictness always re- 
mained the same, contrasting its persistence with the 
inequalities of human acts, it forced man to come back 
to it, and to conform himself to its demands. Thus he 
learned self-criticism, thus he rose from the natural into 
the spiritual. This progress is at the same time a prog- 
ress from necessity to freedom, because self-criticism 
gradually opens a way into the insight that the will of 
God is the true outcome of man’s own self-determina- 
tion. Because God is one and absolute, there arises the 
expectation that his will will become the basis for the 
will of all nations and men. The criticism of the un- 
derstanding must recognize a contradiction in the fact 
that the will of the true God is the law of only one 
nation. Other nations, moreover, were repelled from
-P-A-G-E-273
248 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
the Jews by reason of their worship of God as a gloomy 
mystery, and they detested that race as odiwm generis 
humani. And thus is developed the thought that the 
isolation of the believers will come to an end as soon as 
the other nations recognize their faith as the true one, 
and are received into it. Thus here, in the deepest 
penetration of the soul into itself, as among the Romans 
in the fusion of nations, we see appear the idea of the 
human race. 
[Progress appeared in another respect in the degree to which 
the people could subdue their natural appetites and lusts and 
submit to the law of Jehovah, The ideai standard of conduct 
being furnished by the law, each Jew could criticise his own life 
by it. This criticism, moreover, gave him insight into the fact 
that the law of holiness was at the same time the true outcome 
of his own self-determination—that is to say, the true means of 
his own perfection, and not an arvitrary regulation of Jehovah 
forced on man against his true interests. Again, as a conse- 
quence of this insight, it became evident that the law is the 
means of perfection for all men, and that Jehovah is the God 
of all nations, and not the God of the Jews alone, and that He 
ought to be recognized by all people. When this is done the 
chosen people will be no longer exclusive, At this point the 
Jewish theocracy has reached the idea of the human race as be- 
longing to one religion, and from a. different standpoint has 
come to the same result that the Roman civilization has done.] 
§ 233. (8) The progress from the past to the future 
developed an ideal of a servant of God who fulfills all 
the law, and therefore blots out the empirical contra- 
diction involved in the fact that the “Thou shalt” of 
the law did not attain adequate reality. This Prince of 
Peace, who shall gather all nations under his banner, 
can therefore have no other thing predicated of him 
than holiness. He is not beautiful as the Greeks repre- 
sented their ideal, not brave and practical as was the

venerated Virtus of the Romans; he does not place an 
infinite value on his individuality as the German does; 
but he is represented as insignificant in appearance, as 
patient, as humble, as he who, in order to reconcile the 
world, takes upon himself the infirmities and disgrace 
of all others. The heathen nations have only a lost 
paradise behind them; the Jews have one also before 
them. From this belief in the Messiah who is to come, 
from the certainty which they have of conquering with 
him, from the power of esteeming all present things of 
small importance in view of such a future, springs the 
indestructible nature of the Jews. They ignore the fact . 
that Christianity is the necessary result of their own his- 
tory. As the nation of the future, they are the world- 
historical nation par excellence, the nation among na- 
tions, whese education — whenever the Jew has not 
changed and corrupted his nature through modern cult- 
ure—is still always patriarchal, hierarchal, and mne- 
monic (dwelling on the memory of its past history). 
[The “Prince of Peace” is to gather all peoples under his 
banner of holiness, The Messiah is to come and restore the lost 
paradise. In view of this ideal, which has the Absolute God for 
the guaranty of its realization, the Jew regards his nation as the 
nation of the future, and endures the trials of the present with 
infinite fortitude. The same ideal in Christianity creates the 
martyrs whose stubborn individuality endures not only persecu- 
tion but death cheerfully. This education, therefore, furnishes 
the deepest ground for individuality—sought by the Greeks, 
Romans, and Teutonic peoples with only partial success. It is 
the basis for all future education, AJ] men are of one blood, and 
all have the same destiny, namely, holiness, or participation in 
the divine nature.]

CHAPTER VIL 
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 
§ 234. Tux systems of national and theocratic edu 
cation came to the same result, though by opposite ways, 
and this result is the conception of a human race in the 
unity of which the distinctions of different nations com- 
bine and complement each other so as to form a perfect 
whole. But with them this result is a mere ideal, and 
they remain in their actual state without realizing it. 
They picture to themselves the ideal of the advent of 
the Messiah. But these ideals exist only in the mind, 
and the actual condition of the people sometimes does 
not correspond to them at all, and sometimes only in a 
slight degree. The idea of spiritual perfection had in 
these presuppositions the possibility of its concrete act- 
ualization; one individual man must become conscious 
of the universality and necessity of the will as being the 
very essence of his own freedom, so that all external 
authority should be canceled in the self-rule of spirit, 
which is a law unto itself. Natural individuality ap- 
pearing as national traits was still acknowledged, but was 
deprived of its abstract one-sidedness. The divine au- 
thority of the truth of the individual will is to be recog- 
nized, but at the same time freed from its estrangement 
toward itself. While Christ was a Jew and obedient 
to the divine law, he knew himself as the universal man 
who determines for himself his own destiny; and, al- 
though distinguishing God, as subject, from himself, 
yet holds fast to the unity of man and God. The system 
of humanitarian education began to unfold from this
-P-A-G-E-276
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 954 
principle, which no longer accords the highest place to 
the natural unity of national individuality, nor to ab- 
stract obedience to the command of God, but to that 
freedom of the soul which knows itself to be uncondi- 
tioned by aught in time or space. Christ is not a mere 
ideal of thought, but is known as a living member 
of actual history, whose life, sufferings, and death for 
freedom form the guaranty of its absolute justification 
and truth. The esthetic, philosophical, and political 
ideal are all found in the universal nature of the Chris- 
tian ideal, on which account no one of them appears 
one-sided in Christian life. The principle of human 
freedom excludes neither art, nor science, nor politics. 
[The national systems begin with China, and end with Rome. 
Their outcome is the same as that of the theocratic system of 
education—the conception of a human race in which the differ- 
ences and distinctions of nations are swallowed up and harmo- 
nized, A new system of education arose in the Roman Empire, 
and in the new nations that sprang from its ruins—a system 
founded on the Christian idea. What there was positive in all 
former educational ideals is contained in the Christian ideal. 
The brotherhood of all men and the common heritage of an in- 
finite destiny make the attainment of all kinds of perfection 
possible. Art, science, politics, morality, and industry, are in- 
eluded, but harmonized by the new ideal. This new ideal may 
be stated in the formula: The goal of progress in Christian civ- 
ilization is the greatest perfection of the whole, and the simul- 
taneous realization of the good of the whole race in each indi- 
vidual. The earlier stages of human civilization accepted, as 
goal, the perfection of institutions as a whole at the expense of 
individuality. Complete subordination, which was necessary for 
the perfect working of the patriarchal state, could not be at- 
tained without a suppression of independence on the part of the 
single individual. Progress is marked by the rise of institu- 
tions which secure their greatest perfection through the greatest 
development of the individual. For example, the education of
-P-A-G-E-277
* 959 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
all people up to the point of independent self-activity is neces 
sary for an ideal representative democracy.} 
§ 235. In its conception of man the humanitarian 
education provides for separate nationalities (local, inde 
pendent self-governments), thus securing the good feat- 
ure in “national ” education, and likewise for the sub- 
jection of all men to the divine law, which was taught 
in the theocratic system, but it will no longer permit 
the former to grow into,an isolating exclusiveness, and 
the latter into a despotism which includes the former 
as an unessential element. But this principle of hu- 
manity and human nature took root so slowly that the 
two elements, out of which it developed, were revived 
within it in their peculiar one-sidedness, and had to 
be again overcome and united anew. These. stages of 
eulture were the Greek, the Roman, and the Protest- 
ant Churches, and education was metamorphosed to suit 
the formation of each of these. 
For the sake of brevity we shall confine ourselves in what fol- 
lows to pointing out general characteristics; the unfolding of details 
is intimately bound up with the history of polities and of civiliza- 
tion. We shall be contented if we correctly indicate the gencral 
course of their history. 
[Humanitarian education (Humanitéts-Erziehung = human- 
ity-education) took root so slowly that the two phases which 
were united within it often fell out of harmony and developed 
* one-sidedly, now one predominating and now the other. It be- 
came often necessary to overcome these extreme tendencies and 
restore equilibrium. First, there would be a sort of relapse out 
of the Christian ideal into a heathen ideal, and the national sys- 
tem of education would be approached. Then a reaction would 
set in, and an extreme reached closely resembling the theocratic 
system, The three phases of the Church—Greek, Roman, and 
Protestant—suggest the three forms of individualism: (a) the 
esthetic, (b) the practical or political, (c) the chivalric.]

THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 9253 
§ 236. Within education we can distinguish these 
three stages of development as three epochs: the monk- 
ish, the chivalric, and that education which is to fit one 
for civil life. Each of these endeavored to express all 
that belonged to humanity as such ; but it was only after 
the recognition of the moral nature of the family, of 
labor, of culture, and of the conscious equal title of all 
men to their rights, that this became really possible. 
[Rosenkranz distinguishes three epochs in humanitarian edu- 
cation: (a) the monkish ; (b) chivalric ; (c) citizen.] 
I. The Epoch of Monkish Education. 
§ 287. The Greek Church seized the Christian prin- 
ciple still abstractly as deliverance from the world, 
and therefore, in the education proceeding from it, it 
arrived only at the negative form, defining the univer- 
sality of the individual man (i. e., his essence, his true 
destiny) as the renunciation of self. In the dogmatism 
of its teaching, as well as in the ascetic severity of its 
practical conduct, it was a reproduction of the theo- 
cratic principle. But when this had assumed the form 
of national centralization, the Greek Church dispensed 
with the ascetic severity, and, as far as regards its form, 
it returned again to the quietism of the Orient. 
[The Greek Church laid emphasis on the principle of renun- 
ciation, which is only one of the elements of the Christian ideal. 
Its education, accordingly, took a negative tendency toward the 
passive systems of the extreme East. Its asceticism also repro- 
duced the theocratic principle. Passivity and quietism, the com- 
plete subjugation of self, the renunciation of all secular aims, 
the world, the fiesh, and the devil, the withdrawal from civiliza- 
tion as something repugnant to holiness, characterize this first 
epoch. Holy men retired to the deserts and lived as hermits
-P-A-G-E-279
254 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION 
Then they lived in Christian societies in artificial hermitages, 
cells constructed within high monastic walls. Then in the 
Roman epoch the monks came out of their cells and entered so- 
ciety to elevate it—under the leadership of St. Dominic and St. 
Francis. It was discovered that quietism and withdrawal from 
the world left the mass of mankind to spiritual degradation. 
Christ had not withdrawn to the desert, but had come nigh hu- 
manity in its busy haunts and sought to convert it. So the Do- 
minicans turned toward science and learning and became the 
teachers of the wealthy and powerful classes. The Franciscans 
became popular preachers, going among the poor and lowly, and 
carrying the gospel. Then came Protestantism, taking the fur- 
ther step of recognizing the secular in itself, considered as a neces- 
sary element of the Christian ideal of humanity.] 
§ 288. The monkish education is in general identical 
in all religions, in that, through its concentration of its 
entire attention upon itself in its practical activity, and 
the stoicism of its way of thinking, through the cloister- 
seclusion of its external existence and the mechanism of 
a thoughtless subjection to a general rule as well as to 
the special command of superiors, it fosters a spiritual 
and bodily dullness. The Christian monachism, there- 
fore, as the perfect realization of the ideal of monachism, 
is at the same time the complete exposure of the defect 
of the principle, because, in merely renouncing the 
world instead of conquering it and gaining possession of 
{t, it contradicts the very principle of Christianity. 
[The defect of monachism, as measured by the entire scope of 
Christianity, has been seen: it renounces the world instead of 
conquering it.] 
§ 239. We must notice, as the fundamental error of 
this whole system, that it does not in free individuality 
seek to produce the ideal of divine-humanity, but to 
copy its historical manifestation in an external repro- 
duction. Each human being must complete the Atone
-P-A-G-E-280
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. QD 
ment by offering up as sacrifice his own individuality. 
Each biography has its Bethlehem, its Tabor, and its 
Golgotha. 
[Monachism aims rather to copy an historic past than to rein- 
carnate its divine principle in a new present life. Bethlehem, 
Tabor, and Golgotha, doubtless come, or should come, into every 
complete life, but under new forms peculiar to the occasion.] 
§ 240. Monachism looks upon the freedom from 
one’s self and from the world, that Christianity de- 
mands, only as an entire renunciation of self, which it 
seeks to compass, like Buddhism, by the vows of pov- 
erty, chastity, and obedience, which must be taken by 
each individual. 
This rejection of property, of marriage, and of individual volition, 
is at the same time the negation of work, of the family, and of re- 
sponsibility for.one’s actions. In order to avoid the danger of ava- 
rice and covetousness, of sensuality and of nepotism, of error and of 
guilt, monachism seizes the convenient device of complete severance 
from all the objective world without being able fully to carry out this 
negation. Monkish education must, in consequence, be very particular 
about an external separation of its disciples from the world, so as 
to make the task of alienation from the world easier and more de- 
cided. It therefore builds cloisters in the solitudes of the desert, in 
the depths of the forest, on the summits of mountains, and surrounds 
them with high windowless walls; and then, so as to carry the isola- 
tion of the individual to its farthest possible extreme, it constructs, 
within these cloisters, cells, in imitation of the caves of the first her- 
mits—a seclusion the immediate consequence of which is boundless 
and most paltry curiosity. : 
[Christian monachism resembles in many of its forms that 
of Buddhism. In fact, the Abbé Huc, who visited Thibet in 
1845, found so many ceremonies of Lamaism nearly identical 
with corresponding ones of the Catholic Church that he was 
obliged to infer that they had been borrowed from the latter. 
This is not improbable, when we consider the extent to which 
Christian monachism spread over Western Asia in the first four 
centuries. The peculiar form of Buddhism known as Lamaism
-P-A-G-E-281
256 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
is of later origin than the Christian Hermit epoch, and indeed 
at least one century later than St. Benedict’s reform in monach- 
ism. In 622 Buddhism was introduced into Thibet, and Lhasa 
(Lassa) founded—the date of the birth of Mohammed. Its trans- 
formation into Lamaism may have been as late as the eleventh 
century. 
Three vows—poverty, chastity, and obedience—indicate the 
attitude toward the secular world. The three chief secular in- 
stitutions: (a) the family is attacked by the second vow, which 
aims at celibacy ; (b) civil society, or the institution for the pro- 
duction and distribution of property by means of industry, is at- 
tacked by the first vow, which renounces property; (c) the state 
is attacked by the third vow, which renounces allegiance to any 
but its religious superiors, That this extreme of quietism was a 
necessary resort in the epoch when it was established may be 
granted without question. The Church has, however, found it 
from time to time desirable to restrict this form of life. It aims 
to restrict monastic life to those who have made a hopeless 
failure in a secular life, and by it save them from despair and 
sin. In early ages it was thought to be the only life of holiness; 
now it is thought to be auxiliary to holiness in some cases.] 
§ 241. Theoretically, monkish education seeks, by 
means of complete silence, to place the soul in a state of 
spiritual immobility, which, through the want of all in- 
terchange of thought, at last sinks into entire apathy 
and antipathy toward all intellectual culture. The chief 
feature of this practical culture is caused by the ms- 
taken idea that one should ignore Nature, instead of 
morally freeing himself from her control, As Nature 
again and again asserts herself, the monkish discipline 
proceeds to ill-treat her, and strives through fasting, 
through sleeplessness, through voluntary self-inflicted 
pain and torture, not only to subdue the wantonness of 
the flesh, but to destroy the love of life till it shall be 
zome @ positive loathing of existence. In and for them 
selves the objects renounced by the monkish vow—prop
-P-A-G-E-282
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 957 
erty, the family, and individual choice—are not immoral 
The vow is, on this account, very easy to violate. In 
order to prevent all temptation to this, monkish educa- 
tion invents a system of supervision, partly open, partly 
secret, which deprives one of all freedom of action, all 
freshness of thinking and of willing, and all poetry of 
feeling, by means of the perpetual shadow of spies and 
informers. The monks are well versed in all police- 
arts, and the well-graded series of supervisors and gen- 
eral inspectors in the hierarchy spurs them on always to 
distinguish themselves in these arts of espionage. 
[Monkish discipline of fasts, vigils, and penances. Necessity 
of espionage—the support of individual resolution by the super- 
vision of one’s companions and superiors.] 
§ 242. The gloomy breath of this education pene- 
trated all the relations of the Byzantine state. Even 
the education of the emperor was infected by it; and in 
the strife for freedom waged by the modern Greeks 
against the Turks, the priors of the cloisters were the 
real leaders of the insurrection. Independence of indi- 
viduality, as opposed to monkish self-abnegation, was 
compelled more or less to degenerate into the crude 
form of soldier and pirate life. But this principle of 
free individuality was not left to manifest itself in this 
unlawful manner ; on the contrary, it was built up posi- 
tively into humanity ; and this the German world, unde: 
the guidance of the Roman Church, undertook to ac 
complish. 
[Deserted by the religious element, secularity in the Eastern 
Empire took on irregular and barbarous forms. In the West, 
under the “ Holy Roman Empire,” whose seat was in Germany, 
secularity came to be more penetrated by the influence of the 
Church, and thus arose the epoch of chivalric education.]
-P-A-G-E-283
258 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
Il. Zhe Epoch of Chivairie Education. 
§ 243. The Romish Church annulled the principle 
of abstract substantiality of the Greeks (i. e., that sup- 
pressed individuality in behalf of divinely ordained 
religious ceremonies) through the practical aim which 
she set up in the principle of sanctity in works, and by 
means of which she raised up German individuality to 
the idealism of chivalry, i.e., a free military service in 
behalf of Christendom. 
[By the principle of sanctity in works (Pelagianism), the 
Church raised German individuality to the idealism of chivalry, 
This seems strange to ordinary Protestant views. The Roman 
Catholic principle, however, corrected in this way the faulty ab- 
straction of the Greek Church.] 
§ 244. As a matter of course the system of monkish 
education which was taken up into this epoch as one of its 
elements was modified to conform to it; e. g., the Bene- 
dictines were accustomed to labor in agriculture and in 
the transcribing of books, and this contradicted the idea 
of monachism, since that in and for itself tends to an 
absolute forgetfulness of the world and a perfect absence 
of all activity in the individual. The begging orders 
were publie preachers, and made popular the idea of 
love and unselfish sacrifice for others. They gave an 
impulse to self-education, especially by holding up the 
ideal of the life of Christ; e.g.,in Tauler’s classical 
book on the “Imitation of the Life of Jesus,” and in’ 
the work of Thomas-a-Kempis, which resembles it. 
Through a constant contemplation of the mental pict- 
ure of Christ, who suffered and died for love, they 
_ sought to find content in divine rest and self-forget- 
fulness.
-P-A-G-E-284
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 959 
[Monachism in the West was modified by the-mentioned prin- 
ciple of sanctity in works, so that ora et labora became the 
motto. Industry was admitted side by side with religious cere- 
monial, Agriculture, copying of manuscripts, some of the trades, 
etc, were followed by the monks. It retained, however, elements 
of quietism.] 
§ 245. German chivalry sprang from feudalism. The 
education of those pledged to military duty had become 
confined to practice in the use of arms. The education 
of the chivalric vassals pursued the same course, refining 
it gradually through the influence of court society and 
hrough poetry, which devoted itself either to the art of 
elating graceful tales, or to the glorification of woman. 
rirls were brought up without especial care. The boy 
stil he was seven years old remained in the hands of 
romen; then he became a lad (a young gentleman), 
nd learned the art of offensive and defensive warfare, 
n foot and on horseback; between his sixteenth and 
ighteenth year, through a formal ceremony (the laying 
nu of the sword), he was duly authorized to bear arms. 
jut whatever besides this he might wish to learn was 
aft to his own caprice. 
[The education of chivalry was confined to practice in the use 
of arms, to knightly etiquette, and poetry.] 
§ 246. In contradistinction to the monkish education, 
hivalry placed an infinite value on individuality, and 
his it expressed in its extreme sensibility to the feeling 
f honor. Education, on this account, endeavored to 
oster this consciousness of self-importance by means of 
he social isolation in which it placed the knightly order. 
the knight did not delight himself with domestic af- 
airs, but he sought for him who had been wronged, 
ince in helping him to his rights he could find enjoy-
-P-A-G-E-285
260. PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
ment as aconqueror. He did not live in simple mar. 
riage, but strove for the piquant pleasure of making the 
wife of another the lady of his heart, and this often led 
to moral and carnal infidelity. And, finally, the knight 
did not obey alone the general laws of knightly honor, 
but he strove, besides, to discover for himself unusual 
tasks, which he should undertake with his sword, in 
defiance of all criticism, simply because it pleased his 
caprice so todo. He sought adventures. 
[While the monkish education repressed individuality, chiv- 
alry placed unbounded value on it. Monachism did not, it is 
true, repress essential individuality, after the manner of Oriental 
systems. It gave the soul assurance of infinite individuality as 
its eternal reward, In distinguishing between holiness and finite 
aims, however, it went to an extreme in repressing the latter. 
The knight took no pleasure in the prose of common life. He 
sought adventure. He must find some person who had been 
robbed or kidnapped whose wrongs he would undertake to right. 
He looked about for some odd and peculiar enterprise, so that he 
might realize his individuality in its pursuit. Eccentricity was 
supposed to be essential to individuality.] 
§ 247. The reaction against the numberless fantastic 
extravagancies arising from chivalry developed the idea 
of the spiritual chivalry which was to unite the cloister 
and the town, absolute self-denial and military life, sep- 
aration from the world and the sovereignty over the 
world, Although this was an undeniable advance, it was 
an untenable synthesis which could not long delay the 
dissolution of chivalry, which, as the rule of the stronger, 
led to the destruction of all regular culture founded on 
principles, and brought on a protracted period of absence 
of all education. In this perversion of chivalry toa 
grand vagabondism, and even to robbery, noble souls 
often rushed into ridiculous excesses. The downfall of
-P-A-G-E-286

chivalry prepared the way for citizenship, whose educa- 
tion, however, did not, like the wéAss and the cévitas 
of the ancients, limit itself to the narrow bounds of 
special local interests, but, through the presence of the 
principle of Christianity, accepted the whole circle of 
humanity as the aim of its culture. 
[Knight-errantry developed into a more rational form of chiv- 
alry, namely, the orders devoted to special religious purposes, 
But these did not retard the decay of the entire institution of 
ehivairy. The Crusades furnished the highest opportunity for 
the spirit of knightly individuality, and, when they had suc- 
ceeded in giving a new consciousness to Christendom by uniting 
the East and West, there was nothing left for chivalry to do. It 
degenerated into a grand vagabondism. The Crusades impover- 
ished royal treasuries, and weakened the power of the aristocra- 
cies. But the cities gained immensely, because they furnished 
troops and money to carry on the wars. Their charters were 
made strong and liberal. They were the nurseries of freemen. 
The growth of cities put an end to chivalry, and inaugurated 
the present epoch of education, that whose object is citizenship.]

dependence on the mediation of any man, adopted the 
principle of the autonomy of the soul, and began to 
develop Christianity, as the principle of humanitarian 
education, into concrete actuality, and to free it from 
the creations of the imagination, with which monasticism 
and chivalry had clothed it. The cities were not mere- 
ly, in comparison with the clergy and the nobility, the 
“third estate”; but the citizen who himself managed 
his political affairs, and defended his interests with 
arms, developed into the order of state-citizen, which 
absorbed the clergy and nobility, and the state-citizen 
found his ultimate ideal in pure humanity conscious of 
its rationality. 
{The growth of citizenship found a special confirmation in the 
Protestant movement, whose most important feature was the 
recognition of secularism as one essential phase of Christian civ- 
ilization.] 
§ 249. The phases of this development are (1) civil 
education as such, within which we find also the chival- 
ric education metamorphosed. into the so-called nobility 
education, these two forms, however, being controlled, 
as to education, within Catholicism by Jesuitism, within 
Protestantism by pietism. (2) Against this exclusive 
tendency toward the Church, we find reacting on the one 
hand the devotion to a study of antiquity, and on the 
other the friendly alliance with immediate actuality, i.e., 
with Nature. We can name these periods of the his- 
tory of education those of its ideals of culture. (8) But 
the true aim of all culture must forever remain. moral 
freedom. After education had arrived at a knowledge 
of the meaning of idealism and realism, it must seize as 
its absolute aim the moral emancipation of man into

| humanity; and it must subordinate its culture to this 
aim, inasmuch as technical dexterity, social accomplish- 
ment, proficiency in the arts, and scientific insight, can 
attain to their proper rank only through moral purity. 
{The three phases of development of this epoch are: (1) The 
education of the citizen as opposed to the education of the na- 
bility, both controlled by religious education—Jesuitism within 
Catholicism and Pietism within Protestantism. (2) A counter- 
movement arose as a reaction against the too exclusive control 
of the Church, on the one hand devoted to the study of ancient 
languages and history, on the other hand devoted to natural 
science. (8) The further progress of education unites and recon- 
ciles these two tendencies.]   Ee ee 
L. Ciwil Education as such, 
§ 250. The one-sidedness of monkish and chivalric 
education was overcome by civil education in so far as 
it set aside the celibacy of the monk and the estrange- 
ment of the knight from his family, doing this by in- 
creasing the hold of family life upon the individual ; for 
it set up, as its standard of perfect living, the positive 
morality of marriage and the family in the place of the 
negative duty of holiness of the celibate; while, instead 
of the poverty and idleness of monkish piety and instead 
of chivalric wealth, it tanght that property and labor 
were worthy objects of man—i. e., it advocated the self- 
determined morality of civil society and of its transac- 
tions; and, finally, instead of the slavery of the con- 
science, in the form of implicit obedience to the com- 
mand of others, and instead of the freakish self-sufficien- 
ey of the caprice of the knights, it demanded obedience 
to the laws of the commonwealth as representing his 
own self-conscious, actualized, practical reason, in which
-P-A-G-E-289
264 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
laws the individual can recognize and acknowledge him 
self. 
As this civil education left free the enjoyment of the body, 
sensuality was without bounds for a time, until, after men became 
accustomed to Jabor and to know their privileges and capacities for 
physical satisfaction, they gradually learned a moderation which 
sumptuary laws and prohibitions of gluttony and drunkenness could 
never create from the external side. What the monk inconsistent- 
ly enjoyed with a bad conscience, the citizen, like the preacher in 
Ecclesiastes, could take possession of as a gift of God. After the 
first millennium of Christianity, when the earth had not, according 
to the current prophecies of the millennialists, been destroyed, and 
after the great plague in the fourteenth century, there was felt an 
immense pleasure in living, which manifested itself externally in the 
fifteenth century in delicate wines, dainty food, great eating of meat, 
drinking of beer, and, in the domain of dress, in trunk-hose, peaked 
shoes, plumes, golden chains, bells, ete. There was much venison, 
but as yet no potatoes, no tea and coffee. The temper of men was 
quarrelsome. [Reference here to Sebastian Brant, etc., omitted.] 
[Civil education (a) overcomes the estrangement of the knight 
from his family and of the monk from secularity. It sets up 
marriage and the family as the ethical ideal; (6) it opposes the 
poverty of the monk and the wealth of the knight by claiming 
for labor and its productions a higher place; (¢) instead of 
obedience to the spiritual superior and the eaprice of the knight, 
it required obedience to the laws of the commonwealth as laws 
demanded by the reason and self-interest of all. Great sensu- 
ality prevailed for a time after the advent of this epoch.] 
§ 251. In contrast with the heaven-seeking of the 
monks and the sentimental love-making of the knight, 
civil education established, as its principle, usefulness, 
which investigated in things their adaptation to various 
purposes in order to gain such mastery over them as 
was found possible. The understanding was trained 
with all exactness, that it might clearly perceive the ob- 
jects in the world. But since family-life did not allow 
the self-concentration of the individual ever to become as
-P-A-G-E-290
great as was the case with the monk and the knight, 
and since the cheer of a sensuous enjoyment in cellar 
; and kitchen, in clothing and furniture, in social games 
and in gorgeous pageants, penetrated the whole being 
with soft pleasure, there was developed a sense of pro- 
priety and sobriety, a sort of house-morality, and, united 
with the prose of labor, a warm and kindly disposition, 
’ which left room for innocent merriment and roguery, 
and found its serious transfiguration in the staid and 
solemn demeanor at church. Beautiful burgher-state, 
thou wast weakened by the Thirty Years’ War, and hast 
been only accidentally preserved sporadically in Old 
England and in some places in Germany, only to be at

‘ 
  (Usefulness, or adaptation of finite things to rational purposes, 
was set up as the principle. ‘The extremes of individualism 
were tempered by the family influence at home and by the in- 
fluence of the clergy and the ceremonies of the Church.] . 
§ 252. The citizen paid special attention to public 
education, heretofore wholly dependent upon the Church 
and the cloister; he organized city schools, whose teach- 
ers, it is true, for a long time possessed only superticial 
culture, and were often employed only for uncertain or 
short terms. The society of the brotherhood of the 
Hieronymites introduced a better system of instruction 
before the close of the fourteenth century, but education 
had often to be obtained from the so-called traveling 
scholars (vagantes, bacchantes, scholastici, goliardi, ete.). 
The teachers of the so-called scholw eateriores, in dis- 
tinction from the schools of the cathedral and cloister, 
were called here Jocati, there stampuales—in German,
-P-A-G-E-291
266 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
Kinder-Meister. The institution of German schoole 
soon followed the Latin city schools. In order to re- 
move the anarchy in school matters, the citizens aided 
the rise of universities by donations and foundations, 
and sustained the street-singing of the city scholars 
(currende), an institution which was well-meant, but 
which often failed of its end because on the one hand it 
was often misused as a mere means of subsistence, and 
on the other hand the sense of honor of those for whom 
it was established not unfrequently became, through 
their manner of living, lowered and degraded. The 
defect of the monkish method of instruction became 
ever more apparent, e. g., the silly tricks of their mne- 
motechnique, the utter lack of anything which deserved 
the name of any practical knowledge. The necessity 
of instruction in the use of arms led to democratic forms. 
Printing favored the same. Men began to concern 
themselves about good text-books. Melanchthon was 
the hero of the Protestant world, and as a pattern was 
beyond his time. His “ Dialecties,” “Rhetoric,” “ Phys- 
ics,” and “Ethics,” were reprinted innumerable times, 
commented upon, and imitated. After him Amos Co- 
menius, in the seventeenth century, had the greatest in- 
fluence through his “ Didactica Magna” and his “Janua 
Reserata.” In a narrower sphere, treating of the founda- 
tion of philology in the gymnasiums (classical schools), 
the most noticeable is Sturm, of Strasburg. The uni- 
versities in Catholic countries limited themselves to the 
scholastic philosophy and theology, together with which 
we find slowly struggling up to notice the study of 
Roman Jaw and medicine in Bologna and Salerno. But 
Protestantism first raised the university to any real uni

versality. Tiibingen, Koénigsberg, Wittenberg, Jena, 
Leipsic, Halle, and Gdttingen were the first schools for 
the study of all sciences, and for their free and produc- 
tive pursuit. 
[Here begins the organization of the school as an independent 
institution. Traveling scholars. “Outside schools,” as distin- 
guished from those of the cathedral and cloister. Endowments 
of universities by wealthy citizens. Melanchthon’s text-books

directions the influence of his study of Lord Bacon’s works, 
In the “ Advancement of Learning” one finds the basis of the 
Janua Lingue Latine Reserata of Comenius, as well as his sys- 
tem of classification and grading of pupils, and of his course of 
study. “Know all things (learning); master all things and 
one’s self (virtue); find the relation of all to God (piety)”: these 
Comenius held to be the objects of the school. 
John Sturm, of Strasburg (1507-1589), long before Comenius, 
had laid the foundation of what has become the traditional 
course of instruction and methods of study in the classical 
schools for preparation for college. Scholastic philosophy and 
theology stili held the chief place in Catholic universities. The 
German universities became the first schools for the study of all 
seience.] 
§ 253. The cities, which at first appeared with the 
clergy and the nobility as the third estate, formed an 
alliance with monarchy, and both together produced a 
transformation of the chivalric education. Absolute 
monarchy reduced the knights to mere nobles, to whom 
it conceded the prerogative of appointment as spiritual 
prelates as well as officers and counselors of state, but 
only on the condition of the most complete submission ; 
and then, to satisfy them, it invented the artificial social 
revels of splendid court-life, and a charming and impos- 
ing array of beauty. In this condition, the education 
of the nobles was essentially changed in so far as to cease
-P-A-G-E-293
968 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
to be merely military. To the practice of arms, which, 
moreover, was made of very much less consequence by 
the democratic device of fire-arms, must be now added a 
special training of the mind which could no longer dis- 
pense with some knowledge of history, heraldry, gene- 
alogy, literature, and mythology. Since the French 
nation gave tone to the style of conversation, and after 
the time of Louis XIV controlled the polities of the 
Continent, the French language, as conventional and 
diplomatic, became a constant element in the education 
of the nobility in all the other countries of Europe. 
Practically, the education of the noble endeavored to equip the 
individual with accomplishments, so that he should, by means of the 
important quality of an advantageous personal appearance and the 
prudence of his agreeable behavior, make himself into a ruler of all 
other men, and even of his equals in rank—i.e., he should copy in 
miniature the manners of an absolute sovereign. The practical 
knowledge of men was on this account made of the highest impor- 
tance, and, under the form of ethical maxims, taught how to discover 
the weak side of every man, and so be able to outwit him. Mundus 
vult dectpi, ergo decipiatur. According to this, every man had his 
price. They did not believe in the Nemesis of a divine ordination ; 
on the contrary, disbelief in the higher justice was taught. One 
must be so elastic as to suit himself to all situations, and, as a carica- 
ture of the ancient ataraxy, he must acquire as a second nature a 
manner perfectly indifferent to all changes, the impassibility of an 
aristocratic repose, the amphibious cold-bloodedness of the “ gentle- 
man.” The man of the world, like a worldling, sought his ideal in 
endless dissimulation, and this, as the flowering of his culture, he 
made his chief end. Intrigue, in love as well as in politics, was the 
soul of the nobleman’s existence. 
They endeavored to procure refinement of manners by sending 
the young man away with a traveling tutor. This was very good, but 
degenerated at last into the mechanism of the mere sight-seeing 
tourist. The noble was made a foreigner, a stranger to his own coun- 
try, by means of his abode at Paris or Venice, while the citizen grad. 
nally outstripped him in genuine culture,

[The citizen-class appeared as a “third estate” between the 
nobles and the clergy (as explained in the commentary on § 247), 
The power of the king increased, and, assisted by the cities, was 
able to reduce the haughty nobles to obedience to law and order. 
The education of the nobility now ceased to be exclusively mili- 
tary. History, heraldry, literature, etc., began to be studied. Es- 
pecially important is the fact that the French language became 
the court language for diplomacy as well as for polite intercourse, 
The nobleman was educated to make himself a ruler over 
men, Great attention was given to his personal carriage. Cer- 
tain worldly-wise maxims, entirely unscrupulous as to moral 
contents, became current. “The world wishes to be deceived, 
therefore let it be deceived.” “Every man has his price.” 
This worldliness assumed the form of a versatile diplomacy 
which was able to pursue its ends through dissimulation, pre- 
serving, under all its different faces, the impassivity of aristo- 
cratie repose, which was the ideal of the “ gentleman.” 
The self-estrangement (see §§ 28, 24, commentary) necessary 
for culture was sought in foreign travel and residence abroad, 
besides, in the use of the French language when at home, in 
London, or Vienna.]} 
§ 254. The education of the citizen as well as that 
of the noble was taken possession of, in Catholic coun- 
tries by the Jesuits, in Protestant countries by the Pie- 
tists: by the first, with a military strictness; by the sec- 
ond, in a sociable and gentle form. Both, however, 
agreed in destroying individuality, inasrauch as the one 
degraded man into a will-less machine for executing the 
commands of others, and the other deadened him in 
cultivating the feeling of his sinful worthlessness.

uits as well by their strict military discipline as by their system ot 
mutual mistrust, espionage, and informing. Implicit obedience re- 
lieved the pupils from all responsibility as to the moral justification 
of their deeds. This exact following out of all commands, and re- 
fraining from any criticism as to principles, created a moral indiffer- 
ence, and, from the necessity of having consideration for the peculiar 
ities and caprices of the superior on whom all others were depend 
ent, arose eye-service. The coolness of mutual distrust sprang from. 
the necessity which each felt of being on his guard against every 
other as a tale-bearer. The most deliberate hypocrisy and pleasure in 
intrigue merely for the sake of intrigue—this subtilest poison of moral 
corruption—were the result. Jesuitism had not only an interest in the 
material profit, which, when it had corrupted souls, fell to its share, 
but it also had an interest in the educative process of corruption. 
With absolute indifference as to the idea of morality, and absolute 
indifference as to the moral quality of the means used to attain its 
end, it rejoiced in the efficacy of secrecy, and the accomplished and 
calculating understanding, and in deceiving the credulous by means 
of its graceful, seemingly scrupulous, moral language. 
It is not necessary to speak here of the morality of the order. 
It is sufficiently recognized as its fundamental contradiction, that 
while it taught that the idea of morality insists upon the eternal 
necessity of conformity to duty in every deed, on the other hand 
it taught that in actual practice this conformity to moral precept 
should be made to depend on circumstances. As to discipline, 
they were always guided by their fundamental principle, that body 
and soul, as in and for themselves one, could vicariously suffer for 
each other. ‘Thus penitence and contrition were transformed into a 
perfect materialism of outward actions, and hence arose the punish- 
ments of the order, in which fasting, scourging, imprisonment, morti- 
fication, and death were formed into a mechanical artificial system. 
[The Jesuit system of education, organized in 1584 by Clau- 
dius of Aquaviva, was intended to meet the active influence of 
Protestantism in education. It was remarkably successful, and 
for a century nearly all the foremost men of Christendom came 
from Jesuit schools. In 1710 they had six hundred and twelve 
colleges, one hundred and fifty-seven normal schools, twenty- 
four universities, and an immense number of lower schools. 
‘These schools laid very great stress on emulation. Their ex- 
periments in this principle are so extensive and long-continued

that they furnish a most valuable phase in the history of peda-| 
gogy in this respect alone. In the matter of supervision they’ 
are also worthy of study. They had a fivefold system, each| 
subordinate being implicitly obedient to his superior, Besides 
this, there was a complete system of espionage on the part of 
teachers and pupil monitors.] 
(0) Pietistic Education. 
§ 256. Jesuitism would make machines of man, Pi- 
etism would dissolve him in the feeling of his sinful- 
ness: either would destroy his individuality. Pietism 
proceeded from the principle of Protestantism, as, in 
the place of the Catholic Pelagianism with its sanctifica- 
tion by works, it offered justification by faith alone. In 
its tendency to internality, i.e., to laying stress on the 
inward state of the heart and the attitude of the will, 
was its just claim. It would have even the letters of 
the Bible learned with religions emotion. But in its 
execution it fell into the error of one-sidedness in that 
it placed, instead of the actual freedom accorded to the 
individual by the spirit of Christianity, the imprison- 
ment of a limited personality, supplanted free individu- 
ality by the personality of Christ in an external manner, 
and thus brought back into the very midst of Protest- 
antism the principle of monachism— an abstract re- 
nunciation of the world. Since Protestantism had de- 
stroyed the idea of the cloister, it could produce 
estrangement from the world only by exciting public 
opinion against such social amusements and culture as 
it stigmatized as worldly for its members, e. g., card- 
playing, dancing, the theatre, ete. Thus it became 
negatively dependent upon works; for since its follow- 
ers remained in constant relation with the world, so that

the temptation to backsliding was a permanent one, it 
must watch over them, exercise an indispensable moral- 
police control over them, and thus, by the distrust of 
each other which was involved, take up into itself the 
Jesuitical practice, although in a very mild and affec- 
tionate way. Instead of the forbidden seclusion of the 
cloister, it organized a separate company, which, in its 
regularly constituted assembly, we call a conventicle. 
Instead of the cowl, it put on its youth a dress like that 
of the world in its cut, but scant and drab-colored ; it 
substituted for the tonsure a fashion of cutting and part- 
ing the hair, and it often went beyond the obedience 
of the monks in its expression of pining humility and 
punctilious submission. Education within such a circle 
could not well recognize Nature and history as revela- 
tions of God, but it must consider them to be obstacles 
to their union with God, from which death alone could 
completely release them. The soul, which knew that 
its home could be found only in the future world, must 
feel itself to be a stranger upon the earth, and from such 
an opinion there must arise an indifference and even a 
contempt for science and art, as well as an aversion for 
a life of active labor, though an unwilling and forced 
tribute might be paid to it. Philosophy especially was 
to be shunned as dangerous. Bible-reading, the cate- 
chism, and the hymn-book, althongh quite mechanically 
used, were the one thing needful to the “ poor in spirit.” 
Religious poetry and sacred music were, of all the arts, 
the only ones deserving of any cultivation. The educa- 
tion of Pietism endeavored, by means of a carefully 
arranged series of symbolic expressions, to create in its 
disciples the feeling of their absolute nothingness, vile-

ness, godlessness, and abandonment by God, in order 
lift them out of the abyss of despair in regard .to them, 
selves and the world, and bring them into a warm, dre 
matic, and living relation to Christ—a relation in whi 
all the erotic passion of the mystical fervor of the men 
dicant-friars was renewed in a somewhat milder form 
and with a strong tendency to a sickening sentimentality. 
[The Protestant counterpart of Jesuitism was Pietism, in 
whith there was a tendency toward relapse into the principle of 
monachism. It laid so much stress on the letter that there was 
not strength enough left to duly emphasize the spirit. J. Spener 
(1635-1705) and A. H. Francke (1668-1727) were the founders 
of this movement. It came so far as to be hostile toward the 
cultivation of the intellect and practical will. There should be 
no wsthetics except in the matter of sacred songs (“ psalm- 
tunes”); no science, and no history except sacred history. The 
Quakers and the Puritans who settled in America brought with 
them some of the features of the Pietists. The truth of Pietism 
was its struggle to realize the living presence of God in the af- 
fairs of men. The truth of Jesuitism was the importance to the 
Church of preventing a separation between secular education: 
and religious education. The Church, during its first twelve 
centuries, had held aloof trom the secular. From the thirteenth 
to the sixteenth centuries it had striven to bring the Church into 
the secular, and thereby to guide and mold it, The Jesuit move- 
ment was a renewal of the Dominican and Franciscan move- 
ments (see commentary to § 234) of the thirteenth century. 
Then the danger came from Arabian schools of science and 
philosophy in Spain; now it was Protestantism, with its doo 
trine of the right of individual jndgment.]

CHAPTER IX. 
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. III. The 
Epoch of Hducation fitting one for Civil Life 
(concluded). 
§ 257. Crviz education arose from the recognition 
of marriage and the family, of labor and enjoyment, of 
the equality of all before the law, and of the duty of 
, self-determination. Jesnitism in the Catholic world and 
Pietism in the Protestant were the reaction against this 
| recognition—a return into the asceticism of the middle 
. ages; not, however, in its purity, but mitigated by some 
regard for worldly affairs. In opposition to this reac- 
tion the interests of citizen-life produced another, in 
which it undertook to save individuality by means of a 
different kind of alienation. On the one hand, it be- 
came absorbed in the study of the Greek and Roman 
world; on the other hand, it occupied itself with the 
practical interests of the present. In the former case, 
it placed man outside of his present world in a distant 
past which held to the present no immediate relation, 
in the latter case took him out of himself and oceupied 
his attention with the affairs which were to serve him 
as means of his comfort and enjoyment. In the former 
it created an abstract idealism—a reproduction of the 
ancient view—in the latter it set up an abstract real- 
ism in a high appreciation of things which ought to be 
considered of value only as a means. In the one direc- 2. The Ideal of Culture.

tion, individuality was lost in the contempl 
tinct nations; in the other, it was lost in 
business. In one case, the ideal was that of 
republicanism of the Greeks; in the othe 
tarian cosmopolitanism of the Romans. Bui 
against these two extremes, there arose :

[Civil education rested on these four things recogni:

and enjoyment of its products; (c) equality of all befo 
no personal tyranny ; (d) the duty of thinking for one 
acting according to the dictates of one’s own conscient.. + wu 
ism and Pietism were the Catholic and Protestant reactions 
against this new spirit. A counter-reaction against these now 
set in: the study of the Greek and Latin classics on the one 
hand and a study of natural science on the other. These were

humanity as such had become almost lost in dogmatic 
differences of opinion on trifling details. The spirit was’ 
renewed in the first by the contemplation of the pure 
patriotism of the ancients, and in the second by the dis- 
covery of rational insight among the heathen. In con- 
trast to the provincial Philistinism and against the want 
of refined ideals and the lack of refined taste, was ar- 
rayed the power of culture derived from the contem- 
plation of antique art. The so-called uselessness of 
learning dead languages imparted to the mind, it knew 
aot how, an ideal drift. The very fact that it could not 
find immediate profit in its knowledge gave it the con- 
sciousness that there is something of a higher value than 
naterial profit. The ideal of the humanities was the 
ruth to nature which was found in the monuments of 
the ancient world. The study of language as form, 
nust lead one involuntarily to the actual seizing of its 
neaning. The Latin schools grew into Gymnasia, and 
he universities contained not merely professors of elo- 
{uence, but also teachers of philology. 
[The study of the Latin and Greek classics was supposed to 
secure the development of a pure humanity, or in other words to 
develop human nature in its entirety. The Greeks and Romans 
had been true to nature, and the study of their languages and 
literatures would do most to set the youth into harmony with 
himself. These reasons are not quite so satisfactory as those 
which ground the importance of classic study on the fact that 
modern civilization is derivative; resting on the Greek for its 
esthetics and science; resting on the Roman for its legal and 
political forms. A study of Latin and Greek gives the modern 
youth a “self-estrangement” which ends by his becoming fa~ 
miliar with the view of the world held at Rome and Athens. 
‘When he can see the world from the standpoints of those peoples 
who were competent by their original genius to invent art and 
20 | eharch limited by a confessional, to which the idea of

science and jurisprudence, our modern youth finds himself re 
turned from out his “self-estrangement” with the capacity to 
see and comprehend those important strands of his civilization 
that were before invisible to him or seen only dimly. The study 
of Latin and Greek is the study of the embryology of our civil- 
ization, 
In this view we are interested especially in the history of the 
modern study of the classics. Trotzendorf (1490-1556), who went 
to Wittenberg in 1518 and taught with Melanchthon, and was rec- 
tor of the Gymnasium at Gorlits for twenty-five years, is one of 
the most important names. Sturm is another (see § 252, com- 
mentary), The powerful effect of classic study in giving the 
youth possession of himself has been noted for centuries. The 
explanation of it has varied. In the expression “humanities” 
(Rumaniora, or literw humaniores) is suggested the theory that 
the classics are especially adapted to Awmanize the youth. If 
this means that they give him an insight into human nature as 
nothing else does, the expression is very apt. Human nature 
has shown itself especially in the Greek and Roman peoples, ris- 
ing to wonderful heights ot intellect and will-power. But this 
does not state so directly the present value of those languages as 
the view above presented, namely, that they give the pupil the 
point of view of the original inventors of art, science, and juris- 
prudence, and hence their study is to all modern civilized peo- 
ples (whose culture is derivative) a study of their own spiritual 
embryology, and therefore indispensable for direct self-knowl- 
edge. The vague expression “discipline of mind” has been 
much used to express the valuable result of classic study, but it 
does not hint at the genuine source of the culture as the word 
humanities does.) 
(6) The Philanthropic Ideal. 
$959. The humanitarian tendency reached its ex- 
treme in the complete forgetting of the present, and the 
neglect of its just claim. Man discovered at last that 
he was not at home with himself, although he had made 
himself at home in Rome and Athens. He spoke and 
wrote Latin, if not like Cicero, at least like Muretius, but

| 
he often found himself awkward in expressing his mean- 
ing in his mother-tongue. He was often very learned, 
| but he lacked judgment. He was filled with enthusiasm 
| for the republicanism of Greece and Rome, and yet at 
the same time was himself exceedingly servile to his ex- 
| cellent and august lords, Against this gradual deadening 
of active individuality, the result of an abnormal study 
| of the classics, we find now reacting the education of 
the age of revolution, which we generally call the philan- 
thropic education. It sought to make men friendly to 
the immediate course of the world. It placed over 
against the learning of the ancient languages for their 
own sake the acquisition of the branches useful in earn- 
ing one’s living—mathematies, physics, geography, his- 
tory, and the modern languages, calling these the real- 
ity-studies (“ Realien”). Nevertheless, it retained chief 
place in the instruction in the Latin language because 
the Romance languages have sprung from it, and be- 
eause, through its long domination, the entire terminol- 
ogy of science, art, and law, is derived from it. Phi- 
lanthropic education desired to develop the social side 
of its pupils through a compendium of practical knowl- 
edge and personal accomplishments, and to lead him 
out of the hermit-like sedentary life of the book-pedant 
into the fields and the woods. It desired to imitate life 
even in its method, and to instruct entertainingly in the 
way of play or by conversation. It would add to the 
printed words and names the objects themselves, or at 
least their representation by pictures; and in this direc- 
tion, in the literature which it prepared for the enter- 
tainment of children, it sometimes strayed into childish- 
ness. It performed a great service when it gave to the
-P-A-G-E-305
280 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
body its due, and introduced simple, natural dress, bath- 
ing, gymnastics, pedestrian excursions, and thereby bard- 
ened it against the influences of wind and weather. 
As this system of education, so friendly to children, 
believed that it could not soon enough begin to honor 
them as citizens of the world, it committed the error of 
presupposing as already finished in its children much 
that it itself should have gradually developed ; and as it 
wished to educate the pupil into-the general ideal of 
humanity rather than into that of a particular province 
or sect, it became indifferent concerning the concrete 
distinctions of nationality and religion. It agreed with 
certain philologists in placing, in an indirect manner, 
Socrates above Christ, because he had worked no mir- 
acles, and taught only morality. In such a dead cos- 
mopolitanism, individuality disappeared in the indeter- 
minateness of a general “humanity,” and saw itself 
forced to agree with the humanistic education in pro- 
claiming the truth of nature as the educational ideal, 
with the distinction that, while humanism believed this 
ideal realized in the Greeks and Romans, Philanthro- 
pinism found itself compelled to presuppose an abstract 
natural man, and often manifested a not unjustifiable 
pleasure in recognizing in the Indian of North America, 
or the savage of Otaheite, the genuine man of Nature. 
Philosophy developed these abstract views into the idea 
of a rational political state-government, which should in- 
corporate within its organism the scientific knowledge 
of whatever is rational, and should adopt as reforms all 
changes demanded by the growth of such science. 
The course which the development of the philanthropic ideal 
has taken is as follows: (1) Rousseau, in his writings, “ Emile” and
-P-A-G-E-306
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 9281 
the “ Nouvelle Héloise,” first preached the evangel of natural ed-1ca- 
tion, the emancipation from historic precedents and tradition, the ne- 
gation of existing culture, and the return to the simplicity and inno- 
cence of Nature. Although he often himself testified in his expe- 
rience his own proneness to evil in a very discouraging manner, he 
fixed as an almost universally accepted axiom in French and German 
pedagogies his principal maxim, that man is by nature good. (2) 
The reformatory ideas of Rousseau met with only a very infrequent 
and sporadic introduction among the Romanic nations, because 
among them education was too dependent on the Church, and re- 
tained its cloister-like seclusion in seminaries, colleges, etc. In Ger- 
many, on the contrary, they were put into practice, and the Philan- 
thropina, established by Basedow in Dessau, Brunswick, and Schnep- 
ienthal, made experiments, which nevertheless very soon departed 
somewhat from the extreme views of Basedow himself, and had many 
excellent results. (3) Humanity exists in conereto only in the form of 
nations. The French nation, in their first. Revolution, tried the ex- 
periment of emancipating themselves from historic tradition, of lev- 
eling all distinctions of culture, of enthroning a despotism of reason, 
and of organizing itself as humanity, pure and simple. The event 
showed the impossibility of such an undertaking. The national 
energy, the historical impulse, the love of art and science, came forth 
from the midst of the revolutionary movement which was directed 
to their destruction more vigorously than ever. The grande nation, 
their grande armée, and glotre—that is to say, glory for France— 
supplanted all the humanitarian phrases. In Germany the philan- 
thropic circle of education was limited at first to the higher ranks. 
There was no exclusiveness in the Philanthropina, for there nobles 
and citizens, Catholics and Protestants, Russians and Swiss, were 
mingled ; but these were always the children of wealthy families, and 
to these the plan of education was adapted. 
Then appeared Pestalozzi and directed education also to the 
jJower classes of society—those which are called, not without some- 
thing approaching to a derogatory meaning, the people. From this 
time dates popular education, the effort for the intellectual and 
moral elevation of the hitherto neglected atomistic human being of 
the non-property-holding multitude. There shall in future be no 
dirty, hungry, ignorant, awkward, thankless, and will-less mass, de- 
voted alone to an animal existence. We can never rid ourselves of 
the lower classes by having the wealthy give something, or even their
-P-A-G-E-307
282 PARTICULAR SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. 
all, to the poor; but we can rid ourselves of them in the’sense that 
the possibility of culture and independent self-support shall be open 
to every one, because he is a human being and a citizen of the com- 
monwealth. Ignorance and rudeness, and the vice which springs 
from them, and the malevolent frame of mind that hates civil laws 
and ordinances and generates crime—these shall disappear. Educa- 
tion shall train man to self-conscious obedience to law, as well as to 
kindly feeling toward the erring, and to an effort not merely for their 
punishment, but for their improvement. But the more Pestalozai 
endeavored to realize his ideal of human dignity, the more he com- 
prehended that the isolated power of a private man could not attain 
it, but that the nation itself must make the education of its people 
its first business. Fichte by his lectures first made the German na- 
tion fully accept these thoughts, and Prussia was the first state 
which, by her public schools and her military preparation for de- 
fense, led the way with clear consciousness in providing for national 
education; while among the Romanic nations, in spite of their more 
elaborate political formalism, it still depends partly upon the Church 
and partly upon the accident of private enterprise. Pestalozzi also 
laid a foundation for a national pedagogical literature by his story of 
“Leonard and Gertrude.” This book appeared in 1784, the same 
year in which Schiller’s “Robbers” and Kant’s “Critique of Pure 
Reason” announced a new phase in the drama and in philosophy. 
The incarnation of God, which was, up to the time of the Ref- 
ormation, an esoteric mystery of the Church, has since then become 
continually more and more an exoteric problem of the state. 
{In the schools of Trotzendorf and Sturm the youth were 
trained as though they were to live in Rome or Athens. A 
wise insight into the principle of self-estrangement takes note of 
the importance of so conducting the return from it that the pu- 
pil does not get set in foreign ways so firmly that he never re- 
turns to his present environment. The danger of humanism is 
that it makes the means into the end, and does not provide for 
a return out of the Latin and Greek world to the modern world. 
The moderns, represented by (a) the natural sciences, (b) the nod- 
ern languages and literatures, and (c) modern history, constitute 
the return phase of this course of study. It is not a question of 
preferring one for the other: they are parts of one whole. Any

studies and information studies—or self-estrangement studies 
and familiar-reality studies, The latter studies—the “mod- 
erns” or the “information” studies are advocated by the “ phil- 
anthropic ” or “philanthropinist ” educators under the name of 
“real” studies. The outcome of these two extremes, separately 
earried out, results, curiously enough, in setting up an ideal hu- 
man nature. Humanism sets up the Greek and Roman human- 
ity, while Philanthropinism, or realism, sets up an imaginary 
“natural man” unspoiled by artificial culture: (1) Rousseau 
preached the evangel of “return to Nature.” It is amazing to 
see how universally his maxim has been adopted, and how 
thoughtlessly it is used. There is a confusion here between 
“nature” as it exists in real forms in time and space, and “na- 
ture” as it exists as an ideal, which is not yet realized. Human 
nature is not a real form in time and space, like a rock or tree, 
but is brought forth by self-activity, self-development. More- 
over, human nature is a participation on the part of one indi- 
vidual in the results that his race have brought forth. Educa- 
. tion seeks to render the individual able to participate in the 
experience of all men—giving him the result of their percep- 
tion and reflection, of their deeds and the consequences for weal 
or woe that flowed from them. Civilization is not an artificial 
structure in the sense that Rousseau dreamed it to be, but it is 
the gigantic revelation, of what is in human nature as a possi- 
bility, worked out in extenso in time and space. 
(2) Rousseau’s educational ideas were suppressed among the 
Romanic nations, but were put into practice in Germany, espe- 
cially by Basedow in his “Philanthropinum.” In France they 
‘were not acted upon in education, but they produced a far more 
. startling effect in exploding the French Revolution. 
(8) The French tried to emancipate themselves from historic 
. tradition and to live “according to Nature,” but with most dis- 
mal results. It is likely to prove useful for many centuries as 
an educational spectacle. The nation discovered its “state of 
nature” to be a “self-estrangement,” from which it slowly re- 
turned through the process of Bonapartism to Bourbonism; 
again to make new departures and new returns before finally 
reaching the true state of human nature. 
Perhaps the happiest result of Rousseau is his effect on Pesta- 
- lozzi. The education of the people as people—popular educa-

tion that reaches all classes~owes to Pestalozzi the greatest 
debt, and through him to Rousseau still a large obligation, We 
shall in the future rid ourselves of the “dirty, hungry, ignorant, 
thriftless, thankless, and will-less masses devoted to a merely ani- 
mal existence.” They will all be developed in youth in the 
school and made self-active and intelligent, and by this means 
become self-helpful. Pestalozzi made the problem clear to all 
Europe. Fichte persuaded Prussia to adopt public education as 
a state policy. Since the Franco-Prussian War, public schools 
for the education of the people have spread very widely through- 
out Europe. 
Since Pestalozzi, and with him as one of the greatest of edu- 
cational reformers, has appeared Friedrich Froebel. His mission 
was directed to providing a proper form of school education for 
the younger children not qualified to enter the primary school. 
The school has begun hitherto with teaching the “convention- 
alities of intelligence,” readitg, writing, ete. Froebel would 
have the younger children receive a symbolic education, plays, 
games, and occupations which symbolize the primitive arts of 
man. Play should be the activity utilized for the first education 
of the child.] 
3. Free Education. 
§ 260. The ideal of culture of the humanist and 
the philanthropic education was taken up into the con- 
ception of an education which recognizes the family, 
social station, the nation, and religion as positive ele- 
ments of the practical spirit, but which will require that 
each of these shall be defined from within through the 
idea of humanity, and brought into reciprocal relation 
with all the others. Physical development shall become 
the object of a national system of gymnastics, adopted 
universally by the people, and including the drill in the 
use of arms. Instruction, in respect to a general en- 
cyclopedic culture, ought to be the same for all, and 
parallel to this should run a system of special schools to

prepare for the special vocations of life. . The method 
of instruction ought to be the simple exposition of the 
special idea of each branch, and this should not be sacri- 
ficed any longer to the formal breadth of a literary treat- 
ment of many things which may find outside the schoul 
its opportunity, but within it has no meaning except as 
the history of a science or an art. Moral culture must 
be combined with family affection and the knowledge 
of the laws of the commonwealth, so that the collision 
between individual morality and objective legality may 
ever more and more disappear. Education ought, with- 
out violently estranging the individual from the inter- 
nality of the family, to accustom him gradually to the 
life of the people as it actually exists, because a knowl- 
edge of human nature [as one obtains it by associating 
with all classes in public schools] furnishes the standpoint 
whence to obtain a just survey of the whole, and is the 
only thing which can prevent the cynicism of private 
life, the one-sidedness of knowledge and perverseness 
of will, and the spirit of caste, which has so extensively 
prevailed. The individual ought to be educated into a 
self-consciousness of the essential equality and freedom 
of all men, so that he shall recognize and acknowledge 
himself in each one and in all. But this essential and 
solid unity of all men must not degenerate into the in- 
sipidity of a humanity without distinctions, but instead 
it, must realize the form of a concrete individuality and 
nationality, and transfigure the idiosyncrasy of its nation 
into a broad humanity. The unrestricted striving after 
beauty, truth, and freedom, presently and of its own 
accord, and not merely through ecclesiastical interme- 
diation, will Jead to religion.

«| The edneation of the state must furnish a preparation 
for the unfettered activity of self-conscious humanity. 
[In the “free education ” of the future, whose object shall be 
the emancipation of each individual, there must be schools that 
give a common general education, supplemented by special 
schools for the special vocations of life. The education by the 
newspaper is one of the most noteworthy phenomena of our 
time. Where all the people read and where the vast majority of 
the people live in cities or near railroad-stations in the country, 
the daily newspaper brings to each person at his breakfast a sur- 
vey of the entire world. Compared with the village gossip in 
olden times, this general survey is a miraculous instrument of 
education in the humanizing direction. While it educates it 
governs, and few nations now exist that do not consider very 
earefully how their conduct will appear, when it, by the tele- 
graph and the daily newspaper, is placed under the inspection of 
the entire world. Modern literature, which follows the daily 
newspaper into every family, contributes an increasingly power- 
ful element in education. The prose novel makes every one fa- 
miliar with the peculiarities of foreign people, and a genuine 
human interest in the details of life, as they exist among all 
nations has arisen. This is producing universal toleration for 
differences of custom and views of the world, and on the other 
hand rapidly drawing together all peoples who have become 
reading peoples. 
These instrumentalities, the printing-press, railroads, tele- 
graphs, and postal systems, which facilitate travel and per- 
sonal acquaintance, and still more the intercommunication and 
acquaintance by the printed page, are hastening forward that 
stage of public opinion which demands in the name of Christian 
civilization that each individual shall share in the heritage of 
realized wisdom of the entire race.]

EDUCATION OF THE WILL, 
. The principles of the science of Ethics; as, freedom, 
duty, virtue, conscience, to be assumed in an educa- 
tional discussion of will-training. 
. Culture or discipline along three lines of virtue : 
a, Social culture, or obedience to established customs. 
4. Moral culture, or obedience to recognized good. 
¢. Religious culture, or obedience to spiritual laws. 
Social culture to partake duly of the sympathy of the 
family relations, the polite formality of society, and the 
necessary recognition of prevalent selfishness in the 
world at large. 
Moral culture requires self-government upon the basis 
of duty, resulting in the establishment of upright 
character. 
Religious culture upon the basis of conscience includes 
a theoretical conception of the world, a conformity in 
habit to that theory, an acceptance of the teachings of 
a particular church. 
The theoretical process in religion advances by three 
stages : 
a. Religious feeling. 
4. Formation of religious images. 
¢. Insight into religious dogmas. 
The practical process in religion assumes three phases 
analogous to the three stages of the theoretical pro- 
cess:

Pages 183 to 205. 
The general idea of education to be resolved into specific 
ideas called pedagogical principles. 
The fundamental idea of all education: that man is 
educated by man for humanity. 
The historical progress of humanity gives occasion to 
group systems of education under three heads: na- 
- tional, theocratic, and humanitarian. 
National education, in turn, divided under three heads: 
passive, active, individual. 
. The family the organic starting point of all education. 
. In the obedience arising through family relations man 
first learns self-mastery and gentle manners. 
. Caste arising from the provision that each person shall 
enter that field of industry only that descends to him 
through the family relations. 
The conditions of monkish modes of life arising from 
the rejection of both family ties and caste relations. 
Pages 206 to 215. 
THE SYSTEM OF ACTIVE EDUCATION. 
As passive education tends to crush out individuality, 
active education tends to develop the individual’s 
power of conquest. 
2. Education of the Persian type aims at military conquest. 
Persian education in enjoining truthfulness elevated the realities of the world above human authority as enti- 
tled to respect. 
. The religious education of the Persians, as well as the 
civil education, was directed toward conquest of out 
ward forces.
-P-A-G-E-316
ROSENKRANZ’S PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION. 291 
Education of the Egyptian type aims less to conquer 
the adverse circumstances of life than to insure se- 
curity after death. . 
Education of the Pheenician type aims at conquest 
along industrial and mercantile lines. 
(n all three of these types education assumes a utili- 
tarian character and a selfish purpose. 
Pages 216 to 249. 
THE SYSTEM OF INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION, 
(ndividual education has for its aim the development of 
the powers of the being to be educated. 
The education of the individual first took the form of 
training for beauty of form and of physical action. 
Harmony of soul was next cultivated, and then literary 
expression. 
The teaching of virtue under the influence of the great 
Greek philosophers. 
Roman substitution of the idea of usefulness for the 
Greek idea of deauty as the test of value. 
The first type of this practical education found in strict 
simplicity of life and thought. 
Training for law and for war became necessary as the 
means of preserving the integrity of the republic. 
. This practical type of education overpowered by the 
zesthetic type when the two came into contact. 
Pages 250 to 286. 
THE SYSTEM OF HUMANITARIAN EDUCATION. 
Humanitarian education combines the elements of the 
national and the theocratic ideals in a higher ideal 
of spiritual perfection. 
This ideal is attainable only through the principle of 
freedom of the soul. 
Monkish education, by laying extreme stress upon the 
single element of renunciation, led directly away from 
the ideal of soul freedom.

4. The errors ‘of chivalric education grew out of the exclu- 
sive stress laid upon individuality. 
5. Civil education took as its guiding principle utility, or 
adaptation to rational purpose. 
6. The two religious systems that early assumed control of 
civil education erred in suppressing individuality. 
4. The final “free education” must provide for the edu- 
cation of all classes of society, by all available instru- 
mentalities, for all the relations of free citizenship.

  PREFACE 
Tue apology offered in the Preface to the first 
volume of this series for the occurrence of repeti- 
tions, is even more needful here I am afraid. But 
it could hardly be otherwise with speeches and 
essays, on the same topic, addressed at intervals, 
during more than thirty years, to widely distant 
and different hearers and readers. The oldest 
piece, that “On the Educational Value of the 
Natural History Sciences,” contains some crudities, 
which I repudiated when the lecture was first 
reprinted, more than twenty years ago; but it 
will be seen that much of what I have had to say, 
later on in life, is merely a development of the 
propositions enunciated in this early and sadly- 
imperfect piece of work.

compromise about the teaching of dogmatic the-

JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 
[1874] 
Ir the man to perpetuate whose memory we 
have this day raised a statue had been asked on 
what part of his busy life’s work he set the highest 
value, he would undoubtedly have pointed to his 
voluminous contributions to theology. In season 
and out of season, he was the steadfast champion 
of that hypothesis respecting the Divine nature 
which is termed Unitarianism by its friends and 
Socinianism by its foes. Regardless of odds, he 
was ready to do battle with all comers in that 
cause; and if no adversaries entered the lists, he 
would sally forth to seek them. 
To this, his highest ideal of duty, Joseph 
Priestley sacrificed the vulgar prizes of life, which, 
assuredly, were within easy reach of a man of his 
singular energy and varied abilities. For this 
object he put aside, as of secondary importance, 
those scientific investigations which he loved so 
1 
   
-P-A-G-E-10
  2 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
well, and in which he showed himself so com- 
petent to enlarge the boundaries of natural knowl- 
edge and to win fame. In this cause he not only 
cheerfully suffered obloquy from the bigoted and 
the unthinking, and came within sight of martyr- 
dom; but bore with that which is much harder to 
be borne than all these, the unfeigned astonish- 
ment and hardly disguised contempt of a brilliant 
society, composed of men whose sympathy and 
esteem must have been most dear to him, and to 
whom it was simply incomprehensible that a phi- 
losopher should seriously occupy himself with any 
form of Christianity. 
It appears to me that the man who, setting 
before himself such an ideal of life, acted up to it 
consistently, is worthy of the deepest respect, 
whatever opinion may be entertained as to the 
real value of the tenets which he so zealously pro- 
pagated and defended. 
But I am sure that I speak not only for myself, 
but for all this assemblage, when I say that our 
purpose to-day is to do honour, not to Priestley, 
the Unitarian divine, but to Priestley, the fearless 
defender of rational freedom in thought and in 
action: to Priestley, the philosophic thinker; to 
that Priestley who held a foremost place among 
“the swift runners who hand over the lamp of 
life,” * and transmit from one generation to an- 
* “Quasi cursores, vitai lampada tradunt.”—Lucr. De 
Rerwm Nat. ii. 78.

other the fire kindled, in the childhood of the 
world, at the Promethean altar of Science. 
The main incidents of Priestley’s life are so well 
known that I need dwell upon them at no great 
length. 
Born in 1733, at Fieldhead, near Leeds, and 
brought up among Calvinists of the straitest or- 
thodoxy, the boy’s striking natural ability led to 
his being devoted to the profession of a minister 
of religion; and, in 1752, he was sent to the 
Dissenting Academy at Daventry—an institution 
which authority left undisturbed, though its ex- 
istence contravened the law. The teachers under 
whose instruction and influence the young man 
came at Daventry, carried out to the letter the 
injunction to “ try all things: hold fast that which 
is good,” and encouraged the discussion of every 
imaginable proposition with complete freedom, 
the leading professors taking opposite sides; a 
discipline which, admirable as it may be from a 
purely scientific point of view, would seem to be 
calculated to make acute, rather than sound, 
divines. Priestley tells us, in his “ Autobiog- 
raphy,” that he generally found himself on the un- 
orthodox side: and, as he grew older, and his fac- 
ulties attained their maturity, this native tendency 
towards heterodoxy grew with his growth and 
strengthened with his strength. He passed from 
Calvinism to Arianism; and finally, in middle life,
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
landed in that very broad form of Unitarianism 
by which his craving after a credible and consist- 
ent theory of things was satisfied. 
On leaving Daventry Priestley became minister 
- of a congregation, first at Needham Market, and 
secondly at Nantwich; but whether on account of 
his heterodox opinions, or of the stuttering which 
impeded his expression of them in the pulpit, little 
success attended his efforts in this capacity. In 
1761, a career much more suited to his abilities 
became open to him. He was appointed “ tutor 
in the languages” in the Dissenting Academy at 
Warrington, in which capacity, besides giving 
three courses of lectures, he taught Latin, Greek, 
French, and Italian, and read lectures on the the- 
ory of language and universal grammar, on ora- 
tory, philosophical criticism, and civil law. And 
it is interesting to observe that, as a teacher, he 
encouraged and cherished in those whom he in- 
structed freedom which he had enjoyed, in his 
own student days, at Daventry. One of his pupils 
tells us that, 
“ At the conclusion of his lecture, he always encouraged 
his students to express their sentiments relative to the sub- 
ject of it, and to urge any objections to what he had deliv- 
ered, without reserve. It pleased him when any one com- 
menced such a conversation. In order to excite the freest 
discussion, he occasionally invited the students to drink tea 
with him, in order to canvass the subjects of his lectures. 
I do not recollect that he ever showed the least displeasure 
at the strongest objections that were made to what he de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
  I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 5 
livered, but I distinctly remember the smile of approbation 
with which he usually received them: nor did he fail to 
point out, in a very encouraging manner, the ingenuity or 
force of any remarks that were made, when they merited 
these characters. His object, as well as Dr. Aikin’s, was to 
engage the students to examine and decide for themselves, 
uninfluenced by the sentiments of any other persons.” * 
It would be difficult to give a better description 
of a model teacher than that conveyed in these 
words. 
From his earliest days, Priestley had shown a 
strong bent towards the study of nature; and his 
brother Timothy tells us that the boy put spiders 
into bottles, to see how long they would live in the 
same air—a curious anticipation of the investi- 
gations of his later years. At Nantwich, where 
he set up a school, Priestley informs us that he 
bought an air pump, an electrical machine, and 
other instruments, in the use of which he in- 
structed his scholars. But he does not seem to 
have devoted himself seriously to physical science 
until 1766, when he had the great good fortune to 
meet Benjamin Franklin, whose friendship he ever 
afterwards enjoyed. Encouraged by Franklin, he 
wrote a “ History of Electricity,’ which was pub- 
lished in 1767, and appears to have met with con- 
siderable success. 
In the same year, Priestley left Warrington to 
become the minister of a congregation at Leeds;

Rutt. Vol. I. p. 50.

and, here, happening to live next door to a public 
brewery, as he says, : 
“T, at first, amused myself with making experiments on 
the fixed air which I found ready-made in the process of 
fermentation. When I removed from that house I was 
under the necessity of making fixed air for myself; and 
one experiment leading to another, as I have distinctly 
and faithfully noted in my various publications on the sub- 
ject, I by degrees contrived a convenient apparatus for the 
purpose, but of the cheapest kind. 
“When I began these experiments I knew very little of 
chemistry, and had, in a manner, no idea on the subject be- 
fore I attended a course of chemical lectures, delivered in 
the Academy at Warrington, by Dr. Turner of Liverpool. 
But I have often thought that, upon the whole, this cireum- 
stance was no disadvantage to me; as, in this situation, I 
was led to devise an apparatus and processes of my own, 
adapted to my peculiar views; whereas, if I had been pre- 
viously accustomed to the usual chemical processes, I 
should not have so easily thought of any other, and without 
new modes of operation, I should hardly have discovered 
anything materially new.” * 
The first outcome of Priestley’s chemical work, 
published in 1772, was of a very practical charac- 
ter. He discovered the way of impregnating 
water with an excess of “fixed air,” or carbonic 
acid, and thereby producing what we now know 
as “soda water”—a service to naturally, and 
still more to artificially, thirsty souls, which those 
whose parched throats and hot heads are cooled 
by morning draughts of that beverage, cannot 
too gratefully acknowledge. In the same year,

-P-A-G-E-15
    
I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY i 
Priestley communicated the extensive series of 
observations which his industry and ingenuity had 
accumulated, in the course of four years, to the 
Royal Society, under the title of “ Observations 
on Different Kinds of Air”—a memoir which was 
justly regarded of so much merit and importance, 
that the Society at once conferred upon the author 
the highest distinction in their power, by awarding 
him the Copley Medal. 
In 1771 a proposal was made to Priestley to 
accompany Captain Cook in his second voyage to 
the South Seas. He accepted it, and his congre- 
gation agreed to pay an assistant to supply his 
place during his absence. But the appointment 
lay in the hands of the Board of Longitude, of 
which certain clergymen were members; and 
whether these worthy ecclesiastics feared that 
Priestley’s presence among the ship’s company 
might expose His Majesty’s sloop Resolution to 
the fate which aforetime befell a certain ship that 
went from Joppa to Tarshish; or whether they 
were alarmed lest a Socinian should undermine 
that piety which, in the days of Commodore 
Trunnion, so strikingly characterised sailors, does 
not appear; but, at any rate, they objected to 
Priestley “on account of his religious principles,” 
and appointed the two Forsters, whose “ religious 
principles,” if they had been known to these well- 
meaning but not far-sighted persons, would 
probably have surprised them.

8 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY E 
In 1772 another proposal was made to Priest- 
ley. Lord Shelburne, desiring a “literary com- 
panion,” had been brought into communication 
with Priestley by the good offices of a friend of 
both, Dr. Price; and offered him the nominal 
post of librarian, with a good house and appoint- 
ments, and an annuity in case of the termination 
of the engagement. Priestley accepted the offer, 
and remained with Lord Shelburne for seven years, 
sometimes residing at Calne, sometimes travelling 
abroad with the Earl. 
Why the connection terminated has never been 
exactly known; but it is certain that Lord 
Shelburne behaved with the utmost consideration 
and kindness towards Priestley; that he fulfilled 
his engagements to the letter; and that, at a later 
period, he expressed a desire that Priestley should 
return to his old footing in his house. Probably 
enough, the politician, aspiring to the highest 
offices in the State, may have found the posi- 
tion of the protector of a man who was being 
denounced all over the country as an infidel and 
an atheist somewhat embarrassing. In fact, a pas- 
sage in Priestley’s “ Autobiography” on the occa- 
sion of the publication of his “ Disquisitions relat- 
ing to Matter and Spirit,” which took placein 1777, 
indicates pretty clearly the state of the case:— 
“ (126) It being probable that this publication would be 
unpopular, and might be the means of bringing odium on 
my patron, several attempts were made by his friends, 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 9 
though none by himself, to dissuade me from persisting in . 
it. But being, as I thought, engaged in the cause of im- 
portant truth, I proceeded without regard to any conse- 
quences, assuring them that this publication should not be 
injurious to his lordship.” 
It is not unreasonable to suppose that his 
lordship, as a keen, practical man of the world, 
did not derive much satisfaction from this assur- 
ance. The “evident marks of dissatisfaction” 
which Priestley says he first perceived in his 
patron in 1778, may well have arisen from the 
peer’s not unnatural uneasiness as to what his 
domesticated, but not tamed, philosopher might 
write next, and what storm might thereby be 
brought down on his own head; and it speaks 
very highly for Lord Shelburne’s delicacy that, in 
the midst of such perplexities, he made not the 
least attempt to interfere with Priestley’s freedom 
of action. In 1780, however, he intimated to Dr. 
Price that he should be glad to establish Priestley 
on his Irish estates: the sugegstion was interpreted, 
as Lord Shelburne probably intended it should be, 
and Priestley left him, the annuity of £150 a year, 
which had been promised in view of such a con- 
tingency, being punctually paid. 
After leaving Calne, Priestley spent some little 
time in London, and then, having settled in Bir- 
mingham at the desire of his brother-in-law, he 
was soon invited to become the minister of a large 
congregation. This settlement Priestley consid-
-P-A-G-E-18
  
10 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
ered, at the time, to be “the happiest event of 
his life.” And well he might think so; for it 
gave him competence and leisure; placed him 
within reach of the best makers of apparatus of 
the day; made him a member of that remarkable 
“Lunar Society,” at whose meetings he could 
exchange thoughts with such men as Watt, 
Wedgwood, Darwin, and Boulton; and threw 
open to him the pleasant house of the Galtons of 
Barr, where these men, and others of less note, 
formed a society of exceptional charm and intelli- 
gence.* 
But these halcyon days were ended by a bitter 
storm. The French Revolution broke out. An 
electric shock ran through the nations; whatever 
there was of corrupt and retrograde, and, at the 
same time, a great deal of what there was of best 
* See The Life of Mary Anne Schimmelpenninck. Mrs. 
Schimmelpenninck (née Galton) remembered Priestley very 
well, and her description of him is worth quotation :—“ A 
man of admirable simplicity, gentleness and kindness of 
heart, united with great acuteness of intellect. I can never 
forget the impression produced on me by the serene ex- 
pression of his countenance. He, indeed, seemed present 
with God by recollection, and with man by cheerfulness. 
I remember that, in the assembly of these distinguished 
men, amongst whom Mr. Boulton, by his noble manner, his 
fine countenance (which much resembled that of Louis 
XIV.), and princely munificence. stood pre-eminently as 
the great Mecenas; even as a child, I used to feel, when 
Dr. Priestley entered after him, that the glory of the one 
was terrestrial, that of the other celestial; and utterly far 
as I am removed from a belief in the sufficiency of Dr. 
Priestley’s theological creed, I cannot but here record this 
evidence of the eternal power of any portion of the truth 
held in its vitality.”
-P-A-G-E-19
I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY Tk 
and noblest, in European society shuddered at 
the outburst of long-pent-up social fires. Men’s 
feelings were excited in a way that we, in this 
generation, can hardly comprehend. Party wrath 
and virulence were expressed in a manner un- 
paralleled, and it is to be hoped impossible, in our 
times; and Priestley and his friends were held up 
to public scorn, even in Parliament, as fomenters 
of sedition. A “Church-and-King” cry was 
raised against the Liberal Dissenters; and, in 
Birmingham, it was intensified and _ specially 
directed towards Priestley by a local controversy, 
in which he had engaged with his usual vigour. 
In 1791, the celebration of the second anniversary 
of the taking of the Bastile by a public dinner, 
with which Priestley had nothing whatever to do, 
gave the signal to the loyal and pious mob, who, 
unchecked, and indeed to some extent encouraged, 
by those who were responsible for order, had the 
town at their mercy for three days. ‘The chapels 
and houses of the leading Dissenters were 
wrecked, and Priestley and his family had to fly 
for their lives, leaving library, apparatus, papers, 
and all their possessions, a prey to the flames. 
Priestley never returned to Birmingham. He 
bore the outrages and losses inflicted upon him 
with extreme patience and sweetness,* and betook

garding the destroyers of her household gods with some 
asperity, contents herself, in writing to Mrs. Barbauld, with~ 
the sarcasm that the Birmingham people “ will scarcely find

himself to London. But even his scientific col- 
leagues gave him a cold shoulder; and though he 
was elected minister of a congregation at Hackney, 
he felt his position to be insecure, and finally de- 
termined on emigrating to the United States. He 
landed in America in 1794; lived quietly with his 
sons at Northumberland, in Pennsylvania, where 
his posterity still flourish; and, clear-headed and 
busy to the last, died on the 6th of February, 
1804. 
Such were the conditions under which Joseph 
Priestley did the work which lay before him, and 
then, as the Norse Sagas say, went out of the 
story. The work itself was of the most varied 
kind. No human interest was without its attrac- 
tion for Priestley, and few men have ever had so 
many irons in the fire at once; but, though he 
may have burned his fingers a little, very few 
who have tried that operation have burned their 
fingers so little. He made admirable discoveries 
in science; his philosophical treatises are still 
well worth reading; his political works are full of 
insight and replete with the spirit of freedom; and 
while all these sparks flew off from his anvil, the 
controversial hammer rained a hail of blows on 
orthodox priest and bishop. While thus engaged, 
the kindly, cheerful doctor felt no more wrath or 
so many respectable characters, a second time, to make a 
bonfire of.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
1 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 13 
uncharitableness towards his opponents than a 
smith does towards his iron. But if the iron 
could only speak!—and the priests and bishops 
took the point of view of the iron. 
No doubt what Priestley’s friends repeatedly 
urged upon him—that he would have escaped the 
heavier trials of his life and one more for the 
advancement of knowledge, if he had confined 
himself to his scientific pursuits and let his fellow- 
men go their way—was true. But it seems to have 
been Priestley’s feeling that he was a man and 
a citizen before he was a philosopher, and thaf 
the duties of the two former positions are at 
least as imperative as those of the latter. More- 
over, there are men (and I think Priestley was 
one of them) to whom the satisfaction of throwing 
down a triumphant fallacy is as great as that 
which attends the discovery of a new truth; who 
feel better satisfied with the government of the 
world, when they have been helping Providence 
by knocking an imposture on the head; and who 
care even more for freedom of thought than for 
mere advance of knowledge. These men are the 
Carnots who organise victory for truth, and they 
are, at least, as important as the generals who 
visibly fight her battles in the field. 
Priestley’s reputation as a man of science rests 
upon his numerous and important contributions to 
the chemistry of gaseous bodies; and to form a
-P-A-G-E-22
14 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
just estimate of the value of his work—of the 
extent to which it advanced the knowledge of 
fact and the development of sound theoretical 
views—we must reflect what chemistry was in the 
first half of the eighteenth century. 
The vast science which now passes under that 
name had no existence. Air, water, and fire were 
still counted among the elemental bodies; and 
though Van Helmont, a century before, had dis- 
tinguished different kinds of air as gas ventosum 
and gas sylvestre, and Boyle and Hales had ex- 
perimentally defined the physical properties of air, 
and discriminated some of the various kinds of 
aériform bodies, no one suspected the existence 
of the numerous totally distinct gaseous elements 
which are now known, or dreamed that the air 
we breathe and the water we drink are compounds 
of gaseous elements. 
But, in 1754, a young Scotch physician, 
Dr. Black, made the first clearing in this tangled 
backwood of knowledge. And it gives one a 
wonderful impression of the juvenility of scientific 
chemistry to think that Lord Brougham, whom 
so many of us recollect, attended Black’s lectures 
when he was a student in Edinburgh. Black’s 
researches gave the world the novel and startling 
conception of a gas that was a permanently elastic 
fluid like air, but that differed from common air 
in being much heavier, very poisonous, and in 
having the properties of an acid, capable of neutral-
-P-A-G-E-23
  
I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 15 
ising the strongest alkalies; and it took the world 
some time to become accustomed to the notion. 
A dozen years later, one of the most sagacious 
and accurate investigators who has adorned this, 
or any other, country, Henry Cavendish, published 
a memoir in the “Philosophical Transactions,” 
in which he deals not only with the “ fixed air” 
(now called carbonic acid or carbonic anhydride) 
of Black, but with “inflammable air,” or what we 
now term hydrogen. 
By the rigorous application of weight and 
measure to all his processes, Cavendish implied the 
belief subsequently formulated by Lavoisier, that, 
in chemical processes, matter is neither created 
nor destroyed, and indicated the path along which 
all future explorers must travel. Nor did he him- 
self halt until this path led him, in 1784, to the 
brilliant and fundamental discovery that water is 
composed of two gases united in fixed and con- 
stant proportions. 
It is a trying ordeal for any man to be com- 
pared with Black and Cavendish, and Priestley 
cannot be said to stand on their level. Neverthe- 
less his achievements are not only great in them- 
selves, but truly wonderful, if we consider the dis- 
advantages under which he laboured. Without 
the careful scientific training of Black, without the 
leisure and appliances secured by the wealth of 
Cavendish, he scaled the walls of science as so 
many Englishmen have done before and since his
-P-A-G-E-24
16 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
day; and trusting to mother wit to supply the place 
of training, and to ingenuity to create apparatus 
out of washing tubs, he discovered more new gases 
than all his predecessors put together had done. 
He laid the foundations of gas analysis; he dis- 
covered the complementary actions of animal and 
vegetable life upon the constituents of the atmos- 
phere; and, finally, he crowned his work, this day 
one hundred years ago, by the discovery of that 
“pure dephlogisticated air” to which the French 
chemists subsequently gave the name of oxygen. 
Its importance, as the constituent of the atmos- 
phere which disappears in the processes of respira- 
tion and combustion, and is restored by green 
plants growing in sunshine, was proved somewhat 
later. For these brilliant discoveries, the Royal 
Society elected Priestley a fellow and gave him 
their medal, while the Academies of Paris and St. 
Petersburg conferred their membership upon him. 
Edinburgh had made him an honorary doctor of 
laws at an early period of his career; but, I need 
hardly add, that a man of Priestley’s opinions re- 
ceived no recognition from the universities of his 
own country. 
That Priestley’s contributions to the knowledge 
of chemical fact were of the greatest importance, 
and that they richly deserve all the praise that has 
been awarded to them, is unquestionable; but it 
must, at the same time, be admitted that he had 
no comprehension of the deeper significance of his
-P-A-G-E-25
I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 17 
work; and, so far from contributing anything to 
the theory of the facts which he discovered, or 
assisting in their rational explanation, his influence 
to the end of his life was warmly exerted in favour 
of error. From first to last, he was a stiff adherent 
of the phlogiston doctrine which was prevalent 
when his studies commenced; and, by a curious 
irony of fate, the man who by the discovery of 
what he called “dephlogisticated air” furnished 
the essential datum for the true theory of com- 
bustion, of respiration, and of the composition of 
water, to the end of his days fought against the 
inevitable corollaries from his own labours. His 
last scientific work, published in 1800, bears the 
title, “ The Doctrine of Phlogiston established, and 
that of the Composition of Water refuted.” 
When Priestley commenced his studies, the cur- 
rent belief was, that atmospheric air, freed from 
accidental impurities, is a simple elementary sub- 
stance, indestructible and unalterable, as water was 
supposed to be. When a combustible burned, or 
when an animal breathed in air, it was supposed 
that a substance, “ phlogiston,” the matter of heat 
and light, passed from the burning or breathing 
body into it, and destroyed its powers of supporting 
life and combustion. Thus, air contained in a 
vessel in which a lighted candle had gone out, or 
living animal had breathed until it could breathe 
no longer, was called “ phlogisticated.” The same 
result was supposed to be brought about by the
-P-A-G-E-26
18 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
addition of what Priestley called “ nitrous gas” to 
_common air. 
In the course of his researches, Priestley found - 
that the quantity of common air which can thus 
become “ phlogisticated,” amounts to about one- 
fifth the volume of the whole quantity submitted 
to experiment. Hence it appeared that common 
air consists, to the extent of four-fifths of its vol- 
ume, of air which is already “ phlogisticated”; 
while the other fifth is free from phlogiston, or 
“ dephlogisticated.” On the other hand, Priestley 
found that air “ phlogisticated ” by combustion or 
respiration could be “ dephlogisticated,’ or have 
the properties of pure common air restored to it, by 
the action of green plants in sunshine. The ques- 
tion, therefore, would naturally arise—as common 
air can be wholly phlogisticated by combustion, 
and converted into a substance which will no 
longer support combustion, is it possible to get air 
that shall be less phlogisticated than common air, 
and consequently support combustion better than 
common air does? 
Now, Priestley says that, in 1774, the possi- 
bility of obtaining air less phlogisticated than 
common air had not occurred to him.* But in 
pursuing his experiments on the evolution of air 
from various bodies by means of heat, it happened 
that on the 1st of August, 1774, he threw the heat

Air, vol. ii. p. 31.

of the sun, by means of a large burning glass 
which he had recently obtained, upon a substance 
which was then called mercurius calcinatus per se, 
and which is commonly known as red precipitate. 
“T presently found that, by means of this lens, air was 
expelled from it very readily. Having got about three or 
four times as much as the bulk of my materials, I admitted 
water to it, and found that it was not imbibed by it. But 
what surprised me more than I can well express, was that a 
candle burned in this air with a remarkably vigorous flame, 
very much like that enlarged flame with which a candle 
burns in nitrous air, exposed to iron or lime of sulphur; 
but as I had got nothing like this remarkable appearance 
from any kind of air besides this particular modification of 
nitrous air, and I knew no nitrous acid was used in the 
preparation of mercurius calcinatus, I was utterly at a loss 
how to account for it. 
“In this case also, though I did not give sufficient atten- 
tion to the circumstance at that time, the flame of the can- 
dle, besides being larger, burned with more splendour and 
heat than in that species of nitrous air; and a piece of red- 
hot wood sparkled in it, exactly like paper dipped in a solu- 
tion of nitre, and it consumed very fast—an experiment 
which I had never thought of trying with nitrous air.” * 
Priestley obtained the same sort of air from red 
lead, but, as he says himself, he remained in 
ignorance of the properties of this new kind of air 
for seven months, or until March 1775, when he 
found that the new air behaved with “nitrous 
gas” in the same way as the dephlogisticated part 
of common air does; + but that, instead of being 
* Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of 
Air, vol. ii. pp. 34, 35. + Ibid. vol. i. p. 40.

20 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
diminished to four-fifths, it almost completely 
vanished, and, therefore, showed itself to be “ be- 
tween five and six times as good as the best 
common air I have ever met with.” * As this new 
air thus appeared to be completely free from 
phlogiston, Priestley called it “dephlogisticated 
air.” 
What was the nature of this air? Priestley 
found that the same kind of air was to be obtained 
by moistening with the spirit of nitre (which he 
terms nitrous acid) any kind of earth that is free 
from phlogiston, and applying heat; and con- 
sequently he says: “There remained no doubt 
on my mind but that the atmospherical air, or 
the thing that we breathe, consists of the nitrous 
acid and earth, with so much phlogiston as is 
necessary to its elasticity, and likewise so much 
more as is required to bring it from its state of 
perfect purity to the mean condition in which we 
find it.” + 
Priestley’s view, in fact, is that atmospheric air 
is a kind of saltpetre, in which the potash is re- 
placed by some unknown earth. And in speculat- 
ing on the manner in which saltpetre is formed, he 
enunciates the hypothesis, “that nitre is formed 
by a real decomposition of the air itself, the bases 
that are presented to it having, 1n such circum- 
* Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of 
Air, vol. ii, p. 48, ¢ Ibid. p. 55. 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 21 
stances, a nearer affinity with the spirit of nitre 
than that kind of earth with which it is united in 
the atmosphere.” * 
It would have been hard for the most ingenious 
person to have wandered farther from the truth 
than Priestley does in this hypothesis; and, though 
Lavoisier undoubtedly treated Priestley very ill, 
and pretended to have discovered dephlogisticated 
air, or oxygen, as he called it, independently, we 
can almost forgive him when we reflect how 
different were the ideas which the great French 
chemist attached to the body which Priestley dis- 
covered. 
They are like two navigators of whom the first 
sees a new country, but takes clouds for moun- 
tains and mirage for lowlands; while the second 
determines its length and breadth, and lays down 
on a chart its exact place, so that, thenceforth, it 
serves as a guide to his successors, and becomes 
a secure outpost whence new explorations may be 
pushed. 
Nevertheless, as Priestley himself somewhere 
remarks, the first object of physical science is to 
ascertain facts, and the service which he rendered 
to chemistry by the definite establishment of a 
large number of new and fundamentally important 
facts, is such as to entitle him to a very high place 
among the fathers of chemical science.

-P-A-G-E-30
22 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
It is difficult to say whether Priestley’s philo- 
sophical, political, or theological views were 
most responsible for the bitter hatred which 
was borne to him by a large body of his country- 
men,* and which found its expression in the 
malignant insinuations in which Burke, to his 
everlasting shame, indulged in the House of 
Commons. 
Without containing much that will be new to 
the readers of Hobbs, Spinoza, Collins, Hume, and 
Hartley, and, indeed, while making no pretensions 
to originality, Priestley’s “ Disquisitions relating 
to Matter and Spirit,” and his “ Doctrine of Philo- 
sophical Necessity Illustrated,’ are among the 
most powerful, clear, and unflinching expositions 
of materialism and necessarianism which exist in 
the English language, and are still well worth 
reading. 
Priestley denied the freedom of the will in the 
sense of its self-determination; he denied the ex- 
*“Tn all the newspapers and most of the periodical 
publications I was represented as an unbeliever in Revela- 
tion, and no better than an athiest.”— Autobiography, Rutt,

where I usually went, were to be seen, in large characters, 
*‘Mapan For EVER; Damn PriestLEY; No PRESBYTERIAN- 
ism; Damn THE PresByTERIANs,’ etc., etc.; and, at one 
time, I was followed by a number of boys, who left their 
play, repeating what they had seen on the walls, and shout- 
ing out, ‘ Damn Priestley ; damn him, damn him, for ever, 
for ever, etc., etc. This was no doubt a lesson which thev 
had been taught by their parents, and what thev. I fear, had 
learned from their superiors.”—A ppeal to the Public on the 
Subject of the Riots at Birmingham.
-P-A-G-E-31
  I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 93 
istence of a soul distinct from the body; and as 
a natural consequence, he denied the natural im- 
mortality of man. 
In relation to these matters English opinion, a 
century ago, was very much what it is now. 
A man may be a necessarian without incurring 
graver reproach than that implied in being called 
a gloomy fanatic, necessarianism, though very 
shocking, having a note of Calvinistic orthodoxy; 
but, if a man is a materialist; or, if good authori- 
ties say he is and must be so, in spite of his 
assertion to the contrary; or, if he acknowledge 
himself unable to see good reasons for believing in 
the natural immortality of man, respectable folks 
look upon him as an unsafe neighbour of a cash- 
box, as an actual or potential sensualist, the more 
virtuous in outward seeming, the more certainly 
loaded with secret “grave personal sins.” 
Nevertheless, it is as certain as anything can be, 
that Joseph Priestley was no gloomy fanatic, but 
as cheerful and kindly a soul as ever breathed, the 
idol of children; a man who was hated only by 
those who did not know him, and who charmed 
away the bitterest prejudices in personal inter- 
course; a man who never lost a friend, and the 
best testimony to whose worth is the generous and 
tender warmth with which his many friends vied 
with one another in rendering him substantial 
help, in all the crises of his career. 
The unspotted purity of Priestley’s life, the 
62  
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
strictness of his performance of every duty, his 
transparent sincerity, the unostentatious and deep- 
seated piety which breathes through all his corre- 
spondence, are in themselves a sufficient refutation 
of the hypothesis, invented by bigots to cover 
uncharitableness, that such opinions as his must 
arise from moral defects. And his statue will do 
as good service as the brazen image that was set 
upon a pole before the Israelites, if those who 
have been bitten by the fiery serpents of sectarian 
hatred, which still haunt this wilderness of a 
world, are made whole by looking upon the image 
of a heretic who was yet a saint. 
Though Priestley did not believe in the natural 
immortality of man, he held with an almost naive 
realism that man would be raised from the dead 
by a direct exertion of the power of God, and 
thenceforward be immortal. And it may be as 
well for those who may be shocked by this doc- 
trine to know that views, substantially identical 
with Priestley’s, have been advocated, since his 
time, by two prelates of the Anglican Church: by 
Dr. Whately, Archbishop of Dublin, in his well- 
known “ Essays ”; * and by Dr. Courtenay, Bishop 
of Kingston in Jamaica, the first edition of whose 
remarkable book “On the Future States,” dedi- 
cated to Archbishop Whately, was published 
* First Series. On Some of the Peculiarities of the 
Giehen Religion. Essay I.“ Revelation of a Future 
tate.”

in 1843 and the second in 1857. According to 
Bishop Courtenay, 
“The death of the body will cause a cessation of all the 
activity of the mind by way of natural consequence; to 
continue for ever uNLEss the Creator should interfere.” 
And again:— 
“The natural end of human existence is the‘ first death,’ 
the dreamless slumber of the grave, wherein man lies spell- 
bound, soul and body, under the dominion of sin and death 
—that whatever modes of conscious existence, whatever fu- 
ture state of ‘life’ or of ‘torment’ beyond Hades are re- 
served for man, are results of our blessed Lord’s victory 
over sin and death; that the resurrection of the dead must 
be preliminary to their entrance into either of the future 
states, and that the nature and even existence of these 
states, and even the mere fact that there is a futurity of 
consciousness, can be known only through God’s revela- 
tion of Himself in the Person and the Gospel of His Son.” 
—P. 389. 
And now hear Priestley:— 
“Man, according to this system (of materialism), is no 
more than we now see of him. His being commences at 
the time of his conception, or perhaps at an earlier period. 
The corporeal and mental faculties, in being in the same 
substance, grow, ripen, and decay together; and whenever 
the system is dissolved, it continues in a state of dissolu- 
tion till it shall please that Almighty Being who called it 
into existence to restore it to life again.”—“ Matter and 
Spirit,” p. 49. 
And again:— 
“The doctrine of the Scripture is, that God made man 
of the dust of the ground, and by simply animating this
-P-A-G-E-34
  26 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
organized matter, made man that living percipient and in- 
telligent being that he is. According to Revelation, death 
is a state of rest and insensibility, and our only though sure 
hope of a future life is founded on the doctrine of the resur- 
rection of the whole man at some distant period; this as- 
surance being sufficiently confirmed to us both by the evi- 
dent tokens of a Divine commission attending the persons 
who delivered the doctrine, and especially by the actual 
resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is more authentically 
attested than any other fact in history.”—Tdid., p. 247. 
We all know that “a saint in crape is twice a 
saint in lawn;” but it is not yet admitted that the 
views which are consistent with such saintliness in 
lawn, become diabolical when held by a mere dis- 
senter.* 
I am not here either to defend or to attack 
Priestley’s philosophical views, and I cannot say 
that I am personally disposed to attach much 
value to episcopal authority in philosophical ques- 
tions; but it seems right to call attention to the 
fact, that those of Priestley’s opinions which have 
brought most odium upon him have been openly 
* Not only is Priestley at one with Bishop Courtenay in 
this matter, but with Hartley and Bonnet, both of them 
stout champions of Christianity. Moreover, Archbishop 
‘Whately’s essay is little better than an expansion of the 
first paragraph of Hume’s famous essay on the Immortality 
of the Soul :—“ By the mere light of reason it seems diffi- 
cult to prove the immortality of the soul; the arguments 
for it are commonly derived either from metaphysical 
topics, or moral, or physical. But it is in reality the Gos- 
Pel, and the Gospel alone, that has brought life and immor- 
ality to light.” It is impossible to imagine that a man of 
Whately’s tastes and acquirements had not read Hume or 
Hartley, though he refers to neither.
-P-A-G-E-35
  i JOSEPH PRIESTLEY QT 
promulgated, without challenge, by persons occu- 
pying the highest positions in the State Church. 
I must confess that what interests me most 
about Priestley’s materialism, is the evidence that 
he saw dimly the seed of destruction which such 
materialism carries within its own bosom. In the 
course of his reading for his “History of Dis- 
coveries relating to Vision, Light, and Colours,” 
he had come upon the speculations of Boscovich 
and Michell, and had been led to admit the suffi- 
ciently obvious truth that our knowledge of matter 
is a knowledge of its properties; and that of its 
substance—if it have a substance—we know noth- 
ing. And this led to the further admission that, 
so far as we can know, there may be no difference 
between the substance of matter and the substance 
of spirit (“ Disquisitions,” p. 16). A step farther 
would have shown Priestley that his material- 
ism was, essentially, very little different from the 
Idealism of his contemporary,the Bishopof Cloyne. 
As Priestley’s philosophy is mainly a clear state- 
ment of the views of the deeper thinkers of his day, 
so are his political conceptions based upon those of 
Locke. Locke’s aphorism that “the end of gov- 
ernment is the good of mankind,” is thus expanded 
by Priestley:— 
“Tt must necessarily be understood, therefore, whether it 
be expressed or not, that all people live in society for their 
mutual advantage; so that the good and happiness of the  
-P-A-G-E-36
28 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
members, that is, of the majority of the members, of any 
state, is the great standard by which everything relating to 
that state must finally be determined.” * 
The little sentence here interpolated, “ that is, 
of the majority of the members of any state,” ap- 
pears to be that passage which suggested to 
Bentham, according to his own acknowledgment, 
the famous “ greatest happiness” formula, which 
by substituting “ happiness ” for “ good,” has con- 
verted a noble into an ignoble principle. But I do 
not call to mind that there is any utterance in 
Locke quite so outspoken as the following passage 
in the “ Essay on the First Principles of Govern- 
ment.” After laying down as “a fundamental 
maxim in all Governments,” the proposition that 
“ings, senators, and nobles” are “the servants 
of the public,” Priestley goes on to say:— 
“But in the largest states, if the abuses of the govern- 
ment should at any time be great and manifest; if the ser- 
vants of the people, forgetting their masters and their mas- 
ters’ interest, should pursue a separate one of their own; if, 
instead of considering that they are made for the people, 
they should consider the people as made for them; if the 
oppressions and violation of right should be great, flagrant, 
and universally resented ; if the tyrannical governors should 
have no friends but a few sycophants, who had long preyed 
upon the vitals of their fellow-citizens, and who might be 
expected to desert a government whenever their interests 
should be detached from it: if, in consequence of these cir- 
cumstances, it should become manifest that the risk which 
would be run in attempting a revolution would be trifling, 
* Essay on the First Principles of Government. Second 
edition, 1771, p. 13.

and the evils which might be apprehended from it were far 
less than those which were actually suffered and which were 
daily increasing; in the name of God, I ask, what principles 
are those which ought to restrain an injured and insulted 
people from asserting their natural rights, and from chang- 
ing or even punishing their governors—that is, their ser- 
vants—who had abused their trust, or from altering the 
whole form of their government, if it appeared to be of a 
structure so liable to abuse?” 
s a Dissenter, subject to the operation of the 
Corporation and Test Acts, and as a Unitarian 
excluded from the benefit of the Toleration Act, 
it is not surprising to find that Priestley had very 
definite opinions about LHcclesiastical Establish- 
ments; the only wonder is that these opinions 
were so moderate as the following passages show 
them to have been:— 
“Ecclesiastical authority may have been necessary in 
the infant state of society, and, for the same reason, it may 
perhaps continue to be, in some degree, necessary as long as 
society is imperfect; and therefore may not be entirely 
abolished till civil governments have arrived at a much 
greater degree of perfection. If, therefore, I were asked 
whether I should approve of the immediate dissolution of 
all the ecclesiastical establishments in Europe, I should an- 
swer, No. . . . Let experiment be first made of alterations, 
or, which is the same thing, of better establishments than 
the present. Let them be reformed in many essential arti- 
cles, and then not thrown aside entirely till it be found by 
experience that no good can be made of them.” 
Priestley goes on to suggest four such reforms 
of a capital nature:— 
“1, Let the Articles of Faith to be subscribed by candi- 
dates for the ministry be greatly reduced. In the formu-
-P-A-G-E-38
30 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
lary of the Church of England, might not thirty-eight out 
of the thirty-nine be very well spared? It is a reproach to 
any Christian establishment if every man cannot claim the 
benefit of it who can say that he believes in the religion of 
Jesus Christ as it is set forth in the New Testament. You 
say the terms are so general that even Deists would quibble 
and insinuate themselves. I answer that all the articles 
which are subscribed at present by no means exclude Deists 
who will prevaricate; and upon this scheme you would at 
least exclude fewer honest men.” * 
The second reform suggested is the equalisa- 
tion, in proportion to work done, of the stipends 
of the clergy; the third, the exclusion of the 
Bishops from Parliament; and the fourth, com- 
plete toleration, so that every man may enjoy the 
rights of a citizen, and be qualified to serve his 
country, whether he belong to the Established 
Church or not. 
Opinions such as those I have quoted, respect- 
ing the duties and the responsibilities of governors, 
are the commonplaces of modern Liberalism; 
and Priestley’s views on Ecclesiastical Establish- 
ments would, I fear, meet with but a cool re- 
ception, as altogether too conservative, from a 
large proportion of the lineal descendants of the 
people who taught their children to ery “ Damn 
Priestley; ” and with that love for the practical 
application of science which is the source of the 
greatness of Birmingham, tried to set fire to the 
doctor’s house with sparks from his own electrical

machine; thereby giving the man they called an 
incendiary and raiser of sedition against Church 
and King, an appropriately experimental illustra- 
tion of the nature of arson and riot. 
If I have succeeded in putting before you the 
main features of Priestley’s work, its value will 
become apparent when we compare the condition 
of the English nation, as he knew it, with its 
present state. 
The fact that France has been for eighty-five 
years trying, without much success, to right 
herself after the great storm of the Revolution, 
is not unfrequently cited among us as an indi- 
cation of some inherent incapacity for self- 
government among the French people. I think, 
however, that Englishmen who argue thus, forget 
that, from the meeting of the Long Parliament in 
1640, to the last Stuart rebellion in 1745, is a 
hundred and five years, and that, in the middle of 
the last century, we had but just safely freed our- 
selves from our Bourbons and all that they repre- 
sented. The corruption of our state was as bad 
as that of the Second Empire. Bribery was the 
instrument of government, and peculation its re- 
ward. Four-fifths of the seats in the House of 
Commons were more or less openly dealt with 
as property. A minister had to consider the 
state of the vote market, and the sovereign 
secured a sufficiency of “king’s friends” by
-P-A-G-E-40
  82 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY ie 
payments allotted with retail, rather than royal, 
sagacity. 
Barefaced and brutal immorality and intem- 
perance pervaded the land, from the highest to 
the lowest classes of society. The Established 
Church was torpid, as far as it was not a scandal; 
but those who dissented from it came within the 
meshes of the Act of Uniformity, the Test Act, 
and the Corporation Act. By law, such a man as 
Priestley, being a Unitarian, could neither teach 
nor preach, and was liable to ruinous fines and 
long imprisonment.* In those days the guns 
that were pointed by the Church against the Dis- 
senters were shotted. The law was a cesspool of 
iniquity and cruelty. Adam Smith was a new 
prophet whom few regarded, and commerce was 
hampered by idiotic impediments, and ruined 
by still more absurd help, on the part of 
government. 
Birmingham, though already the centre of a 
considerable industry, was a mere village as 
compared with its present extent. People who 
travelled went about armed, by reason of the 
abundance of highwaymen and the paucity and 
inefficiency of the police. Stage coaches had not 
reached Birmingham, and it took three days to get 
to London. Even canals were a recent and much 
opposed invention. 
* In 1782 Doddridge was cited for teaching without the 
Bishop’s leave, at Northampton.

I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 33 
Newton had laid the foundation of a mechani- 
cal conception of the physical universe: Hartley, 
putting a modern face upon ancient materialism, 
had extended that mechanical conception to psy- 
chology; Linnzus and Haller were beginning to 
introduce method and order into the chaotic 
accumulation of biological facts. But those 
parts of physical science which deal with heat, 
electricity. and magnetism, and above all, 
chemistry, in the modern sense, can hardly 
be said to have had an existence. No one 
knew that two of the old elemental bodies, air 
and water, are compounds, and that a third, fire, 
is not a substance but a motion. The great 
industries that have grown out of the applica- 
tions of modern scientific discoveries had no 
existence, and the man who should have foretold 
their coming into being in the days of his son, 
would have been regarded as a mad enthusiast. 
In common with many other excellent persons, 
Priestley believed that man is capable of reaching, 
and will eventually attain, perfection. If the 
temperature of space presented no obstacle, I 
should be glad to entertain the same idea; but 
judging from the past progress of our species, I 
am afraid that the globe will have cooled down 
so far, before the advent of this natural millen- 
nium, that we shall be, at best, perfected Esqui- 
maux. For all practical purposes, however, it is 
enough that man may visibly improve his condi-
-P-A-G-E-42
84 JOSEPH PRIESTLEY I 
tion in the course of a century or so. And, if the 
picture of the state of things in Priestley’s time, 
which I have just drawn, have any pretence to 
accuracy, I think it must be admitted that there 
has been a considerable change for the better. 
I need not advert to the well-worn topic of 
material advancement, in a place in which the 
very stones testify to that progress—in the town 
of Watt and of Boulton. I will only remark, in 
passing, that material advancement has its share 
in moral and intellectual progress. Becky Sharp’s 
acute remark that it is not difficult to be virtuous 
on ten thousand a year, has its application to 
nations; and it is futile to expect a hungry and 
squalid population to be anything but violent and 
gross. But as regards other than material wel- 
fare, although perfection is not yet in sight—even 
from the mast-head—it is surely true that things 
are much better than they were. 
Take the upper and middle classes as a whole, 
and it may be said that open immorality and 
gross intemperance have vanished. Four and six 
bottle men are as extinct as the dodo. Women 
of good repute do not gamble, and talk modelled 
upon Dean Swift’s “ Art of Polite Conversation ” 
would be tolerated in no decent kitchen. 
Members of the legislature are not to be 
bought; and constituents are awakening to the 
fact that votes must not be sold—even for such 
trifles as rabbits and tea and cake. Political
-P-A-G-E-43
  I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 35 
power has passed into the hands of the masses of 
the people. Those whom Priestley calls their 
servants have recognized their position, and have 
requested the master to be so good as to go to 
school and fit himself for the administration of his 
property. In ordinary life, no civil disability 
attaches to any one on theological grounds, and 
high offices of the state are open to Papist, Jew, 
and Secularist. 
Whatever men’s opinions as to the policy of 
Establishment, no one can hesitate to admit that 
the clergy of the Church are men of pure life 
and conversation, zealous in the discharge of their 
duties; and at present, apparently, more bent on 
prosecuting one another than on meddling with 
Dissenters. Theology itself has broadened so 
much, that Anglican divines put forward doctrines 
more liberal than those of Priestley; and, in our 
state-supported churches, one listener may hear a 
sermon to which Bossuet might have given his 
approbation, while another may hear a discourse 
in which Socrates would find nothing new. 
But great as these changes may be, they sink 
into insignificance beside the progress of physical 
science, whether we consider the improvement of 
methods of investigation, or the increase in bulk 
of solid knowledge. Consider that the labours of 
Laplace, of Young, of Davy, and of Faraday; of 
Cuvier, of Lamarck, and of Robert Brown; of 
Von Baer, and of Schwann; of Smith and of 
 
-P-A-G-E-44

Hutton, have all been carried on since Priestley 
discovered oxygen; and consider that they are 
now things of the past, concealed by the industry 
of those who have built upon them, as the first 
founders of a coral reef are hidden beneath the 
life’s work of their successors; consider that the 
methods of physical science are slowly spreading 
into all investigations, and that proofs as valid as 
those required by her canons of investigation are 
being demanded of all doctrines which ask for 
men’s assent; and you will have a faint image of 
the astounding difference in this respect between 
the nineteenth century and the eighteenth. 
If we ask what is the deeper meaning of all 
these vast changes, I think there can be but one 
reply. They mean that reason has asserted and 
exercised her primacy over all provinces of human 
activity; that ecclesiastical authority has been 
relegated to its proper place; that the good of the 
governed has been finally recognized as the end of 
government, and the complete responsibility of 
governors to the people as its means; and that 
the dependence of natural phenomena in general 
on the laws of action of what we call matter has 
become an axiom. 
But it was to bring these things about, and to 
enforce the recognition of these truths, that 
Joseph Priestley laboured. If the nineteenth 
century is other and better than the eighteenth, 
it is, in great measure, to him, and to such men as
-P-A-G-E-45
  
I JOSEPH PRIESTLEY 387 
he, that we owe the change. If the twentieth 
century is to be better than the nineteenth, it will 
be because there are among us men who walk in 
Priestley’s footsteps. 
Such men are not those whom their own gen- 
eration delights to honour; such men, in fact, 
rarely trouble themselves about honour, but ask, 
in another spirit than Falstaff’s, “ What is honour? 
Who hath it? He that died o’ Wednesday.” But 
whether Priestley’s lot be theirs, and a future 
generation, in justice and in gratitude, set up 
their statues; or whether their names and fame 
are blotted out from remembrance, their work will 
live as long as time endures. To all eternity, the 
sum of truth and right will have been increased 
by their means; to all eternity, falsehood and 
injustice will be the weaker because they have 
lived.

ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF THE 
NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 
[1854] 
Tue subject to which I have to beg your atten- 
tion during the ensuing hour is “ The Relation of 
Physiological Science to other branches of Knowl- 
edge.” 
Had circumstances permitted of the delivery, 
in their strict logical order, of that series of dis- 
courses of which the present lecture is a member, 
I should have preceded my friend and colleague 
Mr. Henfrey, who addressed you on Monday last; 
but while, for the sake of that order, I must beg 
you to suppose that this discussion of the Educa- 
tional bearings of Biology in general does precede 
that of Special Zoology and Botany, I am rejoiced 
to be able to take advantage of the light thus 
already thrown upon the tendency and methods of 
Physiological Science. 
Regarding Physiological Science, then, in its 
38
-P-A-G-E-47
  
u VALUE OF NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES. 39 
widest sense—as the equivalent of Biology—the 
Science of Individual Life—we have to consider 
in succession: 
1. Its position and scope as a branch of knowl- 
edge. 
2. Its value as a means of mental discipline. 
3. Its worth as practical information. 
And lastly, 
4. At what period it may best be made a 
branch of Education. 
Our conclusions on the first of these heads 
must depend, of course, upon the nature of the 
subject-matter of Biology; and I think a few pre- 
liminary. considerations will place before you in 
a clear light the vast difference which exists 
between the living bodies with which Physio- 
logical science is concerned, and the remainder 
of the universe;—between the phenomena of 
Number and Space, of Physical and of Chemical 
force, on the one hand, and those of Life on the 
other. 
The mathematician, the physicist, and the 
chemist contemplate things in a condition of rest; 
they look upon a state of equilibrium as that to 
which all bodies normally tend. 
The mathematician does not suppose that a 
quantity will alter, or that a given point in space 
will change its direction with regard to another 
point, spontaneously. And it is the same with 
the physicist. When Newton saw the apple fall, 
63 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE It 
he concluded at once that the act of falling was 
not the result of any power inherent in the apple, 
but that it was the result of the action of some- 
thing else on the apple. In a similar manner, all 
physical force is regarded as the disturbance of an 
equilibrium to which things tended before its 
exertion,—to which they will tend again after its 
cessation. 
The chemist equally regards chemical change 
in a body as the effect of the action of something 
external to the body changed. A chemical com- 
pound once formed would persist for ever, if no 
alteration took place in surrounding conditions. 
But to the student of Life the aspect of Nature 
is reversed. Here, incessant, and, so far as we 
know, spontaneous change is the rule, rest the 
exception—the anomaly to be accounted for. 
Living things have no inertia, and tend to no 
equilibrium. 
Permit me, however, to give more force and 
clearness to these somewhat abstract considerations 
by an illustration or two. 
Imagine a vessel full of water, at the ordinary 
temperature, in an atmosphere saturated with 
vapour. The quantity and the figure of that 
water will not change, so far as we know, for 
ever. 
Suppose a lump of gold be thrown into the ves- 
sel—motion and disturbance of figure exactly pro- 
portional to the momentum of the gold will take
-P-A-G-E-49
I OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 41 
place. But after a time the effects of this disturb- 
ance will subside—equilibrium will be restored, 
and the water will return to its passive state. 
Expose the water to cold—it will solidify—and 
in so doing its particles will arrange themselves 
in definite crystalline shapes. But once formed, 
these crystals change no further. 
Again, substitute for the lump of gold some 
substance capable of entering into chemical rela- 
tions with the water:—say, a mass of that sub- 
stance which is called “ protein ”—the substance 
of flesh:—a very considerable disturbance of equi- 
librium will take place—all sorts of chemical com- 
positions and decompositions will occur; but in 
the end, as before, the result will be the resump- 
tion of a condition of rest. 
Instead of such a mass of dead protein, how- 
ever, take a particle of living protein—one of those 
minute microscopic living things which throng 
our pools, and are known as Infusoria—such a 
creature, for instance, as an Euglena, and place it 
in our vessel of water. It is a round mass pro- 
vided with a long filament, and except in this pe- 
culiarity of shape, presents no appreciable physical 
or chemical difference whereby it might be distin- 
guished from the particle of dead protein. 
But the difference in the phenomena to which 
it will give rise is immense: in the first place it 
will develop a vast quantity of physical foree— 
cleaving the water in all directions with consider- 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    
42, ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE IL 
able rapidity by means of the vibrations of the 
long filament of cilium. 
Nor is the amount of chemical energy which 
the little creature possesses less striking. It is a 
perfect laboratory in itself, and it will act and re- 
act upon the water and the matters contained 
therein; converting them into new compounds re- 
sembling its own substance, and at the same time 
giving up portions of its own substance which have 
become effete. 
Furthermore, the Euglena will increase in size; 
but this increase is by no means unlimited, as the 
increase of a crystal might be. After it has grown 
to a certain extent it divides, and each portion 
assumes the form of the original, and proceeds to 
repeat the process of growth and division. 
Nor is this all. For after a series of such divi- 
sions and subdivisions, these minute points assume 
a totally new form, lose their long tails—round 
themselves, and secrete a sort of envelope or box, 
in which they remain shut up for a time, eventu- 
ally to resume, directly or indirectly, their primi- 
tive mode of existence. 
Now, so far as we know, there is no natural 
limit to the existence of the Euglena, or of any 
other living germ. A living species once launched 
into existence tends to live for ever. 
Consider how widely different this living par- 
ticle is from the dead atoms with which the physi- 
cist and chemist have to do!
-P-A-G-E-51
IL OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 43 
The particle of gold falls to the bottom and 
rests—the particle of dead protein decomposes and 
disappears—it also rests: but the living protein 
mass neither tends to exhaustion of its forces nor 
to any permanency of form, but is essentially dis- 
tinguished as a disturber of equilibrium so far as 
force is concerned,—as undergoing continual meta- 
morphosis and change, in point of form. 
Tendency to equilibrium of force and to per- 
manency of form, then, are the characters of that 
portion of the universe which does not live—the 
domain of the chemist and physicist. 
Tendency to disturb existing equilibrium—td 
take on forms which succeed one another in defi- 
nite cycles—is the character of the living world. 
What is the cause of this wonderful difference 
between the dead particle and the living particle 
of matter appearing in other respects identical? 
that difference to which we give the name of 
Life? 
I, for one, cannot tell you. It may be that, by 
and by, philosophers will discover some higher 
laws of which the facts of life are particular cases 
—very possibly they will find out some bond be- 
tween physico-chemical phenomena on the one 
hand, and vital phenomena on the other. At 
present, however, we assuredly know of none; 
and I think we shall exercise a wise humility in 
confessing that, for us at least, this successive 
assumption of different states—(external condi-
-P-A-G-E-52
44 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE 11 
tions remaining the same)—this spontaneity of ac- 
tion—if I may use the term which implies more 
than I would be answerable for—which constitutes 
so vast and plain a practical distinction between 
living bodies and those which do not live, is an ul- 
timate fact; indicating as such, the existence of a 
broad line of demarcation between the subject- 
matter of Biological and that of all other 
sciences. 
For I would have it understood that this sim- 
ple Euglena is the type of ail living things, so far 
as the distinction between these and inert matter 
is concerned. That cycle of changes, which is 
constituted by perhaps not more than two or three 
steps in the Euglena, is as clearly manifested in 
the multitudinous stages through which the germ 
of an oak or of a man passes. Whatever forms 
the Living Being may take on, whether simple or 
complex, production, growth, reproduction, are the 
phenomena which distinguish it from that which 
does not live. 
If this be true, it is clear that the student, in 
passing from the physico-chemical to the physio- 
logical sciences, enters upon a totally, new order of 
facts; and it will next be for us to consider how 
far these new facts involve new methods, or require 
a modification of those with which he is already 
acquainted. Now a great deal is said about the 
peculiarity of the scientific method in general, and 
of the different methods which are pursued in the
-P-A-G-E-53
  
u OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 45 
different sciences. The Mathematics are said to 
have one special method; Physics another, Biology 
a third, and so forth. For my own part, I must 
confess that I do not understand this phraseology. 
So far as I can arrive at any clear comprehen- : 
sion of the matter, Science is not, as many would 
seem to suppose, a modification of the black art, 
suited to the tastes of the nineteenth century, and 
flourishing mainly in consequence of the decay of 
the Inquisition. 
Science is, I believe, nothing but trained and 
organised common sense, differing from the latter 
only as a veteran may differ from a raw recruit: 
and its methods differ from those of common sense 
only so far as the guardsman’s cut and thrust 
differ from the manner in which a savage wields 
his club. The primary power is the same in each 
case, and perhaps the untutored savage has the 
more brawny arm of the two. The real advantage 
lies in the point and polish of the swordsman’s 
weapon; in the trained eye quick to spy out the 
weakness of the adversary; in the ready hand 
prompt to follow it on the instant. But, after all, 
the sword exercise is only the hewing and poking 
of the clubman developed and perfected. 
So, the vast results obtained by Science are 
won by no mystical faculties, by no mental pro- 
cesses, other than those which are practised by 
every one of us, in the humblest and meanest 
affairs of life. A detective policeman discovers a
-P-A-G-E-54
46 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE 1 
burglar from the marks made by his shoe, by a 
mental process identical with that by which Cuvier 
restored the extinct animals of Montmartre from 
fragments of their bones. Nor does that process 
of induction and deduction by which a lady, find- 
ing a stain of a peculiar kind upon her dress, con- 
cludes that somebody has upset the inkstand there- 
on, differ in any way, in kind, from that by which 
Adams and Leyverrier discovered a new planet. 
The man of science, in fact, simply uses with 
scrupulous exactness the methods which we all, 
habitually and at every moment, use carelessly; 
and the man of business must as much avail him- 
self of the scientific method—must be as truly a 
man of science—as the veriest bookworm of us 
all; though I have no doubt that the man of busi- 
ness will find himself out to be a philosopher with 
as much surprise as M. Jourdain exhibited when 
he discovered that he had been all his life talking 
prose. If, however, there be no real difference be- 
tween the methods of science and those of common 
life, it would seem, on the face of the matter, 
highly improbable that there should be any 
difference between the methods of the different 
sciences; nevertheless, it is constantly taken for 
granted that there is a very wide difference be- 
tween the Physiological and other sciences in 
point of method. 
In the first place it is said—and I take this 
point first, because the imputation is too frequent-
-P-A-G-E-55
m OF THR NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 47 
ly admitted by Physiologists themselves—that Bi- 
ology differs from the Physico-chemical and Math- 
ematical sciences in being “ inexact.” 
Now, this phrase “inexact ” must refer either 
to the methods or to the results of Physiological 
science. 
It cannot be correct to apply it to the methods; 
for, as I hope to show you by and by, these are 
identical in all sciences, and whatever is true of 
Physiological method is true of Physical and 
Mathematical method. 
Is it then the results of Biological science which 
are “inexact”? Ithink not. If I say that respi- 
ration is performed by the lungs; that digestion is 
effected in the stomach; that the eye is the organ 
of sight; that the jaws of a vertebrated animal 
never open sideways, but always up and down; 
while those of an annulose animal always open 
sideways, and never up and down—I am enumer- 
ating propositions which are as exact as anything 
in Euclid. How then has this notion of the in- 
exactness of Biological science come about? I 
believe from two causes: first, because in conse- 
quence of the great complexity of the science and 
the multitude of interfering conditions, we are 
very often only enabled to predict approximately 
what will occur under given circumstances; and 
secondly, because, on account of the comparative 
youth of the Physiological sciences, a great many 
of their laws are still imperfectly worked out.
-P-A-G-E-56
  
48 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE IL 
But, in an educational point of view, it is most 
important to distinguish between the essence of a 
science and the accidents which surround it; and 
essentially, the methods and results of Physiology 
are as exact as those of Physics or Mathematics. 
It is said that the Physiological method is es- 
pecially comparative * ; and this dictum also finds 
favour in the eyes of many. I should be sorry to 
suggest that the speculators on scientific classifica- 
tion have been misled by the accident of the name 
of one leading branch of Biology—Comparative 
Anatomy; but I would ask whether comparison, 
and that classification which is the result of com- 
parison, are not the essence of every science 
whatsoever? How is it possible to discover a re- 
lation of cause and effect of any kind without com- 
paring a series of cases together in which the sup- 
posed cause and effect occur singly, or combined? 
* “Tn the third place, we have to review the method of 
Comparison, which is so specially adapted to the study of 
living bodies, and by which, above all others, that study 
must be advanced. In Astronomy, this method is neces- 
sarily inapplicable; and it is not till we arrive at Chemistry 
that this third means of investigation can be used; and 
then only in subordination to the two others. It is in the 
study, both statical and dynamical, of living bodies that it 
first acquires its full development; and its use elsewhere 
can be only through its application here.’—Comrr’s Posi- 
tive Philosophy, translated by Miss Martineau. Vol. i. p. 
372. 
By what method does M. Comte suppose that the equal- 
ity or inequality of forces and quantities and the dissimi- 
larity or similarity of forms—points of some slight impor- 
tance not only in Astronomy and Physics, but even in 
Mathematics—are ascertained, if not by Comparison?
-P-A-G-E-57
  
u OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 49 
So far from comparison being in any way peculiar 
to Biological science, it is, I think, the essence of 
every science. 
A speculative philosopher again tells us that 
the Biological sciences are distinguished by being 
sciences of observation and not of experiment! * 
Of all the strange assertions into which specu- 
lation without practical acquaintance with a sub- 
ject may lead even an able man, I think this is 
the very strangest. Physiology not an experimen- 
tal science? Why, there is not a function of a 
single organ in the body which has not been de- 
termined wholly and solely by experiment? How 
did Harvey determine the nature of the circula- 
tion, except by experiment? How did Sir Charles 
Bell determine the functions of the roots of the 
spinal nerve, save by experiment? How do we 
know the use of a nerve at all, except by experi- 
ment? Nay, how do we know even that your 
eye is your seeing apparatus, unless you make the 
experiment of shutting it or that your ear is your 
* “Proceeding to the second class of means,—Experi- 
ment cannot but be less and less decisive, in proportion to 
the complexity of the phenomena to be explored; and 
therefore we saw this resource to be less effectual in chem- 
istry than in physics: and we now find that it is eminently 
useful in chemistry in comparison with physiology. In 
Fact, the nature of the phenomena seems to offer almost in- 
surmountable impediments to any extensive and prolific ap- 
Elsa of such a procedure in biology.”—ComtE, vol. i. 
p. 867. 
M. Comte, as his manner is, contradicts himself two * 
pages further on, but that will hardly relieve him from the 
responsibility of such a paragraph as the above.

hearing apparatus, unless you close it up and 
thereby discover that you become deaf? | 
It would really be much more true to-say that 
Physiology is the experimental science par excel- 
lence of all sciences; that in which there is least 
to be learnt by mere observation, and that which 
affords the greatest field for the exercise of those 
faculties which characterise the experimental phi- 
losopher. I confess, if any one were to ask me 
for a model application of the logic of experiment, 
I should know no better work to put into his 
hands than Bernard’s late Researches on the 
Functions of the Liver.* 
Not to give this lectureea too controversial 
tone, however, I must only advert to one more 
doctrine, held by a thinker of our own age and 
country, whose opinions are worthy of all respect. 
It is, that the Biological sciences differ from all 
others, inasmuch as in them classification takes 
place by type and not by definition.t+ 
It is said, in short, that a natural-history class 
is not capable of being defined—that the class 
* Nouvelle Fonction du Foie considéré comme organe 
producteur de matiére sucrée chez V Homme et les Animauz, 
par M. Claude Bernard. 
+“ Natural Groups given by Type, not by Definiiton. 
. The class is steadily fixed, though not precisely 
limitea ; it is given, though not circumscribed ; it is deter- 
mined, not by a boundary-line without, but by a central 
point within ; not by what it strictly excludes, “but what it 
eminently includes ; by an example, not by a precept; in 
short, instead of Definition we have a Type for our director. 
A type is an example of any class, for instance, a species of 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  u OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 51 
Rosacex, for instance, or the class of Fishes, is not 
accurately and absolutely definable, inasmuch as 
its members will present exceptions to every pos- 
sible definition and that the members of the 
class are united together only by the circumstance 
that they are all more like some imaginary aver- 
age rose or average fish, than they resemble any- 
thing else. 
But here, as before, I think the distinction has 
arisen entirely from confusing a transitory imper- 
fection with an essential character. So long as 
our information concerning them is imperfect, we 
class all objects together according to resemblances 
which we feel, but cannot define; we group them 
round types, in short. Thus if you ask an ordi- 
nary person what kinds of animals there are, he 
will probably say, beasts, birds, reptiles, fishes, in- 
sects, &c. Ask him to define a beast from a rep- 
tile, and he cannot do it; but he says, things like 
a cow or a horse are beasts, and things like a frog 
or a lizard are reptiles. You see he does class by 
type, and not by definition. But how does this 
classification differ from that of a scientific Zoolo- 
gist? How does the meaning of the scientific class- 
name of “ Mammalia” differ from the unscientific 
of “ Beasts ”? 
a genus, which is considered as eminently possessing the 
characters of the class. All the species which have a greater 
affinity with this type-species than with any others, form 
the genus, and are ranged about it, deviating from it in va- 
rious directions and different degrees.”—WuEWELL, The 
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, vol. i. pp. 476, 477. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
52 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE IL 
Why, exactly because the former depends on 
a definition, the latter on a type. The class 
Mammalia is scientifically defined as “all animals 
which have a vertebrated skeleton and suckle their 
young.” Here is no reference to type, but a defi- 
nition rigorous enough for a geometrician. And 
such is the character which every scientific natu- 
ralist recognises as that to which his classes must 
aspire—knowing, as he does, that classification by 
type is simply an acknowledgment of ignorance 
and a temporary device. 
So much in the way of negative argument as 
against the reputed differences between Biological 
and other methods. No such differences, I believe, 
rally exist. The subject-matter of Biological sci- 
ence is different from that of other sciences, but 
the methods of all are identical; and these 
methods are— 
1. Observation of facts—including under this 
head that artificial observation which is called ea- 
periment. 
2. That process of tying up similar facts into 
bundles ticketed and ready for use, which is called 
Comparison and Classification,—the results of the 
process, the tcketed bundles, being named General 
propositions. 
3. Deduction, which takes us from the general 
proposition to facts again—teaches us, if I may so 
say, to anticipate from the ticket what is inside 
the bundle. And finally—
-P-A-G-E-61
  
u OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 53 
4. Verification, which is the process of ascer- 
taining whether, in point of fact, our anticipation 
is a correct one. 
Such are the methods of all science whatso- 
ever; but perhaps you will permit me to give you 
an illustration of their employment in the science 
of Life; and I will take as a special case the 
establishment of the doctrine of the Circulation of 
the Blood. 
In this case, simple observation yields us a 
knowledge of the existence of the blood from some 
accidental hemorrhage, we will say; we may even 
grant that it informs us of the localisation of this 
blood in particular vessels, the heart, &c., from 
some accidental cut or the like. It teaches also 
the existence of a pulse in various parts of the 
body, and acquaints us with the structure of the 
heart and vessels. 
Here, however, simple observation stops, and we 
must have recourse to experiment. 
You tie a vein, and you find that the blood 
accumulates on the side of the ligature opposite 
the heart. You tie an artery, and you find that 
the blood accumulates on the side near the heart. 
Open the chest, and you see the heart contracting 
with great force. Make openings into its prin- 
cipal cavities, and you will find that all the blood 
flows out, and no more pressure is exerted on either 
side of the arterial or venous ligature. 
Now all these facts, taken together, constitute 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE II 
the evidence that the blood is propelled by the 
heart through the arteries, and returns by the 
veins—that, in short, the blood circulates. 
Suppose our experiments and observations have 
been made on horses, then we group and ticket 
them into a general proposition, thus:—all horses 
have a circulation of their blood. 
Henceforward a horse is a sort of indication or 
label, telling us where we shall find a peculiar 
series of phenomena called the circulation of the 
blood. 
Here is our general proposition, then. 
How, and when, are we justified in making our 
next step—a deduction from it? 
Suppose our physiologist, whose experience is 
limited to horses, meets with a zebra for the first 
time,—will he suppose that this generalisation 
holds good for zebras also? 
That depends very much on his turn of mind. 
But we will suppose him to be a bold man. He 
will say, “The zebra is certainly not a horse, but 
it is very like one,—so like, that it must be the 
‘ticket? or mark of a blood-circulation also; and 
I conclude that the zebra has a circulation.” 
That is a deduction, a very fair deduction, but 
by no means to be considered scientifically secure. 
This last quality in fact can only be given by 
verification—that is, by making a zebra the subject 
of all the experiments performed on the horse. Of 
course, in the present case, the deduction would be
-P-A-G-E-63
  m OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 55 
confirmed by this process of verification, and the 
result would be, not merely a positive widening of 
knowledge, but a fair increase of confidence in the 
truth of one’s generalisations in other cases. 
Thus, having settled the point in the zebra and 
horse, our philosopher would have great confidence 
in the existence of a circulation in the ass. Nay, 
I fancy most persons would excuse him, if in this 
case he did not take the trouble to go through the 
process of verification at all; and it would not be 
without a parallel in the history of the human 
mind, if our imaginary physiologist now main- 
tained that he was acquainted with asinine circula- 
tion a priori. 
However, if I might impress any caution upon 
your minds, it is, the utterly conditional nature of 
all our knowledge,—the danger of neglecting the 
process of verification under any circumstances; 
and the film upon which we rest, the moment our 
deductions carry us beyond the reach of this great 
process of verification. There is no better instance 
of this than is afforded by the history of our 
knowledge of the circulation of the blood in the 
animal kingdom until the year 1824. In every 
animal possessing a circulation at all, which had 
been observed up to that time, the current of the 
blood was known to take one definite and invari- 
able direction. Now, there is a class of animals 
called Ascidians, which possess a heart and a cir- 
culation, and up to the period of which I speak,

no one would have dreamt of questioning the 
propriety of the deduction, that these creatures 
have a circulation in one direction; nor would any 
one have thought it worth while to verify the 
point. But, in that year, M. von Hasselt, happen- 
ing to examine a transparent animal of this class, 
found, to his infinite surprise, that after the heart 
had beat a certain number of times, it stopped, 
and then began beating the opposite way—so as 
to reverse the course of the current, which returned 
by and by to its original direction. 
I have myself timed the heart of these little 
animals. I found it as regular as possible in its 
periods of reversal: and I know no spectacle in 
the animal kingdom more wonderful than that 
which it presents—all the more wonderful that to 
this day it remains an unique fact, peculiar to this 
class among the whole animated world. At the 
same time I know of no more striking case of the 
necessity of the verification of even those deduc- 
tions which seem founded on the widest and 
safest inductions. 
Such are the methods of Biology—methods 
which are obviously identical with those of all 
other sciences, and therefore wholly incompetent 
to form the ground of any distinction between it 
and them.* 
* Save for the pleasure of doing so, I need hardly point 
out my obligations to Mr, J. 8, Mill’s System of Logie, in 
this view of scientific method.

But I shall be asked at once, Do you mean to 
say that there is no difference between the habit 
of mind of a mathematician and that of a natural- 
ist? Do you imagine that Laplace might have 
been put into the Jardin des Plantes, and Cuvier 
into the Observatory, with equal advantage to the 
progress of the sciences they professed? 
To which I would reply, that nothing could be 
further from my thoughts. But different habits 
and various special tendencies of two sciences do 
not imply different methods. The mountaineer 
and the man of the plains have very different 
habits of progression, and each would be at a loss 
in the other’s place; but the method of progression, 
by putting one leg before the other, is the same in 
each case. Hvyery step of each is a combination of 
a lift and a push; but the mountaineer lifts more 
and the lowlander pushes more. And I think the 
case of two sciences resembles this. 
I do not question for a moment, that while the 
Mathematician is busy with deductions from 
general propositions, the Biologist is more espe- 
cially occupied with observation, comparison, and 
those processes which lead ¢o general propositions. 
All I wish to insist upon is, that this difference 
depends not on any fundamental distinction in 
the sciences themselves, but on the accidents of 
their subject-matter, of their relative complexity, 
and consequent relative perfection. 
The Mathematician deals with two properties of  
-P-A-G-E-66
  58 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE I 
objects only, number and extension, and all the 
inductions he wants have been formed and finished 
ages ago. He is occupied now with nothing but 
deduction and verification. 
The Biologist deals with a vast number of 
properties of objects, and his inductions will not be 
completed, I fear, for ages to come; but when they 
are, his science will be as deductive and as exact 
as the Mathematics themselves. 
Such is the relation of Biology to those sciences 
which deal with objects having fewer properties 
than itself. But as the student, in reaching 
Biology, looks back upon sciences of a less complex 
and therefore more perfect nature; so, on the other 
hand, does he look forward to other more complex 
and less perfect branches of knowledge. Biology 
deals only with living beings as isolated things— 
treats only of the life of the individual: but there 
is a higher division of science still, which considers 
living beings as aggregates—which deals with the 
relation of living beings one to another—the sci- 
ence which observes men—whose experiments are 
made by nations one upon another, in battle-fields 
—whose general propositions are embodied in his- 
tory, morality, and religion—whose deductions 
lead to our happiness or our misery—and whose 
verifications so often come too late, and serve only 
“To point a moral, or adorn a tale ”— 
I mean the science of Society or Sociology.
-P-A-G-E-67
  us OF THE NATURAI, HISTORY SCIENCES 59 
I think it is one of the grandest features of 
Biology, that it occupies this central position in 
human knowledge. There is no side of the human 
mind which physiological study leaves unculti- 
vated. Connected by innumerable ties with ab- 
stract science, Physiology is yet in the most inti- 
mate relation with humanity; and by teaching us 
that law and order, and a definite scheme of devel- 
opment, regulate even the strangest and wildest 
manifestations of individual life, she prepares the 
student to look for a goal even amidst the erratic 
wanderings of mankind, and to believe that history 
offers something more than an entertaining chaos 
—a journal of a toilsome, tragi-comic march no- 
whither. 
The preceding considerations have, I hope, 
served to indicate the replies which befit the first 
two of the questions which I set before you at 
starting, viz. What is the range and position of 
Physiological Science as a branch of knowledge, 
and what is its value as a means of mental dis- 
cipline? 
Its subject-matter is a large moiety of the uni- 
verse—its position is midway between the physico- 
chemical and the social sciences. Its value as a 
branch of discipline is partly that which it has in 
common with all sciences—the training and 
strengthening of common sense; partly that 
which is more peculiar to itselfi—the great exercise 
which it affords to the faculties of observation and  
-P-A-G-E-68
60 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE II 
comparison; and, I may add, the exactness of 
knowledge which it requires on the part of those 
among its votaries who desire to extend its bound- 
aries. 
Ii what has been said as to the position and 
scope of Biology be correct, our third question— 
What is the practical value of physiological in- 
struction?—might, one would think, be left to 
answer itself. 
On other grounds even, were mankind deserv- 
ing of the title “rational,” which they arrogate to 
themselves, there can be no question that they 
would consider, as the most necessary of all 
branches of instruction for themselves and for 
their children, that which professes to acquaint 
them with the conditions of the existence they 
prize so highly—which teaches them how to avoid 
disease and to cherish health, in themselves and 
those who are dear to them. 
I am addressing, I imagine, an audience of 
educated persons; and yet I dare venture to assert 
that, with the exception of those of my hearers 
who may chance to have received a medical edu- 
cation, there is not one who could tell me what is 
the meaning and use of an act which he performs 
a score of times every minute, and whose suspen- 
sion would involve his immediate death;—I mean 
the act of breathing—or who could state in precise 
terms why it is that a confined atmosphere is 
injurious to health.
-P-A-G-E-69
  u OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 61 
The practical value of Physiological knowledge! 
Why is it that educated men can be found to main- 
tain that a slaughter-house in the midst of a great 
city is rather a good thing than otherwise?—that 
mothers persist in exposing the largest possible ; 
amount of surface of their children to the cold, by 
the absurd style of dress they adopt, and then 
marvel at the peculiar dispensation of Providence, 
which removes their infants by bronchitis and 
gastric fever? Why is it that quackery rides ram- 
pant over the land; and that not long ago, one 
of the largest public rooms in this great city could 
be filled by an audience gravely listening to the 
reverend expositor of the doctrine—that the simple 
physiological phenomena known as spirit-rapping, 
table-turning, phreno-magnetism, and I know not 
what other absurd and inappropriate names, are 
due to the direct and personal agency of Satan? 
Why is all this, except from the utter ignorance 
as to the simplest laws of their own animal life, 
which prevails among even the most highly edu- 
cated persons in this country? 
But there are other branches of Biological Sci- 
ence, besides Physiology proper, whose practical 
influence, though less obvious, is not, as I believe, 
less certain. I have heard educated men speak 
with an ill-disguised contempt of the studies of the 
naturalist, and ask, not without a shrug, “ What is 
the use of knowing all about these miserable ani- 
mals—what bearing has it on human life? ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
62 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE ul 
I will endeavour to answer that question. I 
take it that all will admit there is definite Govern- 
ment of this universe—that its pleasures and pains 
are not scattered at random, but are distributed 
in accordance with orderly and fixed laws, and that 
it is only in accordance with all we know of the rest 
of the world, that there should be an agreement 
between one portion of the sensitive creation and 
another in these matters. 
Surely then it interests us to know the lot of 
other animal creatures—however far below us, they 
are still the sole created things which share with 
us the capability of pleasure and the susceptibility 
to pain. 
I cannot but think that he who finds a certain 
proportion of pain and evil inseparably woven up 
in the life of the very worms, will bear his own 
share with more courage and submission; and will, 
at any rate, view with suspicion those weakly 
amiable theories of the Divine government, which 
would have us believe pain to be an oversight and 
a mistake,—to be corrected by and by. On the 
other hand, the predominance of happiness among 
living things—their lavish beauty—the secret and 
wonderful harmony which pervades them all, from 
the highest to the lowest, are equally striking 
refutations of that modern Manichean doctrine, 
which exhibits the world as a slave-mill, worked 
with many tears, for mere utilitarian ends. 
There is yet another way in which natural his-
-P-A-G-E-71
  un OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 63 
tory may, I am convinced, take a profound hold 
upon practical life-—and that is, by its influence 
over our finer feelings, as the greatest of all sources 
of that pleasure which is derivable from beauty. 
I do not pretend that natural-history knowledge, as 
such, can increase our sense of the beautiful in 
natural objects. I do not suppose that the dead 
soul of Peter Bell, of whom the great poet of na- 
ture says,— 
A primrose by the river’s brim, 
A yellow primrose was to him,— 
And it was nothing more,— 
would have been a whit roused from its apathy by 
the information that the primrose is a Dicotyle- 
donous Exogen, with a monopetalous corolla and 
central placentation. But I advocate natural- 
history knowledge from this point of view, because 
it would lead us to seek the beauties of natural 
objects, instead of trusting to chance to force them 
on our attention. To a person uninstructed in 
natural history, his country or sea-side stroll is a 
walk through a gallery filled with wonderful works 
of art, nine-tenths of which have their faces turned 
to the wall. Teach him something of natural 
history, and you place in his hands a catalogue of 
those which are worth turning round. Surely our 
innocent pleasures are not so abundant in this life, 
that we can afford to despise this or any other 
source of them. We should fear being banished 
for our neglect to that limbo, where the great
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 ON THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE IL 
Florentine tells us are those who, during this life, 
“wept when they might be joyful.” 
But I shall be trespassing unwarrantably on 
your kindness, if I do not proceed at once to my 
last point—the time at which Physiological 
Science should first form a part of the Curriculum 
of Education. 
The distinction between the teaching of the 
facts of a science as instruction, and the teaching 
it systematically as knowledge, has already been 
placed before you in a previous lecture: and it 
appears to me that, as with other sciences, the 
common facts of Biology—the uses of parts of the 
body—the names and habits of the living creatures 
which surround us—may be taught with advantage 
to the youngest child. Indeed, the avidity of 
children for this kind of knowledge, and the com- 
parative ease with which they retain it, is some- 
thing quite marvellous. I doubt whether any toy 
would be so acceptable to young children as a 
vivarium of the same kind as, but of course on a 
smaller scale than, those admirable devices in the 
Zoological Gardens. 
On the other hand, systematic teaching in 
Biology cannot be attempted with success until 
the student has attained to a certain knowledge 
of physics and chemistry: for though the phe- 
nomena of life are dependent neither on physical 
nor on chemical, but on vital forces, yet they 
result in all sorts of physical and chemical 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  nu OF THE NATURAL HISTORY SCIENCES 65 
changes, which can only be judged by their own 
laws. 
And now to sum up in a few words the con- 
clusions to which I hope you see reason to fol- 
low me. 
Biology needs no apologist when she demands 
a place—and a prominent place—in any scheme 
of education worthy of the name. Leave out the 
Physiological sciences from your curriculum, and 
you launch the student into the world, undisci- 
plined in that science whose subject-matter would 
best develop his powers of observation; ignorant 
of facts of the deepest importance for his own and 
others’ welfare; blind to the richest sources of 
beauty in God’s creation; and unprovided with 
that belief in a living law, and an order manifest- 
ing itself in and through endless change and 
variety, which might serve to check and moderate 
that phase of despair through which, if he take 
an earnest interest in social problems, he will 
assuredly sooner or later pass. 
Finally, one word for myself. I have not hesi- 
tated to speak strongly where I have felt strongly; 
and I am but too conscious that the indicative and 
imperative moods have too often taken the place of 
the more becoming subjunctive and conditional. I 
feel, therefore, how necessary it is to beg you to 
forget the personality of him who has thus ven- 
tured to address you, and to consider only the truth 
or error in what has been said.

EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE 
[1865] 
Quasute’s plaintive inquiry, “ Am I not a man 
and a brother?” seems at last to have received 
its final reply—the recent decision of the fierce 
trial by battle on the other side of the Atlantic 
fully concurring with that long since delivered 
here in a more peaceful way. 
The question is settled; but even those who 
are most thoroughly convinced that the doom is 
just, must see good grounds for repudiating half 
the arguments which have been employed by the 
winning side; and for doubting whether its 
ultimate results will embody the hopes of the 
victors, though they may more than realise the 
fears of the vanquished. It may be quite true 
that some negroes are better than some white 
men; but no rational man, cognisant of the facts, 
believes that the average negro is the equal, still 
66
-P-A-G-E-75
m EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE 67 
less the superior, of the average white man. And, 
if this be true, it is simply incredible that, when 
all his disabilities are removed, and our prog- 
nathous relative has a fair field and no favour, as 
well as no oppressor, he will be able to compete 
successfully with his bigger-brained and smaller- 
jawed rival, in a contest which is to be carried on 
by thoughts and not by bites. The highest places 
in the hierarchy of civilisation will assuredly not 
be within the reach of our dusky cousins, though it 
is by no means necessary that they should be re- 
stricted to the lowest. But whatever the position 
of stable equilibrium into which the laws of social 
gravitation may bring the negro, all responsibility 
for the result will henceforward lie between 
Nature and him. The white man may wash his 
hands of it, and the Caucasian conscience be void 
of reproach for evermore. And this, if we look to 
the bottom of the matter, is the real justification 
for the abolition policy. 
The doctrine of equal natural rights may be an 
illogical delusion; emancipation may convert the 
slave from a well-fed animal into a pauperised 
man; mankind may even have to do without cot- 
ton shirts; but all these evils must be faced if 
the moral law, that no human being can arbi- 
trarily dominate over another without grievous 
damage to his own nature, be, as many think, as 
readily demonstrable by experiment as any 
physical truth. If this be true, no slavery can  
-P-A-G-E-76
68 EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE wm 
be abolished without a double emancipation, and 
the master will benefit by freedom more than the 
freed-man. : 
The like considerations apply to all the other 
questions of emancipation which are at present 
stirring the world—the multifarious demands that 
classes of mankind shall be relieved from restric- 
tions imposed by the artifice of man, and not by 
the necessities of Nature. One of the most 
important, if not the most important, of all these, 
is that which daily threatens to become the 
“irrepressible” woman question. What social 
and political rights have women? What ought 
they to be allowed, or not allowed, to do, be, and 
suffer? And, as involved in, and underlying all 
these questions, how ought they to be educated? 
There are philogynists as fanatical as any 
“misogynists” who, reversing our antiquated 
notions, bid the man look upon the woman as 
the higher type of humanity; who ask us to re- 
gard the female intellect as the clearer and the 
quicker, if not the stronger; who desire us to 
look up to the feminine moral sense as the purer 
and the nobler; and bid man abdicate his usurped 
sovereignty over Nature in favour of the female 
line. On the other hand, there are persons not 
to be outdone in all loyalty and just respect for 
womankind, but by nature hard of head and 
haters of delusion, however charming, who 
not only repudiate the new woman-worship
-P-A-G-E-77
m EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE 69 
which so many sentimentalists and some 
philosophers are desirous of setting up, but, 
carrying their audacity further, deny even the 
natural equality of the sexes. They assert, on 
the contrary, that in every excellent character, 
whether mental or physical, the average woman 
is inferior to the average man, in the sense of 
having that character less in quantity and lower 
in quality. Tell these persons of the rapid per- 
ceptions and the instinctive intellectual insight of 
women, and they reply that the feminine mental 
peculiarities, which pass under these names, are 
merely the outcome of a greater impressibility to 
the superficial aspects of things, and of the 
absence of that restraint upon expression which, 
in men, is imposed by reflection and a sense of 
responsibility. Talk of the passive endurance of 
the weaker sex, and opponents of this kind remind 
you that Job was a man, and that, until quite 
recent times, patience and long-suffering were 
not counted among the specially feminine virtues. 
Claim passionate tenderness as especially feminine, 
and the inquiry is made whether all the best 
love-poetry in existence (except, perhaps, the 
“Sonnets from the Portuguese”) has not been 
written by men; whether the song which embodies 
the ideal of pure and tender passion—* Adelaida ” 
—was written by Frau Beethoven; whether it was 
the Fornarina, or Raphael, who painted the Sistine 
Madonna. Nay, we have known one such heretic

go so far as to lay his hands upon the ark itself, 
so to speak, and to defend the startling paradox 
that, even’ in physical beauty, man is the superior. 
He admitted, indeed, that there was a brief period 
of early youth when it might be hard to say 
whether the prize should be awarded to the grace- 
ful undulations of the female figure, or the per- 
fect balance and supple vigour of the male frame. 
But while our new Paris might hesitate between 
the youthful Bacchus and the Venus emerging 
from the foam, he averred that, when Venus and 
Bacchus had reached thirty, the point no longer 
admitted of a doubt; the male form having then 
attained its greatest nobility, while the female is 
far gone in decadence; and that, at this epoch, 
womanly beauty, so far as it is independent of 
grace or expression, is a question of drapery and 
accessories. 
Supposing, however, that all these arguments 
have a certain foundation; admitting, for a 
moment, that they are comparable to those by 
which the inferiority of the negro to the white 
man may be demonstrated, are they of any value 
as against woman-emancipation? Do they afford 
us the smallest ground for refusing to educate 
women as well as men—to give women the same 
civil and political rights as men? No mistake is 
so commonly made by clever people as that of 
assuming a cause to be bad because the arguments 
of its supporters are, to a great extent, non-
-P-A-G-E-79
m §EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE 71 
sensical. And we conceive that those who may 
laugh at the arguments of the extreme philogy- 
nists, may yet feel bound to work heart and soul 
towards the attainment of their practical ends. 
As regards education, for example. Granting 
the alleged defects of women, is it not somewhat 
absurd to sanction and maintain a system of edu- 
cation which would seem to have been specially 
contrived to exaggerate all these defects? 
Naturally not so firmly strung, nor so well 
balanced as boys, girls are in great measure 
debarred from the sports and physical exercises 
which are justly thought absolutely necessary for 
the full development of the vigour of the more 
favoured sex. Women are, by nature, more ex- 
citable than men—prone to be swept by tides of 
emotion, proceeding from hidden and inward, as 
well as from obvious and external causes; and 
female education does its best to weaken every 
physical counterpoise to this nervous mobility— 
tends in all ways to stimulate the emotional part 
of the mind and stunt the rest. We find girls 
naturally timid, inclined to dependence, born con- 
servatives; and we teach them that independence 
is unladylike; that blind faith is the right frame 
of mind; and that whatever we may be permitted, 
and indeed encouraged, to do to our brother, our 
sister is to be left to the tyranny of authority 
and tradition. With few insignificant exceptions, 
girls have been educated either to be drudges, 
65

or toys, beneath man; or a sort of angels above 
him; the highest ideal aimed at oscillating be- 
tween Clirchen and Beatrice. The possibility 
that the ideal of womanhood lies neither in the 
fair saint, nor in the fair sinner; that the female 
type of character is neither better nor worse than 
the male, but only weaker; that women are meant 
neither to be men’s guides nor their playthings, 
but their comrades, their fellows, and their equals, 
so far as Nature puts no bar to that equality, 
does not seem to have entered into the minds of 
those who have had the conduct of the education 
of girls. 
If the present system of female education 
stands self-condemned, as inherently absurd; and 
if that which we have just indicated is the true 
position of woman, what is the first step towards 
a better state of things? We reply, emancipate 
girls. Recognise the fact that they share the 
senses, perceptions, feelings, reasoning powers, 
emotions of boys, and that the mind of the 
average girl is less different from that of the aver- 
age boy, than the mind of one boy is from that 
of another; so that whatever argument justifies 
a given education for all boys, justifies its appli- 
cation to girls as well. So far from imposing 
artificial restrictions upon the acquirement of 
knowledge by women, throw every facility in their 
way. Let our Faustinas, if they will, toil through 
the whole round of
-P-A-G-E-81
  
mut EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE 73 
“ Juristerei und Medizin, 
Und leider! auch Philosophie.” 
Let us have “sweet girl graduates” by all means. 
They will be none the less sweet for a little wis- 
dom; and the “golden hair” will not curl less 
gracefully outside the head by reason of there 
being brains within. Nay, if obvious practical 
difficulties can be overcome, let those women who 
feel inclined to do so descend into the gladiatorial 
arena of life, not merely in the guise of retiaria, 
as heretofore, but as bold sicari@, breasting the 
open fray. Let them, if they so please, become 
merchants, barristers, politicians. Let them have 
a fair field, but let them understand, as the neces- 
sary correlative, that they are to have no favour. 
Let Nature alone sit high above the lists, “rain 
influence and judge the prize.” 
And the result? For our parts, though loth 
to prophesy, we believe it will be that of other 
emancipations. Women will find their place, and 
it will neither be that in which they have been 
held, nor that to which some of them aspire. 
Nature’s old salique law will not be repealed, and 
no change of dynasty will be effected. The big 
chests, the massive brains, the vigorous muscles 
and stout frames of the best men will carry the 
day, whenever it is worth their while to contest 
the prizes of life with the best women. And the 
hardship of it is that the very improvement of 
the women will lessen their chances. Better 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
    
74 EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE ut 
mothers will bring forth better sons, and the im- 
petus gained by the one sex will be transmitted, in 
the next generation, to the other. The most Dar- 
winian of theorists will not venture to propound 
the doctrine, that the physical disabilities under 
which women have hitherto laboured in the strug- 
gle for existence with men are likely to be re- 
moved by even the most skilfully conducted pro- 
cess of educational selection. 
We are, indeed, fully prepared to believe that 
the bearing of children may, and ought to, become 
as free from danger and long disability to the 
civilised woman as it is to the savage; nor is it 
improbable that, as society advances towards its 
right organisation, motherhood will occupy a less 
space of woman’s life than it has hitherto done. 
But still, unless the human species is to come to 
an end altogether—a consummation which can 
hardly be desired by even the most ardent advo- 
cate of “women’s rights”—somebody must be 
good enough to take the trouble and responsibility 
of annually adding to the world exactly as many 
people as die out of it. In consequence of some 
domestic difficulties, Sydney Smith is said to have 
suggested that it would have been good for the 
human race had the model offered by the hive 
been followed, and had all the working part of the 
female community been neuters. Failing any 
thorough-going reform of this kind, we see noth- 
ing for it but the old division of humanity into
-P-A-G-E-83
  mm EMANCIPATION—BLACK AND WHITE 17%5 
men potentially, or actually, fathers, and women 
potentially, if not actually, mothers. And we fear 
that so long as this potential motherhood is her 
lot, woman will be found to be fearfully weighted 
in the race of life. 
The duty of man is to see that not a grain is 
piled upon that load beyond what Nature im- 
poses; that injustice is not added to inequality.

A LIBERAL EDUCATION; AND WHERE 
TO FIND IT 
[1868] 
Tue business which the South London Work- 
ing Men’s College has undertaken is a great work; 
indeed, I might say, that Education, with which 
that college proposes to grapple, is the greatest 
work of all those which lie ready to a man’s hand 
just at present. 
And, at length, this fact is becoming generally 
recognised. You cannot go anywhere without 
hearing a buzz of more or less confused and con- 
tradictory talk on this subject—nor can you fail 
to notice that, in one point at any rate, there is 
a very decided advance upon like discussions in 
former days. Nobody outside the agricultural 
interest now dares to say that education is a bad 
thing. If any representative of the once large 
and powerful party, which, in former days, pro- 
claimed this opinion, still exists in the semi-fossil 
6
-P-A-G-E-85
  Iv A LIBERAL EDUCATION QT 
state, he keeps his thoughts to himself. In fact, 
there is a chorus of voices, almost distressing in 
their harmony, raised in favour of the doctrine 
that education is the great panacea for human 
troubles, and that, if the country is not shortly to 
go to the dogs, everybody must be educated. 
"The politicians tell us, “You must educate 
the masses because they are going to be masters.” 
The clergy join in the cry for education, for they 
affirm that the people are drifting away from 
church and chapel into the broadest infidelity. 
The manufacturers and the capitalists swell the 
chorus lustily. They declare that ignorance 
makes bad workmen; that England will soon be 
unable to turn out cotton goods, or steam engines, 
cheaper than other people; and then, Ichabod! 
Ichabod! the glory will be departed from us. And 
a few voices are lifted up in favour of the doctrine 
that the masses should be educated because they 
are men and women with unlimited capacities of 
being, doing, and suffering, and that it is as true 
now, as it ever was, that the people perish for lack 
of knowledge. 
These members of the minority, with whom I 
confess I have a good deal of sympathy, are doubt- 
ful whether any of the other reasons urged in 
favour of the education of the people are of much 
value—whether, indeed, some of them are based 
upon either wise or noble grounds of action. They 
question if it be wise to tell people that you will
-P-A-G-E-86
18 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
do for them, out of fear of their power, what you 
have left undone, so long as your only motive was 
compassion for their weakness and their sorrows. 
And, if ignorance of everything which it is need- 
ful a ruler should know is likely to do so much 
harm in the governing classes of the future, why 
is it, they ask reasonably enough, that such igno- 
rance in the governing classes of the past has not 
been viewed with equal horror? 
Compare the average artisan and the average 
country squire, and it may be doubted if you will 
find a pin to choose between the two in point of 
ignorance, class feeling, or prejudice. It is true 
that the ignorance is of a different sort—that the 
class feeling is in favour of a different class—and 
that the prejudice has a distinct savour of wrong- 
headedness in each case—but it is questionable 
if the one is either a bit better, or a bit worse, 
than the other. The old protectionist theory is 
the doctrine of trades unions as applied by the 
squires, and the modern trades unionism is the 
doctrine of the squires applied by the artisans. 
Why should we be worse off under one régime than 
under the other? 
Again, this sceptical minority asks the clergy 
to think whether it is really want of education 
which keeps the masses away from their ministra- 
tions—whether the most completely educated men 
are not as open to reproach on this score as the 
workmen; and whether, perchance, this may not

indicate that it is not education which lies at the . 
bottom of the matter? 
Once more, these people, whom there is no 
pleasing, venture to doubt whether the glory which 
rests upon being able to undersell all the rest of 
the world, is a very safe kind of glory—whether 
we may not purchase it too dear; especially if we 
allow education, which ought to be directed to 
the making of men, to be diverted into a process 
of manufacturing human tools, wonderfully adroit 
in the exercise of some technical industry, but 
good for nothing else. 
And, finally, these people inquire whether it is 
the masses alone who need a reformed and im- 
proved education. They ask whether the richest 
of our public schools might not well be made to 
supply knowledge, as well as gentlemanly habits, 
a strong class feeling, and eminent proficiency in 
cricket. They seem to think that the noble foun- 
dations of our old universities are hardly fulfilling 
their functions in their present posture of half- 
clerical seminaries, half racecourses, where men 
are trained to win a senior wrangleship, or a dou- 
ble-first, as horses are trained to win a cup, with 
as little reference to the needs of after-life in the 
case of a man as in that of the racer. And, 
while as zealous for education as the rest, they 
affirm that, if the education of the richer classes 
were such as to fit them to be the leaders and the 
governors of the poorer; and, if the education of  
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
the poorer classes were such as to enable them to 
appreciate really wise guidance and good govern- 
ance, the politicians need not fear mob-law, nor 
the clergy lament their want of flocks, nor the 
capitalists prognosticate the annihilation of the 
prosperity of the country. 
Such is the diversity of opinion upon the why 
and the wherefore of education. And my hearers 
will be prepared to expect that the practical recom- 
mendations which are put forward are not less 
discordant. There is a loud cry for compulsory 
education. We English, in spite of constant ex- 
perience to the contrary, preserve a touching faith 
in the efficacy of acts of Parliament; and I believe 
we should have compulsory education in the course 
of next session, if there were the least probability 
that half a dozen leading statesmen of different 
parties would agree what that education should be. 
Some hold that education without theology is 
worse than none. Others maintain, quite as 
strongly, that education with theology is in the 
same predicament. But this is certain, that those 
who hold the first opinion can by no means agree 
what theology should be taught; and that those 
who maintain the second are in a small minority. 
At any rate “ make people learn to read, write, 
and cipher,” say a great many; and the advice is 
undoubtedly sensible as far as it goes. But, as 
has happened to me in former days, those who, in 
despair of getting anything better, advocate this
-P-A-G-E-89
  
Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 81 
measure, are met with the objection that it is very 
like making a child practise the use of a knife, 
fork, and spoon, without giving it a particle of 
meat. I really don’t know what reply is to be 
made to such an objection. 
But it would be unprofitable to spend more 
time in disentangling, or rather in showing up 
the knots in, the ravelled skeins of our neighbours. 
Much more to the purpose is it to ask if we possess 
any clue of our own which may guide us among 
these entanglements. And by way of a beginning, 
let us ask ourselves—What is education? Above 
all things, what is our ideal of a thoroughly 
liberal education ?—of that education which, if we 
could begin life again, we would give ourselyes— 
of that education which, if we could mould the 
fates to our own will, we would give our children? 
Well, I know not what may be your conceptions 
upon this matter, but I will tell you mine, and I 
hope I shall find that our views are not very dis- 
crepant. 
Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life 
and fortune of every one of us would, one day or 
other, depend upon his winning or losing a game 
of chess. Don’t you think that we should all 
consider it to be a primary duty to learn at least 
the names and the moves of the pieces; to have a 
notion of a gambit, and a keen eye for all the 
means of giving and getting out of check? Do
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
you not think that we should look with a disap- 
probation amounting to scorn, upon the father 
who allowed his son, or the state which allowed its 
members, to grow up without knowing a pawn 
from a knight? 
ee Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, 
that the life, the fortune, and the happiness of 
every one of us, and, more or less, of those who are 
connected with us, do depend upon our knowing 
something of the rules of a game infinitely more 
difficult and complicated than chess. It is a game 
which has been played for untold ages, every man 
and woman of us being one of the two players in 
a game of his or her own.) The chess-board is 
the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the 
universe, the rules of the game are what we call 
the laws of Nature. The player on the other side 
is hidden from us. We know that his play is 
always fair, just and patient.. But also we know, 
to our cost, that he never overlooks a mistake, or 
makes the smallest allowance for ignorance. To 
the man who plays well, the highest stakes are 
paid,-with that sort of overflowing generosity with 
which the strong shows delight in strength. And 
one who plays ill is checkmated—without haste, 
but without remorse. 
My metaphor will remind some of you of the 
famous picture in which Retzsch has depicted 
Satan playing at chess with man for his soul. 
Substitute for the mocking fiend in that picture
-P-A-G-E-91
    
Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 83 
a calm, strong angel who is playing for love, as 
we say, and would rather lose than win—and I 
should accept it as an image of human life. 
Well, what I mean by Education is learning 
the rules of this mighty game. In other words, 
education is the instruction of the intellect in the 
laws of Nature, under which name I include not 
merely things and their forces, but men and their 
ways; and the fashioning of the affections and of 
the will into an earnest and loving desire to move 
in harmony with those laws. For me, education 
means neither more nor less than this. Anything 
which professes to call itself education must be 
tried by this standard, and if it fails to stand the 
test, I will not call it education, whatever may be 
the force of authority, or of numbers, upon the 
other side. 
It is important to remember that, in strictness, 
there is no such thing as an uneducated man. 
Take an extreme case. Suppose that an adult 
man, in the full vigour of his faculties, could be 
suddenly placed in the world, as Adam is said to 
have been, and then left to do as he best might. 
How long would he be left uneducated? ‘Not five 
minutes. Nature would begin to teach him, 
through the eye, the ear, the touch, the properties 
of objects. Pain and pleasure would be at his 
elbow telling him to do this and avoid that; and 
by slow degrees the man would receive an educa- 
tion which, if narrow, would be thorough, real, 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
and adequate to his circumstances, though there 
would be no extras and very few accomplish- 
ments. 
And if to this solitary man entered a second 
Adam, or, better still, an Eve, a new and greater 
world, that of social and moral phenomena, would 
be revealed. Joys and woes, compared with which 
all others might seem but faint shadows, would 
spring from the new relations. Happiness and 
sorrow would take the place of the coarser moni- 
tors, pleasure and pain; but conduct would still 
be shaped by the observation of the natural con- 
sequences of actions; or, in other words, by the 
laws of the nature of man. 
To every one of us the world was once as fresh 
and new as to Adam. And then, long before we 
were susceptible of any other modes of instruction, 
Nature took us in hand, and every minute of 
waking life brought its educational influence, 
shaping our actions into rough accordance with 
Nature’s laws, so that we might not be ended 
untimely by too gross disobedience. Nor should I 
speak of this process of education as past for any 
one, be he as old as he may. For every man the 
world is as fresh as it was at the first day, and as 
full of untold novelties for him who has the eyes 
to see them. And Nature is still continuing her 
patient education of us in that great university, 
the universe, of which we are all members—Na- 
ture having no Test-Acts.

© Those who take honours in Nature’s university, 
who learn the laws which govern men and things 
and obey them, are the really great and successful 
men in this world’ The great mass of mankind 
are the “ Poll,” who pick up just enough to get 
through without much discredit. Those who won’t 
learn at all are plucked; and then you can’t come 
up again. Nature’s pluck means extermination. 
Thus the question of compulsory education is 
settled so far as Nature is concerned. Her bill on 
that question was framed and passed long ago. 
But, like all compulsory legislation, that of Nature 
is harsh and wasteful in its operation. Ignorance 
is visited as sharply as wilful disobedience—inca- 
pacity meets with the same punishment as crime. 
Nature’s discipline is not even a word and a blow, 
and the blow first; but the blow without the word. 
It is left to you to find out why your ears are 
boxed. 
The object of what we commonly call educa- 
tion—that education in which man intervenes and 
which I shall distinguish as artificial education—is 
to make good these defects in Nature’s methods; 
to prepare the child to receive Nature’s education, 
neither incapably nor ignorantly, nor with wilful 
disobedience; and to understand the preliminary 
symptoms of her pleasure, without waiting for the 
box on the ear. In short, all artificial education 
ought to be an anticipation of natural education. 
And a liberal education is an artificial education 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
which has not only prepared a man to escape the 
great evils of disobedience to natural laws, but has 
trained him to appreciate and to seize upon the re- 
wards, which Nature scatters with as free a hand 
as her penalties. 
That man, I think, has had a liberal education 
who has been so trained in youth that his body is 
the ready servant of his will, and does with ease 
and pleasure all the work that, as a mechanism, it 
is capable of; whose intellect is a clear, cold, logic 
engine, with all its parts of equal strength, and in 
smooth working order; ready, like a steam engine, 
to be turned to any kind of work, and spin the 
gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the mind; 
whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the 
great and fundamental truths of Nature and of 
the laws of her operations; one who, no stunted 
ascetic, is full of life and fire, but whose passions 
are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will, the 
servant of a tender conscience; who has learned to 
love all beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to 
hate all vileness, and to respect others as himself. 
Such an one and no other, I conceive, has had 
a liberal education; for he is, as completely as a 
man can be, in harmony with Nature. He will 
make the best of her, and she of him. They will 
get on together rarely; she as his ever beneficent 
mother; he as her mouthpiece, her conscious self, 
her minister and interpreter. 
Where is such an education as this to be had?
-P-A-G-E-95
  
Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 87 
Where is there any approximation to it? Has any 
one tried to found such an education? Look- 
ing oyer the length and breadth of these islands, 
I am afraid that all these questions must re- 
ceive a negative answer. Consider our primary 
schools and what is taught in them. A child 
learns— 
1. To read, write, and cipher, more or less 
well; but in a very large proportion of cases not so 
well as to take pleasure in reading, or to be able to 
write the commonest letter properly. 
2. A quantity of dogmatic theology, of which 
the child, nine times out of ten, understands next 
to nothing. 
3. Mixed up with this, so as to seem to stand 
or fall with it, a few of the broadest and simplest 
principles of morality. This, to my mind, is much 
as if a man of science should make the story of the 
fall of the apple in Newton’s garden an integral 
part of the doctrine of gravitation, and teach it 
as of equal authority with the law of the inverse 
squares. 
4. A good deal of Jewish history and Syrian 
geography, and perhaps a little something about 
English history and the geography of the child’s 
own country. But I doubt if there is a primary 
school in England in which hangs a map of the 
hundred in which the village lies, so that the chil- 
dren may be practically taught by it what a map 
means. 
66 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    
88 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
5. A certain amount of regularity, attentive 
obedience, respect for others: obtained by fear, if 
the master be incompetent or foolish; by love and 
reverence, if he be wise. 
So far as this school course embraces a training 
in the theory and practice of obedience to the 
moral laws of Nature, I gladly admit, not only 
that it contains a valuable educational element, 
but that, so far, it deals with the most valuable 
and important part of all education. Yet, contrast 
what is done in this direction with what might be 
done; with the time given to matters of compara- 
tively no importance; with the absence of any 
attention to things of the highest moment; and 
one is tempted to think of Falsaff’s bill and “ the 
halfpenny worth of bread to all that quantity of 
sack.” 
Let us consider what a child thus “ educated ” 
knows, and what it does not know. Begin with 
the most important topic of all—morality, as the 
guide of conduct. The child knows well enough 
that some acts meet with approbation and some 
with disapprobation. But it has never heard that 
there lies in the nature of things a reason for every 
moral law, as cogent and as well defined as that 
which underlies every physical law; that stealing 
and lying are just as certain to be followed by evil 
consequences, as putting your hand in the fire, or 
jumping out of a garret window. Again, though 
the scholar may have been made acquainted, in
-P-A-G-E-97
  
Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 89 
dogmatic fashion, with the broad laws of morality, 
he has had no training in the application of those 
laws to the difficult problems which result from the 
complex conditions of modern civilisation. Would 
it not be very hard to expect any one to solve a 
problem in conic sections who had merely been 
taught the axioms and definitions of mathematical 
science? 
A workman has to bear hard labour, and per- 
haps privation, while he sees others rolling in 
wealth, and feeding their dogs with what would 
keep his children from starvation. Would it not 
be well to have helped that man to calm the natu- 
ral promptings of discontent by showing him, in 
his youth, the necessary connection of the moral 
law which prohibits stealing with the stability of 
society—by proving to him, once for all, that it is 
better for his own people, better for himself, better 
for future generations, that he should starve than 
steal? If you have no foundation of knowledge, 
or habit of thought, to work upon, what chance 
have you of persuading a hungry man that a capi- 
talist is not a thief “with a circumbendibus? ” 
And if he honestly believes that, of what avail is it 
to quote the commandment against stealing, when 
he proposes to make the capitalist disgorge? 
Again, the child learns absolutely nothing of 
the history or the political organisation of his own 
country. His general impression is, that every- 
thing of much importance happened a very long 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
while ago; and that the Queen and the gentlefolks 
govern the country much after the fashion of 
King David and the elders and nobles of Israel— 
his sole models. Will you give a man with this 
much information a vote? In easy times he sells 
it for a pot of beer. Why should he not? It is 
of about as much use to him as a chignon, and he 
knows as much what to do with it, for any other 
purpose. In bad times, on the contrary, he ap- 
plies his simple theory of government, and believes 
that his rulers are the cause of his sufferings—a 
belief which sometimes bears remarkable practical 
fruits. 
Least of all, does the child gather from this 
primary “education ” of ours a conception of the 
laws of the physical world, or of the relations of 
cause and effect therein. And this is the more to 
be lamented, as the poor are especially exposed to 
physical evils, and are more interested in removing 
them than any other class of the community. If 
any one is concerned in knowing the ordinary laws 
of mechanics one would think it is the hand- 
labourer, whose daily toil lies among levers and 
pulleys; or among the other implements of artisan 
work. And if any one is interested in the laws of 
health, it is the poor workman, whose strength is 
wasted by ill-prepared food, whose health is sapped 
by bad ventilation and bad drainage, and half 
whose children are massacred by disorders which 
might be prevented. Not only does our present    
-P-A-G-E-99
  Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 91 
primary education carefully abstain from hinting 
to the workman that some of his greatest evils, 
are traceable to mere physical agencies, which 
could be removed by energy, patience, and frugal- 
ity; but it does worse—it renders him, so far as 
it can, deaf to those who could help him, and 
tries to substitute an Oriental submission to what 
is falsely declared to be the will of God, for 
his natural tendency to strive after a better con- 
dition. 
What wonder, then, if very recently an appeal 
has been made to statistics for the profoundly fool- 
ish purpose of showing that education is of no 
good—that it diminishes neither misery nor crime 
among the masses of mankind? I reply, why 
should the thing which has been called education 
do either the one or the other? If I am a knave 
or a fool, teaching me to read and write won’t 
make me less of either one or the other—unless 
somebody shows me how to put my reading and 
writing to wise and good purposes. 
Suppose any one were to argue that medicine 
is of no use, because it could be proved statistic- 
ally, that the percentage of deaths was just the 
same among people who had been taught how to 
open a medicine chest, and among those who did 
not so much as know the key by sight. The 
argument is absurd; but it is not more prepos- 
terous than that against which I am contending. 
The only medicine for suffering, crime, and all
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Vv 
the other woes of mankind, is wisdom. Teach a 
man to read and write, and you have put into his 
hands the great keys of the wisdom box. | But it 
is quite another matter whether he ever opens the 
box or not. And he is as likely to poison as to 
cure himself, if, without guidance, he swallows the 
first drug that comes to hand. In these times a 
man may as well be purblind, as unable to read— 
lame, as unable to write. But I protest that, if I 
thought the alternative were a necessary one, I 
would rather that the children of the poor should 
grow up ignorant of both these mighty arts, than 
that they should remain ignorant of that knowl- 
edge to which these arts are means. 
It may be said that all these animadversions 
may apply to primary schools, but that the higher 
schools, at any rate, must be allowed to give a 
liberal education. In fact they professedly sacri- 
fice everything else to this object. 
Let us inquire into this matter. What do the 
higher schools, those to which the great middle 
class of the country sends its children, teach, over 
and above the instruction given in the primary 
schools? There is a little more reading and writ- 
ing of English. But, for all that, every one knows 
that it is a rare thing to find a boy of the middle 
or upper classes who can read aloud decently, or 
who can put his thoughts on paper in clear and 
grammatical (to say nothing of good or elegant)
-P-A-G-E-101
v AND WHERE TO FIND IT 93 
language. The “ciphering” of the lower schools 
expands into elementary mathematics in the high- 
er; into arithmetic, with a litle algebra, a little 
Euclid. , But I doubt if one boy in five hundred 
has ever heard the explanation of a rule of arith- 
metic, or knows his Euclid otherwise than by rote. 
Of theology, the middle class schoolboy gets 
rather less than poorer children, less absolutely 
and less relatively, because there are so many 
other claims upon his attention. I venture to say 
that, in the great majority of cases, his ideas on 
this subject when he leaves school are of the most 
shadowy and vague description, and associated 
with painful impressions of the weary hours spent 
in learning collects and catechism by heart. 
Modern geography, modern history, modern 
literature; the English language as a language; 
the whole circle of the sciences, physical, moral 
and social, are even more completely ignored in 
the higher than in the lower schools. Up till 
within a few years back, a boy might have passed 
through any one of the great public schools with 
the greatest distinction and credit, and might 
never so much as have heard of one of the subjects 
I have just mentioned. He might never have 
heard that the earth goes round the sun; that 
England underwent a great revolution in 1688, 
and France another in 1789; that there once lived 
certain notable men called Chaucer, Shakespeare, 
Milton, Voltaire, Goethe, Schiller. The first
-P-A-G-E-102

might be a German and the last an Englishman 
for anything he could tell you to the contrary. 
And as for Science, the only idea the word would 
suggest to his mind would be dexterity in box- 
ing. 
I have said that this was the state of things a 
few years back, for the sake of the few righteous 
who are to be found among the educational cities 
of the plain. But I would not have you too 
sanguine about the result, if you sound the minds 
of the existing generation of public schoolboys, on 
such topics as those I have mentioned. 
Now let us pause to consider this wonderful 
state of affairs; for the time will come when Eng- 
lishmen will quote it as the stock example of the 
stolid stupidity of their ancestors in the nine- 
teenth century. The most thoroughly commercial 
people, the greatest voluntary wanderers and 
colonists the world has ever seen, are precisely 
the middle class of this country. If there be a 
people which has been busy making history on the 
great scale for the last three hundred years—and 
the most profoundly interesting history—history 
which, if it happened to be that of Greece or Rome, 
we should study with avidity—it is the English. 
If there be a people which, during the same period, 
has developed a remarkable literature, it is our 
own. If there be a nation whose prosperity de- 
pends absolutely and wholly upon their mastery 
over the forces of Nature, upon their intelligent
-P-A-G-E-103
  
Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 95 
apprehension of, and obedience to the laws of the 
creation and distribution of wealth, and of the 
stable equilibrium of the forces of society, it is 
precisely this nation. And yet this is what these 
wonderful people tell their sons:—“ At the cost of 
from one to two thousand pounds of our hard- 
earned money, we devote twelve of the most pre- 
cious years of your lives to school. There you 
shall toil, or be supposed to toil; but there you 
shall not learn one single thing of all those you 
will most want to know directly you leave school 
and enter upon the practical business of life. You 
will in all probability go into business, but you 
shall not know where, or how, any article of com- 
merce is produced, or the difference between an 
export or an import, or the meaning of the word 
‘capital.’ You will very likely settle in a colony, 
but you shall not know whether Tasmania is part 
of New South Wales, or vice versd. 
“Very probably you may become a manufac- 
turer, but you shall not be provided with the 
means of understanding the working of one of 
your own steam-engines, or the nature of the raw 
products you employ; and, when you are asked to 
buy a patent, you shall not have the slightest 
means of judging whether the inventor is an im- 
postor who is contravening the elementary prin- 
ciples of science, or a man who will make you as 
rich as Croesus. 
“You will very likely get into the House of
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
Commons. You will have to take your share in 
making laws which may prove a blessing or a 
curse to millions of men. But you shall not hear 
one word respecting the political organisation of 
your country; the meaning of the controversy be- 
tween free-traders and protectionists shall never 
have been mentioned to you; you shall not so 
much as know that there are such things as eco- 
nomical laws. 
“The mental power which will be of most im- 
portance in your daily life will be the power of 
seeing things as they are without regard to au- 
thority; and of drawing accurate general conclu- 
sions from particular facts. But at school and at 
college you shall know of no source of truth but 
authority; nor exercise your reasoning faculty 
upon anything but deduction from that which is 
laid down by authority. 
“You will have to weary your soul with work, 
and many a time eat your bread in sorrow and 
in bitterness, and you shall not have learned to 
take refuge in the great source of pleasure with- 
out alloy, the serene resting-place for worn human 
nature,—the world of art.” 
Said I not rightly that we are a wonderful 
people? I am quite prepared to allow, that edu- 
cation entirely devoted to these omitted subjects 
might not be a completely liberal education.

  Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 97 
that the education which should embrace these 
subjects and no others would be a real education, 
though an incomplete one; while an education 
which omits them is really not an education at 
all, but a more or less useful course of intellectual 
gymnastics? 
For what does the middle-class school put in 
the place of all these things which are left out? 
It substitutes what is usually comprised under 
the compendious title of the “classics ””—that is 
to say, the languages, the literature, and the his- 
tory of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and the 
geography of so much of the world as was known 
to these two great nations of antiquity. Now, do 
not expect me to depreciate the earnest and en- 
lightened pursuit of classical learning. I have not 
the least desire to speak ill of such occupations, 
nor any sympathy with them who run them down. 
On the contrary, if my opportunities had lain in 
that direction, there is no investigation into which 
I could have thrown myself with greater delight 
than that of antiquity. 
What science can present greater attractions 
than philology? How can a lover of literary ex- 
cellence fail to rejoice in the ancient master- 
pieces? And with what consistency could I, whose 
business lies so much in the attempt to decipher 
the past, and to build up intelligible forms out 
of the scattered fragments of long-extinct beings, 
fail to take a sympathetic, though an unlearned,
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; WV 
interest in the labours of a Niebuhr, a Gibbon, or 
a Grote? Classical history is a great section of 
the paleontology of man; and I have the same 
double respect for it as for other kinds of paleon- 
tology—that is to say, a respect for the facts which 
it establishes as for all facts, and a still greater 
respect for it as a preparation for the discovery of 
a law of progress. 
But if the classics were taught as they might 
be taught—if boys and girls were instructed in 
Greek and Latin, not merely as languages, but as 
illustrations of philological science; if a vivid pic- 
ture of life on the shores of the Mediterranean two 
thousand years ago were imprinted on the minds 
of scholars; if ancient history were taught, not as 
a weary series of feuds and fights, but traced to its 
causes in such men placed under such conditions; 
if, lastly, the study of the classical books were 
followed in such a manner as to impress boys with 
their beauties, and with the grand simplicity of 
their statement of the everlasting problems of 
human life, instead of with their verbal: and gram- 
matical peculiarities; I still think it as little proper 
that they should form the basis of a liberal edu- 
cation for our contemporaries, as I should think 
it fitting to make that sort of paleontology with 
which I am familiar the back-bone of modern edu- 
cation. 
It is wonderful how close a parallel to classical 
training could be made out of that paleontology
-P-A-G-E-107
  
Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 99 
to which I refer. In the first place I could get 
up an osteological primer so arid, so pedantic in 
its terminology, so altogether distasteful to the 
youthful mind, as to beat the recent famous pro- 
duction of the head-masters out of the field in all 
these excellences. Next, I could exercise my boys 
upon easy fossils, and bring out all their powers of 
memory and all their ingenuity in the application 
of my osteo-grammatical rules to the interpreta- 
tion, or construing, of those fragments. To those 
who had reached the higher classes, I might sup- 
ply odd bones-to-be built up into animals, giving 
great honour and reward to him who succeeded in 
fabricating monsters most entirely in accordance 
with the rules. That would answer to verse-mak- 
ing and essay-writing in the dead languages. 
To be sure, if a great comparative anatomist 
were to look at these fabrications he might shake 
his head, or laugh. But what then? Would 
such a catastrophe destroy the parallel? What, 
think you, would Cicero, or Horace, say to the 
production of the best sixth form going? And 
would not Terence stop his ears and run out if he 
could be present at an English performance of his 
own plays? Would Hamlet, in the mouths of a 
set of French actors, who should insist on pro- 
nouncing English after the fashion of their own 
tongue, be more hideously ridiculous? 
But it will be said that I am forgetting the 
beauty, and the human interest, which appertain
-P-A-G-E-108

to classical studies. To this I reply that it is only 
a very strong man who can appreciate the charms 
of a landscape as he is toiling up a steep hill, 
along a bad road. What with short-windedness, 
stones, ruts, and a pervading sense of the wisdom 
of rest and be thankful, most of us have little 
enough sense of the beautiful under these circum- 
stances. The ordinary schoolboy is precisely in 
this case. He finds Parnassus uncommonly steep, 
and there is no chance of his having much time or 
inclination to look about him till he gets to the 
top. And nine times out of ten he does not get to 
the top. 
But if this be a fair picture of the results of 
classical teaching at its best—and I gather from 
those who have authority to speak on such matters 
that it is so—what is to be said of classical teach- 
ing at its worst, or in other words, of the classics 
of our ordinary middle-class schools? * I will 
tell you. It means getting up endless forms and 
rules by heart. It means turning Latin and Greek 
into English, for the mere sake of being able to do 
it, and without the smallest regard to the worth, 
or worthlessness, of the author read. It means 
the learning of innumerable, not always decent, 
fables in such a shape that the meaning they once 
had is dried up into utter trash; and the only im- 
pression left upon a boy’s mind is, that the people

who believed such things must have been the 
greatest idiots the world ever saw. And it means, 
finally, that after a dozen years spent at this kind 
of work, the sufferer shall be incompetent to in- 
terpret a passage in an author he has not already 
got up; that he shall loathe the sight of a Greek 
or Latin book; and that he shall never open, or 
think of, a classical writer again, until, wonderful 
to relate, he insists upon submitting his sons to 
the same process. 
These be your gods, O Israel! For the sake 
of this net result (and respectability) the British 
father denies his children all the knowledge they 
might turn to account in life, not merely for the 
achievement of vulgar success, but for guidance in 
the great crises of human existence. This is the 
stone he offers to those whom he is bound by the 
strongest and tenderest ties to feed with bread. 
If primary and secondary education are in this 
unsatisfactory state, what is to be said to the uni- 
versities? This is an awful subject, and one I al- 
most fear to touch with my unhallowed hands; 
but I can tell you what those say who have au- 
thority to speak. 
The Rector of Lincoln College, in his lately 
published valuable “Suggestions for Academical 
Organisation with especial reference to Oxford,” 
tells us (p. 127):— 
“The colleges were, in their origin, endow-
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
ments, not for the elements of a general liberal 
education, but for the prolonged study of special 
and professional faculties by men of riper age. 
The universities embraced both these objects. 
The colleges, while they incidentally aided in ele- 
mentary education, were specially devoted to the 
highest learning . . . 
“This was the theory of the middle-age uni- 
versity and the design of collegiate foundations 
in their origin. Time and circumstances have 
brought about a total change. The colleges no 
longer promote the researches of science, or direct 
professional study. Here and there college walls 
may shelter an occasional student, but not in 
larger proportions than may be found in private 
life. Elementary teaching of youths under twenty 
is now the only function performed by the univer- 
sity, and almost the only object of college endow- 
ments. Colleges were homes for the life-study of 
the highest and most abstruse parts of knowledge. 
They have become boarding schools in which the 
elements of the learned languages are taught to 
youths.” 
If Mr. Pattison’s high position, and his obvious 
love and respect for his university, be insufficient 
to convince the outside world that language so 
severe is yet no more than just, the authority of © 
the Commissioners who reported on the University 
of Oxford in 1850 is open to no challenge. Yet 
they write:— " 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  IV AND WHERE TO FIND IT 103 
“Tt is generally acknowledged that both Ox- 
ford and the country at large suffer greatly from 
the absence of a body of learned men devoting 
their lives to the cultivation of science, and to the 
direction of academical education. 
“The fact that so few books of profound re- 
search emanate from the University of Oxford, 
materially impairs its character as a seat of 
learning, and consequently its hold on the respect 
of the nation.” 
Cambridge can claim no exemption from the 
reproaches addressed to Oxford. And thus there 
seems no escape from the admission that what we 
fondly call our great seats of learning are simply 
“)oarding schools” for bigger boys; that learned 
men are not more numerous in them than out of 
them; that the advancement of knowledge is not 
the object of fellows of colleges; that, in the 
philosophic calm and meditative stillness of their 
greenswarded courts, philosophy does not thrive, 
and meditation bears few fruits. 
It is my great good fortune to reckon amongst 
my friends resident members of both universities, 
who are men of learning and research, zealous 
cultivators of science, keeping before their minds 
a noble ideal of a university, and doing their best 
to make that ideal a reality; and, to me, they 
would necessarily typify the universities, did not 
the authoritative statements I have quoted com- 
pel me to believe that they are exceptional, and 
67
-P-A-G-E-112
    104 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
not representative men. Indeed, upon calm con- 
sideration, several circumstances lead me to think 
that the Rector of Lincoln College and the Com- 
missioners cannot be far wrong. 
I believe there can be no doubt that the 
foreigner who should wish to become acquainted 
with the scientific, or the literary, activity of 
modern England, would simply lose his time and 
his pains if he visited our universities with that 
object. 
And, as for works of profound research on any 
subject, and, above all, in that classical lore for 
which the universities profess to sacrifice almost 
everything else, why, a third-rate, poverty-stricken 
German university turns out more produce of that 
kind in one year, than our vast and wealthy foun- 
dations elaborate in ten. 
Ask the man who is investigating any question, 
profoundly and thoroughly—he it historical, philo- 
sophical, philological, physical, literary, or theo- 
logical; who is trying to make himself master of 
any abstract subject (except, perhaps, political 
economy and geology, both of which are intensely 
Anglican sciences), whether he is not compelled 
to read half a dozen times as many German as 
English books? And whether, of these English 
books, more than one in ten is the work of a 
fellow of a college, or a professor of an English 
university? 
Is this from any lack of power in the English
-P-A-G-E-113
  Iv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 105 
as compared with the German mind? The 
countrymen of Grote and of Mill, of Faraday, of 
Robert Brown, of Lyell, and of Darwin, to go no 
further back than the contemporaries of men of 
middle age, can afford to smile at such a sugges- 
tion. England can show now, as she has been 
able to show in every generation since civilisation 
spread over the West, individual men who hold 
their own against the world, and keep alive the 
old tradition of her intellectual eminence. 
But, in the majority of cases, these men are 
what they are in virtue of their native intellectual 
force, and of a strength of character which will 
not recognise impediments. ‘They are not trained 
in the courts of the Temple of Science, but storm 
the walls of that edifice in all sorts of irregular 
ways, and with much loss of time and power, in 
order to obtain their legitimate positions. 
Our universities not only do not encourage 
such men; do not offer them positions, in which 
it should be their highest duty to do, thoroughly, 
that which they are most capable of doing; but, 
as far as possible, university training shuts out of 
the minds of those among them, who are subjected 
to it, the prospect that there is anything in the 
world for which they are specially fitted. Imagine 
the success of the attempt to still the intellectual 
hunger of any of the men I have mentioned, by 
putting before him, as the object of existence, the 
successful mimicry of the measure of a Greek
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 A LIBERAL EDUCATION ; Iv 
song, or the roll of Ciceronian prose! Imagine 
how much success would be likely to attend the 
attempt to persuade such men that the education 
which leads to perfection in such elegances is alone 
to be called culture; while the facts of history, 
the process of thought, the conditions of moral and 
social existence, and the laws of physical nature 
are left to be dealt with as they may by outside 
barbarians! 
It is not thus that the German universities, 
from being beneath notice a century ago, have 
become what they are now—the most intensely 
cultivated and the most productive intellectual 
corporations the world has ever seen. 
The student who repairs to them sees in the 
list of classes and of professors a fair picture of 
the world of knowledge. Whatever he needs to - 
know there is some one ready to teach him, some 
one competent to discipline him in the way of 
learning; whatever his special bent, let him but 
be able and diligent, and in due time he shall 
find distinction and a career. Among his pro- 
fessors, he sees men whose names are known and 
revered throughout the civilised world; and their 
living example infects him with a noble ambition, 
and a love for the spirit of work. 
The Germans dominate the intellectual world 
by virtue of the same simple secret as that which 
made Napoleon the master of old Europe. They 
have declared la carritre ouverte aux talents, and
-P-A-G-E-115
  v AND WHERE TO FIND IT 107 
every Bursch marches with a professor’s gown in 
his knapsack. Let him become a great scholar, 
or man of science, and ministers will compete for 
his services. In Germany, they do not leave the 
chance of his holding the office he would render 
illustrious to the tender mercies of a hot canvass, 
and the final wisdom of a mob of country 
parsons. 
In short, in Germany, the universities are 
exactly what the Rector of Lincoln and the 
Commissioners tell us the English universities are 
not; that is to say, corporations “of learned men 
devoting their lives to the cultivation of science, 
and the direction of academical education.” 
They are not “ boarding schools for youths,” nor 
clerical seminaries; but institutions for the higher 
culture of men, in which the theological faculty is 
of no more importance or prominence, than the 
rest; and which are truly “ universities,’ since 
they strive to represent and embody the totality 
of human knowledge, and to find room for all 
forms of intellectual activity. 
May zealous and clear-headed reformers like 
Mr. Pattison succeed in their noble endeavours to 
shape our universities towards some such ideal as 
this, without losing what is valuable and distinc- 
tive in their social tone! But until they have 
succeeded, a liberal education will be no more 
obtainable in our Oxford and Cambridge Univer- 
sities than in our public schools.  
-P-A-G-E-116
108 A LIBERAL EDUCATION; Iv 
If I am justified in my conception of the ideal 
of a liberal education; and if what I have said 
about the existing educational institutions of the 
country is also true, it is clear that the two have 
no sort of relation to one another; that the best of 
our schools and the most complete of our uni- 
versity trainings give but a narrow, one-sided, and 
essentially illiberal education—while the worst give 
what is really next to no education at all. The 
South London Working-Men’s College could not 
copy any of these institutions if it would; I am 
bold enough to express the conviction that it ought 
not if it could. 
For what is wanted is the reality and not the 
mere name of a liberal education; and this College 
must steadily set before itself the ambition to be 
able to give that education sooner or later. At 
present we are but beginning, sharpening our 
educational tools, as it were, and, except a 
modicum of physical science, we are not able to 
offer much more than is to be found in an ordinary 
school. 
Moral and social science—one of the greatest 
and most fruitful of our future classes, I hope—at 
present lacks only one thing in our programme, 
and that is a teacher. A considerable want, no 
doubt; but it must be recollected that it is much 
better to want a teacher than to want the desire to 
learn. 
Further, we need what, for want of a better
-P-A-G-E-117
  Vv AND WHERE TO FIND IT 409 
name, I must call Physical Geography. What I 
mean is that which the Germans call “ Hrdkunde.” 
It is a description of the earth, of its place and 
relation to other bodies; of its general structure, 
and of its great features—winds, tides, mountains, 
plains: of the chief forms of the vegetable and 
animal worlds, of the varieties of man. It is 
the peg upon which the greatest quantity of useful 
and entertaining scientific information can be sus- 
pended. 
Literature is not upon the College programme; 
but I hope some day to see it there. For litera- 
ture is the greatest of all sources of refined 
pleasure, and one of the great uses of a liberal 
education is to enable us to enjoy that pleasure. 
There is scope enough for the purposes of liberal 
education in the study of the rich treasures of our 
own language alone. All that is needed is direc- 
tion, and the cultivation of a refined taste by atten- 
tion to sound criticism. But there is no reason 
why French and German should not be mastered 
sufficiently to read what is worth reading in those 
languages with pleasure and with profit. 
And finally, by and by, we must have History; 
treated not as a succession of battles and 
dynasties; not as a series of biographies; not as 
evidence that Providence has always been on the 
side of either Whigs or Tories; but as the develop- 
ment of man in times past, and in other conditions 
than our own.
-P-A-G-E-118

But, as it is one of the principles of our College 
to be self-supporting, the public must lead, and we 
must follow, in these matters. If my hearers take 
to heart what I have said about liberal education, 
they will desire these things, and I doubt not we 
shall be able to supply them. But we must wait 
till the demand is made.

SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: NOTES OF 
AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 
[1869] 
[Mr. Tuackeray, talking of after-dinner speeches, has 
lamented that “one never can recollect the fine things 
one thought of in the cab,” in going to the place of en- 
tertainment. I am not aware that there are any “fine 
things” in the following pages, but such as there are 
stand to a speech which really did get itself spoken, at 
the hospitable table of the Liverpool Philomathic So- 
ciety, more or less in the position of what “one thought 
of in the cab.”] 
Tue introduction of scientific training into the 
general education of the country is a topic upon 
which I could not have spoken, without some more 
or less apologetic introduction, a few years ago. 
But upon this, as upon other matters, public 
opinion has of late undergone a rapid modification. 
Committees of both Houses of the Legislature have 
agreed that something must be done in this direc- 
111
-P-A-G-E-120
  119 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: vy 
tion, and have even thrown out timid and faltering 
suggestions as to what should be done; while at 
the opposite pole of society, committees of working 
men have expressed their conviction that scientific 
training is the one thing needful for their advance- 
ment, whether as men, or as workmen. Only the 
other day, it was my duty to take part in the 
reception of a deputation of London workingmen, 
who desired to learn from Sir Roderick Murchison, 
the Director of the Royal School of Mines, whether 
the organisation of the institution in Jermyn Street 
could be made available for the supply of that 
scientific instruction the need of which could not 
have been apprehended, or stated, more clearly 
than it was by them. 
The heads of colleges in our great universities 
(who have not the reputation of being the most 
mobile of persons) have, in several cases, thought 
it well that, out of the great number of honours 
and rewards at their disposal, a few should here- 
after be given to the cultivators of the physical 
sciences. Nay, I hear that some colleges have even 
gone so far as to appoint one, or, maybe, two special 
tutors for the purpose of putting the facts and 
principles of physical science before the under- 
graduate mind. And I say it with gratitude and 
great respect for those eminent persons, that the 
head masters of our public schools, Eton, Harrow, 
Winchester, have addressed themselves to the 
problem of introducing instruction in physical 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 113 
science among the studies of those great educa- 
tional bodies, with much honesty of purpose and 
enlightenment of understanding; and I live in 
hope that, before long, important changes in this 
direction will be carried into effect in those strong- 
holds of ancient prescription. In fact, such 
changes have already been made, and physical sci- 
ence, even now, constitutes a recognised element of 
the school curriculum in Harrow and Rugby, whilst 
I understand that ample preparations for such 
studies are being made at Eton and elsewhere. 
Looking at these facts, 1 might perhaps spare 
myself the trouble of giving any reasons for the 
introduction of physical science into elementary 
education; yet I cannot but think that it may be 
well if I place before you some considerations 
which, perhaps, have hardly received full atten- 
tion. 
At other times, and in other places, I have 
endeavoured to state the higher and more abstract 
arguments, by which the study of physical science 
may be shown to be indispensable to the complete 
training of the human mind; but I do not wish it 
to be supposed that, because I happen to be 
devoted to more or less abstract and “ unpractical ” 
pursuits, I am insensible to the weight which ought 
to be attached to that which has been said to 
be the English conception of Paradise—namely, 
“getting on.” I look upon it, that.“ getting on” 
is a very important matter indeed. I do not mean 
 
-P-A-G-E-122

merely for the sake of the coarse and tangible 
results of success, but because humanity is so con- 
stituted that a vast number of us would never be 
impelled to those stretches of exertion which make 
us wiser and more capable men, if it were not for 
the absolute necessity of putting on our faculties 
all the strain they will bear, for the purpose of 
“ getting on” in the most practical sense. 
Now the value of a knowledge of physical sci- 
ence as a means of getting on is indubitable. 
There are hardly. any of our trades, except the 
merely huckstering ones, in which some knowledge 
of science may not be directly profitable to the pur- 
suer of that occupation. As industry attains higher 
stages of its development, as its processes become 
more complicated and refined, and competition 
more keen, the sciences are dragged in, one by one, 
to take their share in the fray; and he who can 
best avail himself of their help is the man who will 
come out uppermost in that struggle for existence, 
which goes on as fiercely beneath the smooth sur- 
face of modern society, as among the wild inhab- 
itants of the woods. 
But in addition to the bearing of science on 
ordinary practical life, let me direct your attention 
to its immense influence on several of the profes- 
sions. I ask any one who has adopted the calling 
of an engineer, how much time he lost when he 
left school, because he had to devote himself to 
pursuits which were absolutely novel and strange,
-P-A-G-E-123
vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 115 
and of which he had not obtained the remotest 
conception from his instructors? He had to 
familiarise himself with ideas of the course and 
powers of Nature, to which his attention had never 
been directed during his school-life, and to learn, 
or the first time, what a world of facts lies outside 
and beyond the world of words. I appeal to those 
who know what engineering is, to say how far I am 
right in respect to that profession; but with regard 
o another, of no less importance, I shall ‘venture 
o speak of my own knowledge. There is no one 
of us who may not at any moment be thrown, 
bound hand and foot by physical incapacity, into 
he hands of a medical practitioner. The chances 
of life and death for all and each of us may, at any 
moment, depend on the skill with which that prac- 
itioner is able to make out what is wrong in our 
odily frames, and on his ability to apply the 
roper remedy to the defect. 
The necessities of modern life are such, and the 
class from which the medical profession is chiefly 
recruited is so situated, that few medical men can 
hope to spend more than three or four, or it may 
be five, years in the pursuit of those studies which 
are immediately germane to physic. How is that 
all too brief period spent at present? I speak as an. 
old examiner, having served some eleven or twelve 
years in that capacity in the University of London, 
and therefore having a practical acquaintance with 
the subject; but I might fortify myself by the

authority of the President of the College of Sur- 
geons, Mr. Quain, whom I heard the other day in 
an admirable address (the Hunterian Oration) deal 
fully and wisely with this very topic.* 
A young man commencing the study of medi- 
cine is at once required to endeavour to make an 
acquaintance with a number of sciences, such as 
Physics, as Chemistry, as Botany, as Physiology, 
which are absolutely and entirely strange to him, 
however excellent his so-called education at school 
may have been. Not only is he devoid of all ap- 
prehension of scientific conceptions, not only does 
he fail to attach any meaning to the words “ mat- 
* Mr. Quain’s words (Medical Times and Gazette, Feb- 
ruary 20) are:—“ A few words as to our special Medical 
course of instruction and the influence upon it of such 
changes in the elementary schools as I have mentioned. 
The student now enters at once upon several sciences— 
physics, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, botany, pharmacy, 
therapeutics—all these, the facts and the language and the 
laws of each, to be mastered in eighteen months. Up to 
the beginning of the Medical course many have learned lit- 
tle. We cannot claim anything better than the Examiner 
of the University of London and the Cambridge Lecturer 
have reported for their Universities. Supposing that at 
school young people had acquired some exact elementary 
knowledge in physics, chemistry, and a branch of natural 
history—say botany—with the physiology connected with 
it, they would then have gained necessary knowledge, with 
some practice in inductive reasoning. The whole studies 
are processes of observation and induction—the best dis- 
cipline of the mind for the purposes of life—for our pur- 
poses not less than any. ‘By such study (says Dr. Whewell) 
of one or more departments of inductive science the mind 
may escape from the thraldom of mere words.’ By that 
pee the burden of the early Medical course would be much 
ightened, and more time devoted to practical studies, in- 
cluding Sir Thomas Watson’s ‘final and supreme stage’ of 
the knowledge of Medicine.”

but, worse still, he has no notion of what it is to 
come into contact with Nature, or to lay his mind 
alongside of a physical fact, and try to conquer it, 
in the way our great naval hero told his captains to 
master their enemies. His whole mind has been 
given to books, and I am hardly exaggerating if I 
say that they are more real to him than Nature. 
He imagines that all knowledge can be got out of 
books, and rests upon the authority of some master 
or other; nor does he entertain any misgiving that 
the method of learning which led to proficiency 
in the rules of grammar will suffice to lead him to 
a mastery of the laws of Nature. The youngster, 
thus unprepared for serious study, is turned loose 
among his medical studies, with the result, in nine 
cases out of ten, that the first year of his curricu- 
lum is spent in learning how to learn. Indeed, he 
is lucky if, at the end of the first year, by the 
exertions of his teachers and his own industry, he 
has acquired even that art of arts. After which 
there remain not more than three, or perhaps four, 
years for the profitable study of such vast sciences 
as Anatomy, Physiology, Therapeutics, Medicine, 
Surgery, Obstetrics, and the like, upon his knowl- 
edge or ignorance of which it depends whether the 
practitioner shall-diminish, or increase, the bills of 
mortality. Now what is it but the preposterous 
condition of ordinary school education which pre- 
vents a young man of seventeen, destined for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-126

practice of medicine, from being fully prepared for 
the study of Nature; and from coming to the 
medical school, equipped with that preliminary 
knowledge of the principles of Physics, of Chem- 
istry and of Biology, upon which he has now to 
waste one of the precious years, every moment of 
which ought to be given to those studies which 
bear directly upon the knowledge of his profes- 
sion? 
There is another profession, to the members of 
which, I think, a certain preliminary knowledge of 
physical science might be quite as valuable as to 
the medical man. The practitioner of medicine 
sets before himself the noble object of taking care 
of man’s bodily welfare; but the members of this 
other profession undertake to “ minister to minds 
diseased,” and, so far as may be, to diminish sin 
and soften sorrow. Like the medical profession, 
the clerical, of which I now speak, rests its power 
to heal upon its knowledge of the order of the 
universe—upon certain theories of man’s relation 
to that which lies outside him. It is not my 
business to express any opinion about these’ 
theories. I merely wish to point out that, like all 
other theories, they are professedly based upon 
matters of fact. Thus the clerical profession has to 
deal with the facts of Nature from a certain point 
of view; and hence it comes into contact with that 
of the man of science, who has to treat the same 
facts from another point of view. You know how  
-P-A-G-E-127
  vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 119 
often that contact is to be described as collision, or 
violent friction; and how great the heat, how little 
the light, which commonly results from it. 
In the interests of fair play, to say nothing of 
those of mankind, I ask, Why do not the clergy as 
a body acquire, as a part of their preliminary 
education, some such tincture of physical science 
as will put them in a position to understand the 
difficulties in the way of accepting their theories, 
which are forced upon the mind of every thought- 
ful and intelligent man, who has taken the trouble 
to instruct himself in the elements of natural 
knowledge? 
Some time ago I attended a large meeting of 
the clergy, for the purpose of delivering an address 
which I had been invited to give. I spoke of some 
of the most elementary facts in physical science, 
and of the manner in which they directly contra- 
dict certain of the ordinary teachings of the clergy. 
The result was, that, after I had finished, one 
section of the assembled ecclesiastics attacked me 
with all the intemperance of pious zeal, for stating 
* facts and conclusions which no competent judge 
doubts; while, after the first speakers had subsided, 
amidst the cheers of the great majority of their 
colleagues, the more rational minority rose to tell 
me that I had taken wholly superfluous pains, that 
they already knew all about what I had told them, 
and perfectly agreed with me. A hard-headed 
friend of mine, who was present, put the not un- 
68
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: v 
natural question, “Then why don’t you say so in 
your pulpits?” to which inquiry I heard no 
reply. 
In fact the clergy are at present divisible into 
three sections: an immense body who are ig- 
norant and speak out; a small proportion who 
know and are silent; and a minute minority who 
know and speak according to their knowledge. 
By the clergy, I mean especially the Protestant 
clergy. Our great antagonist—I speak as a man 
of science—the Roman Catholic Church, the one 
great spiritual organisation which is able to resist, 
and must, as a matter of life and death, resist, the 
progress of science and modern civilisation, man- 
ages her affairs much better. 
It was my fortune some time ago to pay a visit 
to one of the most important of the institutions 
in which the clergy of the Roman Catholic 
Church in these islands are trained; and it 
seemed to me that the difference between these 
men and the comfortable champions of Angli- 
canism and of Dissent, was comparable to the 
difference between our gallant Volunteers and the 
trained veterans of Napoleon’s Old Guard. 
The Catholic priest is trained to know his 
business, and do it effectually. The professors of 
the college in question, learned, zealous, and 
determined men, permitted me to speak frankly 
with them. We talked like outposts of opposed 
armies during a truce—as friendly enemies; and
-P-A-G-E-129

vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 1921 
when I ventured to point out the difficulties their 
students would have to encounter from scientific 
thought, they replied: “Our Church has lasted 
many ages, and has passed safely through many 
storms. The present is but a new gust of the 
old tempest, and we do not turn out our young 
men less fitted to weather it, than they have been, 
in former times, to cope with the difficulties of 
those times. The heresies of the day are explained 
to them by their professors of philosophy and sci- 
ence, and they are taught how those heresies are to 
be met.” 
I heartily respect an organisation which faces 
its enemies in this way; and I wish that all 
ecclesiastical organisations were in as effective a 
condition. I think it would be better, not only 
for them, but for us. The army of liberal thought 
is, at present, in very loose order; and many a 
spirited free-thinker makes use of his freedom 
mainly to vent nonsense. We should be the better 
for a vigorous and watchful enemy to hammer us 
into cohesion and discipline; and I, for one, 
lament that the bench of Bishops cannot show a 
man of the calibre of Butler of the “ Analogy,” 
who, if he were alive, would make short work of 
much of the current @ priori “ infidelity.” 
I hope you will consider that the argu- 
ments I have now stated, even if there were no 
better ones, constitute a sufficient apology for
-P-A-G-E-130
    
122 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: v 
urging the introduction of science into schools. 
The next question to which I have to address 
myself is, What sciences ought to be thus taught? 
And this is one of the most important of ques- 
tions, because my side (I am afraid I am a terribly 
candid friend) sometimes spoils its cause by going 
in for too much. There are other forms of culture 
beside physical science; and I should be pro- 
foundly sorry to see the fact forgotten, or even to 
observe a tendency to starve, or cripple, literary, 
or esthetic, culture for the sake of science. Such 
a narrow view of the nature of education has 
nothing to do with my firm conviction that a 
complete and thorough scientific culture ought to 
be introduced into all schools. By this, however, 
I do not mean that every schoolboy should be 
taught everything in science. That would be a 
very absurd thing to conceive, and a very mischie- 
vous thing to attempt. What I mean is, that no 
boy nor girl should leave school without possessing 
a grasp of the general character of science, and 
without having been disciplined, more or less, in 
the methods of all sciences; so that, when turned 
into the world to make their own way, they shall 
be prepared to face scientific problems, not by 
knowing at once the conditions of every problem, 
or by being able at once to solve it; but by being 
familiar with the general current of scientific 
thought, and by being able to apply the methods 
of science in the proper way, when they have  
-P-A-G-E-131
  vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 193 
acquainted themselves with the conditions of the 
special problem. 
That is what I understand by scientific educa- 
tion. To furnish a boy with such an education, 
it is by no means necessary that he should devote 
his whole school existence to physical science: in 
fact, no one would lament so one-sided a proceed- 
ing more than I. Nay more, it is not necessary 
for him to give up more than a moderate share of 
his time to such studies, if they be properly 
selected and arranged, and if he be trained in 
them in a fitting manner. 
I conceive the proper course to be somewhat as 
follows. To begin with, let every child be 
instructed in those general views of the phe- 
nomena of Nature for which we have no exact 
English name. The nearest approximation to a 
name for what I mean, which we possess, is 
“physical geography.” The Germans have a 
better, “Erdkunde” (earth knowledge” or 
“geology” in its etymological sense), that is to 
say, a general knowledge of the earth, and what 
is on it, in it, and about it. \ If any one who has 
had experience of the ways of young children will 
call to mind their questions, he will find that so 
far as they can be put into any scientific category, 
they come under this head of “ Erdkunde.” The 
child asks, “ What is the moon, and why does it 
shine?” “ What is this water, and where does it 
run?” “What is the wind?” “What makes 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
124 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: v 
this wave in the sea?” “Where does this animal 
live, and what is the use of that plant?” And 
if not snubbed and stunted by being told not to 
ask foolish questions, there is no limit to the 
intellectual craving of a young child; nor any 
bounds to the slow, but solid, accretion of knowl- 
edge and development of the thinking faculty in 
this way. To all such questions, answers which 
are necessarily incomplete, though true as far as 
they go, may be given by any teacher whose ideas 
represent real knowledge and not mere book 
learning; and a panoramic view of Nature, 
accompanied by a strong infusion of the scientific 
habit of mind, may thus be placed within the 
reach of every child of nine or ten. 
After this preliminary opening of the eyes to 
the great spectacle of the daily progress of 
Nature, as the reasoning faculties of the child 
grow, and he becomes familiar with the use of the 
tools of knowledge—reading, writing, and ele- 
mentary mathematics—he should pass on to what 
is, in the more strict sense, physical science. Now 
there are two kinds of physical science: the one 
regards form and the relation of forms to one 
another; the other deals with causes and effects. 
In many of what we term sciences, these two 
kinds are mixed up together; but systematic bot- 
any is a pure example of the former kind, and 
physics of the latter kind, of science. Every 
educational advantage which training in physical
-P-A-G-E-133
vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 195 
science can give is obtainable from the proper 
study of these two; and I should be contented, 
for the present, if they, added to our “ Erdkunde,” 
furnished the whole of the scientific curriculum 
of school. Indeed, I conceive it would be one of 
the greatest boons which could be conferred upon 
England, if henceforward every child in the 
country were instructed in the general knowledge 
of the things about it, in the elements of physics, 
and of botany. But I should be still better 
pleased if there could be added somewhat of chem- 
istry, and an elementary acquaintance with human 
physiology. 
So far as school education is concerned, I want 
to go no further just now; and I believe that 
such instruction would make an excellent introduc- 
tion to that preparatory scientific training which, 
as I have indicated, is so essential for the success- 
ful pursuit of our most important professions. 
But this modicum of instruction must be so given 
as to ensure real knowledge and practical disci- 
pline. If scientific education.is to be dealt with 
as mere bookwork, it will be better not to 
attempt it, but to stick to the Latin Grammar 
which makes no pretence to be anything but book- 
work. 
If the great benefits of scientific training are 
sought, it is essential that such training should be 
real: that is to say, that the mind of the scholar 
should be brought into direct relation with fact,
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: v 
that he should not merely be told a thing, but 
made to see by the use of his own intellect and 
ability that the thing is so and no otherwise. 
The great peculiarity of scientific training, that in 
virtue of which it cannot be replaced by any 
other discipline whatsoever, is this bringing of the 
mind directly into contact with fact, and practising 
the intellect in the completest form of induction; 
. that is to say, in drawing conclusions from par- 
ticular facts made known by immediate observa- 
tion of Nature. 
The other studies which enter into ordinary 
education do not discipline the mind in this way. 
Mathematical training is almost purely deductive. 
The mathematician starts with a few simple propo- 
sitions, the proof of which is so obvious that they 
are called self-evident, and the rest of his work 
consists of subtle deductions from them. The 
teaching of languages, at any rate as ordinarily 
practised, is of the same general nature,—author- 
ity and tradition furnish the data, and the mental 
operations of the scholar are deductive. 
Again: if history be the subject of study, the 
facts are still taken upon the evidence of tradition 
and authority. You cannot make a boy see the 
battle of Thermopyle for himself, or know, of his 
own knowledge, that Cormwell once ruled Eng- 
land. There is no getting into direct contact with 
natural fact by this road; there is no dispensing 
with authority, but rather a resting upon it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
  
vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 1927 
In all these respects, science differs from other 
educational discipline, and prepares the scholar for 
common life. What have we to do in every-day 
life? Most of the business which demands our 
attention is matter of act, which needs, in the first 
place, to be accurately observed or apprehended; 
in the second, to be interpreted by inductive and 
deductive reasonings, which are altogether similar 
in their nature to those employed in science. In 
the one case, as in the other, whatever is taken for 
granted is so taken at one’s own peril; fact and 
reason are the ultimate arbiters, and patience and 
honesty are the great helpers out of difficulty. 
But if scientific training is to yield its most 
eminent results, it must, I repeat, be made practi- 
cal. That is to say, in explaining to a child the 
general phenomena of Nature, you must, as far as 
possible, give reality to your teaching by object- 
lessons; in teaching him botany, he must handle 
the plants and dissect the flowers for himself; in 
teaching him physics and chemistry, you must not 
be solicitous to fill him with information, but you 
must be careful that what he learns he knows of 
his own knowledge. Don’t be satisfied with telling 
him that a magnet attracts iron. Let him see 
that it does; let him feel the pull of the one upon 
the other for himself. And, especially, tell him 
that it is his duty to doubt until he is compelled, 
by the absolute authority of Nature, to believe that 
which is written in books. Pursue this discipline
-P-A-G-E-136
128 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: v 
carefully and conscientiously, and you may make 
sure that, however scanty may be the measure of 
information which you have poured into the boy’s 
mind, you have created an intellectual habit of 
priceless value in practical life. 
One is constantly asked, When should this 
scientific education be commenced? I should say 
with the dawn of intelligence. As I have already 
said, a child seeks for information about matters of 
physical science as soon as it begins to talk. The 
first teaching it wants is an object-lesson of one 
sort or another; and as soon as it is fit for syste- 
matic instruction of any kind, it is fit for a modi- 
cum of science. 
People talk of the difficulty of teaching young 
children such matters, and in the same breath 
insist upon their learning their Catechism, which 
contains propositions far harder to comprehend 
than anything in the educational course I have 
proposed. Again: I am incessantly told that we, 
who advocate the introduction of science in 
schools, make no allowance for the stupidity of the 
average boy or girl; but, in my belief, that stupid- 
ity, in nine cases out of ten, “ fit, non nascitur,” 
and is developed by a long process of parental and 
pedagogic repression of the natural intellectual 
appetites, accompanied by a persistent attempt to 
create artificial ones for food which is not only 
tasteless, but essentially indigestible. 
Those who urge the difficulty of instructing
-P-A-G-E-137
  y NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 199 
young people in science are apt to forget another 
very important condition of suecess—important in 
all kinds of teaching, but most essential, I am dis- 
posed to think, when the scholars are very young. 
This condition is, that the teacher should himself 
really and practically know his subject. If he does, 
he will be able to speak of it in the easy language; 
and with the completeness of conviction, with 
which he talks of any ordinary every-day matter. 
If he does not, he will be afraid to wander beyond 
the limits of the technical phraseology which he 
has got up; and a dead dogmatism, which op- 
presses, or raises opposition, will take the place of 
the lively confidence, born of personal conviction, 
which cheers and encourages tlie eminently sym- 
pathetic mind of childhood. 
I have already hinted that such scientific train- 
ing as we seek for may be given without making 
any extravagant claim upon the time now devoted 
to education. We ask only for “a most favoured 
nation ” clause in our treaty with the schoolmas- 
ter; we demand no more than that science shall 
have as much time given to it as any other single 
subject—say four hours a week in each class of an 
ordinary school. 
For the present, I think men of science would 
be well content with such an arrangement as this; 
but speaking for myself, I do not pretend to be- 
lieve that such an arrangement can be, or will be, 
permanent. In these times the educational tree 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
130 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: vy 
_ seems to me to have its roots in the air, its leaves 
and flowers in the ground; and, I confess, I should 
very much like to turn it upside down, so that its 
roots might be solidly embedded among the facts 
of Nature, and draw thence a sound nutriment for 
the foliage and fruit of literature and of art. No 
educational system can have a claim to perma- 
nence, unless it recognises the truth that education 
has two great ends to which everything else must 
be subordinated. The one of these is to increase 
knowledge; the other is to develop the love of 
right and the hatred of wrong. 
With wisdom and uprightness a nation can 
make its way worthily, and beauty will follow in 
the footsteps of the two, even if she be not specially 
invited; while there is perhaps no sight in the 
whole world more saddening and revolting than is 
offered by men sunk in ignorance of everything but 
what other men have written; seemingly devoid of 
moral belief or guidance; but with the sense of 
beauty so keen, and the power of expression so 
cultivated, that their sensual caterwauling may be 
almost mistaken for the music of the spheres. 
At present, education is almost entirely devoted 
to the cultivation of the power of expression, and 
of the sense of literary beauty. The matter of 
having anything to say, beyond a hash of other 
people’s opinions, or of possessing any criterion of 
beauty, so that we may distinguish between the 
Godlike and the devilish, is left aside as of no
-P-A-G-E-139
  vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 131 
moment. I think I do not err in saying that if 
science were made a foundation of education, 
instead of being, at most, stuck on as cornice to 
the edifice, this state of things could not exist. 
In advocating the introduction of physical sci- 
ence as a leading element in education, I by no 
means refer only to the higher schools. On the 
contrary, I believe that such a change is even more 
imperatively called for in those primary schools, 
in which the children of the poor are expected to 
turn to the best account the little time they can de- 
vote to the acquisition of knowledge. A great step 
in this direction has already been made by the 
establishment of science-classes under the Depart- 
ment of Science and Art,—a measure which came 
into existence unnoticed, but which will, I believe, 
turn out to be of more importance to the welfare of 
the people than many political changes over which 
the noise of battle has rent the air. 
Under the regulations to which I refer, a 
schoolmaster can set up a class in one or more 
branches of science; his pupils will be examined, 
and the State will pay him, at a certain rate, for 
all who succeed in passing. I have acted as an 
examiner under this system from the beginning 
of its establishment, and this year I expect to 
have not fewer than a couple of thousand sets of 
answers to questions in Physiology, mainly from 
young people of the artisan class, who have been 
taught in the schools which are now scattered
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION: v 
all over Great Britain and Ireland. Some of my 
colleagues, who have to deal with subjects such as 
Geometry, for which the present teaching power 
is better organised, I understand are likely to 
have three or four times as many papers. So far 
as my own subjects are concerned, I can under- 
take to say that a great deal of the teaching, the 
results of which are before me in these examina- 
tions, is very sound and good; and I think it is 
in the power of the examiners, not only to keep 
up the present standard, but to cause an almost 
unlimited improvement. Now what does this 
mean? It means that by holding out a very 
moderate inducement, the masters of primary 
schools in many parts of the country have been 
led to convert them into little foci of scientific 
instruction; and that they and their pupils have 
contrived to find, or to make, time enough to carry 
out this object with a very considerable degree of 
efficiency. That efficiency will, I doubt not, be 
very much increased as the system becomes known 
and perfected, even with the very limited leisure 
left to masters and teachers on week-days. And 
this leads me to ask, Why should scientific teach- 
ing be limited to week-days? 
Ecclesiastically-minded persons are in the habit 
of calling things they do not like by very hard 
names, and I should not wonder if they brand 
the proposition I am about to make as blasphe- 
mous, and worse. But, not minding this, I venture
-P-A-G-E-141
vy NOTES OF AN AFTER-DINNER SPEECH 133 
to ask, Would there really be anything wrong in 
using part of Sunday for the purpose of instructing 
those who have no other leisure, in a knowledge 
of the phenomena of Nature, and of man’s rela- 
tion to Nature? 
I should like to see a scientific Sunday-school 
in every parish, not for the purpose of superseding 
any existing means of teaching the people the 
things that are for their good, but side by side with 
them. I cannot but think that there is room for 
all of us to work in helping to bridge over the 
great abyss of ignorance which lies at our feet. 
And if any of the ecclesiastical persons to 
whom I have referred object that they find it 
derogatory to the honour of the God whom they 
worship, to awaken the minds of the young to the 
infinite wonder and majesty of the works which 
they proclaim His, and to teach them those laws 
which must needs be His laws, and therefore of 
all things needful for man to know—I can only 
recommend them to be let blood and put on low 
diet. There must be something very wrong going 
on in the instrument of logic if it turns out such 
conclusions from such premises.

SCIENCE AND CULTURE. 
[1880] 
Srx years ago, as some of my present hearers 
may remember, I had the privilege of addressing 
a large assemblage of the inhabitants of this city, 
who had gathered together to do honour to the 
memory of their famous townsman, Joseph 
Priestley; * and, if any satisfaction attaches to 
posthumous glory, we may hope that the names 
of the burnt-out philosopher were then finally 
appeased. 
No man, however, who is endowed with a fair 
share of common sense, and not more than a fair 
share of vanity, will identify either contemporary 
or posthumous fame with the highest good; and 
Priestley’s life leaves no doubt that he, at any 
rate, set a much higher value upon the advance- 
ment of knowledge, and the promotion of that 
* See the first essay in this volume. 
184
-P-A-G-E-143
vr SCIENCE AND CULTURE 135 
freedom of thought which is at once the cause 
and the consequence of intellectual progress. 
Hence I am disposed to think that, if Priestley 
could be amongst us to-day, the occasion of our 
meeting would afford him even greater pleasure 
than the proceedings which celebrated the cen- 
tenary of his chief discovery. The kindly heart 
would be moved, the high sense of social duty 
would be satisfied, by the spectacle of well-earned 
wealth neither squandered in tawdry luxury and 
vainglorious show, nor scattered with the careless 
charity which blesses neither him that gives nor 
him that takes, but expended in the execution of 
a well-considered plan for the aid of present and 
future generations of those who are willing to help 
themselves. 
We shall all be of one mind thus far. But it 
is needful to share Priestley’s keen interest in 
physical science; and to have learned, as he had 
learned, the value of scientific training in fields 
of inquiry apparently far remote from physical 
science; in order to appreciate, as he would have 
“ appreciated, the value of the noble gift which Sir 
Josiah Mason has bestowed upon the inhabitants 
of the Midland district. 
For us children of the nineteenth century, 
however, the establishment of a college under the 
conditions of Sir Josiah Mason’s Trust, has a 
significance apart from any which it could have 
possessed a hundred _years.ago. It appears to be 
Cone 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  
136 SCIENCE AND CULTURE VI 
an indication that we are reaching the crisis of 
the battle, or rather of the long series of battles, 
which have been fought over education in a cam- 
paign which began long before Priestley’s time, 
and will probably not be finished just yet. 
In the last century, the combatants were the 
champions of ancient literature on the one side, 
and those of modern literature on the other; but, 
some thirty years * ago, the contest became com~ 
plicated by the appearance of a third army, ranged 
round the banner of Physical Science. 
I am not aware that any one has authority to 
speak in the name of this new host. For it must 
be admitted to be somewhat of a guerilla force, 
composed largely of irregulars, each of whom 
fights pretty much for his own_hand. But the 
impressions of a full private, who has seen a good 
deal of service in the ranks, respecting the present 
position of affairs and the conditions of a per- 
manent peace, may not be devoid of interest; and 
I do not know that I could make a better use of 
the present opportunity than by laying them 
before you. 
From the time that the first suggestion to intro- 
duce physical science into ordinary education was 
* The advocacy of the introduction of physical science into 
general education by George Combe and others commenced a 
good deal earlier ; but the movement had acquired hardly any 
practical force before the time to which I refer.
-P-A-G-E-145
  vI SCIENCE AND CULTURE 187 
timidly whispered, until now, the advocates of 
scientific education have met with opposition of 
two kinds. On the one hand, they have been 
pooh-poohed by the men of business who pride 
themselves on being the representatives of practi- 
cality; while, on the other hand, they have been 
excommunicated by the classical scholars, in their 
capacity of Levites in charge of the ark of culture 
and monopolists of liberal education. 
The practical men believed that the idol whom 
they worship—rule of thumb—has been the source 
of the past prosperity, and will suffice for the 
future welfare of the arts and manufactures. 
They were of opinion that science is speculative 
rubbish; that theory and practice have nothing 
to do with one another; and that the scientific 
habit of mind is an impediment, rather than an 
aid, in the conduct of ordinary_affairs. 
I have used the past tense in speaking of the 
practical men—for although they were very 
formidable thirty years ago, I am not sure that 
the pure species has not been extirpated. In fact, 
so far as mere argument goes, they have been

of ichor, celestial or otherwise, he is no whit the 
worse. So, if any of these opponents be left, I 
will not waste time in vain repetition of the 
demonstrative evidence of the practical value of 
science; but knowing that a parable will sometimes 
penetrate where syllogisms fail to effect an en- 
trance, I will offer a story for their consideration. 
Once upon a time, a boy, with nothing to de- 
pend upon but his own vigorous nature, was 
thrown into the thick of the struggle for existence 
in the midst of a great manufacturing population. 
He seems to have had a hard fight, inasmuch as, 
y the time he was thirty years of age, his total 
disposable funds amounted to twenty pounds. 
Nevertheless, middle life found him giving proof 
of his comprehension of the practical problems he 
had been roughly called upon to solve, by a career 
of remarkable prosperity. 
Finally, having reached old age with its well- 
earned surroundings of “honour, troops of 
riends,” the hero of my story bethought himself 
of those who were making a like start in life, and 
how he could stretch out a helping hand to them. 
After long and anxious reflection this success- 
‘ul practical man of business could devise nothing 
etter than to provide them with the means of 
obtaining “sound, extensive, and practical scien- 
ific knowledge.” And he devoted a large part 
of his wealth and five years of incessant work to 
this-end. ae

I need not point the moral of a tale which, as 
the solid and spacious fabric of the Scientific Col- 
lege assures us, is no fable, nor can anything 
which I could say intensify the force of this prac- 
tical answer to practical objections. 
We may take it for granted then, that, in the 
opinion of those best qualified to judge, the 
diffusion of thorough scientific education isan 
absolutely essential condition ‘of industrial pro- 
gress; and that the College which has been 
opened to-day will confer an inestimable boon 
upon those whose livelihood is to be gained by 
the practise of the arts and manufactures of the 
district. 
The only question worth discussion is, whether 
the conditions, under which the work of the 
College is to be carried out, are such as to give it 
the best ee chance of ‘achieving permanent 
success. 
Sir Josiah Mason, without doubt most wisely, 
has left very large freedom’ of action to the 
trustees, to whom he proposes ultimately to 
commit the administration of the College, so that 
they may be able to adjust its arrangements in 
accordance with the changing conditions of the 
future. “But, with respect to three points, he has 
laid most explicit injunctions upon both adminis- 
trators and teachers. 
Party politics are forbidden to enter into the   
   
-P-A-G-E-148
    140 SCIENCE AND CULTURE vr 
minds of either, so far as the work of the College 
is concerned; theology is as sternly-banished-from 
its precincts; and finally, it is especially declared 
that the College shall make no provision for 
“mere literary instruetion and education.” 
It does not concern me at present to dwell 
upon the first two injunctions any longer than 
may be needful to express my full conviction of 
their wisdom. But the third prohibition brings 
us face to face with those other opponents of 
scientific education, who are by no means in the 
moribund condition of the practical man, but 
alive, alert, and formidable. 
It is not impossible that we shall hear this 
express exclusion of “literary instruction and 
education” from aCollege which, nevertheless, 
professes to give a high and efficient education, 
sharply criticised. Certainly the time was that 
the Levites of culture would have sounded their 
trumpets against its walls as against an educa- 
tional Jericho. 
How often have we not been told that the 
study of physical science is incompetent to confer 
culture; that it touches none of the higher 
problems of life; and, what is worse, that the 
continual devotion to scientific studies tends to 
generate a narrow and bigoted belief in the 
applicability of scientific methods to the search 
after truth of all kinds? How frequently one has 
reason to observe that no reply to a troublesome
-P-A-G-E-149
vr SCIENCE AND CULTURE 141 
argument tells so well as calling its author a 
“ mere scientific_specialist.” And, as I am afraid 
it is not permissible to speak of this form of 
opposition to scientific education in the past 
tense; may we not expect to be told that this, 
not only omission, but prohibition, of “mere 
literary instruction and education” is a patent 
example of scientific narrow-mindedness? 
I am not acquainted with Sir Josiah Mason’s 
reasons for the action which he has taken; but if, 
as I apprehend is the case, he refers to the 
ordinary classical course of our schools and 
universities by the name of “mere literary in- 
struction and education,’ I venture to offer 
sundry reasons of my own in support of that 
action. 
For I hold very strongly by two convictions— 
The first is, that neither the discipline nor the 
subject-matter of classical education is of such 
direct value to the student of physical science as 
to justify the expenditure of valuable time upon 
either; and the second is, that for the purpose of 
attaining real culture, an exclusively scientific 
education is at least as effectual as an exclusively 
literary education. 
I need hardly point out to you that these 
opinions, especially the latter, are diametrically 
opposed to those of the great majority of educated 
Englishmen, influenced as they are by school and 
university traditions. In their belief, culture is 
a
-P-A-G-E-150

obtainable only by_a_liberal education; and a 
liberal education is synonymous, not merely with 
education and instruction in literature, but in one 
particular form of literature, namely, that of 
Greek and Roman antiquity. They hold that 
the man who has learned Latin and Greek, 
however little, is’ educated; while he who is 
versed in other branches of knowledge, however 
deeply, is a more or less respectable specialist, not 
admissible into the cultured caste. The stamp of 
the educated man, the University degree, is not 
for him. ~

catholicity of sg; 1 acquainted with the generous 
irit, the true sympathy with 
scientific thought, which pervades the writings of 
our chief apost! e of culture to identify him 
with these opinions; and yet one may cull from 
one and another of those epistles to the Philistines, 
which so much delight all who do not answer to

“Europe as being, for intellectual and spiritual 
purposes, one great confederation, bound to a 
joint action and working to a common result; and

uity, and of one another. Special, local, and tem- 
porary advantages: being put out of account, that 
modern nation will in the intellectual and spir- 
itual sphere make most progress, which most 
thoroughly carries out this programme. And 
what is that but saying that we too, all of us, as 
individuals, the more thoroughly we carry it out, 
shall make the more progress? ” * 
We have here to deal with two distinct propo- 
sitions. The first, that a criticism of life is the 
essence of culture; the second, that literature con- 
tains the materials which suffice for the construc- 
tion of such criticism. 
I think that we must all assent to the first 
proposition. For culture certainly means some- 
thing quite different from learning or technical 
skill. It implies the possession of an ideal, and 
the habit of critically estimating the value of 
things by comparison with a theoretic standard. 
Perfect culture should supply a complete theory 
of life, based upon a clear-knowledge alike of its 
possibilities and of its limitations. » 
But we may agree to all this, and yet strongly 
dissent from the assumption that literature alone 
is competent to supply this knowledge. After 
having learnt all that Greek, Roman, and Eastern 
antiquity have thought and said, and all that 
modern literature have to tell us, it is not self- 
evident that we have laid a sufficiently broad      
* Hssays in Criticism, p. 87,
-P-A-G-E-152
144 SCIENCE AND CULTURE VI 
and deep, foundation for that criticism of life, 
which constitutes culture. 
Indeed, to any one acquainted with the scope 
of physical science, it is not at all evident. Con- 
sidering progress only in the “intellectual and 
spiritual sphere,” I find myself wholly unable to 
admit that either nations or individuals will really 
advance, if their common outfit draws nothingfrom 
the stores of physical science. I should say that 
an army, without weapons of precision and with no 
particular base of operations, might more hopefully 
enter upon a campaign on the Rhine, than a man, 
devoid of a knowledge of what physical science has 
done in the last century, upon a criticism of life. 
When a biologist meets with an anomaly, he 
instinctively turns to the study of development to 
clear it up. The rationale of contradictory opin- 
ions may with equal confidence be sought in history. 
It is, happily, no new thing that Englishmen 
should employ their wealth in building and en- 
dowing institutions for educational purposes. 
But, five or six hundred years ago, deeds of foun- 
dation expressed or implied conditions as nearly 
as possible contrary to those which have been 
thought expedient by Sir Josiah Mason. That is 
to say, physical science was practically ignored, 
while a certain literary training was enjoined as 
a means to the acquirement of knowledge which 
was essentially theological.
-P-A-G-E-153
       SCIENCE AND CULTURE 145 
The reason of this singular contradiction be- 
tween the actions of men alike animated by a 
strong and disinterested desire to promote the 
welfare of their fellows, is easily discovered. 
At that time, in fact, if any one desired knowl- 
edge beyond such as could be obtained by his 
own observation, or by common conversation, his 
first necessity was to learn the Latin language, in- 
asmuch as all the higher knowledge of the western 
world was contained in works written in that 
language. Hence, Latin grammar, with logic and 
rhetoric, studied through Latin, were the funda- 
mentals of education. With respect to the sub- 
stance of the knowledge imparted through this 
channel, the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, as 
interpreted and supplemented by the Romish 
Church, were held to contain a complete and in- 
fallibly true body of information. 
Theological dicta were, to the thinkers of those 
days, that which the axioms and definitions of 
Euclid are to the geometers of these. The 
business of the philosophers of the middle ages . 
was to deduce from the data furnished by the 
theologians, conclusions in accordance with 
ecclesiastical decrees. They were allowed the 
high privilege of showing, by logical process, 
how and why that which the Church said 
was true, must be true. And if their demon- 
strations fell short of or exceeded this limit, the 
Church was maternally ready to check their   
     
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 SCIENCE AND CULTURE VI 
aberrations; if need were by the help of the secu- 
lar arm. 
Between the two, our ancestors were furnished 
with a compact and complete criticism of life. 
They were told how the world began and how it 
would end; they learned that all material exist- 
ence was but a base and insignificant blot upon 
the fair face of the spiritual world, and that na- 
ture was, to all intents and purposes, the play- 
ground of the devil; they learned that the earth 
is the centre of the visible universe, and that man 
is the cynosure of things terrestrial, and more es- 
pecially was it inculeated that the course of nature 
had no fixed order, but that it could be, and con- 
stantly was, altered by the agency of innumerable 
spiritual beings, good and bad, according as they 
were moved by the deeds and prayers of men. 
The sum and substance of the whole doctrine was 
to produce the conviction that the only thing re- 
ally worth knowing in this world was how to 
secure that place in a better which, under certain 
conditions, the Church promised. 
Our ancestors had a living belief in this theory 
of life, and acted upon it in their dealings with 
education, as in all other matters. Culture meant 
saintliness—after the fashion of the saints of those 
days; the education that led to it was, of neces- 
sity, theological; and the way to theology lay 
through Latin. 
That the study of nature—further than was 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
    
         VI SCIENCE AND CULTURE 147 
requisite for the satisfaction of everyday wants— 
should have any bearing on human life was far 
from the thoughts of men thus trained. Indeed, 
as nature had been cursed for man’s sake, it was 
an obvious conclusion that those who meddled 
with nature were likely to come into pretty close 
contact with Satan. And, if any born scientific 
investigator followed his instincts, he might safely 
reckon upon earning the reputation, and probably 
upon suffering the fate, of a sorcerer. 
Had the western world been left to itself in 
Chinese isolation, there is no saying how long this 
state of things might have endured. But, happily, 
it was not left to itself. Even earlier than the 
thirteenth century, the development of Moorish 
civilisation in Spain and the great movement of 
the Crusades had introduced the leaven which, 
from that day to this, has never ceased to work. 
At first, through the intermediation of Arabic 
translations, afterwards by the study of the origi- 
nals, the western nations of Europe became ac- 
quainted with the writings of the ancient philoso- 
phers and poets, and, in time, with the whole of 
the vast literature of antiquity. 
Whatever there was of high intellectual as- 
piration or dominant capacity in Italy, France, 
Germany, and England, spent itself for centuries 
in taking possession of the rich inheritance left 
by the dead civilisations of Greece and Rome. 
Marvellously aided by the invention of printing,
-P-A-G-E-156
      
    SCIENCE AND CULTURE vI 
  148 
classical learning spread and flourished. Those 
who possessed it prided themselves on having at- 
tained the highest culture then within the reach 
of mankind. 
And justly. For, saving Dante on his solitary 
pinnacle, there was no figure in modern literature 
at the time of the Renascence to compare with 
the men of antiquity; there was no art to com- 
pete with their sculpture; there was no physical 
science but that which Greece had created. 
Above all, there was no other example of perfect 
intellectual freedom—of the unhesitating accept- 
ance of reason as the sole guide to truth and the 
supreme arbiter of conduct. 
The new learning necessarily soon exerted a 
profound influence upon education. The language 
of the monks and schoolmen seemed little better 
than gibberish to scholars fresh from Virgil and 
Cicero,-and the study of Latin was placed upon a 
new foundation. Moreover, Latin itself ceased to 
afford the sole key to knowledge. The student 
who sought the highest thought of antiquity, 
found only a second-hand reflection of it in Roman 
literature, and turned his face to the full light 
of the Greeks. And after a battle, not altogether 
dissimilar to that which is at present being fought 
over the teaching of physical science, the study 
of Greek was recognised as an essential element 
of all higher education. 
Then the Humanists, as they were called, won
-P-A-G-E-157
VI SCIENCE AND CULTURE 149 
the day; and the great reform which they effected 
was of incalculable service to mankind. But 
the Nemesis of all reformers is finality; and 
the reformers of education, like those of religion, 
fell.into the profound, however common, error of 
mistaking the beginning for the end of the work 
of reformation. 
The representatives of the Humanists, in the 
nineteenth century, take their stand upon classical 
education as the sole avenue to culture, as firmly 
as if we were still in the age of Renascence. Yet, 
surely, the present intellectual relations of the 
modern and the ancient worlds are profoundly 
different from those which obtained three cen- 
turies ago. Leaving aside the existence of a great 
and characteristically modern literature, of mod- 
ern painting, and, especially, of modern music, 
there is one feature of the present state of the civ- 
ilised world which separates it more widely from 
the Renascence, than the Renascence was sepa- 
rated from the middle ages. 
This distinctive character of our own times lies 
in the vast and constantly increasing part which 
is played by natural knowledge. Not only is our 
daily life shaped by it, not only does the pros- 
perity of millions of men depend upon it, but 
our whole theory of life has long been influenced, 
consciously or unconsciously, by the general con- 
ceptions of the universe, which have been forced 
upon us by physical science.
-P-A-G-E-158

In fact, the most elementary acquaintance with 
the results of scientific investigation shows us that 
they offer a broad and striking contradiction to 
the opinion so implicitly credited and taught in 
the middle ages.

expression of a d more certain that nature is the

interferes, and that the chief business of mankind 
is to learn that order and govern themselves ac- 
cordingly. Moreover this scientific “criticism of 
life” presents itself to us with different creden- 
tials from any other. It appeals not to authority, 
nor to what any body may have thought or said, 
but to nature. It admits that all our interpreta- 
tions of natura

not among words but among things. It warns us 
that the assertion which outstrips evidence is not 
only a blunder but a crime.

the representatives of the Humanists in our day, 
gives no inkling

an Erasmus, and know no more 
of the chief causes of the present intellectual

pious persons, worthy of all respect, favour us 
with allocutions upon the sadness of the antago- 
nism of science to their medieval way of thinking, 
which betray an ignorance of the first principles 
of scientific investigation, an incapacity for under- 
standing what a man of science means by veracity, 
and an unconsciousness of the weight of estab- 
lished scientific truths, which is almost comical. 
There is no great force in the tu quoque argu- 
ment, or else the advocates of scientific education 
might fairly enough retort upon the modern 
Humanists that they may be learned specialists, 
but that they possess no such sound foundation 
for a criticism of life as deserves the name of 
culture. And, indeed, if we were disposed to be 
cruel, we might urge that the Humanists have 
brought this reproach upon themselves, not be- 
cause they are too full of the spirit of the an- 
cient Greek, but because they lack it. 
The period of the Renascence is commonly 
called that of the “ Revival of Letters,” as if the 
influences then brought to bear upon the mind of 
Western Europe had been wholly exhausted in 
the field of literature. I think it is very 
commonly forgotten that the revival of science, 
effected by the same agency, although less con- 
spicuous, was not less momentous. 
In fact, the few and scattered students of 
nature of that day picked up the clue to her 
secrets exactly as it fell from the hands of the 
70 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 SCIENCE AND CULTURE VI 
Greeks a thousand years before. The foundations 
of mathematics were so well laid by them, that 
our children learn their geometry from a book 
written for the schools of. Alexandria twe thou- 
sand years ago. Modern astronomy is the natural 
continuation and development of the work of 
Hipparchus and of Ptolemy; modern physics of 
that of Democritus and of Archimedes; it was 
long before modern biological science outgrew 
the knowledge bequeathed to us by Aristotle, by 
Theophrastus, and by Galen” 
We cannot know all the best thoughts and 
sayings of the Greeks unless we know what they 
thought about natural phenomena. We cannot 
fully apprehend their criticism of life unless we 
understand the extent to which that criticism was 
affected by scientific conceptions. We falsely pre- 
tend to be the inheritors of their culture, unless 
we are penetrated, as the best minds among them 
were, with an unhesitating faith that the free em- 
ployment of reason, in accordance with scientific 
method, is the sole method of reaching truth. 
Thus I venture to think that the pretensions of 
our modern Humanists to the possession of the 
monopoly of culture and to the exclusive inherit- 
ance of the spirit of antiquity must be abated, if 
not abandoned. But I should be very sorry that 
anything I have said should be taken to imply a 
desire on my part to depreciate the value of 
classical education, as it might be and as it some-
-P-A-G-E-161
     vr SCIENCE AND CULTURE 153 
times is. The native capacities of mankind vary 
no less than their opportunities; and while culture 
is one, the road by which one man may best 
reach it is widely different from that which is 
most advantageous to another. Again, while 
scientific education is yet inchoate and tentative, 
classical education is thoroughly well organised 
upon the practical experience of generations of 
teachers. So that, given ample time for learning 
and estimation for ordinary life, or for a literary 
career, I do not think that a young Englishman 
in search of culture can do better than follow the 
course usually marked out for him, supplementing 
its deficiencies by his own efforts. 
But for those who mean to make science their 
serious occupation; or who intend to follow the 
profession of medicine; or who have to enter early 
upon the business of life; for all these, in my 
opinion, classical education is a mistake; and it is 
for this reason that I am glad to see “mere 
literary education and instruction” shut out from 
the curriculum of Sir Josiah Mason’s College, 
seeing that its inclusion would probably lead to 
the introduction of the ordinary smattering of 
Latin and Greek. “ 
Nevertheless, I am the last person to question 
the importance of genuine literary education, or 
to suppose that intellectual culture can be com- 
plete without it. An exclusively scientific training 
will bring about a mental twist as surely as an     
  
-P-A-G-E-162
    
    
SCIENCE AND CULTURE vI 
  154 
exclusively literary training. The value of the 
cargo does not compensate for a ship’s being out 
of trim; and I should be very sorry to think that 
the Scientific College would turn out none but 
lop-sided men. 
There is no need, however, that such a catas- 
trophe shguld happen. Instruction in English, 
French, and German is provided, and thus the 
three greatest literatures of the modern world are 
made accessible to the student. 
French and German, and especially the latter 
language, are absolutely indispensable to those 
who desire full knowledge in any department of 
science. But even supposing that the knowledge 
of these languages acquired is not more than 
sufficient for purely scientific purposes, every 
Englishman has, in his native tongue, an almost 
perfect instrument of literary expression; and, in 
his own literature, models of every kind of literary 
excellence. If an Englishman cannot. get literary 
culture out of his Bible, his Shakespeare, his 
Milton, neither, in my belief, will the profoundest 
study of Homer and Sophocles, Virgil and Horace, 
give it to him. 
Thus, since the constitution of the College 
makes sufficient provision for literary as well as 
for scientific education, and since artistic instruc- 
tion is also contemplated, it seems to me that a 
fairly complete culture is offered to all who are 
willing to take advantage of it.   
-P-A-G-E-163
  vr SCIENCE AND CULTURE 155 
But I am not sure that at this point the “ prac- 
tical” man, scotched but not slain, may ask what 
all this talk about culture has to do with an 
Institution, the object of which is defined to be 
“to promote the prosperity of the manufactures 
and the industry of the country.” He may sug- 
gest that what is wanted for this end is not culture, 
nor even a purely scientific discipline, but simply 
a knowledge of applied science. 
I often wish that this phrase, “applied sci- 
ence,” had_never been invented. For it suggests 
that there is a sort of scientific knowledge of direct 
practical use, which can be studied apart from 
another sort of scientific knowledge, which is of 
no practical utility, and which is termed “ pure 
science.” But there is no more complete fallacy 
than this. What people call applied science is 
nothing but the application of pure science to par- 
ticular classes of problems. It consists of deduc- 
tions from those general principles, established by 
reasoning and observation, which constitute pure 
science. No one can safely make these deductions 
until he has a firm grasp of the principles; and he 
can obtain that grasp only by personal experience 
of the operations of observation and of reasoning 
on which they are founded. 
Almost all the processes employed in the arts 
and manufactures fall within the range either of 
physics or of chemistry. In order to improve 
them, one must thoroughly understand them; and
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 SCIENCE AND CULTURE VI 
no one has a chance of really understanding them, 
unless he has obtained that mastery of principles 
and that habit of dealing with facts, which is given 
by long-continued and well-directed purely scien- 
tific training in the physical and the chemical 
laboratory. So that there really is no question as 
to the necessity of purely scientific discipline, even 
if the work of the College were limited by the nar- 
rowest interpretation of its stated aims. 
And, as to the desirableness of a wider culture 
than that yielded by science alone, it is to be recol- 
lected that the improvement of manufacturing 
processes is only one of the conditions which con- 
tribute to the prosperity of industry. Industry is 
a means and not an end; and mankind work only 
to get something which they want. What that 
something is depends partly on their innate, and 
partly on their acquired, desires. 
If the wealth resulting from prosperous indus- 
try is to be spent upon the gratification of unwor- 
thy desires, if the increasing perfection of manu- 
facturing processes is to be accompanied by an in- 
creasing debasement of those who carry them on, I 
do not see the good of industry and prosperity. 
Now it is perfectly true that men’s views of 
what is desirable depend upon their characters; 
and that the innate proclivities to which we give 
that name are not touched by any amount of in- 
struction. But it does not follow that even mere 
intellectual education may not, to an indefinite
-P-A-G-E-165
  VI SCIENCE AND CULTURE 157 
extent, modify the practical manifestation of the 
characters of men in their actions, by supplying 
them with motives unknown to the ignorant. A 
pleasure-loving character will have pleasure of 
some sort; but, if you give him the choice, he may 
prefer pleasures which do not degrade him to those 
which do. And this choice is offered to every man, 
who possesses in literary or artistic culture a never- 
failing source of pleasures, which are neither 
withered by age, nor staled by custom, nor 
embittered in the recollection by the pangs of 
self-reproach. 
If the Institution opened to-day fulfils the 
intention of its founder, the picked intelligences 
among all classes of the population of this district 
will pass through it. No child born in Birming- 
ham, henceforward, if he have the capacity to 
profit by the opportunities offered to him, first in 
the primary and other schools, and afterwards in 
the Scientific College, need fail to obtain, not mere- 
ly the instruction, but the culture most appropri- 
ate to the conditions of his life. 
Within these walls, the future employer and 
the future artisan may sojourn together for a 
while, and carry, through all their lives, the stamp 
of the influences then brought to bear upon them. 
Hence, it is not beside the mark to remind you, 
that the prosperity of industry depends not merely 
upon the improvement of manufacturing pro- 
cesses, not merely upon the ennobling of the indi-

vidual character, but upon a third condition, 
namely, a clear understanding of the conditions of 
social life, on the part of both the capitalist and 
the operative, and their agreement upon common 
principles of social action. They must learn that 
social phenomena are as much the expression of 
natural laws as any others; that no social arrange- 
ments can be permanent unless they harmonise 
with the requirements of social statics and dynam- 
ics; and that, in the nature of things, there is an 
arbiter whose decisions execute themselves. 
But this knowledge is only to be obtained by 
the application of the methods of investigation 
adopted in physical researches to the investigation 
of the phenomena of society. Hence, I confess, I 
should like to see one addition made to the excel- 
lent scheme of education propounded for the Col- 
lege, in the shape of provision for the teaching of 
Sociology. For though we are all agreed that 
party politics are to have no place in the instruc- 
tion of the College; yet in this country, practically 
governed as it is now by universal suffrage, every 
man who does his duty must exercise political 
functions. And, if the evils which are inseparable 
from the good of political liberty are to be checked, 
if the perpetual oscillation of nations between 
anarchy and despotism is to be replaced by the 
steady march of self-restraining freedom; it will 
be because men will gradually bring themselves to 
deal with political, as they now deal with scientific
-P-A-G-E-167
  vI SCIENCE AND CULTURE 159 
questions; to be as ashamed of undue haste and 
partisan prejudice in the one case as in the other; 
and to believe that the machinery of society is at 
least as delicate as that of a spinning-jenny, and as 
little likely to be improved by the meddling of 
those who have not taken the trouble to master the 
principles of its action. 
In conclusion, I am sure that I make myself the 
mouthpiece of all present in offering to the vener- 
able founder of the Institution, which now com- 
mences its beneficent career, our congratulations 
on the completion of his work; and in expressing 
the conviction, that the remotest posterity will 
point to it as a crucial instance of the wisdom 
which natural piety leads all men to ascribe to 
their ancestors.

  VII 
ON SCIENCE AND ART IN RELATION 
TO EDUCATION 
[1882] 
WHEN a man is honoured by such a request as 
that which reached me from the authorities of 
your institution some time ago, I think the first 
thing that occurs to him is that which occurred to 
those who were bidden to the feast in the Gospel 
—to begin to make an excuse; and probably all 
the excuses suggested on that famous occasion 
crop up in his mind one after the other, including 
his “having married a wife,” as reasons for not 
doing what he is asked to do. But, in my own 
case, and on this particular occasion, there were 
other difficulties of a sort peculiar to the time, and 
more or less personal to myself; because I felt 
that, if I came amongst you, I should be expected, 
and, indeed, morally compelled, to speak upon the 
subject of Scientific Education. And then there 
160
-P-A-G-E-169
  va SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 161 
arose in my mind the recollection of a fact, which 
probably no one here but myself remembers; 
namely, that some fourteen years ago I was the 
guest of a citizen of yours, who bears the honoured 
name of Rathbone, at a very charming and 
pleasant dinner given by the Philomathic Society; 
and I there and then, and in this very city, made 
a speech upon the topic of Scientific Education. 
Under these circumstances, you see, one runs two 
dangers—the first, of repeating one’s self, although 
I may fairly hope that everybody has forgotten the 
fact I have just now mentioned, except myself; 
and the second, and even greater difficulty, is the 
danger of saying something different from what 
one said before, because then, however forgotten 
your previous speech may be, somebody finds out 
its existence, and there goes on that process so 
hateful to members of Parliament, which may be 
denoted by the term “ Hansardisation.” Under 
these circumstances, I came to the conclusion that 
the best thing I could do was to take the bull by 
the horns, and to “ Hansardise” myself,—to put 
before you, in the briefest possible way, the three 
or four propositions which I endeavoured to 
support on the occasion of the speech to which I 
have referred; and then to ask myself, supposing 
you were asking me, whether I had anything to 
retract, or to modify, in them, in virtue of the 
increased experience, and, let us charitably hope, 
the increased wisdom of an added fourteen years. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vn 
Now, the points to which I directed particular 
attention on that occasion were these: in the first 
place, that instruction in physical science supplies 
information of a character of especial value, both 
in a practical and a speculative point of view— 
information which cannot be obtained otherwise; 
and, in the second place, that, as educational dis- 
cipline, it supplies, in a better form than any other 
study can supply, exercise in a special form of 
logic, and a peculiar method of testing the validity 
of our processes of inquiry. I said further, that, 
even at that time, a great and increasing attention 
was being paid to physical science in our schools 
and colleges, and that, most assuredly, such 
attention must go on growing and increasing, un- 
til education in these matters occupied a very much 
larger share of the time which is given to teaching 
and training, than had been the case heretofore. 
And I threw all the strength of argumentation of 
which I was possessed into the support of these 
propositions. But I venture to remind you, also, 
of some other words I used at that time, and which 
Task permission to read to you. They were these: 
“There are other forms of culture besides physi- 
cal science, and I should be profoundly sorry to see 
the fact forgotten, or even to observe a tendency 
to starve or cripple literary or esthetic culture for 
the sake of science. Such a narrow view of the 
nature of education has nothing to do with my 
firm conclusion that a complete and thorough
-P-A-G-E-171
vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 163 
scientific culture ought to be introduced into all 
schools.” 
I say I desire, in commenting upon these vari- 
ous points, and judging them as fairly as I can by 
the light of increased experience, to particularly 
emphasise this last, because I am told, although I 
assuredly do not know it of my own knowledge 
—though I think if the fact were so I ought to 
know it, being tolerably well acquainted with that 
which goes on in the scientific world, and which 
has gone on there for the last thirty years—that 
there is a kind of sect, or horde, of scientific Goths 
and Vandals, who think it would be proper and 
desirable to sweep away all other forms of culture 
and instruction, except those in physical science, 
and to make them the universal and exclusive, or, 
at any rate, the dominant training of the human 
mind of the future generation. This is not my 
view—I do not believe that it is anybody’s view, 
—but it is attributed to those who, like myself, 
advocate scientific education. I therefore dwell 
strongly upon the point, and I beg you to believe 
that the words I have just now read were by 
no means intended by me as a sop to the Cerbe- 
rus of culture. I have not been in the habit of 
offering sops to any kind of Cerberus; but it 
was an expression of profound conviction on 
my own part—a conviction forced upon me 
not only by my mental constitution, but by the 
lessons of what is now becoming a some-
-P-A-G-E-172
  164 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION va 
what long experience of varied conditions of 
life. 
Iam not about to trouble you with my auto- 
biography; the omens are hardly favourable, at 
present, for work of that kind. But I should like 
if I may do so without appearing, what I earnestly 
desire not to be, egotistical,—I should like to make 
it clear to you, that such notions as these, which 
are sometimes attributed to me, are, as I have said, 
inconsistent with my mental constitution, and still 
more inconsistent with the upshot of the teaching 
of my experience. For I can certainly claim for 
myself that sort: of mental temperament which can 
say that nothing human comes amiss to it. I 
have never yet met with any branch of human 
knowledge which I have found unattractive 
which it would not have been pleasant to me to 
follow, so far as I could go; and I have yet to 
meet with any form of art in which it has not 
been possible for me to take as acute a pleasure 
as, I believe, it is possible for men to take. 
And with respect to the circumstances of life, it 
so happens that it has been my fate to know many 
lands and many climates, and to be familiar, by 
personal experience, with almost every form of 
society, from the uncivilised savage of Papua 
and Australia and the civilised savages of the 
slums and dens of the poverty-stricken parts of 
great cities, to those who perhaps, are occasionally 
the somewhat over-civilised members of our  
-P-A-G-E-173
  va SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 165 
upper ten thousand. And I have never found, in 
any of these conditions of life, a deficiency of 
something which was attractive. Savagery has its 
pleasures, I assure you, as well as civilisation, 
and I may even venture to confess—if you will 
not let a whisper of the matter get back to 
London, where I am known—I am even fain to 
confess, that sometimes in the din and throng of 
what is called “a brilliant reception” the vision 
crosses my mind of waking up from the soft plank 
which had afforded me satisfactory sleep during 
the hours of the night, in the bright dawn of a 
tropical morning, when my comrades were yet 
asleep, when every sound was hushed, except the 
little lap-lap of the ripples against the sides of the 
boat, and the distant twitter of the sea-bird on the 
reef. And when that vision crosses my mind, I 
am free to confess I desire to be back in the boat 
again. So that, if I share with those strange 
persons to whose asserted, but still hypothetical 
existence I have referred, the want of appreciation 
of forms of culture other than the pursuit of physi- 
cal science, all I can say is, that it is, in spite of my 
constitution, and in spite of my experience, that 
such should be my fate. 
But now let me turn to another point, or rather 
to two other points, with which I propose to 
occupy myself. How far does the experience of 
the last fourteen years justify the estimate which 
I ventured to put forward of the value of scientific 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vir 
culture, and of the share—the increasing share— 
which it must take in ordinary education? Hap- 
pily, in respect to that matter, you need not rely 
upon my testimony. In the last half-dozen num- 
bers of the “Journal of Education,” you will find 
a series of very interesting and remarkable papers, 
by gentlemen who are practically engaged in the 
business of education in our great public and other 
schools, telling us what is doing in these schools, 
and what is their experience of the results of 
scientific education there, so far as it has gone. 
I am not going to trouble you with an abstract of 
those papers which are well worth your study in 
their fulness and completeness, but I have copied 
out one remarkable passage, because it seems to me 
so entirely to bear out what I have formerly 
ventured to say about the value of science, both as 
to its subject-matter and as to the discipline which 
the learning of science involves. It is from a 
paper by Mr. Worthington—one of the masters at 
Clifton, the reputation of which school you know 
well, and at the head of which is an old friend of 
mine, the Rev. Mr. Wilson—to whom much credit 
is due for being one of the first, as I can say from 
my own knowledge, to take up this question and 
work it into practical shape. What Mr. Worthing- 
ton says is this:— 
“Tt is not easy to exaggerate the importance of theinforma- 
tion imparted by certain branches of science; it modifies the 
whole criticism of life made in maturer years, The study has
-P-A-G-E-175
  yi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 167 
often, ona mass of boys, acertain influence which, I think, was 
hardly anticipated, and to which a good deal of value must be 
attached—an influence as much moralas intellectual, which is 
shown in the increased and increasing respect for precision of 
statement, and for that form of veracity which consists in the 
acknowledgment of difficulties. It produces a real effect to 
find that Nature cannot be imposed upon, and the attention 
given to experimental lectures, at first superficial and curi- 
ous only, soon becomes minute, serious, and practical.” 
Ladies and gentlemen, I could not have chosen 
better words to express—in fact, I have, in other 
words, expressed the same conviction in former 
days—what the influence of scientific teaching, if 
properly carried out, must be. 
But now comes the question of properly carry- 
ing it out, because, when I hear the value of school 
teaching in physical science disputed, my first im- 
pulse is to ask the disputer, “ What have you 
known about it?” and he generally tells me some 
lamentable case of failure. Then I ask, “ What 
are the circumstances of the case, and how was 
the teaching carried out?” I remember, some 
few years ago, hearing of the head master of a 
large school, who had expressed great dissatisfac- 
tion with the adoption of the teaching of physical 
science—and that after experiment. But the ex- 
periment consisted in this—in asking one of the 
junior masters in the school to get up science, in 
order to teach it; and the young gentleman went 
away for a year and got up science and taught it. 
Well, I have no doubt that the result was as disap- 
tL 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vu 
pointing as the head-master said it was, and I have 
no doubt that it ought to have been as disappoint- 
ing, and far more disappointing too; for, if this 
kind of instruction is to be of any good at all, if it 
is not to be less than no good, if it is to take the’ 
place of that which is already of some good, then 
there are several points which must be attended to. 
And the first of these is the proper selection, of 
topics, the second is practical teaching, the third is 
practical teachers, and the fourth is sufficiency of 
time. If these four points are not carefully at- 
tended to by anybody who undertakes the teaching 
of physical science in schools, my advice to him is, 
to let it alone. I will not dwell at any length 
upon the first point, because there is a general 
consensus of opinion as to the nature of the topics 
which should be chosen. The second point— 
practical teaching—is one of great importance, 
because it requires more capital to set it agoing, 
demands more time, and, last, but by no means 
least, it requires much more personal exertion and 
trouble on the part of those professing to teach, 
than is the case with other kinds of instruction. 
When I accepted the invitation to be here this 
evening, your secretary was good enough to send 
me the addresses which have been given by dis- 
tinguished persons who have previously occupied 
this chair. I don’t know whether he had a 
malicious desire to alarm me; but, however that 
may be, I read the addresses, and derived the
-P-A-G-E-177
  vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 169 
greatest pleasure and profit from some of them, 
and from none more than from the one given by 
the great historian, Mr. Freeman, which delighted 
me most of all; and, if I had not been ashamed of 
plagiarising, and if I had not been sure of being 
found out, I should have been glad to have copied 
very much of what Mr. Freeman said, simply 
putting in the word science for history. There 
was one notable passage,—“ The difference be- 
tween good and bad teaching mainly consists in 
this, whether the words used are really clothed 
with a meaning or not.” And Mr. Freeman gives 
a remarkable example of this. He says, when a 
little girl was asked where Turkey was, she an- 
swered that it was in the yard with the other 
fowls, and that showed she had a definite idea 
connected with the word Turkey, and was, so far, 
worthy of praise. I quite agree with that com- 
mendation; but what a curious thing it is that 
one should now find it necessary to urge that this 
is the be-all and end-all of scientific instruction— 
the sine qué non, the absolutely necessary condi- 
tion,—and yet that it was insisted upon more than 
two hundred years ago by one of the greatest 
men science ever possessed in this country, William 
Harvey. Harvey wrote, or at least published, 
only two small books, one of which is the well- 
known treatise on the circulation of the blood. 
The other, the “ Exercitationes de Generatione,” 
is less known, but not less remarkable. And not   
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vu 
the least valuable part of it is the preface, in 
which there occurs this passage: “Those who, 
reading the words of authors, do not form sensible 
images of the things referred to, obtain no true 
ideas, but conceive false imaginations and inane 
phantasms.” You see, William Harvey’s words 
are just the same in substance as those of Mr. 
Freeman, only they happen to be rather more 
than two centuries older. So that what I am now 
saying has its application elsewhere than in sci- 
ence; but assuredly in science the condition of 
knowing, of your own knowledge, things which 
you talk about, is absolutely imperative. 
I remember, in my youth, there were detest- 
able books which ought to have been burned by 
the hands of the common hangman, for they con- 
tained questions and answers to be learned by 
heart, of this sort, “ What is a horse? The horse 
is termed Hquus caballus; belongs to the class 
Mammalia; order, Pachydermata; family, Soli- 
dungula.” Was any human being wiser for learn- 
ing that magic formula? Was he not more fool- 
ish, inasmuch as he was deluded into taking words 
for knowledge? It is that kind of teaching that 
one wants to get rid of, and banished out of sci- 
ence. Make it as little as you like, but, unless that 
which is taught is based on actual observation and 
familiarity with facts, it is better left alone. 
There are a great many people who imagine 
that elementary teaching might be. properly carried
-P-A-G-E-179
vit SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 171 
out by teachers provided with only elementary 
knowledge. Let me assure you that that is the 
profoundest mistake in the world. There is noth- 
ing so difficult to do as to write a good elementary 
book, and there is nobody so hard to teach proper- 
ly and well as people who know nothing about a 
subject, and I will tell you why. If I address an 
audience of persons who are occupied in the same 
line of work as myself, I can assume that they 
know a vast deal, and that they can find out the 
blunders I make. If they don’t it is their fault 
and not mine; but when I appear before a body of 
people who know nothing about the matter, who 
take for gospel whatever I say, surely it becomes 
needful that I consider what I say, make sure that 
it will bear examination, and that I do not impose 
upon the credulity of those who have faith in me. 
In the second place, it involves that difficult pro- 
cess of knowing what you know so well that you 
can talk about it as you can talk about your ordi- 
nary business. A man can always talk about his 
own business. He can always make it plain; but, if 
his knowledge is hearsay, he is afraid to go beyond 
what he has recollected, and put it before those 
that are ignorant in such a shape that they shall 
comprehend it. That is why, to be a good elemen- 
tary teacher, to teach the elements of any subject, 
requires most careful consideration, if you are a 
master of the subject; and, if you are not a master 
of it, it is needful you should familiarise yourself
-P-A-G-E-180
172 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vu 
with so much as you are called upon to teach— 
soak yourself in it, so to speak—auntil you know it 
as part of your daily life and daily knowledge, and 
then you will be able to teach anybody. That is 
what I mean by practical teachers, and, although 
the deficiency of such teachers is being remedied 
to a large extent, I think it is one which has long 
existed, and which has existed from no fault of 
those who undertook to teach, but because, until 
the last score of years, it absolutely was not possible 
for any one in a great many branches of science, 
whatever his desire might be, to get instruction 
which would enable him to be a good teacher of ele- 
mentary things. All that is being rapidly altered, 
and I hope it will soon become a thing of the past. 
The last point I have referred to is the ques- 
tion of the sufficiency of time. And here comes 
the rub. The teaching of science needs time, as 
any other subject; but it needs more time propor- 
tionally than other subjects, for the amount of 
work obviously done, if the teaching is to be, as I 
have said, practical. Work done in a laboratory 
involves a good deal of expenditure of time with- 
out always an obvious result, because we do not 
see anything of that quiet process of soaking the 
facts into the mind, which takes place through the 
organs of the senses. On this ground there must 
. be ample time given to science teaching. What 
‘that amount of time should be is a point which I 
need not discuss now; in fact, it is a point which 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 173 
cannot be settled until one has made up one’s 
mind about various other questions. 
All, then, that I have to ask for, on behalf of 
the scientific people, if I may venture to speak 
for more than myself, is that you should put 
' scientific teaching into what statesmen call the 
condition of “the most favoured nation”; that is 
to say, that it shall have as large a share of the 
time given to education as any other principal 
subject. You may say that that is a very vague 
statement, because the value of the allotment of 
time, under those circumstances, depends upon the 
number of principal subjects. It is x the time, 
and an unknown quantity of principal subjects 
dividing that, and science taking shares with the 
rest. That shows that we cannot deal with this 
question fully until we have made up our minds 
as to what the principal subjects of education 
ought to be. 
I know quite well that launching myself into 
this discussion is a very dangerous operation; that 
it is a very large subject, and one which is difficult 
to deal with, however much I may trespass upon 
your patience in the time allotted to me. But the 
discussion is so fundamental, it is so completely 
impossible to make up one’s mind on these mat- 
ters until one has settled the question, that I 
will even venture to make the experiment. A great 
lawyer-statesman and philosopher of a former age 
—TI mean Francis Bacon—said that truth came out 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
174 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION. vir 
of error much more rapidly than it came out of 
confusion. There is a wonderful truth in that say- 
ing. Next to being right in this world, the best of 
all things is to be clearly and definitely wrong, be- 
cause you will come out somewhere. If you go 
buzzing about between right and wrong, vibrating 
and fluctuating, you come out nowhere; but if you 
are absolutely and thoroughly and _ persistently 
wrong, you must, some of these days, have the ex- 
treme good fortune of knocking your head against 
a fact, and that sets you all straight again. So I 
will not trouble myself as to whether I may be 
right or wrong in what I am about to say, but at 
any rate I hope to be clear and definite; and then 
you will be able to judge for yourselves whether, 
in following out the train of thought I have to in- 
troduce, you knock your heads against facts or not. 
I take it that the whole object of education is, 
in the first place, to train the faculties of the young 
in such a manner as to give their possessors the 
best chance of being happy and useful in their 
generation; and, in the second place, to furnish 
them with the most important portions of that 
immense capitalised experience of the human race 
which we call knowledge of various kinds. I am 
using the term knowledge in its widest possible 
sense; and the question is, what subjects to select 
by training and discipline, in which the object I 
have just defined may be best attained. 
I must call your attention further to this fact, 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  va SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 175 
that all the subjects of our thoughts—all feelings 
and propositions (leaving aside our sensations as 
the mere materials and occasions of thinking and 
feeling), all our mental furniture—may be classi- 
fied under one of two heads—as either within the 
province of the intellect, something that can be 
put into propositions and affirmed or denied; or 
as within the province of feeling, or that which, 
before the name was defiled, was called the 
esthetic side of our nature, and which can 
neither be proved nor disproved, but only felt and 
known. 
According to the classification which I have 
put before you, then, the subjects of all knowl- 
edge are divisible into the two groups, matters of 
science and matters of art; for all things with 
which the reasoning faculty alone is occupied, 
come under the province of science; and in the 
broadest sense, and not in the narrow and tech- 
nical sense in which we are now accustomed to 
use the word art, all things feelable, all things 
which stir our emotions, come under the term of 
art, in the sense of the subject-matter of the es- 
thetic faculty. So that we are shut up to this 
—that the business of education is, in the first 
place, to provide the young with the means and 
the habit of observation; and, secondly, to supply 
the subject-matter of knowledge either in the 
shape of science or of art, or of both combined. 
Now, it is a very remarkable fact—but it is
-P-A-G-E-184
    176 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vu 
true of most things in this world—that there is 
hardly anything one-sided, or of one nature; and 
it is not immediately obvious what of the things 
that interest us may be regarded as pure science, 
and what may be regarded as pure art. It may 
be that there are some peculiarly constituted per- 
sons who, before they have advanced far into the 
depths of geometry, find artistic beauty about it; 
but, taking the generality of mankind, I think 
it may be said that, when they begin to learn 
mathematics, their whole souls are absorbed in 
tracing the connection between the premisses and 
the conclusion, and that to them geometry is pure 
science. So I think it may be said that mechanics 
and osteology are pure science. On the other 
hand, melody in music is pure art. You cannot 
reason about it; there is no proposition involved 
init. So, again, in the pictorial art, an arabesque, 
or a “harmony in grey,” touches none but the 
esthetic faculty. But a great mathematician, and 
even many persons who are not great mathema- 
ticians, will tell you that they derive immense 
pleasure from geometrical reasonings. Everybody 
knows mathematicians speak of solutions and 
problems as “ elegant,” and they tell you that a 
certain mass of mystic symbols is “ beautiful, 
quite lovely.” Well, you do not see it. They do 
see it, because the intellectual process, the process 
of comprehending the reasons symbolised by these 
figures and these signs, confers upon them a sort
-P-A-G-E-185
va SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 177 
of pleasure, such as an artist has in visual 
symmetry. Take a science of which I may speak 
with more confidence, and which is the most at- 
tractive of those I am concerned with. It is what 
we call morphology, which consists in tracing out 
the unity in variety of the infinitely diversified 
structures of animals and plants. I cannot give 
you any example of a thorough esthetic pleasure 
more intensely real than a pleasure of this 
kind—the pleasure which arises in one’s mind 
when a whole mass of different structures run into 
one harmony as the expression of a central law. 
That is where the province of art overlays and 
embraces the province of intellect. And, if I 
may venture to express an opinion on such a sub- 
ject, the great majority of forms of art are not 
in the sense what I just now defined them to be 
—pure art; but they derive much of their quality 
from simultaneous and even unconscious excite- 
ment of the intellect. 
When I was a boy, I was very fond of music, 
and I am so now; and it so happened that I had 
the opportunity of hearing much good music. 
Among other things, I had abundant opportunities 
of hearing that great old master, Sebastian Bach. 
I remember perfectly well—though I knew noth- 
ing about music then, and, I may add, know noth- 
ing whatever about it now—the intense satisfac- 
tion and delight which I had in listening, by the

which remains with me, I am glad to think; but, 
of late years, I have tried to find out the why 
and wherefore, and it has often occurred to me 
that the pleasure derived from musical compo- 
sitions of this kind is essentially of the same na- 
ture as that which is derived from pursuits which 
are commonly regarded as purely intellectual. I 
mean, that the source of pleasure is exactly the 
same as in most of my problems in morphology 
—that you have the theme in one of the old mas- 
ter’s works followed out in all its endless varia- 
tions, always appearing and always reminding you 
of unity in variety. So in painting; what is 
called “truth to nature” is the intellectual ele- 
ment coming in, and truth to nature depends en- 
tirely upon the intellectual culture of the person 
to whom art is addressed. If you are in Aus- 
tralia, you may get credit for being a good artist 
—I mean among the natives—if you can draw a 
kangaroo after a fashion. But, among men of 
higher civilisation, the intellectual knowledge we 
possess brings its criticism into our appreciation 
of works of art, and we are obliged to satisfy it, 
as well as the mere sense of beauty in colour and 
in outline. And so, the higher the culture and 
information of those whom art addresses, the more 
exact and precise must be what we call its “truth 
to nature.” 
If we turn to literature, the same thing is true, 
and you find works of literature which may be  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 179 
said to be pure art. A litle song of Shakespeare 
or of Goethe is pure art; it is exquisitely beautiful, 
although its intellectual content may be nothing. 
A series of pictures is made to pass before your 
mind by the meaning of words, and the effect is a 
melody of ideas. Nevertheless, the great mass of 
the literature we esteem is valued, not merely be- 
cause of having ‘artistic form, but because of its 
intellectual content; and the value is the higher 
the more precise, distinct, and true is that intel- 
lectual content. And, if you will let me for a 
moment speak of the very highest forms of lit- 
erature, do we not regard them as highest simply 
because the more we know the truer they seem, 
and the more competent we are to appreciate 
beauty the more beautiful they are? No man ever 
understands Shakespeare until he is old, though 
the youngest may admire him, the reason being 
that he satisfies the artistic instinct of the young- 
est and harmonises with the ripest and richest ex- 
perience of the oldest. 
I have said this much to draw your attention 
to what, in my mind, lies at the root of all this 
matter, and at the understanding of one another 
by the men of science on the one hand, and the 
men of literature, and history, and art, on the 
other. It is not a question whether one order of 
study or another should predominate. It is a 
question of what topics of education you shall 
select which will combine all the needful elements 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION VIL 
in such due proportion as to give the greatest 
amount of food, support, and encouragement to 
those faculties which enable us to appreciate truth, 
and to profit by those sources of innocent hap- 
piness which are open to us, and, at the same 
time, to avoid that which is bad, and coarse, and 
ugly, and keep clear of the multitude of pitfalls 
and dangers which beset those who break through 
the natural or moral laws. 
I address myself, in this spirit, to the consider- 
ation of the question of the value of purely liter- 
ary education. Is it good and sufficient, or is it 
insufficient and bad? Well, here I venture to say 
that there are literary educations and literary 
educations. If I am to understand by that term 
the education that was current in the great ma- 
jority of middle-class schools, and upper schools 
too, in this coun ty when I was a boy, and which 
consisted absolutely and almost entirely in keeping 
boys for eight or 
Latin and Gree 
Latin and Gree ten years at learning the rules of 
k grammar, construing certain 
k authors, and possibly making   verses which, had they been English verses, 
would have been condemned as abominable dog- 
gerel,—if that is what you mean by liberal edu- 
cation, then I say it is scandalously insufficient 
and almost worthless. My reason for saying so 
is not from the point of view of science at all, but 
from the point of view of literature. I say the 
thing professes to be literary education that is
-P-A-G-E-189
vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 181 
not a literary education at all. It was not liter- 
ature at all that was taught, but science in a 
very bad form. It is quite obvious that grammar 
is science and not literature. The analysis of a 
text by the help of the rules of grammar is just as 
much a scientific operation as the analysis of a 
chemical compound by the help of the rules of 
chemical analysis. There is nothing that appeals 
to the esthetic faculty in that operation; and I 
ask multitudes of men of my own age, who went 
through this process, whether they ever had a 
conception of art or literature until they obtained 
it for themselves after leaving school? Then you 
may say, “If that is so, if the education was 
scientific, why cannot you be satisfied with it?” 
I say, because although it is a scientific training, it 
is of the most inadequate and inappropriate kind. 
If there is any good at all in scientific education 
it is that men should be trained, as I said before, 
to know things for themselves at first hand, and 
that they should understand every step of the 
reason of that which they do. 
I desire to speak with the utmost respect of 
that science—philology—of which grammar is a 
part and parcel; yet everybody knows that gram- 
mar, as it is usually learned at school, affords no 
scientific training. It is taught just as you would 
teach the rules of chess or draughts. On the 
other hand, if I am to understand by a literary 
education the study of the literatures of either  
-P-A-G-E-190
182 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vu 
ancient or modern nations—but especially those of 
antiquity, and especially that of ancient Greece; 
if this literature is studied, not merely from the 
point of view of philological science, and its prac- 
tical application to the interpretation of texts, 
but as an exemplification of and commentary 
upon the principles of art; if you look upon the 
literature of a people as a chapter in the develop- 
ment of the human mind, if you work out this in 
a broad spirit, and with such collateral references 
to morals and politics, and physical geography, 
and the like as are needful to make you compre- 
hend what the meaning of ancient literature and 
civilisation is—then, assuredly, it affords a splen- 
did and noble education. But I still think it is 
susceptible of improvement, and that no man will 
ever comprehend the real secret of the difference 
between the ancient world and our present time, 
unless he has learned to see the difference which 
the late development of physical science has made 
between the thought of this day and the thought 
of that, and he will never see that difference, 
unless he has some practical insight into some 
branches of physical science; and you must re- 
member that a literary education such as that 
which I have just referred to, is out of the reach 
of those whose school life is cut short at sixteen or 
seventeen. 
But, you will say, all this is fault-finding; let 
us hear what you have in the way of positive  
-P-A-G-E-191
  vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 183 
suggestion. Then I am bound to tell you that, if 
I could make a clean sweep of everything—I am 
very glad I cannot because I might, and 
probably should, make mistakes,—but if I could 
make a clean sweep of everything and start 
afresh, I should, in the first place, secure that 
training of the young in reading and writing, and 
in the habit of attention and observation, both to 
that which is told them, and that which they see, 
which everybody agrees to. But in addition to 
that, I should make it absolutely necessary for 
everybody, for a longer or shorter period, to learn 
to draw. Now, you may say, there are some 
people who cannot draw, however much they may 
be taught. I deny that in toto, because I never yet 
met with anybody who could not learn to write. 
Writing is a form of drawing; therefore if you 
give the same attention and trouble to drawing 
as you do to writing, depend upon it, there is 
nobody who cannot be made to draw, more or less 
well. Do not misapprehend me. I do not say for 
one moment you would make an artistic draughts- 
man. Artists are not made; they grow. You 
may improve the natural faculty in that direction, 
but you cannot make it; but you can teach simple 
drawing, and you will find it an implement of 
learning of extreme value. I do not think its 
value can be exaggerated, because it gives you 
the means of training the young in attention and 
accuracy, which are the two things in which all 
72     
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vn 
mankind are more deficient than in any other 
mental quality whatever. The whole of my life 
has been spent in trying to give my proper atten- 
tion to things and to be accurate, and I have 
not succeeded as well as I could wish; and other 
people, I am afraid, are not much more fortu- 
nate. You cannot begin this habit too early, and 
I consider there is nothing of so great a value as 
the habit of drawing, to secure those two desira- 
ble ends. 
Then we come to the subject-matter, whether 
scientific or esthetic, of education, and I should 
naturally have no question at all about teaching 
the elements of physical science of the kind I 
have sketched, in a practical manner; but among 
scientific topics, using the word scientific in the 
broadest sense, I would also include the elements 
of the theory of morals and of that of political 
and social life, which, strangely enough, it never 
seems to occur to anybody to teach a child. I 
would have the history of our own country, and 
of all the influences which have been brought to 
bear upon it, with incidental geography, not as a 
mere chronicle of reigns and battles, but as a 
chapter in the development of the race, and the 
history of civilisation. 
Then with respect to westhetic knowledge and 
discipline, we have happily in the English lan- 
guage one of the most magnificent storehouses of 
artistic beauty and of models of literary excellence
-P-A-G-E-193
  vi SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 185 
which exists in the world at the present time. I 
have said before, and I repeat it here, that if a man 
cannot get literary culture of the highest kind out 
of his Bible, and Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and 
Milton, and Hobbes, and Bishop Berkeley, to 
mention only a few of our illustrious writers—I 
say, if he cannot get it out of those writers, he 
cannot get it out of anything; and I would 
assuredly devote a very large portion of the time 
of every English child to the careful study of the 
models of English writing of such varied and 
wonderful kind as we possess, and, what is still 
more important and still more neglected, the habit 
of using that language with precision, with force, 
and with art. I fancy we are almost the only 
nation in the world who seem to think that com- 
position comes by nature. The French attend to 
their own language, the Germans study theirs; but 
Englishmen do not seem to think it is worth their 
while. Nor would I fail to include, in the course 
of study I am sketching, translations of all the 
best works of antiquity, or of the modern world. 
It is a very desirable thing to read Homer in 
Greek; but if you don’t happen to know Greek, 
the next best thing we can do is to read as good 
a translation of it as we have recently been 
furnished with in prose. You won’t get all you 
would get from the original, but you may get a 
great deal; and to refuse to know this great deal 
because you cannot get all, seems to be as sensible  
-P-A-G-E-194
    
186 SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION vu 
as for a hungry man to refuse bread because he 
cannot get partridge. Finally, I would add in- 
struction in either music or painting, or, if the 
child should be so unhappy, as sometimes happens, 
as to have no faculty for either of those, and no 
possibility of doing anything in any artistic sense 
with them, then I would see what could be done 
with literature alone; but I would provide, in the 
fullest sense, for the development of the esthetic 
side of the mind. In my judgment, those are all 
the essentials of education for an English child. 
With that outfit, such as it might be made in the 
time given to education which is within the 
reach of nine-tenths of the population—with that 
outfit, an Englishman, within the limits of 
English life, is fitted to go anywhere, to occupy 
the highest positions, to fill the highest offices 
of the State, and to become distinguished in prac- 
tical pursuits, in science, or in art. For, if he have 
the opportunity to learn all those things, and have 
his mind disciplined in the various directions the 
teaching of those topics would have necessitated, 
then, assuredly, he will be able to pick up, on his 
road through life, all the rest of the intellectual 
baggage he wants. 
If the educational time at our disposition were 
sufficient there are one or two things I would add 
to those I have just now called the essentials; and 
perhaps you will be surprised to hear, though I 
hope you will not, that I should add, not more
-P-A-G-E-195
  
vu SCIENCE AND ART AND EDUCATION 187 
science, but one, or, if possible, two languages. 
The knowledge of some other language than one’s 
own is, in fact, of singular intellectual value. 
Many of the faults and mistakes of the ancient 
philosophers are traceable to the fact that they 
knew no language but their own, and were often 
led into confusing the symbol with the thought 
which it embodied. I think it is Locke who says 
that one-half of the mistakes of philosophers have 
arisen from questions about words; and one of the 
safest ways of delivering yourself from the bondage 
of words is, to know how ideas look in words to 
which you are not accustomed. That is one reason 
for the study of language; another reason is, that 
it opens new fields in art and in science. Another 
is the practical value of such knowledge; and yet 
another is this, that if your languages are properly 
chosen, from the time of learning the additional 
languages you will know your own language better 
than ever you did. So, I say, if the time given 
to education permits, add Latin and German. 
Latin, because it is the key to nearly one-half of 
English and to all the Romance languages; and 
German, because it is the key to almost all the 
remainder of English, and helps you to understand 
a race from whom most of us have sprung, and 
who have a character and a literature of a fateful 
force in the history of the world, such as probably 
has been allotted to those of no other people, 
except the Jews, the Greeks, and ourselves.

Beyond these, the essential and the eminently 
desirable elements of all education, let each man 
take up his special line—the historian devote him- 
self to his history, the man of science to his sci- 
ence, the man of letters to his culture of that 
kind, and the artist to his special pursuit.

UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 
[1874] 
Execrep by the suffrages of your four Nations 
Rector of the ancient University of which you are 
scholars, I take the earliest opportunity which has 
presented itself since my restoration to health, of 
delivering the Address which, by long custom, is 
expected of the holder of my office. 
My first duty in opening that Address, is to 
offer you my most hearty thanks for the signal 
honour you have conferred upon me—an honour 
of which, as a man unconnected with you by 
personal or by national ties, devoid of political 
distinction, and a plebian who stands by his order, 
I could not have dreamed. And it was the more 
surprising to me, as the five-and-twenty years 
which have passed over my head since I reached 
intellectual manhood, have been largely spent in 
no half-hearted advocacy of doctrines which have 
189
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
not yet found favour in the eyes of Academic 
respectability; so that, when the proposal to 
nominate me for your Rector came, I was almost 
as much astonished as was Hal o’ the Wynd, “ who 
fought for his own hand,” by the Black Douglas’s 
proffer of knighthood. And I fear that my 
acceptance must be taken as evidence that, less 
wise than the Armourer of Perth, I have not yet 
done with soldiering. 
In fact, if, for a moment, I imagined that your 
intention was simply, in the kindness of your 
hearts, to do me honour; and that the Rector of 
your University, like that of some other Uni- 
versities was one of those happy beings who sit 
in glory for three years, with nothing to do for 
it save the making of a speech, a conversation 
with my distinguished predecessor soon dispelled 
the dream. I found that, by the constitution of 
the University of Aberdeen, the incumbent of the 
Rectorate is, if not a power, at any rate a potential 
energy; and that, whatever may be his chances of 
success or failure, it is his duty to convert that 
potential energy into a living force, directed 
towards such ends as may seem to him conducive 
to the welfare of the corporation of which he is 
the theoretical head. 
I need not tell you that your late Lord Rector 
took this view of his position, and acted upon it 
with the comprehensive, far-seeing insight into 
the actual condition and tendencies, not merely
-P-A-G-E-199
vit UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 191 
of his own, but of other countries, which is his 
honourable characteristic among statesmen. I 
have already done my best, and, as long as I hold 
my office, I shall continue my endeavours, to fol- 
low in the path which he trod; to do what in me 
lies, to bring this University nearer to the ideal— 
alas, that I should be obliged to say ideal—of all 
Universities; which, as I conceive, should be places 
in which thought is free from all fetters; and in 
which all sources of knowledge, and all aids to 
learning, should be accessible to all comers, with- 
out distinction of creed or country, riches or 
poverty. 
Do not suppose, however, that I am sanguine 
enough to expect much to come of any poor efforts 
of mine. If your annals take any notice of my 
incumbency, I shall probably go down to posterity 
as the Rector who was always beaten. But if they 
add, as I think they will, that my defeats became 
victories in the hands of my successors, I shall be 
well content. 
The scenes are shifting in the great theatre of 
the world. The act which commenced with the 
Protestant Reformation is nearly played out, and a 
wider and deeper change than that effected three 
centuries ago—a reformation, or rather a revolu- 
tion of thought, the extremes of which are repre- 
sented by the intellectual heirs of John of Leyden 
and of Ignatius Loyola, rather than by those of 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
  192 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vin 
Luther and of Leo—is waiting to come on, nay, 
visible behind the scenes to those who have good 
eyes. Men are beginning, once more, to awake to 
the fact that matters of belief and of speculation 
are of absolutely infinite practical importance; and 
are drawing off from that sunny country “ where it 
is always afternoon ”—the sleepy hollow of broad 
indifferentism—to range themselves under their 
natural banners. Change is in the air. It is 
whirling feather-heads into all sorts of eccentric 
orbits, and filling the steadiest with a sense of in- 
security. It insists on reopening all questions and 
asking all institutions, however venerable, by what 
right they exist, and whether they are, or are not, 
in harmony with the real or supposed wants of 
mankind. And it is remarkable that these search- 
ing inquiries are not so much forced on institu- 
tions from without, as developed from within. 
Consummate scholars question the value of learn- 
ing; priests contemn dogma; and women turn 
their backs upon man’s ideal of perfect woman- 
hood, and seek satisfaction in apocalyptic visions 
of some, as yet, unrealised epicene reality. 
If there be a type of stability in this world, one 
would be inclined to look for it in the old Univer- 
sities of England. But it has been my business 
of late to hear a good deal about what is going on 
in these famous corporations; and I have been 
filled with astonishment by the evidences of inter- 
nal fermentation which they exhibit. If Gibbon
-P-A-G-E-201
  vit UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 193 
could revisit the ancient seat of learning of which 
he has written so cavalierly, assuredly he would 
no longer speak of “the monks of Oxford sunk in 
prejudice and port.” ‘There, as elsewhere, port 
has gone out of fashion, and so has prejudice—at 
least that particular fine, old, crusted sort of pre- 
judice to which the great historian alludes. 
Indeed, things are moving so fast in Oxford 
and Cambridge, that, for my part, I rejoiced when 
the Royal Commission, of which I am a member, 
had finished and presented the Report which re- 
lated to these Universities; for we should have 
looked like mere plagiarists, if, in consequence of a 
little longer delay in issuing it, all the measures of 
reform we proposed had been anticipated by the 
spontaneous action of the Universities them- 
selves. 
A month ago I should have gone on to say that 
one might speedily expect changes of another 
kind in Oxford and Cambridge. A Commission 
has been inquiring into the revenues of the many 
wealthy societies in more or less direct connection 
with the Universities, resident in those towns. It 
is said that the Commission has reported, and 
that, for the first time in recorded history, the 
nation, and perhaps the Colleges themselves, will 
know what they are worth. And it was announced 
that a statesman, who, whatever his other merits 
or defects, has aims above the level of mere party 
fighting, and a clear vision into the most complex
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
practical problems, meant to deal with these 
revenues. 
But, Bos locutus est. That mysterious indepen- 
dent variable of political calculation, Public 
Opinion—which some whisper is, in the present 
case, very much the same thing as publican’s 
opinion—has willed otherwise. The Heads may 
return to their wonted slumbers—at any rate for 
a space. 
Is the spirit of change, which is working thus 
vigorously in the South, likely to affect the 
Northern Universities, and if so, to what extent? 
The violence of fermentation depends, not so much 
on the quantity of the yeast, as on the com- 
position of the wort, and its richness in fer- 
mentable material; and, as a preliminary to the 
discussion of this question, I venture to call to 
your minds the essential and fundamental differ- 
ences between the Scottish and the English type 
of University. 
Do not charge me with anything worse than 
official egotism, if I say that these differences 
appear to be largely symbolised by my own 
existence. There is no Rector in an English 
University. Now, the organisation of the mem- 
bers of a University into Nations, with their 
elective Rector, is the last relic of the primitive 
constitution of Universities. The Rectorate was 
the most important of all offices in that University 
of Paris, upon the model of which the University  
-P-A-G-E-203
vir UNIVERSITIES; ACTUAL AND IDEAL 195 
of Aberdeen was fashioned; and which was cer- 
tainly a great and flourishing institution in the 
twelfth century. 
Enthusiasts for the antiquity of one of the two 
acknowledged parents of all Universities, indeed, 
do not hesitate to trace the origin of the “ Studium 
Parisiense” up to that wonderful king of the 
Franks and Lombards, Karl, surnamed the Great, 
whom we all called Charlemagne, and believed to 
be a Frenchman, until a learned historian, by 
beneficent iteration, taught’us better. Karl is said 
not to have been much of a scholar himself, 
but he had the wisdom of which knowledge is 
only the servitor. And that wisdom enabled him 
to see that ignorance is one of the roots of all 
evil. 
In the Capitulary which enjoins the foundation 
of monasterial and cathedral schools, he says: 
“Right action is better than knowledge; but in 
order to do what is right, we must know what is 
right.” * An irrefragable truth, I fancy. Acting 
upon it, the king took pretty full compulsory 
powers, and carried into effect a really considerable 
and effectual scheme of elementary education 
through the length and breadth of his dominions. . 
No doubt the idolaters out by the Elbe, in what

is now part of Prussia, objected to the Frankish 
king’s measures; no doubt the priests, who had 
never hesitated about sacrificing all unbelievers in 
their fantastic deities and futile conjurations, were 
the loudest in chanting the virtues of toleration; 
no doubt they denounced as a cruel persecutor 
the man who would not allow them, however 
sincere they might be, to go on spreading de- 
lusions which debased the intellect, as much as 
they deadened the moral sense, and undermined 
the bonds of civil allegiance; no doubt, if they 
had lived in these times, they would have been 
able to show, with ease, that the king’s proceed- 
ings were totally contrary to the best liberal 
principles. But it may be said, in justification of 
the Teutonic ruler, first, that he was born before 
those principles, and did not suspect that the best 
way of getting disorder into order was to let it 
alone; and, secondly, that his rough and question- 
able proceedings did, more or less, bring about the 
end he had in view. For, in a couple of centuries, 
the schools he sowed broadcast produced their crop 
of men, thirsting for knowledge and craving for 
culture. Such men gravitating towards Paris, as 
a light amidst the darkness of evil days, from 
Germany, from Spain, from Britain, and from 
Scandinavia, came together by natural affinity. 
By degrees they banded themselves into a society, 
which, as its end was the knowledge of all things 
knowable, called itself a “ Studiwm Generale;” 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  vit UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 197 
and when it had grown into a recognised corpora- 
tion, acquired the name of “Universitas Studii 
Generalis,” which, mark you, means not a “ Useful 
Knowledge Society,” but a “ Knowledge-of-things- 
in-general Society.” 
And thus the first “ University,” at any rate on 
this side of the Alps, came into being. Originally 
it had but one Faculty, that of Arts. Its aim ‘was 
to be a centre of knowledge and culture; not to 
be, in any sense, a technical school. 
The scholars seem to have studied Grammar, 
Logic, and Rhetoric; Arithmetic and Geometry; 
Astronomy; Theology; and Music. Thus, their 
work, however imperfect and faulty, judged by 
modern lights, it may have been, brought them 
face to face with all the leading aspects of the 
many-sided mind of man. For these studies did 
really contain, at any rate in embryo—sometimes, 
it may be, in caricature—what we now call 
Philosophy, Mathematical and Physical Science, 
and Art. And I doubt if the curriculum of any 
modern University shows so clear and generous a 
comprehension of what is meant by culture, as 
this old Trivium and Quadrivium does. 
The students who had passed through the Uni- 
versity course, and had proved themselves com- 
petent to teach, became masters and teachers of 
their younger brethren. Whence the distinction 
of Masters and Regents on the one hand, and 
Scholars on the other.
-P-A-G-E-206
  
198 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL  vnr 
Rapid growth necessitated organisation. The 
Masters and Scholars of various tongues and 
countries grouped themselves into four Nations; 
and the Nations, by their own votes at first, and 
subsequently by those of their Procurators, or 
representatives, elected their supreme head and 
governor, the Rector—at that time the sole 
representative of the University, and a very real 
power, who could defy Provosts interfering from 
without; or could inflict even corporal punishment 
on disobedient members within the University. 
Such was the primitive constitution of the Uni- 
versity of Paris. It is in reference to this original 
state of things that I have spoken of the Rectorate, 
and all that appertains to it, as the sole relic of 
that constitution. 
But this original organisation did not last long. 
Society was not then, any more than it is now, 
patient of culture, as such. It says to everything, 
“Be useful to me, or away with you.” And to 
the learned, the unlearned man said then, as he 
does now, “ What is the use of all your learning, 
unless you can tell me what I want to know? I 
am here blindly groping about, and constantly 
‘damaging myself by collision with three mighty 
powers, the power of the invisible God, the power 
of my fellow Man, and the power of brute Nature. 
Let your learning be turned to the study of these 
powers, that I may know how I am to comport 
myself with regard to them.” In answer to this
-P-A-G-E-207
vi UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 199 
demand, some of the Masters of the Faculty of 
Arts devoted themselves to the study of Theology, 
some to that of Law, and some to that of 
Medicine; and they became Doctors—men learned 
in those technical, or, as we now call them, pro- 
fessional, branches of knowledge. Like cleaving 
to like, the Doctors formed schools, or Faculties, 
of Theology, Law, and Medicine, which sometimes 
assumed airs of superiority over their parent, the 
Faculty of Arts, though the latter always asserted 
and maintained its fundamental supremacy. 
The Faculties arose by process of natural dif- 
ferentiation out of the primitive University. 
Other constituents, foreign to its nature, were 
speedily grafted upon it. One of these extraneous 
elements were forced into it by the Roman Church, 
which in those days asserted with effect, that 
which it now asserts, happily without any effect 
in these realms, its rights of censorship and con- 
trol over all teaching. The local habitation of 
the University lay partly in the lands attached 
to the monastery of 8. Genevieve, partly in the 
diocese of the Bishop of Paris; and he who would 
teach must have the license of the Abbot, or of 
the Bishop, as the nearest representative of the 
Pope, so to do, which license was granted by the 
Chancellors of these Ecclesiastics. 
Thus, if I am what archeologists call a “ sur- 
vival” of the primitive head and ruler of the* 
University, your Chancellor stands in the same 
: 73

relation to the Papacy; and, with all respect for 
his Grace, I think I may say that we both look 
terribly shrunken when compared with our great 
originals. 
Not so is it with the second foreign element, 
which silently dropped into the soil of Univer- 
sities, like the grain of mustard-seed in the para- 
ble; and, like that grain, grew into a tree, in 
whose branches a whole aviary of fowls took shel- 
ter. That element is the element of Endowment. 
It differed from the preceding, in its original de- 
sign to serve as a prop to the young plant, not 
to be a parasite upon it. The charitable and the 
humane, blessed with wealth, were very early pene- 
trated by the misery of the poor student. And 
the wise saw that intellectual ability is not so 
common or so unimportant a gift that it should 
be allowed to run to waste upon mere handicrafts 
and chares. The man who was a blessing to his 
contemporaries, but who so often has been con- 
verted into a curse, by the blind adherence of his 
posterity to the letter, rather than to the spirit, 
of his wishes—I mean the “pious founder ”— 
gave money and lands, that the student, who was 
rich in brain and poor in all else, might be taken 
from the plough or from the stithy, and enabled 
to devote himself to the higher service of man- 
kind; and built colleges and halls in which he 
might be not only housed and fed, but taught. 
The Colleges were very generally placed in
-P-A-G-E-209
  yur UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 901 
strict subordination to the University by their 
founders; but, in many cases, their endowment, 
consisting of land, has undergone an “ unearned 
increment,” which has given these societies a con- 
tinually increasing weight and importance as 
against the unendowed, or fixedly endowed, Uni- 
versity. In Pharaoh’s dream, the seven lean kine 
eat up the seven fat ones. In the reality of his- 
torical fact, the fat Colleges have eaten up the 
lean Universities. 
Even here in Aberdeen, though the causes at 
work may have been somewhat different, the ef- 
fects have been similar; and you see how much 
more substantial an entity is the Very Reverend 
the Principal, analogue, if not homologue, of the 
Principals of King’s College, than the Rector, 
lineal representative of the ancient monarchs of 
the University, though now, little more than a 
“king of shreds and patches.” 
Do not suppose that, in thus briefly tracing the 
process of University metamorphosis, I have had 
any intention of quarrelling with its results. 
Practically, it seems to me that the broad changes 
effected in 1858 have given the Scottish Univer- 
sities a very liberal constitution, with as much real 
approximation to the primitive state of things as 
is at all desirable. If your fat kine have eaten 
the lean, they have not lain down to chew the cud 
ever since. The Scottish Universities, like the 
English, have diverged widely enough from their
-P-A-G-E-210
er ee en ae 
202 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
primitive model; but I cannot help thinking that 
the northern form has remained more faithful to 
its original, not only in constitution, but, what is 
more to the purpose, in view of the cry for change, 
in the practical application of the endowments con- 
nected with it. 
In Aberdeen, these endowments are numerous, 
but so small that, taken altogether, they are not 
equal to the revenue of a single third-rate English 
college. They are scholarships, not fellowships; 
aids to do work—not rewards for such work as it 
lies within the reach of an ordinary, or even an 
extraordinary, young man to do. You do not 
think that passing a respectable examination is a 
fair equivalent for an income, such as many’ a 
grey-headed veteran, or clergyman would envy; 
and which is larger than the endowment of many 
Regius chairs. You do not care to make your 
University q school of manners for the rich; of 
sports for the athletic; or a hot-bed of high-fed, 
hypercritical refinement, more destructive to vig- 
our and originality than are starvation and op- 
pression. No; your little Bursaries of ten and 
twenty (I believe even fifty) pounds a year, en- 
abled any boy who has shown ability in the course 
of his education in those remarkable primary 
schools, which have made Scotland the power she 
is, to obtain the highest culture the country can 
give him; and when he is armed and equipped, 
his Spartan Alma Mater tells him that, so far, he 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  
vor UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 903 
has had his wages for his work, and that he may 
go and earn the rest. 
When I think of the host of pleasant, moneyed, 
well-bred young gentlemen, who do a little learn- 
ing and much boating by Cam and Isis, the vision 
is a pleasant one; and, as a patriot, I rejoice that 
the youth of the upper and richer classes of the 
nation receive a wholesome and a manly training, 
however small may be the modicum of knowledge 
they gather, in the intervals of this, their serious 
business. I admit, to the full, the social and po- 
litical value of that training. But, when I pro- 
ceed to consider that these young men may be said 
to represent the great bulk of what the Colleges 
have to show for their enormous wealth, plus, at 
least, a hundred and fifty pounds a year apiece 
which each undergraduate costs his parents or 
guardians, I feel inclined to ask, whether the rate- 
in-aid of the education of the wealthy and pro- 
fessional classes, thus levied on the resources of 
the community, is not, after all, a little heavy? 
And, still further, I am tempted to inquire what 
has become of the indigent scholars, the sons of 
the masses of the people whose daily labour just 
suffices to meet their daily wants, for whose bene- 
fit these rich foundations were largely, if not 
mainly, instituted? It seems as if Pharaoh’s 
dream had been rigorously carried out, and that 
even the fat scholar has eaten the lean one. And 
when I turn from this picture to the no less real
-P-A-G-E-212

vision of many a brave and frugal Scotch boy, 
spending his summer in hard manual labour, that 
he may have the privilege of wending his way in 
autumn to this University, with a bag of oatmeal, 
ten pounds in his pocket, and his own stout heart 
to depend upon through the northern winter; not 
bent on seeking 
“The bubble reputation at the cannon’s mouth,” 
but determined to wring knowledge from the hard 
hands of penury; when I see him win through all 
such outward obstacles to positions of wide use- 
fulness and well-earned fame; I cannot but think 
that, in essence, Aberdeen has departed but little 
from the primitive intention of the founders of 
Universities, and that the spirit of reform has so 
much to do on the other side of the Border, that it 
may be long before he has leisure to look this 
way. 
As compared with other actual Universities, 
then, Aberdeen, may, perhaps, be well satisfied 
with itself. But do not think me an impracti- 
cable dreamer, if I ask you not to rest and be 
thankful in this state of satisfaction; if I ask you 
to consider awhile, how this actual good stands 
related to that ideal better, towards which both 
men and institutions must progress, if they would 
not retrograde. 
In an ideal University, as I conceive it, a man 
should be able to obtain instruction in all forms
-P-A-G-E-213
wa UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 905 
of knowledge, and discipline in the use of all the 
methods by which knowledge is obtained. In 
such a University, the force of living example 
should fire the student with a noble ambition to 
emulate the learning of learned men, and to follow 
in the footsteps of the explorers of new fields of 
knowledge. And the very air he breathes should 
be charged with that enthusiasm for truth, that 
fanaticism of veracity, which is a greater posses- 
sion than much learning; a nobler gift than the 
power of increasing knowledge; by so much 
greater and nobler than these, as the moral nature 
of man is greater than the intellectual; for ve- 
racity is the heart of morality. 
But the man who is all morality and intellect, 
although he may be good and even great, is, after 
all, only half a man. There is beauty in the 
moral world and in the intellectual world; but 
there is also a beauty which is neither moral nor 
intellectual—the beauty of the world of Art. 
There are men who are devoid of the power of 
seeing it, as there are men who are born deaf and 
blind, and the loss of those, as of these, is simply 
infinite. There are others in whom it is an over- 
powering passion; happy men, born with the pro- 
ductive, or at lowest, the appreciative, genius of 
the Artist. But, in the mass of mankind, the 
Aisthetic faculty, like the reasoning power and the 
moral sense, needs to be roused, directed, and cul- 
tivated; and I know not why the development of 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
206 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vin 
that side of his nature, through which man has 
access to a perennial spring of ennobling pleasure, 
should be omitted from any comprehensive scheme 
of University education. 
All Universities recognise Literature in the 
sense of the old Rhetoric, which is art incarnate 
in words. Some, to their credit, recognise Art in 
its narrower sense, to a certain extent, and con- 
fer degrees for proficiency in some of its branches. 
If there are Doctors of Music, why should there 
be no Masters of painting, of Sculpture, of Ar- 
chitecture? I should like to see Professors of the 
Fine Arts in every University; and instruction in 
some branch of their work made a part of the 
Arts curriculum. 
I just now expressed the opinion that, in our 
ideal University, a man should be able to obtain 
instruction in all forms of knowledge. Now, by 
“forms of knowledge” I mean the great classes 
of things knowable; of which the first, in logical, 
though not in natural, order is knowledge relating 
to the scope and limits of the mental faculties of 
man, a form of knowledge which, in its positive 
aspect, answers pretty much to Logic and part of 
Psychology, while, on its negative and critical 
side, it corresponds with Metaphysics. 
A second class comprehends all that knowledge 
which relates to man’s welfare, so far as it is deter- 
mined by his own acts, or what we call his con- 
duct. It answers to Moral and Religious philos-
-P-A-G-E-215
  
vir UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 907 
ophy. Practically, it is the most directly valuable 
of all forms of knowledge, but speculatively, it is 
limited and criticised by that which precedes and 
by that which follows it in my order of enumera- 
tion. 
A third class embraces knowledge of the 
phenomena of the Universe, as that which lies 
about the individual man; and of the rules which 
those phenomena are observed to follow in the 
order of their occurrence, which we term the laws 
of Nature. 
That is what ought to be called Natural Sci- 
ence, or Physiology, though those terms are hope- 
essly diverted from such a meaning; and it in- 
cludes all exact knowledge of natural fact, whether 
Mathematical, Physical, Biological, or Social. 
Kant has said that the ultimate object of all 
knowledge is to give replies to these three ques- 
ions: What can I do? What ought I to do? 
What may I hope for? The forms of knowledge 
which I have enumerated, should furnish such re- 
lies as are within human reach, to the first and 
second of these questions. While to the third, 
erhaps the wisest answer is, “Do what you can 
o do what you ought, and leave hoping and fear- 
ing alone.” 
If this be a just and an exhaustive classifica- 
ion of the forms of knowledge, no question as to 
heir relative importance, or as to their superiority 
of one to the other, can be seriously raised.  
-P-A-G-E-216
  208 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vur 
On the face of the matter, it is absurd to ask 
whether it is more important to know the limits of 
one’s powers; or the ends for which they ought to 
be exerted; or the conditions under which they 
must be exerted. One may as well inquire which 
of the terms of a Rule of Three sum one ought to 
know, in order to get a trustworthy result. Prac- 
tical life is such a sum, in which your duty multi- 
plies into your capacity, and divided by your cir- 
cumstances, gives you the fourth term in the pro- 
portion, which is your deserts, with great accuracy. 
All agree, I take it, that men ought to have these 
three kinds of knowledge. The so-called “con- 
flict of studies” turns upon the question of how 
they may be best obtained. 
The founders of Universities held the theory 
that the Scriptures and Aristotle taken together, 
the latter being limited by the former, contained 
all knowledge worth having, and that the business 
of philosophy was to interpret and co-ordinate 
these two. I imagine that in the twelfth century 
this was a very fair conclusion from known facts. 
Nowhere in the world, in those days, was there 
such an encyclopedia of knowledge of all three 
classes, as is to be found in those writings. The 
scholastic philosophy is a wonderful monument of 
the patience and ingenuity with which the human 
mind toiled to build up a logically consistent 
theory of the Universe, out of such materials. 
And that philosophy is by no means dead and 
 
-P-A-G-E-217
vit UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 909 
buried, as many vainly suppose. On the contrary, 
numbers of men of no mean learning and accom- 
plishment, and sometimes of rare power and sub- 
tlety of thought, hold by it as the best theory of 
things which has yet been stated. And, what is 
still more remarkable, men who speak the lan- 
guage of modern philosophy, nevertheless think 
the thoughts of the schoolmen. “The voice is 
the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands 
of Esau.” Every day I hear “Cause,” “ Law,” 
“ Force,” “ Vitality,” spoken of as entities, by peo- 
ple who can enjoy Swift’s joke about the meat- 
roasting quality of the smoke-jack, and comfort 
themselves with the reflection that they are not 
eyen as those benighted schoolmen. 
Well, this great system had its day, and then it 
was sapped and mined by two influences. The 
first was the study of classical literature, which 
familiarised men with methods of philosophising; 
with conceptions of the highest Good; with ideas 
of the order of Nature; with notions of Literary 
and Historical Criticism; and, above all, with 
visions of Art, of a kind which not only would not 
fit into the scholastic scheme, but showed them a 
pre-Christian, and indeed altogether un-Christian 
world, of such grandeur and beauty that they 
ceased to think of any other. They were as men 
who had kissed the Fairy Queen, and wan- 
dering with her in the dim loveliness of the 
under-world, cared not to return to the familiar 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
210 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vit 
ways of home and fatherland, though they 
lay, at arm’s length, overhead. Cardinals were 
more familiar with Virgil than with Isaiah; and 
Popes laboured, with great success, to re-paganise 
Rome. 
The second influence was the slow, but sure, 
growth of the physical sciences. It was discov- 
ered that some results of speculative thought, of 
immense practical and theoretical importance, can 
be verified by observation; and are always true, 
however severely they may be tested. Here, at 
any rate, was knowledge, to the certainty of which 
no authority could add, or take away, one jot or 
tittle, and to which the tradition of a thou- 
sand years was as insignificant as the hearsay of 
yesterday. To the scholastic system, the study 
of classical literature might be inconvenient 
and distracting, but it was possible to hope 
that it could be kept within bounds. Physical 
science, on the other hand, was an irreconcilable 
enemy, to be excluded at all hazards. The 
College of Cardinals has not distinguished it- 
self in Physics or Physiology; and no Pope 
has, as yet, set up public laboratories in the 
Vatican. 
People do not always formulate the beliefs on 
which they act. The instinct of fear and dislike 
is quicker than the reasoning process; and I sus- 
pect that, taken in conjunction with some other 
causes, such instinctive aversion is at the bottom
-P-A-G-E-219
  vit UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 911 
of the long exclusion of any serious discipline in 
the physical sciences from the general curriculum 
of Universities; while, on the other hand, clas- 
sical literature has been gradually made the back- 
bone of the Arts course. 
I am ashamed to repeat here what I have said 
elsewhere, in season and out of season, respecting 
the value of Science as knowledge and discipline. 
But the other day I met with some passages in the 
Address to another Scottish University, of a great 
thinker, recently lost to us, which express so fully, 
and yet so tersely, the truth in this matter that I 
am fain to quote them:— 
“To question all things;—never to turn away 
from any difficulty; to accept no doctrine either 
from ourselves or from other people without a 
rigid scrutiny by negative criticism; letting no 
fallacy, or incoherence, or confusion of thought, 
step by unperceived; above all, to insist upon hav- 
ing the meaning of a word clearly understood be- 
fore using it, and the meaning of a proposition 
before assenting to it;—these are the lessons we 
learn” from workers in Science. “ With all this 
vigorous management of the negative element, 
they inspire no scepticism about the reality of 
truth or indifference to its pursuit. The noblest 
enthusiasm, both for the search after truth and for 
applying it to its highest uses, pervades those writ- 
ers.” “In cultivating, therefore,” science as an 
essential ingredient in education, “we are all the
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vin 
while laying an admirable foundation for ethical 
and philosophical culture.” * 
The passages I have quoted were uttered by 
John Stuart Mill; but you cannot hear inverted 
commas, and it is therefore right that I should add, 
without delay, that I have taken the liberty of 
substituting “workers in science” for “ ancient 
dialecticians,” and “Science as an essential in- 
gredient in education ” for “ the ancient languages 
as our best literary education.” Mill did, in fact, 
deliver a noble panegyric upon classical studies. 
I do not doubt its justice, nor presume to question 
its wisdom. But I venture to maintain that no 
wise or just judge, who has a knowledge of the 
facts, will hesitate to say that it implies with equal 
force to scientific training. 
But it is only fair to the Scottish Universities 
to point out that they have long understood the 
value of Science as a branch of general education. 
I observe, with the greatest satisfaction, that can- 
didates for the degree of Master of Arts in this 
University are required to have a knowledge, not 
only of Mental and Moral Philosophy, and of 
Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, but of Nat- 
ural History, in addition to the ordinary Latin 
and Greek course; and that a candidate may take 
honours in these subjects and in Chemistry. 
* Inaugural Address delivered to the University of St. 
Andrew, February 1, 1867, by J. S. Mill, Rector of the Uni- 
versity (pp. 82, 33).

I do not know what the requirements of your 
examiners may be, but I sincerely trust they are 
not satisfied with a mere book knowledge of these 
matters. For my own part I would not raise a 
finger, if I could thereby introduce mere book 
work in science into every Arts curriculum in the 
country. Let those who want to study books de- 
vote themselves to Literature, in which we have 
the perfection of books, both as to substance and 
as to form. If I may paraphrase Hobbes’s well- 
known aphorism, I would say that “ books are the 
money of Literature, but only the counters of Sci- 
ence,” Science (in the sense in which I now use the 
term) being the knowledge of fact, of which every 
verbal description is but an incomplete and sym- 
bolic expression. And be assured that no teach- 
ing of science is worth anything, as a mental dis- 
cipline, which is not based upon direct perception 
of the facts, and practical exercise of the observing 
and logical faculties upon them. Even in such a 
simple matter as the mere comprehension of form, 
ask the most practised and widely informed anato- 
mist what is the difference between his knowledge 
of a structure which he has read about, and his 
knowledge of the same structure when he has seen 
it for himself; and he will tell you that the two 
things are not comparable—the difference is in- 
finite. Thus I am very strongly inclined to agree 
with some learned schoolmasters who say that, in 
their experience, the teaching of science is all 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vir 
waste time. As they teach it, I have no doubt it is. 
But to teach it otherwise requires an amount of 
personal labour and a development of means and 
appliances, which must strike horror and dismay 
into a man accustomed to mere book work; and 
who has been in the habit of teaching a class of 
fifty without much strain upon his energies. And 
this is one of the real difficulties in the way of the 
introduction of physical science into the ordinary 
University course, to which I have alluded. It is 
a difficulty which will not be overcome, until 
years of patient study have organised scientific 
teaching as well as, or I hope better than, classical 
teaching has been organised hitherto. 
A little while ago, I ventured to hint a doubt 
as to the perfection of some of the arrangements 
in the ancient Universities of England; but, in 
their provision for giving instruction in Science as 
such, and without direct reference to any of its 
practical applications, they have set a brilliant ex- 
ample. Within the last twenty years, Oxford alone 
has sunk more than a hundred and twenty thou- 
sand pounds in building and furnishing Physical, 
Chemical, and Physiological Laboratories, and a 
magnificent Museum, arranged with an almost 
luxurious regard for the needs of the student. 
Cambridge, less rich, but aided by the munificence 
of her Chancellor, is taking the same course; and 
in a few years, it will be for no lack of the means 
and appliances of sound teaching, if the mass of
-P-A-G-E-223

English University men remain in their present 
state of barbarous ignorance of even the rudiments 
of scientific culture. 
Yet another step needs to be made before Sci- 
ence can be said to have taken its proper place in 
the Universities. That is its recognition as a Fac- 
ulty, or branch of study demanding recognition 
and special organisation, on account of its bearing 
on the wants of mankind. The Faculties of The- 
ology, Law, and Medicine, are technical schools, 
intended to equip men who have received general 
culture, with the special knowledge which is 
needed for the proper performance of the duties 
of clergymen, lawyers, and medical practitioners. 
When the material well-being of the country 
depended upon rude pasture and agriculture, and 
still ruder mining; in the days when all the in- 
numerable applications of the principles of physi- 
cal science to practical purposes were non-existent 
even as dreams; days which men living may have 
heard their fathers speak of; what little physical 
science could be seen to bear directly upon hu- 
man life, lay within the province of Medicine. 
Medicine was the foster-mother of Chemistry, be- 
cause it has to do with the preparation of drugs 
and the detection of poisons; of Botany, because 
it enabled the physician to recognise medicinal 
herbs; of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology, 
because the man who studied Human Anatomy 
and Physiology for purely medical purposes was 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  916 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
led to extend his studies to the rest of the animal 
world. 
Within my recollection, the only way in which 
a student could obtain anything like a training in 
Physical Science, was by attending the lectures of 
the Professors of Physical and Natural Science 
attached to the Medical Schools. But, in the 
course of the last thirty years, both foster-mother 
and child have grown so big, that they threaten 
not only to crush one another, but to press the 
very life out of the unhappy student who enters 
the nursery; to the great detriment of all three. 
I speak in the presence of those who know 
practically what medical education is; for I may 
assume that a large proportion of my hearers are 
more or less advanced students of medicine. I 
appeal to the most industrious and conscientious 
among you, to those who are most deeply pene- 
trated with a sense of the extremely serious re- 
sponsibilities which attach to the calling of a med- 
ical practitioner, when I ask whether, out of the 
four years which you devote to your studies, you 
ought to spare even so much as an hour for any 
work which does not tend directly to fit you for 
your duties? 
Consider what that work is. Its foundation is 
a sound and practical acquaintance with the struc- 
ture of the human organism, and with the modes 
and conditions of its action in health. I say a 
sound and practical acquaintance, to guard against 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  yur UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 917 
the supposition that my intention is to suggest 
that you ought all to be minute anatomists and 
accomplished physiologists. The devotion of your 
whole four years to Anatomy and Physiology 
alone, would be totally insufficient to attain that 
end. What I mean is, the sort of practical, famil- 
iar, finger-end knowledge which a watchmaker has 
of a watch, and which you expect that craftsman, 
as an honest man, to have, when you entrust a 
watch that goes badly, to him. It is a kind of 
knowledge which is to be acquired, not in the 
lecture-room, nor in the library, but in the dis- 
secting-room and the laboratory. It is to be had 
not by sharing your attention between these and 
sundry other subjects, but by concentrating your 
minds, week after week, and month after month, 
“six or seven hours a day, upon all the com- 
plexities of organ and function, until each of the 
greater truths of anatomy and physiology has be- 
come an organic part of your minds—until you 
would know them if you were roused and ques- 
tioned in the middle of the night, as a man knows 
the geography of his native place and the daily 
life of his home. That is the sort of knowledge

If I had the power to remodel Medical Educa- 
tion, the first two years of the medical curriculum 
should be devoted to nothing but such thorough 
study of Anatomy and Physiology, with Physio- 
logical Chemistry and Physics; the student should 
then pass a real, practical examination in these 
subjects; and, having gone through that ordeal 
satisfactorily, he should be troubled no more 
with them. His whole mind should then be given 
with equal intentness to Therapeutics, in its 
broadest sense, to Practical Medicine and to 
Surgery, with instruction in Hygiene and in Med- 
ical Jurisprudence; and of these subjects only 
—surely there are enough of them—should he 
be required to show a knowledge in his final ex- 
amination. 
I cannot claim any special property in this 
theory of what the medical curriculum should be, 
for I find that views, more or less closely approxi- 
mating these, are held by all who have seriously 
considered the very grave and pressing question of 
Medical Reform; and have, indeed, been carried 
into practice, to some extent, by the most en- 
lightened Examining Boards. I have heard but 
two kinds of objections to them. There is first, 
the objection of vested interests, which I will not 
deal with here, because I want to make myself as 
pleasant as I can, and no discussions are so un- 
pleasant as those which turn on such points. And 
there is, secondly, the much more respectable ob-
-P-A-G-E-227
  
vir UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 919 
jection, which takes the general form of the re- 
proach that, in thus limiting the curriculum, we 
are seeking to narrow it. We are told that the 
medical man ought to be a person of good educa- 
tion and general information, if his profession is 
to hold its own among other professions; that he 
ought to know Botany, or else, if he goes abroad, 
he will not be able to tell poisonous fruits from 
edible ones; that he ought to know drugs, as a 
druggist knows them, or he will not be able to tell 
sham bark and senna from the real articles; that 
he ought to know Zoology, because—well, I really 
have never been able to learn exactly why he is to 
be expected to know zoology. There is, indeed, 
a popular superstition, that doctors know all about 
things that are queer or nasty to the general mind, 
and may, therefore, be reasonably expected to 
know the “barbarous binomials” applicable to 
snakes, snails, and slugs; an amount of informa- 
tion with which the general mind is usally com- 
pletely satisfied. And there is a scientific super- 
stition that Physiology is largely aided by Com- 
parative Anatomy—a superstition which, like 
most superstitions, once had a grain of truth at 
bottom; but the grain has become homeopathic, 
since Physiology took its modern experimental de- 
velopment, and became what it is now, the appli- 
cation of the principles of Physics and Chemistry 
to the elucidation of the phenomena of life. 
I hold as strongly as any one can do, that the
-P-A-G-E-228
  
290 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
medical practitioner ought to be a person of edu- 
cation and good general culture; but I also hold 
by the old theory of a Faculty, that a man should 
have his general culture before he devotes himself 
to the special studies of that Faculty; and I ven- 
ture to maintain, that, if the general culture ob- 
tained in the Faculty of Arts were what it ought 
to be, the student would have quite as much 
knowledge of the fundamental principles of Phys- 
ics, of Chemistry, and of Biology, as he needs, be- 
fore he commenced his special medical studies. 
Moreover, I would urge, that a thorough study 
of Human Physiology is, in itself, an education 
broader and more comprehensive than much that 
passes under that name. There is no side of the 
intellect which it does not call into play, no region 
of human knowledge into which either its roots, 
or its branches, do not extend; like the Atlantic 
between the Old and the New Worlds, its waves 
wash the shores of the two worlds of matter and 
of mind; its tributary streams flow from both; 
through its waters, as yet unfurrowed by the keel 
of any Columbus, lies the road, if such there be, 
from the one to the other; far away from that 
North-west Passage of mere speculation, in 
which so many brave souls have been hopelessly 
frozen up. 
But whether I am right or wrong about all 
this, the patent fact of the limitation of time re- 
mains. As the song runs:—
-P-A-G-E-229
  
vir UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 9291 
“Tf a man could be sure 
That his life would endure 
For the space of a thousand long years——” 
he might do a number of things not practicable 
under present conditions. Methuselah might, 
with much propriety, have taken half a century to 
get his doctor’s degree; and might, very fairly, 
have been required to pass a practical examination 
upon the contents of the British Museum, before 
commencing practice as a promising young fel- 
low of two hundred, or thereabouts. But you 
have four years to do your work in, and are turned 
loose, to save or slay, at two or three and twenty. 
Now, I put it to you, whether you think that, 
when you come down to the realities of life—when 
you stand by the sick-bed, racking your brains for 
the principles which shall furnish you with the 
means of interpreting symptoms, and forming a 
rational theory of the condition of your patient, it 
will be satisfactory for you to find that those 
principles are not there—although, to use the ex- 
amination slang which is unfortunately too famil- 
iar to me, you can quite easily “give an ac- 
count of the leading peculiarities of the Marsu- 
pialia,” or “ enumerate the chief characters of the 
Composite,” or “state the class and order of the 
animal from which Castoreum is obtained.” 
I really do not think that state of things will 
be satisfactory to you; I am very sure it will not 
be so to your patient. Indeed, I am so narrow-

minded myself, that if I had to choose between 
two physicians—one who did not know whether a 
whale is a fish or not, and could not tell gentian 
from ginger, but did understand the applications 
of the institutes of medicine to his art; while the 
other, like Talleyrand’s doctor, “ knew everything, 
even a little physic”—with all my love for 
breadth of culture, I should assuredly consult the 
former. 
It is not pleasant to incur the suspicion of an 
inclination to injure or depreciate particular 
branches of knowledge, but the fact that one of 
those which I should have no hesitation in ex- 
cluding from the medical curriculum, is that to 
which my own life has been specially devoted, 
should, at any rate, defend me from the suspicion 
of being urged to this course by any but the very 
gravest considerations of the public welfare. 
And I should like, further, to call your atten- 
tion to the important circumstance that, in thus 
proposing the exclusion of the study of such 
branches of knowledge as Zoology and Botany, 
from those compulsory upon the medical student, 
Iam not, for a moment, suggesting their exclusion 
from the University. I think that sound and 
practical instruction in the elementary facts and 
broad principles of Biology should form part of 
the Arts Curriculum: and here, happily, my the- 
ory is in entire accordance with your practice. 
Moreover, as I have already said, I have no sort of
-P-A-G-E-231

doubt that, in view of the relation of Physical Sci- 
ence to the practical life of the present day, it has 
the same right as Theology, Law, and Medicine, 
to a Faculty of its own in which men shall be 
trained to be professional men of science. It may 
be doubted whether Universities are the places for 
technical schools of Engineering or applied Chem- 
istry, or Agriculture. But there can surely be 
little question, that instruction in the branches 
of Science which lie at the foundation of these 
’ Arts, of a far more advanced and special character 
than could, with any propriety, be included in the 
ordinary Arts Curriculum, ought to be obtainable 
by means of a duly organised Faculty of Science in 
every University. 
The establishment of such a Faculty would 
have the additional advantage of providing, in 
some measure, for one of the greatest wants of our 
time and country. I mean the proper support and 
encouragement of original research. 
The other day, an emphatic friend of mine 
committed himself to the opinion that, in Eng- 
land, it is better for a man’s worldly prospects to 
be a drunkard, than to be smitten with the divine 
dipsomania of the original investigator. I am in- 
clined to think he was not far wrong. And, be it 
observed, that the question is not, whether such a 
man shall be able to make as much out of his 
abilities as his brother, of like ability, who goes 
into Law, or Engineering, or Commerce; it is not
-P-A-G-E-232
  994 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vu 
a question of “maintaining a due number of sad- 
dle horses,” as George Eliot somewhere puts it— 
it is a question of living or starving. 
If a student of my own subject shows power 
and originality, I dare not advise him to adopt 
a scientific career; for, supposing he is able to 
maintain himself until he has attained distinction, 
I cannot give him the assurance that any amount 
of proficiency in the Biological Sciences will be 
convertible into, even the most modest, bread and 
cheese. And I believe that the case is as bad, or’ 
erhaps worse, with other branches of Science. 
In this respect Britain, whose immense wealth 
and prosperity hang upon the thread of Applied 
Science, is far behind France, and infinitely be- 
hind Germany. 
And the worst of it is, that it is very difficult 
© see one’s way to any immediate remedy for this 
state of affairs which shall be free from a tendency 
0 become worse than the disease. 
Great schemes for the Endowment of Research 
have been proposed. It has been suggested, that 
Laboratories for all branches of Physical Science, 
rovided with every apparatus needed by the in- 
vestigator, shall be established by the State: and 
shall be accessible, under due conditions and regu- 
lations, to all properly qualified persons. I see 
no objection to the principle of such a proposal. 
If it be legitimate to spend great sums of money 
on public Libraries and public collections of Paint-  
-P-A-G-E-233
  vir UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 995 
ing and Sculpture, in aid of the Man of Letters, or 
the Artist, or for the mere sake of affording pleas- 
ure to the general public. I apprehend that it can- 
not be illegitimate to do as much for the promo- 
tion of scientific investigation. To take the lowest 
ground, as a mere investment of money, the latter 
is likely to be much more immediately profitable. 
To my mind, the difficulty in the way of such 
schemes is not theoretical, but practical. Given 
the laboratories, how are the investigators to be 
maintained? What career is open to those who 
have been thus encouraged to leave bread-winning 
pursuits? If they are to be provided for by endow- 
ment, we come back to the College Fellowship sys- 
tem, the results of which, for Literature, have not 
been so brilliant that one would wish to see it ex- 
tended to Science; unless some much better secur- 
ities than at present exist can be taken that it will 
foster real work. You know that among the Bees, 
it depends on the kind of cell in which the egg 
is deposited, and the quantity and quality of food 
which is supplied to the grub, whether it shall turn 
out a busy little worker or a big idle queen. And, 
in the human hive, the cells of the endowed larvee 
are always tending to enlarge, and their food to 
improve, until we get queens, beautiful to behold, 
but which gather no honey and build no comb. 
I do not say that these difficulties may not be 
overcome, but their gravity is not to be lightly 
estimated.   
    
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  926 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vim 
In the meanwhile, there is one step in the di- 
rection of the endowment of research which is free 
from such objections. It is possible to place the 
scientific enquirer in a position in which he shall 
have ample leisure and opportunity for original 
work, and yet shall give a fair and tangible equiva- 
ent for those privileges. The establishment of a 
Faculty of Science in every University, implies 
that of a corresponding number of Professorial 
chairs, the incumbents of which need not be so 
burdened with teaching as to deprive them of am- 
le leisure for original work. I do not think that 
it is any impediment to an original investigator to 
have to devote a moderate portion of his time to 
ecturing, or superintending practical instruction. 
On the contrary, I think it may be, and often is, a 
enefit to be obliged to take a comprehensive sur- 
vey of your subject; or to bring your results to a 
oint, and give them, as it were, a tangible objec- 
ive existence. The besetting sins of the investiga- 
tor are two: the one is the desire to put aside a 
subject, the general bearings of which he has mas- 
tered himself, and pass on to something which has 
he attraction of novelty; and the other, the desire 
or too much perfection, which leads him to 
“ Add and alter many times, 
Till all be ripe and rotten ;” 
o spend the energies which should be reserved for 
action in whitening the decks and polishing the 
guns.

The obligation to produce results for the in- 
struction of others, seems to me to be a more 
effectual check on these tendencies than even the 
love of usefulness or the ambition for fame. 
But supposing the Professorial forces of our 
University to be duly organised, there remains an 
important question, relating to the teaching power, 
to be considered. Is the Professorial system—the 
system, I mean, of teaching in the lecture-room 
alone, and leaving the student to find his own way 
when he is outside the lecture-room—adequate to 
the wants of learners? In answering this ques- 
tion, I confine myself to my own province, and I 
venture to reply for Physical Science, assuredly 
and undoubtedly, No. As I have already inti- 
mated, practical work in the Laboratory is absolute- 
ly indispensable, and that practical work must be 
guided and superintended by a sufficient staff of 
Demonstrators, who are for Science what Tutors 
are for other branches of study. And there must 
be a good supply of such Demonstrators. I doubt 
if the practical work of more than twenty students 
can be properly superintended by one Demon- 
strator. If we take the working day at six hours, 
that is less than twenty minutes apiece—not a 
very large allowance of time for helping a dull 
man, for correcting an inaccurate one, or even for 
making an intelligent student clearly apprehend 
what he is about. And, no doubt, the supplying 
of a proper amount of this tutorial, practical teach-
-P-A-G-E-236
  928 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
ing, is a difficulty in the way of giving proper in- 
struction in Physical Science in such Universities 
as that of Aberdeen, which are devoid of endow- 
ments; and, unlike the English Universities, have 
no moral claim on the funds of richly endowed 
bodies to supply their wants. 
Examination—thorough, searching examina- 
tion—is an indispensable accompaniment of teach- 
ing; but I am almost inclined to commit myself to 
the very heterodox proposition that it is a neces- 
sary evil. I am a very old Examiner, having, for 
some twenty years past, been occupied with exami- 
nations on a considerable scale, of all sorts and 
conditions of men, and women too,—from the 
boys and girls of elementary schools to the candi- 
dates for Honours and Fellowships in the Univer- 
sities. I will not say that, in this case as in so 
many others, the adage, that familiarity breeds 
contempt, holds good; but my admiration for the 
existing system of examination and its products, 
does not wax warmer as I see more of it. Exami- 
nation, like fire, is a good servant, but a bad mas- 
ter; and there seems to me to be some danger of 
its becoming our master. I by no means stand 
alone in this opinion. Experienced friends of 
mine do not hesitate to say that students whose 
career they watch, appear to them to become de- 
teriorated by the constant effort to pass this or that 
examination, just as we hear of men’s brains becom- 
ing affected by the daily necessity of catching a
-P-A-G-E-237
  vit UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 999 
train. They work to pass, not to know; and out- 
raged Science takes her revenge. They do pass, 
and they don’t know. I have passed sundry ex- 
aminations in my time, not without credit, and I 
confess I am ashamed to think how very little real 
knowledge underlay the torrent of stuff which I 
was able to pour out on paper. In fact, that which 
examination, as ordinarily conducted, tests, is sim- 
ply a man’s power of work under stimulus, and his 
capacity for rapidly and clearly producing that 
which, for the time, he has got into his mind. 
Now, these faculties are by no means to be de- 
spised. They are of great value in practical life, 
and are the making of many an advocate, and of 
many a so-called statesman. But in the pursuit 
of truth, scientific or other, they count for very 
little, unless they are supplemented by that long- 
continued, patient “intending of the mind,” as 
Newton phrased it, which makes very little show 
in Examinations. I imagine that an Examiner 
who knows his students personally, must not un- 
frequently have found himself in the position of 
finding A’s paper better than B’s, though his own 
judgment tells him, quite clearly, that B is the 
man who has the larger share of genuine capacity. 
Again, there is a fallacy about Examiners. It 
is commonly supposed that any one who knows a 
subject is competent to teach it; and no one seems 
to doubt that any one who knows a subject is 
competent to examine in it. I believe both these 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  930 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vutr 
opinions to be serious mistakes: the latter, per- 
haps, the more serious of the two. In the first 
place, I do not believe that any one who is not, 
or has not been, a teacher is really qualified to 
examine advanced students. And in the second 
place, Examination is an Art, and a difficult one, 
which has to be learned like all other arts. 
Beginners always set too difficult questions— 
partly because they are afraid of being suspected 
of ignorance if they set easy ones, and partly 
from not understanding their business. Suppose 
that you want to test the relative physical 
strength of a score of young men. You do not 
put a hundredweight down before them, and tell 
each to swing it round. If you do, half of them 
won’t be able to lift it at all, and only one or two 
will be able to perform the task. You must give 
them half a hundredweight, and see how they 
manceuvre that, if you want to form any estimate 
of the muscular strength of each. So, a practised 
Examiner will seek for information respecting the 
mental vigour and training of candidates from 
the way in which they deal with questions easy 
enough to let reason, memory, and method have 
free play. 
No doubt, a great deal is to be done by the 
careful selection of Examiners, and by the copious 
introduction of practical work, to remove the evils 
inseparable from examination; but, under the 
best of circumstances, I believe that examination
-P-A-G-E-239
vut UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL 931 
will remain but an imperfect test of knowledge, 
and a still more imperfect test of capacity, while 
it tells next to nothing about a man’s power as 
an investigator. 
There is much to be said in favour of restricting 
the highest degrees in each Faculty, to those who 
have shown evidence of such original power, by 
prosecuting a research under the eye of the 
Professor in whose province it lies; or, at any 
rate, under conditions which shall afford satis- 
factory proof that the work is theirs. The notion 
may sound revolutionary, but it is really very 
old; for, I take it, that it lies at the bottom of 
that presentation of a thesis by the candidate for 
a doctorate, which has now, too often, become 
little better than a matter of form. 
Thus far, I have endeavoured to lay before 
you, in a too brief and imperfect manner, my 
views respecting the teaching half—the Magistri 
and Regentes—of the University of the Future. 
Now let me turn to the learning half—the 
Scholares. 
If the Universities are to be the sanctuaries of 
the highest culture of the country, those who 
would enter that sanctuary must not come with 
unwashed hands. If the good seed is to yield its 
hundredfold harvest, it must not be scattered 
amidst the stones of ignorance, or the tares of 
undisciplined indolence and wantonness. On the 
1
-P-A-G-E-240
    
232 UNIVERSITIES: ACTUAL AND IDEAL vm 
contrary, the soil must have been carefully 
prepared, and the Professor should find that the 
operations of clod-crushing, draining, and weed- 
ing, and even a good deal of planting, have been 
done by the Schoolmaster. 
That is exactly what the Professor does not 
find in any University in the three Kingdoms 
that I can hear of—the reason of which state of 
things lies in the extremely faulty organisation of 
the majority of secondary schools. Students 
come to the Universities ill-prepared in classics 
and mathematics, not at all prepared in anything 
else; and half their time is spent in learning that 
which they ought to have known when they 
came. 
I sometimes hear it said that the Scottish 
Universities differ from the English, in being to 
a much greater extent places of comparatively ele- 
mentary education for a younger class of students. 
But it would seem doubtful if any great dif- 
ference of this kind really exists; for a high au- 
thority, himself Head of an English College, has 
solemnly affirmed that: “Elementary teaching 
of youths under twenty is now the only func- 
tion performed by the University;” and that 
Colleges are “boarding schools in which the 
elements of the learned languages are taught to 
youths.” *

This is not the first time that I have quoted 
those remarkable assertions. I should like to en- 
grave them in public view, for they have not been 
refuted; and I am convinced that if their import 
is once clearly apprehended, they will play no 
mean part when the question of University re- 
organisation, with a view to practical measures, 
comes on for discussion. You are not responsible 
for this anomalous state of affairs now; but, as 
you pass into active life and acquire the political 
influence to which your education and your 
position should entitle you, you will become 
responsible for it, unless each in his sphere does 
his best to alter it, by insisting on the improve- 
ment of secondary schools. 
Your present responsibility is of another, 
though not less serious, kind. Institutions do 
not make men, any more than organisation makes 
life; and even the ideal University we have been 
dreaming about will be but a superior piece of 
mechanism, unless each student strive after the 
ideal of the Scholar. And that ideal, it seems to 
me, has never been better embodied than by the

by no conditions save these:—That the principal 
shall not be employed in building: that the funds 
shall be appropriated, in equal proportions, to the 
promotion of natural knowledge and to the 
alleviation of the bodily sufferings of mankind; 
and, finally, that neither political nor ecclesias- 
tical sectarianism shall be permitted to disturb 
the impartial distribution of the testator’s bene- 
factions. 
In my experienec of life a truth which sounds 
very much like a paradox has often asserted itself: 
namely, that a man’s worst difficulties begin when 
he is able to do as he likes. So long as a man 
is struggling with obstacles he has an excuse for 
failure or shortcoming; but when fortune removes 
them all and gives him the power of doing as 
he thinks best, then comes the time of trial. 
There is but one right, and the possibilities of 
wrong are infinite. I doubt not that the trustees 
of the Johns Hopkins University felt the full 
force of this truth when they entered on the 
administration of their trust a year and a half 
ago; and I can but admire the activity and 
resolution which have enabled them, aided by the 
,able president whom they have selected, to lay 
down the great outlines of their plan, and carry 
_it thus far into execution. It is impossible to 
study that plan without perceiving that great care, 
forethought, and sagacity, have been bestowed 
upon it, and that it demands the most respect-

ful consideration. JI have been endeavouring to 
ascertain how far the principles which underlie 
it are in accordance with those which have been 
established in my own mind by much and long- 
continued thought upon educational questions. 
Permit me to place before you the result of my re- 
flections. 
Under one aspect a university is a particular 
kind of educational institution, and the views 
which we may take of the proper nature of a uni- 
versity are corollaries from those which we hold 
respecting education in general. I think it must 
be admitted that the school should prepare for 
the university, and that the university should 
crown the edifice, the foundations of which are 
laid in the school. University education should 
not be something distinct from elementary edu- 
cation, but should be the natural outgrowth and 
development of the latter. Now I have a very 
clear conviction as to what elementary education 
ought to be; what it really may be, when properly 
organised; and what I think it will be, before 
many years have passed over our heads, in Eng- 
land and in America. Such education should 
enable an average boy of fifteen or sixteen to 
read and write his own language with ease and 
accuracy, and with a sense of literary excellence 
derived from the study of our classic writers: 
to have a general acquaintance with the history 
of his own country and with the great laws of 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
238 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION — 1x 
social existence; to have acquired the rudiments 
of the physical and psychological sciences, and 
a fair knowledge of elementary arithmetic and 
geometry. He should have obtained an acquaint- 
ance with logic rather by example than by precept; 
while the acquirement of the elements of music 
and drawing should have been pleasure rather 
than work. 
It may sound strange to many ears if I venture 
to maintain the proposition that a young person, 
educated thus far, has had a liberal, though per- 
haps not a full, education. But it seems to me 
that such training as that to which I have re- 
ferred may be termed liberal, in both the senses in 
which that word is employed, with perfect accu- 
racy. In the first place, it is liberal in breadth. It 
extends over the whole ground of things to be 
known and of faculties to be trained, and it gives 
equal importance to the two great sides of human 
activity—art and science. In the second place, 
it is liberal in the sense of being an education 
fitted for free men; for men to whom every career 
is open, and from whom their country may demand 
that they should be fitted to perform the duties 
of any career. I cannot too strongly impress 
upon you the fact that, with such a primary edu- 
cation as this, and with no more than is to be 
obtained by building strictly upon its lines, a man 
of ability may become a great writer or speaker, 
a statesman, a lawyer, a man of science, painter,
-P-A-G-E-247
1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 939 
sculptor, architect, or musician. That even de- 
velopment of all a man’s faculties, which is what 
properly constitutes culture, may be effected by 
such an education, while it opens the way for the 
indefinite strengthening of any special capabilities 
with which he may be gifted. 
In a country like this, where most men have 
to carve out their own fortunes and devote them- 
selves early to the practical affairs of life, com- 
paratively few can hope to pursue their studies 
up to, still less beyond, the age of manhood. But 
it is of vital importance to the welfare of the 
community that those who are relieved from the 
need of making a livelihood, and still more, those 
who are stirred by the divine impulses of intellec- 
tual thirst or artistic genius, should be enabled to 
devote themselves to the higher service of their 
kind, as centres of intelligence, interpreters of 
Nature, or creators of new forms of beauty. And 
it is the function of a university to furnish such 
men with the means of becoming that which it is 
their privilege and duty to be. To this end the 
university need cover no ground foreign to that 
occupied by the elementary school. Indeed it 
cannot; for the elementary instruction which I 
have referred to embraces all the kinds of real 
knowledge and mental activity possible to man. 
The university can add no new departments of 
knowledge, can offer no new fields of mental 
activity; but what it can do is to intensify and
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
specialise the instruction in each department. 
Thus literature and philology, represented in the 
elementary school by English alone, in the uni- 
versity will extend over the ancient and modern 
languages. History, which, like charity, best be- 
gins at home, but, like charity, should not end 
there, will ramify into anthropology, archeology, 
political history, and geography, with the history 
of the growth of the human mind and of its pro- 
ducts in the shape of philosophy, science, and art. 
And the university will present to the student 
libraries, museums of antiquities, collections of 
coins, and the like, which will efficiently subserve 
these studies. Instruction in the elements of 
social economy, a most essential, but hitherto 
sadly-neglected part of elementary education, will 
develop in the university into political economy, 
sociology, and law. Physical science will have 
its great divisions of physical geography, with 
geology and astronomy; physics; chemistry and 
biology; represented not merely by professors and 
their lectures, but by laboratories, in which the 
students, under guidance of demonstrators, will 
work out facts for themselves and come into that 
direct contact with reality which constitutes the 
fundamental distinction of scientific education. 
Mathematics will soar into its highest regions; 
while the high peaks of philosophy may be scaled 
by those whose aptitude for abstract thought has 
been awakened by elementary logic. ~ Finally,
-P-A-G-E-249
  
1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 941 
schools of pictorial and plastic art, of architecture, 
and of music, will offer a thorough discipline 
in the principles and practice of art to those in 
whom lies nascent the rare faculty of esthetic 
representation, or the still rarer powers of creative 
genius. 
The primary school and the university are 
the alpha and omega of education. Whether 
institutions intermediate between these  (so- 
called secondary schools) should exist, appears 
to me to be a question of practical con- 
venience. If such schools are established, the 
important thing is that they should be true in- 
termediaries between the primary school and the 
university, keeping’ on the wide track of general 
culture, and not sacrificing one branch of knowl- 
edge for another. 
Such appear to me to be the broad outlines of 
the relations which the university, regarded as a 
place of education, ought to bear to the school, but 
a number of points of detail require some consid- 
eration, however briefly and imperfectly I can deal 
with them. In the first place, there is the impor- 
tant question of the limitations which should be 
fixed to the entrance into the university; or, what 
qualifications should be required of those who pro- 
pose to take advantage of the higher training 
offered by the university. On the one hand, it 
is obviously desirable that the time and oppor- 
tunities of the university should not be wasted 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
mee TT ee re am 
242 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
in conferring such elementary instruction as can 
be obtained elsewhere; while, on the other hand, 
it is no less desirable that the higher instruction 
of the university should be made accessible to 
every one who can take advantage of it, although 
he may not have been able to go through any 
very extended course of education. My own feel- 
ing is distinctly against any absolute and defined 
preliminary examination, the passing of which 
shall be an essential condition of admission to the 
university. I would admit to the university any 
one who could be reasonably expected to profit by 
the instruction offered to him; and I should be in- 
clined, on the whole, to test the fitness of the stu- 
dent, not by examination before he enters the uni- 
versity, but at the end of his first term of study. 
If, on examination in the branches of knowledge to 
which he has devoted himself, he show himself 
deficient in industry or in capacity, it will be best 
for the university and best for himself, to prevent 
him from pursuing a vocation for which he is 
obviously unfit. And I hardly know of any other 
method than this by which his fitness or unfitness 
can be safely ascertained, though no doubt a good 
deal may be done, not by formal cut and dried 
examination, but by judicious questioning, at the 
outset of his career. 
Another very important and difficult practical 
question is, whether a definite course of study 
shall be laid down for those who enter the
-P-A-G-E-251
1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 9243 
university; whether a curriculum shall be pre- 
scribed; or whether the student shall be allowed 
to range at will among the subjects which are 
open to him. And this question is inseparably 
connected with another, namely, the conferring of 
degrees. It is obviously impossible that any 
student should pass through the whole of the 
series of courses of instruction offered by a uni- 
versity. If a degree is to be conferred as a mark 
of proficiency in knowledge, it must be given on 
the ground that the candidate is proficient in a 
certain fraction of those studies; and then will 
arise the necessity of insuring an equivalency of, 
degrees, so that the course by which a degreé 
is obtained shall mark approximately an equal 
amount of labour and of acquirements, in all 
cases. But this equivalency can hardly be secured 
in any other way than by prescribing a series 
of definite lines of study. This is a matter 
which will require grave consideration. The im- 
portant points to bear in mind, I think, are that 
there should not be too many subjects in the 
curriculum, and that the aim should be the 
attainment of thorough and sound knowledge of 
each. 
One half of the Johns Hopkins bequest is 
devoted to the establishment of a hospital, and 
it was the desire of the testator that the uni- 
versity and the hospital should co-operate in the 
promotion of medical education. The trustees
-P-A-G-E-252
244. ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION ix 
will unquestionably take the best advice that is 
to be had as to the construction and administra- 
tion of the hospital. In respect to the former 
point, they will doubtless remember that. a 
hospital may be so arranged as to kill more than 
it cures; and, in regard to the latter, that a 
hospital may spread the spirit of pauperism 
among the well-to-do, as well as relieve the suf- 
ferings of the destitute. It is not for me to 
speak on these topics—rather let me confine 
myself to the one matter on which my experience 
as a student of medicine, and an examiner of long 
standing, who has taken a great interest in the 
subject of medical education, may entitle me to 
a hearing. I mean the nature of medical educa- 
tion itself, and the co-operation of the university 
in its promotion. 
What is the object of medical education? It 
is to enable the practitioner, on the one hand, to 
prevent disease by his knowledge of hygiene; on 
the other hand, to divine its nature, and to 
alleviate or cure it, by his knowledge of pathology, 
therapeutics, and practical medicine. That is his 
business in life, and if he has not a thorough and 
practical knowledge of the conditions of health, 
of the causes which tend to the establishment 
of disease, of the meaning of symptoms, and of 
the uses of medicines and operative appliances, 
he is incompetent, even if he were the best 
anatomist, or physiologist, or chemist, that ever 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 9245 
took a gold medal or won a prize certificate. This 
is one great truth respecting medical education. 
Another is, that all practice in medicine is based 
upon theory of some sort or other; and there- 
fore, that it is desirable to have such theory 
in the closest possible accordance with fact. The 
veriest empiric who gives a drug in one case be- 
cause he has seen it do good in another of 
apparently the same sort, acts upon the theory 
that similarity of superficial symptoms means 
similarity of lesions; which, by the way, is per- 
haps as wild an hypothesis as could be invented. 
To understand the nature of disease we must 
understand health, and the understanding of the 
healthy body means the having a knowledge of 
its structure and of the way in which its manifold 
actions are performed, which is what is technically 
termed human anatomy and human physiology. 
The physiologist again must needs possess an 
acquaintance with physics and chemistry, inas- 
much as physiology is, to a great extent, applied 
physics and chemistry. For ordinary purposes a 
limited amount of such knowledge is all that is 
needful; but for the pursuit of the higher 
branches of physiology no knowledge of these 
branches of science can be too extensive, or too 
profound. Again, what we call therapeutics, 
which has to do with the action of drugs and 
medicines on the living organism, is, strictly 
speaking, a branch of experimental physiology,
-P-A-G-E-254
246 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION ix 
and is daily receiving a greater and greater ex- 
perimental development. 
The third great fact which is to be taken into 
consideration in dealing with medical education, 
is that the practical necessities of life do not, as 
a rule, allow aspirants to medical practice to give 
more than three, or it may be four years to their 
studies. Let us put it at four years, and then 
reflect that, in the course of this time, a young 
man fresh from school has to acquaint himself 
with medicine, surgery, obstetrics, therapeutics, 
pathology, hygiene, as well as with the anatomy 
and the physiology of the human body; and that 
his knowledge should be of such a character that 
it can be relied upon in any emergency, and 
always ready for practical application. Consider, 
in addition, that the medical practitioner may be 
called upon, at any moment, to give evidence in a 
court of justice in a criminal case; and that it is 
therefore well that he should know something of 
the laws of evidence, and of what we call medical 
jurisprudence. On a medical certificate, a man 
may be taken from his home and from his busi- 
ness and confined in a lunatic asylum; surely, 
therefore, it is desirable that the medical practi- 
tioner should have some rational and clear con- 
ceptions as to the nature and symptoms of mental 
disease. Bearing in mind all these requirements 
of medical education, you will admit that the 
burden on the young aspirant for the medical
-P-A-G-E-255
  xx ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 947 
profession is somewhat of the heaviest, and that 
it needs some care to prevent his intellectual back 
from being broken. 
Those who are acquainted with the existing 
systems of medical education will observe that, 
long as is the catalogue of studies which I have 
enumerated, I have omitted to mention several 
that enter into the usual medical curriculum of the 
present day. I have said not a word about zoology, 
comparative anatomy, botany, or materia medica. 
Assuredly this is from no light estimate of the 
value or importance of such studies in themselves. 
It may be taken for granted that I should be the 
last person in the world to object to the teaching 
of zoology, or comparative anatomy, in themselves; 
but I have the strongest feeling that, considering 
the number and the gravity of those studies 
through which a medical man must pass, if he is to 
be competent to discharge the serious duties which 
devolve upon him, subjects which lie so remote as 
these do from his practical pursuits should be 
rigorously excluded. The young man, who has 
enough to do in order to acquire such familiarity 
with the structure of the human body as will enable 
him to perform the operations of surgery, ought 
not, in my judgment, to be occupied with investi- 
gations into the anatomy of crabs and starfishes. 
Undoubtedly the doctor should know the common 
poisonous plants of his own country when he sees 
them; but that knowledge may be obtained by a 
76
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION ix 
few hours devoted to the examination of specimens 
of such plants, and the desirableness of such 
knowledge is no justification, to my mind, for 
spending three months over the study of systematic 
botany. Again, materia medica, so far as it is a 
knowledge of drugs, is the business of the druggist. 
In all other callings the necessity of the division of 
labour is fully recognised, and it is absurd to re- 
quire of the medical man that he should not avail 
himself of the special knowledge of those whose 
business it is to deal in the drugs which he uses. 
It is all very well that the physician should know 
that castor oil comes from a plant, and castoreum 
from an animal, and how they are to be prepared; 
but for all the practical purposes of his profession 
that knowledge is not of one whit more value, has 
no more relevancy, than the knowledge of how the 
steel of his scalpel is made. 
All knowledge is good. It is impossible to say 
that any fragment of knowledge, however insignifi- 
cant or remote from one’s ordinary pursuits, may 
not some day be turned to account. But in medical 
education, above all things, it is to be recollected 
that, in order to know a little well, one must be 
content to be ignorant of a great deal. 
Let it not be supposed that I am proposing to 
narrow medical education, or, as the cry is, to lower 
the standard of the profession. Depend upon it 
there is only one way of really ennobling any call- 
ing, and that is to make those who pursue it real
-P-A-G-E-257
  1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 949 
masters of their craft, men who can truly do that 
which they profess to be able to do, and which they 
are credited with being able to do by the public. 
And there is no position so ignoble as that of 
the so-called “liberally-educated practitioner,” 
who may be able to read Galen in the original; 
who knows all the plants, from the cedar of 
Lebanon to the hyssop upon the wall; but who 
finds himself, with the issues of life and death 
in his hands, ignorant, blundering, and _be- 
wildered, because of his ignorance of the essential 
and fundamental truths upon which practice 
must be based. Moreover, I venture to say, that 
any man who has seriously studied all the 
essential branches of medical knowledge; who 
has the needful acquaintance with the elements 
of physical science; who has been brought by 
medical jurisprudence into contact with law; 
whose study of insanity has taken him into the 
fields of psychology; has ipso facto received a 
liberal education. 
Having lightened the medical curriculum by 
culling out of it everything which is unessential, 
we may next consider whether something may not 
be done to aid the medical student toward the 
acquirement of real knowledge by modifying the 
system of examination. In England, within my 
recollection, it was the practice to require of the 
medical student attendance on lectures upon the 
most diverse topics during three years; so that it
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
often happened that he would have to listen, in the 
course of a day, to four or five lectures upon totally 
different subjects, in addition to the hours given to 
dissection and to hospital practice: and he was 
required to keep all the knowledge he could pick 
up, in this distracting fashion, at examination 
point, until, at the end of three years, he was set 
down to a table and questioned pell-mell upon all 
the different matters with which he had been 
striving to make acquaintance. A worse system 
and one more calculated to obstruct the acquisition 
of sound knowledge and to give full play to the 
“ crammer ” and the “ grinder” could hardly have 
been devised by human ingenuity. Of late years 
great reforms have taken place. Examinations 
have been divided so as to diminish the number of 
subjects among which the attention has to be dis- 
tributed. Practical examination has been largely 
introduced; but there still remains, even under the 
present system, too much of the old evil insepara- 
ble from the contemporaneous pursuit of a multi- 
plicity of diverse studies. 
Proposals have recently been made to get iia 
of general examinations altogether, to permit the 
student to be examined in each subject at the end 
of his attendance on the class; and then, in case of 
the result being satisfactory, to allow him to have 
done with it; and I may say that this method has 
been pursued for many years in the Royal School 
of Mines in London, and has been found to work
-P-A-G-E-259
  e 
1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 951 
very well. It allows the student to concentrate 
his mind upon what he is about for the time being, 
and then to dismiss it. Those who are occupied 
in intellectual work, will, I think, agree with me 
that it is important, not so much to know a thing, 
as to have known it, and known it thoroughly. 
If you have once known a thing in this way it is 
easy to renew your knowledge when you have 
forgotten it; and when you begin to take the sub- 
ject up again, it slides back upon the familiar 
grooves with great facility. 
Lastly comes the question as to how the uni- 
versity may co-operate in advancing medical edu- 
cation. A medical school is strictly a technical 
school—a school in which a practical profession is 
taught—while a university ought to be a place in 
which knowledge is obtained without direct refer- 
ence to professional purposes. It is clear, there- 
fore, that a university and its antecedent, the 
school, may best co-operate with the medical 
school by making due provision for the study of 
those branches of knowledge which lie at the 
foundation of medicine. 
At present, young men come to the medical 
schools without a conception of even the elements 
of physical science; they learn, for the first time, 
that there are such sciences as physics, chemistry, 
and physiology, and are introduced to anatomy as 
a new thing. It may be safely said that, with a 
large proportion of medical students, much of the  
-P-A-G-E-260
3 
252 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
first session is wasted in learning how to learn 
—in familiarising themselves with utterly strange 
conceptions, and in awakening their dormant and 
wholly untrained powers of observation and of 
manipulation. It is difficult to over-estimate the 
magnitude of the obstacles which are thrown in 
the way of scientific training by the existing 
system of school education. Not only are men 
trained in mere book-work, ignorant of what 
observation means, but the habit of learning from 
books alone begets a disgust of observation. ‘The 
book-learned student will rather trust to what he 
sees in a book than to the witness of his own 
eyes. 
There is not the least reason why this should 
be so, and, in fact, when elementary education 
becomes that which I have assumed it ought to 
be, this state of things will no longer exist. 
There is not the slightest difficulty in giving 
sound elementary instruction in physics, in chem- 
istry, and in the elements of human physiology, 
in ordinary schools. In other words, there is no 
reason why the student should not come to the 
medical school, provided with as much knowledge 
of these several sciences as he ordinarily picks up 
in the course of his first year of attendance at the 
medical school. 
I am not saying this without full practical 
justification for the statement. For the last 
eighteen years we have had in England a system
-P-A-G-E-261
  ix ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 953 
of elementary science teaching carried out under 
the auspices of the Science and Art Department, 
by which elementary scientific instruction is made 
readily accessible to the scholars of all the ele- 
mentary schools in the country. Commencing 
with small beginnings, carefully developed and 
improved, that system now brings up for examina- 
tion as many as seven thousand scholars in the 
subject of human physiology alone. I can say 
that, out of that number, a large proportion have 
acquired a fair amount of substantial knowledge; 
and that no inconsiderable percentage show as 
good an acquaintance with human physiology as 
used to be exhibited by the average candidates 
for medical degrees in the University of London, 
when I was first an examiner there twenty years 
ago; and quite as much knowledge as is possessed 
by the ordinary student of medicine at the present 
day. I am justified, therefore, in looking forward 
to the time when the student who proposes to 
devote himself to medicine will come, not abso- 
lutely raw and inexperienced as he is at present, 
but in a certain state of preparation for further 
study; and I look to the university to help him 
still further forward in that stage of preparation, 
through the organisation of its biological depart- 
ment. Here the student will find means of 
acquainting himself with the phenomena of life 
in their broadest acceptation. He will study not 
botany and zoology, which, as I have said, would
-P-A-G-E-262
  254 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
take him too far away from his ultimate goal; 
but, by duly arranged instruction, combined with 
work in the laboratory upon the leading types of 
animal and vegetable life, he will lay a broad, and 
at the same time solid, foundation of biological 
knowledge; he will come to his medical studies 
with a comprehension of the great truths of 
morphology and of physiology, with his hands 
trained to dissect and his eyes taught to see. I 
have no hesitation in saying that such preparation 
is worth a full year added on to the medical 
curriculum. In other words, it will set free that 
much time for attention to those studies which 
bear directly upon the student’s most grave and 
serious duties as a medical practitioner. 
Up to this point I have considered only the 
teaching aspect of your great foundation, that 
function of the university in virtue of which it 
plays the part of a reservoir of ascertained truth, 
so far as our symbols can ever interpret nature. 
All can learn; all can drink of this lake. It is 
given to few to add to the store of knowledge, 
to strike new springs of thought, or to shape new 
forms of beauty. But so sure as it is that men 
live not by bread, but by ideas, so sure is it 
that the future of the world lies in the hands of 
those who are able to carry the interpretation 
of nature a step further than their predecessors; 
so certain is it that the highest function of a 
university is to seek out those men, cherish them,
-P-A-G-E-263
  1x ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 955 
and give their ability to serve their kind full 
play. 
I rejoice to observe that the encouragement of 
research occupies so prominent a place in your 
official documents, and in the wise and liberal in- 
augural address of your president. This subject 
of the encouragement, or, as it is sometimes called, 
the endowment of research, has of late years 
greatly exercised the minds of men in England. 
It was one of the main topics of discussion by 
the members of the Royal Commission of whom 
I was one, and who not long since issued their 
report, after five years’ labour. Many seem to 
think that this question is mainly one of money; 
that you can go into the market and buy research, 
and that supply will follow demand, as in the 
ordinary course of commerce. This view does not 
commend itself to my mind. I know of no more 
difficult practical problem than the discovery of a 
method of encouraging and supporting the origi- 
nal investigator without opening the door to nepo- 
tism and jobbery. My own conviction is admirably 
summed up in the passage of your president’s 
address, “that the best investigators are usually 
those who have also the responsibilities of instruc- 
tion, gaining thus the incitement of colleagues, 
the encouragement of pupils, and the observation 
of the public.” 
At the commencement of this address I ven- 
tured to assume that I might, if I thought fit, criti-
-P-A-G-E-264
  256 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
cise the arrangements which have been made by 
the board of trustees, but I confess that I have 
little to do but to applaud them. Most wise and 
sagacious seems to me the determination not to 
build for the present. It has been my fate to 
see great educational funds fossilise into mere 
bricks and mortar, in the petrifying springs of 
architecture, with nothing left to work the institu- 
tion they were intended to support. <A great 
warrior is said to have made a desert and called 
it peace. Administrators of educational funds 
have sometimes made a palace and called it a 
university. If I may venture to give advice in a 
matter which lies out of my proper competency, 
I would say that whenever you do build, get an 
honest bricklayer, and make him: build you just 
such rooms as you really want, leaving ample 
space for expansion. And a century hence, when 
the Baltimore and Ohio shares are at one thousand 
premium, and you have endowed all the professors 
you need and built all the laboratories that are 
wanted, and have the best museum and the 
finest library that can be imagined; then, if you 
have a few hundred thousand dollars you don’t 
know what to do with, send for an architect and 
tell him to put up a facade. If American is 
similar to English experience, any other course 
will probably lead you into having some stately 
structure, good for your architect’s fame, but not 
in the least what you want. 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  
ix ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 9547 
It appears to me that what I have ventured to 
lay down as the principles which should govern 
the relations of a university to education in 
general, are entirely in accordance with the 
measures you have adopted. You have set no 
restrictions upon access to the instruction you pro- 
pose to give; you have provided that such instruc- 
tion, either as given by the university or by asso- 
ciated institutions, should cover the field of human 
intellectual activity. You have recognised the 
importance of encouraging research. You pro- 
pose to provide means by which young men, 
who may be full of zeal for a literary or for 
a scientific career, but who also may have mis- 
taken aspiration for inspiration, may bring their 
capacities to a test, and give their powers a fair 
trial. If such a one fail, his endowment termi- 
nates, and there is no harm done. If he succeed, 
you may give power of flight to the genius of a 
Davy or a Faraday, a Carlyle or a Locke, whose in- 
fluence on the future of his fellow-men shall be 
absolutely incalculable. 
You have enunciated the principle that “the 
glory of the university should rest upon the 
character of the teachers and scholars, and not 
upon their numbers of buildings constructed for 
their use.” And I look upon it es an essential 
and most important feature of your plan that 
the income of the professors and teachers shall be 
independent of the number of students whom
-P-A-G-E-266
  958 ADDRESS ON UNIVERSITY EDUCATION 1x 
they can attract. In this way you provide against 
the danger, patent elsewhere, of finding attempts 
at improvement obstructed by vested interests; 
and, in the department of medical education 
especially, you are free of the temptation to set 
loose upon the world men utterly incompetent to 
perform the serious and responsible duties of their 
profession. 
It is a delicate matter for a stranger to the 
practical working of your institutions, like myself, 
to pretend to give an opinion as to the organisation 
of your governing power. I can conceive nothing 
better than that it should remain as it is, if you can 
secure a succession of wise, liberal, honest, and con- 
scientious men to fill the vacancies that occur 
among you. I do not greatly believe in the efficacy 
of any kind of machinery for securing such a 
result; but I would venture to suggest that the 
exclusive adoption of the method of co-optation for 
filling the vacancies which must occur in your 
body, appears to me to be somewhat like a tempt- 
ing of Providence. Doubtless there are grave 
practical objections to the appointment of persons 
outside of your body and not directly interested 
in the welfare of the university; but might it not 
be well if there were an understanding that your 
academic staff should be officially represented on 
the board, perhaps even the heads of one or two 
independent learned bodies, so that academic 
opinion and the views of the outside world might

have a certain influence in that most important 
matter, the appointment of your professors? I 
throw out these suggestions, as I have said, in 
ignorance of the practical difficulties that may lie 
in the way of carrying them into effect, on the 
general ground that personal and local influences 
are very subtle, and often unconscious, while the 
future greatness and efficiency of the noble institu- 
tion which now commences its work must largely 
depend upon its freedom from them. 
I constantly hear Americans speak of the charm 
which our old mother country has for them, of the 
delight with which they wander through the 
streets of ancient towns, or climb the battlements 
of medieval strongholds, the names of which are 
indissolubly associated with the great epochs of 
that noble literature which is our common inherit- 
ance; or with the blood-stained steps of that secu- 
lar progress, by which the descendants of the sav- 
age Britons and of the wild pirates of the North 
Sea have become converted into warriors of order 
and champions of peaceful freedom, exhausting 
what still remains of the old Berserk spirit in sub- 
duing nature, and turning the wilderness into a 
garden. But anticipation has no less charm than _ 
retrospect, and to an Englishman landing upon 
your shores for the first time, travelling for hun- 
dreds of miles through strings of great and well- 
ordered cities, seeing your enormous actual, and

almost infinite potential,wealth in all commodities, 
and in the energy and ability which turn wealth to 
account, there is something sublime in the vista of 
the future. Do not suppose that I am pandering 
to what is commonly understood by national pride. 
I cannot say that I am in the slightest degree im- 
pressed by your bigness, or your material resources, 
as such. Size is not grandeur, and territory does 
not make a nation. The great issue, about which 
hangs a true sublimity, and the terror of over- 
hanging fate, is what are you going to do with all 
these things? What is to be the end to which 
these are to be the means? You are making a 
novel experiment in politics on the greatest scale 
which the world has yet seen. Forty millions at 
your first centenary, it is reasonably to be expected 
that, at the second, these states will be occupied 
by two hundred millions of English-speaking peo- 
ple, spread over an area as large as that of Europe, 
and with climates and interests as diverse as those 
of Spain and Scandinavia, England and Russia. 
You and your descendants have to ascertain 
whether this great mass will hold together under 
the forms of a republic, and the despotic reality of 
universal suffrage; whether state rights will hold 
out against centralisation, without separation. 
whether centialisation will get the better, without 
actual or disguised monarchy; whether shifting 
corruption is better than a permanent bureauc- 
racy; and as population thickens in your great

cities, and the pressure of want is felt, the gaunt 
spectre of pauperism will stalk among you, and 
communism and socialism will claim to be heard. 
Truly America has a great future before her; great 
in toil, in care, and in responsibility; great in true 
glory if she be guided in wisdom and righteous- 
ness; great in shame if she fail. I cannot under- 
stand why other nations should envy you, or be 
blind to the fact that it is for the highest interest 
of mankind that you should succeed; but the one 
condition of success, your sole safeguard, is the 
moral worth and intellectual clearness of the in- 
dividual citizen. Education cannot give these, but 
it may cherish them and bring them to the front 
in whatever station of society they are to be found; 
and the universities ought to be, and may be, the 
fortresses of the higher life of the nation. 
May the university which commences its practi- 
cal activity to-morrow abundantly fulfil its high 
purpose; may its renown as a seat of true learning, 
a centre of free inquiry, a focus of intellectual 
light, increase year by year, until men wander 
hither from all parts of the earth, as of old they 
sought Bologna, or Paris, or Oxford. 
And it is pleasant to me to fancy that, among 
the English students who are drawn to you at that 
time, there may linger a dim tradition that a 
countryman of theirs was permitted to address you 
as he has done to-day, and to feel as if your hopes 
were his hopes and your success his joy.

ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 
[1876] 
Ir is my duty to-night to speak about the study 
of Biology, and while it may be that there are 
many of my audience who are quite familiar with 
that study, yet as a lecturer of some standing, it 
would, I know by experience, be very bad policy 
on my part to suppose such to be extensively the 
case. On the contrary, I must imagine that there 
are many of you who would like to know what 
Biology is; that there are others who have that 
amount of information, but would nevertheless 
gladly hear why it should be worth their while to 
study Biology; and yet others, again, to whom 
these two points are clear, but who desire to learn 
how they had best study it, and, finally, when they 
had best study it. 
I shall, therefore, address myself to the en- 
262
-P-A-G-E-271
  x ON THE $7 JDY OF BIOLOGY 263 
deavour to give you some answer to these four 
questions—what Biology is; why it should be 
studied; how it should be studied; and when it 
should be studied. 
In the first place, in respect to what Biology 
is, there are, I believe, some persons who imagine 
that the term “ Biology” is simply a new-fangled 
denomination, a neologism in short, for what used 
to be known under the title of “Natural His- 
tory”; but I shall try to show you, on the con- 
trary, that the word is the expression of the growth 
of science during the last 200 years, and came into 
existence half a century ago. 
At the revival of learning, knowledge was di- 
vided into two kinds—the knowledge of nature 
and the knowledge of man; for it was the current 
idea then (and a great deal of that ancient con- 
ception still remains) that there was a sort of 
essential antithesis, not to say antagonism, be- 
tween nature and man; and that the two had not 
very much to do with one another, except that the 
one was oftentimes exceedingly troublesome to the 
other. Though it is one of the salient merits of 
our great philosophers of the seventeenth century, 
that they recognised but one scientific method, 
applicable alike to man and to nature, we find 
this notion of the existence of a broad distinction 
between nature and man,in the writings both of 
Bacon and of Hobbes of Malmesbury; and I have 
brought with me that famous work which is now 
qT  
-P-A-G-E-272
  264 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
so little known, greatly as it deserves to be studied, 
“The Leviathan,” in order that I may put to you 
in the wonderfully terse and clear language of 
Thomas Hobbes, what was his view of the matter. 
He says:— 
“The register of knowledge of fact is called 
history. Whereof there be two sorts, one called 
natural history; which is the history of such facts 
or effects of nature as have no dependence on 
man’s will; such as are the histories of metals, 
plants, animals, regions, and the like. The other 
is civil history; which is the history of the volun- 
tary actions of men in commonwealths.” 
So that all history of fact was divided into 
these two great groups of natural and of civil his- 
tory. The Royal Society was in course of founda- 
tion about the time that Hobbes was writing this 
book, which was published in 1651; and that So- 
ciety was termed a “ Society for the Improvement 
of Natural Knowledge,” which was then nearly 
the same thing as a “Society for the Improve- 
ment of Natural History.” As time went on, 
and the various branches of human knowledge 
became more distinctly developed and separated 
from one another, it was found that some were 
much more susceptible of precise mathematical 
treatment than others. The publication of the 
“Principia” of Newton, which probably gave a 
greater stimulus to physical science than any work 
ever published before, or which is likely to be
-P-A-G-E-273
x ON THE ‘STUDY OF BIOLOGY 265 
published hereafter, showed that precise mathe- 
matical methods were applicable to those branches 
of science such as astronomy, and what we now 
call physics, which occupy a very large portion of 
the domain of what the older writers understood 
by natural history. And inasmuch as the partly 
deductive and partly experimental methods of 
treatment to which Newton and others subjected 
these branches of human knowledge, showed that 
the phenomena of nature which belonged to them 
were susceptible of explanation, and thereby came 
within the reach of what was called “ philosophy,” 
in those days; so much of this kind of knowledge 
as was not included under astronomy came to 
be spoken of as “natural philosophy ”—a term 
which Bacon had employed in a much wider 
sense. Time went on, and yet other branches of 
science developed themselves. Chemistry took a 
definite shape; and since all these sciences, such 
as astronomy, natural philosophy, and chemistry, 
were susceptible either of mathematical treatment 
or of experimental treatment, or of both, a broad 
distinction was drawn between the experimental 
branches of what had previously been called natu- 
ral history and the observational branches—those 
in which experiment was (or appeared to be) of 
_ doubtful use, and where, at that time, mathemat- 
ical methods were inapplicable. Under these cir- 
cumstances the old name of “ Natural History ” 
stuck by the residuum by those phenomena 
   
-P-A-G-E-274
  266 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
which were not, at that time, susceptible of mathe- 
matical or experimental treatment; that is to say, 
those phenomena of nature which come now under 
the general heads of physical geography, geology, 
mineralogy, the history of plants, and the his- 
tory of animals. It was in this sense that the 
term was understood by the great writers of the 
middle of the last century—Buffon and Lin- 
neus—by Buffon in his great work, the “ Histoire 
Naturelle Générale,” and by Linneus in his splen- 
did achievement, the “Systema Nature.” The 
subjects they deal with are spoken of as “ Natural 
History,” and they called themselves and were 
called “ Naturalists.” But you will observe that 
this was not the original meaning of these terms; 
but that they had, by this time, acquired a sig- 
nification widely different from that which they 
possessed primitively. 
The sense in which “ Natural History” was 
used at the time I am now speaking of has, to a 
certain extent, endured to the present day. There 
are now in existence in some of our northern uni- 
versities, chairs of “ Civil and Natural History ” in 
which “Natural History” is used to indicate ex- 
actly what Hobbes and Bacon meant by that term. 
The unhappy incumbent of the chair of Natural 
History is, or was, supposed to cover the whole 
ground of geology, mineralogy, and zoology, per- 
haps even botany, in his lectures. 
But as science made the marvellous progress
-P-A-G-E-275
  x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 267 
which it did make at the latter end of the last 
and the beginning of the present century, think- 
ing men began to discern that under this title 
of “Natural History” there were included very 
heterogeneous constituents—that, for example, 
geology and mineralogy were, in many respects, 
widely different from botany and zoology; that a 
man might obtain an extensive knowledge of the 
structure and functions of plants and animals 
without having need to enter upon the study of 
geology or mineralogy, and vice versé; and, fur- 
ther as knowledge advanced, it became clearer that 
there was a great analogy, a very close alliance, 
between those two sciences, of botany and zoology 
which deal with human beings, while they are 
much more widely separated from all other studies. 
It is due to Buffon to remark that he clearly recog- 
nised this great fact. He says: “ Ces deux genres 
@étres organisés [les animaux et les végétaux] ont 
beaucoup plus de propriétés communes que de 
différences réelles.” Therefore, it is not wonder- 
ful that, at the beginning of the present century, 
in two different countries, and so far as I know, 
without any intercommunication, two famous men 
clearly conceived the notion of uniting the sci- 
ences which deal with living matter into one 
whole, and of dealing with them as one discipline. 
In fact, I may say there were three men to 
whom this idea occurred contemporanecously, al- 
though there were but two who carried it into
-P-A-G-E-276
268 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
effect, and only one who worked it out completely. 
The persons to whom I refer were the eminent 
physiologist Bichat, and the great naturalist La- 
marck, in France; and a distinguished German, 
Treviranus. Bichat * assumed the existence of a 
special group of “ physiological” sciences. La- 
marck, in a work published in 1801,} for the first 
time made use of the name “ Biologie,” from the 
two Greek words which signify a discourse upon 
life and living things. About the same time it 
occurred to Treviranus, that all those sciences 
which deal with living matter are essentially and 
fundamentally one, and ought to be treated as a 
whole; and, in the year 1802, he published the 
first volume of what he also called “ Biologie.” 
Treviranus’s great merit lies in this, that he 
worked out his idea, and wrote the very remark- 
able book to which I refer. It consists of six 
volumes, and occupied its author for twenty years 
—from 1802 to 1822. 
That is the origin of the term “ Biology ”; 
and that is how it has come about that all clear 
thinkers and lovers of consistent nomenclature 
have substituted for the old confusing name of 
“Natural History,” which has conveyed so many 
meanings, the term “ Biology ” which denotes the 
whole of the sciences which deal with living 
* See the distinction between the “sciences physiques” 
and the “sciences physiologiques” in the Anatomie Générale,

-P-A-G-E-277
  x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 269 
things, whether they be animals or whether they 
be plants. Some little time ago—in the course of 
this year, I think—I was favoured by a learned 
classic, Dr. Field of Norwich, with a disquisition, 
in which he endeavoured to prove that, from a 
philological point of view, neither Treviranus nor 
Lamarck had any right to coin this new word 
“Biology” for their purpose; that, in fact, the 
Greek word “ Bios” had relation only to human 
life and human affairs, and that a different word 
was employed by the Greeks when they wished to 
speak of the life of animals and plants. So Dr. 
Field tells us we are all wrong in using the term 
biology, and that we ought to employ another; 
only he is not sure about the propriety of that 
which he proposes as a substitute. It is a some- 
what hard one—“zootocology.” I am sorry we 
are wrong, because we are likely to continue so. 
In these matters we must have some sort of 
“ Statute of Limitations.” When a name has been 
employed for half a century, persons of authority * 
have been using it, and its sense has become well 
understood, I am afraid people will go on using it, 
whatever the weight of philological objection. 
Now that we have arrived at the origin of this 
word “ Biology,” the next point to consider is: 
* “The term Biology, which means exactly what we wish 
to express, the Science of Life, has often been used, and 
has of late become not uncommon, among good writers.”— 
Whewell, Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, vol. i. p. 
544 (edition of 1847).
-P-A-G-E-278
270 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
What ground does it cover? I have said that in 
its strict technical sense, it denotes all the phe- 
nomena which are exhibited by living things, as 
distinguished from those which are not living; 
but while that is all very well, so long as we 
confine ourselves to the lower animals and to 
plants, it lands us in considerable difficulties 
when we reach the higher forms of living things. 
For whatever view we may entertain about the 
nature of man, one thing is perfectly certain, that 
he is a living creature. Hence, if our definition 
is to be interpreted strictly, we must include man 
and all his ways and works under the head of 
Biology; in which case, we should find that psy- 
chology, politics, and political economy would be 
absorbed into the province of Biology. In fact, 
civil history would be merged in natural his- 
tory. In strict logic it may be hard to object to 
this course, bécause no one can doubt that the 
rudiments and outlines of our own mental phe- 
nomena are traceable among the lower animals. 
They have their economy and their polity, and if, 
as is always admitted, the polity of bees and the 
commonwealth of wolves fall within the purview 
of the biologist proper, it becomes hard to say why 
we should not include therein human affairs, 
which, in so many cases, resemble those of the bees 
in zealous getting, and are not without a certain 
parity in the proceedings of the wolves. The real 
fact is that we biologists are a self-sacrificing peo-  
-P-A-G-E-279
  x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY yet 
ple; and inasmuch as, on a moderate estimate, 
there are about a quarter of a million different 
species of animals and plants to know about al- 
ready, we feel that we have more than sufficient 
territory. There has been a sort of practical con- 
vention by which we give up to a different branch 
of science what Bacon and Hobbes would have 
called “ Civil History.” That branch of science 
has constituted itself under the head of Sociology. 
I may use phraseology which, at present, will be 
well understood and say that we have allowed 
that province of Biology to become autonomous; 
but I should like you to recollect that that is a 
sacrifice, and that you should not be surprised if 
it occasionally happens that you see a biologist 
apparently trespassing in the region of philosophy 
or politics; or meddling with human education; 
because, after all, that is a part of his kingdom 
which he has only voluntarily forsaken. 
Having now defined the meaning of the word 
Biology, and having indicated the general scope of 
Biological Science, I turn to my second question, 
which is—Why should we study Biology. Pos- 
sibly the time may come when that will seem a 
very odd question. That we, living creatures, 
should not feel a certain amount of interest in 
what it is that constitutes our life will eventually, 
under altered ideas of the fittest objects of human 
inquiry, appear to be a singular phenomenon; but 
at present, judging by the practice of teachers and
-P-A-G-E-280
  279 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
educators, Biology would seem to be a topic that 
does not concern us at all. I propose to put 
before you a few considerations with which I dare 
say many will be familiar already, but which will 
suffice to show—not fully, because to demonstrate 
this point fully would take a great many lectures 
—that there are some very good and substantial 
reasons why it may be advisable that we should 
know something about this branch of human 
learning. 
I myself entirely agree with another sentiment 
of the philosopher of Malmesbury, “ that the scope 
of all speculation is the performance of some ac- 
tion or thing to be done,” and I have not any very 
great respect for, or interest in, mere knowing as 
such. I judge of the value of human pursuits by 
their bearing upon human interests; in other 
words, by their utility; but I should like that we 
should quite clearly understand what it is that 
we mean by this word “ utility.” In an English- 
man’s mouth it generally means that by which we 
get pudding or praise, or both. I have no doubt 
that is one meaning of the word utility, but it by 
no means includes all I mean by utility. I think 
that knowledge of every kind is useful in propor- 
tion as it tends to give people right ideas, which 
are essential to the foundation of right practice, 
and to remove wrong ideas, which are the no less 
essential foundations and fertile mothers of every 
description of error in practice. And inasmuch  
-P-A-G-E-281
x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 273 
as, whatever practical people may say, this world 
is, after all, absolutely governed by ideas, and very 
often by the wildest and most hypothetical ideas. 
It is a matter of the very greatest importance that 
our theories of things, and even of things that 
seem a long way apart from our daily lives, should- 
be as far as possible true, and as far as possible 
removed from error. It is not only in the coarser, 
practical sense of the word “ utility,” but in this 
higher and broader sense, that I measure the 
value of the study of biology by its utility; and I 
shall try to point out to you that you will feel the 
need of some knowledge of biology at a great 
many turns of this present nineteenth century 
life of ours. For example, most of us attach great 
importance to the conception which we entertain 
of the position of man in this universe and his 
relation to the rest of nature. We have almost 
all been told, and most of us hold by the tradition, 
that man occupies an isolated and peculiar position 
in nature; that though he is in the world he is 
not of the world; that his relations to things 
about him are of a remote character; that his 
origin is recent, his duration likely to be short, 
and that he is the great central figure round 
which other things in this world revolve. But 
this is not what the biologist tells us. 
At the present moment you will be kind 
enough to separate me from them, because it is in 
no way essential to my present argument that I  
-P-A-G-E-282
274. ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
should advocate their views. Don’t suppose that 
I am saying this for the purpose of escaping the 
responsibility of their beliefs; indeed, at other 
times and in other places, I do not think that 
point has been left doubtful; but I want clearly 
to point out to you that for my present argument 
they may all be wrong; and, nevertheless, my ar- 
gument will hold good. The biologists tell us that 
all this is an entire mistake. They turn to the 
physical organisation of man. They examine his 
whole structure, his bony frame and all that 
clothes it. They resolve him into the finest par- 
ticles into which the microscope will enable them 
to break him up. They consider the performance 
of his various functions and activities, and they 
look at the manner in which he occurs on the 
surface of the world. Then they turn to other 
animals, and taking the first handy domestic ani- 
mal—say a dog—they profess to be able to dem- 
onstrate that the analysis of the dog leads them, 
in gross, to precisely the same results as the analy- 
sis of the man; that they find almost identically 
the same bones, having the same relations; that 
they can name the muscles of the dog by the 
names of the muscles of the man, and the nerves 
of the dog by those of the nerves of the man, 
and that, such structures and organs of sense as 
we find in the man such also we find in the dog; 
they analyse the brain and spinal cord and they 
find that the nomenclature which fits the one an-
-P-A-G-E-283
  x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 275 
swers for the other. They carry their microscopic 
inquiries in the case of the dog as far as they 
can, and they find that his body is resolvable into 
the same elements as those of the man. More- 
over, they trace back the dog’s and the man’s devel- 
opment, and they find that, at a certain stage 
of their existence, the two creatures are not dis- 
tinguishable the one from the other; they find 
that the dog and his kind have a certain distri- 
bution over the surface of the world, comparable 
in its way to the distribution of the human species. 
What is true of the dog they tell us is true of 
all the higher animals; and they assert that they 
can lay down a common plan for the whole of 
hese creatures, and regard the man and the dog, 
the horse and the ox as minor modifications of 
one great fundamental unity. Moreover, the in- 
vestigations of the last three-quarters of a century 
have proved, they tell us, that similar inquiries, 
carried out through all the different kinds of ani- 
mals which are met with in nature, will lead us, 
not in one straight series, but by many roads, step 
y step, gradation by gradation, from man, at the 
summit, to specks of animated jelly at the bottom 
of the series. So that the idea of Leibnitz, and 
of Bonnet, that animals form a great scale of 
eing, in which there are a series of gradations 
from the most complicated form to the lowest and 
simplest; that idea, though not exactly in the 
orm in which it was propounded by those phi-   
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
losophers, turns out to be substantially correct. 
More than this, when biologists pursue their in- 
vestigations into the vegetable world, they find 
that they can, in the same way, follow out the 
structure of the plant, from the most gigantic and 
complicated trees down through a similar series of 
gradations, until they arrive at specks of animated 
jelly, which they are puzzled to distinguish from 
those specks which they reached by the animal 
road. 
Thus, biologists have arrived at the conclusion 
that a fundamental uniformity of structure per- 
vades the animal and vegetable worlds, and that 
plants and animals differ from one another simply 
as diverse modifications of the same great general 
plan. 
Again, they tell us the same story in regard to 
the study of function. They admit the large and 
important interval which, at the present time, 
separates the manifestations of the mental facul- 
ties observable in the higher forms of mankind, 
and even in the lower forms, such as we know 
them, from those exhibited by other animals; but, 
at the same time, they tell us that the founda- 
tions, or rudiments, of almost all the faculties of 
man are to be met with in the lower animals; 
that there is a unity of mental faculty as well as 
of bodily structure, and that, here also, the differ- 
ence is a difference of degree and not of kind. I 
said “ almost all,” for a reason. Among the many
-P-A-G-E-285
  x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY OT 
distinctions which have been drawn between the 
lower creatures and ourselves, there is one which 
is hardly ever insisted on,* but which may be 
very fitly spoken of in a place so largely devoted 
to Art as that in which we are assembled. It is 
this, that while, among various kinds of animals, 
it is possible to discover traces of all the other 
faculties of man, especially the faculty of mimicry, 
yet that particular form of mimicry which shows 
itself in the imitation of form either by modelling 
or by drawing, is not to be met with. As far as I 
know, there is no sculpture or modelling, and de- 
cidedly no painting or drawing, of animal origin. 
I mention the fact, in order that such comfort 
may be derived therefrom as artists may feel in- 
clined to take. 
If what the biologists tell us is true, it will be 
needful to get rid of our erroneous conceptions of 
man, and of his place in nature, and to substitute 
right ones for them. But it is impossible to form 
any judgment as to whether the biologists are right 
or wrong, unless we are able to appreciate the na- 
ture of the arguments which they have to offer. 
One would almost think this to be a self-evi- 
dent proposition. I wonder what a scholar would 
say to the man who should undertake to criti- 
cise a difficult passage in a Greek play, but who 
obviously had not acquainted himself with the 
* T think that my friend, Professor Allman, was the first 
to draw attention to it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
278 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
rudiments of Greek grammar. And yet, before 
giving positive opinions about these high ques- 
tions of Biology, people not only do not seem 
to think it necessary to be acquainted with the 
grammar of the subject, but they have not even 
mastered the alphabet. You find criticism and 
denunciation showered about by persons who not 
only have not attempted to go through the dis- 
cipline necessary to enable them to be judges, but 
who have not even reached that stage of emer- 
gence from ignorance in which the knowledge 
that such a discipline is necessary dawns upon the 
mind. I have had to watch with some atten- 
tion—in fact I have been favoured with a good 
deal of it myself—the sort of criticism with which 
biologists and biological teachings are visited. I 
am told every now and then that there is a “ bril- 
liant article” * in so-and-so, in which we are all 
demolished. I used to read these things once, but 
I am getting old now, and I have ceased to at- 
tend very much to this cry of “ wolf.” When one 
does read any of these productions, what one finds 
generally, on the face of it is, that the brilliant 
critic is devoid of even the elements of biolog- 
ical knowledge, and that his brilliancy is like 
* Galileo was troubled by a sort of people whom he 
called “ paper philosophers,” because they fancied that the 
true reading of nature was to be detected by the collation 
of texts. The race is not extinct, but, as of old, brings forth 
its “winds of doctrine” by which the weathercock heads 
among us are much exercised.

the light given out by the crackling of thorns 
under a pot of which Solomon speaks. So far as 
I recollect, Solomon makes use of the image for 
purposes of comparison; but I will not proceed 
further into that matter. 
Two things must be obvious: in the first place, 
that every man who has the interests of truth at 
heart must earnestly desire that every well- 
founded and just criticism that can be made should 
be made; but that, in the second place, it is essen- 
tial to anybody’s being able to benefit by criticism, 
that the critic should know what he is talking 
about, and be in a position to form a mental 
image of the facts symbolised by the words he uses. 
If not, it is as obvious in the case of a biological 
argument, as it is in that of a historical or philo- 
logical discussion,’ that such criticism is a mere 
waste of time on the part of its author, and wholly 
undeserving of attention on the part of those 
who are criticised. Take it then as an illustration 
of the importance of biological study, that there- 
by alone are men able to form something like 
a rational conception of what constitutes valuable 
criticism of the teachings of biologists.* 
* Some critics do not even take the trouble to read. I 
have recently been adjured with much solemnity, to state 
publicly why I have “changed my opinion” as to the value 
ee ehe palwontological evidence of the occurrence of evo-

Next, I may mention another bearing of bio- 
logical knowledge—a more practical one in the 
ordinary sense of the word. Consider the theory 
of infectious disease. Surely that is of interest to 
all of us. Now the theory of infectious disease is 
rapidly being elucidated by biological study. It is 
possible to produce, from among the lower animals, 
examples of devastating diseases which spread in 
the same manner as our infectious disorders, and 
which are certainly and unmistakably caused by 
living organisms. This fact renders it possible, at 
any rate, that that doctrine of the causation of in- 
fectious disease which is known under the name of 
“the germ theory ” may be well-founded; and, if 
so, it must needs lead to the most important 
practical measures in dealing with those terrible 
visitations. It may be well that the general, as 
well as the professional, public should have a 
sufficient knowledge of biological truths to be able 
be said to be a public document, inasmuch as it not only 
appeared in the Journal of that learned body, but was re- 
published, in 1878, in a volume of Critiques and Addresses, 
to which my name is attached. Therein will be found a 
pretty full statement of my reasons for enunciating two 
propositions: (1) that “when we turn to the higher Verte- 
brata, the results of recent investigations, however we may 
sift and criticise them, seem to me to leave a clear balance 
in favour of the evolution of living forms one from an- 
other ;” and (2) that the case of the horse is one which 
“will stand rigorous criticism.” 
Thus I do not see clearly in what way I can be said to 
have changed my opinion, except in the way of intensify- 
ing it, when in consequence of the accumulation of similar 
evidence since 1870, I recently spoke of the denial of evolu- 
tion as not worth serious consideration. 
 
-P-A-G-E-289

to take a rational interest in the discussion of such 
problems, and to see, what I think they may hope 
to see, that, to those who possess a sufficient ele- 
mentary knowledge of Biology, they are not all 
quite open questions. 
Let me mention another important practical 
illustration of the value of biological study. With- 
in the last forty years the theory of agriculture has 
been revolutionised. The researches of Liebig, 
and those of our own Lawes and Gilbert, have 
had a bearing upon that branch of industry the 
importance of which cannot be over-estimated; but 
the whole of these new views have grown out of 
the better explanation of certain processes which 
go on in plants; and which, of course, form a part 
of the subject-matter of Biology. 
I might go on multiplying these examples, but 
I see that the clock won’t wait for me, and I 
must therefore pass to the third question to which 
I referred:—Granted that Biology is something 
worth studying, what is the best way of studying 
it? Here I must point out that, since Biology is 
a physical science, the method of studying it must 
needs be analogous to that which is followed in 
the other physical sciences. It has now long been 
recognised that, if a man wishes to be a chemist, 
it is not only necessary that he should read chemi- 
cal books and attend chemical lectures, but that 
he should actually perform the fundamental ex- 
periments in the laboratory for himself, and thus
-P-A-G-E-290
  
282 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
learn exactly what the words which he finds in his 
books and hears from his teachers, mean. If he 
does not do so, he may read till the crack of doom, 
but he will never know much about chemistry. 
That is what every chemist will tell you, and the 
physicist will do the same for his branch of science. 
The great changes and improvements in physical 
and chemical scientific education, which have taken 
place of late, have all resulted from the combina- 
tion of practical teaching with the reading of books 
and with the hearing of lectures. The same thing 
is true in Biology. Nobody will ever know any- 
thing about Biology except in a dilettante “ paper- 
philosopher ” way, who contents himself with read- 
ing books on botany, zoology, and the like; and 
the reason of this is simple and easy to understand. 
It is that all language is merely symbolical of the 
things of which it treats; the more complicated 
the things, the more bare is the symbol, and 
the more its verbal definition requires to be sup- 
plemented by the information derived directly 
from the handling, and the seeing, and the touch- 
ing of the thing symbolised:—that is really what 
is at the bottom of the whole matter. It is plain 
common sense, as all truth, in the long run, is only 
common sense clarified. If you want a man to 
be a tea merchant, you don’t tell him to read books 
about China or about tea, but you put him into 
a tea-merchant’s office where he has the handling, 
the smelling, and the tasting of tea. Without the 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 283 
sort of knowledge which can be gained only in 
this practical way, his exploits as a tea merchant 
will soon come to a bankrupt termination. The 
“ paper-philosophers ” are under the delusion that 
physical science can be mastered as literary ac- 
complishments are acquired, but unfortunately it 
is not so. You may read any quantity of books, 
and you may be almost as ignorant as you were 
at starting if you don’t have, at the back of your 
minds, the change for words in definite images 
which can only be acquired through the operation 
of your observing faculties on the phenomena of 
nature. 
It may be said:—“ That is all very well, but 
you told us just now that there are probably some- 
thing like a quarter of a million different kinds 
of living and extinct animals and plants, and a 
human life could not suffice for the examination 
of one-fiftieth part of all these.” That is true, 
but then comes the great convenience of the way 
things are arranged; which is, that although there 
are these immense numbers of different kinds of 
living things in existence, yet they are built up, 
after all, upon marvellously few plans. 
There are certainly more than 100,000 species 
of insects, and yet anybody who knows one insect 
—if a properly chosen one—will be able to have 
a very fair conception of the structure of the 
whole. I do not mean to say he will know 
that structure thoroughly, or as well as it is desir-
-P-A-G-E-292
    984 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
able he should know it; but he will have enough 
real knowledge to enable him to understand what 
he reads, to have genuine images in his mind of 
hose structures which become so variously modi- 
fied in all the forms of insects he has not seen. 
In fact, there are such things as types of form 
among animals and vegetables, and for the pur- 
pose of getting a definite knowledge of what con- 
stitutes the leading modifications of animal and 
lant life, it is not needful to examine more than 
a comparatively small number of animals and 
lants. 
Let me tell you what we do in the biological 
aboratory which is lodged in a building adjacent to 
this. There I lecture to a class of students daily 
for about four-and-a-half months, and my class 
have, of course, their text-books; but the essential 
art of the whole teaching, and that which I re- 
gard as really the most important part of it, is a 
aboratory for practical work, which is simply a 
room with all the appliances needed for ordinary 
dissection. We have tables properly arranged in 
regard to light, microscopes, and dissecting instru- 
ments, and we work through the structure of a 
certain number of animals and plants. As, for 
example, among the plants, we take a yeast plant, 
a Protococcus, a common mould, a Chara, a fern, 
and some flowering plant; among animals we ex- 
amine such things as an Ameba, a Vorticella, and 
a fresh-water polype. We dissect a star-fish, an  
-P-A-G-E-293
x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 285 
earth-worm, a snail, a squid, and a fresh-water 
mussel. We examine a lobster and a cray-fish, 
and a black beetle. We go on to a common skate, 
a cod-fish, a frog, a tortoise, a pigeon, and a rabbit, 
and that takes us about all the time we have to 
give. The purpose of this course is not to make 
skilled dissectors, but to give every student a clear 
and definite conception, by means of sense-images, 
of the characteristic structure of each of the lead- 
ing modifications of the animal kingdom; and that 
is perfectly possible, by going no further than 
the length of that list of forms which I have 
enumerated. If a man knows the structure of 
the animals I have mentioned, he has a clear and 
exact, however limited, apprehension of the essen- 
tial features of the organisation of all those great 
divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms 
to which the forms I have mentioned severally be- 
long. And it then becomes possible for him to 
read with profit; because every time he meets 
with the name of a structure, he has a definite 
image in his mind of what the name means in 
the particular creature he is reading about, and 
therefore the reading is not mere reading. It is 
not mere repetition of words; but every term 
employed in the description, we will say, of a horse, 
or of an elephant, will call up the image of the 
things he. had seen in the rabbit, and he is able to 
form a distinct conception of that which he has not 
seen, as a modification of that which he has seen.   
 
-P-A-G-E-294
286 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
I find this system to yield excellent results; and 
I have no hesitation whatever in saying, that any 
one who has gone through such a course, atten- 
tively, is in a better position to form a conception 
of the great truths of Biology, especially of mor- 
phology (which is what we chiefly deal with), than 
if he had merely read all the books on that topic 
put together. 
The connection of this discourse with the Loan 
Collection of Scientific Apparatus arises out of the 
exhibition in that collection of certain aids to our 
laboratory work. Such of you as have visited that 
very interesting collection may have noticed a series 
of diagrams and of preparations illustrating the 
structure of a frog. Those diagrams and prepara- 
ions have been made for the use of the students 
in the biological laboratory. Similar diagrams and 
reparations illustrating the structure of all the 
other forms of life we examine, are either made or 
in course of preparation. Thus the student has 
before him, first, a picture of the structure he ought 
0 see; secondly, the structure itself worked out; 
and if with these aids, and such needful explana- 
ions and practical hints as a demonstrator can 
supply, he cannot make out the facts for himself 
in the materials supplied to him, he had better 
ake to some other pursuit than that of biological 
science. 
I should have been glad to have said a few 
words about the use of museums in the study of  
-P-A-G-E-295
x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 287 
Biology, but I see that my time is becoming 
short, and I have yet another question to answer. 
Nevertheless, I must, at the risk of wearying you, 
say a word or two upon the important subject of 
museums. Without doubt there are no helps to 
the study of Biology, or rather to some branches 
of it, which are, or may be, more important than 
natural history museums; but, in order to take 
this place in regard to Biology, they must be 
museums of the future. The museums of the 
present do not, by any means, do so much for us 
as they might do. I do not wish to particularise, 
but I dare say many of you, seeking knowledge, or 
in the laudable desire to employ a_ holiday 
usefully, have visited some great natural history 
museum. You have walked through a quarter 
of a mile of animals, more or less well stuffed, 
with their long names written out underneath 
them; and, unless your experience is very differ- 
ent from that of most people, the upshot of it all 
is that you leave that splendid pile with sore feet, 
a bad headache, and a general idea that the 
animal kingdom is a “mighty maze without a 
plan.” I do not think that a museum which 
brings about this result does all that may be 
reasonably expected from such an institution. 
What is needed in a collection of natural history 
is that it should be made as accessible and as use- 
ful as possible, on the one hand to the general 
public, and on the other to scientific workers.  
-P-A-G-E-296
    288 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
That need is not met by constructing a sort of 
happy hunting-ground of miles of glass cases; 
and, under the pretence of exhibiting everything 
putting the maximum amount of obstacle in the 
way of those who wish properly to see anything. 
What the public want is easy and unhindered 
access to such a collection as they can understand 
and appreciate; and what the men of science want 
is similar access to the materials of science. |To 
this end the vast mass of objects of natural 
history should be divided into two parts—one 
open to the public, the other to men of science, 
every day. The former division should exemplify 
all the more important and interesting forms of 
life. Explanatory tablets should be attached to 
them, and catalogues containing clearly-written 
popular expositions of the general significance of 
the objects exhibited should be provided. The lat- 
ter should contain, packed into a comparatively 
small space, in rooms adapted for working pur- 
poses, the objects of purely scientific interest. For 
example, we will say I am an ornithologist. I go 
to examine a collection of birds. It is a positive 
nuisance to have them stuffed. It is not only 
sheer waste, but I have to reckon with the ideas 
of the bird-stuffer, while, if I have the skin and 
nobody has interfered with it, I can form my own 
judgment as to what the bird was like. For 
ornithological purposes, what is needed is not 
glass cases full of stuffed birds on perches, but
-P-A-G-E-297
x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 289 
convenient drawers into each of which a great 
quantity of skins will go. They occupy no great 
space and do not require any expenditure beyond 
their original cost. But for the edification of the 
public, who want to learn indeed, but do not 
seek for minute and technical knowledge, the case 
is different. What one of the general public walk- 
ing into a collection of birds desires to see is not 
all the birds that can be got together. He 
does not want to compare a hundred species of 
the sparrow tribe side by side; but he wishes to 
know what a bird is, and what are the great 
modifications of bird structure, and to be able to 
get at that knowledge .easily. What will best 
serve his purpose is a comparatively small num- 
ber of birds carefully selected, and artistically, 
as well as accurately, set up; with their different 
ages, their nests, their young, their eggs, and 
their skeletons side by side; and in accordance 
with the admirable plan which is pursued in this 
museum, a tablet, telling the spectator in legible 
characters what they are and what they mean. 
For the instruction and recreation of the public 
such a typical collection would be of far greater 
value than any many-acred imitation of Noah’s 
ark, 
Lastly comes the question as to when biological 
study may best be pursued. I do not see any 
valid reason why it should not be made, to a 
certain extent, a part of ordinary school training.    
-P-A-G-E-298
ee er eee 
290 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
I have long advocated this view, and I am 
perfectly certain that it can be carried out with 
ease, and not only with ease, but with very con- 
siderable profit to those who are taught; but then 
such instruction must be adapted to the minds 
and needs of the scholars. They used to have 
a very odd way of teaching the classical languages 
when I was a boy. The first task set you was to 
learn the rules of the Latin grammar in the 
Latin language—that being the language you were 
going to learn! I thought then that this was an 
odd way of learning a language, but did not ven- 
ture to rebel against the judgment of my supe- 
riors. Now, perhaps, I am not so modest as I was 
then, and I allow myself to think that it was 
a very absurd fashion. But it would be no less 
absurd, if we were to set about teaching Bi- 
ology by putting it into the hands of boys a series 
of definitions of the classes and orders of the 
animal kingdom, and making them repeat them 
by heart. That is so very favourite a method of 
teaching, that I sometimes fancy the spirit of the 
old classical system has entered into the new 
scientific system, in which case I would much 
rather that any pretence at scientific teaching 
were abolished altogether. What really has to be 
done is to get into the young mind some notion 
of what animal and vegetable life is. In this 
matter, you have to consider practical convenience 
as well as other things. There are difficulties in
-P-A-G-E-299
  
x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 291 
the way of a lot of boys making messes with 
slugs and snails; it might not work in practice. 
But there is a very convenient and handy animal 
which everybody has at hand, and that is himself; 
and it is a very easy and simple matter to obtain 
common plants. Hence the general truths of 
anatomy and physiology can be taught to young 
people in a very real fashion by dealing with the 
broad facts of human structure. Such viscera as 
they cannot very well examine in themselves, 
such as hearts, lungs, and livers, may be obtained 
from the nearest butcher’s shop. In respect to 
teaching something about the biology of plants, 
there is no practical difficulty, because almost any 
of the common plants will do, and plants do not 
make a mess—at least they do not make an 
unpleasant mess; so that, in my judgment, the 
best form of Biology for teaching to very young 
people is elementary human physiology on the 
one hand, and the elements of botany on the other; 
beyond that I do not think it will be feasible to 
advance for some time to come. But then I 
see no reason, why, in secondary schools, and in 
the Science Classes which are under the control 
of the Science and Art Department—and which 
I may say, in passing, have in my judgment, 
done so very much for the diffusion of a knowl- 
edge of science over the country—we should not 
hope to see instruction in the elements of Biolo- 
gy carried out, not perhaps to the same extent,
-P-A-G-E-300
  292 ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY x 
but still upon somewhat the same principle as 
here. There is no difficulty, when you have to 
deal with students of the ages of fifteen or sixteen, 
in practising a little dissection and in getting a 
notion of, at any rate, the four or five great modi- 
fications of the animal form; and the like is true 
in regard to the higher anatomy of plants. 
While, lastly, to all those who are studying 
biological science with a view to their own edifi- 
cation merely, or with the intention of becoming 
zoologists or botanists; to all those who intend to 
pursue physiology—and especially to those who 
propose to employ the working years of their 
lives in the practice of medicine—I say that 
there is no training so fitted, or which may be of 
such important service to them, as the discipline 
in practical biological work which I have sketched 
out as being pursued in the laboratory hard by. 
I may add that, beyond all these different 
classes of persons who may profit by the study of 
Biology, there is yet one other. I remember, a 
number of years ago, that a gentleman who was a 
vehement opponent of Mr. Darwin’s views and had 
written some terrible articles against them, applied 
to me to know what was the best way in which he 
could acquaint himself with the strongest argu- 
ments in favour of evolution. I wrote back, in all 
good faith and simplicity, recommending him to 
go through a course of comparative anatomy and
-P-A-G-E-301
x ON THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY 293 
physiology, and then to study development. I am 
sorry to say he was very much displeased, as people 
often are with good advice. Notwithstanding this 
discouraging result, I venture, as a parting word, 
to repeat the suggestion, and to say to all the more 
or less acute lay and clerical “ paper-philoso- 
phers ” * who venture into the regions of biologi- 
cal controversy—Get a little sound, thorough, prac- 
tical, elementary instruction in biology. 
* Writers of this stamp are fond of talking about the 
Baconian method. I beg them therefore to lay to heart 
these two weighty sayings of the herald of Modern Sci- 
ence :— 
“Syllogismus ex propositionibus constat, propositiones 
ex verbis, verba notionum tessere sunt. Itaque si notiones 
ipse (¢d quod basis ret est) confuse sint et temere a rebus 
abstractw, nihil in iis que superstruuntur est firmitudinis.” 
—WNovum Organon, ii. 14. 
“Huic autem vanitati nonnulli ex modernis summa 
levitate ita indulserunt, ut in primo capitulo Geneseos et in 
libro Job et aliis scripturis sacris, philosophiam naturalem 
fundare conhei sint; inter vivos querentes mortua.’—

ON ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION IN 
PHYSIOLOGY 
[1877] 
Tue chief ground upon which I venture to 
recommend that the teaching of elementary 
physiology should form an essential part of any 
organised course of instruction in matter pertaining 
to domestic economy, is, that a knowledge of even 
the elements of this subject supplies those con- 
ceptions of the constitution and mode of action 
of the living body, and of the nature of health 
and disease, which prepare the mind to receive 
instruction from sanitary science. 
It is, I think, eminently desirable that the 
hygienist and the physician should find something 
in the public mind to which they can appeal; some 
little stock of universally acknowledged truths, 
which may serve as a foundation for their warn- 
ings, and predispose towards an intelligent obedi- 
ence to their recommendations. 
294
-P-A-G-E-303
  
xt INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY 295 
Listening to ordinary talk about health, dis- 
ease, and death, one is often led to entertain a 
doubt whether the speakers believe that the course 
of natural causation runs as smoothly in the hu- 
man body as elsewhere. Indications are too often 
obvious of a strong, though perhaps an unavowed 
and half unconscious, under-current of opinion 
that the phenomena of life are not only widely 
different, in their superficial characters and in 
their practical importance, from other natural 
events, but that they do not follow in that definite 
order which characterises the succession of all 
other occurrences, and the statement of which we 
call a law of nature. 
Hence, I think, arises the want of heartiness of 
belief in the value of knowledge respecting the 
laws of health and disease, and of the foresight 
and care to which knowledge is the essential pre- 
liminary, which is so often noticeable; and a cor- 
responding laxity and carelessness in practice, the 
results of which are too frequently lamentable. 
It is said that among the many religious sects 
of Russia, there is one which holds that all disease 
is brought about by the direct and special inter- 
ference of the Deity, and which, therefore, looks 
with repugnance upon both preventive and cura- 
tive measures as alike blasphemous interferences 
with the will of God. Among ourselves, the 
“ Peculiar People ” are, I believe, the only persons 
who hold the like doctrine in its integrity, and 
79
-P-A-G-E-304
296 INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY x 
carry it out with logical rigour. But many of us 
are old enough to recollect that the administration 
of chloroform in assaugement of the pangs of 
childbirth was, at its introduction, strenuously re- 
sisted upon similar grounds. 
I am not sure that the feeling, of which the 
doctrine to which I have referred is the full ex- 
pression, does not lie at the bottom of the minds 
of a great many people who yet would vigorously 
object to give a verbal assent to the doctrine itself. 
However this may be, the main point is that suffi- 
cient knowledge has now been acquired of vital 
phenomena, to justify the assertion, that the no- 
tion, that there is anything exceptional about 
these phenomena, receives not a particle of sup- 
port from any known fact. On the contrary, 
there is a vast and an increasing mass of evidence 
that birth and death, health and disease, are as 
much parts of the ordinary stream of events as the 
rising and setting of the sun, or the changes of 
the moon; and that the living body is a mechan- 
ism, the proper working of which we term health; 
its disturbance, disease; its stoppage, death. The 
activity of this mechanism is dependent upon 
many and complicated conditions, some of which 
are hopelessly beyond our control, while others 
are readily accessible, and are capable of being 
indefinitely modified by our own actions. The 
business of the hygienist and of the physician is 
to know the range of these modifiable conditions,  
-P-A-G-E-305
  XI INSTRUCTION IN. PHYSIOLOGY 297 
and how to influence them towards the mainte- 
nance of health and the prolongation of life; the 
business of the general public is to give an intelli- 
gent assent, and a ready obedience based upon 
that assent, to the rules laid down for their guid- 
ance by such experts. But an intelligent assent 
is an assent based upon knowledge, and the knowl- 
edge which is here in question means an acquaint- 
ance with the elements of physiology. 
It is not difficult to acquire such knowledge. 
What is true, to a certain extent, of all the phys- 
ical sciences, is eminently characteristic of physi- 
ology—the difficulty of the subject begins beyond 
the stage of elementary knowledge, and increases 
with every stage of progress. While the most 
highly trained and the best furnished intellect 
may find all its resources insufficient, when it 
strives to reach the heights and penetrate into the 
depths of the problems of physiology, the elemen- 
tary and fundamental truths can be made clear 
to a child. 
No one can have any difficulty in comprehend- 
ing the mechanism of circulation or respiration; 
or the general mode of operation of the organ of 
vision; though the unravelling of all the minutie 
of these processes, may, for the present, bafile the 
conjoined attacks of the most accomplished physi- 
cists, chemists, and mathematicians. To know the 
anatomy of the human body, with even an ap- 
proximation to thoroughness, is the work of a
-P-A-G-E-306
298 INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY XI 
life; but as much as is needed for a sound com- 
prehension of elementary physiological truths, may 
be learned in a week. 
A knowledge of the elements of physiology is 
not only easy of acquirement, but it may be made 
a real and practical acquaintance with the facts, 
as far as it goes. The subject of study is always 
at hand, in one’s self. The principal constituents 
of the skeleton, and the changes of form of con- 
tracting muscles, may be felt through one’s own 
skin. The beating of one’s heart, and its connec- 
tion with the pulse, may be noted; the influence 
of the valves of one’s own veins may be shown; 
the movements of respiration may be observed; 
while the wonderful phenomena of sensation 
afford an endless field for curious and interesting 
self-study. The prick of a needle will yield, in a 
drop of one’s own blood, material for microscopic 
observation of phenomena which lie at the foun- 
dation of all biological conceptions; and a cold, 
with its concomitant coughing and sneezing, may 
prove the sweet uses of adversity by helping one 
to a clear conception of what is meant by “ reflex 
action.” 
Of course there is a limit to this physiological 
self-examination. But there is so close a solidar- 
ity between ourselves and our poor relations of 
dhe animal world, that our inaccessible inward 
parts may be supplemented by theirs. A com- 
parative anatomist knows that a sheep’s heart and  
-P-A-G-E-307
  XI INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY 299 
lungs, or eye, must not be confounded with those 
of a man; but, so far as the comprehension of the 
elementary facts of the physiology of circulation, 
of respiration, and of vision goes, the one fur- 
nishes the needful anatomical data as well as the 
other. 
Thus, it is quite possible to give instruction in 
elementary physiology in such a manner as, not 
only to confer knowledge, which, for the reason I 
have mentioned, is useful in itself; but to serve 
the purposes of a training in accurate observation, 
and in the methods of reasoning of physical sci- 
ence. But that is an advantage whi mention 
only incidentally, as the present cate as does 
not deal with education in the ery fense of 
the word. 
It will not be suspected that I saa to make 
physiologists of all the world. It would be as 
reasonable to accuse an advocate of the “ three 
R’s ” of a desire to make an orator, an author, and 
a mathematician of everybody. A stumbling 
reader, a pot-hook writer, and an arithmetician 
who has not got beyond the rule of three, is not a 
person of brilliant acquirements; but the differ- 
ence between such a member of society and one 
who can neither read, write, nor cipher is almost 
inexpressible; and no one nowadays doubts the 
value of instruction, even if it goes no farther. 
The saying that a little knowledge is a danger- 
ous thing is, to my mind, a very dangerous adage.
-P-A-G-E-308
  300 INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY XI 
If knowledge is real and genuine, I do not believe 
that it is other than a very valuable possession, 
however infinitesimal its quantity may be. In- 
deed, if a little knowledge is dangerous, where 
is the man who has so much as to be out of 
danger? 
If William Harvey’s life-long labours had re- 
vealed to him a tenth part of that which may be 
made sound and real knowledge to our boys and 
girls, he would not only have been what he was, 
the greatest physiologist of his age, but he would 
have loomed upon the seventeenth century as a 
sort of intellectual portent. Our “little knowl- 
edge” would have been to him a great, astound- 
ing, unlooked-for vision of scientifle truth. 
I really see no harm which can come of giving 
our children a little knowledge of physiology. 
But then, as I have said, the instruction must be 
real, based upon observation, eked out by good 
explanatory diagrams and models, and conveyed 
by a teacher whose own knowledge has been ac- 
quired by a study of the facts; and not the mere 
eatechismal parrot-work which too often usurps 
the place of elementary teaching. 
It is, I hope, unnecessary for me to give a 
formal contradiction to the silly fiction, which is 
assiduously circulated by fanatics who not only 
ought to know, but do know, that their assertions 
are untrue, that I have advocated the introduction 
of that experimental discipline which is absolutely
-P-A-G-E-309
XI INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY 301 
indispensable to the professed physiologist, into 
elementary teaching. 
But while I should object to any experimenta- 
tion which can justly be called painful, for the 
purpose of elementary instruction; and, while, as 
a member of the late Royal Commission, I gladly 
did my best to prevent the infliction of needless 
pain, for any purpose; I think it is my duty to 
take this opportunity of expressing my regret at a 
condition of the law which permits a boy to troll 
for pike, or set lines with live-frog bait, for idle 
amusement; and, at the same time, lays the 
teacher of that boy open to the penalty of fine and 
imprisonment, if he uses the same animal for the 
purpose of exhibiting one of the most beautiful 
and instructive of physiological spectacles, the cir- 
culation in the web of the foot. No one could 
undertake to affirm that a frog is not inconven- 
ienced by being wrapped up in a wet rag, and 
having his toes tied out; and it cannot be denied 
that inconvenience is a sort of pain. But you 
must not inflict the least pain on a vertebrated 
animal for scientific purposes (though you may 
do a good deal in that way for gain or for sport) 
without due licence of the Secretary of State for 
the Home Department, granted under the author- 
ity of the Vivisection Act. 
So it comes about, that, in this present year of 
grace 1877, two persons may be charged with 
cruelty to animals. One has impaled a frog, and
-P-A-G-E-310
802 INSTRUCTION IN PHYSIOLOGY xI 
suffered the creature to writhe about in that con- 
dition for hours; the other has pained the animal 
no more than one of us would be pained by tying 
strings round his fingers, and keeping him in the 
position of a hydropathic patient. The first of- 
fender says “I did it because I find fishing very 
amusing,” and the magistrate bids him depart in 
peace; nay, probably wishes him good sport. The 
second pleads, “I wanted to impress a scientific 
truth, with a distinctness attainable in no other 
way, on the minds of my scholars,” and the mag- 
istrate fines him five pounds. 
I cannot but think that this is an anomalous 
and not wholly creditable state of things.

Ir has given me sincere pleasure to be here to- 
day, at the desire of your highly respected Presi- 
dent and the Council of the College. In looking 
back upon my own past, I am sorry to say that I 
have found that it is a quarter of a century since 
I took part in those hopes and in those fears by 
which you have all recently been agitated, and 
which now are at an end. But, although so long 
a time has elapsed since I was moved by the same 
feelings, I beg leave to assure you that my sym- 
pathy with both victors and vanquished remains 
fresh—so fresh, indeed, that I could almost try 
to persuade myself that, after all, it cannot be 
so very long ago. My business during the last 
hour, however, has been to show that sympathy 
with one side only, and I assure you I have done 
303
-P-A-G-E-312

304 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION xr 
my best to play my part heartily, and to rejoice 
in the success of those who have succeeded. Still, 
I should like to remind you at the end of it all, 
that success on an occasion of this kind, valu- 
able and important as it is, is in reality only 
putting the foot upon one rung of the ladder 
which leads upwards; and that the rung of a lad- 
der was never meant to rest upon, but only to 
hold a man’s foot long enough to enable him to 
put the other somewhat higher. I trust that 
you will all regard these successes as simply re- 
minders that your next business is, having en- 
joyed the success of the day, no longer to look at 
that success, but to look forward to the next diffi- 
culty that is to be conquered. And now, having 
had so much to say to the successful candidates, 
you must forgive me if I add that a sort of under- 
current of sympathy has been going on in my 
mind all the time for those who have not been 
successful, for those valiant knights who have 
been overthrown in your tourney, and have not 
made their appearance in public. I trust that, 
in accordance with old custom, they, wounded and 
bleeding, have been carried off to their tents, to 
be carefully tended by the fairest of maidens; 
and in these days, when the chances are that 
every one of such maidens will be a qualified 
practitioner, I have no doubt that all the splinters 
will have been carefully extracted, and that they 
are now physically healed. But there may re-
-P-A-G-E-313
  XI ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 805 
main some little fragment of moral or intellec- 
tual discouragement, and therefore I will take 
the liberty to remark that your chairman to-day, 
if he occupied his proper place, would be among 
them. Your chairman, in virtue of his position, 
and for the brief hour that he occupies that po- 
sition, is a person of importance; and it may be 
some consolation to those who have failed if I 
say, that the quarter of a century which I have 
been speaking of, takes me back to the time when 
I was up at the University of London, a candidate 
for honours in anatomy and physiology, and when 
I was exceedingly well beaten by my excellent 
friend, Dr. Ransom, of Nottingham. There is a 
person here who recollects that circumstance very 
well. I refer to your venerated teacher and mine, 
Dr. Sharpey. He was at that time one of the 
examiners in anatomy and physiology, and you 
may be quite sure that, as he was one of the 
examiners, there remained not the smallest doubt 
in my mind of the propriety of his judgment, and 
I accepted my defeat with the most comfortable 
assurance that I had thoroughly well earned it. 
But, gentlemen, the competitor having been a 
worthy one, and the examination a fair one, I 
cannot say that I found in that circumstance 
anything very discouraging. I said to myself, 
“Never mind; what’s the next thing to be 
done?” And I found that policy of “never 
minding” and going on to the next thing to be
-P-A-G-E-314
306 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION x 
done, to be the most important of all policies in 
the conduct of practical life. It does not matter 
how many tumbles you have in this life, so long 
as you do not get dirty when you tumble; it is 
only the people who have to stop to be washed 
and made clean, who must necessarily lose the 
race. And I can assure you that there is the 
greatest practical benefit in making a few failures 
early in life. You learn that which is of inesti- 
mable importance—that there are a great many 
people in the world who are just as clever as you 
are. You learn to put your trust, by and by, in 
an economy and frugality of the exercise of your 
powers, both moral and intellectual; and you very 
soon find out, if you have not found it out before, 
that patience and tenacity of purpose are worth 
more than twice their weight of cleverness. In 
fact, if I were to go on discoursing on this subject, 
I should become almost eloquent in praise of non- 
success; but, lest so doing should seem, in any 
way, to wither well-earned laurels, I will turn 
from that topic, and ask you to accompany me in 
some considerations touching another subject 
which has a very profound interest for me, and 
which I think ought to have an equally profound 
interest for you. 
I presume that the great majority of those 
whom I address propose to devote themselves to 
the profession of medicine; and I do not doubt, 
from the evidences of ability which have been
-P-A-G-E-315
  x ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 3807 
given to-day, that I have before me a number of 
men who will rise to eminence in that profession, 
and who will exert a great and deserved influence 
upon its futute. That in which I am interested, 
and about which I wish to speak, is the subject of 
medical education, and I venture to speak about 
it for the purpose, if I can, of influencing you, 
who may have the power of influencing the med- 
ical education of the future. You may ask, by 
what authority do I venture, being a person not 
concerned in the practice of medicine, to meddle 
with that subject? I can only tell you it is a 
fact, of which a number of you I dare say are 
aware by experience (and I trust the experience 
has no painful associations), that I have been for a 
considerable number of years (twelve or thirteen 
years to the best of my recollection) one of the 
examiners in the University of London. You are 
further aware that the men who come up to the 
University of London are the picked men of the 
medical schools of London, and therefore such 
observations as I may have to make upon the 
state of knowledge of these gentlemen, if they be 
justified, in regard to any faults I may have to 
find, cannot be held to indicate defects in the 
capacity, or in the power of application of those 
gentlemen, but must be laid, more or less, to the 
account of the prevalent system of medical educa- 
tion. I will tell you what has struck me—but in 
speaking in this frank way, as one always does 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  308 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION sir 
about the defects of one’s friends, I must beg you 
to disabuse your minds of the notion that I am 
alluding to any particular school, or to any par- 
ticular college, or to any particular person; and 
to believe that if I am silent when I should be 
glad to speak with high praise, it is because that 
praise would come too close to this locality. What 
has struck me, then, in this long experience of 
the men best instructed in physiology from the 
medical schools of London is (with the many and 
brilliant exceptions to which I have referred), 
taking it as a whole, and broadly, the singular 
unreality of their knowledge of physiology. Now, 
I use that word “ unreality ” advisedly: I do not 
say “scanty;” on the contrary, there is plenty of 
it—a great deal too much of it—but it is the qual- 
ity, the nature of the knowledge, which I quarrel 
with. I know I used to have—I don’t know 
whether I have now, but I had once upon a time— 
a bad reputation among students for setting up a 
very high standard of acquirement, and I dare say 
you may think that the standard of this old exam- 
iner, who happily is now very nearly an extinct 
examiner, has been pitched too high. Nothing of 
the kind, I assure you. The defects I have no- 
ticed, and the faults I have to find, arise entirely 
from the circumstance that my standard is pitched 
too low. This is no paradox, gentlemen, but quite 
simply the fact. The knowledge I have looked 
for was a real, precise, thorough, and practical
-P-A-G-E-317
  XIE ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 809 
knowledge of fundamentals; whereas that which 
the best of the candidates, in a large proportion of 
cases, have had to give me was a large, extensive, 
and inaccurate knowledge of superstructure; and 
that is what I mean by saying that my demands 
went too low and not too high. What I have had 
to complain of is, that a large proportion of the 
gentlemen who come up for physiology to the 
University of London do not know it as they know 
their anatomy, and have not been taught it as they 
have been taught their anatomy. Now, I should 
not wonder at all if I heard a great many “ No, 
noes” here; but J am not talking about Univer- 
sity College; as I have told you before, I am talk- 
ing about the average education of medical schools. 
What I have found, and found so much reason to 
lament, is, that while anatomy has been taught as 
a science ought to be taught, as a matter of au- 
topsy, and observation, and strict discipline; in 
a very large number of cases, physiology has been 
taught as if it were a mere matter of books and of 
hearsay. I declare to you, gentlemen, that I have 
often expected to be told, when I have asked 
a question about the circulation of the blood, 
that Professor Breitkopf is of opinion that it cir- 
culates, but that the whole thing is an open ques- 
+ tion. I assure you that I am hardly exaggerat- 
ing the state of mind on matters of fundamental 
importance which I have found over and over 
again to obtain among gentlemen coming up to 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  310 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION xt 
that picked examination of the University of Lon- 
don. Now, I do not think that is a desirable 
state of things. I cannot understand why physi- 
ology should not be taught—in fact, you have 
here abundant evidence that it can be taught— 
with the same definiteness and the same precision 
as anatomy is taught. And you may depend upon 
this, that the only physiology which is to be of 
any good whatever in medical practice, or in its 
application to the study of medicine, is that physi- 
ology which a man knows of his own knowledge; 
just as the only anatomy which would be of any 
good to the surgeon is the anatomy which he 
knows of his own knowledge. Another peculiar- 
ity I have found in the physiology which has 
been current, and that is, that in the minds of 
a great many gentlemen it has been supplanted 
by histology. They have learnt a great deal of 
histology, and they have fancied that histology 
and physiology are the same things. I have asked 
for some knowledge of the physics and the 
mechanics and the chemistry of the human body, 
and I have been met by talk about cells. I de- 
clare to you I believe it will take me two years, 
at least, of absolute rest from the business of an’ 
examiner to hear the word “cell,” “germinal 
matter,” or “carmine,” without a sort of inward 
shudder. 
Well, now, gentlemen, I am sure my colleagues 
in this examination will bear me out in saying
-P-A-G-E-319
  XI ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 811 
that I have not been exaggerating the evils and 
defects which are current—have been current—in 
a large quantity of the physiological teaching 
the results of which come before examiners. 
And it becomes a very interesting question to 
know how all this comes about, and in what way 
it can be remedied. How it comes about will be 
perfectly obvious to any one who has considered 
the growth of medicine. I suppose that medicine 
and surgery first began by some savage more 
intelligent than the rest, discovering that a certain 
herb was good for a certain pain, and that a 
certain pull, somehow or other, set a dislocated 
joint right. I suppose all things had their 
humble beginnings, and medicine and surgery 
were in the same condition. People who wear 
watches know nothing about watchmaking. A 
watch goes wrong and it stops; you see the 
owner giving it a shake, or, if he is very bold, he 
opens the case, and gives the balance-wheel a 
push. Gentlemen, that is empirical practice, and 
you know what are the results upon the watch. 
I should think you can divine what are the results 
of analogous operations upon the human body. 
And because men of sense very soon found that 
such were the effects of meddling with very com- 
plicated machinery they did not understand, I 
suppose the first thing, as being the easiest, was 
to study the nature of the works of the human 
watch, and the next thing was to study the way 
80
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION xi 
the parts worked together, and the way the watch 
worked. Thus, by degrees, we have had growing 
up our body of anatomists, or knowers of the con- 
struction of the human watch, and our physiolo- 
gists, who know how the machine works. And 
just as any sensible. man, who has a valuable 
watch, does not meddle with it himself, but goes 
to some one who has studied watchmaking, and 
understands what the effect of doing this or that 
may be; so, I suppose, the man who, having 
charge of that valuable machine, his own body, 
wants to have it kept in good order, comes to a . 
professor of the medical art for the purpose of 
having it set right, believing that, by deduction 
from the facts of structure and from the facts 
of function, the physician will divine what may 
be the matter with his bodily watch at that 
particular time, and what may be the best means 
of setting it right. If that may be taken as a 
just representation of the relation of the theoreti- 
cal branches of medicine—what we may call the 
institutes of medicine, to use an old term—to the 
practical branches, I think it will be obvious to 
you that they are of prime and fundamental 
importance. Whatever tends to affect the teach- 
ing of them injuriously must tend to destroy and 
to disorganise the whole fabric of the medical art. 
I think every sensible man has seen this long ago; 
but the difficulties in the way of attaining good 
teaching in the different branches of the theory,
-P-A-G-E-321
XIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 313 
or institutes, of medicine are very serious. It is a 
comparatively easy matter—pray mark that I use 
the word “ comparatively ”—it is a comparatively 
easy matter to learn anatomy and to teach it; it 
is a very difficult matter to learn physiology and 
to teach it. It is a very difficult matter to know 
and to teach those branches of physics and those 
branches of chemistry which bear directly upon 
physiology; and hence it is that, as a matter of 
fact, the teaching of physiology, and the teaching 
of the physics and the chemistry which bear upon 
it, must necessarily be in a state of relative 
imperfection; and there is nothing to be grumbled 
at in the fact that this relative imperfection exists. 
But is the relative imperfection which exists only 
such as is necessary, or is it made worse by our 
practical arrangements? I believe—and if I did 
not so believe I should not have troubled you 
with these observations—I believe it is made 
infinitely worse by our practical arrangements, 
or rather, I ought to say, our very unpractical 
arrangements. Some very wise man long ago 
affirmed that every question, in the long run, was 
a question of finance; and there is a good \deal to 
be said for that view. Most assuredly the question 
of medical teaching is, in a very large and broad 
sense, a question of finance. What I mean is 
this: that in London the arrangements of the 
medical schools, and the number of them, are 
such as to render it almost impossible that men  
-P-A-G-E-322
314 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION XIE 
who confine themselves to the teaching of the 
theoretical branches of the profession should be 
able to make their bread by that operation; and, 
you know, if a man cannot make his bread he 
cannot teach—at least his teaching comes to a 
speedy end. That is a matter of physiology. 
Anatomy is fairly well taught, because it lies in 
the direction of practice, and a man is all the 
better surgeon for being a good anatomist. It 
does not absolutely interfere with the pursuits of 
a practical surgeon if he should hold a Chair of 
Anatomy—though I do not for one moment say 
that he would not be a better teacher if he did 
not devote himself to practice. (Applause.) Yes, 
I know exactly what that cheer means, but I am 
keeping as carefully as possible from any sort 
of allusion to Professor Ellis. But the fact is, 
that even human anatomy has now grown to be 
so large a matter, that it takes the whole devotion 
of a man’s life to put the great mass of knowledge 
upon that subject into such a shape that it can 
be teachable to the mind of the ordinary student. 
What the student wants in a professor is a man 
who shall stand between him and the infinite 
diversity and variety of human knowledge, and 
who shall gather all that together, and extract 
from it that which is capable of*being assimilated 
by the mind. That function is a vast and an 
important one, and unless, in such subjects as 
anatomy, a man is wholly free from other cares, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  xr ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 815 
is almost impossible that he can perform it 
thoroughly and well. But if it be hardly possible 
for a man to pursue anatomy without actually 
breaking with his profession, how is it possible for 
him to pursue physiology? 
I get every year those very elaborate reports of 
Henle and Meissner—volumes of, I suppose, 400 
pages altogether—and they consist merely of 
abstracts of the memoirs and works which have 
been written on Anatomy and Physiology—only 
abstracts of them! How is a man to keep up his 
acquaintance with all that is doing in the 
physiological world—in a world advancing with 
enormous strides every day and every hour—if 
he has to be distracted with the cares of practice? 
You know very well it must be impracticable to do 
so. Our men of ability join our medical schools 
with an eye to the future. They take the Chairs 
of Anatomy or of Physiology; and by and by they 
leave those Chairs for the more profitable pursuits 
into which they have drifted by professional 
success, and so they become clothed, and phys- 
iology is bare. The result is, that in those 
schools in which physiology is thus left to the 
benevolence, so to speak, of those who have no 
time to look to it, the effect of such teaching 
comes out obviously, and is made manifest in 
what I spoke of just now—the unreality, the 
bookishness of the knowledge of the taught. 
And if this is the case in physiology, still more
-P-A-G-E-324
  316 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION xr 
must it be the case in those branches of physics 
which are the foundation of physiology; although 
it may be less the case in chemistry, because for 
an able chemist a certain honourable and inde- 
pendent career lies in the direction of his work, 
and he is able, like the anatomist, to look upon 
what he may teach to the student as not abso- 
lutely taking him away from his bread-winning 
pursuits. 
But it is of no use to grumble about this state 
of things unless one is prepared to indicate some 
sort of practical remedy. And I believe—and I 
venture to make the statement because I am 
wholly independent of all sorts of medical schools, 
and may, therefore, say what I believe without 
being supposed to be affected by any personal 
interest—but I say I believe that the remedy for 
this state of things, for that imperfection of our 
theoretical knowledge which keeps down the 
ability of England at the present time in medical 
matters, is a mere affair of mechanical arrange- 
ment; that so long as you have a dozen medical 
schools scattered about in different parts of the 
metropolis, and dividing the students among 
them, so long, in all the smaller schools at any 
rate, it is impossible that any other state of 
things than that which I have been depicting 
should obtain. Professors must live; to live they 
must occupy themselves with practice, and if they 
occupy themselves with practice, the pursuit of
-P-A-G-E-325
XIE ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 317 
the abstract branches of science must go to the 
wall. All this is a plain and obvious matter of 
common-sense reasoning. I believe you will 
never alter this state of things until, either by 
consent or by force majeure—and I should be very 
sorry to see the latter applied—but until there 
is some new arrangement, and until all the 
theoretical branches of the profession, the insti- 
tutes of medicine, are taught in London in not 
more than one or two, or at the outside three, cen- 
tral institutions, no good will be effected. If that 
large body of men, the medical students of 
London, were obliged in the first place to get a 
knowledge of the theoretical branches of their 
profession in two or three central schools, there 
would be abundant means for maintaining able 
professors—not, indeed, for enriching them, as 
they would be able to enrich themselves by 
practice—but for enabling them to make that 
choice which such men are so willing to make; 
namely, the choice between wealth and a mod- 
est competency, when that modest competency 
is to be combined with a scientific career, 
and the means of advancing knowledge. I do 
not believe that all the talking about, and tin- 
kering of, medical education will do the slight- 
est good until the fact is clearly recognised, 
that men must be thoroughly grounded in 
the theoretical branches of their profession, 
and that to this end the teaching of those theoret-  
-P-A-G-E-326
318 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION XII 
ical branches must be confined to two or three 
centres. 
Now let me add one other word, and that is, 
that if I were a despot, I would cut down these 
-branches to a very considerable extent. The next 
‘ thing to be done beyond that which I mentioned 
just now, is to go back to primary education. 
The great step towards a thorough medical educa- 
tion is to insist upon the teaching of the elements 
of the physical sciences in all schools, so that 
medical students shall not go up to the medical 
colleges utterly ignorant of that with which they 
have to deal; to insist on the elements of chem- 
istry, the elements of botany, and the elements of 
physics being taught in our ordinary and common 
schools, so that there shall be some preparation 
for the discipline of medical colleges. And, if 
this reform were once effected, you might confine 
the “ Institutes of Medicine ” to physics as.applied 
to physiology—to chemistry as applied to physi- 
ology—to physiology itself, and to anatomy. 
Afterwards, the student, thoroughly grounded in 
these matters, might go to any hospital he pleased 
for the purpose of studying the practical branches 
of his profession. The practical teaching might 
be made as local as you like; and you might use 
to advantage the opportunities afforded by all 
these local institutions for acquiring a knowledge 
of the practice of the profession. But you may say: 
“This is abolishing a great deal; you are getting 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  xml ON MEDICAL EDUCATION 319 
rid of botany and zoology to begin with.” I have 
not a doubt that they ought to be got rid of, as 
branches of special medical education; they 
ought to be put back to an earlier stage, and 
made branches of general education. Let me say, 
by way of self-denying ordinance, for which you 
will, I am sure, give me credit, that I believe that 
comparative anatomy ought to be absolutely 
volished. I say so, not without a certain fear of 
the Vice-Chancellor of the University of London 
who sits upon my left. But I do not think the 
charter gives him very much power over me; 
moreover, I shall soon come to an end of my 
examinership, and therefore I am not afraid, but 
all go on to say what I was going to say, and 
hat is, that in my belief it is a downright cruelty 
—I have no other word for it—to require from 
gentlemen who are engaged in medical studies, 
the pretence—for it is nothing else, and can be 
nothing else, than a pretence—of a knowledge of 
comparative anatomy as part of their medical 
curriculum. Make it part of their Arts teaching 
you like, make it part of their general education 
you like, make it part of their qualification for 
he scientific degree by all means—that is its 
proper place; but to require that gentlemen whose 
whole faculties should be bent upon the acquire- 
ment of a real knowledge of human physiology 
should worry themselves with getting up hearsay 
about the alternation of generations in the Salpz © +t

is really monstrous. I cannot characterise it in 
any other way. And having sacrificed my own 
pursuit, I am sure I may sacrifice other people’s; 
and I make this remark with all the more willing- 
ness because I discovered, on reading the names 
of your Professors just now, that the Professor of 
Materia Medica is not present. I must confess, if 
I had my way I should abolish Materia Medica * 
altogether. I recollect, when I was first under 
examination at the University of London, Dr. 
Pereira was the 
Pereira’s “ Materi 
bus rebus. I re examiner, and you know that 
a Medica” was a book de omni- 
collect my struggles with that 
book late at night and early in the morning (I 
worked very hard 
that I got that 
other, but then I in those days), and I do believe 
ook into my head somehow or 
will undertake to say that I for- 
got it all a week afterwards. Not one trace of a 
knowledge of drugs has remained in my memory 
from that time to this; and really, as a matter 
of common sense, I cannot understand the argu- 
ments for obliging a medical man to know all about 
drugs and where they come from. Why not make 
him belong to the Iron and Steel Institute, and 
learn something about cutlery, because he uses 
knives? 
But do not suppose that, after all these deduc- 
tions, there would not be ample room for your   *Tt will, I hope, be understood that I do not include 
Therapeutics under this head.

activity. Let us count up what we have left. I 
suppose all the time for medical education that 
can be hoped for is, at the outside, about four 
years. Well, what have you to master in those 
four years upon my supposition? Physics applied 
to physiology; chemistry applied to physiology; 
physiology; anatomy; surgery; medicine (includ- 
ing therapeutics); obstetrics; hygiene; and medi- 
cal jurisprudence—nine subjects for four years! 
And when you consider what those subjects are, 
and that the acquisition of anything beyond the 
rudiments of any one of them may tax the en- 
ergies of a lifetime, I think that even those ener- 
gies which you young gentlemen have been dis- 
playing for the last hour or two might be taxed to 
keep you thoroughly up to what is wanted for 
your medical career. 
I entertain a very strong conviction that any 
one who adds to medical education one iota or 
tittle beyond what is absolutely necessary, is guilty 
of a very grave offence. Gentlemen, it will de- 
pend upon the knowledge that you happen to 
possess,—upon your means of applying it within 
your own field of action,—whether the bills of 
mortality in your district are increased or dimin- 
ished; and that, gentlemen, is a very serious con- 
sideration indeed. And, under those circum- 
stances, the subjects with which you have to deal 
being so difficult, their extent so enormous, and 
the time at your disposal so limited, I could not

feel my conscience easy if I did not, on such an 
occasion as this, raise a protest against employing 
your energies upon the acquisition of any knowl- 
edge which may not be absolutely needed in your

THE STATE AND THE MEDICAL 
PROFESSION 
[1884] 
At intervals during the last quarter of a cen- 
tury committees of the Houses of the Legislature 
and specially appointed commissions have occu- 
pied themselves with the affairs of the medical 
profession. Much evidence has been taken, much 
wrangling has gone on over the reports of these 
bodies; and sometimes much trouble has been 
taken to get measures based upon all this work 
through Parliament, but very little has been 
achieved. 
The Bill introduced last session was not more . 
fortunate than several predecessors. I suppose 
that it is not right to rejoice in the misfortunes of 
anything, even a Bill; but I confess that this 
event afforded me lively satisfaction, for I was a 
member of the Royal Commission on the report 
823 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
  324 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xm 
of which the Bill was founded, and I did my best 
to oppose and nullify that report. 
That the question must be taken up again 
and finally dealt with by the Legislature before 
long cannot be doubted; but in the meanwhile 
there is time for reflection, and I think that the 
non-medical public would be wise if they paid a 
little attention to a subject which is really of con- 
siderable importance to them. 
The first question which a plain man is dis- 
posed to ask himself is, Why should the State in- 
terfere with the profession of medicine any more 
than it does, say, with the profession of engineer- 
ing? Anybody who pleases may call himself an 
engineer, and many practice as such. The State 
confers no title upon engineers, and does not pro- 
fess to tell the public that one man is a qualified 
engineer and that another is not so. 
The answers which are given to the question 
are various, and most of them, I think, are bad. 
A large number of persons seem to be of opinion 
that the State is bound no less to take care of the 
general public, than to see that it is protected 
against incompetent persons, against quacks and 
medical impostors in general. I do not take that 
view of the case. I think it is very much whole- 
somer for the public to take care of itself in this 
as in all other matters; and although I am not 
such a fanatic for the liberty of the subject as to 
plead that interfering with the way in which a
-P-A-G-E-333
  xt STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 395 
man may choose to be killed is a violation of that 
liberty, yet I do think that it is far better to 
let everybody do as he likes. Whether that be so 
or not, I am perfectly certain that, as a matter of 
practice, it is absolutely impossible to prohibit the 
practice of medicine by people who have no spe- 
cial qualification for it. Consider the terrible con- 
sequences of attempting to prohibit practice by a 
very large class of persons who are certainly not 
technically qualified—I am far from saying a word 
as to whether they are otherwise qualified or not. 
The number of Ladies Bountiful—grandmothers, 
aunts, and mothers-in-law—whose chief delight 
lies in the administration of their cherished pro- 
vision of domestic medicine, is past computation, 
and one shudders to think of what might happen 
if their energies were turned from this innocuous, 
if not beneficent channel, by the strong arm of the 
law. But the thing is impracticable. 
Another reason for intervention is propounded, 
I am sorry to say, by some, though not many, 
members of the medical profession, and is simply 
an expression of that trades unionism which tends 
to infest professions no less than trades. 
The general practitioner trying to make both 
ends meet on a poor practice, whose medical train- 
ing has cost him a good deal of time and money, 
finds that many potential patients, whose small 
fees would be welcome as the little that helps, 
prefer to go and get their shilling’s worth of “ doc-  
-P-A-G-E-334
  326 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xm 
tor’s stuff ” and advice from the chemist and drug- 
gist round the corner, who has not paid sixpence 
for his medical training, because he has never 
had any. 
The general practitioner thinks this is very 
hard upon him and ought to be stopped. It is 
perhaps natural that he should think so, though 
it would be very difficult for him to justify his 
opinion on any ground of public policy. But the 
question is really not worth discussion, as it is ob- 
vious that it would be utterly impracticable to 
stop the practice “over the counter” even if it 
were desirable. 
Is a man who has a sudden attack of pain 
in tooth or stomach not to be permitted to go to 
the nearest druggist’s shop and ask for something 
that will relieve him? The notion is preposterous. 
But if this is to be legal, the whole principle of the 
permissibility of counter practice is granted. 
In my judgment the intervention of the State 
in the affairs of the medical profession can be jus- 
tified not upon any pretence of protecting the pub- 
lic, and still less upon that of protecting the med- 
ical profession, but simply and solely upon the fact 
that the State employs medical men for certain 
purposes, and, as employer, has a right to define 
the conditions on which it will accept service. It 
is for the interest of the community that no person 
shall die without there being some official recogni- 
tion of the cause of his death. It is a matter of   
 
-P-A-G-E-335
xmur STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 397 
* the highest importance to the community that, in 
civil and criminal cases, the law shall be able to 
have recourse to persons whose evidence may be 
taken as that of experts; and it will not be 
doubted that the State has a right to dictate the 
conditions under which it will appoint persons 
to the vast number of naval, military, and civil 
medical offices held directly or indirectly under 
the Government. Here, and here only, it appears 
to me, lies the justification for the intervention 
of the State in medical affairs. It says, or, in 
my judgment, should say, to the public, “ Prac- 
tice medicine if you like—go to be practised upon 
by anybody;” and to the medical practitioner, 
“ Have a qualification, or do not have a qualifica- 
tion, if people don’t mind it; but if the State is to 
receive your certificate of death, if the State is to 
take your evidence as that of an expert,, if the 
State is to give you any kind of civil, or military, 
or naval appointment, then we can call upon you 
to comply with our conditions, and to produce 
evidence that you are, in our sense of the word, 
qualified. Without that we will not place you 
in that position.” As a matter of fact, that is the 
relation of the State to the medical profession in 
this country. For my part, I think it an extreme- 
ly healthy relation; and it is one that I should be 
very sorry to see altered, except in so far that it 
would certainly be better if greater facilities were 
given for the swift and sharp punishment of those 
81
-P-A-G-E-336
  398 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xm 
who profess to have the State qualification when, 
in point of fact, they do not possess it. They are 
simply cheats and swindlers, like other people who 
profess to be what they are not, and should be pun- 
ished as such. 
But supposing we are agreed about the justi- 
fication of State intervention in medical affairs, 
new questions arise as to the manner in which 
that intervention should take place and the extent 
to which it should go, on which the divergence of 
opinion is even greater than it is on the general 
question of intervention. 
It is now, I am sorry to say, something over 
forty years since I began my medical studies; and, 
at that time, the state of affairs was extremely 
singular. J should think it hardly possible that 
it could have obtained anywhere but in such a 
country as England, which cherishes a fine old 
crusted abuse as much as it does its port wine. 
At that time there were twenty-one licensing 
bodies—that is to say, bodies whose certificate 
was received by the State as evidence that the 
experts. How these bodies came to possess these 
powers is a very curious chapter in history, in 
which it would be out of place to enlarge. They 
were partly universities, partly medical guilds and 
corporations, partly the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
Those were the three sources from which the 
licence to practise came in that day. There was
-P-A-G-E-337
  xm STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 3929 
no central authority, there was nothing to pre- 
vent any one of those licensing authorities from 
granting a licence to any one upon any conditions 
it thought fit. The examination might be a sham, 
the curriculum might be a sham, the certificate 
might be bought and sold like anything in a shop; 
or, on the other hand, the examination might 
be fairly good and the diploma correspondingly 
valuable; but there was not the smallest guaran- 
tee, except the personal character of the people 
who composed the administration of each of these 
licensing bodies, as to what might happen. It 
was possible for a young man to come to London 
and to spend two years and six months of the 
time in his compulsory three years “ walking the 
hospitals” in idleness or worse; he could then, 
by putting himself in the hands of a judicious 
“ grinder ” for the remaining six months, pass tri- 
umphantly through the ordeal of one hour’s vivé 
voce examination, which was all that was abso- 
lutely necessary, to enable him to be turned loose 
upon the public, like death on the pale horse, 
“conquering and to conquer,” with the full sanc- 
tion of the law, as a “ qualified practitioner.” 
It is difficult to imagine, at present, such a 
state of things, still more difficult to depict the 
consequences of it, because they would appear like 
a gross and malignant caricature; but it may be 
said that there was never a system, or want of 
system, which was better calculated to ruin the 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  330 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xur 
students who came under it, or to degrade the pro- 
fession as a whole. My memory goes back to a 
time when models from whom the Bob Sawyer of 
the Pickwick Papers might have been drawn were 
anything but rare. 
Shortly before my student days, however, the 
dawn of a better state of things in England began 
to be visible, in consequence of the establishment 
of the University of London, and the compara- 
tively very high standard which it placed before 
its medical graduates. 
I say comparatively high standard, for the re- 
quirements of the University in those days, and 
even during the twelve years at a later period, 
when I was one of the examiners of the medical 
faculty, were such as would not now be thought 
more than respectable, and indeed were in many 
respects very imperfect. But, relatively to the 
means of learning, the standard was high, and 
none but the more able and ambitious of the 
students dreamed of passing the University. 
Nevertheless, the fact that many men of this 
stamp did succeed in obtaining their degrees, led 
others to follow in their steps, and slowly but 
surely reacted upon the standard of teaching in 
the better medical schools. Then came the 
Medical Act of 1858. That Act introduced two 
immense improvements: one of them was the in- 
stitution of what is called the Medical Register, 
upon which the names of all persons recognised 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
xut STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 331 
by the State as medical practitioners are entexed; 
and the other was the establishment of the 
Medical Council, which is a kind of Medical 
Parliament, composed of representatives of the 
licensing bodies and of leading men in the medical 
profession nominated by the Crown. The powers 
given by the Legislature to the Medical Council 
were found practically to be very limited, but I 
think that no fair observer of the work will doubt 
that this much attacked body has excited no small 
influence in bringing about the great change for 
the better, which has been effected in the train- 
ing of men for the medical profession within my 
recollection. 
Another source of improvement must be recog- 
nised in the Scottish Universities, and especially 
in the medical faculty of the University of Edin- 
burgh. The medical education and examinations 
of this body were for many years the best of their 
kind in these islands, and I doubt if, at the pres- 
ent moment, the three kingdoms can show a bet- 
ter school of medicine than that of Edinburgh. 
The vast number of medical students at that Uni- 
versity is sufficient evidence of the opinion of 
those most interested in this subject. 
Owing to all these influences, and to the revo- 
lution which has taken place in the course of the 
last twenty years in our conceptions of the proper 
method of teaching physical science, the training 
of the medical student in a good school, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  832 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION x1 
examination test applied by the great majority of 
the present licensing bodies, reduced now to nine- 
teen, in consequence of the retirement of the 
Archbishop and the fusion of two of the other 
licensing bodies, are totally different from what 
they were even twenty years ago. 
I was perfectly astonished, upon one of my 
sons commencing his medical career the other day, 
when I contrasted the carefully-watched courses 
of theoretical and practical instruction, which he 
is expected to follow with regularity and industry, 
and the number and nature of the examinations 
which he will have to pass before he can receive 
his licence, not only with the monstrous laxity of 
my own student days, but even with the state of 
things which obtained when my term of office as 
examiner in the University of London expired 
some sixteen years ago. 
I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion, 
which is fully borne out by the evidence taken 
before the late Royal Commission, that a large 
proportion of the existing licensing bodies grant 
their licence on conditions which ensure quite as 
high a standard as it is practicable or advisable to 
exact under present circumstances, and that they 
show every desire to keep pace with the improve- 
ments of the times. And I think there can be 
no doubt that the great majority have so much 
improved their ways, that their standard is far 
above that of the ordinary qualification thirty
-P-A-G-E-341
xut STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 333 
years ago, and I cannot see what excuse there 
would be for meddling with them if it were not 
for two other defects which have to be reme- 
died. 
Unfortunately there remain two or three black 
sheep—licensing bodies which simply trade upon 
their privilege, and sell the cheapest wares they 
can for shame’s sake supply to the bidder. An- 
other defect in the existing system, even where 
the examination has been so greatly improved as 
to be good of its kind, is that there are certain 
licensing bodies which give a qualification for an 
acquaintance with either medicine or surgery 
alone, and which more or less ignore obstetrics. 
This is a revival of the archaic condition of the 
profession when surgical operations were mostly 
left to the barbers and obstetrics to the mid- 
wives, and when the physicians thought them- 
selves, and were considered by the world, the 
“superior persons” of the profession. I remem- 
ber a story was current in my young days of a 
great court physician who was travelling with a 
friend, like himself, bound on a visit to a country 
house. The friend fell down in an apoplectic fit, 
and the physician refused to bleed him because 
it was contrary to professional etiquette for a 
physician to perform that operation. Whether 
the friend died or whether he got better because 
he was not bled I do not remember, but the moral 
of the story is the same. On the other hand, a
-P-A-G-E-342
834 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xur 
famous surgeon was asked whether he meant to 
bring up his son to his own calling, “No,” he 
said, “he is such a fool, I mean to make a physi- 
cian of him.” 
Nowadays, it is happily recognised that medi- 
cine is one and indivisible, and that no one can 
properly practise one branch who is not familiar 
with at any rate the principles of all. Thus the 
two great things that are wanted now are, in the 
first place, some means of enforcing such a degree 
of uniformity upon all the examining bodies that 
none should present a disgracefully low minimum 
or pass examination; and the second point is that 
some body or other shall have the power of en- 
forcing upon every candidate for the licence to 
practise the study of the three branches, what 
is called the tripartite qualification. All the mem- 
bers of the late commission were agreed that these 
were the main points to be attended to in any 
proposals for the further improvement of medical 
training and qualification. 
But such being the ends in view, our notions 
as to the best way of attaining them were singu- 
larly divergent; so that it came about that eleven 
commissioners made seven reports. There was 
one main majority report and six minor reports, 
which differed more or less from it, chiefly as to 
the best method of attaining these two objects. 
The majority report recommended the adop- 
tion of what is known as the conjoint scheme.  
-P-A-G-E-343
  xmr STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 335 
According to this plan the power of granting a 
licence to practise is to be taken away from all 
the existing bodies, whether they have done well 
or ill, and to be placed in the hands of a body 
of delegates (divisional boards), one for each of 
the three kingdoms. ‘The licence to practise is to 
be conferred by passing the delegate examination. 
The licensee may afterwards, if he pleases, go 
before any of the existing bodies and indulge in 
the luxury of another examination and the pay- 
ment of another fee in order to obtain a title, 
which does not legally place him in any better po- 
sition than that which he would occupy without it. 
Under these circumstances, of course, the only 
motive for obtaining the degree of a University or 
the licence of a medical corporation would be 
the prestige of these bodies. Hence the “ black 
sheep ” would certainly be deserted, while those 
bodies which have acquired a reputation by doing 
their duty would suffer less. 
But, as the majority report proposes that the 
existing bodies should be compensated for any loss 
they might suffer out of the fees of the examiners 
for the State licence, the curious result would be 
brought about that the profession of the future 
would be taxed, for all time, for the purpose of 
handing over to wholly irresponsible bodies a sum, 
the amount of which would be large for those 
who had failed in their duty and small for those 
who had done it. 
   
-P-A-G-E-344
    336 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xm 
The scheme in fact involved a perpetual en- 
dowment of the “black sheep,” calculated on the 
maximum of their ill-gained profits.* I confess 
that I found myself unable to consent to a plan 
which, in addition to the rewarding the evil doers, 
proposed to take away the privileges of a num- 
ber of examining bodies which confessedly were 
doing their duty well, for the sake of getting 
rid of a few who had failed. It was too much 
like the Chinaman’s device of burning down his 
house to obtain a poor dish of roast pig—uncer- 
tain whether in the end he might not find a mere 
mass of cinders. What we do know is that the 
great majority of the existing licensing bodies 
have marvellously improved in the course of the 
last twenty years, and are improving. What we 
do not know is that the complicated scheme of 
the divisional boards will ever be got to work 
at all. 
My own belief is that every necessary reform 
may be affected, without any interference with 
vested interests, without any unjust interference 
with the prestige of institutions which have been,

and still are, extremely valuable, without any ques- 
tion of compensation arising, and by an extremely 
simple operation. It is only necessary in fact to 
add a couple of clauses to the Medical Act to 
this effect: (1) That from and after such a date 
no person shall be placed upon the Medical Reg- 
ister unless he possesses the threefold qualifica- 
tion. (2) That from and after this date no ex- 
amination shall be accepted as satisfactory from 
any licensing body except such as has been carried 
on in part by examiners appointed by the licens- 
ing body, and in part by coadjutor-examiners of 
equal authority appointed by the Medical Council 
or other central authority, and acting under their 
instructions. 
In laying down a rule of this kind the State 
confiscates nothing, and meddles with nobody, 
but simply acts within its undoubted right of 
laying down the conditions under which it will 
confer certain privileges upon medical practi- 
tioners. No one can say that the State has not 
the right to do this; no one can say that the 
Sate interferes with any private enterprise or 
corporate interest unjustly, in laying down its 
own conditions for its own service. The plan 
would have the further advantage that all those 
corporate bodies which have obtained (as many of 
them have) a great and just prestige by the ad- 
mirable way in which they have done their work, 
would reap their just reward in the thronging
-P-A-G-E-346
  838 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION Xu 
of students, thenceforward as formerly, to ob- 
tain their qualifications; while those who have 
neglected their duties, who have in some one or 
two cases, I am sorry to say, absolutely disgraced 
themselves, would sink into oblivion, and come 
to a happy and natural euthanasia, in which their 
misdeeds and themselves would be entirely for- 
gotten. 
Two of my colleagues, Professor Turner and 
Mr. Bryce, M. P., whose practical familiarity with 
examinations gave their opinions a high value, ex- 
pressed their substantial approval of this scheme, 
and I am unable to see the weight of the objec- 
tions urged against it. It is urged that the diffi- 
culty and expense of adequately inspecting so 
many examinations and of guaranteeing their effi- 
ciency would be great, and the difficulty in the 
way of a fair adjustment of the representation of 
existing interests and of the representation of new 
interests upon the general Medical Council would 
be almost insuperable. 
The latter objection is unintelligible to me. I 
am not aware that any attempt at such adjustment 
has been fairly discussed, and until that has been 
done it may be well not to talk about insuperable 
difficulties. As to the notion that there is any 
difficulty in getting the coadjutor-examiners, or 
that the expense will be overwhelming, we have 
the experience of Scotland, in which every Uni- 
versity does, at the present time, appoint its coad-

jutor-examiners, who do their work just in the 
way proposed. 
Whether in the way I have proposed, or by 
the Conjoint Scheme, however, this is perfectly 
certain: the two things I refer to have to be 
done: you must have the threefold qualification; 
you must have the limitation of the minimum 
qualification also; and any scheme for the im- 
provement of the relations of the State to 
medicine which does not profess to do these two 
things thoroughly and well, has no chance of 
finality. 
But when these reforms are witnessed, when 
there is a Medical Council armed with a more 
real authority than it at present possesses; when 
a licence to practise cannot be obtained without 
the threefold qualification; and when an even 
minimum of qualification is exacted for every li- 
cence, is there anything else that remains that 
any one seriously interested in the welfare of the 
medical profession, as I may most conscientiously 
declare myself to be, would like to see done? I 
think there are three things. 
In the first place, even now, when a four years’ 
curriculum is required, the time allotted for 
medical education is too brief. A young man of 
eighteen beginning to study medicine is probably 
absolutely ignorant of the existence of such a 
thing as anatomy, or physiology, or indeed of any 
branch of physical science. He comes into an 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  840 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xin 
entirely new world; he addresses himself to a kind 
of work of which he has not the smallest ex- 
perience. Up to that time his work has been 
with books; he rushes suddenly into work with 
things, which is as different from work with books 
as anything can well be. I am quite sure that a 
very considerable number of young men spend a 
very large portion of their first session in simply 
learning how to learn subjects which are entirely 
new to them. And yet recollect that in this 
period of four years they have to acquire a 
knowledge of all the branches of a great and re- 
sponsible practical calling of medicine, surgery, 
obstetrics, general pathology, medical jurispru- 
dence, and so forth. Anybody who knows what 
these things are, and who knows what is the kind 
of work which is necessary to give a man the 
confidence which will enable him to stand at the 
bedside and say to the satisfaction of his own 
conscience what shall be done, and what shall not 
be done, must be aware that if a man has only 
four years to do all that in he will not have much 
time to spare. But that is not all. As I have 
said, the young man comes up, probably ignorant 
of the existence of science; he has never heard a 
word of chemistry, he has never heard a word of 
physics, he has not the smallest conception of the 
outlines of biological science; and all these things 
have to be learned as well and crammed into the 
time which in itself is barely sufficient to acquire
-P-A-G-E-349
  xm STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 341 
a fair amount of that knowledge which is requisite 
for the satisfactory discharge of his professional 
duties. 
Therefore it is quite clear to me that, somehow 
or other, the curriculum must be lightened. It 
is not that any of the subjects which I have 
mentioned need not to be studied, and may be 
eliminated. The only alternative therefore is to 
lengthen the time given to study. Everybody 
will agree with me that the practical necessities 
of life in this country are such that, for the aver- 
age medical practitioner at any rate, it is hope- 
less to think of extending the period of profes- 
sional study beyond the age of twenty-two. So 
that as the period of study cannot be extended for- 
wards, the only thing to be done is to extend it 
backwards. 
The question is how this can be done. My 
own belief is that if the Medical Council, instead 
of insisting upon that examination in general edu- 
cation which I am sorry to say I believe to be 
entirely futile, were to insist upon a knowledge of 
elementary physics, and chemistry, and biology, 
they would be taking one of the greatest steps 
which at present can be made for the improvement 
of medical education. And the improvement 
would be this. The great majority of the young 
men who are going into the profession have 
practically completed their general education—or 
they might very well have done so—by the age
-P-A-G-E-350
  842 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xm 
of sixteen or seventeen. If the interval between 
this age and that at which they commence their 
purely medical studies were employed in obtaining 
a practical acquaintance with elementary physics, 
chemistry, and biology, in my judgment it would 
be as good as two years added to the course of 
medical study. And for two reasons: in the 
first place, because the subject-matter of that 
which they would learn is germane to their 
future studies, and is so much gained; in the 
second place, because you might clear out of the 
course of their professional study a great deal 
which at present occupies time and attention; and 
last, but not least—probably most—they would 
then come to their medical studies prepared for 
that learning from Nature which is what they 
have to do in the course of becoming skilful med- 
ical men, and for which at present they are not 
in the slightest degree prepared by their previous 
education. 
The second wish I have to express concerns 
London especially, and I may speak of it briefly 
as a more economical use of the teaching power 
in the medical schools. At this present time 
every great hospital in London—and there are 
ten or eleven of them—has its complete medical 
school, in which not only are the branches of 
practical medicine taught, but also those studies 
in general science, such as chemistry, elementary 
physics, general anatomy, and a variety of other 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
xt STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION 343 
topics which are what used to be called (and the 
term was an extremely useful one) the institutes 
of medicine. That was all very well half a cen- 
tury ago; it is all very ill now, simply because 
those general branches of science, such as anat- 
omy, physiology, chemistry, physiological chemis- 
try, physiological physics, and so forth, have now 
become so large, and the mode of teaching them 
is so completely altered, that it is absolutely im- 
possible for any man to be a thoroughly com- 
petent teacher of them, or for any student to be 
effectually taught without the devotion of the 
whole time of the person who is engaged in teach- 
ing. I undertake to say that it is hopelessly im- 
possible for any man at the present time to keep 
abreast with the progress of physiology unless he 
gives his whole mind to it; and the bigger the 
mind is, the more scope he will find for its em- 
ployment. Again, teaching has become, and must 
become still more, practical, and that also involves 
a large expenditure of time. But if a man is to 
give his whole time to my business he must live 
by it, and the resources of the schools do not per- 
mit them to maintain ten or eleven physiological 
specialists. 
If the students in their first one or two years 
were taught the institutes of medicine, in two or 
three central institutions, it would be perfectly 
easy to have those subjects taught thoroughly and 
effectually by persons who gave their whole mind 
82
-P-A-G-E-352
  344 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xin 
and attention to the subject; while at the same 
time the medical schools at the hospitals would 
remain what they ought to be—great institutions 
in which the largest possible opportunities are 
laid open for acquiring practical acquaintance 
with the phenomena of disease. So that the pre- 
liminary or earlier half of medical education 
would take place in the central institutions, and 
the final half would be devoted altogether to prac- 
tical studies in the hospitals. 
I happen to know that this conception has 
been entertained, not only by myself, but by a 
great many of those persons who are most inter- 
ested in the improvement of medical study for a 
considerable number of years. I do not know 
whether anything will come of it this half-century 
or not; but the thing has to be done. It is not a 
speculative notion; it lies patent to everybody who 
is accustomed to teaching, and knows what the 
necessities of teaching are; and I should very 
much like to see the first step taken—people mak- 
ing up their minds that it has to be done somehow 
or other. 
The last point to which I may advert is one 
which concerns the action of the profession itself 
more than anything else. We have arrangements 
for teaching, we have arrangements for the test- 
ing of qualifications, we have marvellous aids and 
appliances for the treatment of disease in all sorts 
of ways; but I do not find in London at the pres-
-P-A-G-E-353

ent time, in this little place of four or five million 
inhabitants which supports so many things, any 
organisation or any arrangement for advancing 
the science of medicine, considered as a pure sci- 
ence. I am quite aware that there are medical 
societies of various kinds; I am not ignorant of 
the lectureships at the College of Physicians and 
the College of Surgeons; there is the Brown In- 
stitute; and there is the Society for the Advance- 
ment of Medicine by Research, but there is no 
means, so far as I know, by which any person who 
has the inborn gifts of the investigator and dis- 
coverer of new truth, and who desires to apply 
that to the improvement of medical science, can 
carry out his intention. In Paris there is the Uni- 
versity of Paris, which gives degrees; but there 
are also the Sorbonne and the Collége de France, 
places in which professoriates are established for 
the express purpose of enabling men who have the 
power of investigation, the power of advancing 
knowledge and thereby reacting on practice, to do 
that which it is their special mission to do. I do 
not know of anything of the kind in London; and 
if it should so happen that a Claude Bernard or 
a Ludwig should turn up in London, I really have 
not the slightest notion of what we could do with 
him. We could not turn him to account, and I 
think we should have to export him to Germany 
or France. I doubt whether that is a good or a 
wise condition of things. I do not think it is a  
-P-A-G-E-354
  
346 STATE AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION xu 
condition of things which can exist for any great 
length of time, now that people are every day be- 
coming more and more awake to the importance 
of scientific investigation and to the astounding 
and unexpected manner in which it everywhere 
reacts upon practical pursuits. I should look 
upon the establishment of some institution of that 
kind as a recognition on the part of the medical 
profession in general, that if their great and be- 
neficent work is to be carried on, they must, like 
other people who have great and beneficent work 
to do, contribute to the advancement of knowl- 
edge in the only way in which experience shows 
that it can be advanced.

XIV 
THE CONNECTION OF THE BIOLOGICAL 
SCIENCES WITH MEDICINE 
[1881] 
Tur great body of theoretical and practical 
knowledge which has been accumulated by the 
labours of some eighty generations, since the dawn 
of scientific thought in Europe, has no collective 
English name to which an objection may not be 
raised; and I use the term “medicine” as that 
which is least likely to be misunderstood; though, 
as every one knows, the name is commonly ap- 
plied, in a narrower sense, to one of the chief di- 
visions of the totality of medical science. 
Taken in this broad sense, “medicine” not 
merely denotes a kind of knowledge, but it com- 
prehends the various applications of that knowl- 
edge to the alleviation of the sufferings, the repair 
of the injuries, and the conservation of the health, 
347
-P-A-G-E-356
848 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
of living beings. In fact, the practical aspect of 
medicine so far dominates over every other, that 
the “ Healing Art” is one of its most widely-re- 
ceived synonyms. It is so difficult to think of 
medicine otherwise than as something which is 
necessarily connected with curative treatment, that 
we are apt to forget that there must be, and is, such 
a thing as a pure science of medicine—a “ pathol- 
ogy” which has no more necessary subservience 
to practical ends than has zoology or botany. 
The logical connection between this purely 
scientific doctrine of disease, or pathology, and 
ordinary biology, is easily traced. Living matter 
is characterised by its innate tendency to exhibit a 
definite series of the morphological and physio- 
logical phenomena which constitute organisation 
and life. Given a certain range of conditions, and 
these phenomena remain the same, within narrow 
limits, for each kind of living thing. They fur- 
nish the normal and typical character of the spe- 
cies, and, as such, they are the subject-matter of 
ordinary biology. 
Outside the range of these conditions, the nor- 
mal course of the cycle of vital phenomena is dis- 
turbed; abnormal structure makes its appearance, 
or the proper character and mutual adjustment of 
the functions cease to be preserved. The extent 
and the importance of these deviations from the 
typical life may vary indefinitely. They may have 
no noticeable influence on the general well-being  
-P-A-G-E-357
xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 349 
of the economy, or they may favour it. On the 
other hand, they may be of such a nature as to 
impede the activities of the organism, or even to 
involve its destruction. 
In the first case, these perturbations are ranged 
under the wide and somewhat vague category of 
“variations”; in the second, they are called le- 
sions, states of poisoning, or diseases; and, as mor- 
bid states, they lie within the province of pathol- 
ogy. No sharp line of demarcation can be drawn 
between the two classes of phenomena. No one 
can say where anatomical variations end and tu- 
mours begin, nor where modification of function, 
which may at first promote health, passes into dis- 
ease. All that can be said is, that whatever change 
of structure or function is hurtful belongs to pa- 
thology. Hence it is obvious that pathology is a 
branch of biology; it is the morphology, the physi- 
ology, the distribution, the etiology of abnormal 
life. 
However obvious this conclusion may be now, 
it was nowise apparent in the infancy of medicine. 
For it is a peculiarity of the physical sciences that 
they are independent in proportion as they are 
imperfect; and it is only as they advance that the 
bonds which really unite them all become appar- 
ent. Astronomy had no manifest connection with 
terrestrial physics before the publication of the 
“Principia”; that of chemistry with physics is 
of still more modern revelation; that of physics
-P-A-G-E-358
850 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
and chemistry with physiology, has been stoutly 
denied within the recollection of most of us, and 
perhaps still may be. 
Or, to take a case which affords a closer paral- 
lel with that of medicine. Agriculture has been 
cultivated from the earliest times, and, from a re- 
mote antiquity, men have attained considerable 
practical skill in the cultivation of the useful 
plants, and have empirically established many sci- 
entific truths concerning the conditions under 
which they flourish. But, it is within the memory 
of many of us, that chemistry on the one hand, 
and vegetable physiology on the other, attained a 
stage of development such that they were able to 
furnish a sound basis for scientific agriculture. 
Similarly, medicine took its rise in the practical 
needs of mankind. At first, studied without ref- 
erence to any other branch of knowledge, it long 
maintained, indeed still to some extent maintains, 
that independence. Historically, its connection 
with the biological sciences has been slowly estab- 
lished, and the full extent and intimacy of that 
connection are only now beginning to be apparent. 
I trust I have not been mistaken in supposing that 
an attempt to give a brief sketch of the steps by 
which a philosophical necessity has become an 
historical reality, may not be devoid of interest, 
possibly of instruction, to the members of this 
great Congress, profoundly interested as all are in 
the scientific development of medicine.
-P-A-G-E-359
  xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 351 
The history of medicine is more complete and 
fuller than that of any other science, except, per- 
haps, astronomy; and, if we follow back the long 
record as far as clear evidence lights us, we find 
ourselves taken to the early stages of the civilisa- 
tion of Greece. The oldest hospitals were the 
temples of Aisculapius; to these Asclepeia, al- 
ways erected on healthy sites, hard by fresh springs 
and surrounded by shady groves, the sick and the 
maimed resorted to seek the aid of the god of 
health. Votive tablets or inscriptions recorded 
the symptoms, no less than the gratitude, of those 
who were healed; and, from these primitive clin- 
ical records, the half-priestly, half-philosophic 
caste of the Asclepiads compiled the data upon 
which the earliest generalisations of medicine, as 
an inductive science, were based. 
In this state, pathology, like all the inductive 
sciences at their origin, was merely natural 
history; it registered the phenomena of disease, 
classified them, and ventured upon a prognosis, 
wherever the observation of constant co-existences 
and sequences suggested a rational expectation 
of the like recurrence under similar circum- 
stances. 
Further than this it hardly went. In fact, in 
the then state of knowledge, and in the condition 
of philosophical speculation at that time, neither 
the causes of the morbid state, nor the rationale 
of treatment, were likely to be sought for as we 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
aii | |

352 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE = xiv 
seek for them now. The anger of a god was a 
sufficient reason for the existence of a malady, and 
a dream ample warranty for therapeutic measures; 
that a physical phenomenon must needs have a 
physical cause was not the implied or expressed 
axiom that it is to us moderns. 
| The great man whose name is inseparably 
connected with the foundation of medicine, Hip- 
pocrates, certainly knew very little, indeed prac- 
tically nothing, of anatomy or physiology; and he 
would probably have been perplexed even to im- 
agine the possibility of a connection between the 
zoological studies of his contemporary Democritus 
and medicine. Nevertheless, in so far as he, and 
those who worked before and after him, in the 
same spirit, ascertained, as matters of experi- 
ence, that a wound, or a luxation, or a fever, 
presented such and such symptoms, and that the 
return of the patient to health was facilitated 
by such and such measures, they established 
laws of nature, and began the construction of 
the science of pathology. All true science begins 
with empiricism—though all true science is such 
exactly, in so far as it strives to pass out of the 
empirical stage into that of the deduction of em- 
pirical from more general truths. Thus, it is not 
wonderful, that the early physicians had little 
or nothing to do with the development of bio- 
logical science; and, on the other hand, that the 
early biologists did not much concern themselves 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 353 
with medicine. There is nothing to show that 
the Asclepiads took any prominent share in the 
work of founding anatomy, physiology, zoology, 
and botany. Rather do these seem to have sprung 
from the early philosophers, who were essentially 
natural philosophers, animated by the character- 
istically Greek thirst for knowledge as such. 
Pythagoras, Alemeon, Democritus, Diogenes of 
Apollonia, are all credited with anatomical and 
physiological investigations; and, though Aristotle 
is said to have belonged to an Asclepiad family, 
and not improbably owed his taste for anatomical 
and zoological inquiries to the teachings of his 
father, the physician Nicomachus, the “ Historia 
Animalium,” and the treatise “De Partibus 
Animalium,” are as free from any allusion to 
medicine as if they had issued from a modern bio- 
logical laboratory. 
It may be added, that it is not easy to see in 
what way it could have benefited a physician of 
Alexander’s time to know all that Aristotle knew 
on these subjects. His human anatomy was too 
rough to avail much in diagnosis; his physiology 
was too erroneous to supply data for pathological 
reasoning. But when the Alexandrian school, 
with Erasistratus and Herophilus at their head, 
turned to account the opportunities of studying 
human structure, afforded to them by the 
Ptolemies, the value of the large amount of ac- 
curate knowledge thus obtained to the surgeon
-P-A-G-E-362
  854 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
for his operations, and to the physician for his 
diagnosis of internal disorders, became obvious, 
and a connection was established between anatomy 
and medicine, which has ever become closer and 
closer. Since the revival of learning, surgery, 
medical diagnosis, and anatomy have gone hand 
in hand. Morgagni called his great work, “De 
sedibus et causis morborum per anatomen inda- 
gatis,’ and not only showed the way to search out 
the localities and the causes of disease by anatomy, 
but himself travelled wonderfully far upon the 
road. Bichat, discriminating the grosser constitu- 
ents of the organs and parts of the body, one from 
another, pointed out the direction which modern 
research must take; until, at length, histology, a 
science of yesterday, as it seems to many of us, has 
carried the work of Morgagni as far as the micro- 
scope can take us, and has extended the realm of 
pathological anatomy to the limits of the invisible 
world. 
Thanks to the intimate alliance of morphology 
with medicine, the natural history of disease has, 
at the present day, attained a high degree of per- 
fection. Accurate regional anatomy has rendered 
practicable the exploration of the most hidden 
parts of the organism, and the determination, dur- 
ing life, of morbid changes in them; anatomical 
and histological post-mortem investigations have 
supplied physicians with a clear basis upon which 
to rest the classification of diseases, and with un-
-P-A-G-E-363
  xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 355 
erring tests of the accuracy or inaccuracy of their 
diagnoses. 
If men could be satisfied with pure knowledge, 
the extreme precision with which, in these days, 
a sufferer may be told what is happening, and 
what is likely to happen, even in the most recon- 
dite parts of his bodily frame, should be as satis- 
factory to the patient as it is to the scientific 
pathologist who gives him the information. But 
I am afraid it is not; and even the practising 
physician, while nowise under-estimating the regu- 
lative value of accurate diagnosis, must often la- 
ment that so much of his knowledge rather pre- 
vents him from doing wrong than helps him to 
do right. 
A scorner of physic once said that nature and 
disease may be compared to two men fighting, the 
doctor to a blind man with a club, who strikes 
into the mélée, sometimes hitting the disease, and 
sometimes hitting nature. The matter is not 
mended if you suppose the blind man’s hearing 
to be so acute that he can register every stage of 
the struggle, and pretty clearly predict how it 
will end. He had better not meddle at all, until 
his eyes are opened, until he can see the exact po- 
sition of the antagonists, and make sure of the 
effect of his blows. But that which it behooves 
the physician to see, not, indeed, with his bodily 
eye, but with clear, intellectual vision, is a process, 
and the chain of causation involved in that process.
-P-A-G-E-364
  356 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
Disease, as we have seen, is a perturbation of the 
normal activities of a living body, and it is, and 
must remain, unintelligible, so long as we are 
ignorant of the nature of these normal activities. 
In other words, there could be no real science of 
pathology until the science of physiology had 
reached a degree of perfection unattained, and in- 
deed unattainable, until quite recent times. 
So far as medicine is concerned, I am not sure 
that physiology, such as it was down to the time 
of Harvey, might as well not have existed. Nay, 
it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that, within 
the memory of living men, justly renowned 
practitioners of medicine and surgery knew less 
physiology than is now to be learned from the 
most elementary text-book; and, beyond a few 
broad facts, regarded what they did know as of 
extremely little practical importance. Nor am I 
disposed to blame them for this conclusion; 
physiology must be useless, or worse than useless, 
to pathology, so long as its fundamental concep- 
tions are erroneous. 
Harvey is often said to be the founder of 
modern physiology; and there can be no question 
that the elucidations of the function of the 
heart, of the nature of the pulse, and of the course 
of the blood, put forth in the ever-memorable 
little essay, “ De motu cordis,” directly worked a 
revolution in men’s views of the nature and of the 
concatenation of some of the most important
-P-A-G-E-365
xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 357 
physiological processes among the higher animals; 
while, indirectly, their influence was perhaps even. 
more remarkable. 
But, though Harvey made this signal and per- 
ennially important contribution to the physiology 
of the moderns, his general conception of vital pro- 
cesses was essentially identical with that of the 
ancients; and, in the “ Exercitationes de genera- 
tione,’” and notably in the singular chapter “ De 
calido innato,” he shows .himself a true son of 
Galen and of Aristotle. 
For Harvey, the blood possesses powers superior 
to those of the elements; it is the seat of a soul 
which is not only vegetative, but also sensitive 
and motor. The blood maintains and fashions all 
parts of the body, “ idque summa cum providenti& 
et intellectu in finem certum agens, quasi ratiocinio 
quodam uteretur.” 
Here is the doctrine of the “ pneuma,” the pro- 
duct of the philosophical mould into which the 
animism of primitive men ran in Greece, in full 
force. Nor did its strength abate for long after 
Harvey’s time. The same ingrained tendency of 
the human mind to suppose that a process is ex- 
plained when it is ascribed to a power of which 
nothing is known except that it is the hypothetical 
agent of the process, gave rise, in the next century, 
to the animism of Stahl; and, later, to the doctrine 
of a vital principle, that “asylum ignorantie ” of 
physiologists, which has so easily accounted for 
   
-P-A-G-E-366
858 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
everything and explained nothing, down to our 
own times. 
Now the essence of modern, as contrasted with 
ancient, physiological science appears to me to 
lie in its antagonism to animistic hypotheses and 
animistic phraseology. It offers physical explana- 
tions of vital phenomena, or frankly confesses that 
it has none to offer. And, so far as I know, the 
first person who gave expression to this modern 
view of physiology, who was bold enough to 
enunciate the proposition that vital phenomena, 
like all the other phenomena of the physical 
world, are, in ultimate analysis, resolvable into 
matter and motion, was René Descartes. 
The fifty-four years of life of this most original 
and powerful thinker are widely overlapped, on 
both sides, by the eighty of Harvey, who survived 
his younger contemporary by seven years, and takes 
pleasure in acknowledging the French philoso- 
pher’s appreciation of his great discovery. 
In fact, Descartes accepted the doctrine of the 
circulation as propounded by “ Harveeus médecin 
\v Angleterre,” and gave a full account of it in his 
first work, the famous “ Discours de la Méthode,” 
which was published in 1637, only nine years 
after the exercitation “De motu cordis”; and, 
though differing from Harvey on some important 
points (in which it may be noted, in passing, 
Descartes was wrong and Harvey right), he always 
speaks of him with great respect. And so. impor-
-P-A-G-E-367
xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 359 
tant does the subject seem to Descartes, that he 
returns to it in the “ Traité des Passions,” and in 
the “ Traité de PHomme.” 
It is easy to see that Harvey’s work must have 
had a peculiar significance for the subtle thinker, 
to whom we owe both the spiritualistic and the 
materialistic philosophies of modern times. It was 
in the very year of its publication, 1628, that 
Descartes withdrew into that life of solitary 
investigation and meditation of which his phi- 
osophy was the fruit. And, as the course of his 
speculations led him to establish an absolute dis- 
inction of nature between the material and the 
mental worlds, he was logically compelled to seek 
for the explanation of the phenomena of the 
material world within itself; and having allotted 
he realm of thought to the soul, to see nothing 
but extension and motion in the rest of nature. 
Descartes uses “ thought ” as the equivalent of our 
modern term “consciousness.” Thought is the 
‘unction of the soul, and its only function. Our 
natural heat and all the movements of the body, 
says he, do not depend on the soul. Death does 
not take place from any fault of the soul, but only 
ecause some of the principal parts of the body 
become corrupted. The body of a living man 
differs from that of a dead man in the same way 
as a watch or other automaton (that is to say, a 
machine which moves of itself) when it is wound 
up and has, in itself, the physical principle of the 
83

860 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE av 
movements which the mechanism is adapted to 
perform, differs from the same watch, or other 
machine, when it is broken, and the physical 
principle of its movement no longer exists. All 
the actions which are common to us and the lower 
animals depend only on the conformation of our 
‘organs, and the course which the animal spirits 
take in the brain, the nerves, and the muscles; 
in the same way as the movement of a watch is 
produced by nothing but the force of its spring 
and the figure of its wheels and other parts. 
Descartes’ “ Treatise on Man” is a sketch of 
human physiology, in which a bold attempt is 
made to explain all the phenomena of life, except 
those of consciousness, by physical reasonings. To 
a mind turned in this direction, Harvey’s exposi- 
tion of the heart and vessels as a hydraulic mechan- 
ism must have been supremely welcome. 
Descartes was not a mere philosophical theorist, 
but a hardworking dissector and experimenter, 
and he held the strongest opinion respecting the 
practical value of the new conception which he 
was introducing. He speaks of the importance of 
preserving health, and of the dependence of the 
mind on the body being so close that, perhaps, the 
only way of making men wiser and better than 
they are, is to be sought in medical science. “ It 
is true,” says he, “ that as medicine is now practised 
it contains little that is very useful; but without 
any desire to depreciate, I am sure that there is
-P-A-G-E-369
  xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 361 
no one, even among professional men, who will 
not declare that all we know is very little as com- 
pared with that which remains to be known; and 
that we might escape an infinity of diseases of the 
mind, no less than of the body, and even perhaps 
from the weakness of old age, if we had sufficient 
knowledge of their causes, and of all the remedies 
with which nature has provided us.” * So strongly 
impressed was Descartes with this, that he resolved 
to spend the rest of his life in trying to acquire 
such a knowledge of nature as would lead to the 
construction of a better medical doctrine.t The 
anti-Cartesians found material for cheap ridicule 
in these aspirations of the philosopher; and it is 
almost needless to say that, in the thirteen years 
which elapsed between the publication of the 
“ Discours ” and the death of Descartes, he did not 
contribute much to their realisation. But, for the 
next century, all progress in physiology took place 
along the lines which Descartes laid down. 
The greatest physiological and pathological 
work of the seventeenth century, Borelli’s treatise 
“De Motu Animalium,” is, to all intents and pur- 
poses, a development of Descartes’ fundamental 
conception; and the same may be said of the physi- 
ology and pathology of Boerhaave, whose authority 
dominated in the medical world of the first half 
of the eighteenth century.

With the origin of modern chemistry, and of 
electrical science, in the latter half of the eight- 
eenth century, aids in the analysis of the phenom- 
ena of life, of which Descartes could not have 
dreamed, were offered to the physiologist. And the 
greater part of the gigantic progress which has 
been made in the present century is a justification 
of the prevision of Descartes. For it consists, 
essentially, in a more and more complete resolution 
of the grosser organs of the living body into physi- 
co-chemical mechanisms. 
“T shall try to explain our whole bodily machin- 
ery in such a way, that it will be no more necessary 
for us to supppose that the soul produces such 
movements as are not voluntary, than it is to think 
that there is in a clock a soul which causes it to 
show the hours.”* These words of Descartes 
might be appropriately taken as a motto by the 
author of any modern treatise on physiology. 
But though, as I think, there is no doubt that 
Descartes was the first to propound the funda- 
mental conception of the living body as a physical 
mechanism, which is the distinctive feature of 
modern, as contrasted with ancient physiology, he 
was misled by the natural temptation to carry 
out, in all its details, a parallel between the 
machines with which he was familiar, such as 
clocks and pieces of hydraulic apparatus, and the 
living machine. In all such machines there is a 
* Dela Formation du Fetus.
-P-A-G-E-371
  xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 363 
central source of power, and the parts of the 
machine are merely passive distributors of that 
power. The Cartesian school conceived of the 
living body as a machine of this kind; and herein 
they might have learned from Galen, who, what- 
ever ill use he may have made of the doctrine of 
“natural faculties,’ nevertheless had the great 
merit of perceiving that local forces play a great 
part in physiology. 
The same truth was recognised by Glisson, but 
it was first prominently brought forward in the 
Hallerian doctrine of the “ vis insita” of muscles. 
If muscle can contract without nerve, there is an 
end of the Cartesian mechanical explanation of 
its contraction by the influx of animal spirits. 
The discoveries of Trembley tended in the 
same direction. In the freshwater Hydra, no 
trace was to be found of that complicated 
machinery upon which the performance of the 
functions in the higher animals were supposed to 
depend. And yet the hydra moved, fed, grew, 
multiplied, and its fragments exhibited all the 
powers of the whole. And, finally, the work of 
Caspar F. Wolff,* by demonstrating the fact that 
the growth and development of both plants and 
animals take place antecedently to the existence 
of their grosser organs, and are, in fact, the causes 
and not the consequences of organization (as 
then understood), sapped the foundations of the 
* Theoria Generationis, 1759.
-P-A-G-E-372
  364 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xv 
Cartesian physiology as a complete expression of 
vital phenomena. 
For Wolff, the physical basis of life is a fluid, 
possessed of a “ vis essentialis” and a “ solidesci- 
bilitas,” in virtue of which it gives rise to 
organisation; and, as he points out, this con- 
clusion strikes at the root of the whole iatro- 
mechanical system. 
In this country, the great authority of John 
Hunter exerted a similar influence; though it 
must be admitted that the too sibylline utterances 
which are the outcome of Hunter’s struggles to 
define his conceptions are often susceptible of 
more than one interpretation. Nevertheless, on 
some points Hunter is clear enough. For example, 
he is of opinion that “Spirit is only a property 
of matter” (“Introduction to Natural History,” 
p. 6), he is prepaxed to renounce animism, (I. c. p. 
8), and his conception of life is so completely 
physical that he thinks of it as something which 
can exist in a state of combination in the food. 
“The aliment we take in has in it, in a fixed 
state, the real life; and this does not become 
active until it has got into the lungs; for there it 
is freed from its prison” (“ Observations on Phy- 
siology,” p. 113). He also thinks that “It is 
more in accord with the general principles of the 
animal machine to suppose that none of its effects 
are produced from any mechanical principle 
whatever; and that every effect is produced from
-P-A-G-E-373
  xiv. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 365 
an. action in the part; which action is produced 
by a stimulus upon the part which acts, or upon 
some other part with which this part sympathises 
so as to take up the whole action ” (J. c. p. 152). 
And Hunter is as clear as Wolff, with whose 
work he was probably unacquainted, that “ what- 
ever life is, it most certainly does not depend upon 
structure or organisation ” (J. ¢. p. 114). 
Of course it is impossible that Hunter could 
have intended to deny the existence of purely 
mechanical operations in the animal body. But 
while, with Borelli and Boerhaave, he looked 
upon absorption, nutrition, and secretion as 
operations effected by means of the small vessels, 
he differed from the mechanical physiologists, 
who regarded these operations as the result of 
the mechanical properties of the small vessels, 
such as the size, form, and disposition of their 
canals and apertures. Hunter, on the contrary, 
considers them to be the effect of properties of 
these vessels which are not mechanical but vital. 
“The vessels,” says he, “have more of the polypus 
in them than any other part of the body,” and he 
talks of the “ living and sensitive principles of the 
arteries,” and even of the “ dispositions or feelings 
of the arteries.” “When the blood is good and 
genuine the sensations of the arteries, or the 
dispositions for sensation, are agreeable. . . . It 
is then they dispose of the blood to the best 
advantage, increasing the growth of the whole, ©
-P-A-G-E-374
  866 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
supplying any losses, keeping up a due succession, 
ete.” (1. c. p. 133). 
If we follow Hunter’s conceptions to their 
logical issue, the life of one of the higher animals 
is essentially the sum of the lives of all the 
vessels, each of which is a sort of physiological 
unit, answering to a polype; and, as health is the 
result of the normal “action of the vessels,” so is 
disease an effect of their abnormal action. Hunter 
thus stands in thought, as in time, midway between 
Borelli on the one hand, and Bichat on the other. 
The acute founder of general anatomy, in fact, 
outdoes Hunter in his desire to exclude physical 
reasonings from the realm of life. Except in the 
interpretation of the action of the sense organs, 
he will not allow physics to have anything to do 
with physiology. 
“To apply the physical sciences to physiology 
is to explain the phenomena of living bodies by 
the laws of inert bodies. Now this is a false 
principle, hence all its consequences are marked 
with the same stamp. Let us leave to chemistry 
its affinity; to physics, its elasticity and its gravity. 
Let us invoke for physiology only sensibility and 
contractility.” * 
Of all the unfortunate dicta of men of eminent 
ability this seems one of the most unhappy, when 
we think of what the application of the methods 
and the data of physics and chemistry has done 
* Anatomie générale, i. p. liv.
-P-A-G-E-375
xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 367 
towards bringing physiology into its present state. 
It is not too much to say that one-half of a modern 
text-book of physiology consists of applied physics 
and chemistry; and that it is exactly in the ex- 
ploration of the phenomena of sensibility and con- 
tractility that physics and chemistry have exerted 
the most potent influence. 
Nevertheless, Bichat rendered a solid service to 
physiological progress by insisting upon the fact 
that what we call life, in one of the higher animals, 
is not an indivisible unitary archeus dominating, 
from its central seat, the parts of the organism, 
but a compound result of the synthesis of the 
separate lives of those parts. 
“ All animals,” says he, “are assemblages of 
different organs, each of which performs its 
function and concurs, after its fashion, in the 
preservation of the whole. They are so many 
special machines in the general machine which 
constitutes the individual. But each of these 
special machines is itself compounded of many 
tissues of very different natures, which in truth 
constitute the elements of those organs” (1. ¢. 
lxxix.). “The conception of a proper vitality is 
applicable only to these simple tissues, and not to 
the organs themselves ” (1. c. Ixxxiv.). 
And Bichat proceeds to make the obvious 
application of this doctrine of synthetic life, if I 
may so call it, to pathology. Since diseases are 
only alterations of vital properties, and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  368 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xv 
| 
properties of each tissue are distinct from those of 
the rest, it is evident that the diseases of each 
tissue must be different from those of the rest. 
Therefore, in any organ composed of different 
tissues, one may be diseased and the other remain 
healthy; and this is what happens in most cases 
(J. ¢. Ixxxv.). 
In a spirit of true prophecy, Bichat says, “ We 
have arrived at an epoch in which pathological 
anatomy should start afresh.” For, as the analysis 
of the organs had led him to the tissues as the 
physiological units of the organism; so, in a 
succeeding generation, the analysis of the tissues 
led to the cell as the physiological element of the 
tissues. The contemporaneous study of develop- 
ment brought out the same result; and the 
zoologists and botanists, exploring the simplest 
and the lowest forms of animated beings, confirmed 
the great induction of the cell theory. Thus the 
apparently opposed views, which have been 
battling with one another ever since the middle 
of the last century, have proved to be each half 
the truth. 
The proposition of Descartes that the body of a 
living man is a machine, the actions of which are 
explicable by the known laws of matter and 
motion, is unquestionably largely true. But it is 
also true, that the living body is a synthesis of 
innumerable physiological elements, each of which 
may nearly be described, in Wolff’s words, as a
-P-A-G-E-377
  sty BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 369 
fluid possessed of a “vis essentialis” and a 
“solidescibilitas”; or, in modern phrase, as 
protoplasm susceptible of structural metamorphosis 
and functional metabolism: and that the only 
machinery, in the precise sense in which the 
Cartesian school understood mechanism, is, that 
which co-ordinates and regulates these physio- 
logical units into an organic whole. 
In fact, the body is a machine of the nature 
of an army, not of that of a watch or of a 
hydraulic apparatus. Of this army each cell is 
a soldier, an organ a brigade, the central nervous 
system headquarters and field telegraph, the ali- 
mentary and circulatory system the commissariat. 
Losses are made good by recruits born in camp, 
and the life of the individual is a campaign, 
conducted successfully for a number of years, but 
with certain defeat in the long run. 
The efficacy of an army, at any given moment, 
depends on the health of the individual soldier, 
and on the perfection of the machinery by which 
he is led and brought into action at the proper 
time; and, therefore, if the analogy holds good, 
there can be only two kinds of diseases, the one 
dependent on abnormal states of the physiologi- 
cal units, the other on perturbations of their co- 
ordinating and alimentative machinery. 
Hence, the establishment of the cell theory, in 
normal biology, was swiftly followed by a “ cellular 
pathology,” as its logical counterpart. I need not 
remind you how great an instrument of investiga-
-P-A-G-E-378
  870 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
tion this doctrine has proved in the hands of the 
man of genius to whom its development is due, 
and who would probably be the last to forget that 
abnormal conditions of the co-ordinative and dis- 
tributive machinery of the body are no less im- 
portant factors of disease. 
Henceforward, as it appears to me, the connec- 
tion of medicine with the biological sciences is 
clearly indicated. Pure pathology is that branch of 
biology which defines the particular perturbation 
of cell-life, or of the co-ordinating machinery, or of 
both, on which the phenomena of disease depend. 
Those who are conversant with the present 
state of biology will hardly hesitate to admit that 
the conception of the life of one of the higher 
animals as the summation of the lives of a cell 
aggregate, brought into harmonious action by a 
co-ordinative machinery formed by some of these 
cells, constitutes a permanent acquisition of 
physiological science. But the last form of the 
battle between the animistic and the physical 
* views of life is seen in the contention whether the 
physical analysis of vital phenomena can be carried 
beyond this point or not. 
There are some to whom living protoplasm is 
a substance, even such as Harvey conceived the 
blood to be, “ summa cum providentia et intellectu 
in finem certum agens, quasi ratiocinio quodam; ” 
and who look with as little favour as Bichat did, 
upon any attempt to apply the principles and 
the methods of physics and chemistry to the in-
-P-A-G-E-379
‘ 
xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 371 
vestigation of the vital processes of growth, me- 
tabolism, and contractility. They stand upon the 
ancient ways; only, in accordance with that prog- 
ress towards democracy, which a great political 
writer has declared to be the fatal characteristic 
of modern times, they substitute a republic formed 
by a few billion of “animule ” for the monarchy 
of the all-pervading “ anima.” 
Others, on the contrary, supported by a robust 
faith in the universal applicability of the principles 
laid down by Descartes, and seeing that the actions 
called “ vital” are, so far as we have any means of 
knowing, nothing but changes of place of particles 
of matter, look to molecular physics to achieve 
the analysis of the living protoplasm itself into a 
molecular mechanism. If there is any truth in 
the received doctrines of physics, that contrast 
between living and inert matter, on which Bichat 
lays so much stress, does not exist. In nature, 
nothing is at rest, nothing is amorphous; the 
simplest particle of that which men in their 
blindness are pleased to call “brute matter” is a 
vast aggregate of molecular mechanisms perform- 
ing complicated movements of immense rapidity, 
and sensitively adjusting themselves to every 
change in the surrounding world. Living matter 
differs from other matter in degree and not in kind; 
the microcosm repeats the macrocosm; and one 
chain of causation connects the nebulous original 
of suns and planetary systems with the protoplas- 
mic foundation of life and organisation.  
-P-A-G-E-380
  372 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE xiv 
From this point of view, pathology is the 
analogue of the theory of perturbations in astron- 
omy; and therapeutics resolves itself into the 
discovery of the means by which a system of forces 
competent to eliminate any given perturbation may 
be introduced into the economy. And, as pathology 
bases itself upon normal physiology,sotherapeutics 
rests upon pharmacology; which is, strictly speak- 
ing, a part of the great biological topic of the influ- 
ence of conditions on the living organism, and has 
no scientific foundation apart from physiology. 
It appears to me that there is no more hopeful 
indication of the progress of medicine towards the 
ideal of Descartes than is to be derived from a com- 
parison of the state of pharmacology, at the present 
day, with that which existed forty years ago. If 
we consider the knowledge positively acquired, in 
this short time, of the modus operandi of urari, of 
atropia, of physostigmin, of veratria, of casca, of 
strychnia, of bromide of potassium, of phosphorus, 
there can surely be no ground for doubting that, 
sooner or later, the pharmacologist will supply the 
physician with the means of affecting, in any de- 
sired sense, the functions of any physiological ele- 
ment of the body. It will, in short, become pos- 
sible to introduce into the economy a molecular 
mechanism which, like a very cunningly-contrived 
torpedo, shall find its way to some particular group 
of living elements, and cause an explosion among 
them, leaving the rest untouched. 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
  xiv BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE 373 
The search for the explanation of diseased 
states in modified cell-life; the discovery of the im- 
portant part played by parasitic organisms in the 
etiology of disease; the elucidation of the action of 
medicaments by the methods and the data of ex- 
perimental physiology; appear to me to be the 
greatest steps which have ever been made towards 
the establishment of medicine on a scientific basis. 
I need hardly say they could not have been made 
except for the advance of normal biology. 
There can be no question, then, as to the na- 
ture or the value of the connection between medi- 
cine and the biological sciences. There can be no 
doubt that the future of pathology and of thera- 
peutics, and, therefore, that of practical medicine, 
depends upon the extent to which those who oc- 
cupy themselves with these subjects are trained in 
the methods and impregnated with the funda- 
mental truths of biology. 
And, in conclusion, I venture to suggest that 
the collective sagacity of this congress could occupy 
itself with no more important question than with 
this: How is medical education to be arranged, so 
that, without entangling the student in those 
details of the systematist which are valueless to 
him, he may be enabled to obtain a firm grasp of 
the great truths respecting animal and vegetable 
life, without which, notwithstanding all the prog- 
ress of scientific medicine, he will still find himself 
an empiric?

THE SCHOOL BOARDS: WHAT THEY CAN

AN electioneering manifesto would be out of

that may arise in the mind of the reader that the 
following pages partake of that nature, will be dis- 
pelled, if he reflect that they cannot be published * 
until after the day on which the ratepayers of the 
metropolis will have decided which candidates for 
seats upon the Metropolitan School Board they 
will take, and which they will leave. 
As one of those candidates, I may be permitted 
to say, that I feel much in the frame of mind of

that he could not carry him to the top of the 
ladder in his hod. The challenged hodman won 
his wager, but as the stakes were handed over, the 
challenger wistfully remarked, “Id great hopes 
of falling at the third round from the top.” And, 
in view of the work and the worry which awaits 
the members of the School Boards, I must confess 
to an occasional ungrateful hope that the friends 
who are toiling upwards with me in their hod, 
may, when they reach “the third round from the 
top,” let me fall back into peace and quietness. 
But whether fortune befriend me in this rough 
method, or not, I should like to submit to those 
of whom I am potential, but of whom I may not 
be an actual, colleague, and to others who may 
be interested in this most important problem— 
how to get the Education Act to work efficiently 
—some considerations as to what are the duties of 
the members of the School Boards, and what are 
the limits of their power. 
I suppose no one will be disposed to dispute the 
proposition, that the prime duty of every member 
of such a Board is to endeavour to administer the 
Act honestly; or in accordance, not only with its 
letter, but with its spirit. And if so, it would 
seem that the first step towards this very desirable 
end is, to obtain a clear notion of what that letter 
signifies, and what that spirit implies; or, in other 
words, what the clauses of the Act are intended 
to enjoin and to forbid. So that it is really not 
84 :
-P-A-G-E-384
  376 THE SCHOOL BOARDS SY, 
admissible, except for factious and abusive pur- 
poses, to assume that any one who endeavours to 
get at this clear meaning is desirous only of raising 
quibbles and making difficulties. 
Reading the Act with this desire to understand 
it, I find that its provisions may be classified, as 
might naturally be expected, under two heads: 
the one set relating to the subject-matter of educa- 
tion; the other to the establishment, mainten- 
ance, and administration of the schools in which 
that education is to be conducted. 
Now it is a most important circumstance, that 
all the sections of the Act, except four, belong to 
the latter division; that is, they refer to mere 
matters of administration. The four sections in 
question are the seventh, the fourteenth, the 
sixteenth, and the ninety-seventh. Of these, the 
seventh, the fourteenth, and the ninety-seventh 
deal with the subject-matter of education, while 
the sixteenth defines the nature of the relations 
which are to exist between the “ Education De- 
partment ” (an euphemism for the future Minister 
of Education) and the School Boards. It is the 
sixteenth clause which is the most important, and, 
in some respects, the most remarkable of all. It 
runs thus:— 
“Tf the School Board do, or permit, any act in contra- 
vention of, or fail to comply with, the regulations, accord- 
ing to which a school provided by them is required by this 
Act to be conducted, the Education Department may de-
-P-A-G-E-385
xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 3877 
clare the School Board to be, and such Board shall accord- 
ingly be deemed to be, a Board in default, and the Educa- 
tion Department may proceed accordingly; and every act, 
or omission, of any member of the School Board, or man- 
ager appointed by them, or any person under the control of 
the Board, shall be deemed to be permitted by the Board, 
unless the contrary be proved. 
“Tf any dispute arises as to whether the School Board 
have done, or permitted, any act in contravention of, or 
have failed to comply with, the said regulations, the matter 
shall be referred to the Education Department, whose deci- 
sion thereon shall be final.” 
It will be observed that this clause gives the 
Minister of Education absolute power over the do- 
ings of the School Boards. He is not only the 
administrator of the Act, but he is its interpreter. 
Thad imagined that on the occurrence of a dispute, 
not as regards a question of pure administration, 
but as to the meaning of a clause of the Act, a 
case might be taken and referred to a court of 
justice. But I am led to believe that the 
Legislature has, in the present instance, deliber- 
ately taken the power out of the hands of the 
judges and lodged it in those of the Minister of 
Education, who, in accordance with our method 
of making Ministers, will necessarily be a political 
partisan, and who may be a strong theological 
sectary into the bargain. And I am informed by 
members of Parliament who watched the progress 
of the Act, that the responsibility for this unusual 
state of things rests, not with the Government, 
but with the Legislature, which exhibited a
-P-A-G-E-386
  378 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
singular disposition to acev \ulate power in the 
hands of the future Minister of Education, and to 
evade the more troublesome difficulties of the edu- 
cation question by leaving them to be settled be- 
tween that Minister and the School Boards. 
I express no opinion whether it is, or is not, 
desirable that such powers of controlling all the 
School Boards in the country should be possessed 
by a person who may be, like Mr. Forster, eminent- 
ly likely to use these powers justly and wisely, but 
who also may be quite the reverse. I merely wish 
to draw attention to the fact that such powers are 
given to the Minister, whether he be fit or unfit. 
The extent of these powers becomes apparent when 
the other sections of the Act referred to are con- 
sidered. The fourth clause of the seventh section 
says:— 
“The school shall be conducted in accordance with the 
conditions required to be fulfilled by an elementary school 
in order to obtain an annual Parliamentary grant.” 
What these conditions are appears from the fol- 
lowing clauses of the ninety-seventh section:— 
“The conditions required to be fulfilled by an elemen- 
tary school in order to obtain an annual Parliamentary 
grant shall be those contained in the minutes of the Educa- 
tion Department in force for the time being. . . . Provided 
that no such minute of the Education Department, not in 
force at the time of the passing of this Act, shall be deemed 
to be in force until it has lain for not less than one month 
on the table of both Houses of Parliament.”
-P-A-G-E-387
  xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 879 
Let us consider how this will work in practice. 
A school established by a School Board may receive 
support from three sources—from the rates, the 
school fees, and the Parliamentary grant. The 
latter may be as great as the two former taken. to- 
gether; and as it may be assumed, without much 
risk of error, that a constant pressure will be ex- 
erted by the ratepayers on the members who repre- 
sent them to get as much out of the Government, 
and as little out of the rates, as possible, the School 
Boards will have a very strong motive for shaping 
the education they give, as nearly as may be, on 
the model which the Education Minister offers for 
their imitation, and for the copying of which he is 
prepared to pay. 
The Revised Code did not compel any school- 
master to leave off teaching anything; but, by the 
very simple process of refusing to pay for many 
kinds of teaching, it has practically put an end to 
them. Mr. Forster is said to be engaged in 
revising the Revised Code; a successor of his may 
re-revise it—and there will be no sort of check 
upon these revisions and counter revisions, except 
the possibility of a Parliamentary debate, when 
the revised, or added, minutes are laid upon the 
table. What chance is there that any such debate 
will take place on a matter of detail relating to 
elementary education—a subject with which mem- 
bers of the Legislature, having been, for the most 
part, sent to our public schools thirty years ago,
-P-A-G-E-388
380 THE SCHOOL BOARDS XV 
have not the least practical acquaintance, and for 
which they care nothing, unless it derives a 
political value from its connection with sectarian 
politics? 
I cannot but think, then, that the School 
Boards will have the appearance, but not the 
reality, of freedom of action, in regard to the 
subject-matter of what is commonly called 
“secular ” education. 
As respects what is commonly called “ reli- 
gious” education, the power of the Minister of 
Education is even more despotic. An interest, 
almost amounting to pathos, attaches itself, in my 
mind, to the frantic exertions which are at present 
going on in almost every school division, to elect 
certain candidates whose names have never before 
been heard of in connection with education, and 
who are either sectarian partisans, or nothing. In 
my own particular division, a body organised ad 
hoc is moving heaven and earth to get the seven 
seats filled by seven gentlemen, four of whom are 
good Churchmen, and three no less good Dissent- 
ers. But why should this seven times heated fiery 
furnace of theological zeal be so desirous to shed 
its genial warmth over the London School Board? 
Can it be that these zealous sectaries mean to 
evade the solemn pledge given in the Act? 
“No religious catechism or religious formulary which is 
distinctive of any particular denomination shall be taught 
in the school.”
-P-A-G-E-389
  xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 3881 
I confess I should have thought it my duty to 
reject any such suggestion, as dishonouring to 
a number of worthy persons, if it had not been for 
a leading article and some correspondence which 
appeared in the Guardian of November 9th, 
1870. 
The Guardian is, as everybody knows, one of 
the best of the “religious” newspapers; and, 
personally, I have every reason to speak highly of 
the fairness, and indeed kindness, with which the 
editor is good enough to deal with a writer who 
must, in many ways, be so objectionable to him as 
myself. I quote the following passages from a 
leading article on a letter of mine, therefore, with 
all respect, and with a genuine conviction that the 
course of conduct advocated by the writer must 
appear to him in a very different light from that 
under which I see it:— 
“The first of these points is the interpretation which 
Professor Huxley puts on the ‘Cowper-Temple clause.’ It 
is, in fact, that which we foretold some time ago as likely 
to be forced upon it by those who think with him. The 
clause itself was one of those compromises which it is very 
difficult to define or to maintain logically. On the one side 
was the simple freedom to School Boards to establish what 
schools they pleased, which Mr. Forster originally gave, but 
against which the Nonconformists lifted up their voices, 
because they conceived it likely to give too much power to 
the Church. On the other side there was the proposition to 
make the schools secular—intelligible enough, but in the 
consideration of public opinion simply impossible—and 
there was the vague impracticable idea, which Mr. Glad-
-P-A-G-E-390
382 THE SCHOOL BOARDS sv 
stone thoroughly tore to pieces, of enacting that the teach- 
ing of all school-masters in the new schools should be strict- 
ly ‘undenominational.’ The Cowper-T'emple clause was, 
we repeat, proposed simply to tide over the difficulty. It 
was to satisfy the Nonconformists and the ‘ unsectarian,’ as 
distinct from the secular party of the League, by forbidding 
all distinctive ‘catechisms and formularies,’ which might 
have the effect of openly assigning the schools to this or 
that religious body. It refused, at the same time, to at- 
tempt the impossible task of defining what was undenomi- 
national; and its author even contended, if we understood 
him correctly, that it would in no way, even indirectly, in- 
terfere with the substantial teaching of any master in any 
school. This assertion we always believed to be untenable; 
we could not see how, in the face of this clause, a distinctly 
denominational tone could be honestly given to schools 
nominally general. But beyond this mere suggestion of an 
attempt at a general tone of comprehensiveness in religious 
teaching it was not intended to go, and only because such 
was its limitation was it accepted by the Government and 
by the House. 
“But now we are told that it is to be construed as doing 
precisely that which it refused to do, A ‘formulary,’ it 
seems, is a collection of formulas, and formulas are simply 
propositions of whatever kind touching religious faith. All 
such propositions, if they cannot be accepted by all Christian 
denominations, are to be proscribed; and it is added signifi- 
cantly that the Jews also are a denomination, and so that 
any teaching distinctively Christian is perhaps to be ex- 
eluded, lest it should interfere with their freedom and 
rights. Are we then to fall back on the simple reading of 
the letter of the Bible? No! this, it is granted, would be 
an ‘unworthy pretence.’ The teacher is to give ‘ grammati- 
eal, geographical, or historical explanations;’ but he is to 
keep clear of ‘theology proper,’ because, as Professor Hux- 
ley takes great pains to prove, there is no theological teach- 
ing which is not opposed by some sect or other, from Ro-  
-P-A-G-E-391
  xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 383 
man Catholicism on the one hand to Unitarianism on the 
other. It was not, perhaps, hard to see that this difficulty 
would be started; and to those who, like Professor Huxley, 
look at it theoretically, without much practical experience 
of schools, it may appear serious or unanswerable, But 
there is very little in it practically ; when it is faced deter- 
minately and handled firmly, it will soon shrink into its 
true dimensions. The class who are least frightened at it 
are the school teachers, simply because they know most 
about it. It is quite clear that the school managers must 
be cautioned aguinst allowing their schools to be made 
places of proselytism; but when this is done, the case is 
simple enough. Leave the masters under this general un- 
derstanding to teach freely; if there is ground of com- 
plaint, let it be made, but leave the onus probandi on the 
objectors. For extreme peculiarities of belief or unbelief 
there is the Conscience Clause; as to the mass of parents, 
they will be more anxious to have religion taught than 
afraid of its assuming this or that particular shade. They 
will trust the school managers and teachers till they have 
reason to distrust them, and experience has shown that they 
may trust them safely enough. Any attempt to throw the 
burden of making the teaching undenominational upon the 
managers must be sternly resisted: it is simply evading the 
intentions of the Act in an elaborate attempt to carry them 
out. We thank Professor Huxley for the warning. To be 
forwarned is to be forearmed.” 
A good deal of light seems to me to be thrown 
on the practical significance of the opinions ex- 
pressed in the foregoing extract by the following 
interesting letter, which appeared in the same 
paper:— 
“Srr,—I venture to send to you the substance of a corre- 
spondence with the Education Department upon the ques- 
tion of the lawfulness of religious teaching in rate schools
-P-A-G-E-392
384 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
under section 14 (2) of the Act. I asked whether the words 
‘which is distinctive,’ etc., taken grammatically as limiting 
the prohibition of any religious formulary, might be con- 
strued as allowing (subject, however, to the other provisions 
of the Act) any religious formulary common to any two 
denominations anywhere in England to be taught in such 
schools; and if practically the limit could not be so ex- 
tended, but would have to be fixed according to the special 
circumstances of each district, then what degree of general 
acceptance in a district would exempt such a formulary 
from the prohibition? The answer to this was as follows: 
—‘It was understood, when clause 14 of the Education Act 
was discussed in the House of Commons, that, according to 
a well-known rule of interpreting Acts of Parliament, “de- 
nomination” must be held to include “denominations.” 
When any dispute is referred to the Education Department. 
under the last paragraph of section 16, it will be dealt with 
according to the circumstances of the case.’ 
“Upon my asking further if I might hence infer that 
the lawfulness of teaching any religious formulary in a rate 
school would thus depend eaclusively on local circumstances, 
and would accordingly be so decided by the Education De- 
partment in case of dispute, I was informed in explanation 
that ‘their lordships’’ letter was intended to convey to me 
that no general rule, beyond that stated in the first para- 
graph of their letter, could at present be laid down by 
them ; and that their decision in each particular case must 
depend on the special circumstances accompanying it. 
“T think it would appear from this that it may yet be in 
many eases both lawful and expedient to teach religious 
formularies in rate schools. Hee 
“Srrynine, Vovember 5, 1870.” 
Of course I do not mean to suggest that the 
editor of the Guardian is bound by the opinions 
of his correspondent; but I cannot help thinking 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 385 
that I do not misrepresent him, when I say that he 
also thinks “ that it may yet be, in many cases, both 
lawful and expedient to teach religious formularies 
in rate schools under these circumstances.” 
It is not uncharitable, therefore, to assume that, 
the express words of the Act of Parliament not- 
withstanding, all the sectaries who are toiling so 
hard for seats in the London School Board have 
the lively hope of the gentleman from Steyning, 
that it may be “ both lawful and expedient to teach 
religious formularies in rate schools;” and that 
they mean to do their utmost to bring this happy 
consummation about.* 
Now the pathetic emotion to which I have 
referred,as accompanying my contemplations of the 
violent struggles of so many excellent persons, is 
caused by the circumstance that, so far as I can 
judge, their labour is in vain. 
Supposing that the London School Board con- 
* A passage in an article on the “ Working of the Edu- 
cation Act,” in the Saturday Review for Nov. 19, 1870, 
completely justifies this anticipation of the line of action 
which the sectaries mean to take. After commending the 
Liverpool compromise, the writer goes on to say :— 
“Tf this plan is fairly adopted in Liverpool, the four- 
teenth clause of the Act will in effect be restored to its origi- 
nal form, and the majority of the ratepayers in each dis- 
trict be permitted to decide to what denomination the 
school shall belong.” 
In a previous paragraph the writer speaks of a possible 
“mistrust ” of one another by the members of the Board, 
and seems to anticipate “accusations of dishonesty.” If 
any of the members of the Board adopt his views, I think 
it highly probable that he may turn out to be a true 
prophet.
-P-A-G-E-394
  
386 THE SCHOOL BOARDS XV 
tains, as it probably will do, a majority of sectaries; 
and that they carry over the heads of a minority, 
a resolution that certain theological formulas, 
about which they all happen to agree,—say, for ex- 
ample, the doctrine of the 'Trinity,—shall be 
taught in the schools. Do they fondly imagine 
that the minority will not at once dispute their in- 
terpretation of the Act, and appeal to the Educa- 
tion Department to settle that dispute? And if so, 
do they supposethat any Minister of Education, who 
wants to keep his place, will tighten boundaries 
which the Legislature has left loose; and will give 
a “ final decision ” which shall be offensive to every 
Unitarian and to every Jew in the House of Com- 
mons, besides creating a precedent which will after- 
wards be used to the inujry of every Nonconform- 
ist? The editor of the Guardian tells his friends 
sternly to resist every attempt to throw the burden. 
of making the teaching undenominational on the 
managers, and thanks me for the warning I have 
given him. I return the thanks, with interest, for 
his warning, as to the course the party he repre- 
sents intends to pursue, and for enabling me thus 
to draw public attention to a perfectly constitu- 
tional and effectual mode of checkmating them. 
And, in truth, it is wonderful to note the sur- 
prising entanglement into which our able editor 
gets himself in the struggle between his native 
honesty and judgment and the necessities of his 
party. “ We could not see,” says he, “in the face
-P-A-G-E-395
  XY THE SCHOOL BOARDS 387 
of this clause how a distinct denominational tone 
could be honestly given to schools nominally gen- 
eral.” There speaks the honest and clear-headed 
man. “Any attempt to throw the burden of 
making the teaching undenominational must be 
sternly resisted.” There speaks the advocate 
holding a brief for his party. “Verily,” as Trin- 
culo says, “the monster hath two mouths:” the 
one, the forward mouth, tells us very justly that 
he teaching cannot “ honestly ” be “ distinctly de- 
nominational;” but the other, the backward 
mouth, asserts that it must by no manner of means 
e “undenominational.” Putting the two utter- 
ances together, I can only interpret them to mean 
hat the teaching is to be “ indistinctly denomina- 
ional.” If the editor of the Guardian had not 
shown signs of anger at my use of the term “ theo- 
ogical fog,” I should have been tempted to suppose 
it must have been what he had in his mind, under 
the name of “ indistinct denominationalism.” But 
his reading being plainly inadmissible, I can only 
imagine that he inculeates the teaching of formu- 
las common to a number of denominations. 
But the Education Department has already told 
he gentleman from Steyning that any such pro- 
ceeding will be illegal. “ According to a well- 
known rule of interpreting Acts of Parliament, 
* denomination ’ would be held to include ‘ denomi- 
nations.” In other words, we must read the Act 
thus:—  
-P-A-G-E-396
  388 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
“No religious catechism or religious formulary 
which is distinctive of any particular denomina- 
tions shall be taught.” 
Thus we are really very much indebted to the 
editor of the Guardian and his correspondent. 
The one has shown us that the sectaries mean to 
try to get as much denominational teaching as they 
can agree upon among themselves, forced into the 
elementary schools; while the other has obtained 
a formal declaration from the Educational Depart- 
ment that any such attempt will contravene the 
Act of Parliament, and that, therefore, the unsec- 
tarian, law-abiding members of the School Boards 
may safely reckon upon bringing down upon their 
opponents the heavy hand of the Minister of Edu- 
cation.* 
So much for the powers of the School Boards. 
Limited as they seem to be, it by no means follows 
that such Boards, if they are composed of intelli- 
gent and practical men, really more in earnest 
about education than about sectarian squabbles, 
may not exert a very great amount of influence. 
And, from many circumstances, this is especially 
* Since this paragraph was written, Mr. Forster, in 
speaking at the Birkbeck Institution, has removed all doubts 
as to what his “ final decision ” will be in the case of such dis- 
putes being referred to him :—*T have the fullest confidence 
that in the reading and explaining of the Bible, what the 
children will be taught will be the great truths of Christian 
life and conduct, which all of us desire they should know, 
and that no effort will be made to cram into their poor little 
minds, theological dogmas which their tender age prevents 
them from understanding.”
-P-A-G-E-397
  
xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 389 
likely to be the case with the London School Board, 
which, if it conducts itself wisely, may become a 
true educational parliament, as subordinate in au- 
thority to the Minister of Education, theoretically, 
as the Legislature is to the Crown, and yet, like the 
Legislature, possessed of great practical authority. 
And I suppose that no Minister of Education 
would be other than glad to have the aid of the de- 
liberations of such a body, or fail to pay careful 
attention to its recommendations. 
What, then, ought to be the nature and scope 
of the education which a School Board should en- 
deavour to give to every child under its influence, 
and for which it should try to obtain the aid of 
the Parliamentary grants? In my judgment it 
should include at least the following kinds of in- 
struction and of discipline:— 
1. Physical training and drill, as part of the 
regular business of the school. 
It is impossible to insist too much on the im- 
portance of this part of education for the children 
of the poor of great towns. All the conditions of 
their lives are unfavourable to their physical well- 
being. They are badly lodged, badly housed, badly 
fed, and live from one year’s end to another in bad 
air, without chance of a change. They have no 
play-grounds; they amuse themselves with marbles 
and chuck-farthing, instead of cricket or hare- 
and-hounds; and if it were not for the wonderful 
instinct which leads all poor children of tender
-P-A-G-E-398
  390 THE SCHOOL BOARDS XV 
years to run under the feet of cab-horses whenever 
they can, I know not how they would learn to use 
their limbs with agility. 
Now there is no real difficulty about teaching 
drill and the simpler kinds of gymnastics. It is 
done admirably well, for example, in the North 
Surrey Union schools; and a year or two ago 
when I had an opportunity of inspecting these 
schools, I was greatly struck with the effect of 
such training upon the poor little waifs and strays 
of humanity, mostly picked out of the gutter, who 
are being made into cleanly, healthy, and useful 
members of society in that excellent institution. 
Whatever doubts people may entertain about 
the efficacy of natural selection, there can be none 
about artificial selection; and the breeder who 
should attempt to make, or keep up, a fine stock 
of pigs, or sheep, under the conditions to which 
the children of the poor are exposed, would be the 
laughing-stock even of the bucolic mind. Parlia- 
ment has already done something in this direction 
by declining to be an accomplice in the asphyxia- 
tion of school children. It refuses to make any 
grant to a school in which the cubical contents of 
the school-room are inadequate to allow of proper 
respiration. I should like to see it make another 
step in the same direction, and either refuse to 
give a grant to a school in which physical training 
is not a part of the programme, or, at any rate, 
offer to pay upon such training. If something of 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 391 
the kind is not done, the English physique, which 
has been, and is still, on the whole, a grand one, 
will become as extinct as the dodo in the great 
towns. 
And then the moral and intellectual effect of 
drill, as an introduction to, and aid of, all other 
sorts of training, must not be overlooked. If you 
want to break in a colt,surely the first thing todo is 
to catch him and get him quietly to face his train- 
er; to know his voice and bear his hand; to learn 
that colts have something else to do with their 
heels than to kick them up whenever they feel so 
inclined; and to discover that the dreadful human 
figure has no desire to devour, or even to beat 
him, but that, in case of attention and obedience, 
he may hope for patting and even a sieve of oats. 
But, your “street Arabs,” and other neglected 
poor children, are rather worse and wilder than 
colts; for the reason that the horse-colt has only 
his animal instincts in him, and his mother, the 
mare, has been always tender over him, and never 
came home drunk and kicked him in her life; while 
the man-colt is inspired by that very real devil, per- 
verted manhood, and his mother may have done 
all that and more. So, on the whole, it may 
probably be even more expedient to begin your 
attempt to get at the higher nature of the child, 
than at that of the colt, from the physical side. 
2. Next in order to physical training I put the 
instruction of children, and especially of girls, in 
85
-P-A-G-E-400
  392 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
the elements of household work and of domestic 
economy; in the first place for their own sakes, 
and in the second for that of their future 
employers. 
Every one who knows anything of the life of 
the English poor is aware of the misery and waste 
caused by their want of knowledge of domestic 
economy, and by their lack of habits of frugality 
and method. I suppose it is no exaggeration to 
say that a poor Frenchwoman would make the 
money which the wife of a poor Englishman 
spends in food go twice as far, and at the same 
time turn out twice as palatable a dinner. Why 
Englishmen, who are so notoriously fond of good 
living, should be so helplessly incompetent in the 
art of cookery, is one of the great mysteries of 
nature; but from the varied abominations of the 
railway refreshment-rooms to the monotonous 
dinners of the poor, English feeding is either 
wasteful or nasty, or both. 
And as to domestic service, the groans of the 
housewives of England ascend to heaven! In five 
cases out of six the girl who takes a “ place” has 
to be trained by her mistress in the first rudiments 
of decency and order; and it is a mercy if she does 
not turn up her nose at anything like the mention 
of an honest and proper economy. Thousands of 
young girls are said to starve, or worse, yearly in 
London; and at the same time thousands of 
mistresses of households are ready to pay high  
-P-A-G-E-401
  
xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 393 
wages for a decent housemaid, or cook, or a fair 
workwoman; and can by no means get what they 
want. 
Surely, if the elementary schools are worth any- 
thing, they may put an end to a state of things 
which is demoralising the poor, while it is wasting 
the lives of those better off in small worries and 
annoyances. 
3. But the boys and girls for whose education 
the School Boards have to provide, have not 
merely to discharge domestic duties, but each of 
them is a member of a social and political organisa- 
tion of great complexity, and has, in future life, 
to fit himself into that organisation, or be crushed 
by it. To this end it is surely needful, not only 
that they should be made acquainted with the 
elementary laws of conduct, but that their affec- 
tions should be trained, so as to love with all their 
hearts that conduct which tends to the attainment 
of the highest good for themselves and their 
fellow men, and to hate with all their hearts that 
opposite course of action which is fraught with 
evil. 
So far as the laws of conduct are determined by 
the intellect, I apprehend that they belong to 
science, and to that part of science which is called 
morality. But the engagement of the affections 
in favour of that particular kind of conduct which 
we call good, seems to me to be something quite 
beyond mere science. And T cannot but think    
-P-A-G-E-402
394 THE SCHOOL BOARDS | xv 
that it, together with the awe and reverence, 
which have no kinship with base fear, but arise 
whenever one tries to pierce below the surface of 
things, whether they be material or spiritual, con- 
stitutes all that has any unchangeable reality in 
religion. 
And just as I think it would be a mistake to 
confound the science, morality, with the affection, 
religion; so do I conceive it to be a most lament- 
able and mischievous error, that the science, 
theology, is so confounded in the minds of many— 
indeed, I might say, of the majority of men. 
I do not express any opinion as to whether 
theology is a true science, or whether it does not 
come under the apostolic definition of “science 
falsely so called;” though I may be permitted to 
express the belief that if the Apostle to whom 
that much misapplied phrase is due could make 
the acquaintance of much of modern theology, he 
would not hesitate a moment in declaring that it 
is exactly what he meant the words to denote. 
But it is at any rate conceivable, that the 
nature of the Deity, and his relations to the 
universe, and more especially to mankind, are 
capable of being ascertained, either inductively or 
deductively, or by both processes. And, if they 
have been ascertained, then a body of science 
has been formed which is very properly called 
theology. 
Further, there can be no doubt that affection 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 395 
for the Being thus defined and described by 
heologic science would be properly termed re- 
igion; but it would not be the whole of religion. 
The affection for the ethical ideal defined by moral 
science would claim equal if not superior rights. 
or suppose theology established the existence of 
an evil deity—and some theologies, even Christian 
ones, have come very near this,—is the religious 
affection to be transferred from the ethical ideal 
to any such omnipotent demon? I trow not. Bet- 
er a thousand times that the human race should 
erish under his thunderbolts than it should say, 
‘Evil, be thou my good.” 
There is nothing new, that I know of, in this 
statement of the relations of religion with the 
science of morality on the one hand and that of 
heology on the other. But I believe it to be 
altogether true, and very needful, at this time, to 
e clearly and emphatically recognised as such, 
by those who have to deal with the education 
question. 
We are divided into two parties—the advocates 
of so-called “ religious ” teaching on the one hand, 
and those of so-called “secular” teaching on the 
other. And both parties seem to me to be not 
only hopelessly wrong, but in such a position that 
if either succeeded completely, it would discover, 
before many years were over, that it had made a 
great mistake and done serious evil to the cause of 
education. « 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-404
  396 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
For, leaving aside the more far-seeing minority 
on each side, what the “ religious” party is erying 
for is mere theology, under the name of religion; 
while the “ secularists” have unwisely and wrong- 
fully admitted the assumption of their opponents, 
and demand the abolition of all “religious” teach- 
ing, when they only want to be free of theology— 
Burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches! 
But my belief is, that no human being, and no 
society composed of human beings, ever did, or 
ever will, come to much, unless their conduct was 
governed and guided by the love of some ethical 
ideal. Undoubtedly, your gutter child may be 
converted by mere intellectual drill into “the 
subtlest of all the beasts of the field;” but we 
know what has become of the original of that 
description, and there is no need to increase the 
number of those who imitate him successfully with- 
out being aided by the rates. And if I were com- 
pelled to choose for one of my-own children, be- 
tween a school in which real religious instruction 
is given, and one without it, I should prefer the 
former, even though the child might have to take 
a good deal of theology with it. Nine-tenths of a 
dose of bark is mere half-rotten wood; but one 
swallows it for the sake of the particles of quinine, 
the beneficial effect of which may be weakened, 
but is not destroyed, by the wooden dilution, 
unless in a few cases of exceptionally tender 
stomachs.

Hence, when the great mass of the English 
people declare that they want to have the children 
in the elementary schools taught the Bible, and 
when it is plain from the terms of the Act, the 
debates in and out of Parliament, and especially 
the emphatic declarations of the Vice-President of 
the Council, that it was intended that such Bible- 
reading should be permitted, unless good cause 
for prohibiting it could be shown, I do not see 
what reason there is for opposing that wish. 
Certainly, I, individually, could with no shadow 
of consistency oppose the teaching of the children 
of other people to do that which my own children 
are taught to do. And, even if the reading the 
Bible were not, as I think it is, consonant with 
political reason and justice, and with a desire to act 
in the spirit of the education measure, I am dis- 
posed to think it might still be well to read that 
book in the elementary schools. 
I have always been strongly in favour of secular 
education, in the sense of education without 
theology; but I must confess I have been no less 
seriously perplexed to know by what practical 
measures the religious feeling, which is the essen- 
tial basis of conduct, was to be kept up, in the 
present utterly chaotic state of opinion on these 
matters, without the use of the Bible. The Pagan 
moralists lack life and colour, and even the noble 
Stoic, Marcus Antonius, is too high and refined 
for an ordinary child. Take the Bible as a whole;

make the severest deductions which fair criticism 
can dictate for shortcomings and positive errors; 
eliminate, as a sensible lay-teacher would do, if 
left to himself, all that it is not desirable for 
children to occupy themselves with; and there 
still remains in this old literature a vast residuum 
of moral beauty and grandeur. And then consider 
the great historical fact that, for three centuries, 
this book has been woven into the life of all that 
is best and noblest in English history; that it has 
become the national epic of Britain, and is as 
familiar to noble and simple, from John-o’-Groat’s 
House to Land’s End, as Dante and Tasso once 
were to the Italians; that it is written in the 
noblest and purest English, and abounds in ex- 
quisite beauties of mere literary form; and, finally, 
that it forbids the veriest hind who never left 
his village to be ignorant of the existence of other 
countries and other civilisations, and of a great 
past, stretching back to the furthest limits of the 
oldest nations in the world. By the study of what 
other book could children be so much humanised 
and made to feel that each figure in that vast his- 
torical procession fills, like themselves, but a mo- 
mentary space in the interval between two eter- 
nities; and earns the blessings or the curses of all 
time, according to its effort to do good and hate 
evil, even as they also are earning their payment 
for their work? 
On the whole, then, I am in favour of reading
-P-A-G-E-407
xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 399 
the Bible, with such grammatical, geographical, 
and historical explanations by a lay-teacher as may 
be needful, with rigid exclusion of any further 
theological teaching than that contained in the 
Bible itself. And in stating what this is, the 
teacher would do well not to go beyond the pre- 
cise words of the Bible; for if he does, he will, 
in the first place, undertake a task beyond his 
strength, seeing that all the Jewish and Christian 
sects have been at work upon that subject for 
more than two thousand years, and have not yet 
arrived, and are not in the least likely to arrive, 
at an agreement; and, in the second place, he will 
certainly begin to teach something distinctively 
denominational, and thereby come into violent 
collision with the Act of Parliament. 
4. The intellectual training to be given in the 
elementary schools must of course, in the first 
place, consist in learning to use the means of 
acquiring knowledge, or reading, writing, and 
arithmetic; and it will be a great matter to teach 
reading so completely that the act shall have be- 
come easy and pleasant. If reading remains 
“hard,” that accomplishment will not be much re- 
sorted to for instruction, and still less for amuse- 
ment—which last is one of its most valuable uses 
to hard-worked people. But along with a due 
proficiency in the use of the means of learning, 
a certain amount of knowledge, of intellectual 
discipline, and of artistic training should be   
 
-P-A-G-E-408
    400 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
conveyed in the elementary schools; and in 
this direction—for reasons which I am afraid 
to repeat, having urged them so often—I can 
conceive no subject-matter of education so appro- 
priate and so important as the rudiments of 
physical science, with drawing, modelling, and 
singing. Not only would such teaching afford the 
best possible preparation for the technical schools 
about which so much is now said, but the organi- 
sation for carrying it into effect already exists. 
The Science and Art Department, the operations 
of which have already attained considerable magni- 
tude, not only offers to examine and pay the 
results of such examination in elementary science 
and art, but it provides what is still more impor- 
tant, viz. a means of giving children of high 
natural ability, who are just as abundant among 
the poor as among the rich, a helping hand. A 
good old proverb tells us that “ One should not take 
a razor to cut a block:” the razor is soon spoiled, 
and the block is not so well cut as it would be with 
a hatchet. But it is worse economy to prevent a 
possible Watt from being anything but a stoker, 
or to give a possible Faraday no chance of doing 
anything but to bind books. Indeed, the loss in 
such cases of mistaken vocation has no measure; 
it is absolutely infinite and irreparable. And 
among the arguments in favour of the interference 
of the State in education, none seems to be 
stronger than this—that it is the interest of every  
-P-A-G-E-409
  xv THE SCHOOL BOARDS 401 
one that ability should be neither wasted, nor 
misapplied, by any one: and, therefore, that every 
one’s representative, the State, is necessarily 
fulfilling the wishes of its constituents when 
it is helping the capacities to reach their proper 
places. 
It may be said that the scheme of education. 
here sketched is too large to be affected in the 
time during which the children will remain at 
school; and, secondly, that even if this objection 
did not exist, it would cost too much. 
I attach no importance whatever to the first 
objection until the experiment has been fairly 
tried. Considering how much catechism, lists of 
the kings of Israel, geography of Palestine, and the 
like, children are made to swallow now, I cannot 
believe there will be any difficulty in inducing 
them to go through the physical training, which 
is more than half play; or the instruction in 
household work, or in those duties to one another 
and to themselves, which have a daily and hourly 
practical interest. That children take kindly to 
elementary science and art no one can doubt who 
has tried the experiment properly. And if Bible- 
reading is not accompanied by constraint and so- 
lemnity, as if it were a sacramental operation, I 
do not believe there is anything in which children 
take more pleasure. At least I know that some 
of the pleasantest recollections of my childhood 
are connected with the voluntary study of an an-
-P-A-G-E-410
  402 THE SCHOOL BOARDS xv 
cient Bible which belonged to my grandmother. 
There were splendid pictures in it, to be sure; 
but I recollect little or nothing about them save 
a portrait of the high priest in his vestments. 
What come vividly back on my mind are remem- 
brances of my delight in the histories of Joseph 
and of David; and of my keen appreciation of the 
chivalrous kindness of Abraham in his dealing 
with Lot. Like a sudden flash there returns back 
upon me, my utter scorn of the pettifogging mean- 
ness of Jacob, and my sympathetic grief over the 
heartbreaking lamentation of the cheated Esau, 
“Hast thou not a blessing for me also, O my 
father?” And I see, as in a cloud, pictures 
of the grand phantasmagoria of the Book of Reve- 
lation. 
I enumerate, as they issue, the childish impres- 
sions which come crowding out of the pigeon-holes 
in my brain, in which they have lain almost un- 
disturbed for forty years. I prize them as an 
evidence that a child of five or six years old, left 
to his own devices, may be deeply interested in 
the Bible, and draw sound moral sustenance from 
it. And I rejoice that I was left to deal with the 
Bible alone; for if I had had some theological 
“explainer” at my side, he might have tried, as 
such do, to lessen my indignation against Jacob, 
and thereby have warped my moral sense for ever; 
while the great apocalyptic spectacle of the ulti- 
mate triumph of right and justice might have been

turned to the base purposes of a pious lampooner 
of the Papacy. 
And as to the second objection—costliness— 
the reply is, first, that the rate and the Parlia- 
mentary grant together ought to be enough, con- 
sidering that science and art teaching is already 
provided for; and, secondly, that if they are not, 
it may be well for the educational parliament to 
consider what has become of those endowments 
which were originally intended-to be devoted, 
more or less largely, to the education of the 
poor. 
When the monasteries were spoiled, some of 
their endowments were applied to the foundation 
of cathedrals; and in all such cases it was ordered 
that a certain portion of the endowment should be 
applied to the purposes of education. How much is 
so applied? Is that which may be so applied given 
to help the poor, who cannot pay for education, or 
does it virtualy subsidise the comparatively rich, 
who can? How are Christ’s Hospital and Alleyn’s 
foundation securing their right purposes, or how 
far are they perverted into contrivances for afford- 
ing relief to the classes who can afford to pay for 
education? How— But this paper is already 
too long, and, if I begin, I may find it hard to stop 
asking questions of this kind, which after all are 
worthy only of the lowest of Radicals.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION 
[1877] 
Any candid observer of the phenomena of 
modern society will readily admit that bores must 
be classed among the enemies of the human race; 
and a little consideration will probably lead him to 
the further admission, that no species of that exten- 
sive genus of noxiouscreatures is more objectionable 
than the educational bore. Convinced as I am of 
the truth of this great social generalisation, it is 
not without a certain trepidation that I venture to 
address you on an educational topic. For, in the 
course of the last ten years, to go back no farther, 
I am afraid to say how often I have ventured to 
speak of education, from that given in the primary 
schools to that which is to be had in the univer- 
sities and medical colleges; indeed, the only part 
of this wide region into which, as yet, I have not 
adventured is that into which I propose to intrude 
to-day. 
Thus, I cannot but be aware that I am dan- 
404
-P-A-G-E-413
  XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 405 
gerously near becoming the thing which all men 
fear and fly. But I have deliberately elected to run 
the risk. For when you did me the honour to ask 
me to address you, an unexpected circumstance had 
led me to occupy myself seriously with the ques- 
tion of technical education; and I had acquired the 
conviction that there are few subjects respecting 
which it is more important for all classes of the 
community to have clear and just ideas than this; 
while, certainly, there is none which is more deserv- 
ing of attention by the Working Men’s Club and 
Institute Union. 
It is not for me to express an opinion whether 
the considerations, which I am about to submit to 
you, will be proved by experience to be just or not, 
but I will do my best to make them clear. Among 
the many good things to be found in Lord Bacon’s 
works, none is more full of wisdom than the saying 
that “truth more easily comes out of error than 
out of confusion.” Clear and consecutive wrong- 
thinking is the next best thing to right-thinking; 
so that, if I succeed in clearing your ideas on this 
topic, I shall have wasted neither your time nor 
my own. 
“Technical education,” in the sense in which 
the term is ordinarily used, and in which I am now 
employing it, means that sort of education which 
is specially adapted to the needs of men whose 
business in life it is to pursue some kind of handi- 
craft; it is, in fact, a fine Greco-Latin equivalent ?
-P-A-G-E-414
  406 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvI 
for what in good vernacular English would be 
called “the teaching of handicrafts.” And prob- 
ably, at this stage of our progress, it may occur to 
many of you to think of the story of the cobbler 
and his last, and to say to yourselves, though you 
will be too polite to put the question openly to me, 
What does the speaker know practically about this 
matter? What is his handicraft? I think the 
question is a very proper one, and unless I were 
prepared to answer it, I hope satisfactorily, I 
should have chosen some other theme. 
The fact is, I am, and have been, any time 
these thirty years, a man who works with his hands 
—a handicraftsman. I do not say this in the 
broadly metaphorical sense in which fine gentlemen, 
with all the delicacy of Agag about them, trip to 
the hustings about election time, and protest that 
they too are working men. I really mean my words 
to be taken in their direct, literal, and straightfor- 
ward sense. In fact, if the most nimble-fingered 
watchmaker among you will come to my workshop, 
he may set me to put a watch together, and I will 
set him to dissect, say, a blackbeetle’s nerves. I do 
not wish to vaunt, but I am inclined to think that 
I shall manage my job to his satisfaction sooner 
than he will do his piece of work to mine. 
In truth, anatomy, which is my handicraft, is 
one of the most difficult kinds of mechanical la- 
bour, involving, as it does, not only lightness and 
dexterity of hand, but sharp eyes and endless pa-
-P-A-G-E-415
  xvI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 407 
tience. And you must not suppose that my par- 
ticular branch of science is especially distinguished 
for the demand it makes upon skill in manipula- 
tion. A similar requirement is made upon all stu- 
dents of physical science. The astronomer, the 
electrician, the chemist, the mineralogist, the bot- 
anist, are constantly called upon to perform manual 
operations of exceeding delicacy. The progress of 
all branches of physical science depends upon ob- 
servation, or on that artificial observation which is 
termed experiment, of one kind or another; and, 
the farther we advance, the more practical difficul- 
ties surround the investigation of the conditions of 
the problems offered to us; so that mobile and yet 
steady hands, guided by clear vision, are more and 
more in request in the workshops of science. 
Indeed, it has struck me that one of the 
grounds of that sympathy between the handicrafts- 
men of this country and the men of science, by 
which it has so often been my good fortune to 
profit, may, perhaps, lie here. You feel and we 
feel that, among the so-called learned folks, we 
alone are brought into contact with tangible facts 
in the way that you are. You know well enough 
that it is one thing to write a history of chairs in 
general, or to address a poem to a throne, or to 
speculate about the occult powers of the chair of 
St. Peter; and quite another thing to make with 
your own hands a veritable chair, that will stand 
fair and square, and afford a safe and satisfac- 
86
-P-A-G-E-416
  408 ‘TECHNICAL EDUCATION xv 
tory resting-place to a frame of sensitiveness and 
solidity. 
So it is with us, when we look out from our sci- 
entific handicrafts upon the doings of our learned 
brethren, whose work is untrammelled by anything 
“base and mechanical,” as handicrafts used to be 
called when the world was younger, and, in some 
respects, less wise than now. We take the greatest 
interest in their pursuits; we are edified by their 
histories and are charmed with their poems, which 
sometimes illustrate so remarkably the powers of 
man’s imagination; some of us admire and even 
humbly try to follow them in their high philo- 
sophical excursions, though we know the risk of 
being snubbed by the inquiry whether grovelling 
dissectors of monkeys and blackbeetles can hope to 
enter into the empyreal kingdom of speculation. 
But still we feel that our business is different; hum- 
bler if you will, though the diminution of dignity 
is, perhaps, compensated by the increase of reality; 
and that we, like you, have to get our work done in 
a region where little avails, if the power of dealing 
with practical tangible facts is wanting. You 
know that clever talk touching joinery will not 
make a chair; and I know that it is of about as 
much value in the physical sciences. Mother Na- 
ture is serenely obdurate to honeyed words; only 
those who understand the ways of things, and can 
silently and effectually handle them, get any good 
out of her.
-P-A-G-E-417
XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 409 
And now, having, as I hope, justified my as- 
sumption of a place among handicraftsmen, and 
put myself right with you as to my qualification, 
from practical knowledge, to speak about technical 
education, I will proceed to lay before you the 
results of my experience as a teacher of a handi- 
craft, and tell you what sort of education I should 
think best adapted for a boy whom one wanted to 
make a professional anatomist. 
I should say, in the first palce, let him have a 
good English elementary education. I do not 
mean that he shall be able to pass in such and 
such a standard—that may or may not be an 
equivalent expression—but that his teaching shall 
have been such as to have given him command of 
the common implements of learning and to have 
created a desire for the things of the under- 
standing. 
Further, I should like him to know the ele- 
ments of physical science, and especially of physics 
and chemistry, and I should take care that this 
elementary knowledge was real. I should like my 
aspirant to be able to read a scientific treatise in 
Latin, French, or German, because an enormous 
amount of anatomical knowledge is locked up in 
those languages. And especially, I should require 
some ability to draw—I do not mean artistically, 
for that is a gift which may be cultivated but can- 
not be learned, but with fair accuracy. I will not 
say that everybody can learn even this; for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
  410 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
negative development of the faculty of drawing in 
some people is almost miraculous. Still every- 
body, or almost everybody, can learn to write; 
and, as writing is a kind of drawing, I suppose 
that the majority of the people who say they can- 
not draw, and give copious evidence of the accu- 
racy of their assertion, could draw, after a fashion, 
if they tried. And that “after a fashion” would 
be better than nothing for my purposes. 
Above all things, let my imaginary pupil have 
preserved the freshness and vigour of youth in his 
mind as well as his body. The educational 
abomination of desolation of the present day is the 
stimulation of young people to work at high 
pressure by incessant competitive examinations. 
Some wise man (who probably was not an early 
riser) has said of early risers in general, that they 
are conceited all the forenoon and stupid all the 
afternoon. Now whether this is true of early 
risers in the common acceptation of the word or 
not, I will not pretend to say; but it is too often 
true of the unhappy children who are forced to 
rise too early in their classes. They are conceited. 
all the forenoon of life, and stupid all its afternoon. 
The vigour and freshness, which should have been 
stored up for the purposes of the hard struggle 
for existence in practical life, have been washed 
out of them by precocious mental debauchery— 
_ by book gluttony and lesson bibbing. Their 
faculties are worn out by the strain put upon their
-P-A-G-E-419
XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 411 
callow brains, and they are demoralised by worth- 
less childish triumphs before the real work of life 
begins. I have no compassion for sloth, but youth 
has more need for intellectual rest than age; and 
the cheerfulness, the tenacity of purpose, the power 
of work which make many a’ successful man what 
he is, must often be placed to the credit; not of 
his hours of industry, but to that of his hours of 
idleness, in boyhood. Even the hardest worker 
of us all, if he has to deal with anything above 
mere details, will do well, now and again, to let 
his brain lie fallow for a space. The next crop of 
thought will certainly be all the fuller in the ear 
and the weeds fewer. 
This is the sort of education which I should 
like any one who was going to devote himself to 
my handicraft to undergo. As to knowing any- 
thing about anatomy itself, on the whole I would 
rather he left that alone until he took it up 
seriously in my laboratory. It is hard work 
enough to teach, and I should not like to have 
superadded to that the possible need of un- 
teaching. 
Well, but, you will say, this is Hamlet with the 
Prince of Denmark left out; your “ technical 
education” is simply a good education, with 
more attention to physical science, to draw- 
ing, and to modern languages than is com- 
mon, and there is nothing specially technical 
about it.
-P-A-G-E-420
  
412 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
Exactly so; that remark takes us straight to 
the heart of what I have to say; which is, that, 
in my judgment, the preparatory education of 
the handicraftsman ought to have nothing of 
what is ordinarily understood by “ technical” 
about it. 
The workshop is the only real school for a 
handicraft. The education which precedes that 
of the workshop should be entirely devoted to the 
strengthening of the body, the elevation of the 
moral faculties, and the cultivation of the intelli- 
gence; and, especially, to the imbuing the mind 
with a broad and clear view of the laws of that 
natural world with the components of which the 
handicraftsman will have to deal. And, the earlier 
the period of life at which the handicraftsman has 
to enter into actual practice of his craft, the more 
important is it that he should devote the precious 
hours of preliminary education to things of the 
mind, which have no direct and immediate bearing 
on his branch of industry, though they lie at the 
foundation of all realities. 
Now let me apply the lessons I have learned 
from my handicraft to yours. If any of you were 
obliged to take an apprentice, I suppose you would 
like to get a good healthy lad, ready and willing 
to learn, handy, and with his fingers not all 
thumbs, as the saying goes. You would like that 
he should read, write, and cipher well; and, if 
 
-P-A-G-E-421
  XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 413 
you were an intelligent master, and your trade 
involved the application of scientific principles, as 
so many trades do, you would like him to know 
enough of the elementary principles of science to 
understand what was going on. I suppose that, 
in nine trades out of ten, it would be useful if he 
could draw; and many of you must have lamented 
your inability to find out for yourselves what for- 
eigners are doing or have done. So that some 
knowledge of French and German might, in many 
cases, be very desirable. 
So it appears to me that what you want is pretty 
much what I want; and the practical question is, 
How you are to get what you need, under the 
actual limitations and conditions of life of handi- 
craftsmen in this country? 
I think I shall have the assent both of the em- 
ployers of labour and of the employed as to one of 
these limitations; which is, that no scheme of 
technical education is likely to be seriously enter- 
tained which will delay the entrance of boys into 
working life, or prevent them from contributing 
towards their own support, as early as they do at 
present. Not only do I believe that any such 
scheme could not be carried out, but I doubt its 
desirableness, even if it were practicable. 
The period between childhood and manhood is 
full of difficulties and dangers, under the most 
favourable circumstances; and, even among the 
well-to-do, who can afford to surround their chil-
-P-A-G-E-422
  414 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
dren with the most favourable conditions, examples 
of a career ruined, before it has well begun, are but 
too frequent. Moreover, those who have to live by 
labour must be shaped to labour early. The colt 
that is left at grass too long makes but a sorry 
draught-horse, though his way of life does not bring 
him within the reach of artificial temptations. Per- 
haps the most valuable result of all education is the 
ability to make yourself do the thing you have to 
do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or 
not; it is the first lesson that ought to be learned; 
and, however early a man’s training begins, it is 
probably the last lesson that he learns thoroughly. 
There is anotherreason, towhich I have already 
adverted, and which I would reiterate, why any ex- 
tension of the time devoted to ordinary school- 
work is undesirable. In the newly-awakened zeal 
for education, we run some risk of forgetting the 
truth that while under instruction is a bad thing, 
over-instruction may possibly be a worse. 
Success in any kind of practical life is not de- 
pendent solely, or indeed chiefly, upon knowledge. 
Even in the learned professions, knowledge 
alone, is of less consequence than people are apt 
to suppose. And, if much expenditure of bodily 
energy is involved in the day’s work, mere knowl- 
edge is of still less importance when weighed 
against the probable cost of its aequirement. To do 
a fair day’s work with his hands, a man needs, 
above all things, health, strength, and the patience
-P-A-G-E-423
xv TECHNICAL EDUCATION 415 
and cheerfulness which, if they do not always ac- 
company these blessings, can hardly in the nature 
of things exist without them; to which we must 
add honesty of purpose and a pride in doing what 
is done well. 
A good handicraftsman can get on very well 
without genius, but he will fare badly without a 
reasonable share of that which is a more useful 
possession for workaday life, namely, mother-wit; 
and he will be all the better for a real knowledge, 
however limited, of the ordinary laws of nature, 
and especially of those which apply to his own 
business. 
Instruction carried so far as to help the scholar 
to turn his store of mother-wit to account, to 
acquire a fair amount of sound elementary know]- 
edge, and to use his hands and eyes; while leav- 
ing him fresh, vigorous, and with a sense of the 
dignity of his own calling, whatever it may be, if 
fairly and honestly pursued, cannot fail to be of 
invaluable service to all those who come under its 
influence. 
But, on the other hand, if school instruction is 
carried so far as to encourage bookishness; if the 
ambition of the scholar is directed, not to the gain- 
ing of knowledge, but to the being able to pass 
examinations successfully; especially if encourage- 
ment is given to the mischievous delusion that 
brainwork is, in itself, and apart from its quality, 
a nobler or more respectable thing than handiwork
-P-A-G-E-424
416 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
—such education may be a deadly mischief to the 
workman, and lead to the rapid ruin of the indus- 
tries it is intended to serve. 
I know that I am expressing the opinion of 
some of the largest as well as the most enlightened 
employers of labour, when I say that there is a real 
danger that, from the extreme of no education, we 
may run to the other extreme of over-education of 
handicraftsmen. And I apprehend that what is 
true for the ordinary hand-worker is true for the 
foreman. Activity, probity, knowledge of men, 
ready mother-wit, supplemented by a good knowl- 
edge of the general principles involved in his 
business, are the making of a good foreman. If he 
possess these qualities, no amount of learning will 
fit him better for his position; while the course of 
life and the habit of mind required for the at- 
tainment of such learning may, in various direct 
and indirect ways, act as direct disqualifications 
for it. 
Keeping in mind, then, that the two things to 
be avoided are, the delay of the entrance of boys 
into practical life, and the substitution of ex- 
hausted bookworms for shrewd, handy men, in our 
works and factories, let us consider what may be 
wisely and safely attempted in the way of improv- 
ing the education of the handicraftsman. 
First, I look to the elementary schools now 
happily established all over the country. I am not 
going to criticise or find fault with them; on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-425
  XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION ALT 
contrary, their establishment seems to me to be the 
most important and the most beneficial result of 
the corporate action of the people in our day. A 
great deal is said of British interests just now, but, 
depend upon it, that no Eastern difficulty needs 
our intervention as a nation so seriously, as the 
putting down both the Bashi-Bazouks of ignorance 
and the Cossacks of sectarianism at home. What 
has already been achieved in these directions is a 
great thing; you must have lived some time to 
know how great. An education, better in its 
processes, better in its substance, than that which 
was accessible to the great majority of well-to-do 
Britons a quarter of a century ago, is now obtain- 
able by every child in the land. Let any man of 
my age go into an ordinary elementary school, and 
unless he was unusually fortunate in his youth, he 
will tell you that the educational method, the in- 
telligence, patience, and good temper on the 
teacher’s part, which are now at the disposal of 
the veriest waifs and wastrels of society, are things 
of which he had no experience in those costly, 
middle-class schools, which were so ingeniously 
contrived as to combine all the evils and short- 
comings of the great public schools with none of 
their advantages. Many a man, whose so-called 
education cost a good deal of valuable money and 
occupied many a year of invaluable time, leaves the 
inspection of a well-ordered elementary school 
devoutly wishing that, in his young days, he had
-P-A-G-E-426
  418 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
had the chance of being as well taught as these 
boys and girls are. 
But while in view of such an advance in general 
education, I willingly obey the natural impulse to 
be thankful, I am not willing altogether to rest. 
I want to see instruction in elementary science 
and in art more thoroughly incorporated in the 
educational system. At present, it is being 
administered by driblets, as if it were a potent 
medicine, “a few drops to be taken occasionally in 
a teaspoon.” Every year I notice that that earnest 
and untiring friend of yours and of mine, Sir 
John Lubbock, stirs up the Government of the 
day in the House of Commons on this subject; 
and also that, every year, he, and the few mem- 
bers of the House of Commons, such as Dr. Play- 
fair, who sympathise with him, are met with ex- 
pressions of warm admiration for science in 
general, and reasons at large for doing nothing in 
particular. But now that Mr. Forster, to whom 
the education of the country owes so much, has 
announced his conversion to the right faith, I 
begin to hope that, sooner or later, things will 
mend. 
I have given what I believe to be a good 
reason for the assumption, that the keeping at 
school of boys, who are to be handicraftsmen, 
beyond the age of thirteen or fourteen is neither 
practicable nor desirable; and, as it is quite cer- 
tain, that, with justice to other and no less impor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-427
  XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 419 
tant branches of education, nothing more than the 
rudiments of science and art teaching can be 
introduced into elementary schools, we must seek 
_ elsewhere for a supplementary training in these 
subjects, and, if need be, in foreign languages, 
which may go on after the workman’s life has 
begun. 
The means of acquiring the scientific and artis- 
tic part of this training already exists in full work- 
ing order, in the first place, in the classes of 
the Science and Art Department, which are, for 
the most part, held in the evening, so as to be 
accessible to all who choose to avail themselves of 
them after working hours. The great advantage 
of these classes is that they bring the means of 
instruction to the doors of the factories and work- 
shops; that they are no artificial creations, but by 
their very existence prove the desire of the people 
for them; and finally, that they admit of indefinite 
development in proportion as they are wanted. I 
have often expressed the opinion, and I repeat it 
here, that, during the eighteen years they have 
been in existence these classes have done incaleu- , 
lable good; and I can say, of my own knowledge, 
that the Department spares no pains and trouble 
in trying to increase their usefulness and ensure 
the soundness of their work. 
No one knows better than my friend Colonel 
Donnelly, to whose clear views and great adminis- 
trative abilities so much of the successful working
-P-A-G-E-428
  420 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
of the science classes is due, that there is much to 
be done before the system can be said to be thor- 
oughly satisfactory. The instruction given needs 
to be made more systematic and especially more 
practical; the teachers are of very unequal excel- 
lence, and not a few stand much in need of instruc- 
tion themselves, not only in the subject which 
they teach, but in the objects for which they 
teach. I dare say you have heard of that pro- 
ceeding, reprobated by all true sportsmen, which 
is called “shooting for the pot.” Well, there is 
such a thing as “ teaching for the pot ”—teaching, 
that is, not that your scholar may know, but 
that he may count for payment among those who 
pass the examination; and there are some teachers, 
happily not many, who have yet to learn that the 
examiners of the Department regard them as 
poachers of the worst description. 
Without presuming in any way to speak in the 
name of the Department, I think I may say, as a 
matter which has come under my own observation, 
that it is doing its best to meet all these difficulties. 
It systematically promotes practical instruction in 
the classes; it affords facilities to teachers who de- 
sire to learn their business thoroughly; and it is 
always ready to aid in the suppression of pot- 
teaching. 
All this is, as you may imagine, highly satis- 
factory to me. I see that spread of scientific 
education, about which I have so often permitted
-P-A-G-E-429
  XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 421 
myself to worry the public, become, for all practical 
purposes, an accomplished fact. Grateful as I am 
for all that is now being done, in the same direc- 
tion, in our higher schools and universities, I have 
ceased to have any anxiety about the wealthier 
classes. Scientific knowledge is spreading by 
what the alchemists called a “distillatio per 
ascensum;” and nothing now can prevent it from 
continuing to distil upwards and permeate English 
society, until, in the remote future, there shall be 
no member of the legislature who does not know 
as much of science as an elementary school-boy; 
and even the heads of houses in our venerable 
seats of learning shall acknowledge that natural 
science is not merely a sort of University back- 
door through which inferior men may get at their 
degrees. Perhaps this apocalyptic vision is a little 
wild; and I feel I ought to ask pardon for an 
outbreak of enthusiasm, which, I assure you, is 
not my commonest failing. 
I have said that the Government is already do- 
ing a great deal in aid of that kind of technical 
education for handicraftsmen which, to my mind, 
is alone worth seeking. Perhaps it is doing as much 
as it ought to do, even in this direction. Certainly 
there is another kind of help of the most important 
character, for which we may look elsewhere than 
to the Government. The great mass of mankind 
have neither the liking, nor the aptitude, for 
either literary, or scientific, or artistic pursuits; nor,  
-P-A-G-E-430
  492 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvI 
indeed, for excellence of any sort. Their ambition 
is to go through life with moderate exertion and a 
fair share of ease, doing common things in a com- 
mon way. And a great blessing and comfort it is 
that the majority of men are of this mind; for the 
majority of things to be done are common things, 
and are quite well enough done when commonly 
done. The great end of life is not knowledge but 
action. What men need is, as much knowledge as 
they can assimilate and organise into a basis for 
action; give them more and it may become 
injurious. One knows people who are as heavy 
and stupid from undigested learning as others are 
from over-fulness of meat and drink. But a small 
percentage of the population is born, with that most 
excellent quality, a desire for excellence, or with 
special aptitudes of some sort or another; Mr. 
Galton tells us that not more than one in four thou- 
sand may be expected to attain distinction, and not 
more than one in a million some share of that in- 
tensity of instinctive aptitude, that burning thirst 
for excellence, which is called genius. 
Now, the most important object of all educa- 
tional schemes is to catch these exceptional people, 
and turn them to account for the good of society. 
No man can say where they will crop up; like 
their opposites, the fools and knaves, they appear 
sometimes in the palace, and sometimes in the 
hovel; but the great thing to be aimed at, I was 
almost going to say the most important end of all
-P-A-G-E-431
  XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 493 
social arrangements, is to keep these glorious sports 
of Nature from being either corrupted by luxury 
or starved by poverty, and to put them into the 
position in which they can do the work for which 
they are especially fitted. 
Thus, if a lad in an elementary school showed 
signs of special capacity, I would try to provide 
him with the means of continuing his education 
after his daily working life had begun; if in the 
evening classes he developed special capabilities 
in the direction of science or of drawing, I would 
try to secure him an apprenticeship to some trade 
in which those powers would have applicability. 
Or, if he chose to become a teacher, he should have 
the chance of so doing. Finally, to the lad of 
genius, the one in a million, I would make accessi- 
ble the highest and most complete training the 
country could afford. Whatever that might cost, 
depend upon it the investment would be a good 
one. I weigh my words when I say that if the 
nation could purchase a potential Watt, or Davy, 
or Faraday, at the cost of a hundred thousand 
pounds down, he would be dirt-cheap at the money. 
It is a mere commonplace and everyday piece of 
knowledge, that what these three men did has 
produced untold millions of wealth, in the narrow- 
est economical sense of the word. 
Therefore, as the sum and crown of what is to 
be done for technical education, I look to the pro- 
vision of a machinery for winnowing out the capa- 
87
-P-A-G-E-432
  494 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
cities and giving them scope. When I was a mem- 
ber of the London School Board, I said, in the 
course of a speech, that our business was to provide 
a ladder, reaching from the gutter to the univer- 
sity, along which every child in the three kingdoms 
should have the chance of climbing as far as he 
was fit to go. This phrase was so much bandied 
about at the time, that, to say truth, I am rather 
tired of it; but I know of no other which so fully 
expresses my belief, not only about education in 
general, but about technical education in par- 
ticular. 
The essential foundation of all the organisation 
needed for the promotion of education among 
handicraftsmen will, I believe, exist in this coun- 
try, when every working lad can feel that society 
has done as much as lies in its power to remove all 
needless and artificial obstacles from his path; 
that there is no barrier, except such as exists in 
the nature of things, between himself and what- 
ever place in the social organisation he is fitted to 
fill; and, more than this, that, if he has capacity 
and industry, a hand is held out to help him 
along any path which is wisely and honestly 
chosen. 
I have endeavoured to point out to you that a 
great deal of such an organisation already exists; 
and I am glad to be able to add that there is a 
good prospect that what is wanting will, before 
long, be supplemented.
-P-A-G-E-433
ee ne XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 495 
Those powerful and wealthy societies, the livery 
companies of the City of London, remembering 
that they are the heirs and representatives of the 
trade guilds of the Middle Ages, are interesting 
themselves in the question. So far back as 1872 
the Society of Arts organised a system of instruc- 
tion in the technology of arts and manufactures, 
for persons actually employed in factories and 
workshops, who desired to extend and improve 
‘their knowledge of the theory and practice of their 
particular avocations; * and a considerable subsidy, 
in aid of the efforts of the Society, was liberally 
granted by the Clothworkers’ Company. We have 
here the hopeful commencement of a rational or- 
ganisation for the promotion of excellence among 
handicraftsmen. Quite recently, other of the 
| livery companies have determined upon giving 
| their powerful, and, indeed, almost boundless, aid 
to the improvement of the teaching of handicrafts. 
They have already gone so far as to appoint a 
committee to act for them; and I betray no confi- 
dence in adding that, some time since, the com- 
mittee sought the advice and assistance of several 
persons, myself among the number. 
Of course I cannot tell you what may be the 
result of the deliberations of the committee; but 
we may all fairly hope that, before long, steps 
which will have a weighty and a lasting influence

on the growth and spread of sound and thorough 
teaching among the handicraftsmen * of this coun- 
try will be taken by the livery companies of Lon- 
don. 
[This hope has been fully justified by the es- 
tablishment of the Cowper Street Schools, and 
that of the Central Institution of the City and 
Guilds of London Institute, September, 1881.]

ADDRESS ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROMOTION 
OF TECHNICAL EDUCATION 
[1887] 
Mr. Mayor anp GENTLEMEN,—It must be a 
matter of sincere satisfaction to those who, like 
myself, have for many years past been convinced 
of the vital importance of technical education to 
this country to see that that subject is now being 
taken up by some of the most important of our 
manufacturing towns. The evidence which is 
afforded of the public interest in the matter by 
such meetings as those at Liverpool and New- 
castle, and, last but not least, by that at which I 
have the honour to be present to-day, may con- 
vince us all, I think, that the question has passed 
out of the region of speculation into that of action. 
I need hardly say to any one here that the task 
which our Association contemplates is not only 
427
-P-A-G-E-436
    498 TECHNICAL EDUCATION svi 
one of primary importance—I may say of vital im- 
portance—to the welfare of the country; but that 
it is one of great extent and of vast difficulty. 
There is a well-worn adage that those who set 
out upon a great enterprise would do well to count 
the cost. I am not sure that this is always true. 
I think that some of the very greatest enterprises 
in this world have been carried out successfully 
simply because the people who undertook them did 
not count the cost; and I am much of opinion 
that, in this very case, the most instructive con- 
sideration for us is the cost of doing nothing. But 
there is one thing that is perfectly certain, and it 
is that, in undertaking all enterprises, one of 
the most important conditions of success is to 
have a perfectly clear comprehension of what you 
want to do—to have that before your minds before 
you set out, and from that point of view to consider 
carefully the measures which are best adapted to 
the end. 
Mr. Acland has just given you an excellent 
account of what is properly and strictly understood 
by technical education; but I venture to think 
that the purpose of this Association may be stated 
in somewhat broader terms, and that the object we 
have in view is the development of the industrial 
productivity of the country to the uttermost limits 
consistent with social welfare. And you will 
observe that, in thus widening the definition of 
our object, I have gone no further than the Mayor
-P-A-G-E-437
vir TECHNICAL EDUCATION 499 
in his speech, when he not obscurely hinted—and 
most justly hinted—that in dealing with this ques- 
tion there are other matters than technical educa- 
tion, in the strict sense, to be considered. 
It would be extreme presumption on my part if 
I were to attempt to tell an audience of gentlemen 
intimately acquainted with all branches of industry 
and commerce, such as I see before me, in what 
manner the practical details of the operations that 
we propose are to be carried out. I am absolutely 
ignorant both of trade and of commerce, and upon 
such matters I cannot venture to say a solitary 
word. But there is one direction in which I think 
it possible I may be of service—not much perhaps, 
but still of some,—because this matter, in the 
first place, involves the consideration of methods of 
education with which it has been my business to 
occupy myself during the greater part of my life; 
and, in the second place, it involves attention to 
some of those broad facts and laws of nature with 
which it has been my business to acquaint myself 
to the best of my ability. And what I think may 
be possible is this, that if I succeed in putting be- 
fore you—as briefly as I can, but in clear and con- 
nected shape—what strikes me as the programme 
that we have eventually to carry out, and what 
are the indispensable conditions of success, that 
that proceeding, whether the conclusions at which 
I arrive be such as you approve or as you disap- 
prove, will nevertheless help to clear the course.
-P-A-G-E-438
4380 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVIL 
In this and in all complicated matters we must re- 
member a saying of Bacon, which may be freely 
translated thus: “Consistent error is very often 
vastly more useful than muddle-headed truth.” 
At any rate, if there be any error in the conclusions 
I shall put before you, I will do my best to make 
the error perfectly clear and plain. 
Now, looking at the question of what we want 
to do in this broad and general way, it appears to 
me that it is necessary for us, in the first place, to 
amend and improve our system of primary educa- 
tion in such a fashion as will make it a proper 
preparation for the business of life. In the second 
place, I think we have to consider what measures 
may best be adopted for the development to its 
uttermost of that which may be called technical 
skill; and, in the third place, I think we have to 
consider what other matters there are for us to at- 
tend to, what other arrangements have to be kept 
carefully in sight in order that, while pursuing 
these ends, we do not forget that which is the end 
of civil existence, I mean a stable social state 
without which all other measures are merely 
futile, and, in effect, modes of going faster to 
ruin. 
‘You are aware—no people should know the fact 
better than Manchester people—that, within the 
last seventeen years, a vast system of primary 
education has been created and extended over the 
whole country. I had some part in the original
-P-A-G-E-439
  XVII TECHNICAL EDUCATION 431 
organisation of this system in London, and I am 
glad to think that, after all these years, I can look 
back upon that period of my life as perhaps the 
part of it least wasted. 
No one can doubt that this system of primary 
education has done wonders for our population; 
but, from our point of view, I do not think any- 
body can doubt that it still has very considerable 
defects. It has the defect which is common to all 
the educational systems which we have inherited— 
it is too bookish, too little practical. The child is 
brought too little into contact with actual facts and 
things, and as the system stands at present it con- 
stitutes next to no education of those particular 
faculties which are of the utmost importance to 
industrial life—I mean the faculty of observation, 
the faculty of working accurately, of dealing with 
’ things instead of with words. I do not propose to 
enlarge upon this topic, but I would venture to 
suggest that there are one or two remedial mea- 
sures which are imperatively needed; indeed, they 
have already been alluded to by Mr. Acland. 
Those which strike me as of the greatest impor- 
tance are two, and the first of them is the teaching 
of drawing. In my judgment, there is no mode 
of exercising the faculty of observation and the 
faculty of accurate reproduction of that which is 
observed, no discipline which so readily tests error 
in these matters, as drawing properly taught. 
And by that I do not mean artistic drawing; I
-P-A-G-E-440
    432 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
mean figuring natural objects: making plans and 
sections, approaching geometrical rather than 
artistic drawing. I do not wish to exaggerate, 
but I declare to you that, in my judgment, the 
child who has been taught to make an accurate 
elevation, plan and section of a pint pot has had 
an admirable training in accuracy of eye and hand. 
Iam not talking about artistic education. That is 
not the question. Accuracy is the foundation of 
everything else, and instruction in artistic drawing 
is something which may be put off till a later 
stage. Nothing has struck me more in the course 
of my life than the loss which persons, who are 
pursuing scientific knowledge of any kind, sustain 
from the difficulties which arise because they never 
have been taught elementary drawing; and I am 
glad to say that in Eton, a school of whose govern- 
ing body I have the honour of being a member, we 
some years ago made drawing imperative on the 
whole school. 
The other matter in which we want some 
systematic and good teaching is what I have 
hardly a name for, but which may best be ex- 
plained as a sort of developed object lessons such 
as Mr. Acland adverted to. Anybody who knows 
his business in science can make anything sub- 
servient to that purpose. You know it was said of 
Dean Swift that he could write an admirable poem 
upon a broomstick, and the man who has a real 
knowledge of science can make the commonest ob-
-P-A-G-E-441
  xvit TECHNICAL EDUCATION 433 
ject in the world subservient to an introduction to 
the principles and greater truths of natural knowl- 
edge. It is in that way that your science must be 
taught if it is to be of real service. Do not suppose 
any amount of book work, any repetition by rote of 
catechisms and other abominations of that kind 
are of value for our object. That is mere wasting 
of time. But take the commonest object and lead 
the child from that foundation to such truths of a 
higher order as may be within his grasp. With 
regard to drawing, I do not think there is any 
practical difficulty; but in respect to the scientific 
object lessons you want teachers trained in a man- 
ner different from that which now prevails. 
If it is found practicable to add further training 
of the hand and eye by instruction in modelling or 
in simple carpentry, well and good. But I should 
stop at this point. The elementary schools are 
already charged with quite as much as they can 
do properly; and I do not believe that any good 
can come of burdening them with special tech- 
nical instruction. Out of that, I think, harm would 
come. 
Now let me pass to my second point, which is 
the development of technical skill. Everybody 
here is aware that at this present moment there is 
hardly a branch of trade or of commerce which 
does not depend, more or less directly, upon some 
department or other of physical science, which 
does not involve, for its successful pursuit, reason-
-P-A-G-E-442
  434 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvi 
ing from scientific data. Our machinery, our 
chemical processes or dyeworks, and a thousand 
operations which it is not necessary to mention, are 
all directly and immediately connected with sci- 
ence. You have to look among your workmen and 
foremen for persons who shall intelligently grasp 
the modifications, based upon science, which are 
constantly being introduced into these industrial 
processes. I do not mean that you want profes- 
sional chemists, or physicists, or mathematicians, 
or the like, but you want people sufficiently famil- 
iar with the broad principles which underlie in- 
dustrial operations to be able to adapt themselves to 
new conditions. Such qualifications can only be 
secured by a sort of scientific instruction which 
occupies a midway place between those primary 
notions given in the elementary schools and those 
more advanced studies which would be carried out 
in the technical schools. 
You are aware that, at present, a very large 
machinery is in operation for the purpose of giving 
this instruction. I don’t refer merely to such work 
as is being done at Owens College here, for exam- 
ple, or at other local colleges. I allude to the 
larger operations of the Science and Art Depart- 
ment, with which I have been connected for a great 
many years. I constantly hear a great many ob- 
jections raised to the work of the Science and 
Art Department. If you will allow me to say so, 
my connection with that department—which, I am
-P-A-G-E-443
  xvi TECHNICAL EDUCATION 435 
happy to say, remains, and which I am very proud 
of—is purely honorary; and, if it appeared to me 
to be right to criticise that department with mer- 
ciless severity, the Lord President, if he were in- 
clined to resent my proceedings, could do nothing 
more than dismiss me. Therefore you may believe 
that I speak with absolute impartiality. My im- 
pression is this, not that it is faultless, nor that it 
has not various defects, nor that there are not 
sundry lacune which want filling up; but that, if 
we consider the conditions under which the Depart- 
ment works, we shall see that certain defects are 
inseparable from those conditions. People talk of 
the want of flexibility of the Department, of its 
being bound by strict rules. Now, will any man 
of common sense who has had anything to do with 
the administration of public funds or knows the 
humour of the House of Commons on these mat- 
ters—will any man who is in the smallest degree 
acquainted with the practical working of State 
departments of any kind, imagine that such a 
department could be other than bound by minutely 
defined regulations? Can he imagine that the 
work of the department should go on fairly and in 
such a manner as to be free from just criticism, 
unless it were bound by certain definite and fixed 
rules? I cannot imagine it. 
The next objection of importance that I have 
heard commonly repeated is that the teaching is 
too theoretical, that there is insufficient practical 
 
-P-A-G-E-444
  436 | TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvi 
teaching. I venture to say that there is no one 
who has taken more pains to insist upon the com- 
parative uselessness of scientific teaching without 
practical work than I have; I venture to say that 
there are no persons who are more cognisant of 
these defects in the work of the Science and Art 
Department than those who administer it. But 
those who talk in this way should acquaint them- 
selveswith the fact that proper practical instruction 
is a matter of no small difficulty in the present 
scarcity of properly taught teachers, that it is very 
costly, and that, in some branches of science, there 
are other difficulties which I won’t allude to. But 
it is a matter of fact that, wherever it has been 
possible, practical teaching has been introduced, 
and has been made an essential element in exam- 
ination; and no doubt if the House of Commons 
would grant unlimited means, and if proper 
teachers were to hand, as thick as blackberries, 
there would not be much difficulty in organising a 
complete system of practical instruction and exam- 
ination ancillary to the present science classes. 
Those who quarrel with the present state of affairs 
would be better advised if, instead of groaning over 
the shortcomings of the present system, they would 
put before themselves these two questions—Is it 
possible under the conditions to invent any better 
system? Is it possible under the conditions to en- 
large the work of practical teaching and practical 
examination which is the one desire of those who
-P-A-G-E-445
  XVIL TECHNICAL EDUCATION 437 
administer the department? That is all I have to 
say upon that subject. 
Supposing we have this teaching of what I may 
call intermediate science, what we want next is 
technical instruction, in the strict sense of the 
word technical; I mean instruction in that kind 
of knowledge which is essential to the successful 
prosecution of the several branches of trade and 
industry. Now, the best way of obtaining this end 
is a matter about which the most experienced 
persons entertain very diverse opinions. I do not 
for one moment pretend to dogmatise about it; I 
can only tell you what the opinion is that I have 
formed from hearing the views of those who are 
certainly best qualified to judge, from those who 
have tested the various methods of conveying this 
instruction. I think we have before us three 
possibilities. We have, in the first place, trade 
schools—I mean schools in which branches of trade 
are taught. We have, in the next place, schools 
attached to factories for the purpose of instructing 
young apprentices and others who go there, and 
who aim at becoming intelligent workmen and 
capable foremen. We have, lastly, the system of 
day classes and evening classes. With regard to 
the first there is this objection, that they can be 
attended only by those who are not obliged to 
earn their bread, and consequently that they will 
reach only a very small fraction of the population. 
Moreover, the expense of trade schools is enor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
  438 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvIt 
mous, and those who are best able to judge assure 
me that, inasmuch as the work which they do is 
not done under conditions of pecuniary success or 
failure, it is apt to be too amateurish and specula- 
tive, and that it does not prepare the worker for 
the real conditions under which he will have to 
carry out his work. In any case, the fact that the 
schools are very expensive, and the fact that they 
are accessible only to a small portion of the popu- 
lation, seem to me to constitute a very serious 
objection to them. I suppose the best of all 
possible oranisations is that of a school attached 
to a factory, where the employer has an interest in 
seeing that the instruction given is of a thoroughly 
practical kind, and where the pupils pass gradually 
by successive stages to the position of actual 
workmen. Schools of this kind exist in various 
parts of the country, but it is obvious that they 
are not likely to be reached by any large part of 
the population; so that it appears to me we are 
shut up practically to schools accessible to those 
who are earning their bread, and in such cases they 
must be essentially evening classes. I am strongly 
of opinion that classes of this kind do an immense 
amount of good; that they have this admirable 
quality, that they involve voluntary attendance, 
take no man out of his position, but enable any 
who chooses, to make the best of the position he 
happens to occupy. 
Suppose that all these things are desirable, what
-P-A-G-E-447
  xvi TECHNICAL EDUCATION 439 
is the best way of obtaining them? I must con- 
fess that I have a strong prejudice in favour of 
carrying out undertakings of this kind, which at 
first, at any rate, must be to a great extent tenta- 
tive and experimental, by private effort. I don’t 
believe that the man lives at this present time 
‘who is competent to organise a final system of * 
technical education. I believe that all attempts 
made in that direction must for many years to come 
be experimental, and that we must get to success 
through a series of blunders. Now that work is 
far better performed by private enterprise than in 
any other way. But there is another method 
which I think is permissible, and not only permis- 
sible but highly recommendable in this case, and 
that is the method of allowing the locality itself 
in which any branch of industry is pursued to be 
its own judge of its own wants, and to tax itself 
under certain conditions for the purpose of carry- 
ing out any scheme of technical education adapted 
to its needs. I am aware that there are many ex- 
treme theorists of the individualist school who hold 
that all this is very wicked and very wrong, and 
that by leaving things to themselves they will get 
right. Well, my experience of the world is that 
things left to themselves don’t get right. I believe 
it to be sound doctrine that a municipality—and 
the State itself for that matter—is a corpora- 
tion existing for the benefit of its members, and 
that here, as in all other cases, it is for the majority 
88
-P-A-G-E-448
  440 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVI 
to determine that which is for the good of the 
whole, and to act upon that. That is the principle 
which underlies the whole theory of government 
in this country, and if it is wrong we shall have 
to go back a long way. But you may ask me, 
“This process of local taxation can only be carried 
out under the authority of an Act of Parliament, 
and do you propose to let any municipality or any 
local authority have carte blanche in these matters; 
is the Legislature to allow it to tax the whole 
body of its members to any extent it pleases and 
for any purposes it pleases?” I should reply, 
certainly not. 
Let me point out to you that at this present 
moment it passes the wit of man, so far as I know, 
to give a legal definition of technical education. 
If you expect to have an Act of Parliament with a 
definition which shall include all that ought to be 
included, and exclude all that ought to be excluded, 
I think you will have to wait a very long time. I 
imagine the whole matter is in a tentative state. 
You don’t know what you will be called upon to 
do, and so you must try and you must blunder. 
Under these circumstances it is obvious that there 
are two alternatives. One of these is to give a free 
hand to each locality. Well, it is within my knowl- 
edge that there are a good many people with 
wonderful, strange, and wild notions as to what 
ought to be done in technical education, and it is 
quite possible that in some places, and especially
-P-A-G-E-449
xvi TECHNICAL EDUCATION 441 
in small places, where there are few persons who 
take an interest in these things, you will have 
very remarkable projects put forth, and in that 
case the sole court of appeal for those taxpayers, 
who did not approve of such projects, would be a 
court of law. I suppose the judges would have to 
settle what is technical education. That would not 
be an edifying process, I think, and certainly it 
would be a very costly one. The other alternative 
is the principle adopted in the bill of last year now 
abandoned. I don’t say whether the bill was right 
or wrong in detail. I am dealing now only with 
the principle of the bill, which appears to me to 
have been very often misunderstood. It has been 
said that it gave the whole of technical education 
into the hands of the Science and Art Department. 
It appears to me nothing could be more unfound- 
ed than that assertion. All I understand the Gov- 
ernment proposed to do was to provide some au- 
thority who should have power to say in case any 
scheme was proposed, “ Well, this comes within the 
four corners‘of the Act of Parliament, work it as 
you like;” or if it was an obviously questionable 
project, should take upon itself the responsibility 
of saying, “No, that is not what the Legislature 
intended; amend your scheme.” ‘There was no 
initiative, no control; there was simply this power 
of giving authority to decide upon the meaning of 
the Act of Parliament to a particular department 
of the State, whichever it might be; and it seems 
 
-P-A-G-E-450
  449 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvIt 
to me that that is a very much simpler and better 
process than relegating the whole question to the 
law courts. I think that here, or anywhere else, 
people must be extremely sanguine if they suppose 
that the House of Commons and the House of 
Lords will ever dream of giving any local authority 
unlimited power to tax the inhabitants of a district 
for any object it pleases. I should say that was 
not in the range of practical politics. Well, I put 
that before you as a matter for your considera- 
tion. 
Another very important point in this connec- 
tion is the question of the supply of teachers. I 
should say that is one of the greatest difficulties 
which beset the whole problem before us. I do not 
wish in the slightest degree to criticise the exist- 
ing system of preparing teachers for ordinary 
school work. I have nothing to say about it. But 
what I do wish to say, and what I trust I may 
impress on your minds firmly is this, that for 
the purpose of obtaining persons competent to 
teach science or to act as technical teachers, a 
different system must be adopted. For this pur- 
pose a man must know what he is about 
thoroughly, and be able to deal with his subject as 
if it were the business of his ordinary life. For 
this purpose, for the obtaining of teachers of 
science and of technical classes, the system of 
catching a boy or girl young, making a pupil 
teacher of him, compelling the poor little mortal
-P-A-G-E-451
  xv TECHNICAL EDUCATION 443 
to pour from his little bucket, into a still smaller 
bucket, that which has just been poured into it out 
of a big bucket; and passing him afterwards 
through the training college, where his life is 
devoted to filling the bucket from the pump from 
morning till night, without time for thought or 
reflection, is a system which should not continue. 
Let me assure you that it will not do for us, that 
you had better give the attempt up than try that 
system. I remember somewhere reading of an in- 
erview between the poet Southey and a good 
Quaker. Southey was a man of marvellous powers 
of work. He had a habit of dividing his time into 
little parts each of which was filled up, and 
he told the Quaker what he did in this hour and 
hat, and so on through the day until far into the 
night. The Quaker listened, and at the close said, 
“Well, but, friend Southey, when dost thee 
think?” The system which I am now adverting 
o is arranged and condemned by putting that 
question to it. When does the unhappy pupil 
eacher, or over-drilled student of a training col- 
ege, find any time to think? I am sure if I were 
in their place I could not. I repeat, that kind of 
thing will not do for science teachers. For science 
eachers must have knowledge, and knowledge is 
not to be acquired on these terms. The power of 
repetition is, but that is not knowledge. The 
knowledge which is absolutely requisite in dealing 
with young children is the knowledge you possess,  
-P-A-G-E-452
  444 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvIL 
as you would know your own business, and which 
you can just turn about as if you were explaining 
to a boy a matter of everyday life. 
So far as science teaching and technical educa- 
tion are concerned, the most important of all 
hings is to provide the machinery for training 
roper teachers. The Department of Science and 
Art has been at that work for years and years, and 
hough unable under present conditions to do so 
much as could be wished, it has, I believe, already 
begun to leaven the lump to a very considerable 
extent. If technical education is to be carried out 
on the scale at present contemplated, this particu- 
ar necessity must be specially and most seriously 
vovided for. And there is another difficulty, 
namely, that when you have got your science or 
echnical teacher it may not be easy to keep him. 
You have educated a man—a clever fellow very 
ikely—on the understanding that he is to be a 
eacher. But the business of teaching is not a 
very lucrative and not a very attractive one, and 
an able man who has had a good training is under 
extreme temptations to carry his knowledge and 
his skill to a better market, in which case you 
have had all your trouble for nothing. It has 
often occurred to me that probably nothing would 
e of more service in this matter than the creation 
of a number of not very large bursaries or exhi- 
bitions, to be gained by persons nominated by the 
authorities of the various science colleges and  
-P-A-G-E-453
  xvII TECHNICAL EDUCATION A4B 
schools of the country—persons such as they 
thought to be well qualified for the teaching 
business—and to be held for a certain term of 
years, during which the holders should be bound 
to teach. I believe that some measure of this kind 
would do more to secure a good supply of teachers 
than anything else. Pray note that I do not sug- 
gest that you should try to get hold of good 
teachers by competitive examination. That is not 
the best way of getting men of that special quali- 
fication. An effectual method would be to ask 
professors and teachers of any institution to rec- 
ommend mien who, to their own knowledge, are 
worthy of such support, and are likely to turn it 
to good account. 
I trust I am not detaining you too long; but 
there remains yet one other matter which I think 
is of profound importance, perhaps of more im- 
portance than all the rest, on which I earnestly beg 
to be permitted to say some few words. It is the 
need, while doing all these things, of keeping an 
eye, and an anxious eye, upon those measures which 
are necessary for the preservation of that stable 
and sound condition of the whole social organism 
which is the essential condition of real progress, 
and a chief end of all education. You will all recol- 
lect that some time ago there was a scandal and a 
great outery about certain cutlasses and bayonets 
which had been supplied to our troops and sailors. 
These warlike implements were polished as bright 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  446 TECHNICAL EDUCATION xvul 
as rubbing could make them; they were very well 
sharpened; they looked lovely. But when they 
were applied to the test of the work of war they 
broke and were bent, and proved more likely to 
hurt the hand of him that used them than to do 
any harm to the enemy. Let me apply that 
analogy to the effect of education, which is a 
sharpening and polishing of the mind. You may 
develop the intellectual side of people as far as 
you like, and you may confer upon them all the 
skill that training and instruction can give; but, 
if there is not, underneath all that outside form 
and superficial polish, the firm fibre’ of healthy 
manhood and earnest desire to do well, your la- 
bour is absolutely in vain. 
Let me further call your attention to the fact 
that the terrible battle of competition between the 
different nations of the world is no transitory 
phenomenon, and does not depend upon this or 
that fluctuation of the market, or upon any condi- 
tion that is likely to pass away. It is the inevitable 
result of that which takes place throughout nature 
and affects man’s part of nature as much as any 
other—namely, the struggle for existence, arising 
out of the constant tendency of all creatures in the 
animated world to multiply indefinitely. It is that, 
if you look at it, which is at the bottom of all the 
great movements of history. It is that inherent 
tendency of the social organism to generate the 
causes of its own destruction, never yet counter-
-P-A-G-E-455
xv TECHNICAL EDUCATION 447 
acted, which has been at the bottom of half the 
catastrophes which have ruined States. We are 
at present in the swim of one of those vast move- 
ments in which, with a population far in excess of 
that which we can feed, we are saved from a 
catastrophe, through the impossibility of feeding 
them, solely by our possession of a fair share of 
the markets of the world. And in order that 
that fair share may be retained, it is absolutely 
necessary that we should be able to produce com- 
modities which we can exchange with food-grow- 
ing people, and which they will take, rather than 
those of our rivals, on the ground of their 
greater cheapness or of their greater excellence. 
That is the whole story. And our course, 
let me say, is not actuated by mere motives 
of ambition or by mere motives of greed. Those 
doubtless are visible enough on the surface of these 
great movements, but the movements themselves 
have far deeper sources. If there were no such 
things as ambition and greed in this world, the 
struggle for existence would arise from the same 
causes. 
Our sole chance of succeeding in a competition, 
which must constantly become more and more 
severe, is that our people shall not only have the 
knowledge and the skill which are required, but 
that they shall have the will and the energy and 
the honesty, without which neither knowledge nor 
skill can be of any permanent avail. This is what
-P-A-G-E-456
448 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVII 
I mean by a stable social condition, because any 
other condition than this, any social condition in 
which the development of wealth involves the 
misery, the physical weakness, and the degrada- 
tion of the worker, is absolutely and infallibly 
doomed to collapse. Your bayonets and cutlasses 
will break under your hand, and there will go on 
accumulating in society a mass of hopeless, 
physically incompetent, and morally degraded 
peple, who are, as it were, a sort of dynamite 
which, sooner or later, when its accumulation be- 
comes sufficient and its tension intolerable, will 
burst the whole fabric. 
Tam quite aware that the problem which I have 
put before you and which you know as much about 
as I do, and a great deal more probably, is one 
extremely difficult to solve. I am fully aware 
that one great factor in industrial success is 
reasonable cheapness of labour. That has been 
pointed out over and over again, and is in itself an 
axiomatic proposition. And it seems to me that 
of all the social questions which face us at this 
present time, the most serious is how to steer a 
clear course between the two horns of an obvious 
dilemma. One of these is the constant tendency 
of competition to lower wages beyond a point at 
which man can remain man—below a point at 
which decency and cleanliness and order and 
habits of morality and justice can reasonably be 
expected to exist. And the other horn of the
-P-A-G-E-457
XVI TECHNICAL EDUCATION 449 
dilemma is. the difficulty of maintaining wages 
above this point consistently with success in in- 
dustrial competition. I have not the remotest con- 
ception how this problem will eventually work 
itself out; but of this I am perfectly convinced, 
that the sole course compatible with safety lies 
between the two extremes; between the Scylla of 
successful industrial production with a degraded 
population, on the one side, and the Charybdis of 
a population, maintained in a reasonable and 
decent state, with failure in industrial competition, 
on the other side. Having this strong conviction, 
which, indeed, I imagine must be that of every 
person who has ever thought seriously about these 
great problems, I have ventured to put it before 
you in this bare and almost cynical fashion because 
it will justify the strong appeal, which I make to 
all concerned in this work of promoting industrial 
education, to have a care, at the same time, that 
the conditions of industrial life remain those in 
which the physical energies of the population may 
be maintained at a proper level; in which their 
moral state may be cared for; in which there may 
be some rays of hope and pleasure in their lives; 
and in which the sole prospect of a life of labour 
may not be an old age of penury. 
These are the chief suggestions I have to offer 
to you, though I have omitted much that I should 
like to have said, had time permitted. It may be 
that some of you feel inclined to look upon them
-P-A-G-E-458
  450 TECHNICAL EDUCATION XVII 
as the Utopian dreams of a student. If there be 
such, let me tell you that there are, to my 
knowledge, manufacturing towns in this country, 
not one-tenth the size, or boasting one-hundredth 
part of the wealth, of Manchester, in which I do 
not say that the programme that I have put before 
you is completely carried out, but in which, at any 
rate, a wise and intelligent effort had been made 
to realise it, and in which the main parts of the 
programme are in course of being worked out. 
This is not the first time that I have had the 
privilege and pleasure of addressing a Manchester 
audience. I have often enough, before now, thrown 
myself with entire confidence upon the hard- 
headed intelligence and the very soft-hearted 
Jennies of Manchester people, when I have had 
a difficult and complicated scientific argument to 
put before them. If, after the considerations which 
I have put before you—and which, pray be it 
understood, I by no means claim particularly for 
myself, for I presume they must be in the minds 
of a large number of people who have thought 
about this matter—if it be that these ideas com- 
mend themselves to your mature reflection, then 
I am perfectly certain that my appeal to you to 
carry them into practice, with that abundant 
energy and will which have led you to take a fore- 
most part in the great social movements of our 
country many a time beforehand, will not be made 
in vain. I therefore confidently appeal to you to
-P-A-G-E-459
XVII TECHNICAL EDUCATION 451 
let those impulses once more have full sway, and 
not to rest until you have done something better 
and greater than has yet been done in this coun- 
try in the direction in which we are now going. 
I heartily thank you for the attention which you 
have been kind enough to bestow upon me. The 
practice of public speaking is one I must soon 
think of leaving off, and I count it a special and 
peculiar honour to have had the opportunity of 
speaking to you on this subject to-day.

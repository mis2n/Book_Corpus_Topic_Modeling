LAUGHTER 
CHAPTER I 
SOME VARIETIES OF LAUGHTER 
ANGER, like most human emotions, may result 
in many and diverse actions. An angry man 
may send his children to bed, cut off his son 
with a shilling, change his politics, bring a 
libel suit, write a satire or, reverting to the 
original and most instinctive manifestation of 
anger, black his neighbour’s eye. This orig- 
inal of all angry methods of attack is apparent 
in the single action of the animal when im- 
pelled by anger: the result of animal rage is 
usually an assault upon the offender. It is 
also written upon every human being at the 
moment of insult. The body of the angered 
man may be represented by his clenched fist, 
which is one characteristic expression of his 
emotion of anger. The extra supply of sugar 
with which anger floods his blood is typical— 
as his clenching fist is typical of the pose of his 
body—of an inward preparation for struggle. 
Struggle requires energy, and sugar supplies

  it. The anger diffuses an aggressive poise 
throughout his whole body, and a prepara- 
tion for physical attack is evident to the eye 
in outward manifestation and disclosed to 
inner physiological exploration. Many other 
aggressive responses to anger have developed 
from this original method of physical violence. 
Anger may be suppressed and it is an im- 
portant part of moral training to control it, 
but the single emotion of anger has obviously 
become connected with many and diverse 
actions. In anger there is one emotion and 
many manifestations of it. 
On turning from an examination of anger 
to an inspection of laughter the converse 
seems to be true. Each member of the row 
of laughers in Hogarth’s picture laughs differ- 
ently, but every laugh is essentially the same 
“ mechanical motion ”’, as “‘ dog’”’ is always 
the same word though written in different 
and-writings by twenty different people. 
‘This one characteristic bodily action of laugh- 
ing seems to be connected with many and 
diverse emotions or feelings. ‘‘ Emotion” or 
“ feeling ’’ may be intelligibly used to denote 
the conscious accompaniments of laughter 
without attempting to conform to accurate 
definitions of these terms.} 
As Diomedes stooped to strip his fallen foe 
of his armour Paris pierced his foot with an 
arrow. ‘Then Paris leaped to his feet and, 
“ sweetly laughing ’’, exulted over his enemy. 
2

SOME VARIETIES OF LAUGHTER 
“‘ Sweetly ”’ seems a strange adjective, for this 
| is the laughter of triumph—laughter in its 
most crude and brutal form. When Hezekiah 
desired to unite Israel and Judah in one great 
passover he made proclamation from Beer- 
sheba to Dan. ‘‘So the posts passed from 
city to city through the country of Ephraim 
and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they 
laughed them to scorn’’*. ‘There is laughter==<= 
of triumph and laughter of scorn; there is— 
also laughter of contempt, superiority, and— 
self-congratulation. When lovers laugh as 
they meet they are not contemptuous, nor are 
they amused. {The pure laughter of play, like 
the laughter of greeting, is as innocent of 
amusement as it is of contempt. The un- 
gracious varieties of laughter and the laughter 
of social delight in greeting and play are often 
forgotten becatise Heiman le ustiter is now so 
closely_associated with amusement. Amused 
laughter, with its characteristic and indefin- 
able sense of the ludicrous, is a third variety 
that frequently, in discussions on laughter, 
draws attention entirely on itself and blinds 
the mental eye to ungracious forms and 
laughter of social delight. When the sense of 
the ludicrous is pure and dispassionately free 
from either animus or sympathy, amused 
laughter is purelycomic. In humour sympathy 
blends with the sense of the ludicrous and 
laughter is transformed from the animosity of 
triumph or scorn into geniality and friendliness. 
S
-P-A-G-E-10
  SOME VARIETIES OF LAUGHTER 
Bergson’s contrast of humour as scientific 
satire with the oratorical satire of irony®* 
implies another definition for it than a sense 
of the ludicrous touched with sympathy. 
But the English tradition favours the dis- 
tinction between |comic laughter whose sym- 
that is genial and sympathetic.) Coleridge 
distinguished the “ pure, unmixed; ludicrous, 
or laughable” from ‘“‘the congeniality of 
humour with pathos ’”’‘ ; ‘ the comic ’’, wrote 
Meredith, differs ‘‘ from satire in not sharply 
driving into the quivering sensibilities, and 
from humour in not comforting them and 
tucking them up ”’ *, and Professor Saintsbury 
describes humour “as a feeling and presen- 
tation of the ludicrous including sympa- 
thetic, or at least meditative, transcendency”’ * 
Freud seems to admit the separation of humour 
from the purely comic through its sympathetic 
content by suggesting economy of thought 
as the essence of the latter and economy of 
feeling as the essence of the former’. There is 
authority, therefore, as well as justification 
through private observation, for distinguish- 
ing between the sympathetic laughter of 
humour and the pure amusement of the comic. 
The ungracious, delighted, and amused 
varieties of laughter do not always, or even 
usually, occur simple and unmixed. Amuse- 
ment may mingle with scorn, or contempt 
with amusement, and social delight may be

SOME VARIETIES OF LAUGHTER 
tinged with triumph. Some writers say that 
we are deceived by this mingling of emotions 
into overestimating the number of the varieties 
of laughter. When Coleridge wrote “to 
resolve laughter into an expression of con- 
tempt is contrary to fact, and laughable 
enough ’’*, he hinted that laughter is never 
anti-sympathetic and contains no ungracious 
forms. Mr Max Eastman makes this hint 
explicit. He urges the dismissal at the outset 
of scorn and its disagreeable children—in- 
cluding sarcasm, commends Voltaire for affirm- 
ing the incompatibility of laughter with con- 
tempt and indignation, and condemns the 
first analysts who “confused laughter with 
the act of scoffing’’. Whenever ungracious 
or unsympathetic elements appear they are 
pollutions of laughter, not part of it.» Thus 
from the three previous classes of laughter he 
excludes the first, the ungracious or anti- 
sympathetic class, leaving the second class 
of social delight, and the third class of amused. 
laughter. His theory of laughter restricts it 
to the social delight of greeting or play and 
the sense of the ludicrous. Professor 
M°Dougall restricts further by ignoring all 
non-amusing forms and defining laughter 
as ‘‘an instinct of aberrant type’ that 
is “accompanied by an emotional excite- 
ment of specific quality, the quality that is 
best called ‘amusement’’’*. This extreme 
testriction sharply contrasts two possible 
3  
-P-A-G-E-12
    SOME VARIETIES OF LAUGHTER 
estimates of laughter. Laughter may have 
one characteristic emotion, the sense of the 
ludicrous, and its other varieties may be 
apparent only because other emotions mingle 
into its proper emotion. Or it may, as a 
converse of anger with its single emotion 
and many actions, have one action of body 
and many, perhaps very many, emotions. 
Any advance in knowledge can, from one 
point of view, be described as a progressive 
disclosure under scrutiny, as a white patch 
far distant up the road divides, as it approaches 
the observer, into a flock of sheep and as each 
member of the flock, on nearer approach or 
on closer observation, reveals its value as wool 
or mutton. There has been much thinking 
and much writing on laughter, but its pro- 
gressive disclosure of itself to scrutiny has 
been, admittedly, very small. This reluct- 
ance of laughter to disclose its own nature 
increases the importance of holding firmly to 
what can be known. The decision between 
singleness and multiplicity in laughter which 
study meets at the outset cannot be dog- 
matically or assuredly made. But, since it 
does seem possible to discover some elements 
in laughter, though they may be few, that 
favour its multiple nature, it seems to be wise 
method to assume at the beginning a con- 
nection between the act of laughing and a 
variety of emotions. As the argument pro- 
ceeds on this preliminary assumption it will 
6
-P-A-G-E-13
  SOME VARIETIES OF LAUGHTER 
be found to include still more kinds of laughter 
than have been already described. These 
further varieties of laughter seem to be as 
clearly different species as those included in 
the three classes so ruthlessly reduced to one 
single kind by Professor M*Dougall. If there 
are many ways of laughing these seemingly 
additional species are of them. If the final 
decision falls on singleness for laughter they 
will be condemned as false appearances along 
with all ungracious laughing and even, if 
Professor M*Dougall has his way, along with 
the laughter of greeting or of play. Con- 
gruency with the facts of laughter, so far as 
these can be discovered, must ultimately decide 
between the rival hypotheses. If the monistic 
view of laughter, as M*Dougall’s theory may 
be conveniently called, most adequately co- 
ordinates the facts and estimates of them, 
it will prevail. If Eastman’s concession of 
one or two extra varieties to laughter 
co-ordinates most adequately, his modestly 
pluralistic theory will prevail over M*Dougall’s. 
If the freely pluralistic estimate, as it may be 
called to contrast it with the monistic, is 
more adequate than the other two, it will 
prevail over them both. It will be assumed 
here that there are many laughters: laughters 
of triumph, of scorn and contempt, of super- 
iority, of self-congratulation, of play, of 
greeting, and of amusement, which includes 
pure comic perception of the ludicrous and

humour with sympathy. Other varieties will 
be involved in the connection of these with 
the fundamental facts of laughter. The 
following chapters will present laughter in 
terms of the hypothesis that it has had, and 
still has, many varieties. No dogmatism is 
intended, for laughter eludes all dogmatism 
and laughs at it, but an attempt is simply 
made to identify some features of human 
laughter and to connect them consistently.

CHAPTER II 
THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
THE traditional sourness of the dwarf, or 
misshapen person, is, when properly under- 
stood, anindex of the humanization of laughter. 
Since men suit their conduct to their treat- 
ment, habitual ridicule breeds temper in the 
ridiculed, and the dwarf of tradition was bitter 
because he was an object of merriment. The 
passing of this tradition, as sympathy replaces 
derision, marks a humanization in the occa- 
sions of men’s laughter. 
The lives of Sir Francis Bacon, Thomas 
Fuller, and Thomas Hobbes covered the 118 
years from 1561 to 1679, and these three 
writers thus represent the thought and habit 
of a period from 250 to 300 years before the 
present. They all revealed the mind of their 
times by recording the objects of men’s 
laughter. ‘‘ Deformity ’’ heads Bacon’s list™, 
and “‘infirmities’’ are emphasized by 
Hobbes". ‘“‘Infirmity”’ is used more widely 
than in a purely physical sense by Hobbes, 
but Fuller’s protest against beating “‘ a cripple 
9
-P-A-G-E-16
  THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
e with his own, crutches”? or mocking ‘a 
cobbler for his black thumbs ”’, in his chapter 
“ Of Jesting ’, implies that physical infirmi- 
ties were, in that age, recognized objects of 
mirth’. England in the seventeenth century 
simply continued a cruel habit of making 
merry over physical misfortunes. When the 
Philistine lords made sport of blind Samson * 
they were mocking an enemy, and revenge 
always stirs bitterness, but the glee of 
Olympus over the limping Hepheestus, as 
he bustled through the palace, doubtless 
represents the spirit in the laughter of the 
time, as Bacon, Fuller, and Hobbes repre- 
sent the spirit of theirs. This glee over 
physical infirmity is too evident in a survey 
of the past that reviews the occasions of 
men’s laughter for these instances not to | 
be typical. Human mirth has always been” 
easily aroused by the spectacle of physical 
infirmities. 
There is still such mirth, but, since deformity 
is no longer a legitimate object of laughter and 
among the highly civilized no longer provokes 
it, it is clear that laughter has been humanized. 
The growth of the sympathetic spirit has 
affected laughter, and, if there is an index to 
the progress of civilization, the degrees of 
failure in sympathy discovered when men 
laugh may provide it. The disappearance of 
physical infirmity as a recognized object of 
mirth intimates a wider spread and a deeper 
Io
-P-A-G-E-17
THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
planting of the spirit of sympathy. Man has 
become more humanized: his sympathies 
have moved with his civilization and his 
laughter has moved with both. 
Ungraciousness and spite have been too 
prevalent and too persistent in laughter to be 
only pollutions of it.. A survey of the occa- 
sions of laughter in the past suggests that men 
never have laughed and never will except at 
some form of humiliation. Though highly 
civilized men may no longer laugh at some 
misfortunes, such as physical infirmity, they 
seem to some who have made this survey 
only to have restricted the anti-sympathetic 
elements in their laughter without any posi- 
tive introduction of sympathy. It is possible 
to over-emphasize that the ancients ‘‘ were 
impressed with the sane and wholesome 
humour of superiority’’**. The Greek war- 
riors “ laughed lightly’ when Thersites bowed 
and wept under the staff of Odysseus, for they 
were pleased that a prater had been silenced. 
But Homer hints at humanization by adding 
“though they were sorry’’?7. Nor must we 
forget that Plato would not permit ridicule of 
citizens, even without anger’*. But malignity, 
contempt, and the stroke of superiority per- 
vaded ancient laughter. When Socrates cited 
the impotent as natural objects of laughter 
his citation was more incidental than the 
_ deliberate citations of Bacon and Hobbes, 
and when he mentioned pleasant laughter, 
II
-P-A-G-E-18
  THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
made tart by envy, at the follies of friends, 
he was not analysing mirth?®, But his 
selection of occasions for laughter is signi- 
ficant. Plato clearly considered laughter to~ 
be an inferior thing, for, though the serious 
man must understand laughable things if he 
would understand serious matters, he should 
leave the ridiculous to slaves and hired stran- 
gers?°, and jests ‘ which you would be ashamed 
to make yourself ’’ touch “a principle within 
which is disposed to raise a laugh”. He 
feared immoderate laughter in the guardians 
of his State and would suffer no Homeric de- 
scription of laughter among the blessed gods 
as they watched the bustling Hepheestus*. 
Glee among gods over deformity shocked Plato, 
and doubtless the frequent cruelty and con- 
stant hardness in ancient laughter determined 
his disparagement of comedy and the ludicrous. 
Thus Plato’s depreciation of laughter is a 
witness to its constant ungraciousness in the 
pre-Christian world and all amusement seemed 
to him toybe too hard for penetration by human 
sympathy. 
Since Mr Lloyd speaks of the ‘‘ humour of 
superiority’ and thinks the humorist can 
always appeal safely to this sentiment**, he 
may have a similar opinion about the laughter 
of the Christian world. Perhaps, for there is 
no exact science of laughter and no accepted 
precision in terms, he merely does not assign 
the name “humour” exclusively to sympa- 
12
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
thetic laughter. He rightly recognizes the 
persistence of the aggressive element in the 
pervasive sense of the ludicrous—which he 
always calls “humour.” ‘The smiting of 
Thersites, the limping of Hephzstus, and the 
comedy of Aristophanes doubtless do appeal 
to the sense of physical superiority which 
survives in the “humour” of competitive 
races. Lashing imposture and exposing hypo- 
crisy no doubt still appeal to the French. 
The exposure of dignity in déshabillé, it may 
be added, or the shattering of pretensions, by 
ridicule, is still sure of a laugh. 
As laughter emerges with man from the 
mists of antiquity it seems to hold a dagger 
in its hand. There is enough brutal triumph, 
enough contempt, and enough striking down 
from superiority in the records of antiquity 
and in its estimates of laughter to presume 
that original laughter may have been wholly 
animosity. If this were so, as will appear in 
the sequel, it probably contained from the 
first, at least, the germ of future kindliness. 
But there is an unquestionable brutality in 
the ancestry of laughter. It is tempting to 
discover a survival of this original brutality 
in the publics, the audiences collected at 
popular entertainments, of western civiliza- 
tions. Mr Max Beerbohm may be too un- 
sympathetic towards crowds to be perfectly 
discerning when he finds |‘‘two elements in 
the public’s humour: delight in suffering,~ 
13
-P-A-G-E-20
  THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
contempt for the unfamiliar” *. Socrates 
once stood up when Aristophanes represented 
him on the stage and Mr Eastman’s remark 
that Athenian humour was probably more 
exuberant than hostile** may carry a 
correction of the Beerbohm opinion. Though 
crowds, like individuals, constantly incline to 
laugh derisively, they should probably be 
- credited with more sympathetic laughter 
than Mr Max Beerbohm allows to them. 
Children, who hint at the history of their 
race without repeating it precisely, seem to 
disclose the original and persistent unkind- 
ness in laughter. If Mr Beerbohm is rightly 
suspected of injustice to publics, he may also 
be suspected of injustice to children: it is 
natural, he says, for the unsophisticated 
public to laugh gleefully at suffering and 
contemptuously at the unfamiliar, because it 
will laugh as children laugh**. Nor, even 
though children are convicted of deficiency 
in a sense of the comic, is their laughter 
necessarily convicted of delight in suffer- 
ing. Freud * thinks they do lack feeling for 
the comic, and Mr St John Lucas agrees with 
him, though mainly, apparently, because he 
was a serious boy himself**. But, though 
children are unkind laughers neither because 
an essayist says they are nor because their 
laughter must be unkind since it has little 
sense of the ludicrous, statistical inquiry seems 
to be against them. Dr Kimmins noted the 
14
-P-A-G-E-21
THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
element of superiority in “ children’s sense of 
humour” and at nine years old a pleasure 
in ridicule of the school-inspector. It is 
perhaps significant that when the child’s 
appreciation of the comic falls off from eleven 
to thirteen, after increasing up to eleven, the 
element of superiority is exaggerated?’?. The 
appearance of unkindness as laughter begins, 
and as appreciation of the comic temporarily 
wanes, suggests the primacy of scorn and 
contempt in human mirth. 
The hint in the laughter of the child, and 
perhaps in the laughter of the crowd, that 
unsympathetic 6t anti-sympathetic laughter 
preceded the humorous is realized in history. 
Laughter has steadily become, though with 
many a fluctuation, more gracious, genial, 
and kindly. This steady tendency towards 
humour from less gracious forms is reflected 
in a contrast between the older and some of the 
modern theories of laughter. A sense of the 
humanization of laughter, of its modern 
growth towards the humorous, is apparent in 
this contrast. Since a full survey of theories 
of laughter would be tedious if not impossible, 
a representative of the old must be chosen to 
contrast with a representative of the new. 
Whether their theories are right or wrong, 
these two representatives will be found, in one 
point of contrast between their estimates of 
laughter, to intimate a sense that laughter has 
been humanized. 
15
-P-A-G-E-22
  THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
The choice of the first representative falls 
almost inevitably on Thomas Hobbes. His 
definition of laughter is one of the most famous 
in the history of thought, and he sufficiently 
represents the anti-sympathetic estimate of 
laughter, once almost universal and _ still 
widely held, to point a contrast. with the 
modern sympathetic estimate. The ‘ sudden 
glory ” with which he identified the ‘“ passion 
of laughter ’’ felicitously expresses the warm 
flush of emotion as laughter floods the soul. 
It arises from a “ sudden conception of some 
eminency in ourselves’: identifying laughter 
with self-congratulatory superiority. It is 
born in unkindness, for this sense of eminency 
comes ‘‘ by comparison with the infirmities 
of others’. Hobbes almost stirs us to com- 
punction at choosing him to represent derision 
theories by immediately adding that “ men 
laugh at the follies of themselves past, when 
they come suddenly to remembrance, except 
they bring with them any present dishonour ” 
He also contemplates non-derisive laughter 
when he thinks laughter may be “ without 
offence” if it is ‘“‘at the absurdities and 
infirmities abstracted from persons’’**. Many 
writers haye estimated laughter as more 
essentially derisive than Hobbes. But he can 
be spokesman for anti-sympathetic theories, 
though he attributes less vindictiveness to the 
laugh than many of the many whom he 
represents. “ The many” can be used very 
16
-P-A-G-E-23
  
THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
advisedly, for an anti-sympathetic estimate of 
laughter was widespread both before and after 
he wrote. It persists still: intimidation by 
humiliation is for Bergson the function of 
laughter2*. However the theory of Hobbes is 
described, as ‘‘ derision ’’, which is doubtfully 
just, as “superiority’”’ or “ self-congratula- 
tory’’, it depends laughter upon unsympathetic 
or anti-sympathetic impulses. 
Hobbes emphasized the structure or 
mechanism of laughter; modern theories 
emphasize its function. He told us what 
laughter is ; Professor M*Dougall tells us what 
laughter does. But this difference of em- 
phasis does not conceal another significant 
contrast. According to Hobbes men laugh~ 
when they have too little sympathy ; accord- | 
ing to M*Dougall they laugh to avoid having ° 
too much. Sympathy tends to become too 
sensitive, and if it is not corrected minor 
mishaps would stir men too easily. So, when 
a member of the old Parliament sat down on 
his hat, his fellow-members laughed instead 
of condoled. ‘‘ Minor”? mishaps may be 
minor absolutely or minor relatively. They 
may be too inconsiderable to need sympathy, 
or too remote from the observer in time, space, 
and circumstance to secure it. Sometimes 
the mishap ought not to receive sympathy : 
the ruffling of senatorial dignity may be good 
physic. When wit exposes folly, laughter may 
be a better medicine than condolence. ‘Thus 
17 B  
-P-A-G-E-24
  THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
“laughter is primarily and fundamentally the 
antidote of sympathetic pain’, and _ its 
“biological function” is ‘defence of the 
organism against the many minor pains to 
which man is exposed by reason of the high 
sensitivity of his primitive sympathetic 
tendencies.”’ *° 
If laughter has been progressively human- 
ized, it is natural to discover a keener sense 
of the connection between laughter and sym- 
pathy in the recent than in the older writer. 
M°Dougall notes that we can laugh at “ our 
dearest friend” and simultaneously “ sin- 
cerely condole with him’. The difference 
between Hobbes, who thought that we 
laugh because we are not sympathetic, and 
M°Dougall, who thinks that we laugh because 
we incline to sympathize too much, marks a 
sense of the humanization of laughter. A 
modern writer like Eastman is amusing in his 
perplexity over Hobbes and his followers. 
He cannot understand unsympathetic or anti- 
sympathetic theories. There need be no 
perplexity if Hobbes lived in a less sympathetic 
age than the present. Laughter has responded 
to the growth of sympathy and become more 
sympathetic itself. A survey of laughter and 
a comparison of estimates of its nature show 
that it has steadily tended to become less 
contemptuous and more sympathetic. If we 
arrange laughters in a series, from triumph or 
scorn to a sympathetic sense of the ludicrous, 
18
-P-A-G-E-25
  
THE HUMANIZATION OF LAUGHTER 
that series represents a steady humanization 
into humour, which is the constant goal of 
civilization and the final achievement of 
laughter. 
If there are many laughters and if there has 
been evolution among them they probably 
contain a fundamental element. The ground- 
plan of laughter, the primary situation in 
which laughter always arises, does not seem 
to be far to seek. Most theories of laughter 
have recognized it in some form, though its 
full significance is not always appreciated. 
There is an element in all laughter that seems 
obvious, productive of its varieties and natur- 
ally connected with its growth in sympathy. 
It does not remove all enigmas from laughter, 
nor complete explanation, but it does make 
laughter partly intelligible. This element 
needs no great analytical skill to expose it nor 
arduous reflection to perceive it, for it is 
simply the familiar, and even obtrusive, 
element of relief.

  CHAPTER III 
LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
Asout fifty years ago two companion prints 
hung in many houses on opposite walls or 
cheek by jowl. They were long and narrow, 
and each represented a row of children in 
school. ‘The dux sat at one end and the dunce, 
wearing the traditional cap, stood on a stool 
at the other. The remaining scholars sat 
between them, presumably in the order of 
what would now be called their coefficients 
of intelligence. In one picture the children 
bent seriously over their task—even the dunce 
kept his eyes on his book. Underneath this 
picture was printed ‘The Frown”. In the 
companion-picture the same row of children, 
from dux to dunce, sat, or stood, cheerfully 
and at ease. Underneath this picture was 
printed ‘The Smile”. A single glance at 
the two prints appreciated a fundamental 
element in laughter. The observer felt the 
change from those tense, studious bodies 
to these cheerful, relaxed urchins, and ex- 
perienced, almost as if he sat in the smiling 
20

LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
tow, the burst of relief as the teacher 
smiled. 
Laughter has been so pervaded by a sense 
Cof the ludicrous that sheer unsophisticated 
“) laughter of pure relief is seldom untinged by 
“amusement. Washington Irving was wakened 
on Christmas morning by little voices singing 
carols outside his chamber-door. When he 
looked out the little group of children became 
mute, and each child shyly hung its head. 
Then, of one accord, they scampered down the 
corridor and Irving heard them laughing as 
they turned the corner*. This little incident 
almost catches the sense of the ludicrous in 
the act of birth from a situation of relief, 
for the children laughed\ first because their 
fears had relaxed and only secondarily be- 
cause they were amused. In the evolution 
of laughter—so this little incident prompts 
us to surmise—amusement has insinuated 
itself into situations of relief. It began with 
mild insinuation, so the surmise runs, and has 
ended by taking over laughter as its special 
province. But the dominance of laughter by 
the sense of the ludicrous is not complete 
enough to obliterate either the many laughters 
into which amusement merely mingles or those 
into which it does not enter at all. 
To the ungracious laughters from triumph 
to mild superiority,|the laughters of greeting 
and of play and laughter at the ludicrous, which 
may be purely comic or sympathetically 
2r
-P-A-G-E-28
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
humorous, must be added the sheer laughter 
of relief. ‘‘ At the sacrificial altar, during the 
Roman festival of the Lupercalia, two young 
men would be touched with a bloody knife, 
and, when the blood had been wiped from 
their foreheads with a handful of wool dipped 
in milk, the ritual required that they should 
laugh”. This was, doubtless, a dwindled 
ritual relic of a sacrifice in which the “ two 
young men’”’, or the victims they represented, 
were actually slain. Since the comic has no 
place in the solemnity of sacrificial ritual, 
laughter was estimated, and ritualistically 
required, as an expression of relief. Laughter 
was estimated, it should be noted, as relief, 
or as an index of it. “I couldn’t help but 
laugh’’, said a spectator of the anguish of 
women who were seeking news of shipwrecked. 
men at a London dock, and soldiers have 
laughed ‘‘ when a shell took off a comrade’s 
hand”’**. The sheer relief of such events, 
whether in the participator who escapes in 
person or in the observer who watches a peril 
that passes him touch others, marks a distinct 
species of laughter. Often, when laughter is 
less sheerly pure relief, a situation of relief is 
clearly its origin. The soliloquizer in the 
churchyard, ‘‘ reading the various inscriptions, 
and moralizing on them with that kind of 
levity, which will not infrequently spring up 
in the mind, and in the midst of deep melan- 
choly ”’, wondered jestingly ‘‘ where be all the 
22
-P-A-G-E-29
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
bad people buried” **. The jest often appears 
as an interloper in the midst of seriousness 
when the tension temporarily falls and then 
announces its own birth from a relaxation of 
the spirit. The passing of crisis prepares a 
path for laughter: during the annular eclipse 
of October 1919 the Gold Coast natives fled 
trembling to their huts; when it was over 
they laughed at their own fears*. These 
transitions from relief to amusement, where 
the transition is obvious enough to suggest 
the genesis of the sense of the ludicrous, hint 
at an original laughter of pure relief. A 
woman who was caught in machinery and 
just saved from mutilation or death, threw 
herself on a table and laughed. She laughed 
from impulse and the discharged Lupercalian 
victims laughed by instruction, which perhaps 
also touched an impulse to laugh from relief 
and was doubtless based on it, but they all 
laughed for the same reason. That reason 
was liberation from danger, and a sheer sense 
of relief is one clearly distinguishable, and 
perhaps the most fundamental, emotional 
accompaniment of laughter. 
Relief is written legibly on many varieties 
of laughter: on triumph, with its exultant 
pause after consummated struggle ; on scorn, 
which contains contempt for a futile menace ; 
on superiority with its easy assurance that its 
victim is no serious rival. It is written, 
though perhaps less legibly, on the laughter 
23
-P-A-G-E-30
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
of greeting. Two human beings cannot meet 
neutrally, for each calls upon the other to 
meet a social situation. In prehistoric days, 
and perhaps long after, there was always a 
possible menace in a meeting, and a subdued 
menace is still present ina doubtfulness over 
the conduct required for the interview. A 
preparedness for eventualities, a hesitancy 
about the character of the interviewed, a 
constraint naturally arising from uncertainty, 
suffuse the interviewer. When friend meets 
friend the social tension rises only to fall and 
telief passes quickly into laughter or smiling : 
friends, according to Penjon**, experience an 
increase of liberty when they meet. The more 
formal greetings between strangers intimate 
uncertainty about one another and contrast 
with the greater familiarity between friends. 
The laughter of greeting is part of this famil- 
iarity, which, like all familiarity, decreases 
constraint. ‘The relief in the laughter of play 
is written all over children as they escape 
from school. 
Relief is too unmistakable in most laughter 
that is free from amusement or only tinged 
by it to be unobserved. It is evident also 
in a survey of the comic and the humorous. 
A workman engaged in blasting operations 
dallied too long and went up with the charge. 
As the unfortunate man went upwards, the 
foreman drew out his notebook. When the 
workman received his week’s pay a sum 
24
-P-A-G-E-31
LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
corresponding to the time he had spent in 
the air was deducted from his wage. The 
beginning of this story makes a big call on 
sympathy and the end makes a small one. 
It is distressing to have even sixpence de- 
ducted from one’s wage, but it is much more 
distressing to be dashed into pieces. The 
sympathies rapidly collected for the major 
distress are suddenly required only for the 
minor, and relief clearly pervades the laughter 
that greets the story. 
A survey of the occasions of laughter 
discovers always, sometimes clearly, some- 
times less distinctly and sometimes, perhaps, 
with difficulty, but discovers always, the 
common element of relief. 
The relief written on all varieties of laughter 
is also written on its “ peculiar bodily re- 
actions”. Descriptions of the mechanics of 
laughter vary from snatch-phrases, through 
effective portraiture, to systematic and accur- 
ate analysis. The “ distortion of the counte- 
nance’”’, like the bush that denoted a wine-shop, 
is no more than an obvious “ sign ”’ of laughter, 
nor did Hobbes intend a physiological study *’. 
Bacon draws a more careful picture: “ laugh- 
ing causeth a dilatation of the mouth and lips ; 
a continued expulsion of the breath, with a 
loud noise, which maketh the interjection of 
laughing ; shaking of the breasts and sides ; 
running of the eyes with water, if it be violent 
and continued’’*:. Leigh Hunt * particularly 
25
-P-A-G-E-32
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
describes how “the breath recedes only to 
reissue with double force’’ and summarizes 
the rest as a ‘‘ happy convulsion’’. The details 
of this “ happy convulsion ’’, as Bacon supplies 
them and as Darwin has carefully studied 
them ‘°, can be ignored in favour of the “ con- 
tinued expulsion of the breath’’, the rapid 
succession of breathing in and breathing out 
that indicates the essential significance of 
the mechanics of laughter. Sully“ empha- 
sizes the deepening of inspiration and breaking 
up of expiration. If laughter is regarded as 
an enhanced giggle or magnified titter, to 
which it constantly descends, its significance 
is plain. We hold our breath, or draw it in, 
to prepare for effort ; when we abandon effort 
we let our breath out. ‘The titter or giggle 
draws and lets with constant alternation, and 
the laugh does the same more vigorously. A 
sudden call for effort and a sudden call off 
are repeated in rapid alternation during the 
explosions of laughing. Now this is simply 
a periodic expression of relief: a call upon 
effort being apparent as ‘‘ the breath recedes ” 
and a call off in its “‘ reissue with double force’. 
Milton’s ‘laughter holding both his sides’”’ ex- 
presses in terse, palpable summary the relieved 
effort of laughter *. 
An Irishman might say of laughter that it 
does something without doing anything. The 
body prepares for action and then, since effort 
is cut short, expends its preparation on itself: 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  
LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
“the happy convulsion” is a spill-way for 
gathered energy, as Herbert Spencer perce- 
ived. This expenditure of summoned energy 
upon itself by the convulsed body, which is 
more external in visible ‘‘ mechanical motion ’”’, 
seems to extend through the whole organism. 
Every call upon the body for action prepares 
it internally for effort by ‘‘ energizing secre- 
tions.” Anger, which poises the body for a 
blow and prepares it internally for struggle, is 
typical of any call for action, and the extra 
sugar that it stimulates into the blood is 
typical of all such internal preparation. The 
call for action with which the situation result- 
ing in laughter begins increases the sugar in 
the blood. This sugar, and the other asso- 
ciated secretions, supply an extra source of 
energy. When action is called off this extra 
store of energy producers would remain in the 
body and become, since unrequired, waste 
products. These waste products would clog 
the body, which would be like a fire with too 
much fuel. Laughter, therefore, Dr Crile 
suggests, substitutes for action by the body 
action of or in the body and thus consumes the 
“energizing secretions’. This substitu- 
tionary role of laughter explains the some- 
what puzzling repetitiveness in laughing. An 
action has been prepared for and an action 
must occur if waste products are not to clog 
the body, so laughter continually rehearses 
the situation of calling on and calling off to 
27
-P-A-G-E-34
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
provide a physical exercise that will use up the 
sugar and its associates. If laughter is such a 
transference from an external to an internal 
gymnastic and, physiologically, a clearance of 
unnecessary substances, it is as obviously de- 
termined by relief in this aspect as it is in its 
aspect of respiration. Relaxation by inter- 
rupted effort is written on the repetitive inter- 
ruption of inspiration and on the sweepingaway 
of sugar which is no longer needed. 
Thus laughter is an action diverted from its 
original intention of affecting persons or 
things outside the body and directed exclu- 
sively upon the body itself. It responds to a 
call for action that is quickly called off, and 
expends a preparation for effort upon the body 
because it has become otherwise useless. The 
relief thus immanent in the act of laughing 
stands out sharply when contrasted with the 
act of crying. Crying, like laughing, “is 
primarily an act of the respiratory muscles” * : 
sobbing may be summarily described as 
sorrowful tittering or a giggle as a glad sob. 
An action called on and then called off is 
apparent in the spasmodic breathing of both. 
But, in crying, action is called: off because it 
is futile, and in laughter because it is not 
needed. ‘Thus, though the two are akin and, 
as has often been noted, pass readily into one 
another, crying is sorrowful because endeavour 
is vain and laughter is joyful because effort is 
telaxed. In its visible aspect, in its physio- 
28
-P-A-G-E-35
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
logical function, and in its contrast with 
weeping, laughter is plainly and obviously 
an expression of relief. 
Relief is the constitutive element in the 
physical act of laughing: laughter, physio- 
logically, releases the body from a necessity 
for exertion and relieves it of secretions. The 
characteristic emotion of one variety of 
laughter seems to be a pure sense of relief. 
In many other varieties relief is too obvious 
in the associated emotions to be mistaken. 
When it is less obvious it can still be observed. 
An element so pervasive of laughter, so deeply 
penetrative into many of its varieties and so 
characteristic of its physical expression, can 
hardly be other than the common, funda- 
mental ground-plan of all laughters, the 
centre or source from which they all spring. 
The relief characteristic of laughter is not 
a long period of ease but a sharp withdrawal 
of ademand. ‘ Merriment ”’, wrote Dr John- 
son, ‘“‘is always the effect of a sudden im- 
pression ”’ ¢*, and it would be tedious to cata- 
logue the insistences of eminent writers, from 
the “ sudden glory ”’ of Hobbes till now, upon 
the suddenness in laughter. In laughter there 
is a psychical shock, which Dr Johnson dis- 
cerned in ‘‘ the pleasures of the mind”. All 
mental pleasures, he said, ‘‘ imply something 
sudden and unexpected ’’, and it is certainly 
true of the delight derived from a sense of the 
ludicrous that ‘‘ what is perceived by slow 
29
-P-A-G-E-36
   
   LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
degrees . . . will never strike with the sense 
of pleasure’ *”. A joke may dawn upon the 
mind, but laughter ensues at the decisive 
moment of perception when obtuseness is 
sharply succeeded by insight. The satisfaction 
of sheer relief is sudden, and triumph bursts 
into laughter with the stroke of success. 
Suddenness pervades all laughter, for it is an 
essential element in its fundamental quality 
of relief. 
The members of the world of life do not 
develop into one another in single file: they 
occur in groups springing from common 
centres and not in one simple series like the 
numbers I to 100. Differently specializing 
animals develop out of a generalized type**. 
The primitive four-limbed animal had mobile, 
propellent limbs. An ordinary water-newt, 
clambering over obstacles at the bottom of its 
tank or climbing up aquatic plants, approxi- 
mates to and represents, though it is not 
identical with, the central generalized form 
from which the variously specializing four- 
limbed animals developed. The horse has 
converted each limb into a stable prop and 
an aid to swift movement: it has sacrificed 
all other advantages to standing, walking, 
or running. Some monkeys, instead of ac- 
quiring four legs, have acquired four arms 
with hands. Man has two legs and two hands. 
The horse sacrificed mobility, or reaching, 
stretching, and grasping power, to stability ; 
30 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
the four-handed monkeys kept all their limbs 
mobile and man has reserved two limbs for 
stability and two for mobility. From a leg- 
less and handless ancestor, with four poten- 
tial legs or arms ending in hands, different 
animals developed which specialized differently 
in realizing the primitive potentiality. The 
horse, four-handed monkeys, and man are 
only three lines of development out of many 
that radiated from the original centre. ‘The 
completeness of specialization into leg and 
arm and the mode of distributing functions 
among all four limbs varied from group to 
group of specializing animals‘*. ‘This radia- 
tion in lines of growth from an original source 
is constantly repeated in the world of life. The 
appearance presented by a flight of shooting 
stars is a natural diagram of this constantly 
repeated plan of growth. All the stars in one 
flight appear to stream from one radiant point, 
and animals and plants constantly do in reality 
what the stars, which actually move in parallel 
paths, seem to the eye to do. 
The varieties of laughter probably conform 
with this plan, with relief as their common 
source. Triumphant laughter need not be 
the lineal ancestor of humour, though both 
have a common origin. A directness of 
ancestry between the laughters of triumph 
and humour was implied by George Eliot : 
“Strange as the genealogy may sound, the 
original parentage of that wonderful and . 
31
-P-A-G-E-38
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
delicious mixture of fun, fancy, philosophy, 
and feeling which constitutes modern humour 
was probably the cruel mockery of a savage 
at the writhings of a suffering enemy” °°. 
The “ genealogy’ need not be rejected be- 
cause it is ‘‘strange’’, for it is characteristic 
of all life to grow away from its source. An 
oak very successfully conceals its birth from 
an acorn—who, if he were shown an oak and 
an acorn for the first time and were ignorant 
of the growth of plants, would believe they 
were parent and child? ‘The brutality in 
crude, barbarous laughter of battle-triumph 
could soften into the sympathy of humour, 
though the laughters of triumph, scorn, and 
other ungracious forms may not stand in a 
simple step-by-step series with the laughters 
containing a sense of the ludicrous. For, 
however the relationship between brutal and 
sympathetic laughters is conceived, whether 
as linear or radiate from a centre, there is an 
obvious connection between the humanization 
historically evident in laughter and the funda- 
mental element of relief. Laughter has been 
responsive to the growth of human sympathy, 
and it has been responsive because its relief 
has enabled it to respond. 
Triumphant laughter is exultant because 
the foe is beaten and no further stroke is 
needed. Scornful laughter feels safe in the 
presence of an impotent threat. Assured 
victory or the certainty of it if a despised 
32
-P-A-G-E-39
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
threat passes into action prompts to a con- 
temptuous mercy. Since laughter, when it 
springs from triumph, is a blow cut short, a 
stroke diverted from an enemy and expended 
pleasantly upon self, it tends, as Sydney 
Smith remarked, to diminish hatred, as per- 
spiration diminishes heat™. Anger and all 
aggressive emotions appear in the human 
being tense for action and remain till the 
final stroke is made; they perish naturally 
in the relief of laughter when there is no need 
to strike and aggression is at an end. The 
ending of aggression, which is a necessary con- 
sequence of laugher, does not necessarily 
purge the laughter of all hostility nor result 
in prompt sympathy. But it obviously pro- 
vides an opportunity for sympathy to enter. 
The contemptuous mercy of the exultant and 
laughing conqueror is not the rich sympathy 
of humour, but it is an earnest of the possi- 
bility inherent in the nature of laughter that 
has been realized in its humanization. Relief, 
by cutting short the hostile act and breaking 
in upon the hostile mood, is a step towards 
sympathy. According to the Samkhya 
system of Indian philosophy we secure results 
by removing obstacles, as we fill a bath by 
turning a tap. Animus is the constant 
obstacle to sympathy, and the relief of 
laughter tends to remove it. Sympathy, as 
its progressive humanization of laughter re- 
veals, has constantly flowed in through the 
33 c  
-P-A-G-E-40
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
interruption of animus by relief until the 
“humorous writer ’’, in the words of Thack- 
eray, “professes to awaken and direct your 
love, your pity, your kindness—your scorn 
for untruth, pretension, imposture—your 
tenderness for the weak, the poor, the op- 
pressed, the unhappy ” *. 
Paradoxically, animus lingers in the laugh 
for the same reason that it leaves it. Most 
writers appreciate this persistent clinging of 
relics of animus to laughter. The more brutal 
laughters, though they exist yet, have receded 
before the more sympathetic, but laughter is 
still, as it may always be, a gratification of 
the sense of superiority and an effective social 
discipline. This double tendency in laughter 
to extend and withdraw sympathy is described 
by Sydney Smith in two nearly successive 
estimates: laughter reduces hatred but ‘“‘ the 
object of laughter is always inferior to us” 
and the sense of the humorous is incompatible 
with tenderness and respect*. Thackeray 
interpolates ‘scorn for untruth, pretension, 
imposture’”’ between the love, pity, and 
kindness aroused by “‘ the humorous writer ”’ 
and the ‘‘ tenderness for the weak, the poor, 
the oppressed, the unhappy ’”’ he promotes: 
animus creeps in and out of laughter to suit 
the occasion. Sydney Smith, if his estimates 
of humour are collated, seems to think of it 
as restricted animus. ‘‘ Incongruities which 
excite laughter generally produce a feeling of 
34
-P-A-G-E-41
LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
contempt for the person at whom we laugh ” : 
there is always some animus in amusement. 
But violent animus ruins laughter: ‘‘ con- 
tempt verges on anger, and the humorous is 
at an end’’*. A sense of this restricted 
animus appears in Bain’s opinion of “ a sudden 
stroke of superiority’ as one of the most 
certain ‘‘ causes of the outburst of laughter ”’ *¢ 
and continues, with the degree of restriction 
more or less severely estimated, in many 
modern theories of laughter. Less leniently, 
Bergson establishes a somewhat higher degree 
of animus in laughter by dubbing it “social 
ragging ’’ and convicting it of ‘an unavowed. 
intention to humiliate ”’ *’. 
The restricted animus of laughter, according 
to Bergson, is applied as social discipline to 
punish human beings for acting like machines, 
or atitomata, instead of meeting circumstance 
with plasticity and initiative, as living beings 
should. The laughable element is ‘‘ mechani- 
cal inelasticity’’; absent-mindedness and 
eccentricity are restrained by the “ social 
gesture ”’ called laughter ; human actions are 
ludicrous in an exact proportion to their 
simulation of machinery. Imitation is amus- 
ing, and two like faces are ludicrous because 
both suggest a manufacturing process. Cere- 
monial has a latent comic element ; Jack-in- 
the-Box and Punch and Judy arouse laughter 
because puppets pretend to be living; “the 
ludicrous in events may be defined as absent- 
35
-P-A-G-E-42
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
mindedness in things’’. Inadvertence is one 
main source of the comic, and parody, de- 
gradation, exaggeration, unsociability provoke 
laughter, which always “indicates a slight 
revolt on the surface of social life” and 
intimidates by humiliation *. Bergson selects 
one obvious function of laughter to make it 
sole and exclusive. Eccentricity reigns in 
Bedlam, Sydney Smith noted, because the 
eccentrics are undeterred by each other’s 
laughter**. Few would dissent from the 
dictum that ‘As a means of preserving the 
customary, the conventional, whether in dress, 
habits, or ordinary usages of society, laughter 
stands unrivalled’’, or that it confirms a 
conservatism which is, up to a point, an 
indispensable instinct for safety °°. Now this 
disciplinary role of laughter, evident, admitted 
by all writers, and partly responsible for the 
belief that laughter always contains a restricted 
animus, depends, as directly as the humaniza- 
tion of laughing, upon the element of relief. 
Flogging castigates with a blow and gaol 
castigates by confining freedom, but laughter 
castigates by its supercilious implication that 
the victim is worth neither a blow nor the 
trouble of confining. Thus the relief of 
laughter, in the very act of relaxing from 
aggression, hints at the foolishness or worth- 
lessness of the person laughed at and fills him 
with humiliation. This wound in the spirit 
is often said to pierce more keenly than a 
36 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  
LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
wound in the body: ridicule is often a thrice- 
pointed lance. Thus the paradox is true: the 
break in aggression that initiates laughter both 
opens a path for sympathy and perpetuates 
a sharp social discipline. 
The relief of laughter is the more clearly 
seen as a centre of growth the more completely 
laughter is known. Humanization and dis- 
ciplinary vigour spring from it, as the varieties 
of laughter seem to spring from an original 
laughter of sheer relief. The release of oppo- 
sites, like the tender sympathy of humour and 
the castigating contempt of disciplinary 
laughter, the movement of counteracting 
tendencies within the fundamental element of 
telief, is apparent in the mental sanity, 
geniality, and common sense conferred by 
laughter on the one hand and in the dangers 
of excess to which it exposes men on the other. 
The genial influence of laughter is too obvious 
to require emphasis, and its steadying effect 
on mental perspective is almost as evident. 
Resentment at the imputation of lack of 
humour is probably stirred in part by a sense 
of being imperfectly qualified for society by 
inability to join in one of its characteristic 
enjoyments and in part by the lack of insight 
that the imputation implies. If a sense of 
humour is the fixed associate of wisdom and 
implies common sense“, an accusation of 
deficiency in humour is an imputation of folly. 
If sensitiveness to incongruities is the core of 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
the ludicrous, comic or humorous perception 
is almost indispensable to sound judgment. 
Pomposity and dogmatism wane when men 
perceive the contrast between their own little 
pretensions and the greatness of the universe. 
A quiet humility descends when the fuss made 
by any individual is humorously contrasted 
with the cosmic placidity that ignores him. 
We cannot fit the universe, or any part of it, 
neatly together, as a clock-maker fits our 
watches ; we cannot assign man to his precise 
niche nor say exactly what he is nor what he 
should be; and humorous perception of the 
incongtuities in our muddled versions of 
things prevents us from suffering too acutely 
from our own failures and from presuming 
too much upon our own insight. Relief by 
laughter from the seriousness of life is a good 
thing, and its genial spread seems to be too 
great a boon to justify any warning. But 
laughter constantly tends to degenerate into 
“fun in Bagdad’’. Since Plato desired the 
tulers of his State to be sparing of laughter, 
many eminent warnings have been inspired 
by his fears. ‘‘ Persons’’, wrote Hartley, 
““who give themselves much to mirth, wit, 
and humour, must greatly disqualify their 
understandings for the search after truth” *. 
Sydney Smith, himself a wit, perceived the 
probable tendency of wit and humour to 
corrupt understanding and heart®. Thomas 
Fuller, before them, had wisely commended 
38
-P-A-G-E-45
  LAUGHTER OF RELIEF 
jesting where it was no “ master-quality ’” 
and. only “attended on other perfections”’ *. 
‘Tf the sense of the ridiculous is one side of 
an impressible nature, it is very well’’, wrote 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, adding “‘ but if that 
is all there is in a man, he had better have 
been an ape at once, and so have stood.at the 
head of his profession” *. There is a tendency 
to listen too eagerly for the jingle of the bells 
on the jester’s cap and to reward too highly 
those who make us laugh. It seems ungrac- 
ious to shake a warning head at eager, pleasant, 
genial laughter, but the very relaxation from 
which it springs is also an obvious possible 
source of permanently playful idleness. Nias 
hunters, when digging a pit, may not laugh 
or the sides of the pit will fall in‘*. Some 
taboos are founded on insight: laughter is 
essentially a desistance from effort, and may 
be fatally indulged. Socrates, on one occasion, 
doubtless by chance and without forethought, 
described the essential nature of all worthy 
laughter and its essential function. When 
Protarchus broke in with a laughing remark 
Socrates said: “A jest may sometimes 
pleasantly interrupt earnest’ *”. A pleasant 
interruption: that is exactly what laughter 
is! ‘Sometimes’: that is exactly when 
laughter should arise! ‘‘ Earnest’’: that is 
exactly whence the relief of laughter should 
come! Laughter is always a descent, and 
when it has descended from a higher level it

LAUGHTER a RELIEF 
will, if continued too long, sink lower and 
lower. For the permanent level to remain 
high, the descents of laughter must not be too 
frequent. “Laughter is open to perversion, 
like other good things’’, wrote Meredith ; 
“to laugh at everything is to have no appre- 
ciation of the Comic of Comedy ”’, and, quoting 
Landor, “ genuine humour and true wit require 
a sound and capacious mind, which is always 
a grave one’’*, | 
Relief, to summarize, is written on the 
physical act of laughing and on the phy- 
siological accompaniments. It is written on 
the occasions of laughter and, more or less 
plainly, on each of its varieties. A laughter of 
sheer relief may be the original source of all 
other laughters, which have spread from it 
like a sheaf. Humanization and social dis- 
cipline are connected with laughter through 
its relief: relief permits sympathy to enter 
by ending aggression and favours a restricted 
animus because withholding a blow can suggest 
contempt. The element of relief simultan- 
eously gives value to laughter and involves a 
tisk of degeneracy. 
Relief is not the whole of laughter, though 
it is its root and fundamental plan. The 
discovery of sudden interruption through 
relaxation of effort merely begins the inquiry 
into laughter. But it does begin it, and no 
discussion of laughter that ignores relief or 
makes it of little account can hope to prosper.

CHAPTER IV 
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
Tuat familiar nursery experience, old and 
always new, the tickle, has left its mark on 
the history of theories of laughter. Joubert, 
remarks Mr Eastman, was wise enough to 
know that “any true science of humour ”’ 
must include an explanation ‘‘ of our pleasure 
in tickling’ **. It obviously must, but the 
tickle must also not be too authoritative in 
dictating to us the nature of the ludicrous. 
The theories that took their cue from the 
tickle were, in the first place, too engrossed 
with the ludicrous to_see quite clearly into the 
nature of laughter.\ They also assumed too 
teadily that tickling is always pleasant and 
necessarily a droll occurrence. It is natural 
for theorists to approach laughter through 
amusement, or even to forget other varieties 
of laughter, because the sense of the ludicrous 
pervades laughter so freely, is prominent as a 
source of pleasure, and is so unique among the 
emotions. This engrossment with amuse- 
ment, however, exacts a penalty by blinding 
41
-P-A-G-E-48
PO rn et ee eee 
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
the inquirer to the light thrown upon comic 
and humorous laughter by other forms. It 
is, perhaps, equally natural to disregard the 
serious side of tickling, since the nursery tickle 
is more familiar than any other. ‘This second 
natural error again exacts a penalty by blind- 
ing inquiry to tickling that is not playful. 
The fact that tickling is not necessarily funny 
is fundamental for understanding its connec- 
tion with laughter. 
Tickling very seductively entices us to 
regard the ludicrous as a mental tickle. To 
~ say, when we laugh at a joke, that it tickled 
us, is almost as natural a metaphor as to call 
a baby “‘sweet’’. If the “cause of laughter 
is but a light touch of the spirits, and not so 
deep an impression as in the other passions ”’, 
as Bacon said, and if laughter ‘‘ is moved, and 
that in great vehemency, only by tickling 
some parts of the body” ”°,/ it is natural to 
see in the violent squirm started by the 
lightly touching tickle an actual picture of the 
“happy convulsion’ of laughter started by 
the light touch of the ludicrous upon the mindy) 
Speaking roughly but with sufficient accuracy, 
the theories of laughter, mainly of comic 
laughter, that obviously take their cue from 
the tickle, study tickling as a physiognomist, 
who, to deduce a politician’s character from 
his face, might, in the absence of the man, study 
his photograph. | For such theories the tickle 
isa physiological’ imitation of laughter at the 
42 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
ludicrous. Now tickling seems to contain a 
mixture of pleasure and pain. Bacon remarks 
that ‘“‘men even in a grieved state of mind ”’, 
if they are tickled, ‘‘ cannot sometimes forbear 
laughing ’’: there is a pleasure in the tickle. 
But he adds: “‘ and tickling is ever painful, and 
not wellendured”’. Protarchus learned from 
Socrates that tickling is a mixture of pain and 
pleasure, with a greater proportion of pain”. 
Theorists have been impressed with this 
mingling of pleasure and pain when they have 
forestalled Mr Eastman’s injunction to look 
to tickling accompanied by humorous emotion 
for an authentic and first picture of humour”. 
Dr Joubert, in 1579, thought that laughter — 
“does not come of pure joy, but has some 
little of sadness’. In tickling, he says, 
“the strange touch brings some pain and 
annoyment to the parts unaccustomed to it ; 
but, being light it causes some kind of false 
pleasure, namely that it does not truly offend 
and that nature enjoys diversity ”’ ”. 
Thus began the development of “‘conflict- 
mixture’ and “ oscillation ”’ theories. Many 
historical developments of thought impress the 
historian as inevitable, though he may think 
the ideas are false. The inevitableness of the 
comparison between the ludicrous and the 
tickle and the inevitable discovery of mingled 
pain and pleasure in tickling seem to necessi- 
tate at least one attempt to explain comic 
feeling as ‘‘ a rapid oscillation back and forth 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
between pleasure and pain’”’ or as a mastery 
of pain by pleasure in an oscillation or struggle 
between them. This line of thought prevailed, 
mainly in Germany, during the last century ”*. 
It may be called, for convenience, the “‘ tickle- 
theory” of laughter (more strictly, perhaps, 
of the ludicrous). 
Though the “ oscillation of feelings’ may 
be “an interesting myth”, as Mr Eastman 
calls it’?, like many myths it carries a hint 
at the truth, as the sequel will show. The 
correction of the “‘ tickle-theory ’’ and of most 
explanations of the connection between 
laughter and tickling, is important because 
it seems possible to make reasonably sure of 
the nature of that connection. It is so difficult 
to analyse laughter successfully or to secure 
unanimity on fundamental points that any- 
thing reasonably certain about it should be 
clearly conceived and firmly held. 
The original mistake, that encouraged 
thought along wrong paths, identified tickling 
with the tickle of nursery play. This mistake 
lingers still, for in 1912 a writer said “ that 
in the phenomena of tickling we get laughter 
produced as a purely physiological reflex, so 
unconnected with mental appreciation that 
it has been detected appearing as early as the 
seventh week of life’ "*. Wesquirm and laugh 
when tickled, this implies, as inevitably as 
we close our eyes when anything moves 
closely to them. But laughter and tickling 
44
-P-A-G-E-51
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
are easily divorced. Bacon noted that “in 
tickling, if you tickle the sides, and give 
warning . . . it doth not move laughter so 
much’’7*, Darwin also observed that tickling 
is most effective when the precise point of 
touch is not known*. In affirming this 
retarding by ‘‘ mental appreciation” these 
two writers repeat common knowledge. Fear, 
or any sufficiently strong suggestion of 
hostility, completes the divorce. This also is 
common knowledge. If you tickle a child 
who suspects you, and still more if he actually 
fears you, he will squirm but he will not laugh. 
Tie the victim down, bare his soles and tickle 
them vigorously : torture annuls amusement. 
The squirm of the tickled is a struggle: there 
is no struggle in laughter. Tickling may be 
the most crude and elementary form of play *, 
but nature did not devise the tickle for the 
sport of children. Play often makes sportive 
use of activities intended for more serious 
purposes—as boys will wrestle and box for 
amusement. A closer scrutiny of tickling 
itself suggests that the tickle is a serious 
device now largely relegated to nursery play. 
The playful tickle, which has so misled 
many, usually aims at the trunk of the body, 
the arm-pit, limbs, or neck. ‘The child’s bare 
soles also invite tickling. A careful analysis 
confirms the playful discovery that ticklish 
points are developed on the lateral chest-wall, 
the abdomen, the loins, the neck, and the 
45
-P-A-G-E-52
  LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
soles of the feet *: the side of the waist is a 
favourite spot for the fingers of the tickler. 
The violent squirm that responds to tickling 
at these points in a sensitive subject is too 
amusing to permit, or invite, appreciation of 
its significance. It is so amusing and so 
associated with playful teasing that laughter, 
in the passage quoted above, was said to be 
as fixed in the tickle as the squirm itself. If 
two sets of fingers were crawled, in the manner 
familiar to skilled ticklers, over the waist-sides 
of a portly, pompous, and sensitive dignitary, 
the theory that wherever squirm is, laughter 
is, would probably be revised—perhaps, if the 
experiment took place on an Eastern poten- 
tate within his own territory, in gaol. The 
dissociableness of laughter and squirming is 
realized more clearly by observing the usual 
absence of laughter from simpler examples of 
tickling. ‘If you tickle, the nostrils with a 
feather, or straw, it procureth sneezing’, 
observed Bacon *, hinting, perhaps unwit- 
tingly, that there is no indissoluble or necessary 
connection between tickling and laughing. 
Sneezing is obviously a device for ridding the 
nose of intrusive substances. The ticklish- 
ness of the nostrils is, equally obviously, a 
device to ensure the occurrence of the sneeze. 
The sneeze is not inherently comic, though it 
may provoke amusement or be jokingly 
provoked by a straw. The ticklish throat 
coughs out its intruders and the sensitive ear 
46
-P-A-G-E-53
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
withdraws from the threat of intrusion, either 
by agitating the body, as with men, or by its 
own movements, as with horses. The purpose 
in the ticklishness of the lateral chest-wall, 
abdomen, loins, and neck is less obscure in the 
light of the tickles in nose, mouth, and ear, 
and a conjunction of two incidents makes it 
plain. A child fingers the pepper-pot, waves 
pepper into its nose, and sneezes violently. 
Touch it under the arm-pits, or finger its 
waist, and it wriggles vigorously. It sneezes 
to dislodge the pepper from its nose, and its 
wriggle suggests a sneeze to relieve its whole 
body. ‘The violent squirm of the tickled child 
so obviously tries to avoid the tickling hand 
that, when the truth is perceived, it is difficult 
to understand how tickling and laughter could 
ever be identified or confused. Laughter 
neither shrinks nor advances ; tickled wriggles 
are violent efforts to escape. As the tickled 
nose sneezes to dislodge its intruder, so the 
tickled body struggles to dislodge the clutch 
of an enemy. Judging the tickle by the fun 
of play is like judging the sneeze by observing 
that it can be evoked by a straw. ‘The tick- 
lishness of the body, like the sneeze, is only 
incidentally funny. ‘The sneeze is still useful 
while the squirming of the body under tickling 
is now largely a survival of past usefulness. 
This reduction to a source of play has probably 
helped to conceal the significance of the tickle. 
Now, if the ticklishness of the body is assumed. 
47
-P-A-G-E-54
  LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
to survive from a time when men and their 
animal ancestors frequently wrestled in fight 
as a device for securing violent struggling to 
escape, the connection between tickling and 
laughter seems clear. 
The sneeze, the cough, and wriggling under 
tickle, the conclusion runs, are variants of one 
plan. They are vigorous actions instantly 
stirred by a tickle and aimed at intruders. 
Sneezing protects the nose, coughing protects 
the throat, and the tickled body struggles 
against an enemy’s embrace. When the 
tickle, originally a protection against real 
menace, is playfully given, the situation is 
transformed from the seriousness of battle 
to the relief of play. The tickled child is 
sharply incited to resist and struggle as if he 
were severely threatened. Since he knows, 
when the tickle is playful, that he is not 
threatened, the situation is quite appropriate 
tolaughter. ‘The tickle, as the violent squirm- 
ing shows, calls fiercely on the body for action 
and the friendliness of the attack calls action 
off. It is essentially a situation of relief and 
the mingling of laughter with squirming is 
intelligible. There is a mixture of pain and 
pleasure in the playful tickling of friends— 
here the mistaken analysts are right. They 
are misguided when they fail to perceive that 
real hostility dissipates pleasure and laughter 
with it. 
Hartley understood that tickling is a 
48 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
momentary pain or apprehension of it, 
followed by removal of the fear **. Sully notes 
that the spasm of the tickle is reflexly or 
inevitably provoked by the peculiar sensation 
of tickling, that there is an element of the 
unknown, and that the mirthfulness of tick- 
ling, which is affected by mood, is a transition 
from a momentary apprehension to a sense of 
harmlessness **. t 
The distribution of sensitiveness over the 
body indicates that the tickle is primarily a 
device to ensure a prompt, vigorous reply to 
assault. Darwin noted that the most easily 
tickled parts are usually those least frequently 
touched **. ‘They are least frequently touched 
in peace, but they are, significantly, the points 
of attack in war. Dr Crile pertinently ob- 
serves that animals fight effectively in the 
dark *7: the peculiar tickling sensations 
quickly warn the combatants of their oppon- 
ent’s grip and automatically incite appropri- 
ately vigorous struggles. 
The role of the tickle is confirmed by some 
further observations by Dr Crile, who has 
clearly indicated the real significance of tick- 
ling. Since a buzzing, insect-like contact 
seems to tickle the ear most adequately, 
nature has here provided tickling specially 
as a protection against insects. If each 
ticklish spot is specialized like those on the 
ear, it will be most sensitive to the most 
probable or most dangerous attack against 
49 D
-P-A-G-E-56
  LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
which it acts protectively. If there is such 
a distinct connection between the positions 
of ticklish spots and their most adequate 
inciters it justifies the role assigned to the 
tickle. Now the ribs, loins, abdomen, and 
neck are most effectively tickled by a tooth- 
shaped body **. ‘Thus the teeth of the carni- 
vore have deceived students of laughter who 
have studied it through the tickle by stimula- 
ting a curious, vigorous, and doubtless highly 
effective, sensitiveness to their bite on the 
body. This sensitiveness was so stamped in 
that it still persists, long after its original 
usefulness has waned. ‘The violent squirm of 
the tickled child is an indurated relic of its 
remote past that now provides amusement 
by responding to playful hostility and by 
deceiving philosophizers on laughter. 
The connection between the tooth of the 
carnivore and the squirm of the tickle is a 
warning to be careful to consult the past. A 
traveller picks up an irregular piece of metal 
which his experienced eye judges to be a 
fallen meteorite. He cuts it open and dis- 
covers a small diamond. Hatton Garden 
would not rave over the gem, but, pecuniarily 
worthless though it may be, it is a diamond. 
To explain its presence, the fiery passage of 
the meteorite through the earth’s atmosphere 
must be consulted, when the diamond crys- 
tallized from highly heated and compressed 
carbon. Consultation of the past is more 
necessary in the realm of life than in the realm 
50
-P-A-G-E-57
LAUGHTER AND TICKLING 
of mere matter and must not be omitted in 
discussing laughter. ‘This consultation has 
often been neglected by students of laughter, 
who have not, for example, always realized 
how laughing has been progressively human- 
ized as it moves towards sympathy. 
To the ungracious laughters from battle- 
triumph to self-congratulation, the laughters 
of greeting or play, purely comic or humorous 
laughter, and to sheer laughter of relief, 
laughter of tickling must be provisionally 
added. ‘These various laughters mingle freely, 
and the sense of the ludicrous, which con- 
stantly invades and tends to dominate all the 
others, pervades the playful tickle. Perhaps 
spectatorial amusement is more pronounced 
than the amusement of the victim. The wild 
struggles of the tickled child are comic 
because they exceed his needs: he responds 
to a friend as if he were an enemy. ‘This 
sympathetic transference of the relief situa- 
tion from participator to spectator has, as 
will appear in the sequel, an importance in 
the genesis of the varieties of laughter. 
The spectatorial amusement at tickled 
children is usually sympathetic. Though tick- 
ling may at times be a practical joke and 
tinged with its malice, adults usually laugh 
sympathetically at the children whom they 
tickle without cruelty. The ready entrance 
of sympathy into so crude and elementary 
a form of humour as tickling marks the open- 
ness of laughter to it. 
51
-P-A-G-E-58
ee, CHAPTER V 
LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
LAUGHTER, wrote Steele, is ‘‘a vent of any 
sudden joy’’**. This adds to the rapidly 
multiplying varieties of laughter, or suggests 
its addition, the laughter of pleasure. The 
New English Dictionary, in defining the act 
of laughing, includes three laughters: one 
“produced by tickling ’’, one expressing a 
“sense of something ludicrous’’, and one 
manifesting “mirth”. Social hilarity has 
been under suspicion as the mother of 
laughter: in the broad humour, indulgence 
and public gaiety of primitive communities, 
when the hunters had provided a feast or 
there was high festival after a well reaped 
harvest, Professor Carveth Read suggests, 
laughter was originally begotten ®°. The relief 
written on the mechanics of laughter, on its 
occasions and on all its associated emotions, is 
written on the individual hilarious mood and, 
almost in letters of fire, on public gaiety. 
That “lively din”, that “dancing in the 
chequered shade”, more barbarously, that 
52
-P-A-G-E-59
LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
wild bacchanalian rout, looses our spirit and 
we call, with Milton, on the nymph to haste 
« And bring with thee 
Jest, and youthful jollity” ™. 
Temporary relief from danger or emotional 
stress sensitizes the tendency to laugh, as 
the German soldiers, mentioned by Herbert 
Spencer, after great excitement laughed loudly 
at the smallest joke. When relief is com- 
plete, when the task is over or the day’s 
work done, when the harvest is reaped or the 
hunt accomplished or the battle won, when 
nothing can break the respite, then the mirth- 
ful mood descends and laughter ripples as 
constantly as waves roll on a moving sea. 
There may be a laughter of sheer gaiety, as 
there seems to be a laughter of sheer relief, 
though each gay laugh has its own special 
prompting—be it the meeting of cronies, a 
trifling mishap, or an incident of play. Per- 
haps the laughter of the mirthful mood 
should be described as hilarity, as laughter at 
the obviously ludicrous should be described 
as amusement. Possibly, however, the mirth- 
ful mood is simply a diffused mental relief 
that is a source of many laughters without 
being one of them. If Steele’s “ sudden joy ” 
is momentary mirth, and mirth, as it were, 
expanded and prolonged ‘‘sudden joy”, 
mirthful or joyous laughing may be demanded 
as an addition to the varieties of laughter. 
53
-P-A-G-E-60
  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
But, before surrendering to this demand, 
since the varieties of laughter seem to be 
springing up like the warriors from the dragon’s 
teeth, discretion counsels careful examination 
of the relation between laughter and pleasure. 
An infant smiles, thought Erasmus Darwin, 
as a dog wags its tail—to express pleasure *. 
If the smile is an ungrown laugh and the laugh 
a grown-up smile, laughing presumably con- 
tinues the duty of smiling by serving as the 
language of pleasure, and Charles Darwin 
regarded the| expression of joy or happiness 
as the primary function of laughter. If 
smiling is the natural language of pleasure 
in man, as Erasmus Darwin thought, and if 
there is no abrupt line between violent laugh- 
ter and faint smiling, as Charles Darwin 
affirmed, laughter will probably be primarily 
and distinctively an expression of pleasure, 
and joy or happiness will be the characteristic 
emotion of laughing. | Charles Darwin argued 
that the laugh is a full-grown smile because 
growing infants pass continuously from smiling 
to incipient laughter), Also, by a reversal of 
the original development of laughter out of 
the smile, gentle smiling may persist as a 
trace of the laughing habit *. Laughter be- 
gins, Freud also thinks, in the smile of the 
satiated nursling**. ‘‘ Laughter’, writes Mr 
Eastman, ‘‘is but an addition of breath and 
voice and gesture to this already complicated 
act” of smiling ®’. This united verdict, which 
54
-P-A-G-E-61
  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
is the spontaneous estimate of commonsense, 
seems to be just. ‘If the smile steals over the 
infant on satiety, as Freud avers, it is a token 
of relaxation. Erasmus Darwin, more ex- 
plicitly, says that the sphincter muscle of the 
mouth, after being fatigued by sucking, 
telaxes, and that that relaxation is visibly 
embodied in a smile**. Since the smile and 
the laugh are physically both expressions 
of relief, since the one grows gradually into 
the other and since they seem to be freely 
interchangeable, a smile on the face of one 
person greeting the same joke as the laugh 
shaking the body of another, they seem to be 
essentially related as more and less. A laugh 
is a big smile and a smile is a small laugh. 
Professor M*Dougall fears this conclusion 
just because ‘‘ the smile is unquestionably the 
normal expression of pleasure ”, and accuses 
“both philosophers and common opinion ” of 
“the error of confounding the laugh with 
the smile’”’. If ‘‘ amusement ’’ is the specific 
emotional excitement of laughter and smiling 
normally expresses pleasure he must obviously 
separate the origin and functions of smiling 
and laughter. The universal estimate that 
smiles are little laughs and laughs are big 
smiles is misled, in his opinion, because we 
often are pleased when we laugh: laughter, 
because it is often happy, is confused with 
smiling which is always happy. Laughter 
and smiling, he urges, must be distinct in 
55
-P-A-G-E-62
LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
origin because they appear in the infant at 
different dates**. But so is there a difference 
of date between the appearance of the youth 
and the mature man out of the child—never- 
theless they have the same origin. ‘There is 
always a difference of date in development : 
Darwin’s development of the laugh from the 
smile will seem to most, as M*Dougall admits 
by implication, as obvious as the stepping of 
the chick from the egg. 
We can agree with M*°Dougall that the 
“procedure very commonly adopted” of 
assuming “that laughter is essentially the 
expression of pleasure, that we laugh because 
we are pleased ’’, is a questionable assump- ’ 
tion, without admitting his distinction between 
laughter and smiling, or rejecting the 
““pleasure-theory ’’ of laughter because it has 
“ given rise to two famous theories, namely— 
the theory of pure malevolence” and “ the 
theory of self-congratulation ’’1°°. Joy, accord- 
ing to Descartes, can cause laughter only when 
it is moderate or has some wonder or hate 
in it'. He assumes, interprets M*Dougall, 
laughter to be essentially an expression of 
pleasure, and then attempts to explain why 
we are pleased with ludicrous objects. He 
concludes, continues the interpretation, “that 
it is the nature of man to rejoice at the mis- 
fortunes and defects of his fellows’’, just 
as Hobbes concluded that we rejoice at our 
own immunity from these “‘ misfortunes and 
56
-P-A-G-E-63
  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
defects”. Thus “the theory of malevol- 
ence”? and “the theory of self-congratula- 
tion”’ are the “two most famous varieties 
of what may be called the pleasure theories 
of laughter’. “If either of them be true”’, 
he adds, “‘ laughter is essentially hateful’’ 1° 
If either theory is the whole truth, or most 
of it, “‘ laughter is essentially hateful”. But 
some laughters unquestionably contain malig- 
nant pleasure. The contemporaries of Pope 
reviled his ‘‘ misfortunes with a _ strange 
acrimony, and made his poor deformed person 
the butt for many a bolt of heavy wit” 1°. 
Thackeray would perceive in this coarse ridicule 
both pleasure and malignance. Some laughter 
is also undeniably self-congratulatory. Malig- 
nancy and self-congratulatory theories mistake 
a part for the whole by assuming that pleasure 
at misfortune always pervades laughter be- 
cause it is sometimes, and perhaps, especially 
in ancient laughter, often, present. Some 
laughter is hateful and M*Dougall virtually 
assumes that laughter can never be hateful 
without being always so. 
Professor M*Dougall errs like the two 
theories he condemns by mistaking a part for 
a whole. Much, perhaps most, laughter is 
amused, but not all. Though many emotions 
mingle variously in laughter, and amusement 
constantly pervades it, a sense of the ludi- 
crous is not essential to the laughter of greet- 
ing and is often absent from it. Amusement 
57
-P-A-G-E-64
  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
has no monopoly of laughter, any more than 
triumph or derision or hate or self-congrat- 
ulation has a monopoly of it. 
Laughter is usually pleasurable simply 
because the sense of relief is pleasurable/ 
Other pleasures may contribute to the whole, 
amusement for example may add its own 
quota, but laughter is fast bound to the pleas- 
urable because relief is naturally incompatible 
with the unpleasant. If this bond is ever 
broken it is only temporarily in abnormal or 
pathological laughing. But, though pleasure 
of relief may monopolize laughter in the sense 
that no laugh can normally occur without it, 
laughter is no monopolizer of pleasure. Mr 
Eastman was forgetful when he commended 
Darwin because he ‘‘ rediscovered the obvious 
truth that men laugh when they are 
happy ’?%: they often do, but not always. 
“The smile is unquestionably the normal 
expression ’’ of many pleasures, but not “ of 
pleasure ”’?%. When an audience is thrilled 
by an oratorio it does not laugh ; we do not 
laugh at beauty or great poetry, nor smile at 
the revelation of a great scientific truth. 
There is neither laughter nor smiling in the 
tense excitement of action, though exertion, 
like the concentration of mind on an attractive 
problem, may be highly pleasurable. Tense 
pleasure and laughter do not keep company.

from a raised bank at the side. As the ball 
flies from the left the line of heads turns with 
it towards the right ; as it flies from the right

considerable part of a semi-circle the ball has 
been struck over the net from one base-line 
to the other. If, while revolving from left to 
tight, they halt and turn sharply back, the 
right-hand player has volleyed at the net. 
The faces reflect feeling as the moving heads 
are a diagram of the ball’s movements. 
Smiles and laughter appear on the faces 
when a break in their rhythmic movement 
announces the end of a rally. The same 
succession of seriousness and laughing, as 
active play is followed by a break when a 
point is scored, is also apparent in the players. 
Neither players nor spectators laugh during 
the tenseness of play ; when effort moment- 
arily relaxes they usually all smile. The 
players enjoy the active periods and the 
spectators enjoy them too. It is clear to 
the philosophical observer that there are 
pleasures of tension and pleasures of relief. 
It is equally clear that laughter is as inappro- 
priate to the one as it is appropriate to the 
other. ; 
Laughter is restricted in its expression of 
59

  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
joy to pleasures that contain relief| The joy 
that announces creation?** does not laugh, 
though the creator may subsequently laugh 
on accomplishment. The inquirer into 
laughter meets relief more inevitably than 
Alice, when she had slipped Through the 
Looking-Glass, met the front-door. She could 
avoid it by following the apparently absurd 
advice of the rose “to walk the other way ’’. 
She set off towards the Red Queen and, to 
her surprise, instantly lost sight of her and 
found herself walking in again through the 
front-door.. Then she tried the plan of walk- 
ing in the opposite direction. Though “ it 
succeeded beautifully ”’, the plan of searching 
laughter for something more fundamental or 
distinctive than relief fails entirely. The 
advice of the rose is useless here. Whatever 
path is trodden, whether laughter is ap- 
proached through triumph or scorn or self- 
congratulation, whether it is studied in the 
laughter of greeting or the laugh of play, 
whether search is made in the laughter of 
tickling or amusement or of pleasure, how- 
ever thought turns and whatever direction 
it follows, the quest always ends on relief. 
The directions pursued by our analysis have 
so far always ended thus and all other direc- 
tions will be found to end in the same way. 
A hint from Coleridge detains thought for a 
moment on the possibility of co-ordinating

LAUGHTER AND. PLEASURE 
the relief essential to laughter with the belief 
that pleasure is the specific emotional accom- 
paniment of laughing. “(Laughter is a con- 
vulsion of the nerves; and it seems as if 
nature cuts short the rapid thrill of pleasure 
on the nerves by a sudden convulsion of them, , 
to prevent the sensation becoming painful ’’1°7. / 
If laughter steps the intensity of pleasure 
down to avoid the pain of excessive strain it 
may be a regulatory mechanism in the general 
expression of joy. But violent laughter, in 
the very strength of its convulsions, has a high 
emotional excitement. | When we laugh at the 
sudden removal of an unfounded fear, our 
pleasure springs out of a relief from pain, not 
from the reduction of an intolerable pleasure, 
The hint arrests, as Coleridge’s hints often do 
arrest, but is unable to detain opinion per- 
manently on an estimate of laughter as 
primarily and originally an expression of 
pleasure. 
No single emotion or feeling seems to be the 
specific associate of laughter: amusement is 
' not because, though laughter always tends to 
be pervaded by it, all laughing is not amused ; 
pleasure is not because much joy does not 
laugh. Unless it is desperately assumed that 
laughter originated as an expression of relaxa- 
tion-pleasure, the situation of relief in which 
laughter arises must be regarded as a centre 
round which many feelings collect. This 
collection of feelings round laughter, or round 
6r 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
the relief it expresses, and their complex 
mingling, explain the rich variety in laughing. 
If there is a specific original emotional accom- 
paniment of relaxation-pleasure to laughter, 
that original laughter might well correspond 
to laughing from sheer relief. 
A sense of rich variety in the emotional 
or feeling aspect of laughter has always per- 
vaded literature. ‘‘ Compare the comedies of 
Congreve with the Falstaff in Henry IV, or 
with Sterne’s Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby, and 
Mr Shandy ”’, remarks Coleridge**. ‘In dif- 
ferent persons”’, thought Hartley, “‘ the occa- 
sions of laughter must be as different as their 
opinions and dispositions” °°. ‘The varieties 
of laughter include in their diversity, writers 
constantly insist, national varieties. Cole- 
ridge distinguished the thoughtfulness of 
English humour from the ethereal humour of 
Spain 4°. The Rev. the Right Hon. Edward 
Lyttelton distinguishes reticent Scotch humour 
from the “volatile and refined, but cold” 
humour of the Irish. A distrust of the 
accuracy in the analyses of national forms of 
humour need not deny a real sense of their 
differences: an observer can usually be 
trusted to discriminate people by a sense of 
their differences, though he may faultily 
describe their points of unlikeness. However 
laughters are classified, there are many to 
classify and many ways of classifying. With- 
out surrendering to a classificatory passion 
62
-P-A-G-E-69
LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
and attempting to distinguish laughters with 
a fond attention to their order of genesis 
or other order of connection, it seems clearly 
and indubitably evident that a fundamental 
situation of relief, expressing itself physically 
in the act of laughing, has been a centre of 
collection, and also of genesis, for many 
mingling feelings and emotions. 
It has been a centre of genesis because 
amusement, the sense of the ludicrous, when- 
ever it arises, seems to be indissolubly con- 
nected with the laughable situation. This 
characteristic, familiar, and indefinable 
emotion, or feeling, is unique enough to be a 
formidable claimant for the specific emotional 
associateship, if there be such, in the com- 
bination of bodily reaction and emotion known 
as laughter. Amusement is peculiarly enough 
and intimately enough the close associate of 
physical laughing or smiling to prompt 
M°Dougall’s theory that laughter is an in- 
stinct and amusement its specific emotional 
accompaniment, and to carry justification of 
the theory far. But the real truth seems to 
be that the situation provided by laughter, 
with its fundamental relief and often complex 
mingling of feelings, has provided a centre of 
growth for the sense of the ludicrous. Amuse- 
ment is not merely relief, and analysis of the 
sense of the ludicrous has been notoriously 
inadequate, but it has sprung as a new creation, 
as all things that grow spring as new crea- 
63 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
tions, from the fundamental situation pre- 
sented by laughter. 
A sheer sense of relief may be the germinal 
feeling of laughter. But it is wise, in study- 
ing so elusive a sprite as the spirit of laughter, 
to be contented with the limited degree of 
assurance that is possible. Amid much that 
is uncertain and much that is elusive the 
collection round the fundamental relief of 
laughter of many mingled feelings and the 
genesis of some emotions from that primary 
situation seem to be assured. Anger has one 
emotion and many actions ; laughter has one 
action and many emotions. 
“Kmotion ”’ is here used, as before men- 
tioned, almost interchangeably with “feeling”’, 
to denote the affective aspect of the conscious 
accompaniment of laughter, without en- 
deavouring to conform to precise definitions. 
M°Dougall has no qualms about identifying 
“amusement ”’ with “‘ emotion ’’, and popular 
impression will prefer this opinion to Bergson’s 
dictum that emotion is a foe to laughter. 
Some emotions are foes, inveterate and con- 
quering foes, to laughter: fierce anger does 
not laugh. But Bergson apparently does not 
merely mean that some emotions are inappro- 
priate to laughter and dissipate or prevent the 
emotions peculiar to laughing, for he insists 
that laughter is usually accompanied by no 
feeling. “‘ To produce the whole of its effect, 
then ’’, he also adds, “‘the comic demands some- 
64
-P-A-G-E-71
  
LAUGHTER AND PLEASURE 
thing like a momentary anesthesia of the 
heart. Its appeal is to intelligence, pure and 
simple”, | So far as this intimates a glimpse 
of one truth it is welcome. The dispassionate 
freedom of the purely comic from either 
animus or sympathy seems to distinguish it 
from the sense of the ludicrous touched with 
sympathy that prompted Dr Duncan to say : 
“T have a great regard for the Humourists, 
for they are generally men of a tender 
heart’ 5, If Bergson means that comic 
laughter feels nothing, it seems sufficient 
criticism to refer to M°Dougall’s identification 
of the sense of amusement with emotion and 
to note one’s next laughter at a joke. Com- 
mon experience will side, if a side must be 
taken, rather with Herbert Spencer than with 
Bergson: “Strong feeling, mental or phy- 
sical” is “the general cause of laughter’ ™.

  CHAPTER VI 
LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
WHEN a caterpillar of the Porthesia Chry- 
sorrhoea butterfly is placed in a horizontal 
glass tube which has one end in the dark 
and the other in sunlight, it crawls to the 
lighted end. ‘Two caterpillars placed in the 
dark end creep together to the light, or 
remain at the lighted end if they are placed 
there, just as either of them would do if it 
were in the tube alone. ‘Three or four or five 
or any number of caterpillars behave precisely 
as one or two behave. ‘Thus a crowd of these 
caterpillars is drawn by light because each 
individual is so drawn, and the animals are 
not influenced by companionship ™. 
The frigate La Belle-Poule was searching 
for her consort, the corvette Le Barceau, 
after a storm had separated the two vessels. 
Suddenly the look-out on the frigate signalled 
to her crew. All the officers and men, thus 
summoned to the deck, saw a raft swarming 
with men and towed by boats flying flags of 
distress. A boat was lowered, manned, and 
towed rapidly towards the ship-wrecked 
66
-P-A-G-E-73
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
sailors. As the rescuing boat approached, 
the rescuers saw many men clambering on 
the raft, saw them stretching out their hands 
and heard their cries of distress. But when 
the boat drew nearer there were no men, no 
boats, and no raft: there was only a drifting 
mass of tree-branches, covered with leaves. 
The shout of the look-out, comments Le Bon 
in telling the story, stirred a common illusion, 
a “collective hallucination’, in each mind. 
A common fear for their comrades’ safety and 
a common hope for their discovery predisposed 
each member of the frigate’s crew to confound 
drifting trees with the objects of their search. 
Through minds thus prepared the mistaken 
cry of the look-out spread as a swift, dominat- 
ing suggestion ™*. 
When a number of human beings act 
similarly or think alike it is often difficult 
to distinguish between forces which, like light 
upon the caterpillars, produce common action 
or thought by acting separately upon each 
individual, and forces which, like the sugges- 
tive shout from the mast on the La Belle- 
Poule, impose community through companion- 
ship. | Laughter is influenced by social contact 
and intercourse, but the extent and nature of 
this influence are difficult to assign exactly, 
though the extent is obviously very great}. 
One very distinct operation upon its members 
by society, however, can be clearly detected 
in laughter. 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
A genius is an ordinary man greatly magni- 
fied: as Sydney Smith wrote, “ The meaning 
of an extraordinary man is, that he is eight 
men, not one man’”’™?, An ordinary man is 
a solitary man magnified by the companion- 
ship of society. This social magnification of 
the knowledge and powers of individuals is 
one of the most obvious; as it is one of the 
most important, effects of companionship 
upon human beings. Every member of a 
human society has more eyes than Argus: 
through how many eyes does he look when 
he reads one news-sheet! He has more 
hands than Briareus: how many hands has 
he used when he has read a single book! 
_ The ordinary man is the genius of the animal 
world, as the extraordinary man is the genius 
of the human, because society multiplies his 
knowledge and magnifies his powers. 
Social contact and intercourse multiply 
extensively by spreading ideas, emotions, and 
actions among the members of groups or 
intensively by fixing these ideas, emotions, 
and actions more firmly in each individual 
and adding to their vigour. Social magni- 
fication distributes abroad and increases each 
single distribution. The shout of the look-out 
spread an illusion through the whole ship’s 
company and, by spreading it, fixed it more 
firmly in each mind. Since this wave of 
suggestion, in effect, converted many ob- 
68
-P-A-G-E-75
  
LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
servers into one highly prejudiced and com- 
pletely deluded observer, Le Bon can 
plausibly argue that events reported by a 
number of persons are the most doubtful. 
But social magnification works up as well as 
down. It worked up in the boys’ discussion 
club described by De Quincey: ‘‘ What one 
boy had not, another had; and thus by 
continual intercourse, the fragmentary con- 
tribution of one being integrated by the 
fragmentary contributions of others, grad- 
ually the attainments of each separate in- 
dividual became, in some degree, the collective 
attainments of the whole senior common 
toom”’8, This spreading and intensifying 
through social contact and intercourse, which 
works so obviously in human societies both 
for weal and for woe, has operated in laughter. 
Monkeys smile and laugh when they are 
tickled or receive a tit-bit or see a friend or 
make friends with their keeper™*. These 
simple occasions of laughter and their ele- 
mentary emotions have been multiplied in 
man, through social influence, into a richer 
variety of occasions and emotions. As a 
laugher, as in other capacities, man is the 
genius of the animal world and his genius is 
a social product. 
“The first occasion ’’, remarks Hartley, of 
children’s laughter, ‘‘ seems to be a surprise, 
which brings on a momentary fear first, and 
then a momentary joy in consequence of the 
69
-P-A-G-E-76
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
removal of that fear. . . . This is the original 
of laughter in children which is multiplied 
by imitation. . . . For whatever can be shown 
to take place at all in human nature, must 
take place in a much higher degree than ac- 
cording to the original causes, from our great 
disposition to imitate one another” #°. 
Laughter has become so important in 
human life because it is infectious. The 
encouragement of one laugh by another has 
spread and fixed the laughing habit, and as 
occasions appropriate to its fundamental 
nature of relief arise they find a laughing 
response ready prepared. [As these laughing 
responses multiply in each person and spread. 
through society, the tendency to laugh be- 
comes more easily provoked and richer in 
variety of feeling.| The first laugh of the child, 
usually when it~is about three months old, 
becoming a habit as it responds to com- 
panionship and constantly attended by new 
emotions as the growing mind becomes cap- 
able of the various experiences that can 
excite laughter, hints at the development of 
laughter in the human race. ‘The limited 
laughter of monkeys and the wider laughter 
of men give the same hint. 
Most human actions are infectious, but 
some are more infectious than others. 
Laughter seems to be naturally well qualified 
for social infectiousness because its inherent 
telief qualifies it to express so many different 
70
-P-A-G-E-77
  
LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
shades of feeling. Very many of these feel- 
ings, also, naturally unite men in a common 
emotion: victorious triumph, public rejoic- 
ings, and greetings among friends are pre- 
eminently collective experiences. Relief is 
too congenial and its various associated 
feelings are too grateful to human hearts 
and minds for laughter, which expresses so 
many of them, to prefer to lurk singly. 
Community is so natural to laughter that 
laughing is only ‘‘ without offence ’’, as Hobbes. 
remarks, when “all the company may laugh 
together: for laughing to one’s self putteth 
all the rest into jealousy and examination 
of themselves” #2. The self-contained laugh 
perhaps suggests a secret scorn, though it 
may also suggest a pleasure unshared, but 
even laughter of contempt can be social and 
infectious, for men are often ready to share a 
delight in humiliation. 
Laughter is so social that it is often assumed 
to have originated socially. The actual 
“ original of laughter ’’ is difficult, probably 
impossible, of discovery, but laughing did not 
necessarily arise in social situations because 
it so persistently haunts them. Hobbes, as 
his critics often forget, suggested two sources. 
for laughter. hen men laugh “they 
suddenly applaud themselves”’ for one of 
two reasons: either they compare them- 
’ selves with ‘‘ some deformed thing in another ”’ 
or their “ grimaces”’ are caused “‘ by some 
71 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
sudden act of their own that pleaseth them ”’ 12, 
If laughter can be private, and we do laugh 
privately at private thoughts, private situa- 
tions may be its original source. Many writers 
urge that private laughter, which has no 
apparent reference to other persons, may 
really contain a social situation in disguise. 
‘Undoubtedly we are to such an extent 
creatures of society that we insist, even when 
we are alone, that we are really one among 
many. By thinking, said Socrates to 
Thezetetus, “‘I mean the conversation which 
the soul holds with herself in considering of 
anything. I speak of what I hardly know ; 
but the soul when thinking appears to be 
just talking—asking questions of herself and 
answering them, affirming and denying 
them’’s, When Socrates compared thinking, 
which is private, to talking, which exchanges 
ideas among many, he involuntarily thought 
of himself as a group. 
If there is always some subtle: personifica- 
tion in laughter, so that a man laughing alone 
and apparently at some queer thing laughs 
because the thing is, though it may be wi- 
wittingly, a living or human being to his laugh, 
the lone laugher always involuntarily thinks 
of himself as one of a group. It is often said 
that nothing can be ludicrous, or provoke 
amused laughter, unless it sufficiently suggests 
a social situation: when we seem to laugh at 
(things w we teally laugh because they suggest 
72
-P-A-G-E-79
  
LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
something human, Thus a turnip will look 
funny if it suggests a human face. Amused 
laughter will probably least easily of all 
laughters escape from the social circle. Emer- 
son apparently thought that even comic 
laughter need not be socially situated: 
“Separate any object, as a particular bodily 
man, a horse, a turnip, a flour-barrel, an 
umbrella, from the connection of things, and 
contemplate it alone, standing there in absolute 
Nature, it becomes at once comic ; no useful, 
no respectable qualities can rescue it from the 
ludicrous”. If isolation is per se ludicrous, 
amusement probably need not imply, even 
unwittingly, a social situation. Angry dis- 
pute might rage over Helen Keller’s sense of 
the ludicrous between the two opposing views. 
Since she was blind and dumb from birth, 
she appreciated the ,comic through touch and 
feelings of her own movements. The bulge 
of a water-melon felt ludicrous to her and she 
was amused at ‘‘ the puffed-up rotundities of 
squashes’ 5, Without denying that a water- 
melon may amusingly suggest human pride, 
a physical bulge hinting at a psychical bulge, 
and without affirming it, there remains a 
presumption that comic perception need not 
presuppose a social situation,real or imaginary. 
But for laughter that arose, and arises, apart 
from companionship, “a sudden act of their 
own that pleaseth them” in the laughers, | 
a laughter corresponding to the influence of 
73
-P-A-G-E-80
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
light upon the caterpillars and free from the 
suggestion pervading the frigate’s crew, it is 
wiser to search lower than amusement in 
some more primitive forms of laughter. 
When the engine of a gramophone has been 
wound, a record placed on its disc and the 
needle placed in position, releasing the catch 
automatically starts the machinery and a tune 
is played. As the gramophone is set to play 
when the catch is released, so the body, or 
part of it, is set to wink its eyes when anything, 
a menacing finger for example, comes near 
them. In such reflex actions an external 
stimulus, corresponding to the released catch 
in the gramophone or the approaching finger 
in the wink, sharply prompts an action pre- 
pared in the body corresponding to the 
arrangement of the gramophone for producing 
music or the nervous mechanism to ensure 
winking. ‘The term “ reflex’’ is applied only 
to the responses of living things to stimuli. 
In human beings the stimulus appeals to the 
brain or spinal cord by an impulse trans- 
mitted through sensory nerves and the central 
nervous system responds by enforcing the 
appropriate movements through motor nerves. 
Sometimes the term “ reflex’ simply means 
this connection between stimulus and reaction 
through the nervous system; sometimes it 
implies that the reaction is inevitable and 
uniform ; and sometimes it implies that the 
74
-P-A-G-E-81
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
reaction is unconscious and involuntary". 
Now laughter sometimes seems to happen like 
the tune on the gramophone when the catch is 
released or like winking when something moves 
towards the eyes. 
The acridness of the herba sardonia, or 
Sardinian herb, is said to convulse the faces 
of those who eat it. ‘‘ Sardonic’’, because of 
this, is applied to pathological laughter in 
which “the nostrils are drawn upward, and 
the cheeks backward toward the ears; so 
that the whole countenance assumes the air 
of a cynic spasm or sardonic grin’, or to the 
“involuntary, convulsive drawing down of 
the angles of the mouth in tetanus”. Sar- 
donic laughter ordinarily means bitter or 
mocking laughter, or, as Dr Johnson put it: 
“what the Latins call Sardinian Laughter, a 
distortion of the face without gladness of 
heart’’7. If the Sardinian herb automati- 
cally provokes laughter, as a finger approach- 
ing the eye automatically provokes winking, 
that laughter is reflex. But it hardly arises 
from ‘‘ purely physical causes’, as Héffding 
seems to think'*. ‘The acrid taste implies an 
element of mental appreciation which is 
present in many of our reflex actions. A very 
large human body will jump from the point of 
a very small pin because there is pain in the 
stimulus. There is feeling in the tickling of 
the nostrils that ensures a sneeze, and when 
the eyes close before an approaching finger 
75
-P-A-G-E-82
ee ee Le eee 
LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
there is a consciousness of its approach. None 
of these reflexes, sardonic laughter, shrinking 
from a sharp point, sneezing, or winking, 
are as perfectly automatic, as purely physical 
and devoid of consciousness, as the musical 
response of a gramophone to the release of 
the catch. 
Hoffding *° mentions some other examples 
of reflex laughter automatically stimulated 
by physical causes. A hypnotized lady burst 
into uncontrollable laughter whenever the 
bridge of her nose was pressed. Gladiators 
who were wounded in the diaphragm died 
laughing. Ludovicus Vives laughed irrepressi- 
bly when he first tasted food after a long fast. 
But none of these can be confidently affirmed 
to have been entirely due to physical causes, 
because some mental appreciation may have 
been present—and probably was. 
Nor can an “ original of laughter ”’ purely 
physically provoked, like the forward leap of 
a motor-car without any sense of the situation 
when the driver moves the lever, be found in 
the laughter of the tickle. Sully compromises 
by calling the laughter excited by tickling 
“quasi-reflex’”’8°. If a child is tickled on the 
soles of its feet it will laugh only if it is con- 
tented and it is clear, as already observed 
in Chapter IV, that in the ‘‘ phenomena of 
tickling’ laughter is not “ produced as a 
purely physiological reflex” entirely ‘“ un- 
connected with mental appreciation ”’. 
76  
-P-A-G-E-83
  
LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
The laughter of the woman who was caught 
in machinery and threw herself on the table 
to laugh when she was released from the 
danger of mutilation or death was probably 
one of the most original and primary forms 
of laughing. Such laughter of sheer relief 
naturally invites this conclusion. It_is most 
probable that a sudden, relieving interruption 
of actual physical action, involving distinct or 
even violent effort, was the primary occasion 
of laughter. The more mental occasions, 
when laughter more obviously ‘hath its 
source from the intellect ’’ and there “ pre- 
cedeth a conceit of somewhat ridiculous ” #, 
most probably developed out of the more 
purely physical. Hobbes’ hint in the “ sudden 
act of their own” and Hoéffding’s search for 
purely reflex laughters indicate the most 
probable originating situation for laughter. 
It is doubtful whether “laughter may arise 
from purely physical causes, and so need not 
be an expression of an emotion at all” ™, 
but it probably arose originally, and _ still 
continues to arise, in a sudden _ call-off 
from physical effort—in a relief through 
suddenly relaxed, because unrequired, bodily 
strain. 
When laughter is a break in physical 
exertion it need not be socially situated: 
the woman laughed because the machine 
could not mangle her. Hypercriticism cannot 
plausibly argue that she subtly personified 
77
-P-A-G-E-84
    LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
the machinery into a malignant demon in 
order to laugh. If violent cold, suddenly 
applied, can excite laughter ?**, such laughing 
appears to be independent of a social milieu. 
But, without depending upon this conse- 
quence of stimulation by cold and without 
trusting too much to Sully’s statement that 
“we are never affected by comicality of a 
thing without experiencing a tickle in the 
throat 35, which suggests a relic of its 
original reflex nature in all laughter, it seems 
reasonably certain that men have laughed, 
and still laugh, with an emotion of sheer, 
unsocially determined relief. Sudden escapes 
from physical dangers and sudden successes 
in physical efforts, as when a final shove 
launches a boat, can provide laughters of 
relief and provide them without any reference 
to society. 
The break in physical effort which provides 
laughter with a situation of relief can occur in 
fight. Triumphant laughter reveals very clearly 
the multiplying, intensifying and diversi- 
fying influence of society upon laughter. 
The sheer relief of intermitted physical action 
and sudden salvation from danger as the 
warrior vanquishes his foe has an extra 
emotional gusto and character because an 
enemy has been defeated. Our emotional 
life is most sensitive and most developed in 
relation to social situations. It is probably 
significant that sound is the most exciting 
78
-P-A-G-E-85
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
sense: music is the most intensely emotional 
esthetic experience that man can construct 
out of sense-impressions. If this fact is 
conjoined with the importance of the human 
voice in keeping psychic touch between human 
beings and the sensitiveness of men to one 
another’s voices, the important role of society 
in stimulating and developing emotional life 
is manifest. Cries and words are the most 
important connecting links between human 
minds, and the emotional gusto of sounds 
is quite natural if society is the great source 
of emotion. ‘Thus the original physical relief 
of laughter is exposed, in exulting triumph, 
to the emotional impulses incident to a social 
situation. 
Since triumph can be shared, it spreads 
laughter through the group and the exultant 
laugh of each member becomes more exultant 
because it is shared. Thus in the collective 
triumphant laughter of a victorious tribe the 
original laughter of physical relief begets a 
social laughter in which it is spread, intensified, 
and developed. 
Mirthful feasts of vintage or harvest or 
hunting contain the same core of relaxation 
from successful physical effort as collective 
battle-triumph. § 
The importance and primacy of successful 
physical effort and of actual physical relief 
in the situations appropriate to laughter con- 
tinually tinge many varieties of laughing with 
79
-P-A-G-E-86
    LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
exultation or triumph. The heightened sense 
of power after victory is prominent, Sully 
remarks, in primitive laughter**. Laughter 
may have originated, Professor Carveth Read 
conjectures, in the broad humour and in- 
dulgence after successful hunting or harvest- 
ing’. Mr Eastman, who thinks that un- 
sympathetic or ungracious elements are 
pollutions of laughter and not parts of it, 
has to admit that “laughter has perhaps a 
more elementary—or at least a more strong 
and spasmodic—connection with states of 
triumphant lust and battle-cruelty than with 
any other satisfactions except those of the 
social instinct itself’ *. We are actors 
primarily and thinkers secondarily, and, 
though thought may have the higher value, 
the ultimately active and physically striving 
element provides the original form for laugh- 
ter, as for all experiences, and continues to 
give body to it. A child playing hide-and- 
seek who suddenly discovers a second child 
concealed in a cupboard laughs excitedly at 
its sudden success. This little incident ex- 
plains gaily, as the laughing yell of triumph 
explains grimly, the significance of relief in 
physical activity for the genesis and nature 
of laughter. 
Society freely absorbs the situation of 
telief so fundamental to laughter. The pract- 
ical joker can actively torment his fellows 
. and laugh over the success of his stratagems. 
: 80

LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
Play provides laughter with occasions ; scorn, 
contempt, and greeting provide it with more. 
Since his social milieu is man’s most intimate 
and emotional touch with the universe, the 
situations of relief that invite or stimulate 
laughter are predominantly and almost 
exclusively social. Thus a laughter of sheer 
telief, circumspectly assumed to be the 
“ original of laughter ’’, marking a break in 
physical effort, spread by social infection, 
transfused by and incorporated with a rich 
variety of feeling, developed into a sense of 
the ludicrous that seems by its peculiar 
quality almost to deny its kinship with other 
laughters, is enlarged by society till the 
normal civilized being collects round a funda- 
mental centre of relief and expresses by a 
familiar “‘ mechanical motion” that assem- 
blage of feelings commonly called laughter. 
Since one man can watch the success of 
another and laugh with him, laughter can 
free itself from the necessity of marking a 
break in actual physical effort. A solitary 
being who had no fellows might conceivably 
learn to laugh with recollected relief at a 
recollected achievement. However this may 
be, the spectatorial possibilities supplied by 
society were important for the destinies of 
laughter. When spectators of another’s 
laughter laughed as if they had struggled 
and suddenly succeeded as he did, they were 
opening up possibilities. This spectatorial 
81 F
-P-A-G-E-88
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
repetition in thought is accompanied by a 
subdued bodily imitation of the actions 
observed, for whenever we watch incidents 
or think of them we probably perform slight 
movements which, if they were completed, 
would repeat the contemplated actions 
exactly. Aristotle advised the poet to “ act 
his story with the very gestures of his person- 
ages’’’*® to obtain imaginative grip on his 
drama. Every spectator at a football match 
probably follows the fortunes of the game with 
subdued, incipient movements that imitate the 
movements of the players, and community of 
feeling in the crowd is connected with a 
community of action. Thus, though the 
spectatorial laughter which repeats the 
laughter of an observed action when the 
agent is suddenly relieved of necessity for 
further effort does not spring from relaxation 
of full physical exertion, it still retains a 
connection with a physical situation. 
Spectatorial influence upon laughter is not 
limited by this sympathetic, contemplative 
mimicry. The man who is chasing his hat 
does not laugh, though he may laugh when he 
catches it ; the man who watches the chase 
does, laughter thus escapes from actual par- 
ticipation in an action, whether through 
palpable performance or mental repetition. 
This transference from a direct consequence 
of physical action to a more purely mental 
character represents a significant development 
82
-P-A-G-E-89
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
for laughter. When Mr Max Beerbohm 
remarks that ‘‘the physical sensations of 
Jaughter are reached by a process whose 
starting-point is the mind’”’*** he is noting 
laughter in a far remove from its original 
source in sheer relief when sudden success 
telieves physical effort. The contemplation 
of laughter in this far remove is apt to iden- 
tify laughing emotion with the sense of the 
ludicrous, because amusement gradually 
dominates laughter as it grows away from its 
more elementary forms. Thus Bacon, who 
emphasizes, what Mr Beerbohm subsequently 
echoes, that “laughing . . . hath its source 
from the intellect’, adds “for in laughing 
there ever precedeth a conceit of somewhat 
ridiculous” ™. —_——| 
The original situation of physical relief, 
which has a mental side from the beginning, 
represents the fundamental plan on which all 
laughter is built. The perception of incon- 
gruity, which is the core of the ludicrous, is 
the mental equivalent in amused laughter of 
physical release in more elementary forms of 
laughing. Writers who are careful to survey 
laughter and note its various forms usually 
admit with Hoffding that ‘‘ laughter makes 
its appearance even before anything ridiculous 
can be realized in consciousness ” 1**, and with 
Sully that the feeling of the ludicrous is an 
outgrowth from more primitive forms™. If 
many feelings assemble round laughter or 
83
-P-A-G-E-90
  LAUGHTER AND SOCIETY 
are expressed by it, the corresponding mental 
experiences will presumably have a funda- 
mentally identical structure. The plan of this 
structure is most clear in the sudden relief 
of successful physical exertion or in a wel- 
come relaxation of it. (This original occasion, 
mainly through social influence, has been 
multiplied, extended, and modified until the 
physical habit of laughing, accompanied by 
different emotions, singly or mixed, has been 
stamped into the human race.) Since growth 
seldom, if ever, proceeds in a single line, the 
varieties of laughter have most probably been 
socially educed in radiating lines from a 
centre of growth in sheer relief when a physical 
effort, because no longer required, is suddenly 
relaxed. 
The ‘mechanical motion” of laughing 
continues the fundamental connection of 
all thought with physical action. When the 
final stroke is given, the successful striker 
must still act: there is nothing for him to do 
—so he laughs. The ludicrous situation is 
similar enough to this, though it may have 
little apparent connection with activity of 
body, to produce the same act of laughing.

CHAPTER VII 
LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
Ir “the feeling of the ridiculous produces an 
immense effect upon human affairs ’’“*, human 
affairs also work very decisively upon laughter. 
Almost any human act or thought is, in 
principle, an index of character, and such 
indexes have been sought everywhere, in- 
cluding dreams and handwriting. One 
written sentence might reveal a whole char- 
acter to an omniscient intelligence, as an 
omniscient anatomist might reconstruct a 
whole animal from a single vertebra. But 
the perfect construction is possible only if the 
relations between the whole body and a single 
vertebra are known completely, and the 
significance of handwriting for deducing char- 
acter resembles the anatomical value of a 
vertebra for one who only knows that it 
signifies a backbone. Laughter is a more 
promising index, for the way men laugh and 
the things they laugh at reflect their tastes, 
thoughts, and sympathies. On a wider scale 
society offers its pulse in the nature of its 
85  
-P-A-G-E-92
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
laughter, and the fortunes of laughter reflect 
the movements of civilization. Laughter is 
a good consultant for the inquirer into human 
history if the consulting is discreet and con- 
ducted without forgetting that its revelation 
of the human mind is neither complete nor 
wholly intelligible. : 
Whether or no the “ vigilant comic” is 
truly ‘the first-born of common sense ”’ "**, 
which is doubtful, or ‘‘a sense of humour ”’ 
necessarily ‘‘implies balanced common 
sense’? 4°, which is disputable, laughter is 
often a pertinent commentary on the funda- 
mental judgments of a community. Since 
“common sense”’ is a chameleon phrase, it 
must be fixed to one meaning in this context. 
Physical position very obviously determines 
judgment and controls opinion. The sun 
seems to a watcher on the earth to move round 
him, and the reverse is obvious to a careful 
observer on Mars. In a wider sense Vol- 
taire’s Micromegas and man have entirely 
different standpoints: the one can creep 
among atoms to explore them, the other 
moves among grosser bodies and knows atoms 
only by inference. There is psychical position 
as there is physical position, for the estimates 
of any particular community depend upon its 
fundamental beliefs and ideas. Men’s opin- 
ions vary with their general psychical stand- 
point. A limping Tatungolung man told Mr 
Howitt that an enemy had buried a piece of 
86 ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
sharp glass in his foot-print’7. His pre- 
conceptions ascribed his pains to magical 
influence; Mr MHowitt’s preconceptions 
ascribed them to rheumatism. The general 
psychical standpoint of a community, or 
collection of spontaneous opinions and 
behaviours springing from this standpoint, 
is, in one meaning, its ‘common sense ’’. 
On this psychical position, the laughter of 
any community often throws a fitful light, 
both by the occasions that prompt it and by 
those that quell it. 
The character and temperament of an age, 
as well as its common sense, are reflected in 
its laughter, and changes in habits of laughing 
are a moving index of the course of civilization. 
If the tooth of time had spared the “ various 
kinds of jokes ’’ enumerated by Aristotle in 
his lost “treatise on poetry’’, there would 
have been a little more light on the manners 
of his time. ‘‘Some of them ”’, he remarks, 
“are suited to gentlemen, but not all”’. 
Unfortunately only his advice to be “ careful 
then to make use of none but such as are 
appropriate to your character” remains. 
We do know, however, that he considered 
irony “ more gentlemanly than buffoonery ’**. 
The comic warfare of the practical joke is 
luxuriant in The Arabian Nights’ Entertain- 
ments. Its “ mischievous adventure ”’ revels 
in the deceived lover who was first beguiled 
into shaving his eyebrows and stripping off 
87 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
his clothes, then turned into a wandering 
passage, and finally plumped into the street 
through a trap-door. The Thousand and One 
Nights are full of such rough, unfeeling pract- 
ical jokes that represent the manners of the 
East and, as Hazlitt remarks, ‘carry the 
principle of callous indifference in jest as far 
as it can go” #9, 
The jests are too spiced with malice and 
the organized practical joking too obviously 
a comic copy of stark battle for the degree 
of the sense of the ludicrous in The Arabian 
Nights to be confidently appraised. How far, 
the inquirer asks, is there sheer glee over physi- 
cal discomfiture and how far is there purely 
comic perception? If Hazlitt applied his 
scale, merely laughable-ludicrous-ridiculous**, 
how would it record? Children’s laughter is 
similarly problematic. We may be too prone 
to attribute to ancient mirth as sharpened a 
sense of the ludicrous as our own. The 
laughter at personal misfortunes, especially 
when jestingly inflicted, suggests a coarse 
echo of triumph in battle more than a nicer 
sense of the comic. 
Laughter at serious discomfiture, or even 
at physical injury, has not absorbed 
sympathy any more than it is dissociated 
from its fundamental situation of physical 
action. The glee of the practical joke springs 
from successful action by the joker and is 
shared by the approving spectator. When 
88 
oe a
-P-A-G-E-95
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
satire substitutes mental discomfiture for 
physical, though it can vie with practical 
jesting in cruelty, it also can refine laughter 
and diminish its animus. One step passes 
from the practical joker who mauls his victim 
to the spectator who laughs at the mauling ; 
another ‘step passes from the participating 
spectator to the satirist who drops physical 
violence out and mauls his victim mentally. 
In the “ poetry of invective’, as Aristotle 
calls it, systematic satirical attack replaces 
the organized comic warfare of physical 
discomfiture. Aristotle has scattered through 
his Poetics hints at a humanization in Greek 
comedy. Homer, he says, outlined the 
general forms of comedy by substituting 
“a dramatic picture of the Ridiculous” for 
“dramatic invective’. When writers began 
to write comedies they soon preferred the 
humaner example of Homer to the coarser 
method. “ Laughter without offence ”’, wrote 
Hobbes, “‘ must be at the absurdities and in- 
firmities abstracted from persons...’’. This 
abstraction from persons marks an extrusion 
of animus from laughter, and it seems clear 
that Aristotle meant personal satirical attack 
by ‘dramatic invective’? and impersonal 
comic castigation by ‘“‘a dramatic picture of 
the Ridiculous’. Thus, when Homer rejected 
the former and adopted the latter, he removed 
“ offence ” from laughter by avoiding person- 
alities. Aristotle clearly traces this satirical 
89
-P-A-G-E-96
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
softening in Crates, who, he says, was the 
first Athenian poet to frame general and non- 
personal stories and drop the “ comedy of 
invective’. Without any rash deduction 
from Aristotle’s further incidental remark that 
in comedy ‘‘ the bitterest enemies walk off 
good friends at the end” he may be said to 
intimate plainly a humanization of organized 
comic laughter from personal attack to non- 
personal display of the ridiculous. 
Aristotle seemed to sense an unkind tendency 
in the laughter of his day when he says of the 
young that “they are fond of laughter and 
consequently facetious, facetiousness being dis- 
ciplined insolence”’ +, 
Fear may expel personal invective from 
laughter, as Dr Johnson’s big stick deterred 
Foote from stage-caricature, and too many 
complex currents flow in human life for 
simple judgments to be safe. But other 
mitigations of satirical savagery have repeated 
the supersession of personal invective by 
Homer and Crates. The satire of the age of 
Dryden and Pope suggests a conversion of 
the physical buffoonery of The Arabian Nights 
into mental buffoonery. It has all the zest 
and all the malice of a fisticuff bout and it 
rejoices as fervently in humiliation or mis- 
fortune as the most brutal of practical jokes. 
Meredith’s description of the Comic Spirit, 
though it may be an ideal not always attained 
and perhaps has more aloof coldness than

LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
human warmth, expresses the extrusion of 
acerbity from comedy. It does not drive, 
like satire, into ‘‘ quivering sensibilities ”’, 
unpretentious poverty excites in it no con- 
temptuous laugh, and its laughter is “ of the 
order of the smile, finely tempered, showing 
sunlight of the mind, mental richness rather 
than noisy enormity’’***. Personal invective, 
the satirical successor to the rough jest of 
physical discomfiture, steadily tends to dis- 
appear from laughter as civilization is steadily 
permeated by sympathy. It seems clear that 
vindictiveness has been progressively banished 
from the laugh with the march of civilization, 
though it clings to it still and often embitters 
it 
Civilization, according to Sydney Smith,. 
improves the humour of the body into the 
humour of the mind**. ‘The emancipation of 
the laugh from physical situations where 
actual physical violence or discomfiture of 
body was the prime source of the comic and 
other less refined satisfactions is an important 
element in the development of laughter. 
Those writers who have emphasized the 
influence of social milieu upon the fortunes of 
laughter assist us to realize that laughter has 
been no more fixed than man himself. Like 
man himself, like his language, like his thought, 
like even his emotional susceptibilities, for 
though his emotional equipment is one of 
his most unchanging characters, he is not the 
gt
-P-A-G-E-98
LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
same emotionally as during his first days upon 
earth, laughter has grown and developed. 
Laughter has not, like the lingula, or tongue- 
shell, remained an unmoved spectator of the 
stream of change. ‘Theorists sometimes forget 
that the central relief of laughter has made it 
sensitive to changes in the laughter. 
Society multiplied the laughter that arose 
first from an interruption of physical effort in 
individuals by widely extending its occasions. 
Amused laughter, according to Sydney Smith, 
was similarly multiplied by that aspect of 
society usually described as civilization. 
“ Civilization’ is a word that must be used 
with a reliance on the reader’s discrimination 
rather than on an ability to define it. Civil- 
ization improves humour, he says, from 
humour of the body into humour of the mind, 
and this improvement results from an in- 
creased demand for humour***. ‘‘ Humour ” 
denotes in Sydney Smith’s writings, it seems 
tight to say, ‘‘ amused” laughter: it implies 
neither sympathy, though it may be sympath- 
etic, nor a sense of the ludicrous dispassion- 
ately free from both sympathy and animus, 
nor an absence of acrimony. It is laughter at 
the ludicrous. He does say, in one place, that 
humour may be confined to instances of the 
tidiculous excited by character, but he adds 
“there is an incongruous not observable in 
character which produces the feeling of 
humour’ +57, and the sense of his word 
92 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
“humour” is nearly always laughter of 
amusement or laughter at the comical. 
Different writers differently describe the 
social conditions that favour the rise of 
laughter which is:more humane, less tied to 
activity or posture of body, more refined and 
more sharpened into nice apprehension. 
Meredith requires for the “‘ Comic poet” a 
cultivated society with quick perceptions, a 
community without giddiness, a period free 
from feverish emotion and a reasonable 
equality between the sexes*. Sydney 
Smith’s recipe for humour is nakedly simple, 
unpretentious, and perhaps suggestive of sly 
jesting, for it is—idleness. “‘ There are 
several meanings included under the term 
civilization: it means, having better cups 
and saucers than we had a century or two 
ago; better laws, better manners; and it 
means, also, having nothing to do,—and those 
who have nothing to do, must either be amused 
or expire with gaping” ¥°. 
If “great persons that have their minds 
employed on great designs have not leisure 
enough to laugh”, as Hobbes thought, 
Sydney Smith may have told the truth. 
Idleness is of two kinds, however: the one 
numbing, the other fruitful. It numbs when 
it is a permanent habit or condition. The 
idling habit may be so indurated as to be an 
actual disease. The members of one family, 
93 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
    LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
men and women, were content to sit for a 
whole day almost as motionless as statues, 
without reading or sewing or playing any 
game, even without talking. They did not 
sleep ; they rose to eat, and sat down again 
to idle; if they thought, their thoughts are 
unknown. ‘The most elementary “ humour ” 
could not grow in such a soil. But there is 
an idleness which is fruitful because it is a 
systematic part of an efficient life. A graphic 
passage in Moby Dick describes an attack 
upon a whale by the crew of a whaling-boat. 
The harpooner, upon whose skill and strength 
in striking the whale the success and safety 
of the crew depended, rowed the foremost oar. 
When the boat was near enough to the whale 
for him to cast his harpoon, his strength had 
been spent on his oar, and he had to seize his 
weapon, aim with what steadiness he could, 
and throw with any of his strength that 
remained. ‘‘ To ensure the greatest efficiency 
in the dart’’, comments Hermann Melville, 
“the harpooners of this world must start to 
their feet out of idleness, and not out of toil ’’. 
Now if by ‘idleness’ be meant moments of 
relaxation, periods of relief that are not merely 
protracted inactivity, Sydney Smith hit on a 
truth. 
Leisure in a society, like a holiday in an 
individual, may stir a jocund mood, and 
humour may spring from a diffusion of 
leisurely subdued hilarity, as laughter, 
94
-P-A-G-E-101
  
LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
according to Voltaire, always springs from a 
gaiety of disposition:". Hilarity, however, is 
not usually discriminating in its jokes, while 
leisured societies are presumed to be as 
polished in their laughter as they are in their 
manners. The spirit of carnival, which is 
hilarity at its height, has a feature in common 
with diffusion of leisure: it wunshackles 
laughter. Since there is no permanent 
demand by seriousness, any slight call on 
attention is readily followed by relief, and a 
general happiness of mood adds zest to 
laughing. Hilarity laughs often and it laughs 
loudly ; leisured societies also laugh often if 
more discreetly, but the keenest laughter, 
which contains the fullest flavour of humour 
or the most intense sense of absurdity, prob- 
ably arises when “great persons that have 
their minds employed on great designs’ do 
find momentary leisure to laugh, or when an 
active community rests, like the ideal har- 
pooner, for its next effort. Laughter, which 
is always a descent, is most welcome, as it is 
most worthy, when it falls from a height. 
Mr Max Beerbohm has expressed this truth 
by choosing to sit with Johnson at the Turk’s 
Head instead of with Falstaff at the Boar’s. 
“ Falstaff is but a sublimated example of the 
‘funny man’ ”’’, and, though the agility of his 
mind is effectively contrasted by the massive- 
ness of his body, Johnson’s sallies have a 
“noble weight of character behind them ”’ 1%, 
95   
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
The humour of Shakespeare, as this comparison 
reminds us, arose in an age of adventure and 
achievement. A gentle, genial leisure, if it 
does produce more laughter than moments 
of quiet in vigorous action, produces it less 
vigorously. ‘This vigour may become boister- 
ousness, as hilarity is often boisterous, but 
vitality is always welcome, for it can be toned 
into strong nicety of apprehension more easily 
than the languid laughter of otiose repose can 
be stirred into vigour. ‘There is always some 
danger that even laughter, like other old 
institutions, may die of dignity. 
Whether ‘“‘in the early ages of this world 
there was far more laughter than is to be 
heard now ”’, and whether it has simply given 
place to the more dignified smile?*, or has 
actually diminished, civilization seems to have 
increased and spread sympathetic laughter, 
and a sharpened sense of the ludicrous has 
probably accompanied this multiplication. 
Humorous laughter, in the sense of a sym- 
pathetic sense of the ludicrous, is one index 
of civilized habit. In the very earliest human 
age of the world, if society has developed an 
original laughter of sheer physical relief into 
a protean spirit, laughter was less frequent. 
Whether or no laughter will participate in 
the usual cycle of life, so observable in all that 
grows, and after waxing into lusty youth from 
a feeble beginning, mature, wane into old 
age, and die; if it has become more sym- 
96
-P-A-G-E-103
LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
pathetic and more sensitive to the ludicrous, 
there is probably some fostering tendency in 
the civilization it accompanies. For laughter 
will be essentially what man makes it, though 
since reciprocity pervades life, man will also 
be, in some measure, what laughter makes 
him. 
Any community, writes Professor Flinders 
Petrie, has civilization when it lives justly, 
securely, tolerantly, and with knowledge. 
These four qualities are connected. Men feel 
secure if they know they will be treated 
justly ; when they have security against 
injustice they can be tolerant, though they do 
not always tolerate; though knowledge is 
power and is often abused, it does steadily 
promote the humaner traits in mankind. The 
emphasis for the present discussion must fall 
on ‘security’. If Sydney Smith’s recipe of 
“idleness” is modified into “security ’’, to 
which it is akin though not identical with it, 
the humanizing influence of civilization upon 
laughter seems to be disclosed. Though 
laughter is less a positive act of ‘‘ joyous 
surrender”? than a spontaneous token of 
freedom, it requires some sort of liberty. It 
arises essentially in a situation of relief. 
When belligerency rules, the laugh is naturally 
an expression of triumph as the foe is disarmed. 
or slain, or of contempt for a menace that is 
impotent. Belligerent laughters of different 
grades, from battle-triumph to unkind jesting, 
97 G
-P-A-G-E-104
  LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
will naturally prevail when a latent enmity 
pervades a rough-and-tumble society. As 
security grows, doubly provided byactual social 
coercion or the strong arm of the law, and bythe 
restraint flowing from good feeling and fellow- 
ship, since provocation is less, the hostility of 
laughter is less too. As the situation of relief 
that results in laughter becomes less frequently 
freedom from hostility, it will naturally result 
in more genial laughter. Men still struggle 
with one another ; they still wage fierce wars ; 
and they still compete in politics, in trade, 
in industry, in providing entertainment, and 
even in talk. There are still competitive 
elements to tinge the situation of relief, and 
thence to tinge laughter with superiority 
and even with contempt or triumph. But 
civilized men have learned both to subdue 
their hostilities and to submerge them in 
fellow-feeling. The result is apparent in their 
laughter, for laughter distinctly seems to be 
more kindly, as it also seems to be more 
distinctly sensitive to the ludicrous, in the 
amusement of the new world than in the 
amusement of the old. 
There may be, it seems almost certain that 
there is, a connection between civilized width 
of knowledge and the sharpening of the ludi- 
crous sense. The comic sense develops in the 
child as its experience opens its mind to the 
perception of those incongruities that are the 
soul of the ludicrous. Many writers agree 
98
-P-A-G-E-105
LAUGHTER AND CIVILIZATION 
upon this. Infancy and childhood | offer 
historical hints, though children do not 
meticulously repeat the story of their race. 
The same growth of comic perception as 
occurs in the child seems to be evident in the 
growth of the human race. In one aspect 
the development of knowledge and experience 
is a growth in discrimination, and a growth 
in discrimination would seem to be naturally 
associated with a more delicate perception of 
incongtuities. 
International turbulence must not be 
allowed to deceive us into believing that 
civilization has resulted in no humanization. 
Civilization has increased the security that 
flows from mutual goodwill, though it has not 
made all men into friends. ‘This increase of 
mutual security through fellowship is reflected 
in a humanization of laughter. Civilization 
has also widened human minds, though there 
is much widening yet to do. ‘This widening, 
with its associated increase in discrimination, 
has sharpened the sense of the ludicrous and 
profoundly modified laughter. 
99

  CHAPTER VIII 
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
THE situation of relief in which laughter arises 
and from which its emotional quality is 
received according to the nature of the relief 
is also a source of a specific and pervasive 
emotional colouring that constantly diffuses 
through laughing and tends to dominate it. 
Relief is a break, and the two sides of the 
break constitute an incongruity. The sense 
of the ludicrous has been connected by a large 
company of writers with a perception of the 
incongruous. The great unanimity of this 
verdict suggests one definite step in analysis. 
A single disclosure of feature under scrutiny, 
though only one step in analysis, is still an 
advance. Even when the power of the poppy 
was merely ascribed to a “‘ soporific principle ” 
fruitful analysis began. ‘There is a difference 
between sedative or narcotic efficacy lodged 
in the whole poppy and that lodged in a part 
of it. When chemistry followed the clue of a 
“ soporific principle”, it discovered morphia 
and its associated alkaloids ; when it learned 
100
-P-A-G-E-107
  
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
how to assess medicinal value by assaying 
the alkaloidal content of opium, it justified 
the fruitfulness of assuming a “ soporific 
principle’’. The simple recognition of in- 
congruity in ludicrous things or situations 
may be similarly fruitful though it seems a 
meagre result of much thought. The com- 
bination of relief and incongruity on which 
amused laughter finally depends advances 
analysis a little further. Even if the result 
is still meagre, and most writers sympathize 
yet with Quintilian’s plaint that many trials 
have failed to explain satisfactorily what 
laughter is‘, it is important to hold firmly 
to what can be known. ‘The sense of the 
ludicrous appears to originate in the apprecia- 
tion of an incongruity that forms, as it were, 
the two sides of a situation of relief. Amuse- 
ment, in its sense of laughter at the ludicrous, 
is a familiar, unique, and prevalent emotion ; 
it may be, in itself, indefinable like all emo- 
tions, and only analysable, so far as it is analys- 
able, again like all emotions, by describing 
its occasions. These occasions appear to be 
situations which are broken into incon- 
gruities by sudden relief. 
Unfortunately, the original source, “ orig- 
inal”’ in a literary sense and as far as any source 
is perfectly primary, of analyses of the ludi- 
crous has been largely dried up. Aristotle’s 
separate treatment of “ humour” has been 
lost, and only the hints he has scattered

  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
through his extant writings, mainly in the 
rhetoric and poetics, remain. The locus 
classicus of Aristotle’s theory of the ridiculous 
runs thus: “ As for Comedy, it is (as has been 
observed) an imitation of men worse than the 
average ; worse, however, not as regards any 
and every sort of fault, but only as regards 
one particular kind, the Ridiculous, which is 
a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may 
be defined as a mistake or a deformity not 
productive of pain or harm to others; the 
mask, for instance, that excites laughter, is 
something ugly and distorted without causing 
pain’’'**, This passage recognizes the double 
factor of incongruity and relief in the ludi- 
crous. The ugly disturbs what would other- 
wise be the order, symmetry, rhythm, and 
harmony that Aristotle assigns to the beauti- 
ful'*?: mistakes and deformities are incon- 
gruous with their context. The comic mask 
calls the mind to attention : inciting curiosity 
to stir the mind and prepare the body for 
action, for the possibility of a demand on 
physical effort lurks in all moments of mental 
tension, since the mind was primarily devel- 
oped to participate in bodily behaviour 
towards persons and things. The sharp call 
contains a hint of menace, or, at least, of an 
occasion for decision and action, as all sharp 
appeals to the mind, because of the funda- 
mentally practical nature of life, contain it. 
Then the mask is realized as a show without 
102
-P-A-G-E-109
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
substance—the tension falls, and relief follows. 
The absence of pain and danger permits 
relapse into relief, and the sharp contrast 
between the appearance of danger and assur- 
ance of safety stirs a sense of the ludicrous. 
Aristotle may have thought of the incon- 
gruities in the mask itself as well as of the 
incongruousness diffused through the whole 
situation. A large nose on a comic mask 
rouses the mind to contemplate a large face ; 
the unexpectedly diminutive face requires less 
than anticipation expected and an apprecia- 
tion of incongruity permitted by relief again 
stirs a feeling of the ludicrous. 
Coleridge’s paraphrase of Aristotle runs: 
“T think Aristotle has already excellently 
defined the laughable, 73 yeroiov, as con- 
sisting of, or depending on, what is out of 
its proper time and place, yet without danger 
or pain.”” The impropriety, he adds, is the 
positive, and the dangerlessness the negative, 
qualification’**. This circles round an analy- 
sis of amused laughter as a sharp sense of 
incongruity, the impropriety, permitted by, 
or suffused with, relief, the sense of danger- 
lessness. Incongruities too strongly spiced 
with menace, when a call of sensed danger 
drops, may hinder the flow of ludicrous feeling. 
The whizz of an arrow past the ear favours an 
emotion of relief more than a grin at the fun 
of the thing. Whether Aristotle considered 
the dissipated menace of the mask chiefly 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
important, or not, for the ludicrousness of the 
situation, he knew that the ludicrous does not 
require a situation spiced by menace. “ And 
the same is true of what Theodorus calls 
“novel phrases’, i.e. phrases in which the 
sequel is unexpected and not, as he expresses 
it, ‘according to previous expectation’, but 
such as comic writers use when they alter 
the forms of words. The effect of jokes 
depending upon changes of letters is the same ; 
they deceive the expectation. Nor are these 
jokes found only in prose—they occur also 
in verses where the conclusion is not such as 
the audience expected, e.g. 
And as he walked, beneath his feet 
Were—chilblains, 
whereas the audience expected the writer to 
say sandals.” The “ deceived expectation ”’, 
destined for fame in many later theories of 
laughter, thus stepped into its role in the very 
beginning. It obviously contains an incon- 
gruity. Aristotle also hints distinctly at the 
element of relaxation in the sense of the 
ludicrous. “Similarly, as amusement and 
relaxation of every kind and humour are 
pleasant ...”’: humour is implicitly included 
among situations of relief. ‘‘ We are placable 
when we are in such a condition as is opposed 
to angry feeling, e.g. at a time of sport or 
laughter or festivity or in the enjoyment of 
prosperity or success’ '**: the relief in 
IO4
-P-A-G-E-111
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
laughter is exposed by contrast with the 
tenseness of anger and suggested in the 
enumeration of its associates. 
These hints scattered by Aristotle can be 
constructed into a deceived expectation 
dropping into relief. The sense of the ludi- 
crous also perceives the deceit as an incon- 
gruity. In amused laughter deceived ex- 
pectation is also relieved and an incongruous 
contrast is perceived. 
All morally wrong actions can be con- 
veniently regarded as varieties of stealing. 
Deceit, for instance, is robbing people of truth 
and calumny takes away their reputations, 
as literal stealing deprives them of a material 
possession. If this method of statement is 
neither pressed too far nor taken too literally, 
it gives a convenient mental grip on moral 
wrong. ‘The many provocations of the sense 
of the ludicrous can be similarly regarded as 
different ways of deceiving expectation, for 
convenience of mental grip and without 
insisting on the literal truth of the assertion. 
The converse of the proposition that every 
ludicrous situation practises a deception on 
expectancy is not true, and Aristotle, no 
doubt, knew that news of defeat when victory 
is expected is not laughable. 
If expectancy of mind is compared to the 
physical preparation of body which precedes 
each action, like the bracing of muscles before 
105
-P-A-G-E-112
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
lifting a weight or the constantly changing 
poses of a tennis-player as he makes his 
strokes, a deceived expectation is analogous 
to the arrest of a prepared action. The 
ludicrously incongruous is a break in the 
smooth flow of attention, comparable to the 
relief that breaks the continuity of action. 
The break, in either instance, may be rapid, 
the summons to attention or effort being 
promptly called off, or it may be deferred. 
The sense of the ludicrous springing from the 
mental interruption of attention corresponds 
to the sense of relief springing from inter- 
ruption of physical effort or of preparation for 
it. The sense of sheer relief that has been 
assumed to represent the physical situation 
is mental or conscious in the wide sense. But 
the sense of interrupted mental attention is 
lodged, so to speak, more in the heart of 
consciousness and the sense of the ludicrous 
arises and becomes keener as the situation 
becomes more purely mental by removal from 
the sphere of the physical. When Bergson 
assigns, as conditions for the rise of the comic, 
the imposition of silence on emotion and 
exclusive play for intelligence1”°, he probably 
thinks of the perception of incongruity con- 
tained in the sense of the ludicrous. There is 
not merely a break in the flow of verified ex- 
pectancy, as there may be a feeling of break 
in the continuity of action, nor merely a break, 
but an apprehension by intelligence that a 
106
-P-A-G-E-113
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
break has occurred. The sense of the ludi- 
crous cettainly seems to have a characteristic 
emotional accompaniment which can be 
connected with the incidence of the break, 
corresponding to the sudden relaxation 
through interrupted effort which is not 
needed—to relief. 
In the illustrative lines quoted by Aristotle 
the hearer’s attention, directed by the words, 
runs smoothly with constantly verified ex- 
pectancy until the word “‘chilblains”. The 
check, at this point, ceases to require devotion 
from expectant attention and no other effort 
is required from it. Expectancy is both 
unverified and satisfied—the purely mental 
situation thus corresponding to a relief of 
physical effort. If expectancy is diverted 
from one preparation of attention to another 
of greater, or even equal, seriousness, the 
ludicrous sense is stifled at birth because there 
is break without relief. 
Herbert Spencer expressed this fundamental 
necessity for relief in the ludicrous break in 
expectancy by describing the occasion of 
laughter as a “‘ descending incongruity”. A 
sneeze in the middle of Beethoven’s symphony 
releases the audience “from an irksome 
attitude of mind’’17. A flow of serious ex- 
pectancy, not necessarily ‘‘irksome”’, follows 
the demand of the music ; then it is suddenly 
unverified, the sneeze satisfies attention for 
the moment, relief blends with a perception 
107
-P-A-G-E-114
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
of the incongruous sides of the break, and a 
laugh, expressing relief and charged with a 
sense of the ludicrous, spreads through the 
audience. 
“The effect of contrast ’’, writes Héfiding, 
“on which the ridiculous depends, results 
from the conjunction of two thoughts or 
impressions, each of which excites a feeling, 
and the second of which razes what the first 
erects”’1, This might be a little homily on 
a text taken from a declaration by Kant 
that laughter appears when an expectation 
suddenly ends in nothing:”. ‘The expectation 
must really end in nothing or, perhaps more 
accurately, in something satisfying that does 
not spur attention. A sense of frustration 
or disappointment will quell joy and destroy 
amusement. It seems preferable to say that 
the deception of expectancy must end in 
telief. 
When Prospero was praising Miranda he 
forestalled Ferdinand’s smile by exclaiming : 
“she will outstrip all praise”. Prospero 
armed himself too anxiously against absurdity, 
for Ferdinand had too much lover’s ecstasy 
to suspect exaggeration in praise of his 
mistress. A cooler auditor might have smiled 
because exaggeration, real or fancied, tends 
to be comical. An angler tells a listener that 
he has caught a very large fish. ‘The listener 
is expectant. “It was so big that ’’—the 
listener is on tiptoes—‘‘ when I pulled it 
108
-P-A-G-E-115
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
out the level of the water in the lake sank two 
feet ’—expectation is disillusioned and the 
listener laughs. Exaggeration deceives ex- 
pectancy by enticing it up higher than it 
should go. When the fraud is discovered, 
promise and performance incongruously con- 
trast, attention relaxes, and amused laughter 
results. The fraud must be soft enough for 
amusement to be a sufficient recompense— 
the exaggerative deceit must end in relief. 
Understatement entices expectation to dis- 
pense with a belief. Discovery of the deceit 
again incongruously contrasts reality and 
appearance. If the mind is satisfied with the 
position from which it has been anticipatively 
enticed, relief makes the deception laughable. 
Aristotle’s distinction between looking up 
to the characters of tragedy and looking down 
on those of comedy 1% suggests a ‘‘ degrada- 
tion’ theory of the ludicrous. A drunken 
man is funny because he traverses human 
dignity. Degradation implies deceived ex- 
pectation : we expect the drunkard to behave 
like a man, and discover that he behaves like 
a sot. If the mind can rest satisfied in the 
descent from serious expectation of dignified 
human behaviour, relief and incongruity 
combine into amusement. Relief is obviously 
necessary because, if it is destroyed by disgust 
or condemnation or pity, the drunkard is not 
ludicrous. Drunkenness, like physical de- 
formity, is being unfrocked as an occasion of 
I0g
-P-A-G-E-116
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
laughter. It steadily tends to provoke only 
the more uncouth varieties of laughing. The 
humanization of laughter is clearly reflected 
in a marked dissociation of the ludicrous from 
the degrading. Pope aimed at a ludicrous 
effort by a reminder that prisoners in Bride- 
well were flogged after morning prayers *’. 
“To most minds’’, comments Bain, “the 
ludicrousness of the conjunction would be 
overborne by another sentiment’ 17°. There 
is no relief for a humane mind in this incon- 
gruous conjunction. Laughter is sensitized to 
human sympathies and preferences through 
its relief, and situations will provoke laughter 
or fail to provoke it as the mind can settle 
comfortably into the relief they provide or 
not. 
Harmless discomposure of dignity is, how- 
ever, still fruitful in laughter. Mr Edwin A. 
Ward had painted a portrait of Mr Scott, the 
chairman of the National Provident Institu- 
tion, and the portrait was presented after a 
complimentary dinner. During the dinner 
the portrait was veiled. Before the unveiling, 
Sir Thomas Chambers, Recorder of the City 
of London, made a speech and asked Mr 
Scott to accept the gift of his portrait. As all 
eyes turned to the concealing curtains every 
mind expected ‘‘the picture of a dignified 
old gentleman of seventy-seven years’’. The 
falling curtains disappointed this expectancy 
of dignity, for the old gentleman was “‘ stand- 
IIo 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
ing on his head, with his legs in the air’ 177. 
The sudden check to expectancy, simply 
produced by inverting a picture, could drop 
from its summons to contemplate dignity 
into a condition of relief. No personal mis- 
chance disturbed the ludicrous situation by 
calling for active sympathy, and relief united 
with perception of incongruity in a volley of 
amused laughter. Such laughter need con- 
tain no hostility, nor need the laughers 
applaud their own exemption from loss of 
dignity. The laughter of such a company, 
indeed, when all were presumably in sympathy 
with the subject of the vicarious indignity, 
was probably humorous in the sense of amuse- 
ment suffused with sympathy. It united 
victim and friends in a common feeling of 
kindliness sharpened into keen enjoyment by 
a common zest in a ludicrous situation. 
There is no contradiction between saying that 
no restraint was imposed on laughter by sym- 
pathies for mischance and saying that a 
suffusion of sympathy converted purely comic 
laughter into humorous. Though the occasion 
called for no pity for misfortune, it excited the 
general sympathetic rapport between all 
members of the company. 
The picture might have been deliberately 
inverted as an insult. A suspicion of this 
would check laughter in the subject of the 
joke, and animus would tinge the triumphant 
laughter of the successful joker. A secret 
III
-P-A-G-E-118
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
enemy in the company would, in any event, 
mix triumph with his amusement. The relief 
of the secret enemy would end deceived 
expectation on satisfied animus. If the sub- 
ject of the joke suspected insult, his checked 
expectancy would be simultaneously solicited 
to contemplate animosity, and there would be 
no telief in the perception of incongruity. 
These possibilities reveal the sensitiveness of 
the incongruous situation to the total con- 
dition of the mind, and, it may be added, in 
terms of general parlance, of the heart. 
Laughter, to repeat, is sensitized through its 
element of relief to its milieu, whether personal 
or social. 
Great pretensions excite great hopes and 
inspire expectancy with respect. Pompous, 
inflated language opens like a trap-door under 
expectation, even as it stirs it with hope, and 
precipitates it into disillusion. The comic 
laugh then peals easily, for pompous promise 
and lean performance are in ludicrous con- 
trast and the mind is eased from effortful 
understanding. Swollen phrases that excite 
expectancy by pretending to be big with 
meaning become instantly laughable when 
they collapse into a description of ordinary 
things. Don Armado had a habit of inviting 
ridicule by adding the plain meaning to define 
its own grandiloquent phrases. ‘Sir, it is 
the King’s most sweet pleasure to con- 
II2 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
gratulate the Princess at her pavilion in the 
posteriors of this day, which the rude mul- 
titude call the afternoon’’17*, When the 
mask is torn from the hypocrite, laughter has 
a great moment. Systematic hypocrisy has 
secured a perpetual tribute of respect, and 
when expectancy turns towards the hypocrite 
it is highly charged with hope; as the mask 
falls the relapse from honour to disgrace 
throws expectancy from such a height that 
sharp contrast and deep relief prompt an 
irresistible sense of the comic. 
The fundamental model on which all 
laughter is built is a situation broken into 
incongruity by relief. In sheer laughter of 
relief perception of incongruity plays a mini- 
mum part. When laughter is purely comic, 
when amusement fills it entirely up, relief 
plays the minimal part and perception of 
incongruity the maximal. ‘The dependence of 
the jest’s prosperity upon the ear depends, 
in purely comic laughter, upon how incon- 
gruities strike the mind behind the ear. The 
geometrical figure of a tangent touching a 
circle does not naturally suggest itself to 
most people as an apt illustration of the 
ludicrous. Yet Schopenhauer chose it1”* to 
illustrate his theory that laughter expresses 
a sudden perception of an incongruity between 
our conceptions of objects and the objects 
themselves?*°. On Schopenhauer’s theory, 
since we expect to find in objects what we 
II3 H 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
think they contain and find they do not, 
expectation is deceived in amused laughter. 
We expect an angle where the tangent touches 
the circle, and there is no angle, because the 
circling line is curved. Absence of relief is no 
hindrance to laughter here—to most people 
the hindrance would be absence of incongruous 
prompting to the comic. But Schopenhauer’s 
perplexing illustration has one very important 
significance. His amusement at this geo- 
metrical figure must have been as pure an 
example of wholly comic laughter as it seems 
possible to find. Here, if anywhere, Bergson’s 
laughter of pure intelligence would be found. 
The sense of amusement appears to contain 
feeling for the ludicrous even when it bubbles 
up at the sight of a straight line touching a 
curved one. But it could hardly be suffused 
or mingled with any emotion that would be 
appropriate to a social situation. The 
deceptive angle, or non-angle, invites neither 
condemnation for false pretences, nor triumph 
over the discovery of its deceit, nor union 
in kindly sympathy with the laugher. If 
Schopenhauer chose the tangent and circle 
as a laughable instance, he was amused at it ; 
if he was amused, he laughed with wholly 
comic laughter ; if his joy was wholly comic, 
there exists, though it is seldom naked, a 
pure sense of the ludicrous, dispassionately 
free from animus on the one hand and from 
sympathy on the other. 
114
-P-A-G-E-121
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
As Schopenhauer chuckles quietly over his 
diagram we may laugh quietly at him for 
chuckling. The situation at once attracts 
contemplative inquirers. Bain might reflect 
that possibly “laughter can be excited... 
against .. . inanimate things that” have 
not “‘ contracted associations of dignity’ by 
“ personification’. He might also wonder 
whether “the occasion of the ludicrous is” 
always “the degradation of some person or 
interest possessing dignity, in circumstances 
that excite no other strong emotion” ™. 
We have already concluded that laughter 
probably did not arise in a social situation 
and probably does not necessarily require to 
personify its inanimate objects. Is Schopen- 
hauer unwittingly accusing his non-angle of 
deceitfulness, as if it were human? Aristotle 
notes that the philosopher expected an angle 
and did not find it. Kant might be doubt- 
ful whether Schopenhauer’s expectation had 
dwindled to nothing. Campbell would exclaim 
to theorizers who identify laughter with 
scoffing “there is no contempt in this geo- 
metrical joke”***. Bergson can hardly per- 
suade us that the quiet chuckle is pure 
intelligence empty of emotion : Schopenhauer 
is amused—he does not merely perceive a non- 
angle where an angle should be. 
Our own laughter seems to be humorous. We 
can hardly despise Schopenhauer for extract- 
ing a joke from a bald bit of geometry, and 
II5
-P-A-G-E-122
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
there seems to be a link of sympathy between 
him and us. One of the inquiring circle has 
denied that humour is simply “a lively sense 
of the comic tempered by kindly feeling’, 
and defined it as ‘“‘a more subtle, delicately 
discriminating sense of incongruity ’’1*. But 
Schopenhauer seems to hint distinctly at a 
purely comic sense, which may be sharply 
discriminative of incongruity, into which 
amusement, a sense of the ludicrous, and no 
other emotion, enters. When we laugh at the 
naiveté of a child, amused at the contrast 
between its immaturity and the maturity to 
come, sympathy seems to pervade our 
laughter. Our laughing binds him to us. 
This seems to be humorous laughter. Nice, 
appreciative discrimination of incongruity is 
cold, as all purely intellectual operation is 
cold. Even the sense of amusement which 
throbs in comic perception has not the warmth 
of human sympathy that we seem to discover 
in humorous laughter. George Eliot allows 
‘‘a high degree of humour to practical jokes,” 
and defines only higher forms of humour “as 
the sympathetic presentation of incongruous 
elements in human nature and life’. 
“Humour ’”’ here means amusement or sense of 
the ludicrous : in practical joking it co-operates 
with animus or the spirit of successful attack : 
it is sympathetic in higher forms which corre- 
spond to “humour” as the word is used in 
this book. ‘The word “ humour ”’ is now used 
very generally to denote any laughter at the 
r16
-P-A-G-E-123
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
ludicrous, and many writers mean by it any 
kind of laughter whatever. 
“ Humour ” is thus used to-day to mean the 
sense of the ludicrous, amusement, and usually 
implies that all laughter is essentially amused. 
But if relief is fundamental in the laughable 
situation the varieties of laughter are not 
merely different methods of greeting the 
ludicrous?*. Triumph is part of triumphant 
laughter, as contempt is part of contemptuous 
laughter. The pure laughters of greeting or 
of play seem to contain, per se, no comic or 
ludicrous sense. Delight in physical discom- 
fiture seems to be the major element in 
coarse practical joking and horseplay. Hilar- 
ious laughter is often but lightly touched with 
comic perception. If the cruder laughters 
are but methods of greeting the ludicrous, 
they are clumsy machineries for the purpose. 
Laughter so laden with feelings other than 
amusement itself can hardly be a reaction 
specifically appropriated and originally arising 
to express the sense of the ludicrous. If 
telief is the primary fact in laughter the sense 
of the ludicrous, which depends upon intel- 
lectual apprehension of the incongruity in the 
break by relief, will be the later comer and 
will tend to pervade every form of laughing. 
The mechanics and physiology of the physical 
act of laughing affirm, and examinations of 
the occasions of laughter confirm, the primacy 
of relief in laughter. 
The character of any laugh depends on the 
117
-P-A-G-E-124
    LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
fall of emphasis in the situation. In sheer 
laughter of relief the emphasis falls on the 
break; in purely comic laughter it falls on 
the perception of the incongruity forming, as 
it were, the sides of the break. In triumphant 
laughter the satisfaction of victory predomin- 
ates. There is opportunity for comic apprecia- 
tion in these violent forms of laughter, since 
there is incongruousness in the quick change 
of situation, but the ludicrous sense has most 
opportunity in less stormy varieties of 
laughing. The insistence by some writers on 
the mental sources of laughter and Bergson’s 
exaggerated estimate of the comic sense as 
devoid of emotion have sensed the quietened 
“mechanical motion’? that is associated 
with ludicrous perception. Laughter tends 
to quieten, as it tends to refine, when it passes 
from the service of coarser emotion to the 
service of the comic. Comic perception has 
crept steadily into laughter as history has 
tolled on. Humanization of thought and 
feeling, by forbidding vindictive occasions 
and expelling vindictive elements from laugh- 
able situations, has fostered laughter at the 
ludicrous. ‘The rise in security from vindict- 
iveness, as civilized men feel safer because 
social repression and diffusion of mutual 
good will diminish aggressiveness, encourages 
inoffensive laughter. It is quite possible 
that civilized sharpening of the ludicrous 
sense may disturb our apprehension of much 
ancient mirth, and perhaps of some modern. 
118 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
We may misread ludicrousness into jollity 
or jocular aggression. Ruder laughters may 
be more purely uproarious paeans of mimic 
jesting warfare than our preoccupation with 
amused laughter allows us to perceive. Now, 
since laughters are various and contain the 
sense of the ludicrous, when it is present, in 
many different settings, it seems right to 
single out humorous laughter as a variety in 
which comic perception is combined with 
links of sympathy among the laughers. When 
one person laughs simultaneously at and with 
another, and especially if there is more “ with” 
than “at”, his laughter, and indeed the 
laughter of both, seems to deserve the special 
title of “humour”. Comic laughter, then, 
is amused laughter containing feeling of the 
ludicrous. If may be pte, and when thus: dis- 
passionately free from animus or Sympathy is 
comic laughter par excellence ; it may be mixed 
with triumph or contempt or other emotions, 
and, according to predominance of feeling, may 
be classed as triumphant, contemptuous, and 
the like. When amused laughter participates 
sympathetically in the ludicrous situation it 
can be properly described as ‘‘ humour ’’. 
Bain considered humour ‘“‘ something genial 
and loving’’, and, though he affirmed “ an 
element of degradation ’’ in all humour, even 
the most genial, ‘‘ the indignity is disguised, 
and, as it were, oiled, by some kindly infusion, 
such as would not consist with the unmiti- 
IIg
-P-A-G-E-126
LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
gated glee of triumphant superiority’ 1*. 
Bain does not shut his eyes to the constant 
hankering of the laugh after the closed fist. 
Writers who recognize clearly the development 
of laughter and allow for it in their exposi- 
tion usually regard humour as sympathetic 
laughter. In the mixed feeling of humour, 
according to Sully, ‘‘crowing” laughter is 
further softened and disguised by an admixture 
of feelings giving worth to the object and more 
especially affection and sympathy'*’. Sully 
does not forget that the competitive spirit is 
too much abroad in human life for laughter to 
escape easily from it. ‘‘ The feeling of the 
ridiculous ’’, writes Hoffding, “‘ with a substra- 
tum of sympathy is what is called humour ’’1**. 
There is clearly an inclination to define 
humour as a sympathetic sense of the ludi- 
crous and, equally obviously, a reluctance to 
admit that laughter is ever, in the full sense, 
humorous. If comic laughter were ever full 
of sympathy and completely purged from every 
relic of animus, interpretation of opinion 
might run, it would be humour. The varieties 
of laughter mingle very freely, and pure 
humour is perhaps relatively scarce. But 
laughter is often humorous enough to justify 
the discrimination of humour as a definite 
species of laughter. The source of amused 
laughter is an incongruity that deceives 
expectation and drops attention into relief; 
humorous laughter adds sympathetic linkage 
to perception of the comic. 
120
-P-A-G-E-127
  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
Precise definitions are lacking in the termin- 
ology of laughter and terms are used somewhat 
indiscriminately. The word “jest ’’ perhaps 
sounds more harshly than “joke” in some 
ears because it suggests a traditional con- 
nection with roughness and foolery. But 
different writers probably sense the difference, 
as they may do also in other instances, 
differently. Some may regard the words 
“ridiculous ”’ and “ ludicrous ”’ as equivalents, 
and perhaps add that the former is displacing 
the latter. The use of “ludicrous’’ in this 
book has relied on the intuition of the reader 
and must continue to rely on it. It does 
not mean either derisive or humorous laughter, 
as its meaning is alternatively given in The 
New English Dictionary. This will now be 
clear. The New Enghsh Dictionary favours 
the use of “ridiculous” to express the acme 
of ludicrousness and this, with a qualification, 
is probably the best way to use the word. 
There must be a qualification because the 
notion of the preposterous, which attaches 
to excessive ludicrousness, implies something 
logically absurd. It seems possible and right 
to reserve the word “ ridiculous ”’ for a com- 
bination of the sense of the ludicrous with a 
logical condemnation. The purely comic or 
purely ludicrous need arouse no comment— 
the experience is amusing and provokes sheer 
comic emotion. A ridiculous statement is 
ludicrous and false—ludicrous in its falseness 
or false in its ludicrousness, as you will.

  LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
Hazlitt distinguished the “‘ merely laughable ” 
as “an accidental contradiction between our 
expectations and the event”, from the 
ludicrous, where the contradiction is “‘ height- 
ened by some deformity or inconvenience ’’, 
and both from the ridiculous in which as 
“the highest degree of the laughable ”’, there 
is a departure from common sense and reason 
and not merely from custom**. ‘This agrees 
fairly well with a definition of the ridiculous ~ 
as a ludicrous exposure of foolishness, and the 
history and present usage of the word con- 
forms well to this meaning. ‘The ridiculous, 
then, when the word is used advisedly, 
should mean both ludicrous and silly. 
One word usually included in the vocabulary 
of laughter troubles the theorist. Traill1#° 
contrasted the display of incongruity by 
humour with the revelation of an unsuspected. 
similarity by wit. ‘This definition of wit is 
very usual, and it seriously disturbs the 
serenity of the conclusion that amused laughter. 
is necessarily prompted by an incongruity. 
If witticisms flourish on congruencies and are 
ludicrous, the relief-incongruity theory of the 
comic may survive as an explanation of 
amused laughter, but it will obviously require 
ingenious manipulation. The sequel will 
avoid this ingenious manipulation by denying 
that wit, as such, is amusing. It will also 
modify Traill’s definition, though, since wit 
122
-P-A-G-E-129
   LAUGHTER AND THE LUDICROUS 
certainly flourishes on comparisons without 
always requiring them, this modification is 
not so relevant to the major issue. 
A preliminary hint of the relation between 
wit and comic laughter will be a convenient 
finish to the conclusion that amused laughter 
always depends on a situation presenting both 
incongruity and relief. An aggressive witti- 
cism, like the sword-stroke that ends a fight, 
produces a sudden relief. So does the illum- 
inating witticism that reveals a truth. The 
relief is not the wit, as the relief of victory 
is not the sword-stroke that secures it. 
Wit also incidentally results in incongruities. 
Amused laughter can arise from the relief and 
the incongruities in close connection with wit 
without being part of it. This hint will 
indicate that the frequent conjunction of wit 
and amused laughter need not be fatal to 
the relief-incongruity theory of the ludicrous, 
though further justification must now be given. 
Traill thought that laughter often accom- 
panies wit because dissimilarities are simul- 
taneously exposed by the witty revelation of 
similarities. This opinion, which is implied 
in his description of humour as a display of 
incongruities and the sole excitant of laughter, 
affirms a connection between the witticisms 
and the joke similar to, though not identical 
with, the connection now to be discussed.

CHAPTER IX 
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
Tue word “wit” has fallen upon thieves, 
who have stripped it and forced it to mas- 
querade in borrowed meanings, or more 
properly perhaps, it has suffered in meaning 
and reputation through the company it has 
been compelled to keep. One source of its 
misfortunes has been a confusion between the 
witticism and the joke. Wit has been mis- 
takenly regarded as part of laughter, and the 
word is now used, in common speech, very 
indiscriminately to denote anything humorous 
or funny. In describing pantomime-patter 
the word “ witty” is often used as an almost 
equal alternative to “ humorous ”’ or “ funny ” 
or ‘“‘ comical’: the speaker’s memory being, 
as it were, a lucky-bag from which he takes 
whichever word comes first to hand. 
Unless “ wit” is frankly abandoned to this 
widened usage and no attempt is made to 
reserve its original meaning for it, this identi- 
fication of wit with amused laughter confuses 
close neighbours with family inmates. For 
124
-P-A-G-E-131
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
wit, as formerly conceived and as its tradition 
still persists, is a double achievement of insight 
and expression. It illuminates a truth 
suddenly and vividly, as a house covered by 
darkness is revealed by the sweep of a search- 
light. ‘‘ Their only means of government’’, 
exclaimed Grattan, ‘‘ are the guinea and the 
gallows’’. Wrote Vativenargues: ‘‘ Great 
thoughts come from the heart’. The insight 
of wit may vary from a master-truth of human 
life to an exposure of political imperfection. 
Since it may also be dedicated to trifles and 
truisms, and since all expression of insight 
is not witty, its essence lies in the suddenness 
and vividness of its revelation. All revela- 
tion, however, must reveal something, though 
that something be humble, and high wit has 
deep insight, its achievement, therefore, may 
be considered ‘‘ double’. The degradation 
of the term “ wit’ to denote the sallies of 
nimble fancy that are more entertaining than 
wise, which has accompanied its reduction to 
a species of the amusing, is intimated in Lord 
Morley’s use of the term “aphorism ’”’. Syd- 
ney Smith wrote of Sir James Macintosh : 
“New and sudden relations of ideas flashed 
across his mind in reasoning, and produced 
the same effect as wit, and would have been 
called wit, if a sense of their utility and 
importance had not often overpowered the 
admiration of novelty, and entitled them to 
the higher name of wisdom’. Lord 
125
-P-A-G-E-132
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
Morley appropriated such “wisdom” to the 
aphorism which compresses a mass of thought 
and observation into a single saying'*. The 
aphorism may assist to lower the dignity of 
wit by relieving it of its more serious signific- 
ance. Its inclination towards soberness and 
seriousness was ready to restrict wit to a 
more volatile role. In its youth, wrote 
Bacon, knowledge “is in aphorisms and 
observations’ ?**. Such aphorisms must con- 
tain ‘‘ the pith and heart of sciences ”’ and be 
filled with “some good quantity of observa- _ 
tion’”’. They test ‘the writer, whether he 
be superficial or solid’, they are “ fit to win 
consent or belief ’’, and, since they represent 
“a knowledge broken ’’, they ‘‘ invite men to 
inquire farther’’**. Johnson extolled ‘ the 
excellence of aphorisms . . . in the compre- 
hension of some obvious and useful truth in a 
few words”’1*. Whether the aphorism com- 
presses into one single saying the matured 
insight of research, as when Bacon regards it 
as a pithy expression of scientific principles, 
or concentrates common sense wisdom into a 
phrase, as Johnson thinks of it, it tends to 
deprive wit of its higher offices and to restrict 
it more or less severely to mere nimbleness 
of fancy. 
The tendency of wit to brilliant trifling, 
and, it may be added, to speaking daggers, is 
connected with its predilection for Aristotle’s 
amaxim for poets: “ but the greatest thing by 
126 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
far is to be a master of metaphor’’1**. Meta- 
phor inclines to comparisons, and comparisons 
are very usual search-lights of wit: ‘‘ Exper- 
ience is a good schoolmaster, but the school- 
fees are somewhat heavy’. Metaphorical 
comparisons are notoriously seductive: they 
tempt fancy to riot and dazzle good sense into 
illusion. 
The history of the word “ wit” is a record 
of a degeneration in meaning. From mental 
insight to the nimbler, quicker, more pictur- 
esque apprehensions, and from these to mere 
lively or truculent plays of fancy—so the story 
runs. A survey of this history from Bacon 
till now discloses this process of transition. 
Two features run clearly through the historical 
sequence in the estimates of wit: the identi- 
fication of the witticism with the revelation 
of likeness between dissimilars and its inclusion 
among the varieties of the ludicrous. This 
descent of the word ‘“‘ wit ” did not take place 
down a straight, continuous slope, any more 
than it is now uniformly degraded to trivial 
occasions. Various meanings lingered to- 
gether, as they linger together now. But 
there is a general course discernible in its 
history whose analysis indicates both that 
wit, as such, is not a variety of the ludicrous 
and why the witticism and the joke have 
been naturally, though unfortunately, con- 
founded. 
Hobbes noted in ‘“ natural wit’, which is 
127
-P-A-G-E-134
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
“gotten by use only and experience’’, a 
“ swift succession of one thought to another ; 
and steady direction to some approved end ”’: 
wit is prompt, nimble, and directed to achieve- 
ment. “‘ Observing similitudes” is ‘‘ good 
wit’: a witticism detects an analogy or 
likeness. It is unsteady, and inclines to the 
great fancy that is one kind of madness if 
“good judgment”, which observes “ dis- 
similitudes ’’, does not balance it1*’. Wit 
in short, pounces on resemblances, and its 
indiscriminate pouncing requires the discip- 
linary scrutiny of judgment. 
Since men laugh at mischances and in- 
decencies when there is neither wit nor jest, 
Hobbes distinguished between laughters with 
and without a sense of the ludicrous. Wit 
and jest are here distinguished, and if men 
laugh at jests that elegantly discover, im their 
wit, absurdities in another, wit seems to beget 
the jest, not to be it1*. Desire for power 
stimulates wit which varies as the source of 
power is sought in riches, knowledge, or 
honour ?**. Wit, Hobbes apparently thinks, 
can touch the sense of power by inciting 
laughter of self-applause and it can procure 
laughter with a sense of the ludicrous. Wit, on 
Hobbes’ version, is quick, nimble, perceptive, 
and inventive power that tends to be volatile 
and to pounce on resemblances. It also 
serves the sense of the ludicrous by begetting 
jests. 
128 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
Locke emphasized the same: contrast as 
Hobbes between the volatile inventiveness of 
wit and the more sober restraint of judg- 
ment: “. .. wit lying most in the assem- 
blage of ideas, and putting them together 
with quickness and variety wherein can be 
found any resemblance or congruity.... 
Judgment, on the contrary, lies quite on the 
other side, in separating carefully one from 
another ideas wherein can be found the least 
difference, thereby to avoid being misled by 
similitude and by affinity to take one thing for 
another’”’. Wit, as with Hobbes, is prompt 
(Locke associates “a great deal of wit and 
prompt memory”), always pouncing on 
resemblances, and thus requires the discipline 
of analytical judgment. Wit constructs 
“pleasant pictures ’’, its “ entertainment and 
pleasantry ” appeal to fancy, and “ its beauty 
appears at first sight.” ‘It also tempts the 
mind to rest ’’, “ satisfied with the agreeable- 
ness of the picture and the gaiety of fancy ” 2°. 
Hazlitt’s approval of the comment by “ Harris, 
the author of Hermes’, that on Locke’s 
analysis Euclid’s Elements would be ‘a 
collection of epigrams”’, assumes that Locke 
was defining the Iudicrous, or ludicrous 
wit?". But Locke did not identify the 
witticism with the laughable or ludicrous, 
though he recognized that it could procure 
amusement. In both Hobbes and Locke the 
essence of wit is a quick pounce on a 
129 I 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
similarity. In the period of these two phil- 
osophers, the seventeenth century, wit was 
essentially regarded as sharp capturing of 
similarities with a penchant for riot that 
required disciplining by the more deliberate, 
scrutinizing distinctions of judgment. It also 
tended to beget amused laughter with its 
characteristic sense of the ludicrous. 
Hobbes and Locke completed a distinction 
between wit and judgment previously 
immanent in Bacon. For Bacon, wit was 
general inventive capacity: he commends 
Queen Elizabeth for “her inventing wit in 
contriving plots and overturns” in “so 
dangerous times, when wits are so cun- 
ning’”’2%, Wit, which is “able to hold all 
arguments ”’, is more froward, desultory, and 
sportive than judgment, which is more 
forward “in discerning what is true’. 
Hobbes, and Locke after him, more explicitly 
trace the greater irresponsibility of wit to 
its hankering after “ similitudes”’. In privi- 
leging some serious matters from the jest 
Bacon observes: ‘‘ There be some that think 
their wits have been asleep except they dart 
out somewhat that is piquant and to the 
quick’. He also warns the man “ that hath 
a satirical vein, as he maketh others afraid 
of his wit, so he had need be afraid of other’s 
memory” 2%. ‘Thus Bacon observed in wit 
a devotion of its ingenuity to procuring jests 
and also, it may be noted, to belligerency. 
130
-P-A-G-E-137
: LAUGHTER AND WIT 
In the literary tradition of the seventeenth 
century wit retained its sense of general mental 
capacity, with a stress on inventiveness, and 
carried an emphatic implication of effective 
literary expression. Dryden’s “ great wits” 
who were “to madness near allied’ *°* were 
writers of genius. Pope’s well known lines : 
“True wit is nature to advantage dress’d 
What oft was thought, but ne’er so well expressed ”’ 2%, 
prolong into the eighteenth century the general 
notion of wit as effective expression. Speak- 
ing of Johnson, the great literary figure of the 
middle eighteenth century, Sir Walter Raleigh 
remarks: “in our author’s time wit was the 
general term for intellectual powers” *°°. 
Johnson does think ‘‘ Pope’s account of wit 
is undoubtedly erroneous” because he 
“reduces it from strength of thought to 
happiness of language’. But, ‘“‘ more rigor- 
ously and philosophically considered ’’, wit is 
a “strength of thought ’’ which contains “a 
combination of dissimilar images, or discovery 
of occult resemblances in things apparently 
unlike ’’2°7, The analysis of Hobbes and 
Locke is steadily pressing on the notion of wit 
to specialize it into a revealer of comparisons. 
But it is not yet distinctly degraded to 
purveying entertainment nor reduced to a 
species of the laughable. It has been freely 
devoted, as the names of Dryden and Pope 
forcibly remind us, to satirical attack. 
I3I 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
As the eighteenth century drew to its close 
Burke still depended on this analysis. Since 
“the mind of man has naturally a far greater 
alacrity and satisfaction in tracing resem- 
blances than in searching for differences ’’, it 
is natural for ‘a perfect union of wit and 
judgment ”’ to be “‘ one of the rarest things in 
the world’s. Wit is still the volatile 
disturber of judgment, excitedly hunting after 
comparisons, rejoicing in their disclosure, and 
not yet identified with a species of the ludi- 
crous. ‘The philosopher Reid, who was of 
Burke’s age, observes that ‘‘ one great branch 
of what we call wit, which, when innocent, 
gives pleasure to every good-natured man, 
consists in discovering unexpected agreements 
in things. The author of Hudibras could 
discern a property common to the morning 
and a boiled lobster—that both turned from 
black to red” 2°. This implies an extended 
mental capacity for wit, refers a devotion of 
one “‘ branch” of it to pouncing on similar- 
ities, recognizes in it a source of the ludicrous, 
and senses its tendency, for it may not be 
“innocent ’’, to belligerency. 
In the early nineteenth century Coleridge 
continues this distinction within wit. ‘The 
detection of “identity in dissimilar things ’’, 
which is steadily assigned as the province of 
wit, divides into ‘scientific wit’, whose 
object, “‘ consciously entertained, is truth’, 
and wit, whose object is ‘‘ amusement ”’. 
132
-P-A-G-E-139
  
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
A higher name is usually reserved for “ scien- 
tific wit”. “Wit” is thus being reserved 
for amusing comparisons, though “ amuse- 
ment” is probably to be construed more 
widely than ludicrousness. Shakespeare's wit, 
he adds, is fanciful, placing images in unusual 
connections ; “‘ wit was the stuff and sub- 
stance of Fuller’s intellect’. Coleridge also 
distinguishes Shakespeare’s wit, which pleases 
by surprise, from his fancy, which, in addition, 
leaves a gratifying image with us, and suggests 
that ‘‘ the greater part of what passes for wit 
in Shakespeare ”’ is ‘‘ most exquisite humour ”’. 
Fuller’s wit, he also thinks, ‘“‘ defrauded him 
of his due praise for the practical wisdom of 
his thoughts” and for “the beauty and 
variety ’’ of his truths*°. The status of wit 
is being steadily lowered to a purveyor of 
entertainment ; it still has an eye for simili- 
tude with another eye to the ludicrous, 
though it is not yet identified as a species of 
the laughable. 
A description of wit collated from Sydney 
Smith, a contemporary of Coleridge, would 
tun: a discovery of a surprising and unusual 
telation between ideas that has neither 
utility nor beauty and excites a sense of 
superior intelligence*". It is expressly 
restricted to the lighter side of mental activity: 
in Rochefoucauld’s ‘“‘ hypocrisy is the homage 
which vice renders to virtue”’ the mere wit 
of the image is swallowed up in justice and 
133 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
value. When Sydney Smith wrote: ‘“ show 
a child of six years old . . . that by pressing 
the spring of a repeating watch you make 
the watch strike, and you probably raise a 
feeling in the child’s mind precisely similar 
to that of wit’, he seems to retain in wit 
a relic of achieving power and to dissociate 
it from any necessary connection with the 
ludicrous. Wit is apparently closely con- 
nected with laughter if laughter is not so 
long and loud: in wit as it is in humour, but, 
since “in a piece of wit there is but a single 
flash of surprise and pleasure”? and the 
“admiration ’’ extorted by a witticism is not 
“favourable to laughter ’’, he probably does 
not think of wit as actually a species of the 
ludicrous **. Similitude is replaced by the 
wider term ‘‘relation”’; the witticism is 
virtually restricted to the revelation of trivial 
telations ; and it is observed to have a close 
connection with the laughable. 
Hazlitt, contemporaneously with Sydney 
Smith and Coleridge in the earlier nineteenth 
century, depressed the status of wit, which 
“hovers round the borders of the light and 
trifling’. Its “favourite employment” is 
“to add littleness to littleness, and heap 
contempt on insignificance by all the arts of 
petty and incessant warfare.” When it 
“describes the serious seriously, it ceases to 
be wit’. Since “ wit, or ludicrous invention 
134 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
produces its effect oftenest by comparison 
but not always’”’ and “‘ frequently effects its 
purposes by unexpected and subtle distinc- 
tions’, Hazlitt extends the province of wit 
beyond comparison, as Sydney Smith does, 
and connects it, quite clearly, with the 
ludicrous. There is explicit inclusion of wit 
as a begetter of amusement : wit “‘is, in fact, 
a voluntary act of the mind, or exercise 
of invention, showing the absurd and ludi- 
crous consciously, whether in ourselves or 
another.”’ He does not, however, tumble 
wit completely from its higher estate, for he 
admits, in addition to its usual predilection 
for warfare, ‘‘a wit of sense and observation 
which consists in the acute illustration of 
good sense and practical wisdom by means 
of some far-fetched conceit or quaint 
imagery ” ™*. 
Hazlitt seems to consider wit essentially as 
a species of the ludicrous, and Leigh Hunt, in 
1846, definitely included wit and humour 
as two species of the laughable, which implies 
the ludicrous, though laughter, he suggests, 
need not result from everything witty or 
humorous **. 
Ten years after, George Eliot seems to think 
of wit and humour as two species of the genus 
laughable, though they have different natures. 
Humour, with its less demand on mental ripe- 
ness, is the earlier growth, and has more 
135 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
affinity with poetic tendencies. It has been 
progressively humanized from triumphant 
laughter and coarse practical joking into the 
“sympathetic presentation of incongruous 
elements in nature and life’’. Its nature is 
more prolix than the “ direct and irresistible 
force of wit”. Wit remains more cruel and 
coarse ; it “ seizes on unexpected and complex 
relations ’’, while humour “ draws its materials 
from situations and characteristics’. ‘‘ Wit 
is brief, sudden, detects unsuspected analogies, 
and suggests confounding inferences: its 
closer connection with logic makes kinship 
between the witticism and the subtle exposure, 
by reasoning, of a fallacy or absurdity” =. 
The tradition of mental power lingers in 
this estimate of wit ; the witticism apprehends 
nimbly and expresses decisively ; wit reveals 
relations and, true to tradition, has a special 
pounce for similitudes. Wit is also the sword 
of satire, and it is by nature laughable. 
For Meredith wit was more war-like laugh- 
ter, like the wit of Hoyden, comic laughter 
being the chastizer of folly without wounds, 
and humour the laughing comforter of suscepti- 
bilities ***. 
Towards the end of the nineteenth century, 
Sully, apparently, contemplates no exclusion 
of wit from the species of laughter at the 
ludicrous #7, and, in the opening of the twen- 
tieth century, Bergson distinguishes the 
comical word which makes us laugh at the 
136
-P-A-G-E-143
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
speaker from the witty which makes us laugh 
at ourselves or at a third party: wit is 
definitely adopted, it would seem, as a species 
of the ludicrous. In a restricted sense wit 
dashes off a comic scene in a few strokes *"*. 
In our own day Mr Eastman applies the 
terms ‘absurdity’, ‘“‘comic”’, “wit”, and 
“joke ”’ to the “‘ practical kind of humour ’’, 
and apparently regards the witticism as an 
intellectual joke**. Professor M*Dougall 
seems to regard the witticism as a subtle 
and effective presentment of the ludicrous *°. 
Freud receives the impression from a survey 
of continental literature that wit can be 
successfully studied only as part of the 
comic 1, The gradual and decisive assimila- 
tion of the witticism to the joke that runs 
clearly through English literature is, therefore, 
no freak nor perversity of thought. French 
and German discussion of wit has been in 
contact with English thought, but the lines 
have been sufficiently distinct and sufficiently 
determined by their own traditions to provide 
a convergence from different centres upon a 
common recognition that wit is closely con- 
nected with the ludicrous. This close con- 
nection is as significant as it has often been 
deceptive. It is significant because it discloses 
special qualifications in wit for evoking the 
ludicrous, and it is often deceptive because, as 
if a joker were identified with his joke, wit has 
been mistaken for a variety of the ludicrous. 
137 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
Many writers realize that amusement tends 
to wane as wit mounts higher. This realiza- 
tion is apparent in Sydney Smith’s verdict 
on Rochefoucauld’s epigram, in his judgment 
that the admiration extorted by wit does not 
favour laughter, in the dissipation of wit (the 
laughable) by seriousness noted by Hazlitt 
and in the submerging of the ludicrous element 
by other pleasing factors when the witticism 
is subtle, as M*Dougall observes**. This . 
intimation by wit, as it turns its more serious 
face, that it only partners easily with the 
ludicrous, is misunderstood when wit is 
restricted to its more trivial and more 
aggressive forms. ‘This restriction of wit and 
the reservation of other terms, such as 
“aphorism ’’, to describe the more elevated 
achievements of insight and expression are 
probably connected with the persistent haunt- 
ing of more trivial wit by the ludicrous. 
Amused laughter may be an integral and 
essential part of eesthetic emotion **, it may 
be an indispensable part of human life, but, 
when comic laughter clings too persistently 
to anything, it tends, because relaxation 
belongs to its essence, to lower that thing’s 
prestige. The prestige of wit may have 
suffered through its close association with the 
ludicrous and this reduction of dignity been 
marked by a withdrawal from wit of its claim 
on the higher forms of insight and expression. 
If the concentrated expression of the higher 
138 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
wisdom of life is allowed to wit, the separable- 
ness of the witticism and the joke is at once 
suspected, if not obvious. 
If appropriate incongruity excites the sense 
of the ludicrous, the predilection of the witti- 
cism for remote identities, so insisted upon by 
the older English writers and still insisted upon 
by many, should have prevented the identi- 
fication of wit with the comic. ‘The reference 
of the ludicrous to incongruity has wavered, 
however, before the wreath of laughter round 
flashing wit. But these older writers also 
perceived another characteristic feature of wit 
that explains its connection with laughter 
without requiring an identification of the two. 
“ Brevity is the soul of wit”: all, says 
Freud, speaking more particularly of French 
and German writers, agree on this. “‘ The 
direct and irresistible force of wit’, agrees 
‘George Eliot, is brief and sudden. Like a 
lightning artist who portrays in a few strokes, 
wit concentrates a truth in a few words or a 
mass of truth into a moment of vivid illumina- 
tion. It penetrates by epitome, as Macbeth 
summarized Duncan in “after life’s fitful 
fever, he sleeps well”. It illumines by a 
simile, as in the Elizabethan Sir Walter 
Raleigh’s “it is opinion, not truth, that 
travelleth the world without passport”. It 
triumphs with a dagger-thrust, like the cruel 
reply to Pope that an interrogation mark 
is a little crooked thing which asks questions. 
139
-P-A-G-E-146
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
The decisiveness of wit, its brilliant moment 
of achievement, presents laughter with oppor- 
tunity, for the stir of its passage leaves behind 
that original source and necessary condition 
of all laughing—telief. 
As many laughters can spring from a centre 
of physical relief, or of relief in a situation 
that occurs in active life, so the more purely 
mental relief precipitated by wit is prolific 
in varieties of laughter. The mental recap- 
itulation, or simulacrum, of a physical situ- 
ation in relief sequent to wit must not be too 
peremptorily squeezed into an analogy. An 
analogue of the sheer laughter of relief arising 
from the sudden withdrawal of menace or 
the sudden success of an effort can be sought 
in sheer laughter of witty success but not 
necessarily found. If an irresistible witticism 
seems to leave nothing unsaid, and all great 
or effective utterance produces a momentary 
impression of final and complete revelation, 
it may thrill with a feeling of suddenly com- 
pleted satisfaction that laughs with a sheer 
emotion of witty achievement. A hostile 
witticism is a surer analogue of a final sword- 
thrust, for wit can result in triumphant 
laughter, as the vindictive practical joke or 
the fall of an enemy in battle can result in 
it. The witty exposure of a futile menace 
may provoke laughter and suffuse it with 
scorn; contemptuous laughter may roar 
140
-P-A-G-E-147
  
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
loudly when a witticism disrobes dignity as 
if a hand had plucked a man naked. These 
and other laughters can be stirred by wit, 
as they can be stirred by situations in which 
active life drops into relief. Thus wit can 
easily fall into bad odour, since its efficiency, 
which is part of its nature, invites its use as a 
sword. Addison would have nothing ill said 
of wit, and conceived it majestically in his 
allegorical description : the God of Wit, ‘‘ who 
bore several quivers on his shoulders, and 
grasped several arrows in his hand ’’, because 
“there was something so amiable and yet so 
piercing in his looks ”’ filled the beholder “ with 
love and terror’ ***. But, if wit is essentially 
an achievement of insight and expression, it 
can serve scurrilous uses and may serve, as 
Freud insists, to indulge hostility or to secure 
obscene satisfaction or to rebel against 
authority **. Since the relief in the wake of 
wit can be so prolific in laughters, it was easy 
to confuse wit with a species of the laughable 
and to accuse it, with George Eliot, of lingering 
among the coarser and more cruel forms of 
laughter. 
Since wit, though the incongruous is not 
its own sphere, exposes incongruities as an 
indirect consequence of its own proper action, 
it can stir the sense of the ludicrous by lodging 
incongruity in a situation of relief. ‘Traill 
saw clearly that, when wit reveals an un- 
suspected similarity between two things, it 
I4I
-P-A-G-E-148
  LAUGHTER AND WIT 
will also display an incongruity between them. 
If two things are suddenly convicted of a 
concealed resemblance, they will, because their 
likeness required discovery, also appear as an 
ill-assorted pair. The late Henry James was 
a meticulous analyst and nice in his choice of 
expression. Excessive nicety and superfluity 
of analysis is the bane of scrupulosity. He 
was wittily compared, in his moments of super- 
exactness, to a hippopotamus trying to pick 
up a pea. This comparison effectively ex- 
presses an excess of analysis. As such, 
supposing the criticism to be just, it is true 
and perceptive, and laughter immediately 
provoked by the witticism will express a 
gratification following the relief of achieve- 
ment. So far as a sense of the ludicrous is 
aroused it is incited by the incongruous 
association of a respectable and able novelist 
with a clumsy amphibian. ‘Traill, by his 
sharpened sense of the function of the simile 
that made it the sole method of wit, saw very 
distinctly that laughter (amused laughter) 
often accompanies wit because incongruity is 
simultaneously displayed with the revelation 
of similarity **. He sees that wit and laughter 
of amusement have been mistaken for members 
of the same family because they are such close 
neighbours, and, perhaps it might be added, 
such cronies. But wit is neighbourly with 
all the laughters, and if a witticism is not 
accompanied by comic or humorous laughter 
142
-P-A-G-E-149
  
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
it may be, and often is, accompanied by one 
of their less genial fellows. 
Perhaps Hobbes thought as Traill thought, 
many years after, when he spoke of jests 
elegantly discovering, in their wit, absurdities 
in others. Reid might have nodded assent to 
Traill’s doctrine. Many writers almost seem 
to imply Traill’s connection between wit and 
humour, and only somewhat inadvertently to 
identify wit with an inherently laughable 
species. It may have been so with Hazlitt 
if wit is, as he says, an “‘ exercise of invention, 
showing the absurd and ludicrous con- 
sciously. .. .” Wit showing the ludicrous 
is not far from the argument of this chapter. 
Wit is a quick, vivid illumination of a truth. 
It may bestow its energies on trifles or exercise 
them on higher matters. Since relief, because 
the rush of wit is so vigorous and its success so 
striking, follows in its wake, laughters can 
spring up round it. Other names are often 
preferred for the higher reaches of wit, 
_ because its nimbleness tends to the sportive, 
because it tends to lose prestige by prompting 
laughters so readily, and because it is so ready 
a weapon for satire and all kinds of rebellion. 
It prospers largely on the metaphor, and this 
prosperity is one root of its loss of reputation, 
since metaphors are good servants who easily 
become riotous masters. ‘The emphatic relief 
143
-P-A-G-E-150
  
LAUGHTER AND WIT 
it confers is another root, for it helps it to 
that association with laughter which has so 
influenced its fortunes. Every relief-situation 
has a descending incongruity for its sides, 
and the stroke of wit indirectly manufactures 
incongruities or displays them. Thus the 
witticism tends to be, in effect, a joke and to 
stir a sense of the ludicrous. Wit, however, 
is not laughable per se, though it is an effective 
cause of the laughable. 
This is no complete analysis of comic wit 
or. of any wit. Relief and incongruity, a 
contrast that administers a psychical shock, 
are always present in the ludicrous, but they 
do not compass the full richness of the comical 
or the humorous. So with wit: ‘‘ Any one 
better apprehends what it is by acquaintance 
than I can inform him by description. It 
is indeed a thing so versatile and multi- 
form ... that it seemeth no less hard to 
make a portrait of Proteus, or to define the 
figure of the fleeting air” **7.

CHAPTER X 
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
ACCORDING to a now common notion, of 
modern origin, we laugh, as Falstaff was a 
coward, on instinct. This notion is natural 
to an age which looks for function and, 
in studying anything, thinks first of its 
use or purpose. Instinct is too purposeful 
and theorists are too anxious for laughing 
to be useful for laughter not to be claimed 
as an instinct. Laughter is still approached 
in different ways, and, in particular, is 
still studied from an esthetic standpoint. But 
the psychological and sociological approach, 
so prominent in present thought, is so 
thoroughly preoccupied with instincts that 
it is almost predestined to include laughter 
among them. Some writers who hesitate to 
make laughter, and comic or humorous 
laughter in particular, a member of the same 
company as anger, fear, and other instincts, 
draw it as closely as they can to this company. 
When thought centres on usefulness, when 
purposeful instincts stand in the foreground 
145 K
-P-A-G-E-152
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
of thought and when pervasive, perplexing 
laughter taunts its would-be interpreters with 
their failures, the attempt to solve the problem 
of laughter by treating it as an instinct amen- 
able to the principles applicable to instincts is 
virtually inevitable. This attempt is one 
prominent characteristic of thinking to-day. 
If we were amused as feeling or thinking 
statues, if they could exist, would be amused ; 
if the sense of the ludicrous suffused our minds 
without even a ripple on our bodies; if we 
did not smile or grin or guffaw or contort 
our bodies when we are pleased or amused or 
triumphant or elated, there might be no talk 
of instinctive laughter. There is such talk, 
and, at the moment, plenty of it, because we 
do smile and grin and guffaw and sometimes 
very vigorously exercise our bodies in hearty 
laughing. The familiar, peculiar, and em- 
phatic “mechanical motion” of laughter 
naturally provokes a comparison with flight 
stirred by fear or attack urged by anger. 
Instincts have an emotional side and an 
active, physically manifest side. The emotion 
of fear can be read on the flight of a frightened 
child. Ifthe motions of escape are instinctive, 
or part of an instinct, the “ happy convulsion ” 
of laughter may be instinctive too, for amuse- 
ment can be read on a laugh, as anger can be 
read on a blow. 
The response of theorists to the suggestion 
that laughter is an instinct has been sensitized 
146
-P-A-G-E-153
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
by the influence of behaviouristic psychology. 
Naturalists watch the actions of animals and 
they can observe a small bird’s dash for safety 
when a hawk hovers, as we can observe a cloud 
hurry across a windy sky. The psychologist 
can study his own consciousness, or, at any 
rate what he has been accustomed to call his 
own consciousness. He can note his own joy, 
his own pain when he loses a tooth to the 
forceps, his recollection of his past, his “mental 
image” or mental picture, as he has been 
accustomed to consider it, of the past scene 
which he recollects, and he can note both his 
thinking and his thoughts. He cannot watch 
his neighbour’s thoughts or inspect his emo- 
tions, but he can watch his actions. The 
naturalist spontaneously assumes a feeling of 
fear in the fleeing bird, and the psychologist, 
with equal spontaneity, assumes that the little 
girl in the next garden feels fear when she 
shrinks from a dog. Now it is easier to watch 
the actions of a lobster than to know how it 
feels or thinks. Human actions, even, are 
more obvious to the observer than human 
emotions or thoughts. The conscious part of 
human life seems to be known through its 
physically active part, which includes speaking 
and writing, and since we are often uncertain 
about people’s motives and frequently mis- 
understand their intentions, thoughts, or 
feelings, mental life seems to be somewhat 
precariously surmised from behaviour. Watch 
147
-P-A-G-E-154
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
the bird flee, then, as you would watch the 
flow of its blood, through a microscope, 
experience seems to enjoin, and watch your 
neighbours as you watch their motor-cars— 
without reck of ‘‘ mental images ”’ or anything 
else mental and privately concealed for us 
to surmise in their bodies and actions. This 
behaviouristic method of studying perceptible 
actions and ignoring mental processes or 
states of consciousness appears the more 
profitable because careful study reveals a 
great sensitiveness in the body to mental 
states. 
A slight pin-prick, or the threat of one, 
sends an electric current over the palm of 
the hand, and if a sensitive galvanometer, 
indicating the passage of electric currents 
by the movements of a spot of light, is con- 
nected with the patient’s palm the occurrence 
and intensities of emotions in him are indicated 
by the spot’s movements and their range **. 
When the travelling spot of light adds, as 
it were, to the gestures of the body, indicating 
emotion as the excited dance of a child 
indicates it, study is naturally attracted by 
this and similar extensions of possibility in 
studying human behaviour. The physiologist 
can trace the effect of expecting food in a 
preparation of the body for digestion—saliva 
waters the hungry man’s mouth as he sits 
down to eat. He can detect an increase of 
sugar in the blood after anxiety or pain or 
148
-P-A-G-E-155
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
fear or strain, discover a physiological record 
in the body of excitement from mixing with 
a crowd or listening to music, and read hunger 
in the contractions of an alimentary canal *°. 
A simple experiment opens to inspection a 
wide range of actions that are more subdued 
than obvious gestures or movements. The 
experimenter suspends a gold ring by a silk 
thread in an empty glass and concentrates 
his thoughts on the hour of day. Presently 
the tinkling of the hour on the glass announces 
slight bodily motions corresponding to the 
thought *°. Scientific ingenuity has assid- 
uously added to our knowledge of human 
behaviour, by many methods analogous to 
these, many subtler responses to thought and 
feeling. 
The psychological laboratory and the 
resources of physiology have so increased the 
possibilities of studying mind, or conscious- 
ness, through behaviour or bodily processes 
that extreme behaviourists say it should be 
studied only thus. Thus Thorndike says that 
a man’s anxiety or toothache can be observed 
in his actions in exactly the same physical 
way that the temperature of his body can 
be taken by a thermometer. Still more 
absolute behaviourists affirm that we study 
men’s minds by thoroughly observing their 
gestures, all the overt and subdued motions, 
external and internal, of their bodies, and the 
chemical changes in their organisms, because 
149 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
there is nothing more to study. Thus 
Professor Watson refuses to use the word 
“consciousness ”’, and defines psychology as 
“that division of natural science which takes 
human activity and conduct as its subject 
matter” **. If this and other absolute 
behaviourist utterances are taken literally, 
and they seem to be intended literally, they 
mean that if you observe every motion of and 
in the body of a man and every chemical 
change in it, you know the whole man. They 
mean also that a complete cinematograph 
picture of a man’s laugh, including every 
motion and change occurring in his body, 
would be laughter. But his sense of the 
ludicrous, his amusement, if he laughed at a 
joke, would be omitted by the cinema. The 
audience would sympathetically insert it 
because they have themselves laughed amus- 
edly. To spectators who had never experi- 
enced the “‘ sudden glory ”’ of amused laughter, 
who were strangers to ludicrous emotion, the 
cinema would portray a curious, enigmatical 
contortion of a human body, not a fit of 
laughing. This extreme behaviouristic insist- 
ence on the body overemphasizes the reason- 
able behaviouristic determination to consider 
the whole psycho-physical organism, mind 
and body together. The emotion of fear is 
more intelligible when the motions of flight 
are observed to remove the body from real 
or fancied danger, and it is natural to look 
150
-P-A-G-E-157
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
for light on laughter in its physical expression. 
The mechanics and physiology of laughter 
disclose very clearly, as previously noted, the 
element of relaxation through interrupted 
effort, of relief, in laughing. The older theor- 
ists were less behaviouristic and more exclus- 
ively devoted to the mental aspect of laughter 
than the modern. This did not prevent them 
from suggesting for laughter or even from 
anticipating Professor M*Dougall. “I make 
haste to laugh ’’, said Beaumarchais, “‘ for fear 
of being obliged to weep” **. M*Dougall’s 
estimate of laughter as an instinct devoted 
to suppressing unnecessary sympathy elabor- 
ates into a complete theory the aptness. 
of some misfortunes, noted by Hazlitt, to 
“afford us amusement from the very rejection 
of their false claims upon our sympathy ” ***. 
M°Dougall recognizes both the conscious and 
physical aspects of laughter, and there seems 
to be no express behaviouristic identification 
of laughing with a purely physical and 
physiological disturbance of the body, though 
Watson implies it; but the modern attention 
to the physical aspects of mental life, partic- 
ularly in connection with instincts, has 
doubtless been very influential on the modern 
estimate of laughter as an instinct. 
“Laughter’’, wrote Mandeville, “is a 
mechanical motion, which we are naturally 
thrown into when we are wunaccountably 
pleased” **. The hunting wasp, Sphex, is 
151 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
“naturally thrown into’’ a complicated ‘“‘mech- 
anical motion ” when she paralyses crickets by 
stinging them thrice—in the neck, between the 
joint of a front thoracic segment, and towards 
the abdomen—and devotes them, suspended 
between life and death, to the jaws of her future 
offspring by laying her eggs on them **. The 
skilled surgery of the wasp, which pierces the 
effective nervous centres of the cricket and 
adjusts its venomous attack to produce a per- 
fectly immobile suspended animation without 
death so that the grub may have fresh meat 
without danger from the victim’s struggles, is 
spontaneously exerted without training. The 
performance anticipates without the wasp 
being anticipatory, for a larder is stocked 
for future grubs by a mother who, since 
she dies before they break from the eggs, 
can scarcely understand what she does or 
why she does it. Aristotle speaks of ‘‘ natural 
desires ’’, such as those for food or sexual love, 
“of which the body is a necessary instru- 
ment” and which do “not spring from a 
definite theory” **’. If we neglect “ desire” 
for the obvious performances of laughter and 
the wasp, we observe in each both an operation 
by body and an independence of “‘ definite 
theory’. Both suggest automatism ; both 
appear as bits of routine predestined by the 
constitution of the organism to occur during 
life ; both seem to be performances into which 
the organism is thrown by circumstances. 
152 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
Both the spontaneous, unreflectingly auto- 
matic interjection of the laugh and the hunt 
similarly interjected into the life of the wasp 
seem to be, in terms of Bergson’s familiar 
note on instinct, extensions into behaviour, 
into the overt bodily actions constituting 
activity in the arena of life, of the unreflecting, 
spontaneous, apparently automatic physio- 
logical processes within the body. We laugh 
and Sphex hunts much as we breathe or as 
our hearts beat. The laughing and the hunting 
are more occasional than breathing, but they 
appear, when their moments come, to. be 
equally predestined in life’s routine. 
Laughter so strongly suggests an action 
that the body is set to perform when appro- 
priate occasions touch off the setting that The 
New English Dictionary deliberately defines 
the laugh as the instinctive expression of 
mirth or the sense of the ludicrous. It also, 
as appears from the continued course of its 
definition, suspects its instinctive character 
from the power of certain sensations, notably 
tickling, to occasion it. Though laughter, 
which does nothing but agitate the stationary 
body and “while it lasts, slackens and 
unbraces the mind, weakens the faculties, and 
causes a kind of remissness and dissolution 
in the powers of the soul”’ **, cannot be the 
established response to tickling, which makes 
the body struggle and requires tension instead 
153 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
of relaxation, the easy access to stimulation 
of laughter enjoyed by tickling and other 
sensations marks a human readiness to be 
thrown into laughing. The “happy con- 
vulsion ” is so nicely prepared, so frequently 
incited, in the human frame, and so promptly 
precipitated by its occasions, that the insist- 
ence on its instinctive character by many 
modern writers is wholly intelligible. 
Laughter confirms the verdict on its 
instinctiveness by appearing as an innate, 
indurated tendency, common to all members 
of the human race, to act in a definite way on 
certain occasions that has not to be learned, 
though it may be stimulated by the laughter 
of others and require some practice before it 
settles into an easily running and readily 
provoked habit. To the extent that the 
infant seems to be born to acquire the habit 
of laughing inevitably, laughter seems to be 
instinctive. If it were only qualified to laugh 
in the sense that it is only qualified to learn 
the ABC, assuming the habit only if it happens 
to be a habit enjoined by its social circle and 
laughing only because those around it laugh, 
the verdict might be doubted. But, even 
though Lilly meant that North American 
Indians and Cingalese Veddas do not laugh 
when he said they had no sense of the ludi- 
crous **° and said rightly, laughter is too 
constant among variations of human habit 
154
-P-A-G-E-161
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
for its instinctiveness to be suspected because 
it appears to be at all sporadic. Human 
beings seem as naturally inclined to laugh as 
to run when they are frightened, so that flight 
from danger and laughter appear to be equally 
instinctive. 
Unhesitatingly accepted instincts, like the 
behaviours of fear and anger, usually extend 
their ancestry well below man into the animal 
world. Flight from danger and assault roused 
by insult or frustration, as when a cornered 
animal, because it cannot escape, converts 
retreat into attack, are obvious in animals, 
though their feelings of fear or anger are 
surmised. Laughter is obviously younger 
historically than either of those ancient 
instincts—fear and anger. It did not flourish, 
whether as an instinct or not, until man 
adopted it, for, even if apes laugh and jack- 
daws relish practical jokes with a tinge of 
the amusement destined to pervade human 
laughter, both the physical act of laughing 
and the characteristic sense of the ludicrous 
have a relatively languishing existence among 
animals. Fear is as characteristic of animals 
as it is of men; animal laughter or joking is 
little more than a hint of human laughter. 
Even if dogs do occasionally show a sense of 
humour *°, laughter is admittedly a young 
instinct. 
The youth of laughter may be pertinent 
to its nature and require attention from the 
155
-P-A-G-E-162
cer ee em 
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
theorist. Whatever significance the predom- 
inantly human origin of laughter may have, 
or not have, laughing is unique among the 
instincts, if it is one of them. Unhesitatingly 
accepted instincts have unhesitatingly dis- 
cerned uses. No one can mistake the purpose- 
fulness of fear and anger. The absence of body 
that is better than presence of mind when 
danger lurks is obviously secured by the flight 
of fear. The soldier, who, during the battle, 
crouched where the bullets were thickest— 
in the ammunition waggon—knew why nature 
had endowed him with fear. Anger, as 
obviously, warns off the assailant or precipi- 
tates that counter-attack which, according to 
military axiom, is the best defence. The 
purpose of fear is not obscured, though its 
defeat is desired, when it is laid under disci- 
pline. Military drill, by its very measures to 
keep soldiers firm before danger, recognizes 
the function of their fear-instincts. When the 
mild answer is found to assuage wrath and 
advised as a surer defence than anger, the 
original purpose of anger is still evident. 
The tendency of all emotional instincts to 
defeat their own purposes by excessive violence 
or inopportune intervention, as when anger 
makes a boxer hit too wildly to land his blows 
or fear haps on a second danger by fleeing 
from a first that would collapse if faced, 
does not dissociate them from these purposes. 
The flight of fear and the counter-attack of 
156  
-P-A-G-E-163
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
anger, though their purposes may be better 
served, either wholly or on occasion, by other 
methods or defeated by excess of emotion 
or violence, have an obviously discernible 
function, and, in general, the more clearly 
behaviour is instinctive, the more clearly it 
is purposeful. When an instinct persists in 
acting in a wrong situation, like Fabre’s 
processionary caterpillars circling endlessly 
round the moulding on a palm vase", it 
advertizes its purpose by its very determina- 
tion to serve it under all circumstances. Now 
no specific purpose seems to be appropriated 
to laughter. ‘‘Seems’’ should be — used 
advisedly, for the mistaken attempts to ap- 
propriate a definite purpose to laughter, in 
according it instinctive status, may simply 
have failed to observe its real function. But, 
since these appropriations differ in different 
writers, the instinctive function of laughter is 
clearly less obvious than the functions of fear 
or anger. Since an instinct frequently in 
action has a defined purpose laughter is 
unique, if it is an instinct, by being both 
frequently in action and enigmatic. 
Mr Eastman does not observe with enough 
care the uniqueness of the “ mechanical 
motion’ of laughter, and does not realize 
fully the ambiguity of calling it an “act”. 
Laughter in a wide sense is “a part of what 
we do ’’, but he is too convinced that it is not 
“merely something that happens when we 
157
-P-A-G-E-164
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
have ceased to do anything ’’ when he insists 
that it “is an act... a fulfilment in its 
own proper degree of the social instinct ”’ **. 
The laugher does nothing to anyone or any- 
thing other than himself. He does nothing 
even to himself in the sense that a frightened 
man moves himself from a dangerous spot. 
Professor M°Dougall sees more clearly: “the 
instinct to laugh is peculiar in that its impulse 
seeks to effect no change in the relation of 
organisms to the outer world, but terminates 
in, and finds its satisfaction in, the bodily 
changes produced by laughter’ **. Laughter 
is not an act as a blow is an angry act or flight 
is a fearful act. Neither is it, properly speak- 
ing, an “ act of acceptance’ *4. The laugher 
simply holds his sides and laughs—his laughter 
is an action broken. 
The child smiles, according to Eastman, in 
acceptance of his social circle, and from that 
“smile of dawning laughter” all its smiles 
and laughter grow. His smile is part of his 
gregarious instinct, his instinct to welcome, 
join, and act with his companions, and his 
laughter is developed through play, itself ‘in 
its elementary form instinctive”. This 
instinct to smile and laugh in joyful accept- 
ance of comradeship in play “is the germ and 
simple rudiment of what we call the sense of 
humour”. The new, unique feeling of amuse- 
ment, that humorous emotion which is unique 
and unanalysable into more simple compon- 
158
-P-A-G-E-165
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
ents, the latest instinct to evolve, is “‘ an act 
of welcoming a playful shock or disappoint- 
ment’. The giggle, with its tinge of amuse- 
ment, evolves from “ the smile of gratification 
which greets a friendly look” to ripen into 
the laugh enamoured of the joke which is 
“created by the exact coincidence of a 
playful shock or disappointment with a 
playful or genuine satisfaction’. Since tick- 
ling is the most crude and elementary form 
of play and humorous emotion often suffuses 
the laughter of the tickle, nursery tickling is 
an authentic and first picture of humour ***. 
Thus, according to Eastman, the laugh is 
essentially laughter of greeting flourishing in 
an atmosphere of play. Companions are 
greeted first with a smile, and then, as humor- 
ous laughter begins in the giggle, the ludicrous 
receives its greeting. The laugh is the ripened 
product of this double greeting to companion- 
ship and the amusing. 
Disciplinary laughter is more like rejection 
than acceptance, and Meredith, for whom 
“folly is the natural prey of the comic ”’ ***, 
aligns himself, as Eastman himself expresses 
it, to laughter fundamentally as an act of 
rejection. The descent of ridicule upon folly 
or Meredith’s non-contemptuous silvery 
laughter at human foolishness can be ingen- 
iously estimated as greeting or acceptance of 
absurdity. Laughter, humorous laughter, 
Eastman would doubtless say, greets the 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
ludicrous in folly, and contempt, if contempt 
is present, attends laughter without being 
part of it. But Sir Thomas Browne would 
with difficulty descry pure acceptance in the 
laugh of “the severe schools” by which he 
refused to be dislodged from the “‘ philosophy 
of Hermes ”’, and an act of greeting is invaded 
with surprising ease by scorn and rejection 
if Eastman is right. ‘If theorists still incline 
so persistently to include a residual sense of 
superiority in all laughter, animus, though 
restricted, must linger pertinaciously in the 
laugh. ‘The prevalence of derision-theories of 
laughter in the past and the persistent reluct- 
ance to exclude the stroke of superiority 
from laughing intimate plainly how animus 
has haunted the laugh. This haunting by 
animus of what is essentially a genial greeting, 
and an instinctive greeting at that, might be 
conjecturally explained, but it suggests that 
a more catholic version of laughing, opening 
it more freely to the triumph, scorn, self- 
congratulation, and, it must not be forgotten, 
to the sympathy, that undoubtedly freely 
enter it, should replace its identification with 
an act of acceptance. 
If laughing is a breaking-off, an interrupted 
action expending its superfluity on the body, 
it is a special act and appropriate to a variety 
of situations. It is special because its function 
is to break, or express a break in, other actions 
that specifically relate the laugher to his 
160
-P-A-G-E-167
  LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
surroundings, as the children laughed when 
they had run from Washington Irving. It 
fits many occasions because it interrupts so 
many different actions : the struggle of battle, 
the response to a threat quickly judged to 
be futile, the suddenly successful effort. It 
can express acceptance and it can express 
tejection. Different feelings or emotions 
collect round it because it can break off 
triumphantly or scornfully or, in some purely 
mental situations, amusedly, or in a variety 
of other ways. 
M*Dougall enumerates the constituents of 
instinct thus : it is a psycho-physical disposi- 
tion; it determines a perception of and 
attention to certain objects; it contains a 
specific impulse to specific action ; and it is 
attended by a specific emotional excitement *4’. 
Each instinct has a characteristic primary 
impulse and a specific emotion **. Eastman, 
who defers to M*Dougall’s account of instinct, 
has provided laughter with a specific action, 
acceptance; but he has, apparently, also 
provided it with two emotions. ‘‘ The smile 
of gratification which greets a friendly look ”’ 
is the laughter of greeting, in being or in 
embryo, and he distinguishes it from the sub- 
sequent and unique feeling of amusement *?. 
The instinct of laughter has thus at least 
two emotional accompaniments — gratifica- 
tion and amusement. M°Dougall himself, more 
consistently, attaches the single emotion of 
I61 L 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
“ “amusement ”’ to laughter. He also makes 
laughter more emphatically purposeful than 
Eastman. Even if laughter is not vague 
in its role as a special instinct of acceptance, 
it smacks of the superfluous. An instinct 
devoted to stopping the excesses of sympathy 
has a well-defined function, even if it is a 
superfluous one. If there is any truth in 
the progressive humanization of laughter that 
has been affirmed in these pages laughter is 
more a means of letting sympathy in than of 
keeping it out. 
Both these writers have a keener sense of 
the conscious accompaniments of the physical 
act of laughing than of that act itself, though 
they do insist on the instinctiveness of laughter 
and discuss its mechanics. Sympathy, of 
course, may prompt us to assist in the chase 
of a lost hat and laughter check the impulse 
because the disaster is seen to be too trifling 
to require our efforts. But it is, unfortun- 
ately, a doubtful reading of human history 
that assumes a necessity for a special instinct 
to restrain sympathy. There is cruelty 
enough in the human record to suggest that 
men have never had much difficulty in 
restraining their sympathies, without a special 
instinct to assist them. So pervasive an 
instinct as laughter, devoted to correcting 
sympathetic excesses, would probably delay 
the growth of sympathy, already with enough 
enemies, more than it would hinder it from 
162
-P-A-G-E-169
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
destructive excesses. Laughter breaks 
response to false claims upon sympathy as 
it breaks other responses when action is called 
off, but it seems, so far as it is a specific action 
at all, to be specifically a breaking reaction 
and can occur, when the situation precipitated 
by the breaking is one of relief, in a great 
variety of circumstances. 
If “laughter is an instinctive reaction of 
aberrant type’, and if ‘its impulse ”’ differs 
from most instinctive impulses by terminating 
in the body of the laugher, it may be more 
catholic in its emotions than more normal 
instincts. An instinct that arrests other 
instincts as part of its proper function or 
nature, for the sudden arrest of fear or anger 
is apt to excite laughter, may be loose in its 
emotional attachments. It may be as mis- 
leading to speak uncritically of “ its impulse ” 
as to speak uncritically of its “act ”’, for it 
seems to scatter impulses gathered for other 
purposes rather than exercise a specific im- 
pulse of its own. As a spill-way for energy 
or impulse no longer needed, it is peculiar 
among those combinations of emotion and 
action that invite the name of instinct. If 
laughter has a specific emotion at all, sheer 
telief would seem to be the strongest candidate 
for the office. But it seems clear that it 
does not confine itself to one emotion any 
more than it confines itself to breaking off 
163
-P-A-G-E-170
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
one call to action. The relief of laughter 
can disarm hostility as well as disable 
sympathy. The protean possibilities of 
laughter have constantly seduced theorists 
into choosing one of them to the exclusion 
of the rest. It can accept or reject, express 
a social welcome or suppress sympathy; it 
can break struggle into triumph or the call 
of a futile menace into scorn ; it can discipline 
by ridicule or humorously link men into 
sympathy. 
If every action into which we are inevitably 
thrown when the conditions are appropriate 
is an instinct, laughter is an instinct. If an 
instinct has a specific impulse, the instinctive- 
ness of laughter is more doubtful. If every 
instinct has its own private emotion and one 
only, laughter is no instinct. “There is 
a real distinction’’, wrote Reid, ‘“‘ between 
persons within the house, and those that are 
without it; yet it may be dubious to which 
the man belongs that stands upon the thres- 
hold’’*°. Laughter may be a troublesome 
threshold man—now asking for inclusion 
among instincts and now protesting against 
the inclusion. But it is more important to 
understand what laughter is than to arrange 
the definition of “instinct’”’ to its idiosyn- 
crasies. 
Eastman says that “ humorous emotion ”’ 
is an instinct because it is unique, does not 
analyse into more simple components, and, 
164
-P-A-G-E-171
“LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
in accordance with M*Dougall’s first test for 
an instinct, is socially infectious ?*. Insist- 
ence on these criteria would multiply instincts 
almost to the point of indecency, and, if 
laughter is simply to be a member of so 
motley an assemblage, let it be an instinct. 
But it must not be assumed, because of this 
inclusion, that laughter in general, which need 
not be amused or only amused, appropriates 
only one emotion and serves only one specific 
purpose. 
The “ mechanical motion’”’ of laughing is 
an indurated, innate habit impressed upon the 
human body that breaks other actions into 
relief. It may break the violent struggle of 
battle or the more subdued physical move- 
ments or tension of anticipatory attention. 
“The muscular actions constituting it are 
distinguished from most others” by being 
“ purposeless ”’ 22, if ‘‘ purposeless’’ means 
that it interrupts the purposes of other 
activities. Its purpose may, however, be the 
interruption of the activities it breaks and, 
perhaps, of their purposes. This purpose, if 
it is conceded, is reflected in its function of 
spill-way for gathered energy, whose super- 
fluity is expended on the body, and, perhaps, 
in the using up of “ energizing secretions ”’, 
such as the extra sugar in the blood, that the 
interrupted effort no longer requires ***. 
Secondary functions develop out of primary, 
and as the by-products of an industry may 
165
-P-A-G-E-172
LAUGHTER AND INSTINCT 
become more important or prominent than 
the original productions, become more signi- 
ficant than they. So laughter, originally a 
throwing of body (and mind) out of gear, 
seems, by an intimate association with the 
sense of the ludicrous, to have become an 
important contributor to the geniality of life, 
a check on folly, and, though it may be turned 
to base uses, a promoter of sane judgment. 
Since the moment of arrest favours the flow 
of emotion, whatever is the precise connection 
between emotion and action, the relief of 
laughter seems to be naturally qualified for 
emotional accompaniment, and, since the 
fundamental situation of relief varies with 
the nature of the broken activity, the emo- 
tional accompaniment is likely to be variable. 
Many emotions appear to gather naturally 
round laughter and the nature of laughter 
seems to invite their gathering. The sense 
of the ludicrous is a specific emotional accom- 
paniment of laughter in the sense that laughter 
is its only physical expression ; but in many 
laughs other emotions accompany amuse- 
ment, and every laugh need not be amused, 
though the comic tends to tinge and pervade 
all varieties of laughter.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE FUNCTION AND A{STHETICS OF 
LAUGHTER 
LAUGHTER, as Montaigne said of Aristotle, 
“hath an oare in every water, and medleth 
with all things ’’. Its infinite variety almost 
convinced Ribot that it had no single funda- 
mental cause #4. Now a busybody who inter- 
fered with a dozen matters in a forenoon might 
appear in too many different roles to seem to 
a casual observer to be definitely occupied. 
But the busybody has a single impulse to 
meddle, and laughter, though it would be 
unfairly described as a busybody, resembles 
him in being a confirmed meddler with a 
definite method of meddling. It meddles 
with all kinds of activities by breaking them 
off into relief and presenting an incongruity 
that stirs the sense of the ludicrous, when 
telaxation suddenly supervenes as effort or 
tension is suddenly interrupted. Thus 
laughter has a single source in a situation of 
incongruous relief and a nature as multiple 
as this situation is various. If ‘nearly all 
comic theorists are comic monists”’ and are 
167
-P-A-G-E-174
  
  ESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
“altogether persuaded that laughter must 
have one cate and one cause only.’ **, 
they may have sensed the ultimate singleness 
of all laughter. But they may have surren- 
dered to a lazy and erroneous presupposition, 
for the mind loves to make many things into 
one, as a tidy housewife loves to pack many 
garments into one chest. Comic laughter, 
also, is more easily referred to one cause 
than all the varieties of laughter collectively, 
and, in a sense rightly, since the sense of the 
ludicrous seems to be specially associated 
with a perception of the incongruity in the 
general situation of incongruous relief. 
The human mind, when its speculative 
fervour is fired, can be almost incredibly 
determined to compel things into singleness 
of aspect. The passionate monocentrism of 
much Hindu philosophy yearned so for one- 
ness that it denied reality to any change or 
anything that changed. The repetition of 
“the mystic syllable om” stupefied the 
devotee till he forgot there was anything else 
in the world; his intelligent moments were 
plied with a doctrine of the illusoriness of a 
world that deluded him till he realized its 
illusoriness ; his goal was a condition more 
remote from waking life than the fitful 
consciousness of dreaming sleep and more 
remote from it even than a sleep that is 
dreamless **. Such a regime for apprehend- 
ing the oneness of reality, by making the 
168
-P-A-G-E-175
ZESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
devotee so incapable of apprehending any 
disturbing change that he also became un- 
conscious of the oneness on which his soul 
was set, is the very ecstasy of monocentrism. 
Touches of this ecstasy are apt to betray the 
mind regularly into error. 
A single formula is to the philosophical 
mind what monogamy is to the ethical—an 
ideal goal. The collection, in Frith’s picture 
of Derby Day, of incidents dispersed through 
space and scattered through time under one 
view, places the mind’s hand on many things 
as though they were one. ‘The controlling 
conditions of the mind’s activity predispose . 
it to injudicious and even intemperate unifica- 
tion. ‘The seductiveness of wit, the theme of 
such solemn warnings by Hobbes, Locke, and. 
their successors, derives from an impulsive 
combination of two things into one through 
a remote likeness: when an illustration or a 
metaphor is mistaken for a real analogy 
unification is excessive. ‘Alertness of 
mind ’’, the “‘ flying abroad of all the faculties 
to the open doors and windows at every 
passing rumour’’, is more content with a 
miscellany than attention, which “is the 
concentration of every’ faculty “in a single 
focus, as in the alchemist over his alembic 
at the moment of expected projection ’’. 
Since ‘“‘ attention is the stuff that memory is 
made of’, and memory is not only “ accum- 
ulated genius’ *’ but the sign of compre- 
169
-P-A-G-E-176
ESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
hension, for we remember most easily what 
we comprehend most completely, the con- 
centrated act of attention is the method of 
the reflective mind. Now the act, of attention 
is not a fixed, unswerving stare, which is 
hypnotic, but a steadily poised look that, 
as it were, revolves round its object. Its 
appropriate object, therefore, is many things 
combined into one so that it can be grasped 
in a single act and correspond to the variations 
in the attentive movement. ‘‘ Marshal thy 
notions into a handsome method” for 
“things orderly fardled up under heads are 
» most portable” ** was Fuller’s maxim for 
remembering, and Sydney Smith echoed many 
before him, as he was echoed by many after 
him, by observing that ‘memory may be 
wonderfully strengthened by referring single 
facts and observations to one simple prin- 
ciple”’**. The monocentering mind, always 
seeking for one centre round which attention 
can revolve, is always attempting to convert 
the act of apprehension from an indiscriminat- 
ing sweep of things into an act of compre- 
hension which grasps a system of things both 
articulated and single. It strives to compre- 
hend as nearly as possible in one richly filled 
act of attention as much as it can as singly 
as it can. This is its strength and its weak- 
ness: its strength because it thus strengthens 
and completes understanding, its weakness 
because hankering after “one simple prin- 
170
-P-A-G-E-177
  ZESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
ciple ’’ sees more simply, in many instances, 
than it should. Things are not necessarily 
either as simple as we desire or simple in the 
way we simplify them. Thus a pardonable \ 
suspicion may linger round the universal — 
formula for laughter as a bodily and mental 
experience characterizing a situation of incon-_) 
gruous relief. But it seems possible to lull it 
by observing the characteristic mechanics of 
laughter that provides it with a backbone, 
by noting how this formula adapts itself 
to all varieties of laughing, as one mathe- 
matical equation expresses many different 
sections of a cone by assigning different 
constants to its variables, and by realizing 
how the many different theories regarding 
the nature and function of laughter circle 
round this formula—indicating it as the centre 
upon which they tend to converge. The 
generality of the formula, it must also be 
remembered, leaves plenty of scope for par- 
ticular analyses of particular laughters. No 
machine is fully explained by noting that it 
does not endeavour to supply more energy than 
is originally put into it and no laughter, prob- 
ably, is fully explained by the general formula. 
But the principle that all energy obtained from 
a machine must first be supplied to it regulates 
the performances of machinery and, similarly, 
the occurrences of a situation containing in- 
congruous relief regulate and determine the 
nature, origin and functions of laughter. 
17 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  ESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
Unless body and mind go their own ways, 
with no reck of each other, the mental accom- 
paniments of laughter must be intelligibly 
connected with its physical expression. If 
the physical expression is uniform, the many 
laughters must conform to a fundamental 
plan that can be read in the act of laughter. 
If the act of laughing breaks off an action 
and expends superfluity upon the body in a 
squandering upon a precipitated situation of 
relief, the emotions, and ideas so far as they 
exist, of the laughter must have an intelligible 
connection with this characteristic and uniform 
situation. \\If laughter is always a break, as 
~its characteristic “ mechanical motion” in- 
timates so distinctly, it will present itself in a 
single aspect throughout its varieties, and if it 
breaks in on many occasions it will differ with 
the situations it precipitates, for all relief is 
telief from something, and bare, abstract relief 
is less than a shadow. Relief, like most if no 
all else, is relative to circumstances and may 
be, as it were, a relative peace surrounded 
by storm.\ A frontiersman, when he came 
home, found his wife and children dead, 
scalped, and mutilated. He burst out laugh- 
ing and, constantly exclaiming: ‘it is the 
funniest thing I ever heard of’, laughed on 
convulsively till he ruptured a blood-vessel #*°. 
A hair’s-breadth divided this terrible laugh 
from a flood of tears. Warm hopes were 
suddenly broken and a quiescence, chill like 
172 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
death itself, settled on the wounded soul. A 
glimpse of the incongruity in the home- 
coming grimly engaged the sense of amuse- 
ment that confirmed body and soul in a relief 
too despairing to weep with even a sense of 
the vainness of effort. Nothing could be done 
—tears or laughter: what did it matter? 
Amusement chose a wild laugh. There was 
relief, as in all laughter, but it was a mere 
violent lull in a storm that must be faced 
again. The wild laugh was hollow and joy- 
less like the relief it expressed. Laughter 
may be terribly versatile—its relief may be 
hellish and its mirth joyless. 
In such a devil’s jest, expecting a home and 
finding a charnel-house, Angell might see a 
direful exaggeration of the disorganization 
always inflicted, though usually less savagely, 
by the joke?". Everything was broken for 
the frontiersman, and his laugh, as it destroyed 
his search for a house, left him nothing else 
to seek. The disorganization of normal 
laughter is more evanescent—breaking off ~ 
one activity and, after temporary disablement, 
most marked in the prostration of hearty 
laughter, freeing the laughter for others. 
“For the laugh”’, writes Greig, “is mani-- 
festly disorderly, in that it does not con- 
tribute towards the end of any behaviour of 
which a very young child can be supposed 
capable; and it retains this character in 
most of the behaviour of later life. It is 
173
-P-A-G-E-180
AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
generally interruptory and can only be 
regarded as contributory when it is deliber- 
ately used by the laugher’’, and, he adds, 
“the smile and the laugh are seldom more 
than mere flashes in behaviour” 2. Behay- 
iour is best judged by a systematized series 
of actions and not by single actions, as the 
course of a planet appears in its orbit and 
not in its momentary position. So the 
“behaviour-cycle’’, many actions combined 
into one deed under one purpose or impulse, 
is the favourite modern unit of behaviour. 
A leap from bed, a hurried toilette, a quick 
breakfast, a rush to the station, a purchased 
newspaper, a sequestrated seat in the train, 
and a continuous sequence of further actions, 
major and minor, compose a total behaviour- 
cycle of attention to business. It is good to 
think in wholes if the parts are not forgotten, 
but preoccupation with behaviour-cycles some- 
times has this forgetfulness. Holt almost 
suggests, if he does not nearly say, that the 
belated sleeper does not really jump from his 
bed when his rising is overdue because he is 
teally attending to business **. When behav- 
iour-cycles occupy thought, the fitfulness of 
laughter tends to dissipate any sense of its 
functions because its momentary appearances 
are “ mere flashes in behaviour ”’. 
— The mechanics of laughter, a transparent 
interruption of activity, intimates a signi- 
ficance for these intermittent appearances. 
174 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
Laughter breaks an adjustment when neither 
it nor any further adjustment is immediately 
needed: summoned energies are expended 
on the body because they are not required. 
Normally it disorganizes only by punctuating 
activity with relief. The laugh of triumph, 
after success in struggle, disorganizes fighting 
activity but the relief is welcome since it 
simply demobilizes what need no longer be 
mobilized. Laughter is, normally, disorgan- 
ization in the sense that military demobiliza- 
tion is disorganization—it dispenses with 
preparations that have served their purpose. 
The situation of relief intermittently precipi- 
tated by laughter is, whether primarily or 
secondarily, an important element in the 
behaviour-cycle, for it has a similar function 
to the rest during the route-march. It is 
a moment of recuperation, a respite in the 
present from immediate urgency in the future, 
and M*Dougall, though he theoretically con- 
fines laughter to the one duty of correcting 
excess of sympathy, notes that “the bodily 
movements of laughter . . . bring about a 
condition of euphoria or general well- 
being’ 2. It would be tedious to recite 
the testimonials to the euphoria of laughter. 
It is true, no doubt, as Greig insists, that 
pleasant movements usually contribute to 
the smooth movement of the whole behaviour- 
cycle while interruptory incidents are dis- 
pleasing ***: the business man is pleased if 
175 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
he catches his train and interjaculatory if 
he misses it. But laughter is, normally, as 
Socrates remarked of the jest, “‘a pleasant 
interruption ”’, and it is pleasant because its 
“interruption is relief—a relaxation from un- 
required effort. ‘“‘ The feeling of the whole 
behaviour ”’ does not give the whole “ key to 
the situation”, for pleasing laughter can 
suddenly break off an imminent quarrel. 
The general behaviour situation has its say : 
a situation of relief must be provided for the 
laugh. 
The grief of “the whole behaviour ’’, as 
the melancholy of Jacques spread through 
~all, may turn the natural joy of laughter into 
sadness, as the frontiersman’s laughter was 
grievous ***, but, since relief is usually 
pleasurable, saddened laughter is laughter 
deprived of its birthright. Laughter must 
be given its opportunities—this must be 
conceded to the behaviour-cycle; but it is 
a sign that an opportunity for relief has been 
accepted. It also seems, when it is carefully 
regarded, to try to make the best of its 
opportunities. 
Many things happen in the combination of 
body and mind whose activities constitute 
human life as if a purpose presided over its 
own welfare and over the welfare of its 
community. The private welfare of human 
——tife is more pertinent to the function of 
176
-P-A-G-E-183
  
AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
laughter and more pertinent also are those 
occurrences in mind and body that happen 
with spontaneous apartness from conscious 
will or purpose as if prompted by a vigilant 
guardian spirit. If the infant were not 
prompted to suck, it would die; coagulation 
tends to stanch the bleeding cut; the call 
of danger urges to safety by flight or braces 
for struggle; the finger sharply withdraws 
itself from the painful burn that would destroy 
it; thinking is often more like something 
happening to us than our own act, as if actu- 
ated by a purpose to compel us to know for 
our own good. Now laughter acts as if it 
has purpose in it. It happens to us, it occurs 
in us as our eyes wink, and we attempt to 
provoke it by a jest as we strike a finger at 
naturally winking eyes. It makes the rest 
of relief doubly recuperative, multiplies its 
pleasure and seeks from it a maximum of 
benefit. The sense of the ludicrous is in the 
true vein of laughter, for it enriches those 
halts that laughter makes contributary to the 
enhancement of life. Comic perception does 
enhance life, and in this unique achievement 
laughter constantly acts as though it sought 
to convert the act of breaking off activities 
into its greatest profit for the laugher. 
When the laugh is abnormal it acts as 
though it pursued its intent with mistaken 
zeal. Such mistaken zeal was the tragedy 
of the frontiersman’s laugh. His amusement 
177 M
-P-A-G-E-184
  ESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
was laughter striving to make of relief the 
greatest uplift. That sense of the ludicrous, 
intruding on grief, was laughter, strenuous 
in purpose, bent on its opportunity and eager 
for euphoria, aiming at exhilaration. If the 
man had wept he might have lived, for tears are 
the natural outlet of grief. Such destructive 
excess of zeal marks an inherent tendency in 
the occurrence of laughter to exploit the situa- 
tion of relief for the well-being of the laugher. 
As the laugh of triumph suffuses victory 
with a gratified sense of achievement, so comic 
perception suffuses pleasant interruptions with 
a greater elation. Laughter, in its purposeful 
aspect, for it has a purposeful aspect whether 
the wise decide that it is purposive or not, is 
the elater of pleasant interruptiveness. It 
adds a ‘‘sudden glory’ to the contempt of 
scorn as it does to the triumph of victory and, 
with less ungraciousness, to the ludicrously 
incongruous which is the incongruity of 
situations of relief. ‘This sense of the ludi- 
crous is laughter’s final perseverance in aiming 
at elation, its favourite method of obtaining 
it, and its principal, if not its only, claim to 
esthetic value. The “ happy convulsion ” of 
laughter begins its endeavour after the elation 
of pleasant interruption with a benefit to the 
body, and comic perception ends that endeav- 
our with a benefit more pre-eminently be- 
stowed upon the mind. 
178
-P-A-G-E-185
“ESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
Laughter turns relief to greater profit. It 
turns a diverted action into a pleasant 
gymnastic and makes the body glow with an 
exercise snatched from the hurry of life. The 
act of laughing is filled with the candour of 
laughter’s purpose. That rocking to and fro 
on which laughter expends the gathered 
energy it cuts short is an earnest of a continued 
  wa 
effort by the laugh. The laughing body is a_- 
relieved body under genial exercise, and that 
genial exercise turns relief to greater profit. 
The sense of the ludicrous does more exclus- 
ively for the mind what laughs do more 
exclusively for the body: thus laughing and 
comic perception march together, for both 
further the purpose in laughter to add exhil- 
aration to relief. 
All esthetic interests enhance life and 
enrich it with new values. ‘They also with- 
draw themselves partially from the stir, hurry, 
and pressure of affairs. This element of 
withdrawal is the constantly repeated burden 
of discussions on esthetics. Aisthetic objects, 
says Lord Balfour, using “ zesthetic ”’ in a wide 
sense, have value because they arouse contem- 
plative emotions, self-contained and_ self- 
sufficient, that subserve no purpose**’. They 
do not, that is, serve purposes that are 
somewhat indefinitely, though on the whole 
intelligibly, termed useful or practical. If 
beauty is a non-erroneous illusion, as Professor 
Alexander suggests ***, it neither invites logical 
179 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
  AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
protest nor requires practical participation— 
for illusion is no appropriate stimulus to 
action. A third philosopher, Schopenhauer, 
expresses from a different aspect the same 
eesthetic withdrawal from the practical 
urgency of life. In beauty, he says, pure 
knowledge reigns without effort and the 
beautiful does not excite the will. The 
beautiful thing is observed objectively and 
apart from all relations as the expression of an 
idea***, If the beautiful thing is ringed off, 
it is detached from the practical realm, 
as a city is isolated by its wall from ordinary 
attack. If “any work of fine art, anything 
we call beautiful, has a certain independence 
and completeness in itself’ 27°, it is with- 
drawn from the struggle for achievement. 
Mr Roger Fry repeats the same thought 
differently by insisting on the unity necessary 
for the restful contemplation of works of art *”, 
and Professor Carveth Read by emphasizing 
the acquisition of esthetic value by rites and 
incantations that are not intended to incite 
to immediate action?”. If “ zesthetic apprecia- 
tion’, as rendered by Mr Charles Marriott, 
“is dependent on the sense, which may not 
be conscious, of practical problems effectively 
solved ’’ 27*, it is still restfully withdrawn from 
practical urgency. Art, according to Miss 
Jane Harrison, springs ‘‘ from perception and. 
emotion that have somehow not found im- 
mediate outlet in practical action ”’ **. 
180
-P-A-G-E-187
AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
Through differences in estimate and through 
differences of approach upon the esthetic 
there runs a common perception of the 
spectatorial quality in esthetic appreciation. 
As in the three hours’ traffic of the stage we 
appreciatively observe life without sharing it, 
so esthetic experience is a contemplative 
respite from action that has its own peculiar 
exhilaration. ‘The function, or a function, of 
zesthetic or artistic experience is to exhilarate 
a partial break with active life. 
Amusement, comic perception, the sense 
of the ludicrous, since laughter is a complete 
momentary break into relief, might seem to 
be the acme of esthetic experience. Aisthetic 
contemplation lodged in a partial break, in a 
survey of life that is detached from practical 
participation without absolute loss of touch, 
might appear as the less developed, and the 
ecstasy of amused laughter that throws the 
laugher clean back upon himself, as the more 
developed, esthetic experience. Mr Bullough, 
who is reluctant to admit laughter and even 
comedy to esthetic status, decides that “ both 
to laugh and to weep are direct expressions 
of a thoroughly practical nature, indicating 
almost always a concrete personal affection ”’. 
He felicitously describes the detachment of 
zsthetic contemplation from active life as 
“psychical distance”. By “psychical dis- 
tance”’ the esthetic object is put “out of 
gear with practical needs and ends” and 
181  
-P-A-G-E-188
  AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
involved in a peculiar personal relation filtered 
from its practical, concrete appeal, as an 
artist, voyaging through fog, may lose his 
sense of danger, cease to shrink from his 
clammy wrappings, and find an esthetic 
joy in the colour and obscurities of his sur- 
roundings?*. The practical appeal of the 
fog to the danger-instincts and feelings of 
discomfort is diverted into an appeal to the 
more contemplative esthetic sensibilities. 
The fog is, as it were, held at arm’s length 
‘from life, and seen, because no perception 
of danger numbs the seeing, to be beautiful. 
But laughter seems to drop while the sense 
of the beautiful still holds, though at arm’s 
length, for laughter is originally a sudden 
snapping of a practical tie and preserves this 
fundamental character in all its forms. If 
“the comic ’’, which is said to be “not co- 
extensive with the laughable as a whole”’, 
apparently to admit “humour” to esthetic 
status, is to be denied esthetic rank, the 
denial should apparently be made because 
laughter breaks too violently with practical 
demand. Comic perception should lapse, if 
it does lapse, from esthetic standing because, 
in Bullough’s terminology, it ‘“‘ over- 
distances’, though he accuses it of ‘‘ under- 
distancing ’’. Comedy, he says, is hedonic, 
not esthetic: its relish derives from its 
“practical personal appeal ’’ of ordinary life. 
Humour, for Bullough, is ‘“ distanced ridi- 
182

-cule”’: ridicule esthetically converted from 
a weapon to an object of esthetic contem- 
plation. He should have been warned by the 
laugh to be wary of stretching humour on 
his Bed of Procrustes, for the table set on a 
roar is not the more quiet rapture of beauty : 
he has succumbed to tradition and found a 
permanent element of ungraciousness in the 
heritage of laughing. Even humour, he 
thinks, has fangs that have a pleasing snap 
though they do not bite. But when we laugh 
at childish naiveté, contrasting immature 
experience with maturity to come, there 
need be no ridicule, and is none if the laugher 
loves the child. Relief opens laughter to 
sympathy on the one hand even if it does 
open it to contempt on the other. Childish 
errors are amusing and need not be ridiculous, 
since a natural immaturity invites no logical 
condemnation. Childish naiveté is a great 
occasion for the sympathetic sense of the 
ludicrous most appropriately assigned to 
humour, and may have been one of its prin- 
cipal promoters. 
The salvage of ‘ humour ”’ from the esthetic 
wreck of comedy by “ distancing ’’ ridicule 
denotes an unsuccessful attempt to settle the 
eesthetic claims of laughter. If esthetic signi- 
ficance proceeds from ‘‘ psychical distance ” 
it is, in one aspect, a recompense, perhaps 
with interest, for removal from the fervent 
stir of life. ‘‘ Distancing”’ life’s tyrannies

sometimes extracts from them an esthetic 
recompense, as Omat’s 
“The Flower that once has blown for ever dies”’ 
takes its csthetic recompense from the evan- 
escence of life. 
If “the feeling of comedy arises so far as 
anything which is significant or impressive, 
or which seems so to us, comes short, for us, 
of its significance or impressiveness”’ *7*, if 
“the occasion of laughter is some seeming, 
some keeping of the word to the ear and eye, 
whilst it is broken to the soul’ 277, comic 
perception may simultaneously express the 
break of expectancy upon incongruity and 
recompense for the break. The “ possible 
comic elements”’ in “all embodiments of 
thought, passion, and volition which fall 
considerably below the normal standard” 
may be the potential recompense of expect- 
ancy which, as it rises high, is compelled to 
fall low. We expect great passion from a 
lover, even from Slender, and no mere “ pain- 
ful obligation of making love’’. So, when 
Slender’s ‘‘ love of sweet Anne Page is so faint 
a velleity that he is compelled to borrow all 
the suggestions of his passion from his 
uncle ”’*7*, he bestows upon us a comic 
compensation for a hero of love. Little 
Slender, in his role of lover, masquerades as 
someone great. The exposure of pettiness 
under the imposing front of seeming grandeur 
184

is, for Lipps, the occasion of the comic ?’*. 
If laughter is always purposeful, as though it 
ever sought to elate with the squanderings of 
gathered energies, comic perception may be 
the recompense for hopes foiled when rich 
promise ends in lean performance. 
If amusement is a recompense secured by 
laughter from broken expectations and hopes, 
artistic comedy may triumphantly enjoy a 
broken beauty. Hegel does sum up comedy 
as a triumph over contradictions and ruined 
purposes **°, Mr Carritt, accepting from Croce 
the notion that esthetic defect is a defect in 
expressiveness, and combining it with Hegel’s 
hint, seeks the source of the ludicrous in the 
expression of an esthetic failure in expressive- 
ness. He is as convinced that amusement 
is an esthetic satisfaction as Bullough is 
convinced that normally it is not, and dis- 
covers the typically amusing thing in a work 
of art that misses the mark. In combining 
triumph over hostility and incongruity into 
the ludicrous, he specially commends Hegel 
for observing that comedy is the breakdown 
of art, and Bergson for coming very near the 
truth by regarding the funny as something 
unsuccessfully claiming to be alive. The 
inclusion of triumph over hostility is appar- 
ently a deference to Plato and Hobbes, who 
included it in their estimates of laughter 2. A 
livelier sense of the protean nature of laughter 
and a keener sense of the commingling of 
185
-P-A-G-E-192
A. Ar 
  AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
feelings in it might have prevented this 
marriage of triumph to pure comic sensibility. 
Triumph is elated and the sense of the ludi- 
crous is elated, but two elations are not 
necessarily united into one. If any restriction 
is placed on the esthetic status of the comic, 
and to admit every flash of amusement to 
zesthetic rank seems to be libertine liberality, 
the purely comic, the unpolluted sense of the 
ludicrous, should surely alone be included. 
If humour is a form of expression twice 
removed from the crude emotional material 
of life, being an expression of a failure to 
express, the inclusion of triumph in the 
eesthetic satisfaction of amusement at the least 
arouses misgivings. A clear recognition of 
the sympathy in humour, for Carritt seems to 
use “humour” as an equal equivalent for 
the sense of the ludicrous, for ‘‘ comic’’, 
might have doubled these misgivings and per- 
haps have surrendered to them. Both the 
sympathy of humour and the triumphing of 
a victorious comedy may seem too participa- 
tory in life to be artistic in the narrow sense. 
Bullough’s ‘“‘ distanced ridicule’, which con- 
templates triumph without feeling it, seems 
nearer to the truth of humour than Carritt’s 
triumphant sense of incongruity to the truth 
of comedy. 
Laughter’s esthetic status is perplexing, as 
its instinctive status is perplexing. Its pro- 
tean nature, connected with its peculiar 
186
-P-A-G-E-193
  AESTHETICS OF LAUGHTER 
dependence on relief, inclines it impartially _ 
towards many different classifications. It can 
fill with animus ; it can fill with sympathy ; 
it can be impartially free from both. It can 
arrest instincts, and simultaneously claim to 
, be an instinctive method of interrupting them. 
It can make life wholesome and keep it sane ; 
it can also degenerate into “‘ fun in Bagdad ¥ 
and make life a chaos. Its role is most clear 
as an elater of situations of relief. It works 
ill or well according to its background: a 
rich life laughs richly and a petty life laughs 
meanly. \Laughter acts and works as if the 
fai ‘inction had been assigned to it of making 
\the utmost of situations of relief. The sense 
of the ludicrous, the characteristic and 
peculiar emotional accompaniment of laughter 
though not its only one, is intelligible in the 
light of this function without being fully 
explained.

  CHAPTER XII 
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
Way, asks Mr Max Beerbohm, does the public 
laugh when an actor has to say “damn” ? 
An adequate theory of laughter, just as it 
must explain why nursery tickling is laugh- 
able, must explain why this “ damn ”’ is funny 
and the ludicrous element, also queried by 
Mr Beerbohm, in the stage kiss and the stage 
meal 28°, 
“Tf you prick us, do we not bleed? If you 
tickle us, do we not laugh ? If you poison us, 
do we not die? ; and if you wrong us, shall 
we not revenge ?”’ The tickle and the laugh 
are not as inevitably conjoined as poison and 
death, though Shylock implied that they are. 
His mistake is less: likely to be repeated in 
Max Beerbohm’s three problems, for the 
expletive, the kiss, and the meal are not in 
themselves amusing experiences, though they 
can stir the spectator to laughter. As the 
laughterless tickle may become an occasion 
of laughter, so damning, kissing, and eating 
may provoke merriment. 
188
-P-A-G-E-195
  
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
A swerve of mental centering from the 
pseudo-reality of the stage to the reality of 
life is probably responsible for laughter at 
stage-kissing and stage-eating. The accepted 
illusion of the play is momentarily dropped 
for a suggestion of reality. Thus the kiss 
becomes no kiss, for the audience simultane- 
ously expects the passion it should express 
and feels its make-believe. A mechanical 
performance masquerades as romance ; then, 
as attention drops from its momentary draw- 
ing towards reality into realization of counter- 
feit, the mask falls and amusement is stirred 
by the incongruity in a situation of relief. 
_ So, also, the meal becomes no meal and the 
audience laughs at an excessive gusto that 
tempts sympathetic participation high and 
drops it low. 
The sense of the ludicrous is always ready 
at a play for the slipping of its leash by this 
swerve in mental centering. If any auditor at 
any moment elects to consider the incidents 
as though they happened in a room without 
losing his sense of their occurrence on a stage, 
he makes them ludicrous. Much ado about 
nothing is always potentially ludicrous if there 
is no serious issue, and stage traffic known 
to be such and judged as real life becomes 
simply histrionic fuss. This ludicrous con- 
trast between apparent and simulated signi- 
ficance occurs more spontaneously when the 
dramatic quality of the play cannot continu- 
189
-P-A-G-E-196
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
ously persuade the audience to accept the 
stage-illusion. A melodramatic touch is often 
too much for gravity: the impetuous, over- 
violent villain reminds expectation too 
forcibly that the brandished dagger is a 
stage gesture and that the murderous threats 
are repeated nightly. In some moods the 
stage pageant is fiercely contrasted with the 
urgency of life : 
«‘What’s Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba 
That he should weep for her ?”’ 
Hamlet was too impassioned to be amused ; 
in happier moods the importunity of wild 
stage-tears is ludicrous if it stirs a contrast 
between what should be grief and is not. 
The stage-oath is probably accepted pre- 
cisely as it would be accepted off the stage 
and comic for the same reason as an oath in 
ordinary life is comic. Relief by ment 
explosion is the essence of the “damn”. 
Laughter is thus provided with its funda- 
mental situation. The spectator receives the 
principal benefit from this fundamental situ- 
ation, since his secondhand feeling of relief is 
more free from the annoyance that may curb 
laughter in the swearer. His sense of incon- 
gruity is also heightened as if the commination 
service had been read over a teasing fly. 
The theological anathema of the oath is 
preserved in the sentiment against its use, 
though the explicit meaning is lost in its simple 
190
-P-A-G-E-197
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
use as an expletive, and the sense of relief 
is also heightened by a sense of escape from 
conventional repression. If outraged senti- 
ment does not forbid laughter, the flouting of 
a public ban incites in the spectator a joyous 
sense of freedom from repression, and the 
oath is hailed as an escape from bondage. 
If the stage-oath is more freely comic than a 
teal oath it is because it provokes less easily 
public resentment against it. The actor is 
permitted to swear as he is permitted to 
murder—because he does not really do it. 
The relieved discharge of the oath and its 
incongruous occurrence in despite of public 
ban is an example of the ludicrous in relief 
from repression. There seems to be abun- 
dance of relief in the oath: it scatters a 
gathered anger, defies a public convention, 
and may also suggest to the spectator an 
attack which fails to mature by converting 
a blow into an expletive. 
The “damn ”’ theory of laughter, if pictur- 
esque rather than accurate definition is allowed 
for the moment, is now enjoying a vogue. 
So far as a ‘‘ damn ”’ is letting out something 
that should be, or is actually being, kept in, 
it is typical of the “letting the cat out of 
the bag” by which Holt describes Freud’s 
theory of wit and humour 2*. 
Witticisms, according to Freud, are success- 
ful escapes from suppression. Harmless wit 
tevels in absurdities and plausible nonsense 
19
-P-A-G-E-198
  LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
that soothe the protest of reason: thoughts 
are wittily disguised to deceive judgment and 
escape from its critical ban, as they mas- 
querade in dreams to slip past the “ censor ’’. 
“ Tendency-wit ” indulges either an attack 
that without its witty expression would 
remain a suppressed hostility or a verbal 
exposure of the indecent that would otherwise 
remain an ungratified wish. Wit eludes a 
hindrance and secures pleasure from sources 
that would be inaccessible, through repression, 
without its aid. Witty expression makes 
childish playful nonsense worthy of an adult, 
for he can talk like a child if he can wittily 
persuade reason that he speaks like a man. 
The hostile man can satisfy his animus if 
he disarms his enemy and gratifies his audience 
by the wittiness of his attack. The man who 
is partial to indecency can talk freely of it 
if he speaks wittily. Thus the lover of 
juvenile irresponsibility or of belligereney or 
of the obscene can indulge his preference if 
he can summon enough wit to break through 
the restriction imposed upon him by good 
sense or good manners. He can be silly or 
impolite or rebellious or bitter or indecent if 
he can be witty enough to parry the censure 
he would incur if he were any of these without 
being witty as well. 
“Tendency-wit ’’, serving hostility or in- 
decency, develops out of an original and 
juvenile wit of playful childish irresponsibility. 
192
-P-A-G-E-199
  LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
This original wit secures its pleasure from its 
technique, which is essentially economical. It 
is economical by condensing joyous festivities 
into “‘ alcoholidays’”’ or by double meaning 
in Douglas Jerrold’s ascription to a father 
who had cut off his heir with a shilling of 
“unremitting kindness” or by other carefully 
specified methods. When Freud remarks that 
wit saves nothing by its technique because it 
laboriously searches for its words and imitates 
the housewife who spends time and money 
on transit to buy vegetables where they are a 
cent cheaper, he does not seem to realize fully 
that its essence is decisiveness, usually secured 
in part by conciseness, of expression. The 
final sword-stroke is decisive, and results in 
victory though the duel and the victor’s 
apprenticeship to swordsmanship may have 
been long. Though he seems for the most 
part to recognize the importance of brevity 
for the witticism, he does not sufficiently 
recognize the higher functions of wit. 
“ Tendency-wit ” derives pleasure, like play- 
ful wit, from its technique and adds to it the 
satisfaction of a gratified and repressed 
tendency ?**. The witty illumination of a 
truth, which need not fear scrutiny from 
reason nor be a pretext for either hostility 
or indecency, is very incompletely recognized. 
“Experience is a good schoolmaster, but the 
school-fees are somewhat heavy ”’ is both good. 
wit and good sense: it has a poignant sense of

-P-A-G-E-200
  LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
truth, contains no hostile stab, and has no 
relish of the indecent. 
Freud’s theory of wit centres, and, it may 
be added, centres too exclusively, on the pro- 
viding of laughter with its situation of relief 
by the release of a repression. The joy of 
wit and the emotion suffusing its laughter, 
so far as it does laugh, should depend on the 
gratification of suppressed tendencies—wit 
results in something resembling triumph and 
the enjoyment of it. Mr Eastman accuses 
Freud of an awkward attempt to combine 
this estimate with a theory of economized 
psychic energy and of contriving an ill- 
assorted alliance between himself, Herbert 
Spencer, and Lipps—discharge of surplus 
energy being the formula for laughter adopted 
by his two injudiciously selected allies 2*°. 
Greig remarks, less disapprovingly, that Freud’s 
* theory of wit is not, and should not be con- 
sidered as, a complete theory of laughter. 
“For Freud’, he adds, ‘“‘ wit is one thing, 
the comic another, and humour a third ”’ 87. 
Eastman’s criticism perhaps touches a mudd- 
ling in Freud’s application of one formula to 
the witty, the comic, and the humorous: 
“The pleasure of wit originates from an 
economy of expenditure in inhibition, of the 
comic from an economy of an expenditure 
in thought, and of humour from an economy 
of an expenditure in feeling ’’***. Econom- 
ized inhibition seems to be a muddled descrip- 
194
-P-A-G-E-201
  
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
tion of a witticism that releases hostility from 
repression by the force of its wit. Economized 
energy also seems a curious description of the 
comic in a clown who fusses round a circus 
without doing anything. Laughter is a spill- 
way for the dissipation of expectant prepara- 
tion, as when, to use one of Freud’s own 
illustrations, a clown plants himself firmly to 
catch a very light ball. If “ economized ” 
energy means energy applied to securing 
comic or humorous effect when it is not 
required for its original purpose, wit has been 
forcibly fitted into the common formula. 
Freud himself contrasts wit with comic effect 
as ‘‘made”’ to‘‘found”’. Without arguing the 
point, without attempting to follow the 
intricacies of Freud’s thought, or without 
suggesting that wit economizes expenditure 
by substituting satirical attack for a blow, 
it should be noted that for Freud wit is 
different from comic laughter. He seems to 
be aware, though his sense of the fact may be 
disturbed and even vague, that wit, through 
its decisiveness, may provide the situation of 
relief so fundamental and essential to laughter. 
In quoting Fischer’s “the judgment which 
produces the comic contrast is wit’ ***, and 
in referring to Lipps’ connection of wit with 
a “conscious and clever evocation of the 
comic ’’#°°, Freud hints at the provision by 
wit of the incongruity that gives to comic 
perception its opportunity. He hovers round 
195 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
the conception of the sense of the ludicrous 
as the more purely mental analogue of the 
more purely physical situation of relief. As 
the laughter of triumph arises when success 
calls off gathered energies and drops into 
sudden relief, so comic laughter arises when 
excited expectancy is suddenly relieved from 
its tension, though its perception of an incon- 
gruity, of a contrast administering a psychical 
shock that contains relief and a relieved 
pleasure, charges it with its own specific 
emotion of amusement. He suggests that 
the comic effect is a difference between two 
expenditures of energy, the one of “ feeling 
one’s self into something” and the other of 
an actual expenditure by the ego. We per- 
ceive an energetic (and futile) clown and the 
difference between our own sympathetic real- 
ization of his physical energy and our own 
private mental diminution of it by simply 
perceiving or thinking of it creates a contrast 
between too much in the physical and too 
little in the mental. He hardly seems to 
recognize the importance of the futile element 
in such comic effects : we expect great results 
from the clown’s vigour and discover very 
little ones. 
Humorous laughter, as understood in these 
chapters, permits the ready diffusion of 
sympathy rather than economizes it as in 
Freud’s estimate?". The main significance 
of Freud’s contribution, from the point of 
196
-P-A-G-E-203
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
view maintained in this book, is the emphasis 
upon release of repression as one begetter of 
the situation of incongruous relief that gener- 
ates laughter. Miss Bliss also emphasizes 
release of repression, though she places it in 
a different setting. Civilization imposes 
restraints on the natural man, who laughs 
when he suddenly escapes from them 2”. 
Belligerent wit as construed by Freud and 
laughter as “a return to nature’’ as Miss 
Bliss construes it, have a certain resemblance 
to an imprecatory ‘“‘damn’”’. Without press- 
ing the comparison of these released repression 
theories to the expletive or dwelling on their 
relation to the “ unconscious ”’ or the “ sub- 
conscious’, which is an important item in 
modern “‘repression’’ doctrines, they may 
be observed to circle round the fundamental 
conception of relief that provides an adequate 
mental standpoint for regarding laughter. 
Release of repression is obviously one method 
of securing relief and stimulating amused 
laughing by an ifcongruity. It is also a 
particular instance’ of the method of laughter. 
Laughter pleasantly breaks off an activity ; 
it relaxes an unrequired effort, whether more 
exclusively in the physical sphere as in sheer 
laughter of relief or more ‘exclusively in the 
mental sphere as in comic laughter ; when it 
breaks the pressure of inhibition it pleasantly 
interrupts the ‘effort’? of repression. 
Laughter arises when gathered energies are 
197
-P-A-G-E-204
  LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
suddenly called off, and the relief of released 
repression adds one more illustration of the 
“many waters”? in which the “‘“oare’”’ of 
laughter dips. 
A sympathetic sense of escape from repres- 
sion laughs when Mr Charles Chaplin, ob- 
serving a fine lady haughtily staring at him 
through her lorgnette, steps up to her and 
slaps her face. Convention forbids him to 
slap—but he does it. The comic sense, 
always adding its own gusto to the laughable 
situation, revels also in the incongruity of 
an expected deference in the actor, expected 
because social convention ordains it, and an 
actual rudeness. Charlie says ‘‘ damn you” 
with his hand. He should not do it, but, 
when he does, the act is ludicrous. A satis- 
faction over a ruffling of dignified rudeness 
also helps the ludicrous situation along. Mr 
Charles Chaplin, according to Mr Eastman, 
ascribes his comic effects to “‘ telling them the 
plain truth about things”: the fine lady 
deserves a slap, and she gets it. Now we 
may be, as Eastman says, “ always hungry 
for the simple truth ’’?*, but we are not 
necessarily amused when we get it, any more 
than we necessarily laugh when we eat.- The 
truth-telling theory of laughter, or comic 
laughter, is only partial, for only some truths 
and only some methods of telling them are 
funny. A student will probably laugh or 
198
-P-A-G-E-205
LAUGHTER AND REPRESSION 
smile if told that he has passed his examina- 
tion, but, though he hears the ‘‘simple truth ’”’, 
he will not laugh, or only smile the rueful 
smile that is no smile, if told that he has not 
passed. Truth and truth-telling are not in- 
herently laughable or comic. An unexpected 
home-truth may be funny if it disconcerts 
the victim, not because truth is funny but 
because he gets something he did not expect. 
Mr Chaplin’s slap is funny because the slappee 
suddenly and forcibly realizes how very 
annoyed he is. It is funny because the 
audience sympathetically realizes the relief, 
so predisposing to laughter, of a vented 
annoyance, and, expecting conventional if 
strained politeness, observes an unconventional 
slap. 
The laughter of the situation of relief 
through relieved repression, like laughter 
arising out of other reliefs, may suffuse its 
sense of the ludicrous with other feelings. 
A critic of the leisured classes might satisfy 
his animus in the Chaplin slap and satisfy it 
more if it occurred in real life. So also 
repressed contempt_or repressed scorti or 
repressed self-importance may empty. them- 
selves in a laugh. 
Wit can provide laughter with its situation, 
and repression, when sharply relieved, is one 
distinct, and perhaps important, contributor 
to those breaks into relief from which the 
laugh arises.

CHAPTER XIII 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
LAUGHTER makes no secret of its infinite 
variety. Almost any joke can be taken in 
many different ways and relished in many 
different spirits. 
Lady : “So you don’t believe in politics, Giles?” 
Gardener ; ‘“‘ Yes, mum, I does, just as I believe in the 
wire-worm—you can’t ’elp it when you sees the 
mischief they do.” 
This joke may be taken ludicrously, as a sheer 
amused delight in the double turn given to 
the inquirer’s expectation—first onto an 
emphatic, unanticipated belief and secondly on 
to a disconcerting reason for it. A confirmed 
politician or political enthusiast might relish 
its comic aspect without even a slight sense 
of sting. An anti-political orator might insist 
on the sting; in the heat of controversy 
the joke might be resented as a blow and 
answered with one. Laughter at this joke 
may be purely comic, or’ amusedly and 
playfully enjoy a “ dig ’’, or it may be openly 
derisive. 
200
-P-A-G-E-207
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
—..A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear that hears 
it ; its character also depends on the spirit 
that takes it. Laughter can be unfairly 
suspected of derision or of cruelty when it is 
merely exuberant or appreciative of the comic 
because the occasion, as in stage quips or 
buffetings, could gratify a cruel or derisive 
laugh. Derision-theories of laughter have 
perhaps sometimes failed to perceive that 
what could be derision or cruelty is, in the 
laughable occasion, in actual fact comic. 
The possibility of suspecting ungracious ele- 
ments in jokes relished for their ludicrous 
zest and the possibility of enjoying them 
cruelly or triumphantly or contemptuously: 
indicate that laughter can be scornful or 
triumphant or cruel. 
It seems clear that laughter can whole- ~ 
heartedly express battle-triumph or be filled_— 
with scorn or self-congratulation. It seems 
equally clear that the purely genial laughter 
of greeting or the hilarious laughter of play 
is different from the ungracious laughters on 
the one hand and from comic laughter on 
the other. Sheer relief also seems to be a 
species of latighter. Though these feelings or 
emotions mingle, their mingling can be realized 
and their separate naturés distinguished. 
Since sympathy seems obvious in some laughs 
and anti-sympathetic feelings in others, the 
act of laughing seems to be a rendez-vous for 
very various emotions.. The laughter of 
201
-P-A-G-E-208
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
greeting alone is a troublesome occurrence 
for theories of laughter that are too exclusive 
in their definitions. Laughter seems to insist 
on its own variety and to demand a “ formula 
or set of formule” for some “things in 
general”’ such as Mr Max Beerbohm depre- 
cates», His deprecation is intelligible if the 
while richness of laughter is expected in the 
formula. A single formula can never wholly 
contain many things or one of them. But 
the collection of many laughters round the 
single act of laughing or smiling and their free 
mingling round that ‘“‘ mechanical motion ” 
suggests a fundamental situation common 
to all laughs from which they all spring. 
Laughter also seems to be a very sensitive 
thing. The ways men laugh and the things 
they laugh at are excellent indexes of their 
ea Anger is resistant to sympathy. 
It may be controlled by its miliew—indulged, 
for example, where morals are undisciplined, 
and restricted where they are not ; but it is 
not in itself sympathetic. Laughter freely 
admits sympathy or animus. The sensitive- 
ness of laughter to the character, circum- 
stances, and experience of the laugher and 
the many varieties it displays can be con- 
nected with one fundamental element that 
systematizes the laughters into a single well 
defined group. 
The richness of variety in laughter has 
tempted many to exclaim against attempts 
202 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
to refer its varieties to a single source and the 
rich variety of theories tempts to belief in 
their protests. But there must be some funda- 
mental connection between all experiences 
that announce themselves ‘“ physically in the 
pleasant spasms we call laughter’’. There must 
be some mental standpoint which secures the 
varieties of laughter, its numerous occasions 
and all interpretations of its nature that have 
any degree of discernment in a single per- 
spective. This standpoint is attained and 
the perspective secured by observing the 
fundamental plan of which all laughters are 
variants. The mechanics of laughter hints 
very plainly at this fundamental plan. This 
hint has been accepted restrictively and 
laughter confined to one emotion. But 
M°Dougall’s restriction of:laughter to the one 
specific emotion of amusement does not 
mislead a clear realization of the emotional 
variety in laughter, and the distinct hint 
in the mechanics of laughtef then reveals a 
common character in the many laughters. 
The “ happy convulsion ”’ of laughter occurs™ 
in a situation of relief. It collapses the 
laugher into a stationary exerciser of his own 
body who is convulsively withdrawn from 
intervention in the active affairs of life. It 
marks the sudden relaxation of unrequired 
effort, and its repetitive series of respiratory 
explosions or tremulation of body, more

  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
vigorously or more quietly, rehearses an orig- 
inal situation in which a call upon effort is 
sharply called off. The original, more 
physical situation of the laugher is too plainly 
exposed in the motions of his body to be 
mistaken. As a spring firmly pressed against 
an obstacle vibrates when the obstacle is 
withdrawn, so the body shakes to and fro, 
with gasps in its breathing, in tremulous 
laughter, when its effort suddenly relaxes into 
telief. A quick interruption of activity that 
precipitates into relief is the essential char- 
acteristic of laughter as it is revealed in its 
characteristic bodily expression. Laughter is 
/a diversion—a pleasant expenditure upon the 
body of energy released from other activities. 
The physical act of laughing clearly invites 
an ample interpretation of the nature of 
laughter and warns the theorist against con- 
fining it too narrowly. ‘“The laugh thus 
marks an interruption to the behaviour of 
love which has been overcome with a less 
expenditure of energy than was originally 
prepared for the purpose’ ***. It may mark 
the interruption of any behaviour and is 
not confined to “overcoming”. The exul- 
tant laugh of triumph or elated laughter 
over sudden success rejoices in overcoming 
but the sudden withdrawal of a menace results 
in a laugh that has no sense of victory. The 
sense of the ludicrous that steadily tends to 
suffuse all laughter with amusement has 
204
-P-A-G-E-211
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
perhaps a freer scope in laughters which have 
little sense of conquest. Overcoming is apt 
to fill the laugh with triumph or with some 
more genial gusto of gratified accomplishment. 
The interval of relief, in which laughter 
arises, is closely connected with play and is 
apt to arise sharply and repeatedly in the 
hilarious or holiday mood. Since laughter is 
always a momentary holiday, a relaxation, it 
is appropriate to the mental mood that 
reaches its height in the spirit of carnival. 
Many thinkers have hovered round this con- 
nection between laughter and play—often 
perilously, for they have succumbed to the 
temptation of construing laughter too 
narrowly by confining it to a connection with 
play. The interval of relief, in which laughter 
arises, is also closely connected with serious- 
ness. The highest laughter, indeed, is a 
momentary lapse from earnestness. Since 
play itself is often serious and may, as when 
men begin playing golf in the intervals of 
business and end by doing business in the 
intervals of golf, become more serious than 
more important activities, it is not the in- 
dispensable genial source of all laughters. 
Play may make itself comic by an overplus 
of seriousness, as golf and other sports would. 
often make the gods on Olympus laugh, if 
they were there to laugh, by the enthusiasm 
and diligence to which they frequently stir 
their devotees. But neither play nor more

  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
important endeavour is the sole or essential 
milieu of laughter. 
Laughter is an interjection into the behav- 
iour of human beings and is apt to be inter- 
jected whenever relaxation occurs through the 
interruption of unrequired effort. It may be 
genially interjected into ungenial behaviour. 
Two boys faced one another with angry looks : 
a fight was rapidly accumulating in their 
words and gestures. Suddenly a small on- 
looker perceived the ludicrous in the situation 
and laughed. ‘The laugh spread through the 
group of onlooking boys and then, probably 
unintentionally on their part and perhaps to 
their chagrin, for boys delight in a fight, 
promptly incapacitated the two opponents, 
from fighting by spreading to them. This 
little incident is an effective warning against 
the assumption that, because play and laughter 
are both genial moods, they have an insepar- 
able or even a specially close connection. 
Play occurs in the intervals between more 
serious matters and in this sense is relaxation. ° 
But since laughter, as is written on its physical 
manifestation, is an absolute relaxation, a 
dropping into relief, a break in action, there 
is no more necessary a connection between 
laughter and play than there is between 
laughter and any form of activity. Play and 
the carnival mood usually permit situations 
of relief to occur freely: to this extent 
laughter and holidays may be said to have a

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
special connection. Business is constantly 
calling for effort and sustaining the call; 
holidays free the laugher from such a sus- 
tained call on his energies and allow him to 
drop frequently into the relief situation of 
laughter. But laughter may be interjected 
whenever and wherever a call upon effort 
is suddenly called off into relief. 
The relaxation of the laugh is an invitation 
to all appropriate emotions : to triumph when 
relief comes from a sword-thrust or other 
stroke of achievement, to scorn when the call 
of a threat is sharply followed by a sense of 
its futility, to greeting when the tension of 
social intercourse drops at the discovery of a 
friend. The most original emotional oO 
paniment of the laugh is probably sheer relief, 
and is associated with the most physical form 
of the occasion of laughter. Its relieved 
relaxation both opens it to sympathy and 
allows animus to linger. Thus laughter is 
always protean—impartially hospitable to 
many emotions and maintaining the integrity 
of society by the double method of linking 
its members in sympathy and correcting 
their faults by ridicule, or the fear of it. It 
can be bitter or sweet, even both in a breath: 
it can embrace or discard, and be gracious 
or ungracious. It is pleasant in itself, since 
it is the sign of relief or respite, though it 
may derisively plant a dagger in a breast

as well as share a joy. Its protean nature 
has been a source of misconceptions, for as 
' Proteus of old might be mistaken now for a 
timid deer and now for a raging boar, accord- 
ing to his momentary shape, so laughter has 
been misunderstood by partial perceptions 
of its many characters. Mr Greig rightly 
insists on the “relativity of laughter ” 2°”. 
In vindictive or cruel epochs vindictiveness 
or cruelty will tinge or dominate laughter. 
As civilization restrains animus or secures 
one man from another’s violence, laughter 
reflects its progress and stands more open to 
sympathy. As sympathy increases, laughter 
is more and more prompted by occasions in 
which sympathetic linkage is possible or 
remains unbroken and less and less prompted. 
by occasions involving misery or cruelty or 
misfortune. 
The adult tends to laugh differently from 
the child. A row of spectators at a tennis- 
match included adults and both young girls 
and boys. When an elderly lady tripped over 
the guy-rope that supported a net-pole and 
fell there was a sharp contrast between the» 
giggle that ran through the young folk and 
the seriousness of their elders. The difference 
depended on the absence or presence of a sense 
of the seriousness of a fall for an elderly lady.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
of laughter upon the milieu for obtaining its 
situation of relief. 
Laughter is your true catholic who mixes 
with all. Its catholicity has led to mis- 
understanding through its association with 
tickling. ‘‘ If you prick us, do we not bleed ? 
if you tickle us, do we not laugh ? if you poison 
us, do we not die ? and if you wrong us, shall 
we not revenge?’ Circumspect scrutiny 
avoids Shylock’s error—the assertion of as 
inevitable a connection between laughter and. 
tickling as between death and poison. For 
the act of laughing, which is not an act by 
but within the body, is different from the 
squirm of the tickle. The laugh, which 
collapses the laugher, cannot be the proper 
response to the tickle, which is always an 
act of riddance. 'The sneeze rids the nostrils 
of irritants; the cough does the like for the 
throat; and tickling ensures for both the 
occurrence of the appropriate act of riddance, 
Whether the squirm in the nursery tickle 
was impressed upon the male to ensure 
vigorous struggling in battle or upon the 
maiden to repel the advances of a too im- 
portunate lover or upon both to twitch off 
parasites, whether the tickled wriggle is a 
wrestle, a refusal of love?*, or a “ bug- 
shifter’ 2°, it is always an act of riddance 
and essentially different from the absence 
of endeavour in the laugh. ‘The tickle, in 
nursery tickling, simply offers an occasion

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
for laughter. The act of riddance is more 
violent than the situation demands. The 
tickle stimulates as though the tickler were 
hostile—it calls fiercely on the body for action. 
Since the occasion is friendly and not hostile, 
the fierce call on drops into a relative call off, 
telative because the child still shrinks from 
the tickling hand though his first impulse to 
resent real hostility quickly wanes, and a 
situation of relief provides laughter with its 
occasion. 
The sense of the ludicrous hints at its 
connection with laughter of sheer relief and 
with other laughters where the body is clearly 
involved by attaching itself to the same 
physical expression of laughing. It is the 
more purely mental analogue of the more 
purely physical situation of sheer relief. 
Drawing the distinction between mental and 
bodily more sharply than really warrants, 
for there is a mental element in the most 
purely bodily form of laughter as the body is 
never quite forgotten in the most purely 
ludicrous sense, the experience of the comic 
repeats in the mental sphere the experience 
of relief in sudden relaxations of bodily 
effort. A call on attention, or expectation 
—and attention usually contains an expectant 
element, called off into relief where it is 
momentarily freed from any other obligation 
than to relish the perception of the incongruity, 
is the occasion of the ludicrous. An incon- 
210

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
gruity is a contrast that administers a psy- 
chical shock and a ludicrous incongruity is 
lodged in a situation of relief. The parallel 
between the woman who laughed when she 
was plucked from the machine and the 
listener who laughed at the fall of the lake 
level when the angler pulled out his fish is 
clear and complete. The one was called upon 
for struggle, the other for understanding. 
In both the call was cut short and both 
were dropped into relief—the woman because 
danger was over and the angler’s auditor 
because narration had forfeited its claim on 
belief. The sheer relief of the one had its 
analogue in the amusement of the other. 
The analogy between laughter at the ludi- 
crous and laughter from sheer relief can admit 
a wide difference between the two laughters. 
Analogous situations may be very different 
variants of one fundamental plan or system 
of connections. As an oak grows from vital 
factors concentrated in an acorn, so civiliza- 
tions have grown from concentrations of 
resources in isolated peoples. The funda- 
mental factor—isolation—has been effected 
by different methods. ‘The sea has isolated 
and the desert has isolated. ‘‘ The bordering 
desert’, remarks Miss Newbigin in this 
connection, “‘ensured isolation, and, con- 
tinuing the island metaphor, we may say that 
it represented the sea. Its effect was to

throw the whole energy of the community 
towards the centre, for the periphery formed 
an area in which the characteristic mode of 
life could not be practised. Similarly, it 
gave protection, for it is unsuited to any 
save a highly specialized culture, which must 
have been of relatively late origin” *°°. Two 
peoples, one encircled by sea and the other 
by sand, are in different but analogous 
situations. But the variations of a funda- 
mental situation may be widely divergent. 
Response to environment is a fundamental 
telation of life. Animal forms present a 
bewildering multiplicity because the lower 
animals usually respond to their environment 
by changing their bodies. This “ direct 
structural response’”’ may have occurred in 
early human history “ when man reacted to 
the sum total of the conditions as an animal 
does’. Man’s present response, however, is 
communal and his “real response to the 
surface phenomena of the earth” is “the 
aptitudes which the members of a community 
display, the tools which they use, the kind of 
knowledge which they accumulate, their modes 
of organization, their type of material wealth, 
their traditions and ideals’? *. Animals re- 
spond to their environment by changing their 
bodies; men by changing their tools and 
their ideas. Both participate in the situation 
of responding to their environment, but 
civilization is very different from structural

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
changes in animal bodies. So the sense of the 
ludicrous is very different from sheer relief, 
though the fundamental plan or situation is 
identical in both, as response*to environment 
is the fundamental plan or situation under- 
lying variety of animal species on the one 
hand and the variety of civilizations on the 
other. 
Though the sense of the ludicrous may 
disguise its connection with obviously relieved 
laughters, like those of triumph or superiority, 
and prompt suspicion about its natural analogy 
with the laugh of sheer relief, it announces 
that connection and that analogy by one 
significant character. Every laugh is a 
‘momentary finality, and, as laughter of sheer 
relief ends effort, so the point of a joke isa 
terminus. Ridicule is rhetorically powerful 
because it uproariously makes further inquiry 
impossible: “Gorgias laid it: down rightly 
enough as a sound maxim to confound the 
seriousness of one’s adversary by  jocu- 
larity’’**. So with pure amusement: the 
book closes and the chapter ends. Sheer 
relief, triumph, scorn, greeting, and amuse- 
ment—all these laughs are momentary ter- 
mini, breaks in the flow, elated and suddenly 
precipitated respites. 
If the call changes so that there is no 
terminus, the laugh is spoiled : a sudden sense 
of danger will quickly dissipate amusement. 
Comic laughter, like all laughter, essentially 
213  
-P-A-G-E-220
    SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
announces and relishes a situation of relief : 
it is a momentary terminus. 
Amusement is peculiar to laughter because 
it is the appreciation of an incongruity lodged 
in the characteristic relief-situation of the 
laugh. It rises in connection with the laugh, 
tends to suffuse it, and constantly dominates 
it, because the break in relief 7s an incongruity 
whose perception and appreciation compose 
the comic sense. Amusement creeps into the 
laugh of triumph or scorn, and is immanent 
from the first in all human laughter, because 
the incongruous sides of every break into 
telief tend to engage the ,perception and 
appreciation of incongruity. \In purely comic 
laughter the situation is ‘purely mental 
(cutting mental and bodily more sharply 
asunder than in reality, for the sake of 
analysis) and amused laughter, sensitive like 
all laughters’ to emotions appropriate to 
relief from tension, by admitting sympathy 
with its relaxation from hostility, can become 
humour—the final achievement of the laugh|\ 
Amusement can allow animus to linger; it’ 
can even invite it by contemptuous indiffer- 
ence; but it tends to soften the asperity of 
ungracious laughter by emphasizing and en- 
livening the relaxation of relief. Amusement 
itself has no animus and tends to displace it, 
though the two may co-exist and the satirist 
may doubly spice his gibe with the ludicrous 
and the contemptuous. 
214

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
Laughter may obtain its relief from the 
sudden call off of a call on that is either 
momentary or persistent. Serious occasions 
claim sustained seriousness and, as dust- 
particles act as nuclei for the condensation of 
rain, trivial interruptions at a funeral often 
drop sustained mental tension into quick 
relief and indecorous laughter. In the nur- 
sery tickle the call on and the call off are both 
rapid. Release of tension is the thing, 
whether the tension has lasted an hour or 
asecond. Prolonged tension tends to search 
for laughter, or for the relief that it marks, 
and a moment of fierce emotion, as it trembles 
from vigour, is ready for respite. 
When Homer made the bandy-legged Ther- 
sites, lame-footed, his rounded shoulders 
arched over his chest and his head with its 
scanty sprouting stubble warped over them, 
a reviler who was hateful to Achilles and 
Odysseus **, he commemorated a traditional 
ascription of bitterness to the person with 
deformity or physical infirmity. So Richard, 
“not shap’d for sportive tricks’, brought 
“into this breathing world, scarce half made 
up” and halting past the barking dogs, 
resolved ‘‘ to prove a villain ’’ and be “ subtle, 
false, and treacherous’”’?, ‘This traditional 
connection between deformity and bitterness 
was established by the unsympathetic laughter 
aroused by the former. Physical infirmities 
easily excited ancient laughter. Plato was

  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
shocked when Homer describes how 
“Tnextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed 
gods, when aoe saw Hephestus bustling about the 
mansion” *, 
Hepheestus limped as he bustled and, nearer 
to our own day, Thackeray could say of Pope 
that “his contemporaries reviled these mis- 
fortunes with a strange acrimony and made 
his poor deformed person the butt for many 
a bolt of heavy wit’ ***. If the reviled turned 
teviler, who could blame him? If the 
deformed were legitimate objects of mirth, 
who could condemn their bitterness? The 
passing of the tradition that deformity is 
bitter marks an alteration to a sympathetic 
attitude towards the ill-shaped person. This 
change of attitude is reflected in the history 
of the laugh, for deformity is no longer a 
legitimate occasion of mirth. Here sympathy 
has checked the laugh: the expectancy of 
normal humanity is broken by the spectacle 
of infirmity, and laughter follows if derisive 
or contemptuous feelings permit relief; but 
the call to expect normality is more altered 
to a call for sympathy in the modern civilized 
mind than called off into the relief of laughter 
that may blend scorn with amusement. A 
relic of the flow of the comic sense at the sight 
of deformity is preserved in Bergson’s com- 
ment that a hunchback is comic because he 
suggests a man cultivating a rigid attitude,

-P-A-G-E-223
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
and in his comparison of the comic expression 
to ‘‘a unique and permanent grimace’ *’. 
It is, perhaps, suggestive that Aristotle, in 
his most frequently quoted passage on the 
tidiculous, chooses the mask as an instance 
of excitants of laughter ***: the mask clearly 
hints at the absurdity and also, perhaps, at 
the opportunity for derision, naturally sug- 
gested by physical infirmity. Traill*°* places 
the human tendency to laugh at deformity 
side by side with its suppression by sympathy 
when he reminds us of the part played in the 
fun of the fair by grinning through a horse- 
collar, and that Persius, the Roman satirist, 
condemned the man who could taunt another 
on the loss of an eye. 
Sympathy has restricted laughter by de- 
priving it of an occasion in deformity, and 
Groos affirms that both danger and sympathy 
prevent the enlivening effect of the comic *°. 
Another writer ** defines humour as “ a more 
subtle, delicately discriminating sense of in- 
congruity”’” and dubs the ‘‘ sympathetic 
feature in humour” as “‘ somewhat acci- 
dental’? : humour is the sense of the ludicrous 
at its height—super-amusement, and “‘ too 
much emphasis” must not be laid upon its 
sympathy. ‘The restrictions imposed upon 
laughter by sympathy account for these 
opinions, but do not justify their lack of 
insight. For sympathies permit laughter as 
well as refuse it. Aristotle knew we can be

  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
fond of persons ‘“‘ who have a certain amount 
of tact in giving and receiving badinage, as, 
whether they are good-humoured butts or 
graceful jesters, they have the same object 
in view as the opposite parties in the combat 
of wit, viz. mutual amusement’ *. The 
sympathies between members of a friendly 
circle can allow a jest or a witticism that 
would be cruel and ostracized for its cruelty 
if mutual good-feeling and fellowship did not 
“distance” the ridicule. Thus sympathy 
sometimes permits laughter as well as denies 
it, and it can suffuse the rich, genial laugh of 
humour. 
Groos thinks that a feeling of superiority 
livens up the comic, in contradistinction to 
sympathy which chills its liveliness. Mr 
Carritt apparently combines the ludicrous of 
triumph and incongruity: ‘‘ Hence the ele- 
ment of triumph over something hostile, noted 
in it by Plato and Hobbes, and the element 
of incongruity and incoherence noted 
by others”’**. Superiority and triumph, in 
all its varieties— noble or ignoble, battle- 
triumph or intellectual satisfaction over 
mental achievement—are not hinderers of 
the laugh. They are too appropriate to its 
fundamental situation of relief to restrict it 
as sympathy restricts it, and they have 
undoubtedly always haunted it. Their haunt- 
ing habit has been restricted by sympathy 
and also, as previously suggested, by the sheer

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
excluding force of the sense of the ludicrous 
which has more and more tended to enliven 
the laugh and to wean laughter from its 
dependence for gusto on the gratification 
either of success or of animus. A sense of 
the appropriateness of superiority or triumph 
to the general situation of laughter has been 
partly responsible for a clinging by theorists 
to ungracious estimates of the nature of 
laughter. The frequent animus in the laugh 
has tightened their hold on this estimate. 
The possibility of construing purely comic 
jokes—jokes made and taken in only a ludi- 
crous spirit—into indulgence of animus has 
prevented this tightened hold from relaxing. 
The theorists who appeal to Hobbes or for 
whom he is spokesman have perceived the 
truth partially. Gratified animus is emo- 
tionally congruent with the relief of the laugh- 
able situation—so congruent that it persist- 
ently haunts it. The humanization of 
laughter, perceptible in its history, intimates 
plainly that gratified animus is not essential 
to its occurrence. If superiority is con- 
trasted with gratified animus as self-satis- 
faction with hostile attention to a fellow, 
neither is it essential. Laughter has many 
varieties—perhaps even including the laugh 
of “mental vacuity ’’*4. Accepting for ex- 
pository convenience the clean Cartesian cut 
between mind and body, ‘‘ the laugh of the 
soul and the laugh of the body are distinct. 
219
-P-A-G-E-226
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
We may have each without the other. And 
only a gross and superficial analysis will 
confound them” **. Many different feelings 
may rendez-vous about the laugh. They are 
often ungracious, and purely comic laughter 
may be dispassionately free from either animus 
or sympathy, but Pater rightly identified 
humour, certainly the highest humour, with 
“the laughter which blends with tears, and 
even with the subtleties of the imagination, 
and which, in its most exquisite motives, is 
one with pity... .”*. Dan Leno graphic- 
ally described an explosion in his home. 
“Tt was the only time”, he added, “ that 
father and mother went out together”’. 
This joke has no cutting edge, and has been 
tightly described as humorous in its sym- 
pathetic presentation of the ludicrous, though 
an unsympathetic critic of marital relations 
might relish it as a gibe. 
Laughter has steadily replaced triumph by 
amusement, though it has not banished it, 
and it has opened to sympathy, though it 
has not completely expelled animus. It has 
also genialized triumph and attracted grati- 
fication at success that has discarded hostility. 
The quiet laugh that greets the decisiveness 
of wit is the laugh of triumph without its 
animus. It has not necessarily developed out 
of the latter, for many laughters may spring 
from the central situation of relief, as many 
rays of light diverge from a luminous point. 
220
-P-A-G-E-227
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
The sedater form of pleasurable emotion 
assigned by Traill"’ to wit as its natural 
response and evoked by a double sense of 
fitness and human ingenuity is, so far as it 
employs the laugh, a laughter of achievement 
that may correspond to the laugh of battle- 
triumph without being its lineal descendant. 
The two laughters may be analogues: the 
triumphant laugh having the same relation 
to a decisive sword-stroke as the ‘sedate 
emotion ’’ has to witty and decisive exposure 
of truth. Nor need the sense of humour have 
had, as Traill affrms—following a tradition— 
an anti-pathetic origin ***. If the sense of the 
ludicrous, as ‘Traill’s sense of ‘‘ humour” 
must be rechristened under present termin- 
ology, originated in a perception of incon- 
gruity and was nourished by relishing it, it 
sprang, like triumph, from a situation of 
relief but had its own private route of develop- 
ment. The laughters are more like children 
of relief, each separately born, than like a 
straight step-by-step series in which each 
member is a modification of the one before it. 
As the laugh varies with its originating 
relief so it may vary with the purpose of the 
witticism. The triumphant laugh of aggressive 
or satirical wit has an echo of war, and scorn 
or contempt or superiority may tinge laughter 
according to the relief precipitated. The 
laughter of wit sometimes quietly appreciates 
an achievement of insight and expression ; 
221 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
sometimes it has the relish of the stirred sense 
of the ludicrous. The quality of the relief 
promotes a corresponding quality in the laugh 
and the witticism, because it varies the 
situation of relief, varies the gusto of laughter. 
Wit attracts the phrase “ laughter of wit” 
because it so often and so competently 
provides the laughters with occasions. Its 
decisiveness elicits their fundamental situ- 
ation of relief and it constantly involves 
those displays of incongruity that stir the 
sense of the ludicrous. The alliance between 
wit and laughter, frequent though not con- 
stant, is a reminder of the ubiquity of the 
laugh. It is ubiquitous because sudden inter- 
ruptions of unrequired effort constantly recur. 
They recur because quirks and stoppages are 
ever interjecting into the flow of human life. 
The sense of the ludicrous is invasive of the 
laugh because incongruities stir it, and per- 
vasive simply because this is a changing 
universe. For ‘incongruity’’, as Mr San- 
tayana remarks, “is a consequence of 
change ’’, and “existence involves changes 
and happenings and is comic inherently, 
like a pun that begins with one meaning 
and ends with another ” *°. 
“Tn youth’, adds Mr Santayana, “ any- 
thing is pleasant to see or do, so long as it is 
spontaneous, and if the conjunction of these 
things is ridiculous, so much the better: to

-P-A-G-E-229
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
be ridiculous is part of the fun’. Such 
addition to hilarity, in which amusement 
adds to the fun, bespeaks the function of the 
comic. Laughter is the elater of relief and, 
as the more patently physical laughters 
enliven respites from physical action, so the 
ludicrous sense enlivens respites from compre- 
hension. ‘There has been diligent search for 
the function of the laugh. It has been too 
narrowed simultaneously into an expression 
exclusively of amusement and a saviour from 
unnecessary sympathy. It has been too 
undiscriminatingly assigned a “strong sur- 
vival value’’: there are other incentives 
than the extraction of laughing satisfaction 
to quick perceptions of significant distinc- 
tions, and it is doubtful whether the incon- 
gruities that excite laughter ever assisted a 
human being directly in the battle of life 2°. 
Laughter may have more indirectly con- 
tributed to survival by its periodical enliven- 
ments of heart and soul. For this enlivenment 
seems to be its essential and primary function 
and it is too intimately blended with the sense 
of the ludicrous for this essential and primary 
function to require further search. ‘There may 
be a spread of function from this primary 
tole of enlivenment, as the qualities of laughter 
spread from its primary quality of relief. The 
laughing relish of absurdities in conduct reacts 
in the social discipline of ridicule upon the 
perpetrators of the absurdities. The elation

  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
of kindly laughter spreads as a sympathetic 
bond. Laughter varies its function as it 
varies its nature and it can divide by bitter- 
ness as it can join by sympathy. It does all 
these things—dealing out discipline, sowing 
discord, and genially uniting. But its central, 
fundamental role, from which other effects 
secondarily spring, is the enlivenment of 
those breaks or momentary termini that 
constantly recur in human activity and supply 
laughter with its generative respite. 
Though the esthetic status of laughter, 
comic laughter, is as difficult to define as 
its position among the instincts, it can take 
its recompense of amusement from the con- 
tradictions and bafflements of life as the poet 
or artist can take his contemplative recom- 
pense from the urgency of existence. ‘‘ What 
shadows we are, and what shadows we 
pursue’ !—thus the dying Walpole, by ex- 
pressing his sense of the vanity of life, took 
his esthetic recompense from evanescence. 
So Burns took his in :— 
“But pleasures are like poppies spread, 
You seize the flower, its bloom is shed ; 
Or, like the snow-fall in the river, 
A moment white, then melts for ever.” 
The comic spirit may suffuse cynicism or 
bitterness with the enlivenment of amuse- 
ment, or, on the level of humour, it may laugh 
224

  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
over the contradictions of life with a quick- 
ened sense of sympathy. ‘The course of true 
love is not the only course of life that does 
not run smoothly, and humorous laughter 
can extract a recompense from frequent 
breaks between human actualities and ideals 
without either quenching humanity or un- 
nerving endeavour. . . . “ Hence the best of 
all jokes is the sympathetic contemplation 
of things by the understanding from the 
philosopher’s point of view. There is no joke 
so true and deep in actual life as when some 
pure idealist goes up and down among the 
institutions of society, attended by a man who 
knows the world, and who, sympathizing 
with the philosopher’s scrutiny, sympathizes 
also with the confusion and indignation of 
the detected skulking institutions. His per- 
ception of disparity, his eye wandering 
perpetually from the rule to the crooked, 
lying, thieving fact, makes the eyes run over 
with laughter ”’ **. 
But life is not all comedy and, though 
“men of reason’’ may have been unreason- 
ably denied the spirit of joking by Emerson **, 
they do not permanently regard it as comedy. 
Fuller included “jesting” in the “ Holy 
State” but only when it was not “a master- 
quality’ and “attended on other perfec- 
tions” #*, The continuous insistence on life 
as a comic pageant tends to a combination 
of Olympian aloofness with quiet contempt.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
Aristotle approved “the perfect mean of 
virtue’ between the buffoon who “is the 
slave of his own merriment’ and “ cannot 
refrain from deriding either himself or others ”’ 
and the morose, sour person who does not joke 
and is irritated with those who do. “ Perfect 
humour”, he adds, should include both 
cleverness and tact, and thus befit “a con- 
siderate and right-minded gentleman”. The 
lighter innuendo of the New Comedy was more 
decorous, he continues, than the scurrility 
and obscenity of the Old. He thus notes a 
humanization of the laugh and urges its 
tefinement. But he significantly remarks that 
“the joke is of the nature of a taunt” =, 
When, as his description of comedy as “an 
imitation of men worse than the average” 
with respect to one particular fault, the 
ridiculous ***, may be roughly taken to indi- 
cate, he contrasted the upward look in 
tragedy with the downward look in comedy, 
he originated a very persistent tradition. 
“Do you know’”’, writes Oliver Wendell 
Holmes—amildly retaining an estimate that has 
often been more pungently expressed—“ that 
you feel a little superior to every man who 
makes you laugh, whether by making faces 
or verses? Are you aware that you have 
a pleasant sense of patronizing him . . .” *. 
The comic perspective of life is always quick 
with this patronizing tendency which can 
226
-P-A-G-E-233
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
have a rapid descent into contempt and 
flavour laughter with cynicism. Life is 
tragic or comic according to the perspective. 
“Nothing can be funnier”, remarks Mr G. 
K. Chesterton, “‘ properly considered, than 
the fact that one’s own father is a pigmy if 
he stands far enough off. Perspective really 
is the comic element in things’’**. Our 
mental perspective does determine whether we 
shall laugh over folly or failure, or whether 
we shall cajole or weep or speak in daggers: 
“all falsehoods, all vices, seen at sufficient 
distance, seen from the point where our moral 
sympathies do not interfere, become ludi- 
crous”’*7, Idle laughter, or laughter that 
loosens a humane grip on life, is always 
prepared for the vision that persistently looks 
upon the human drama as a comedy. 
But the comic perspective, when discreetly 
indulged, has its boon and its balm. “If 
the essence of the comic ’’, continues Emerson, 
“be the contrast between the idea and the 
false performance ’’—and this contains at least 
enough of the truth to be significant—‘“ there 
is good reason why we should be affected by 
the exposure. We have no deeper interest 
than our integrity, and that we should be 
made aware, by joke and by stroke, of any 
lie we entertain ’’**7. One great lesson of 
life is to learn to do without. “‘ The presence 
of the ideal of right and of truth in all action 
227
-P-A-G-E-234
  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
makes the yawning delinquencies of practice 
remorseful to the conscience, tragic to the 
interest, but droll to the intellect ’’*7. The 
spirit of comedy snatches a laughing enliven- 
ment from failure, derives a cheerful gusto 
from the spectacle of human fussiness in a 
little corner of the universe, and, when it 
does not lose its background of essential 
seriousness, pleasantly converts the frustration 
of our ideals into genial mirth.

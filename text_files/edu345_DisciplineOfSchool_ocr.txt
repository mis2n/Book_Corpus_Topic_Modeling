  AUTHOR’S FOREWORD 
Tr was not the daring of my own spirit which first conceived 
the idea of practically denying an old pedagogic maxim which 
says that, given lessons well taught, the order of a school 
will take care of itself. Neither was I the first to gainsay 
the truth of the cheerful superstition that no specific help 
upon questions of discipline may be given a teacher; that 
each situation, as it presents itself, must be met in the light 
of-certain general principles which are doubtless very sound, 
but which do not always readily come to mind in the nick 
of time. Nevertheless these new doctrines met a ready 
response from one to whom experience and observation have 
combined to show that the management of behavior is in 
itself a definite phase of school work, and a definite problem 
to be solved; and that fairly concrete means of achieving 
good results may be passed from one teacher to another, as 
truly as a concrete manner of teaching a geography lesson 
may be taught one teacher by another. 
The first chapters of this book deal with the general as-\\/) ‘ 
‘ pects of the situation, and with the theory of discipline. The } 
\ latter chapters take up the concrete problems of school life / 
and offer suggestions for their solution. A constant effort. 
has been made to keep the subject matter practical, suggest- 
ive, helpful. At the same time, there has been no attempt 
to evade the necessity for real thought, for thorough analysis, 
and for that grasp of the big plan without which no teacher 
can really succeed as a disciplinarian. An illuminating con- 
ception of the social organization not only of the school, but 
of the world, underlies the new discipline, which errs neither 
on the side of that soft pedagogy which ignores social obliga-

  tion, nor with the older blind severity which denied social 
advantages. It is inexorable, sure of its authority, and sternly 
firm; but it recognizes the right of self-government which 
comes as the reward of trustworthiness, and the joy that 
comes from happy codperation. It is this conception of the 
nature of school management and discipline, applied to cases 
which most teachers know by heart, which forms the subject 
of this book. 
So many people have helped in the making of the book, 
that it is quite impossible to make adequate acknowledg- 
ment of my debts to them. But I wish especially to thank 
Dr. L. D. Coffman, at whose suggestion the work was under- 
taken, for helpful criticism and encouragement. A number 
of people have given time and thought to the answering of 
questions bearing upon their experience and knowledge of 
school affairs, notably Miss Sallie H. Webb of Cincinnati, 
the late William J. Morrison of Brooklyn, and Miss Kate 
Smith of Los Angeles. To Miss Charlotte Reichmann I am 
especially indebted for hearty and helpful codperation in 
translating German treatises and in criticizing and proof- 
reading. Several of my colleagues in the Training School of 
the Illinois State Normal University, notably Miss Lora 
Dexheimer and Mr. Edwin A. Turner, have given me helpful 
suggestions. Two of the chapters have appeared in The 
American Schoolmaster. To others I have given due credit 
in the body of the text.

INTRODUCTION 
"crac most important cause of teacher mortality is 
weakness in discipline. It is responsible for approxi- 
mately twenty out of every one hundred failures. Al- 
though this fact has. been recognized for many years 
there has not heretofore been any attempt to formulate 
the principles underlying this important phase of a 
teacher’s work. ‘Tradition and the exigencies of the 
situation have furnished teachers their criteria for dis- 
posing of disciplinary cases. The unsupervised appli- 
cation of such criteria has ofttimes been the only way 
by which young teachers could discover their futility. 
Although much of our progress in teaching has been 
made by “cut and try” methods they are, neverthe- 
less, the most expensive methods that teachers can 
employ. Certainly nothing will pay larger dividends in 
the field of school economy than an interpretation of the 
experiences of successful teachers relating to discipline. 
' There are no changes in the field of education more 
( striking than those that have been occurring in the 
field of school discipline. At one time there was an 
effort to adjust disciplinary affairs mathematically; 
| the offender was punished to the extent that he had 
| caused suffering; an equation was struck between the 
| guilt and the suffering, and thus an indemnity was 
\secured for past conduct. An exact agreement be-

  xiv INTRODUCTION 
tween the punishment and the offense is not always 
obvious, nor can it always be established. Moreover, 
the view point of this primitive notion of punishment 
is wrong, for it stresses the crime or offense but over- 
looks the character of the offender; the attention of 
the one inflicting the punishment is turned to the past, 
never to the future. 
Somewhat later human ingenuity was exercised to 
its utmost in devising forms of punishment for in- 
timidating and deterring others; but penalty as a 
deterrent, in the opinion of the criminologist and 
penologist of this and other countries and in the opinion 
of wise teachers, has not succeeded in making good 
its claim. It is not the laws upon the statute books, 
the rules of the school, or the occasioned visitation of 
harsh punishment, but the certainty of punishment that 
deters others from violating the law. 
Punishment as a deterrent has been, and no doubt 
still is, resorted to in some schools. For evidence one 
only needs to refer to the historic dunce-cap, to making 
children toe a mark, requiring them to stand upon 
some unstable elevation, to sit with a pencil or stick 
beneath their tongues for whispering, or to the public 
administering of corporal punishment. Fortunately all 
sane educators are unanimously desirous of getting rid 
_of these inane practices. 
There are, however, certain evidences of the in- 
quisitional age that have shown signs of persisting. 
Worse perhaps than public disgrace, ‘‘saturation,” and 
tasks, all of which are medieval in origin, is the pub- 
lic use of vituperation. Such opprobrious epithets as 
“loafer” “numskull,” “fool,” and the like, are more 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION’ xv 
than inelegant; they are calculated to antagonize the 
child or to break his self-respect. . 
The chief weakness of the doctrine of repression was — 
that it wholly disregarded the worth of the individual. 
Repression of dangerous and instinctive evil tendencies, 
inherited from the race, will always be necessary for 
the fruition of a beautiful character, but repression as a 
means of public disgrace will seldom produce positive 
qualities of character or be successful in preventing 
others from committing similar offenses. 
The inadequacy and barbarity of these earlier 
methods began to dawn upon sensible people and atten- 
tion was centered more and more upon the individual. | 
It was recognized that the guilty are not all irredeem-~ 
able, that reformation, except in extreme cases, is far 
better than incapacitation. The rehabilitation of the 
individual became the goal of action. 
Naturally it was but a step from this to the notion 
that the way to prevent trouble is to stop the operation 
of those causes which permit the origination of the 
impulse, its gratification, and its spread by contagion 
of sympathy. This point of view has been responsible 
partly for the liberalizing of the course of study, the 
improving of methods of instruction, and the enrich- 
ment of the school libraries. Perhaps the recognition 
of the value and necessity of promoting and supervising 
the numerous activities that children more or less 
spontaneously engage in, was the most important 
outcome of this point of view. The clubs, parties, 
entertainments, and games of young people, even when 
not subject to supervision, are powerful disciplinary 
agencies. For a child to be chosen or not to be chosen,  
-P-A-G-E-16
    xvi INTRODUCTION 
to be invited or not to be invited, to act as a leader or 
as a follower, teaches him to respect authority. But 
when under the guidance of a wise teacher, the social 
activities are made to conform to established usage, 
the individual engaging in them, learns not only to 
respect authority but to appreciate certain important 
refinements of justice. Those teachers who are the 
successful leaders of their pupils and their communities, 
consider it a part of their legitimate function to see 
that the social activities of both are kept upon a high 
plane and are distinctively educative in character. 
‘— Perhaps the best preventive measures in a school 
are good organization and excellent instruction. Much 
of the organization of a school may be attended to 
before the school actually opens. All the more or 
less mechanical and routine matters, such as the 
program, the seating of the pupils, the monitorial 
system, the plan of government, and the like, if prop- 
erly provided for before the opening day, will serve 
from the outset as powerful hindrances to questionable 
conduct. By the “plan of government” I do not 
have reference to the making of rules. Whenever 
rules are made uniformity of discipline becomes a 
principle of the school. This is not always desirable. 
To have a fixed and definite punishment for all offend- 
ers or for all of a kind, will eventually compromise the 
disciplinarian. There must be moderation in some 
cases and constraint in others. 
Lucidity of instruction, perhaps the greatest pre- 
ventive agency of bad conduct, depends upon the 
personal qualities of the teacher, his tact, sympathy, 
disposition, knowledge, and command of the tech-
-P-A-G-E-17
INTRODUCTION xvii 
nique of teaching. The amelioration of discipline is 
due not only to better teaching but to better build- 
ings, better libraries, and better school equipment. 
The relation of these factors to the problem under 
consideration is so remote or indirect or obvious as to 
make an analytical treatment of them unnecessary. 
Any discussion of discipline and its attendant con- 
sequences would be inadequate if it did not involve 
a treatment of that hoary but nevertheless unsolved 
problem of the relation of authority to obedience, for 
it must be admitted that both are traditionally sanc- 
tioned and indisputably unnecessary in the govern- 
ment of any school. At times the school has attempted 
to imitate some form of municipal or state government, 
but there are few successful attempts of record, except 
where some powerful personality has been back of 
them. At other times the school has attempted to 
imitate an ideal home where every phase of conduct 
is controlled though the manifestations of affection, 
but obviously such a basis of control is not equally 
applicable to all grades of the school. The school is 
not society, nor can it exactly duplicate any institu- 
tion of society. It is a society and as such has its 
own strengths and limitations for doing certain kinds 
of work. Its work depends to some extent upon obe- 
dience to authority. Authority, wisely used, inspires 
confidence in the child and cultivates that feeling of 
respect which should dominate all well-ordered schools. 
r~ Obedience does not destroy independence. It lays “ 
jthe only true foundation for independence. Certainly 
one of the rights of every child is to have the benefit 
f the will of his elders concerning things about which 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  xviii '* INTRODUCTION 
he has no will. There is no justification in psychology 
for the theory that children should be allowed to 
follow unrestrictedly their impulses and instinctive 
tendencies and that, if left alone, they will grow up 
into intelligent, civilized, moral beings. There can 
be no freedom in any institution except by obedience 
to those conditions or laws that are necessary for the 
perpetuity of the institution. The only natural rights 
» any one has are the ones he uses for collective welfare. 
Freedom in adulthood calls for the exercise of a certain 
| amount of authority in childhood. The great work of 
| civilization and of education has been that of over- 
| laying certain primitive tendencies so that all might 
Te satisfactorily satisfy the conditions necessary for 
good citizenship, for neighborhood and family life. 
Mere spontaneous activity never in itself produced 
reflective thinking. It is simply overflow, undiffer- 
entiated and disorganized. Unless something arises 
to disturb and check the flow of events, to make 
us conscious of some maladjustment, to intensify the 
sensation of strain between what we are and are not 
but ought to be, no thinking is done. The person who 
is the victim of a thousand and one chance stimula- 
tions of his environment is characterless; but the 
person who has learned to choose his stimuli or his 
responses as the result of wise teaching has acquired 
the fundamentals of character. 
As efficiency in language is not measured by the 
number of mistakes one makes, but by the correctness 
of his speech, so the test of efficiency in school dis- 
cipline is not the number of offenses committed but 
the freedom from offenses.

  THE 
DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
CHAPTER I 
THE PLACE AND WORK OF THE SCHOOL IN 
MODERN LIFE 
ScHOOLS are so important and universal a factor in 
modern life that few people think of trying to justify 
or explain them. Nevertheless, at a time when the 
most universal-and time-honored institutions are called 
upon by thoughtful people to give a reason for the 
faith that men have in them, even the school may be 
put in question. For the reliable intuition of society 
at large, it is enough that the experience of centuries 
has established the school as one of the taken-for- 
granted adjuncts of civilization; but for the pragmatist 
whose questionings are a saving antidote to the inertia 
of conservatism, there must be a provable justification 
for even this well-established institution. That the 
school has such a justification in its function and its 
service must be conceded by practically all people, 
including those who differ most as to just what that 
function and service should be. 
There are three social institutions which take it upon 
themselves consciously to train children for their work 
in the world. They are the home, the church, the 
school. At different times in the world’s history each 
¢

The two 
functions of 
the school 
  2 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
has borne the greater burden of responsibility; at present 
the school has been rather reluctantly forced to under- 
take duties either voluntarily given up, or taken by force 
of circumstance from the other two. In general, the 
school recognizes two great duties devolving upon it: to 
prepare children for living, by making them intelligent 
sharers in the life of their time; and to prepare them for 
the task of adding something to the sum of human 
welfare. The first function has for its aim to help the 
child catch up with the race; the second, to aid the 
race in its efforts at progress. The school, then, stands 
with the home and the church as a great unifying force, 
reconciling the individuals in its care to their environ- 
ment, and then stimulating them to realize in that 
environment their individual ideals. 
But the school was never intended by men to usurp 
the whole responsibility of the training of the rising 
generation; nor should it, though never so urgently 
stimulated by the need of the day, try to attend to 
The Whole Duty of Man. There is a set of duties 
which belongs inherently to it, because it can perform 
these better, more economically, and more skillfully, 
than can the home or the church. There are other 
duties which it should leave to the institutions whose 
proper care they are. Religious training, for instance, 
is as important as any part of a child’s education; and 
yet it is manifestly impossible for the public schools of 
a country in which all shades and varieties of religious 
belief find adherents and protection, to give specific in- . 
struction in that subject. At a time when the advo- 
cates of a hundred additions to our already crowded 
courses are urging that the curriculums be extended to
-P-A-G-E-21
THE SCHOOL IN MODERN LIFE ; 
include new studies growing from new aims and func- 
tions, it is very necessary that practical people keep 
in mind the natural limitations of the school’s duties. 
Incidentally, no school worthy the support of society 
can fail to contribute to the ethical, religious, economic 
and aesthetic education of its pupils; but directly, 
its duty is plainly within a wide but not unlimited sphere \ 
of intellectual and social training. 
The child starts— even the most favored child, 
with every advantage of inheritance and environ- 
ment — exactly where the child of the Stone Age 
started. He is as helpless, as ignorant, and as pliable 
as the baby in a Paleolithic cave. But when he 
becomes a man, there will be required of him, if he 
is to take his place in the world of his day, a variety 
and scope of information, of skill, and of trained 
ability of which the cave-man could have no con- 
ception. His childhood, however, has not been length- 
ened in proportion to the greater preparation for 
maturity necessary for him. Obviously, he must have 
help in accomplishing so great a task. He is to learn, 
by the time he is grown and ready to do a man’s part, 
a sufficiently large proportion of all that men have 
learned since time began, to enable him to understand 
the life of his own day and to enter into it intelli- 
gently. Much of this learning he acquires uncon- 
sciously, absorbing incidentally from his environ- 
ment and his companions; but a great body of the 
required training is such that only organized, well- 
planned, and directed instruction can impart. Some 
standard of preparation, some body of information 
upon which men agree as most necessary for the

children of any given age, must be adopted. Curricu- 
lums are not thoughtlessly or arbitrarily fixed by chance 
authorities. Despite the representations of some 
would-be reformers engaged chiefly in tearing down 
what has been accomplished, it is true that no chance 
pedagogical despot ever laid down courses of study 
for the torture of future generations. Accepted 
subjects are those which an instinctive feeling for 
what children need for their work makes traditional. 
They have the inertia of all accepted things, however; 
they follow after the real needs of their era oftener 
than they anticipate them. But, with the new thought- 
fulness and conscientiousness which is taking the 
place of tradition in education, we are approximating 
the ideal of the first great function of the school: we 
are preparing the child to take his place in his age. 
We are succeeding fairly well in putting him in posses- 
sion of the great typical experiences of the race. The 
first function of the school then is to furnish a short- 
cut to the net result of the world’s long, hard road to 
knowledge. It is to give him an epitome of the pro- 
gressive experience of the race. 
The second function of the school is to make its 
pupils socially serviceable. Since there are other 
institutions which properly assume part of the re- 
sponsibility, the school may specialize here, undertak- 
ing the more intellectual side of the required training, 
while the home and the church work especially with 
the more personal of the social relationships, religion, 
and the finer points of culture. A hard and fast 
limitation to the work of any one institution is no 
more possible than the division of the child’s identity 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
THE SCHOOL IN MODERN LIFE 5 
into separate bundles of faculties or characteristics. 
But, in general, it may be said that society at large, 
‘ which authorizes and furnishes the school as an econom- 
ical way of paying part of its debt to the oncoming 
generation, expects the school to fit children for social 
efficiency by 
1. Furnishing them the information that will enable 
them to interpret the world about them. 
2. Teaching them a set of skills which they will 
need in social intercourse — such as reading, 
writing, etc. . 
3. Training in appreciation. 
4. Fitting them for social service by familiarizing 
them with socially serviceable methods of work, 
and by building up those prejudices, attitudes, 
and ideals that give the proper bias for such 
service. 
To these, popular ee lately added a fifth: 
Teaching them a set of skills which will give 
them economic independence. 
The school has been established and is supported 
by society especially for the foregoing purposes, and 
is justified because it has at least partially fulfilled 
them. It seems to be entering upon a period of much 
more efficient helpfulness than it has ever given, but 
its enlarged usefulness lies in a fuller realization of its 
purposes, rather than in an extension of these purposes. 
It can never take the place of other institutions, and 
no permanent good is to be realized from shifting to 
the school, at a time when it is straining every nerve 
to satisfy the legitimate demands of society, the real 
work of home, church, or government.

It is necessary for our study of the place and part 
of the school in modern life, to consider beside its 
place and function, its relations to the other con- 
trolling influences in the child’s environment. It 
should form part of an articulated and harmonious 
unity of constructive forces, which combine to furnish 
the necessary varied and correlated stimuli to whole- 
some and all-round development. In the nature of 
things it is obvious that the school bears a more or 
less fixed and definite relation to the state, to the 
parents of the children it trains, to the children them- 
selves, and to several social institutions, notably the 
home and the church and those modern would-be 
substitutes for both home and church which have to 
some extent taken over their work and responsibilities. 
An inquiry into the nature of these relations is perti- 
nent to our subject, for only by understanding with 
some degree of exactness just where it stands as a 
force in the world, can we gauge the nature and extent 
of the school’s authority —the point upon which 
depends the whole question of school discipline. 
The state is an economical device by which men 
unite to effect certain desirable ends which no one 
man could secure for himself. It is first protective 
and afterward advantage-seeking. As an organiza- 
tion seeking the advantage of its members, it has 
taken over the business of formal education from the 
home, which yields its claim to control readily because 
the state can do the work more effectively and more 
economically. The state has created a special de- 
partment, with its own revenues, equipment, and 
officers, to attend to this work; and we call this depart-
-P-A-G-E-25

ment of the state the School System. Properly speak- 
ing, the public school is not a separate institution, 
as is the church in the United States. It is a part of 
the state, maintained, as are laws, courts, postoffices, 
for the protection and service of the people. 
Mt is imperfect and faulty in its organization and 
requirements, as are the laws; but such as it is, it 
represents the will of the society which has created it, 
and demands the support of all citizens. It is con- 
trolled in our country by the various state govern- 
ments, or the lesser units to which they delegate 
this function — to towns, cities, counties and school 
districts. The teachers, principals, and superinten- 
dents are rarely officers in a technical sense, being 
employed under contract instead of being elected. 
They are obliged to serve, as all officers do, subject 
to laws and regulations, and also to enforce all laws 
_ and regulations that pertain to their work and positions. 
Their relation to their schools is a legal one, and the 
schools themselves are legally controlled.? The status 
of the school as a part of the state will often be referred 
to in these pages, as its right to the authority it claims 
is based upon this relation. 
The school does not derive its authority from the 
parents of the children who attend, as the popular 
phrase in loco parentis has led many to suppose, but 
from the whole body of organized society. There- 
fore the parents of children have no inherent right what- 
ever to dictate to the school what its methods shall

be. Teachérs are responsible, not to the parents of 
their pupils, but directly to the state, which is society’s 
representative power. Since the state has, in estab- 
lishing the school and assigning to it certain duties, 
taken from parents the responsibility of furnishing 
their children the training which the school offers, 
the state assumes also the dictation of means and 
methods. The only way in which a parent can logi- 
cally change school policies is to act through the state. 
Practically, of course, a hundred considerations of 
interest, of expedition, of friendly codperation and 
community of ends, operate to bridge this red-tape 
gulf of the state that lies between teachers and parents. 
For although as an element in the whole fabric of 
social organization, the state stands between parent 
and school, as an element in the training of citizens 
the school stands between parent and state, an in- 
stitution for protection and development, combining 
the motives of love and justice. But in case of appeal 
to ultimate authority, and as a basis for formulating 
school policies, every teacher should remember that 
authority is of the state, and that the policies used in 
schools are not subject to parental veto or parental 
control. The logical recourse of a parent who objects 
to the manner in which the school furnishes his child 
with the training that the state requires, is to remove 
1 This principle is commonly recognized in any case of disagree- 
ment where the matter at issue is referred to the local school board 
for adjustment, The result is often so unjust in its operation as 
to afford the best possible argument for the substitution of a larger 
political unit in the management of school affairs. Political or 
family influence has had a notoriously demoralizing influence in 
the local management of school matters in the United States.
-P-A-G-E-27

him from school and furnish that training from his 
private means. But the relations of parent and child, 
and teacher and pupil, have so much in common that 
a meeting-ground of friendly codperation is rarely 
hard to find. The opinionated parent is not half the 
obstacle, in fact, that the indifferent parent is, al- 
though the opinionated parent is usually harder to 
reform. Most teachers agree that the securing of 
parental codperation is one of the most difficult of their 
problems. Parents’ Clubs and Mothers’ Clubs enable 
the teacher to secure reénforcement at home for his 
efforts at school, and to reénforce at school what may 
be attempted at home. An idealist from Mars, be- 
coming acquainted with our social institutions, might 
suppose that the parents of a given community, upon 
surrendering their children to a public institution for 
that training which Nature and society originally 
required of them,' would voluntarily organize a super- 
visory and codperative association, with a view to 
keeping tab on all the methods used and all the results 
obtained. He would be surprised to learn that such 
organizations spring, not from the efforts of parents 
but from the efforts of teachers, and that parents must 
usually be begged, cajoled, and preached at to make 
them attend. It is among teachers as a body, 
rather than among parents, ‘that there exists a

Agency. The author says that the family is a developed institution 
and that society from the first took the initiative in training children.

of the human race have never developed to the point considered 
typical by the writers of the past. The theory is interesting and 
not unsupported by evidence.

compelling sense of responsibility toward the next 
generation. 
The school must take the initiative, then, in estab- 
lishing the close bond that should exist between it and 
the parents of its pupils. It will find a fairly ready 
response wherever great wealth or great poverty do 
not dull the sense of parental responsibility or prevent 
its exercise. The end for which both are working 
should be kept constantly in evidence, not only because 
it furnishes the basis for codperation, but because 
parents so seldom realize its full significance, and need 
to have their own part of the child’s training con- 
sciously squared to it. 
The school exercises a benevolent despotism toward 
its pupils. Each child is placed in it to perform its 
bidding implicitly, though not unquestioningly. It is 
a world in itself, which articulates with several other 
worlds in which he moves and to which he belongs, 
and it is subject to a great power called the state, which 
represents the power and will of the greatest world 
of all, which is society. This world of the school is 
organized by society for the benefit of children, that 
they may be able to benefit society in turn, and be 
themselves the happier for what they learn there. 
The teachers are in the school for the purpose of 
helping them to become intelligent, happy, helpful. 
All that makes boys and girls intelligent, happy, and 
helpful in the school is right, and therefore permissible. 
<~When children act in a way that defeats the purpose 
of the school, and so harm themselves, the teacher, 
who represents the state, which represents society, 
must correct them, and keep them from repeating the

offense. He has a perfect right to do so, because no 
one person can be permitted to clog the wheels of 
progress, to defeat the good purposes of society. — 
So soon as children can be trusted to carry on their 
part of society’s great work without being watched and 
without fail, they have reached the responsible estate 
of grown people and can govern themselves. Part of 
the school’s work is to help them to reach this stage 
as soon as possible. 
It were beside the point and superfluous to try to 
make clear the relations of morality to religion. We 
live in a land whose dominant religion offers no teach- 
ing that conflicts with the finest ethical code yet 
devised; indeed, the highest word we have to say of 
such a code is that it is one of practical Christianity. 
The schools are for obvious reasons not to teach reli- 
gion; but they are just as obviously bound to incul- 
cate, directly and indirectly, the principles of morality. 
The relation of the school to the church, in all its vari- 
ous branches and divisions, is an absolutely unofficial 
one, and can never, while American principles are 
recognized and supported, be otherwise. No teacher 
who uses his influences for or against any denomination 
or cult, has a defensible place in the American school 
system. But it is the place of the school to rationalize 
moral instruction, as it is the office of the church to 
give to moral instruction the motive force of high 
emotional appeal. Morality appears reasonable and 
profitable to the child who has been rightly instructed 
at school; it is, for the child who has had the right 
kind of religious instruction, an obligation enforced 
by the deepest feelings of reverence, gratitude, and

love. The school’s duty, moreover, is to clarify man’s 
relation to man; the church’s, man’s duty to God. 
As the two phases of duty can not conflict, and as all 
interpretations of Christianity are supposed to har- 
monize with fundamental ethics, the school may be 
considered the ally of all the branches of the church, 
supplying that rational basis for moral judgments which 
every thinking human being demands at one time or 
another. Indeed, the very efficacy and dependability 
of religion is sometimes contingent on just the sort of 
rationalized prejudice which the school can and does 
impart to its pupils. The practical value of moral 
instruction, on the other hand, is immensely increased 
by the emotionalization of religious conviction and 
aspiration. Capable of so immensely strengthening 
the work, each of the other, it is important that teacher 
and priest, as well as the laymen of both institutions, 
use all possible means of establishing and keeping up 
this friendly codperation of the two great instructive 
forces of modern times. 
SUMMARY 
The school is delegated by the state to: prepare 
children for efficient living and service. Other phases 
of this preparation are assumed by the home and the 
church, but it is the sense of society that the state, 
through its schools, can best attend to the training of 
mind and hand. Since all the forces which go to de- 
velop a whole man or woman must work simultaneously 
and should work harmoniously, it is very important 
that the school be in close touch and friendly relations 
with state, home, church, and all the institutions and 
forces which influence childhood.

CHAPTER II 
THE MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 
/ Aut the training which society gives to individuals, 
which helps them better to control their powers, may 
_ be called disciplinary.) This disciplinary control springs 
from a variety of relationships and principles; which 
may be divided for the sake of convenience into five 
general classes, giving rise to five types or modes of 
government. While each mode is distinct in its origins, 
nature, and results, few concrete instances of school 
government can be classed exactly with any one mode, 
owing to the complex nature of schoolroom life and 
aims. In actual practice the modes overlap, merging 
imperceptibly or passing sharply one into another. 
They represent nodal points in methods of school 
management, however; they are types of the means 
used to secure and keep good order and a good spirit 
in a schoolroom. ‘They predominate | at various periods 
in the development of any one child; > they are variously 
emphasized by different teachers, communities, and 
ages; they supplement and strengthen one another 
in a thousand ways. Through all their elaborate 
inter-relations, however, the fundamental differences Five 
fundamental 
modes 
in these five modes remain unchanged. In the follow- ~ 
ing discussion they are treated approximately in the 
order of their historical development, and in the 
reverse order of their probable worth in bringing about 
ideal school conditions.

authority   
14 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
I. Tue Move or ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY 
Pedagogy in its simplest form is the oldest science 
practiced by man. The man who mastered the first 
rude art taught it to his children and his neighbors, 
and because he knew more than they, found himself 
in a position of authority among them. Greatest of 
all men was Prometheus; and every unknown fire- 
bringer, with his circle of learners about him, shared 
his glory and his penalty. The authority of the 
teacher usually coincided with the paternal preroga- 
tives, and was so the more easily established. When 
schools were established, the authority of the teacher- 
father carried over naturally into the institution. No 
one reasoned why; it was a matter of tradition and 
development, an inevitable part of the sequence of 
events, a concession to the eternal fitness of things. 
That the teacher stands in the place of the parent has 
been one maxim universally accepted; and the nature 
and workings of the teacher’s authority have shown an 
interesting tendency to imitate the methods of control 
in vogue in the home. The era of stern discipline and 
severe corporal punishment in both was coéval; and 
when parental severity was relaxed in favor of more 
gentle means, the school was forced to fall into line, 
and somewhat reluctantly to concede its right to 
paddle and whip. : 
G ‘The mode of control by appeal to its absolute au- 
thority is, then, the school’s oldest, simplest, and most 
direct of all ways of securing good order. , Combined 
with the type which rests its power on the personal
-P-A-G-E-33
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 15 
appeal of the teacher to the child, it is the mode which 
has been consciously employed until very modern 
times. 
Nor is it by any means an outworn and discarded 
type of school government. Not only in practice but 
in theory, it rests upon a justification so sound that it 
will never become obsolete. Its acknowledged exist- 
ence and righteousness gives dignity and stability to 
all other forms of control. As a starting point if 
possible, as an ultimate appeal if necessary, the teach- 
er’s authoritative control of the situation, as society’s 
rightful representative, makes his position tenable. 
He controls his domain — within the reasonable limits 
set by custom and public opinion — as rightfully as 
other civil officers execute the statute law. 
That this mode is to be abandoned in favor of others 
when possible, then, is not because it rests upon any 
untenable principle, not because it is inherently un- 
just or harmful. It is because it is not the mode which 
is best calculated to teach pupils to be self-governing, 
and so to order their conduct that it gives the best 
service to society. / The use of authority is at best 
society’s necessary temporary expedient, when it finds 
itself confronted with many classes of people whose 
wishes do not conform to the general good. So the 
teacher’s authority is to be exercised as a concession 
to actual conditions, keeping always in mind the 
_ possibility of attaining an ideal condition in which it 
will not be needed. Its use may well be limited to the 
following cases: we

2. When the need of quick action and speedy and 
clear-cut decision preclude the slower methods. 
3. When the use of authority will have a good effect 
upon public opinion. 
4. In cases of anarchy, with those who deny and 
defy authority. An actual demonstration of 
the superiority of authorized and organized 
power over the will of the individual is usually 
that power’s best argument. There are few who 
do not recall the regenerating effects of a sound 
whipping upon some school bully who thought 
the teacher didn’t dare. 
The pupils with whom it is advisable to use this mode 
may be divided into three classses—the very young, 
the socially untrained, and the abnormal. The reason 
for its use with the very young is obvious enough. Since 
habit-forming is the type of educational training for 
them (the period of rationalization not having arrived), 
and since curiosity usually gives a sufficient impetus 
for new activities, constant and detailed direction is 
needed. Very little people must simply be told what 
to do, and punished in some reasonable way for not 
obeying, until the habit of obedience becomes fixed 
and its discretion clear. Self-direction comes naturally 
with the acquiring of fundamental habits and the 
ability to think, and so other modes normally supplant 
that of absolute authority as the child grows older. 
But little children must learn that some things are 
wrong and must not be done, or being done bring swift 
and sure punishment. ‘The first thing the child has 
to learn about this matter,” says the philosopher of 
The Breakfast Table, “is that lying is unprofitable —
-P-A-G-E-35
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 17 
afterwards that it is against the peace and dignity of 
the universe.” 
Perhaps the most appalling single condition facing 
American teachers in these days is the lack of home 
training shown everywhere. As one function after 
another, formerly vested in the home, is yielded up by 
that emancipated institution, the school is urged 
Once more into the breach, kind friends! 
to take up the neglected duty. The German teacher 
finds his beginner already grounded in a deep respect 
for authority, a fixed habit of implicit obedience, and 
a growing consideration for others. With this founda- 
tion laid, the superstructure of formal training is easily 
and solidly built. American teachers, especially in 
strictly American communities, must often lay this 
foundation themselves. They receive year after year 
sets of pupils who are not only socially untrained,! 
but whose lack of social training extends, so far as the 
home is concerned, throughout childhood and into 
maturity. It is trite and profitless to remark upon the 
decay of family authority — of which, as has been said, 
“there is as much as ever, but it has changed hands.” 
It is absolutely necessary, however, that we recognize 
this condition and its effect upon the discipline of our 
schools. It interferes seriously with their efficiency 
by forcing teachers to expend time and energy in giving 
their pupils a training which they might reasonably 
expect them to have received from their parents. 
1 The term “ social training” is a somewhat vague one, but is 
used here to mean that training which makes consideration for 
others habitual, and which teaches individuals to plan their lives 
with reference to the good of society. The socially 
untrained
-P-A-G-E-36
  The misuse 
of freedom   
18 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Socially untrained pupils, of whatever age, are in the 
same stage of development as the kindergarten pupil 
or the first-grader, and must be led through submission 
to authority, and personal influence, and wholesome 
interests in auxiliary activities, to the point at which 
the school appeal outweighs the personal one. 
Among the socially untrained none are more given 
to misunderstanding and misusing liberty, than those 
from whom it has been long and unjustly withheld. 
Freedom granted to men who have been long oppressed 
is especially likely to degenerate into license. The 
children of European immigrants escaping from long 
suppression and persecution in their own land, and the 
children who are cuffed into scared inactivity at home, 
are often children who take advantage of every relaxa- 
tion of authority, of every freedom from oversight and 
direction. They do not know how to use freedom with 
temperance, but are intoxicated with it to the point of 
lawlessness. They confuse liberty with license in a 
way that is natural and perhaps excusable, but it is 
the greatest of all mistakes to allow them to persist 
in this misunderstanding. (Until they have learned 
self-control, until they have learned that they belong 
to an organic whole whose members are interdependent, 
and in which injury is reflexive, they can not be trusted 
with much personal liberty.) Even those children 
whose parents enjoy and understand the true uses of 
liberty, those who may reasonably be expected to 
absorb from their environment the knowledge of rea- 
sonable limits and restraints to personal freedom, must 
be led carefully from one exercise of self-direction to 
another. For those unfortunates who can have no
-P-A-G-E-37
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 19 
real conception of the kind of freedom which insures 
the rights of all, there must be much restraint before 
the difference between liberty and license is plain. 
This problem of the alien and of the repressed child 
is especially important in great cities, and furnishes 
a chief reason for retaining there, unimpaired, con- 
servative ideas of the absolute authority of the teacher. 
Teachers recognize two types of pupils with whom 
the usual means fail of usual results. These are con- 
stitutional and temporary abnormals. Markedly ab- 
normal pupils have properly no place in the ordinary 
public school, but while our eleemosynary systems 
remain imperfect and inadequate for our needs, they 
will continue to complicate the teaching problem. 
The use of simple and direct authority as the quickest 
and most effective way of securing results is usually 
justifiable when such pupils are admitted to public 
schools. It is not right to take from the normal pupils 
in the school, the time necessary for dealing with these 
cases in the proper way. Every effort should be taken 
to have them removed to the special institutions where 
they belong; failing that, it is clearly not the duty of 
public school teachers to expend upon them more time 
than they are fairly entitled to, more than would be 
needed by normal children, and more than others re- 
ceive. @The great aim of the school is to improve 
the race, to better society; the palliation of the mis- 
takes and blunders of the ignorant or the vicious is 
a secondary matter} The teacher should expend his 
effort where it will pay. What, then, may be expected 
from public school teachers entrusted with the train- 
ing of subnormal or abnormal children? If they be

so trained that they can from habit follow direction, 
if their powers be turned into some channel which is 
at least harmless, and helpful if possible, about as 
much has been accomplished as can be done, and as 
much as can be expected without expert treatment. 
The temporarily abnormal are to be found at times 
in every schoolroom. They are the pupils who, usually 
tractable and amenable to all good influences, become 
unmanageable because of some passing circumstance. 
The power of a sudden infatuation, of ill-health, of 
any absorbing interest, may make a temporary anarch- 
ist of the schoolroom’s most law-abiding citizen, by 
overmastering all his customary standards and com- 
pelling absolute obedience to its demands. At such 
times the incentives to social conduct fall to lowest 
ebb, and the most generously disposed child becomes 
a thorough and ruthless egoist. Putting aside the 
higher modes which usually prove efficient, his teacher 
may find it necessary to exercise his bare authority 
in such a crisis. 
As in the case of control through personal influence, 
the control of absolute authority should definitely 
appoint its successor. Good citizens submit to law 
because they believe in its righteousness, and, in a 
democracy, because they realize that it is made by 
themselves and their neighbors, who are in turn to 
benefit by it. Good citizens in a school, in like manner, 
conform to its customs, observe its limitations, and 
help with its machinery, because they know that ma- 
chinery to be devised for their own good. The point 
of accomplishment in the making of a good citizen- 
pupil is that at which he begins to codperate with, 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 2I 
where formerly he submitted to the imposed authority 
of, the teacher. Authority is then no longer imposed, 
but is accepted voluntarily. This point comes to 
some children very early, and to others late in their 
school career or not at all. As children are poor 
generalizers, it needs sometimes to be learned specifi- 
cally many times before it becomes a principle for 
general application. Even then, tradition and habit 
may produce some surprising cases of defiance of law. 
II. THe Move or APPEAL TO PERSONAL INTEREST 
Following the instinctive obedience to parental 
authority and its substitutes, and closely allied to that 
first allegiance, comes the selfish motive for conduct. 
At first the desire for self-gratification leads usually 
to defiance of authority, for children see the immediate 
outcome and strive for it. As thefpower of thinking 
develops, however, and reasoning gives them an in- 
sight into final gains and losses, children learn to deny 
themselves an immediate gratification for an ultimate 
gain. When this point in development has been 
reached, it is possible to appeal to the child’s sense of 
self-interest. )He begins to do things because he 
knows it is ‘good for him — either because he reaps 
some reward that is pleasant, or because he has faith 
that a given course will bring him pleasure in the future, 
as some one has told him it will. He learns to balance 
values, and to choose the one which his training and 
disposition hold most worth while. 
There is one motive which may be used at all ages, 
although it is probably most active and potent during 
adolescence. It may be endlessly varied and general- A changed 
attitude 
The hope 
of rewards
-P-A-G-E-40
A fear 
that is a 
fallacy   
22 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
ized. This motive is the hope of reward, the aim 
of self-improvement or gratification. There exists a 
great and mistaken prejudice against it, however, 
which has weakened the work of countless conscien- 
tious teachers, who fear that they encourage selfish- 
ness and love of personal gain in emphasizing the old 
and universal law that good begets good, and that 
virtue brings a reward beside its recognition of itself. 
Surely the reward in kind of good and evil is one prin- 
ciple that may safely be abstracted from human ex- 
perience, and is safely taught to the young. Indeed, 
its apparent contradictions form one of the most pro- 
lific of all sources for inquiry into fundamentals, and 
consequent establishing of truths that do not appear 
superficially. No better, no more universal, varied, 
and obvious illustrations of the complexity of life, of 
the unity of the social fabric, or of the far-reaching 
effects of every human act, can possibly exist than the 
answers to the questions that arise daily in every 
home and schoolroom concerning the truth of this 
law. Every illustration of its application in their 
own lives, tends to strengthen a faith in its suniver- 
sality and dependableness, which must function con- 
stantly and healthfully in controlling conduct, both 
in the school and outside and beyond it. 
Provided care is taken to call attention to the fact 
that rewards are sometimes long delayed, diffused, 
or subjective in character, the use of the immediate 
and concrete reward is harmless and commendable. 
There is nothing in the rewarding of a deserved honor 
that does harm, if the nature of the reward is such as 
to be unobjectionable. It is the failure to recognize  
-P-A-G-E-41
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 23 
and emphasize the unseen rewards that holds danger; 
the ignoring of that compensation to virtue which is 
al but indirect, sure but perhaps long delayed. 
(oo time a child receives a recognized reward for doing 
right, his faith in the paying qualities of goodness is 
increased.) And this faith in the absolute equity of 
life’s give-and-take, in the indestructibility of the 
moral law, is not the sordid and unworthy thing that 
many teachers are disposed to call it. All our faith 
in the ultimate justice of human events and in the 
goodness of God is bound up in it; why should we 
blindly deny it to children? The question-begging 
injunction to “do right because it is right” has, in an 
effort to establish an impracticable loyalty to a truth 
too abstract for trained thinkers to comprehend, done 
incalculable harm to any number of inquiring young 
people. 
Conversely, the punishment of evil as an unescap- 
able aftermath can not be too much emphasized. 
Here, owing to the stern customs of our ancestors and 
the rigorous traditions of the schoolroom, there is not 
the same prejudice to be overcome as exists with regard 
to the careful reward of well-doing. Children expect 
to be punished if they do wrong at school; teachers 
expect to mete out justice, or at least retribution, to 
sinners. 
This sense of self-interest is an immensely valuable 
asset to the teacher. It may be used also in a way 
to work great harm to pupils, if selfish ends are justified 
in the incentives held out to children. If the ends 
represented as desirable are such as build up fine 
ideals, the method of appeal to self-interest is justifi- Punishment

able. If material rewards are over-emphasized (as, 
for example, they have been in the popular statistics 
showing the money value of honesty and good character 
and education), or preéminence is held up as a thing 
to be striven for, the results will be deplorable. For 
instance, to urge a child to study that he may win a 
prize or stand first in his class is to appeal to instincts 
that need inhibition rather than encouragement; but 
to urge him to study that he may become a useful 
man, a helpful and noble citizen, is to encourage the 
sort of ambition that children ought to have. The 
mode is the same in both instances, but the ideals 
differ fundamentally. 
That is to say, that while there are material and 
immediate rewards for doing right, which we should 
not deny nor conceal, nor withhold unless they are 
really harmful, there are subjective rewards which are 
of far more value and permanence. These subjective 
rewards are the ones which should be constantly 
emphasized as the rewards worth most earnest effort, 
and the ones most surely to be received. At the same 
time, there is no inherent wrong in the statement of 
the law that right brings reward and wrong incurs 
punishment in some form, inevitably. 
As children grow older, and plan their lives more 
consciously, this mode of control becomes more im- 
portant. Combined with that of personal influence, 
it may be instrumental in changing the whole course 
of conduct of a thoughtless or antagonistic pupil. 
Its most powerful allies are the imagination and the 
idealizing qualities that are strong in youth. To 
arouse an indifferent pupil from his narrow absorp-

  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 25 
tion in what he is and enjoys, to a conception of what 
he may become and accomplish — that is the miracle 
that, once performed, may readily change him into an 
alert, interested person with a motive for working. 
In adolescence, when imagination is alive, it means 
much to have presented the material that may furnish 
a vision of the future. A pitifully large number of 
men and women lead spiritless, humdrum lives, because 
no vision of the possibility of life came to them in the 
days when they might have gone on to its realization. 
No inspiring speaker, no book written from a great 
heart, no trip from the sheltered and quiet home into 
the big world of action and achievement, no picture 
or song or heroic act, fired the ready soul at the critical 
time to set a goal for itself that would make all effort 
and sacrifice worth while. 
A realization of the responsibility of the school in 
this matter is showing itself in the movement for 
vocational guidance. Skillful teachers who under- 
stand the possibilities of their incomparable calling 
have long utilized it, directly for the final gain of their 
charges, indirectly for the improvement of school 
order. It furnishes an incentive of high order if the 
right ideals of accomplishment are united with it, 
and combined with the mode of appeal to social re- 
sponsibility makes the best basis for motivation. 
Translated into concrete terms for pupils, it offers 
these aims for good conduct: 
“qa. The development of a good brain, capable of 
_ doing the thinking that may be required of it.

c. The ability to make a good living, growing out of 
the first two. 
d. The ability to appreciate fine and beautiful acne 
e. A strong and noble character. 
J. The ability to serve one’s generation well. 
If this all-round aim be kept before both students 
and teachers, it means that they will choose, in plan- 
ning courses of study, a variety of exercises and activ- 
ities, not one narrow set of studies. There will be 
some of subjects requiring earnest application and real 
thought, for even if such do not develop a general 
intellectual facility, they at least prove ability for 
hard work and clear thinking. There will be no 
neglect of manual training; writing, drawing, the 
playing of some musical instrument, carpentering, 
ceramics, sewing, cooking, or metal work —a fair 
degree of skill in several of these the all-round man or 
woman has. 
Mental power and physical skill combine to make 
men and women economically independent, but that 
is not all they need. The fatal fallacy of the trade 
school lies in its neglect of the heart, out of which are 
the issues of life. The failing of the conventional 
school curriculum is that it trains mind and heart to 
the appreciation of good things which mind and hand 
may not be able to furnish. The boy or girl with an 
eye to his own interest, therefore, will plan to include 
in his course of study much that will develop taste, 
appreciation, and hunger for fine and beautiful things. 
He will wish to learn something of social service, of 
the ways in which he may help his generation to do its 
work. Above all, he will include as much of ethical

culture of a formal kind as may be, and keep mind and 
heart awake for the incidental inspiration that comes 
to the watchful. 
It is in this last choice that the bearing of conscious 
self-interest upon conduct and discipline appears. The The choice 
of conduct 
youth who sincerely wishes to make himself as noble ° 
as he can, must understand that he must choose, not 
once but time after time, the best response to the 
situations that present themselves. He must know 
that the only assurance he can have that, when a 
great temptation to do wrong comes to him, he will 
resist it, is that he has habitually resisted a thousand 
little temptations to dishonesty, discourtesy, inat- 
tention, laziness, familiarity, intemperance, imper-_ 
tinence. He must understand that much of his future 
happiness or misery depends upon his conscious choice 
of immediate or ultimate ends, of present fun that is 
without the law or within it. (Good disciplinarians 
learn early ‘to impress the duty of the right choice 
upon students by showing them the inexorable laws of 
cause and effect. , ' 
There is a danger, it is true, in using this mode of 
appeal to self-interest. It is that boys and girls may 
acquire an idea that virtue exists mainly for its re- 
wards. They are good then for revenue only, and 
feel justified in forsaking what is right if the promised 
rewards are not forthcoming, or if they see law-breakers 
enjoying prosperity and evident happiness. There is 
a possibility that our ethical training may degenerate 
into some such bargain with The Powers as the Romans 
had in their state worship. It may become a matter 
of bargain and barter, unless personal ideals of the The danger

highest nature animate it and dominate it. Religion 
furnishes the surest antidote to this tendency, but 
religion is a thing that may not be taught in public 
schools. Next best are the ideals of personal honor 
that the greatest literature and the greatest historical 
characters give. To gain, after years of effort, the 
purity of Arthur and the devotion of Antigone, the 
patriotism of William the Silent, the self-mastery of 
Jean Valjean, is the goal which, kept steadily before 
their eyes, will give to our youth the strength to choose 
to do what is right. 
III. THE Mope or Controt THroucH PERSONAL 
INFLUENCE 
In its total power through the formative period of 
the life of a child, consciously exercised personal in- 
fluence ranks among the first of the elements in edu- 
cation. All good teachers wish to possess personal 
influence over their pupils; there are frequent occasions 
when it is necessary to exercise it. Many teachers 
abuse it ignorantly, or fail to use it to the highest 
and most permanent ends. It is a primitive and a 
dangerous method of control, a universal and wonder- 
fully potent one, and one capable of the best possible 
use. 
Gts danger lies in the temptation to the teacher to 
magnify his own power through its exercise, and to 
fail to appeal to the social consciousness of his pupils) 
Vanity is a failing from which teachers are not exempt; 
indeed, the continued preéminence which schoolroom 
experience gives to the teacher, is liable to develop any 
latent tendency to undue self-esteem which he may 
g >
-P-A-G-E-47
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 29 
possess. Few human beings are above appreciating 
the flattery of those who order their conduct to please 
them. In almost any school building are to be found 
teachers who are not averse to having people know 
that pupils who later gave trouble to other teachers, 
were in their grades tractable and industrious. They 
were good for them — owing, usually, to some charm 
of manner, personal appearance, or trick of amuse- 
ment, such as captivate the easily aroused admiration 
of childhood. The use of such personal assets in the 
schoolroom as an initial means of securing results is 
wholly legitimate; but to continue to build on so 
narrow a foundation is a fatal mistake. 
The use of personal influence is to be nicely differ- 
entiated from its unconscious and incidental exercise, 
which in itself forms one of the great elements in 
schoolroom control. (The mode of control through con- 
scious personal influence is justifiable in the teaching 
of young children, with whom it must be employed 
constantly, and with older children who have not been 
aroused to a consciousness of their duty toward others, 
nor received a sufficient emotional impulse to insure 
a response,’ Wherever, in fact, the modes of govern- 
ment by substitution and appeal to social consciousness 
are impracticable, and the mode of authoritative 
control is not necessary, there the personal influence 
of the teacher may advantageously be used. The 
strength of its appeal lies in an emotional connota- 
tion, usually very wholesome, but applicable only to 
the case and persons in point. Herein lies the essen- 
tial weakness of this mode of control. In itself it 
establishes no ideal. and no habit which functions

outside the schoolroom, or in similar situations in 
other schoolrooms where a different teacher is in 
control. 
But it is possible so to merge the individual into 
the social appeal, so to broaden the loyalty which 
urges the sought-for judgment, that this method 
becomes a powerful help in establishing the ultimate 
mode of self-government through motives induced 
by social consciousness. It shares this preparatory 
function with the still older mode of appeal to bare 
authority, or to the force with which that authority 
is armed. It is not so ultimate, so ideal a method, 
but it may be used for entirely righteous ends and in 
the interests of the ideal and ultimate method. 
The process of generalization in the mind of the 
pupil is not necessarily a conscious one, From the 
motive of doing right to please his teacher, or his 
mother, or his father, he may be led easily a and aad 
Much is being done in “Kindergartens and primary 
schools, especially in games and exercises devised for 
the purpose, to develop a recognition of the corporate 
nature of the school; and the child so trained, even 
at the period when the personal influence of the teacher 
is strongest, is beginning to put the needs of society 
above his own pleasure or that of his personal friends. 
At a period a little later, especially in the upper in- 
termediate and grammar grades, loyalty to a “‘crowd” 
“gang” often supplants the child’s first loyalty to 
mother or teacher. The problem here is a harder 
one, for while the personal influence of mothers and 
teachers is usually exercised in the interests of good
-P-A-G-E-49
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 31 
school government, that of school children’s cliques 
is often directly adverse to it. Sometimes the fervid 
devotion is to a single chum or to a trio or quartet. 
In any case, the problem is not to do away with the 
relationship which has captured the child’s inherent 
capacity for devotion, but to transform its personal 
influence into a wholesome and healthful one. Pres- 
ident Diaz, organizing his efficient rurales from the 
idle desperadoes of his Mexican cities; Mr. George, 
teaching the waifs of New York City to be good citizens 
at Freeville; Sir George Baden-Powell with his Boy 
Scouts — all have recognized the instinctive nature 
of crowd-loyalty and its possibilities. To substitute 
in the clique interests and ideals that shall be construc- 
tive and not destructive is often a really Herculean 
task, for it amounts to remaking a whole set of social 
ideas. It often involves the education of the parents 
and the community as well as the group of children 
directly involved. 
In the high school the situation is always a com- 
plicated one. To the old loyalties to teachers and 
cliques are added new ones to any number of organi- 
zations, to chums and sweethearts, and even to adored 
authors, public characters, and ‘“‘causes.”? To make 
these varied allegiances and influences potent for good 
school government is a complicated task, the more so 
because adolescence is inclined to be reticent with 
regard to the influences which are at the time most 
powerful. Some personal influences are so harmful 
that no ingenuity can devise a means of turning them 
to good account. They must simply be inhibited if 
possible. Others, long regarded as evil, are now

coming to be recognized as natural and good, but 
needing direction and training. 
But for practical purposes, that influence which 
still remains in the high school of most use to the 
teachers in securing good order, is the teacher’s own, 
consciously and unconsciously exercised. The beauti-~ 
ful idealism of youth, that sees so often in a teacher 
the inspiring personality which it is a joy to follow, 
lends itself with equal pleasure to the joy of pleasing 
so charming a mentor. Thousands of boys and girls 
in American high schools meet for the first time in a 
teacher a person of ‘refinement, of intellectual leader- 
ship, even of attractive personal appearance. These 
qualities open to the eager search of youth a new world 
of beauty and worth, and the directing deity has but 
to point the way and the enamored discoverer follows. 
Even where poverty and ignorance do not give so 
pathetic a background to these personal enthugjasms 
of pupils for teachers, they are among the st 
of all influences upon adolescents. ) 
Anexample The writer recalls one gracious white-haire; 
for years principal of the high school in a tow: 
Middle West, whose personal influence over tw 
ations of boys and girls unquestionably did mo 
anything else, not only to fix standards of condyct in 
the high school, but to sound the social keynote. of 
that town. Her ideas of good taste, courtesy, and 
honor moulded the public opinion and the customs of 
her high school to such an extent, that during her 
régime there was never any serious trouble on account 
of disorder. She failed, however, just where a teacher 
of strong personality is liable to fail—in generaliza- 
       
  
-P-A-G-E-51
  
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 33 
tion. The younger, less experienced, and less in- 
’ fluential principals who succeeded her had a most 
unhappy experience with a set of young people who 
had been been kept too strictly in moral leading strings. 
Without the strong and wise personal guidance and con- 
trol to which they were used, they ‘‘ran wild.”” Appeal 
to school loyalty was useless; no such sentiment 
existed. They had been brought up, first ‘by their 
parents, then by the principal herself, in the nurture 
and admonition of a personal loyalty to a woman whose 
word was admittedly final. No person new to the 
community could possibly have had her personal hold 
upon pupils and parents. Two principals failed in 
that high school before a man was found with suffi- 
cient personal charm to manage things in the accus- 
tomed way. At present the school is on its old footing, 
with a calm and unruffled exterior, and with an inner 
life fully as free from the disturbing commotion of 
growth. When the fortuitous circumstance of a prin- 
cipal with a winning personality is no longer respon- 
sible for its smooth-running, the school will “go to 
pieces” again. Its peace and order and industry are 
founded upon no stable principle, its students base 
their law-abiding on no conscious loyalty to an insti- 
tution or to the will of society at large, which made 
the institution. 
To effect the transfer of allegiance from the teacher 
to the comparatively abstract conception of the good 
of the school, or.even to the pupil’s own future, is no 
easy process. It is, moreover, one requiring some 
self-abnegation. It involves a very old kind of sacri- 
fice, in which individual preéminence is given up to an
-P-A-G-E-52
  34 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
ultimate social gain. And it is a sad fact that teachers 
are found in our schools who deliberately and selfishly 
cultivate personal devotion in their pupils, making no 
effort whatever to divert it from themselves to more 
general channels.! 
The period of adolescence is one which especially 
demands wise personal guidance. ‘To neglect the 
child at this time,” said Plutarch long ago, ‘“unbars 
the doors to vice.” Sympathy and encouragement, 
restraint and guidance, must be offered tactfully and 
administered skillfully. Boys need men teachers of 
good sense and honor; girls require women teachers 
who understand them, and who are personally attrac- 
tive enough to win their confidence. One sincere 
friendship for a wise teacher, emotionalized by admira- 
tion to the point where the approval of the beloved 
guide is worth every effort, will do more to establish 
good habits and inspire high ideals than all the lectures, 
self-government schemes, good literature, and speech- 
making that the best high school can give. 
1 This remark applies only to personal devotion functioning as a 
motive in promoting right conduct in school. Of course there can 
be no possible condemnation for the closest personal friendship 
between teachers and pupils.

  CHAPTER III 
THE MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT (Continued) 
IV. THE Mover or WHOLESOME REPLETION ee 
Ir is said of General Arney, a leader in the move- 
ment for the relief of Kansas in the ’50’s, and later 
governor of Oklahoma, that he could write two letters 
simultaneously, one with each hand, and carry on an 
animated conversation at the same time. Such in- 
stances of the division of attention always arouse 
incredulity before, and wondering admiration after, 
their verification. They occur rarely, even among the 
most gifted and versatile thinkers. Young children, 
as well as the great majority of adults, can give atten- 
tion to but one thing at a time. The attention of 
children is easily diverted, and the rapidity with which 
it changes may give a false appearance of its simultane- 
ous direction toward several different interests. But 
stimuli act in succession, and the constant choice 
between them gives to the judgment its greatest exer- 
cise and means of development. 
This incompatibility of directed attentions, which 
may be called — to borrow a term from Physics — the 
Impenetrability of Attention, gives rise to the corollary 
of the Impenetrability of Interest. One interest at 
a time holds the exclusive attention of the simple, 
directly-working mind of a child. To train the child The impene-

so that these periods of exclusive attention shall be 
long enough to give appreciable results, is one of the 
chief aims of imposed disciplinary activities. But the 
initial and fundamental condition is not the result of 
training; it is an inherent psychological characteristic. 
It gives to the teacher of children one of the principal 
means of directing the development of good habits, 
since it is possible to make desirable stimuli so obvious 
that attention must perforce respond, to the exclusion 
of those stimuli which have been made as unobtrusive 
as possible. Since the child can give attention to but one 
thing at a time, the prominence given to stimuli to whole- 
some action tends to inhibit response to unwholesome 
stimuli. This law lies at the root of the third great 
mode of school government, that which, for want of a 
better term, we are calling the mode of Wholesome 
Repletion.! It is that method of control and develop- 
ment which seeks to kill unhealthful and destructive 
tendencies by disuse; to crowd out the bad by the good, 
until habit and taste are so fixed that those stimuli 
that might once have excited a ready response have no 
effect. 
Concrete examples of this mode of government are 
without number. They include all the devices em- 
ployed from time immemorial to keep children out of 
mischief. The ‘‘busy-work” of the primary grades, 
which really affords a variety of positive and desirable 
training for hand and brain, confesses in its name its 
aim and origin, which is the purely negative one of 
employing attention during the intervals between

the mode described is too close to be sacrificed.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 37 
concentration on lessons. Busy-work may defeat its 
own purpose, and become a hindrance rather than 
an aid to good order, under certain conditions: 
1. It is not helpful if it lacks an essential intrinsic 
appeal that is stronger than the always ready stimuli 
to voluntary attention. It must be interesting. 
Bright colors, beautiful texture, the reasonableness of 
the task or problem, the challenge to successful imita- 
tion, the desire of making a present to mother or some 
other dear one — these are some of the characteristics 
or incentives that give interest to busy-work. The 
appeal must be simple, direct, and strong to compete 
successfully with the call of schoolroom fun, the con- 
stant play of surrounding movement and event, that 
appeal to a child to give his attention to the life about 
him. 
2. It must be changed frequently, lest attention, 
jaded by too long application, recoil so far as not 
willingly or easily to be brought back. 
3. It must be quiet and orderly, or it causes more 
confusion than it cures. Teachers have been known 
to employ children not engaged in lessons by having 
them clean blackboards, sort pencils, or distribute 
materials. The movement and noise disturb others 
who are trying to concentrate on lessons. 
Any motive which gives an intrinsic interest to the 
regular school tasks tends to direct a degree of atten- 
tion to them which excludes illegitimate interests. 
Therefore all devices and varieties of motivation are 
properly classed with the methods of the mode of 
Wholesome Repletion. The vividness given to school

work of the school, which tends to outvalue the call of 
fun and mischief. 
Tue MopE oF WHOLESOME REPLETION IN THE 
Hic ScHoou 
The character of the school as a preparatory institu- 
tion becomes less pronounced as the possibilities of its 
preparatory function unfold. That is to say, as we 
realize how various and how efficient its training may 
be, that training acquires more and more of intrinsic 
interest, and the life of the high school gains an im- 
portance entirely aside from its value as preparation. 
The preparation is more, not less efficient than formerly, 
but the immediate value and pleasure of its activities 
eclipse their final purpose in the minds of the students. 
The high school is a place wherein people live, not an 
ante-chamber and waiting-room to life. As its life 
becomes richer, more complicated, more and more a 
replica of the great life beyond and outside it, organiza- 
tions devoted to the cultivation of specific interests 
spring up within it. Literary societies, athletic asso- 
ciations, class teams and school teams in tennis, de- 
bating, rowing, clubs for everything from Browning to 
folk-dancing, and even secret societies that imitate the 
Greek-letter fraternities of college life, have followed 
the introduction of a broader spirit and an enlarged 
curriculum into the secondary school. 
The tendency to organization is of two kinds. There 
are children who, left to themselves, organize as nat- 
urally as they breathe; and there are others who 
require as definite a tutoring in this art as in reading
-P-A-G-E-57
  
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 39 
and writing. The spontaneous type of organization 
expends its energy largely in the fascinating business 
of exclusion; it is negative rather than positive, and 
gives us the gang and the clique, with rites and secrets 
and an exaggerated personal loyalty to members. On 
the other hand, positive and constructive organization 
among young people is almost wholly imitative. Much 
of the great value of high school organization lies in 
the opportunity of teachers to supervise and direct. 
Here teachers may come into close personal contact 
with pupils upon the common ground: of voluntary 
interests; and through the medium of those interests 
exert an influence impossible to the more formal pur- 
suits of the classroom. 
A certain small proportion of high school students 
find in lessons alone an absorbing interest. These 
students — these ‘‘digs” who would rather make a 
star recitation than take a city — are rarely disposed 
to give any trouble to teachers. Their moral digres- 
sions, like their numbers, are negligible. But the 
great majority of high school boys and girls regard 
the curriculum as a necessary excuse for a variety of 
delightful relations and pursuits, which appeal per se 
to their imagination and love of action. The motives 
for study are often remote and artificial, accepted on 
faith as presented by parents, teachers, and long 
established custom. Even where they are real, they 
appeal rather to a cold-blooded self-interest than to 
any immediate need or wish. But athletics and social 
affairs and fascinating arts like photography have a 
direct appeal. A hundred new things beckon to the 
aroused spirit of youth; a hundred voices call, all The

strange and sweet, and youth will answer to the most 
insistent. If free choice be given among as many special 
activities as the size and equipment of the school permit, 
and then freedom to divert into the channel of these special 
interests all the energy remaining from the thorough 
performance of regular school duties, there will be left 
litile of youthful spirits to be kept from evil. 
With all its possibilities, this mode of control requires 
very careful planning and still more careful manage- 
ment. Under careless or tactless supervision it may 
produce disastrous results. Here are some reasons for 
its failure, partial or complete, in some high schools 
where it has been tried and found inadequate or un- 
satisfactory: : 
1. Inexperienced children and youths are permitted 
to organize and manage their extra-curricular activities 
without close and wise supervision. 
2. There is an absence of the strict rule that only 
those who are carrying their studies satisfactorily can 
engage in athletics or other special activities; or the 
rule is not conscientiously enforced. Consequently 
these secondary recreative activities come to take 
first place, and scholarship suffers. 
3. Students do not have freedom to turn their atten- 
tion immediately to recreative activities, upon finishing 
their regular tasks. This flaw in management is 
responsible for more of failure, perhaps, than any 
other one thing. If John, finishing his Latin, has 
permission to leave the room at once and go to the 
gymnasium, where he is in training for an indoor meet, 
he will work hard, leave the assembly room quietly, 
and disturb no one. If Louise, having written and 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 41 
copied her theme, is free to go to the rest-room and 
embroider the front of her new blouse, she will not 
spend her spare time in writing notes to the other girls, 
who have not finished their themes yet but who do 
not object to interruption. John and Louise have not 
only aided in upholding schoolroom order, but they 
have had a motive for learning to work with concentra- 
tion and energy. The iron-bound rule of “No passing 
between classes” probably lessens confusion in the 
halls to promote it in the assembly-room. 
4. Some high school clubs do not offer open member- 
ship to all who can qualify. It destroys the democracy 
of the high school to allow young people to elect or 
reject members. It encourages snobbishness by giving 
full play to the often blundering judgment of youth. 
A posted statement of the membership qualifications, 
dues, and duties of each high school society or team, 
with limited membership decided by supervised com- 
petition, seems the fairest and best way of controlling 
membership. The natural tendency of human beings 
to flock in congenial cliques, with a penal system by 
which offending members are denied privileges, may 
be depended upon to keep the membership fairly 
homogeneous and friendly. 
Without entering into an extended discussion of 
them, a word may be said here about high school 
secret societies. They exist with no thought of the 
good of all the school, nor do they answer any real 
need of high school pupils that can not better be 
met in other ways. It is true that they do absorb 
practically all the time of their members that is not 
spent in school work, and that by setting up a distinct

line of cleavage between Greeks and “barbs,” they 
may even lessen the tendency to schoolroom disorder. 
It is usually true that members of high school Greek- 
letter societies do not indulge in the foolish tricks and 
pranks to which other students are given; their absurd 
imitation of their elders extends to premature sophisti- 
cation that scorns all childish things. Their mischie- 
vous instincts are expended in ways far more injurious 
to them, and far harder for school authorities and 
parents to combat. 
The intrinsic evil of the high school fraternity lies 
partly in the impossibility of its effective supervision. 
Left to themselves, its members are pretty sure to adopt 
the superficial hall-marks of the more spectacular of 
the college models; the real objects, like the real need, ° 
of the college fraternity do not enter into their con- 
sciousness. As an aid to good order and a good spirit 
in the school, the secret society has shown itself a 
clear failure, both with regard to its own members 
and to outsiders. Where they do not exist, teachers 
will do well to allow them no foothold; where they 
are to be found, the problem of their management or 
expulsion must be dealt with as local conditions indicate. 
Fortunately a growing public sentiment against 
them presages their extinction at no very distant 
date, even without the united influence of the college 
fraternities and sororities, which is now directed 
against them. This attitude of the college societies 
will probably accomplish what all the arguments of 
good sense and expediency have not been able to effect, 
and the next few years will see the end of the fraternity 
obsession among high school boys and girls. The  
-P-A-G-E-61
  
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 43 
evil of caste consciousness, however, which is the 
backbone of such societies, will remain when this 
especial manifestation is done away, unless care is 
taken to build up healthy ideals of school equality and 
courtesy. 
The social organizations in any high school should 
be answers to a real need, growing out of that need and 
of the consciousness that the school authorities stand 
ready to sanction and foster whatever is for the real 
pleasure and benefit of the students. Existing in- 
terests, wholesome in nature and effect, when extensive 
enough to warrant it, should be able to effect organiza- 
tion with the hearty codperation of the faculty. It is 
a foolish waste of energy and time to try to effect 
organizations to create interests. These were better 
developed quietly by individual effort of teachers and 
students, until enough pupils are really interested to 
demand a club or committee or team. 
Any activity flourishes better under the care of a 
regularly organized body than when left to the hit- 
or-miss direction of a group of irresponsible people, 
however, and when enough people to form a club have 
become actively interested in it, it is best to organize. 
Organization is usually the least of the anxieties of 
teachers who want to improve school spirit and be- 
havior by wholesome occupation of time and attention, 
The more difficult part of the process is the arousing 
of the initial interest that warrants organization. Un- 
failing tact, energy, and enthusiasm are needed for the 
task of creating new channels for youth’s “long, long 
thoughts,” and redirecting into these more wholesome 
ways energies that are being spent to no good purpose.

  Establishing 
interests 
Nature of 
organization 44 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
The first step is to find where the interests of students 
lie. In many rural communities and small towns 
there seems to be a lack of adequate activities, and the 
young people exist in a semi-comatose state, deterred 
from actual mischief by Puritanic tradition, but equally 
inactive along the line of the healthy enterprises that 
they should be carrying on. In larger places the 
activities of adolescence have often been badly directed, 
perhaps by those who profit by commercializing 
entertainment. Here they need redirection, while in 
the case of country children they must be created or 
at least stimulated. Some organization is often 
necessary even in the first stages of establishing a 
new enterprise, as for instance in starting the game of 
tennis where it has not been played before. A division 
into teams is a device that arouses the interest that 
comes from emulation. But this initial organization 
is an imposed one, to merge after a time into a more 
thorough one suggested by the students when their 
interest has been deepened by pleasurable experience. 
That is to say, it is useless to attempt to base this 
mode of control upon artificial interests; they must 
be genuine and intrinsic or any good results obtained 
through the charm of novelty will soon pass away, 
proving the waste of time and effort involved. 
Being satisfied, then, that there exists enough in- 
terest to justify an organization, the question of its 
nature and form is next to be decided. Three require- 
ments for students’ societies need constantly to be 
kept in mind: 
They must be democratic. 
They must be effective. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 45 
They must be so managed as to keep the auxiliary 
interests of the school subordinate to its main 
purpose. 
The first of these conditions is fulfilled if the member- Regulating 
ship of a society be open to all who have met the membership 
entrance requirements, decided upon by the faculty or 
by faculty and members acting together. Scholarship 
is the most important of these, for it is a regulation 
that appeals to the common sense of everyone that no 
student should be permitted to engage in extra-curri- 
cular activities unless he have carried his regular 
studies. In some schools the further qualification of 
congeniality is so highly valued that members are 
given the right to blackball an applicant in certain 
clubs without giving any reason for their action. 
This is a practice to be discouraged, for it leads almost 
inevitably to snobbishness and the growth of foolish 
prejudices. Members may be given the right to 
blackball an applicant in certain clubs, providing the 
members are willing to give the reason for their action 
to their faculty adviser. In a majority of cases even 
this privilege were better withheld, especially in the 
large athletic and literary organizations. For similar 
reasons, it is better not to allow high school societies 
to extend invitations to membership, except where 
such invitations are directly contingent upon the 
attaining of high rank in some subject, or the render- 
ing of signal service to the school, when they become 
honors that are open to all. The knowledge that any 
society in the school is open to any student who can 
satisfy the requirements of scholarship and of the 
special ability needed, is a valuable spur to effort and
-P-A-G-E-64

ness 
Keeping

their place” 46 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
an assurance of a healthy democratic spirit in the 
school. 
The second necessity, that of effectiveness, is not so 
easily disposed of. A good general rule for those who 
are treading new ground is to keep the first organiza- 
tion very simple, appointing or electing officers for 
whom there is real work to be done, and carefully adapt- 
ing the usual functions of such officers to the present 
needs. Similar societies in other schools offer good 
suggestions, but should not be copied slavishly, since 
the initiative and persistence of students differ so 
widely. Small administrative bodies, of course, are 
the most effective; but on the other hand, the success 
of young people’s societies depends so largely upon 
giving all something to do, that a large number of 
officers and committees are usually included in the 
management. Standards of efficiency, established care- 
fully at the beginning, with provision for the dismissal 
of trouble-making or lazy officers, are precautions 
which it is wise to adopt. 
The maintenance of the third requirement depends 
upon the vigilance of the teachers. If checked at 
regular intervals, and if methods are provided by which 
students who fall below a fair standard are deprived 
for a time of their special privileges, or even of active 
membership in the societies to which they belong, 
scholarship — by which is meant here a fair degree of 
accomplishment in studies — may easily be kept in 
its proper place as the leading interest in the school. 
The machinery by which students are reinstated when 
neglected work has been made up, should be as prompt 
and sure in its workings as that by which they are   
     
-P-A-G-E-65
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 47 
shut out of these activities when they fail to meet 
requirements. A very large part of the trouble and 
delinquency caused by overdone athletics and social 
affairs, could be prevented by quicker and surer means 
of controlling participation. Every school in which 
there are several societies and athletic teams should 
have sets of blank permissions and suspensions, to 
faciliate this process of adjustment of privilege to 
standing in classes. 
The special interests utilized for social development 
in high schools are almost without number, but they 
fall easily into a few loosely defined classes. There 
are those which are purely athletic, musical, literary, 
or forensic. There are recreational clubs based upon 
physical exercises of various kinds — dancing, includ- 
ing the folk-dancing so deservedly popular, tennis, 
boating, “hiking,” and camping. Added to these are 
the clubs organized to encourage the dilettantism of 
students: the camera clubs, the wireless circles, the 
foreign language conversation meetings, societies for 
the study of plays, pictures, and politics, travel clubs, 
and social settlement associations, or other altruistic 
efforts. Lastly, there are the purely social organiza- 
tions, which are of two kinds: those which are elastic 
and democratic in membership, and those which 
gratify the tendency to exalt exclusiveness by organ- 
izing it. The democratic sort of social activity may 
be fostered best as a natural accompaniment to other 
interests —by permitting, for instance, each high 
school organization to give one party, properly super- 
vised and chaperoned, each year or each semester. 
The second kind of organization leads to the fraternity

or sorority, to whose evils reference has already been 
made. 
It is necessary that there be constant and friendly 
supervision of all high school organizations. To this 
end each one should have its faculty adviser, who is 
expected to attend all meetings, and is responsible for 
the measures and actions of the society. He may be 
elected by the members or appointed by the principal. 
To prevent any shadow of scandal in money matters, 
there should be an auditing committee with at least 
one faculty member, to go over the books of each enter- 
prise, preferably twice a year. In some schools all the 
societies put their funds into the hands of a faculty 
treasurer, who looks after the finances of the different 
organizations as part of his regular work.! 
A custom which lays emphasis upon earnest aims is 
that of requiring each student enterprise to submit to 
the school at least once a year a report of work accom- 
plished. This puts a premium upon industry, encour- 
ages the carrying out of a definite program, and exposes 
the comparative fruitlessness of the purely social 
organizations. It gives prominence to the incentive 
of service. The school orchestra receives recognition 
for its helpfulness in furnishing music for entertain- 
ments, the glee club and the debating teams and the 
cooking club see their work reviewed with fitting 
acknowledgment.

Louis, which has a large number of student organizations.

Tue PsycHoLocGy oF THE MoDE OF WHOLESOME 
REPLETION 
The psychological explanation of the success of this 
mode, expecially in the high school, is that of youth’s 
response to a set of especially attractive stimuli, which 
flatter newly-awakened ambitions and emotions. The 
response of youth to the call of responsibility, whether 
confident or timid, gives a new consciousness of dignity 
and worth. Many will bear witness to the reforms 
that followed making a bad boy monitor of his row, 
or captain of his team, or leader in a debate. 
Similarly, the appeal of rite and ceremony is very 
strong. The instinct for complete and perfect form, 
for effective symbolism, and for beauty all unite to 
make young people delight in the picturesque and the 
formal. Social ceremony, which bores older people, 
is to them a new and fascinating kind of amusement. 
Pageants and tableaux delight them. 
The play’s the thing. 
With the development of the reasoning powers that 
comes with adolescence, there springs up in the minds 
of some young people a growing pleasure in their exer- 
cise. To such students geometry and physics offer 
realms well worth exploring, and debating is a battle 
royal with big prizes at stake. The keen joy of solving 
and proving a hard problem is not unlike that of the 
skater who cuts a perfect 8 upon the ice; one has made 
the ends of thought meet in a faultless line, through 
the magic of a well-mastered art. 
The joy of thinking is a revelation; the possibilities 
of thought startle the imagination. To such students, Ceremony

a wise teacher gives the greatest books he knows, 
realizing that it is almost impossible to overestimate 
the capacity for thought in an intellect so awakened. 
The brain is eager for work, the mind hungry for food, 
and a new consciousness of the meaningful world 
that lies about, translates, illustrates, and questions 
the words of books. That teacher does well, who, 
finding a boy who likes Emerson, gives him Kant; 
who introduces the lover of Shakespeare to Euripides. 
To know greatness will not turn a healthy boy into a 
mollycoddle, owing to the fact that incongruities do 
not worry us in youth as in maturer years. ‘‘Consist- 
ency is the hobgoblin of little minds” and of grown 
people. The boy who has just been discussing the 
theories of Mendel or the art of Sir Joshua is liable to 
turn around to shoot a paper wad at Washington’s 
plaster nose, without any care for the incongruity of 
his transfer of interest. Nevertheless, the free use of 
intellectual stimuli, the engaging of busy brains in 
big thoughts, does crowd out petty pleasures and silly 
occupations, and simplifies the problem of school-room 
order. 
But while a few students in every school are affected 
by strictly intellectual stimuli, all respond in greater 
or less degree to emotional ones. It is the emotional 
element in any study that gives it life, interest, appli- 
cation. History and literature are the two studies 
most rich in this content; civics, geography, compo- 
sition, and languages may be taught in a way to make 
their emotional worth felt. The beauty and mystery 
of personal relationships, of religious aspirations, and 
of the life of the great world, are open now to the com-
-P-A-G-E-69
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 51 
prehension of these growing boys and girls. They 
acquire the new knowledge frankly or secretly, rev- 
erently or flippantly, carefully or indifferently, accord- 
ing to their different dispositions and training. But 
their response to the emotional side of life, whatever 
their attitude toward it, is bound to influence their 
choice of interests, good or bad. It sends them to 
the best lectures and the worst picture-shows. It 
is the fundamental motive for a hundred things that 
look unemotional enough. The successful appeal of 
wholesome recreations, as of lessons themselves, de- 
pends largely upon the amount of this element that 
can be infused into the activity in question. 
A new emphasis on practical preparation for wage- 
earning is changing what has been an important extra- 
curricular feature in some schools, into a chief end and 
aim. This is that class of subjects of which the aim 
is to teach an art or a trade, or to help in the choice of 
a vocation. Making a strong appeal to ambition, 
these subjects have much influence, especially upon 
the older boys and girls, who are looking forward 
definitely to the life that lies beyond the school. It 
has led to the formation of high school clubs for the 
study of telegraphy, photography, sewing, cooking, 
millinery, ceramics, and cabinet-making. 
Association with one another tends to strengthen 
the hopes and define the plans of boys and girls who 
have similar ambitions. The existence of a club for 
the study of any art or science, moreover, calls atten- 
tion to it, and may be instrumental in “placing” 
some children in congenial employments, who other- 
wise would drift aimlessly or take up an occupation Ambition

  52 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
in which they would be doomed to constant discontent. 
There is inspiration in the very atmosphere of a school 
in which a majority of the students are vitally inter- 
ested in some hobby or specialty. There is much of 
that friendly clash of championship which sharpens 
wits and strengthens self-confidence. 
Most important of all, there is in the high school in 
which many clubs and societies exist, a chance for 
leadership for all. Domination is demoralizing when 
it is exercised by an immature youth, but wholesome 
leadership develops confidence, the sense of responsi- 
bility, ingenuity, tact, firmness, and patience. There 
is a chance for various talents to work out for public 
good, in the multiform activities of a well-clubbed 
high school. Even the shyest may be entrusted with 
the chairmanship of a committee or the preparation 
of a program, or set to keeping records or taught 
to preside over a meeting. Practically everyone else 
is doing something of the sort, which is logical proof to 
almost any child that he may do likewise. Super- 
vision will eliminate dangers, and every success gained 
is an encouragement to new efforts. The ambition 
aroused reacts to give new personal dignity and re- 
sponsiveness, which in their turn inhibit childish ten- 
dencies to bad order or to sheer frivolity. Thus this 
phase of the new order of school activities helps in the 
solution of the old, old problem of school discipline.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT (Continued) 
V. THE Mope oF SoctaLt CONSCIOUSNESS 
THE story of civilization is the record of the devel- 
opment of man’s social consciousness. As successively 5° 
larger groups have supplanted the individual, in man’s 
long struggle for existence and for abundance, more 
economical and beneficial ways of living, finer emotions, 
and bigger-planned enterprises have grown. Follow- 
ing the history of the race, each child born into the 
world may pass from a stage in which its own wants 
bound all the stimuli to action, to the highest pinnacle 
of unselfish effort for all society. From the standpoint 
of ethical training and of social efficiency, the most 
important function of the school is the part it plays 
in making the child’s social relations plain to him. 
But within the general end of clarifying to him his 
relations to the whole social body, and awakening a 
desire to serve that body, there is a consonant and con- 
tributing specific aim, which serves the immediate 
purpose of securing good school government. This 
is the aim of establishing a definite consciousness of 
each pupil’s place in the organic body of the school, 
that social institution in which, after the family, he 
is most deeply and naturally interested. This estab- 
lishing of social consciousness has begun, for the family

relation, long before the first day of the first grade; 
but as there is as yet no abstract conception to aid 
in carrying it over into a new sphere, the work must 
be freshly started for the new relation when the kinder- 
garten or primary school begins. The process is pro- 
gressive, variable, and unending. It goes on daily 
at every stage of formal education. All moral effort 
since schools began has consciously or unconsciously 
been directed toward its development. Its establish- 
ment is the fundamental condition for the mode of 
self-government under direction, which is the ideal 
sought. 
With this progressive clarification of social relations, 
the results of conduct agreeing with, or antagonistic 
to, those relations, must be taught. In the school- 
room, concrete illustrations of the gains and losses 
of social and unsocial conduct are numerous. The 
teacher’s great work is to call attention to them. 
When we do not whisper, the room is quiet, and we 
learn our lessons more quickly; then we all have more 
time for outdoor play, and home work is lessened or 
eliminated.’ When we have our own drinking cups, 
there is small chance of contagion from drinking; 
and with a regular and full attendance we may easily 
give a concert or a play that could not otherwise ‘be 
produced. Such statements of cause and effect seem 
so obvious to most grown people, that they feel a sense 
of foolish triteness in carefully recounting them to the 
children in their care. But they are really new knowl- 
edge at some point in the training of each child, and the 
risk of being bromidic is not to be compared to the risk 
of failing to establish that habit of thought — or that
-P-A-G-E-73
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 55 
useful set of easily-recalled platitudes, that passes for 
a habit of thought — which will insure in even the most 
self-centered a thrifty social spirit. 
The fostering care of the teacher should work through 
his social organization to the individual, as well as for 
the social organization through the individual. This 
is merely to say that the teacher must be a maker of 
public opinion in his kingdom. Several conventional 
understandings are necessary: {that people have a 
right to show their disapproval of behavior that in- 
terferes with their happiness or usefulness}- that it is 
the duty of the properly selected officers of society to 
punish wrongdoers; that people who want the greatest 
good to the greatest numbers are bound to help these 
authorities to find and punish offenders; and that 
isolation (denial of the advantages that come from 
social codperation) is a fit reward for the human being 
who abuses his social privileges. 
These four ideas, which once established will give 
the support of public opinion to any disciplinary meas- 
ures a teacher may find it necessary to take, can be 
taught best in the lower grades; and there is the place 
where they should be thoroughly drilled into con- 
sciousness. The third one is especially important 
and especially difficult to teach, owing to the perverted 
ideas of honor which have descended to us from our 
ancestors, trained to loyalty to a limited group. These 
medieval ideas seem to have found their last and most 
stubborn stronghold in our public schools, where not 
a few teachers aid and abet their perpetuation. Here 
again the consciousness of the organic nature of society 
is the fundamental need. We are all a part of the The results

judicial system, in some seen or unseen way; we are 
all vitally concerned in the punishment of wrong, in 
the protection of our rights and our institutions. Our 
own happiness and safety, consequently, are bound up 
in its success, in ways usually untraceable, but some- 
times so direct as to be apparent to the most thought- 
less. Every boy and girl in the school is to some 
extent responsible for its happiness, its order, its work. 
The exercise of that responsibility, when occasion 
demands, not only answers the immediate disciplinary 
need, but tends also to develop character in a whole- 
some way. 
SpecIAL Forms oF ScHOooL GOVERNMENT FOUNDED 
ON THE MODE OF SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS 
The ability to govern himself, to control his own 
actions with the good of both himself and his fellows 
in mind, is one of the ideals toward which the character- 
building of pupils is to be directed. Little by little, 
as they show themselves worthy of trust, the control 
of authority is withdrawn and self-control takes its 
place. There is much danger, in a society wherein 
democratic ideals prevail, that self-management be 
given before self-control has been gained. On the 
other hand, to withhold the right of decision when 
people are capable of exercising it intelligently is un- 
just and foolish, fatal to development, productive of 
discontent and violence. 
What society has as a complicated problem,— in 
the solution of which it blunders pitifully but bravely 
through every gradation of despotic repression and 
democratic license, working, we may hope, finally to
-P-A-G-E-75
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 57 
a satisfactory end,— the school, which is a little world, 
the microcosm of society, has also as its problem of 
the relative control of teacher and pupils. In an 
ideal school system, in which ideal pupils work to the 
highest end, each boy and girl at graduation would 
be a citizen of the world, capable of taking upon him- 
self all a citizen’s responsibilities. Our aim is, then, 
to bring each pupil as nearly as may be to the point 
of full self-control and purely ethical conduct by the 
time he is ready to leave the fostering of the school. 
To aid in realizing this ideal, there have sprung up 
during the last few years a number of systems of partial 
or complete pupil-government, by which the social 
responsibilities of pupils may be brought to their atten- 
tion, and practice given in their exercise. A consid- 
eration of the wisdom of the use of such schemes is 
given in a later chapter; at present, we shall consider 
the four types into which all the self-governing schemes 
now used may be divided. It will be noted that 
most of them have two features in common: the at- 
tempt to develop character through the imposing of 
responsibility, and the teaching of civics through prac- 
tice in the forms of government. In some, the latter 
feature is kept strictly subservient to the main object, 
which must always be that of increasing the spirit 
of social loyalty and obligation. In other types, much 
is made of the formal machinery which parallels that 
of city or state. 
Since responsibility comes both as a reward and as 
a stimulant to worthy behavior, it is important that its 
relation to each pupil’s conduct be clearly understood 
before teachers and pupils agree to live together under 
  Purpose

Four pupil-

  58 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
any formal scheme of so-called self-government. 
Every plan which has, so far, proved successful, seems 
to depend upon two things: thorough and continuous 
preparation of the pupils by training in ethics, and the 
guiding mind of some sane, powerful, and magnetic 
leader. Given these two requisites, however, the 
successful working of a school system is practically 
assured without the imposition of an elaborate system 
of pupil-government. Justice, kindness, and _ self- 
realization through self-activity will prevail where 
these two elements exist, as surely as in the most 
elaborate school-city or school-state. It is largely 
a question of the desirabliity of expending the neces- 
sary time and energy — usually a great deal. 
There seem to be four methods, each capable of 
much modification, by which teachers may avail 
themselves of the social instincts and ideals possessed 
by their pupils, to impose on the pupils themselves 
the responsibility of their own conduct, and at the 
same time to teach them their responsibility for others, 
in relation to the general body. If we consider them 
in the reverse order of their relative emphasis upon 
the formal and spectacular phases of this mode of 
government, the first type is that in which there is 
practically no imitation of civic forms, but in which 
the spirit of service to all is directed pretty thoroughly 
by teachers. This is pupil codperation with the modes 
of control set up by the school authorities. There 
may be a maximum of pupil responsibility here, but 
the nature of that responsibility is defined by those 
older than the pupils. It lacks the powerful stimulus 
of decision-making vested in the school body. Per-
-P-A-G-E-77
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 59 
sonal accountability is made much of; high ideals 
of honor in teachers and pupils are essential. A 
faculty of fine feeling and great dignity and power 
is the most helpful factor in making this mode a suc- 
cess, for unity of feeling and unusual personal influence 
must take the place of prescribed machinery. There 
is a strong loyalty between students and faculty, and 
a deal of popular devotion of both to the school. 
Obviously, all this requires a condition of things 
in general so nearly ideal that many principals despair 
of realizing it, and turn rather to methods whose 
greater novelty gives an initial impulse which carries 
a long way to success. No specific examples of schools 
thus managed need be given, for every well-managed 
and successful school which emphasizes social obliga- 
tion without adopting the special machinery of a 
civic organization, is working under the plan of pupil 
codperation with the teaching force. It is simply 
that method by which teachers and pupils work to- 
gether in sympathetic understanding of their common 
ends. 
A very successful type of so-called oa 
is that in which the pupils carry out the forms of civic fee eer 
life under the direct control of the teachers. Some’ faculty 
exercise of real judgment is allowed in the settlement eau 
of the innumerable small matters that require constant 
adjustment in every school, but always subject to 
definite restrictions by the school authorities. The 
system thus gives practice in the administration of 
law, but no real legislative or judicial powers. As a 
means of teaching civics, this scheme is usually very 
successful, while it affords an opportunity for a sort
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
of supervised habit-forming that is most valuable. 
But it undoubtedly requires as much or more energy 
on the part of teachers as a more direct form of govern- 
ment would require, so that its chief value lies in the 
habituation to forms of social conformity and the em- 
phasis on a socialized attitude, which it brings about. 
The An excellent example of this kind of supervised and 
sigrange —_Jimited self-government is to be found in the Lagrange 
School of Toledo, Ohio. Miss Brownlee, the former 
principal, under whom the system was begun, says 
of it: “It may be well to say that the Lagrange pupils 
do not govern the school. The teachers believe they 
are too lacking in experience and judgment to be self- 
governing. The idea is to develop a spirit of codpera- 
tion, to give them, so far as they are qualified, certain 
duties to a faithful performance of which they are 
rigidly held.” Nevertheless, the school is thoroughly 
organized as a school city, each room as a ward. The 
four upper grades form the voting population, and 
elections are held semi-annually. There is a mayor, 
a sanitary chief, a treasurer, and a city clerk, with in- 
spectors appointed by the sanitary chief, one for each 
two wards. The council thus formed notes conditions 
and reports to the principal, who communicates with 
the teachers interested. r 
On the surface, this Lagrange plan looks very like 
many other plans in which far more power is delegated 
to the pupils. But it does not give the essential res- 
ignation of power into the hands of the pupils, which 
characterizes such schemes where self-government is 
actual. Its successful working may largely be attrib- 
uted, as Miss Brownlee says, to the fact that prin-  
-P-A-G-E-79
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 61 
ciples of honor, self-control, kindness, and industry are 
taught in that school systematically. 
The sound principle of granting honors and respon} Actual 
sibilities as a reward for good conduct and faithful Teves 
service lies at the root of the Ray system, in use in thg’ a privilege

in all the grades, the two tribunes being appointed in 
the first two grades and elected in the rest. These 
tribunes, who have much real authority, wear a badge, 
and in many ways take the place of teachers. They 
settle disputes, look after halls and courts, direct the 
marching, listen to reports of offenses, take charge of 
the room when the teacher is not present, and protect 
the weak from imposition. All petty offenses are 
carried to them, and only the more serious ones are 
later referred to teachers. All the tribunes form a 
council, which appoints administrative officers. 
Not all the pupils are citizens in this little state. 
Half or more of each room from the fifth grade upward, 
as a reward for good scholarship and behavior, are 
granted citizenship, which is forfeited upon misbe- 
havior. Some are elected to citizenship, others are 
appointed by teachers. They have the liberty of 
the building, and may vote upon special questions that 
arise. It will be noticed that this system sets up an 
unusually powerful set of incentives to good conduct, 
to which the stock objection to such incentives (that 
they are artificial) can scarcely be urged. Sound 
principles underlie the various provisions. :

forms. In these systems the final authority is not the 
teaching body, but a set of rules which have been 
fashioned by the pupils themselves. Naturally, much 
teacher-influence goes into both the making and the 
maintenance of such schemes, but nominally there is 
a reign of law, administered by elected officers, inde- 
pendent of pedagogic ruling. 
A well-known example of the city-school type of 
pupil mutual government is that organized at School 
No. 3, Manhattan, New York City. The principle of 
reward of merit has recognition here in the granting 
of citizenship by charter to the upper four grades, and 
to individual pupils in the fourth grade, for good 
behavior. Disorder in the room endangers citizenship, 
which may be revoked by the principal. Each room 
is a borough, sending two aldermen to the Board, 
which passes laws subject to the mayor’s veto. The 
mayor, popularly elected, conducts the morning as- 
sembly and appoints the heads of the administrative 
departments. These include a police department, 
with a chief who appoints five squads, a health depart- 
ment which inspects rooms and persons, a savings 
department which conducts a school bank under the 
direction of a teacher, and an educational department 
to arrange for lectures and athletic events. There is 
besides a court, having three elected judges, and a 
jury if desired, with privilege of counsel. It tries 
cases and administers punishment. A city attorney 
and court clerk complete the list of officers. 
In the State Normal School at New Paltz, New York, 
there are three school cities, graded in respect of elab- 
oration of detail to suit the abilities of students in   
      
  
     
-P-A-G-E-81
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 63 
the normal, intermediate, and primary departments. 
Here, among the older students, much is done to teach 
political principles and practices. Conventions, elec- 
tions, and inaugurations are held, and political parties, 
the use of the recall, the initiative and referendum, 
taxes, and proportional representation, add interest 
and training value to the system. The administrative 
departments attend to the fire drill and all needful 
precautions, public works (including care of the flag, 
the school garden, election booths, school entertain- 
ments, and athletics,) health, and police service. 
There is a sheriff with appointed deputies. The 
faculty acts as a court of appeals, the principal pre- 
siding. 
In this special form of pupil-government, it will be 
observed, there is opportunity for much dramatizing 
of the work in civics. Dramatization is an especially 
vivid method of presenting any subject, and its use 
in a scheme for developing an ideal of self-control 
may justify all the energy which goes into the building 
up of these elaborate play-governments. 
Another type of pupil-government is modeled after 
the state rather than the municipality. The best- 
known example is the famous George Junior Republic 
at Freeville, New York. This is a school for city 
waifs, founded by Mr. William R. George. The 
citizens during part of their time at this school, are 
engaged in profitable work in field and workshop, by 
which the school is partially supported. The boys

elect a police force, executive officers, and a legislature, 
which makes laws for the community. Law-enforce- 
ment is strict and impartial, the penalties being very 
real ones, such as detention in jail and the paying of 
fines. The whole government, in fact, is far from being 
a pretense; it exercises all the functions of a state. 
The boys in this institution, however, are boys whose 
experiences have enabled them prematurely to assume 
the responsibilities of men in almost every way. They 
are the little men who have made their own way almost 
from babyhood, and managed their own affairs from the 
time they were able to walk. The trust imposed in 
them, and the opportunities for exercising their abil- 
ities in a wholesome way, appeal to the best in their 
natures. The girls, who have their own round of 
duties, are also girls from the city slums, to whom 
trust and kindness are new and powerful elements 
in the general scheme of things. The necessity of in- 
dustry is a real one, as living expenses are paid from the 
wages received for labor, furnished to all the citizens. 
A special coinage, current only in the Republic, is used. 
The laws are made by the legislature, and enforced 
by the officers elected by the citizens. Mr. and 
Mrs. George, while they were in charge at Freeport, 
assisted with the inspection of work, and exercised 
a kindly supervision of work and play. The school, 
which has an attendance of 250 in summer, has been 
instrumental in effecting the reform of a number of 
its citizens. The power of Mr. George, back of the 
authority of the government of the children themselves, 
was of course unquestioned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 65 
The adaptation of state government used in the High 
School at Warren, Pennsylvania, is probably more jj 
helpfully suggestive to the average school! Pupil 
government was adopted here in 1890, and is still 
being used with satisfaction. All students are citizens, 
the governing body being a senate, eligibility to which 
depends upon good scholarship and deportment. Sena- 
tors and faculty members report misdemeanors to the 
principal, who in turn reports them to the senate. The 
senate acts as a court, inflicting the lighter punish- 
ments and making recommendations to the faculty in 
the more serious cases. All offenses in connection with 
examinations are dealt with by the faculty. Teachers, 
however, do not belong to the governing board. 
Other forms of actual student-government are not 
modeled after the forms of either city or state organi- 
zation. 
At the Thirtieth Street Intermediate School, Los 
Angeles, California, there are two committees, of boys 
and girls respectively, who are held responsible for the 
conduct of pupils while out of classrooms. These 
committees are composed of representatives from class- 
rooms, thus forming councils of boys and girls, which 
discuss conditions and make rules. There is a presi- 
dent for each council, also a vice-president and secre- 
tary; these executives appoint from the membership 
of the councils, yard, basement, and hall committees. 
Each council has a judge elected by the whole school, 
who hears cases affecting the common weal. 
At the Polytechnic High School of the same city, 
there exists an elaborate system (elaborate because of

the large size and varied interests of the school) which 
combines in an unusual degree the socializing elements 
of the High School with a workable scheme of student 
control. As in the Thirtieth Street School, the elected 
representatives for boys and for girls manage affairs 
in their respective spheres separately, a mode evi- 
dently more in favor in the West than in the Eastern 
andzMiddle states. The central committees are elected 
as follows: One from the Bg, one from the Ag, and 
two each from the Bio, Aro, Bir, A11, B12, A12; and 
one from the post-graduate classes. The president is 
elected by the students in general and appoints as 
active members of the committee elected by the various 
classes, from five to eight more students who have 
served previously on the committee, or who are recog- 
nized as students who will be an addition to the 
committee. 
Each of these central self-government committees is 
divided into the following sub-committees: an execu- 
tive committee, whose’ duty it is to meet once a week 
and hear and judge cases of students who are referred 
to it by members of the faculty or by students. They 
have power to act in all cases, even to recommending 
suspension to the principal. They keep a detention 
room where students who have been sentenced to serve 
hours are expected to remain. The president of the 
self-government committee usually acts as chairman 
of the executive committee. The yard committee 
has charge of conditions in the yard during the noon 
hour and all other free periods. The desk committee 
has a student at the desk every hour of the day from 
eight o’clock in the morning until four in the afternoon
-P-A-G-E-85
  
MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 67 
to pass upon all cases of tardiness either to the building 
or to recitation and to issue slips which admit to class- 
rooms — white slips for excused tardiness and blue 
slips for unexcused — and to keep a record of all 
excuses. The building committee of three goes over the 
building on an average of once a week and reports to 
the office any writing or other defacement which should 
be removed. The school bounds committee ‘inter- 
views students who are leaving the grounds, with a 
view to the regulation of this privilege. 
The entire self-government committee meets upon 
call from the office to discuss questions of general school 
interest. The members of this committee discuss 
these questions with the boys in the different class- 
rooms and at time of meeting — on call from the office 
— give to the office the benefit of the discussion so 
held. When decisions have been reached by the office 
and self-government committee, the members again 
discuss the matter with the different classrooms and 
tell the students of the decisions reached. 
The entire business of the school is under the manage- 
ment of a board of control, composed of two teachers 
and eight students, one from each class. A teacher 
acts as treasurer, and a book-keeper is elected by the 
board, whose president, vice-president, and secretary, 
however, are elected by the students at large. Lunch- 
room management, business management of athletics, 
the business affairs of the school publications, and of 
all school entertainments are directly under the control 
of this body. All expenditures for the school except 
the salaries and cost of repairs, and all moneys received 
by the school, which during the year amount to between Articulation

._ The school clubs of all kinds are welded into a body 
capable of united action by the Associated Student 
Body Organizations, to which the presidents belong, 
and of which the principal is chief adviser. ‘The senior 
class elects the editor and manager of the school paper. 
Members from each room, headed by a captain elected 
by the school, compose the fire brigade, which con- 
ducts the fire drills. The manager of the lunch room 
is elected monthly by the board of control, while the 
principal appoints a committee to aid in the recovery of 
lost articles. The athletic committee consists of student 
representatives from the board of control, scholarship 
committee, and boys’ self-government divisions, with 
one appointed by the principal, and three teachers 
elected by the faculty. An unusual feature is the 
scholarship committee, made up of ten boys and ten 
girls appointed by the faculty, grouped under two 
chairmen elected by the students. Under the guid- 
ance of this committee, able students help those who 
need help, and deficient students are forced to give 
extra time to their work until it is satisfactory. Weekly 
reports must be made to the committee by failing 
students until the work is made up. The committee 
even directs that work shall be dropped when students 
are overscheduled, and decides when failing students 
shall be dismissed from school. This method of mutual 
helpfulness and supervision has proved successful in 
keeping the scholarship standard on a high plane, 
through the activity of those whose approval means 
most to the boys and girls — their own schoolmates.

MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 69 
The foregoing outline of pupil-government schemes 
shows the ways in which children may be organized 
to promote their own administrative ability. What 
the systems teach, however, is never so much self-gov- 
ernment as the government of others. Such systems 
develop an extraordinary degree of skill in manage- 
ment, a maturity and quickness of judgment in children 
which would scarcely have been thought possible a 
generation ago. By finding work for all, moreover, 
they doubtless prevent a great deal of the mischief 
that springs from idleness; and by imposing responsi- 
bility upon the more active pupils they hold them to a 
loyalty to the system which turns their energies into 
wholesome channels. There are, however, numberless 
practical objections to such schemes, most of them 
phases of the almost inevitably bad results of imposing 
an essentially artificial condition upon any group of 
people. The test of self-government lies not in the 
ability to carry out an elaborate scheme, made pictur- 
esque by the trappings of maturity, and appealingly 
baited with honors and distinctions; but in doing daily 
the real, fundamental work of school life, each pupil 
frankly in his place as a learner, an apprentice still, 
but gaining constantly the power to do the thing that 
his teachers require, with less and less of their imme- 
diate help. 
The fact that these plans for utilizing the social con- 
sciousness of students do not involve real self-govern- 
ment to any great extent, however, is not in itself a 
conclusive argument against them; for self-govern- 
ment is an attainment that may be gained by many 
paths, and is not to be secured by wholesale or by any What is 
really gained

magic formula of management. The crucial test for 
pupil-government schemes is whether they afford a 
more sure or economical means for reaching self-govern- 
ment than do the older plans of government by regu- 
larly instituted authorities. 
On the part of the teaching force there is not a clear 
case in favor of pupil government. It must not be 
forgotten that, for the successful examples given, there 
are many failures, which do not appear in the educa- 
tional journals but which have their effect upon our 
educational history. It would be foolish to condemn 
it in those cases in which teachers of strong personality 
have felt that this form of government supplied just 
the incentive needed in their particular schools. As 
a temporary expedient, it has perhaps justified itself; 
at least there are not wanting schools in which it has 
been tried and abandoned, but in which a higher 
plane of honor and responsibility has been maintained 
after the experiment than before it. It is noticeable 
that it has gained most spectacular success where con- 
ditions are not normal, as in large city school systems 
subject to the influence of unhealthy surroundings. 
The adoption of the elaborate artificiality of school 
states, cities, committee systems, and the like, may 
sometimes be the question-begging compromise of 
teachers who are not quite able to arouse the requisite 
interest and ideals in connection with the school’s 
regular work. Hampered by the artificiality of tra- 
ditional schoolroom customs, they add another artifici- 
ality seven times worse, in the hope of enlisting the 
support of pupils by making them accomplices in the 
situation. Rather than attack the fundamental evil,
-P-A-G-E-89
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT qI 
which is lack of respect for law (which, it is true, is so 
prevalent that children learn it at home and on the 
street faster than it can be corrected at school) they 
bribe their pupils to support.this law by identifying 
them with it. 
To a very old-fashioned person, the result seems to 
be an attitude of easy condescension toward all stand- 
ards of right and wrong. He who makes the law is 
greater than the law, obviously; he who obeys is less 
than the law. Is it wise for young children to learn, 
by daily practice, that law is a thing created by them- 
selves, subject to change if a majority of them wish it? 
In times perhaps gone by, children had an idea that 
rules of right and wrong came from a higher power 
— from parents, from teachers, from elected represen- 
tatives in congresses assembled, ultimately from God 
Himself. If the old idea of the superiority of the law 
over the wishes of individuals, the old reverence for 
law as a controlling power, could be preserved or re- 
vived, might it not be better than the newer idea that 
law is but the collective wish of one’s peers? 
To recapitulate: The duty of each pupil so to order 
his actions as to conserve the good of all his associates, 
may be so impressed upon children as to affect their 
behavior for good. It is the highest of all motives for 
good behavior, depending upon the will for realization, 
and approximating the motives of social behavior in 
grown people in the world at large. Four systems of 
pupil-government based upon this mode are used: 
1. That of pupil codperation with teachers, in which 
self-government is allowed to individual pupils as they 
show themselves worthy or as conditions allow, but in As it 
affects the 
conception 
of law

accordance with regulations made by the teaching 
authority. 
2. That in which the teachers reserve all control, 
but permit the pupils to help in the administration 
of the school under the forms of some unit of civil 
government. 
3: That in which real self-government is granted to 
such pupils as have earned it by good behavior. 
4. That in which all the pupils of the school have a 
real voice in the school management and control. 
In a number of instances these schemes of pupil gov- 
ernment have proved workable and highly successful. 
But true self-government may be developed without 
them, and it is doubtful if the elaborate dramatiza- 
tion of the forms of civil government is a necessary 
means of teaching the duties of citizenship. The 
ultimate decision of all school matters should lie with 
adults, and with adults who have studied school ques- 
tions carefully and in their many bearings — in a word, 
with teachers. 
SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTERS ON MODES OF 
CONTROL 
The earliest mode of. school government was that 
based on force, which demanded that the teacher’s 
authority be regarded, without appeal to any motive 
of pleasure or gain on the part of the pupil. 
To this was added a milder mode in which the teacher 
used his personal influence in persuading the pupil to 
follow directions. 
Pupils may also refrain from evil and do good through 
interest in their own advantage and advancement.
-P-A-G-E-91
  MODES OF SCHOOL GOVERNMENT 73 
A fourth mode of great practical use is that of filling 
the life of the pupil so full of wholesome interests that 
those antagonistic to good school discipline are crowded 
out. 
The highest motive for which pupils can be trained 
to “be good” is that of contributing to the well-being 
and happiness of the whole school. Teachers can so 
guide their pupils that the lower of these motives will 
give way to successively higher ones, and in this way 
establish the better modes as fully as possible.

  CHAPTER V 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN AMERICAN LIFE AS THEY 
AFFECT THE QUESTION OF SCHOOL DISCIPLINE 
One’s best excuse for attempting to enumerate the 
characteristics of our national life which have helped 
to change school discipline, lies in the mutually re- 
troactive nature of those influences and of school 
discipline. By seeing clearly what forces have operated 
to change so thoroughly the nature of school control 
_and management, we may to some extent judge how 
“far that change is a wholesome and a hopeful one, and 
also perhaps predict the effect of our altered methods 
upon the life of our people. 
The most direct and obvious influence, as has often 
been pointed out, is doubtless the feminization of the 
teaching force. The condition is a new one. Never 
before in the world’s history were schools given over 
as they are now in America to women teachers. Pos- 
sessed of a natural sympathy with children not so 
generally characteristic of men, used to securing their 
ends by diplomacy rather than by force, responding 
more or less adequately to a constantly-preached ideal 
in which soft voice, gentle manner, and angelic patience 
are important ingredients, women inevitably fell short 
of the Squeers standard of discipline, and early de- 
veloped a teaching manner of their own. Frontier
-P-A-G-E-93
HOW AMERICAN LIFE AFFECTS DISCIPLINE 75 
schools, demanding a teacher capable of administering 
a drubbing to the overgrown backwoods boys who 
attended them, rejected the woman teacher. But 
westward expansion was on the side of the school- 
ma’am, for when there were not masters enough to 
teach the schools in the old way, the public was forced 
to accept education at the hands of those who could 
teach only in the new. The greater needs and greater 
rewards in other fields for many years kept first-class 
men largely out of the profession of teaching; and the 
alert, energetic, responsibility-seeking American woman 
stepped into the breach. She has done her work well, 
and in bringing both her strength and her weaknesses 
into the schoolroom has exerted a determining influence 
upon educational methods. Probably her innate and 
ineradicable preference for the methods of persuasion 
has done more than any other one thing to discoun- 
tenance harshness in American school management. 
Another great influence is a diffused and indirect 
one which may be summed up in what is popularly 
known as the Doctrine of Interest. The enrichment 
of content which has come to all the subjects in our 
school courses, the conscious effort to make the school 
work appeal to the present interests of the pupils — 
the idea, in short, of making school a part of life, and a 
pleasant part too — this movement has had a marked 
effect in changing the attitude, and consequently the 
behavior, of children in school. It has by no means 
solved the problem of discipline, as some rose-be- 
spectacled theorizers would have us believe: but it 
has immensely simplified it. It has changed a prison 
to a House of Life. It has revealed to children, where Interest and

formerly they trod a hard path blindly, beauties by 
the wayside, and a far, fair country to be won at the 
journey’s end. It has transformed slave-drivers into 
friends, and masters into elder brothers. It has 
unlocked with magic keys doors that were once fast 
closed; and broken down the barrier that once sepa- 
rated the interests of children from the interests of 
the great world. For now, even in the beginning of 
his days at school, the child realizes that his life has 
elements in common with the lives of countless people 
whom he never sees, and that new wonders, new ties, 
and new responsibilites are to be shown him as he goes 
on. School is a Friendly World. He has no cause to 
know that injured resentment which lay at the root of 
a large part of the insubordination of our fathers’ days. 
Who wants to fight his best friend? Who wants to 
spoil tomorrow’s fun? 
Toleration is a much-lauded trait which has its ait 
and its bad side. It has developed wholesomely into 
healthy ideas of the equality of the rights of men, into 
kindly sympathy with the unfortunate, into a surer 
sense of justice toward all, including those who oppose 
our interests or our views. It shows itself pathologi- 
cally in a weak-kneed reluctance to interfere with those 
whose ways transgress the rights of others or threaten 
destruction to themselves. It permits a militant indi- 
vidualism that out-Rousseaus Rousseau. It hesitates 
ignominiously before the remedy of controlling the 
actions of those plainly unfit or unwilling to contribute 
to the social good. It endures inconvenience, lack of 
progress, and actual vice, because of a mistaken code 
which pays respect to things which are not respectable.
-P-A-G-E-95
  HOW AMERICAN LIFE AFFECTS DISCIPLINE 77 
Two widespread and wholesome outgrowths of the 
spirit of toleration are democracy and altruism. (De- 
mocracy, too many-shaded a word ever safely to be 
said without definition, is used in the sense of equality 
of opportunity for all.) The feeling for equal oppor- 
tunity and equal rights, which grew almost into the 
semblance of a national religion with the westward 
expansion following the War of 1812, and which has 
never wholly lost that exalted aspect, has given its 
share to the change in methods of school discipline. 
It was as incompatible with that fine reverence paid 
the teacher in German schools, as was the American 
master’s limited training and uncertain social position. 
It made it impracticable for the schoolmaster to be a 
monarch; for no man, however kingly, could exercise 
kingly prerogatives over a roomful of pupils toward 
whom one of his chief duties was the exposition of the 
Spirit of ’76. Denied by the logic of his position more 
arbitrary methods, the American schoolmaster, and 
more particularly the American schoolmistress, has 
developed in a wonderful way a kind of relation between 
teacher and pupils which is a new thing in the world. 
It is, moreover, a very fine thing, embodying more of 
the ideal spirit of education than ever appeared in the 
schools of the past. It premises a friendly leadership, 
appealing to the interests and ambitions of the pupils, 
developing in its best phases a sense of honor, of no- 
blesse oblige, almost unique, by conceding their essential 
equality. This spirit grew up for the most part in the 
West, an instinctive and wise response to the situation 
in a new and over-lusty country, and had become a

gave to the schools that solid backing which they now 
generally enjoy. The combination of the two, the re- 
enforcement of friendly leadership by unquestioned au- 
thority, gives an ideal condition for effective school 
discipline. 
The altruistic and socializing tendencies of today 
have worked in numberless ways to modify school dis- 
cipline. The doctrines of Froebel, long accepted in 
theory, must wait before their full realization for a 
more general acceptance of social rather than individu- 
alistic motives. But the study of social ideals, exten- 
sively carried on by teachers, will find expression in the 
daily conduct of their classrooms. That children are 
social beings, to be developed under social influences, 
employing social relationships, and destined for social 
service, must inevitably introduce into schoolroom 
practice an element of codperation once undreamed of. 
In these days when vocational education looms so 
large, it is hard to realize that the cultural ideal is really 
growing in American schools, and influencing methods 
of control. It is true that the school systems brought 
from Europe by our ancestors were originally intended 
only for the children of the well-to-do. But it was the 
deliberate purpose of our forebears to adapt them to 
the needs of all the children of all the people, and this 
end has been largely accomplished. To use the schools 
for the practical training of children for their future 
vocations is no new ideal in America; it is only the 
efficiency that approximates realization which is new. 
From the first, the Western frontiersman sent his boy 
to school that he might get on in the world when he 
grew up; and his girl, that she might teach at first,
-P-A-G-E-97
  HOW AMERICAN LIFE AFFECTS DISCIPLINE 79 
thus proving her ability to take care of herself, and 
later that she might “marry well.”’ The purposes of 
our schools were frankly utilitarian in the West, where 
most things, in fact, had to show a utilitarian reason 
for being in order to survive. The rapidly advancing 
frontier had small patience with the purely ornamental, 
and small understanding of the finer esthetic and 
spiritual aspects of life. Appreciation of these things 
came, as they always have on the earth, with the 
assurance of provision for material needs. 
As an older type of civilization has replaced the 
conditions of the frontier in America, cultural ideals, 
without replacing utilitarian ones, have come to take 
their place with them. The decay of interest in the 
classics does not disprove this. A large proportion of 
the classical students of an earlier day were ministerial 
aspirants; Latin and Greek were part of their pro- 
fessional equipment. With students of law and medi- 
cine, they studied the classics for the same purpose 
that today sends an agricultural student to the chemical 
laboratory. In a large majority of cases the desire 
for culture was a secondary motive where it existed 
at all. But the agricultural student now takes three 
or four years’ work in English, and that avowedly 
mainly for its cultural value. Slowly, steadily, stand- 
ards of culture are rising in the country as a whole, as 
any observant man past his fiftieth year will bear 
witness. 
This growth of the cultural ideal, which does not 
supplant but does supplement the lately-stimulated 
and increasingly-realized vocational ideal of school 
usefulness, is exercising its own good influence on When Latin

methods of school discipline. We are importing, with 
other once despised British institutions, the ideal of 
those English public schools which aim to “make 
gentlemen” of the boys who attend them. Manners 
and morals are taught more and more. The bully, 
be he teacher or pupil, is a passing factor. He has 
had his day. A better ideal of manliness has rid the 
schoolroom of his presence; a higher state of culture 
has reacted to discountenance him. And his methods 
have gone with him — a good riddance. 
All the change in disciplinary methods is registered, 
for the justification of optimists, in ways that he who 
runs may read. It is patent in the sometimes foolish 
legislation against corporal punishment, a thorough- 
going reaction often productive of more harm than 
good. It shows in the attitude of the public, in that 
of educational bodies, and in the press. It has helped 
to establish special schools for incorrigibles and ab- 
normal children, where severe treatment may be 
administered when advisable without demoralizing 
effects upon normal children. Above all, it is supply- 
ing courses which have an intrinsic appeal, to children 
who respond naturally and eagerly to this new ‘‘square 
deal.”

CHAPTER VI 
THE PRESCRIPTION OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES 
OnE who is not a psychological expert approaches 
the question of the reality of discipline with a diffidence 
appropriate to those traditional spots whereupon angels 
fear to tread, and where trespass may call down upon 
one the proverbial alternative appellation. Upon the 
battlefield of Formal Discipline many a wise man has 
met defeat; and many a teacher, confident of his 
ground because of his own unscientific observations 
and the traditions of his cult, has been appalled and 
discomfited by the learned. For the warning of the 
wise be it said, therefore, that the conclusions in this 
chapter are based, truly or falsely as the case may 
hereafter be shown to be, upon the author’s under- 
standing of the probable facts as to the reality of 
formal discipline. These facts can not be said to be 
definitely established, although supported by some 
fairly conclusive experiments and an immense popular 
conviction, growing from common experience and 
tradition. There is, of course, much scientific data 
to support an opposing opinion, and the whole question 
is in a condition of flux which precludes finality in the 
stating of conclusions.

theory of prescriptive discipline may be based is as The formal

follows: From a multitude of duplicated or similar 
experiences, a rationalized generalization or ideal is 
Jinally crystallized in the mind, from which new applica- 
tions are readily made to suit new situations in which 
there are easily recognized similar elements. The transfer 
of habit is not a direct one, but is practically sure if 
the disciplinary series has been thoroughly followed 
and its generalization secured by thoughtful considera- 
tion. A concrete illustration of this is the process of 
training children to a considerate, silence in rooms in 
which other people are giving close attention to study 
or instruction. A child is trained to refrain from 
talking in school, and also in church; but unless he 
has, beside this concrete training, been led to abstract 
the general principle that wherever people are doing 
something that requires quiet for concentrated thought 
or reverent attention, others should yield them that 
quiet, he may disturb readers in a library until forced 
by others to stop talking. The boy who is corrected 
for throwing snowballs and paper-wads, and stops, 
but thinks himself blameless if he throws green apples 
instead, has not been led to generalize from his specific 
experiences.* 
A disciplinary activity is any activity in which one 
_~engages, not primarily for its own sake or the sake of 
its immediate outcome, but for a desirable subjective 
~ effect — that is, for the training value it may have 
upon one’s self. Since people are most easily influenced

bibliography in an appendix.
-P-A-G-E-101
  DISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES 83 
during the formative period of childhood, disciplinary 
activities are peculiarly valuable before maturity 
brings fixed habits and fundamental training has been @ 
acquired. Grown people, as well as thoughtful and 
earnest children, often make disciplinary requirements 
of themselves, that they may attain some end which 
they see to be desirable. But all young children, and 
a majority of older children and grown people, have 
neither the conception of their need nor the power of 
volition to choose for themselves the disciplinary activ-- 
ities which will contribute to their training. For all 
such, the forces of social authority prescribe disciplinary 
activities, justifying their course by the end of social 
advance, and exacting obedience to their requirement 
by whatever force it may be necessary to use. 
The prescription of disciplinary activities begins in 
babyhood and extends throughout the formative 
period. It is a universal law of social life, in fact, and 
to deny it is essential anarchy. In a majority of cases 
the demands of authority find ready response from 
children, for they are eager to have new experiences, 
full of curiosity, and anxious to please where kindness 
is shown. But where response is reluctant, there the 
prescription is still imperative. A mother, trying to 
teach her child to eat his bread-and-milk with a spoon, 
does not give up her requirement because the baby 
prefers to use his fingers; nor does the teacher yield 
to a boy’s desire to go on playing ball when the school- 
bell rings for lessons; nor does the policeman permit 
a tipsy cowboy to shoot his revolver into the air on the 
main street of a town, even when that street is empty 
of traffic. No immediate harm is done by any one of Illustrations

these acts, but the children will never learn table- 
manners or lessons if permitted to follow their own 
wills, and the cowboy must be taught to respect the 
desire of men to feel safe from stray bullets. 
Discipline is a word of many applications. Mental 
discipline, that doctrine beloved of the older educators, 
that blanket justification for unlimited courses in 
mathematics and languages which could find excuse in 
neither pleasure nor use, is still far from being an ex- 
ploded theory. Frowned upon by psychologists and 
grudgingly tolerated by practical experimenters, it 
still flaunts a triumphant tenure of popular belief in 
the faces of its enemies. A sort of universal intuition 
stands by it, and advises a suspension of sentence 
until a more advanced psychology may render de- 
cision. Meantime, its direct bearing on questions of 
school discipline is yearly becoming less, as curricula 
approximate more nearly a fulfilment of immediate 
and undisputed demands. 
The_great function of prescription is to make easy 
the forming of good habits. Habit-forming is by far 
the greatest part of elementary education. Reading, 
writing, numbers, singing, memorization of all sorts, 
manners, the skilful and graceful management of the 
body, cleanliness, orderliness — all are habits. They 
are acquired largely through prescription. Curiosity 
and the desire to excel, love of motion and instinctive 
imitation, all play their good parts in this pleasant 
drama of development, but prescription must be 
the prompter, and see that the play goes on when 
the actors forget their lines or refuse to carry on the 
“business.”
-P-A-G-E-103
  DISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES 85 
Unselfishness may become so thorough a habit that 
it ceases to be a virtue. If this condition of things 
were general we should be ushering in a millennium, 
but it is really rather rare as yet among individuals. 
Both as a virtue and as a habit, however, it must be 
suggested to the self-centered child, and when volun- 
tary response fails, it should be prescribed. Consid- 
eration for others is not a superfluous virtue, but a 
duty. ‘Only those acts of kindness which come from 
a willing heart are truly virtuous” is a false sentiment. 
The most virtuous acts include those wrung from an 
unwilling heart by stern self-discipline or the authority 
of others. Consideration for others should find ac- 
knowledgment and appreciation, but it should also be 
expected and required. Lovely indeed is the child 
who loves to divide his candy among his brothers and 
sisters, but if he does not he may be required to, and 
so helped to form a specific habit of unselfishness. It 
is not claimed, of course, that these specific habits form 
general habits directly; but that their practice makes 
it easy to form other habits which grow out of general 
ideas easily formulated by the child to whom con- 
sideration has become habitual. 
Race EXPERIENCE AND ITS CRYSTALLIZATION 
IN PRESCRIPTION 
Every father decides his boy’s problems largely in 
the light of his own experience. He wishes his son to 
do what he did, if he imagines that those things helped 
him; or plans to enable his boy to avoid them, if he 
thinks they stood in his own way. So a group of 
men of similar experiences will prescribe for their sons Prescription 
of social 
aims
-P-A-G-E-104

those things which their joint experience dictates as 
wise. A man of influence and distinction, to whose 
opinions ordinary men defer, will probably think that 
the processes and experiences which made him a man 
of eminence, are most helpful to others. So Aristotle, 
founding a new school whose success was largely due 
to his use of the syllogism, prescribed syllogisms for 
others, and such was his authority that the youth of 
centuries were trained to reason in syllogisms when 
they should have learned to plow, to see, and to think.? 
In general, this is the history of curricula. The men 
of any given era rise to a certain accomplishment 
through hard experience and effort, and some one of 
them or a group of them crystallizes the typical ex- 
perience by which the highest attainment of their 
time and class has been reached, in a prescribed course 
of study for youth. This is adopted, usually after 
some delay. Once adopted, it becomes entrenched 
in tradition, and only when its inadequacy becomes 
apparent to even the most careless, is it changed 
by a new leader or group of leaders to a new set of 
requirements. 
Such conflicts between the established order and 
the insurgents in education have occurred more than 
once. The Renaissance in its stimulus to the studies 
of the humanities is the most notable example. There 
is such a conflict today, and the effect upon education 
and civilization promises to be no less far-reaching. 
Two distinct elements may be discerned in the 
present conflict with the conventional school program. 
There is, first, the conflict of individual experience, 
1 Aristotle, The Organon.
-P-A-G-E-105
  DISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES 87 
and its resultant conception of need, with the pre- 
scribed course. This is rife among the people, both 
parents and children. The children can not see how 
all the things they are called upon to study are going 
to be of use to them in the future, or pleasant at the 
time. They may seek the interest that lessons lack in 
illegitimate fun, or find a sweet revenge in unlawful 
deeds. Finally, when the call of more alluring in- 
terests and the compulsory age limit coincide, they 
leave school altogether. Parents, who find that the 
schools give their children no direct training for the 
work they are to do in the world, add their objections. 
Moreover, the most advanced educators agree with 
the common people that the old prescriptive courses 
are inadequate. Such men acknowledge that the claim 
of the child and his parent is well founded; but they 
go farther, and looking into the future, say that radical 
changes must be made if the school is to play its part 
faithfully in the world. Such men are usually those 
for whom the schools, in the days when they trained 
the intellect almost exclusively, were well suited as a 
means of development. They are not those whose 
personal ends conflict with the conventional program. 
But, with a previsionary and constructive conception 
of a new social order, they have a new conception of 
the need which the schools exist to satisfy. They 
join the number of those who demand that schools 
prescribe and furnish new studies to suit the specific 
needs of their pupils. 
The prescription of courses, then, while justifiable 
and necessary, is at present mistaken in many of its 
applications, and results in waste and loss. Teachers The revolt

face the task of readjusting requirements. Their 
work is to select from the whole mass of experience 
and knowledge that has accumulated in the world, 
not those experiences and that knowledge that served 
a past generation best, but what will be most valuable 
to the children now growing up. Teachers are the 
race-givers, the almoners of humanity in its largess to 
its children. 
But prescription by others is at best but a temporary 
expedient, one great aim of education being to develop 
the child to the point where he will select his own. 
As children grow older, also, the proportion of ac- 
tivities of a strictly disciplinary nature grows less and 
less, while those with a direct, obvious, immediately 
desirable outcome increase. When shall the child 
begin to choose his own? When shall the teacher 
cease to select and prescribe, and confine himself to 
teaching what the child elects to learn? Clearly, the 
arts and knowledge which ordinary intercourse de- 
mands, must be acquired, whether the pupil wants 
them at the time or not. Reading, writing, the use of 
the language, useful computations, and a reasonable 
knowledge of geography, civics, and history are neces- 
sary foundations that good citizenship, irrespective of 
vocation or position, requires. 
Beyond that, the prescription of specific pursuits 
may be limited to a choice of means to an end chosen 
by the pupil, if the pupil is ready or able to make his 
choice. But if neither necessity nor interest dictate 
an immediate specialization, common sense suggests 
that a general course, which has a maximum of points 
of contact with various special fields, offers the best
-P-A-G-E-107
  
  DISCIPLINARY ACTIVITIES 89 
work for the student until he is ready to choose his 
own work. Those subjects which aim to supply 
universal needs are to be prescribed, the prescription 
ending at the point of departure for the elected field of 
special endeavor, which may or may not be immedi- 
ately upon acquiring the educational fundamentals. 
The bearing of all this upon the question of discipline 
in its narrower sense of the good order of the school 
is twofold. It predicates the right of the teacher or 
other school authorities to prescribe whatever in the 
way of behavior may be necessary for the good of the 
pupils and of the school; and it indicates what some 
of those requirements may be. All the three varieties 
of prescriptive activities, giving mental, habitual, and 
altruistic discipline, suggest what is to be required of 
pupils. The list given below is not at all exhaustive, 
nor are all its items applicable to all schools or at all 
times. It would be very foolish to require, for instance, 
silence and a comparatively fixed bodily position in a 
class at bench-work. : 
The prescription of whatever makes for the de- 
velopment of all-round social efficiency, both in and 
beyond the school, is included among those phases of 
training which are universally needed and universal 
in their application. Whatever else may be included 
or excluded in making out the school program of any 
child, this must be regarded as its first, its most neces- 
sary feature — that training which will develop hinr 
as a social being, codperating willingly with the forces 
that make for social unity and progress. With this in 
mind, we may sum up the desired outcome of disci- 
plinary prescription for conduct as follows:

SUMMARY 
There is probably no direct transfer of habits or 
skills; but from many concrete examples a principle 
may be abstracted, which is readily applied to a new 
situation in which there are elements similar to those 
already met. Using this as a basis for accepting the 
possibility of discipline, we may engage in any kind of 
disciplinary activity that will train manners, mind, 
hand, and heart. It is the duty of maturity and ex- 
perience to prescribe for children those activities 
which seem best calculated to develop them most wisely 
and fully; and to force them, if necessary, to follow the 
course of training thus laid down for them. It is soft 
pedagogy and foolish indulgence which seeks to avoid 
this duty. The natural desires and tastes of children
-P-A-G-E-109

are not necessarily a true index to what they should 
do. All children, whether they want to or not, should 
be made to acquire the arts and information and moral 
qualities which will make them useful and valuable 
citizens, if by any means these can be imparted to 
them. 
The prescription of educational activities for children 
is based on the experience of man in the past, and may 
not always be suited to the needs of the present or the 
future. Children and their parents object to present 
requirements because they do not fulfil their immediate 
wishes or needs; far-sighted thinkers understand that 
they are inadequate for the needs of both present and 
future. We are at present in the midst of a readjust- 
ment of prescription, a remaking of curriculums. 
The object of prescription by others is to develop 
the individual to the point at which he may wisely 
decide for himself what he should do to gain his ends. 
When the pupil in school has reached this point 
the teacher should abdicate his power in favor of the 
pupil’s self-government. Prescription for conduct (the 
phase of prescription which directly affects discipline) 
aims to develop self-control, consideration for others, 
unselfishness, and definite ethical standards. Prescription

THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS . 
THE word discipline is used in ways so various that 
it is necessary to define one’s use of it in any given 
discussion. In its widest application it covers the 
field of all training activities whose end is not the 
immediate result attained, but that of strengthening 
some ability, perhaps quite different from the special 
phase of ability exercised. {When used thus with the 
end of training abilities not directly involved in the 
activities in question, it is known as Formal Discipline, 
and has been the bone of a notable amount of conten- 
tion as to whether it exists or not. Used in its most 
narrow sense, on the other hand, Discipline refers to’ 
specific corrective measures for infringements of definite 
points of school law or custom. )In this book, gen- 
erally, its use lies between these two extremes, and 
indicates any and all measures for the better conduct 
of the school with reference to the order and behavior 
of his pupils. It does not apply, except indirectly and 
by association, to questions of scholarship, save where 
such application is especially noted. 
The first requisite for really successful discipline is 
that it be conceived in both its positive and its negative; 
and in its constructive and its reconstructive aspects. 
Virtue has been for a long time considered chiefly in

the hearts of men: As we find goodness taking on 
new values when seen in its entirety, so also discipline, 
which is the process of developing goodness, finds new — 
values when seen in its completeness. (The teacher’s 
part is not only to inhibit evil, but to boid a 1 up ten- 
denciés to the right response to “sting a ideals

ing to the making of strong, normal, got d-boys: and 
girls. | This is the disciplinary process. 
Since every objective act is first a subjective act — 
that is, since everything that we can see, hear, or do 
must first be thought out in some one’s mind—the f first 
step in the disciplinary process is to form_an ideal of 
good conduct. It must exist first in the mind of the 
teacher, who later works. out-his-idéal by adapting his 
own-and-his pupils’ activities to that end. The ade- 
quate ideal is the result of observation and of construc- 
tive combination, That is,’the best ideal of school 
conduct is made by seeing good conduct in many 
schools, and then putting together the elements which 
will fit best the needs in the particular school which 
the teacher has in mind in constructing his ideal, 
Good conduct in a manual training school and ina 
classical school are probably two very different kinds 
of behavior, for behavior should be suited to the 
ends sought and the means used. The ideal of many 
teachers is one of observation only, a copy of the con- 
duct of the schools with which they are acquainted. 
If they have attended poor schools, or schools whose 
methods and aims are different from those over which

they are to preside, the ideal will be a poor one, 
and their efforts are probably foredoomed to failure. 
They should add to the pictures of school-conduct 
which their experience has given them, new pictures 
of thei» own construction, based upon the needs and 
aims of their own school, and those to be had from 
schools of recognized merit. 
Visiting This is not an easy thing for young and untrained 
eos minds to do, and probably even the best thinkers among 
teachers depend for their ideals of conduct chiefly on 
observation and experience. The importance, then, of 
visiting well-managed schoolrooms is apparent; and 
also the advantage of taking careful notes upon the 
details of management, the little devices for reducing 
noise and confusion and for making work pleasant and 
interesting. Then the teacher who is forming an ideal 
for his own use must adapt the good ideas he has 
gained to the situation in his school, building up a 
vivid picture of the orderly conduct of every exercise 
that enters into its work. ‘He must not be content with 
a hazy idea of how things should be; his ideal must be 
definite, and as an aid to this it is advisable to write 
it out. 
The ideal Having thus created an ideal of good conduct in his 
pean own mind, the teacher’s next-step-in-the- disciplinary” — 
minds process is to induce his pupils to share it with him, that 
they may work with him toward its realization, This 
step may be called Establishing the Ideal, to distin- 
guish it from the first step of Creating the Ideal. 
There are four means of establishing an ideal of con- 
duct in the minds of pupils, not to be used separately 
or in sequence, but constantly, simultaneously, and in 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS 95 
numberless ways and combinations. The one in most 
. constant use by the best teachers is that of assuming 
that pupils are in thorough sympathy with the teacher’s 
wishes and plans, and are anxious to do everything they 
can to make the school a success. The power of sug- 
gestion is used to strengthen the hold of the ideal. 
“No hint of the possibility of disobedience or other evil 
action comes from the teacher; she recognizes evil only 
when it actually appears before her, demanding correc- 
tion. In this way an atmosphere of unity is created 
which gives the ideal a good chance of realization. 
When, however, pupils do not fall in readily with 
the plans made for them, suggestion and, assumption 
must give way to more definite means. ( The teacher 
finds it necessary then to state clearly just what is 
expected, and sometimes it is wise to keep this expecta- 
tion before the pupils pretty constantly for some time, 
that they may adopt it in its proper form — and not 
in some vague misconception of their own — into their 
conscious scheme of conduct.) ‘ For instance, the teacher 
of a country school found that her pupils were in the 
habit of walking into the schoolroom with muddy 
boots and shoes, thus covering the floor with an un- 
sightly mass of dirt within a few moments after school 
had opened in the morning. She secured a thick mat 
and directed them to wipe their feet upon it as they 
entered. They did this cheerfully, but gave to each 
foot so perfunctory a wipe that the floor was ih almost 
as poor a condition as before. Noting the virtuous 
complacency with which they carried out her request,. 
the teacher decided that the trouble lay in their inade- 
quate ideal of cleanliness. She thereupon made her Assumption

ideal very clear by tacking up a little card over the 
door-mat. It read: 
Wipe your feet until there is no more 
mud to come off. The floor under your 
desk should not show even one muddy 
streak. Can you do as well as that? 
The pupils made an attempt to meet her require- 
ments, and soon became interested in keeping the floor 
about their desks clean and neat. About the middle 
of the winter term the teacher took down the card, and 
found that the habit of cleanliness was established. 
Her ideal had become the ideal of her pupils, after she 
had made it too definite and clear to be ignored. 
(A third way of establishing the ideal is to correlate 
it ‘with other ideals already established.) The teacher 
who taught her pupils to wipe their feet before enter- 
ing the schoolroom, for instance, might have con- 
nected her ideal for a schoolroom floor with the ideal 
for a parlor floor which their mothers had taught them 
at home. All of the children in such a school had 
probably been taught to have a care for the floor of 
the “best room’; and the schoolroom is the “best 
room” of the school. An ideal once established be- 
comes a norm by which new ideals are measured and 
judged. Johnny thinks it reasonable to conform to 
the request that he should not whisper in school, be- 
cause he has already been taught that he must not 
whisper in church. Marie has learned that eating in 
school interferes with good work and is a breach of 
manners, and when her teacher tells her that gum- 
chewing is just as bad, she believes her, because there

THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS 97 
is a similarity between the two acts that she can see. 
Analogies appeal strongly to children. ‘‘You wouldn’t 
think of doing that in church,” and ‘Would your 
mother allow you to act in that way at home?” 
are cogent reasons with children. The correlation of 
specific requirements works toward a more conscious 
generalization, by which finally definite principles of 
duty may be developed. That the same obligations 
of courtesy, gentleness, purity, and unselfishness hold 
in school, home, playground, and street; that we owe 
respect and consideration to all, equally, without regard 
to station or possessions; and that good conduct is not 
to be changed because there is no one to see and give 
it credit— these are truths that the correlation of 
conduct-ideals will tend to establish. 
(A fourth and very effective means of establishing 
the ideal is by illustration. )( Children learn best by 
means of concrete examples; and every instance of good 
conduct, of the right response to a given situation, that 
can be brought to a child’s notice, becomes a prece- 
dent for future action.) The teacher who is trying to 
form good street-manners, for instance, not only 
explains to her pupils the correct usage, but selects 
a few of the brightest and best-bred children to illus- 
trate it. They play at taking a walk, and learn to 
greet and salute each other courteously when they 
meet. One boy hobbles along as a feeble old man, and 
is helped over a crossing by a strong and clear-sighted 
boy. An old woman spills a bag of apples on the side- 
walk, whereupon two little girls gather them up and 
restore them to her. A stranger inquires the way to 
a public building, and is directed by three boys who Illustration

leave their marbles to help him. Little folk like this 
sort of dramatization, which makes the ideal of conduct 
vivid and therefore impressive; and are able to repro- 
duce the actual motions that they have seen, when 
they have not the initiative to formulate a response 
for themselves. The action is reduced to a mechani- 
cal formula so far as its physical phase is concerned, 
thus making the subsequent habit-forming immensely 
easier. 
y The third step in the disciplinary process is Realiz- 
“ing the Ideal. In this final step of realization, which is © 
of course the determining element in the condition of 
the school, there are combined the efforts of both pupil 
and teacher. ~The pupil contributes inclination and 
will, the teacher a knowledge of ways and means. 
And since conduct is so largely pure habit, the greater 
part of his direction is nothing but a supervision of 
habit-forming. This process, with its complemental 
one of habit-breaking, has been thoroughly described 
in many books, but may be repeated here, since no 
repetition can ever over-emphasize the importance of 
this fundamental process in education. 
Instinct is the $starting-point in habit-building, 
although many habits are only an artificial inhibition 
of instinct. Instinct brings about certain movements, 
which, being satisfactory, are repeated. For instance, 
the little boy’s curiosity leads him to watch the growth 
of a colored picture on the blackboard, and from the 
instinctive attention which he gives at first, the teacher 
develops a habit of attention to whatever is placed 
1 Bagley, Educative Process, p. 214; Perry, Management of a 
City School, p. 247.
-P-A-G-E-117
THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS 99 
upon the board. The act which instinct has initiated 
becomes easier with each repetition, until it becomes 
automatic, and a habit is established. The secret of 
the transition from the instinctive response to a stimu- 
lus, to a real habit, is the pleasure of tke first and subse- 
quent responses. If a response gives pleasure, it is 
repeated. If it gives pain, it is avoided. The 
significance! of this law to the teacher is, of course, 
that he may so control conditions that the instinc- 
tive responses to stimuli in the schoolroom have 
pleasant or painful consequences, according to the 
desirability or non-desirability of the habits thai 
result. ’ 
A child on his first day at school has a pencil, which 
was given him to use when all the pupils had their 
writing exercise. When the pencils are gathered up, 
however, his acquisitive instinct prompts him to cling 
to his; he wants to take it home. An inexperienced 
teacher, anxious to please the child and avoid an 
unpleasant scene, might let him take the pencil home, 
but a wiser one expresses her disapproval or even dis- 
pleasure, and insists on its return to the box. The 
unpleasant effect of the teacher’s disapproval tends to 
inhibit the desire to take the pencil home, and to give 
the instinct of imitation, by which he puts his pencil 
where the other children have put theirs, a chance to 
function. If the teacher rewards his initial act with 
approval, he will repeat it for the same approval, until 
he has formed a habit of conformity with regard to 
pencils. 
Later, habits develop themselves by combination 
into other habits, often directed by new instincts that

appear from time to time. The fundamental instincts 
continue to give motives for new adjustments and new 
habits. Teachers must know what these instincts are 
and how to use them, for there is never a time when 
habit becomes entirely distinct from its instinctive 
basis, or when helpful instincts may not be utilized to 
supplant the responses whose resultant habits are bad. 
Instincts have been classified as egoistic, social, moral, 
esthetic, and intellectual. Professor E. A. Kirk- 
patrick! classifies them as self-preservative, parental, 
social, adaptive (curiosity, imitation, play),, regula- 
tive (referring to duty), and a set of miscellaneous 
instincts which include those of construction and 
expression, rhythm and migration. : 
The knowledge of instincts gives one an inventory 
of possible means of initiating habits. The .actual 
process of habit-building, as analyzed by modern psy- 
chologists, falls into these successive steps on the part 
of the teacher: 
1. Clarification of the ideal —.giving the child to 
understand exactly, clearly,, just what is expected of 
him. 
2. Securing thoughtful, conscious repetitions of the 
act that is to be made a habit.) Dr. Bagley especially 
insists upon the aftentive repetition, which he shows 
to be necessary where the habit to be taught is in 
opposition to natural tendencies — that is, to instinct, 
to the line of least resistance.” 
3. Permitting no exceptions until the habit has be- 
come automatic. 
~1 Fundamentals of Child-Study, pp. 51-63.

-P-A-G-E-119
  THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IOL 
4. Repeating the drill at ever-lengthening intervals 
until there can be no question of the establishment of 
the habit. // 
The shibboleth, of success lies in the third of these 
steps. Here is where teachers fail. They become tired, 
or change their minds, or decide that they have been 
too strict when children complain of the standard set. 
Even those who understand the importance of persist- 
ence are sometimes prevented from keeping up the 
effort by a pressure of work. Some indulgent mother 
says “unsympathetic,” and the requirement is weak- 
ened or withdrawn. A lazy boy insists that he can’t, 
and the foolish teacher believes him, or at least washes 
his hands of the responsibility of making him. But 
the really sympathetic teacher is he who foresees the 
demands that will be made upon his pupils in their 
maturity, and prepares them for that trial. He may 
be Spartan in method, for perseverance and unbend- 
ing loyalty to the ideal require a sacrifice of present 
pleasure to future gain. . 
The examples of failure at this point are numberless; 
they account for probably the great majority of dis- 
ciplinary breakdowns that are the teacher’s fault. A 
teacher directs that there be no whispering during a 
recitation, but ignores the whispered inquiry of the 
star pupil rather than interrupt a good recitation. 
The demand was probably unwise, but not nearly so 
much so as the permitted exception. He says that 
there is to be no pushing in the line when school is 
dismissed, but being tired at four o’clock winks at the 
offense of the boy who punches his classmate in front 
of him as he reaches the door. He tries to teach his Exceptions

pupils to say “there is not” rather than “there ain’t,” 
and “I saw” rather than “TI seen,”’ but draws the line 
at interrupting a fluent oral composition to substitute 
the good form for the bad. Possibly the spirit and 
pleasure of the recitation are worth more than the 
grammar of the speaker; but it is certain that gram- 
matical forms will never be learned unless the teacher 
puts them first, concentrates upon them, until they are 
mastered. 
This drill work should be done as far as is possible 
in the lower grades, where the process need not be 
doubled — that is, where bad habits need not be un- 
learned in addition to the formation of good ones, 
The process of ‘“‘breaking” habits is one that is called 
into requisition almost constantly, however, owing to 
the lack of uniformity and excellence in our school 
standards. Children are allowed to do some things in 
the fond supposition that they are permissible acts, 
which a teacher with higher standards can not think 
of permitting. The habit already fixed must be 
replaced by another. The process is similar to that 
of learning a habit where no conflicting usage exists, 
except that consciousness must be more alive and 
attentive at the point of actual substitution. There 
is first the forcible presentation of the new ideal of 
conduct. Then the thoughtful, attentive beginning 
of the new habit, with the guiding authority and 
remembrance of the teacher constantly at hand to 
prevent lapses, or to secure an unpleasant result if 
lapses occur. Third, the continuation of the active 
process until it is really complete — until an excep- 
tionless habit is fixed.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
  THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS 103 
The methods of preventing the exceptions that 
undermine the good work and mar its effectiveness are 
based upon the psychological law that unpleasant con- 
sequences tend to prevent the repetition of any given 
act. Usually it is not enough simply to remind a 
child that he has forgotten; the results of forgetting 
must be made painful, so that there is a real reaction 
from the forbidden act. Here, then, is a use for punish- 
ment, a place where it has a very real and necessary 
function. There needs to be a painful association 
established with the forbidden act, an association 
which must come, as a rule, ex machina from: the 
teacher. 
A boy who had been under the care of a governess 
was put into the public school. He was a bright boy 
and had a good disposition, but his training was, of 
course, faulty on the side of socialization. He could 
not break himself of the habit of speaking aloud when- 
ever he thought of something he wanted to say, for he 
had of course had this privilege with his governess. 
Finding after a few days that the school atmosphere 
and customs in themselves did not effect a change of 
habit, his teacher explained to him the standard of the 
school in this respect and the reasons for it, with much 
emphasis upon its advantages to everybody. She 
called his attention to the value of the self-control 
that was developed by conformity to this standard, 
so that the boy saw that there was something to be 
gained for himself as well as for the school. This 
was done in a well-planned private talk, for no one 
else in the school needed just that guidance at that 
time. It would have been embarrassing and unfair Preventing

  Enlisting the child T04 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
to have taken time from a class exercise for so long and 
personal an interview. The private talk has great 
value in giving to the coming effort the importance 
that will give it a strong send-off, an initiation of suf- 
ficient force to carry it well on its way. This boy felt, 
after the talk, that he was undertaking an enterprise 
of importance. It was to be his chief business in life 
for a time to effect the good habit that the teacher 
required of him. He was told that he must think of 
it constantly when he was in the schoolroom, and 
encouraged further to emphasize it by keeping a record 
of his progress, to be reported nightly both to his 
teacher and to his father, whose interest the teacher 
secured by telling him of the work to be done. 
Where children are thoughtful and sincerely anxious 
to conquer bad habits, a penalty for lapses may be 
arranged with them. They may agree that giving up 
ten minutes of some favorite recreation every time the 
sequence of the good habit is broken, will help them; 
or that they will not be candidates for team positions 
if they forget more than a reasonable number of times. 
The process of habit-forming becomes in such cases 
an absorbing game, with every condition in favor of 
progress. Unfortunately, many children are not dis- 
posed to help in their own regeneration in this delight- 
ful fashion. They are stupid, selfish, lazy, misled at 
home or by their associates, or otherwise unable con- 
sciously to codperate, thus throwing the responsibility 
more heavily upon the teacher. Even in such cases, 
with his knowledge of the unchanging laws of habit 
as his strong ally, the teacher is able to accomplish 
results. He must see to it that the effects of each lapse
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS 105 
from the new standard are unpleasant enough to tend 
toward inhibition. The checks used may range all 
the way from a slight reproof before the class to isola- 
tion, withdrawing the privilege of recitation, suspension 
from a school office or honor, or even corporal punish- 
ment in extreme cases. Two characteristics they must 
always have; they must be sure and they must be 
immediate. An uncorrected lapse grows strong and 
multiplies itself. 
The boy who spoke aloud had had so little practice 
in self-control of this kind that the teacher felt surer 
of results in keeping the management of penalties in 
her own hands. She adopted the method of making 
him stand for ten minutes each time he spoke aloud 
without permission. This reminded him forcibly of 
his lapse, and carried with it an unpleasant conscious- 
ness of the more or less scornful and amused regard of 
his schoolmates. Old habit was stronger than the dis- 
comfort of this scrutiny, however. He grew used to 
the position, and after a few days it became tolerable, 
then a joke. By a process of accommodation, not 
uncommon, the oft-repeated disgrace ceased to be a 
disgrace, and so ceased to be a deterrent. Whereas 
at first he rose slowly when bidden and stood with 
shamed eyes glued to a book, he later reached the 
point where he jumped up promptly after one of his 
breaches of the law and grinned cheerfully at his friends, 
including the teacher, as he took what had ceased to 
be a punishment. Seeing this, the astute instructor 
changed the treatment. She adopted the opposite 
course, and instead of making him conspicuous in the 
schoolroom, eliminated him from it. He was given a

desk in her office, where he sat for a half-day after each 
offense. As the association with other children after 
a rather lonely little boyhood was the greatest charm 
of the public school to this particular child, this punish- 
ment was very effective and quickly gained results. 
It had to be administered only three times, with one 
repetition a fortnight later than the rest, to break the 
bad habit and establish thorough self-control so far as 
talking in school was concerned. 
Good behavior is not altogether a matter of habit, 
Ithough habit is by far the greatest part of it. There 
come to all pupils occasions when a decision must be 
made for which they can call up no precedent. Here 
a judgment must take the place of an habitual response 
to a usual situation. Even in this case, of course, the 
mental attitudes and processes that decide the answer 
given are largely habitual; but in a narrow sense the 
decision is new. With no previous experience to guide 
him in making his decision, the tempted boy must fall 
back upon some general principle or else blindly follow 
. instinct. If general principles in the form of axioms . 
have not been given him, and so drilled into conscious- 
ness that they come readily to mind in dn emergency, 
instinct, always with us, directs the decision. The 
instinctive response is rarely the best one, and so a 
point is lost for good conduct. 
To obviate this danger teachers, parents, clergymen, 
and children’s writers seek to instill moral prejudices 
and ideals. All morals-and-manners instruction has 
the double purpose of providing ready-made responses 
to the situations that may be foreseen, and guiding 
principles for the decisions that no foresight can safely

predicate. The situations of a student’s everyday life 
at school may be pretty accurately provided for by a 
wideawake administration; but even if every one 
could be met by the appropriate habit, the problems 
which face students when they leave school and enter 
new environments would have no guarantee of wise 
solution without some more general provision. Strong 
moral prejudices against evil, strong convictions of 
duty, give a basis for the right kind of judgment. 
Practice in making judgments under a supervision that 
restrains action from unwise ones, develops courage 
and confidence in their ability to decide the questions 
that come to students. A country boy, transplanted 
to a school in a crowded district of New York, was 
adopted by a city gang badly in need of recruits, and 
introduced to metropolitan ways. Two of the leaders, 
as a special favor, showed him some tiny white tablets 
which, they said, would make him feel better than he 
had ever felt. The country boy had never heard of 
heroin, and had no idea of the danger involved in taking 
the tablets. But as he weighed the advantages of 
conformity with his instinctive hesitation to eat some- 
thing new and strange, there came to him an axiom, 
repeated to the point of triteness by the teacher of his 
old country school: 
“Don’t do anything you are not sure is right.” 
The injunction, coming readily to mind because it 
had been so thoroughly drilled into his consciousness, 
saved him from making a great mistake. Without it, 
he would have yielded to the instinctive desire to 
receive the approbation of his new friends. The

   The disciplinary process is the establishing and 
realizing of an adequate ideal of right conduct. The 
ideal must exist first in the teacher’s mind, then in the 
minds of her pupils. Teacher and pupils codperate 
in bringing about the realization of the ideal, which 
involves the processes of creating good habits and 
curing bad ones, and of establishing standards that will 
enable pupils to make the right decisions when new 
situations are presented to them, for response to which 
they have no precedent. Punishment is an aid to good 
discipline when used to discourage wrong responses to 
“stimuli and so to build up good habits.

  CHAPTER VIII 
THE SPIRIT OF THE SCHOOL 
THERE is a subtle spiritual essence of all that goes on 
in a school, both in the minds of teacher and pupils 
and in every open and hidden act, which may never 
be exactly described or analyzed, but which the most 
inexperienced observer feels when he enters a school- 
_ room, and which gives to those used to comparison 
and judgment of schools a very fair index of what is 
going on there. It is called the school spirit, and so 
potent is it that it has been known to change the 
whole attitude and behavior of a student transferred 
from one school to another, in an incredibly short time. 
It is the teacher’s best friend or his worst enemy. No 
consideration of discipline could possibly ignore its 
importance in fixing the status of the teacher and his 
wishes, and the success attained by the school. 
(The spirit of the school is the atmosphere produced giements 
by the combination of the attitudes of the people who eat 
compose and influence it—the teacher first of all, spirit— 
- then the pupils, the parents, and the community, aie 
The condition of the environment also has much to 
do with it. A popular fallacy exists to the effect that 
the teacher alone is responsible for success or failure; 
and many a teacher has borne praise or blame —usually 
_ blame — for conditions for which he was not chiefly,
-P-A-G-E-128
  In the 
pupils 
In parents IIo DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
if at all, responsible! In the teacher, the most impor- 
tant element is the attitude in which he approaches 
his work. Then his natural ability, his preparation 
(which gives confidence because of knowledge, trained 
perceptions, sympathy, and appreciation), his happi- 
ness in his work, and his fitness for the special place 
in which he finds himself, all enter into the making of 
the atmosphere of his schoolroom. The last point 
is one of special importance. Many teachers are partial 
failures because they are misplaced. Moved from the 
country to town, from town to country, from primary 
to grammar grade, from the charge of a room to special 
work, teachers who are dragging out a conscientious 
martyrdom would become really happy in their work. 
Add to these his ability to codperate, his social con- 
sciousness, and the elements that make up the teacher’s 
schoolroom personality are fairly included. 
“Among the pupils, respect for the teacher is the 
first element which contributes to a good school spirit. 
Then comes respect for the rights of other pupils, a 
real happiness in the work done, good training in habits 
which fix ideas of propriety and ideals of conduct, 
and a distinctly formulated aim in each pupil’s mind, 
emphasizing the real object of the school, the purpose 
for which he is there at all.” 
Thorough respect for the school and codperation 
with it are the elements contributed by parents. When 
extended throughout the community there is a sol- 
idarity of purpose concerning the school which reacts 
upon all who work in or attend it. ‘School spirit” 
1 For an entertaining comment on this fallacy, see Mary C. 
Robinson, “‘ Which Class?” in the Atlantic Monthly, February, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
THE SPIRIT OF THE SCHOOL III 
is present in that community, and school progress is 
bound to come there. A district or town or city 
that knows its schools and is proud of them, that 
turns out to school elections and to parents’ clubs 
and last-day programs, furnishes the spiritual en- 
vironment in which schools flourish and bring forth 
good fruit, a hundred-fold. 
The influence of physical environment upon the 
spirit of the school is incalculable. Self-respect and 
order, industry and courtesy, are very hard to foster 
in a tumble-down building or a dreary school yard. 
Districts or villages that have poor schools should 
clean up, paint over, plant out, and spend some money 
for new furniture and books. Teachers who can not 
arouse a real interest in their work should inaugurate 
a campaign of expenditure. People become vastly 
interested in a short time in things in which they have 
invested their money. If a teacher can induce the 
school board to spend enough money to arouse the 
ire of the richest farmer in the vicinity, and then set 
himself to prove that every dollar has been wisely 
spent and is returning big profits, he will have no 
reason to complain of lack of interest in his school. 
If the board will not or can not spend the amounts 
needed, let the pupils and teacher set to work to earn 
them; the coédperation involved will often begin a 
new order of friendly zeal in school things that the 
new treasures can scarcely improve. 
The environment should be, first of all, neat and 
clean. There should be no weeds harbored in the 
school yard, there should be good walks to the front 
door and to all out-buildings, scrapers at the entrances, The school

and mats and brushes that dust and mud may be 
kept out of the study-room. A full cleaning-outfit is 
essential, and yet there are many country schools 
whose sole equipment is one broom and a duster fur- 
nished by the teacher. The vacuum cleaning system 
now to be had should be installed in every new build- 
ing erected, as it not only cleans more thoroughly than 
any broom or brush can, but also raises no cloud of 
dust to settle on furniture or fill the lungs. 
Certain facilities for orderliness are next in impor- 
tance. These include such things as _glass-covered 
book-cases, stands for dictionaries and globes, boxes 
or cupboards for all working paraphernalia, and cases 
for umbrellas, rubbers, and lunch-baskets, or individual 
lockers in larger schools. The old-fashioned double 
seats, a formidable cause of bad order, are still to be 
found in many country and village schools. Up-to- 
date drinking arrangements, separate cloak-rooms 
for boys and girls, adequate toilet facilities, and room 
to carry on school work without crowding, are all 
helps to the content and smooth-running of the school, 
that make for a happy school spirit. 
Children can not be happy and contented unless 
they are comfortable. Cold feet and hands, ill fitting 
seats, and long formal exercises that tire the body 
unduly, produce an irritability that may easily show 
itself in fretful outbreaks or uncontrollable restlessness. 
Bad light, and above all bad air, are also responsible 
for a lack of good feeling, for unhappiness and dis- 
content. 
Mere comfort, moreover, is not enough. The school 
environment should be really beautiful. To the initial 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
THE SPIRIT OF THE SCHOOL 113 
requirements of cleanliness, order, and comfort should 
be added the charm of soft color, of lovely form and 
proportion in the school building and furniture, and 
the helpful suggestions of beautiful pictures and casts. 
Such beauty has a refining influence that nothing else 
can supply, and the pride in lovely things possessed in 
common is a strong tie between the members of the 
school. Children respond to beauty with reverent 
delight, sometimes when other means fail to arouse 
them. 
These elements — characteristics of teacher, pupils, 
parents, the community at large, and the physical 
environment — all help to determine what the school 
spirit shall be. Let us now consider the ideal school 
spirit, that vivifying force which transcends rule and 
custom and makes of the pupil-teacher relationship 
a delight and an inspiration. 
A fine school spirit is, like all fine results of patient 
labor, like all seemingly fortuitous gifts of sheer talent, 
far too subtle and complex a thing for accurate, cold- 
bloodéd analysis. It is a contagious infection, to be 
caught and carried in a happy moment, after many 
weeks, perhaps, have been vainly spent in trying to 
win it. It may come as a spontaneous reward for the 
fulfilling of conditions, as a rare song-bird chooses that 
garden for his home wherein is a bird-house built ready 
for him. It may grow slowly, supplanting old pre- 
judices reluctantly surrendered, old notions that die 
hard; or come quickly, like a flower that wants only 
warmth and moisture to hasten bloom. However 
it may come, this is to be remembered; it is not, for 
all its rare power to turn school drudgery into delight,   
Its prac- 
ticability

a chance gift from the gods, but a reward for straight 
thinking and earnest effort, a state of mind to be 
explained by definite psychological laws, a result of 
certain conditions that may be attained and controlled. 
There is nothing mystic and nothing fatalistic about 
it. Some teachers have a “knack” for attaining it 
quickly and with little effort, others must make a care- 
ful study of conditions and means before they can 
compass this end; but all earnest and big-hearted 
teachers may win it, and find in its presence the sub- 
tlest and ablest ally that teacher ever had. 
Downright kindness, amiability, the desire to please 
and help, is the sime qua non for a good school spirit. 
No taskmaster teacher, setting himself sternly to secure 
a given requirement from his pupils, can hope to achieve 
the happiness in work that is its secret. He needs all 
the pride and pleasure that comes to the true enthu- 
siast in any profession who has chosen his work wisely 
and pursued it earnestly. Then he needs considera- 
tion for others, quick sympathy and eager helpfulness. 
He must have love for his work, for his pupils, for all 
mankind. Teaching is a work that takes hold on all 
the multiform life of the world by all the tentacles 
thrust out by each pupil taught. It reaches out pre- 
hensile fingers of relationship into far and unknown 
regions, achieving a spiritual unity with unseen and 
unguessable phases of living. Far more potent than 
press or pulpit, teaching sends out, at four o’clock on 
five days of the week, its thousands upon thousands 
of unconscious emissaries, to take an active part in 
moulding the life of the world. They carry with them 
the sensitive reactions of spirits impressionable to the

treatment they have received, the spirit of the men and 
women who have had them in charge through the 
working day. Can any teacher refuse such a respon- 
sibility? Can any teacher tolerate pettiness, time- 
serving, prejudice, superficiality, when the cry of the 
world may be answered so helpfully through the chil- 
dren? Even where stern measures must be adopted, 
the spirit of love and helpfulness bears witness of itself. 
It can never be mistaken where it exists. 
But the spirit of friendly helpfulness must be found A mischiev- 
also among the pupils, and among a working majority °™* ger 
of them at that, if it is materially to dominate the 
methods and results. A very common maxim is 
that, since love begets love, pupils will invariably 
respond to the friendly and helpful spirit of a teacher 
with a friendly and docile attitude. This is not true. 
It is usually true, but there are cases where outside 
influences, adverse to the spirit of love, are stronger 
than that of a teacher. A really sincere and able 
teacher, indeed, may labor for years in a community 
without being able to produce a general social spirit, 
although his efforts may bring forth fruit in individual 
cases. But a spirit of love and helpfulness requires 
that the influential majority of any group agree in 
their attitudes. The influences of street and home and 
religion, or rather of religious teachings, have their 
part in determining the spirit of the school, as well 
as the attitude of the teacher. Given favorable con- 
ditions in these respects, the achievement of the object 
sought is easily within the teacher’s power. 
A good school spirit is also a spirit of earnest, hard The spirit 
work. It recognizes a goal for the efforts of each, aoe 
 
-P-A-G-E-134

and sets out for that goal in sober earnest. The guide 
for this journey of achievement accepts no shoddy 
work, permits no flimsy excuses; his requirements are 
inexorable and his standards high. It is worth while 
to work under these conditions, with the knowledge 
that what is done is done with a purpose, is appreciated, 
is nicely appraised. The school is a factory! which 
produces ability and power as other factories produce 
doors and chairs and garments. But it is better than 
a factory, for the workers keep all they produce. They 
are capitalists, not hired workmen. 
A lively conception of the bigness of the task is the 
greatest help in the development of a work-spirit in 
the school. The years of training are so few, the time 
so short, the need so great; the demands of life so 
varied, the opportunities so without number, and 
competition so keen — how can all the preparation 
needed be crowded into the limited years of school 
life? If any vision of the possibilities that lie beyond 
them can be given to little children, if any adequate 
idea of the rewards of effort, they will work to achieve 
the ends they see. In other words, motivation is the 
keynote of the industrial hum. Give incentives, and 
you receive back earnest work. Arouse the imagina- 
tion by picturing the prizes to be gained, and the will 
is stimulated to attain them. The wondrous improve- 
ment noted in school spirit and codperation where 
manual training, agriculture, and household science 
have been introduced into schools, is due chiefly to 
the fact that where before the connection between 
studies and future welfare had to be taken on faith in

the wisdom of their elders, it is now patent to the mind 
of even the most sluggish. There is something ‘‘in 
sight” to be worked for. For those who think more 
abstractly or have work of another sort in mind for 
themselves, the new subjects have no such helpful 
influence. But in general it may be said that the 
spirit of work is the mental habit of holding the future 
above the present. 
The habit of ready obedience gives unity and smooth- Obedience 
ness to all the working of the school. It depends 
largely upon the wisdom and tact of the teacher, who 
must give practice and reasonable directions if they 
are to be followed without question. Children obey 
a beloved teacher willingly, and one who is not beloved 
with at least a sense of justice and the reasonableness 
of conformity, if his demands are sensible and, to 
their thinking, justifiable. Parental and social in- 
fluence has much to do with the existence of the spirit. 
Above all, if possible, there should be a spirit of Joy 
joy in work and play. Just pure happiness, the pleasure 
of doing a good thing well and then entering with zest 
into the fun that is childhood’s inheritance and right, 
is a real object to be gained. Joy is the normal con- 
dition of childhood and youth, and is the mother, 
as Goethe says, of all the virtues.! All the lovely 
colors and beautiful forms that our schoolrooms and 
school premises should boast, contribute to it. All 
the games and tasks of childhood and the sports and 
ambitions of adolescence should be tuned to it. To 
those to whom privation, or the lack of love and sym- 
pathy at home have decreed an unhappy childhood,

  The fear of

the school, which is a second home that all may share, 
brings joy as it brings care and thoughtful guidance. 
It is properly a part of the life of the organization, 
one of its objects and aims. 
There is a Puritanic distrust of pleasure, happily 
or unhappily almost disappeared from the field of 
social thought, that still lingers with some teachers. 
The writer remembers one young girl, teaching her 
first country school, who forbade her pupils their 
great annual bonfire, to which they looked forward all 
the year, because, as she said, the fun of that bonfire 
was the chief thought in their minds throughout the 
fall. The bonfire was, indeed, an annual festival, 
for which leaves and brush were gathered gleefully 
from the first day of school. It was probably a shame- 
ful economic blunder, but of that the teacher was as 
ignorant as the pupils. When the frosty days of 
late November came, usually just before the Thanks- 
giving recess, all the young people of the neighborhood 
gathered at the close of school to dance about the bon- 
fire. It was made in the middle of a wide road, that the 
forests on either side might be safe; and all who wished 
to brought their suppers and staid until the last embers 
sent up their last sparks. The conscientious but 
misguided girl who forbade the yearly fire-festival 
not only destroyed the happiness and good-nature of 
her boys and girls for the term, but discouraged a 
custom that was growing into a tradition. We have 
far too little of festival-making of that sort in our 
country —the kind of festival that grows up spon- 
taneously and is simple and innocent and at the same 
time recreative. Such play need not at all interfere
-P-A-G-E-137
THE SPIRIT OF THE SCHOOL IQ 
with hard and purposeful work, as the inexperienced 
girl in this instance thought it would. The teacher 
who followed her had the good sense to reéstablish 
the great bonfire as a school institution, and to favor 
it frankly. When it was over, she filled the aching 
void of anticipation by planning an Arbor Day cele- 
bration in the spring, and her pupils found as much 
joy in poring over florists’ catalogues and drawing 
the plans for a school garden as they had in raking 
leaves in the fall. 
The custom of making much of school holidays 
and celebrations is growing, and is at the same time 
becoming less formal, more spontaneous. The old 
set programs, in which every child appeared in his 
best clothes to “‘speak a piece,” are being partially 
supplanted by happy out-of-doors excursions and in- 
door parties — a change that adds joy to the occasion 
for the children and vastly lessens the labor involved 
for teachers. Some schools are nourishing a par- 
ticular festival, building up local tradition about some 
celebration of their own, often of a semi-historical 
nature. The pageant and the school-play combine 
pleasure and valuable training. Play-grounds have 
a recognized place in the educational scheme. The 
happiness of childhood is an object to which any 
number of thoughtful men and women give their time 
and attention. The spirit of joy is growing. Let it 
increase and multiply without stint. 
All these elements in the ideal school spirit make 
up a mass of interests common to both teachers and 
pupils, what may be called the working unity of the 
school. By mutual concession and the reciprocity Growth

of effort that is possible where there are common ends 
to be gained, it may be won even from the conflict-

of the most easily-maintained self-discipline that a 
school may know. It depends, says Arnold Tompkins, 
(x) on certain external conditions, (2) on the teaching 
process itself! It eliminates that grim antagonism 
of teacher and pupils, growing out of the imposition 
of tasks whose end and justification children can not 
understand, which lies at the root of so large a part 
of school trouble. It is the solvent which, receiving 
the varied and seemingly irre¢oncilable elements that 
exist in every school, gives in the end a precipitate of 
new knowledge and power. /

  CHAPTER IX 
AN ANALYSIS OF OFFENSES COMMON IN AMERICAN 
SCHOOLS 
Twat complexity of motivation which makes it dif- 
ficult to deal justly with offenders against school 
order, makes it still more difficult to classify offenses. 
Any approximate analysis and classification of the 
forms of bad order in our schools, must inevitably 
be marred by countless overlappings and coincidences 
of character, motive, and result. The analysis which 
follows is necessarily incomplete, unavoidably in- 
accurate. Other bases of classification than the one 
followed, which is one of causal relation, were rejected 
because they involved a still greater degree of over- 
lapping and duplication. It is hoped that this analysis 
may help teachers to find causes, and thereby to pro- 
vide remedies for the troubles in their own schools. 
I. OFFENSES OF MIsDIRECTED ENERGY 
These are the first result of the imposition of a formal 
regimen upon active, untrained, life-and-motion-loving 
children. There is nothing vicious whatever in them. 
1 The Schoolmasters’ Club of Minneapolis appointed a committee 
in 1911 to investigate the causes of student delinquency or failure 
in school work. The report of this committee, while not intended 
to bear especially upon the question of school discipline, is very 
helpful in giving an idea of the causes which, of course, affect both 
behavior and scholarship. It is given in the School Review, vol. 
20 (1912) pp. 593-605.

Whispering 
~ 
Note- 
writ   
122 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
They are the outcroppings of a vitality, a capacity 
for action, which can never quite be crammed into the 
measuring-cup of a school program. To reduce the 
amount of energy which runs to waste and becomes a 
nuisance, larger measuring-cups must be provided. 
Variety of occupation is today largely reducing the 
amount of this kind of disorder. 
Whispering is the first and most constant outlet 
for left-over interest and love of action. It becomes 
a more serious offense when persisted in because of a 
deliberate desire to bait the teacher, or when it is 
modified into a low rumbling monotone of communi- 
cation. But in its simplest form it is merely a result 
of as yet imperfect self-control, and like all other 
offenses of this class, deserves patient and unfailing 
help from the teacher, who is guide and prompter in 
the process of habit-formation, which will finally do 
away with the evil. 
Another form of communication which is more dif- 
ficult to deal with is note-writing. The pupil who 
is too closely watched to whisper, or who fears the con- 
sequences of whispering, but who still has not more 
wholesome things to absorb his time and interest, 
takes to note-writing. The evil begins as soon as the 
art of expression by writing has been sufficiently 
mastered to permit its use — usually in the third 
grade — and continues through the high school. The 
notes commonly passed from hand to hand in school 
fall into these groups: 
1. The note of resentment for punishment or cor- 
rection. ‘“She’s a mean old thing. All that 
hair ain’t hers. I know she wears a switch.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 123 
My mother says her father used to drive a brewery 
wagon, and now she puts on all sorts of airs.” 
This is a sample of the way in which youth seeks 
sympathetically to bind up the wounds of hurt 
pride. ; 
. Notes concerning lessons — usually to ask for 
an assignment. 
. Notes planning festivities for after-school hours. 
“Ask your mother if you can come over to our 
house tonight after supper. My sister is home 
from boarding school and she knows lots of ways 
. to have fun and scare the teachers.” 
. Notes planning school mischief. ‘‘ive got a toad 
in my desk in a box you ask mary to show you 
where Histry lesson is and ill put toad on her 
desk an wen she hollers ill grab it and tell mis 
Smith it musta got in the window.” 
. Gossiping notes. All sorts of school, family, and 
community news is distributed by busy little 
missives that slip about a schoolroom as if by 
magic. It could be told at recess just as well, 
but the risk of note-writing adds a romantic 
spice of adventure to this method of communica- 
tion. : 
. Notes asking or giving help in time of examina- 
tion or quiz. 
. Love-notes. These often begin in the third grade, 
and continue with intermissions throughout the 
grades and the high school. 
. Obscene notes. A rather common manifesta- 
tion of a problem which will be mentioned under 
the head of offenses due to physical causes.

  Unconscious 
vandalism 
Teasing 124 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Another outlet for pent-up energy is the soft humming 
or singing which is so hard to locate in a crowded room. 
Noisy movements, especially of the feet, and restless trips 
to wastepaper basket or drinking-fountain, are others. 
Then there is the aimless, often unconscious marking 
of school furniture, which even grown people sometimes 
find a welcome exercise for idle hands. In its uncon- 
scious stages this vandalism is stimulated most by the 
sight of marks already existing, which it is very natural 
to deepen and strengthen if one has a pencil or knife 
in one’s hand. This shows that the trouble is also 
largely imitative in origin. 
Pin-sticking, the throwing of paper-wads, tacks, 
or chalk, pulling girls’ hair, and the toilet operations 
in which little girls engage with a naive disregard to 
the publicity of their surroundings, are primarily the 
result of too much leisure. The pin-sticking and hair- 
pulling are examples of the satisfaction of a childish 
sense of fun, usually innocent enough in itself, which 
suggestion and guidance may turn into other channels. 
Some girls will continue to braid the hair of the girl 
in front of them at every opportunity, until other 
means of gratifying their love of the orderly and 
beautiful, together with a talk on the taste of such 
proceedings, substitute a better occupation. 
II. OFFENSES OF RESENTFUL RESISTANCE TO AN 
ImposEeD CoNnTROL 
There is today a great hue and cry all over the land 
against the formality and artificiality of our school 
curriculum. It is a law-abiding form of a resentment 
which has long existed, but which formerly showed
-P-A-G-E-143
  . on 
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 125 
itself in all forms of school lawlessness among pupils, 
and in lack of support and codperation among parents. 
- Having, in this day of self-analysis, found the nature 
and cause of its complaint, this resentment has emerged 
partly from the stage of its blind resistance, from the 
day of force, and comes out into the open with a manly 
statement of its grievance. It has not only become 
self-conscious, but it knows the remedy needed —a 
course of study, a school life, more closely answering 
the needs of the school children. 
But the response to this demand on the part of Why change 
school authorities is necessarily slow and imperfect. 
Even if they knew what equipment would be thoroughly 
adequate, the means to supply it are often wanting; 
while the inertia of accepted institutions is hard to 
overcome. There is a dearth of trained teachers for 
new work. There remains still in our schools, there- 
fore, much against which pupils feel a spirit of resistance 
and even of rebellion. Some of this is just, much of 
it unjust, growing out of the notorious assurance of 
youth that it knows better what is good for it than 
all the sages. Moreover, there is a resentment which 
is conscious, a deliberate feeling of being imposed 
upon by powers which can not be overcome but which 
can be hampered in doing their will; and an uncon- 
scious, or rather unformulated resentment which feels 
the teacher to be an enemy and delights in teasing and 
tormenting him. The teacher represents to his pupils 
the whole system of prescribed training, and is there- 
fore an object for the venting of their resentment at 
being forced to do what they dislike, and that for which 
many of them have no especial aptitude.

126 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
This resentment amounts in some schools to a defi- 
nite and universal understanding. It was strong in 
the frontier schools of an earlier day, wherein tortured 
schoolmasters strove single-handed with the natural 
resentment of boys whose heroes were the rough 
subduers of the wilderness, and who were learning arts 
of the usefulness of which they had the strongest doubts. 
It is very strong today in some of the schools of our 
great cities, where large numbers of foreign children 
are being forced into the mould of little Americans, 
much against the grain of both their inherited customs 
and the contamination of their American city sur- 
roundings. And there is enough of it still in almost 
all of our schools, good and bad, town and country, 
to make it a chief problem for all teachers. 
Disebedt- Deliberate disobedience is usually to be attributed 
cane. to this source. When so founded, it is among the 
hardest of all to deal with, for it fortifies itself by an 
appeal to justice, to the moral law. The pupil often 
feels himself honestly aggrieved. A frank and im- 
partial teacher. must often in such cases feel himself 
in the wrong, being the tool of an inadequate and 
mistaken system. Besides the pupil who openly 
resists the ‘control of the school, there is the one who 
avoids it by running away. Truancy is largely an 
imitative offense, but in its origin it is a protest against 
the system that keeps a boy pegging at books when 
nature and life are calling. Boys “play hookey” to 
go a-fishing, to earn money, or to play. The boy to 
whom the school program offers little intrinsic interest, 
may force himself to the distasteful task while cold 
weather lasts, but when spring arrives the call of real
-P-A-G-E-145
ve 
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 127 
interests transcends the force of convention. One 
boy dares to express his idea of relative values by 
deserting school, and others follow. A series of school 
expeditions would answer the need of the boys and 
take away their ground for resentment, but few Ameri- 
can teachers are trained to conduct such trips, while 
the American people look with suspicion upon what 
they regard as a shirking of the teacher’s duty.? 
A great variety of offenses are due to the same grim 
antagonism, happily growing less and less as better 
conditions prevail. The necessity of “breaking the 
will,’ much preached to a former generation, forced 
many naturally sympathetic teachers to stern measures 
which inevitably aroused this feeling. Inventive child- 
hood found a hundred ways, some of which have 
become traditional, in which to show it. They found 
that stamping, cat-calling, making faces, failing to 
hear directions, snow-balling, dragging the feet, eating 
in school, and countless other puerile amusements, 
annoyed teachers; and because they annoyed teachers, 
rather than because of any intrinsic pleasure in them, 
these offenses were committed. Weak teachers have 
had to endure them, while strong teachers have ex- 
pended upon their correction an incalculable amount 
of energy sadly needed for better causes. At last the 
whole attitude which gave rise to them is being trans- 
formed by a multitude of changes in and additions to 
the curriculum, which are curing the idea that teacher 
1 Truancy in some city and in some country schools proves to 
be due to demands for work from the child by parent or guardian. 
This absence is not of course an offense on the part of the child, and 
should be corrected by bringing the proper pressure to bear upon 
those really to blame.

and school are an unsympathetic despotism. To the 
same end, the untrained or time-serving teacher will 
in time give place to those whose friendly tact will 
entirely overcome the old resentment toward school 
and school requirements. 
III. OrrensEs DvuE To PuysicaAL CONDITIONS 
A large proportion of offenses is due to preventable 
or controllable faults in the physical environment, 
or to peculiarities in the physical condition of pupils. 
The former yield to correction so generally that there 
is small excuse for their continuance; the latter are far 
more puzzling and difficult to deal with. 
Resulis of the Physical Environment 
Tempera- A pervading restlessness is a common indication 
Loa that the schoolroom is either too warm or‘too cool. 
All teachers learn to make allowance for inattention 
and discontent, for wiggling and sputtering and dis- 
turbing trips to the cloakroom for wraps, when the 
room is below normal temperature; and for indolence 
and abstraction when it is too warm for comfort.t 
In country schools it is sometimes necessary to huddle 
the children closely about a red-hot stove to keep their 
toes from being frosted, so poorly constructed are the 
little schoolhouses. Such discomforts and informality 
are not conducive to earnest study, nor can the teacher 
insist on a very high standard of behavior in children 
for whom so little thought has been taken. So many 
improved devices are now on the market for controlling 
1 See Dexter, ‘“‘ School Deportment and the Weather,” Educa- 
tional Review, Feb., 1900, pages 160-168.
-P-A-G-E-147
    ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 129 
the temperature and humidity of schoolrooms, that 
every district should be provided with the means of 
keeping the school in comfort. A simple jacket of 
sheet-iron about a stove in which a fire may be kept 
over night will serve most one-room school buildings. 
A better arrangement is a heater in the basement, where 
fuel also may be kept, with a playroom for rainy days. 
The school standardization movement is accomplish- 
ing much in this direction. 
Air must be not only of the right temperature, but 
reasonably pure. The viciously contaminated air in 
some schoolrooms effectively prevents good work. 
Earnest application is impossible to the child whose 
lungs are filled with poison. Incapable of giving 
voluntary attention to the work in hand, he allows his 
involuntary attention to be drawn to any chance move- 
ment which catches his eye. Suggestion and imitation 
complete his fall into some offense from which good 
working conditions might have saved him. 
Poor light is likewise responsible for some misde- 
meanors. Poor light is too strong or too dim, direct 
sunlight on floor or work, or light from the wrong 
direction. A favorite and most annoying trick of 
children is to throw a brilliant reflection of sunlight 
about the room with a small mirror. This can never 
occur in a properly shaded room. On the other hand, 
dimly lit rooms encourage idleness and the unnum- 
bered works of darkness. Artificial light of some kind 
should be provided in every schoolroom for dark days. 
Any number of disgusting practices are traceable to 
dirty and insanitary school premises. A schoolhouse 
in a considerable village of central Illinois was so ill- Light

kept that the effects of its condition upon school order 
might easily be seen when school was not in session. 
The floor under the radiators was thick with accumu- 
lated dirt, in which could be seen deposits of peanut 
shells, pencil-sharpenings, candy-wrappers, and wads 
of paper. In a high window at the back of one room, 
a piece had been broken from a pane, evidently some 
time before, since the surrounding wall was studded 
with many generations of paper-wads, plainly aimed 
at the opening but landed wide of the mark. The 
dingy desks were deeply cut with initials and rude 
pictures. In the dark, dusty cloakrooms could be 
deciphered impudent legends concerning the teachers, 
and insulting statements about pupils. Had the 
schoolhouse been kept clean, had it been properly 
inspected, all these forms of bad order would have 
been, or at least could have been, prevented. A word 
here about the worst form of vandalism is apropos. 
There are outbuildings on school premises in our 
country containing disrespectful or indecent legends, 
which have been contaminating the minds of children 
for years because no teacher has had the courage to 
insist that the place be thoroughly cleaned up. Dirt 
in any form is demoralizing, and where it is condoned 
trouble may be expected from it soon or late. 
In many schools the mud brought in by pupils keeps 
the floors in poor condition and is a menace to health 
and a temptation to misbehavior. A shameless parsi- 
mony deters the boards of such schools from making 
the needed walks about the school buildings. In 
Tllinois, a state justly famous for the blackness and 
stickiness of its mud, it is not at all uncommon to see
-P-A-G-E-149
  
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 331 
country schools which have not a foot of sidewalk on 
the premises. Good concrete walks from the entrance 
of the school yard to the door, and also to each out- 
house, with scrapers at the front gate and others at 
the door, can be made at a very reasonable cost, will 
last for years, and will save health, appearances and 
self-respect. Mats of wire and fiber are also helpful in 
keeping the school floor in a sanitary condition.1 
A most disturbing if comparatively innocent offense 
is the craning of necks and straining of ears when sights 
and sounds from the outside world call the attention 
of the children. Older children may be set a task in 
self-control if the teacher enjoys psychological experi- 
ment, but little folk need merely a more thorough 
isolation. Opaque curtaining at windows and doors 
is first aid to injured attention. Deadened floors and 
walls shut out noise and induce an answering quiet 
from the pupils. A schoolhouse near a railroad, or a 
house in process of building, is a hard place to keep in 
order. 
In closing this division of our discussion, it should be 
said that it is the business of the school board to see 
that teachers have a fair chance to keep their schools 
in order. They should provide clean, quiet, comforta- 
ble quarters for the school, that the teachers may 
have no handicap in the mere material environment. 
Teachers should insist on such surroundings before 
beginning school; they have not half a chance without 
them.

  132 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Results of the Physical Condition of Pupils 
The growing pains of boys and girls are many and 
various. Sometimes they afflict the public in queer or 
annoying ways. A new consciousness of himself, a 
new ability to think independently, a cocky exuberance 
over the acquiring of some new dignity, has led many 
a school child who would not for worlds be deliberately 
impudent, into the temptation of “talking back” to 
his teacher. To check such manifestations wisely is 
no easy task, for if too severely reprimanded such a 
child may become silent and morose, sullenly aggrieved 
at an affront to his new dignity. 
A number of modes and stages mark the advance 
of children from babyhood to maturity, each with its 
characteristic aberrations and its own trying manner- 
isms or even vices. Boys, for instance, are by turns 
frankly affectionate, graciously patronizing, blindly 
indifferent, brutally rude, jealous, hateful, secretly 
admiring, and openly devoted to the little girls they 
meet at school. Girls are given to fads which they 
pursue with the most maddening single-mindedness. 
They make hairpin braid behind their geographies, 
they keep house in their desks, setting tea-tables with 
real food beneath the lid, they cut paper dolls, make 
rose-beads, write romances and diaries, read Laura Jean 
Libby, and draw cartoons of the teachers during 
school hours. All the interests of maturer years appear 
in little during a school-girl’s career. Restlessness: 
and change, resistance and adventure, are especially — 
strong in both boys and girls at the times when 
physical changes are most rapid and critical. Phys-

sin. ' 
normal physical development of boys and girls are 
those which are grouped under the term obscenity. 
They spring from a perversion of innocent instincts, 
and might be prevented in all but degenerate children 
by proper instruction, given preferably at home. Chil- 
dren have an altogether normal and healthy curiosity 
concerning the origin of life and the relation of the 
sexes; and the painful offenses against purity and good 
taste, of which they are guilty, are often but the 
result of the mistaken policy of reticence and deception 
which has been so long the rule. 
In addition to the problems that arise from the other 
natural and healthy development of children, there vomnh, at 
are others that spring from abnormal or subnormal 
conditions. These are notably inattention, with the 
restlessness and mischief that go with it, idleness, and 
irritability. Cheating is sometimes the pathetic last 
resort of a child who is prevented from making a good 
showing to parents or teacher, because of some physi- 
cal disability. Deafness, poor sight, adenoids, or simi- 
lar troubles, make children appear dull or indifferent. 
A cure of the physical trouble will often transform 
them in a short time into quick, attentive pupils to 
whom learning is a happiness, and obedience a grate- 
- ful impulse. School nurses are employed in many 
cities to help in the rescue of physically defective chil- 
dren, while dental and medical inspection is becoming Chief among the troubles which arise from the Obscenity

more and more common even in the remoter country 
districts." 
Aside from these organic troubles, thousands of 
children are prevented from doing good work, and so 
made subject to chance suggestions of mischief, because 
they are not well fed. Malnutrition keeps children 
below the point at which the nourished body sends a 
good supply of blood to the brain, so that physical 
and mental development go on together. Among the 
children of the very poor there is an actual lack of 
food, but among the well-to-do the trouble is usually 
with over-eating or a poor selection of food. Some 
country children eat to stupidity, following the example 
of the men of their families, who eat far more than 
even their hard manual labor can justify. Children 
who are fed rich pastry and pickles, and are allowed 
to drink coffee, ale or wine, can scarcely be expected 
to do well physically, or to respond to the highest 
appeals made to them. Fortunately, many cities have 
taken up the matter of the school luncheon for serious 
study and experimentation. Substantial lunches at 
from one to five cents are furnished. The school 
cafeteria is a recognized feature of the larger institu- 
tions. In the smaller schools, some good may be 
done by a series of very practical and detailed lessons 
on food and digestion, with experiments if possible 
to show the effects of badly chosen food upon the 
body.

IV. Orrenses Dur To UNTRAINED Mora Jupc- 
MENT AND PERVERTED IDEALS 
A group of very serious offenses may be traced to 
popular fallacies concerning moral laws, or to custom 
blindly followed without reference to moral law. 
Among young children these offenses spring usually 
from simple selfishness —a lack of socialization of 
spirit. They may be stubborn, refusing from pure 
self-will to follow directions, or to give up a personal 
privilege, or share some pleasant thing. Disobedience 
in older children is sometimes due, not to resentment 
against the teacher so much as to a mistaken ideal of . 
maturity, independence, and aristocratic high spirits. 
Such children have perhaps heard a grown person tell 
with complacency of an experience in which he worsted 
authority. The children imbibe the idea that resist- 
ance to law is the mark of a noble and untamable 
spirit. Inflammable literature, in which outlawry is 
idealized and villainy made picturesque, is sometimes 
responsible. A child who has absorbed such ideals 
wishes to prove his mettle by refusing to be bound 
by the petty regulations that trammel his fellows. A 
wise teacher, confronted by one of these theatrical, 
self-appointed heroes, will strike at the root of the 
difficulty by ascertaining the source of the pseudo- 
inspiration, and by substituting truer ideals for the 
harmful ones. 
' The children in many towns grow up without having 
had “a square deal” ethically. The ‘whole com- 
munity may be so poisoned by false ideals, in so primi-

really serious offenses without an idea that they are 
transgressing any moral law. An educator, having 
reason to visit a town in the Middle West, went to see 
the high school there. It was the last day of the 
semester, and examinations were being given. The 
books of all the students were piled up in long rows 
around the room. The principal and teachers ex- 
plained that the books had been taken from the students 
to prevent cheating, a custom which had been followed 
for years in that community. The reason for this 
was that the parents were of the firm opinion that 
the only harm in cheating lay in the possibility of being 
caught. It was not an uncommon thing for parents 
to boast to their neighbors of the successful exploit of 
a child who had outwitted the teachers on examination 
day. A tradition had grown up in that town which 
not only excused, but even fixed upon the children 
the habit of cheating. In a similar way, other evils 
have become traditional in various communities, which 
explains the fruitlessness of the efforts of conscientious 
teachers to effect a change for the better. Not the 
children in the school, but the parents in the homes, 
need education primarily. With the extension of 
school privileges to grown people, and the growing 
influence of schoolmen and schoolwomen in our coun- 
try, and with the awakening of the clergy to the need 
for specific moral instruction, we may hope that the 
ideals of the people may be raised from such a standard 
as is indicated in the illustration just given. One point 
can not be over-emphasized: that there is a close and 
vital connection between disorder and misconduct, 
and the ethical ideals of all the people from whom
-P-A-G-E-155
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 137 
pupils learn their code of life. Conduct works out from 
within, truly and inevitably. It is worse than useless 
to try to control school behavior and secure good 
school conduct, leaving all untouched the deep wells 
from which conduct springs. 
Fighting 
Fighting, not in itself an unmixed evil, springs from 
many causes, most of which may be grouped under 
the general head of inadequate ideals. They are in- 
adequate and outworn, the tenacious standards of a 
time long past, rather than perverted ideals. The 
most primitive and: ineradicable of them is the world- 
old admiration for brute force, and of the man or boy 
who can establish his position by recourse to it. A 
new boy in a school is expected to prove his right to a 
friendly reception by at least one well-fought battle, 
usually with the boss of the “gang.”” There are many 
other ways in which a boy may prove his right to the 
respect of other boys, but with an almost unfailing 
reversion to primitive standards, boys everywhere 
demand a fight. The challenged respond to the 
condition without great regret, for combativeness is of 
the spirit of man from the beginning. For this reason 
a “string” of fights often accompanies the entrance of 
a new boy into a school. 
Second among the ideals which foster fighting is a 
cheap notion of democracy which resents any and 
every inequality. Boys will often eagerly codperate 
in forcing a fight upon another boy whose only offense 
is some real or fancied superiority. Smart clothes, the 
attendance of servants, too brilliant recitations in class, The

an evident preference on the part of the teacher or of 
the girls in the school, or an unfortunate reference to 
experiences or possessions out of the reach of his 
schoolmates, has brought upon many a peace-loving 
boy the vengeance of the commoner. Most people 
resent superiority keenly, and children show this resent- 
ment frankly where their elders dissemble rather than 
acknowledge their humiliating position. 
Fighting is not quite the fundamental thing that 
its prevalence would lead one to believe. Boys like 
intense action, and in the absence of intense action of 
a better sort they turn to the intensiveness of combat. 
The personal element gives zest; the possibility of 
serious consequences turns the sport into adventure. 
The taste for fighting grows, like any other bad habit; 
and when other ways of securing excitement fail, 
boys learn to produce a fight by some kind of artificial 
stimulation, usually persistent taunting. Children can 
be maddeningly insulting, and with any convenient 
circumstance as a basis, will drive any self-respecting 
comrade to blows in a short time. Fights of this sort 
can be effectively cured only by furnishing a new 
interest of greater excitement than the fight. In other 
words, fighting must be crowded out by better amuse- 
ments. 
There is also the gang-fight, growing out of that 
intense loyalty to “our crowd” which seems to be part 
of a city boy’s religion. This is a survival of the old 
loyalty of the knight for his own particular band of 
robbers. It is one with that spirit which supports 
battle-ships and standing armies, Krupp guns and jin- 
goism, in these days when the arts of peace are, theoreti-
-P-A-G-E-157
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 139 
cally, appraised far above the arts of war. Even among 
very good and advanced people, the idea of a thorough 
socialization makes its way very slowly. Popular 
standards make a virtue out of devotion to the interests 
of one’s own particular unit, even when those interests 
clash with justice to the people of other units. This 
narrow, selfish preference for one’s own, coupled with 
the prejudice against outsiders which is its natural 
corollary, ought to be regarded as a vicious thing, and 
in a more enlightened age will be classed with the 
selfishness of the man who would restrict the gifts of 
life to his own family. As political parties bend their 
energies toward keeping their political enemies out of 
office, so boys, organized in gangs, develop a shrewd 
skill in outwitting other gangs, and make a virtue of 
every deed of violence committed in the name of the 
gang. General fights are usually due to the gang 
organization in some form, and the only real cure lies 
in breaking up the gang by substituting other interests 
for the regular gang activities. 
Still another cause of fighting is the prominence 
given to prize-fights in the newspapers and in popular 
conversation. When a prize-fighter becomes a national 
hero, the school bully becomes a local one. Neverthe- 
less, his pugnacity is modified by restrictions, for 
schoolboys learn to referee and conduct fights in very 
professional form. This is not altogether bad; indeed, 
if fighting is as inevitable as some would have us 
believe, it is altogether good. It introduces a code 
of fairness, of submission to established rules, that 
removes these contests from the realm of the purely 
brutal. If boys will fight, it is good for them to fight Imitative 
fights

under regulations that instil some ideals of fair play. 
Where characteristics copied from prize-fights are very 
prominent, these combats will usually be found to spring 
from imitation of what the boys consider the most 
manly sport. Teachers in boys’ schools have suc- 
ceeded in controlling fighting almost entirely by sub- 
stituting boxing contests under supervision; but this 
method is scarcely practicable in most public schools. 
Shielding Evil-Doers 
An offense which many teachers condone or justify 
is the shielding of schoolmates who have done wrong, 
through the same sense of party-loyalty which upholds 
the gang. In the minds of many children, the school 
and its pupils are two opposing forces, each trying to 
outwit the other. They feel that loyalty to their party 
includes the shielding of any member who has trans- 
gressed the law, no matter how seriously. The atti- 
tude of teachers and parents who dilate upon the crime 
of “tattling” supports the idea. Now it is true that 
tale-bearing is an ugly habit, and that it sometimes 
grows, if not checked, until all sorts of petty personal 
grievances are carried to an overburdened teacher for 
adjustment. Small children, if championed in their 
little differences, do not learn the self-reliance which 
comes through a normal series of self-defensive con- 
tests. But petty tale-bearing and the betrayal of 
wrong-doing are as different as helpfulness between 
pupils who are mastering a new task, and helpfulness 
between the same pupils when the task is supposed to 
be mastered and a test is being given. Helpfulness in 
one case is altruism, in the other dishonesty. The
-P-A-G-E-159
  ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES I41 
inquiry by the teacher, who has a right to know the 
facts, makes the difference in both cases. A consistent 
allegiance to social ideals and an adequate conception 
of the school as a social unit, demand that all work 
together for the good of all. Each citizen in this little 
country should be a law-enforcer. When one or several 
citizens fail, it is the duty of others, if called upon, to 
help bring them to justice and reformation. The child 
who protects another child who is in the wrong is an 
accessory to that wrong, and an enemy to the best 
interests of the school. 
It goes without saying that teachers should be tact- 
ful in acting upon this principle. The older ideal, 
of loyalty to individuals which transcends the obliga- 
tion to the body social, is still so generally held, even 
by thoughtful people, that one finds the newer loyalty 
“more honored in the breach than in th’ observance.” 
It is almost always possible to find out what is to be 
known without direct questioning, one of the notable 
axioms of teachers being that children will “tell on 
themselves” if given a fair chance.,, If an inquisition 
becomes advisable, however, no teacher should hesitate 
because of conscientious scruples concerning the child’s 
right to shield a friend.! 
Lying 
Dr. Hall ? differentiates seven kinds of lying to which 
children are prone. Some are innocent expressions 
of the spirit of play, or over-conscientious scrupling;

others are cowardly or vicious subterfuges leading to 
serious defects in character. The classification is as 
follows: 
1. Pseudophobic lies, or statements which children 
morbidly fear and imagine are lies. This fear leads to 
systematized palliatives, over-fine word-splitting, and 
reluctance to give definite answers to questions. Such 
children fear they may unwittingly lie, and suffer terrible 
consequences, either immediately or in a future life. 
2. Heroic lies, justified and even acclaimed as a 
laudable sacrifice of mere personal honor to another’s 
gain. Such lying, especially when used to protect 
schoolmates, often grows out of ideals formed by hear- 
ing stories of justified lies. Devotion to friends has a 
more concrete and emotional appeal to the childish 
heart and mind than devotion to truth, “truth” being 
an abstraction often beyond their comprehension. 
3. Lies which express dislike. ‘Truth for friends 
and lies for enemies” is a defensible doctrine for chil- 
dren until a more impersonal ideal has been taught 
them. And grown people often support them in the 
childish idea that, while honorable treatment is due to 
friends, ‘‘all’s fair in war.” 
4. Selfish lies. These are the lies of denial for the 
sake of protection, and those told to gain a point. 
They are the most common and the most dangerous 
of the lies met with in schools. They are fostered by 
too much emphasis on honors and marks, by excessive 
emulation, by undue severity in punishment, by care- 
lessness in accepting excuses without investigation. 
But no care of conditions will ever entirely eliminate 
the opportunities for telling them, nor will little chil-
-P-A-G-E-161
  ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 143 
dren cease to try to protect themselves by this instinc- 
tive means. It is a fault that must be fought “by 
appeals to honor, self-respect, self-control. Hard and 
even hated tasks, and rugged moral, mental, and 
physical regimen should supplement those modern 
methods which make education a sort of self-indulgence 
of natural interests.” 
5. Lies born of the imagination and play-instinct. 
These spring from the pleasure of self-deception and of 
imposing on others the shadowy fancies of an idealiz- 
ing temperament. In themselves they are innocent, 
and should not be stopped; but children need help in 
distinguishing between fact and fancy, which are often 
strangely confused in their active but not analytical 
minds. The child who declares that he saw a horse 
with five feet walking across the lake, drawing a car- 
riage full of mice as big as collies, needs some pains- 
taking explanation of his own mental processes; but 
for the sake of our future literature he should not be 
punished for lying. He may yet redeem us from the 
too-true charge of literal-mindedness. 
6. Pseudomania, or the love of lying for the sake of Th 
the impression produced, is a serious moral disease. 5 
It usually shows itself in boys in a desire to humbug or 
trick others, and in girls in a morbid kind of affectation, 
which seeks constant attention. Such girls make up 
marvelous stories of the wealth, fame, and ancestry 
of their families, for the sake of the distinction it gives 
them in the eyes of their schoolmates. Boys lie for 
the pure fun of trying the credulity of others, of finding 
out how much they can make them believe. After a 
time this love of lying for its effect becomes a habit of The “lie” 
of fancy 
e 
sensational 
ie
-P-A-G-E-162
  144 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
lying, without regard to effect. The victim can not 
tell the truth, even when it is to his advantage to do so. 
“These cases demand the most prompt and drastic 
treatment. If the withdrawal of attention and sym- 
pathy and belief in the earlier manifestations, and if 
instruction and stern reprimand are not enough,” 
says Dr. Hall, ‘there is still virtue in the rod, which 
should not be spared, and, if this should fail, then the 
doctor should be called.” 
7. Palliative lies, which are at least partially excused 
by mental reservations or muttered reversing formule; 
the pantomimic lie, and the lie of silent assent. “I 
didn’t do it, it was my hand,” is a common inward 
excuse for a lying denial. 
All of these varieties of lies except the first and fifth 
should be treated as serious moral offenses, which give 
rise to vices in maturer years if not checked in youth. 
A fine and high and uncompromising ideal of truth can 
be built up by attacking the evil forcibly whenever it 
shows itself. But the teacher needs to be very sure of 
understanding the motive and nature of the lie before 
attempting to correct it, lest injustice, or the applica- 
tion of ineffective blundering remedies result. 
Stealing 
Stealing is another sin whose prevention and cure 
lie in vigorous instruction, in the inculcation and drilling 
of strong prejudices. Among schoolchildren it seems 
to be due to a variety of motives, all of which would 
yield to a standard of absolute honesty if that standard 
were taught early enough and sufficiently emphasized. 
Children steal because of
-P-A-G-E-163
  ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 145 
1. The instinct of acquisitiveness, which, unchecked, 
leads a child to take what attracts his attention or 
what he can use. 
2. The desire to have something to give away. 
Children who can not get such gifts at home frequently 
steal apples, flowers, or candy to give to the teacher or 
to an adored classmate. 
3. A desire to show superior cleverness. A boy in 
a California school, for instance, boasted that he could 
steal an orange a day from a carefully guarded tree, for 
two weeks. He had formed a friendship for the bull- 
dog which lived at that home, and accomplished the 
feat, to the great admiration of his schoolmates, by 
feeding him a piece of meat while the family were at 
luncheon. He had almost made good his boast when 
another boy betrayed him unintentionally in a school 
theme, which set an investigation on foot. The would- 
be thief belonged to a well-to-do family, and had no 
incentive for such acts but the craving for admiration 
and notoriety. Systematic stealing from lockers and 
lunch-boxes, which in some schools defies detection 
for a long time, is probably partly because of the fun 
connected with puzzling and baffling the authorities 
for so long a time. 
4. The demands of others. Occasionally a case of 
deliberate instruction of a child in stealing, by parents 
or others, is unearthed. 
5. Convenience. Pencils, erasers, rulers, papers, 
or textbooks are taken from desks by pupils who 
need these articles, and have no scruples about 
supplying themselves from whatever stores may be 
at hand. Stealing 
for fun
-P-A-G-E-164
Cheating 
Gambling 
  146 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Direct, rationalized, and at the same time emotion- 
alized teaching, combined with punishment of actual 
offenses, will cure stealing in most cases, provided the 
pupil is young enough. The evil is one of the long list 
to be attributed to neglected home training. 
Cheating is also to be attributed to an untrained 
moral judgment. The cause is simply a neglect of the 
teaching of prejudices against unfair means of gaining 
one’s ends — in the absence of which, of course, any 
means seems good. The moral judgment which should 
make a child recoil with repugnance fram dishonesty 
is not a judgment at all, strictly speaking, but an 
habitual reaction, as mechanical as writing or eating. 
Its rationalization may come early or late; the child 
is safe if only the prejudice be well fixed. The boy or 
girl who cheats has a poor sense of relative values; he 
has been taught to overestimate a grade, or to under- 
estimate the imperative necessity of honesty. 
Various devices by which something may be had for 
nothing develop in children a taste for gaming, and 
should be prohibited as subversive of morals. Play- 
ing marbles for keeps is essential gambling, as is penny- 
matching and pencil-tossing. The grab-baskets and 
other petty lotteries which often flourish in the vicinity 
of schools show how quickly children respond to the 
lure of gaming. The wonder of so great a gain as is 
possible with so little invested seems to appeal irresist- 
ibly to childish imaginations. The sense of fair com- 
pensation, which is one of the most intricate and 
difficult to develop of all our acquired feelings, is 
almost entirely wanting in children. It is foolish to 
expect that little folk will refrain from gaming through
-P-A-G-E-165
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 147 
any deliberate judgment based on motives of honesty, 
although strong prejudices may be early developed, and 
make the strongest defense against the subtle tempta- 
tion to take a chance. The only safeguard against 
gambling devices is their absolute prohibition. For- 
tunately, the laws in most states are sufficiently severe 
to be an effective ally of teachers and school boards, 
if enforced; and public opinion, more sensitive in this 
matter than in many others, will usually support a 
crusade against schemes calculated to develop a love 
for gaming among children. 
V. OFFENSES OF SENSATIONALISM 
“All the world’s a stage” to children who enjoy 
being in the limelight. No trammeling sense of 
propriety limits the field of their histrionics. Unless 
carefully trained in the prejudices that make people 
well-bred, children carry their theatricals to church, 
to concerts, and to lectures, and parade them when 
shopping, walking, and riding. They keep the choicest 
bits of “business,” however, for school, where they 
have an appreciative audience of themselves. The 
mischief caused by childish vanity is not so great in 
volume, perhaps, as that due to the causes already 
mentioned; but the offenses are more sensational in 
character, and their power to break up school order 
and belittle authority is immense. They spring from 
a primeval sort of vanity, which seeks to attract atten- 
tion to its possessor by any means at almost any cost. 
Under a strong school government this vanity is held 
in check by the fear of consequences, and by the force 
of public opinion, which pays its meed of reverence to “ Showing 
off”?

efficiency. But where the authority of the teacher is 
not yet established or has broken down, the theatrical 
instincts of youth assert themselves strongly, and the 
result is usually a series of those ingenious imperti- 
nences which become the stock-in-trade of half-amused 
and wholly-shocked scandal-mongers. 
Among the more serious offenses due to a desire to 
attract attention and comment, is that of introducing 
an intolerable odor into the schoolroom. Cut onions 
are mild offenders; assafoetida, sulphur compounds, 
and Limburger cheese, especially when concealed in 
the coils of radiators, may easily break up a school 
session. Snuff or red pepper is sometimes scattered 
on schoolroom floors, producing uncontrollable sneezing. 
Most colleges cherish a legend of some class which 
proved its right to fame by hoisting a cow to the belfry, 
or installing a flock of sheep in a favored classroom. 
Boys and girls, hearing these tales of great deeds, 
follow them in a modest way, hoping to win at least 
passing mention. They put a mouse or a snake into 
the teacher’s desk, or conceal in their coats kittens or 
puppies, later to be turned adrift upon a not indif- 
ferent world. Children have been known to carry 
bees, mice, bats, and angleworms into the room in 
boxes, which were afterward opened, liberating very 
effective disturbers of the peace. 
Other misdeeds which bring the perpetrator to the 
admiring notice of his fellows are the marking of the 
backs of coats with chalked legends, or pinning paper 
labels there. Boys of the Treasure Island age proudly 
exhibit arms tatooed with ink-pricks* or transfer pic-

tures. Shaking the building by quick pressures of the 
feet is a traditional way of creating a sensation by 
puzzling the teacher, whose efforts to discover the 
offender make a huge joke. Another method of annoy- 
ing a teacher and disturbing a schoolroom lies in 
sprinkling the floor with match-heads, which may be 
dropped from a slit in a coat-pocket in such a way as 
to escape the sharpest surveillance. The subsequent 
popping and snapping can not be blamed upon the 
students who step upon the match-heads, who may 
not be the same ones who dropped them. Altogether 
the offense is one in which offenders are hard to find 
and punish. 
A favorite trick in one school was the throwing of 
handfuls of fine shot to the ceiling when the teacher’s 
back was turned. By the time the shot had struck 
the ceiling and pattered down briskly all over the room, 
the culprit was innocently at work, or looking as sur- 
prised as his neighbors. In the same school, one ingeni- 
ous boy dared to appropriate the hat, muffler, overcoat, 
and arctics of a visitor, and use them to dress up a bass 
viol that stood in the principal’s office. At the close 
of a study period, when the rows of students in the 
assembly room passed back to the classroom doors, 
the ends of the aisles were found to be blocked by a 
rope, which passed from desk to desk at a height of 
about two feet, across the rear of the room. All these 
pranks were invented for the sake of the admiring 
comments of loafers on the street or parents at 
home, as well as for the more immediate audience of 
schoolmates. Many grown people utterly fail, by the 
half-hearted deprecation they affect, to conceal their Misdirected cleverness

admiration for such undignified conduct, such a travesty 
on public education. The instances recorded occurred 
at a time of change of administration, when a shift 
in control aroused resentment and put the school 
system much in the public eye. In ordinary times of 
sustained authority they could not have happened. 
An especially blameworthy offense is the deliberate 
effort to make the authority of a teacher seem ridicu- 
lous, and his efforts to keep order puerile, by assuming 
an appearance of indifference or disorder, while care- 
fully refraining from the letter of disobedience. Some 
children delight in gazing absently through a window, 
or staring at the ceiling; and, when their teacher 
thinks to catch them napping by calling on them 
suddenly, rattle off answers with a disconcerting 
promptness and accuracy. The joke is on the teacher, 
who does very ill to leave it there. A teacher should 
demand not only attention, but every appearance of 
attention; and the appearance of bad order is in itself 
an offense, to be dealt with severely. A teacher who 
had been much annoyed by a species of small cata- 
pult, with which boys shot paper wads about the 
room, seemed finally to have captured or banished 
all the machines, and to have restored perfect order. 
While still sensitive to any sign of their use, however, 
she thought, on suddenly turning, that she saw one boy 
lower his arms hastily and slip something into his desk. 
She said nothing, but soon afterward turned quickly 
again, when the performance was repeated. She went 
to the boy’s desk and raised the lid. There was no 
slingshot there. A questioning and search failed to 
reveal any, whereupon the grinning boy confessed that
-P-A-G-E-169
  ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES I51 
he had made the motions purposely ‘‘to fool the 
teacher.”’ The teacher, however, being no fool, stood 
the boy up in the corner for the afternoon, explaining 
that his offense added lying to inattention, and was 
therefore worse than the use of a real slingshot. 
VI. OFFENSES OF IMITATION 
Community and home are mirrored pretty accurately 
in the problems of public school teachers. Any num- 
ber of the alarming or annoying misdeeds of pupils 
are sheer and simple imitations of what the grown 
people whom the children know, do or say they do. 
These offenses vary from gum-chewing, a comparatively 
innocuous but incomparably annoying American cus- 
tom, to very serious misdemeanors that often end in 
the courts. Their importance can scarcely be over- 
estimated. The majority of the acts of all human 
beings are imitative until they become habitual, while 
habits themselves are but the results of successive 
imitations. If this be true of mature, thinking people, 
it is infinitely more true of children, with whom sugges- 
tion is more potent owing to the absence of established 
habitual response. The list of school offenses growing 
out of imitation is a long one, and strongly suggests 
the unity of school life with the whole life of the world, 
and the interest of teachers and parents in every 
phase of social reform. The following enumeration 
includes only the more important and general mis- 
demeanors. 
Children who hear impertinent language will be 
impertinent. They have a positive genius for remem- 
bering, reproducing, extending, and adorning the Environ~

manners

sharp and disrespectful things they hear. Parents who 
quarrel, or taunt each other, may not receive similar 
treatment from their children, but some other child, 
or a teacher, or a helpless cripple on the street, will 
reap the harvest of sharp words. When children are 
impudent, the teacher may look for the cause in a quar- 
relsome home life, in the influence of a virago in the 
child’s neighborhood, in the instigation of a mischief- 
maker who suggests the “smart” attitude to a self- 
conscious aspirant after notoriety, or in the example 
of a strong, vigorous leader among the children. The 
man who boasts of his “independence” toward his 
employer, or who tells his admiring children how. he 
defied the park policeman who ordered him off the grass, 
is planting the seeds of disrespect in those fertile little 
minds. Teachers may profitably enlarge upon this 
subject at meetings of Parents’ and Mothers’ Clubs. 
A step further than impertinence lies lawlessness, 
which is the expression of the same spirit in deeds. 
Children can not be expected to submit to regulations, 
when the grown people from whom they learn their 
code of life, so lightly defy the law of the land. Chil- 
dren know that their parents exceed the speed limit 
when motoring, smuggle goods into the country, kill 
game out of season, send letters rolled in newspapers 
to avoid paying first-class postage, and tell lies about 
ages when paying fares. The spirit that prompts 
their elders to evade the law that should be supported, 
and sets up personal advantage or a conviction that 
the law is a mistaken one, as a legitimate reason for 
disobeying it, is easily and freely imbibed by children, 
and results in untold trouble in the schools. Lawless-
-P-A-G-E-171
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 153 
ness is said to be growing in this country. The schools 
must stand as a unit to combat the tendency, and to 
teach in a positive way the necessity and righteousness 
of law. Teachers themselves are sometimes guilty of 
the spirit of disrespect for law. In a certain school, 
for instance, the seventh grade teacher actively opposed 
the order of the principal that all classes should march 
in and out in lines, and to music. She was one of the 
spontaneity fiends who object to artificial order because 
it is not a natural, instinctive, childlike thing. She 
told her pupils that she did not agree with the principal, 
and when he was not there to see, she allowed them 
to hop and skip after their own spontaneous promptings. 
She was popular with the children, and made the com- 
mon mistake of overestimating the strength of her 
personal appeal to them. Once, when she had gone 
away on an errand, leaving her classes quietly study- 
ing, she returned to find a half-dozen boys and girls 
standing on their desks. An ingenious leader had 
dared them, and they had responded. 
“But I ought to be able to trust you,” said the 
seventh grade teacher. “Can’t you be trusted when 
I’m away, just as much as when I’m here?” 
» There was a moment’s pause, while the children sat 
in shamed silence. Then the schoglroom Nemesis 
spoke loudly and accusingly: 
“Mr. Lane can’t trust you to make us march out 
when he’s not here.” 
Allied to the lack of respect which shows itself in 
defiant words and deeds, is the lack of respect which 
shows itself in ridicule. Americans may well be proud 
of the keen, broad-gauge humor and the incisive wit Unreliable

  Irreverence 154 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
which characterize daily intercourse in this country. 
There is a quality of superfluousness in it, of over- 
flowing spirits, of fun that overleaps all temperate 
bounds, an exuberance of laughter for its own sake. 
American humor is as wasteful of itself as American 
farming. It lacks delicacy, finish, and reserve; it 
glories in an audacity which is refreshing or shocking, 
according to one’s point of view. It is the audacity 
of American humor, passing too often into irreverence, 
which distinguishes it from the humor of older coun- 
tries, which seems therefore tame and pointless to 
Americans. It is the irreverent fun of Americans 
which becomes a social menace. It is the habit of 
seeing fun in things which should command only 
respect, love, gratitude, or horror and fear. The 
deference due to age, to position, to honorable service, 
to the self-respect of the poor, alike yield to the uni- 
versal love of a joke. A mistaken sense of the ludicrous 
turns even the misfortunes of deformity or imbecility 
into a source of laughter. This is all wrong. How- 
ever, it is a condition so generally prevalent that 
children early fall into a habit of easy ridicule unless 
they are guarded against it. ‘Do you know, I can 
always see a funny side to everything,” is a common 
boast, given with great complacency. The ridicule 
of children falls upon the weak and helpless, upon 
those who differ from them in clothes and customs, and 
upon teacher, pupils, the school regimen in general. 
They copy the habit from their elders, from moving- 
pictures and vaudeville shows, and especially from that 
arch-enemy of all that is desirable, the “funny sheet” 
of the Sunday newspaper. The widespread example 
: 7
-P-A-G-E-173
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 155 
of the Katzenjammers and their ilk has corrupted 
more good manners than the whole teaching fraternity 
can correct in a decade. 
Obscenity is due partly to natural curiosity imper- 
fectly and mistakenly satisfied, and partly to imita- 
tion. Probably imitation has more to do with it 
than natural curiosity. Inscriptions on walls, and 
literature secretly circulated, calling attention to 
phases of living of which children would otherwise 
know little or nothing, and the conversation of older 
students, stimulate like thinking and talking among 
children who are often so young that they do not 
ealize the nature and import of the subjects they 
discuss. Sharp supervision of premises and friendly 
association with pupils, together with a high standard 
made reasonable by wise explanation, are preventives 
and cures of obscenity. It is very doubtful if the 
evil can be entirely eliminated from our schools until 
a higher moral standard becomes prevalent throughout 
society. : 
Profanity is an offense for which no possible excuse 
can be found. It has psychological effects of a most 
serious nature, aside from all the religious considera- 
tions which make it revolting to a majority of people. 
Among children it may be said to be altogether an imi- 
tative vice. Its use demands the most summary treat- 
ment, as an offense against both good taste and morals, 
with efforts to build up strong prejudices in favor of 
simple and reverent language. 
Hazing is an offense found for the most part in 
college towns, where the children in the common schools 
copy it from the higher institutions. Occasionally it

crops out even in remote villages, however, instigated 
by an ingenious leader with a big brother in college, or 
a book of college stories in the home library. Tom 
Brown’s Schooldays has introduced the custom into a 
few schools, although as a rule the fagging system there 
portrayed was carried on in ways so foreign to Ameri- 
can school customs as not to carry over as a practical 
stimulus. The example of present-day college hazing 
is far more suggestive. The fact that most high school 
boys live at home is fortunate, as it protects them 
largely from such treatment. 
The newspapers occasionally chronicle concerted 
revolts of school children, in which the methods used 
are copied from those of labor organizations. They 
follow the imposition of some task or course to which 
the pupils object, a change in teachers, or an attempted 
reform for which the way has not been prepared by 
building up public opinion among the pupils. They 
are the signs of shrewd thinking and an aroused self- 
consciousness peculiar to our own time, and have been 
considered, according to the equity conceded their 
claims, a fine manifestation of the spirit of justice, or 
a horrible example of that perverted democracy which 
borders on anarchy. 
The offenses connected with high school fraternities 
include almost every asinine absurdity imaginable. 
The spectacular and self-indulgent phases of college 
fraternity life appeal very strongly to high school 
boys in whom the love of good times is strong. Simi- 
larly, the fun and romance of sorority life often mean 
more to impressionable young girls than all the breadth 
of training which a college education gives a woman.

ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 157 
It is natural that these things should appeal to the 
spirit of youth, but it is dangerous to allow that appeal 
to outweigh the real needs of healthy boys and girls. 
Our laws and their enforcement are usually so lax 
that school authorities must be very alert to protect 
their charges against the enterprise of those who com- 
mercialize the vice of catering to depraved appetites. 
That is to say, popular indifference and ignorance 
have forced upon the school the fight for unspoiled 
minds and free wills, for good materials upon which 
to work. Teachers must prepare the field before seed 
may be sown, and guard it constantly from the spoiler. 
In this matter the natural instinct of imitation, which 
leads boys to smoke or drink because their fathers and 
elder brothers do so, is stimulated by pretty systematic 
suggestion or even urgent inducements. The manu- 
facturers of cigarettes play skilfully upon the boyish 
love of doing things that are manly; and they supple- 
ment the appeal to the instinct of imitation by an 
appeal to the instinct of acquisitiveness, when they 
offer pictures, pennants, and other premiums with the 
tobacco. The logical cure for an evil based on imita- 
tion is to do away with the example, which means an 
abstinence on the part of teachers and parents at 
which the most conscientious often stop short. There 
will probably be some smoking on the part of boys so 
long as men continue to smoke, but the evil can be 
reduced to a minimum if a courageous stand be taken 
upon the question. 
Drinking among school children, and the use of 
drugs, are similarly the effect of environment, sugges- 
tion, and direct appeal by those interested. There Tobacco,

are in most localities strict ordinances concerning the 
selling of liquor to minors, “rushing the growler,” 
and the sale of narcotics. Where these evils exist in 
spite of the ordinances the school authorities and the 
police department have in many places codperated to 
enforce the law. In other places, where the police 
department refused to do anything to remedy the 
wrong, it was necessary to interest numbers of citizens 
in the condition of things and bring the force of public 
opinion to bear upon the situation. The sale of some 
narcotics, particularly that form of opium called 
heroin, and different forms of cocaine, is so profitable 
that druggists risk severe penalties for the gain of the 
traffic. Heroin — “scat” or “joy powder” in the 
vocabulary of its devotees — forms a fixed habit very 
quickly, and one that is practically incurable. In 
some schools the habit of inhaling chloroform becomes 
a fad before the teachers are aware that it has been 
introduced. In one small town of the Middle West 
a boy had formed an incurable habit, which so inter- 
fered with his work that he was finally compelled to 
leave school, before his teachers had any inkling of the 
cause of his sleepiness and dullness. Children who lay 
their heads upon the desk, with handkerchiefs over 
their faces or with hands covering the nostrils, should 
be watched carefully. In large cities it is not uncom- 
mon to find children, especially cglored children, 
addicted to cocaine, which can be used in ways that 
defy detection except to experienced observers. The 
use of headache powders of various sorts, especially 
those based upon phenacetin and acetanilide, widely 
advertised under pseudo-medical trade-names, should
-P-A-G-E-177
  ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 159 
be guarded against carefully. Many high school girls 
form the habit of dependence upon such compounds 
without understanding the danger of their use. 
No less harmful are certain compounds widely sold 
at soda-fountains, and much used by high school and 
college students as stimulants. It is the duty of high 
school principals to see to it that not only the members 
of classes in physiology, but all students, understand 
clearly the great risk that attends the use of any drug 
or drug compound, and that they know the names of 
the compounds commonly sold that contain drugs. 
The most common and therefore the most dangerous 
of these are certain very popular stimulating com- 
pounds which are widely advertised in reputable 
papers and magazines, and sold everywhere at foun- 
tains, as well as in bottles for home consumption. Well- 
informed physicians know the danger that inheres in 
their use, and where students are found to be addicted 
to them they should be sent to a doctor for warning and 
advice. A talk to the entire school about these habit- 
forming stimulants may be a good thing if the physician 
or principal can make it sufficiently earnest and im- 
pressive to be a warning and not a challenge. 
VII. Orrenses DvuE TO CRUDE AND UNTRAINED 
MANNERS 
Children are sometimes guilty of very annoying 
breaches of propriety or ethics through ignorance, 
having no intention whatever of doing wrong. Inex- 
perienced or thoughtless teachers often fail to take 
into consideration the limited home training of their 
pupils, and blame and punish them for offenses which Drugs at

and

are committed in all innocence. Almost the whole 
category of school offenses comes occasionally into this 
class; but ignorance of the law, of course, serves as an 
excuse only when there has been neither home training 
nor other training to take its place. A child who 
hears profanity constantly at home is not on that 
account excusable for using it at school, after having 
its offensiveness explained to him. 
An offense largely due to careless home habits is 
the vandalism so common among Americans. It 
comes of a lack of respect for property rights and 
a poor appreciation of property itself. In their own 
homes many children are allowed to cut and scratch 
as they wish; and they naturally do the same at 
school. Even where parents insist on care for their 
own property, they fail to teach the obligation of each 
member of the state to care for the common posses- 
sions. There is no feeling of sharing the responsibility, 
as they share the enjoyment, of goods held by the body 
social. This ideal the school must strive definitely 
to instill, and as it becomes more general, the carving 
of names on desks, the marking up of walls, sidewalks 
and windowpanes, and the careless waste of public 
commodities, now so common everywhere, will become 
mercifully less. 
Much impertinence is also attributable to simple 
lack of training. It may accurately represent the 
pupil’s attitude or not, but in any case ‘the parents, 
and not the boys and girls, are to blame. When one 
considers the phraseology used by thousands of parents 
to their children, the wonder is that these children ever 
find words of respect with which to address outsiders
-P-A-G-E-179
  
ANALYSIS OF COMMON OFFENSES 161 
“ ” of their family circle. Such expressions as “say, 
“hello,” “nope,” and “yep” bear no implication of 
disrespect in the minds of the children who use them 
most. A boy in an eastern school, devotedly attached 
to his manual training teacher, had to be broken 
almost forcibly of the habit of addressing his teacher 
as “Old Sport,” which in his home and social circle 
was a term of affectionate admiration. Many young 
girls, teaching their first terms in country districts, 
are annoyed by personal familiarities, allusions to 
personal affairs, teasing, and disrespectful language, 
which need correction, but do not deserve punishment. 
The notable failure of most country school teachers 
lies in the fact that they accept these conditions, while 
deploring them; they make no well-planned effort to 
change things. They object, for instance, to being 
addressed by their pupils as “Teacher” rather than 
by their names; but they do not teach their pupils 
the custom of courteous people everywhere, which 
makes frequent use of the individual name. 
Other annoying outcomes of neglected home train- 
ing are the scuffling, teasing, and other forms of horse- 
play which are so irritating to grown people in general, 
and to women of gentle breeding especially. They 
are but the expression of a normal love of action, 
social intercourse, and rivalry, by boys and girls whose 
modes of expression are primitive and limited. Educa- 
tion changes the form of expression, while punishment 
but inhibits action, reducing the healthy spirits of 
childhood to sullen sluggishness. A tennis cour i 
a gymnasium, regular calisthenics and organiz 
athletics, will take care of the physical exuberance Horseplay

that shows itself in these unpleasant ways, if at the 
same time there be given some frank talks upon the 
propriety of such actions. Gentle manners and con- 
sideration are not difficult to develop when the ideal 
is made attractive and the laws of habit-formation 
may be followed persistently. 
SUMMARY 
School offenses are caused by 
1. Physical and mental energy not wholly used or 
properly directed. 
2. A resentful resistance to a control which pupils 
do not understand or accept. 
3- Peculiarities in the physical condition of pupils, 
or a faulty physical environment. 
4. The lack of training in morals and manners, and 
the false and fallacious ideals which pass current 
in society. 
5. A desire to attract attention and create a sensa- 
tion. 
' 6. Imitation of others. 
q. The lack of culture.

  CHAPTER X 
PUNISHMENT 
WE need to return to at least one idea preached to Justification 
our Puritan forefathers, an idea which largely shaped 
the lives of generations of forceful folk. This is the 
principle that no deviation from the moral law is with- 
out its penalty. Every gin has its punishment. Every 
sin has its punishment in the deterioration, or, to put 
it positively, the lack of development, in the character 
of the sinner. This is inevitable and automatic, a 
law of life that requires no deus ex machina for its 
enforcement. If they were solitary creatures, men 
might rest content with the justice of this law, allow- 
ing each person to work out his own salvation or 
condemnation. But society is an intricate web of 
mutual influences and common responsibilities, and 
transgressors bring suffering upon many others, seen 
and unseen, besides themselves. To reduce the suffer- 
ing caused by wanton injustice and thoughtlessness, 
society has taken it upon itself to penalize infringe- 
ment of the rights of others. Taking a cue from 
nature, which never allows an infraction of law to go 
unpunished, men have assumed the right to attempt 
to control selfish and thoughtless folk for the general 
good of all folk. Obviously, all offenses against 
society can not be punished; to punish the most 
flagrant keeps busy the machinery of the law.

ment besides that-of_protection;! these are the func- 
tions of expulsion, which is but a further measure of 
protection, and _expiation, which is an instinctive and 
universal concession to religious and ethical feelings. 
Formerly, society always referred its right to punish 
to divine sanction, although acting instinctively in 
self-defense. With modern self-realization, has come 
a tendency to claim frankly the inherent right to pro- 
tect itself and advance its interests; and in this new, 
common ground society finds a new strength, one that 
the old appeal to an unseen authority could not have. 
The right to punish is therefore the right of society 
to protect itself from the predatory individual. It is 
the right to offer the inducement of freedom for respect 
of others’ rights. It is the right to impress and illus- 
trate the immutable law of compensation, which asso- 
ciates good with happiness, and evil with suffering. 
It resides in the state, because the state is the embodi- 
ment of the social will, an intelligence with keenly 
self-preservative instincts. It resides in parents, who 
wish to see their children grow in goodness and become 
a blessing in the earth. It resides in teachers as theagents 
of the state and the trustees of certain special functions 
in the training of children, given over by their parents. 
The first thing for the teacher to rememberis that pun- 
ishment is a righteous means of ‘securing righteous ends;?

the offender. The same authority gives (p. 198) certainty, justice, 
and naturalness as the three characteristics of effective punishment.

thatit is a most important element in the scheme 
of school management, since its omission when de- 
served, and its unjust infliction, are both serious 
betrayals of the sacred trust imposed in the teacher. 
And a second fact to be remembered is that proper 
preventive measures will largely do away with the 
offenses which require punishment. 
Tue Motives FOR PUNISHMENT 
Considered historically, there have been four motives 
for school punishments, following the motives which 
have actuated men in their meting of punishment in 
other spheres. The earliest was simple retaliation, 
following the primitive notion of repaying an eye for 
kin eye. The relationship between teacher and students 
as almost that of master and servants, and any 
nfringement of rules was a personal affront to the 
lignity and authority of the master. It was punished 
in the same spirit in which parents upheld their au- 
hority by beating disobedient children — not so much 
r the good of the child as for the good of the parent’s 
ffended vanity. In spite of the littleness of the motive 
e method was an effective one for the time when 
hought moved slowly and when conscious social 
ligation had not developed in the minds of men. 
restrained through fear, it emphasized selfish ends, 
ad minimized social obligation; but its value to men 
las very great, for it did put a premium on considera- 
n for others and on self-control. 
With the substitution of courts of justice for personal 
ngeance in restraining the lawless, there grew up a 
ling that every offense had its expiation, and punish- Retaliation

ment became the price of a misdeed. This was a long 
step in advance of the old idea of punishment as per- 
sonal vengeance, since it made justice a universal, 
inevitable principle, theoretically operating whether 
or not there were one to enforce it. Society at large 
recognized its duty of championing all who were 
oppressed by superior force, and also its duty to protect 
itself by attaching a penalty to evil-doing. Similarly, 
the good pedagogues of a half-century gone published 
lists of what were to be considered offenses, and at- 
tached to each its expiatory penalty. It was their 
idea of dealing an impartial, and, so far as might be, 
an infallible justice. 
Sureness Now, in relinquishing the once cherished privilege 
eh auette of meting out an expiatory penalty for his brother’s 
misdeeds, men have not denied the principle of expia- 
tion. They have but yielded to the working of laws! 
that operate infallibly and universally, a function to} 
which neither the wisdom nor the power of men i 
equal. They know that he who breaks the laws o 
Nature and of Justice will surely suffer, even though, 
his breach affect no other human being. This sw 
ness of the _penalty of_ doin; wrong is very hard fo; 
There is a delay in the working out of consequence 
that leads youth to a fallacious assurance that al 
though others may suffer, there is for it a way of escap! 
from the punishment of evil. It is in the interest ¢ 
sound views and wholesomely rationalized prejudice: 
then, that men emphasize the inevitability of is 
ment, the impossibility of escape from expiati 
wrongdoing.
-P-A-G-E-185
  PUNISHMEN Fi 167 
In times characterized by much airy disregard for 
the fundamental laws of compensation, and by much 
disbelief in any positive standards of right and wrong, 
and by the confused ideas of moral obligation that are 
their sure consequence, it is needful that we keep in The protec- 
tion of 
society 
sight this old and unpopular truth. Punishment is 
to be administered as a means of social protection; 
even the motive of reforming the offender resolves itself 
in a last analysis, for the social authorities, into that of 
protecting and elevating the race. But society evades 
its duty if it does not also emphasize the individual’s 
duty to himself, and his relation to those universal 
laws of cause and consequence to which he is subject. 
He is not only to be restrained from doing wrong, but 
he is to be led to restrain himself from doing wrong; 
and in this ultimate duty of authority, a conviction 
of the inevitability of expiation, and its righteousness, 
is no small element. 
Existing with both the motives noted, but recog- 
nized rather later, was the motive of prevention. This 
was the social-protection phase of punishment. A 
murderer is put to death that other would-be murderers 
may be restrained, and human beings rest in compara- 
tive security. As a preventive measure, race experi- 
ence has given few expedients more effective than 
prompt, sure punishment. It is recognized that the 
delay and laxness of our courts in the United States 
are largely responsible for the shameful prevalence of

the interests or safety of many that one may be spared 
deserved pain, is one of the saddest examples we have 
of the working of maudlin sentimentality. The pre- 
ventive phase of punishment is one of its chief aims 
and justifications. 
What punishment aims to do for society it also aims 
to do for the offender. It proposes to protect him, by 
saving him from the worst and final consequences of 
his evil acts by visiting upon him without fail a restric- 
tive measure of pain. It follows the ancient and uni- 
versal laws of nature, which through the association 
of pain with the breaking of natural laws, lead men 
through self-interest to be law-abiding. This is the 
last and the highest motive for which punishment is 
given. It brings about reformation through: (1) the 
restraining influence of three agents, viz.: the actual 
pain inflicted of whatever kind — physical suffering, 
humiliation, deprivation of privileges or freedom usually 
enjoyed; through (2) the enforced contemplation of the 
nature of the deed and its consequences, which its 
serious treatment involves; and through (3) the by- 
products of punishment, the social obloquy and other 
losses which follow, or should follow, wrong-doing. 
Of the four motives, it is almost needless to add, the 
first has long since been abandoned as unworthy of 
enlightened human beings. The second, while it is 
recognized as an important element in punishment in 
its subjective aspect, is no longer offered as a justifica- 
tion for the infliction of penalties. Men have ceasec 
to consider themselves called upon to punish other me 
for the sake of balancing the moral scales. They ar 
not so cocksure of their judgment in ethical matter:
-P-A-G-E-187
PUNISHMENT 169 
as they formerly were. But to advance the safety and 
progress of humanity, and to effect the reformation of 
those whose conduct interferes with that safety and 
progress, sane men everywhere feel called upon to 
support the agencies that punish wrong In the school, 
similarly, the two great motives of punishment now 
recognized are the protection of the interests and ends 
of the school, and the reformation of delinquents. 
INDIVIDUALIZATION OF PUNISHMENT 
Criminologists are working upon the problem of 
' dispensing a truer justice than can be given by a literal 
enforcement of the criminal law. Circumstances and 
motives and the capacity for reformation vary so 
widely, that a strict application of even the wisest 
possible law may result in the defeat of the purposes 
for which that law was made. Saleilles says that there 
are three types of individualization, prescribed respec- 
tively by statute, by the judge, and by the prison 
authorities. In the school the teacher is law and judge The = teacher’s 
and warden, and has a knowledge of circumstances advantage 
and character that few of the authorities who try to 
reform grown offenders can hope to have. Here the 
material is more pliable, habit being still in the making, 
and love and hope and faith have a justifiable place 
in every decision. Unless he has been so foolish as to 
make threats, unless the Board of Education has lim- 
ited his authority, a teacher is untrammeled and can 
vary the treatment of each particular case to suit the 
real needs of the child. 
This individualization of treatment is absolutely 
essential to justice and helpfulness. No good teacher

exist primarily in the will of the offender, and the act

tion and wishes of the pupil. It would, for instance, be 
cruelly and foolishly unjust to mete out the same 
punishment to a half-grown boy who has played truant, 
and to his six-year-old brother who “tagged along.” 
There is another sense in which the term “‘individu- 
alization of punishment” may be used. The protective 
phase of punishment springs largely from the fact that

the consequences of sin are social. If A commits an 
offense, its consequences affect B, C, and D. These 
three persons suffer through no-fault of their own, but 
because of the interrelationship of social forces. If 
the fault of the sin lies with A alone — that is, if it be

a fault of selfishness, not of ignorance and weakness 
for which others are to blame — justice demands that 
as much as possible of the consequence of the act be 
transferred from B, C, and D, the innocent sufferers, 
to A, who is to blame. Individualization, then, in 
this sense, is the replacing of the punishment on A. 
But, if the offense is one for which society is to blame, 
then society is bound to suffer its share of the penalty, 
which it does by the working of an inevitable moral 
law. 
For instance: In an eastern city two boys were 
brought to a principal in a single week for carrying 
beer from a saloon to their fathers during the noon 
hour. There were ordinances against this, which the 
school authorities had found it necessary to use as a 
support for their own efforts to stop the evil. One 
offender was an American boy who knew perfectly the 
strict law against minors who entered saloons; the 
other a little Hungarian lad whose father was as igno- 
rant as he of the fact that he was breaking a law. In 
one case society had done its duty and the boy was 
made to suffer the extreme penalty. In the other, 
there was no formal punishment, for ignorance, which 
in law is no excuse for an infraction, is really the best 
of vindications where circumstances justify the allow- 
ance of the excuse. In one case, the punishment was 
made as individual in its application as the misdeed 
had been, while in the other the absence of the will to 
transgress, coupled with the fact that the boy’s environ- 
ment had not given him the knowledge that made such 
an act a misdeed to him, would have made a punish- 
ment an injustice. example

  Two cases 
When not 
to punish 172 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Let us take the treatment of whispering as an example 
of the individualization of punishment. In a room 
where whispering is rife, where the teacher’s attitude 
is lax and all the pupils are inattentive and idle, it 
would be the rankest kind of injustice to single out one 
child and punish him for a fault for which all his world, 
and especially the teacher, is to blame. -The punish- 
ment — poor lessons, bad habits, wasted effort, an 
inefficient school — must be borne socially, as it was 
caused socially. But in a school where the teacher has 
high ideals of attention and order and holds the pupils 
to them, a single boy who wilfully persists in annoying 
others by whispering should be severely dealt with. 
He has had every help and incentive to right-doing, 
and has chosen to transgress. The natural result of 
his offense is social, since many pupils suffer from the 
disturbance of his communication; but the object of 
his punishment is to individualize the penalty, to 
restrict it to the one person who is guilty. 
It has been said that the three objects of punishment 
are the protection of society, the expiation of wrong 
doing, and the reformation.of—the offender. For 
practical schoolroom purposes, perhaps, the objects of 
punishment narrow down to the first and the last of 
these three. When other people do not need protec- 
tion, when there is no prospect of reforming the of- 
fender through the infliction of pain of any kind, there 
is no object in meting out punishment. The culprit 
may be left to the natural punishment which is bound 
up in the nature of his transgression. But as there are 
few school offenses which will not, if uncorrected, result 
woefully for the school, and as human beings usually 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
PUNISHMENT 173 
need the stimulus of penalty to keep them from evil, 
there are really few cases where no punishment should 
be given. That punishment should always, as Spencer Spencer's 
says in his famous exposition, be proportionate to the ™s¢ple 
seriousness of the offense, as well as inevitable and 
prompt.! But there are some cases in which teachers, 
especially young teachers fearful of failure in their 
See For instance, 
Thany transgressions are due to ignorance ot to bad 
habits acquired through the carelessness or selfishness 
of others, in which justice demands that punishment be_ 
commuted when possible if the offender shows a desire _ 
osha aee Soa manifestly unjust, 
for instance, to punish a room for whispering or noisy 
movements, if a former teacher had allowed such con- 
duct under the cover of “spontaneity” or some other 
cloak for bad order.   
IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED CONSEQUENCES 
Nature punishes some offenses at once, and others 
after long waiting. The child who touches a hot stove 
is instantly burned, while he who eats too much pie 
and jam may not suffer from indigestion until after 
many years. Similarly, one boy who fails to learn his 
geography lessons misses promotion at the end of a 
term, while another passes, but loses a business oppor- 
tunity ten years later, because of his ignorance. In 
determining the punishment for offenses, therefore, 
teachers may choose between\immediate and deferred 
consequences. The question is one that rises‘ fre- 
quently, and one that has bearings so intricate and

perplexing that it is difficult to decide upon any very 
definite means of choosing between the two. 
The advantage of immediate punishment lies in the 
powerful effect produced by quick action and an un- 
mistakable association with the misdeed in Eitasaeal 
Ifs moral effect upon others is usually stronger for this 
reason than that—of—delayed punishment. The fax 
that the reconciliation following punishment, the 
resumption of cordial relations between teacher and 
pupil, comes so much more quickly when punishment 
is given at once, than when it is delayed, is an addi- 
tional reason for having it over with as soon as possi- 
ble. The depressing effects of the sullen or fearful 
anticipation of a child who looks forward to a com- 
ing punishment are felt often by all the pupils in a 
room, and preclude the friendly and cordial relations 
that should exist. 
On the other hand, delayed action has the important 
recommendation that it serve “at it serves the ends of justice 
rather more surely than immediate actio action. Hasty— 
judgment or sudden anger may prompt a punishment _ 
too severe, or mete punishment to the wrong person. 
Anger cools, and saving second thought brings many 
things to remembrance, with the passing of time. 
And, if the punishment be a just and severe one, suited 
to an offense of a serious nature (for which the delayed 
punishment is usually reserved), the delay may con- 
centrate public opinion upon the case, so that the moral 
effect of the punishment when finally executed is far 
stronger than if it had been hastily administered. The 
impressiveness of deliberate action, which weighs all 
considerations well before decision is reached, tends 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
PUNISHMENT 175 
to fix in the minds of those who observe it, the justice 
of the judicial process and verdict. A further advan- 
tage in delayed punishment is the opportunity for 
thought, given the culprit who awaits the deserts of 
his misdeed. 
Owing to the greater power of older children to keep )age asa 
in mind the association between a deed and its conse factor i 
quences, punishment may wisely be delayed for them, 
when its effect upon young children would be lost by 
delay. ( Little folk not only forget quickly, but often 
fail to seé relations of cause and effect at all) They 
associate the pain of punishment with whatéver hap- 
pens to be most related to it chronologically, not having 
learned by experience that cause and effect may be 
widely separated in time. This confusion is obviated 
when punishment follows a misdeed immediately. 
Children who are old enough for serious reflection, on 
‘the other hand, ‘“‘carry over” the connection between 
deed and consequence and think about it as long as 
the incident remains open. For this reason the serious 
_ offenses of older pupils should, as a rule, not be pun- 
ished at once, but left in a condition of suspended 
consequences for a time. Often the attention directed 
to them by the pupils themselves brings to the teacher 
valuable suggestions for the treatment of similar evils 
in the future, while the seriousness of the offense is 
emphasized. Slight offenses, of course, should be 
dealt with summarily. 
Many offenses belong to the category of habit-break- Nature of 
ing acts, which being neglected, undo the good work peer tens

and pupils. That instinct may aid volition, then, it

is important that an act which breaks the sequence in 
a habit-forming series be followed at once by painful 
) consequences. But if the offense be one of judgment, 
the mistake to be corrected is one of thought, and 
time should be allowed for contemplating the decision, 
that a reversal of the mistaken judgment may be made. 
An ana- A boy in a village school in South Carolina played 
Piatced truant one sunny afternoon, took a horse from his 
uncle’s stable, and rode far into the woods in search 
of nuts and mushrooms. In coming home the horse 
stumbled over a log, and was returned quite lame, 
late in the evening. After a consultation between the 
principal and the boy’s uncle, it was decided that he 
should be punished at once for his truancy, since 
regular attendance was a habit that he should not 
have allowed to lapse. But the reparation made to 
his uncle was left for him to decide, and he was given 
a week in which to think about the matter. At the 
end of that time he announced that he would work 
for his uncle after school, giving up basketball and ten- 
nis, until he had paid him in work the bill of the veteri- 
nary who treated the horse, and the value of the horse’s 
services lost because of his lameness. 
Certainty as © Again, unquestioned offenses, the lapses from habit- 
er ual order which are undoubtedly subversive of the good 
of the school, may well be dealt with summarily. But 
where any doubt whatever exists concerning. the plac- 
ing of the blame, or concerning the justice of blame, 
it is safe and just to delay judgment until the question 
of equity is assuredly answered. 
It is hoped that the foregoing considerations may be 
of help to tapchers in deciding the difficult alternative 
a -

of prompt and delayed punishment. But no rule 
that will always apply can be formulated. Chance 
circumstances may affect the policy used in ways that 
can never be foreseen. In general, however, it is safe 
to say that unless some circumstance points clearly 
to the wisdom of delaying judgment and punishment, 
that they should follow the misdeed as quickly as 
possible. 
SUMMARY 
f The functions of punishment are to protect society 
from those inclined to exploit it for their own interest, 
to satisfy the demands of justice by expiation, and to 
reform the offender. : 
Offenses should be punished in the light of the motives 
prompting them, and the punishment should be visited 
upon individuals or upon society in accordance with 
the fixing of blame. Immediate punishment should 
follow offenses when there is need of emphasizing the 
connection between a deed and its result, but with 
older children delayed punishment may be more im- 
pressive. age of the offender, bis motives, and 
the certainty or uncertainty of his guilt are factors in 
deciding upon immediate or delayé nt.

PUNISHMENT (Continued) 
UNDESIRABLE PUNISHMENTS 
THE primitive ideas of government by force and 
obedience through fear are not so far from every one 
of us as we may flatter ourselves they are. They are 
still dominant in the teacher who punishes by threaten- 
ing further punishment. It is true that punishment 
follows sin as its right and natural consequence; but to 
secure right conduct through imposing a dread of pain 
is to cheapen righteousness without strengthening it. 
When a teacher see$ fit to direct his pupils to do a 
thing, let him do so. It is not necessary to state the 
penalty for disobedience, and to do so presupposes a 
possible transgression. Children follow suggestions 
instinctively —they are an irresistible challenge to 
their imaginations.; To say, oe not do this, or such 
a thing will happen to you,” is to give a dare that 
spirited ed children are quick to take.y Besides, to attach 
a price to a transgression is to put it among the pur- 
chasable’ things. ~ Many ¢ “children, and many grown 
people as well, hi have an idea 1 that they have a moral 
right ‘to commit any ‘sin they choose if they pay the ” 
price for it. Let things forbidden be forbidden abso-— 
lutely, and let direction rest upon its real authority as 
the best expression of the will of society which the  
-P-A-G-E-197
  PUNISHMENT 179 
teacher can give. If the law be transgressed, then, 
the teacher has not bound himself to any course of 
action. He may punish as seems most wise and just, 
untrammeled by preconceptions of the nature of the 
offense. 
The tasks imposed as punishments are of two classes Tasks 
— those which are extra lessons, and those which are 
entirely different from the usual school work. The _ 
Tatter_are sometimes advisable, the former never. 
For instance: John had idled away the half-hour given 
him for studying his spelling-lesson, and in conse- 
quence had missed half the words. He deserved 
punishment for his idleness, and he needed to learn 
his spelling-lesson, therefore his teacher kept him after 
school. This extra session probably punished the 
teacher more than it did John, but if the teacher 
chooses to give extra time to her task she has a right 
to do so. Her first impulse was to say to John: 
“John, you may go when you can spell the words in 
this lesson correctly, and in addition ten from the next 
column.” 
Such a penalty, however, instead of changing John’s 
attitude toward his work, would but intensify it. He 
who before thought spelling a bore, would class it now 
as an imposition. Work, which teachers want to make 
attractive, is reduced by such means to the plane of 
an activity for malefactors. John’s teacher said to 
him: 
“You wasted the half-hour which the other children 
used for learning this lesson, and so you must take 
another, which they have for play, in which to learn it. 
Then you wasted the recitation-period by writing a   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-198

  180 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
list of words spelled wrong, and now you must redeem 
that time by writing the list correctly. I’ll pronounce 
the words for you when the time comes.” 
She then began to work on a set of papers which 
she had to correct, while John set himself to learn the 
spelling-lesson. In ten minutes’ time he had mastered 
it, and asked if he might not recite. 
“Certainly not,” replied the teacher. ‘The half- 
hour which you wasted is not yet redeemed. I will 
call upon you when the time comes.”’ As a rule chil- 
dren should not sit idly, but this teacher made John 
sit quietly during the remaining twenty minutes, which 
ticked away like so many hours for the impatient boy 
in the long, still room. Only the occasional rattle of 
the papers on the teacher’s desk broke the silence. 
Once John heard his team, at basket-ball practice in 
the schoolyard, give a yell for Somer, who was taking 
his place as center. The half-hour was gone finally, 
and he wrote the list of words correctly at the teacher’s 
dictation. 
“Was the time long?” asked the teacher. 
“T should say so. Ages,” replied John. 
“All of it?” 
“Well, I didn’t notice it until I got the lesson learned. 
Then it just dragged.” 
“Was the lesson the hard thing, then?” 
“Oh, no. I got a lot of fun out of learning that 
lesson as fast as I could, because I thought you’d let 
me go when I had it. It was the rest of the time that 
I put in that I didn’t like. Doing nothing is hard work, 
like you said once.” 
“But you can learn your lesson in ten minutes any  
-P-A-G-E-199
  PUNISHMENT 181 
day, and spend the rest of the time at the library 
table or the sand-map. You might as well have the 
fun of doing that every day, as to waste the period 
and then have to lose your play-time.” 
John thought this over a moment. 
“T think I get the idea, Miss Thomas,” he said. 
He had, indeed, “got” a new idea of spelling lessons. 
He had also been appropriately punished for his wasted 
and misspent half-hour. 
Writing long words or phrases dozens or hundreds 
of_times, memorizing poetry, working extra problems 
in arithmetic, drawing maps, and looking up references 
are bad forms of punishment. They are bad, because 
to _disgraceful_drudgery,confute the hardly-instilled 
idea of the dignity of labor, induce mental phlegmatism, 
and_are both too easily-borne and too ordinary for

1A careful distinction is to be made between the use of lesson- 
tasks as punishment, and the requirement that lessons be mastered 
before they are left. Thorough teaching requires that a neglectful 
or deficient pupil be kept at his work until it is as well learned as 
possible. In the incident just given, for instance, the learning of 
the spelling-lesson was not a punishment; the detention for the 
extra twenty minutes was.

could be more unfortunate than to change the w! 
some “idea that to serve is an honor—Such punish 
ments, moreover, are subject to the further criticism 
that they give to manual labor an unpleasant or even 
disgraceful connotation. There are sufficient means of 
punishment to be had without recourse to the expedient 
of using the pleasant, helpful school tasks in this way. 
Detention during the time which is supposed to be 
free from formal school work is a very common punish- 
ment. It is used for two main purposes, the perform- 
ing of regular lesson tasks which should have been 
mastered during the study period, and as an absolute 
punishment for misdemeanors. The first of these 
punishments is discussed in the following pages. The 
second seems to be rarely if_ever justifiable, for these 
reasons: Tae aha ee 
1. It infringes on time needed for the outdoor play 
absolutely essential for normal children. It cheats 
the physical side of the child’s development. 
2. It lengthens the already long hours of the teacher’s 
schoolroom employment. He, also, needs outdoor 
exercise. 
3. It is unbusiness-like. Schools should close as 
promptly as they open, except for pupils who need 
extra help or time for the main object — the school 
work. 
4. It makes a prison of the schoolroom, giving it a 
lastingly unpleasant connotation. 
5. If idle, the pupil is forming a bad habit during 
the time of detention. If engaged in a school task,
-P-A-G-E-201

  ¥ PUNISHMENT 183 
he is forming the wrong idea of work. If allowed to 
do something he likes, he is not being punished. 
An especially pernicious sort of punishment is to Depriving 
deprive a child of good marks already earned by good eared : 
recitations or other good conduct, as a punishment for 
bad behavior. This method may indeed give a very 
effective check to misbehavior, for many bright children 
who value a high rating can be reached through a low 
grade quickly and easily. But the essential injustice, 
as well as the illogical confusion of two more or less 
distinct elements in the school record, has a demoral- 
izing effect upon the developing sense of justice and 
appropriateness. For instance, in one school a teacher — 
gives her pupils a zero for that day if she has to correct 
them during the recitation. As a consequence, the 
brightest boy in the class received 65 one month as a 
grade in algebra, because, having finished his problems 
before the rest, he could never resist the temptation 
to play while waiting for the others to finish. As 
there were good but slow pupils in the class whose 
grades were higher than the star pupil’s, the teacher’s 
judgment and justice were called into question. No 
explanation of the basis of grading could quite excuse 
so flagrant a discrepancy between the boys’ work and 
the estimate of it given in the grades. The grade 
given for a study should represent the pupil’s ability 
in that subject. Separate markings should show his 
deportment, if it is thought best to include that in the 
regular report. 
There is a class of punishments now so rare as Personal 
scarcely to deserve mention here, but which were once indenters 
common in public schools. These were the penalties
-P-A-G-E-202
  Saturation 184 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
whose essential feature was personal humiliation. 
They _included_the wearing of dunce caps, seating 
pupils on a dunce block, gagging (an old punishment 
for whispering), pulling hair, twisting ears, callin; 
names, dressing boys in girls’ clothes, and placing 
children in ridiculous and undignified positions for 
the school to laugh at. Humiliation is, or should be, 
part of all true punishments; but it should come from 
a realization of the loss of selfsrespect that follows on 
wrongdoing, and not from a crude action on the part 
of the teacher, the person above all others who should 
be a model of dignity to the children under his care. 
A very common method of punishment is to force the 
culprit_to commit his offense until he has become” 
thoroughly tired_ ‘of it) when its association will be so. 
unpleasant that he is presumed to be cured of the desire 
to repeat it.” Arnold’ has given the name of “Satura- 
tion” to this method. It is only moderately effective, 
and can be justified upon scarcely any psychological 
grounds. For instance, a boy who is humming under 
his breath is discovered, and set before the school 
with instructions to sing. He does one of three things. 
He may sing, in a spirit of bravado, to the delight of 
his classmates and the defeat of his teacher, as long as 
they have time to listen. He may be really ashamed, 
and obey slowly and reluctantly, in a faltering voice. 
He may be terror-struck or defiant, and absolutely 
and persistently refuse to obey. In the first case the 
punishment obviously fails to be a remedy. In the 
second it is an effective punishment, and the child may 
refrain from a repetition of the offense through a fear 
1 School and Class Management, page 303.   
  
  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-203
PUNISHMENT 185 
of consequences, which is better than no cure at all. 
But the reason for refraining from humming in school 
has not appeared in the punishment. The teacher 
can not really object to humming in school, argues 
the child, for she took time to have singing, which 
interfered with the school work far more than humming 
does. And there can be nothing intrinsically wrong 
with humming or singing in study time, or the teacher 
would not have a boy, even a bad boy, do it. In the 
third case the teacher has complicated her problem 
by increasing the offense, for which she must, if her 
authority is not to suffer, further punish the child. 
On the whole, the method of punishment by saturation 
is seldom advisable.

Doubtless it is not too severe for this sort of offense, 
but beyond its severity the penalty has little to recom-

lesson. Not the boy’s mouth, but -the boy’s soul, 
his character, has been polluted. The tying up of 
' feet that have strayed in forbidden places, the sealing

Sarcasm 
ridicule 
  186 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
The least desirable of all punishments, perhaps, is 
the use of sarcasm and ridicule.“ Tis is because it" 
destroys the first requisite for success in the teacher- 
pupil relation, which is confidence and friendliness.   
  
Sarcasm may occasionally, with pupils old enough to 
understand the point made, be effective in reforma- 
tion; but young children understand the sting without 
catching the point. Ridicule has even less excuse. 
The only legitimate use of ridicule in the schoolroom 
is as a last resort with an inordinately conceited or 
impertinent child; and even then better means are 
usually to be found. In ordinary cases sarcasm is 
but a mean and self-indulgent means of venting the — 
ill-nature of a teacher, and can not be condemned too 
severely. Ridi indicates a fundamental and lam- 
entable lack of sympathy with childhood, which takes” 
     itself very si dts hurt,-above all thing all things else; 
at levity in the ‘attitude of others. To laugh with 
children is to be eternally o have found the 
secret of joy; but to laugh at chi is the first sign of 
a bitter old age. 
DESIRABLE PUNISHMENTS 
Colgrove! gives, as legitimate negative incentives, 
the following classes of punishments: Reproof, public 
and private; loss of privilege; restitution, in cases of 
injury to property; detention to perform a neglected 
task; suspension, and in extreme cases corporal punish- 
ment and expulsion. The same authority gives the 
following rules for all punishments, which sum up 
pretty accurately the test to which disciplinary measures 
1 The Teacher and the School, page 390.
-P-A-G-E-205
    PUNISHMENT 187 
should be put. ‘All punishments should be used,” 
says Dr. Colgrove, “only as temporary expedients to 
supplement positive incentives. Whenever possible, 
they should be the natural outcome of the pupils’ 
misconduct. They should be just, proportioned to the 
gravity of the offense as measured by inner motives, 
not the outer act. They should be educative and 
reformatory; and they should be economical, not 
drawing unduly upon the nervous and emotional 
energy of either teacher, school, or offender.” 
With some such limitations in mind as this category 
imposes, we wish to enumerate some of the means of 
punishment which are constructive in effect, reforma-_ 
tory in nature, helpful to the individual punished, protective with reference to others. 
The social nature of the school and of our natural Isolation 
instincts furnishes the cue for what is perhaps the 
most logical and effective of all punishments for older 
children, and at the same time one of the best reforma- 
tory measures. As a rule, children do not like school 
primarily because they like the lessons, but because 
they come into contact there with a great number of 
eager young people with whom they have a multitude 
of common interests. They lend themselves readily 
to the direction of teachers so long as their own wills 
do not clash with the guiding will for the school, or 
until the unity of the school life is broken by outside, 
opposing interests. That is, so long as the social organ-_ 
ization of the school is satisfactory, so long as all con- 
    
tribute to its general purposes, there can be no trouble. 
But if one pupil ee by opposing his will

the social organization loses its effectiveness, the work 
or play halts, goes limping where it should go smoothly, 
or in extreme cases is altogether stopped. 
Groups of children in their play have arrived in- 
stinctively at the sensible solution of the problem of 
the unsocialized individual. If one child refuses to 
play according to the rules, and can not be coérced into 
obeying them, he is excluded from the game, and may 
play by himself or not at all. The number in the 
game is less, but the unity of the playing group is not 
broken. Usually the child comes back after a time, 
because the incentive offered is greater than the satis- 
faction of maintaining his independence. If he do 
not, the pleasure of the group has not been sacrificed 
to the pleasure of one; the greatest good to the greatest 
number has been realized. 
Similarly, in the school, when one pupil or a group 
of pupils refuses to comply with the regulations which 
are made for the good of the whole body, there are 
two methods of dealing with them. They may be 
forced to comply, or they may be excluded from the 
social body of the school, and from the advantages 
that come from the school’s social organization. In 
the earlier part of their school life, it is better to force 
them to comply, for habits are being formed at ‘this 
time, not rationally, but by suggestion, imitation, 
and compulsion. But when the age of ing is 
Scand, eis ot Wilh to Gece welled ha drén under the control of the reason and of high ideals, 
the force of a controlling will is largely withdrawn, 
and the pupil left free to make his own decisions. 
At this point it is important that the social nature of  
-P-A-G-E-207
PUNISHMENT 189 
the school, its dependence upon the loyal support of 
each member, be made thoroughly clear, and with 
that the advantages of this combination of forces, 
the fruits of codperation. Plainly, it is not fair that 
those who tear down the fabric should enjoy its ad- 
vantages. They shut themselves out by their own 
action. They may justly — justly to the larger num- 
ber — be excluded from the social activities of the 
school until they are ready to agree to abide by the 
tules of the game. 
There are several practical ways of using this punish- 
ment of isolation. Troublesome pupils may be seated 
apart at the back of the room, where temptation is 
reduced to a minimum for all concerned. Refusing 
the privilege of oral participation in class exercises 
and general exercises, and of the privileges usually 
given to pupils (discussed more fully in the following 
pages under the head of deprivation of privileges), 
and giving a separate recess, as long as the regular 
recess but at another period, are ways of applying 
the principle of isolation as a punishment and 
corrective. 
The reporting to parents of the misdeeds of children 
is-one of the punishments the wisdom and efficacy of 
which depend very much upon local conditions and 
individual circumstances. Some parents agree to be 
responsible for their children’s behavior, and wish to

have full and frequent news of their progress and 
standing. Others turn them over, body, mind, and

only. However, it is fair to parents that they should 
know when their children fall below the standard in 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  Igo DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
any way, and the reception of the first report shows 
the teacher what leverage there may be in the parental 
attitude. With many children a report of wrong- 
doing to their parents is the most effective way of 
preventing a repetition. 
The feeling of social solidarity may be further 
utilized in building up traditions and customs of 
mutual responsibility, which go far toward eliminating 
the necessity for formal punishment. Children can 
be made to feel responsible for one another’s conduct, 
and so take upon themselves, voluntarily, a degree of 
control which helps to develop their social natures 
and the feeling of social obligation. In attendance, 
for instance, if there be a conscious pride in having a 
good record for the whole room, each boy and each 
girl will make it his business to know why a classmate 
is absent; and if there be no good reason for the ab- 
sence, to bring back the delinquent. The he disapproval 
of his fellows is the most effective of all punishments; : 
public opinion is among the strongest of all goads to 
action or incentives for restraint. The school in which 
“the will of the whole body of pupils is bent toward” 
good work and good order is an ideal state in little, a 
microcosm of the millennium. ® A form of punishment which conibines the good 
qualities of theoretical equity and effectiveness, is 
taking away the privileges of pupils.’ Freedom is 
rightly possessed by those who use it well; restriction 
is the penalty for selfish and harmful behavior. Some 
of the privileges which children appreciate, but of 
which they may be deprived as a punishment without 
interfering with their more important duties, are:   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-209

1. Passing books, pencils, etc., and collecting the 
same. 
2. Going to water-bucket, waste-basket, or dic-. 
tionary without special permission. 
3. Playing with other children, or being a member of 
athletic teams. 
4. Reading at the magazine table after finishing 
lessons. 
5. Leading the line when marching, or exercises at 
recreation time. 
6. The privilege of reciting in class. This is a 
rather severe punishment for children who care much 
for their standing or whose interest in school work 
shows itself in the natural desire to talk about it. 
The teacher’s ‘I can’t call on a boy who can’t respect 
other people’s rights,” or “You have forfeited your 
right to talk in this class, Joe, until you can prove to 
us that you can talk at the right time,” is a punish- 
ment that most children feel keenly. The lesson 
need not be lost on this account, as the teacher may 
require that it be written out and handed in for credit. 
It does not therefore work an injustice by reducing 
the grade or taking away all incentive for study. 
7. The privilege of being a class officer or repre- 
sentative, or contestant for the school in an inter- 
scholastic contest. 
With very small children, there are many ways of 
driving home the alienating effects of disobedience or 
other unsocial conduct, which older children would 
vigorously resent were any teacher so unwise as to 
try them. Conformity to custom and to the standards 
set for them is a strong characteristic of little folk. Punish-

Punishment 
to be 
avoided 
  192 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
To be deprived of the privilege of wearing their best 
clothes on Visitors’ Day, for instance, is the most 
severe punishment that can be inflicted in a great 
public institution where the children wear uniforms. 
In many primary rooms, an effective punishment is 
to make the culprit stand for fifteen minutes in a 
circle chalked upon the floor. One teacher binds a 
small towel lightly over the faces of naughty boys and 
girls, because she ‘“‘can’t bear to see the faces of bad 
children.” Another has a “naughty bench” out of 
sight behind the piano, where there is ample room and 
light for study, but where disturbing elements in the 
school may be safely isolated. 
In some German schoolrooms, where each child has 
a little pot-plant all his own (a delightful custom, 
which might be adopted in American schools to ad- 
vantage), this is taken away as a punishment, and 
kept in another room until better behavior wins it 
back. Putting boys into girls’ clothes, or reversing 
the process for girls, is undignified even in primary 
schools. To put a boy into a corner, with a paper 
cap upon his head labeled “‘Bad Boy” (a modification 
of the old Dunce Cap) is no punishment at all for the 
soldierly lad, and a humiliating means of losing self- 
respect for others. The old expedient of standing 
children in corners should be sparingly used. It is 
an exhausting form of punishment from the physical 
point of view, and is especially dangerous because it 
is hard to find employment for the child, who some- 
times emerges from such an experience farther from 
reform than he was before. 
This aim of punishment should always be held in
-P-A-G-E-211
PUNISHMENT 193 
mind: the punishment that does not bring the offender 
nearer to the goal of responsible effort to do right, 
has at least partly failed, even though that punish- 
ment succeed gloriously in its good offices to other 
people. The ineffectiveness of much thoughtless pun- 
ishment is illustrated by a story of the small son of a 
well-known Chicago educator. This man came home 
one day to find his little boy in tears. Being asked 
what was the matter, the sobbing boy finally made him 
understand that he had missed the words in his spelling- 
lesson. 
“But don’t cry over that,” urged his father. ‘You 
can learn them now. It isn’t too late.” 
“But that isn’t all,” continued the little boy. ‘The 
teacher shook me, too. And the worst of it is, father, 
that I didn’t know the words any better after she shook 
me than I did before.” 
The deprivation of privilege sometimes appears in 
odd forms in a primary school. For instance, a very 
successful teacher sometimes declines to wear a pretty 
pink gown, which the children especially love, when 
they have been rude or selfish. Almost all primary 
teachers use the corresponding positive incentive, 
wearing bright and pretty waists or frocks to please 
the children. A big Teddy bear, which ordinarily 
sits on a little chair near the teacher’s table in one 
primary room, comes down to visit the children and 
sits demurely beside them when they have been good; 
but disappears in the big closet when they have been 
noisy or rude. A teacher of immigrant children in 
New York utilizes the adoration of her charges for 
American heroes, by taking down the picture of Lincoln

    Restitution 194 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
when a serious offense has been committed, or when a 
general attitude of mischief mars the day’s work and 
play. The same act would scarcely, one fears, be a 
punishment for American children. 
The logical punishment for vandalism and theft is 
restitution. To mend the damage done as perfectly 
as may be is the very least that an offender can do. 
Further punishment is sometimes advisable, especially 
when restitution is accomplished without appreciable 
sacrifice on the part of the culprit. A boy from a 
wealthy home and the son of a day-laborer were 
playing ball in a forbidden court of the school premises, 
when the ball went through a large pane of glass. 
The mother of the rich boy sent a glazier at once to 
repair the damage, paying the entire expense. The 
father of the other boy wished his son punished for 
disobedience, which seemed to him the real sin. The 
teacher decided that both boys deserved a punish- 
ment for their disobedience, and proceeded to admin- 
ister it. The mother who had paid the bill objected, 
saying that the damage was repaired and that the 
matter should therefore be dropped. She thought her 
son had been harshly and unjustly treated. -The 
incident illustrates the impression that is liable to 
ensue when restitution is regarded as the only necessary 
sequel to such a deed.

If all ordinary means fail, there still remain the Suspension 
extreme measures of isolation — suspension and ex- 
pulsion. A child is practically suspended whenever 
he is excluded from his classes; this is done sometimes 
by the individual teacher. It is plain that suspension 
gives no leverage for raising the pupil, unless he has 
a reason to fear its effects. If he misses classes for 
several days, he may fail that month, and perhaps for 
the term or year; but that is no incentive to good 
conduct, unless he wants to pass. ftp amily and personal 
pride are the teacher’s best allies here; and also the 
disgrace of suspension. Suspended pupils should not 
be sent home, but should be kept in the principal’s 
office or some other place at school, while word is sent 
to the parents of what has happened. This does not 
apply to the pupil who may be trusted to do what he 
is told to do; but that sort of boy is not the boy who 
is suspended, as a rule. The suspended boy rarely 
goes home when sent; he seeks, with telepathic sure- 
ness, the haunts of the street loafers who will listen 
sympathetically to his tale of woe, and strengthen his 
resistance by justifying it. Even if he goes home, he 
is less likely to find the needed corrective guidance 
and suggestion there, than in some place under school 
control., Sometimes a talk with some business or 
professional man, preferably a board member, will 
send the culprit back to his work with a new point of 
view and a new resolve to do the right thing. There 
must be a plan of reformation, however; do not turn 
a suspended pupil loose on the world at this critical

time. The enforced idleness of a long wait in the 
principal’s ante-room gives a chance for thinking that 
prepares the child for the final interview. 
At this interview the parents or guardians of the 
child should hear the story of the offense, first from 
the teacher and then from the child, after which 
the conditions attached to receiving the child again 
into the school should be stated fully. A frank talk 
usually results in a better understanding and in the 
reinstatement of the offender. Teachers can often 
tell parents wherein they fail in their duty toward 
their children, and parents can often return the com- 
pliment. 
If a child is really unfit to attend the public school 
he should be removed. Expulsion is only for those 
boys and girls who are utterly unfit to be associated 
with other children. They are the degenerate, the 
hardened young offenders who corrupt the manners of 
their schoolmates, those who will yield to no ordinary 
means of control and cause constant trouble. To 
allow incorrigibles to remain in school, of course, is to 
encourage constant anarchy. There are other places 
for such children. 
The expulsion of troublesome pupils may be managed 
in such a way as to strengthen the authority of the 
school. Where the pupil expelled has been a notorious 
offender, a certain degree of publicity, with no smooth- 
ing over of the disgrace involved, will do something 
toward counteracting his bad influence upon the school. 
The secret trial is seldom wise, except in cases where 
sensational disclosures would but feed an unhealthy 
appetite for scandal. Cases of expulsion should be  
-P-A-G-E-215
  PUNISHMENT 197 
treated very sericusly, deliberately, and with a view 
to the moral effect of the action taken. 
The case of the very bad boy is not disposed of when 
he has been excluded from the public school. Released 
from its restraint, he is in a fair way to do more harm After _ 
than ever, unless he is put into some institution where °7?™/Sio 
he has a chance of reformation. To turn him loose 
in the streets is but to transfer his operations from a 
small field to a large one, and from one in which his 
good behavior is the definite business of someone, to 
one in which no one is delegated to look after him. 
The other half of the duty of the school authorities 
is to see that steps are taken toward the committal of 
such an offender to a reform school or other special 
institution, where special facilities and teachers may 
effect a change beyond the power of the public school 
to work. 
CoRPORAL PUNISHMENT 
Corporal punishment is generally regarded as a 
last resort among means of correction. It may save 
the day when all else fails, and so must not be read out 
of the list of possibilities; but it is dangerous, anti- 
quated, and uncertain in effect. It is, as its opponents 
claim, a primitive means of control, unsuited to moder 
ideals of government and to highly developed 
sensitive children. Many pupils in the pi

sin. They must tread, at least in part, the upward 
path traversed in generations past by the ancestors 
of more favored children, who evolved high ideals from 
experiences that abounded in knocks and cuffs. Where 
the methods of a past age are the only ones that will 
accomplish the work, there they must be used. The 
great task is to bring about the ends of the school; 
to be compelled to use harsh means is unfortunate, but 
to fail is a calamity.

people, while rejoicing that the era of the hickory rod mis a

some children are not amenable to persuasion, spares 
physical pain rather than use it to secure the ends

it has been crystallized by some unjust or brutal case. 
To guard against this, especially in cities where the 
political situation imposes on the schools careless, \f

regulations which prevent hasty action, and which 
make it necessary to have witnesses to such punish-

striking the hands with a light ruler, are some of the 
means used with refractory children, which do not 
injure but do smart. The humiliation of being struck 
is, for most American children, far deeper than the 
physical pain is severe. This is especially true when 
punishment is given before other children — a proce- 
dure which some educators heartily condemn, while 
others contend that, since the offense is an offense 
against the school, that the culprit should be disgraced 
before his fellows, and the lesson impressed upon them.

SUBSTITUTES FOR CORPORAL PUNISHMENT 
All that has been said must not be construed as a The appeal 
recommendation of corporal punishment; it is but a oon 
frank statement of the necessity of meeting primitive 
minds with primitive arguments, and a justification 
of the occasional use of crude means to attain an 
all-important result. One of the most difficult prob- 
lems facing teachers today, is that of finding an effica- 
cious substitute for corporal punishment, where this 
method has been used until pupils and parents expect 
no other. An example of such effective substitution 
comes from southern Illinois, where a young girl, 
fresh from college, was engaged to teach a country 
school somewhat notorious for its troublesome big 
boys. The district had been in the habit of employ- 
ing young men, who usually managed to maintain a 
fair degree of order and industry after flogging a few 
of the ringleaders of the unruly set. After a number 
of small misdemeanors, for which the new teacher 
found means of correction without recourse to corporal 
punishment, the oldest boy in the school committed 
an act of wanton vandalism so flagrant that all the 
other children said that, ‘Teacher will either have to 
whip him or give up.” 
The teacher had no mind to fight the battle of 
organized society, of law and order and culture, against

this audacious young outlaw, single-handed. She had 
been waiting for some such occurrence to begin a well- 
planned campaign. She made her position on the 
matter clear to the school by giving it a quiet and very 
earnest talk upon the obligation of citizens toward 
the property of the state, ant ‘upon the sin of wanton 
destruction. The younger children were duly im- 
pressed, although they had no conception, even after 
explanation, of what “the state’ meant. But the 
offender, although he listened respectfully, started 
home that night with an air of triumph. He had not 
been whipped, and he boasted gaily to his schoolmates 
that he would not be. He thought the incident 
closed, with the balance on his side. 
The teacher went to her boarding-place, called up 
each of the three directors, and bade them meet at her 
house that night for an important meeting. This, in 
itself, was a bold departure; no country school-teacher 
had ever called the directors together for a meeting 
in that vicinity before. The president was not sure 
that his dignity and prerogatives were safe — but he 
promised to go. Every family in the district knew 
what had happened by supper-time. The school, 
the teacher, and the offense were the topics of con- 
versation that evening. 
The teacher repeated her talk on vandalism to the 
directors. She added an outline of what she was 
trying to accomplish in the school. Having gained 
their approval for her program, she came back to the 
problem, this time in its more general phases. She 
reminded them of the reputation of the school, and 
appealed to their pride to help her change it. She

the boy who had offended, declined to have anything 
to do with the case for fear of a family quarrel; the 
other two, partly from curiosity, promised their sup- 
port. 
“Then,” announced the teacher, “we will bring 
this matter up at an open meeting at the schoolhouse 
tomorrow night. Since Mr. Jones wants to be excused, 
Mr. Scammon and Mr. Hough will be the judges. I 
will present the case, and all who wish to attend may 
come, for this question concerns the whole district.” 
“T’ll bet his father’ll be there,” remarked Mr’ 
Scammon. 
“Of course —I should hope so. He is surely more 
interested than anyone else in his boy’s behavior,” 
replied the teacher. 
The news of the meeting to decide Henry Jones’ case- 
spread rapidly through the district. Mr. Jones, the 
director, held a long conversation with his brother 
over the telephone, on his return from the meeting, 
in which all the details of the occurrence were re- 
viewed, Henry standing sullenly at his father’s elbow 
to tell his tale. The father, although he admitted 
that Henry had done wrong maintained that the 
teacher was “no good”’ who would make so much fuss 
over such a thing. : 
“Why didn’t she whip him and be done with it?” 
he inquired belligerently. “That ain’t no way to 
teach school.”

would raise the taxes to carry out her plan. They 
did not carry it out very fully, as it proved, for this 
very reason. But the ideas there brought to that 
country community for the first time have taken root 
in the minds of the people, and some day they will 
bear fruit. The teacher, on closing her school the 
next May, wrote out for her own satisfaction the 
results that had already come from her course with 
Henry Jones. The list read as follows: 
1. It interested the whole neighborhood for once in Some 
the school. oe 
2. It shifted the responsibility of dealing with an 
offender from the teacher to the Board. This was a 
good thing in this case because: 
(a) It awakened the Board to its responsibility 
for the school. 
(6) It reminded the people that their elected 
representatives are the proper school au- 
thority. 
3. It put the Jones family in a humiliated position 
in the community; and Henry will not be allowed to 
repeat such an offense. 
4. It gave me a chance to talk to the people about 
an improved school. 
5. It helped make Henry a better boy. 
(a) He was impressed by a new idea — that 
being bad in school is an offense against the 
community, not a successful attempt to out- 
wit the teacher. 
(6) The anxiety of the night and day of suspense 
seems to have matured him. He is more 
thoughtful.

(c) His public promise to do better gives me a 
firmer hold on him than I could have won 
from a proved ability to “lick” him. 
(d) He had to repair the damage done. He has 
experienced the weight of the law, and has a 
new respect for it. 
The moral of this example is that the majesty of the 
state is more impressive than the smart of the rod. 
The hard thing is to devise means of giving the pupils 
any conception of the great power of organized society. 
They can see the teacher, who is but one human being, 
perhaps easily frightened, weak and incompetent; 
but they can not even imagine that all the people in 
their community own the public school and mean that 
it shall be a success. If this truth can be brought 
forcibly to the pupils, and to the parents also, the 
necessity for corporal punishment can thereby be 
greatly reduced. 
™ Corporal punishment has been done away in some 
schools only to give place to a substitute far more 
demoralizing in character. Words ‘cut deeper than 
blows, and the sharp reproaches and heartless taunts” 
heard in some schoolrooms destroy friendliness and 
ambition far more effectively than a severe whipping. 
There is a kind of honor in taking a merited punish- 
ment; most children suffer such without resentment, 
because their own sense of justice supports its infliction. 
But no child endures an abusive harangue without 
bitter inward resistance. The teacher who descends 
to the use of diatribes to secure order has lowered his 
dignity to the point at which the respect of pupils 
ceases; and his removal from the teaching force is
-P-A-G-E-225
PUNISHMENT 207 
the best thing that could happen to that school. One 
sees this evil at its worst in any great school system 
where numbers of ill-trained teachers are retained 
year after year because political conditions are such 
that they can not be dismissed. They are teachers for 
whom the appalling problems of a city schoolroom offer 
no solution so effective as corporal punishment; denied 
that by strict rules, they take refuge in a course of 
diatribe that produces results as thorough, while re- 
maining within the letter of the law. The teacher who 
taunts pupils with their stupidity or their foreign extrac- 
tion, who applies abusive terms to them, scars charac- 
ters in a way that makes the pain and humiliation of 
even a severe whipping, a light thing in comparison. 
There is a way of talking to pupils who have done 
wrong, however, which is much used where formerly 
corporal punishment served, and usually with good 
results. This is the kindly and serious discussion of 
an_ offense and i , immediate” and remote; 
followed by an appeat, or a Statement of the condi none

it, before going farther. 
2. By showing the consequences of such actions, 
both to himself and to others, secure a frank statement 
from the child that he is wrong.

3. If possible, arouse in the pupil a sense of remorse 
for his offense, since this gives an emotional reén- 
forcement to the resolve to do better. But be very 
careful that this feeling is a genuine one, not a pretense 
intended to “work” the teacher. The admission of 
wrong-doing is necessary; sorrow for it is of great 
help, but should be voluntary, secured by suggestion 
rather than requirement. 
4. Require now a promise that the offense shall not 
be repeated, and register this promise in a book kept 
for the purpose, the promise signed and dated, and 
witnessed by the teacher. 
SUMMARY 
Threats, school work, detention during recreation or 
rest periods, depriving of marks earned by good work, 
personal indignities, “saturation,” and the super- 
“appropriate” penalty, are not helpful forms of punish- 
ment except in rare cases. Tongue-lashing is the 
worst of all punishments in its hardening and vitiating 
effects. All punishment should answer the require- 
ments of justice, reformation, and economy. Among 
those which are effective in gaining these ends are 
reproof, isolation, wisely and temperately used; reports 
to parents and to higher authorities; the humiliation 
| or disgrace of a group of which the offenders are mem- 
| bers; deprivation of privileges, restitution where it is 
appropriate and just, and in extreme cases, corporal 
| punishment, suspension and expulsion.

justifiable. But a rational presentation of the nature 
and effects of the offense, with a parole system and a 
set of records which act as a check upon the tendency 
to repeat it, will often be as effective as corporal punish- 
ment even with stubborn delinquents. The appeal

  CHAPTER XII 
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 
PREVENTIVE DEvIcES FouNDED UPON THE MODE 
oF ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY 
Tue teacher who takes no chances begins by plan- 
ning the life of his school in an orderly and detailed © 
way. (Before the school begins he has decided on the 
order of entering and leaving the room, on signals for 
all the movements of classes, on regulations for leaving 
the room, and for the use of the dictionary and other 
reference works, and on the manner of using and caring 
for blackboards and other apparatus. \ It is especially 
important that the merging of exercises and the inter- 
missions between classes be planned to go smoothly 
and as quietly as possible. He goes farther than the 
planning of the normal life of the school, and decides 
on a course of action to be followed instantly when the 
usual offenses occur, as they are fairly sure to do. 
This preconceived plan of action may need to be 
changed when the moment comes, owing to unusual 
and unforeseen circumstances; but if it be reasonable 
and based upon successful experience, it will hold in 
all ordinary cases. Even to make a slight mistake in 
the manner of correction is less dangerous than to let 
the offense go uncorrected, or to commit the greater 
blunders that are liable to occur when one acts upon
-P-A-G-E-229
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 211 
the impulse of the moment. Quick action usually 
prevents recurrence. The more thoroughly all emer- 
gencies are provided for, the more sure is the teacher’s 
hold upon the situation. Unless he has an unusually 
orderly and retentive mind, he will find it worth while 
to write out both the administrative and the corrective 
devices that he proposes to use. These he should 
keep to himself, however, never mentioning them to 
the school until the occasion for their use comes. 
Children respect a teacher who seems always to know 
just what to do under all circumstances. The man 
with a plan is always master of the situation. Those 
people who seize opportunity are not as a rule people 
of lightning-fast brain processes, but people who have 
slowly and carefully worked out, ahead of the need for 
it, a plan of action for each situation that may arise. 
If this part of the teacher’s work is thoroughly done 
in the lower grades, the good habits there established 
will be so fixed by the time the pupils reach the gram- 
mar school, that the work of rationalization and the 
development and training of new powers soon to assert 
themselves, can go forward unimpeded. ) New problems 
arise constantly, to be sure, so that the necessity for 
prevision is never absent; but it may be minimized in 
upper grades if the primary teacher be thoroughly 
“forewarned — forearmed.” 
The disciplinary value of the fire-drill may be men- 
tioned in connection with this topic. The concen- 
trated activity, the mental alertness and self-control 
that are developed in the fire-drill make it a valuable 
exercise, entirely apart from its value as a safety device.

fire, when the value of prevision has a vivid and im- 
pressive illustration. 
The idea of the position and authority of the teacher 
which children acquire from their families and asso- 
ciates, is often very crude and inadequate. This is 
natural in a new country, in which social and official 
classes and distinctions are still in a state of flux. 
Teachers can do much to remedy this condition, which 
is responsible for a poor spirit in many schools and for 
a variety of specific offenses, by clarifying in the minds 
of the pupils their relations to their teachers. This 
will tend to build up in the next generation that solid 
respect for the school as a social institution, which 
will make its work more effective than it has been or 
is now. There should be no foolish self-deprecation, 
no self-conscious timidity, in this process. The teacher 
who is not worthy of the finest respect has no business 
in the profession;)\the teacher who shrinks from the 
delicate but necessary task of educating people who 
need it, to an appreciation of his position and the 
dignity of his work, is begging the question in just the 
way that will perpetuate the condition that we deplore. 
Frank talks with pupils on the organization, purpose, 
“backing,” and importance of the school system, will 
tend to increase the earnestness and sincerity of their 
work, and eliminate petty resistance to the necessary 
routine. 
The ideal teacher is a benevolent despot in his school. 
His authority should be unquestioned, his use of it 
wise, helpful, and limited. Children should be encour- 
aged to help themselves and solve their own problems, 
but when a question comes to the teacher for settle-   
     
-P-A-G-E-231
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 213 
ment, the decision must be carefully considered and 
just enough to be final. Here is one of the places in 
which the thoroughly trained teacher has an immense 
advantage over the teacher of limited education. 
Knowledge does give power. Knowledge wins the 
respect of children. Sympathy, quiet authority, and 
real knowledge that does not need to seek recourse in 
bluffing, win the hearts of pupils. 
An essential prerequisite for good order in schools is 
a friendly relationship, or at least an unquestioning co- 
operation, between the teacher in charge and his chief. 
It is the business of the teacher to carry out the plans 
of the principal, supervisor, or superintendent as fully 
and as conscientiously as possible. If he thinks the 
plan a mistaken one he has every right to object — 
stating his protest, not to the pupils, their parents, or 
other teachers, but first to the chief in question, and 
later if necessary to a higher authority or to the Board 
of Education. If the objection is not sustained, the 
teacher has the alternative of resigning or of carrying 
out the will of his chief. Unity and codperation are 
as necessary among the teachers of a system as among 
the pupils of a room. 
Summary means may be used to put a stop to cer- 
tain bad influences which often demoralize a school- 
room. There are minor laws in most states, for in- 
stance, which make it a serious offense for a child to 
enter a saloon. The law is often badly enforced, as 
are laws against the selling of cigarettes to minors, and 
others of like purpose. A determined teacher, acting 
personally or through officers of the law, can usually 
put a stop to illegal selling. A candy store near a Official

schoolhouse is a more serious problem, for there are 
no laws against the selling of candy, although the adul- 
terated stuff sold is often a serious menace to health. 
All of these evils, with the picture-play theater and the 
vaudeville house and the electric arcade and other 
diversions, should be examined and passed upon by 
teachers at frequent intervals, and all possible means 
to control or eliminate them, if harmful, pressed into 
service. 
PREVENTIVE DEVICES FOUNDED UPON THE MODE 
OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE 
Complai- The simplest way of securing good behavior from 
ae pupils through the use of personal influence, is to ask 
it as a personal favor. Pleasing the teacher is usually 
a strong motive with very young children, with foreign 
children to whom the school opens up a new and won- 
derful world of which ‘‘Teacher” is the guardian angel, 
and with all children of an amiable and obliging tem- 
perament. It is not an evil motive, but it becomes 
inadequate after a time, being too narrow in its results 
to be depended upon as a life-motive. Without being 
superseded, it should gradually become subordinate to 
higher principles. Where these higher principles fail 
to function it may still be employed, even with High 
School students, but always with the end in view of 
developing a broader basis than personal loyalty as an 
actuating motive. Pretty teachers with winning man- 
ners, who depend upon their personal charm to secure 
results in the schoolroom, fall short of well-performed 
duty in failing to generalize the willing response to 
their appeal.  
-P-A-G-E-233
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 215 
The more permanently effective use of personal influ- 
ence is so to emotionalize fine ideals that children are 
impelled to adopt them into their scheme of living. 
There are two processes here — first, the clarification 
of the ideal, the mere explanation of the significance of 
the words that stand for the idea; and, second, a 
strong and varied emphasis upon it, that shall present 
it so vividly and constantly as to make a permanent, 
emotionalized, conduct-compelling ideal. 
The most successful way of doing this is to arrange 
a definite program, by which one virtue after another 
is brought to the children’s notice for concentrated 
attention. Sometimes two virtues are studied together. 
In a public school in Brooklyn where this system is 
used, the following program was used in 1910-11: 
September — Cleanliness and Clean Language. 
October — Obedience and Self-control. 
November — Kindness and Gratitude. 
December — Courtesy and Friendship. 
January — Industry and Thrift. 
February — Patriotism and Duty. 
March — Honor and Loyalty. 
April — Honesty and Truthfulness. 
May — Peace and Quietness. 
June — Courage and Perseverance. 
July — Sincerity and Temperance. 
August — Cheerfulness and Love.!

in a little book describing the Brownlee system. Copies of Miss

The virtues to be studied are dwelt upon in short 
periods of concentrated thought, the pupils being en- 
couraged to express their ideas about them. Stories 
from their experiences or observation that illustrate 
the motto of the month are brought in; the mottoes are 
placed conspicuously on the board in each room of a 
school, and posted on large sign-boards in the halls. 
Every means is used, in fact, to emphasize the virtue 
under consideration without direct preaching on the 
part of the teachers. 
Strengthen- | The personality of the teacher is, after all, the greatest 
eine factor in the mode of control through influence. The

DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 217 
  hoods. Children who have been notoriously trouble- 
some in public schools, when transferred to the schools 
conducted by the teaching orders, often become model 
pupils, yielding respectful and unquestioning obedience 
to the sisters in charge. Pupils who have attended 
such schools attribute their attitude to the reverence 
in which the sisters are held. Their costume and 
manner of living, suggesting always the fact that they 
are set apart from the world and have devoted their 
lives to religious service, give them a peculiar sacred- 
ness in the eyes of their pupils.. This feeling is as a 
tule fostered by all the influences of environment, so 
that to disobey a sister appears a far more heinous 
offense than to disobey any lay authority. So effective 
is the fine respect which training engenders for the 
teaching nun, that it functions as a deterrent among 
those whose natural and acquired tendencies are all 
toward mischief. 
If the secret of the success of the teaching nun lies 
in the fine respect and reverence which her calling 
evokes, may not the situation in our public schools be 
improved by bespeaking for the lay teacher a degree 
of respect consonant with the importance and sacred- 
ness of her calling, and by insisting that these teachers 
be such as command the respect of all? Certainly, 
in point of devotion to duty and allegiance to the trust 
imposed in them, a great throng of lay teachers fall 
little if any short of the women who have taken per- 
petual vows. Yet parents fail grievously to instil into 
their children the idea that to disobey such a woman 
or to cause her trouble is an impropriety not to be 
dreamed of. To expect any such millennial change in Respect

the attitude of the public is to engage in idle day- 
dreams, except as it may be hoped for as the result of 
an improvement in the teaching force, not beyond the 
scope of present possibility. This is not to say that 
teachers should or can ever command the reverence 
which is paid to the woman who gives up her life to a 
distinctly religious service. It is simply to emphasize 
the fact that an appreciation of the high calling to 
which teachers devote their time deserves, in itself, a 
degree of honor which is not accorded to them at pres- 
ent; and to suggest that, were teachers as a class as 
conscious as they should be of the dignity of their 
position and the requirements of character and prepara- 
tion that their work asks of them, the respect so com- 
manded would go far to solve the problems of adminis- 
tration that are now so vexing. 
The attitude of some teachers, usually young and 
ill-prepared ones, which resents the name of “teacher” 
and the connotation of the calling, deprecates the 
value of the service they give, and is satisfied with the 
standards of the people with whom their lot may be 
cast, has its own ill effect upon the standing and work 
of the school. Fine character in the men and women 
who make our schools we must have. Great en- 
dowments, fine equipment, stately buildings, varied 
curriculums, and elaborate organization are nothing if 
culture, dignity, and nobility do not characterize the 
people whose work is the very heart of our free 
educational system. 
“Character” is so general and inclusive a word that 
it includes many of the requisites for teachers; the 
rest may be included if we add to the first requirement
-P-A-G-E-237
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 219 
another, namely, that a teacher be trained for his 
work. Many good men and women have failed igno- 
miniously, in spite of the noblest traits of character, 
because their training had not fitted them for the 
special work of education. Every kind of training that 
a teacher has is of worth and use, directly or indirectly, 
in a modern school. People are beginning to see that 
the great work of bringing up children can not be 
intrusted to people who have not studied the subject 
specially. 
Between natural gift and engrafted skill, the teacher 
should embody in his own personality the essentials 
of success in discipline, providing conditions are at all 
fair. A compilation of characteristics which make 
almost certainly for failure in schoolroom management 
is not hard tomake; examples are too plentiful! Here 
is a list of ten types of teachers who can hardly hope 
to succeed: 
1. The teacher too ignorant and crude to command 
the respect of his students. 
2. The conceited or bigoted teacher, whose preten- 
sions or narrownesses provoke their derision. 
3. The weak-willed teacher. 
4. The teacher ignorant of working devices. 
5. The teacher whose life outside the schoolroom 
does not command the respect of pupils or townspeople. 
6. The teacher who descends to the level of his 
pupils, treating them with easy levity and familiarity; 
and the gossip. 
7. The taskmaster and the tyrant.

  The 
voice 220 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
8. The teacher who wants, above everything else, 
to be popular. 
9. The lazy teacher. 
1o. The threatener who does not “make good.” 
In this connection the teaching voice is important. 
Quiet manners in teachers are of immense value, and 
a low voice pays especially good dividends on the in- 
vestment of care and training that its acquiring means. 
Americans have proverbially unpleasant voices, and 
the strain of constant use to which the schoolroom puts 
the vocal organs spoils many a good one. Teachers 
who are conscious of having the harsh, high-pitched 
voice which raises the nervous tension of the school- 
room, need to take systematic steps to develop lower, 
richer, clearer tones. Imitation will help more in this 
matter than anything else. Listen to the rich, sweet 
voice of an English woman of good breeding — not 
necessarily of high class. The beautiful voices of the 
English and German peasants are a revelation to 
Americans. Find, then, first of all, a person who does 
have a good voice, and listen daily if you possibly can. 
Notice the pitch, the intonation, the repose, the placing | 
of the voice. Make yourself sensitive to tone-quality 
by observing the voices of the people among whom 
you live. Observe every means of reminding yourself 
of your effort, in order that constant practice may aid 
in the formation of your new habit of speech. Apply 
all the laws of habit-formation, in fact.1 The new 
power which a fine voice gives, together with the

hearing, is more than worth the trouble that it costs 
to re-form the voice after reaching years of maturity. 
And every good voice is an element in the removing 
of a national reproach.

fulness that no time or attention is left for mischief. °“°™ 
It is founded upon the belief that there is, even for the 
most wilful and mischievous child, some wholesome 
activity whose appeal is stronger than the desire to 
create a disturbance or satisfy a selfish wish. The 
means of occupying the time of high-school pupils 
have been enumerated in the discussion of this mode, 
and need not be repeated here. There are three sets 
of activities which should be possible to school chil- 
dren, to fill the time of three periods in their day. 
First, there should be ways in which to spend the time 
left over after lessons are prepared, without disturbing 
the school. Many bright children acquire lazy mental 
habits because the preparation-time allowed for aver- 
age pupils (the class from whose abilities the school 
takes its standards of requirements) is more than they 
need. They dawdle in preparing their lessons because 
they do not need to hurry, and because there is no 
incentive for concentration and close application. The 
time remaining is probably wasted in play that brings 
no good results, unless means for activities of a helpful 
sort are provided. In the lower grades, all forms of Redeeming 
busy-work, including sand-table and clay-box, may the ime 
keep little hands out of mischief. In the upper grades,

a reading-table supplied with supplementary reading- 
books, magazines, and pictures prevents trouble. The 
duty of the cleaning-squad is to keep halls, steps, and 
grass-plot free from paper, and to report to the teachers 
and janitors spitting, marking of premises, and disorder. 
This squad may be made up of pupils of high standing 
who have permission to slip out of their rooms when- 
ever they have finished their lessons, to attend to 
their duties. In country schools, older brothers and 
sisters may be permitted to help the little folk with 
their writing, spelling, or busy-work, thus keeping both 
employed while the teacher gives her attention to the 
recitations of the other pupils. 
In the Jena practice school there are seven pupil- 
officers in each grade, whose duties are respectively: 
1. The care of boards and sponges. 
2. Dusting the teacher’s table and chair. 
3° Opening the windows at recess to flush the room 
with fresh air. 
4. Changing the date on the large calendar-pad. 
5. Keeping clean water in jugs and glasses. 
6. Filling ink-wells. 
7. Care of books and note-books in the class-cup- 
board. 
Besides these class officers, who are chosen in order 
in a weekly change, there are others appointed for the 
semester to put away and take out maps, rulers, books, 
and other things not in constant use.t The children 
learn to take care of valuable things, and are benefited 
by the sobering effect of responsibility. The teacher,

moreover, gains much time otherwise expended upon 
mechanical work which is not a means of growth to 
him, to put upon reading or study which will make his 
work better. This work, remember, is to be done in 
school hours as a part of the school work, and not to 
be taken from playtime, except perhaps on very rainy 
days, and where there is no roofed playroom. 
The attention of pupils is likewise to be wholesomely 
employed during recesses, and before and after school. 
Supervised play is a comparatively new element in 
American education, but it bids fair to eliminate a great 
deal of evil. The children in many country and village 
schools simply do not know how to play. They stand 
or sit around at intermissions, gossiping and staring 
idly at each other or at passers-by. They need to be 
taught lively games, organized into teams, forced 
really to play until they form the habit and do it spon- 
taneously. There are several good books upon the 
play movement, and texts describing games and the 
delightful folk-dances which children love and which 
arouse an interest in the people of other lands. 
Third, the teacher may sometimes have some con- 
trol of home time. It is not wise to attempt this 
unless it is plain that conditions need bettering, for 
where the home still seems fairly adequate for its share 
of child-training responsibility, it should be let alone. 
But if children are allowed to be upon the streets or in 
places of harmful amusement, during the evenings, the 
school may lessen the evil by providing home work and 
recreation that will occupy the evenings. Especially, 
it is the duty of school authorities to set and preach a 
standard of opportunity for boys and girls who are Recreation

trying to learn lessons at home. The secret of far too 
many failures is that parents neither provide a separate 
study-room, nor see to it that quiet reigns in the family 
living-room during a definite and strictly observed study 
period. Games, gossip, the visits of neighbors, the cry- 
ing of babies, the discussion of family problems, go on 
unchecked where young people are trying to force their 
flighty attention to unfamiliar subjects. The ideal of 
a regular study hour, with enforced quiet and steady 
application, may often be set before parents with such 
promise of its good effects for their children, that they 
adopt it readily and gladly. 
INTEREST AND DISCIPLINE 
All devices for crowding out evil by occupying well 
the recreative periods of school life, dwindle into com- 
parative insignificance before the great, fundamental 
problem, the greatest of all — that of creating so real 
and so intense an interest in the essential work of the 
school that petty distractions will have no power to 
gain attention. In spite of the thousand new elements 
in school training, fads that pass or essentials whose 
importance we are but just beginning to realize, — 
things illustrative, cultural, recreative, — there persists 
always a core of solid, fundamental school studies 
which all sane teachers aim to keep dominant through 
every temptation to sacrifice them. They are essential 
because of the universality of their need. All men and 
women need them; they are the foundation-require- 
ments. Such subjects as reading, writing, necessary 
number, the laws of health, the ability to speak our 
own language correctly, some knowledge of the history
-P-A-G-E-243
  
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 225 
and geography of the world and especially of our own 
country, and the fundamental principles of ethics — 
these things are the essentials in the common schools. 
They are to be sought first, and other things added to 
them. 
The “other things,’ however, are not the bait in a 
trap or the chocolate coating on a bitter pill. There 
is matter of intrinsic interest in every department of 
knowledge, and the most essential things may be made 
really interesting, as well as the many other branches 
which enrich the curriculum. Just at the core of posi- 
tive, constructive good discipline lies the art — it is an 
art — of making the essential things, the most neces- 
sary studies, attractive. Although every study has its 
own intrinsic interest, the appeal of some studies, such 
as music, manual training of all kinds, drawing — those 
studies in which eye and hand are actively engaged — 
is more immediate, more enhanced by quick reward, 
than studies whose value children can see with difficulty 
if at all. They must accept these on faith; and these 
are usually lowest in easily aroused interest. The 
teacher’s problem is to find and show the points of 
appeal, to emphasize positive incentives, to make his 
pupils realize the desirability of the art or the informa- 
tion for which they are working. If real interest can 
be aroused, he knows that the wholesome pursuit of 
knowledge will crowd out evil. 
There is a question-begging substitute for a real 
solution of the interest problem, which we are very 
liable to use in these days when so much is done to 
give variety and pleasure to school life. This is a 
dependence upon the easily aroused interest in the Essentials

to the

-P-A-G-E-244
226 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
lighter studies, rather than sincere seeking of the 
intrinsic interest in the more difficult subjects. Chil- 
dren may be taught to endure grammar, arithmetic, 
and spelling, for the sake of the drawing, cooking, or 
bench-work in which they take a ready delight. They 
are hustled through the history lesson, which they find 
“dry,” because it is easy to hold their attention during 
the music lesson. This is wrong. ‘‘This ought ye to 
have done, and not to have left the other undone.” 
Each study has its own interest, which teachers should 
find and demonstrate. There are teachers who excuse 
themselves for slighting a study because they ‘never 
liked it themselves.” This is intellectual cowardice 
and inexcusable laziness. It is a childish and narrow 
policy. A poorly taught child may have an excuse for 
disliking one or more studies, and most people master 
easiest those which they like best; but the teacher, 
unless a specialist, owes allegiance to all subjects 
included in his own curriculum. He has no business 
to hand on his own subject prejudices to his pupils. 
He is committing a sin which will inevitably be reflected 
in the spirit and work of his school. 
The real Lack of interest shows itself in weariness and lack 
pone of attention. There is a false and a true weariness, 
however, and the first thing necessary is that the 
teacher learn to distinguish between the two. True 
weariness or fatigue is caused by the using up of energy, 
and comes when attention and effort have been con- 
centrated upon work until the child’s resources are 
exhausted. There are two common causes for this 
true fatigue when it occurs in school, both originating 
and to be corrected at home, if possible. The child 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 227 
may be too poorly nourished to have strength for a 
reasonable amount of work. Where dire poverty is 
the cause, as in large cities, the school lunch seems to 
be the only logical remedy for this evil until economic 
and social conditions change. A bowl of hot soup and 
a thick slice of bread may turn a stolid, weak-willed 
child into a willingly, brightly attentive one. Where 
malnutrition comes from poorly selected and cooked, 
rather than insufficient food, education of the mothers 
is the remedy — not very easily realized, to be sure. 
Within another generation, however, when the girls 
now studying cookery have become the homemakers, 
this evil will grow appreciably less. The second cause 
is too heavy home work, or outside work which keeps 
the child up late at night. 
So much for real fatigue. But the greater problem 
is the weariness, not of exhausted but of unapplied 
resources. It is the boredness which causes children 
to throw aside their work from sheer lack of interest 
in it, and to feel that the lack of interest is a legitimate 
excuse for their neglect of it. It is unfortunate that 
there has grown up with the Doctrine of Interest, a 
mischievous heresy which accepts just this excuse. 
Teachers who allow such excuses to stand, do so at a 
sacrifice of character as well as of work quality. All 
good work is interesting. Find the interest, hunt it 
out — but if it eludes pursuit, the work is still to be done. 
When pupils are not interested, the fault may be 
their own or the teacher’s. If it be the teacher’s, his 21 
first duty is to master the art of presentation, to lay 
the lures that tickle curiosity, to supply the means of 
arousing interest. This involves the whole field of False

special method, which of course can not be discussed 
here. Four causes of lack of interest, however, are so 
common, and consequently so influential in the sphere 
of discipline, as to deserve mention. First, the pres- 
entation may not be sufficiently vivid to arouse even a 
mild initial curiosity, in which case no child can be 
blamed for not wanting to pursue so unpromising a 
subject. The slavish use of textbooks is largely to 
blame for the inefficiency of teachers in giving assign- 
ments and hearing recitations, as well as the over- 
crowded condition of our schools, which forces many 
good teachers to do their work in a mechanical way. 
American teachers do not teach. They hear recita- 
tions. Our texts are usually good, but in the hands 
of teachers who shift to them the whole responsibility 
of instruction, they are a source of weakness, not of 
strength. Good texts can never take the place of good 
teachers. As professional training increases, the evil 
of textbook dependence will be reduced. Probably 
most teachers have remarked that if nine things be 
studied from a book and a tenth told by the teacher, 
the tenth fact is the one that is remembered on exam- 
ination day — or any other day. The greater vivid- 
ness of viva voce presentation is the reason. 
Poor equipment is another cause of poor interest. 
Geography lessons without maps, history lessons with- 
out pictures, drawing lessons without variety of models, 
all are liable to be dry and tedious. The improvement 
in school work and spirit, lasting sometimes for several 
days, upon the installation of a new globe or dictionary 
or picture, has been remarked often. Not only in the 
lessons in which they are used, but in every phase of
-P-A-G-E-247
  
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 229 
school life, is felt the stimulus of a new incentive to 
effort. 
The assignment may not be problematic. It may 
hold out no lure, beckon to no new land, have no 
mystery to solve, no real difficulty to surmount. Red- 
blooded children resent ‘‘an easy one,” or one which, 
perhaps difficult enough, offers no prize for the seeking. 
The assignment is the key to the interest situation, 
because if skilfully made it holds out, in the lesson to 
be mastered, a puzzle to be solved or a prize to be 
won. It makes a promise of something worth working 
for, and in motivating effort gives to it a character 
that makes it the solution, the very best solution, to 
the discipline question. But if the assignment be a 
dry and hopeless announcement of the pages in to- 
morrow’s sentence, there is little or no interest to ab- 
sorb the healthy curiosity that children have. They 
must satisfy it in some other way, find another exercise 
for their energy than hunting up answers to fascinating 
questions. 
Last, the work needs to be correlated with other work, 
and to take hold on life, both in and out of school, by 
many tentacles. It must be applicable, timely, con- 
crete, alive. 
Having used the means at his command to make the 
work intrinsically appealing, the teacher’s duty to 
interest is performed, and the pupil’s begins. But the 
teacher’s duty to his pupils is not performed; it may 
be but just begun. For it may be that after the teacher 
has done all that time and resources permit, the werk 
still remains uninteresting to the pupils. The natura}

self-centeredness of childhood, or the attitude of the 
home or the community in which the pupil lives, may 
prevent a response to the lures to interest thrown out. 
If this be the case, and especially if the child seeks to 
excuse idleness or lack of preparation with “I just 
can’t seem to like it,” + the absolute authority of the 
teacher should be brought into requisition. That 
child should be made to apply himself. There is a for- 
tunate psychological law in accordance with which 
interest is aroused automatically upon real application 
to the subject, and this interest grows until real weari- 
ness checks its increase.? He who defies the lack of 
interest, and pursues a subject in spite of it, sometimes 
finds a wealth of interest as his reward, and always 
enough to repay the effort. 
It is worth while to teach children this law in a 
simple way, by means of simple reminders upon appro- 
priate occasions, or by a motto kept always before 
them. But more important than the incentive to 
reward is the ideal of faithfulness to duty that may 
be taught whenever lessons are distasteful and dry, 
as some lessons are sure to be even under the most 
skilful teachers. It is good to have our lines fall in 
pleasant places, but whether they do or not, the ‘next 
thing” is to be done, faithfully and thoroughly. Dis- 
like is a shameful excuse for failing to do one’s assigned

are sometimes very hard to control, having become used to constant 
amusement and attractive activities. The newer kindergarten 
methods aim to overcome this artificially aroused demand for 
entertainment.

duty. Good soldiers are faithful, obedient, dependable, 
_in every kind of weather, under all circumstances. 
Much, very much, of sound old-fashioned Puritan 
devotion to duty we need to preach, suggest, practice, 
and illustrate, if our schools and our nation are to 
fulfil their trust. The age is one of self-indulgence, 
and a deplorably soft pedagogy has exalted personal 
liking over sensible requirement. We have, however, 
an immense advantage over our Puritan ancestors in 
that we know the psychological laws which guarantee 
the rewards of adherence to duty. To teach these 
rewards does not lessen the strength of the first admoni- 
tion. It illustrates a moral law that should be deep- 
graven in the consciousness of all people —Jé pays to 
be good. 
GENERALIZATION AND SUMMARY 
Preventive devices may be based upon any of the 
modes of school control. Those founded upon absolute 
authority utilize the position and authority of the school 
and teacher, the organization of the school system, and 
the instinctively recognized right of age and experience 
to direct the young. In using personal influence as a 
mode of control, a teacher appeals to the wish to please, 
makes his wishes known, and uses the resources of his 
personality in an endeavor to secure the development 
of his pupils. ~Personal strength is the great asset in 
the use of this mode, and the two elements making 
that personal strength are character and training In 
controlling school conduct by the mode of wholesome

the time of the regular session after lessons are learned, 
and occasionally at home. Many occupations besides 
regular lessons help to keep children out of mischief 
and afford valuable training. But the great problem 
is to find the inherent interest in the essential work, 
and so make that truly the greatest thing in the school. 
Four causes of lack of interest are poor presentation, 
poor equipment, poor assignment, and lack of correla- 
tion. The laws of compensation are the teacher’s 
great ally in securing earnest and sincere work.

DISCIPLINARY DEVICES (Continued) 
CorrecTIVE DrEvices FOUNDED UPON THE MODE 
or ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY 
In general, it may be said that all the devices of the 
disciplinarian are preventive devices, since their object 
is to prevent either a first offense or the repetition of 
a misdeed. All the means mentioned in the preceding 
chapter may be used to correct bad habits or tenden- 
cies, as well as to guard against their first appearance. 
The present chapter will discuss some specific means 
employed to correct abuses, where the offense is either 
serious in itself, or has become so fixed that it assumes 
the proportions of a serious problem. The discussion 
is necessarily very limited, only the more common and 
troublesome problems being selected as examples. 
Brief suggestions for corrective treatment are made 
in the enumeration of offenses in another chapter, and 
also in the chapter on Punishment. 
Perhaps no problem is more nearly universal than 
that given by pupils who leave the room during school 
hours too often and stay too long. This method has 
been found successful in a large city school, where 
careless management had brought about an abuse of 
the privilege: 
Time spent out of the room is called “Lost Time,” 
and pupils are expected to make it up. The justice Prevention

and reasonableness of this is explained to the pupils 
by the teacher. A card is kept in a pocket by the door 
used by girls and boys respectively in entering or leav- 
ing the schoolroom from their cloakrooms. The card 
is printed at the top in this way: 
  
  
NaME Lert RETURNED Mave Up 
    
  The date is printed at the top of the card, a different 
card being used each day until the evil is reduced, 
when one card may serve for several days. The child 
enters his name and the exact time at which he left 
the room and returned to it. He may make up the 
time at recess or after school, or even let it go for sev- 
eral days and make up all he owes on one evening, 
when he wishes to stay and study; provided he does 
not let it go for more than one week at a time. When 
the time is made up the teacher checks off the charge. 
The cards are kept for reference, and sometimes give a 
valuable record. Small books may be used instead of 
cards. If a pupil does not keep his record honestly, 
he is not allowed to leave the room without explicit 
permission, and the teacher or a monitor keeps his 
record for him, which is a great disgrace. 
The method just described is suited only to the 
correction of an habitual and widespread abuse of the 
privilege of leaving the room. Where the evil is con- 
fined to a few pupils in a room, there should be an” 
inquiry as to the cause of the condition, with individual 
treatment for each offender. When a child leaves the 
room a great deal he may require medical attention,
-P-A-G-E-253
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 235 
or he may find some attraction more strong than the 
schoolroom work. Where the evil is pronounced there 
is mischief afloat, and teachers should do some detective 
work to find what the counter-attraction is. Strict 
rules, well enforced, against loitering in cloakrooms, 
lavatories, and halls, will materially help. 
Whispering is an offense whose treatment must be 
graded according to the maturity of the offender and 
his motives. The methods which fix habits among 
small children, curing the evil by substitution, will not 
be successful among older children, whose schoolroom 
conduct is controlled by the will rather than by sug- 
gestion and imitation. The instances given in the fol- 
lowing pages illustrate the difference in the methods 
used with little and with older children. 
Since whispering among little children is caused 
usually by the excess of energy not absorbed in as- 
signed work, the first remedy is to give the whisperer 
enough work to keep him busy, and the kind of work 
that will keep him interested. If he still continues to 
talk, his offense is due to a habit of aimless chatter or 
to a deliberate intention of annoying school and teacher. 
In either case isolation is the appropriate and effective 
remedy.) Lonely people become silent; a persistent 
‘chatterer may be reduced to silence by solitary confine- 
ment. Giving the whisperer a seat at the back of the 
room or in a cloakroom or office (providing, of course, 
it be warm and light) for a sufficient length of time 
to make a real impression, is an effective method. 
Many teachers put such a child away from his fellows 
for a half-day or even a shorter period. Upon his 
return he may be a little more careful, but he cannot Whispering
-P-A-G-E-254
  When

be cured. If made to sit by himself for a week, he 
would form a habit of silent attention to business that 
would, with care on the teacher’s part and endeavor 
on his own, hold through the renewed temptation of 
close association. While isolated from other pupils 
the teacher must take especial pains to provide plenty 
of worth-while work, and adequate play with other 
children at recesses, or the last state of that pupil may 
be much worse than the first. 
When whispering is rife among practically all the 
pupils of a room isolation is not a practicable remedy. 
A universal habit has the sanction of public opinion as 
an individual’s habit has not, and is therefore more 
difficult to deal with. In the lower grades the play 
instinct may be utilized in the organization of some 
sort of competitive game, simultaneously with the 
forming of a prejudice against whispering as an evil 
thing. The introduction of an objective stimulant 
may be necessary. One teacher divided her school 
into two rival sides and promised a Saturday nutting 
party to the side which first achieved two successive 
days without whispering. To avoid the watching that 
usually destroys the good effect of such contests, she 
counted only such whispering as she herself saw, 
marking the offense on a score-card on the front board. 
The children became interested and worked hard. The 
teacher had hoped that the two sides would tie on the 
result, but one side easily won the picnic. The win- 
ners voted, however, to invite their rivals if they could 
equal their own feat by the end of the week, and when 
they failed by two points, invited them nevertheless, 
stipulating that the losers were to provide ice-cream
-P-A-G-E-255
  
DISCIPLINARY. DEVICES 237 
for the crowd. This philanthropic denouement largely 
destroyed the good effects of the contest, by slurring 
the advantages of earnest effort. After the picnic the 
hardest part of the struggle came. With no immediate 
reward in view, there was a strong tendency to lapse 
into the old noisy, careless*habits. An honor roll, 
proved a weak incentive, the children asking for “‘some- 
thing real.” The teacher had to work hard to create 
an atmosphere of condemnation for whispering, of 
approval for attention and quiet, of pride in an orderly 
room. She had to punish by taking off a certain 
amount from the deportment grade for each offense. 
She had to go through the disciplinary process in all 
its phases, in fact, to cure the disease. But-she had a 
partly established habit, a precedent of several very 
quiet days, to aid her, and decided that the contest 
had been a good way of starting the reform. 
A new high school principal in an Indiana town 
found his assembly room demoralized with whispering. 
Taking the ground that whispering in a study room is 
an evil for which there is no reasonable excuse, and 
that it is a source of disturbance serious enough to 
warrant stopping the work which it interrupts, he 
entered upon a campaign to eradicate the habit. When 
he saw two people whispering, he left his desk at the 
front of the room, went down to the whisperers, and 
inquired the topic of their conversation. He insisted 
that he had a right to know what went on in the 
assembly room when he was in charge; he insisted 
that whispering was a serious offense, and should be 
treated seriously; he insisted that an offender should 
show him cause for doing such a thing. The result of Among

finding himself the center of so serious a discussion 
was usually a promise on the part of the student to 
refrain from whispering in the future. A record of 
each case of whispering was kept in the principal’s 
private discipline book, and after a given number of 
offenses the less tractable students found themselves 
in danger of suspension. There were few of these, 
however, for the determination of the principal to have 
a study room undisturbed by whispering, his refusal 
to take the flimsy excuses offered, and his frank empha- 
sis upon what he considered the first requisite for a 
successful administration, put a stop to the evil of 
whispering within the year. The students who were 
threatened with suspension complained of the unrea- 
sonable standard set, but the Board decided that it 
was not unreasonable, and whispering practically 
ceased in that high school. 
Many teachers insist that the old standard of abso- 
lutely no whispering is an artificial and unreasonable 
one. At church, or at a lecture or play, they say, no 
one would think of enforcing such a restriction. Quiet 
communication with regard to work, they insist, is far 
better than idleness, or than disturbing the teacher’s 
work that wants may be supplied. To this thoughtful 
people may reply that church services, lectures, and 
plays would be far more successful if a no-whispering 
rule could be strictly enforced; and that the disturb- 
ance caused in such places by thoughtless and ill-bred 
persons would be far less if the school standard could 
be more universally accepted. However that may be, 
it is true that refraining from whispering is no longer 
regarded by teachers as an end, but merely as a means 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 239 
to better work and more mutual helpfulness; that 
artificial standards of behavior are constantly giving 
way to more natural and spontaneous ones. The en- 
forcement of “Library Rules” in many high school and 
grammar rooms has solved the problem. That is, 
necessary whispering is permitted in the room if it 
pertains to work and disturbs no one. Longer con- 
ferences, if necessary, are held in an office or hall 
adjoining. These regulations, if explained clearly, 
appeal to the sense of justice and self-interest that 
older children usually have, and are therefore almost 
self-enforcing. 
The following formulation of successive steps in the 
correction of inattention or misbehavior in class, is 
taken from the minute directions to teachers of the 
Jena practice school! It is given in its entirety for 
the sake of the careful grading which has been observed 
in the arrangement of the steps suggested. 
i. Stop the instruction until perfect quiet is restored. 
2. Tap upon the table. 
3. Warning reproof, made generally to the class. 
4. Statement of the penalty for continued inattention. 
At this point the offenders have forfeited their right 
to remain formally unnamed, and should be subjected 
to the humiliation of public reproof. Therefore the 
next step is: 
5. Speak the name of the wrong-doer, with a meas- 
ured but severe reproof. 
6. Tf still offending, the pupil is told to stand aside 
at the back of the room until the close of the class.

7. Personal report to the principal. 
American teachers would object to the rule that 
these steps are to be followed in rigid order, although 
their logical arrangement is obvious. Probably if per- 
sonal reproof were more used as a last resort, and 
every means used to make it a disgrace, less would be 
required. In general, the use of these steps always in 
the same order is averse to the elasticity of American 
custom and American successful practice, while their 
observance in primary rooms would be a waste of 
time, with no psychological justification. But the 
inherent idea of the comparative severity of the seven 
means of reproof listed will doubtless be suggestive to 
many teachers. 
Where children are wilfully and deliberately impu- 
dent, the most effective means of reproof is to cut them 
off at once from the privilege of further talking. If 
they are persistent, the use of physical force is justifi- 
able, and far preferable to the evil caused by permitting 
such an offense to go on. This is, let it be repeated, 
for wilful and conscious impudence, not the unconscious 
impudence caused by childish frankness or by simple 
ill-breeding. The impudence of defiance is one of the 
few offenses for which corporal punishment, immediate 
and public, is justifiable, sometimes extremely effica- 
cious. Some teachers take the ground that such 
language constitutes a personal offense, for which re- 
sentment is personal and justifiable, as it would be if 
the offense occurred_upon the street. It is undeniable 
that swift and summary justice probably makes the 
most effective reply so far as the offender is concerned, 
and teaches a lesson that delayed justice might never
-P-A-G-E-259
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 241 
compass. Nevertheless the danger of becoming very 
angry, and of allowing the punishment to degenerate 
into an act of vengeance for an insult, gives to this 
course an element of risk to the influence and standing 
of the teacher, to say nothing of the possibility of 
injustice. The offender, it must be remembered, is a 
child, and is consequently not in the same position as a 
man would be who had committed the same offense. 
Neither, however, is a teacher bound to take from a 
child treatment which he would not take from a man; 
and any school board worth the name is bound to sup- 
port the dignity of the teacher it employs to the extent of 
requiring respectful treatment_for him on all occasions. 
The Complaint Book has proved itself a very effective 
helper in schools where discipline is difficult. In each 
room is kept a large book something like a ledger, in 
which each pupil has an account. (If a pupil offends, 
the teacher is required to make a record in writing of 
the date, nature of the misdeed, and the means of 
correction used. A fourth column is left blank, for 
use in case the offense is dealt with later by the prin- 
cipal, or further trouble comes of it.) If the child’s 
parent calls to inquire or complain, the complaint 
book gives specific written evidence of the nature of 
his misbehavior; while the teacher, knowing that she 
must report exactly the disposal of each case, is more 
likely to be careful in his government than he would 
be if no record were kept. The complaint book goes 
to the office and justifies the teacher when parents 
complain to the principal of teachers who “have a 
pick on” their children. The fourth column contains 
data of the final disposal of the case, often with a writ- The

ten promise from both pupil and parent that the offense 
will not be repeated. The whole system of written, 
systematic records tends to reduce the amount of bad 
order, which careless, unorganized, memory-supported 
management increases. 
In connection with the complaint book, may be men- 
tioned another which is of immense help in dealing 
wisely with children. This is the pupil’s individual 
record book. It should be a loose-leaf book with a 
strong, light cover, preferably of paper. As used in 
German schools it contains an account of the pupil’s 
family, age, and preparation, outward appearance, 
measurements, health, bearing, order in dress and care 
of school-things, intellectual development, amount of 
home-work required, favorite interests, psychological 
peculiarities, and special faults. It is begun in the 
first grade, and turned over to the child’s next teacher 
upon promotion, who makes his entry in turn. If a 
child goes to another town, the book is to be sent to 
the superintendent there, or directly to the new teacher, 
who has in it a basis for intelligent work which her 
own efforts, perhaps, could not give her in a long time. 
Such a system, if followed carefully, would alone repay 
the time and trouble it costs in the saving of loss to 
children changing schools. When the child leaves 
school the record book shows in brief form his whole 
school career, and may prove valuable in many ways. 
Our best schools are rapidly taking up the matter of 
records, while in some they have been kept for a num- 
ber of years.!

The complaint book is but one phase of a general 
system which provides for contingencies and has a 
prescribed (but not fixed and unchangeable) treatment 
for all ordinary delinquencies. The thoroughly organ- 
ized school system is usually an efficient one, provided 
organization is not made an end in itself. A series of 
reports, a method of supervision, can be devised which 
will enable the superintendent of any system of schools, 
either rural or urban, to find out about any teacher or 
pupil in his system at a moment’s notice, and treat any 
“case that may arise intelligently and personally. Few 
cases in such a system will ever reach the superin- 
tendent, most of them being disposed of lower in the 
scale of the teaching ranks. No principal or superin- 
tendent can hope to do really good work without this 
organization. Many neglect it because it is hard to 
overcome the inertia of custom and the self-will of 
members of the system, and also because it requires 
much time and brains to formulate a good working 
plan. Good organization, however, is second in impor- 
tance only to a good school spirit, and contributes 
much toward the latter. 
The system, being organized, is for the benefit of 
the school. For instance, it is usually a good rule 
that complaints, visits from parents, or communica- 
tions from teachers to parents, should go through the 
principal’s office. Irate parents, bent on raising a row 
in the schoolroom, can by this means be headed off 
and made to state their grievances at a private con- 
ference, so saving the room in question from a demoral- 
izing spectacle. Notes to parents need not be read 
unless the case is an important one, but the authority

of the head of the school is a helpful reénforcement in 
all cases; while occasionally a teacher is saved from a 
mistake by this regulation. The impression of support 
and solidarity which is given by this close codéperation 
between principal and teachers does much to strengthen 
the authority and influence of the school. 
RULES 
It was an almost universal custom in the schools of 
fifty years ago, or even less, for the teacher to inaugu- 
rate a term of school by reading a set of rules, stating 
definitely what pupils might do, and what they were 
not allowed to do. Often the penalty for breach of the 
rules was added. There are some communities where 
this custom became so deeply entrenched that it is 
still followed, and there are some teachers whose meth- 
ods follow those used with them when they were 
children, who still read such a challenge on the first 
day of school. The reading of rules, however, is not 
a part of the discipline of modern education. It is 
not done in the best schools, by the best teachers. It 
is not justifiable from the standpoint of either theory 
or practice, and where public opinion asks it of a 
teacher, public opinion should be both defied and 
educated until it is in accord with the tenets of good 
educational practice. 
The most important reason for the discontinuing of 
this old custom is that no set of rules, however detailed, 
can ever cover the ground of school behavior. A 
pupil of ingenious mind might contrive to keep within 
the letter of every law, and still be a disturbing element 
in the school; and another pupil might innocently
-P-A-G-E-263
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 245 
break any number of rules, while conscientiously doing 
his best to learn and obey. Much wrong-doing is 
relative, moreover; it is right for one and wrong for 
another, right at one time and wrong at another, right 
under one set of circumstances, and a serious offense, 
worthy of punishment, under different conditions. A 
third objection, and an important one, is that rules 
offer a challenge to pupils to try their power with the 
teacher’s. They suggest an antagonism which may 
not be inherent in children’s hearts, but which soon 
becomes traditional in schools where opposition is 
taken for granted. The child who has not thought of 
breaking a rule becomes obsessed with a desire to see 
if the teacher really means what he says, when that 
teacher has made out a list of forbidden things. Far 
better to assume that pupils expect to do their best, 
want to help in making the school a success, and are 
not already planning mischief. Lastly, a teacher must 
be free to act according to the circumstances attending 
an offense when it occurs. He should never weaken 
his power by tying himself to a prescribed line of 
action, or place himself in the position of an idle threat- 
ener by calling actions offenses which, when they 
occur, may plainly be innocent of all guilt. On the 
other hand, pupils who have committed mischief 
which was not specifically named in the list of rules, 
can never excuse themselves by pleading that they were 
not forbidden to do that special thing. A teacher who 
uses no rules puts behavior on a basis of judgment and 
propriety from the beginning, and may demand judg- 
ment and propriety from his pupils consistently, in the 
decisions they are thus forced to make on matters of Rules are

conduct. In a school without rules, the responsibility 
is placed with the children, while the power remains 
with the teacher. 
This does not mean that the teacher has not care- 
fully considered what he will do if certain events occur. 
If he thinks there is a liability to misbehavior, he must 
have ready a course of action, or several. But he 
should keep his own counsel, telling his plans only to 
the proper authorities, if to anyone. 
James Whitcomb Riley tells a story of another 
Hoosier poet, Leo Harris, who was once his school- 
master, which illustrates the good effects of honoring 
bad rules in the breach rather than in the observance. 
The school was in a rural district where old prejudices 
died hard, and Leo Harris was sorely tried between his 
real humanity and his desire to fulfil the demands of 
the community which he served. 
Little Jim Riley had been bad, and was kept after 
school to be punished according to rule. When he 
and the master were left alone, however, Mr. Harris 
seemed to be in no haste to carry out the letter of 
the law. He closed the door and walked to his desk. 
Then he sent Jim to the window, and asked him if 
anyone were in sight. 
“No,” said Jim. 
“Look again,” said the master. “Are you sure?” 
Jim looked again and reported the coast quite clear. 
“Jim,” said the master, ‘can you keep a secret?” 
Jim assured the master that he could. His curiosity 
was aroused by these mysterious proceedings. Then, 
after another anxious inquiry and another reassurance, 
the master opened his great desk and cautiously drew 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 247 
forth a book. Opening it, he-began to read. Little 
James Riley listened, fascinated. When it grew too 
dark to read, he begged the master to tell him what 
came next. But the master had another plan. 
“Jim, do youythink you could take this book home 
without letting 5. know that you have it? And 
could you get it back here into my desk without letting 
anyone know that I loaned it to you?” the master 
inquired anxiously. 
James thought he could, and he did. The deadly 
sin of novel-reading was held in much abhorrence in 
that community. He hid the precious book in the 
haymow, and read it through eagerly within a few 
days. Then, going early to school one morning, he 
slipped the forbidden book into Mr. Harris’s desk. 
No one was the wiser save the master and James, but 
James had had a new vision of the romance of life and 
the riches that lie hidden between the pages of books; 
for the book was Ivanhoe. He was the everlasting 
friend of Leo Harris, for Leo Harris had had the 
courage and wisdom to defy the conventions of his 
world in an effort to reach the fundamental need of a 
boy. 
Some rule-ridden school systems are almost as dead- 
ening in their operation as were the conventions of the 
district in which the Indiana poet lived in his boyhood. 
It is the city school system now, rather than the country 
district, in which the teachers are bound fast to a set 
of hampering regulations. Provision for emergency, 
and iron-bound prescription for every possible situa- 
tion, are two different things. Aconspiracy

To withdraw privileges which are abused is a logical 
and just method of dealing with ordinary offenses. 
Mild means should be used first, and sterner ones 
with confirmed offenders. Thorough organization and 
strictly kept records help to secure good order. Set 
rules are a hindrance rather than a help in school 
management.

CorRECTIVE DEvicEs FOUNDED UPON THE MODE 
OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE 
No more illuminating and suggestive movement has 
taken place within the last few years than the estab- 
lishment of Juvenile Courts all over the country, 
managed with a view to the special needs and peculiar- 
ities of children who are offenders against the law. 
Judge Lindsey of Denver, whose methods with boys 
have furnished schoolmen with much that is helpful 
in their own work, has won his unprecedented success 
mainly through a great sympathy, directness, and devo- 
tion to those for whom primarily the Juvenile Court is 
established — the boys and girls themselves. Using 
the same means of approach, and fired with the same 
keen sympathy and constant friendliness, schoolmen 
and schoolwomen have been for years winning boys 
and girls to paths of work and worth. The personal 
friendship of a grown person means a great deal to the 
average boy or girl; and the wishes of those we know 
and like count for much with all of us. Even the 
“gang,” which is usually reinforced rowdyism at its 
worst, yields confidence and following to sincere 
friendly interest. The personal effort of one who feels Judge

Reminders 
  250 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
sharply the responsibility of setting the feet of the 
young in the right direction, of redeeming lost time, 
of retrieving sad mistakes, must always be the most 
effective means of correcting the blunders and wilful- 
ness of mistaken and headstrong boys and girls. 
The weaknesses of this method of correcting evil 
are its intermittent and temporary character, and the 
fact that it does not develop self-reliance. No friend, 
no matter how devoted, can always be at hand to guide 
and restrain, or to suggest the good resolution that has 
been made; while habit is always present, and tempta- 
tion to an established custom seems always on hand. 
Any device which serves to remind the pupil of the 
effort which needs to be so frequently renewed, which 
strengthens resolution and restrains old habit, is worth 
using. A picture on the wall or a motto may serve to 
remind the child who is making an effort to change his 
ways, of the thing to be done or to be avoided. Even 
so homely a reminder as a piece of string tied to a 
grimy forefinger, has been known to save the day for 
new and good habits when old and bad ones were 
infinitely easier and more natural. The teacher who 
hopes to accomplish results, then, by the use of personal 
influence, does well to provide, if possible, some means 
of reminder for the times when he himself cannot be 
at hand, during the first critical days of change from 
bad habits to good. Such slight reminders, also, being 
less insistent than the actual presence of the friend and 
guide, effect a transition to the ultimate condition of 
complete self-direction. They serve to call attention 
to the change to be made, without usurping the place 
of the will in making it, as the presence of the teacher,  
-P-A-G-E-269
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 251 
with his strength of greater age, authority and per- 
sonal liking, may do. 
Boys and girls who have offended to the point of 
endangering their position in the school, may often be 
won to a new care in their behavior which will outlast 
the necessity which gave it birth, by what is usually 
known as the parole system. A boy who is in danger 
of suspension is allowed to keep his place in his class, 
not in full and regular standing, but merely from day 
to day and at his teacher’s discretion, during good 
behavior. Such a trial is not a right, for that is for- 
feited by disorderly conduct, but a special favor, 
granted to those who especially wish the privilege of 
trying again, of making another effort to deserve a 
place in the school life. The terms by which they 
retain their standing in their classes can be set by the 
teacher or principal; and as these terms may include 
the quality of work required, earnest effort and applica- 
tion may be assured for the time of the trial at least. 
If this time be extended until the new régime becomes 
habitual, and the rewards of effort have acquired a 
real value in the child’s mind, the method may be said 
to have been successfully used. It is mentioned here 
among the methods involving the use of personal influ- 
ence, because its success is so frequently dependent 
upon the skilful direction of a trusted principal or 
teacher. Its appeal to honor and to fear, the faith 
that clings still to the hope of “making good” after 
the limits of patience have been passed, and the careful 
watching lest all be lost at last, depend for their efficacy 
upon the deepest personal interest and the greatest 
wisdom in administration. The parole

The 
contagion 
of success 
  252 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Much can be done by personal talks to students, both 
privately and publicly, in motivating good conduct. 
The incentives to right conduct may be emphasized by 
imaging them, describing them, by any method which 
makes them real enough to function as motives. Call- 
ing attention to those who have made the requisite 
effort and are now enjoying the fruits of their labors 
is a vivid and effective way of emphasizing the incen- 
tives to good conduct. Sometimes a man or woman 
who has made for himself an honored place among 
men can be induced to tell his story in a simple and 
straightforward way, which without boasting or preach- 
ing drives home the lesson that is needed. This sort 
of talk is often at the risk of good results, however, 
since self-made men are notoriously fond of emphasiz- 
ing their own part in their development, and are also 
inclined to be obvious in moral-driving; two charac- 
teristics which the sophisticated children of to-day 
regard with a contempt that is bound to destroy the 
effect of the most earnest talk. 
The presentation of ascertained facts regarding the 
material rewards of good conduct and earnest effort, 
which have been so often and variously compiled of 
late years, has had doubtless much good result; al- 
though statistics often fail to reach the pupils who 
need them most, unless illustrated with concrete ex- 
amples of a nature to touch the imagination. The 
simple expedient of showing what has been done, what 
is being done daily, is the means which reaches most 
pupils most powerfully. For this reason the school 
which is located in a prosperous manufacturing, com- 
mercial, or agricultural region has a distinct advantage.
-P-A-G-E-271
  
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 253 
The sight of success is inspiriting; the atmosphere of 
success is contagious. The teacher who is surrounded 
with successful enterprise has but to put his pupils 
into circuit with it, that the current may vivify their 
efforts by kindling their imaginations and strengthening 
their wills. The teacher whose pupils live among the 
unsuccessful, whose parents are the discouraged poor 
or the smug, satisfied, and commonplace well-to-do, 
has a more difficult task. It is for him to bring to his 
pupils such men and women as he can induce to speak 
to them or be seen of them, who have won success in 
any praiseworthy degree. Much of this effort will of 
necessity seem lost, but some of it is bound to meet 
the need that always exists, that lies fallow until it 
is turned up by some kindly seed-sower, plowing at 
random, and scattering broadcast. 
The vital connection between this stirring-up of 
ambition and the control of school conduct‘need hardly 
be pointed out to any teacher of experience and insight; 
for such a teacher knows that when once a worth-while 
goal is clearly seen ahead, earnest work and thought 
take care of conduct. The fundamental problem, 
then, is to arouse ambition, to set some goal that may 
seem both desirable and possible, to kindle the imagina- 
tion with a vision of the attainable and fire the will to 
secure the ends sought. School routine ceases to be 
drudgery when it appears as the means for realizing a 
dear hope. A southern teacher, working in an East- 
ern mill town, found among her pupils a lazy, backward, 
but good-natured colored boy, happily content to have 
gained the fourth grade by his fourteenth year. His 
mother, a cook in the home of a wealthy family, had Reaching 
imagination 
and will
-P-A-G-E-272
  254 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
high hopes for her boy, whom she wished to educate 
for some distinguished position among his own people. 
The boy was satisfied with the three meals a day and 
warmth and comfort which his mother’s work pro- 
vided, and made no attempt at self-improvement. 
A whisk-broom and some cheese-cloth dusters were 
the beginning of Sam’s reformation. The teacher per- 
suaded him that no one could clean blackboards as he 
could, and that her self-respect depended upon the 
thoroughness with which he brushed her suit before 
she left the schoolhouse at night. When his training 
had somewhat progressed, she told him that she was 
training him to be a sleeping-car porter. She painted 
for him a glowing mind-picture of Sam, grown up, clad 
in a resplendent uniform of blue, with brass buttons. 
Sam responded most imperfectly and intermittently, 
of course, after the manner of his race, but still with an 
encouraging attempt at attaining the levels of accom- 
plishment of those exalted personages whose power had 
come to appeal to his ambition. He made a sincere if 
unsuccessful attempt to learn his lessons, and was the 
teacher’s right-hand man in all matters of schoolroom 
housekeeping and arrangement. When last heard 
from, he was coachman for a physician, and had in 
prospect an appointment as porter at the first vacancy. 
When positive inducements fail, there remain the 
negative ones, which are administered by that authority 
which must assert itself where children do not will 
rightly to control their own actions. The part of per- 
sonal influence here may be an important one. Quietly 
to call attention to the inevitable punishment of wrong- 
doing, not as an imposition of authority, but as the

DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 255 
working of a universal law which applies to all the 
world; effectively to appeal to a wayward child to 
bring his behavior into line with that of the law-abiding 
majority, to be one with progress and accomplishment, 
requires much tact and skill and warm, personal friend- 
ship. It is in this kindly seconding of other means 
of control, the investing of every detail of the school- 
room routine with the aura of friendliness and sincere 
interest, that personal influence shows most clearly 
and reaps greatest rewards. : 
The personal influence of the teacher may be used 
to induce pupils to consider and evaluate their own 
behavior. Arnold Tompkins,’ many years ago, recom- 
mended the method of setting a delinquent the problem 
of formulating a reply to the question, ‘Why should I 
not whisper?” or “Why should I not fight?” The 
offending student should, said Dr. Tompkins, be 
excused from his regular work until he had answered 
this and the next question, which is, “What shall I 
do about my offense?”’ This throws the responsibility 
of conduct upon the pupil, and may be used to show 
him his duty of supporting the school and of submit- 
ting his will to the general good. The method is, of 
course, chiefly of use and value in the upper grades 
and with high-school students, and, as a rule, is not 
practicable with young children. Moreover, if the 
simpler and more economical means of habit-forming 
have been well utilized in the lower grades, there will 
be small need of this or other disciplinary devices in 
the higher grades. Nevertheless, in the hand of a

firm and skilful teacher, this method is immensely 
valuable with the older, wilful offender, for it rational- 
izes the whole matter of conduct in a way to apply the 
principles of social behavior to many situations. 
In dealing with the more serious offenses of lying, 
stealing, cheating, and some other sins which indicate 
a fundamental warp in character and training, the 
personal influence of a trusted teacher is all-powerful. 
To be trusted is the greatest compliment which can be 
paid a child. Teachers do well to create and to foster 
a pride in being considered honorable, trustworthy. 
When this has been forfeited, the fall from that grace 
should be felt to be a very great fall indeed. Some 
boys and girls never realize the value of a good name 
and the confidence of their fellows, until its loss is 
brought home to them sharply after some offense. 
Every means that is used to emphasize the disgrace 
that has befallen the offender emphasizes also the 
desirability of good standing; but care must be taken 
to stop short of the impression that the disgrace is an 
irretrievable one, lest despair of reinstatement make 
the problem a hopeless one. The teacher must make 
it plain that his trust is withdrawn, and that it can be 
renewed only gradually, as, step by step, the offender 
proves his worthiness. In this process, the teacher 
stands as the representative of all right-thinking people, 
and should make this plain to the pupil, lest the ulti- 
mate value of the teacher’s attitude be lost. This is 
especially necessary because pupils who offend in such 
respects usually do so because of a lack of training in 
ethical prejudices; the attitude of right-thinking people 
has not been the typical attitude of their environment.
-P-A-G-E-275
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 257 
The goal of reinstatement in the trust of teacher, 
pupils, and all the world, needs clearly to be set and 
constantly to be recalled; and many friendly inquiries 
and reminders help in the hard process of reformation. 
While recognizing the fact that many of their prob- 
lems have their origin in conditions outside the school- 
room, many teachers are unwilling to assume the 
needful responsibility of using their personal influence 
in any decided way to combat the evils they see. Many 
more who would be willing to do this if it were within 
their power, are so overburdened with the routine 
duties of their positions that to engage in further 
efforts is a physical impossibility. Still others, seeing 
the need, are distrustful of their own ability to work 
in a larger field than that for which they have received 
their training; or find it impossible to line up the sup- 
port which the movement must have to be successful. 
The fundamental need in this respect, as in others, is 
of course the need of leaders with the requisite ability 
and enthusiastic faith. Many a quiet schoolma’am,

leader, in some project of reform the necessity for 
which has lain heavily upon her soul, wakes up to 
find herself a successful agent in effecting untold good. 
Teachers must use their personal influence outside the 
schoolroom as well as in it. The unofficial position of 
a teacher outside his own domain is often merely 
nominal; in most American communities the people 
rightly look upon a teacher as a public personage 
wherever he may be. The teacher who takes an 
active interest in all that pertains to the welfare of 
his town or community, who fearlessly denounces evil Outside of 
school

when occasion calls for such denunciation, whose 
standards of personal and public honor are high, 
whose taste sanctions nothing but that which is health- 
ful and helpful in amusements and commodities, is 
A tacking not only taking the place which his position warrants, 
enemies but is adding to the strength of the school system a 
hundred bulwarks of unseen influence. It is the duty 
of a school superintendent to know as much as he can 
of the picture-shows and plays which school-children 
attend, the literature sold to them on newstands, the 
advertisements they read in the local papers, and the 
employment offered to them. Individual teachers can 
furnish much of this information to the superintendent, 
and by codperation many evil influences may be re- 
moved or mitigated. Parents and organizations will 
often codperate if their attention be called to the 
needs of the situation. As this work usually devolves 
especially upon the superintendent, it will be treated 
more fully in the chapter on Supervision; but every 
teacher should bear his share in the exercise of that 
personal influence which bears indirectly, as well as 
that which functions directly, upon the order and 
spirit of his school. 
SUMMARY 
Personal influence, actuated by. sympathy and 
friendship, sees that effort at reform is aided by re- 
minders and restraint until habit and will are strong 
enough to assume the responsibility of conduct. It 
puts offenders upon their honor in the use of the parole, 
motivates the efforts at reform, pointing out both 
positive and negative incentives, and leads children

to evaluate their own conduct and to understand the 
necessity of social attitudes. It guides those who have 
forfeited self-respect and the confidence of others in 
regaining what they have lost; and aims to effect 
wholesome changes in social ideals which are inade- 
quate, and social customs which are degrading to 
character. 
Discrptinary Devices FouNDED UPON THE APPEAL 
TO PERSONAL INTEREST 
These devices are among the oldest in use, because 
the mode has been used since schools began. Its most 
common form is prize-giving in all its shapes and rami- 
fications. This was formerly considered a commend- 
able custom, one of the enlightened and inspirational 
methods of securing good work — and doubtless it was, 
when compared with flogging. Current educational 
opinion is against it, however, as a means of doubtful 
value. English schools seem still to be provided with 
a full set of prizes for everything in the curriculum, so 
that one wonders if, a prize being inadvertently omitted 
for a single subject, any special effort is made to excel 
in that one. American schools are rarely afflicted with 
prize-giving friends, the custom being restricted almost 
entirely to private schools patterned more or less after 
European models. But while formal prize-giving is 
not common in our schools, the offering of rewards of 
one kind or another is almost universal, and has a 
strong bearing upon the order and spirit of the school. 
The question of prize-giving has long been a favorite 
point of dispute. Out of all the discussion that has 
gathered about it, the conclusion of the best educators A contrast 
Prize- 
giving

260 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
  Incentives seems to be that it is, on the whole, a low incentive to 
offer to a child, and one not to be used if a higher one 
will function. But, if no other inducement is effective, 
it is better to offer the child a prize than to permit him 
to fail of accomplishment. Once established, conform- 
ity to requirement becomes easier and tends to become 
a habit, so that the incentive may be withdrawn or be 
replaced by a better one. To reach a desirable end 
by any means that is not directly dishonorable, is 
better than not to realize the end at all.! 
Following the classification already made, the incen- 
tives that may be offered to children are: 
1. The negative one of escaping punishment or 
disgrace. 
2. The gratification of interests. 
3. Personal gain. 
4. The pleasing or service of one particular friend 
or group of friends (another form of self-pleasing). 
5. The pleasing or service of a social group. 
Dr. Bagley has analyzed the positive incentives as, 
(1) those which appeal to the instinct of emulation, 
(2) those appealing to the social instincts, and (3) 
ideals. Ideals may be either personal or social in 
nature; that is, they may look toward the future good 
of the individual or of the school — or, perhaps, of 
some even larger group, and in the case of older pupils 
of all society. The personal gains which are held out

the most favorable conditions, this transition will be but gradual.”

as incentives fall into four classes — material posses- 
sions, personal preéminence, privileges and immunities 
intrinsically desirable, and the building up of ability 
and high character. Among the material possessions 
which are offered as prizes are money, medals of in- 
trinsic value, books, pictures, — and, in a remoter 
sense, the higher earning capacity which is so con- 
stantly held before High School students as an induce- 
ment to remain in school. These material rewards are 
not evil in themselves, but the emphasis placed upon 
them tends to increase the materialism of the day, 
which measures all things by a money standard. 
Personal preéminence, which is given by the confer- 
ring of honors, the granting of medals and prizes and 
high grades, or places on debating teams and the posi- 
tions of valedictorian and salutatorian on the com- 
-mencement program, is possible usually to only a few 
members of the class, and then because of inborn gifts 
rather than praiseworthy effort. Most educators con- 
demn it as an incentive, since manifestly it affects only 
a small proportion of the students. In the lower 
grades this singling out of the best for special honor is 
done by giving badges or buttons of honor, writing the 
name on honor rolls, placing little flags on desks, or 
sending special notes of commendation or congratula- 
tion to parents. A very effective method for small 
children is the Star List, which is a large card containing 
the names of all in the class, with space after each name 
for pasting on little gilt or silver or brightly colored 
stars, given for each lesson well learned. Children count 
their stars eagerly, and usually develop a healthy sort of 
rivalry, for all have a chance to earn at least a few stars. Preémi-

  Grades 
Privileges 
Holidays as 
rewards 262 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
The grading system is liable to degenerate into a 
competitive device unless well administered. The cus- 
tom of ranking pupils in the order of their relative aver- 
age grades, not so common now as formerly, was a bad 
practice because it gave some pupils a seemingly hope- 
less inferiority. The highest grades go inevitably to 
those naturally gifted with quick brains and superior 
advantages. The truer conception of the school com- 
munity, in which every child may excel in some thing, 
be it merely the neatness with which he attends to the 
blackboards or the success with which he makes the 
geraniums bloom, has no expression in a ranked grading 
system, which cannot take account of all the activities 
of the school. It is a good rule to follow, that grades 
should be given only to the extent and for the purpose 
of showing children how they stand in their studies, 
and that with regard to a fixed standard of excellence, 
not relatively to each other. 
Privileges and immunities have a certain logical 
basis, since the excellence of pupils breeds a confidence 
that they will use rightly the special opportunities given 
them. In practice, however, this supposition does not 
always hold good. In one school, for instance, the 
pupils who averaged go per cent in their studies were 
given the freedom of the building — the right to go 
where they pleased without special permission. The 
privilege had to be taken away from them because 
they were soon found to be abusing it by meeting in 
the halls to gossip and play. 
The “privilege” of a monthly half-holiday for regu- 
larity of attendance and excellence of work is used in 
some schools, and usually gives a great appearance of
-P-A-G-E-281
  
ee DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 263 
success, the children working like well-regulated beav- 
ers for the extra half-day of freedom. One is inclined 
to wonder if the teachers who offer a half-day of release 
from their control have a sense of humor; and if so, 
why they do not apply it to the spectacle of setting up 
this release from school as a reward for good work in 
school. The’ school and the prison, surely, are not to 
be considered parallel institutions, to be managed by 
similar methods. A school exercise of a different sort, 
such as a trip to a park or museum, or to the woods, 
or to a factory or a farm, is sometimes offered as a 
reward to the pupils who have done well. But to 
put school work upon such a basis is liable to give 
it the wrong connotation for the pupils, as well as 
for parents, too many of whom regard school as an 
ingenious device for keeping young people within 
doors. 
The most common immunity is that from examina- 
tion, granted to pupils who reach a certain grade in 
their daily recitations. This custom springs from the 
old, mistaken conception of the examination as an 
inquisition on the part of the teacher, a sort of belliger- 
ent challenge to the pupil to prove that he is capable 
of going on with the work. The true idea of examina- 
tions is that they are for the good of the pupil rather 
than for the teacher. They are primarily a means of 
showing the pupil where he stands. The teacher wants 
to know this only that he may be more helpful, but the 
pupil’s interest is more fundamental, for his own prog- 
ress| depends largely upon the foundation already laid. 
With older pupils examinations should be welcome 
opportunities to review, organize, and test. In every

  264 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
grade where they have a place at all, examinations 
should be considered part of the regular work, and 
therefore should be done by all. 
Last, and by far most important of the forms of 
self-interest which may function to control and improve 
conduct, is the incentive of self-improvement. Self- 
improvement has two phases, the training of power to 
do, and the training of power to be; the gaining of 
ability and skill, and the development of nobility of 
character. The first of these two is a matter of intel- 
lect, the second of emotion, guided by ideals; and both 
must be vitalized by the will. Teachers should begin 
to urge the two-fold self-culture from the child’s first 
entrance into school life. Unless allowed to degenerate 
into preachiness or nagging, children welcome this per- 
sonal note in the teacher’s anxiety for their advance- 
ment, and respond to it eagerly and with gratitude. 
It recognizes the most immediate end of education for 
them, which is their improvement, their gain in power 
to get what they want and to be what they admire. 
The power to win what seems desirable is a more 
elementary and natural incentive than the power to 
realize an ideal in character. It is a ready-made, 
instinctive incentive. Teachers use it constantly. 
They urge pupils to write neatly, that they may not 
be prevented from obtaining a good position by poor 
penmanship. They urge them‘to speak correctly that 
they may be able to gain their ends by persuasion. 
They suggest that a good mathematician will probably 
become a good business man, and that nature-study 
leads to profitable agriculture. Music and manners 
and a well-stored mind are helpful in social life; indus-
-P-A-G-E-283
    DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 265 
try and neatness, everywhere. It is.right to urge these 
incentives, for they illustrate a great truth that cannot 
be over-emphasized, namely, that all good things must 
be paid for, earned, compensated for, soon or late. 
That effort does bring reward, even when the immedi- 
ate object is not obtained, is the belief that takes form 
under these constant suggestions. 
The second part of the child’s development should 
parallel the first. He is unconsciously forming char- 
acter in every adjustment to the world about him, 
but definiteness and force are gained by sometimes 
making the process conscious. There is no harm, for 
instance, in asking the children, after telling them the 
story of the boy Lincoln reading by the light of the 
winter fire, what they think of such a habit, what 
Lincoln gained by it, and if they would have done 
the same thing. Children need to be encouraged to 
formulate their ideals by writing or describing orally 
their ideal man and woman, boy and girl. They are 
didactic creatures, delighting in the clear statement 
of truths that have grown trite to their elders. Con- 
sequently they revel in the opportunity to describe 
their ideal characters, and produce documents that 
are invaluable to their teachers. One very successful 
teacher always gives this exercise at the beginning of 
each new school year, to enable her to understand the 
children given into her care. If she finds certain 
ideals or standards lacking, she tells her classes stories 
of men or women whose lives illustrate the special 
quality that-needs emphasis. At the end of the year 
the exercise is repeated, and the comparison of the 
two papers gives an index to character-growth, or at Character-

and his 
temper least to the formation of ideals, that has taken place 
during the year. A regular program of ethical in- 
struction is used in this school, it should be added, 
beside the hero-stories. 
Sometimes self-revelation gives a startling impetus 
to endeavor. An incident which happened in a Cin- 
cinnati school illustrates the influence which wise guid- 
ance and treatment may have in securing good conduct 
from motives of proper self-interest. A boy who had 
the misfortune to be possessed of an ungovernable 
temper was kept after school to finish some work 
which he had willfully neglected during the regular 
session. Sitting at his desk, he suddenly flung papers, 
books and pencils in all directions and cried out, “I 
can’t stay, I tell you! I have to go to the dentist’s!” 
His teacher knew that the engagement at the den- 
tist’s was for the next afternoon. Nevertheless, she 
said, looking steadily at the boy, “Ernst, you are 
excused.” Astonished and somewhat frightened at 
his own outburst, he left. The next morning he came 
in with his line, but was met at the door by the teacher, 
who directed him with a gesture to stand aside until 
she could speak to him. When the other children 
had passed in, she turned to Ernst standing in the 
corridor, and looked at him steadily. The boy flushed 
quickly, remembering the scene of the night before; 
then said, “I’m not going to act like that again.” 
“But I’m afraid to have you in the school,” said 
his teacher. ‘You were insane yesterday. You were 
blind with fury, and might in another moment have 
maimed or even killed some one; you might do another 
pupil a serious injury. A schoolroom is no place for
-P-A-G-E-285
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 267 
people who may at any time lose their senses with 
anger. Such people, I fear, belong in another kind 
of institution.” 
The boy began to realize the seriousness of his 
offense, in its ultimate as well as its immediate effects. 
“Oh, if you’ll only let me come back, I’ll never do 
that again,” he said, “Please try me. I'll try to 
master my temper if you'll just let me try.” 
The trial was, of course, allowed, and Ernst has 
justified it by gaining a steady control over himself. 
SUMMARY 
Prize-giving is an incentive of doubtful merit, not 
to be used if others appealing to higher motives will in 
discipline function. To develop high character and great power, 
and to serve others well, are incentives for effort that 
should be encouraged. The relative ranking of the 
students of a class gains no good end. Examinations 
are not a punishment, but an occasion for organization 
and test, of which all students should avail themselves; 
and holidays as rewards for good conduct are scarcely 
logical. Self-improvement, which is the highest form 
of self-seeking, has two phases, the development of 
character and the development of ability. Teachers 
should test the ideals of their pupils at intervals, to 
ascertain in what direction they need especial help 
and guidance. Incentives

Loyalty to

DISCIPLINARY DEVICES (Continued) 
  Devices FouNDED UPON THE MODE oF CONSCIOUS 
SocraL APPEAL 
THOSE who object to the deliberate development 
of class or school spirit overlook the fact that group- 
loyalty is a necessary step toward a still more liberal 
social loyalty. From himself to his family, to his own 
group of playmates, to the class, school, and team to 
which he belongs, to his town, his state, his country, 
is extended the ever-widening coalition of interest of 
the developing child; and if the process be not arrested, 
it will go until the mature man or woman feels himself 
in fraternal relations with all people of all countries. 
In the school, then, the era of class and school loyalty 
has a distinct and rightful place, and as an aid to good 
order and good spirits, if wisely guided and managed, 
it is very important. Even rivalry, if it be group- 
rivalry and not personal rivalry, may be used for good. 
It is as Utopian a dream to eliminate rivalry from a 
wide-awake school as to eliminate it from life outside 
the school; and if it were to be done away with we 
should lose one of the most effective means of teaching 
courtesy, self-control, consideration, and justice. The 
selfishness, brutality, and vindictiveness sometimes 
charged to rivalry are results of the neglect to teach 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 269 
the customs and standards of true sportsmanship, the 
principles that govern well-conducted contests of any 
kind, the tenets of fair play. There will always be 
rivalry in the world while the world continues to pro- 
gress, and to attempt to conduct a school entirely free 
from this natural, instinctive feature is to attempt a 
mawkish travesty on human nature. The problem 
is not one of eliminating a fundamental element in 
conduct, but of controlling it for good ends, of using it 
in the best way. 
The explanation of the evil effects of class and 
school loyalty lies in the fact that the pupils do not 
see their room or class as a part of an organic whole, 
but merely as the isolated rival of one other organiza- 
tion. If the place of the unit concerned, in the whole 
fabric of the school system, be made conscious to the 
pupils, and the end of the effort be to improve that 
whole system through a contribution which all hope 
may be the best and greatest of any made, the social- 
izing influence will be far greater than the indi- 
vidualizing influence. The immediate aim of making 
the best showing becomes secondary to the ultimate 
aim of improving the big unit, of pride in the good 
accomplished for all. The process of improving 
conditions in a school badly demoralized by an almost 
universal habit of tardiness, may be taken as an ex- 
ample. The new principal who found things in bad 
shape and resolved to effect a reformation, instituted 
a contest between the different rooms with the aim of 
establishing a new record and a new set of habits with 
regard to punctuality. A pennant was hung outside 
each room, which was unfurled if there had been no The

tardiness that day, but rolled up if one person had 
spoiled the record. This was a direct appeal to room- 
loyalty, and although no word of beating the record 
of other rooms was said by teachers or principal, the 
pupils soon began to point to the full-flung pennants 
of their own rooms with much pride, and to boast of 
belonging to a grade which had a clear record. The 
ideal of a whole school with a.good record, however, 
was kept before the pupils. Big brothers and sisters in 
the upper grades were urged to help the younger mem- 
bers of their families to reach school on time; and the 
teachers saw to it that all jeering and baiting of the 
unfortunates who “spoiled the record” was nipped in 
the bud. The effect of the effort as a whole was to 
develop, besides the primary object of greater punctual- 
ity, a feeling of solidarity in the whole school, of loyalty 
to classes and rooms and to the school at large; a 
feeling which the editor of the local paper still further 
generalized by an editorial in which he mentioned the 
school record as a matter for town pride. 
The individuality of school units is a point that 
may be skilfully emphasized¥in such a way as to be of 
material help in improving conditions. In some New 
York schools, for example, the classes are named after 
some great man whose character or deeds the class 
may wish to honor or to imitate. A feeling of loyalty 
to a common standard grows out of the constant 
emphasis upon the character of the class hero. Pride 
in an untarnished class record, not only as to punc- 
tuality, but touching the more important virtues of 
truth, honesty, industry, and obedience, will sometimes 
hold the individual pupil to personal integrity until
-P-A-G-E-289
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 24 
the standard, upheld at first through no intrinsic 
regard for right, becomes by habit a part of his personal 
creed and custom. Wherever and however the desir- 
ability of ethical action can be emphasized, in whatever 
way the interest of others may become more important 
than the interest of self, there good has been done. 
Of late years the ideal of social motive has been so 
freely associated with the ideal of self-activity and of 
self-government, that in the minds of many it is identi- 
cal. These people think it impossible for children to 
act for the good of all without to some extent fixing 
the conditions under which they shall live, and actively 
participating in the management of their own affairs. 
An analysis of the different forms of pure or partial 
pupil-government has been given in the chapter on 
the Mode of Social Appeal. In this place we wish to 
consider the value of such methods as devices for the 
improving of the order of the school. They have 
been used with marked success in a number of instances, 
and this success has led many to wonder if the old 
methods are not fundamentally wrong. A close study 
of the elements in the success of these plans where 
they have justified their realization, however, leads one 
to the conclusion that they are due in every case to 
the dominating personality of a strong leader, rather 
than to the intrinsic merits of the system. Where 
teachers are not actively in sympathy with the experi- 
ment, it fails. The success attained is a proof that a 
leader of magnetic power can accomplish remarkable

results by the use of methods that under ordinary 
circumstances are doomed to sure failure. It is not 
claimed that these systems have not done great good; 
but it is highly probable that the energy used to bring 
about the results attained, if used in methods more 
simple and more suited to the ends to be gained, would 
have accomplished even more, without setting the 
dangerous example of a success in which the most 
potent element is denied and covered up. 
In the first place, it is wise to recognize a certain 
looseness of terminology which has largely escaped 
notice.1 Such systems are called self-government 
systems, whereas they really furnish so elaborate a 
scheme of pupil-government that, between the com- 
prehensive legislation and the tendency of eager youth 
to find something to do, they give the individual pupils 
very little chance to govern themselves. They are 
mutual-government schemes, but afford few oppor- 
tunities for self-government. The pupils are put 
upon their honor to report misdeeds that come to 
their notice, and unless they are deterred by motives 
of friendship, fear, or indolence, they do so. The 
whole scheme is but a thoroughly-extended monitorial 
system.” The principle upon which it is founded is a 
sound one, in that it is the duty of all to uphold the 
1 But see Perry, Management of a City School, page 286. 
2 One must, however, distinguish two classes of monitors, or 
rather two classes of duties assigned to them. The monitor whose 
work it is to watch other pupils and report infractions of rules, 
becomes often a self-satisfied prig or a tale-bearing spy. The 
monitor who attends to various school duties — the school-officers, 
as the Germans call them — learn habits of responsible care and 
industry, and have a proprietary pride in the neatness and order of 
their rooms as a result of their appointment or election.
-P-A-G-E-291
  
* DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 273 
integrity of the system of government under which 
they live. But to go one step farther, and make all 
responsible for that integrity, not upon occasion and 
at the request of the authorities, but constantly, in 
the teacher’s place, is to confuse the positions of teacher 
and pupil and to give to children a work for which they 
are not yet fitted. The systems have the disadvantages 
of the older monitorial schemes. Their advocates 
make much, for instance, of the fact that responsibility 
is shifted from the teacher to the pupils. But is not 
the teacher the person in whom the public reposes 
responsibility for the school? Has he not been pre- 
pared and educated for that very purpose? Is he not, 
though never so poorly prepared, better trained to 
assume responsibility than his charges? Why should 
the teacher wish, or even be willing to shift his respon- 
sibility? And can he do so, even if he wishes? The 
teacher under such a system may hold the pupils 
responsible for good order on the playground, and 
forego all supervision during recesses. But if one boy 
in a fit of anger attack another and injure his eye, the 
parents of the second boy will not exonerate the teacher 
from blame because the boys are supposed to be self- 
governing. Law and public opinion hold one person 
responsible for the school—- the teacher. In a last 
analysis, then, the system will not hold; and are the 
results worth the pretense? 
Moreover, childhood is the period during which 
human beings are learning to control themselves, and 
self-control should, by every law of fitness, precede 
the exercise of authority over others. The school 
democracy, in fact, commits the essential fallacy of Placing

all pure democracies — it assumes an equality which 
does not exist. There are two qualifications, for 
instance, which we demand shall be fulfilled by those 
who wish a voice in our nation’s government. Simply 
to vote requires that the age of 21 shall have been 
reached; that is, the mere exercise of judgment demands 
a certain degree of maturity. If a man wish to hold 
office, good citizenship demands that he shall have 
shown ability in some way. He should be a good 
business man, or a successful practitioner if in a profes- 
sion. One other claim to consideration counts for a 
great deal, namely length and faithfulness of public 
service. Now children have none of these requisites 
for authority in a qualifying degree, and many think 
that people who have neither maturity, proved ability, 
nor experience had better learn to work under direction 
than to try to rule. 
Lastly, by its emphasis upon statutes and officers, 
school-cities and school-states tend actually to inter- 
fere with self-government, the ideal to be attained.’ 
It is possible for a teacher to resign his control over a 
child, to allow him to pass from direction by others to 
self-direction, at any time when he is ready for that 
point in his development. Under the control of 
teachers, school government retains an elasticity 
which makes individual treatment easy. When under 
the direction of children, however, who work in accord- 
ance with a fixed set of rules, it is impossible to suspend

trained powers find it a difficult task to be wise and 
just in their judgments, which is perhaps one reason 
for the opposition of many of the older teachers to the 
new methods of self-government; they can not conceive 
of children who are capable of performing the task ably. 
The principle of codperation, however, and of respon- 
sibility on the part of pupils for their own behavior 
and to a certain extent for their neighbors’, is so sound 
that some teachers think it wise to base their scheme 
of government upon it. The secondary object of such 
organizations, the teaching of civics, may be gained, 
it is true, by other means than the harnessing of the 
whole school routine to that end;! nevertheless there 
has never been devised so good a scheme for giving 
constant practice and illustration of the means of 
popular government. The utilization of the surplus 
energy of pupils in the absorbing machinery of school 
administration is an additional incentive of great 
appeal, especially in crowded city schools. The 
following cautions are suggested to those who think 
of adopting a pupil-government plan: 
1. Pupils need a thorough foundation of acknowl- 
edged ideals of honesty, industry, and devotion to 
duty if they are to be trusted to carry on such a scheme 
after the novelty has worn off.

ment will not place old heads on young shoulders. — Strayer,

2. The teacher must remain always the ultimately 
responsible person. 
3. The plan of government must not be too elab- 
orate for the pupils who are to use it. 
4. Very able teachers are required to make such a 
scheme a success. Where under ordinary conditions 
a teacher uses his authority frankly and quickly, 
under such a régime he must use it indirectly, and 
often with annoying delay. To overcome these dis- 
advantages requires a person of much ingenuity, tact, 
and force of character. 
5. Eternal vigilance and untiring labor are necessary 
to keep out evils. The plan involves more work — 
not less — than direct government by teachers. 
Many of the features of the school city and the 
school state can be used as disciplinary devices with 
the best results. The cleaning squad, the pianist or 
bugler, the pennant committee, the girl who waters 
the plants, and the boy who fills the waterbucket, 
all are officers in a school service just as real as if it 
called itself by some other name than just what it is. 
A great teacher is he who can build up in the minds of 
his pupils a real pride in being of service. If children 
ask, “‘What did he do for the world?” of any man 
whose name they hear, something has been accom- 
plished. Let the fine motto, “I serve,” hang in an 
honored place on the wall, and let the spirit of unity 
and solidarity be fostered in every way possible. 
Daily stories of great men and women, in which hero- 
ism, devotion to good causes, unselfishness, and breadth 
of sympathy are extolled in a concrete way, do wonders 
in building up the attitude of service-giving. If enough
-P-A-G-E-295
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 277 
variety in the forms of service described is given to 
these hero-stories, some one of them will probably 
reach even the most indifferent. This development 
of the spirit of service, of the actual feeling of brother- 
hood and of community of interest between all the 
pupils of the school, is both the condition and the 
hoped-for outcome of all pupil-government plans. 
THE Morninc EXERcIsE aS A HELP TO SCHOOL 
ORDER 
The very essence and culmination of all conscious 
effort to serve the whole body of the school, lies in the 
kind of morning exercises which really fulfils its pur- 
poses.!. These purposes include the unification of the 
school-in its activities and interests, the motivation 
of school work by means of socializing incentives, the 
development of expression, appreciation, organizing 
ability and ideals, and the opportunity to give to the 
children a vision of their relation to the greater world- 
life that lies outside the schoolroom. Morning exer- 
cises that even very imperfectly realize these purposes 
become a source of such uplift to the school, of such a 
change in its spirit, as can but react in the improve- 
ment of order and the elimination of evil. 
Before considering the forms which morning exer- 
cises may take, it will be well to examine two stock 
1 The Francis W. Parker School of Chicago has developed the 
morning exercise as variously and successfully as any school. The 
Year Book for 1913 is devoted to an account of this feature of the 
school; it is packed with helpful suggestions. Much of the material 
of the following paragraphs is taken more or less directly from this 
little book. (Press of Francis W. Parker School, 330 Webster ave.,

objections to them and show how misleading and ill- 
founded they are. These two objections are that 
morning exercises, especially when they depart from 
the most brief and formal routine, detract from the 
time and attention that should be devoted to study; 
and that the effect upon children of appearing pub- 
licly is to develop self-consciousness, affectation, and 
conceit. The same objections are urged, of course, 
with respect to the more elaborate entertainments 
given by young people — plays, concerts, pageants; 
and the same answer may be made. If the motive of 
contributing to the pleasure and enlightenment of others 
Self- be kept constantly in the foreground, and the child’s 
eens conception of his message be made as vivid and as 
service impressive as it should be, there will be no room or 
attention left for self in his preparation or delivery of 
it. His self-respect will increase with his proved power 
to entertain and instruct other people, and with his 
ability to think on his feet or speak without embarrass- 
ment. But his idea of his own relative importance is 
bound to shrink as he grows in the wisdom that comes 
from a broadened view and from a new wealth of 
knowledge. Even though some temporary exaltation 
result from his performance, it is more than balanced 
by the real power which a successful appearance gives. 
“Children accustomed from childhood to an audience 
learn to think and speak upon their feet so people can 
hear and understand. It is the habit of meeting an 
audience every day from the beginning that tells, that 
gives power, skill, and self-possession. The majority 
of children trained in this way never experience the 
agony of self-consciousness that an audience means
-P-A-G-E-297
DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 279 
to those educated to self-repression instead of self- 
expression.” It is to be remembered that in morning 
exercises every pupil in turn is to be given a chance 
to contribute, so that appearance gives practice with- 
out conferring any especial distinction. Distinction 
is the prize of unusual talent or application, and will 
inevitably follow an especially fine contribution, as 
it should. 
With regard to the first objection, its validity de- 
pends entirely upon the nature of the exercises given 
and the skill with which they are correlated with the 
regular work of the school. They should grow out of 
daily lessons, or spring from a spontaneous interest 
in some absorbing question of the day. “They are 
usually the culmination of some line of study. The 
subject is sometimes science, the telling or illustrating 
of observations of nature; the story of some visit to 
the farm, the art gallery, or workshop; history, current 
events; the massing of the literature and music of some 
special subject or special day; the telling of stories 
that delight the children’s hearts; or the discussion 
of some problem of vital significance in the community- 
life of the school. Therefore the exercises, instead of 
interfering with the school work, emphasize, reinforce 
and vitalize it; give it purpose-and‘form and furnish 
the best test of the children’s growth and power to 
think and of their skill in expression.”! : 
The exercises used in the Francis Parker School 
include readings, plays, concerts, story-telling exer- 
cises, illustrated history-topics, demonstrations of the 
arts, and religious services. An exercise on Historical

devotions 280 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
Methods in Arithmetic, one on the Great Ice Sheet, 
one on Cicero, one on types of bridges, one on different 
kinds of artificial illumination — to select a few at 
random — show how all the activities of the school 
contribute to the morning exercise. The first grade 
gives an exercise on play-houses and primitive homes, 
the high school tells about the chemistry of water. 
The entire school participates in a series of exercises 
on pottery, in which Indian, Egyptian, and Japanese 
scenes are reproduced in tableaux for which one re- 
hearsal was held, and for which the children made the 
simple scenery. In other schools the same plan has 
been followed, the exercises being suggested by both 
teachers and pupils, who inferred from their own 
interest in what they were doing that others would be 
interested too. Dramatization of stories studied in 
literature classes, song-cycles, talks about vacation 
experiences or accounts of travel, explanations of new 
scientific discoveries and reviews of new books — all 
these things may be presented to a rapt audience if 
only the desire for self-expression spring from a suffi- 
ciently vivid appreciation of some new experience or 
some old hobby. Such morning exercises can spring 
only from a quality of mental wide-awakeness, which 
is in its turn stimulated by the expression given. 
A most unfortunate condition which prevents the 
morning exercise in public schools from fulfilling its 
final degree of helpfulness, is the impossibility in many 
localities of including devotional exercises. The influ- 
ence of simple and sincere religious services, of the 
Bible lesson and prayer and of hymns of praise, when 
led by those who themselves feel the inspiration they
-P-A-G-E-299
4 DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 281 
afford, is so great that our schools can ill afford to 
forego it. Wherever the laws permit such devotional 
services, and they can be held without arousing a 
degree of objection which would defeat their purpose, 
they should form part of the morning exercise. The 
possibility of utilizing the potent force of religious 
sentiment, unhampered by law or the charge of unduly 
pushing denominational views, is one of the distinct 
advantages possessed by the private school. In lieu 
of this, and as the next best thing, fine stories of heroic 
deeds, the best that literature and art can give to stir 
the soul and elevate the taste, every legitimate appeal 
to the higher emotions and the idealizing power of 
youth, will serve to make life so earnest, rich, and full 
of wholesome joy that petty meanness and silly mis- 
chief are crowded out. : 
The unifying influence of the morning exercise 
depends largely upon completeness of participation 
—upon the thoroughness with which each member 
of the school is drawn into the circle. The school 
that has an assembly room large enough to accommo- 
date all the grades and the high school is fortunate 
in this respect, for there a friendly fellowship may 
spring from the frequent and helpful association. 
Such a school will not suffer from that absurd and 
harmful feeling of superiority and aloofness which 
grows up among high school and upper grade pupils 
who are habitually separated from their small brothers 
and sisters. It is probable that such association, by 
visualizing the shadowy realm of learning’s higher 
haunts, has a helpful influence in reducing retardation.

the high school students (not swaggering past him 
on the walk, but sitting at desks as he does, and sing- 
ing or reciting as he does, only better) may acquire 
the ambition to be a high school boy too. The ideal 
of the school is that of a friendly group, working to- 
gether in harmony for common ends; and yet there 
are many school children who never see the rooms in 
which older children meet, to say nothing of gaining 
a conception of the pleasures that lie beyond them 
if they persevere. In morning exercises planned to 
show the results of study, this end of holding out 
incentives for effort, among others, may be realized. 
Older children delight in the performances of their 
younger schoolmates, and their appreciation is golden 
for the admiring little people. 
Each room in a building, each child in each room, 
may do something during the year, if only the simplest 
of mechanical services, toward the success of the daily 
meeting. All the best of individual gain, all the 
happy outcomes of common effort, may be brought to 
this social center and there proudly, gladly, be offered 
to the whole body of the school. And only as the 
spirit of loving and eager giving dominates the activities 
of this period, will it become the power for good that 
it may be. 
A few practical suggestions and cautions for the 
conduct of these exercises may be helpful. They 
must, first of all, be planned definitely and carefully, 
programmed as clearly as any class exercise, and pur- 
posefully arranged. 
The mechanical details of marching, placing, order, 
ventilation, signals, distribution of papers or books,
-P-A-G-E-301
  
  DISCIPLINARY DEVICES 283 
and the courteous formalities that must mark the 
assembling of large bodies, should be carefully arranged 
by all the teachers in council. 
Children who are too shy, or not sufficiently talented 
to appear in prominent ways, should be assigned 
duties which they can perform, so that all may feel 
their responsibility. Ushering, arranging shades and 
opening windows, the duties of doorkeepers and stage 
managers, passing songbooks or papers, are little 
offices that add to the comfort and pleasure of such 
occasions, and may be performed by the shy and back- 
ward pupils who can not sing or play or speak. 
Marching to and from the room facilitates the Marching 
gathering and dispersal of pupils. Do not try to 
achieve military precision, but aim to develop the 
feeling for balance and rhythm and erect, graceful, 
elastic carriage, which normal children have. On 
special occasions, as at Christmas and Easter services, 
the marching may be omitted, to add quiet to the 
elements that create a different atmosphere. In this, 
as in all exercises, only good music should be tolerated. 
A cheap popular air is no more excusable when used 
as a march than if played as an instrumental solo in a 
program. 
SUMMARY 
In the socializing process, loyalty to the groups 
with which children are identified, such as class and 
room, is a step toward a more complete merging of 
individual interests with social aims. Therefore group 
loyalty is to be encouraged, taking care to appeal 
always to larger and larger groups as children become 
old enough to comprehend these larger units. They
-P-A-G-E-302
284 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
should work to improve the character and increase 
the accomplishment of the groups with which they 
are connected. Pupil-government schemes, which are 
elaborations of the older monitorial schemes with the 
addition of legislative features, are helpful in teaching 
civics, but are illogical and misleading in so far as they 
confuse the attitudes of preparation and administra- 
tion. The ideals of faithful service and self-govern- 
ment may be taught in other ways. A more effective 
means of socializing the school lies in wisely planned 
general exercises, to which all are expected to con- 
tribute.

CHAPTER XVI 
THE SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 
No part of the supervision of schools is more im- 
portant than the supervision of their discipline; and 
in general it is true that no part is more difficult. As 
the reputation of an individual teacher stands or falls 
with his success or failure in keeping order,’ so the 
name of a man at the head of a school system will 
acquire distinction or lose it accordingly as he succeeds 
or fails to secure order and industry and _frieridly 
coéperation throughout the schools he controls. The 
importance of this subject, therefore, is great enough 
to warrant the most careful study, both of its theoretical 
and of its practical aspects; and yet few supervisors 
undertake it in systematic manner, and little has been 
done to formulate the principles which underlie suc- 
cessful practice. The present discussion will aim to 
suggest, first, the function of the supervisor in securing 
good order where the teacher in charge has trouble; 
second, a means of analyzing the situation in each 
case; third, an outline of a typical process by which 
a supervisor may hope to make a good disciplinarian 
out of a poor one. For the excellence of a staff of

The \/ 
supervisor’s 
duty 
  286 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
teachers depends, so far as the superintendent is con- 
cerned, upon two abilities which he must exercise 
alternately and complementarily. The first is the 
ability to select good teachers, the second the ability 
to improve those whom he has selected, or those with 
whom Fate has provided him. Improving teachers 
in service is the most needed and valuable of these 
abilities. 
The teacher who has trouble with the order and 
spirit of his room has a right to expect help from his 
principal or superintendent. The supervisory function 
properly extends to the maintenance of a good school 
spirit expressed in cheerful conformity to school cus- 
toms. When the individual teacher falls short of 
securing this, it is the business of the supervisor to 
find where the trouble lies and suggest a remedy. 
The supervisor, of whatever rank, who exercises a 
purely judicial function only, misses the most impor- 
tant part of his calling. His work should be judicial, 
then constructive, then judicial again; but the test 
of his work lies in his ability to build up, to strengthen, 
to improve, to eliminate weakness, to inspire, to make 
permanent each gain in efficiency. Teachers not 
amenable to advice — the headstrong, the conceited, 
the hopelessly incompetent — have no place in an 
efficient school system, and after a fair trial should be 
dismissed from service. 
The fair trial, which means a trial with help, the 
supervisor is bound to give. He may have that in 
his position and his personality which is just the ele- 
ment wanting in the equipment of the inefficient 
teacher; and having it, he is morally bound to use it
-P-A-G-E-305
  SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 287 
at any place in his whole system where it may be of 
service. He has experience, which brings in its wake 
any number of kinds of equipment. He has usually 
a more thorough preparation, a wider range of knowl- 
edge, than his teachers. He is, above all, the visible 
agent of authority in the eyes of the pupils of the 
school — an authority whose identification with the 
teacher is not always obvious to the school. All these 
things a supervisor must put at the service of a teacher 
before condemning her as a poor disciplinarian. 
Wherever bad order exists, obviously the first duty 
of the supervisor is to analyze the situation with care, 
in order to know definitely the source of weakness. 
Probably a clear idea of the cause of the trouble is the 
teacher’s first, most fundamental need. Usually 
neither will nor disposition, but knowledge, is lacking. 
Four simple questions suffice, as a rule, to cover the 
ground of an inquiry into the cause of bad order, and 
they are given here in the order in which they will 
probably furnish the key to the situation: 
1. Does the teacher have an adequate ideal of good 
order? 
2. If not, how can such an ideal be created for this 
teacher, and how can he be made sensitive to failure 
of its realization? 
3. If, or when, the ideal exists, what weakness pre- 
vents its realization? 
4. What devices does this teacher need for securing 
good order? 
Taken in this order and answered in turn, these four 
questions will give in almost every case a basis for 
advice to a teacher who has difficulty with the behavior   
Analyzing 
the 
situation
-P-A-G-E-306
  The ideal 
of order 
A construc- 
tive program 288 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
of his pupils. The most fundamental requirement 
for good order is the ideal of good order, and in many 
cases its absence at once gives the cue for the training 
of the teacher, who needs to be told what to require 
of his pupils, and also to realize the seriousness of 
falling short of an approximate realization. When 
the teacher knows what he ought to have, he may still 
fail to have it because of some weakness of which he 
is either unaware, or which he is powerless to over- 
come. When the teacher has both an ideal and the 
strength to realize it, he fails because he does not know 
the method by which to gain his end — that is, he 
needs devices. 
Of course it is not supposed that an experienced 
supervisor will necessarily follow just this order of 
reasoning in an attempt to ascertain the situation in 
a room wanting good order, for experience gives after 
a time a quickness of insight into the weaknesses of 
teachers or the peculiar difficulties of a hard place, 
perhaps beyond the teacher’s power to change. But 
it can not be too strongly emphasized that a precise 
and correct analysis of the situation is the first duty 
of the superintendent who wants to help a teacher in 
this respect. 
Then, having diagnosed the case, the advising phy- 
sician has next to suggest a plan of treatment. The 
following outline of a constructive policy for super- 
vision with a view to improving discipline is, of course, 
more full than actual practice in a majority of cases 
would require, for the reason that it aims to cover the 
range of needs and remedies. It is hoped that it may 
prove suggestive in some or all of its parts.
-P-A-G-E-307
  SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 289 
Where bad order springs from the lack of an adequate 
ideal on the teacher’s part, which is the case with many 
young teachers who have difficulty, the work of the 
superintendent begins with the establishment of a 
conscious, imperial, and adequate ideal of good order. 
With this positive ideal there must also be taught, if 
the work is to be thorough and effective, a converse 
sensitiveness to bad order. The ideal will be clarified 
and strengthened by contrast. There are several ways 
in which this ideal may be brought to the teacher’s 
notice and become a part of his own working capital. 
The most obvious and direct is a clear formulation of 
the ideal by the supervisor in as few words as possible. 
Then this bare statement may be illumined in an 
illustration by a lesson taught by the supervisor, or 
an hour’s conduct of the room, if the nature of the case 
permit of this object-lesson. The teacher may be sent 
to observe others who are known to be good in dis- 
cipline, alone or with the supervisor, being required 
in either case to make a summary of specific points 
observed, good and bad. Then there is the inspira- 
tional method of telling stories of teachers who suc- 
ceeded just where the teacher in question needs to 
succeed — with care always to recount methods and 
difficulties, since nothing is less inspiring than to hear 
of someone who succeeded by sheer force of native 
genius where one’s own native genius absolutely 
refuses to function. Added to these is a whole set of 
indirect helps, including general ideas of the ideal 
relation between teacher and pupils, the people’s place 
in society and education, the nature of government, 
and the course of social evolution. These last ideas Giving

are not visionary conceptions incapable of helping a 
teacher over a very concrete and harassing difficulty. 
They have proved often to be just the remedy for evils 
that seem at first blush to bear no sensible relation to 
them. The truth is that no professional work is more 
calculated in its daily round of little and tedious tasks 
to narrow and mechanize than is teaching. A very 
large amount of schoolroom trouble is merely the 
natural result of weariness produced by too much 
attention to details that have gone stale, and a lack 
of serenity and bigness in the teacher. Any idea 
which brings sureness, which minimizes the im- 
portance of little annoyances, which gives that 
kindliness which comes with the life of big spaces 
and that serenity which comes with content and 
growth, is a direct and powerful help in securing 
good order. 
Much of the helplessness of young or weak teachers 
in matters of discipline comes from a lack of ability to 
find or analyze the causes of bad order. There is really 
a distinction between what may be called positive weak- 
nesses of the teacher—faults which without blame 
on the part of the pupils bring about disorder — and 
negative weaknesses, the failure of the teacher to deal 
wisely with things started by the pupils. But the 
intuition of boys and girls is such that a teacher’s 
weakness and its response in the pupils are rarely to 
be separated in actual practice. Considering, then, 
the bad order that begins with the pupils, teachers 
need to learn to distinguish two great classes of causes 
which predicate an essential difference in the treatment 
given the overt act. There are:
-P-A-G-E-309
SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 291 
1. Causes which are purely accidental, incidental, 
. or uncontrollable. 
2. Causes which are motivated. 
The careful and experienced teacher so provides for 
every possible situation that accidental causes of 
disorder are reduced to a minimum. The machinery 
of his schoolroom takes care of all ordinary routine 
business without friction and without much chance of 
mishap. Often a more thoroughly organized school- 
room routine will do away with the greater part of a 
teacher’s troubles, especially such as spring from 
noise, confusion, and idleness. The supervisor should 
spend some time in the room and make definite notes 
of the details of organization needed. The causes of 
trouble are usually such as poor marching order, too 
much freedom during intermissions, no definite place 
for school apparatus, a lack of brisk procedure in 
changing work, wandering about the room by pupils, 
noisy habits of putting away or getting out work, no 
rest provision during long school sessions, no recess for 
flushing the room with fresh air, and other similar 
details of poor management. A wise superintendent 
does not dismiss the matter after making suggestions; 
he visits the room frequently until he finds the new 
order of things in good working shape. By that time 
any disorder due to other causes will stand out with 
sufficient clearness to indicate its own proper treatment. 
Mischief that is deliberately made can usually be 
attributed to one of the following motives, and dealt 
with according to the amount of depravity involved: 
1. Vanity — the desire to attract attention. 
2. Laziness — the desire to avoid exertion.

3. The desire to have fun. 
4. The desire to torture — the pleasure in another’s 
suffering. 
Of these motives the last is the most serious and 
perhaps the least common, although young teachers, 
harassed by a set of active persecutors, are liable to 
attribute to it the greater part of their trouble. The 
homeopathic principle of a like cure suggests that 
mischief caused by childish vanity, the desire to “show 
off,” be mended by a judicious thrust at that vanity. 
Where pure physical inertia causes the breach of law, 
the cause lies usually in a poor environment or in some 
physical peculiarity. Very few children are inherently 
lazy; indolence, where it exists in the young, is the 
result of habit or of physical imperfection. A too-fat 
child needs attention to diet and exercise, matters 
which must be taken up with the parents. City chil- 
dren are often habitually lazy because they have neither 
the chores and housework to do that occupy the time 
of country children, nor wholesome amusements to 
take their place. Here play-grounds, or other extra- 
curricular activities, must solve the problem. Boys 
and girls who are growing fast sometimes seem unable 
to concentrate, even for a short time, on mental work. 
They need a temporary rest from it, with manual 
activities to help along physical development and 
occupy the mind without taxing it. This sort of 
remedy is often impossible, owing to the still too 
inflexible curriculum of most of our schools; but the 
teacher who understands the situation may be able 
to arrange a partial change that will at least help things 
along.
-P-A-G-E-311
SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 293 
Inherent love of fun is no longer considered a sin, 
or even a tendency to be discouraged. It is regarde 
as a wholesome and lovely thing that should enlist the 
sympathy of all. The greater the teacher, in fact, 
the more difficult is it for him to forbid those playful 
impulses which are bound to interfere with the neces- 
sarily artificial routine of the schoolroom. In dealing 
with this kind of mischief, the true reason for forbid- 
ding it will usually appeal to a child as forcibly as it 
does to the older people who must cut off a pleasure 
with which they really sympathize heartily. Teachers 
forbid any fun but incidental fun in school hours 
because there is more serious business on hand, and 
because that business can never be done without 
giving it one’s whole attention. A dignified insistence 
on the school’s main business suffices for some children; 
with others, in whom animal spirits outweigh all con- 
siderations of self-interest, isolation or some other form 
of punishment is necessary, after which the fault can 
be cured largely by substitution. 
The innate love of teasing is strong in an extraordi- 
nary number of children, the stimulus that gives it 
expression being found in almost any unkind act or 
word that such children see or hear. The imitative 
faculties of children are particularly sharp where any 
display of authority is concerned; and the spectacular 
ways of showing authority appeal to them especially. 
Everyone knows that a little girl will box or whip her 
dolls with great gusto if she has ever been served in a 
similar way by her mother. Children, like negroes, 
placed in authority over others of their own condition 
are unmerciful. Given a teacher who shows himself The love

sensitive to annoyance, children prove themselves 
very successful persecutors. Although they them- 
selves have never suffered in any poignant way, they 
show a genius in finding ways in which the most ex- 
treme suffering can be inflicted upon the object of their 
persecution. The love of power finds an easy expres- 
sion in acts that show others to be at one’s mercy, and 
so exalt the tyrant in the eyes of his fellows. Any 
helpless person, teacher or fellow-pupil, is liable to be 
the victim. Where this bully attitude seems to be the 
motive behind disorder of any kind, that act, or habit, 
or whatever it may be, should be stopped at any cost 
with all speed and with a frank avowal of emotional 
repugnance. The remedy lies in the building up, not 
of a slow-working rational sense of justice, but of a 
deeply-rooted habitual prejudice. 
Altruistic feelings are largely a matter of habit and 
training. It is foolish to waste time in trying to work 
out a rational response to any appeal to social or per- 
sonal interest here; the work needs to be done in early 
youth through the short-cut, effective means of preju- 
dice, thoroughly ingrained by a liberal appeal to the 
whole force of public opinion. In no place is there a 
better excuse for the use of that well-worn device of 
the teacher, the exaggeration of emotional content, 
than here. The heinousness of the offense of him who 
deliberately causes pain to another can scarcely be 
exaggerated. There are teachers who can produce 
copious tears from Johnny because he has pulled 
Mary’s braids, by a touching talk administered after 
school. Let such teachers add an equally eloquent 
description of the meanness of the desire to hurt
-P-A-G-E-313
  SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 295 
other people, and the method may result in real good. 
Johnny’s sense of humor does not, then, remove the 
effects of the histrionic rebuke when his common-sense 
contrasts the real wickedness of his act with its 
mock-heroic treatment. Whatever the method, the 
treatment can not be too quick, too decided, too 
powerful. The unquestioned use of unquestioned 
authority, rebuking and punishing with the sureness 
of Fate and the swiftness of catastrophic justice, is 
the best remedy for this tendency wherever it shows 
itself. 
In analyzing motives the first requisite for success 
is sympathy with pupils. A real personal acquaint- 
ance will, with young teachers, pretty effectively take 
the place of that quick, almost intuitional insight 
which the experienced instructor develops. Children 
have an immense self-respect and reticence where 
their mental processes are concerned, and self-interest 
will bolster this up, on occasion, to the point where 
only keen ability can detect where the truth lies. 
Sympathy unlocks doors that defy even the keenest 
psychological knowledge; and for that reason, if for 
no other, the teacher who wishes to succeed as a dis- 
ciplinarian needs to improve every opportunity to 
establish friendly relations with pupils. 
Next to a sympathetic attitude toward present 
offenders, a retrospective recall of one’s own past is 
needed. “He can’t remember when he was young” 
is one of the things that no teacher wants to hear of 
himself; he knows that it is one of the most serious 
indictments that youth can bring against an instructor.

misunderstood is one of the best helps in analyzing 
the motives of offenders. 
A third help in analyzing motives is practice, rein- 
forced by comparison and cumulative proof. If the 
supervisor will insist on constant reference to motive 
in each case of corrective discipline that arises, teachers 
will form the habit, and skill will grow with practice. 
To insure this, it is suggested that he require the 
teacher to prepare a table, showing in one column the 
typical acts of a day or a week that have required 
correction; in a second, the motive that the teacher 
thinks has actuated each offense; in a third, the method 
of treatment used in each case, the treatment always be- 
ing aimed to remove the fundamental difficulty or fault. 
Where inquiry results in the teacher’s consciousness 
of a weakness of his own as that cause, or as one of the 
causes, the cure is a comparatively simple matter, 
although it may not be easy. Curing one’s own faults 
is easy compared to the task of curing other people’s, 
for in the former case one has the ally of the will — 
the most powerful single factor in accomplishing the 
desired end. The weaknesses of teachers that result in 
poor disciplinary control are legion. They range from 
the fundamental ones of weak will and low ideals, 
through personal peculiarities, such as noisy and 
undignified manners, carelessness in dress and lan- 
guage, and cool indifference to pupils and their needs, 
to imitated faults for which imitated virtues may be 
substituted. These imitated faults include the un- 
reasonable demands sometimes made by thoughtless 
teachers because some other teacher demands those 
things, and the copied methods of some school or 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 207 
teacher who has made a strong impression upon a 
novice. They include the dislike of a “scene” which 
permits little sources of disorder to grow to great ones 
pending the advent of an imperative call for correction; 
the failure to provide enough activity for the pupils; 
and the indulgence of a vindictive or soured disposition. 
All this preliminary investigation, whether it occupy 
several days’ time or be disposed of in five minutes, is 
for the purpose of guiding the teacher in the applica- 
tion of remedies. The cure’s the thing. The crucial 
function of the supervisor is to give the puzzled teacher 
a means of realizing the ideal of good order. The 
concrete help given will vary with each situation. 
The following suggestions, however, will cover in a 
general way a majority of cases where help is needed: 
1. Stimulate the teacher’s volition — “‘bolster up 
his backbone.” Increase self-dependence and self- 
respect until it reaches a point at which an affront to 
it becomes an unendurable outrage. This attitude 
is not incongruous with a true idea of the teacher’s 
place, importance and function. It is the idea that all 
pupils should have of all teachers, but it is so far from 
the idea held in many communities and families that 
children come to school with no intention of living up 
to it unless forced to do so; and many teachers are so 
susceptible to prevailing public opinion, so uncertain 
of their standing, that they yield to the ideas of their 
pupils instead of insisting that the pupils come up to 
the real standard. Perhaps a majority of cases of bad 
order are due to the timidity or cowardice of some 
teacher — not always the teacher who suffers most 
and in whose room the disorder appears, although this

is usually the case. Sometimes a principal, big enough 
to enforce order in his own presence by dint of appeal 
to physical force, is responsible for bad order in the 
room of a woman teacher whose authority he refuses 
wholly to support. But in the main it is true that a 
teacher who has a sufficiently exalted opinion of the 
dignity of his rank and work, can insist upon deference 
to his authority until he gets it, The process will be 
long and hard unless he has active support from prin- 
cipal, superintendent, and school board; but if patience 
and health hold out, even single-handed a teacher who 
has enough will power can win in the end. Sometimes 
a gently-bred woman recoils so violently before the 
distaste of a conflict with pupils, to whom considera- 
tions of courtesy and self-respect are nothing, that 
she would rather suffer the indignity of a lack of respect 
than make the necessary appeal to force. This is 
where the support of the superintendent, in whom for 
the child force doth finally reside, needs to be made 
apparent; but no display of it can take the place of a 
resolution on the teacher’s part that she will brook 
absolutely no imposition on her prerogatives. She is 
dealing with an elemental situation, with human 
beings but partially developed, and the work must be 
done, if necessary, in an elemental way. She is the 
representative of the organized forces of society, of 
civilization itself, and no personal feelings should stand 
in the way of doing her duty by that society which has 
intrusted her with this part of the progress of the race. 
She dare not betray her trust to bring this boy or girl 
into the fold of social coéperation — by gentle means 
if he will, by force even if must be.
-P-A-G-E-317

2. Put the teacher on the lookout for signs of coming 
trouble and teach him to nip them in the formative 
stage. Preach the consummate virtues of prevention. 
Call attention to the signs of coming mischief — the 
ominous silence, the constrained position, the too- 
innocent look, the idle moment. Show how brisk class 
movements, a diversion that attracts attention at the 
psychological moment, a quick check that strengthens 
the impression of the teacher’s omniscience, prevents 
more mischief than the best teacher could ever hope 
to prevent by means of punishment. 
3. Demonstrate the value of the mechanical controls 
of environment — the quiet;*the orderly way of doing 
things, the system that anticipates sporadic action, a 
fixed, understood, and economical routine. Show the 
advantage of prevision. 
4. If none exist, help the teacher to establish those 
auxiliary school interests which further friendship and 
occupy spare time. Let friendliness between teacher 
and pupil be established upon the basis of common 
interests. Herein lies a great part of the value of 
athletics in school life; and also of music, manual arts 
of various sorts, and social affairs. 
5. Has the teacher hade clear the standard to which 
pupils are expected to conform? If not, how best can 
it be stated? Teachers have become familiar through 
years of training and experience, with the require- 
ments of schoolroom routine; they may find in 
their rooms some boys or girls to whom one or 
more of these are entirely new ideas. Of course 
this is especially true in schools containing a foreign 
element. Signs and

6. Does the teacher know the strength of the support 
upon which he may depend? Does he utilize the 
power of his position as part of a great and irresistible 
social organization? If teachers who are not quite 
sure of their success with this problem could be induced 
more often to report trouble, actual or anticipated, to 
their superiors, so that there might be a thorough 
understanding about it, conditions might be much 
improved. The assurance of support, with the confi- 
dence in a course of treatment which has been decided 
upon after careful consideration, begets confidence 
and courage. The teacher so fortified really seems 
to himself, and appears to his pupils, what he is — 
the agent of the good forces of society, rightly em- 
powered to enforce society’s dictum against those 
who wrong it. 
7. The teacher must be especially warned never to 
desert a standard until he is convinced that it is wrong. 
8. The subject of appropriate, just, and helpful 
punishment should be thoroughly discussed by the 
teaching force of every school. The teachers, rather 
than the school board, or some one man at the head of 
a system, are best fitted to decide what types of pun- 
ishment are necessary or advis@ble in any given com- 
munity. They are closer to the pupils in their daily 
lives; they know their home environment and training 
= often the most important factors in deciding school 
punishments — better than anyone else. And the 
carefully considered conclusion of the whole body of 
teachers, led usually by those who have had longest 
experience in the schools, is the best guide for the 
teacher young in the system.   
 
-P-A-G-E-319

9. The friendliness following a reconciliation should 
be complete. A supervisor in a Western normal 
school gave her teachers, with other instructions, this 
list of hints for disciplinary management: 
Be a person who commands the respect of all. 
Make your requirements just, reasonable, explicit. 
Use the conventional forms of courtesy in directing 
pupils. 
Notice and correct the first infraction of good order. 
Be tactful, low-voiced, firm. 
Do not hastily attribute fault to a child. 
Do not expect disorder; assume that your pupils are 
anxious to do right until they prove the contrary. 
Provide for all possible emergencies. 
This chapter has dealt with the part of the supervisor 
in securing good schoolroom discipline so far only as 
that duty pertains to the teachers under his direc- 
tion. There is another phase of the possible influence 
of supervisors, especially superintendents of schools, 
which deserves at least a passing consideration. This 
is the part of the superintendent of schools in molding 
the public opinion of his community. The man who 
is at the head of a system of schools in a city or town 
in our country is an increasingly important individual. 
Aside from the immense potential influence he wields 
as a teacher of the next generation, he is looked to more 
and more as an authority upon the questions of the 
day. If he choose to do so he may exert a powerful 
influence in deciding questions of public economy and 
morals.

  302 DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL 
With the good excuse that he is dealing with condi- 
tions that vitally affect his immediate sphere of use- 
fulness, if any require an excuse of him, the school 
superintendent may and should fight those things in 
the life of his city that hurt the life of his school. He 
has a very direct interest in playgrounds, parks, and 
social centers. He has a right to say something about 
the motion pictures that are shown in local theaters, 
the posters that adorn the great billboards, the tone of 
the newspapers that the people read. All these things 
react for good or for evil upon the spirit and order 
of the schools. The influence of the superintendent, 
wielded directly as a member of official bodies, or 
through the press, or indirectly through women’s clubs 
and good citizenship leagues, may help materially to 
better those conditions of health and morals that re- 
act so strongly upon the children in the schools. By 
exercising this prerogative of his position the superin- 
tendent reaches back to the ultimate causes, to the real 
sources of school disorder, which are ignorance and 
selfishness, permeating still the whole laboring, strug- 
gling mass of humanity and manifesting themselves 
not only in the deliberate sins of responsible men and 
women, but also in the blind lawlessness of misguided 
children. 
SUMMARY 
In supervising discipline, the duties of the super- 
visor include analyzing the situation, to find both the 
nature and cause of the trouble; and then suggesting 
the remedy which should be applied. His duties in- 
clude giving every possible aid to the teacher in charge. 
He may help by stiffening a weak will, by pointing out
-P-A-G-E-321
  SUPERVISION OF DISCIPLINE 303 
the signs of trouble that the teacher may be upon his 
guard, giving information of devices which will obviate 
trouble, suggesting auxiliary interests that will stim- 
ulate interest, supporting the teacher in his own efforts, 
and suggesting proper means of punishing offenders. 
Besides his work with his own teachers, the superin- 
tendent should use his influence to better those com- 
munity conditions which affect the spirit and character 
of the school.

1The value of such notices can scarcely be overestimated. One 
standing complaint of parents is that they are not informed of the poor 
work or behavior of their children until it is too late to find an effective 
remedy. The reason is usually that the teacher is so overworked that 
he cannot find time to make a visit at the home or write a note. The 
frequent suggestion of the ready blank, and the ease with which it may 
be filled out and sent, will help to keep parents informed of the prog- 
ress of their children, or the lack of it. Such notices should asa rule 
be sent through the mail.

  336 APPENDIX III 
II. In Country Scnoor Systems 
It is generally recognized that the lack of adequate super- 
vision is perhaps the chief cause of the poor condition of our 
American country schools. The existing officers preside over 
districts too large, having often means of transportation too 
limited, to permit of really effective supervision. In many 
places precedent for any kind of real oversight is entirely want- 
ing. In others the clerical work incident to the office of county 
superintendent takes practically all his time. New and better 
schemes of administration are being used in some parts of 
the country, and additional officers are securing better results 
than were formerly possible. Much, however, can be done by 
requiring more frequent and more detailed reports than have 
been given in the past. Forms for such reports are given below.

Such a report as the foregoing will be found helpful in ascer- 
taining the true condition of affairs in sections of the country 
where there is known to be much trouble with discipline. It 
enables the supervising officer to locate specific cases, to give 
his personal attention to them if necessary while they are still 
recent offenses, and to find out where weak teachers, cowardly 
school boards, and communities of low standards exist. Where 
disciplinary trouble is not so prevalent, the following report, 
sent immediately after the event, may be more helpful; or this 
report may be used to supplement the monthly report, or to give 
notice of cases that require immediate help.

Sometimes it is very helpful for a county officer to have 
reports from the local boards, where such exist; and this is 
especially the case where there is a suspicion that the fault lies 
with the teacher. In any case it gives to the supervisor another 
view of the situation than the teacher’s, and so helps him to 
know his problem better. The following form is intended for

An annual report from each district, in counties where there 
is little trouble, will enable a supervisor to ascertain which are 
the weak or unfortunate districts in his territory, and perhaps 
also help in indicating weak and strong teachers. Such reports 
tend also to set a standard of good behavior, and give a strong 
incentive for its realization. If an honor roll of schools in 
which no bad behavior has been reported during the year be 
established in connection with the reports, the immediate in- 
centive will be stronger; but it may also militate against honesty 
in reporting trouble, and should be used only after careful 
consideration of conditions and needs.

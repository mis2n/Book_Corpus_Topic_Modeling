PREFACE. 
The problem of arithmetical teaching has been attacked in the 
past from many avenues of approach. Several interesting treat- 
ises, written from almost every point of view except from the 
insights gained by careful first-hand study of cases and experi- 
mental trial of adults and children, have appeared. While these 
have been suggestive and valuable according to their lights, man- 
ifestly they are makeshifts awaiting more thoroughgoing and 
systematic attempts to render available to teachers and students 
of education the scholarly investigations that have been going 
on for the past decade or more and that have been entombed for 
the most part in the libraries of our universities. Many of these 
need popularizing and to an extent rewriting, since, unfor- 
tunately, our best investigators are not always our best expositors. 
If the author has succeeded in summarizing and organizing to 
some extent these widely scattered studies into the genesis, 
psychology, statistics, and didactics of number in a manner to 
make them readable and interesting as well as more concisely 
contributory to the kind of material which he feels must be the 
subject-matter of the prolegomena to any future arithmetical 
didactic, he will feel duly rewarded. 
Tn all of this work as well as in the original work of part two, 
heartfelt acknowledgment of the helpfulness and guidance of 
Assistant Professor Paul R. Radosavljevich, of the faculty of the 
School of Pedagogy of New York University, is hereby made; 
also to Professor Robert McDougall and especially to Dean 
Balliet of this School for epsouragement and counsel. Thanks z= <

INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
The following treatise is based on a thesis on the psychology and 
pedagogy of arithmetic prepared by the author in the department of 
education of the graduate school of New York University and accepted 
by the faculty of that school in partial fulfillment of the requirements 
for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 
The first part of the book constitutes a very complete résumé of the 
extensive experimental literature on this subject and makes it readily 
accessible to the general student. It will serve equally well as a con- 
venient guide to the special student who desires to make a first-hand 
study of it. 
The second part forms the author’s own research, and is an impor- 
tant contribution both because of its positive results and as a scholarly 
critique of the technique employed by other investigators. 
The experimental method will do for pedagogy in the future what 
it has done so effectively for psychology during the last half century, by 
placing it on a more scientific basis and eliminating the element of 
speculation from the study of problems which lend themselves readily 
to experimental methods of investigation. 
The definite results already attained, although relatively meager, are 
yet of such general interest and importance that we cannot afford 
to disregard them in making school programs and determining methods 
of teaching. The author of this book has therefore rendered an impor- 
tant service, besides making an original contribution of much interest, 
in making these results accessible, in convenient form, to the classroom 
teacher as well as to the busy superintendent and principal of schools.

INTRODUCTION. 
A study in the pedagogy of arithmetic will include at least the 
following lines of inquiry: (a) the origin and development of 
number concepts in primitive men and in children (anthropo- 
genetic studies): (b) the mental functioning of adults capable of introspection and description with reference to the processes 
involved (psychological studies) : (c) the objective study of abili- 
ties and efficiency and their economical development with a view 
to the possible discovery of relationships, causes and hindrances 
(statistical studies); (d) the objective study of the school child’s 
apprehension of number (experimental didactics). In addition 
to these four main lines of inquiry and, indeed, involved in them 
to a greater or less extent, it will be desirable to consider some- 
what such topics as the hygiene of arithmetic (normal and health- 
ful learning); arithmetical prodigies (geniuses, but primitive in their arithmetical processes) ; transfer (how far does an ability de- 
veloped to deal with one set of materials pass over to the dealing with another set) ; ideational types (arithmetical working-types of imagery). Upon the basis of such studies only, can be founded a scientific curriculum and a scientific method. 
“No pedagogue has anywhere even attempted to sum up the copious but scattered anthropological, experimental, pedagogical, 
psychogenetic and phylogenetic resources: now available” lin arithmetic] (G. Stanley Hall). In the following pages an attempt, though far from exhaustive, will be made to give this summary. 
Our purpose then is (1) to review at some length and in a

measure criticize, supplement and organize the recent literature 
bearing on the lines of inquiry mentioned above, and (2) to give 
an account of a series of experiments tried by the author in order 
to study at first hand (a) the arithmetical abilities of certain 
school children, (b) the problem of the school child’s concepts of 
number.

A REVIEW OF REPRESENTATIVE STUDY 
OF NUMBER. 
1. GENETIC Stupres.! 
(a) Primitive Men. 
The origin and development of the number sense in primi- 
tive man has been studied in considerable detail by L. L. Conant 
(x) and W J McGee (2). Of course, primitive men have long 
since turned to dust; so that the method of procedure must be to 
investigate the conditions in existing peoples who are still in varying stages of savage culture. The anthropological assump- 
tion is that the course of mental progress is approximately uniform 
and is by natural means, so that the growth stage of a people may 
be determined by studying the mentality of other peoples devel- 
oped to a corresponding stage. 
It might be supposed that the development of the number sense 
could only proceed pari passu with the development of number 
names, and that the limits of the latter would set the limitations 
of the former; or again that the convenience for counters of the 
fingers and ten toes would give rise, very early in human history, 
to decimal or vigesimal number systems. But a study of the 
beginnings of number systems shows “that (r) the origin of num- 
ber names is at the bottom of the scale of human development, 
that is to say, comes late, (2) primeval man does not cognize 
quinary and decimal systems, (3) does not use his toes, fingers, 
‘etc., as mechanical adjuncts to nascent notation” (2, p- 654). 
Many primitive peoples count by fingers and hands, sometimes 
with the addition of toes and feet, and thereby fix quinary, 
decimal and vigesimal systems; but the burden of evidence is that 
these are far from primeval. 
The paucity of number names among savage tribes is illustrated 
by the following examples cited by McGee (2). Some Australian

1914, XXV, pp. 5-10.

tribes count laboriously up to 2, 3, 4, or 6, sometimes doubling 2 
to make 4 or 3 to make 6 and in other ways revealing a quasi- 
binary system; certain Brazilian tribes are described as counting 
only to 2, 3, 4, usually with an additional name for many; the 
Tasmanians counted commonly to 2, sometimes to 4, and were 
able to reach 5 by the addition of one to the limital number (four 
and one more). But it should be noted that this paucity of 
number names did not set the limit to numerical capacity. Most 
tribesmen reveal the germ of notation in the use of sticks, notches, 
etc. By means of these and of gesture language they symbolized 
numerical values beyond the limits of the number names. In the 
savage mind, and (as we shall see) in the child’s mind, the series- 
jdea as an abstraction precedes the naming. Modern names are 
the product of gradual evolution motivated by a felt necessity to 
express the series-idea already present. Our savage ancestors 
found it a tremendous task to reach a very meager number ex- 
pression; that their conception of number far outran their ability 
to express is shown by much anthropological evidence, Conant 
(x), Phillips (5); e.g., the original inhabitants of Victoria had no 
numerals above two, yet they counted and even recorded the 
phases of the moon. 
The foundational study of McGee (2) bids us consider as funda- 
mental to an understanding of the number systems of the earliest 
men that these men were beyond everything egoists and mystics 
with strange and (to us) mysterious ways of orientation. Binary, 
quaternary and senary systems become to them subconsciously 
ternary, quinary and septenary respectively. Quaternary does not 
remain purely quaternary, but by the addition of a vagueunity (the 
ego, from which all things procecd) becomes quinary, the system 
of fours becomes in thought as well as in graphic representation 
a system of fives, sixes becomes sevens, and these by a process of 
_augmentation form the bases of the larger numbers which belong 
to the respective systems.

An examination of some of the mechanical symbolisms will 
serve to make the method clear. The four-five system is repre- 
sented by + or :-:. (Note that the point of intersection of the 
lines of the cross, or the middle dot represents the unity that is 
always counted in by the primeval man, himself, the It.) This 
symbol is raised from 4 + 1 to 8 + 1 by adding a line or dot to 
each of the four cardinal extremities, thus a or -b “The 
mystical middle is persistent and can f count- 
ed but once howsoever the value be augmented” (2, p. 662). 
Again the 8 + 1 is raised to 12 + 1 by the addition of dots, 
thus b or still higher, “17 representing 20 + I, etc.; or by   
the development fl ‘of the “meander,” represent- 
ing 16 + 1, etc. The augmentation may pro ceed thus 
indefinitely:

as The six-seven system is produced by the superposition of a 
binary system on the quaternary system. “It is more compli- 
cated and modified through the difficulty of depicting tridimen- 
sional relations on a bidimensional surface. Among the Pueblo 
peoples this is overcome by bisecting two of the quadrants, thus

lar figure x (2, p. 662). From the first figure augmen-

The binary-ternary system, from which the quatern-quinary sys- 
tem is derived by augmentation, is lacking in graphic representa- 
tion. It was produced in a manner similar to the others.

It will be observed that some of the numbers occur in more than 
one system; these were deemed of unusual mystical significance. 
“These number systems are distinct ftom Aryan arithmetic, both 
in motive and mechanism. They are devices for divination, for 
binding the real world to the supernal, and it is only later or in 
an ancillary way that they are prostituted to practical uses; 
yet by reason of the extraordinary potency imputed to them they 
dominate thought and action in the culture stages to which they 
belong and profoundly affect the course of intellectual develop- 
ment. The base of the system is a measure of the intellectual 
capacity normal to the culture stage to which it belongs” (2, p. 
660). 
The investigation shows that the binary-ternary system is the 
earliest; higher in the scale of human development are the 
quatern-quinary and senary-septenary systems. It may seem 
strange that having hit upon a concept of five in the quatern- 
quinary thenceforth the development of the convenient decimal 
system should not be rapid. But the definite quinary concept from 
which the step to ten would have been easy was missed by many 
primitive tribes, although it was possessed by the ancestors of the 
Arabs with their decimal system, by the Mexicans who had a 
vigesimal system, and a few others; and we find in many lands a 
distinct development of the senary-septenary system instead. 
Finger counting, then, is a comparatively late development, for 
if it had existed early, it would have led to the early rise of the
-P-A-G-E-17
i aii eR i co is i i a Ra Cah 
Genetic Studies 5 
decimal system. Direct observation of savage tribes in the ear- 
liest stages of culture confirm this absence of finger counting, for 
many of them are found to be unable to count their fingers with- 
out the use of other symbols. 
It would be of more anthropological than mathematical interest 
to trace the influence of the almacabala described above on the 
social and fiducial systems of primeval man and their relation to 
his ways of orientating himself. The dualistic (binary) concep- 
tion of the cosmos existing among the earliest men (and further 
back among animals), the danger side in front, the safety side in 
the rear, merges into the antithesis of sea and land; the sea full of 
horrors, the land the haven of safety. Still later the strand of the 
shore stretching on either hand, as the sea is faced, characterizes 
the quaternary stage of culture. More important from our point 
of view is the law of augmentation which lies at the basis of the 
source of certain vestigial features still persisting in Aryan culture. 
The three number systems described have all left vestiges, some 
of which persist even to modern times among civilized peoples. 
They may be traced to peoples still living in the lower culture 
stages, thus serving to establish the course of the development of 
number concepts and to throw light upon the numeration of our 
savage ancestors. 
A few examples cited by McGee follow: The 6-7 system 
survives as the bridge connecting almacabala and mathematics. 
In the graphic form it became the Pythagorean hexagon of two 
superposed triangles, the hexagram of Brianchon (Paracelsus), 
the subrational hexagram of Pascal, etc. The astrologic seven 
retarded acceptance of the discovery of the eighth planet, 
Neptune: In the numerical form six, and more especially seven, 
play large réles in the classical and sacred literature revived 
during the Elizabethan period. Nine (from the 2-3 and 4-5 
systems) survives in the Muses, nine lives of the cat, effeminacy 
of the tailor; it even survived in the school books of the early
-P-A-G-E-18
    
6 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
part of the century in the more curious than useful arithmetic 
process of casting out nines; thirteen in all three systems is still 
the messenger of evil in the minds of many; seventh son of a 
seventh son needs no training for medical craft, nor seventh 
daughter of seventh daughter as seeress. 
It seems, then, that we have here the historical presentation of 
the beginning of mathematics. The archaic method was “to use 
integral numbers as tokens of extra-natural potencies rather than 
as symbols for natural values; to combine them by a simple rule 
tending to develop into algorismic processes; and to represent the 
numerical combinations by mechanical devices tending to develop 
into geometrical forms; the system being characterized by the 
method of reckoning from an ill-defined unity counted but once in 
each combination” (2, p. 664), ‘so that in all cases the exoterically 
mystical number carried an esoteric complement in the form of a 
simple unity reflecting the egoistic personality or subjectivity of 
the thinker” (2, p. 656). 
The quinary, decimal and vigesimal systems set forth by 
Conant (r) with their accompaniment of counting by fingers 
and hands, sometimes with toes and feet, mark later stages of 
culture and form transitional steps to our modern system. As 
mankind progressed, counting was divorced from its supernal 
connections and became motivated more and more by practical 
ends of more precise adjustment to the environment. But for a 
long, long time man remained in the mere counting stage objecti- 
fying his series by objects and marks for the most part (number 
names being but a meager possession); it is only when the savage 
becomes a thinking human being that number in the mathe- 
matical sense can be grasped by him. At this point ‘‘mere reckon- 
ing ceases and arithmetic begins” (r, p. 73)- 
To go back into our animal ancestry to search for earlier begin- 
nings is interesting but futile. It is certain that the highest ani- 
mals and the lowest savages have in common mathematical ability
-P-A-G-E-19
  
Genetic Studies 7 
of a certain (or uncertain) sort which enables them to distinguish 
differences between small groups, and in some cases apparently 
to determine absolute number. The classical instance of the 
crow which could tell that one was absent from a group of not 
more than four men (simultaneous presentation) ; the nightingale 
which could tell when it had finished its meal of three worms 
given oneata time (successive presentation) ; the parent wasp which 
supplies its young with a food supply of five to twenty-four vic- 
tims, no more, no less, according to its species; these are cases in 
point. Did these animals count or was their apprehension merely 
quantitative? Whatever the answer it applies equally well to the 
animal or the savage, since the objective product is the same in 
both. It would seem that we have here a capacity ultimate in its 
nature, with its roots lying far back in prehuman evolution, 
which because of its ultimate nature must, as Conant says, be left 
in the region of pure speculation. 
(b) Children. 
All will agree, perhaps, that progress beyond mere rudimentary 
quantitative discrimination depends upon the ability to count. 
There seems to be little difference of opinion concerning this 
among observers, experimenters, psychologists and philosophers 
(Lay, Meumann, Phillips, Messenger, Dewey). However intui- 
tive and instantaneous the apprehension of number may seem 
to the mature mind, psychogenetic analysis shows it to be gener- 
ated by slow degrees through counting. The child, then, must 
and does count. Does the child count spontaneously, instinct- 
ively, or must he await the development of a power, however low, 
of abstraction and generalization? 
This problem has been quite thoroughly investigated by 
Phillips (5). He experimented on kindergarten children, con- , 
sulted primary teachers, and collected data from 616 persons by
-P-A-G-E-20
    
8 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
means of a questionnaire, 235 men, 319 women, 62 neutral; 72 per 
cent of these teachers, 4o per cent having taught over five years. 
Phillips found the following facts which called for interpreta- 
tion. 
Children, before they have learned the number names, are 
observed to follow a succession of stimuli or to create a succession 
long before there is any conscious idea of number. They will 
repeat a series of sounds, as the strokes of the clock, throw down 
a given number of blocks time and again. A boy under two rolled 
one after the other ten mud balls down an incline, marking one 
each time until each contained a little cross. Tallying with the 
fingers or toes, nodding the head, rhythmical articulations of 
various sorts, etc., are the characteristic responses in this stage. 
Having learned the number names as a series of auditory 
symbols mechanically associated with one another (this he does 
very soon through imitation before he learns to read or to write), 
he uses them indiscriminately and without reference to objecta 
of any kind. Thirty-three out of thirty-nine children in a 
kindergarten counted without reference to objects. Primary 
teachers consulted say that for some time children count in this 
manner, and, if an attempt is made to apply the counting, the 
series of names constantly tends to run far ahead of the objects. 
Most children are found to learn the names independently of the 
objects. “I placed before little Willie little sticks and told him to 
touch each stick as he counted; he was just as apt to say six or 
any other number when he touched three as to say it correctly” 
(5, p. 262). Children show a passion for counting. They eagerly 
seek the names, catch them readily and use them delightedly. 
They will use the few names they know at first, repeating them 
over and over again, for a series of indefinite length. They recog- 
nize three or four objects at first as individuals, calling the fourth 
one four even when set aside by itself. They change the order of 
the number names, the particular articulatory response being
-P-A-G-E-21
  Genetic Studies : 9 
often a matter of indifference in such cases as elsewhere in their 
counting. To sum up negatively these results in a word: embry- 
onic counting is not a response to outer stimuli; it is not the result 
of the observation of sensible things. The positive correlate to 
this is, counting at first is a motor response to an inner series. 
But what is the nature of this inner series and how is it estab- 
lished? 
Phillips (5) says that it is a consciousness of succession 
that has resulted from a long experience of successions in con- 
sciousness. Moreover, the changes are naively rhythmical. 
This rhythmical subjectivity is an ultimate fact, a possession 
common to all, though not the same in all. Our minds are 
attuned to rhythmical responses but they do not all play the 
same tune. Experiments performed upon the rhythmical sense 
show an indifference point, a length of interval between the beats 
of a metronome, say, more easily and accurately judged than any 
other above or below, but it varies with individuals and with the 
different senses. Series of metronome beats tend to group them- 
selves into rhythmic multiples. This is a matter of common ex- 
perience in listening to the tick of a clock. Children inquire why 
some ticks are longer than others. This synchronization, as I 
understand it, is a category of the subjective ordering of experi- 
ences which we cannot help if we would. The experiences them- 
selves begin at birth. Some of these are rhythmical per se and 
may serve at times as symbols for an internal rhythm, as the 
pulse, respiration, walking, etc. Changes in consciousness are 
continually taking place produced by the varying impressions 
from all the senses. The earliest and most rudimentary form of 
knowledge is a knowledge of a series of changes. “All the experi- 
mental work substantiates James’s thought that number is pri- 
marily strokes of attention.” ‘The tactile sense very early pro- 
duces an endless series of changes in consciousness which soon be- 
come vaguely recognized as distinct both in time and space.  
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
Sound continually plays its part after the first few hours of life; 
random noises, voices, ticking and striking of the clock all contrib- 
ute to the formation of the series-idea” (5, p. 228). All the 
rhythms and the recurrences of life tend to establish (1) the fact 
of succession, (2) the idea of succession. Professor Dewey says 
that changes in consciousness and consciousness of change (from 
the latter of which, according to our hypothesis, the idea of 
number originates) are not the same. Granted; but from what is 
the latter derived if not from the former? 
Changes of consciousness, then, pass over into consciousness 
of change and the series-idea is thus established. As thus estab- 
lished it is abstract, a potentiality of numbering rather than a 
numbering process, a category according to which concrete things 
tend to express themselves. In other words touches, sounds, 
visions, clock strokes, counters of various sorts are the concrete 
symbols of an inner abstract series seeking expression in these 
ways in the absence of a more sophisticated symbolism. These 
symbols at first may be highly particularized, the concreting 
being limited in the case of any individual, but later give rise 
to a general idea expressible by any series of successions. The 
thing to be noted here is that in this stage objects are symbols, 
the group of objects is used in the place of a name. This sym- 
bolization is in advance of the power to name, and enables an 
early vague concept in children and, as we have seen, in savages 
to grow without the aid of a mathematical vocabulary. 
Here ontogeny and phylogeny are in accord. But the child in 
his individual development is at an immense advantage over his 
savage ancestor. “The fact that the child has the number names 
ready to hand gives an immense momentum to the development 
of the number series-idea” (5, p. 238). Enough has probably 
been set down to show that the child’s use of names at first is not 
an application of them to groups of objects, but in this (second) 
stage the names are merely a motor symbolism for the inner series
-P-A-G-E-23
Genetic Studies II 
which he has gained in ways described. Articulatory response to a 
prompting subjective succession-motif now takes the place of other 
motor and objective responses, which were found either in his own 
bodily economy or in sensible presentations with which he created 
or to which he imputed appropriate responses. Having attained 
the articulatory response, he does not at once and altogether 
abandon his more primitive responses; the tendency to use rhyth- 
mical movement, e.g., remains. A child forbidden to use his 
fingers will wiggle toes inside his shoes, etc. 
This stage of consciousness is essentially a counting period, 
and any words that can be arranged into a series would do and 
often does as well as the one which society has furnished him, 
€.g., eeny, meeny, minee, mo, etc. The counting is spontaneous 
and entirely free from sensible observation. The abstraction 
and generalization of number from a group of objects (Dewey) 
and the application of numbers to objects come later and furnish 
the essential problem with the beginning school child. 
The development of the number concept in the mathematical 
sense is mainly a problem that concerns the child of school age. 
Heretofore his number sense has been an idea of succession with 
objects and motor activities (including naming) as symbols of a 
subjective series. Now he must be led to apply his number series, 
not only to successive but to simultaneous presentations, in order 
that he may describe, if need be, his experiences in accuratenumer- 
ical terms. There is substantial agreement that he must derive 
this abstraction, number in the strict sense, through perception of 
things. The apparatus, materials and devices of the school room 
and the guidance of the teacher are the aids that secure the syste- 
matic and economical furtherance of the growing concept. But 
it should not be overlooked that the child comes to school, as a 
rule, with a dawning knowledge, at least, of the meaning and the 
art of applied number, and this signifies that concepts are present 
up toa certain point. The observations and experiments on chil-

dren of pre-school age afford some degree of information on this 
point. 
Theophil Fries! (r906) studied the question how the command 
of the numbers represented by the first digits arises in the first 
years of life. He began with a child of two, using nine-pins. 
When the child’s back was turned he took away as many as three 
pins, but the child seemed to notice nothing unusual. (Preyer had 
said that a ten-months-old child noticed the taking away of one 
pin.) After eight days’ experimenting Fries reached only negative 
results. The difference noticed by Preyer’s child must have been 
quantitative (change in specific magnitude), not numerical. Not 
until the number was reduced to two or three would Fries’s child 
cry: “others.” Further experiment showed that the child really 
commanded no number higher than two. The child could count, 
but at first his counting had no reference to his making out two. 
Nine months later the relation between the mwmbers and the 
number-words for one and two had considerably cleared up. But 
one and two were also associated with small and large, showing 
that form and magnitude were in a sense their background. This 
is important, as will appear later (page 50 ff.). Later the child 
commanded the number three, but did not definitely connect his 
memorized number-words with it. At the age of three and a 
half, three was found to be mastered, but the child did not know 
more than three things when presented. Threeness was found to 
be mastered not only in special adjacency, but also in temporal 
sequence or succession. Just after the child had finished its 
fourth year, experiments on number four were made, which was 
found to be not established—a concept still in the making. 
John I. Jegi’s daughter (r90r) at two years named the numerals 
in correct order to 12, occasionally to 17, but had little sense of 
their real value except in the case of 1 and 2. There seemed a

vague feeling that the higher numbers applied to greater magni- 
tudes; three was a favorite expression for a small number less than 
6 or 7, while 8 and rx were used in designating more. She would 
count the 17 stairs and then say there were 11 or 13, rarely giving 
the right number. At first the numerals were not given in the 
right order. Little progress was made during the four months 
following the second birthday; although she showed marked 
improvement in the ability to compare magnitudes, she made no 
attempt to state her conclusions numerically. 
(c) Prodigies. 
Prodigies, or lightning calculators, as they are popularly called, 
have seemed to most people who have given them only casual 
consideration to be in a class by themselves, inexplicable freaks 
who perform in a manner inconsistent and unconformable with 
ordinary mental laws. However, while those who. have studied 
them find them precocious indeed, yet with a precocity that is not 
freakish, but, on the contrary, entirely natural. I have elected 
to discuss them under the head of genetic studies, because, 
while their performances could well be treated from the stand- 
_ point of pure psychology or of objective efficiency, considerations . 
from which standpoints must enter in at any rate, yet they are 
chiefly important for pedagogy, so far as they are important at all 
in the present state of our knowledge of them, on account of the 
light they incidentally throw on the development of the number 
sense. The prodigies are essentially children or primitive men in 
their numerical operations. It is related that some of them spent 
their early days as prodigies in arranging and piling up pebbles, 
thus trying to symbolize the steps in the series-idea which for 
them was highly abstracted in a manner similar to that of savages 
and children. This same struggle for expression eventuates in 
other instances, as we shall see, in number forms, thus furnishing
-P-A-G-E-26
14 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
another example of analogy in this particular to childhood and, 
may we say, also to the childhood of the race. The biographies 
of most of them reveal that so far as they are mental calculators 
of the unartificial type, they know nothing of books or the learn- 
ing of the schools. They develop short cuts that are marvelous in. 
their effects, but these short cuts are unsophisticated, naive, un- 
influenced by education in the ordinary sense. In short, their 
power seems to be the result of an unusual native capacity to dis- 
cover concepts of the relations of numbers! unknown to most. 
This capacity together with a tenacious memory for numbers 
gives them their precocity. Now if we could know in a measure 
how they came about these concepts or even what they are, new 
light would undoubtedly be thrown on one aspect of the develop- 
ment of the number concept. Perhaps, as Dr. Hall (6) intimates, 
much number power inherent in the race has been strangled and 
become atrophied through ill-advised artificial methods and dis- 
use of natural ones which have passed out like the “lost chord.” 
Tt is a matter of common experience that the knowledge of a few 
short cuts, even with ordinary mortals, increases calculating power 
amazingly. Prodigies provide a largely unexplored field. If 
there are any that are in captivity or that can be caught, let the 
pedagogues get at them. 
The chief studies on this subject are by Scripture (13) and 
Mitchell (12). Mitchell’s is the more careful and thoroughgoing. 
He himself is a minor prodigy and through a study of his own 
case has been able to penetrate the secret of much of the wonder- 
ful work of others. “Natural” calculators develop spontaneously, 
at least in the first instance; artificial calculators use external aids 
from the start. A calculator may begin in the natural way and 
later use artificial methods as Gauss (see biographical sketch page 
28) did in his use of logarithms. George P. Bidder, Jr., whose 
natural gift is doubtful, was greatly dependent upon artificial aids.

Our interest is in the born calculators, cases of mathematical pre- 
cocity, not of deliberately practiced operations. 
Let us get into touch with some of the prodigies through the 
biographical interest. The following sketches are taken in the 
main from Mitchell. (Where they are not the fact is noted.) 
Tom Fuller was born in Africa in 1710, and was brought to 
Virginia as a slave at the age of 14. He never received any school- 
ing and was wholly illiterate. His principal feats in mental calcu- 
lation were the reduction of a number of years, months, days, etc. 
to seconds, finding the sum of a geometrical progression, and mul- 
tiplying as many as nine figures by nine figures. He was ex- 
tremely slow, his longer calculations requiring weeks; his method 
seems to have been exclusively a counting method, more or less 
abbreviated by practice. There is no evidence that he ever 
learned what school boys know as the multiplication table; this 
ignorance, strange as it may seem, would not necessarily militate 
at all against his expertness as a calculator, nor does it furnish 
any explanation of his lack of speed, since, as we shall see, one 
may become even a “lightning” calculator without knowing this 
table. 
Jedidiah Buxton was born in Derbyshire, England, in 1702. 
His father and grandfather were men of some education, but he 
himself had none. Moreover, he was very stupid from childhood, 
not even showing any mathematical ability. Not until the age 
of 12 did he show interest in calculation. Once his well of genius 
was tapped, however, he developed into a major prodigy, and 
became able to handle immense numbers, once (at least) squaring 
a 39-figure number, and making other surprising calculations. 
He was very slow (it took him over two months to perform the 
feat named above) and never got much beyond the counting 
stage. He could calculate while working and carry on two differ- 
ent calculations at once. The fact that he had practically no 
interests outside of calculation is an illustration of the extreme
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
isolation in which the calculating ability may develop. The 
possessors often make no practical application of their facility, 
but exploit it merely for exhibition and money-making purposes. 
To become proficient, however, the prodigies must have found 
an inherent interest in calculation for its own sake, and to find 
audiences must have found many persons similarly interested. 
This inherent interest in figures and processes, as such, which has 
been observed also in children, has its pedagogical application in 
this: that teachers probably agonize too much over the concretion 
of number work for children, much of their work in this direction 
being “love’s labor lost.” (Compare Dr. G. S. Hall, Ed. Problems, 
page 365.) 
To stimulate interest in this review, it may be well before going 
further with our brief biographies to give an example of Buxton’s 
method of procedure, to show how differently from ordinary 
persons (including teachers) the calculator operates. To multi- 
ply 456 by 378, he multiplied successively by 5, 20 and 3 to get 
300 times 456; then multiplied 456 by 5 and that product by 15, 
and added the result to 300 x 456; and finally completed the op- 
eration by adding 3 x 456. It will be noted that, although some 
writers who have discussed prodigies (Scripture, Proctor) have 
thought that an enlarged multiplication table (beyond 12 x 12, 
say, up to 100 x 100) was needed for the larger calculations, there 
is no item, with a single exception, in the foregoing calculation 
requiring a table beyond 12 x 12, or, indeed, any table at all. If 
he used a table at all, he would need a slightly extended one 
to multiply by 15. But in all probability he simply counted in 
the series of multiples of the multiplicand, in each of the several 
operations involved. Mitchell, a minor prodigy himself, who 
through his knowledge of his own methods and his training in 
psychology has gained an insight into the methods of others 
greater than that of any one else who has discussed the subject, 
has shown in his own case how this may be done. For example,
-P-A-G-E-29
Genetic Studies : 17 
to multiply 48 by 64 he would count by 48’s to 384 (= 8 x 48), 
then by 384’s to 1536, then to 3072 (= 8 x 384 = 64 x 48), the 
required answer. 
Zerah Colburn, son of a farmer of little education, was born in 
Vermont in 1804. He began to calculate when 5 years old. His 
power developed gradually and gradually deteriorated through 
lack of practice. His education was fairly good but was subject 
to interruptions. He had only a moderate liking for mathe- 
matics, preferring the languages. His feats were the ordinary 
arithmetical operations, multiplication by five figures, extracting 
square and cube roots (of perfect. powers) and factoring large 
numbers. In extracting roots and factoring he used the method 
of two-figure endings, which is a method more or less common 
with the prodigies. I quote a description of it from Mitchell. - 
“Given the last two figures of a number, the last two figures of 
the square are known; but given only the last two figures of a 
perfect square, the last two figures of the square root are not 
definitely known, although the possible values are usually only 
four in number. Similarly, an odd ending has only one possible 
cube root, but an even ending has either none, or two which differ 
from each other by 50. Now, suppose a given number is known 
or suspected to be a perfect square or cube and its root contains 
only three figures. The first figure can readily be determined by 
inspection and the last two figures must be one of a limited num- 
ber of possible roots of the ending of a given number. It is usually 
easy after a little practice to tell almost at a glance which of the 
possible roots to choose in a given case. In doubtful cases (multi- 
ples of 5, e.g., where the number of possible roots is greater) such 
expedients as casting out 9’s, squaring or cubing one of the sus- 
pected answers or some number near it, or using the three-figure 
instead of the two-figure ending, will help to decide which is the 
correct root” (12, p. 93). 
It is in this class of problems that Mitchell thinks he might
-P-A-G-E-30
18 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
compete with the real prodigies, but “skill in solving such prob- 
lems does not imply special skill or quickness in other branches of 
mental arithmetic. . . . This is a method of guessing by 
inspection of the ending of the given number, not a real calcula- 
tion” (x2, p. 94). In short, it is one of the tricks of the trade 
and is cited here, for one reason, to show the necessity, in striving 
to gain some understanding of the feats of prodigies, for distin- 
guishing between such a method and genuine calculations. The 
application of this method to factoring is still simpler and seems 
to give some promise of usefulness in the school room; it is 
therefore given in Appendix V. 
Henri Mondeux, born in Tours, France, 1826, was the son of a 
wood cutter. Tended sheep at the age of seven and learned calcu- 
lation by the use of pebbles. Later, like several of the other 
prodigies, he became a professional calculator. Unlike many of 
them, he was able to profit by instruction in mathematics and 
showed considerable aptitude up to a certain point. His knowl- 
edge of mathematics enabled him to formulate many ingenious 
processes and to deal with algebraic problems as well as arith- 
metical operations. But he belonged to the natural family of 
great calculators, his methods in the first instance taking shape 
independently of books. 
Jacques Inaudi, born 1867 in Italy, came of a not talented fam- 
ily and early, like Mondeux, became a tender of sheep. While 
thus occupied at the age of six he began calculating; at seven he 
could multiply five figures by five figures mentally. His education 
was very limited and he did not learn to read and write until he 
was 20. His customary feats were subtractions with 21-figure 
numbers; addition of five 6-figure numbers; multiplication of 4- 
figure numbers by four figures; division of two 4-figure numbers; 
simple algebraic problems by trial. In Binet’s tests on Inaudi, 
2-figure multiplications were performed in 2 seconds, 3-figure in 
6.4 seconds, 4-figure, the limit of his ordinary stage exhibitions, in
-P-A-G-E-31
  
Genetic Studies 19 
21 seconds, 5-figure multiplications in 4o seconds; showing that 
in passing from five to six figures he exceeded the limits of his or- 
dinary practice and became confused. 
Ugo Zaneboni, a compatriot of Inaudi and born in the same 
year, had only a fair education. He began calculating at the age 
of 12, his power being well developed at 14. His feats were based 
on railway and similar statistics, evolution with the aid of 2-figure 
endings, also roots of imperfect powers probably by trial and 
memory. It is possible that he made use of a simple number 
form. The use of a number form by prodigies has been later 
referred to (page 47) and the reason for it briefly stated. How 
the number form can aid the calculator will appear to some extent 
in our notice of Mlle. Uranie Diamandi, whose case has been set 
forth at some length by Dr. Mlle. I. Ioteyko in La Revue Psycho- 
logique, III, 1910. It will be possible also to picture the number 
form of George P. Bidder, Jr., since it has been preserved in the 
collection of Galton. 
Johann Martin Zacharias Dase, born in 1824, Hamburg, was in a 
class by himself as a calculator; there seems to have been scarcely 
any limit to his powers. He attended school at the age of two and 
one-half years, took to the stage as a professional at fifteen, but 
while he was probably precocious (i. e., began at an early age) in 
calculation, he was slightly stupid in everything else, even includ- 
ing mathematics. He had a wonderful figure memory and more 
than usual power of apprehending the number of objects in a 
group. He upon occasion multiplied mentally 100 figures by 100 
figures in less than nine hours, extracted the square root of a 
1oo-figure number in less than an hour; he required 54 seconds for 
8-figure multiplications, 40 minutes (41 figures per minute) for 
4o-figure multiplications, and in his too-figure multiplications 
maintained a speed of 20 figures per minute. Dase never dis- 
played any confusion in his work, and it seems that only physical 
fatigue and not the size of the numbers could limit the extent of  
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
his calculations. What tricks (devices for saving calculation) he 
introduced into his work does not appear. Doubtless he made 
good use in this connection of his remarkable figure memory. He 
may have, as Mitchell says, memorized the squares and cubes of 
all numbers up to 100. This would, with the aid of the method 
of endings, enable him to obtain “instantly” three- or four-figure 
roots (of perfect powers) and to approximate the roots of imper- 
fect powers, and so relieve some of the tedium of computation, 
but, of course, is inadequate by itself to explain such monumental 
featsas his. They must have been, in the main, genuinely labored 
calculations. 
We have proceeded far enough, perhaps, to appreciate Mitch- 
ell’s statement of the three grades of mathematical ability in the 
calculators. 
The lowest grade never get beyond the stage of pure counting, 
though practice abbreviates this. At this stage the point 
of view is not even arithmetical; the calculator thinks not 
of operations, but of properties of numbers and of series, and 
the short cuts he uses are of a relatively simple sort, show- 
ing no mathematical insight. (Fuller, Buxton, Inaudi, 
Zaneboni.) 
The second grade have a well developed knowledge of arith- 
metic and an arithmetical point of view. It is operations of calcu- 
lation, not mere properties, in which they are interested, and the 
various short cuts used are, we may suppose, suggested by prac- 
tice rather than by mathematical keenness. In this class may be 
placed Dase, also Colburn. 
The highest grade have real mathematical ability, power to 
take the algebraic point of view, to generalize and hence to dis- 
cover all sorts of ingenious short cuts and symmetries. (Mon- 
deux, Bidder, Sr., Diamandi, Safford, Gauss.) 
Mitchell does not expect this classification to be taken too 
seriously; there are no hard and fast lines, but it serves to bring
-P-A-G-E-33
  
Genetic Studies 21 
out the point that mental calculation and mathematical ability 
are essentially independent. 
George Parker Bidder was born in Devonshire, England, 1806, 
son of amason. One brother had a remarkable memory for Bible 
texts, another was a good mathematician; a nephew had great 
mechanical talent; his son was an excellent mathematician and 
calculator; two granddaughters were above average ability in 
mental arithmetic. The hereditary strain of talent in the family 
is notable, and, while significant possibly in this particular case, 
is not significant in general for prodigies, since the explanation by 
heredity lacks a basis in too many cases. Bidder learned to count 
at the age of six, using pebbles, shot, etc. at first, and soon became 
very proficient in calculation, retaining the power through life and 
using it in his profession. ‘ He became a man of wide interests, well 
educated, able both mathematically and generally. Besides the 
ordinary arithmetical operations, he did multiplications up to 12 
figures by 12 figures; compound interest examples; roots and fac- 
tors by the aid of 2-figure endings, etc. His methods were often 
original, highly ingenious, and rapid. A fact bearing on method 
appears in connection with Bidder. He fancied at first that he 
possessed a table up to 100 x 100, but found that he was in error. 
If he had 89 to multiply by 73, he would say instantly 6497, but, 
in what appeared to be merely an instant of time, according to 
his own account, he multiplied 80 by 70, 80 by 3, 9 by 70 and 9 by 
3 and then added up the products. Note the order of multiplica- 
tion. It begins at the left instead of the right. Many of the 
prodigies use this order. Indeed, as Mitchell says, there is no 
reason except custom why we should not all do this; it is more 
natural and just as convenient. In mental calculation it favors 
combining at each separate stage and so the partial products may 
be forgotten and anxiety relieved. 
George P. Bidder, Jr., son of George Parker Bidder, is classed by 
Mitchell as an “artificial” calculator who was stimulated to his  
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  22 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
comparatively few feats, performed slowly and with occasional 
errors, by the example of his father; artificial in distinction from a 
born or natural calculator who usually begins early before he is 
“spoiled” by contact with schools and inclines to use a counting 
rather than a conventional method. The fact, however, that he 
had a number form affords a presumption, at least, that some of 
his methods were or had been primitive. It is clear that his main 
interests lay outside of calculating. He was educated for the bar 
and practiced law. That he was possessed of considerable ability 
is shown by his having been seventh wrangler at Cambridge in 
1858, at the age of 21. 
Among other things he was able to multiply up to 15-figure 
numbers by 15 figures, by the use of cross multiplication, so 
called. As at least one other calculator (P. Diamandi) used this 
method, which has a curious interest of its own, a description of it 
more detailed than that of Mitchell follows: 
Rule—To multiply a 5-figure number by a 3-figure number by the method of 
cross multiplication: 
Multiply each figure of the multiplicand in turn beginning at the right by each 
figure of the multiplier in the following order: By the units figure twice in succes- 
sion; by the tens figure once; by the units figure; by the tens figure; by the hundreds 
figure; by the units figure; by the tens figure; by the hundreds figure; by the units 
figure; by the tens figure; by the hundreds figure; by the tens figure (next in order 
since the multiplication by the units figure has been completed); by the hundreds 
figure; by the hundreds figure again (since the multiplication by both units figure 
and tens figure has been completed). As each simple product is obtained write it 
or visualize it in its place; add each vertical column of single digits as soon as it is 
completed and write or visualize the sum; lastly perform the reductions in the total 
product, or do this as soon as the sums of the vertical columns are severally obtained; 
write or visualize the figures of the total product in their places.

It will be observed that the figures of the partial products are 
found in vertical lines; first 7; then 5, 6; then 4, 4, 1; then 6, 5, 1, 
etc. Each column is added before the numbers that compose the 
next column are found. The advantage is that the various figures 
of the partial products can be forgotten almost as fast as obtained, 
since that figure of the total product which depends on a given 
column of the partial product is found and recorded as soon as 
the column is known and the numbers in that column therefore 
play no further part in the calculation. 
While this method has its advantages, it is obviously a modifica- 
tion of written multiplication, a derivative from the learning of 
the schools and not a naive procedure such as that of his father 
(see page 21, and Appendix VI). It could only be used by strong 
visualizers such as Bidder, Jr., and P. Diamandi were; the whole

24 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
process was doubtless pictured by them and seen as plainly as if 
written. It is known that Diamandi learned mental arithmetic 
after written arithmetic, and probably Bidder did the same. 
As has been stated, Bidder had a number form which I repro- 
duce here from Galton (Plate 1, fig. 20, opp. page 380, Inquiries 
into Human Faculty), 
  That he did not use it, however, at least in his more elaborate 
calculations, appears from his statement to Galton that when he 
was multiplying together two large numbers his mind was en- 
grossed in the operation, and the idea of locality in the series sinks 
out of prominence. 
Pericles Diamandi, born 1868 in Greece, belonged to a family 
of calculators, having a brother and sister who shared his gift. 
He excelled in mathematics at school and had a more than usual 
talent for languages. His talent for calculating did not appear 
until he entered business at the age of 16. He had good memory 
of the visual type, was possessed of a number form and colored 
audition for some names. This color imagery also appears in the 
case of his sister Uranie, but was of the visual type instead of 
auditory. Diamandi could multiply mentally up to five figures by 
five figures, but not rapidly, using the method of cross multiplica- 
tion. 
Uranie Diamandi"* possesses (at the age of 22) the same apti- 
tudes for mental calculation and the same visual type of memory

Revue Psychologique, III, 1910, pp. 320-328, and Visualization colorée et sens

as her brother, with besides a very remarkable power of color 
visualization. It is from their mother that the two calculators 
think they get their excellent memory. She has received a classi- 
cal education and is facile in the languages and history. In 
mathematics her knowledge does not go beyond elementary arith- 
metic, but she uses many unconventional processes. At school, 
at the age of seven, she first noticed that she performed the little 
calculations proposed more quickly than her fellow pupils. But it 
wasat theage of thirteen that the success of her brother stimulated 
her to cultivate her peculiar talents. At fifteen, she gave her 
first exhibition. The operations performed by her in public were 
additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions; squaring a 
number of 4 to 6 figures; extracting the square or cube root of a 
number of 8 to ro figures; extracting fourth to eighth roots of 
‘numbers of 8 to 12 figures; writing on the board without pause the 
square of all the numbers from 2 to roo; calculating the number of 
minutes and seconds elapsed since a given date, e. g., in the year 
1453, keeping account of the leap years; indicating the day of the 
week corresponding to any given date, the day being known to 
the questioner. Her general memory is excellent, but her special 
memory for figures is phenomenal. A feat which illustrates this 
is her grasping and reproducing in two or three minutes as many 
as 25 figures arranged in a square. The figures seem literally 
photographed upon her brain and are projected upon an imagi- 
nary table lying before her eyes. Theimage, instead of being vague’ 
and fugitive as it would be in the case of ordinary persons, remains 
with a remarkable clearness for a certain time in a conscious 
condition in all of its original complexity. Once having disap- 
peared, it is susceptible to recall after an astonishingly long time. 
In the matter of retentivity Mlle. Diamandi differs from her 
brother. She is prodigal of her power, as, perhaps, at her age she 
can afford to be, and violates the law of economical mental func- 
tioning. Her brother says that the figures remain graven in his  
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
memory for only two days, but that it would be easy to prolong 
the time by making a certain effort. His habit, however, in order 
to avoid fatigue in his frequent séances is not to do this. He has 
acquired the faculty of forgetting, to the end that he may not 
uselessly encumber his memory. This is good psychology. The 
old forms of memory ought to disappear entirely as do the intel- 
lectual elements which have served as a basis for them. Forget- 
fulness, relative amnesia, is to be considered as a condition of 
psychic renewal. As she grows older Mlle. Diamandi should 
certainly take account of this law, especially in view of the fact 
that her retentivity will diminish. 
Mlle. Diamandi’s number form is of interest because she has 
been able to give a good description of it and makes constant use 
of it in her work. The naive demands which she makes upon it 
mark her as having some of the characteristics, at least, of the 
born calculator, in distinction from her brother, who is classed by 
Mitchell as wholly of the artificial type. 
She began to see it at the age of fifteen during her first public 
séance. The form by reason of its constancy and relative fixity 
appears with the characters of a stereotyped image. It is a 
square inclosed by figures with a free space in the interior which is 
the field of operations. Every number proposed appears at once 
at its place in the chain of numbers. Each operation carries in 
the central part the mental inscription of the several principal 
numbers. If it is necessary to make a clear place in view of a new 
operation, the image of the figures is relegated to the higher por- 
tion of the field of operations, where it appears to hide itself, but 
always within the form. Later, after two or three days, the num- 
bers appear to her elsewhere; they are seen in deposit, as it were, 
in the upper part of her subjective table on the outside of the form. 
The figures to be retained, on the contrary, do not cross the chain, 
but they are not continuously seen, appearing only at the moment 
of need, They are for the time being vague, but become definite
-P-A-G-E-39

by an effort of memory. The part outside the chain appears to be 
a “magazine” of numbers to be retained longer than the others. 
The part inside next to the chain will be, on the contrary, affected 
by the numbers which are not in play at the moment, but which 
are known as just beyond to be recalled without delay. Finally 
the numbers actually in play appear in the central part of the 
field of operations. 
The part played by color imagery in Mlle. Diamandi’s case is 
probably unique in the history of prodigies. If she thinks of a 
number, a letter of the alphabet or the name of a day, the images 
which she has in her mind appear colored with perfect clearness. 
In the number form the several figures of each composite number 
have their own peculiar colors, always the same, and the number 
as a whole has its color. The chain of numbers is as a flowery 
garland projected upon a gray background. A peculiarity of this 
colored number form is that closing the eyes is fatal to it, nothing 
remaining except a vague form without figures or colors. With 
the eyes open, the mental coloration of the figures enters as a cause 
into their recall and consequently into the facility of mental 
calculation. When a figure is forgotten its recall is facilitated if 
its color forms a contrast with the neighboring figure (already in 
mind). For example, 104 (black, white, maroon) is easy to 
apprehend and retain because o, which is white, is found placed 
between two dark colors; likewise 129 (black, light yellow, brown) 
is more easily grasped and retained by reason of contrast. It is of 
psychological interest to know that, while the numbers thought 
of bring with them the colors, the contrary does not happen. 
The colored visualization serves to enrich the associations and 
thus to furnish additional clues in the effort of number recall. 
Truman Henry Safford was born in Vermont in 1836. His 
father was interested in mathematics and his mother had been a 
school teacher. He exhibited an all-round precocity; began to 
calculate between the ages of three and five, studied higher mathe-  
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
matics at eight, computed and published almanacs at nine and 
ten. His education was extended and he displayed an interest in 
all studies, but especially in mathematics and astronomy. He 
could perform easily and rapidly all of the feats of calculation 
already described, including the extraction of roots and finding 
of factors (by the aid of two-figure endings) and the multiplication 
of one large number by another (in one case, each factor was com- 
posed of r8 figures). His memory, of the auditory type, was ency- 
clopedic in scope, not confined to figures. An idiosyncrasy which 
must have lent interest to his performances was a marked habit 
of nervous contortion and restless movement during calculations, 
sometimes amounting to almost a riot of convulsive manifesta- 
tions, an exhibition doubtless also of psychological interest if one 
could understand its full significance. 
André Marie Ampére, born in 1775 in Lyon, France, was also 
precocious, beginning calculation with the aid of pebbles, etc. at 
the age of. three or four. Became an all-round scholar and 
especially distinguished as a physicist. Specific information con- 
cerning his work as a calculator is largely lacking. 
Carl Friedrich Gauss, born in Germany in 1777, began calculat- 
ing in his third year and probably retained his power through life. 
He became a mathematician of the highest rank and used his 
knowledge of mathematics (e.g., logarithms) as an aid in calcu- 
lating. He was, however, as we gather from his early beginning, 
a born calculator and one of the few cases in which calculating 
power and mathematical ability are found together. Here again 
the data with respect to work as a prodigy are meager. 
Frank D. Mitchell, upon whom we have drawn most largely in 
our review of prodigies, himself had considerable aptitude for 
mental calculation and may be regarded as a minor prodigy of the 
natural type. His interest in calculation began at the age of three 
or four years. He learned to count to ro, then to 100, then 
beyond; also by 2’s, 3’s, etc. In the series 2 x 2, 2x 2x 2, 3 x 3,
-P-A-G-E-41
Genetic Studies 29 
3 X 3 xX 3, etc., in short, the powers of the number by which he 
was counting were natural resting places and awakened his 
interest, so that before long he began to count in the power series 
of different numbers (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.; 3, 9, 27, 81, etc.) for 
considerable distances. At first he simply emphasized the powers 
as they occurred in the complete series of multiples, but gradually 
he learned to omit the intermediate multiples and simply count 
in the power series proper: 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.; 3, 9, 27, 81, etc. But 
almost always when the number exceeded 100, he emphasized the 
last two figures and gradually got into the habit of ignoring all 
the others. Thus instead of saying 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 
6561, etc., he usually counted 3, 9, 27, 81, 43, 29, 87, 61; and in 
this simplified form counted along for considerable distances. It 
may be said here that Mitchell’s mental calculations take the 
form almost exclusively of tracing the last two figures through the 
different operations, ignoring all the other figures, the problems 
which he solves by preference being of the general form of finding 
the last two figures of any power (or integer root) of any number. 
Thus the counting cited above is a typical computation of the last 
two figures of the 8th power of 3 (6561). At first the process was 
3, (6), 9, (28), 27, (54), 81, (62), 43, (86), 29, (58), 87, (74), 61. 
(To make this procedure clear, I have worked out more details 
than Mitchell gives; for which, see Appendix IIT.) He would 
pass over the intervening multiples (in parentheses above) 
lightly, in time learning to omit them altogether, and before long 
the process came to be simply 3, 9, 81, 61; that is, simply squaring 
each number to get the next, the intermediate counting taking 
place so rapidly and automatically as hardly to appear in con- 
sciousness at all except in brief flashes. And even these flashes 
were sometimes almost absent, so that only the 3 and the 61 
stood out, the rest remaining a mere blur. 
Multiplication naturally grew out of this counting process, but 
it was really counting rather than multiplication proper, since he
-P-A-G-E-42
  30 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
did not learn the multiplication table until some time later when 
he went to school. Thus to find 9 x 7 at this time he would count 
9, 18, etc. to 63, and even at the time of writing his study of 
prodigies, except within the limits of the multiplication table as he 
learned it to 12 x 2, his mental multiplications were abbreviated 
countings of this sort (skipping most of the intermediate links) 
rather than true multiplication. There is reason to believe, 
says Mitchell, that at least two of the major prodigies never 
got beyond this counting process; none of them, with the 
possible exception of Gauss and Dase, used an enlarged table 
(memorized so as to be automatic in its action like the school 
table), and even in these two cases there is no direct evidence, only 
the bare possibility. The feats of such men as Buxton, Colburn, 
Mondeux, Dase, and Bidder (who belong to the natural family 
of great calculators), whose methods in the first instance took 
shape independently of books, can be explained without presup- 
posing a table reaching beyond ro x 10 or 12x 12. The child who 
becomes a calculator begins to multiply soon after he learns to 
count; his habits and methods are definitely formed before a table 
beyond ro x 10 is needed. 
Mitchell has a strong preference for working with even num- 
bers. By a special method he practically always changes odd 
numbers into even numbers for calculating purposes where only 
the last two figures are required. The even number thus obtained 
is readily converted into the desired odd number. (For method of 
conversion, see Appendix IV.) 
In the course of his calculations or countings a number of 
properties gradually attracted his attention, such as that every 
power of a number ending with o or 5 ends with 0 or 5, that the 
4th power of any other number ends with 1 or 6 according as it 
is odd or even, that the 5th power ends with the same figure as 
the first, the 6th power with the same figure as the 2nd, etc., and 
that if 76 or any number ending with 76 is multiplied by a multi-
-P-A-G-E-43
  
Genetic Studies 31 
ple of 4, the last two figures of the product are the same as those 
of the multiplier (e. g., 12 x 76 = 912). 
When the calculation takes account of all the figures, Mitchell’s 
powers of mental arithmetic are little above the average. The 
multiplication of two-figure numbers takes him longer mentally 
than on paper, and with three-figure numbers it is such an effort 
to remember the partial products that usually each one must be 
repeated aloud two or three times, and even then he is apt to for- 
get the first partial product by the time he has found the third. 
With small two-figure numbers he can on paper, using one figure 
of the multiplicand at a time, multiply in a single operation, 
especially where the number is even, e. g., 24 or 36. With 19 or 
23, also, it would probably be easier to multiply in a single opera- 
tion than in two operations in the ordinary way; but in such a case 
after the products exceed 100 the multiplication would often tend 
to resolve itself into counting, rapid and automatic, but counting 
nevertheless. Thus, up to 5 x 23 = 115, he would probably count 
by 23 directly or depend on his memory; but after that, to pass 
to 6 x 23 = 138, he would first count in the 3, then the 20, thus 
reaching 138 from 115 via 118 and 128. 
To square a number, as 162, which contains no prime factors 
except 2 or 3, he multiplies successively by 3, 3, 2, 3, 3 (486, 1458, 
2916, 8748, 26244); in other cases of squaring comparatively 
small numbers he often uses the algebraic formula (a + 6). 
Psychological Considerations. In the light of our biographical 
review, and the data regarding calculating procedure therein 
included, it is possible to get some clue to the psychology of the 
prodigy. 
1. One fact stands out, I think, undeniably. The prodigy 
is a genius. Now the phenomenon, called genius, is ultimate 
in its nature and is its own explanation; one cannot explain a 
summum genus further than to make it appear that it is a
-P-A-G-E-44
  32 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
summum genus, which places it outside the sphere of explana- 
tion. One can describe the conditions of its manifestations; 
one can answer the question, “how is the genius?” but not, 
“why is the genius?” 
At least four signs appear: (a) The tremendous interest of, 
the prodigies in their work; (b) their unusual insight into the’ 
properties and relations of numbers, which leads to (c) their 
amazing performances; (d) their precocity. 
(a) Their work is the result of interest, but the interest 
is the result of genius. They proceed with calculation be- 
cause, as the saying is, they have a genius for it. True, in 
a sense, the interest is a result of the work because of the 
joy the endowed man takes in his work, illuminated as his 
pathway is by facets of light unperceived by the general; 
the two are reciprocal in their causative action, but inter- 
est is primary as between the two, and genius is elemental 
to both. 
(b) Their insight into properties and relations comes as 
flashes, whereas, in the case of the ordinary man it come 
but slowly or not at all. Ina sense, too, it is acquired; all 
genius needs appropriate stimuli for its development and 
with practice its field of operations becomes enlarged. But 
stimuli and practice might be present to you and to me 
with improving but certainly not astounding results. It 
is not meant that the knowledge of these properties is the 
result of mathematical insight. So far as it may be, it 
lacks the naiveté and spontaneity that characterize the 
devices of our born prodigies. Nor is it meant that the 
properties and relations are necessarily such as would be 
recognized as valuable by the mathematician. Yet the 
prodigies on occasion made discoveries of facts therete- 
fore undiscovered or believed to be impossible by the 
mathematicians, and it may be that some of their de-
-P-A-G-E-45
  
Genetic Studies 33 
vices await, through proper study and formulation, assimi- 
lation into the theory of number. 
(c) Their amazing performances are explained only in 
part by their genius for numerical properties and relations; 
memory, as we have seen, plays a large part. Not such a 
memory as you and I have, but a hypertrophied memory, 
a memory sublimated to such an extent as to amount to a 
supernormal activity in itself and therefore another phase 
of the genius of the operator. It must be remembered, 
however, that no faculty of figure memory, however 
prodigious, could, as such, produce a calculator. It is of 
importance in this connection only as it stands in the serv- 
ice of calculation genius, as such. Besides memory, we 
must add (to explain rapidity, when the calculation is a 
genuine one) subconscious functioning. All of the steps do 
not appear in the focus of consciousness; some are slurred 
over; as in the case of Mitchell when computing the 8th 
power of 3. Results often come before the full conscious- 
ness of the numbers involved. Introspection of our ordi- 
nary process in the addition of a column of figures will 
serve to enable us to understand this in a measure. If we 
are at all expert, we simply glance up (or down) the column 
and name the several sums (or motorize them), scarcely 
being conscious of the figures added. While this power of 
subconscious functioning doubtless may be improved by 
practice in the ordinary individual, it is developed far 
beyond the ordinary in the arithmetical prodigy. 
(d) Their precocity is a sign of genius. Precocity is 
not always a sign of genius, although genius is often accom- 
panied by precocity. But if we can determine on other 
grounds that the prodigies are geniuses, their precocity can 
be taken as confirmatory evidence. 
With scarcely an exception, the prodigies were preco-    
-P-A-G-E-46
34 
  Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
cious, and the universality of this trait in them, and the 
constancy of its eventuation in actual achievement in their 
cases, make us ready to accept their performances as in- 
stances of what Carpenter (Mental Physiology, page 231) 
in discussing prodigies describes as “numerical intuition or 
congenital aptitude for recognizing the relations of num- 
bers.” 
Mitchell says, “Precocity in calculation is natural and 
normal; popular amazement over it is groundless; there is 
no need even to regard it as remarkable. Owing to the 
origin of mental calculation in ordinary counting and the 
complete independence and self-sufficiency of mental 
arithmetic, mere mathematical precocity falls into a differ- 
ent class from musical precocity” (12, p. 130). To this 
we say that isolation of mental arithmetic and the untram- 
meled conditions under which it may go on may account 
for its free development, but cannot account for its initia- 
tion. It may be admitted, too, that the precocity is 
natural if by that is meant that it is not supernatural. But 
that it is normal we cannot agree. Children do not do 
normally what the prodigies did as children; so that it is no 
wonder that the neighbors should be amazed at them. He 
says further, “Given a knowledge of how to count and later 
a few definitions, any child of average ability can go on 
once his interest is aroused (italics mine) and construct 
unaided practically the whole science of arithmetic.” 
This we grant, “once his interest is aroused.” But we 
do not believe it possible to arouse his interest (in the 
degree here intimated) unless he has a “congenital apti- 
tude” far above the average. That prodigies do have an 
aptitude which the average child has not is shown by 
their very precocity. The precocity is the cause of his 
interest, not the effect of it.
-P-A-G-E-47

2. It seems clear that the prodigy is of more than ordina- 
tily sharply defined mental type. An interesting comparison! 
between P. Diamandi and J. Inaudi bearing on this point is 
given by Dr. Ioteyko in her article (14) previously referred to, 
based upon certain observations and studies by Professor 
Manouvrier, Binet, and others. Diamandi is found to be of a 
pure visual-motor type, Inaudi of pure auditive-motor. Their 
aptitudes are so one-sided that the two calculators are, as it 
were, the living embodiments of two types of memorization. 
To arrive at his results Inaudi must receive the problems to be 
solved in an auditive way. The assistants speak the figures. 
It is estimated that 300 is the number of figures which he 
engraves on his memory in this way at a single séance. The 
sight of the figures is of no service. 
The opposite is the fact in the case of Diamandi. 
When problems are given to him through audition he 
appears embarrassed, hesitates, commits errors and asks that 
the figures be repeated to him many times. But when the 
figures are presented to him in writing, he memorizes large 
numbers rapidly and accurately. In his case figure memory 
is but a phase of a general power; all the visual sphere appears 
well developed; colors, letters and written words are easily 
remembered though his retentivity of these is weaker than of 
figures. The auditive memory of Inaudi, on the other hand, 
except with reference to figures, is much inferior to the normal. 
Mitchell’s memory type is auditive-motor. He learned to 
count orally and his calculations began at once without further 
aid. He cannot remember ever counting on his fingers or using 
pebbles or the like, and even when he learned to make written 
figures later on they never became associated with his mental 
calculations which remained strictly auditory (or auditive- 
motor) throughout. Ordinarily the motor element is almost 
1 Les Calculateurs prodigies, in La Revue Psychologique, IIT, P. 320,  
-P-A-G-E-48
36 
  Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
entirely absent; when the calculations remain in familiar fields 
they are accompanied by no perceptible innervation of the 
muscles of speech. When he attempts unpracticed feats, 
however, the tendency to motorization is marked. Much the 
same thing was true of Safford. Compare this with Browne’s 
subjects, who in unpracticed stages and in times of confu- 
sion or uncertainty tended to reinstate the verbalism of the 
tables (p. 73). It would seem, at first sight, that the motor- 
minded person is at a distinct advantage because when his 
imagination or thought is at a low ebb he can “crank up” by 
means of his motor apparatus; however, this supposed advan- 
tage disappears when it is remembered that visualization 
itself, when sharply analyzed, is found to be largely made up 
of motor elements. 
Mitchell’s type is not so sharply defined as that of Dia- 
mandi, Inaudi and others, but Mitchell is not a great calcu- 
lator. His case approaches more nearly to that of the ordinary 
person, in that while one type of imagery (the auditory in his 
case) slightly predominates, and, so far as calculation is con- 
cerned, is the prevailing type, he also makes use, with no 
special difficulty, of visual images in geometry and similar 
fields, and is, generally speaking, of the mixed type. 
Mitchell has made a careful study of the psychological 
types of the prodigies, gathering up all the available evidence, 
and finds that “many of the calculators heretofore supposed 
to be of the visual type turn out on closer examination to be- 
long to the auditory or auditory-motor type, at least in calcu- 
lation” (x2, p. 132). Only two of the major prodigies (P. Dia- 
mandi and Bidder, Jr.) are certainly of the visual type, and 
both of these, as we have seen, belong to the class of “artifi- 
cial” calculators. It is to be expected that the natural calcu- 
lators should be-of the auditory type. We have seen that our 
calculators usually begin as soon as they learn to count, in
-P-A-G-E-49
Genetic Studies 37 
most cases before they can read and write. “Since counting 
is essentially a verbal process, the calculator, who begins from 
counting before he learns to read and write, will usually belong 
to the auditory type, and will make relatively little use of vis- 
ual images in his actual calculations” (12, p. 132). 
3. It would seem to go without saying that a more than 
usual power of attention is demanded by the feats of the cal- 
culators. ‘The attitude taken by calculators,” ‘says Dr. 
Toteyko, “during mental work displays all the characteristics 
and signs of attention; eyes half closed, head bent, the figure 
expressing withdrawal and detachment from everything in the 
exterior world. Distractions coming from outside incommode 
them but little” (14, p. 325). The ability of some of them to 
carry on a running conversation or to go about other work or 
to carry on two calculations at once presents an anomaly 
of attention which must be explained by the fact that much of 
the work has been seduced to an unusual degree of automa- 
tism, unconscious cerebration or subconscious functioning, call 
it by what name we may. Unusual concentration, however, 
would still be needed to maintain a grip on the whole situation. 
Chronometric records of reaction-times show in both Inaudi 
and Diamandi great rapidity (half the ordinary in the case of 
Inaudi). While these records may be taken as a measure of 
attention (the mind wanderer reacts slowly), and are so cited 
by Dr. Ioteyko, they may be also regarded as measures of the 
sensitivity and impressibility of the nervous oe and, 
therefore, of retentivity. 
4. The memory factor has already been referred to under 
the discussion of the genius of prodigies; also its relation to the 
calculation psychosis. It is mentioned again in order to note 
that so far as it is a matter of retentivity it is explicable by 
the experimentally determined impressibility just referred to. 
Again, the wonder of the feats of memory somewhat dimin-  
-P-A-G-E-50
  
Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
ishes when it is known in some cases, and surmised in others, 
that what appears to be memory differs scarcely at all from 
perception since it is the reproduction of a still persistent image. 
Also, it is necessary to distinguish between genuine memory 
feats and quick, automatic calculations of which the results, 
simulate memory. Bidder, Sr., it will be remembered, was for 
a time under the illusion that he possessed a multiplication 
table up to 100 x 100. A calculator might, for example, be 
able with practice to multiply 48 x 64 so readily and rapidly by 
more or less automatic processes that he would get the answer 
(3072) as quickly as if he had relied on a direct act of memory; 
and if the process of calculation happened to be mainly or 
wholly automatic, he might even be ignorant of its existence 
and suppose he had actually found the result by direct and 
unaided memory; disillusion would come, however, when 
under stress of fatigue or lack of practice his calculations 
become more conscious and brief flashes of the intermediate 
processes pass through his mind. The true nature of the psy- 
chosis is then revealed not as memory but as calculation, for 
direct memory would not discover such intermediate links. 
5. Does the psychology of the prodigy present any patho- 
logical aspects? There is room for suspicion that the superi- 
ority displayed in certain processes is due to a disequilibration 
among the faculties, one center predominating to the detri- 
ment of others. This suspicion becomes certainty in two of 
the cases which we have reviewed (Buxton, Dase). The evi- 
dence is the lack of other interests, and even of ordinary gen- 
eral intelligence. Buxton’s case was the more marked of the 
two in this respect, and it is hardly too much to say that he 
was a victim of arrested development, in other words, a mental 
defective. He also showed the symptoms of arithmomania, 
since in listening to a sermon his whole occupation was to 
count the number of words, etc. One should not be surprised
-P-A-G-E-51
Genetic Studies 39 
that the mental defective is capable of becoming a calculator 
of degree. He may be incapable of developing the number 
concept, abstract notion of number, but it would seem that 
computation can go on very well without such concept. Dr. 
H. H. Goddard! gives an account of an experiment conducted 
in the Vineland School, which tends to confirm this view. 
“Twelve of our most trainable boys were taken at the most 
trainable age and drilled on number. They were trained until 
they could cover a blackboard with figures and, drawing a line 
underneath, add up the total mass. Day after day and week 
after week they did this and gloried in their accomplishment. 
I need not tell you that they did not understand what they 
were doing.” Some time later after this drill was stopped they 
could not tell the sum of 3 and 2. He also cites in the same 
article a number of cases of children who could perform the 
fundamental operations very well, but who could grasp and 
reproduce simple dictation involving number notions with 
only slight success. But whatever may be true of the mental 
hygiene of Buxton and Dase, there is no evidence of lack of 
equilibrium or development in the other cases. These with 
the possible exception of Fuller all show average or superior 
intelligence, though in only two or three cases is the mathe- 
matical ability great. But we have already seen in our bio- 
graphical review that mathematical and calculating ability 
are not correlated. Goddard’s experiment throws some light 
on the reason why. Number, in the mathematical sense, is 
the abstract notion of the relation between concrete magni- 
tudes. (See our discussion of McLellan and Dewey’s Psychol- 
ogy of Number, p. gr ff.) The rise of the number concept 
is the child’s initiation into mathematics. But, by dint of 
practice, calculation can go on moderately in children and

Light on the Development of the Number Concept.

prodigiously in persons specially gifted without blossoming 
into the apprehension of true number relations. Such appre- 
hension is not needed, but rather of properties and relations of 
figures, as such. Nor is whatever of mathematical theory may 
underlie such properties necessary. ( 
Pedagogical Applications. We can enumerate some of the 
possible pedagogical applications only briefly. 
1. The importance of having recourse in teaching children 
to the processes of memory peculiar to the individual may be 
inferred from the cases of Inaudi and Diamandi. The superi- 
ority of Diamandi would pass unperceived if one should pro- 
pose to him problems in the auditive way; the opposite would 
be true for Inaudi. 
2. Calculation per se is of importance. It can be culti- 
vated. It would probably pay, therefore, to study the meth- 
ods of prodigies to discover feasible short cuts now not much 
noted. An example is possibly the method of two-figure end- 
ings. Mitchell says, “They (two-figure endings) are, from a 
mathematical standpoint, trivial and of limited interest. To 
answer questions in evolution and factoring, the mathemati- 
cian would turn to his tables of factors and roots or to a loga- 
rithm table; he would regard the properties of the mathe- 
matical prodigy’s two-figure endings as unimportant special 
cases of more general propositions in the theory of numbers. 
They are, then, of merely curious interest in mental calcula- 
tion. It is conceivable, of course, that if a new and compre- 
hensive theory of their properties were worked out, it might 
find a subordinate place in the theory of numbers” (12, p. 113). 
Tt may be added that it might find a subordinate but some- 
what valuable place, also, as a basis for arithmetical practice.

3. Out of calculation may blossom the concept and the 
mathematical sense generally. (See our discussion of McLel- 
lan and Dewey’s Psychology of Number, p. 91 fi.) 
Whether this will happen will depend, in part, upon the aims 
of the teacher and her skill in securing them. (Of course, it 
may happen in spite of her.) - It is certain that nothing of the 
concept will emerge, no matter what the practice and effort, 
until the time is ripe. As a child will not walk until his neuro- 
muscular apparatus for walking has reached a certain stage 
of growth and adjustment and the instinct for walking arises, 
so he will not resolve abstract number notions from concrete 
things until a proper degree of maturity arrives. 
4. A lesson that the modern pedagogue hardly needs to be 
taught may be gathered from the fact that Fuller, Ampere, 
Bidder, Mondeux, Buxton, Gauss, Whately, Colburn, and 
Safford learned numbers and their values before figures. Says 
Bidder (quoted by Scripture’), “The reason for my obtaining 
the peculiar power of dealing with numbers may be attributed 
to the fact that I understood the value of numbers before I 
knew the symbolical figures. In consequence numbers have 
always had a significance and a meaning to me very different 
to that which figures convey to children in general.” 
(d) Number Forms. 
The treatment of the genesis of the number sense would not 
approach completeness without some consideration of the curious 
phenomenon which often accompanies its beginnings, viz., the 
occurrence in the consciousness of many children and the per- 
sistence in that of some adults of a kind of imagery that seems to 
help out the early strivings of the more or less abstract number 
series for some sort of symbolic expression. This imagery takes

the character of so-called number forms, and while the evidence of 
the existence of these forms is taken largely from the testimony of 
more or less mature persons, yet these usually agree that they 
originated early in life, many saying that they have always pos- 
sessed them and expressing surprise at finding that everybody 
does not possess them. I present below drawings of three of the 
simpler forms, after Phillips (7).

  NumBer Forms (after Phillips) 
Several pages of these drawings are to be found in Galton’s dis- 
cussion (11) and in Phillips’s article (7). They are arranged in 
zigzags or long curves or lines going in different directions, the 
more important numbers (to the possessor) being situated at
-P-A-G-E-55

the turns. Some of them are very complicated, requiring tridi- 
mensional space to represent them. The numbers may appear 
either written or printed, and the general mental movement in 
connection with their appearance is that whenever a number is 
thought of it appears in the same place on a visual diagram 
which is invariably called up, viewed by the mental eye and often 
definitely located. These diagrams are often very much larger 
than the drawings. Galton says that the most common way is to 
see only two or three figures of the diagram at once, but Phillips 
says that this depends upon whether the mind is performing 
mental calculations or the form is viewed as a whole. 
What proportion of people possess these forms depends upon 
what extension is given to the term “number.” For it is not 
only in the field of number strictly speaking that diagrams occur. 
Persons who have no number form have schemes for the days of 
the week, days of the month, months of the year, letters of the 
alphabet, etc. In some investigations these, probably altogether 
different in their origin and explanation, have not been sharply 
separated from true number forms. Galton found 1 in 30 males 
or 15 females. Patrick (10) found 1 in 6 adults, a larger propor- 
tion among children, slightly more common among women than 
among men. Phillips found that 15% males, 17% females have 
some form; 7% males, 8% females have number forms. 
Galton (1883), Patrick (1893), Flournoy (1893), and later 
Calkins and Phillips have studied many number forms and pub- 
lished their results. As Phillips’s investigation is the latest and 
takes into account previous results and interpretations, I follow 
him here in the main. 
Phillips (7) formulated a number of questions which he sub- 
mitted to 332 normal school students, 974 school children, 7th, 
8th, and oth grades, and 343 miscellaneous adults. The children 
were asked to draw whatever form or forms they had. In 
fall the rooms, except five, an effort was made to keep them from 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  
  44 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
obtaining an imaginary form for the occasion. Each pupil giving 
a form was questioned privately; and in the five rooms oppor- 
tunity was given to fake a form by presenting drawings and giving 
explanations; but the forms collected in these rooms show no signs 
of fraud. 
The drawings were examined as to their general direction, first 
turns and endings, and the results tabulated including the draw- 
ings collected by Galton, Flournoy and Patrick.

The table shows that the large majority turn to the right; out 
of 263 forms 91 make their first turn at 10, 64 at 12; only 55 
extend beyond too. “There is at least a suggestion that both 
the first turning and the limits of these forms may be related to 
the manner of counting and indicate that their formation begins 
with the earliest counting” (7, p. 516). 
Of 280 answering the question as to the age at which their form 
first appeared 241 did not remember a time when it was not at 
call; r7-say at 6 years; rr say they learned to add or multiply on 
their scheme. Several things in the forms point to the fact that 
“number forms begin with the naming of numbers, and go on as 
the child learns to count to too. Most children can count 100 
before they can recognize anything written or printed. It is only 
natural that they should try to visualize the abstract and try to 
cast it into some concrete form or space relation” (7, p. 516). 
As to the origin of the particular form possessed by individuals 
few had any explanation to offer. Some of the simplest forms were 
ascribed to imaging the clock face or other objects more or less 
frequently before the eye. Such are only more or less modified

mental images and were located on blackboards, books, blocks, 
etc. This class does not exist among adults. 
Ts it useful or troublesome? 
Two hundred and eleven answered this question. Ninety-seven 
are sure of its utility, 1 finds it troublesome; 113 neither useful nor 
troublesome. Many, who said at first “Neither,” afterward 
corrected this statement by saying they found themselves con- 
tinually using it. At first they were unconscious of using it, using 
their form just as language is used as a medium without giving it 
a thought. 
Where is it located? 
Diamandi, an Italian mathematical prodigy of whom we have 
given an account, located his on the convolutions of the brain; 
but the rule is to locate it in space near the head, when located 
at all. Several did not answer this question and many were not 
conscious of any localization. 
The direction of turn lacks explanation. Right- or left-handed- 
ness is not found to have any influence. 
Are they inherited? 
Galton emphasized heredity as an explanation and Miss 
Calkins (9) is also much in favor of heredity, but this only 
pushes the question further back.. Flournoy says that only 
predisposition can be attributed to heredity. Phillips’s question- 
naire obtained 128 answers to this question. Six relatives had a 
number form; seventeen relatives had other diagrams. Phillips 
says, “I find no more signs of or reason to look for heredity here, 
than in any highly developed power of imagination, memory, art, 
music, etc., all of which are much questioned since Weisman’s 
theory of heredity” (7, p. 520). 
Number forms are not found most frequently, as might be 
supposed and as Galton thought, among the most imaginative; 
have no connection with love of mathematics, nor with general 
intelligence. Besides the number forms consisting of lines,  
-P-A-G-E-58
  
46 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
straight, curved, spiral, which the (comparatively few) owners 
say are as distinctly seen as if actually before their eyes, there are 
many cases in which lines are absent and the arrangement more 
or less vague, the numbers simply being located in a certain direc- 
tion or at a certain distance or being felt to be at differing distances 
away. Some say the numbers thought of recede, others that they 
go up, the large ones getting very high. “It seems,” says Phillips, 
“that nearly all persons possess some idea of extension of numbers, | 
more or less indefinite” (7, p. 525). 
Out of 480 pupils above the 7th grade 74% visualize all mental 
operations with numbers in some way and but few had thought 
it could be otherwise. In the ist, 2nd, and 3rd grades 785 children 
were asked to count and then to tell if the numbers take any 
direction.’ The most unexpected directions were asked for first. 
Thirty-four said they went down; 60 to the right; 29 to the left; 
74 right forward; 470 some upward movement. The same mate- 
rial is here as in the more definite number forms and many of these 
are probably as distinct as the complex forms. 
All the evidence seems to point to the fact that this manifesta- 
tion, whether of the sort just described or of the more complex 
type, takes its rise very early in life, is almost universal among 
children at a certain primeval stage in their development, drops 
out in many cases after it has served its initial function, but per- 
sists and develops in complexity in a few persons. It seems most 
probable that it begins with and runs parallel to the establish- 
ment of the series idea which, as we have seen, is the background 
of the number concept. If this be true, it would find in this fact a 
basis for explanation. It will be remembered that the series idea 
is developed before number is applied to objects or number names 
have been learned, Counting in this stage is a motor response to 
an inner rhythm. But in the absence of number names, which 
later serve to free the motor mechanism by giving it adequate and 
easily pursued avenues of discharge, the field of response is much
-P-A-G-E-59
  
Genetic Studies 47 
restricted. Now the number forms serve as the means of bursting 
the bounds of these restrictions, and as a kind of concrete symbol- 
ism analogous to the sticks, pebbles, etc. of the prenaming period. 
The motor impulses find their outlet and their relief in a geome- 
trizing psychosis (doubtless instinctive), which leads to localiza- 
tion in space or imaginary movement along imagined lines, which 
movement, of course, must have a spatial background. We can 
better understand perhaps how limited the prenaming period is 
in available responses and how favorable a time it is for the birth 
of a more or less fantastic symbolism, if we remember that even 
number names do not long suffice the child; he soon delights in 
making numberless columns of figures. Prodigies make long cal- 
culations before, in some cases, they can make or read written 
symbols. It is not surprising to learn that some of them used 
number forms; these prodigies were in the same stage with refer- 
ence to available modes of motor response as children before they 
can make figures. 
But number forms, having originated, persist and are sometimes 
developed after number names and written symbols are freely 
lused. Any collection of number forms shows that most of them 
lare shaped more or less by the relations of numbers to each other. 
ere they serve the purpose, working through the geometrizing 
instinct, of preserving in a visual field, numbers in helpful rela- 
ions to one another; also to continue a series, and to lay it off 
o that it can be grasped as a whole. 
Dr. Hall suggests that it might pay to cultivate in children 
‘ood number forms as aids to memory and reproduction, and 
hus to the elementary operations. Elements from quite a num- 
er of the recorded or yet to be discovered ones, might be selected 
or use at the very beginning in the primary text-books. Adelia 
. Hornbrook (8) claims an advantage in giving to all children 
uniform number form by having it constantly hung before them.

with their aid. For the number forms used by her see her article 
Educational Review Vol. 5, No. 5, pp. 467-480. 
We have attempted above to state clearly the most favorable 
genetic explanation of number forms. Explanations have been 
attempted from other points of view, all of which Flournoy saysare 
analyzable into two great classes: (a) psychological, (b) physio- 
logical, harmonizable by the principle of psychophysical parallel- 
ism. These are only of mild interest to the pedagogue and will _ 
be omitted.

2. PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES. 
(a) Perception. 
We now pass from the consideration of number beginnings in 
the race and in the individual to a psychological inquiry into its 
manifestations in the relatively mature person. It is not sufficient 
to know how the number sense and the number concept begin; we 
must also know to a degree, also, their eventuation. For the 
child will become a man; without knowing the man we cannot 
know the child. The child may be sai generis and have ‘his own 
psychology, but he is also the future man; whatever the man is he 
began as a child; he does not entirely put away “childish things.” 
Psychological studies of the number consciousness of older 
children and adujts are bound to throw light on the general 
psychology of the subject whenever the results obtained are 
sufficiently in common with one another to give at least hypothe- 
ses of likely verifiable validity, or in common with results of the 
study of younger children whose minds are still largely naive in 
their functioning and not overlaid with habit. The tremendous 
advantage of work with adults as subjects is their power of intro- 
spection, which enables them to give a subjective analysis of proc- 
esses which must remain almost wholly objective with children. 
So that results, if any, obtained from adults in common with 
those from children will thus get a psychological account other- 
wise impossible.!_ Whatever results may be obtained for general 
psychology, it must be remembered that, after all, large indi- 
1 Wundt writes: ‘In the investigation of children and savages only objective 
symptoms are in general available; any psychological interpretation of these 
symptoms is possible only on the basis of mature adult introspection which has 
been carried out under experimental conditions.’’ Outlines of Psychology p. 330.

vidual differences will obtain and in any pedagogical procedure 
such differences must be taken into account. 
It must be admitted that such a program as that intimated 
above has not, as yet, been adequately carried out. Still a num- 
ber of important contributions have been made. 
Messenger (19) presents some important results of an experi- 
mental study of the perception of objects in groups (1) when the 
’ presentations were tactile, (2) when they were visual. 
The experiments on touch were performed with two brass rods 
four inches long sharpened at one end and rounded on the other, 
to make, when desired, the contacts qualitatively different. The 
subject sat with the palm of the right hand on the back of the left 
and his fingers interlaced. The backs of the fingers were stimu- 
lated on the second phalanges with the sharp end of one rod and 
the blunt end of the other and the subject asked to tell whether 
the sharp end was to the right or the left. Thirty stimulations 
were given in a series with only a few moments rest between stim- 
ulations. 
It was found that the perception of the number of contacts is a 
matter of distance and direction, or in other words of localization 
in space; but further it is also a matter of association. So far as 
immediate excitation is concerned, space and difference in direction 
are the determining factors. Inverse variation of the two is neces- 
sary for the perception of two points as separate. But number 
is not given immediately. A subject may distinguish a qualita- 
tive difference between two points of the zsthesiometer and one 
point, even though he does not distinguish a difference in the 
number of points. The perception of number only arises with the 
association of the number with certain perceived qualitative 
differences. 
In the experiments on the perception of visual objects, white 
cards containing black dots and lines were exposed for .or second 
by means of a drop screen electrically controlled. First three
-P-A-G-E-63
  
Psychological Studies 51 
cards were exposed in succession, each three times, and the judg- 
ments totaled. Subjects were allowed to make a drawing before 
stating the number, if they chose. 
Fig. A Fig. B Fig. C 
For A the average % of error (six subjects) was 49, for B 16, for 
C 46. B and C were equally visible (black), but B is more easily 
judged than C, hence the perception does not depend upon visi- 
bility. B is also more easily judged than A, although more 
complex, while C and A are equally easy, although C is more 
complex, so that as far as this experiment is concerned, perception 
does not depend on complexity. There can be no difference be- 
tween B and C on the basis of difference in the direction of lines, 
for the directions are the same. The inference is that the form 
of the figure as a whole is the important factor. 
To test this matter further cards containing lines arranged 
as shown in figure D and E were used, five cards for each figure 
in a series, each card shown three times. 
NA Ne 
iN Tals Fig. D Fig. E 
In each series the distances of the lines from the center varied 
from 2 cm. to ro cm., but this variation was found to have 
no effect on perception. For D the average error (nine subjects) 
was 30, for E 17; only one subject overestimates E; five over- 
estimate D and four underestimate. The author says that those 
who overestimated D gave their attention to what they saw and  
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
inferred the rest, while those who underestimated attended to the 
missing part and neglected the rest. Presumably he bases this 
statement on introspection reports, though he does not say so. 
The reason for the greater accuracy and uniformity in E is, the 
author infers, that the lines in E make a complete figure, thus 
confirming the initial experiments. Three subjects saw no appre- 
ciable difference between the two series. (This is an illustration of 
the importance mentioned above for noting exceptional cases.) 
The unusualness and apparent irregularity of D are doubtless also 
factors. The author made an incidental test showing that there 
is a tendency not to make so many errors with a regular arrange- 
ment, but the errors are greater when made. 
In testing the influence of size and distribution, a further 
series of experiments was made, using nine cards of the general 
character of Fig. F. 
e e e e 
a Aten eel 
e e e e 
e e 
Fig. F 
The spots were of three sizes, small, medium, large. (Fig. F 
represents the small size.) Each size was given on separate 
cards three different distributions: close together, medium distri- 
bution, scattered. Regularity was avoided except in the matter 
of distribution between spots. Each of the nine cards was shown 
three times, by the drop screen method as before, in the order of 
the size of the dots from small to large in each distribution, from 
close to scattered. The results for distribution, size unchanged, 
(eight subjects) were as follows (correct score for each distribu- 
tion, a total of 135 dots): 
(a) Close 112 (b) Medium 133 (c) Scattered 137
-P-A-G-E-65
  
Psychological Studies 53 
For all observers there is a higher score as the distribution- 
distance increases, except in two cases in which the medium dis- 
tance is judged higher than (a) or (c). The average steadily in- 
creases. 
The interpretation of these results is doubtless, as the author 
says, to be made on the basis of the spatial conditions. The dots 
when more scattered fill more space as a whole and are therefore 
judged to be more, in the absence of other data. Though the 
spaces between the dots are larger, attention is directed mainly to 
the dots so that allowances that may be made for the spaces are 
not apt to be sufficient. 
The results for size, distribution unchanged (eight subjects), 
is shown below. The first three cards were shown six times, 
making the score for each size a total of 180 dots. 
(a) Small 154 (b) Medium 160 (c) Large 184 
It will be seen that the tendency to increase the estimate is not so 
great in the case of size. The results show that larger objects 
in a given space give the idea of a greater number, but this is 
counterbalanced by the knowledge, gained from experience, that 
into a given space can be put a greater number of small objects 
than of large ones. 
In both cases, it will be noted that the estimated number is an 
inference from the characteristics (differing sizes) or conditions 
(differing distances apart or space occupied as a whole), the re- 
resulting judgment being modified by what in the impression is 
attended to. Space conditions being the same, other data are 
sought by the percipient upon which to base his judgment. A further experiment to show this was tried with cards containing 
seat oe ee Alea 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
54 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
marks arranged as in Fig. G and Fig. H, each group occupying as 
a whole the same space. 
In general the number of lines in G was regarded as about twice 
the number that are in H. The subjects gave as their procedure 
that they estimated the number of crosses in G and doubled it; 
this was not possible in H. The arrangement in H is so unfamiliar 
that the estimate in .o1 second must have been almost a pure 
guess. In this experiment number is inferred from prominent 
characteristics. 
It may be concluded, then, that the apprehension of the number 
in a simultaneous group is not an intuitive factor in the percep- 
tion, like sensation, but a judgment factor as in all of our common 
everyday perceptions. If this be true, we should expect that 
it would be subject to errors and illusions. And this proves to be 
the fact, as we have seen. Not only does the occupancy of an ac- 
tually greater space by a group give the illusion of greater number 
when the number is really the same, but the illusion of a greater 
space causes a corresponding illusion of a greater number. Fig. 
I and Fig. J containing lines of the same size, covering the same 
Fig. I Fig. J 
distance, were each shown to the subjects, first in the horizontal 
position and then in the vertical. The vertical positions always 
yielded the higher estimates, corresponding to the well-known 
tendency to overestimate distance in the vertical direction. 
The perception of number is a judgment mediated in part by 
spatial data, in part by other qualitative characteristics. This 
judgment is made possible by repeated prior experiences of asso- 
ciation of certain qualitative differences in the unit impression 
with certain numbers of parts derived by actual count. (Many 
subjects made a drawing of their unit impressions and then 
counted the parts, a procedure reminiscent of earlier experience.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
Psychological Studies 55 
When the association has become established, the experiences 
that have led up to the fixation of association have dropped out of 
consciousness and the apprehension seems to be immediate. 
Now when a group is presented the impression is at once associ- 
ated with the number assigned to it before. “Four, for example, 
is a name for a certain object of sensation, and for sensation it is a 
unit, but a unit of such a character that it can be separated into 
parts and each part in turn become an object of sensation. It is a 
unit of the sort that has heretofore been separated into four parts 
and has habitually been recognized as four” (19, p. 42). On this 
account any lack of familiarity with the grouping, whether regu- 
lar (see Figs. C, D) or irregular (see Fig. F), or, generally 
speaking, with the qualitative aspect of the unit-impression, leads 
to more or less uncertainty. 
The most important conclusion is that the numerical apprehen- 
sion of a group takes its rise in the application of the number 
series to the group. Counting is fundamental. Phillips is right 
when he intimates that there is no such thing as an eye span 
(except for very small groups). The apprehension of larger 
groups is the result of very rapid counting or the association of 
number with form. (Phillips instances the case of a teacher who 
was very much surprised at the inability of her class to tell the 
number in a group when one day she changed the forms of the 
groups on the blackboard.) Any arrangement of dots or lines for 
presentation to the child that will facilitate such rapid counting 
and association and give drill in them would seem to be a valu- 
able contribution to the didactics of arithmetic. The experi- 
mental determination of such an arrangement best from the point 
of view of economical learning has recently engaged the attention 
of a number of school men, particularly in Germany, to whom 
reference will be made later (pp. 59 ff. and 149 ff.). 
A study of the factors that influence the estimation of number 
made by C. J. Burnett (18) confirms the results of Messenger
-P-A-G-E-68
  
56 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
in several particulars, and adds a consideration of some factors 
not studied by him. Burnett found that (z) area is to a large 
extent a determinant of the judgment of relative number, but that 
different subjects (and the same subject at different times) show 
tendencies to give opposite judgments. It should be noted that 
the exposures in Burnett’s experiments for the estimate of relative 
number were simultaneous (two group apparatus) (see appendix 
for the brief statement of the details of Burnett’s procedure) ; 
while Messenger’s exposures were successive. In the latter’s 
experiments greater area almost invariably gave greater number. 
The important result gained from both, however, is that other 
factors besides pure numerical judgment enter into the estimate 
and that one of these is area. (2) As between a homogeneous 
group and a group irregularly gathered into nuclei, the majority 
of subjects estimated the homogeneous group as larger than the 
nucleated group, although some shifting of tendencies was noted. 
In Messenger’s experiments on the influence of internal arrange- 
ment the groups compared (see pp. 53, 54, Figs. G, H and Figs. I, J) 
were homogeneous, but differed in the case of Figs. G, Hinsugges- 
tiveness of estimation-aids, and in the case of Figs. I, J in their 
relation to a certain frequently occurring illusion of perception. 
An internal arrangement that gives a clue to a calculation-help 
(may not this explain, in part at least, the tendency to favor a 
homogeneous group?), or one that calls for judgment of a group 
arranged vertically was estimated as larger. Burnett and Messen- 
ger here supplement one another. (3) The influence of complexity 
in group composition was studied by comparing a group consisting 
wholly of gray and one consisting of three colors, red, yellow- 
orange, and blue-green. The subjects favored the noncomplex 
group. Two further experiments on complexity were tried (with 
successive instead of simultaneous exposures). A group of circles 
(plain) were compared with a group with small red circles in the 
center. The group with the complex members was estimated
-P-A-G-E-69
  Psychological Studies a7 
greater. Again, two sizes of balls were used in one group and one 
size in another. The complex group was estimated smaller. 
Complexity is evidently a factor, but the kind of complexity deter- 
mines the relative judgment with opposite tendencies often pres- 
ent. Messenger found on very meager data (see page 51) that 
complexity is not a factor. It seems safe to say that complexity is 
sometimes a factor, sometimes not, depending on the kind of com- 
plexity. (Messenger’s complexity was an added number of lines.) 
(4) In the matter of size, group areas being the same, opposite 
tendencies were found as in the case of area, a small majority fa- 
voring the larger size. Messenger found the larger size almost 
invariably favored, but his difference of procedure must be re- 
membered. The introspective evidence given by Burnett’s sub- 
jects differs, also, from Messenger’s, the former being inclined to 
explain their judgments as a function of group vacancies and as a 
result of a distribution error, grounded in a fundamental tendency 
to base the judgment of relative number upon the character of 
the vacancies in a group. The principle of fluctuating attention 
will explain the influence now of objects, now of vacancies, and, 
of course, will vary in its working in individuals and in groups of 
individuals, the subjective character of vividness attaching now 
to one, now to the other factor, determining which shall be opera- 
tive. 
Burnett’s experiments on the judgment of absolute number 
are more comparable with those of Messenger and the results 
are more in accordance with his. He found, for instance, using 
successive exposures (one group apparatus), (1) that scattering 
objects raises the apparent number, (2) that smaller size tends 
to reduce the apparent number. (It should be mentioned that 
Messenger’s time of exposure (.o1 second) is less than that of Bur- 
nett; but on the other hand Burnett found that apparent number 
(absolute judgment) is inversely proportional to the length of 
exposure.) He found also in absolute judgments (1) wide varia-
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
tion from objective correctness, (2) wider discrepancy with larger 
numbers than with small ones, (3) a general tendency to judge 
in multiples of five, (4) a general tendency to underestimate. 
Other factors studied by Burnett (not by Messenger) were: 
(a) Color: Red increases relative number, on the whole, as against 
gray; brightness and vividness may account for this. (b) Form 
of figures in the group: Circles against squares set irregularly were 
judged by some as larger in number, by others as smaller. The 
introspective notes were not illuminating. “Form may influence 
the judgment merely through its space-characteristics, but possi- 
bly also through the vividness of intrinsic interest” (18, p. 380). 
(c) Brightness as between gray and white: All observers favor 
darker group. (d) Complexity of environment: Drift of tendency 
is toward the group with the more complex environment. 
The estimation of relative number in the visual field is modified, 
then, by group, area, internal distribution, order and com- 
plexity in group composition; by the size, form, color, bright- 
ness and complexity of individual members; and by the character 
of the environment. Experiments were also made showing that 
the factors contributed by the objects through other senses than 
sight at the time they were being estimated, as the weight of the 
objects and conditions of eye-muscle strain, modify the judg- 
ments, but that irrelevant stimulations during the time of obser- 
vation as touches, noises (factors outside the objects) have little 
or no effect. 
In the judgment of absolute number, as we have seen, there is 
a tendency to underestimate; scattering the objects increases, 
compacting diminishes the apparent number; the smaller the size 
of objects the fewer do they appear; heterogeneity in group com- 
position usually lessens the number. 
On the whole the most influential factors were those lying in the 
space characters of the groups. In his interpretation of his results 
Burnett agrees substantially with Messenger that the principle of
-P-A-G-E-71
  Psychological Studies 59 
association adequately accounts in many cases for the more or less 
accurate estimate of number, as influenced by qualitative differ- 
ences in the groups to be numbered. Says he, “Our practical 
experience in the simultaneous variability of number and certain 
other characteristics of a group of objects has been such as to 
lead us into illusions when the two no longer vary together. In 
such a case, when we have no time to count, we are actually led 
to see a group as smaller or larger in accordance with the vari- 
ations perceived in the associated factor” (18, p. 386). 
The pedagogical bearing of such investigations lies chiefly in 
their contributions toward the solution of the question: Is there 
an original grasp of the number of impressions simultaneously 
(or successively) presented, or is it attained gradually through 
counting and association of the number thus ascertained with the 
presented group until counting is no longer necessary? The 
conclusion was that there is no such original (innate) power of 
apprehension. Immediately arise then other questions: How is 
this apparently immediate apprehension of number to be devel- 
oped? Within what bounds is it possible with adults and espe- 
cially with children? In what measure is it conditioned by prac- 
tice and completed through practice? What special outer and 
inner conditions facilitate or hinder it? 
To make clearer at this point the practical bearing of this on 
the didactics of arithmetic we may anticipate our later discussion 
(p. 149 ff.) to the extent of saying that it has been found by gen- 
eral experience and exacter experiment that children are more 
positive in their fundamental operations if their ability to grasp 
groups of counters visually presented has been developed as 
sharply and completely as possible. 
I take from Meumann’s discussion (57) a review of the experi- 
ments made in this country and abroad relative especially to the 
scope of immediate number apprehension. 
Cattell (23), in Wundt’s laboratory, presented simultaneously  
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
for estimate withan exposure of .or seconda number of short verti- 
cal lines. Four to five lines were found to be rightly estimated. 
Dietze (itber den Bewusstseinsumfang, daselbst, 2. 1885), in 
the same laboratory, made a research with metronome strokes in — 
order to determine how many strokes can be estimated without 
counting (successive presentation). It was shown that the 
number of rightly comprehended impressions depends on the quick- 
ness of the strokes. He found .2 to .3 second to be a favorable 
rate. Furthermore the estimate depended on the rhythmical 
grouping of the strokes. The most favorable arrangement was 
8 x 5 strokes by means of which forty strokes was rightly judged, 
the highest number attained. It appears, however, that the 
judgments in Dietze’s experiments were relative judgments, as 
his procedure was to have the subjects compare two sound series 
of different lengths separated by a short pause. It is the judg- 
ment of absolute number that is of importance here, and as Meu- 
mann says; whether we are grasping the number of impressions 
will not be determined by the comparison of two series of sound 
impressions following one another. A further criticism by Meu- 
mann is that with Dietze’s method it is possible for retention 
(cither immediate or as memory) to enter as a factor. 
Warren (Princeton Contributions to Psychology 2, 1898, vol. 3) 
used the reaction method. He showed to the observers black 
circles, arranged in a circle, exposed for .131 second; they reacted 
by opening the mouth when they had perceived the group (1 to8 
circles). He found that adults rightly estimated three simulta- 
neous sight stimuli and five successive, without counting. The 
criticism of this is that both numbers are too low; also the time 
of exposure is much longer than is necessary to finish successive 
apprehension. [It must have been a sore trial to the subject and 
was certainly a great exhibition of self-restraint not to count in 
the second part of this experiment, when there was ample time 
for it. Indeed it would be difficult to devise a method of visually]
-P-A-G-E-73
Psychological Studies 61 
- presenting successively the members of a group in which the re- 
sults would not be more or less vitiated by counting]. 
Nanu (Zur Psychologie der Zahlaufassung, Wiirzburger Diss. 
1904) found that in all cases, with four grown-ups, up to eleven 
sound stimuli would be determined rightly without counting, and, 
in several cases, up to 49 strokes. All participants rhythmatize 
unconsciously the impressions whereby, as with Dietze, the num- * 
ber grasp was much strengthened. The observation of Dietze 
that with even numbers as starting point the determination be- 
comes more positive Nanu found not justifiable. Again, an 
experiment was made on the visual grasp of bright circles on a 
dark background in which the exposure was .033 second. The circles 
were arranged variously: (a) in a straight line running diagonally 
through the field of vision, (2) in the form of a cross, (3) in the 
form of a parallelogram, (4) in the form of a hexagon, (5) in a cir- 
cle. It was shown that arrangement in figures favors the number 
grasp as against the arrangement in lines. The highest number of 
impressions which in all cases of all observers was rightly judged 
was five, if presented only in rows; if presented in rows alternated 
with figures, this number amounts to six. By the arrangement in 
figures, cross and parallelogram were relatively favorable, circle 
and hexagon unfavorable. The highest number of impressions 
which by all observers were rightly estimated in all cases with 
the same figure was: for the parallelogram, fen; for the cross and 
the circle, eight; for the hexagon, eight (in 75% of right cases only). 
In these experiments two apprehension-types show themselves, a 
synthetical and an analytical; the former places together in the 
conception the group out of the elements, the latter has at first the 
impression of the whole and first turns its attention to the parts 
in two lines. The number of impressions was overestimated by 
the analytical type, underestimated by the synthetical. Two 
important results from Nanu’s experiments are (1) the linear 
arrangement of the elements for the sense-perception of number
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
works more unfavorably than the symmetrical; the circle formed 
and polygon arrangement are purposeless; (2) the number of 
simultaneously comprehended elements, without counting, is 
greater for the grown than one many times imagines; while by a 
more favorable arrangement, and without much practice, eight 
to ten elements visually simultaneous, and up to fifteen audibly 
successive can be grasped, provided definite number-concepts 
have already been attained. Meumann adds (1) that the estima- 
tion of a definite number of impressions without counting, as an 
innately accomplished function, stands against all our psycho- 
logical knowledge, (2) the recorded observations of Preyer and 
others show that children actually attain number-conceptions by 
counting. 
The experiments described above were all with adult subjects. 
Lay, Walsemann and others come closer to the school problem 
with their experiments on school children with special reference to 
favorable arrangement for the economical development of definite 
concepts. These we shall postpone for treatment in a later con- 
nection (p. 149 ff). 
(b) Counting. 
Counting, which looms so large as the sine qua non of arith- 
metical development, has an interest of its own considered as a 
psychophysical act. Briefly described from this point of view it 
is the matching up or approximate synchronization of the terms 
of two series of events in consciousness; the one being a series of 
innervations tending to motor discharge, in other words to articu- 
latory response or naming, the other a series of impressions from 
sense-stimuli. The separation of these two factors in order to 
determine how far the rate of counting and also of adding is depen- 
dent on the articulation factor forms an interesting as well as diffi- 
cult study in number consciousness. It might be supposed that
-P-A-G-E-75
Psychological Studies 63 
counting and adding, at least by adults, would become by practice 
so facile as far as the association factor is concerned, as to be prac- 
tically instantaneous, so that differences in rate will depend on 
relative difficulties of articulation. This is found to be true to a 
certain extent but not wholly so. Judd (29), after determining the 
maximum rate at which the short series of numerals (1 to 10) or 
similar groups of letters can be articulated, made experiments to 
determine the rate at which sounds, tactual impressions or suc- 
cessive visual impressions can be counted; in other words the time 
required by the process of relating the internal series to the exter- 
nal. The rapidity of articulation was found to set the limit, four 
times in five, of counting a succession of sounds (the easiest). 
The limit to counting of sounds seems to be set by some internal 
rhythm and for most of the persons investigated this was the 
rhythm of articulation. In the same individuals the other forms 
of sensory experience offered much greater difficulty and the ad- 
justment between internal and external successions is a more 
complicated process. Incidentally it was found that for 9 out of 
15 counting aloud was either more rapid than silent counting or 
equally rapid with it. In some cases the effort to inhibit articula- 
tion in counting retarded the process of silent counting so that it 
was 20 or 30 per cent slower than counting aloud. Arnett (25) 
found that “the range of variations in adding times is on the 
whole so little greater than those found for simple reading that 
it is impossible to determine without more prolonged and careful 
experiments relative ease of adding certain combinations. Sub- 
jects state that they gained many sums by associations as simple 
as reading” (25, p. 335)- 
Arnett’s study of counting (25), using educated adults as sub- 
jects, has brought out some interesting aspects. He had the 
subjects count small black labels ( 4 inch x 4 inch) one inch apart 
on a light smooth background, placed in a horizontal row on a 
level with the eye of the observer. First they counted simply
-P-A-G-E-76
  
  64 Pedagogy of “Arithmetic 
from left to right, then from right to left, then in groups of 2s, 
38, 48, 58 in both directions. Observers were directed to note 
any points concerning the psychophysiology of the process. 
Number of labels in each case was about 30, the observer never 
knowing exactly beforehand. 
Results.—(x) Numbers were usually spoken, actually or incip- | 
iently, as eye came to rest on one label or group of labels. 
(2) The sudden stop and some slight muscular punctuation 
(voluntary movement) brought the codrdination of the two 
series to consciousness. (3) Involuntary wink was a source 
orerror. (4) Counting by twos, threes, fours, fives was more 
difficult but more rapid than counting by ones.

grouping. Grouping by twos is most accurate. (5) Counting in

Arnett tried a second series of experiments on counting an 
irregular series of clicks. Two pendulums were used with different 
rates of vibration. Mercury contacts at central point of the arc 
of vibration served to make and break the circuit of an electro- 
magnet. The two pendulums vibrating nonsynchronously

caused the clicks to come irregularly, the set recurring after a fixed 
interval, about 30 clicks in each set.     
    
        
    
    
      
    
   Results.—(r) The lack of rhythm caused the count to be very 
difficult and inaccurate. (2) Corollary, our counting mechan- 
ism is rhythmical in its action. (3) Irregular counting may 
be made easier and more accurate by practice. 
An important factor in the counting process, perhaps not gen- 
erally recognized, brought out deserves special mention, viz., 
that of voluntary movement which punctuates the process and 
seems necessary to start the mechanism and keep it going. 
Touching the objects, pointing or telling off with fingers or hand 
or pencil strokes, or, if nothing more, the special fixation of the 
eyes (in visual counting): such movements are the constant 
accompaniments and excitants of the inner (speech) series. 
Pauses in the former mean concomitant pauses in the latter, and 
when punctuation is difficult as in the unrhythmical series the 
counting becomes difficult. Counting without a trace of volun- 
tary movement to set the psychophysical mechanism in order is 
very difficult for all and doubtless would be impossible for many. 
Try it. 
Looking at counting from a pedagogical standpoint, it is, of 
ourse, more than a psychophysical act. A new element enters 
n—that of its motivation—why count at all? 
At early stages in the child’s life counting is automatic, spon- 
aneous (at first without reference to objects), grows often into a 
assion which, as Burnham and others have shown, sometimes 
anifests itself pathologically. It is play, and like other play 
eeds no motive other than the fun of it. But now civilization 
ust have its inning with the little savage; his parents and
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  66 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
teachers and playmates from time to time demand numerical 
descriptions of situations; they keep asking “how many” until he 
feels the need to know “how many” and the fact that a successful 
adjustment to his environment often involves exact numbering 
must perforce gradually dawn upon his consciousness. Here then 
is the motive without which the whole process would be mean- 
ingless from the point of view of serious living, viz., the need for 
exact measurement. The measurement motif, as we shall see, 
runs as well through his later calculations and is partly social in 
~ its nature, partly mathematical per se. The demands of society 
and the nature of the content ulterior to methodology as they 
may at first be thought, must be taken into consideration in 
any pedagogical view; for psychological considerations alone 
might lead us to produce children who are prodigies of facile 
functioning, like in a measure to the historical prodigies, but 
prodigies to no purpose. The play counting and the facile process 
work are the alphabet of arithmetic and must not be neglected. 
Children having learned their letters like to say the alphabet 
forward and backward and even delight in the a-b abs and other 
nonsensical combinations, but, as everyone knows, these sporting} 
proclivities tend to drop out as soon as the serious business of 
spelling begins. 
The importance of counting and its peculiar function in the 
definition of number will appear more clearly in our later review} 
of the psychology of the number processes (p. 73 ff). A word 
ov two here as to the several phases it assumes in the child’s 
history. 
/ 1. Counting is a motor response to an inner rhythmical 
/ series without reference to objects. The responses at first ar 
certain muscular movements, as repeating strokes with th 
clock, rolling mud balls, nodding the head, arranging pebbles 
moving toes and fingers, etc., later articulating, using numbe 
names. (See our review of Phillips’s article, pp. 7-11.) 
     
   
                  
       
    
    
   
  
-P-A-G-E-79
  
Psychological Studies 67 
2. It is a mechanical application of number names to objects. 
3. It is rational counting. “This involves the putting of 
units (parts) in a certain ordered relation to one another, as 
well as marking them off or discriminating them. If when the 
child discriminates one thing from another, he loses sight of 
the identity, the link which connects them, he gains no idea ° 
of a group, and hence there is no counting. There is to him 
simply a lot of unrelated things. When we reach ‘two’ in 
counting, we must still keep in mind ‘one’; if we do not, we 
have not ‘wo’ but merely another one. Two things may be 
before us and the word ‘two’ may be uttered, but the concept 
two is absent. The concept two involves the act of putting 
together and holding together two discriminated ones” (32, 
P- 31). 
It is in this sense of the word that counting may be said 
truly to require “a considerable power of intellectual abstrac- 
tion.” The difference which makes the individuality of each 
object must be noted, and yet the different individuals must be 
grouped as one whole. Moreover, it is the kind of counting 
that must be done in order to arrive at the recognition of ob- 
jects as forming one connected whole or group. 
The controversy between Dewey and Phillips (Ped. Sem. vol. 
V, pp. 290-298 and pp. 426-434) seems largely to turn on the 
definition of the word counting. Dewey regards (3) above as the 
true counting and recognizes freely (2) as a childish sport; but 
denies the name absolutely to (1). Phillips fails to credit Dewey 
with the recognition of (2).and minimizes (3). The whole debate 
seems at this distance much like a tempest in a tea-pot. The 
three phenomena, interrelated, given above undoubtedly exist 
las described, call them by what name we will, and must be reck- 
ned with in our dealings with children. 
Sooner or later, then, the child must take up his “white man’s
-P-A-G-E-80
  
  relations, an interest which, as studies of child life show, displays 68 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
burden” of exact numbering and for a purpose. As many school 
men believe, among them Dr. Hall, he should assume this burden 
much later than he is now called upon to do. Better to allow him 
to enjoy to the full his naive interest in pure numbers and number 
     
   
               
     
               
   
     
   itself in many directions. (Pure numbers, however they may seem 
to the teacher, are not abstract to the child in this stage.) As 
soon as his number sense originates in the discrimination of a 
this and a that, it is “inevitably and incessantly applied.” So 
concrete is his imagery connected with symbols and names that 
in many cases he develops a personal feeling toward them. He 
selects favorites, personifies, socializes, dramatizes numbers in 
ways which often appear fantastic. 
Four was found by Phillips to be a very favorite number. Odd 
numbers are generally disliked. Most number systems turn upon 
ten, but some are founded on six, seven, eight and nine. “The 
most devilish thing,” says Marjorie Fleming in John Brown’s 
book, “is eight times eight and seven times seven. It is what 
human nature cannot endure.” The investigations of this topic 
are few. Sanford’s (28) study on the guessing of numbers makes| 
a slight contribution inasmuch as it may be assumed that per- 
sons in guessing will unconsciously name numbers that have aj 
personal appeal. : 
The material for this study was derived from a guessing contes 
for a prize conducted for advertising purposes by a Worceste 
merchant. The guesses were upon the number of beans in a fiv 
pint bottle filled to the cork with small white beans and conspicu: 
ously displayed in the show window. Customers were give 
with their purchases cards with places marked for the inscriptio 
of a number and for a name and address. These cards were fille 
out at the time or later and deposited in a box conveniently place 
for the purpose. The cards deposited furnish the data for th 
study. Two thousand five hundred seventy-three guesses wer
-P-A-G-E-81
  Psychological Studies 69 
made by men and boys and 244 by women and girls. The actual 
number of beans was 8,834 and the winner a man. The main 
part of the study is on the group of guessers whose names ap- 
peared not more than five times; this group consisted of 535 per- 
sons (men and boys); the results were worked out on the basis of 
1,043 cards. The range of guesses was 285 to 1,000,000. The 
median guess was 7,257. The medians of the upper and lower 
halves of the series which give the limits within which falls approx- 
imately one-half the total number of guesses are 4,173 and 9,536. 
The range from 1,200 to 16,000 includes about °/19 of the guesses.

The order of preference for digits in the units place (derived 
from Table I) is: 
eeSiata 1a 9.75. Oa 2S ae 
In the tens place (from Table IIT): 
o—s—7—8—6— (2—9) —4—3-—1 (2 and 9 have 
equal frequency).   
Leaving out of account the round numbers, repetitional and 
serial numbers (see Table II), the combinations of high frequency 
were found to be as follows: 
High frequency—75 (20, 60, 63), 76, 43, 87; 
Low frequency—66 (48, 88, 94), 14, 46, 95- 
Numbers in parentheses have equal frequency. 
Note—Read from highest to lowest in first case and from lowest 
to highest in second. 
The guesses of the women and girls were also tabulated as 
above, but no evidence was discovered that the guessing habits of 
women and girls differed from those of men and boys. 
Conclusions. Odd numbers are preferred in the units’ place 
(Table I). The advantage of odd numbers over even in the tens’ 
place almost completely disappears (Table II). For digits in the 
hundreds place the uniformity is still greater (not tabulated). 
It is evident that the final figure is most significant for the guesser. 
Two-thirds of the guessers made use of particularized numbers 
(not round numbers).
-P-A-G-E-83
  Psychological Studies 7i 
About one-third guessed round numbers or those adjacent to 
them or numbers showing a repetitional or serial character in the 
digits chosen. 
The important point brought out in this study is that there are 
undoubtedly distinct tendencies to assume differing attitudes 
toward certain numbers. Further investigation only can show 
whether anything of value to pedagogy lies in the matter, aside 
from the point already made that pure numbers have a personal 
appeal that render their early concreting for children unnecessary. 
Material for the study of the personification of numbers is more 
plentiful. 
Examples of personification given by Phillips (5): Thinking of 
4 as a fat duck, 7 a tall man, 5 a pig-tail, 9 a lazy man, etc. 
These are probably suggested by the character of the symbols. 
Functional in their origin: 7 is always trying to break into 14, 
(says one), but is crowded out by 2; it then makes a try at 28 and 
35, and finally does get into 49, etc. Here we have dramatization 
as well as personification. 
Extreme cases of personification and dramatization are those of 
Miss Whiting (27) and of Mrs. X as given by Leuba (26). In 
Miss Whiting’s case, 1, 2, and 3 were children; 4 was a good 
generous woman; 5 a reckless scamp; 6 an amiable but easily 
cheated prince; 7 an arrant rogue; 8 a haughty and very distin- 
guished lady; 9, noble but generous to a fault; 10, a cold but great 
lord; 11, the herald of the king; and 12, the king. Five coaxed a 
child to help him run away, which he did till he got to 10, but 
before he reached there stopped to try to put 6 into 12, where he 
wanted to go, but could only drop him next door. The designing 
7 tempted 5 to help him instead of 6 to get into 12. This angered 
8, who thrust 5 into 13, where he stayed until the kind 9 rescued 
him and put him into 14, etc. Mrs. X’s personifications have 
some curious details. Figure 1 is distinctly negative, it does not 
interest me, but is a him, goes about in trousers, is grown up and

slender. Two is a good-looking, fresh-complexioned, blonde, 
commonplace man, a sort of brother to 3, though not intimate 
with him. Three is a pretty girl about sixteen with curly hair and 
rosy complexion. . . . Six is a young man of about 20, a 
noble counterpart of 3, for whom he is suspected of entertaining 
tender feelings; his hair is curly and blonde; he is a beauty, broad 
shouldered, 5 feet 11 inches, an English type, fond of boating. 
Seven is a decorative old piece of bric-a-brac, in the shape of a 
retired lawyer, perhaps; tall, thin, very neat, using beautiful Eng- 
lish, and busied in trifling matters. . . . One reason why 
4 and 8 wound each other’s feelings is that 4 used to trifle 
with 6, a nice boyish fellow; now she does so less. Three and 6 
are very open in their regard. Three is in awe of 8 who used to 
tease her pleasantly, etc. As soon as Mrs. X dwelt an instant ona 
number, its personality materialized and she thought that perhaps 
the irksomeness of arithmetic made her dwell on the personal side 
of figures. She also personified capitals and printed letters. A is 
a handsome, distinguished matron. B is a middle-aged man, 
sometimes a woman. The small letters are the children of the 
large ones. Also objects in nature. A tall thin tree is likely to 
be a woman; tulips, poplars and beeches are always so, while oaks 
are masculine. Some species have both sexes. 
Miss Whiting deems her own phantasies as the mere diversions 
of a child who has tried to find entertainment from an irksome 
study. Dr. Hall cites her case and says he “believes it to be an 
unusual efflorescence of tendencies akin to those which most 
children pass through” (6, p. 356). Dr. Hall (6) made a study of a 
boy of thirteen, who came under his observation, and comes to 
the conclusion that the small numbers have an individuality due 
to their functional relations to other numbers and that these traits 
can be clearly distinguished from two other groups which spring 
(1) from name functions, (2) from the symbols, both of which 
have their own associations. ‘These individual traits suggest

            The following review is based mainly on the experimental study 
of C. E. Browne, 1906 (30) supplemented to some extent by that 
of L. A. Arnett, t905 (25). For brief statement of Browne’s 
procedure, see Appendix IT. 
The processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
division considered as psychophysical acts, afford a field of 
inquiry of considerable pedagogical significance. They all take 
their rise in counting and the association series formed in learning 
to count discover themselves as helps (sometimes as hindrances) 
in later process work. 
Addition.—The slower counting is soon replaced in the school 
history of the child by memorized tables, through which he is 
expected to form associative bonds between process and result 
that function automatically. The learning of these tables is 
(usually) a motor (linguistic) response to visual stimuli. He 
“says” his tables. At first the full verbalism of the tables is apt 
to be carried over into his process work; as, 9 and 7 are 16 and 7 
are 23, etc. The ideal of his teacher, however, is to get him to 
drop the tabular formulas and to announce (in oral adding) his 
results, using only direct numerical associations; as, 9, 16, 23, etc. 
When he can do this with a fair degree of rapidity, he has become 
a good adder; the slow adders are those who either actually or 
mentally reproduce as they add the complete formulas, or who, 
worse still, are still in the counting stage. Observation and 
experiments show a tendency of even practiced subjects to revert 
to these earlier stages in times of confusion, uncertainty, or 
atigue; they are a necessary resort in cases of lack of practice or 
eeble association,

In adding a column of figures, as in counting, an inner series of 
innervations and an outer series of motor responses are observed. 
The successive recognition of results are the stimuli to the inner 
series initiating the incipient or complete naming of the results. 
The motorization of results (always present) is an ideo-motor 
process depending for its promptness, of course, upon the prompt 
presence of the idea (the addition result); this, in turn, depends 
upon the smoothness of the association between the two numbers 
to be added, which association (presumably) has been reduced to 
automatism previously through the learning of the tables. The 
factors, stated in the order of functioning, are: (1) The recogni- 
tion of a result (except when beginning the addition of a column 
when the first digit takes the place of a result), (2) the motorizing 
of the result, (3) the recognition of a digit to be added, (4) the 
associative process leading to the sum of the two. The first is 
conscious; the second, subconscious; the third conscious, usually 
not motorized; the fourth, subconscious. The points of atten- 
tion, then, in the process are (1) and (3). Any imperfection in 
either phase of attention or in (4) results in slowness or in mis- 
takes or in both. Any retardation or difficulty in (2) in some 
cases leads to the reinstatement of the full verbalism of the 
tables (sometimes repeated again and again for the particular 
combination in view); (the combination 8 + 4, for example, is 
motorized thus: 8 and 4 are 12, instead of thus: 8, 12; or a rever- 
sion may even be had to counting, thus: 8—g, 10, 11, 12); in 
other cases to a more strongly accented and conscious saying of 
results. 
It has been intimated above that the prerequisite to expertness 
in adding is the possession by the subject of strong fundamental 
associations such as have been afforded by drill in the tables. 
(The same remark applies, of course, to the other processes.) 
Some of the combinations are more difficult than others and 
continue for a long time to be a source of friction and in some
-P-A-G-E-87
  
Psychological Studies 75 
       
   
                         
    
   
        
      
   cases are never reduced to perfect mechanism. These more diffi- 
cult combinations may be psychologically differentiated at once 
from the others in a general way by eliminating those which are 
relatively easy for every one. In the number space from 1 to 10, 
the longest step is limited to four members, as 6 + 4, 5 + 4, 
44+4,3+4,2+4;2+8,34+7,4+ 6, etc, are only appar- 
ent exceptions since they may be combined in the reverse order. 
[From a practical standpoint, it would be uneconomical to re- 
verse these combinations; they should be learned as they stand, 
because of the time-loss which would be suffered by their reversal 
each time.] 5+ 5 is a real exception, but it belongs to counting 
by 5s and is one of the easiest associations. Beyond 10 also some 
of the combinations are relatively easy. 9 + 9 belongs to count- 
ing by 9s, 10 + 10 isa count. 10 + any digit affords no diffi- 
culty. This holds for all 20s, 4os, sos plus any digit. Once 
more, all results based upon results in the space I-10, as 12 + 4, 
13 + 5,45 + 4, etc. are nearly as easy as the simple combinations. 
This elimination leaves a range of results 11 to 17 inclusive, 
derived by combining single digits, in which the character of the 
associative bonds differs from the lower range and where the main 
difficulties of fixing these bonds may be expected to arise. The 
maximum range in this space is eight members. It is with the 
digit relations in this space that the adding psychosis has to do, 
since all adding is found to be a continuous referring to numbers 
under 20. Any difficulties remaining here will be certain to crop 
up in column adding. Difficulty with 7 + 6 means difficulty with 
270; CLC. 
The introspective data in Browne’s experiments furnish evi- 
ence that the relative difficulty of the different combinations 
nds its explanation in certain laws of memory as dependent upon 
revious associative experiences. These laws were formulated by 
Ebbinghaus as the result of his study of the memory for a series 
f nonsense syllables. They seem to hold as well in single digit    
-P-A-G-E-88
  
76 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
adding. Ebbinghaus concluded from his study “that, in the 
process of impressing any series upon the mind by repetition, 
bonds of association are formed between all the individual mem- 
bers of the series. Every member of such a series acquires a ten- 
dency to bring the other members along with it when it reénters 
consciousness. These bonds or tendencies are of different degrees 
of strength. For remote members of the series, they are weaker 
than for neighboring members. The associative bonds for given 
distances backward are weaker than for the same distance for- 
ward. The strength of all bonds increases with the number of 
repetitions. But the stronger bonds between neighboring mem- 
bers are much more quickly strengthened than are the weaker 
bonds between more distant members. Therefore the more the 
number of repetitions increases, so much stronger become these 
bonds absolutely and relatively to those of more separated mem- 
bers” (Quoted by Browne, 30, p. 9)- 
Now the analogy between remembering a series of nonsense 
syllables and remembering combinations of digits is the outcome 
of a more fundamental analogy between learning to count and 
learning nonsense syllables. “Counting is purely a verbal for- 
mula, the one law being that the members always follow one 
another in the same order. The laws of association found by 
Ebbinghaus hold much more for the count than for nonsense 
syllables, in that the child goes through his series of nonsense 
syllables, the one, two, three, etc., until it is impossible to say it 
wrong, thus fastening upon his after experience in adding a bond- 
age to these laws of which the introspective date gave evidence at 
every turn” (30, p. 12). 
That primitive addition is counting there can be no doubt. 
The crude beginnings of addition are observed to be of this nature 
in children and in unpracticed adders generally. In times of con- 
fusion even practiced adders return to the count. Now the law, 
as applied to the counting series, means simply that 9, for in-
-P-A-G-E-89
  Psychological Studies 77 
stance, has a stronger association for rz (say) than for the more 
remote 2, so that, if 9 reénters consciousness, 11 is much more 
likely to be brought along with it than 2. To make the applica- 
tion to addition, let us compare two combinations: 
(ajo+3= 12 
(b) 3 +9 = 12 
In (a) 9 reénters consciousness and brings with it numbers 
closely associated with it in the count, among which is 12. In 
other words, the associative bond between 9 and 12 is strong and 
this may be expected, if the law holds throughout, to facilitate 
the forming of a strong bond between the result (12) and the 
combination (9 + 3). On the other hand, in (b), the 3 to which 9 
is to be added has a weaker affinity for 12 (being further removed 
from it in the count), and therefore the associative experiences 
of the count may be expected to give comparatively little aid to 
the addition. Hence 9 + 3 will be an easy combination, while 
3 + 9 will be comparatively difficult. Following this matter'up, 
it will be seen that, according to the law, 9 + 2 will be easier than 
9+ 3 and 9 + 4 harder; or the difficulty will increase in the order 
9+ 2,9+3,9+4,9+ 69+ 7,9 + 8, etc. (except where other factors enter in to ease up what would legally be difficult; 
e. g.,9 + 9 has been eased, let us say, through the count by gs). 
It will be noticed in the order given above that as the difficulty 
increases, the difference between the digits becomes less. The 
most concise statement of the law of difficulty in the light of the 
Ebbinghaus law is, perhaps, this: (a) Addition of the smaller of 
two digits to the larger is easier than the reverse, (b) such addi- 
tion (smaller digit to larger) will increase in difficulty in direct 
proportion to the difference between the digits. Where intro- 
spective evidence gives apparent contradictions to this law, it is 
found that certain devices have been used to ease up what is 
inherently difficult. For example 9 + 7 is made easier this way:   
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
   
    
    
    
                     
   
       
    
    
   9 +7 = 10+ 6 = 16, that is to say, enough is added to the 
larger digit to make it ro and the same amount subtracted from 
the small digit, it then being necessary only to pronounce the 
remainder and annex the syllable ten (teen). In general, this is a 
workable short step whenever the difference between the digits is 
small (not more than 1 or 2). 
This psychological testimony to the applicability of the 
Ebbinghaus law to single-digit adding is very interesting but 
cannot, of course, be deemed conclusive upon the basis of a 
single study, however carefully conducted, or however well 
trained in introspection the subjects. Arnett’s chronoscopic 
study (25) of adding-times (equally inconclusive through fewness 
of subjects, though interesting) shows in contradiction to Browne 
that adding to the larger number in case of some of the larger 
numbers is a relatively slow process (and by inference a relatively 
more difficult one); that even numbers are not easier to add than 
odd (do not take less time); that the order of the digits, generally 
speaking, does not affect time (by inference does not affect ease). 
These points and others bearing on the relative difficulty of the 
combinations, before any valid pedagogical conclusions can be 
drawn, demand further psychological inquiry and, more impor- 
tant still, studies on school children with objective criteria such as 
the amount and percentage of error discovered in the use of the 
several combinations by large groups of children. It must ke 
freely conceded, however, that the Ebbinghaus law affords the} 
best hypothesis so far at hand to explain in a psychogenetic way 
certain phenomena discovered in adding, while the adding, so t 
speak, still remains in or at times reverts to a state of nature. A 
we have seen and shall see again in considering subtraction. 
civilized short cuts and well memorized direct associations ten\ 
to obscure the working of the law but do not necessarily contra: 
vene it. So that any attempts to verify the law, say through com 
parative studies of the efficiency of school children in the severa
-P-A-G-E-91
Psychological Studies 79 
combinations, would need to be carefully scrutinized before their 
results could be held for or against the truth of the law. It would 
seem, for instance, that the more expert adders must be ruled out 
and attention given to those who are still in the barbaric stage 
of their mathematical evolution, that is to say, to the compara- 
tively inefficient. (Compare p. 288.) 
A few other results in the study by Browne may be mentioned 
briefly. 
Even numbers, as intimated above, are found easier to add than 
odd, except in cases of doubling as 3 + 3, 7 + 7, etc. And in 
such combinations as 9 + 3, in which the common factor 3 closely 
relates it to the 3 count. 
Certain special tendencies to error are noted, caused by inci- 
dental relations, peculiar juxtapositions, etc. ‘When any pre- 
ceding digit remains in or near the focus of consciousness (as often 
happens when there is uncertainty regarding the accuracy of a 
result or in case the attention has been called in particular manner 
to a particular digit) such a digit is likely to displace or change the 
digit of the result which is or should be in the focus of conscious- 
ness at that instant” (30, p. 5). 
Again, it is found that if the adding goes too fast or too slow, 
the results deteriorate. In the former case, the motorization of 
results is slurred over, and the feeling of certainty, which has 
much to do with effective work, resident in this (normally) sub- 
conscious phase of the adding process, is interfered with. In the 
latter case, while there is ample time for motorization to occur, it 
is counterbalanced by the fact that attention has between its 
normal focal points more time to wander, and accidental arrange- 
ments of digits and results become more suggestive of false asso- 
ciations. 
Combination adding (adding columns by grouping digits) is not 
found by Arnett to have any special advantages over adding by 
single digits. Those who add by simple digits are more rapid
-P-A-G-E-92
  
  80 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
and more accurate. While occasionally grouping may help, it 
may safely be left to take care of itself. Above all, as Arnett’s 
study shows, no special tendency to group particular combina- 
tions is observable. It is a matter of idiosyncrasy. No attempt 
should therefore be made to impose one person’s combinations 
on another, especially on children. 
Subtraction.—Column adding by single digits (so called in dis- 
tinction from adding columns by grouping digits) has for its 
companion process subtraction by single digits. Starting from 
roo say, one may subtract one by one a series of digits, as 
10oo — 6 — 7 — 3 — 9, etc. This process has the same four 
stages as the addition process, discussed above, viz.: (1) The rec- 
ognition of a result (except when beginning), (2) the motorizing 
of the result, (3) the recognition of a digit to. be subtracted, (4) 
the associative process leading to the difference of the two. Just 
as in addition (and in counting) the successive recognitions of 
results (in counting, the successive recognitions of events or ob- 
jects) are the stimuli to the inner series initiating the incipient or 
complete naming of results. In fact the whole discussion of 
addition applies equally well to subtraction. The same laws 
of association are operative, but with this difference—they op- 
erate in the reverse order. This proves to be a large but. The 
reverse lever is not easily applied at first. The consequence 
is that primitive subtraction is addition and more primitively 
still, counting. 
The introspective data of Browne’s subjects show that the 
more unpracticed of themi subtracted at first by adding, and while 
they soon emerged from this stage into that of direct association, 
during the time they were in it they observed a peculiar kind of 
prolonged motorization which served as part of the cause of the 
prolongation of the process asa whole; and also certain phenomena 
tending to further confirm the Ebbinghaus law. When the sub- 
traction falls in the range 1 to 10, that is, when the digit of the
-P-A-G-E-93
Psychological Studies 81 
minuend is larger than the digit of the subtrahend, it takes place 
usually by direct association. But when the digit to be subtracted 
is the larger, as soon as it is perceived in the light of the digit of 
the preceding result, it becomes a “cue” to a tentative motorizing 
of a partially apprehended result. To illustrate, let us follow the 
i subtraction, 44 — 6, through the four stages: (1) 44 (a previous 
remainder) is recognized, (2) it is motorized, (3) 6 is recognized 
and compared with 4, (4) there is with the unpracticed no smooth 
working of a direct association, leading to the prompt recognition 
of the complete result and its motorization, but only the recogni- 
tion of the partial result (thirty “something’”’) and ifs motoriza- 
tion; this continues into thirty “something” and 8 are 44, 
thirty-six and 8 are 44. This may be termed a “natural” proced- 
ure. The associations derived from the counting ‘stage are for- 
ward associations, hence associations backward are weaker. The 
tendency at first, therefore, is to translate the backward associa- 
tions of subtraction into the forward ones of addition, so that as 
far as the fundamental laws of association are concerned, sub- 
traction by addition is easier. It is a natural method. It is 
hardly necessary to add that it is a primitive method, that is to 
say, barbarous. It is awkward, roundabout, time-destroying. 
It was found that the subjects by a small amount of practice 
showed great gain in deriving remainders directly and so dispens- 
ing with addition. The interest of teachers, therefore, in addi- 
tion-subtraction is, or should be, paleontological. Children hav- 
ing gained the direct associations, whatever reversions they may 
make involuntarily to earlier evolutionary stages, surely should 
not be forced into a revivification of a ghostly, or shall we say, 
ghastly past. 
In subtraction, the Ebbinghaus law seems to be working in 
several particulars. 
. Subtraction is harder than evince, which fact stated in 
a of the law takes the form—associations backward are  
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  82 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
     
   
                      
         
    
           
    weaker than for the same distances forward, decreasing in 
strength as the distance between members increases. 
2. While subtraction is still in the primitive stage certain 
subtractions are by preference performed directly, instead of 
additively. We have seen that certain hard additions (by the 
law and by introspection) become easy when aided by sub- 
traction (8 + 7 = 10+ 5). (Practiced performers tend to use 
such easy cuts and so obscure the law.) Similarly, when the 
additive performance of a subtraction involves a weak associa- 
tive bond, the tendency is to subtract directly because the 
subtraction association (count backward), though reversed, 
is at least as strong or stronger than the forward association. 
Thus, 12 — 3 = 9 gives a relatively weak association forward 
(3 and ? are 12); hence subtraction is easier; 12 — 9 = 3 gives 
a strong association forward (9 and ? are 12); hence addition in 
this case is apt to be used (primitively speaking, of course). 
3. After the subject has emerged into the stage of direct 
association, as a rule he does not trust his remainders. His} 
remainders now are obtained by a pure tour de force of memory, 
a new set of associations imposed, as it were, upon those tha 
took their roots in a primitive stage of his mathematical evolu 
tion; the latter served him well then, but now have no organi 
connection with his new set. He constantly tends to rever 
to the old set for verification; he is always wanting to “prove? 
his subtraction by addition. This is only another illustratio 
of the greater stability of earlier modes of behavior, whethe: 
racial or individual. 
The practical aspect of subtraction is written subtractio: 
Column subtraction is practiced only as a school-room device. 
The point of importance in connection with it, not covered b; 
the preceding discussion, is the different methods that may b 
employed. What method is most economical and least liable t 
error? Such a question is best approached by studies in objectiv]
-P-A-G-E-95
Psychological Studies 83 
efficiency. Nevertheless, results so obtained would still await 
explanation, and any light from psychological experimentation 
may be welcomed. 
The so-called Austrian method (by addition) is ruled out by 
considerations previously presented. This narrows the available 
methods to two, the prevalent one of borrowing one, when neces- 
sary, from the preceding minuend figure; and another in which one 
under like necessity, is added to the subtrahend. The psychology 
of the matter-hinges upon the number of points of attention re- 
quired in obtaining a given figure of the remainder; the fewer the 
points, the less time required and the less liability to error. 
In the common method of borrowing from the minuend, when 
the minuend figure is smaller than the subtrahend, one is taken 
from the preceding minuend figure and imaged along with the 
minuend figure to be used. By analysis of the further process 
into steps this taking of the one is seen to be separated from the 
next minuend figure by four points: (a) the resulting figure of the 
remainder, (b) the recognition of the next figure of the subtra- 
hend, (c) the recognition of the relative size of this figure and 
the corresponding figure of the minuend, (d) the recognition of 
the minuend figure (to be reduced). 
In the method of adding one to the subtrahend, the habit is to 
image the upper figure at once as a teen, then between this and 
the increasing of the figure of the subtrahend, which is the final 
point of attention in the process, only one point intervenes, viz., 
the recognition of the result. 
Hence, it is concluded, and it would seem upon good grounds, 
that the latter method is the better. Some interest attaches here 
to the effect on the process of the ideational type of the subject. 
From a psychological standpoint it would be worth while to trace 
this in some detail. The foregoing account is based upon the 
assumption that the subject is of the visual type in his conscious 
imagery. It is found that four focal points of attention occur in
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  84 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
the first method. The same would be true of the motor-type. 
The mixed type would not differ here, but in the second method 
an additional point would intervene. 
In any case the conclusion as to the relative merit of the two 
methods is not altered. 
Multiplication Multiplication is a short cut to the sum of 
equal numbers. The race could conceivably have gotten along 
without multiplication and division, addition and subtraction 
_ answering all the necessities of computation, but at great expense 
of time. Multiplication and division must be regarded as more 
highly developed processes than their predecessors and doubtless 
should come somewhat later in the history of the child as they 
came much later in the history of the race. Both are highly arti- 
ficial, but multiplication is the more primitive, being more closely 
affiliated to the count. Division, while genetically a derivative 
from subtraction, is practically the reverse of multiplication and 
greatly dependent upon it. 
In multiplying a series of digits by a given multiplier, the paral- 
lelism between outer and inner series (the recognition of results 
[products] and motor responses more or less incipient), which 
were noted in addition and subtraction, is found again operative. 
Any lack of promptness in the functioning of the associative factor 
(process with result) leads to a more decided motorizing of the 
delayed result, sometimes to a full reinstatement, more or less} 
conscious, of the complete verbalism of the tables». The ideal is, 
given a multiplier (8) and a multiplicand (9), to pronounce o} 
write at once the product (72). In a series of multiplications th 
multiplier is almost an unconscious element in the process, th 
multiplicand is the focus of attention, the product is expected t 
be immediately associated therewith, the verbalism, which wa: 
established through the auditory-motor learning of the tables, 
having through practice dropped away. Children, as teacher 
know, in whom the tabular associations are not fully establishe    
   
   
         
     
   
                   
    
    
-P-A-G-E-97
Psychological Studies 85 
revert to the count in times of delayed association. This close 
affiliation of multiplication to the count renders it more stable 
than division with greater sense of dependableness on results 
through the consciousness of the ever-present possibility of the 
restoration of lost results. i 
Division, with its direct and isolated associations (in practiced 
performers) of process with result, yields less dependableness 
and the constant tendency, therefore, is to “prove” division by 
multiplication. 
In written multiplication the motorization of results suffers 
modification. The act of writing the unit figure of each product 
which is automatic tends to take the place of the linguistic motor- 
izing so far as the unit figure is concerned, and the linguistic 
motorizing goes largely to the tens figure of each product. Thus 
the tens figure is objectified and held until it has properly func- 
tioned in the carrying process. 
Carrying in written multiplication is the source of many errors. 
Though it is a mere matter of addition even good adders make 
more mistakes than might be expected. One explanation is that 
the conditions of normal adding are reversed, the digit to be added 
coming first, the product to which it is to be added second. 
Division.—In dividing a series of multiples by a common factor 
the familiar synchronization of two series of phenomena again 
ppears. The motorization of results in some form is always pres- 
nt and any interference with it results in a feeling of uncertainty. 
his is true of all the four processes. At first, traces of the multi- 
plication formula appear, but after practice grow less and direct 
ssociations are used. 
Written division is complicated by the fact that the successive 
artial dividends to be dealt with in an example are not always 
xact multiples of the divisor, and by the multiplication and sub- 
raction operations that must be brought in. The source of errors 
quotient figures will often be found not in the division operation     
   
      
   
        
    
          
   
     
  
-P-A-G-E-98
  
86 | Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
but in one of the other operations involved. The writing of the 
quotient figure tends to become automatic and to go along as a 
parallel but separate series. Attention is thus freed and passes at 
once to the subtraction. ‘“The difficulty of the process as a whole 
increases proportionally with the size of the divisor, because of the 
increased range of possibilities as to the dividend numbers falling 
above the multiple” (30, p. 37)- 
Browne gives the following kinds of errors occurring in division 
proper, as the result of his study. 
Any factor commonly used as a divisor of a given dividend is lia- 
ble to appear as the quotient digit, or even the divisor itself may 
so appear. Three kinds of such errors follow: 
rt. Errors making the divisor or some other factor of the divi- 
dend the quotient digit, as 24 + 8, giving a quotient of 8 or 4. 
Numbers such as 24, 16, 12, containing more than two factors 
commonly used as divisors, were especially liable to this kind 
of error. Such errors are insidious because the subject gener- 
ally passes over them with no sense of inaccuracy. 
2. Dividing a digit by itself, as 5 + 5 = 5. 
3. When only a difference of one exists between the divisor 
and quotient digits, the subject frequently has difficulty in 
selecting the required quotient. 
In 72 + 8 = 9, Sand 9 are contiguous members of the counting 
series; as one comes into consciousness it tends to bring the 
other along with it and this creates a doubt as to which is really 
right. 
Tt will be interesting to see whether tests of school children con- 
firm these results. (See page 290 ff.) 
Remarks.—One phenomenon was observed in all four processes. 
/When the recognition series gets too far ahead of motorizing series 
the subconsciously following train of motor results is apt to be} 
lost sight of. In any case, this was always felt to be a danger, and}
-P-A-G-E-99

a uniform time per digit seemed desirable. In addition, for exam- 
ple, where the attention moves on to the digit to be added before 
the motorization of the previous sum has taken place, the error 
of substituting the perceived digit for the digit of the sum often 
occurs. 
Another phenomenon noted common to all the processes is the 
assumption at the beginning of a certain attitude of mind corre- 
sponding to the intention, to perform the process. Its office is to 
direct the association processes and hold them within the proper 
field. The “set,” as it is called, is much strengthened by the first 
steps in the series in each of the four simple processes, but is 
harder to initiate in subtraction than in the others. In multipli- 
cation it is intimately connected with anticipation and its prin- 
cipal element is the multiplier. 
There is no great difference in the imagery employed in the 
several processes. In all subjects the terms used were largely 
motor or motor-auditory (linguistic). Visual imagery, though 
present, apparently is less fundamental. 
Psychological studies such as the foregoing and, we may add, 
studies in objective intelligence which will come later, con- 
tribute results of only partial significance for the teach- 
ing problems (problems of method). These studies make the 
person central; his capabilities and his limitations afford the 
primary question. But there are other questions which are 
constantly arising in connection with such studies. One of these 
is that of the orderly content and purpose of studies (choice and 
organization of stimuli—the what and the why). To be able to 
know how and when the child’s mind functions best along certain 
lines and most economically for certain results is of great impor- 
tance to the pedagogue in this connection, for it puts him upon 
searching out from the complex environment to which the child is
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
to be adjusted just those stimuli and just that order of stimuli 
which will occasion the appropriate timely economical mental | 
activity. But since in the varied content there is a choice of 
stimuli, and from the purely psychological standpoint one stim- 
ulus may be as good as another, it follows that stimuli should be 
selected and organized not only with reference to the mental 
functioning of the child, but also with reference to what may be 
termed ulterior demands, the demands, say, of social or economic 
utility or of thoroughgoing scholarship in a subject. Otherwise 
a psychological monstrosity might be produced, a prodigy of 
facile functioning, but a creature out of tune with the universe. 
The nature of the subject matter itself and its organization 
ith reference to some aim are important considerations, then, in 
determining teaching procedure, whether it be in arithmetic or 
in any other subject. Not only how does the child learn number, 
but what of number should he learn and why should he learn this 
at all are the questions. As the latter question is differently an- 
swered, the procedure of the best pedagogues within the limits set 
by the results of psychological and objective studies will vary. 
The one who believes that the aim is to make of the child a calcu- 
lating machine will organize the subject to that end and will use 
\ whatever insight he may have acquired to secure a presentation 
that will insure most advantageous mental functioning on the part 
of the child to that end. The one who believes that the aim is to 
_ occasion the acquirement of as much as possible of mathematical 
| insight, particularly if this can be done without sacrificing facil- 
{ ity in computation, will strive to discover and to apply the nature 
| of number, the psychology of number processes from the point off 
view of rational procedure, with occasional excursions even into 
th¢ philosophy of mathematics. 
The latter aim I believe to be the true one, because while i 
affords a broad basis of organization, it does not, as the epilogu 
; will show, prevent the attainment of more proximate and perhap:

   more immediately appealing aims. If it be the true one, then 
the one to decide the aim of elementary instruction in arithmetic 
is the university mathematical scholar; or, if we cannot catch his 
ear, then the educational thinker who has sufficient knowledge 
of mathematics to appreciate what it essentially is. If we ask 
the scholar (or the thinker) what to teach the child, he will, we . 
believe, be apt to answer, thinking of mathematics as a unitary 
subject and not made up of separate compartments (with his 
vision pointing beyond merely immediate aims), ‘Teach him 
that number is ratio; this is fundamental.” 
The adoption of this far-reaching aim does not preclude atten- 
tion to many proximate aims making for practical efficiency 
which will continually crop up along the pathway of the practical 
teacher. Here the teacher will need all the light that can be shed 
upon persistent problems by experimental pedagogy. He may 
be willing to accept from the mathematician or the philosopher 
the ultimate goal, but once having accepted it, he will be very 
careful not to allow his zeal to overrun his discretion by accept- 
ing uncritically all the philosopher or the mathematician may 
Ihave to say about his everyday work. He will know that the 
recognition of the distinction between number and quantity, that 
mumber is the measure of quantity, that number is psychical, not 
hysical, will come late in the mental development of the chil- 
ren and that for some children, during the years of the elemen- 
ary school, it will not come at all. At the same time he will 
ealize that the incompetence of some children to rise to the full 
(or indeed partial) stature of arithmetical insight affords to him 
o reason for depriving others of their birthright. He will be 
areful to give to his children all that the mere drill-master can 
bive, but he will give much more besides to those that have the 
bility to receive. Much that he does will be caviare to the 
eneral. Indeed, there may be periods when even with 
is best pupils the sledding appears difficult, at which
-P-A-G-E-102
  go Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
times it will be the part of wisdom to wait for more snow 
(greater maturity). 
It is hoped that it will appear plain before the end of this 
part of the discussion that nothing will be lost to minor aims 
by keeping in mind the large aim of rational procedure with the 
end of conferring arithmetical insight; those who stop short 
of the higher mathematics will lose nothing in the way of cal- 
culating facility, on the contrary something will be gained 
toward easing the processes themselves, as such; while those who 
pursue their mathematical studies in high school and college will 
have been furnished in their elementary arithmetical training 
a groundwork (implicit, at least, but also to a considerable 
extent explicit with the better minds) for later growth in power. 
In_clementary instruction the rationality of procedure, let us 
concede, will be explicit at all stages only in the mind of the 
teacher; but it will be implicit (at least) also at all stages in the 
mind of the child. The implicitness for the child will consist 
in habits of performance with respect to the arithmetical proc- 
esses, the full import of which he may not at first grasp, but 
which, nevertheless, are intelligible and which will not need to 
be unlearned when his dawning mathematical consciousness 
brings him to the point, now and again, of apprehending their 
rational significance. He will not be a victim of arrested devel- 
opment induced by too long dwelling on the merely mechanical 
aspects of number processes, a semiidiotic chatterer of numerical 
nonsense syllables to whom it is vain to attempt to present the 
more thoughtful aspects; for all along the way every thought- 
spark that is potential in him will have been given a chance to 
flash. 
First, then, for the child the inculcation of right habits giving 
correct mental attitude is indicated; the interpretation thereof, 
(the result of inner growth) as his strength permits, to accompany 
or to follow; this is the psychological key to the problem. Is it
-P-A-G-E-103
Psychological Studies gI 
not the psychological key to more than one educational situation? 
It is so in moral education. First moral habits (to the extent of 
automatism if possible), habits moral for the child in an implicit 
sense only; later ethical interpretations. . In religious education; 
first social service (explicitly religious only for the relatively 
mature person), then theological interpretations. 
This discussion naturally brings us to a consideration of the 
classic production in this country on the subject, McLellan and 
Dewey’s Psychology of Number (New York, 1898). 
The word psychology has hitherto been used in the sense of 
the psychophysics of the number processes. In this book, the 
emphasis, so far as the book is a psychology, is mainly for the 
child upon the motivation of these processes and for the teacher 
upon the consequences that flow into method from keeping stead- 
ily in mind the raison d’étre of the processes. 
Thave attempted to present its main thesis concretely by setting 
forth below briefly the material presented in chapter 6 and 7 
(Arithmetical Operations or the Development of Number), going 
beyond these chapters occasionally for supplementary matter. 
These chapters present the essence of the whole matter in applied 
form, and, it may be added, that these and other concrete chap- 
ters have been largely ignored by those who have discussed the 
book unfavorably. As a practical school man I shall find it 
necessary to differ from the book on a few points of school-room 
procedure, and on one or two points of fact. 
Every numerical operation involves three factors: (1) a quan- 
tity or magnitude to be measured, (2) a unit of measurement, 
(3) a ratio of the first to the second; this last factor is the number. 
‘Example: one coat cost $4, two coats can be bought for $8. 
The measured quantity is $8, the measuring unit is $4. ($8 + $4 
= 2). Again, four coats cost $8, one coat costs $2. Here the 
3 are conceived of as 8 one-dollars and arranged in four 
roups:     
       
   
   
      
   
              
   
       
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
-$ $$ $ bi 
$$$ $ 
Each group contains $2 ($8 + 4 = $2). The measured quantity 
is $8, the measuring unit, which in this case is sought, is $2, the 
number (a given factor in this case) is 4. 
The operation can be naturally and completely apprehended 
only when these three factors are introduced. This does not 
mean that they are always to be formulated. On the contrary, 
the formulation at the outset would be confusing; it would 
be too great a tax on attention. But the three factors must be 
present and must be wsed to the end that out of such habituation 
the true nature of number may gradually be evolved. 
It is plain that the three factors are involved in division, as 
appears above; also in multiplication: one coat costs $2, 4 coats 
will cost $8. (4 X $2 = $8). The measured quantity is $8; 
the unit, $2; the number, 4. But does this appear in addition? 
Take a simple case. John has $2, James $3, Alfred $4; how much 
have they altogether? (1) The total magnitude the amount 
(muchness) altogether, is here the thing sought for. (2) The 
unit of measurement is the one dollar. (3) The number is the 
measuring of how many of these units there are in all, namely, 
nine. When discovered it defines or measures the how much of 
the magnitude which is at first but vaguely conceived. In 
other words, it must be borne in mind that the thought of some 
inclusive magnitude must, psychologically, precede the operation, 
if its real meaning is to be apprehended. The conclusion simply 
defines or states exactly how much is that magnitude which at 
the outset is grasped only vaguely as mere magnitude. (The 
last three statements may be accepted provided they be under- 
stood as defining a point of view into which the child is gradually 
to be inducted. But that there should be much practice in the 
processes without conscious evaluation goes without saying; that
-P-A-G-E-105
  Psychological Studies 93 
the authors do not mean otherwise is gathered from scattered 
statements urging the importance of practice with pure numbers.) 
Further examples illustrating the definition of number are: the 
yard of cloth costs seventeen cents; the box will hold thirty-six 
cubic inches; the purse contains eight ten-dollar gold pieces. 
The seventeen, thirly-six, eight express the numerical values of 
the quantities; they are pure numbers, the results of a purely 
mental process (psychical products, not physical aggregations) ; 
they represent the relative value or ratio of the measured 
quantity to the unit of measurement. The numerical value 
and the unit of measurement taken together express the absolute 
value (or magnitude) of the measured quantity. Number is 
thus seen to be the product of the mere repetition of a unit of 
measurement; it simply indicates how many there are; it is purely 
abstract, denoting the series of acts by which the mind constructs 
defined parts into a unified and definite whole. Absolute value 
(quantity numerically defined) is represented by the application 
of this how many to magnitude, to quantity; that is, to limited 
quality. Number, simply as number, always signifies how many 
times one “so much” (the unit of measurement) is taken to make 
up another “so much,” the magnitude to be measured. It is 
due to the fundamental activities of mind, discrimination and 
relation working upon a qualitative whole. Quantity, the unity 
measured, whether a “collection of objects” or a physical whole, 
is continuous, and undefined how much; number as measuring 
value is discrete, how many. The magnitude (muchness) before 
measurement is mere unity; after measurement it is an aggrega- 
tion of parts (units) making up one whole; number (showing 
how many) refers to the units which put together make the sum 
(or product). Quantity, measured magnitude, is always concrete; 
it is a certain kind of magnitude, length, volume, weight, area, 
amount of cost, etc. Number, as simply defining the how many 
units of measurement, is always abstract.  
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
From what has been said above, McLellan and Dewey’s 
doctrine of the nature and definition of number should be 
clear. It will be further brought out, however, as we pro- 
ceed through their discussion of the furidamental opera- 
tions. Their purpose is to show that the operations repre- 
sent the internal and intrinsic development of number 
(and to point out the educational bearing of this fact); that 
they are processes of the measurement of magnitude—trans- 
forming a vague idea of quantity into a definite one, not 
something externally performed upon or done with existing or 
ready made numbers; that they are intrinsic in the idea of 
number itself [and are motivated by an instinctive mental 
movement to ascertain the numerical value of the qualitatively 
limited objects in the environment—they constitute one mode of 
exploring the world]. [The world takes on a greater and greater 
degree of mathematical definition, a more and more refined 
numerical evaluation, as the processes grow in accuracy and 
definiteness, the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division being the successive phases of this 
growth.| 
Addition and Subtraction.—In the addition or subtraction of 
quantities we are not conscious of their ratio; we do not even 
use the idea of their ratio. Even in this phase, however, the 
child may be led to evaluate the sum or the difference (e. g., 
$256 as 256 times $1), and to think of it as quantity to be meas- 
ured. But addition is mere aggregation and subtraction the find- 
ing of how much more or less. This is the discovery of a kind of 
relationship, but not of ratio. The whole is the sum of all its} 
parts and the difference is a comparison of greater with less. 
The idea of relative value in this one point of moreness or| 
aggregation is brought out, but not the idea of what multiple or| 
part one of the quantities is of the other. This is a more com-+ 
plex conception and so a later mental product.
-P-A-G-E-107
  
Psychological Studies 95 
   
    
    
    
                     
   
             
    Addition, as having a reason for being, is a process of breaking 
up a whole into parts and then putting together these parts into 
a whole. Thus, what was originally a vague magnitude is meas- 
ured or defined and given a precise numerical value. This point 
of view alone gives any reason for performing the operation and 
sets a limit to it. 
To teach the addition facts in any small number we may 
begin with an arrangement of sticks or splints that will lend 
itself to the grasping of the number as a whole, for instance 
for six. Here we have a unity which the child may grasp 
as a whole, but indefinitely. The procedure indicated, then, 
is the analysis of this whole into parts for the purpose of chang- 
ing the vague unity into a measured unity. So the child pro- 
ceeds to count off the various sticks. If the square rey has 
already been mastered, the figure will be recognized ——' as 
one 4-++ one 2. Or if one of the diagonals is changed thus Z| 
it will be recognized as two triangles—that is, as 
one 3 + one 3. Of course, it may be taken all to 
pieces and put together again, and recognized as 6 ones; 
or they may be arranged as 3 twos AA A. In this way 
the pupil is always working within a unity, gradually securing its 
completer definition, while gaining facility in computation. He is 
being trained in the recognition of six at a glance (which all pri- 
mary teachers aim to secure by whatever method). He is given 
the maximum opportunity for the exercise of power in answer 
to his constructive interest; he is left the minimum for mere me- 
chanical drill. In a word, the rational teaching direction here 
indicated both for power and practical efficiency is: Begin with a 
whole which may be intuitively presented and proceed by the partition 
lof this original whole into minor wholes, and their recombination. 
[I have stated the plan of teaching beginning addition in 
some detail because it affords an excellent illustration of the 
point that there need be no conflict between rational procedure
-P-A-G-E-108
  
  96 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
and practical efficiency, indeed the latter is aided by the former. 
All primary teachers agree, I suppose, that at this stage the 
desideratum is the grasping of a whole intuitively presented. - 
This numerical apprehension of a group of objects can reach 
certainty only by means of the counting habit which by practice 
and certain groupings approximates more and more nearly to 
instantaneousness, until it is scarcely to be distinguished from 
intuition. Now the prevailing procedure with reference to sub- 
traction and division has necessarily been analytical, but with 
reference to addition and multiplication, synthetical from the 
start. The result has been the cultivation of two mental habits 
where one would do; the synthetical habit, viz., of merely aggre- 
gating quantities into a sum which does not look back to the 
parts composing it is a bad one, because it secures only the 
proximate aim of mechanical association of numbers to be added 
or multiplied with sum or product; and occasions the slowness 
with which groups are grasped as wholes, a matter not surprising 
when it is considered that it has been wholly unemphasized by 
the teacher, having been left to be caught accidentally or provi- 
dentially by the pupil.] | 
By this method the subtractions are given along with the addi- 
tions because the reaction to a group of objects may be eithe: in 
terms of addition or of subtraction. Thus may mean 4 + 2 
or 6— 40r 6—2. For purposes of practice in discovering the 
number facts in a group, a symmetrical arrangement of dots 
symbolical of any sort of objects may, perhaps, be more advan- 
tageously used than objects. (Objects of course should always 
precede any sort of symbolism.) Thus six may be represented 
thus :::. Four plus two, six minus two, six minus four may 
then be shown thus ::| : , etc. ! 
Subtraction, however, is slightly more complex than addition, 
in that it is necessary to note at the same time both the whole 
and one of the parts. In addition, the whole emphasis is upon 
| 
|
-P-A-G-E-109
Psychological Studies 97 
     
    
   
                                               
    the result—the parts are merged at once into it. As motivating 
the process, the approach to it should be made analytical by 
cailing attention from the beginning to the undefined whole, 
which, through addition, is to become definite. 
Multiplication—The principle of measuring with an exact 
unit, i. e., a unit which is itself made up of minor units in the 
same scale, gives rise to multiplication and division. Such 
measurement discovers in each case a certain relation of the 
magnitude measured to the measuring unit. Hence arises the 
ratio idea. No such idea appears in addition or subtraction, 
although some preparation has been made for its appearance by 
the addition of equal addends and the successive subtractions of 
equal subtrahends. But the operation, 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12, 
treated simply as addition, does not give rise to the multiplication 
idea. It is necessary to count the addends and to become con- 
scious that the number, four, is a factor of a product, twelve, 
expressing the ratio of the unit 3 to the product. This abstract 
notion, which is involved in all multiplication, renders multipli- 
cation psychologically more complex than addition, though it 
logically depends upon it and genetically is derived from it. 
Although multiplication is essentially a synthetic process, yet the 
approach should be analytical or else the operation is “figuring” 
and nothing more. The order of attention is as follows: (1) the 
vague sense of some whole which is to be more accurately de- 
termined by some product, (2) the multiplicand, a quantity or 
magnitude made up of a number of “primary units,” (3) the 
multiplier, the number of times this derived unit is to be repeated; 
in other words, the ratio, (4) the product, the definite measure- 
ment of the former vague whole in terms of the primary unit. 
It is important that the quantity which is to be finally expressed 
y the product should be first suggested, in order that the habit 
f regarding number as measuring quantity may be permanently 
ormed; or, if not suggested at the beginning, then interpreted  
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
when obtained as the accomplished measurement of a measured 
quantity in terms of some unit of reference. This plan works 
toward giving the work an inherent interest and cultivates 
mathematical insight. Work with pure numbers, at the same 
time, must by no means be neglected. 
Division.—Division has its genesis in subtraction but is not 
identical with it. The number of 4s in 12, for example, may be 
found primitively by successive subtractions of 4 from 12, pro- 
vided the number of 4s is counted and registered as the measure of 
the 12 in terms of the unit 4. Here, again, we see the function 
of counting in the measuring process. Its service to measure- 
ment as a means to an end lifts it above the level of mere enum- 
eration for its own sake and gives it rational significance.    
   
     
         
   
       
    
     
     
   
     
       The successive subtractions in parting a group of objects com- 
pose the presentative phase of division. But the division ideal 
does not arise in its fullness until the parts are counted and they 
whole again thus reconstructed. Through constructive exercise 
of this sort, division is gradually developed as the inverse o: 
multiplication, and the multiplication tables are seen to be usefu 
in short circuiting the process of division, as they were previous! 
so found in the addition of equal addends. Whereas the proble 
in multiplication is: 4 times 5 feet = 20 feet, the problem in divisio 
is: given 20 feet and either of the factors to find the other factor 
In either case, “we first of all determine what the problem de 
mands, times or parts, then operate with the pure numbe 
symbols and interpret the result according to the conditions o 
the problem.” It is unnecessary to force the learner into makin, 
refined distinctions in this connection between two kinds of divi 
sion, one of which may be called “partition.” As far as the bar 
operationis concerned there is only onekind of division, but therei 
no escape from the alternative interpretation of the result in eac! 
case, even with the beginner. Stillless necessary isit (here we oppos 
McLellan and Dewey) to introduce the law of commutation. Ha
-P-A-G-E-111

    ing given careful consideration to the very clear presentation of 
this law on pp. 74-77, 113, 117, 120-122, 137, 163, 164, 168-170 
of the book, my conclusion is that it should be very sparingly 
adverted to in multiplication and religiously abjured in division. 
So clear is the presentation that it becomes very plain to the 
reader that there are as a matter of fact fwo kinds of division— 
witness the procedure with objects, the actual process which dis- 
covers the nature of the operation. For example, 20 apples + 5 
apples requires quite a different procedure with objects from 20 
apples divided by 5, that is, into 5 groups. But it appears further 
that wpon reflection (the phrase “upon reflection” is added by 
the writer as it is unaccountably omitted in the book) these two 
processes are so closely correlated as to be identical. That is to 
say, in both there is a mental sequence of five acts (a count of 
five), which is repeated until the 20 is used up, and finally the 
number of such sequences is counted and found to be four. This 
is undoubtedly true and is calculated to appeal tremendously to 
the child with the philosophical mind. Puzzle—find the child 
with the philosophical mind. The two processes may be admitted 
to be correlates, or even identities provided that they be ab- 
stracted from the concrete problems that gave them birth. To 
show what happens in the application of this philosophical 
correlation to concrete work, take the problem: Divide 20 
apples among 5 boys; here the 5 shows the number of groups 
into which 20 apples are to be separated. Shall we, then, for the 
sake of making division a process of subtraction (in the interests 
of its genetic origin) call 5, 5 apples? “Yes,” say McLellan and 
ewey, “since 20 apples + 5 apples and 20 apples + 5 are by the 
aw of commutation psychic identities.” So we have for our solution 
© apples + 5 apples = 4. We can imagine the consternation of 
he ordinary child at this mysterious and sudden transmutation, 
t the joyous touch of the philosopher’s stone, of boys into apples. 
e can also sympathize with his cheerful struggles to interpret  
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
the four of the quotient, should his teachers be so unkind as to 
insist upon it. 
So much for the philosophical correlate as a school-room device. 
McLellan and Dewey call these processes psychological corre- 
lates. As a matter of fact, what is the psychological correlate of 
20 apples + 5 apples = 4? Without answering this dog- 
matically I would suggest to any one interested in discovering it 
to make the following simple experiment on one or more primary 
children. Count out four groups of 5 objects each, thus: 
M//1 M/1/ LL It     
   
      
     
   
   
     
        
     
    Get the numerical reaction of the children upon this grouping 
by asking them to write as many different kinds of equations as 
they can think of, suggested by the grouping. The division 
equations obtained will be the true psychological correlates or 
identities for that process, according to my way of thinking. 
McLellan and Dewey do well to intimate in one place that 
nothing is to be said about the law of commutation wntil the 
time is ripe. It appears certain that the time is nof ripe during 
the elementary period of school life. 
It is in the division process that number as measurement is 
afforded the most adequate field, so far reached, for exploitation, 
Starting as it does with a definite magnitude to be operated upon, 
the necessity of conceiving of a vague magnitude to be measure! 
as in multiplication is not encountered. By working the tw 
processes together the nature of multiplication as analytical in it 
first intention is cleared up, since division, which is analytica 
throughout, is seen to be working with the same data, inversely, 
The expression of measured quantity, once more, has tw 
elements, the unit of measure and the number of these unit 
constituting the quantity. The cost of a farm of sixty acres ai 
fifty dollars an acre is sixty fifties. Here the unit is $50 and th
-P-A-G-E-113
Psychological Studies 101 
number is 60. But note that the unit is itself made up of minor 
units (one dollar), it is itself a measured quantity; and further, 
that, when the cost of the farm is completely expressed, it is 
defined in terms of the minor units, viz., 300 one-dollars. We thus 
have in the complete expression of the measured quantity, besides 
'the two elements already named, a third, viz., the minor or pri- 
mary unit (in this case $1) from which the actual unit of measure- 
ment ($50) is derived. 
It is interesting to see that the fraction, as McLellan 
and Dewey point out, gives complete expression through 
its notation to the process of measurement. In $3 for 
example, we have what may be viewed in the aspect 
of a measured ‘whole, the same as the 300 dollars above. 
It is defined in terms of the primary unit (one dollar); the 
actual unit of measure is derived from the primary by dividing it 
into four equal parts and taking one of the parts (one-fourth dol- 
lar); the numerator 3 shows how many of these units make up 
the given quantity, and expresses the ratio of this quantity ($%) 
to the derived unit ($1). (McLellan and Dewey say that 3 
expresses the ratio of the quantity to the standard unity; 
this, of course, is a mistake, this ratio being expressed by the 
fraction itself.) In the expression ${, note that the number is 
the numerator 3; fourths designate the repeated unit; there 
are three fourths. This is true whether the primary unit is a 
single dollar or a number of dollars. For example, in the ex- 
pression 3 x $8, the primary unity, or, as it may be called, the 
standard unity or unit of reference, is $8; the derived unit 
(measuring unit) is $2 (one of the four equal parts of $8); com- 
pleting the process we get $6, which is 3 times $2 
Considered as a measured quantity, then, the numerical aspect 
of the fraction centers in the numerator; but the fractional nota- 
tion has the advantage over integral of giving compactly, by 
Imeans of the reciprocal of the denominator, along with the num-

ber the unit numbered, Hence every fraction may be conceived 
of as expressing the ratio of a measured quantity to a measuring 
unit. In the complex fraction, this appears as well as in the simple 
fraction. For example, take oe Factoring HL = 9X 4, which, 
3/4 ala 
being ae from our present point of view, means that the 
ratio of —— to $ 
a vad 
It may be remarked at this point that complex fractions (and 
compound, as well) possess for the school man only an academic 
interest. Concrete problems tuat might be allowed to give rise 
to them can always obtain their numerical solutions in processes 
that involve simple fractions. From the standpoint of the peda- 
gogue the nomenclature and all that appertains to it may very 
well be passed over to the limbo of the curiosity shop. 
We may agree with McLellan and Dewey that the fraction is to 
beviewed asaconcrete measured quantity and isto be apprehended 
in terms of (r) the measuring unit determined by the relation 
of the denominator to the unit of reference, and (2) the ratio of 
the measured quantity (the fraction) to this measuring unit. 
This is the insight to be gained sooner or later in the interest of 
sound mathematical training, toward which the teacher should 
consciously lead the child. But it still remains true (and with 
this McLellan and Dewey would doubtless agree) that the full 
measure of this conception must be a somewhat mature product 
of earlier work with fractions in which the ratio idea lies fallow, 
although it is ever implied. As a matter of detail (with 
which McLellan and Dewey may not agree), for the beginner 
the unit of reference should be fixed at one, a single thing. 
Let us say, then, that provisionally and for the sake of 
simplicity a fraction is one or more of the equal parts of 
a single thing. What is three-fourths? It is three of the four 
j 
i 
i | }
-P-A-G-E-115
  
Psychological Studies 103 
equal parts into which a single thing is divided. Nothing is now 
said about the ratio of three-fourths to one-fourth, but every 
time the child generates this fraction from his (single) thing (pie, 
apple, disk, what-not), he multiplies one-fourth by three, and so 
the ratio idea is implied constantly in such manipulation, and, 
we may hope, will come to consciousness in due time in an explicit 
way. We must respectfully submit, also, that the pie is a better 
object to work with at this stage than the foot-rule (McLellan 
and Dewey object to much work with the pie on the ground 
that it is not a measured whole and therefore not a quan- 
titative unity). If we may be allowed to be slightly facetious 
at this point (when life is so serious) we may say that the pie 
possesses more intrinsic interest for the child than the foot-rule. 
(I know of no experimental studies on this point, but observation 
seems to confirm it.) It is possible, of course, to make the foot- 
tule of interest, even painfully so, but this interest, all will 
probably agree, is apt to be negative rather than positive. 
Seriously speaking, it is a matter of common experience that 
disk-like (and spherical) objects bring out the fractional idea 
(relation of part to whole) better than linear objects. 
The pupil, once having derived parts by breaking up wholes, 
can readily be led to regard the parts as individual things and to 
operate upon them with about as much ease as upon integers. 
But hold! The philosophers say we must not do this. Says 
Dr. Harris (Editor’s Preface, McLellan and Dewey’s The Psy- 
chology of Number, p. vii), “The methods in vogue in elemen- 
tary schools are chiefly based on the idea that it is necessary 
to eliminate the ratio idea by changing one of the terms of the 
fraction to a qualitative unit and by this to change the thought 
to that of simple number.”’ The inference from this is that 
they would have us present the ratio idea explicitly from the 
beginning. This procedure would certainly require in pupils a 
“high consciousness of the nature of quantity.” “Hence,” says
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  104, Pedagogy of Arithmetic — 
| 
Dr. Harris, “the difficulty of teaching this subject in the elemen- 
tary school.” We should say so! | 
It seems clear, moreover, that the procedure according to 
“methods in vogue” does not necessarily “eliminate the ratio 
idea,” but rather allows it to remain in abeyance for the time 
being. To the fruitfulness, for simplicity and clearness, of the 
prevailing procedure every school man will testify; and this 
applies to the common distinction between the proper and 
the improper fraction, which McLellan and Dewey char- 
acterize as a “mystery,” since from an advanced view 
point all fractions are proper. But our contention is 
that the view point of the beginner is and should be that 
the fraction is one or more of the equal parts of a single 
thing. Hence, it is logically improper to unqualifiedly call $ a 
fraction since it does not conform to the definition. In the light 
of a deeper insight gained from the later expansion of his concept, 
all fractions will become quite “proper’’ and all hands will be 
satisfied. This sort of thing is continually happening in the men- 
tal history of all of us. Things that have seemed “improper” to us 
in the half light of partial truth became “‘proper” in the greater 
illumination of profounder understanding. Witness the changing 
attitude of Methodists toward card playing. Even the so-called 
fixed-unit “fallacy” is not so much a fallacy as a half-way station 
on the road to completer truth. 
In conclusion, we may agree with the following: “The primary 
step in the explicit (italics mine) teaching of fractions—that is, 
in making the habit of fractioning already formed [in whole 
numbers (and I may now perhaps be permitted to add in earlier 
work in fractions)] an object of analytical attention—is to make 
perfectly definite the child’s acquaintance with certain standard 
measures, their subdivisions and relations. In all fractions— 
because in all exact measurement—there must be a definite 
unit of measure. This implies two things: (a) The definition of a
-P-A-G-E-117
  
Psychological Studies 105 
standard of reference (the primary unit) in terms of its own unit 
of measure; (b) the measurement of the given quantity by means 
of this derived unit. If the foot is a unit of measure, it is unmean- 
ing in itself; it must be mastered, must be given significance by 
relating it to other units in the scale of length; it is 1 yard + 3 
in one direction; or (taking the usual divisions of the scale) it is 
(43 i. e., zy x 12) in the other direction, i. e., as measured in 
inches. The [explicit] teaching of fractions, then, should be based 
on the ordinary standard scales of measurement; on the 
fundamental process of parting and wholing in measure- 
ment, and not upon the qualitative parts of an undefined 
unity” (32, p. 142). 
The doctrine of the book may be summed up briefly as 
follows: 
1. Number is psychical in its nature. Sense facts may be 
attended to without giving the idea of number. Objects aid the 
mind in its work of constructing numerical ideas, but the 
objects are not number. No clearly defined numerical ideas 
can enter into consciousness till the mind orders the objects, 
that is, compares them and relates them in a certain way. 
2. Number is the ratio of a measured quantity to a unit of 
measurement. 
3. Hence the methods of arithmetic should be largely meth- 
ods of measurement. i 
Moreover, there is a certain order of growth in complexity 
and demand upon conscious attention. This order, upon the 
whole, is addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. This 
order may be correlated to the ripening instincts and interests 
of the growing child. The purpose and means of instruction 
will be determined on the one hand by the nature of number 
and on the other by the nature of the child,
-P-A-G-E-118
  
  106 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
(d) Reasoning. 
The important thing for the teacher to know in connection with 
problematic work in arithmetic is that the reasoning involved is 
deductive in its nature, and syllogistic in form when the argument 
is explicitly stated. The laws of deductive reasoning, as everyone 
knows, have come down to us from Aristotle; no essential con- 
tribution to this aspect of thinking has been Weide by any subse- 
quent logician. It is not to be expected, therefore, that psycho- 
logical studies of children’s (or of adults’) thinking processes will 
reveal new laws of thinking; they can reveal only how minds 
function (or fail to function) in well established modes. In short, 
they will be studies in efficiency providing data for psychology and 
ot psychological per se. No systematic objective study of 
reasoning calculated to give psychological insight has, so far as 
I know, as yet been made. A careful analysis and classification of 
children’s mistakes in problematic arithmetic with a view to dis- 
covering wherein the fault usually lies, whether in failure to recog- 
nize the major premise or to distribute the middle term or to infer 
the concluding judgment, would, it seems to me, be one method of 
attack. Necessary presuppositions to such experimentation 
would be: (a) ability of the child to get thought from the printed 
page, (b) experiences by the child of situations like or similar to 
those presented in the problem. It might be supposed (and has 
been supposed) that, given these apperceptive data, success in 
reasoning is for the most part assured. Teachers, however, find 
that such is not the fact. They call failure in such cases lack of 
“sumption.” Psychologists give it a higher sounding name. 
Whatever we call it, it would be interesting and important to 
know specifically at what point in the process lack of “gumption”’ 
enters in and whether it is a lack of native ability or of “concept 
of method” (in which case it can be remedied by training). | 
Sci Observation of children and a few experiments seem to show B 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
Psychological Studies 107 
   
                  
   
      
            
          
   
   that native ability is a larger factor in this phase of arithmetic 
than in any other and that therefore it is less susceptible to 
improvement through training. Bonser (34) found (1910) in his 
experiments on the reasoning ability of fourth, fifth and sixth year 
children that the mathematical judgment of the younger children 
in many instances surpassed that of the older ones. “Children 
with 3 to 5 years of experience and training more than a corre- 
sponding number of other children frequently do not do so well as 
the group of fewer years and less experience but with greater 
ability by nature” (34, page 33). 
Thorndike (48) found instances of the rarity of this sagacity 
in an unexpected quarter. He says, after testing 40 adults (all 
school teachers and many of them college graduates) on problems, 
that the vast majority use no arithmetical analysis or reasoning. 
An interesting side-light is thrown on the question of why children 
fail in this as in other subjects of school study by Dr. Radosavl- 
jevich’s discussion (78) of apperception. He shows by implica- 
tion that the child may assimilate a situation without passing on 
to complete apperception of it; lack of sagacity, we may say, pre- 
vents him from apperceiving the relation of the particular ques- 
tion to the general principle involved. The studies of Courtis 
how incidentally that the introduction of unconventional lan- 
uage and of irrelevant numbers upset completely those children 
ho sometimes simulate reasoning through their memory of typi- 
al problems and solutions as ordinarily presented in the arith- 
etics or by their teachers. 
We have said that arithmetical reasoning is deductive. That 
his is so will appear from a statement of the steps involved in the 
olution of a problem. ‘“‘First, the analysis of the situation by 
hich the essential features of the problems are conceived and 
bstracted; second, the recall of an appropriate principle to be 
pplied to the abstracted problem, a search among various prin- 
iples which may suggest themselves for the right one; and third,  
-P-A-G-E-120
108 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
involved in the second, the inference, the recognition of the iden- 
tity between the known principle and the new situation. 
Clearly these are examples of deductive reasoning of the usual 
scientific type involving data, principles, and inferences” (34, 
pera)! 
Take for example the problem: 
If 3 hats cost $12, what will 1 hat cost? 
Major premise: 1 hat cost 3 the cost of 3 hats; 
Minor premise: 3 hats cost $12; 
Conclusion: 1 hat costs 4 of $12. 
The first step described above gives the minor premise, the 
second the major premise, the third the conclusion. The crux of 
the child’s attack would seem to be the second step or the estab- 
lishment of the major premise. It is not absolutely certain that 
once this is determined the rest would follow, but it is certain that 
the process cannot go on without it. 
The following are typical examples of failure to resolve prob- 
lems not, we will assume, through inability to get thought from 
print or through lack of familiarity with the situation, but through 
inability from one cause or another, to establish a correct major 
premise. 
If three men fall nine feet, how far does one man fall? 
Major premise (false): One man falls 3 of the distance of 
three men; 
Minor premise: Three men fall 9 feet; 
Conclusion: One man falls § of 9 feet.   A dog standing on 1 leg weighs 15 pounds, how much will he 
weigh standing on 4 legs? 
Major premise (false): A dog standing on 4 legs weighs four 
times as much as a dog standing on 1 leg; 
Minor premise: A dog standing on 1 leg weighs 15 pounds; 
Conclusion: A dog standing on 4 legs weighs 4 times 15 pounds,
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Psychological Studies 109 
The cause of failure to grasp the major premise may be either 
lack of native ability (sagacity, power to completely apperceive the 
situation) or lack of a “concept of method.” In so far as it may be 
the latter, it is a matter that can be remedied through training. To 
anticipate what has been said in another connection (p. 145): “It is 
undoubtedly true that much practice in seeking and applying the 
major premise, without which little success can be hoped for, can 
be given in the problematical portions of arithmetic and the habit 
thus formed can be carried over.” “It is not meant that any 
such formal, logical statement as that set forth above shall be 
used, but rather simple direct means for getting at the heart of 
the matter from the start, from which point forward the child 
must be given the chance to work out his own salvation” (p. 146). 
The validity of the conclusion in syllogistic reasoning, assuming 
that no fallacies enter the course of the argument, depends on the 
truth of the major premise. This, as everyone knows, is estab- 
lished inductively (usually). And so the child must be led to 
establish his major premise in at least a quasi-inductive way by a 
study of cases. For example, in the first syllogism cited the relation 
of one hat to three hats (and therefore of the cost of one hat to the 
cost of three hats) is originally established by showing concretely 
that if three hats are separated into three equal groups (which is 
what we mean by finding one-third of three) there will be one hat 
in each group. Similarly-the falsity of the major premise in the 
second syllogism cited is easily discovered by attention to a con- 
crete case. 
The suggestions of Professor Suzallo (33) are of psychological 
significance in this connection as they provide a plan of proceeding 
from simple (one-step) to the more complicated (two-step) prob- 
lems and of making sure that the child gets training in modes of 
attack, with reference to the different types that may occur, in 
pedagogical order. 
Tn one-step reasoning there are four types, one for each of the  
-P-A-G-E-122
  
TIO Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
fundamental processes. It is not necessary, however, to exhaust | 
these before proceeding to two-step reasoning. In the latter 
the four fundamental steps can be combined in sixteen different 
ways. Even in the same problem one-step reasoning can some- 
times be combined into two-step in more than one way.    
      
   
    
   
    
       Example: A hardware merchant had 14 crowbars in stock. 
He sold 5 on Wednesday and 4 on Thursday. How many 
remained? 
Solution tr. 14—5 = 9; 9 —4 = 5 (Two subtraction steps) 
Solution 2. 5+ 4 = 9; 14—9= 5 (Addition and subtrac- 
tion) 
It is suggested by Professor Suzallo that in the primary grades 
typical problems be taught involving operations in the following 
order, to be followed by miscellaneous examples: 
r+ 6.—+ mam. X + 16. X —

“The idea of inclusion, togetherness, separateness, left-over- 
ness, etc., should be presented in many varying situations so that 
the process is associated with the essential and not the accidental 
part of the situation.” 
In the process work of arithmetic the procedure is sometime 
quasi-inductive, sometimes deductive. 
For example, 4 of 4. 
The first step, } of 4, is established by concrete (objective) 
work. Then the procedure becomes deductive. 
Major premise: }4 of 4 = 4 X (§ of 2); 
Minor premise: 4 of } = 7s;

If it is desired to establish a rule for the multiplication of a 
fraction by a fraction, the pupil is led to observe that the product 
i's can be obtained by multiplying the numerators together for 
the numerator of the product and the denominators together 
for the denominator of the product (a quasi-induction). The 
application of the rule to further examples is deduction. 
It is to be noted that in the strict sense of the word there is no 
inductive reasoning in arithmetic. Concrete examples there are 
leading to a rule or principle, but the rule or principle when 
reached is an absolute certainty, not a more or less probable 
hypothesis awaiting verification. One example is sufficient to 
establish the principle; a hundred more cannot make it more 
certain; the only reason we multiply examples is the pedagogical 
lone of emphasis and repetition for the sake of clearness and has no 
ogical significance.

  3. STATISTICAL STUDIES. 
(a) Efficiency. 
Psychological studies of the number consciousness, such as have 
been reviewed on the preceding pages, are important to pedagogy 
chiefly as contributions to theory. As contributions to theory, 
they are also, of course, contributions to practice, since all good 
practice must have sound theory back of it, whether the theory be 
consciously formulated or not. Presumably the procedure in our 
present day schools is an endeavor to put into practice what is 
known, or thought to be known, of educational psychology. The 
"attempt in the past has been to train teachers in psychology and 
methods based upon it; and teachers and schools have been rated 
largely upon the orthodoxy of their procedure from this point of 
view, regardless of measured or measurable results. 
It has been only within the last decade that the idea has come 
to full consciousness among leaders in educational thought that 
no amount of so-thought orthodoxy of methods on the part of 
the teachers can atone for lack of efficiency on the part of the pu- 
pil; in short, that no teaching is good teaching that fails to produce 
measurable results. ‘ 
Efficiency tests to discover what is actually being accomplished 
as the schools are at present conducted, are a desirable antidote 
and supplement to theoretical conclusions as to what ought to be 
accomplished, as well as a source of information to pedagogues in 
many practical directions. Such experimental tests, also, while! 
not psychological per se, are calculated to furnish a vast fund of 
data awaiting a psychological interpretation which shall place 
them upon a scientific basis; so the pendulum may swing from|

theory to practice to theory to practice, each movement serving 
to bring us closer to a realization of the dream of a predictive. 
pedagogy. 
Dr. J. M. Rice (47), 1902, made the pioneer investigation 
on arithmetical abilities, his main thesis being the enforce- 
ment of the idea that schools and teachers must be judged by 
results; and, incidentally, the discovery of the factors determining 
the widely varying abilities found from school to school. He 
tested children in seventeen schools in seven cities. He concludes 
that the controlling factors in the successful schools are the 
establishment of standards and regular testing for results. He 
eliminates as factors, that might be supposed to control, the fol- 
lowing: (1) Home environment, (2) size of classes, (3) age of 
pupils, (4) time of day, (5) time devoted to arithmetic, (6) home 
work, (7) method of teaching, (8) teaching ability, (9) course of 
study, (10) superintendent’s training of teachers. 
The elimination of some of these factors is surprising and must 
be regarded as exceedingly doubtful until later investigation 
confirms or rejects the conclusion. It may, perhaps, be said that 
(4),(5), and (6) are now experimentally confirmed. 
Dr. Rice’s study is open to the criticism of lack of rigor and 
completeness in his statistical methods and (so far as one can 
determine) of lack of uniformity of conditions. Such criticism, of 
course, is easy at this distance and is in no way derogatory to the 
value and acuteness of his pioneer effort. Its value in general lies 
in the stimulus given to similar studies and the impulse given 
to the shifting of the point of view in regard to the manner of judg- 
ling the efficiency of teacher and school. 
C. W. Stone (46), 1908, under conditions as nearly uniform as 
possible and with approved statistical methods, made an ex- 
tended investigation of the arithmetical abilities of children of 
the upper 6th grade. He drew his materials from 26 school sys- 
tems, ranging from Massachusetts to Illinois, and he personally
-P-A-G-E-126

114 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
conducted the tests in each of the 152 class-rooms, securing over 
6,000 test papers. In addition, he collected data as to the time 
spent on arithmetic by these pupils both in and out of school, in 
each of the grades from one to six. Finally, he obtained the course 
of study from each of the 26 systems, and had these arranged by 
competent judges in order of excellence. Two test papers were 
used with each pupil, one for the fundamental arithmetical 
operations, the other for arithmetical reasoning. The paper in 
fundamentals contains 14 test problems, those from 1 to 9 were 
arranged in order of increasing difficulty, the time allowed was 
12 minutes, and the results were scored on the basis of 1 for each 
step of each problem. The paper in reasoning presented 12 prob- 
lems of increasing difficulty, the time allowed was 15 minutes, and, 
on the basis of preliminary experiments, the results were scored 
from 1 to 2 for each problem. In the comparison of systems the 
scores of roo pupils from each system were taken at random and 
combined. The following are some of the more important results: 
1. The scores for the 26 systems vary in fundamentals from 
1841 to 4099 and in reasoning from 356 to gt4. The same system 
often occupies a decidedly different rank in fundamentals from 
that held in reasoning. 
2. Comparing the scores of all systems, the correlation of 
reasoning with the average of the fundamentals is quite low (.40), 
—it is lowest with addition (.32), and highest with subtraction! 
(.50). The correlation of the different fundamentals with each| 
other is very high (.g0 to .95). 
3. An examination of the individual scores of 500 pupils chosen] 
" at random from 4 systems shows a wide variability, ranging fro’ 
3 to 63 in fundamentals, and from o to 15.2 in reasoning. With 
median of 6 in the latter, 33 pupils score only 2 or less. The boy: 
are no more variable than the girls. 
4. In the individual scores reasoning shows a still lower corre. 
lation with fundamentals (.32) than in systems, and the correla

tion is lowest with addition (.28) and highest with division (.36). 
Addition shows a much lower correlation with the other funda- 
mentals (.50 to .65) than these do with each other .89 to .95. 
5. In general it would seem that division is most like reasoning, 
subtraction comes next, multiplication is a close third, and addi- 
tion is farthest removed. Moreover, ability in addition is the 
least guarantee of ability in other fundamentals. 
6. It is inadmissible to speak of arithmetical ability as a single 
function,—rather we have to do with a number of abilities or 
products, and there is less connection between arithmetical rea- 
soning and ability in the fundamental operations than between 
English and geography. 
7. Supervision by the superintendent or a special supervisor 
does not seem to be a potent factor in developing arithmetical 
apilities. 
8. The total time devoted to arithmetic in the first six grades 
varies in the different systems from 7% to 22% of the total school 
time, yet an elaborate comparison of time expenditure with 
accomplishment indicates that difference in time plays an almost 
negligible rdle. More important factors are the distribution of 
time among the grades and the use of time within a grade. In 
any systems there is a deplorable waste of time. 
g. The correlation of excellence of the course of study, as rated 
y the judges with arithmetical reasoning (.56) is much higher 
han with fundamentals (.13). Future improvement in the 
ourse of study lies in the direction of indicating the place of drill 
n the educative process.

who has published his results in volumes X, XI, XII, of the Ele- 
mentary School Teacher, Chicago (42), and finally, on the basis 
of these results, has devised a series of standard tests, with a 
manual of directions, in such form that they may be readily and 
fruitfully used by any teacher or principal for the quantitative 
determination of efficiency and growth. 
From the beginning of his experimental work (1909) the pur- 
pose of Mr. Courtis was to establish standards from which to 
measure the success or the failure of work in arithmetic and to 
trace the development of ability through the several grades. 
The work of Stone had shown that arithmetical ability, so-called, 
is not a single ability but a complex of abilities existing in varying 
conditions of relation or non-relation with one another in the 
same individual, as well as in classes and school systems. 
Courtis’s experiments present this fact even more strikingly, as he 
covers the broader field of all the elementary grades (except the 
very lowest) and of the high school grades, and show furthermore, 
that classes and individuals as they go up the grades are not, as 
things exist, harmoniously progressing in the several abilities but 
present bewildering differences in rate and quality of improve- 
ment. Making due allowances for differences in native capacity, 
which, of course, cannot be overcome, these variations in objec-+ 
tive efficiency present a problem the solution of which will appea 
to every school man. If intelligent and efficient work is to be don 
by teachers they must know (a) how their classes and its member 
stand relatively to the established norms of any ability, (b) wha 
to do in the way of drill or other exercise to remedy deficiencies 
as a corollary, what to refrain from doing with children or classe: 
having reached a desirable (not always the maximum) rank 
The second of these questions is going to require continued experi 
mental work with drills and exercises different as to kind, duratio 
and times of application, with uniform tests before and after, s 
that, after a while, data may be secured upon which recommenda

tions as to procedure may be based with some confidence. Mean- 
while, by the use of the Courtis tests, the condition of classes and 
pupils may be diagnosed, the teacher may proceed according to 
the light that exists to remedy defects, and, by means of a second 
test, uniform with the first, discover the measure of her success. 
It is my purpose to illustrate the character and the application 
of these tests, so far as diagnosis is concerned, by an account of 
the tests as given by me in a city school, rather than by a digest 
of the experiments of Courtis in his own school. Space does not 
permit going into the details of the gradual elaboration of the tests 
into their present form with measurably equal units of work and 
standard scores. Recourse may be had to the original articles 
(42, 43) by those who are curious in regard to the historical aspect 
of the matter. As an introduction, however, to the account of 
work with our own children (see p. 261 ff) we must refer briefly 
to some of Courtis’s results. 
The points deduced from Stone’s investigation that chiefly 
attracted the attention of Courtis were: (a) that taking the effi- 
ciency of the school making the highest score in fundamentals as 
100%, the efficiency represented by the median score was 76%, 
that of the lowest score 45%; (b) that in reasoning the median 
score represented an efficiency of 60%, the lowest an efficiency of 
39%; (¢) that the per cent. of school time given to arithmetic 
varied from 7 to 23% and high ability appeared more commonly 
with the small rather than with the great expenditure of time. 
These facts seemed to demand further investigation to locate 
more specifically if possible the critical points that give rise to 
these variations and ultimately to devise ways measurably to 
remove them. For this purpose Courtis used Stone’s tests at first, 
giving them to every grade from the 3rd to the 13th; this could be 
done as parts of the test were within the abilities of 3rd grade chil- 
dren, while the length of the tests was sufficient to occupy the 13th 
grade children during the time given; later Courtis devised  
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
tentative tests of his own, viz., speed tests in the fundamental - 
tables (time 13 min.), a speed test in one-step reasoning, process 
to be indicated without numerical work (time 2 min.), a test in 
fundamentals similar to that of Stone (time 10 min.), a test in 
problem-work (time 8 min.), and a test in copying figures (time 
1min.).! The same tests being given to all the grades under uni- 
form conditions, the comparative scores made became a measure 
of the development of abilities through the several grades. 
Courtis soon adopted the method of scoring simply by examples as 
right or wrong, as this was found to be as satisfactory for compara- 
tive purposes as any more elaborate scheme. 
Some classes were found to have high ability in both funda- 
mentals and reasoning or to have low in both, others high in one 
and low in the other. This suggested that the truest measure of 
abilities of the grades is a combination score from both tests. 
The combination scores were found to decrease the marked vari- 
ations in ability present in the scores for either test alone. “The 
meaning of this,” says Courtis (42a, p. 73), “is not apparent. 
It has been a puzzling fact of my teaching experience that ability 
to reason and ability to be exact in abstract work seldom go 
together. I am inclined to believe that there is a psychological 
principle at work which, if known, would solve more riddles than 
one in educational procedure.” Accuracy was found gradually 
to decrease through the grammar grades and to increase through 
the high school grades at about the same rate. “Tf this result is 
confirmed by future tests there is an important lesson here. If 
inaccuracy in grammar grades is due to some natural cause out- 
side of arithmetic proper, to insist on accuracy or to spend much 
time working for it may be not only wasteful but harmful” 
(42a, p. 74). Accuracy in tabular operations does not insure 
1 These tests were of the same general character as the more recent ones described 
on pp. 252-260 (q. v.), but the units of work as equalities had not yet been 
worked out.

   equivalent efficiency in working examples involving these oper- 
ations. As a matter of fact, the result of the test (in the Detroit 
school) of the 13th grade showed that 93% class accuracy in the 
tables meant 83% in examples. In individuals the difference is 
still more striking. In a personal conference with Mr. Courtis, 
he exhibited some data not yet published, from which it would be 
a fair but rather startling inference that the correlations between 
knowledge of the tables and accuracy in fundamental examples is 
very slight; that, in very truth, some individuals, for instance, 
work examples in multiplication seemingly without knowing their 
tables, while, on the other hand, some fail on the examples who 
are excellent in tables. Such facts as these are calculated to make 
us humbly acknowledge our almost total ignorance of the working 
of children’s minds in such particulars. Again, as showing the 
variability within the grades and from grade to grade, it was found 
that the 5th grade, for example, was strong on multiplication and 
division and weak in addition, the oth grade strong in addition 
and weak in multiplication and division, etc. Because a class 
does well in addition it will not necessarily do well in any other 
operation, not even subtraction. Such results have some bearing 
on the question of transfer. ‘If skill in addition does not influence 
skill in subtraction, it would seem that there could be little hope of 
transfer to any other subject” (42a, p. 179). 
“The results [of a study of the relative difficulty of the four 
operations] make it probable that accuracy of work is a function 
lof the development of the child and in a way independent of his 
arithmetical training. Each grade seems to have a certain general 
degree of accuracy, which after the early years of learning does not 
seem to increase as one would expect. Within the limits of the 
accuracy of a class, all combinations of accuracies in the different 
operations are found. Addition is found to be the hardest, multi- 
lication or division least difficult. . . . It seems practi- 
ally certain that in the present state of our arithmetical teaching
-P-A-G-E-132
  
      
     
    
                     
   
       
   
   
       120 Pedagogy of Arithmetic | 
each operation and each part or division of a topic is learned by 
the child as a separate unrelated activity” (42a, p. 180). 
The mistakes made in the fundamental examples and in prob- 
lems were analyzed and the mistakes made in copying and in 
carrying (attention and memory) were separated from the others 
to see how far such mistakes influence accuracy. It was found 
that of those making the mistakes at any given time in a class 
at least one-third and usually two-thirds will be making mistakes 
in copying and carrying. The mere introduction of carrying into 
multiplication examples caused an increase of 30% in the number 
of examples missed. The effect was least in subtraction; most of 
the classes actually solve the more difficult examples involving 
carrying more accurately than the simpler ones without it. The 
explanation is offered that “‘borrowing in subtraction becomes so 
habitual because most of the school work demands it that the 
habit persists in those cases in which no borrowing is necessary” 
(42c, p. 363). The effect in addition was apparently midway 
between that in subtraction and in multiplication and division. 
This ability is therefore judged to be a factor of sufficient im- 
portance to receive direct classroom attention. 
A general study of the distribution of ability in the grades dis- 
covered a very irregular distribution after the 5th grade; in the 
early grades the classes were units, but as pupils pass from grade to 
grade, individuals react to training in different ways so that the 
unity is broken up. The composition of grade 12, according to 
combined scores in fundamentals and reasoning, expressed in 
terms of the average performance of members of the other grades 
was found to be as follows: 
(Note.—At this time no norm had been established for the sev- 
eral grades. Since then Courtis has worked out norms based| 
on tests of about 9,000 children; the work of confirming or revisin, 
these standards is still being carried on by him with the coépera: 
tion of many superintendents, principals and teachers.)

1 member of 3rd grade ability; 
7 members of 4th grade ability; 
12 members of sth grade ability; 
3 members of 6th grade ability; 
1 member of 12th grade ability; 
1 member of 13th grade ability; 
7 members of about 13th grade ability. 
Thus over one-half the class was found of less ability than the 
average ability of the 6th grade.

pages 252-299. 
(b) Ideation. 
Can individual children be classed as visual-minded, auditory- 
minded, etc., and their type be observationally or experimentally 
determined? If so, what is the relation of the several types to 
the learning and reproduction of numbers? 
The studies of these questions have been few and the results 
tentative. F.W. Smedley made a pioneer investigation which he 
published (rg900) in the Report of the Department of Child Study, 
Board of Education, Chicago. This is interesting and suggestive 
but lacks scientific value on account of undeveloped statistical 
methods. Of more value is W. A. Lay’s Anschauungs und 
Gedachtnistypen, Weisbaden, 1903. Lay reaches the following 
conclusions: 
1. There are no ideational types in the sense that an indi- 
vidual will think entirely in a visual or auditory or motor way, 
but we can name types visual, auditory or motor, meaning by 
it that this particular kind of imagery seems to give best results 
in apprehension and recall. 
2. The mixed type comprises a whole series of subordinate 
types and variations.  
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
3. It does not follow that a child belonging to one type in 
language reproduction must necessarily belong to the same type 
as far as arithmetic is concerned. (Lay 
this important fact.) 
M. W. Meyerhardt (37) found (1906)

ery of the several minds and adopt varying modes of presentation 
in accordance with the results obtained. 
Eckhardt’s investigation cannot be regarded seriously since 
results based upon the introspection of children must on a priori 
grounds appear to be exceedingly doubtful. It has later been 
shown by Springer (35) that children’s statements about the 
character of their imagery are entirely untrustworthy 
The latest and most systematic investigation of this subject is 
that by I. Springer (35) in his Mental Reproductive Types in 
Arithmetic, 1911. 
The purpose of the experiments was to discover whether there 
are distinct ideational types in arithmetic, the relation of these 
types to immediate memory of numbers and the distribution and 
development of these types in the grades. Experiments were 
made on about 500 children of the male sex in each grade from the 
first to the eighth. 
Series of numbers of varying lengths were presented to the 
children by each of four modes of presentation, viz., auditory, 
auditory-motor, visual, visual-motor. The purpose of giving 
series of different lengths was to determine (r) the effect of length 
of the series upon immediate memory, (2) to ascertain what form 
of presentation gave best results with the longer series, (3) to com- 
pare the best results in each of the series given. I give below the 
several series of numbers used in the visual presentation which 
will serve as a sample of those used in the other presentations. 
(The numbers were changed for each kind of presentation but the 
length of the several series remained respectively the same.) 
It will be seen from the tabulation that the 2-number series 
was presented to the rst and 2d grades, the 3-number series to 
the 1st and 2d grades, a 4-number series to the st, 2d, 3d 
and 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grades, a 5-number series to the 3d 
and 4th grades, a 6-number series to the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th 
and 8th grades, and a 1o-number series to the 5th, 6th, 7th and  
-P-A-G-E-136
  8th grades. It was thus made possible to compare the grades in 
each kind of presentation on the basis of length of series and this 
was done with reference to 4, 6 and 1o-number series; that is to

say, 4 numbers, grades 1 to 8; 6 numbers, grades 3 to 8; 10 num- 
bers, grades 5 to 8. 
Preliminary experiments were used to fix upon numbers in the 
several series that should not be too easy or too hard. Two sec- 
onds was the time given to the presentation of each number.
-P-A-G-E-137
  Statistical Studies 125 
Auditory Presentation.—The teacher read once the series and 
at a signal the children were required to write the numbers they 
remembered. 
Auditory-motor Presentation—The teacher read the three 
series as before and after each number the class repeated the num- 
ber aloud. At the completion of a series the children wrote the ‘ 
numbers they remembered. 
Visual Presentation.—Each number in the several series was 
presented to sight and at the end of each series the children wrote. 
Visual-motor Presentation.—Each number was exposed on the 
blackboard and the class repeated the number aloud. When the 
series was completed it was covered and the children wrote. Two 
seconds was allowed for repeating a number. 
The results were worked out under three rubrics: 
1. Immediate memory for numbers. 
A. Relation of different modes of presentation to immedi- 
ate memory of numbers. 
Here the three series were combined for each grade in each 
kind of presentation and the following conclusions reached: 
(a) The immediate memory for numbers increases with 
the grade and age of school children. 
(b) Visual motor presentation gives the best results in 
all the grades except the first and fifth. In the first grade 
auditory is zy better than visual-motor; in the fifth grade 
visual is superior by 3‘y. 
(c) In general we can make the hypothesis that the 
child upon entering school and during the first grade will 
give best results by an auditory presentation, but from 
second to eighth grades it will give best results by the 
visual-motor presentation. 5 
B. Effect of length of series on immediate memory (and

tion). Here the 4-number series was given by each kind of 
presentation in grades r to 8; 6-number in grades 3 to 8; and 
zo-number in grades 5 to 8. 
The conclusions reached were as follows: 
(a) Length of series is a great factor in immediate 
memory. , 
(b) Immediate memory for long series seems to be best 
in 5th and 6th years. 
(c) Visual-motor presentation is superior to all other 
forms in the 6th, 7th and 8th year and inferior only to the 
visual presentation in the 5th grade. 
(d) Best results in early ages are obtained from auditory 
presentation, in later years from visual and visual-motor 
presentation. 
(e) Auditory presentation gives very poor results 
throughout the grades, showing that loud speech move- 
ments are a hindrance instead of a help. 
2. Relation of the reproductive results of the several methods 
of presentation to intelligence. 
The teachers of the children classified them as bright, aver- 
age, and dull with special reference to work in arithmetic. 
The scores of the three classes of children in immediate mem- 
ory of 4-number, 6-number and 1o-number series were com- 
pared with respect to effect of length of series and of mode of 
presentation. The following conclusions were reached: 
(a) All three classes of children (bright, average, dull) 
obtain the best results in the visual-motor presentation. 
Hence visual-motor presentation is a help to immediate 
memory of numbers regardless of length of series. 
(b) Auditory-minded pupils of all classes find the addition 
of the motor element a hindrance instead of a help.
-P-A-G-E-139
  Statistical Studies 127 
(c) Bright pupils obtain better results from the visual and 
visual-motor presentation than from auditory or auditory- 
motor presentations. 
3. The determination of ideational types and their distribu- 
tion throughout the grades. Are there distinct types of number 
imagery? 
The objective method used by Springer, which undoubtedly 
has greater validity than the introspective method of Eckhardt, 
was to tabulate the results in each of the various forms of 
presentation and assume that the child belongs to the type in 
which he had secured the best results. The table below shows 
the results in each grade of each mode of presentation expressed 
in terms of the per cent. of the number of pupils in the grade:

Nearly one-half (44%) of the children of the first grade are 
auditory, but in the second grade the number decreases to 12%, 
and in the third grade to 5%. The auditory-motor type is practi- 
cally negligible in all the grades though fairly prevalent in the 
first and second. The visual-motor predominates in four of the 
eight grades and is a strong factor in the others. Springer con- 
cludes further: 
1. The vast majority are of the mixed type. There are no 
types in number imagery in the sense that children think 
exclusively in one kind of imagery. In this he agrees with W. A. 
Lay, cited above. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
2. Although most of the children are of the mixed type, yet 
certain methods of presentation will produce better results than — 
certain other methods. We can therefore classify children into 
the four types according to their results. 
An interesting question which arises in connection with idea- 
tional types is, are they due to heredity or training? 
Meumann in discussing this question says: ‘Ideational types 
can be explained as the result of four possibilities: (a) They are 
determined by heredity alone and, if such be the case, then train- 
ing and practice have no effect and whatever type the child is 
endowed with must remain unchanged. (b) They are to some 
degree predisposed by heredity and are subject to change, but the 
influence of training and practice is less than that of heredity. 
(c) They depend upon heredity and training but the influence of 
training is greater than that of heredity. (d) Heredity is of no 
account in determining ideational types, training being the sole 
factor” (Okonomie und Technik des Gediichtnisses, 1908, p. 166, 
quoted by Springer, p. 118). 
Meumann maintains that though instruction may have some 
influence yet the factor of heredity is more important. Springer 
on the basis of his results disagrees with this. He ascribes the 
drop in audiles from 44% in the first grade to 12% and 5% in the 
second and third grades respectively to the fact that upon careful 
examination of the methods of instruction in these grades he found 
that in the second and third grades teaching of arithmetic was 
’ mainly written, in the first grade mainly oral. 
Springer closes his thesis (p. 139 ff.) with an interesting com- 
mentary, substantially as follows: 
The investigation suggests one cause for retardation. A 
teacher of the auditory type, say, may have a class 75% of another 
type, say visual or visual-motor. He fails to reach them. A care- 
ful investigation of retarded pupils will no doubt show that there 
are many children in our schools who have failed to comprehend

   instruction and who have not succeeded in keeping up with their 
grade because the mental type of imagery was not understood, 
recognized and taken into account by the teacher in the presenta- 
tion of the subject matter of the curriculum. 
In the group system at present pupils are classified according to : 
their brightness or dullness in certain subjects. It seems that a 
better and more scientific classification might be secured by tak- 
ing account of the varying mental types. 
Bright children, especially, found the auditory or auditory- 
motor presentation a decided hindrance to the acquisition of 
knowledge. It was also discovered that for children who are of 
the auditory type the addition of the motor clement not only is 
not an assistance but actually hampers the pupil in his intellectual 
operations. Hence if we carry out our maxim “Appeal to all the 
senses possible” we shall find that instead of assisting the children 
we are actually hindering some of them, though with others the 
addition of the motor element of writing or pronouncing may be a 
elp. Discrimination must be used. I have only to add that 
hile it has been found that ordinary mortals are of the mixed 
ype of mental imagery, extraordinary individuals, if we may 
judge from our study of prodigies, are of an extremely pure type. 
Pheir one-sidedness is thus partially accounted for. Compare 
pspecially P. Diamandi and J. Inaudi with F. D. Mitchell in our 
ccount of prodigies (pp. 35, 36).   (c) Transfer. 
It is difficult to escape the conclusion from the investigations 
f Stone, Courtis and others that arithmetical ability is not a 
eneral one but is a complex of abilities made up of specific abili- 
lies among which a low degree of correlation exists. In other 
ords, there is no guarantee that a high degree of attainment in 
ne branch of the subject implies a high degree in another branch
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
or in the subject as a whole. Pupils who do good work in funda- 
mentals are found to do poor work in reasoning and vice versa; 
and a similar variability is found among the fundamental proc- 
esses themselves. The question arises, then, do the effects of prac- 
tice in a particular subject matter transfer at all to other subject 
matter? If so, to what extent and under what conditions? ‘This 
is the objective statement of the question. Stated more broadly 
and in its subjective aspect, it may be worded as follows: Does 
not the repeated functioning of the mind as perception, memory, 
imagination, thought, etc., on a given content so train these 
powers that an ability will be gained to function indifferently on 
any content, however dissimilar? Those who answer this ques- 
tion affirmatively are the adherents of the doctrine of formal 
discipline, which, in its traditional form, seems to maintain that 
the several “faculties” are kinds of abstract forms or modes, which 
are developed from certain subjects peculiarly adapted to the 
purpose (as mathematics for reasoning, literature for imagina- 
tion, etc.), and which may then be applied successfully to other 
and quite unlike situations (for example, the power gained from 
mathematics to reasoning in other fields, or even to work in such 
a widely separated field as foreign languages). 
It may be said, at once, that few now hold to the traditional} 
form of the dogma (or to the “faculty” psychology which fathers 
it). The doctrine of specific discipline expresses the trend of mod 
ern thinking; for example, the ability to reason gained fro: 
mathematics is good for mathematics and for nothing else 
Accordingly there is no such thing as general ability in the ol 
sense; on the contrary, the mind is a complex of more or less dis 
tinct knowledges and abilities, each of which demands its ow 
specific instruction and training and each of which function:

       the modification that certain general results from specific train- 
ing, very important to education, are noticeable, viz., general con- 
cepts of method (generalized ideas of attention, attack, procedure, 
inductively derived from properly conducted special studies, 
which may be transformed into habits generally applicable); and, 
not less important for younger pupils, general attitudes toward - 
their school work which shall determine whether they shall be 
parrot repeaters or seekers after understanding. 
Our interest, however, is not the general problem of transfer 
from one subject to another but the more particular one of trans- 
fer from one part of the same subject to another. It might be 
supposed (and has been supposed) that a pupil is either good in 
arithmetic or he is not. The experiments on the performances of 
upils heretofore described point toward a different conclusion. 
ut these experiments were not directed specifically toward the 
uestion of transfer and the procedure, therefore, cannot be 
egarded as conclusive on that point. The procedure in the in- 
estigation of transfer is now well settled to be as follows: (1) to 
easure the ability in each subject (or branch of subject) at the 
eginning of the test, (2) to concentrate on increasing the ability 
n one of the subjects (or one branch), (3) to measure again the 
bility in the other subject (or branch) to see if there has been 
ny increase following the increase made in the subject concen- 
rated upon. 
The following experiments were conducted under the super- 
ision of W. H. Winch (50) in three London municipal schools for 
irls and one school for boys. The purpose of the experiments 
as to seek an answer to the question, “Does improvement in 
ccuracy of numerical computation transfer to arithmetical 
easoning?”’ 
“Tn each case a whole class, working according to the same 
yllabus of work and under one teacher, was divided into two 
qual groups. The division was effected on the results of several

          tests in problematical arithmetic. In order that the natural 
ability of the children rather than their memory of recent teach- 
ing should be tested in these exercises, it was arranged that no 
problems should be given in a form with which the pupils were 
well acquainted. The tests were marked solely with reference to 
the accuracy of the arithmetical reasoning and entirely without 
reference to the accuracy of numerical computation. No atten- 
tion was paid to the right answers; marks were given with refer- 
ence to the process only” (50, p. 561). 
“When the two equal groups had been obtained, one of them 
was practiced in a series of exercises in rule sums which every 
child knew how to do; the other group being meanwhile engaged in 
some other branch of school work. In every other respect the 
curriculum for both groups was precisely the same during the 
period of the experiment. No other arithmetical work was done 
during the time the experiment lasted” (50, p. 561). 
“Finally the two groups, namely, the one practiced in accurate| 
numerical computation and the one not so practiced were placed 
together again, and final tests were given in arithmetical reason. 
ing. There had been in all cases a considerable improvement ii 
the accuracy of numerical computation during the series of prac 
tice exercises. How far was this improvement in the accuracy o: 
numerical computation transferred to accuracy in arithmetica 
reasoning? Did the practiced or the non-practiced groups d 
better work when the groups worked the same test exercises a’ 
the end?” (50, pp. 561, 562). 
The method of marking the problems was to credit each neces 
sary rational step taken in the solution with one mark. “It is no’ 
maintained that this system of marking is theoretically perfect. 
but it gives steady and reliable results, and is a system whic 
teachers readily appreciate and understand” (50, p. 566). 
“The method of marking adapted for accuracy in computation 
though extremely laborious, was, in principle, extremely simple}
-P-A-G-E-145
  
Statistical Studies 133 
   
   
                                         
    
    
   It was intended that no sum should be set in these exercises which 
the children did not know how to do; but, of course, though the 
processes were well known, there was much variation in accuracy 
of computation. It is obvious to any one who has kept records of 
arithmetical work from week to week that the usual method of 
marking sums ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ and allowing for each sum so 
many marks, all or most of which are lost if there is any numerical 
inaccuracy, will not give us a series of results which will ade- 
quately show improvement in accuracy. A child with one or 
two figures wrong in several sums may really have worked more 
accurately than another child who has all the sums right but one, 
provided that that one be wrong in many places. Further, a child 
may make much improvement even though its total number of 
sums right does not increase. Having these considerations in 
mind it was decided to give one mark for each correct unit of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division” (50, p. 567). 
“Some—a very few—able children telescope processes which 
average children work out at greater length, but their units are 
always calculated on the most generous basis” (50, p. 368). (I 
take it that this means that such pupils were credited with all 
the units involved up to each correct point in their solutions, 
though the units of work actually performed by them were 
ewer.) “A child on this method of marking does not lose all the 
est of the marks for that sum because one number early in the 
um is found wrong, even though subsequent operations on that 
umber lead to further errors in the sum as usually understood. 
e may not really have made any more [further] errors; it is 
ecessary to go through the sum, unit by unit, to see if he has 
r not” (50, p. 368). 
The following tables summarize the results for three of the four 
chools: (50, pp. 571; 578, 585):

*, on the basis of the preliminary exercises in reasoning, and the” 
average mark in the final exercises is recorded for each section. 
If we compare the final marks of the two groups in any of the 
tables section by section, the differences are seen to be slight/ 
and not always in favor of the practiced group. 
Winch (51) tried some further work on the transfer of numer- 
ical accuracy in a municipal boys’ school in London. A class 
of 72 boys, with an average age of slightly over ten years, was 
divided into two equal groups on the basis of the pupils’ ability in 
arithmetical reasoning. One group was given ten practice exer- 
cises in numerical computation while the other was occupied 
with drawing. Both groups were then tested with the same prob- 
lems in arithmetical reasoning. This is the same general pro- 
cedure as was used in the first series of tests, but the method was 
modified by not working out the problems numerically. This 
plan was regarded by the experimenter “‘as a better means for 
testing the transfer (if any) of improvement in numerical accur- 
acy to accuracy in reasoning and a safer basis from which to cal- 
culate correlations” (51, p. 263). 
Sixty-four boys finished the tests. The results are shown in the 
following table condensed from that of the author:

Here, again, an inspection of the final marks given in the table 
shows on the average no gain for the practiced group, while the 
differences, section by section, are too small to be significant and 
show (if anything) opposite tendencies. 
In both of these studies the author gives tables (here 
omitted) showing that the gain through practice within the 
practice medium itself is very decided. Of course, if this had 
not been found to be the case, further experiment would have 
been worthless. 
As a subsidiary question, in the first study, he compared the 
results of the preliminary tests in computation (these tests were 
given during the same period and under the same conditions as 
the preliminary tests in reasoning for correlation purposes, which 
are discussed below) with the computations made in the final tests 
in reasoning, to see if the practiced group carried over their im- 
provement in numerical accuracy in pure computation to the 
numerical accuracy with which problems are worked. This is an 
open question. He found that such improvement did take place 
very decidedly except in the case of the poorest section. “The 
(four) children in this group showed no continuous improvement 
in the practice exercises in numerical accuracy; the continued 
practice at short intervals seems to have diminished their arith- 
metical capacity, which is not altogether an unexpected result 
with very weak pupils” (50, p. 572, footnote).   Conclusions.—1. Improvement in accuracy of arithmetical 
computation seems to have produced no improvement in the 
accuracy of arithmetical reasoning. 
2. For the present, therefore, pending more conclusive ex- 
periments, numerical accuracy should be sought for because it 
is valuable in actual life, and not because we can feel confident 
that an improvement in it will transfer to accuracy of arith- 
metical reasoning.
-P-A-G-E-149
    
Statistical Studies 137 
3. Both practiced and unpracticed groups show a slight 
improvement in arithmetical reasoning, an improvement which 
is found to be practically equal in the two groups. The signifi- 
cance of this for experimental work with school children is 
considerable. The assumption which is made by the method of 
equal groups is as follows: With equal groups of the same grades 
or class, and approximately of the same age, the growth effects in 
the mental function in relation to which the division is made are 
practically identical, at least for short periods. 
The assumption for groups of this size appears in this case to 
be corroborated by the results. 
4. There exists high positive correlation between the two 
functions, numerical computation and arithmetical reason- 
ing. 
(The coefficients of correlation, Pearson formula, for the five 
classes experimented upon were as follows: + .68; + .79; 
etg00;0¢1 e855 at 74) 
The fact that these high correlations exist side by side with 
little or no empirical evidence of transfer is highly significant for 
the interpretation of correlation coefficients. It might be sup- 
posed that high correlation necessarily involves community of 
function. But, as a matter of fact, “finding correlation between 
two functions need not mean: that improvement in one has 
brought about increased efficiency in the other; but the absence 
of correlation does mean the opposite” (Thorndike and Wood- 
worth quoted by Heck, 77, p. 102). 
At least three interpretations may be given to a high positive 
correlation coefficient: (1) one function causes the other, (2) the 
two functions have a common factor, (3) the two functions are 
oincident without being interdependent. Which of the three 
nterpretations is correct must be determined upon the ground 
f inquiry on such lines as in the preceding experiments. No evi-  
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
dence of transfer being found, we must conclude that the correla- 
tion is a sign of mere “togetherness” due to natural or acquired 
ability in both functions. 
In order to place Winch’s pioneer experiments in the light in 
which he would have them appear, I append the following quo- 
tation from Winch’s reply to L. Leland Locke (Journal of Educa- 
tional Psychology, June, 1911, p. 335). “The strongest argument 
against definite conclusions on the question of transfer from ex- 
periments like those [described] is the comparative shortness of 
time over which the experiments extend. On page 572 (Journal 
of Educational Psychology, December, 1910) I said, ‘It is not 
fair to conclude from this experiment that no amount of improve- 
ment in numerical accuracy would transfer to accuracy in numer- 
ical reasoning, but only that the improvement shown in ‘this case 
was insufficient to transfer. There is a presumption that [any 
amount of improvement] might not, since there is a clear transfer 
of improvement in numerical accuracy itself from rule sums to 
problems.’ But I am acutely conscious that improvements 
effected at high pressure for short periods are not improvements 
which we believe on general educational grounds to be very likely 
to transfer.” 
Also the following from Winch’s article in the Journal of 
Educational Psychology, -Dec., 1910, p. 589: “The value of the 
foregoing investigations appears to me to lie chiefly in the sugges- 
tion of a method by which a very important pedagogical question 
may be ultimately solved under school conditions. It is a method 
which teachers can easily use for themselves.” 
An experiment by Starch, 1911 (52), with adult subjects who 
added introspective testimony to objective results shows that 
such transfer as occurs is due to general abilities developed which 
are usable in both functions and not to any community of func- 
tion. This is a confirmation of the general trend of thinking on 
the subject of transfer,
-P-A-G-E-151

   Eight observers practiced for fourteen days on mental multi- 
plication, using problems composed of three digits in the multi- 
plicand and one in the multiplier. Before and after the practice 
they were given six tests in arithmetical operations (computation) 
and two in auditory memory span. A different set of problems 
was used in the tests made after the training series, but of the 
same nature as those used before. The memory-span tests were 
(1) for numbers, (2) for words, using monosyllabic nouns. All 
calculation was done mentally; the subject looked at the problem 
long enough to get it in mind, then closed his eyes, or looked 
away, worked the problem, and set down the answer. The 
Imemory-span tests were made by reading to the subjects groups 
lof words or numbers at the rate of one word or number per second. 
fter each group had been read the subjects wrote down all 
ey remembered. 
For comparison, seven other observers were given the prelimi- 
ary and final tests without the practice series. The purpose of 
his was to determine the amount of improvement in the perform- 
nce of the end tests themselves, which must be deducted from 
he improvements made by those who took the training series. 
This amount of improvement was found to be 20%; the impor- 
ance of deducting this is apparent.) 
The result of the experiment showed that the practiced obser- 
ers improved from 20% to 40% more in the arithmetical tests 
han the unpracticed. There was little change in the memory 
pan for either group. “In what way did the training in mental 
ultiplication help in the other calculations? According to the 
trospective accounts, the largest factor was the ability acquired, 
the training series of keeping the numbers better in mind” (52, 
. 309). “ Several individuals mentioned the acquisition of the 
ethod of calculating by simply visualizing the arithmetical 
perations” (52, p. 309). “At the beginning it was so difficult to 
ear the numbers of a problem in mind while calculating, and the  
-P-A-G-E-152
140 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
    
    
         
    
             
     
    
     problem often became so confused, that the calculating had to 
be started all over again” (52, p. 309). 
“The improvement in the end tests was due, therefore, to the 
identical elements acquired in the training series and directly 
utilized in the other arithmetical operations. The two main 
factors were (a) the increased ability to apprehend and hold the 
numbers in mind, and (b) the acquisition of the ability to visual- 
ize arithmetical operation” (52, p. 310). 
“The memory span showed practically no change, partly be- 
cause it is too dissimilar to the functions involved in the training 
series and partly because it does not seem to be subject to much 
enlargement through training” (52, p. 310). 
An interesting question, in this connection, is whether mathe- 
matical reasoning transfers to reasoning in everyday affairs; or, in 
other words, whether one may expect his training in mathematics 
to function in practical reasoning. The tradition is that the 
mathematical thinker is a strong reasoner in all situations. I 
quote from Heck (77) an account of experiments on this point (of 
which there are few) conducted by the Dartmouth Pedagogical 
Department under the direction of Lewis (published in School] 
Review, April, 1905). ‘First, two test papers were prepared, one 
containing originals in geometry and the other questions in prac 
tical reasoning. (The second paper dealt with the value of high| 
school education to the individuals and to the community.) 
These tests were submitted to twenty-four different groups o 
high school pupils. The students of each group belonged to th 
same class and were on an equality with respect to mathematica 
preparation. Each group took both tests. The results of thes 
tests were carefully corrected and the pupils of each grou 
arranged in two series, the first according to their ranking i 
mathematical and the second according to their ranking in prac 
tical reasoning” (77, p. 96). 
“Tf we take the first five mathematical reasoners from each o'

   the twenty-four groups, we have in all one hundred and twenty 
pupils most excellent in mathematical reasoning. Of this number 
seventy-six, or 63%, are at the foot of the practical reasoning 
series, conspicuous for their inefficiency in practical reasoning. 
Of the number of pupils at the foot of the mathematical reasoning 
series, fifty-seven, or 47%, are conspicuous for their positions at 
the head of the practical reasoning series” (77, p. 97). 
“As a supplementary test, and one precisely the same in princi- 
ple, one man examined the records of Dartmouth students who 
had taken mathematics and certain law courses which required a 
‘ood deal of reasoning. The records for ten different classes were 
xamined, and tables were formed as in the previous test” (77, 
- 97)- 
“The results of this test were found to be strikingly parallel 
o those of the earlier test. Fifty per cent of the best students 
n law were conspicuous for their poor showing in mathematics; 
nd 42% of those poorest in law stood at the head of the series in 
athematics” (77, p. 97). . 
An investigation of Rietz and Shade at the University of Tlli- 
ois, 1908, published at the University under the title “Correlation 
f Efficiency in Mathematics and Efficiency in Other Subjects” 
ems to the authors to point to conclusions opposite to those of 
he Dartmouth experiments. They found coefficients of correla- 
ion as follows: for mathematics and foreign languages .48; for 
athematics and natural science .44; probable error in each case 
15. Notwithstanding these low coefficients they conclude “that 
fficiency in mathematics and efficiency in foreign languages go 
ogether in general to a high degree, and that to substantially the 
ame extent do efficiency in mathematics and in natural sciences 
‘0 together” (quoted by Heck 77, p. 98). 
But these coefficients guarantee nothing more than a certain 
not very high) degree of togetherness, explicable upon the basis 
f common elements in the two subjects, or of coincidentally but

ability requires such a procedure as that used by Winch or Starch. 
   
   
   
    
      
   
      
             
     
        
    (d) Hygiene. 
The fact that the several school subjects, aside from physiology, 
have considerations of the health of the child as one of their aspects 
is one that has received attention from students of education only 
recently. Studies in such matters as arrested development, arith- 
momania, and pathological conditions of various sorts among 
school children have brought a realization that dangers to mental 
and physical health hover about some of our most cherished| 
school practices. The reference here is not to the unanalyzed and 
unspecified popular ascription of all the ills to which childish flesh} 
is heir to an “overcrowded curriculum.” The tendency, ofte 
fostered by the ill-advised opinions of pedagogically ignoran’ 
physicians, to blame on the schools the ill-health that is the resul 
of excesses or indiscretions committed outside the school room. 
is a frequent cause of exasperation to teachers who know th 
truth. But school men are free to admit that there are severa! 
counts upon which from a hygienic standpoint they may b 
indicted legitimately. It is, however, upon the ground of careful 
and long-continued investigation by qualified experts that thi 
legitimate indictment can be based, not upon popular clamor o 
merely medical assumption. 
Little ground of complaint now remains in regard to the car 
exercised for physical and mental health of school children, gener} 
ally speaking. Much has been accomplished in this respect an 
more is on the way. Sanitarily built and cared-for school build 
ings, school doctors and school nurses are doing their intelligen: 
work. But it is the hygiene of school instruction, still very muc 
in its infancy, that presents problems that will engage the bes} 
minds for some time to come, problems whose solutions will b

    welcomed and reduced to practice, it is to be hoped, by every in- 
telligent school man at the earliest possible moment. 
Prof. W. H. Burnham of Clark University must be regarded as 
the pioneer in this country in bringing attention to problems of 
the hygiene of instruction. His articles on the hygiene of the 
several school subjects have awakened an interest and contributed 
considerable illumination. 
Many offenses have doubtless been committed against the well- 
being of children in the name of arithmetic. The overzealousness 
with which the study has been pursued in times past because of 
an overestimation of its educational as well as its practical value 
has been the fruitful cause of undue emphasis upon certain of its 
aspects without any thought of what were to be the effects upon 
the mental life in the long run. Proximate aims of efficiency in 
speed and accuracy of computation have led to heartless and 
almost mindless drills that often become heartrending and mind- 
wrecking. The overuse of the purely mechanical, untimely, 
npsychologized drill, is the first of the sins to be noted. It is the 
“practical” sin. As Dr. Burnham (53) says, teachers as a rule 
ake no thought of secondary results—the habit of thinking 
ormed, the mental automatisms acquired, the possible arrests of 
evelopment occasioned by processes that seem at first view to 
e the acme of pedagogical efficiency. While no one would 
eriously advocate the abandonment of drill we need to know 
ore about when and how to use it. Along with drill goes the use 
f certain devices and methods whose abuse or unnecessary use 
ave bad after effects. 
Some cases cited by Triplett, Pedagogical Seminary, June, 
go5 (quoted by Burnham), are the persistence in consciousness 
f red and green balls (from the abacus) when adding; of the fitting 
ogether of sliced birds (by which device the digits were learned) 
hen thinking of the digits; when not considering number but pay- 
g close attention to a subject one person finds herself running up

   the scale of number by twos, threes or tens; another writes 1, 2, 3, 
4 continually; another writes dollar signs by the hundreds; others 
note a set of mind by years of working for the answer; some who 
learned the multiplication table in concert are compelled to start 
at the beginning and go to the combination desired. These are 
examples of mental automatisms which, to say the least, are 
annoying, are utterly valueless to the unfortunate subject, and a 
constant source of interference and confusion in his mental func- 
tioning. Some of these automatisms are classed under the head of 
“arrests of development.” Numerical relations fill the mind to 
the exclusion of more important relations; the subject is truly 
not sane on this subject, in short, he is a victim of arithmomania. 
He enumerates everything—counts telegraph poles, boards in 
the sidewalk, steps in the stairs, trees along the way, etc. And it 
is known that this mild form of not-saneness may develop in 
times of mental stress into pathological forms, not to be distin- 
guished from true insanity. The case is cited, which is no doubt 
typical of many others, of a boy who excelled in speed and accur- 
acy when in the elementary school. In the high school he was 
found to be incapable of thinking in the higher mathematics—al 
case of arrested development. 
From an educational standpoint, arithmetic has been thought 
to have a tremendous value as a means of mental discipline. A 
mental power, especially of reasoning, was developed through its 
processes that could be applied, it was thought, to other than 
mathematical fields. This belief has led educators to give a large| 
amount of time to the subject, and to devote much of that time 
to unessential processes, complex analyses, and obsolete topics. 
Much of the work in the lower grades has been too difficult. 
Mathematical puzzles brought down from the middle ages have 
been frequently given; and while much of this kind of work has} 
been removed from the schools, it is still true that much of th 
work might be simplified or eliminated. Moreover, the doctrine

   hat the mind may be trained on the basis of any content what- 
ver, mathematical or otherwise, with the expectation that the 
ower gained may be applied to data in another field, however 
lissimilar, has been found to be largely a myth. We have re- 
iewed the results of the study of transfer elsewhere (pp. 129- 
41) and of the correlation of different abilities within the 
eld of arithmetic itself, and find no evidence of such a thing as 
ormal discipline in the old sense. One must agree then with 
rof. Young (67) that the general training obtained. from arith- 
etic is through its typical exemplification of certain modes of 
thought; one of these modes is the ability to grasp the facts in a 
ituation. The child, of course, must have the experience neces- 
lary to do this, but, given the experience, he must grasp the essen- 
ial fact in the situation, the guiding principle or, if you will, the 
ajor premise. For example, here is a situation: A man can do 
piece of work in 6 days, how many days will it take 2 men to do 
5} 
Major premise: 2 men require 3 as many days as 1 man; 
Minor premise: 1 man requires 6 days; 
Conclusion: 2 men require 4 of 6 days. 
Here is another: A dog standing on 1 leg weighs 15 pounds, 
low much will he weigh when standing on 4 legs? 
Major premise (false): A dog standing on 4 legs weighs 
4 times as much as a dog standing on 1 leg; 
Minor premise: A dog standing on 1 leg weighs 15 pounds; 
Conclusion: A dog standing on 4 legs weighs 4 times 15 
pounds. 
The latter procedure is typical for the child who works without 
umption,” in other words, who has no “concept of method.” 
is undoubtedly true that much practice in seeking and applying 
e major premise, without which little success can be hoped for, 
n be given in the problematical portions of arithmetic and the

   habit thus formed can be carried over. The application of this 
fact from the hygienic point of view is that children should not 
be worried with much problem work until they are sufficiently) 
experienced to have acquired the apperceptive means of appre- 
ciating situations and sufficiently mature to have the power off 
grasping the core of the situation presented. It is not mean 
that any such formal, logical statement as that set forth abov 
shall be used, but rather simple, direct means for getting at th 
heart of the matter at the start, from which point forward thi 
child must be given the chance to work out his own salvation 
The hygiene of instruction in arithmetic is also concerned with th 
following matters, among others, which can be touched upon onl 
briefly. The time cost. Recent investigations of arithmetical 
efficiency (Rice, Stone), which we have considered in anothe! 
place, show that efficiency is not a function of the time devoted t 
the subject.. Hygiene demands that this subject be taught wit! 
the smallest time cost consistent with efficiency. All results fro 
studies in the economy of learning are thus seen to be contrib’ 
tions to hygiene, since some of the time saved may be given t 
health exercises. The public needs to be educated, too, out of i 
exaggerated esteem for arithmetic growing out of a belief that it 
the sine qua non of success in life, which has led to an unthinkin} 
concession on the part of pedagogues to the occupancy by aritl 
metic of a too large share of the curriculum. 
Some attention should be given to differing mental type 
Though this subject is shrouded in considerable mysticis 
enough is known about it to show that some children learn arit 
metic with ease while others learn it with difficulty. The latt 
are not on this account to be set down as stupid; they should 
differentiated from the others as probably being of an extrospe: 
tive type to whom quantitative aspects of things do not appe} 
and for which they have no ability. They should not be harass 
with the subject, but allowed to pass with a very minimum r

uirement. Of more importance, however, are the discoveries of 
ourtis and others that few children can be ticketed as having 
rithmetical ability in general consequent upon a blanket type of 
ind. The ability myth is akin to the “faculty” myth. All 
orts of variation of functioning in arithmetic are found in the 
ame child. There are types within types, if we may so apply the 
erm. It would be a matter of economy, then, and therefore of 
ygiene if he were given the work which he is diagnosed to need, 
nd not the work which for him is time largely wasted. 
Hygiene also notes that arithmetic should not be taught pre- 
aturely. Burnham says, “Formal instruction at an early age is 
able to be injurious. The grotesque ‘number forms’ which so 
any children have and which originate in this period are evi- 
ence of the necessity which the child feels of giving some kind 
f bodily shape to these abstractions which he is compelled to 
tudy. Mathematics in every form is ill fitted to the childish 
ind; it involves comparison, analysis, abstraction. It calls for a 
Iler development of the association tracts and nerve-fibers 
atrick). Where arithmetic is not studied until ro it is often 
und that there is no loss but rather an advantage” (53, p. 62). 
is undoubtedly true that formal instruction should not be given 
too early age, chiefly, however, because the time is more needed 
r other things. The reasons given by Burnham are not convinc- 
g. Comparison, analysis, abstraction are not characteristic of 
imary instruction, but perception and memory are in the pure 
mber relations which only he may be called upon to deal with. 
umber forms are not “grotesque” except from the point of view 
the layman. No harm has ever been shown to come from them, 
t on the contrary much good. In any event, as we have found 
our study of the genesis of number, they are probably unavoid- 
le, even without formal instruction, since they seem to take 
eir rise in the prenaming stage when the counting impulse has 
insufficient motor outlet.  
-P-A-G-E-160

That arithmetic may be deferred to the age of 10 or thereabouts 
without disadvantage is by no means proved. We may agree 
that problematical arithmetic may be deferred, but, as Hall 
concludes, it is probable that many kinds of work can profitably 
and safely be done early without transcending the natural inter- 
ests and abilities of children. 
As was intimated at the beginning, valuable results in hygiene 
can be obtained upon only an experimental basis. Dr. Burnham 
enumerates some investigations in pedagogy now going on which 
will contribute results of value in part to hygiene. The associa- 
tion processes involved in arithmetical operations; the ability o' 
different mental types in such operations; the normal variation 
of ability with age and sex; the variations in individuals; the valu 
of different methods with relation to different types and forms 0 
ability, the value of discipline in this subject in relation to othe 
school subjects; the value of drill; the secondary effects of differ 
ent methods of learning and instruction. Some of these investiga. 
tions we have reviewed elsewhere.

   The special problem in experimental didactics to which we 
must confine ourselves in this presentation of work that has been 
attempted is that of the material and method to be used in pre- 
senting to children things to be numbered. Psychological studies, 
uch as we have reviewed (Messenger, Burnett, Cattell, Dietze, 
arren, Nanu), as well as the observations of infants by Preyer, 
ries, Jegi,and others, and the geneticstudies of Phillips, to which 
e have referred, point to the conclusion that there is no original 
rasp of the number of impressions simultaneously or successively 
resented, but that apprehension is a matter of gradual growth 
nd therefore may be facilitated or hindered by outer and inner 
onditions. 
The apparently immediate apprehension of the number ina 
roup, which children display even under the most unfavorable 
ircumstances and which so greatly facilitates computation, is 
mething worth developing; how best it may be developed is the 
uestion. 
The beginning of the solution (by a trial and error method of 
perimentation) dates back to Pestalozzi. He had the insight 
at number in the percept is codrdinate with word and form, that 
percept is complete until the numerical relations of the An- 
hauungdinge are known. He, therefore, emphasized the objec- 
ve aspect of beginning arithmetic and furthermore devised for 
e practice of his pupils his Strichtabelle (stroke-tables), which 
lere the forerunner of the modern number pictures. To these we 
n take the space merely to refer, as they now possess only an 
storical interest. (For description and criticism of them, see 
149  
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
Meumann (57), pp. 335-338.) This artificial means of instruction 
presupposed, in Pestalozzi’s thought, not only teaching with 
objects so far as that might be necessary, but also the unguided 
acquirement by intelligent children of number notions from their 
own experience with objects and events. “His art aims at bring- 
ing back the conceptual content into the artificially made percep- 
tion material, in connection with which the artificial means have 
the advantage from a didactical point of view to be much mor 
practically and extensively available than the natural objects b 
which the first number ideas were gained.” (H. J. Walsemann’ 
Pestalozzi’s Rechen-methode, quoted by Meumann, Vol. 2 (57) 
P- 334-) 
Since Pestalozzi’s time a variety of artificial means has bee 
evolved on the Continent, chiefly in Germany; number picture: 
arranging dots in two parallel horizontal rows by Born, Busse, an 
Boehme, arranging dots vertically by Hentschel, Beetz, Sobelew: 
sky, and Kaselitz; also a variety of reckoning machines, largel 
with the vertical arrangement, but a few like the Russian wit! 
the horizontal arrangement. In connection with all of these ther 
has been much discussion and speculation, with but little genuin 
experiment. The value of number pictures appealing to the spa| 
tial element of the number consciousness has been denied entirel 
by aschool of pedagogues who emphasize the temporal elemen| 
and would practice the child in counting exclusively, or at least i 
the numerical recognition of impressions presented successivel 
The classic controversy into the details of which we cannot g| 
thus arising between the Zéhlmethodiker and Zahlbildermeth 
diker has been disposed of by Meumann, we think rightly, b' 
has, further, been made a subject for experiment by Lay, wh 
reaches the same conclusion. (See our review of Lay’s Fithr 
durch den Rechenunterricht, Leipzig, 1907, pp. 155-199.) Me 
mann (57, pp. 338-334) says substantially: There can be dou 
that in the image and in the concept, both spatial and tempor:
-P-A-G-E-163

elements are involved, so we conclude that both methods are one- 
sided and that with each of them the child has somewhat to supply 
from its own power. With a pure counting method the child 
generally would not attain to a simultaneous apprehension of a 
definite number of objects in space; on the other hand the simul- 
taneous presentation involves for the little child a number of 
lobjects in space presented successively through a corresponding 
umber of separate perception acts and the manifold presentation 
f these objects is for the childish mind in the beginning a repe- 
ition of equal or similar impressions in time. Witness the obser- 
ations of Preyer and others that the first definite number con- 
epts of the child develop seemingly from counting which has the 
orm “one, yet one, yet one.” Moreover, with a pure simultan- 
ous method the understanding of the number order would be 
acking; also the elementary and immediate opportunities for the 
ttainment of concepts through simple temporal relationships, 
amely, the temporal occurrences of bodily and limb movements 
nd the ability to use the temporal element when his simultaneous 
rasp fails. Therefore it is clear that only by the correct combina- 
ion of both methods can the essence of number representation 
nd processes be made clear to the child. Moreover, the idea- 
ional type plays a réle here. A child of the visual type is favored 
y the number-picture method; on the other hand, the auditory 
ype is suited to the counting method but handicapped by the 
ictures. It would appear that to counting must be given a sub- 
idiary place and one pertaining mainly in any good didactic to 
vimary phases of apprehension. Through proper grouping, the 
erception of number pictures must be admitted, whatever may 
le one’s explanation of it, to be capable of wide development. 
ufficient experimental work has been done and observations 
ade to establish this. Even if a number group must be counted 
hut, the simultaneous apprehension very soon follows and through 
ractice the latter can be so established that the counting becomes

   eliminated; the number picture then replaces the counting and 
causes an entirely extraordinary ease and simplicity of perceptive 
reckoning (Meumann). (Lay would not entirely indorse this 
account of the growth into function of the number picture, but we 
will let his view appear in its proper place). 
The exact province of perceptional apprehension and reckoning 
can perhaps best be indicated by quoting some further words of 
Meumann (57, p. 357). ‘““The elementary arithmetical operations 
become to the adult completely familiar only if they take on an 
absolutely mechanical character, i. e., psychologically speaking, if 
they can be reproduced as pure successive word associations 
without any perceptional content. No merchant adds a long| 
column of figures in his book while he has the visible group of just} 
as many circles or strokes before his eyes; should he have the 
before his eyes he would progress like a snail; with small an 
large multiplications the adult calculates by pure mechanical 
series-association (reproduction) of number words. We ad 
to this that all the larger numbers remain to people permanentl. 
unperceptional, pure, abstractly conceived large numbers. There: 
fore the perceptional reckoning can be overstepped. It had it 
special significance for the certainty and clearness of the firs 
foundation of instruction in arithmetic; but should it be retaine 
after the first operations become familiar to the child and ex 
tended even to operations which are developed out of this elemen: 
tary work, then it will operate retardingly and hold back th 
natural development of arithmetic which moves toward wor! 
with the abstract number and with mechanical association an 
reproduction.” 
The value of the number picture being granted, the questio: 
remains (and this is our special problem) what form of it do chil 
dren most readily apprehend and employ? 
To the solution of this question the principal experimental con: 
tributions have been first by Lay (Fithrer durch den erste

   ‘echenunterricht, Wiesbaden, 1898). With a much improved 
experimental method H. J. Walsemann repeated these experi- 
nents (Anschauungslehre der Rechenkunst auf experimenteller 
rundlage, Schlesswig, 1907) and added others. Lay again pre- 
ented a revised and enlarged edition of his Fithrer in 1907, inci- 
entally replying to Walsemann, Knilling and some of his other 
ritics. Lay’s book is the most thoroughgoing presentation of 
he experimental didactics of elementary arithmetic extant and to 
t we shall give considerable space, including some experiments by 
nilling, his critic (Knilling, Kritik zu W. A. Lay’s experimen- 
eller Forschungsergebnissen. Piid.-psych. Studien III. 11.12), 
nd incidentally referring to some results of Pfeiffer, Schneider, 
nd Walsemann. 
Walsemann (56) tried the pictures in the table on page 154. 
The table shows in the first and second row one-row groups, 
in. the third and fourth two-row groups, in the fifth, from seven 
mn, three-row groups, and in the sixth arbitrary groups. The 
me-row circle forms of the second row is the so-called Russian 
alculating machine essentially. The two-row material of the 
hird row has, between the pairs,of points, equal distances 
normal number picture) which is exactly the same as the fourth 
low except that the latter, after two pairs of points, has a greater 
istance (quadratic number picture). These constructions of 
erceptional material Lay (1898) had tried with the exception of 
w 5. He had found that the one-row arrangement (rows 1 and 
) is unfavorable; also that the arbitrary grouping (row 6, Beetz 
umber picture) was unfeasible. The most practical arrangement 
ccording to Lay (1898) was the two-row arrangement (a) with 
e equal distances (so-called normal number picture) and (b) 
ith unlike distances (row 4, quadratic number picture); the 
tter slightly more practical. 
Walsemann found next by a comparison of the stroke-formed 
ements (Pestalozzi) and the two-row circle forms a sixteen-fold

superiority of the latter. Then he compared the apprehension of 
the two-row and the three-row circle-form elements. The two- 
row (normal number picture) showed about a one and a half fold 
superiority. Next he tested with a new research arrangement (a 
machine of his own make) the normal and the quadratic number- 
pictures; first, whether the one-row picture of four and five can 
be grasped still more certainly [than in former tests] in two train- 
ing classes and one school class. (Lay had claimed that this 
should be established more positively.) Walsemann found that 
the one-row dot-picture of four can be determined with a very high 
grade of certainty. The picture of five was less certainly deter- 
mined. So then he investigated how the numbers from five to 
twelve can be grasped using normal and quadratic pictures (in all 
1728 trials). It resulted that with the normal number picture 61 
errors (6.8%) were made; with the quadratic 84 errors (9.4%)- 
According to this the result of Lay should be changed in favor of 
the normal pictures. (Lay claims (Fithrer, 1907) that Walsemann 
did not use his quadratic pictures at all in this experiment; see 
page 178.) Still a greater superiority of the normal pictures 
shows itself in tests in division with the help of circle-form pic- 
tures. Through this result, Walsemann concludes, the small bal- 
ance in favor of quadratic material is removed to the opposite side 
and not inconsiderably increased. 
In the following account of the experiments of W. A. Lay, taken 
from his Fiihrer, Leipzig, 1907, pp- 76-141, I have taken the 
liberty to make a few insertions for the sake of clearness, or 
correction [indicated by brackets], to correct some typographical 
errors, and to change the form of the tables so as to make them 
perhaps more quickly intelligible, but chiefly in order that 
percentages might be shown upon which to base comparisons 
Wwith the results of my own experiments. I have also mentioned 
briefly what in a few instances seem to be mistaken inferences 
from his results,

STUFE DER EXPERIMENTELL-DIDAKTISCHEN UNTERSUCHUNG.— 
Die EXPERIMENTE UND DIE DeutuNG InRER ERGEBNISSE. 
1. Concerning the numerical apprehension of temporal things 
through hearing and sight.—Everyone knows from experience 
that both spatial and temporal things are accessible to numerical 
apprehension. This consideration brings us immediately to a 
problem, which the methodist instinctively has left aside, al- 
though it is not without significance: Is the succession or the 
simultaneity of things, are things in space or in time to be re- 
garded as the most advantageous intuitive or counting material 
for the first number teaching? 
In order that an insight might be obtained in the numerical 
apprehension of temporal things through hearing, an experiment 
was instituted with several kindergarten children in age from 
4 to 6. 
Experiment.—The experimenter knocked 2 or 3 or 4 times in 
a second on the table in such a manner that the children heard 
the knocks but could not see them. 
The children were required to repeat the knocks as accurately 
as possible. 
The research shows these results: 
In the cases of 2 strokes, still more in the case of 3 and 4, mis- 
takes occur, many more than when 2, 3 and 4 things, arranged in 
a spatial series, were apprehended through the eyes though a 
shorter time was used. 
It was noticed that the apprehension of the sound series 
became easier if rhythm was brought into the series. 
Observations on the teaching practice of the first school year 
and child psychology show that the apprehension of a temporal 
succession affords considerable difficulty to children. - Lay on 
these and other grounds takes the position that in general the 
forming of the number image takes its rise not from temporal]

Didactical Studies 157 
   
      
    
    
          
    things and through hearing, but from spatial things and through 
sight; and ventures to assert that the first number teaching 
should not be based on the sense of hearing but preéminently on 
the sense of sight and touch. 
Whereby it is not asserted that the numerical apprehension of 
temporal things and auditory perception should be neglected; 
systematic number teaching must give these things a fair share of 
attention. 
2. Concerning the limits of apprehension of things in rows.— 
How many spatial and temporal things in a row, for instance, 
how many balls in the Russian machine can children of the first 
school year simultaneously visually grasp and represent? The 
methodist has sought to answer these questions on the ground of 
observations of adults or according to accounts of a racial psy- 
chology, and their answers have differed. At times they have set 
the limits at 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Recent accounts of primitive people 
show that their limit lies at 2 or 3. 
“We must naturally expect that we can attain to no sharply 
defined answer through our experiment. Children with differing 
abilities will differ. We disclaim such an answer as our purpose.” 
Experiment.—The balls of the Russian machine were used. 
Diameter = 4.5 cm.; color, yellow. After the 5th ball a space 
as left. Between the smaller numbers 2, 3, 4 the larger 5 and 6 
ere inserted, thus breaking up the succession.

Three pupils had o mistakes; 8 pupils had 1 mistake. 
[Note.—I have assumed that the averages given above are 
correct, but there are several errors in Lay’s tabulation.] 
In all research results a small number of mistakes due to 
defective attention occur. Lay sought to avoid these as much as 
possible, but it was impossible entirely to avoid the fluctuation of 
attention in individual pupils and in the class. 
The attention is dependent on temporary physical condition 
and content of consciousness, which through inner and outer 
causes of an often insignificant and uncontrollable kind are 
changed every moment more or less. These mistakes are trace- 
able to such “fluctuating errors;” the experiment was made after 
the numbers during half a year on the same machine had become 
““eranschaulicht,’ and it was observed that it was not always 
the same three pupils whose apprehension of two balls was not 
successful. Lay assumes that 3 mistakes in the experiment came 
from accidental circumstances, so the pupils are left 3, 6, 14, 22 
(mistakes) [instead of 6, 9, 17, 25, see table] in the apprehension 
of 3, 4, 5, 6 balls respectively. 
Lay regards the mistakes made with 2 balls as mistakes 
of fluctuating attention for reasons stated above, and so deducts 
3 from his results (total mistakes), assuming that the remainder 
are genuine mistakes of apprehension. Since 3 of 46 pupils, 
after a half year’s teaching, are able to apprehend in a row not 
more than 3 balls and to represent (the same) by means of dots 
after the perception; and since 6 pupils display the same 
inability relative to 4 balls, therefore, from the standpoint of 
teaching practice: 
For these school classes the number 3 marks the limits of appre- 
hension for rows of balls. 
3. Didactical experiments concerning counting and the count- 
ing method.—On the basis of an extensive experimental research]

“the number comes about only through counting,” is false. It is 
not unexpected that the counting methodists and their disciples 
should hesitate to admit that they are found in a grave error. 
But it is necessary here to emphasize that their attacks appear 
ill-advised since they put little confidence in the experimental- 
didactical research and did not give themselves the trouble to 
read the Fithrer attentively. Two counting methodists, Dr. Hart- 
ann and Supervisor Knilling, have busied themselves with the 
‘ihrer exhaustively. Knilling is the only counting methodist 
who has investigated the problem in an experimental way. 
nfortunately his procedure was mistaken and we will show only 
riefly that his experiments are inadequate to refute the Fiihrer. 
[I quote here the first two of three experiments.] 
Knilling. Exp. I. 
An adult was required to place next to a dot and under it (pre- 
erving on the whole a triangular form) in a horizontal direction 
rst 2, then 3, then 4 dots [thus, -. .:. ....]. As a result, 
nilling records: the person solves the question in regard to 
he total number of recorded dots with difficulty. This is easily 
‘onceivable: : 
(r) The dot groups used are wholly inappropriate for nu- 
erical apprehension. They are not at all didactically useful 
umber pictures. 
(2) Each was given in successive parts, not as a whole. 
(3) The subject does not know that he must determine and 
eproduce the group as a total picture; the einstellung of the 
enses and of the consciousness for abstraction, analysis and syn- 
hesis, as the number apprehension demands them, are not at 
and. 
nilling. Exp. II. 
Six boys of the 3d school year were required to place strokes 
ext to dots; first next-to 1, then to 2, then to 3, then to 2, then  
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  160 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
to 1, [thus: I . The pupils were required and 
were able .j .| .i -| .i4 “tomark again from memory” this 
group of g dots in the same way. Immediately, according to the 
tally, the total was asked for. 
Result.—Knilling had to hear “‘a pair of false answers” and the 
abler pupils confessed besides that they had to reckon out the 
number in the head. 
This experiment also missed entirely the already named con- 
ditions. The pupils said themselves that they had not compre- 
hended the Sefzwngen; that to them the numerical compre- 
hension 9 arrives subsequently out of the image ae for, not 
against, the Zahlbilder. : 
Lay’s experiments to show that the claim that number arises 
only through counting is false (p. 97 ff. book) follow: 
In order to obtain information concerning the apprehension of 
quadratic pictures through children who are not yet school-bound, 
Lay instituted his experiments with children of the kindergarten, 
He saw beforehand that in this case it was best not merely o 
outer but also on inner grounds to use not mass (class) but indi 
vidual experiments. He used in these experiments little sheets 
which he could cover with the hand. On these were placed th 
quadratic pictures with ink. The circles had a diameter of 4 cm. 
the distance was equal to the diameter and the intervals betwee 
the quadrats 13 diameters. The pictures were exposed by remov- 
ing the hand and after } to 1 second were covered again. Th 
children were told that they should draw with a pencil on th 
slate lying ready the dots which they came to see, and that th 
point at issue is “how many.” (Four out of eight experiment: 
are here given.) 
Lay. Exp. I. 
A girl 6 years old, 3 years in the kindergarten, after a singl 
exposure, drew the exhibited pictures, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 10 correctl
-P-A-G-E-173

     from the image. Before drawing the 7 the child was asked 
concerning the number of dots. But the child knew not how 
many dots there were yet . . . drew them correctly. It 
had therefore the clearly defined image but not its name. Twelve 
after 5 exposures was not correctly symbolized; 8 and 1o dots 
were made, but many dots were placed one after another in 
varying ways. 
Lay. Exp. I. 
A boy 6 years old, after two exposures, grasped the number 
icture 7. He did not know the number name but found it by 
counting out of the image and then wrote it correctly under the 
icture. The picture to he could not count out of the image but 
e drew it correctly, not knowing afterward how many he had 
rawn until he counted with a loud voice the dots in his pic- 
ure. The picture 12 required 3 exposures. The number name 
as unknown, nevertheless the boy recorded the 12 correctly. 
e had obtained a clear image without counting or number 
ords. The picture 13 he recorded incorrectly after 7 ex- 
osures; he drew 12 or placed as many dots as possible one after 
he other. 
ay. Exp. Il. 
A boy 3-4 years old, able to count to 10, one year in the kinder- 
arten, for 3 made the first time merely a dot, the second time 3 
ots in a row; did not know the number name. Four and 5 were 
orrectly represented, 6 after 5 exposures (1 to 2 sec.) was cor- 
ctly recorded, without knowledge of the name. 
ay. Exp. IV. 
A girl 4 years old, 3 weeks in the kindergarten, was able 
record from memory 2, 3, and 5 after four exposures and 4 
fter two exposures. Five was at first counted as 6; at a second 
posure she counts only 4; but at the third she counted 5 from 
e image.

      These experiments with children who had received as yet no 
instruction are otherwise interesting and important; they show: 
(a) That the numbers presented by means of the quadratic 
pictures can become easy for not yet school-bound children, 
firmly grasped without practice, impressed on the memory, 
imaged, and symbolized by drawing; 
(b) That the number images embrace the entire first ten 
numbers, the foundation of elementary arithmetic, and even 
reach above the same, while the row images reach only 3; 
(c) That clear and living images without counting in the usual 
sense come about, persist, and can be symbolized in drawing. 
Very clearly is this shown in a case where the child can onl 
count to 4, but grasped 6 unities clearly, imaged and symbolize 
them in drawing from memory (Erinnerung). 
4. Comparison of row pictures and the number pictures 0: 
Born.—The purpose of this experiment is to compare the visual 
apprehension of a number of circles arranged in a single row pre 
sented simultaneously, with that of an equal number of circle: 
arranged in a group by double rows. [For example, 4 was pre 
sented at one time, thus:----; at another time, thus: : : 
five.....- was compared with : : °, etc.] 
The conditions of the experiment for the comparative presen. 
tations were made the same in the following way. For eac 
number a picture was presented on a separate sheet of paper, on: 
picture of the number being according to the single row arrange 
ment, the other the double row grouping of Born, the same kin 
of paper being used for all the sheets. The surfaces of the circle 
were blackened with India ink. The diameter of the circles wa: 
46 mm. and the distance epart equal to the radius. In the sing] 
row pictures after 5 the distance between circles was made equ 
to two radii. 
A wooden blackboard was placed on the desk, on which wal 
fastened behind a screen a row or a group picture. With the tick|

of the metronome the operator counted twice “1, 2” beforehand. 
At the count of 1 following, the screen which covered the picture 
was dropped as far as necessary and at the count of 2 following, 
was. raised again to cover the picture. The pupil: 
now recorded what they had seen. After a pause, the sami 
thing was repeated with another picture. The order o: 
presentation is given in the accompanying table (page 163). Th 
pupils were occupied at a time one hour at the most. A prelimi. 
nary practice experiment was given to remove disturbing element: 
at the beginning of an experiment. 
Although the children had had a half year’s instruction, bot! 
kinds of pictures used in this experiment were unfamiliar to th 
pupils of the first school year, except that for the numbers 1 to 
they had had presented to them the number pictures of BOhm: 
in which 4 and 6 are the same as in the Zasilbilder of Born; thei: 
practice besides this was with the Russian machine and thei 
fingers. [For number picture of Béhme, see Appendix VIII.]

    Conclusion —The results of these experiments show undeni- 
ably that the Born group pictures are superior to the 
after-5-interrupted row pictures as Anschawung or counting 
material. Other experiments which follow and pursue other 
purposes will without exception directly or indirectly confirm 
these results. 
5. Comparison of Born pictures with the other pictures in com- 
mon use. The Born pictures will be used in the comparative ex- 
eriments [of the next section (6)] because they are distinguished 
by great superiority in comparison with other pictures [in 
common use]. 
1. They are all without exception constructed according to a 
ingle fundamental plan, the second dot comes vertically under 
he first, the third to the right above near the second, the fourth 
ertically under the third, the fifth to the right above near the 
ourth, etc. 2. All smaller pictures appear in unchanged form as 
constituents of all the larger. 3. The process of apprehension is 
n all pictures equal and simple; the apprehension, the reproduc- 
ion of the image, the written or bodily symbolization of all pic- 
ures are equally simple and easy. 4. Each picture illustrates 
he several calculations in similar, simple ways and the results, 
s already impressed pictures, can immediately be determined. 
he reader may convince himself of the correctness of these 
tatements regarding the Born pictures [by an inspection] and 
fter this compare with them the several pictures of Béhme, 
entschel, Sobelewsky, Kaselitz, Beetz on the basis of the 
joints named, especially relative to the processes of division, 
ddition, subtraction and multiplication. It is important that 
lhe reader carry out this comparison. [For the pictures, see 
ppendix VIII.]

for rows of balls, which agrees with the account of Beetz, leads 
to the following preliminary observations: 
The Born number pictures are double rows, but still rows;

since the apprehension of a row of balls extends to 3 only, so th 
Born pictures which show more than 3 pairs, that is to say, th 
pictures 7, 8, 9, 10 cannot be any more surely grasped, image 
and symbolized [than pictures above 3 in single rows]. A 
arrangement of double rows in groups of 3 pairs would be o 
doubtful value since the 3 cannot be grasped with facility b:

       the corner dots (represented as balls) of 3 neighboring quadrats, it 
is conceivable that in this form 3 times 4 unities can be grasped. 
These quadratic pictures maintain in contrast to the Born 
a wholly new character. The question is whether the fore- 
going a priori conclusion proves itself as a matter of fact 
correct. This can be decided only by experiment. 
The Auschauungsmittel (materials) which were selected as the 
basis of the experiment were black circle surfaces on white draw- 
ing paper, 22 mm. in diameter and a radius apart, and the quad- 
ratic pictures prepared in corresponding ways; in their case the 
intervals between each quadrat was made equal to a double ra- 
dius: It is necessary to admit that psychological conditions for 
the two kinds of apprehension in the experiment are different. 
The Born pictures are at a great advantage over the quadratic’ 
pictures. In a previous experiment they have been repeatedly 
apprehended by the pupils, besides they have a pronounced row| 
character and the row apprehension has been much exercised 
the apprehension of quadratic pictures above 4 is as yet entirel 
new and only above this does Lay extend comparative experi 
ments. A comparatively small balance in favor of the quadrati 
pictures will therefore show a considerable superiority of the same 
(For the quadratic number pictures of Lay, see Appendix VIII. 
Conclusion.—Considering the advantage which the Born pic. 
tures in the experiments possessed, the quadratic pictures ar 
considerably superior to the Born. [See table with summary 
pp. 166, 167.] 
7. Comparison of the Beetz and the quadratic pictures.—Bee 
did not use the customary number pictures but in his Zahltype: 
he constructed new pictures which according to his opinio: 
answered all demands. But the comparison of the Born picture 
with other pictures [in common use, see sec. 5 above] brought th 
conclusion that the Born pictures show great advantage ove 
these, including those of Beetz. But Beetz is of the opinion tha)  
-P-A-G-E-181
Didactical Studies 169 
  is pictures surpass all others in usefulness. It was, therefore, 
mportant to show how the matter stands as to the relative ap- 
rehensibility of the Beetz and the quadratic pictures. 
Beetz pictures were prepared in a way analogous with the 
lready used quadratic pictures, both in a larger form with 33 cm., 
uadratic side, and in a smaller form 19 cm., quadratic side. 
It should be noted that in the first experiment on second-year 
raining school pupils, r9 (of the 28) incorrectly represented 
pictured) the Beetz pictures. This was not counted a mistake 
as long as the correct number of dots was represented) , but before 
he second experiment was tried the several Beetz pictures were 
eld up so that all could take a good look. These pupils confessed 
hat after they had understood the composition of the pictures 
hey no more sought to grasp the pictures as a whole, but having 
oted only the points in the middle, they then in their representa- 
ion filled in the outline. Such a partial grasp has never taken 
lace in the quadratic pictures; from the very first they produced 
nuch fewer mistakes than the Beetz pictures in this experiment. 
Conclusion.—The quadratic pictures are significantly superior 
the Beetz, indeed still more than the figures of the table 
. 170) show. 
8. Comparison of quadratic pictures, of Born pictures and the 
ussian machine.—On the Russian machine first the yellow and 
en the black balls were used in experiments with second-year 
aining school pupils. They had a diameter of 4.5 cm.; there was 
background. After the fifth ball was left a small space. The 
orn pictures were presented on the Wendling apparatus. The 
‘ay pasteboard disks had a diameter of 14 cm. and were 10 cm. 
stant from one another in a horizontal direction and 16 cm. 
a vertical. Since we know that the quadratic pictures are 
perior to the Born, the comparison of the Wendling apparatus 
th the Russian machine is an indirect comparison of the 
adratic pictures with the latter,

Results —Comparison of Russian machine with quadratic pic- 
tures: 
Exp. 1.—First-year training school pupils (30), used as 
subjects. In this experiment the quadratic pictures were 
presented on the machine. Time of exposure not stated. 
R-P 120 38 mistakes (Numbers 6 to 9, presented 
Q-P 120 8 mistakes once in each series, in ir- 
regular order.) 
Exp. 2.—Subjects, second-year training school pupils (22). 
Time of exposure, $ sec. 
(a) R-P 154 55 mistakes (Numbers 4 to 10, pre- 
Q-P 154 12mistakes sented once in each ser- 
ies in irregular order.) 
(b) R-P 110 yellow, 20 mistakes (Numbers 4 to 8,

Q Presentations 384 mistakes 23 
For results of comparison R and W see table on page 172. 
Schneider’s work (Die Zahl im grundlegen Rechenunterricht,

R 460 mistakes 
Born 71 mistakes 
Conclusion.—The results show that the quadratic pictures sur- 
lass the Born and are vastly superior to the Russian machine; 
so that the apprehension of things in rows affords far more 
ifficulty than the apprehension of things in groups.

9. Comparison of quadratic and Born pictures with strokes, 
fingers and the Tillich apparatus.—The numbers 4-10 were with 
black ink on seven sheets of drawing paper represented by strokes. 
In the size and distance the wall-tables of head-teacher Bilharz 
in Karlsruhe were used as a guide merely for the purpose of 
arriving at a numerically established judgment concerning the 
value of this teaching material which has been introduced it 
Karlsruhe and elsewhere. The surface of a stroke is 7} cm. lon! 
and 2 cm. wide. The distance between the strokes amounts t 
half the width of a stroke; after each group of fiv 
strokes, a space equal to the width of a stroke was left, 
The quadratic number pictures which were used wer 
arranged to correspond. The circle surfaces and the strokes ha 
equal areas and the distances were placed in similar relation 
In the experiment with fingers a pupil covered his eyes with hi 
hand or with a book, while his neighbor placed the number o 
fingers shown by the operator on the bench before him. 
After the operator had counted 1, 2 twice with the beats of th 
metronome the number of fingers was looked at and at thé nex’ 
beat the neighbor drew the fingers back. 
The necessary preliminary practice preceded the several 
experiments. 
Dr. Walsemann (56) found the following results which he ha 
recorded by the subjects numerically, not by drawings.

Born pictures, 34.5 mistakes 
The results show that the quadratic pictures are superior to th! 
stroke rows, to the fingers and the Tillich apparatus. 
These results also furnish new evidence that the apprehensio

   emory, and symbolizing of things offer more difficulty in row 
orm than that of things which are arranged in group form. 
The several experiments which have now been tried concerning 
he kind of spatial arrangement of things lead to the suspicion 
hat the numerical grasp of things also depends on other spatia! 
roperties, their distance apart, their size, and the direction which 
heir arrangement takes. To this conclusion physiological con- 
iderations also point, viz.: that the field of vision has certain 
imits and that the motor sensations of the eyes play a great réle 
in the apprehension of size and form. 
ro. The numerical apprehension of things, depending on their 
istance apart and marking.—The purpose in the examination of 
his relation of dependency is practical. The question at first 
as the psychologically advantageous form of the quadratic pic- 
ures, and in this the theoretical interest predominated; now we 
ome to the consideration of another point of view, viz.: the 
ractical. 
In order to learn the influence which the distances apart of 
e several things in rows or in groups have, the Russian machine 
ith yellow balls was used. There were 5 to 8 balls arranged 
de by side, first close, and then with a distance of rz cm. 
Result: 
31 First-year Training School pupils.

Another experimental arrangement which tested fatigue 
owed corresponding results. The 10 yellow balls of the caicu- 
ting machine were counted during 24 quarter-minutes.

ming together [of the balls (objects counted) |, made a note of the 
number [of the quarter-minute] which had been given out just 
before by a pupil who announced the quarter-minutes. 
[The announcer, guided by the metronome, at the end of th 
first quarter-minute said one, at the end of the second quarter 
minute said ‘wo and so on for as many quarter-minutes as migh 
be required before fatigue for all subjects set in. (As a matter o' 
fact in this experiment 16 of 31 pupils were not fatigued in th 
24 quarter-minutes so that the announcer had to count throug 
the whole 24). 
The subjects began at the beginning of each quarter-minut 
and counted 1, 2, 3 up to 10, then paused until the end of th 
quarter-minute, then counted again 1, 2, 3-10. 
The number of quarter-minutes counted through by eac 
fatigued subject before fatigue set in, as heard from the an 
nouncer and noted by the subject, was added to the numbe 
noted by each of the other fatigued subjects; the total was th 
record of the experiment]. 
The Russian machine, which has no back, stood 23 
distant from a bluish wall. In experiment 1 the balls had no di 
tance; in experiment 2 a distance of 1 cm., and in experiment 3 
blackboard was placed directly behind the machine. 
Thirty-one pupils of the second-year training school we: 
subjects; of these 16 were not fatigued; the other 15 yielded t 
following results:    
   
    
      
    
   
    
         
    Exp. 1. 165 Viertelsminuten 
Exp. 2. 206 Viertelsminuten 
Exp. 3. 218 Viertelsminuten 
In another experiment 17 second-year training school pupij 
counted 6 balls during 28 quarter-minutes at the distances apa 
(a) 13 cm. (b) 3 cm. The pupils who were fatigued before t 
28th quarter-minute reached the following numbers:
-P-A-G-E-189
  - Didactical Studies 177 
(a) 114 Viertelsminuten 
(b) 130 Viertelsminuten 
Of special interest was the study of the influence which the dis- 
ances apart of the circles in the quadratic pictures exerts on 
heir apprehension. Pictures with three different distances were 
sed. In the narrow pictures the circles were distant a half-diam- 
ter and the quadrats a diameter; in the medium pictures the dis- 
ance of the circles was equal to the diameter and of the quadrats 
¥ diameters; and in the wide pictures the distance of the circles = 
+ diameters and that of the quadrats = 2 diameters. The circles 
ere cut out of white drawing paper and pasted on black paper; 
hey had a diameter of 8cm. There were eight experiments, two 
ach in the first school year, in the first year of the training school 
nd in the third year of the same. No clear reaction was shown 
ith the narrow and medium pictures. The differences in the re- 
Its was insignificant; but a clear reaction occurred in favor of 
e wide picture. The narrow and the medium pictures were 
liso tested relative to fatigue [under the same conditions as de- 
ribed in the previous fatigue experiment]. Thirty second-year 
lupils of the training school counted the several circles in the 
mber picture nine up to 24 quarter-minutes. The pupils who 
this time-space became fatigued yielded the results: 
Narrow 285 Viertelsminuten 
Medium 208 Viertelsminuten 
Since it is desirable that the operations be indicated in the pic- 
res by a staff or a stroke, the medium pictures are to be pre- 
rred.

178 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
Conclusion—The distance of the quadrats from one another 
should not be too great in relation to the distance within the 
quadrats. The part at the right of the last of these distance: 
will not be apprehended if these are too great. 
In consideration of the fact that the parts are to be separate 
by a bar [rod, staff] [to indicate operations] the second of th 
foregoing arrangements recommends itself (x to 12). 
[Note.—Notwithstanding this recommendation the wide ar 
rangement has a smaller ratio between the distances than the on 
recommended (the medium). 
Narrow Ratior tor = 1 
Medium Ratio 2 to3 = 1 
Wide Ratio 3 to4 = 1 
bolt tole 
This seems to be a matter of threshold of the perception 
the quadrats as entities and of the field of vision. 
From the conclusion of Lay he seems’ to think that the mediu: 
presents the smallest ratio. His experiment tends to show, on tl 
contrary, that a greater ratio would be still more favorable.] 
Schneider and Dr. Walsemann have in their experiments wit 
quadratic number pictures entirely neglected this important co 
dition; therefore their experiments show nothing against t 
standard quadratic pictures. 
11. The numerical apprehension of things, depending on th 
size and distance. This is also a practical question. 
There were used for the solution of this question the alrea 
prepared medium pictures in which the circles had a diameter 
8 cm. and for comparison similar pictures were prepared in whi 
the circles had only 5 cm. diameter, but as for the rest had t 
[same] middle distances as the larger pictures [viz., 8 cm. a 
12 cm.].

le apprehension.

This result for our practical purpose, as we shall see later, is of 
significance. 
[Note.—Nevertheless, the difference between mistakes is 
greater than the summary in the Fiihrer shows and is slightly in 
favor of the 5 cm. It is also in favor of greater distances betwee! 
the dots (13 diam.) and between the quadrats, 23 diam.] 
‘ Since some methodists in their number pictures or perceptio 
material (e. g., the Tillich apparatus or the Russian machine 
arrange the unities vertically over one another, therefore it is 0 
significance from the standpoint of method to ask whether thi 
direction of the arrangement is indifferent, or, if this is not th 
. case, whether the vertical or horizontal direction should be use 
In order to gain through experiment an insight into this questio:

rows of circles were used which were fastened now horizontall

       The experiments show: 
The horizontal arrangement of the unities in the perception- 
aterial of number teaching is superior to the vertical. 
The result speaks against the vertical ““Zweierreihe”’ of Dienst- 
ach, against the vertical “Zahlziffern” of Mayer, against the 
everal “Zahlbilder” of Busse, BOhme, Hentschel, Sobelewsky, 
aselitz, Beetz. 
12. The numerical apprehension of things, depending on their 
rm and brightness.—It is clear that small strokes as individual 
ings can come into use in teaching practice only in the form 
f rows. But the apprehension of groups was found to be 
perior to that of rows so that apparently there is not much 
alue for teaching practice in further investigating the appre-. 
ension of circles or balls and that of strokes and rods; that is, 
e influence of the form of the individual things on numerical 
prehension. But it will be shown that even these practical 
vestigations are of significance and illuminate facts which we 
ready know from a new side. According to certain observations 
appears that short-sighted pupils must exert themselves more or 
lecome fatigued sooner inthe apprehension of stroke rows than 
the apprehension of circle-groups. At the same time a certain 
fluence of the vermilion color of the strokes in the Bilharz 
ckoning table was occasionally observed. In order to discover 
mewhat concerning the influence of stroke- and circle-form 
dat the same time concerning the white and black colors Lay 
stituted the following research. There were fastened 10 black 
rokes on white paper, ro white strokes on black paper, and 10 
ack circles on white paper. The strokes occur as in former 
periments, 73 cm. long and 2 cm. wide, and the circles have the 
me area as the strokes. The distance apart of all strokes and 
icles was made equal to half the width or equal to half the 
ameter. The pupils now proceeded to count through the rows 
m 1 to ro until definite appearance of fatigue set in, which  
-P-A-G-E-194

expressed itself in different individuals as delay, swimming to- 
gether (of the objects), color-change of the strokes, etc.

(c) Black circles on white paper 419 Viertelsminuten 
It is to be considered that in experiment c five pupils were no’ 
fatigued, and, besides that, this experiment was last conducte 
after already 16 minutes had been counted. The pupils asserte 
that they often could not easily get hold of a distinct stroke ii 
the row on account of the little distance between the stroke} 
(compare the experiments in section 4); that they confuse th 
stroke easily with the neighboring strokes on either side; tha} 
the confluence (of objects) and consequent strain are not prese’ 
in the case of the circle rows. The fact is that counting th 
strokes in the Bilharz tables (charts) was fatiguing in a high d 
gree; that, in other words, the apprehension is conjoined wit 
relatively proportionately greater strain (effort) and therefo 
the apprehension is hindered in comparison with the circle row: 
It has been shown that the simultaneous apprehension of ro 
by children of the first school year in most favorable cases reach 
to Three. It is now of interest to learn whether in the case 
older pupils it naturally reaches further and how it acts in tl 
apprehension of 5 to ro things which are arranged in a row. 
order to gain an insight into these relations the following expe 
ments with stroke and circle rows were conducted with the trai: 
ing school pupils of all three years. A small apprehension time

It turns out that the results of Experiments II and IV wi 
second- and third-year pupils do not agree with Experiment 
with first-year pupils, although the time of exposure is the sam 
This is explained in the following manner. With the first-ye 
pupils other experiments preceded the above mentioned one 
which the pupils were attentive to the intervals after 5. 
counting of the units was impossible. The pupils therefore

   he case of rows which exceeded 5 fastened their gaze only on the 
art (1 to3) after theintervals (which was aseasy tonote in strokes 
s in circles), and constructed the picture additively; a percep- 
ion or a memory or image of the whole is, that is to say, nowise 
resent and the representation (symbolization) of the number is 
n no way the expression of total image of the units. The com- 
aratively small number of mistakes in Experiment II came about 
n other words, through group-wise apprehension.. Among the 
econd- and third-year pupils, the intervals after 5 were entirely 
verlooked by a few pupils; since counting was impossible they 
erely estimated the number of strokes and circles, as they 
hemselves asserted. Now these had in the stroke rows fewer 
istakes than in the circle rows; the estimate of the stroke rows 
ame easier to them than the estimate of the circle rows (and in 
Ihe act of representing stroke rows by straight lines they are 
mited to the comparison and estimation of challenging surfaces, 
lhe judgment of whose interruptions is not so difficult as is the 
ase with circle rows). It is also to be considered that all pupils 
reviously had used the representation of numbers by strokes, 
ot by circles or dots.! 
The series of experiments has so far given this result: Ball and 
ircle forms are superior to the rods of Tillich and strokes. 
Exp. V. Ten vermilion strokes on green ground and ten 
black strokes on white ground were twice counted (that is, to 
20) by 31 pupils of the first-year training school. The number 
of repetitions was recorded for each pupil. [The pupils were 
to continue counting from 1 to 20 until fatigue set in to see 
how many times they could reptat]. 
1This explantion really shows that the conditions of Experiments II-IV 
re such as to invalidate the results; but the fatigue experiment preceding is 
lid and is slightly confirmed by Experiment I, which in itself is not conclusive. 
‘e are perhaps warranted on the whole, however, in accepting Lay’s conclusions.  
-P-A-G-E-198
  186 1 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
At the discontinuance of the experiment, which took place 
when in the great majority the appearances of fatigue made them- 
selves noticeable, it was shown that the red had shown only 272, 
but the black 428 repetitions; besides, 2 pupils could count 
the red strokes only three times and 4 pupils only four times. 
Conclusion.—The red strokes cause an effort of vision an 
therefore of attention and hinders the counting of strokes in rows 
(one may talk no longer of simultaneous apprehension in suc 
acase). Black strokes on white are better. Thus, the influenc 
of the color of the things to be grouped and the color of thei 
backgrounds cannot be neglected.         
   
     
   
   
   
   
       
       
        
    Exp. VI. We therefore next raise the questions: How act: 
Black on White, White on Black, Red on Green, Yellow o: 
Indigo, Blue on Orange? Furthermore, how act Red, Yello 
Green, Blue on Black ground ? 
/In these experiments ro strokes with known dimensions ani 
distances were always used. At a given signal, by a pupil whos 
duty it was to loudly count the minutes [guided by the metr 
nome], the number zero was spoken and the other pupils bega 
the exercise. At the end of each half minute [quarter or sixt 
minute] the total number of half [quarter or sixth] minutes w 
announced and noted by those who, by reason of fatigue, direct] 
after the announcement ceased to count. [In this fatigue-metho 
the pupils counted from 1 to 10 repeatedly, the speed of counti 
being regulated by the fraction of a minute allowed for each cow: 
(from 1 to 10). The greater the number of minutes or fractio 
of minutes counted through before fatigue set in, the more favo 
able the reaction.] The subjects were training school pupil

   13. Numerical apprehension of spatial things through the' 
sense of touch.—It is certain that the simple forms of quadratic 
number pictures are in themselves of advantage to the children; 
they are not monotonous and tiresome as the rows are; the 
afford much more variety, are simple, clearly arranged and there- 
fore easily grasped. The little faces, says Lay, shone with jo 
when the apprehension and representation of pictures were suc 
cessful but they appeared dissatisfied, fretful, disheartened an 
finally uninterested when time after time they failed in the ap 
prehension of the rows. The intuitive apprehension of rows an 
of processes is, as has been shown sufficiently, above 3 or 
simply impossible. Also the children find it difficult to conque: 
the tendency to illustrate by means of rows. If now the memor 
for the auditory word picture (Wortklangbild) and the speec 
motor image of the number words is not strong enough so tha 
results hold fast purely externally, then necessarily must bi 
shown loss of interest, dislike, taciturnity, antipathy, yea, insub 
ordination, while on the contrary, in number work with th 
quadratic pictures, interest and pleasure are ever present. 
The child finds pleasure in the mere placing and takin 
away of the buttons. Still more; since the compositio 
of the quadratic pictures is simple, the children procee 
of their own accord to the next number and seek the ne 
numerical relations just as the child, who has found a gre 
interest in reading, of himself goes further into a well-constructe 
primer. 
The Shah of Persia, as is well known, pities us Europeans b 
cause we do not eat with the fingers; the pleasure which the sen: 
of touch brings escapes us, if one does not feel the various foo 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  Didactical Studies 189 
        
   
           
   
       
   
    
     
    
    with reference to the qualitiesof tenderness, softness, etc. He may 
be right; since we know that different qualities of touch work zs- 
thetically, bring us satisfaction. 
The child makes use of all the senses and in the incitement and 
in the functioning of the same lies a high source of pleasure and 
satisfaction. One needs think only of the pleasure which the child 
finds in movement; the motor sensations are but sensations of 
touch through which the qualities of roughness and smoothness, 
lof angularity and roundness, etc., come into existence. 
* * * * * 
The experiments have repeatedly shown that the origination 
f the number image is bound up with spatial relations; therefore, 
it is certain that the touch sense plays a part therein. 
But also on other grounds is the proposition maintained. The 
rigination of the image presupposes the existence of things. In 
ovement the child meets with resistance and through the sensa- 
ion of resistance it knows somewhat of the foreign, something 
ot itsel/—an object. The resistance against movement (even 
in touch) thus causes the child to realize objective things. The 
mage does not actually enter the mind until the child can dis- 
inguish himself from things. In fact the teaching of blind chil- 
ren shows that number teaching can proceed entirely on this 
ense, and that with as little difficulty as with the seeing children. 
Exp. I. An experiment was instituted with boy K., who 
ttended the kindergarten and boy W., who had been in the first 
chool year three quarters of a year. After they had been 
lindfolded they laid their hands on the number pictures of the 
utton apparatus [an apparatus by means of which the unities of 
Ihe quadrats can be represented by circular -buttons]. They 
lecognized through simultaneous touch sensations, without 
ounting, comparatively quickly and certainly even the larger 
umbers.

Exp. IT. Haill the buttons both at a short distance (apart) 
and at no distance were arranged in rows. There was now shown 
an entirely similar relation as in the case of number apprehension 
through the sight sense: The direct simultaneous apprehensio 
reached only 3; the other longer rows were not grasped clearly, 
The number was obtained only through counting, not throug! 
direct perception. The apprehension of the small rows and th 
counting of the larger took place more quickly if the button: 
were placed a short distance apart.      
       
    
       
   
      
    
      
   
   
       Exp. III. These conditions on account of the need of makin, 
perception material which regards the touch sense were mor 
exactly investigated with children of about 6 years. 
The question was: at what distance will two touch impression 
still as two impressions, etc., and no longer as one impression b 
perceived. The Accaatt placed without regularity alternatel 
now both points, now only one point of a compass on the skin of 
5-year and 6-year-old boy and (the boys looking to one side) aske: 
them to state the number of impressions. On the finger tips at 
distance of 13 mm., on the under side of the middle knuckle at 
distance of 2 mm., and on the cheek at a distance of 20 mm, 
the number of impressions was still incorrectly determined. I 
the distance of te contiguous points on the underside of th 
knuckles amount d to 7 mm. it was rightly decided, and at a dis 
tance of about 12 mm. the decision for all parts of the under an 
upper hand surfaces was correctly given. 
In the absence of sight, the touch sense alone can by mean 
of the quadratic Paine obtain clear number-percepts up to 1 
But we know that an image the better clings in memory the mor 
it is associated with other images. Therefore, we should ass 
ciate, in the apprehension of number, with the percept an 
image of the sight sense, those of the touch sense; thus th 
teaching result will be better and more certain, and this result ca

Perceptional instruction and number teaching should be based 
n the touch sense and give opportunity for the touch sense in 
large measure to manifest itself; the pictures to which conveni- 
nce lends countenance, the strokes, the dots should only very 
paringly appear as perception material. The pupils should use

eption and image by means of Plastima and simple drawings 
ymbolize the same.

In the interpretation of these results in reckoning it is to b 
considered that to all pupils the separation and combination o: 
row pictures from the first attendance at school till now wer 
known and fully familiar, but that by all pupils the problem: 
to distinguish the smaller in the larger pictures were attacked fo 
the first time, and that several pupils who seldom took part in th 
experiments had seen the group pictures but seldom on the whol 
Thus it is ne doubt that the illustration of operations ani   the guidance to results on the ground of quadratic picture} 
proceed much more easily, quickly and certainly than is th 
case when rows are used. | 
Ludwig Pfeiffer (Exp. Padagogik, 2. Bd. 1905) has undertake' 
the problem: Born or quadratic number pictures for reckonin

the Born pictures; nevertheless, the following results were yielde

    Pfeiffer’s experiments confirm those of the Fiihrer and oppose 
he views of Schneider, Walsemann, Troelltsch and other advo- 
ates of the Born pictures. He says rightly, “The didactical 
xperimentation has hitherto consistently resulted (in this), that 
he illustration (presentation) in quadratic groups of four is 
etter, both for the apprehension of individual numbers and for 
he representation of the operations, than all other pictures, 
specially better than the simple double rows of Born.” 
Conclusion.—All the experiments conducted with training school 
upils and children of the first school year have shown that the 
uadratic pictures are superior to other known pictures and par- 
icularly to the rows. 
‘ ay’s conclusions from his investigations: 
1. As the capability of the child to obtain clear and distinct 
bject-images grows, the capability to grasp also grows. 
2. Homogencousness, arrangement, distance, size, color, posi- 
on of the parts, influence the apprehension of the number. 
3. Since nature offers no medium that furnishes all these 
cilities at once, in first number teaching a presentation medium 
ust be made in which this is the case. 
4. The presentation medium must make possible the simul- 
neous grasping of the objects not only through the sight sense, 
t also through the touch sense. 
5. The nature of the number image consists in the cognition of 
e existence of things, which are united in place or in time.

   to. As images that are connected with one another stick closer 
in memory, so it is of importance that the number apprehension 
through the sight sense should be connected with the apprehen- 
sion through the touch sense. 
11. The logical conviction through judgment has not the 
strength of the sensational conviction through perception. The 
sensational conviction of the individual existences can immedi- 
ately, simultaneously and therefore the more efficaciously follow 
lonly when the material things are arranged in quadratic number 
ictures. 
12. The feeling of certainty reached through the perception 
an be strengthened, if the number image of the material thing is 
upported not only by the sense of sight but also by the sense of 
ouch. 
13. The stronger the feeling of conviction, the stronger grows 
he interest, the energy, the pleasure, and love of reckoning, and 
he better is the result of instruction. When this feeling is lack- 
ng there is loss of interest, lack of energy, dejection, aversion, 
istaste and the instruction result is poor. 
14. The true content-full number image is intimately con- 
ected with the “symbolical number image,” for example, with 
any formal speech images, with the sound picture of the speech- 
otor image, with the written picture (figures) and the writing 
otor image of the number word and with many conceptual 
ages which correspond to the properties of the numerically 
pprehended things. The total image of a number is, that is to 
ay, put together from speech images, formal or symbolical 
ages, and from conceptual or content-full partial images. 
15. The partial speech images in the total image of a number 
pport the memory of the number image and supply, by quick, 
ady reckoning, the conceptual image. 
16. The properties of the number images are determined 
rough the kind of illustration and instruction. Of these circum-

  stances, which are of the greatest importance for the origin of the 
number, the nature of the number is independent; however, they 
influence considerably the view of the nature of the number.

    about through direct perception; the number images of all num 
bers which are above 10, through the imaging of the car 
dinal numbers in connection with the groups or sorts of tel 
systems. 
18. Origin of the number and the nature of the number are t 
be sharply divided. The nature of electricity and the nature o: 
number have primarily to be worked out by the theoretica 
physicist and the theoretical psychologist. Methodology of num 
ber instruction and technique of electricity can, however, exist 
before the questions about the nature of the number an 
the nature of the electricity are solved. It is indispensable fo: 
the methodist, the psychological technologist, to learn to kno 
the conditions of the origin of number and its influences, as it i 
necessary for the electrician, the practical technologist, to b 
able to make exact computation about the conditions of the origi 
of an electrical current. Until the present, the number methodis 
have proceeded Hic the various theories about number concep 
and from a few untrustworthy observations and, general psychi 
logical facts, if they have had any guide or basis for the teachin] 
procedure in first number instruction. We have, however, show 
that many of these theories and, therefore, also the resulti 
teaching procedure are false. Supported by much investigatio} 
I have presented (elsewhere) a theory about the nature of numbe 
but I am careful about building the method upon this theor:

instruction in which the methodical steps and their quantitative 
esults shall be closely controlled and compared. 
It is possible in teaching spelling, as well as in teaching 
rimary number, to know how to clarify the confusion of opin- 
ons concerning method only through foundations which have 
een built independently of untrustworthy experience and waver- 
ng theories, through objective, quantitatively determined facts. 
Supplement to review of Lay’s investigation.—In order to 
ring the comparative results of the investigation, regarding the 
est means of presentation of the cardinal numbers, together 
or convenience of reference, I.have gathered up the data from 
he several experiments bearing on this point, especially with first- 
ear children, and placed them in a single table (p. 198). For 
e Born and Lay pictures the training school pupils have 
Iso been included. 
A comparative graph (p. 199) has been drawn for first-year 
hildren. 
For first-year children, if one considers, as I have, all of the 
xperiments yielding data regarding the apprehension of the Lay 
s. the Born pictures (and not merely the experiment in section 6 
which they are directly compared) the Born pictures show 
ightly superior (35% of error as compared with 40%). But on 
e whole the rate or error is 15% for the Born and 13% for the 
luadratic (see table). The curves of relative apprehensibility are 
most precisely the same. In computing these per cents, the data 
ven by the use of the Wendling apparatus is excluded since the 
ay pictures were not presented by a similar apparatus. The 
paratus shows surprising superiority over the usual means of 
esentation, 24% as against 35% for first-year children, and 6% as 
ainst 8% for older ones. Doubtless a machine makes it possible 
render the presentation more vivid and grips the attention better. 
otice the good showing of the Russian machine. Lay’s pro- 
sed apparatus for presenting the quadratic pictures demands, 
erefore, our very serious attention. (See page 179, Fithrer.)

One wonders whether Lay presented his pictures with the 
trokes inserted. If so, he has probably added a handicap to the 
ne mentioned by him in section 6 and so decreased the admit- 
edly small measure of superiority of his pictures over those of 
orn, assuming that the Born pictures were nakedly presented.

y analyzing the mistakes made by the pupils in our own experi- 
ents (see part II, pp. 241-243) it has been found that the strokes 
xercise an influence in this particular at least, that the oblique 
trokes increase the difficulty of apprehension, the presence of 
ore than two vertical strokes has a similar tendency, and the 
osition of a single stroke, whether vertical or oblique, seems some- 
imes to help, sometimes to hinder.

    IA. EXPERIMENTS WITH SCHOOL CHILDREN, First to EIGHTH 
Graves, TO DETERMINE ABILITY IN NUMBER 
APPREHENSION. 
These experiments with children from the lowest primary grade 
to the last year of the elementary course were conducted in a city 
chool by the writer personally in every instance, so that the 
onditions and procedure were carefully kept uniform throughout. 
‘are was used to so distribute the exercises that none should be 
rolonged to the point of fatigue. In the lower gradcs particu- 
arly the exercises were so sectioned off that no section demanded 
ore than 15 to 20 minutes. They were usually given in the 
orning, but not regularly so, since before proceeding very far 
ith the work it was discovered that the pupils hailed the 
xperiments as a welcome change from the regular routine, what- 
ver the time of day. 
Materials.—The materials used were number pictures (quad- 
atische Zahlbilder) constructed after the manner of Lay’s pic- 
ures. Black circles one inch in diameter were pasted on white 
ardboard, a separate card being prepared for each number from 
to 12. The strokes between circles used by Lay to indicate 
perations were also reproduced, although they possess little or 
0 significance for the investigation. The children were told to 
isregard them when viewing a card. 
The series of cards is pictured on the next page. 
In each square group (quadrat) of four circles, on the cards as 
nstructed, the distance between the circles forming the sides of 
e square was 2 inches; and the distance between the quadrats, 
inches: the ratio between the two distances was thus made: 
:3 = 43. This happens to be the same ratio as that recom-

     mended by Lay, although it was arrived at independently of him. 
(In this connection, see the comment on Lay’s mistaken interpre- 
tation of the results of his experiment on these relative distances, 
p- 178.) : 
To determine the distance between the quadrats which would 
serve to render the quadrat a distinct entity, I called to my assis- 
tance several teachers, and, showing them, about 15 feet away, 
everal cards already constructed with different distances, asked 
hem to say whether the circles on each of the several cards were 
longitudinally at equal or unequal distances apart. By this means 
card was finally selected which was judged rightly every time as 
ontaining unequal distances; furthermore, the observers placed 
he inequalities where they belonged, viz., between the quadrats. 
he selected card, then, was the one containing little more than a 
lust noticeable difference between the quadrats (the next lower 
istance was 2% in., at which the inequality was sometimes 
oticed) and contained the measurements given above (2 : 3). 
he important point in this connection is that the distance be- 
een the quadrats shall be great enough to enable the observer to 
istinguish the quadrats as such, instead of perceiving the circles 
is mere double rows; on the other hand, the distance must not be 
reater than necessary for the purpose of such distinction, other- 
ise there is danger in the representation of the larger numbers of 
laving a card so long that part of it will fall outside of the angle 
vision. The same danger obviously obtains if the distance 
tween the circles within the quadrat is too great, though other- 
ise this distance is immaterial. For experimental purposes I 
ade this distance 2 inches, so as to be certain that the unities of 
e quadrat (and of the whole picture) should be very distinctly 
stinguished by any pupil present possessing normal vision. 
ear-sighted pupils were brought near, as whole classes may be in 
gular work.) This distance occasioned cards of rather awkward 
ngth for regular class work, but not so long as to require a shift- 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  206 | Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
ing of the eyes to bring the whole of the number within the field of 
vision. The number 12 occupied a longitudinal distance of 1 
inches; the number 10, 15 inches. (Of course, the matter of angl 
of vision was partly governed by the distance of the chart fro 
the observers.) For regular class work smaller distances betwee’ 
circles and quadrats (preserving a proper ratio) and perhap: 
somewhat smaller circles would be more convenient. 
In order to regulate the time of exposure the forty-five card 
were mounted on sheets of heavy manila paper, fastened togethe| 
at one end in the slot of a wooden rod. The chart thus co 
structed was supported at any height desired (say © feet) b 
inserting in a hole halfway between the ends of the rod a vert 
cally movable upright iron rod resting in the socket of a thre 
legged base and pinioned there by means of a screw-clutch. T! 
alternate sheets of the chart were left blank. Grasping a sheet 
the bottom and lifting it over the top, the operator allowed it 
drop on the other side, exposing at will a card or a blank. T 
blank sheets served as curtains to shut off the view at the end 
the time of exposure. 
Purpose.—The purpose was to test wnder schoolroom conditio 
the numerical apprehension of the pictures of Lay. What 
included under the term “apprehension” has been set forth 
our review of Lay’ s experiments. 
As is obvious, this is a test of how successfully a group of thin 
can be grasped when simultaneously presented. Lay recogni 
and quotes the pioneer investigations of Kiilpe, Cattell, Diet 
Warren, Messenger, Nanu, and others, which we have elsewh 
(pp. 6, 62) reviewed; these were undertaken from the point 
view of pure psychology, and while they have some pedagogi 
bearing they had no special didactical purpose. He has also b 
at considerable ‘pains, as we have seen, to show experiment 
with school children the superiority of the quadratic pictures 0 
those of Pestalozzi, Busse, Born, Béhme, Hentschel, Sobelews!

    Kaselitz, and Beetz and over the rows of the Russian machine and 
other numeral apparatus. Accepting his conclusion on these 
points, the question remains, does counting (of successively pre- 
sented things) play no part in the attainment of number ideas? 
(Lay does not deny (nor can any one) that counting plays a large 
art. Our review of the investigation of Phillips (see pp. 8-11) 
as shown that the child enters school with the counting psy- 
hosis well established, even in cases to the point of obsession; 
t would be folly to ignore the fact or to do otherwise than wisely 
o take advantage of it. But that this is the only or most eco- 
omical way in which number can be attained, Lay emphatically 
enies, and furthermore, as we have seen, ke has shown that it 
an be obtained in another, more economical way. 
It might be supposed that since Lay places so much stress on 
is quadratic pictures that he would have them take the place of 
ealing, visually or tactually, with things themselves. Such, 
owever, is not his plan. He says (Fiihrer durch den Rechenun- 
erricht, p. 137), “Der Anschauungsunterricht und der Rechenun- 
erricht miissen vor allem Kérperliche Dinge zu Grunde legen und 
elegenheit geben, dass auch der Tastsinn in ausgedehntem 
asse sich bethatigen kann; die Bilder, die Bequemlichkeit 
orschub leistern, die Striche, die Tupfen diirfen nur in. sehr 
eschriinktem Masse als Anschauungsmittel auftreten. Wohl 
ber muss der Schiiler geiibt werden, alle riumlichen Dinge, 
ie zur Anschauung kommen, sowohl aus der Anschauung als 
uch aus der Vorstellung durch Plastima und einfache Zeich- 
ungen darzustellen.” 
The use of the number pictures, then, follows or accompanies 
e seeing, counting, handling of objects; through practice with 
em the ability to grasp groups is strengthened; moreover, 
e thesis is that through them percept (Anschauung), image 
orstellung) and symbolization (Darstellung) all are brought 
jout with economy of time and effort. Furthermore, since

must grow out of clear images, it is important that the images bi

ing categories, under which may be subsumed by children al 
their early numerical experiences. It may be admitted that con 
cepts of a certain sort would come in time to children confined t 
the more primitive and wasteful counting method, but the con 
cept would be unrepresentable by any economical (groupwise 
symbolization, would be slow in arriving, and would be undeni 
ably less tangible and referrable to any clarifying content. 
It may be assumed, on the basis of what has been said abov: 
that numerical concepts develop, pari passu, with the growth 
numerical apprehension (Anschauung und Vorstellung) so tha 
the measure of the growth of apprehension may be taken as th 
measure of the growth of concepts. At this early stage, the child’ 
thinking is fundamentally imagining and it would be difficult t 
draw the line between his images (Anschauliche Vorstellungen 
his conceptual images (begriffliche Vorstellungen), and his co 
cepts (Begriffe). 
Procedure.—The purpose being to work under school condition: 
5 seconds was taken as the time of exposure for each card. Th 
is about the time observed to be taken by several teachers i 
leafing over number or phonetic cards under ordinary circu 
stances. In some of the preliminary experiments 3 seconds w: 
used, but with the apparatus at hand it was found difficult to kee 
the time uniformly at 3 seconds, and, also, the results differe 
scarcely at all from those of 5-second exposures. 
Tests were also given in which, for the purpose of comparis 
with tests given with this uniform time, each card was given 
different time, varying from 3 to 12 seconds. 
Lay’s exposures under laboratory conditions (using the metr 
nome for timing) varied from '/2 sec. to °/is sec. Of course, su

without counting) as a “placing” (Setzung) both in its unitary 
nd its total aspect, was clearly imaged and symbolically repre- 
ented both as an Einheitensetzung and a Gesamtsetzung (but not 
ecessarily numerically described); and this certainty was neces- 
ary for his purpose. But for our purpose it was only necessary 
o be reasonably sure that no counting or not much took place. 
$ a matter of fact, it was observed that 5 seconds was too short a 
ime in which satisfactorily to use a counting method, and while 
{tempts at counting were noticed they were usually cut short by 
e dropping of the curtain and errors of record followed. An- 
ther variation from the procedure of Lay was the manner of 
cording. Lay, for the sake of his first-year children who knew 
either written number words nor figures, required the drawing of 
he number picture after each presentation, but he also retains 
€ same method with older children (training school pupils); 
(0,”’ says he, “hatte ich durch die Darstellung des Zahlbildes die 
chere Gewiihr, dass die Zahl nicht durch Abschitzen bloss er- 
ten wurde.” For careful investigation perhaps this was neces- 
ry, but not for school practice. Our records, sufficiently accur- 
e no doubt, were made in figures by all children except these in 
e first half of the first school year. The latter were instructed 
draw as many circles as they saw, and drawings otherwise cor- 
t were accepted as without error no matter what form the 
lawing took. In fact, many of the drawings were in single 
$, not always of circles, but sometimes of crosses or strokes. 
a matter of mere apprehension numerically, this was regarded 
eminently satisfactory, though not favorable to economical 
aging and representing. Lay was quite willing to accept similar 
ults, as he says (55, p. 102) “Altere Schiiler trotz Verbots, 
ewusst, die gewonnene Zahlvorstellung zuweilen nicht bildich, 
dern durch Ziffern oder in Reihen dargestellten.”

The cards were invariably presented according to the followin 
formula for each card: Ready! Now! Write! Pencils down 
“Ready” was the signal that a card was to be exposed, pupil 
took pencils from top of desk; at the same time the operato 
grasped at the bottom the hindmost sheet of the chart ani 
lifted it to the level of the top of the chart, holding it in such 
position that the card which it contained was still out of sight; 
moment later the operator said, “Now!” and at the same tim| 
dropped the sheet on the front side, exposing the card, and simu 
taneously with the dropping started a stop-watch; (grasping 
moment later the next hindmost sheet (blank) he lifted it in t 
same manner as the previous one); at the end of the time 
exposure, the operator dropped the blank sheet, which acted as 
curtain to shut off the view, and said,“Write!’”; the pupils then r 
corded on their papers (in the lowest primary Liane by drawing 
the other grades by figures) the number viewed by them, after 
short interval the operator said “Pencils down!” at which all p 
pils were required instantly to place pencils on the desk. 
The interval allowed for recording was but a few seconds, n 
long enough to admit copying from a neighbor; the pupils so 
learned that this was not the time for gazing around, if th 
wished to write anything. After “Pencils down! ” had been co 
plied with, there was no restriction on gazing, a privilege whi 
most availed themselves of keenly. Of course, a somewhat lon, 
interval was allowed, for recording, to the pupils of the lowest 
mary grade, whose records took the form of drawings. 
In order that no uncertainty might arise in marking the pap 
at the conclusion of the tests, the pupils were required to place 
record of each presentation in a certain place on the paper acco 
ing to a simple scheme which they easily Lo 
followed. 
In all of the experiments the numbers were presented in 
regular order, as follows:

Preliminary tests were given in all grades, using a different 
rder, to accustom the pupils to the method of procedure. No 
ecord was kept of the results of these tests. During this practice 
he operator acquired a dexterity in the manipulation of the stop- 
atch and sheets of the chart that enabled him to maintain a 
ufficiently accurate time of exposure.

ove) were not presented a second time to pupils of grade 1A.

The per cent column in the table and the general form of the

‘om a study of the curve is a knowledge of about where, so far as 
ese children are concerned, uncertainty ceases and certainty 
kes its place. This is somewhere between 4A and 3B (age 8 to 
). Beginning with 4A the errors are so few that the curve 
proaches very close to the abscissa, and may safely be regarded, 
think, as really the curve of attention; that is to say, in the 
sence of inattention these would be no errors and the curve 
ould coincide with the abscissa. It should be said that the tests 
ere given in the latter part of the term, so the 4A children, for 
ample, were approaching the end of their work for that grade;

    more reported perhaps, the children of 1A had had nearl 
a half-year’s schooling; only the children of 1A present from th 
beginning of the term are included in the table. 
The certainty ensuing to the children of 4A, it may be said, doe: 
not result in- this case from continued practice with number pic 
tures. Such practice is given in the school in grades 1A to 2 
inclusive (using pictures of the domino pattern) but no longe 
Whatever increase in power of apprehension of the numbers it 
this space may take place, therefore, in the subsequent year and 
half or so, is the result of general number work or simply of gro’ 
ing maturity. | 
Grade 4A appears to be a rather late period for the mastery 
the number space up to 12. It would seem that this certaint: 
might have come about earlier if the children had been practice 
with more favorable perception material (Anschauungsmitte 
from the beginning. The comparative experiments of Lay and t 
fewness of errors made on the whole by even the youngest of 01 
children with the quadratic pictures lead us to believe that wi 
such material sure apprehension would bloom several seaso 
earlier. Still it is problematical; some factors may enter into t 
development of the number concept that postpone it to a certa 
period of the child’s life regardless of favorable percepts. Only 
thorough trying out can settle the matter. 
It may occur to some that even the youngest pupils make 
very high score; 6% failure, 94% accuracy (for 1A) would be y 
garded in most kinds of school work as a mark showing appro: 
mate perfection. However, that is not the case in these tests 
our subsequent analysis of the results will show. The high score} 
occasioned by the comparative ease with which a few of the nu: 
bers are grasped. But other numbers present peaks of difficul 
which show that, on the whole, the number space involved is 
from being mastered. 
It is possible to compare the results from our tests of 1A

There is considerable difference between 39% of error, as 
own by Lay’s tests, and 6%. This is accounted for, of course, 
Lay’s short exposure time (/2 to 1 second). Even the training   hool pupils have 7% of error. Now as these older pupils (age 
to 18) certainly had at their mental stage clear concepts of the 
rdinal numbers, all their errors, aside from a few due to wander- 
g attention, must have been due to the short exposure time (*/s to 
11 sec.), If we compare their rate of error (7%) with the rate of 
e beginning children (39%), the ratio is approximately 1 to 51/»;

     and this is about the ratio in the case of our third year and begin 
ning children. A consideration of these facts leads us to suspec 
that Lay, in his anxiety to prevent counting, has somewhat over 
done the matter of shortness of exposure time; in short, that hi 
results would be more convincing pedagogically and quite a: 
accurate relatively, if his exposures had been somewhat longer. 
B. 
Our first table has given us some general results, and, impo 
portantly, has, so to speak, cleared the decks for action. We ma 
be permitted to drop the numbers 3 and 4 from all further consi 
eration; and to give only incidental attention to school grade 
above 3B. 
Confining our attention, then, to grades 1A to 3B and to th] 
number space 5 to 12, we shall next make a study of the relativ 
apprehensibility of the different numbers by all pupils of thes 
grades, and by the several classes of the different grades. 
The total number of mistakes and the percentage of error ma 
by the pupils of grades 1A to 3B inclusive, taken collectively, i 
the apprehension of each number from 5 to 12 isgivenin TableI 
following. Tables III, IV and V show the number of mistakes a 
percentage of error in each of the classes 1A to 3B for the sa 
numbers. Using the data in these tables the graphs Figs. 2, 3, 
and 5 have been constructed, Figs. 3, 4 and 5 being comparati 
graphs which will serve to make more specific the study of rel 
tive apprehensibility, both as between numbers and betwe 
grades. 
From Table I and Fig. 1 we deduced the general result thi 
the 250 pupils of grades 1A to 3B had not yet mastered the nw 
ber space 5 tor2. By an examination of Table II and Fig. 2, 
can discover in what particulars they have not mastered it. Nu 
bers eleven and seven are the most prominent foci of error, follows

valleys with eleven as the most prominent ean In our further 
analysis, it will appear that the eleven maintains its position as the 
chief source of error. It does not do this cue on the ground 
that it is a large number, for the larger /welve is apprehended more 
easily. Seven is facile secundus, in this group of pupils, as a 
source of error, but, as will appear later, does not maintain its}

ore rugged, the peaks are higher and the valleys deeper; that is 
o say, the relatively great numbers of mistakes made in this 
west grade render the graph much more striking as a curve of 
rror. In the order of difficulty of apprehension eleven (132% 
rror) again (as in the case of the whole group) occurs first, fol- 
wed by seven (9% error), nine (7%), ten (63%), twelve (45%), 
ve (4%), six (2%), eight (2%). 
It is not contended that small differences in the percentages of 
rror are of much significance. Fluctuations and distractions of 
{tention on the part of the pupil (especially in the lowest grades) 
Ind unconscious variations of the conditions of presentation on 
e part of the operator are more or less unavoidable and doubt-

of this group of 23 children. The result of the test can, however, 
be accepted without question in its larger aspects, viz., that 
eleven, seven, nine in the order named are the most difficult num- 
bers for the children of this grade. The difference in per cent of 
error between seven and nine is small and might be considered 
insufficient to justify the relative ranking given to seven and| 
nine, were it not that strikingly in the next higher grade (1B) th 
seven is more difficult than nine; and also in the group of pupil:

We are led to believe also that the small difference between ten 
nd nine is of significance, since the drop in the curve from nine 
o ten is constant in its appearance in each of the earlier grades 
(up to 2B inclusive). The number fwelve appears, for some 
eason, to be relatively easy for the 1A children, not much more 
ifficult than five. It will be remembered that twelve and ten

easier, something that does not appear in any of the other grades; 
in fact, in the very next grade above (1B), the relative position 0 
the two numbers is almost exactly reversed. However, I a 
inclined to believe in regard to ¢en that it is much more nearly o 
a par with fwelve than it appears to be; we have seen that fen i 
probably much more difficult than mine than it appears to be 
that is, fen is really easier than the curve shows it to be; of course 
if this be true, the explanation of the position of fen is that it haj 
received in the course of the tests more than its share of error 
of attention or of manipulation, so that really its apprehension i 
no more difficult than that of twelve. I am confirmed in my view 
to the true position of fen by the fact that Lay’s first-year childre 
found fen considerably more difficult than nine. Ihave gathere 
up the results of Lay’s tests of first-year children on the quadrati 
number pictures in the following table. See also graph, Fig.

Lay’s results have outstanding features of relativity th| 
resemble our own. The odd numbers seven and mine are consp: 
uously more difficult than the neighboring even numbers; five 
more difficult than six. But nine (and even ten) is more diffic 
than seven; and eight, which our children found so relatively ea: 
is not so relatively easy for Lay’s children. All this is accoun 
for by his short exposure time, which, of course, affects the p 
centages all along the line, but in a greater degree proportionat

in the case of the larger numbers. The effect is to raise nine (and 
ven fen) above seven, and to give the easy eight an additiona 
odicum of difficulty. It may be claimed also that our tests

On account of both of these facts, we are inclined to think tha 
our graph reflects the performances of first-year children unde: 
ordinary conditions better than that of Lay, though neither 
except possibly in their most outlying aspects, can afford a basi 
for absolute conclusions of universal validity; many more childre: 
need to be tested in order to establish a norm of absolute per} 
formance, and, at the last, the striking thing about this nor: 
would be that in these days of common belief in a plurality

   bility among individuals, no one would expect any individual oJ 
even any class to conform to the norm. Nevertheless, if the nu: 
ber pictures prove to have sufficient value as teaching material t 
make it desirable to use them much more liberally than is 
present the custom, doubtless the establishment of such a nor 
would be a distinctly valuable contribution to exact pedagogy; j 
that it would afford to teachersastandard which does not now exi: 
for measuring the performances of their pupils with this material 
In grade 1B, while the curve (Fig. 3) closely resembles that 
1A in its general aspect, the following changes may be note 
Ten has become about as easy as eight, in fact has become so mu 
easier than it was in rA that the ere stationary twel 
has its relation with it changed about; again seven has increas 
in ease so that it is no more difficult than /welve and nine comi 
closer to eight in ease of apprehension is no longer more diffic 
than twelve, though still, contrary to Lay’s results, more diffic 
than seven. The greatest growth in apprehension is in the nw 
bers seven, nine, ten and eleven as is shown by the following tal 
of comparative percentage of error. — 
As has been heretofore pointed out, the position of fen in t 
curve for 1A is doubtful, and it is therefore doubtful whether 
growth in apprehension is as vamp in the case of fen as 
appears to be, since ten is probably easier for rA than the c 
indicates.

   As might be expected, all of the numbers have suffered an in- 
rease in ease; six has become so easy as to be regarded as practi- 
ally mastered. But this does not mean that we can conclude 
hat six is mastered in grade 1B generally (the children of this

d been mastered by this particular group of 38 children; but 
at it is not fully grasped by all 1B children is shown by Table IV, 
ere it is seen that, especially in grade 2A, it still affords con- 
erable difficulty. The records of the individual children of this 
ade show that the mistakes on six are distributed among six 
ildren, three of whom make mistakes on no other number, and 
e of whom repeats a mistake on sé« when given an individual 
t. 
On the number space as a whole, 1B shows great increase in 
curacy, the rate of error decreasing from 6% in 1A to 2.3% in 
(See Table I). In grade 1A the relative apprehensibility was in 
following order, beginning with the most difficult (subject to 
alifications as heretofore discussed): eleven, seven, nine, ten, 
lve, five, six = eight; in 1B we find the order to be (subject to

In grade 2A, with five months longer school experience, t! 
pupils show a decided superiority over those of 1B, in the appr 
hension of the number space as a whole, but not so great as th 
of 1B over 1A. What increase the several numbers show

Twelve is so much easier for this group of 43 pupils than for 
that it has been restored nearly toa parity with fen (which it ha: 
the whole group of 250 pupils), and is no more difficult for th 
pupils than eight; eleven, showing the greatest increase in accura 
is now on a par with seven, which shows a smaller increase; six, 
has been noted before, is noticeably harder for this grade than 
either of the lower grades; five shows some improvement w 
nine and ten are practically stationary. In order of relativity 
numbers stand now in the folldedae b   rder:

The pupils of 2B, in their apprehension of the numbers five, 
ight, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve, show differences so small from 
A that they are probably of no significance, but show a slight 
crease in ease in the case of six and seven. The increase in six 
greater than ordinarily might be expected in passing from 2A 
2B on account of the anomalous position of sia in the curve for 
IA. Any attempt to differentiate 2B from 2A as to order of rela- 
vity would in view of these small differences be of doubtful 
alue. 
Reference to Table I shows on the whole little change’ for the 
tter in apprehension after grade 2A. The pupils seem to have 
ached a plateau, which extends through grade 3B, and only five 
onths later (in grade 4A) does it clearly appear that certainty of 
prehension for the number pictures 5 to 12 has ensued (see Fig. 
In this connection, the fact which has been referred to before 
at all drill with number pictures ceased in grade 2B may have 
siderable meaning. If this drill had been continued it is at 
st fair to presume, but by no means certain, that the pupils 
ight have reached certainty prior to grade 4A. 
An examination of Table Vand theaccompanying graph (Fig. s) 
Ids some anomalies which perhaps would not occur if this were 
tudy of a single group of pupils progressing through the grades 
m tA to 3B. The curves of 2B and 3A cross one another at 
eral points, and there appears to be actual retrogression in 
de 3A in the cases of the numbers five, seven, eight, and ten. 
wever, the differences in accuracy on these numbers between 
two classes is so small that the most that can be concluded is 
t at least there has been no progress. Six and twelve have 
ained practically stationary, while undoubted progress has 
n made in nine and eleven. Grade 3B presents what may be 
jarded as real anomalies; the curve cuts that of both 2B and 3A, 
wing that 3B is poorer than 3A on the number fen and still 
rer than 2B, in fact finds fen the hardest of all the numbers;

able. No decided progress over 3A is shown in the case of a 
number. These anomalies may be laid to the idiosyncrasies of 
class differing, as all the classes have, from its predecessors in i 
composition. Indeed, the scores all along the line should 
regarded as partially due to these varying individualities, so th 
the graphs for any class are not precisely what they would ha 
been had the same group of individuals been studied through 
succession of school terms. Any language used in the foregoi 
discussion that seems to imply that we are here studying the 
velopment of such a group has been used for convenience. Suc 
study, of course, would require several years and has so far as t 
writer knows nowhere as yet been attempted, but would be w 
worth while. With such a procedure, the anomalies in the la 
grades under consideration would probably not occur, though t 
is by no means certain, as the studies of Courtis and others h 
taught us that in arithmetic (and doubtless also in other subjec 
classes and individuals do not show constant and steady progr 
but have their periods of no advance and of actual retrogressi 
However, it must be remembered that this is an objective st 
ment of the matter and that subjectively the “levels,” “plateau 
“retrogressions’”’ may represent periods of incubation that are 
potentials of actual progress in objective efficiency to be reveal 
often in astonishing ways, later on. 
Our main purpose in this part of the work has been to sti 
growth in apprehension and in the concepts of the several n 
bers in the number space 5 to 12 when presented by means of 
quadratic pictures. It has already been pointed out that 
measure of apprehension is also the measure of at least concep’ 
images, if not of abstract concepts. The number pictures th 
selves constitute for the child a tremendous step toward com:

    bstraction, in that he is taken away from the specific numbered 
bjects of various kinds to a representation that may stand for 
ny of them. Many German students of pedagogy beyond all 
thers have perceived this truth and are in substantial agreement 
regard to it, regardless of what general theory of the formation 
f the concept they may severally hold. Sound or sight images of 
lhings presented in succession have been conclusively proved by 
e experiments of Lay to be inferior to any sort of group pictures; 
ey hold the mind to particularities in a way which militates 
lgainst (rather than helps) the formation of the concept, and con- 
quently against apprehension; for while the concept grows out of 
prehension (let us say) it in turn reacts on perception and 
aging so that the growth of the former renders the latter pari 
ssw more certain and adequate. 
Proceeding upon the assumption, not unwarranted, that the 
rliest appearance of mastery of a number in any grade is, at 
last, the sign of the possibility of its mastery by the children of 
at grade, we offer as the tentative order of sure apprehension for 
ildren trained as ours were the following tabular statement, 
nexing the percentage of error. 
Number 6 Grade 1B Approximate Age 63-74 
Number 5 Grade 2A Approximate Age 7 -8 
Number 8 Grade 2B Approximate Age 73-8} 
Number to Grade 2B Approximate Age 8 -9 
Number 12 Grade 3A Approximate Age 83-03 00000 IIA 
n coming to this conclusion we have selected somewhat arbi- 
rily a rate of error, 0.7 as the permissible maximum of 
ccuracy for any class which may fairly claim a condition of 
tainty with respect to any number. Our reason for this is 
t between this rate and the best record for the numbers nine, 
len or eleven (not included above as among the mastered 
bers) there is a considerable gap:

  Number | Per Cent of error 
9 1.0 | best record in 3A 
12 best record in 3B 
IL 1.5 best record in 3A, 3B   
  
That is to say, when a class makes 12 br more errors per thousa: 
chances distributed among half a dozen or more pupils of fair 
excellent numerical ability (as shown by teachers’ marks in arit 
metic), we consider that the class, as such, has not mastered t 
number occasioning the errors, though, of course, individuals 
the class have done so. That this is the fact with respect to sev 
and eleven appears in our tables of individual records. Num 
nine seems well on the road to mastery in 3A, but falls back 
.o15 in 3B. 
For the sake of completeness, the records of the numbers m7: 
seven and eleven are given in the higher grades (rate of error).

There is nothing in these records that calls for further rem: 
except that eleven appears still to be giving some trouble in 4A 
4B. 
These results seem to bear out the opinion sometimes expre 
that number concepts arise rather late in the child’s life and t 
therefore it would be wise to postpone the study of number 
time considerably later than that which now is customary. P 
Burnham expresses this opinion in his article on “Arithmetic 
School Hygiene” (see our review of this article, pp. 143-148, 
says that the agony of spirit in which German educators ind 
over the matter of number pictures and other material

   eaching beginning children might be wholly escaped provided 
umber teaching were not begun earlier than the age of 9 or 10. 
t must be admitted that from our angle and conditions of 
pproach to this subject, it seems to appear that any contentful 
loncepts of the cardinal numbers must be denied to children under 
e age of g or Io. 
But before reaching this conclusion it would be well to bear in 
ind the following points: 
First. The limitations of our method which (necessarily in this 
udy) has been to test children of several grades at about the 
me time and then to treat the results as if they had been 
tained from a single group of children systematically trained 
rough the several grades. 
Second. A pertinent question to ask would be whether the 
ncepts would not be deferred still longer without such training 
even our children received, admittedly not of the most sys- 
matic or economical kind. 
Third. No oncis yet in a position to say just what would be the 
sult of a systematic endeavor to build concepts with economical 
terial. No one can say, to put the matter negatively, that the 
e rise of concepts observed is not the result of awkward and 
steful teaching procedure. 
cs 
s a supplementary proceeding, it was thought desirable to 
e the children another series of tests, using a varying time of 
osure for the several number pictures from three to twelve to 
what effect, if any, such variation might have on apprehension. 
these tests the number of seconds of exposure given to each 
ber was made equal to the number of units in the number. 
us the number five was given an exposure of five seconds, six of 
seconds, seven of seven seconds, etc. By this means three and  
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
     
    
     
      
   four were given a shorter time than in bas tests with the unifo: 
exposure, five the same time, and the rest a longer time in propor 
tion to their size. 
As the purpose was to discover only the general tendency o 
the results of such changes in the time, the presentations wer 
limited to the first 21 cards, preserving the same order as in th 
uniform tests. (See order of presentation, page 211.) The num 
ber of presentations thus secured for each number was as follows

t appears from the table and the curve (Fig. 7) that there is a 
ht general tendency throughout the grades to make more 
stakes on the number pictures as a whole when presented 
ing different times (which except in the case of five are longer 
es) than when given a uniform five seconds exposure. It 
ht be thought by the teacher who has given the matter only 
ual attention that at least the larger and (presumably) more - 
cult numbers would be helped by giving the pupils a longer 
Ik. Our general results (Table VII) seem to show, however, 
t such is not the case.

         Here the 200 pupils of grades 1A to 3A are taken as one group 
nd the rate of error for the group computed for each number. At 
nce we see that the numbers eight, nine, eleven and twelve seem to 
how the same tendency toward greater error when the exposure 
s varied, slight in the case of eleven and twelve, somewhat more 
ecided in the case of eight and nine; while five, sia and seven seem 
o show an opposite tendency and fen an equal score whether the 
xposure is 5 sec. or 10 sec. Seven and nine change their relative 
ositions in comparative rate of error, but no other change in 
elativity takes place by reason of the longer exposures. In fact, 
he general similarity of the two curves testifies to the reliability 
f our data in both series of tests. It was thought worth while to 
ake a further inquiry into the comparative apprehension of the 
umbers found in our previous study to be the most difficult, 
iz., seven, nine and eleven. 
In Table IX, following, the comparative rates of error in each 
{ the grades are given for the number seven; in Table X for the 
umber nine; in Table XI for the number eleven. 
In Table VIII and Fig. 8,a smaller tendency to error in the case 
f the number seven appeared when the time of exposure is seven 
econds and the whole group of children in grades 1A to 3A 
considered. It now appears (in Fig. 9) that this tendency holds 
every one of the grades in question except 2B, quite decided in 
lhe grades 1A and 1B, less so in 2A and 3A. The low average 
ifference between scores on this number for the whole group of 
hildren is caused by the indifference of grade 2B. It would seem 
ir to conclude that at least in the first year the additional 2 sec. 
xposure is of advantage. 
Table X and corresponding graph show that the number nine, 
respect to which the whole group seemed to favor the uniform 
posure somewhat decidedly, has grade 1A to thank for almost 
II of this seeming preference, though the tendency in all the other 
rades is in much smaller degree the same except in 2A, where 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  
  236 : Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
      
   
   an opposite, but not decidedly pues tendency, is shown. 
With respect to number eleven (Table XI and Fig. 11) we may 
say that only decided tendencies appear in grades 2A and 3A and

which would be somewhat difficult to manage under the usu:

gains in apprehensibility by reason of an additional 2 second

            exposure, why do not the numbers nine and cleven gain much 
more by reason of an additional four and six seconds respectively? 
The answer that I offer is that while two added seconds may help 
first-year children to get seven, nearly twice 5 seconds and more 
than twice five seconds are entirely more time than the children 
need to get nine and eleven respectively, and therefore the pro- 
longation of the time gives opportunity for the entrance of ele- 
ments of confusion, such as wandering attention, uncertainty 
due to reconsideration of first impressions, etc. The children 
during these long exposure-times were with difficulty restrained 
from seizing their pencils to write several seconds before they 
received the command “Write!’”’, and it was a constant observa- 
tion during the tests that the time after the first few seconds was 
time lost, if not worse than lost. 
In conclusion, we may refer briefly (a) to the distribution of the 
pupils with reference to the mistakes made, (b) to the effect on 
apprehension, of the strokes introduced into Lay pictures to indi- 
cate operations, and lastly to two correlations, viz., apprehension 
with general intelligence and with teachers’ marks in arithmetic. 
In Table XII the distribution is shown. It indicates a consid- 
erable degree of variability, but this was to be expected in work of 
this character. From # to 4 of the pupils in the classes above 1A 
make no mistakes; but the number making mistakes is sufficiently 
large to warrant the acceptance of the class average as satisfactory 
measures for comparative purposes. This we have done in all 
our statistical work after changing our absolute number of mis- 
takes to number of mistakes per 100 chances, or, in other words, 
finding the ratio of errors to a common base. A simpler tabula- 
tion, perhaps, for the comparative work might have been made by 
nding the average number of mistakes made by the class at each 
resentation of a number and changing this to the basis of a class

   of 50. But the resu:ts would have been the same relatively and 
we believe that the tables as they stand are better exhibits of 
statistical completeness. 
We found little difference, taking the group as a whole, between 
the boys and girls in variability, and, as Table XII shows, there 
iis no difference worth mentioning in accuracy. 
A question of some interest in connection with the presentation 
f the number pictures to pupils is whether the strokes have an 
nfluence on the perception of the group as a whole. It was Lay’s 
urpose in using them to assist pupils to see small pictures in the 
arger ones, and so to render calculation anschaulich. But if they 
ork as a hindrance to apprehension, as such, it might be better to 
ostpone the introduction of the strokes until the pupil has con- 
iderably advanced in the stage of numeration. However that 
ay be, it will be of interest and possibly of some value to know 
he precise effect, relatively speaking, which the strokes had on 
he apprehension of our children (grades 1A to 3B taken as a 
ingle group).

   The general result is that oblique lines seem to lend difficulty; 
wo vertical lines help, but more than two do not; the location of 
he line sometimes helps, sometimes hinders, or is a matter of 
indifference. It is probable that the oblique lines, since they 
ouble the amount of mistakes, are a real menace to young chil- 
ren and that their use might well be postponed for a time. 
Two groups of pupils, one of 58 first-year pupils and one of 89 
cond-year children were used to work out a possible correlation 
etween the ability to apprehend numbers, as measured by num- 
ler of mistakes made, and ability in arithmetic as indicated by 
achers’ marks. The degree of correlation was sought separately 
r each group. 
The pupils were numbered in rotation (from 1 to 58 in the first 
oup and from 1 to 89 in the second group) and then thrown into 
artiles according to their ranking by teachers, the highest 
urth of the class in Quartile I, the next highest in Quartile II, 
c. Red ink was used for the numbers in Quartile I, and green, 
olet and blue (or black) for the other three quartiles respectively. 
us, in group No. I first-year pupils fall into the first quartile as 
lows (see quartile arrangement below) ; those numbered 8, 26,48 
ving a mark of go (see marks below the quartiles), those num- 
red 9, 25,40, 41, 58 having a mark of 85,etc. Now the pupils are 
ain arranged in quartiles from-high to low with respect toability 
apprehension, using the same numbers and the same colored ink 
lat they had in the first arrangement. One can judge at a glance, 
a general way, how the pupils of each quarter of the group in 
first ability are distributed among the quartiles of the second 
angement. If the correlation were perfect all the reds of the 
t arrangement would appear in Quartile I of the second, all the 
ens in Quartile II, all the violets in III, all the blues in IV.

    Such, however, is not the case; some of the reds are in II and IV, 
he greens are scattered, etc. 
Table XIV shows the exact distribution. Read each vertical 
column downward: Of the 14 cases in the first quartile (red) in 
rithmetic, 10 (71%) are in the first quartile in apprehension, 
(21%) are in the second and 1 in the fourth, etc. 
A study of the table reveals that pupils assigned by teachers’ 
arks to the first and last quartile largely remain there (71% in 
he first, 60% in the last) in apprehension; but only 13% remain 
the second and 43% in the third. Forty per cent of those in 
lhe second quartile in the first arrangement are in the third in 
e second arrangement and 33% in the third, while 43% of those 
t first in the third have moved to the second. However, of the 
9 pupils assigned at first to the median rank (second and third 
uartiles) 20 are still to be found in that rank though 12 of the 
cond quartile and 8 of the third have crossed the line between 
two. Two reasons may be mentioned for this greater inter- 
ange in the middle section between quartiles; first, those in the 
tremes of the class have only one way to move, and thus their 
ances of moving are reduced; second, the teachers’ marks are, 
ubtless, less carefully differentiated as between fair and good 
r the middle section, since the medium abilities are more diffi- 
It to discriminate than the extreme ones. Perhaps the clearest 
terpretation of the table may be given thus: 
Number of cases true to form (assuming the marks in arith- 
letic as the “form”—27; number close (not more than one 
ove from the original quartile)—19; number off “form”—r2. 
w for a single numerical expression of these facts, we might 
27 points true plus 10 points (3 x 19) close equal 46 points 
t of a possible 58, or 64%. (It is not claimed, of course, that 
s is a mathematically correct coefficient of correlation; but it 
1 do for comparative purposes; for example, a similar compu- 
ion for group 2 (see next page) yields 76%, while everything

   about the table points to a higher degree of correlation than in the} 
first group). | 
We may say, then, that the first-year children show a positiv! 
criti between the two abilities. Turning now to the secon 
group (second-year children) we find (Table XV) that again th 
pupils first assigned to the extreme q' artiles remain there to 
still larger extent than before (73% ah 65%) while fewer case 
are lost to the median quartiles. The number “true” is 56 
close—25; off—8; per cent expressing this—76% showing 
higher degree of correlation than the first group. 
We tried another correlation by a somewhat different metho 
number apprehension with general intelligence, with each of th 
foregoing groups. The pupils were 7 into three or fo 
ranks on the basis of general intelligence and also into three 
four ranks on the basis of mistakes in apprehension. The obje 
was to see what percentage of the pupils falling into each of t 
groups in general intelligence from high to low might fall into t 
same groups in the apprehension of number. Table XVI sho 
the grouping for first-year pupils and Table XVII for second-ye: 
The general results for first-year pupils is that of the 33 pup 
assigned to the upper half of the class 27 stick there in the seco: 
ability, but of the 25 pupils assigned to the lower half 16 are fou 
to have moved to the upper half in apprehension. There is lit 
relation shown between the two abilities on the whole, but o} 
cases are too few in this as in our other correlations to enable us 
reach anything but tentative conclusions. 
As our fourth rank contained so few cases in the first group 
pupils (Table XVI) and promised to contain as few in the sec 
group, we used only three groups in the next relation table (Ta 
XVII). Here again the relation is indifferent, less than half ( 
remaining true to the original assignment. While we dare d 
no general conclusion from 89 cases, the result agrees with 
common as well as scientific observation that there is li

     Commentary and Conclusions.—1. Our working hypotheses 
have been two: (a) The number concept develops pari passu 
with the growth of number apprehension which includes the per- 
ception and imagining through sight and touch (mainly) of a 
group of objects or their representatives; action between concept 
and apprehension is reciprocal; (b) The quadratic number pic- 
tures of Lay are the best perception material for spatial apprehen- 
sion. 
2. Hypothesis (a) does not preclude the notion that number 
contains temporal as well as spatial elements, but with that our 
experiments have nothing to do. Undoubtedly counting 
plays its part in preparing the way for spatial apprehension and 
so in building up concepts. For the auditory type it may play 
the largest part. Lay’s notion that the number is grasped as a 
Setzung, and that the imaging of a group and its symbolization 
(with or) without counting becomes, through a Kantian reaction 
(construction), numerical apprehension may be an insight of 
great subtlety, but he is in profound disagreement with many 
other experimenters and psychologists (Meumann, Freeman, 
Phillips, Messenger, Burnett, Dewey, et al.). Lay in some pas- 
sages seems to allow in a negative sort of way some value to 
counting for the attainment of number ideas (in addition to its 
value for numerical description which he freely concedes), but he 
minimizes this value to the extreme. 
3. By accepting hypothesis (b) we do not mean that the 
matter of perception material is settled beyond peradventure. 
His own experiments show only a shade over the Born pictures, 
though, as I have intimated, Lay may have in his comparative 
experiments unconsciously handicapped his pictures (see page 
254); also further experimentation may develop something 
better. I am not unaware of the results of Freeman (58) which 
go to show that a grouping by fives with .oso sec. exposure was 
best apprehended by children, while a grouping by fours was best 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  
Y | . l 
250 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
for adults. This needs confirmation. Granting that children 
grasp eet grouping as easily, at iebst, as the four, as far as| 
mere perception is concerned, such grouping would still be 
inferior to Lay’s pictures from the point ‘of view of indicat- 
ing by simple strokes the operations to be performed (see| 
Appendix VII). 
4. The first conclusion from our experiments is that there i: 
no reason to abandon hypothesis (b). Although our research wa: 
not comparative on this point, the exceeding favorableness of th 
material was proved at every step. Fifteen first-year childre 
(1B) made not a single mistake on the number space 3 to 12 wit 
repeated exposures. It is quite probable that Lay’s proposed appa: 
ratus (see Fiihrer, pp. 179-181) will much enhance the usefulness 0 
the quadratic arrangement, permitting as it does the use of touc 
as well as sight, and the introduction of other factors that hav 
been found to influence numerical judgment, form, color, distance 
direction, etc. | 
5. There is a certain order in which the cardinal numbers com: 
to full consciousness. All of them cannot be said to be mastere 
until the end of the third year. 
6. It is probable that with good perception material, syste. 
matically used, paying due regard to the order of development o! 
the numbers as pointed out (tentatively) by these experiments. 
greater economy of time and effort in teaching and learning th 
cardinal numbers and their processes than now obtains can b 
brought about. 
7. Therefore, a freer and better planned use of this material 
than has so far obtained in this country seems to be indicated 
So far as the writer knows only one American text-book has so fa 
systematically included the Lay number pictures in its pages 
In this book? they are used quite ingeniously. 
8. One economical aspect of the value of the pictures is a: 
1Name omitted, for obvious,reasons.

‘oncept-material. “The number pictures constitute for the child 
tremendous step toward complete abstraction, in that he is 
aken away from the specific numbered objects of various kinds to 
representation that may stand for any of them” (page 228). 
‘Since the concept, if it is to be more than nominal, that is, 
ontentful, must grow out of clear images, it is important that 
he images be of such a form that they may be returned to 
eadily again and again, thus growing into type forms of a semi- 
bstract kind, working categories under which may be subsumed 
y children all their early numerical experiences” (page 208).

o the body of the research account.

The Courtis tests in their present form are eight in numbe 
A part of each test is given below to indicate their character, b’ 
the reader must be referred to the published texts of Mr. Court 
for the complete tests and the full account of the manner and pu 
pose of giving them and of working up the results. The accou 
that follows of the results obtained from testing about 300 thir 
to eighth-grade children will illustrate these points to a consi 
erable extent and will perhaps serve to make the general pl 
more concrete than a review confined to Courtis’s work with 
own pupils. My purpose, in brief, is to present some of the r 
sults of the diagnosis of this group of pupils, made possib| 
through the establishment of a norm of efficiency for individu: 
and classes of the several grades in the several abilities involved 
cul work, with the aim of showing the workableness ai 
value of the tests even when applied i the limited way in which 
far I have been able to use them, and of responding to a possi 
interest on the part of Some in seeing how they work out in so 
one school other than that of Mr. Courtis.

Test No. 8. REASONING. 
In the blank space below, work as many of the following 
xamples as possible in the time allowed. Work them in order as 
umbered, entering each answer in the “answer” column before 
commencing a’ new example. Do not work on any other paper. 
Answer 
1. A party of children went from school to a woods to 
ather nuts. The number found was but 205 so they 
ought 1,955 nuts more from a farmer. The nuts were 
ared equally by the children and each received 45. 
ow many children were there in the party? 
2. One summer a farmer hired 43 boys to work in an 
pple orchard. There were 35 trees loaded with fruit and 
57 minutes each boy had picked 49 apples. If in the 
leginning the total number of apples on the trees was 
,677, how many were there still to be picked? 
Note.—The sheet contains 8 problems, more than can be com- 
eted in the time allowed (six minutes). 
In all of these tests the scoring is done by examples, one point 
r each example attempted and one foreach right; note, however, 
e modification of this in test No. 7. 
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 are tests of the control of knowledge of the 
lementary processes through 9’s. It will be noted that an effort 
s been made to make the units of work as nearly equal objec- 
ely as possible (compare the structure of the several groups of 
e examples). The same effort has been made with considerable 
ccess, we think, in the other tests; for instance, in test No. 7,

   “each example is approximately the equal of every other example 
if the assumption is made that any step of the work as writing 
figure, thinking a sum, carrying a ne etc., is the equal of an 
other step; just what the relative difficulties are is not known, bu 
the experimental results already obtained make it probable tha‘ 
while the assumption is not true of individuals it is true in general 
an example with a double number is twice as long as a singl 
example.” (Manual of Instructions, p. 10.) The test migh 
be devised, of course, in such a way as to render the “Telativ: 
difficulties” of little moment. It would be a question of con. 
structing units whose internal composition should comprise ele: 
ments which in the aggregate cause one process unit to equal an 
other, objectively. If this be done, it is not necessary to assum 
that any step is the equal of any other step, but only to see tha 
the steps (elements) are proportionately distributed in each uni 
It seems possible to do this with considerable exactness even i 
the present state of limited knowledge of the psychology of fund 
mental processes. Fortunately we need only say: writing thij 
figure equals writing that figure, thinking this sum, differenc 
product, quotient equals thinking that sum, etc., carrying thi 
figure scp carrying that figure, etc. , and make each unit cov! 
as many   of these elements as any other. True, there might 
some room for differences of decision as to the relative difficulti 
of some of the corresponding elements, but there seems to be 
doubt but that the unit structure could be so manipulated th: 
in a series of units these differences would balance one anothe 
Of course, an experimental determination of the relative di 
culties on the whole would contribute to greater exactness a. 
more satisfactory units. But it must be remembered that the 
norms of difficulty, even if exactly determined, would represe’ 
no individual and no single class of individuals. Such a gener 
determination of the relative difficulty of elements of t 
same naney would be entirely possible and relatively easy.

     his connection a question might be raised as to the advisability of 
coring by units in all of the tests, rather than by elements as 
alled for by the directions in tests Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Thus, the 
nits so carefully worked out by Mr. Courtis for the simple opera- 
ions, it would seem, should not be broken up into their elements 
lor scoring purposes, but logically should be scored thus: number 
f units attempted, number of units right (all parts of units being 
hrown out) instead of number of examples attempted, number 
f examples right. 
Experience with the tests with our own children has shown, 
0, that, unless certain test papers are thrown out, scoring by 
llements in the first four tests at least is calculated to give mis- 
ading results. For instance, one pupil handed in a paper (test 
0. 2) which scored 20 attempted, 20 right (accuracy 100%), but 
e pupil had skipped all the more difficult subtractions. 
A general statement of the matter as applied to all the tests 
ould be that by enlarging the units in a test so as to include in 
ch unit all the phases involved in the ability or abilities tested 
that in quantity and quality of elements each unit would 
proximately equal any other, any assumption as to equality of 
eps would be largely eliminated. But while this plan, provided 
e scoring were done by units, might be desirable from the point 
view of exact experimental method it is freely conceded that 
m the point of view of the giving, scoring and interpreting of 
ch tests by comparatively untrained persons, Mr. Courtis has 
visedly used a much more workable plan, after having duly 
msidered more complicated methods. Scoring by units to yield 
tirely satisfactory data would require that at least a sufficient 
mber of units be attempted to balance up any elemental 
qualities within the units; for example, 20 units in each of the 
st four tests to cover all possible combinations through 9’s. 
t this would require, further, a radical change in the manner of 
ing the tests; all pupils would now be required to work through

    the requisite number of units and have his individual time re 
corded, since time used is an important factor in determinin 
control of knowledge. It is much Simpler to keep the time unifor 
for all and to score by attempts and rights for each example an 
quite as satisfactory for practical purposes. The practical advan 
tage would be the opportunity given for a more thoroughgoin 
analysis of mistakes (since chances would be offered for every kin 
of mistake), but this would scarcely compensate for the complic 
tions introduced into the conducting of the tests and the trea 
ment of the gross scores. | 
No. 5 tests rate of motor activity in writing figures. It is ob 
ous that this ability can conceivably be related to the number 
examples attempted and might serve to explain in part the score i 
the latter from the point of view of mere muscular control. Th: 
point will be referred to again. It might be supposed, also, thi 
some relation exists between motor ability and mental functio 
ing. Bagley (72) has shown, however, that with his subjects the’ 
is no pate correlation between motor ability and intelligenc 
No. 6 tests the ability to recognize a situation in a problem 
calling for the use of a certain operation. Mr. Courtis sa 
(Manual of Instructions, p. 9): “This ability is itself a comple 
the ability mentioned representing merely the arithmetical pha; 
of the mental activity. Speed in this test undoubtedly depen: 
mainly upon speed of reading and of the comprehension of t 
meaning of printed words.”” Here again it would seem advisa 
to make the unit of performance a group of four and to score 
such units. Without entering upon a discussion of the matter, t! 
cues in one-step addition and subtraction problems are proba 
more directly and certainly suggestive of the operation than 
multiplication and division. Any one who has tried the ma. 
facture of problems has found it more difficult to “ring t 
changes”’ on cues for addition and subtraction. If this be true, 
relative difficulty of the examples is not the same, but the rela’

   difficulty of the groups of four examples would be approximately 
the same. However, this would make little difference in results 
for comparative purposes provided the examples are worked in 
the order in which they occur. 
No. 7 involves all the abilities of the previous tests and tests 
nowledge of the symbols, processes and forms of the four opera- 
ions; also ability to borrow and carry; also ability to attend to 
echanical details. The first four examples involve no “borrow- 
ng and carrying;” but the examples from 5 to r1 do (as also those 
rom 12 to 19) and make possible a measurement of the effect of 
he introduction of “borrowing and carrying.” The ability to pay 
ttention to details is tested by requiring that each of the exam- 
les be copied and that the answers be written in the answer 
olumn. Instead of scoring one point (attempted and right) for 
ach example, in this test the exception is made, in order to keep 
e units equal, of scoring one for two in certain of the examples 
s the first and two for one in some of the others as in 7-8. 
No. 8 tests the ability to handle the difficulties added by the 
ganization of the previous material into two-step problems. 
ike test No. 6 it is also a language test—the ability to get mean- 
g from the printed word. 
The unconventional phrasing of the problems both in test No. 
and No. 8 removes them as far as possible from appeal to mere 
emory (association with typical problems of the conventional 
rt, as with rules, which association may simulate reasoning). 
further test out the rationality of procedure irrelevant num- 
rs are introduced into examples 2, 4, 5 and 8. 
Each problem is, in the abstract work called for, the equal of a 
gle example in test No. 7. Each two examples involve the 
r operations. 
Following the directions on page 21 of the Manual, for the 
sons there stated, the tests were given in two sets in the follow- 
order: Set I—Nos. 5, 2,8, 3; Set II—Nos. 4, 6, 1, 7; see the

   If we examine the distributions set forth in Table I, we find, as 
ight be expected with such a small number of cases (about 50 to 
ach distribution), that most of the distributions are “skewed.” 
ut five of the classes, three in test No. 1 (addition), viz., 3A, 4A, 
A, and two in test No. 2 (subtraction) viz., 6A and 7A, show a 
istribution surprisingly close to a normal one, that is to say, the 
reatest number of frequencies occur at the class measure (aver- 
ge) with fewer frequencies symmetrically disposed on either side 
f it and progressively decreasing in number. To show this more 
learly distribution curves have been drawn for classes 3A, 5A and 
A, Figs. 1, 2, 3. The dotted lines on either side of the 
rdinate at M (representing the number of frequencies at the 
verage) mark the limits of the zone of central tendency in which 
ne-half the members of the class fall. In order to do this more 
ccurately, I have computed and used (instead of the average 
eviation), to measure the distance on either side of M the prob- 
ble error of the class measure (average). Thus, in class 3A 
test No. r) with an average of 32 (p. e. 7.0), 50% of the pupils 
re included in scores from 25 to 29, in class 5A (test No. 1) with 
in average of 47 (p. e. 7.0), 50% of the class are included in scores 
‘om 40 to 54, and in class 6A (test No. 2) with an average of 37 
. @. 7.0) 50% are included in scores from 30 to 44. While the 
nge of variation within the central zone happens to be the same

       in these classes the coefficients of variability depending on the 
number and size of the frequencies that deviate from the average 
are not the same. Class 5A is least variable (18%); 6A shows 
23% and 3A 25%. In class 3A, eight individuals fall above the 
central zone, fifteen below, while the entire range is from a score 
of 15 (in test No. 1) to 65; in class 5A twelve fall above and four- 
teen below, entire range (test No. 1) from 15 to 45; in class 6A, 
eleven fall above and thirteen below, entire range (test No. 2) 
from 15 to 65. Perhaps the most striking way to put the matter 
iis to point out that in class 3A, fifteen out of 46, one-third of the 
class, do not know the addition tables, while at least two (of the 
eight above the central zone) know them too well; that is to say, 
the time spent with the rest of the class by them on tabular work 
is entirely wasted; again in class 5A, a grammar grade, fourteen 
ut of 51 do not know the addition tables, and in class 6A, thir- 
een out of 49 are in the same fix. The conclusion cannot be 
scaped that there has been a failure here “to secure [early] com- 
lete all-around [class] development in fundamental abilities” 
nd this, in turn, to failure to minister to individual needs. The 
uestion is also opened whether some individuals have not been 
iven a kind of drill, perhaps through many wearisome class per- 
ods, which they do not need. An examination of the other coeffi- 
ients in Table I shows similar results in regard to variability, 
nd point to similar conclusions. Possible exceptions are classes 
‘A and 8A in all of the tests except No. 3 (multiplication). Just 
hat degree of variability can be permitted within a grade from 
lhe point of view of efficiency is, of course, a moot point, but it 
ould seem that these classes in addition, subtraction, and divi- 
ion had reached a fairly satisfactory degree of homogeneity. 
ut a close examination of the distribution reveals that in 7A 
ddition and 8A subtraction and division the distribution is much 
skewed” toward the lower end of the class, giving 15 or 16 cases 
f pupils below the central zone, On the other hand in 8A addi-  
-P-A-G-E-278
  266 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
tion there is a Ae skew toward the upper end, giving 14 cases of 
pupils who are supernormal having scores of 77 to 105 (the norm 
is 63) and the upper limit of the central zone as determined by 
the probable error is 76. This fact, together with the relative 
fewness of mi at the lower end, brings the average of this class 
(68) above the standard fixed by Courtis for 8th grade speed 
addition (63). In 7A subtraction and division, the distributio 
approximates a normal one, but even here there are a dozen case: 
in each class below the central zone. It is evident from thes 
considerations that even a coefficient as small as .13 indicates 
larger range of variation than class efficiency can permit. 
One of the worst examples of skewed distribution as well a: 
extreme variability is afforded by class 3A in test No. 2. Thi 
is illustrated by the diagram Fig. 4, which shows a range o: 
variation from 5 to 65 points. While the class average (20 
is up to the standard, it really represents few individuals in thi 
class, as the average deviation from if is nearly 10. 
This average is further slightly vitiated as a representativ: 
measure by ual fact that the ingen scores (rights as well a: 
attempts) show that the two highest scores in this distributio 
are spurious in a way, since in one of the cases the number of right; 
is 18 out of 60 attempts, and in the other 32 out of 65 attempt 
An examination of the test papers of these two reveals that man 
of the more difficult subtractions are wrong, thus supplying addi 
tional instances in favor of scoring by units (group of five) rathe 
than by ou examples. (It will have been noted that onl: 
        
   
        
    
    
    
   
    
       
    
      
attempts are tabulated in the first five tests, in accordance wit 
Mr. Courtis’s belief, derived from his experience, that lack of co 
trol of knowledge of the tables is shown not by mistakes but b: 
reduced speed; the examples in these tests are usually right, h 
says, except in the very lowest grades. This is borne out, on th] 
whole, in our tests but there are bcdbsibrial exceptions such 
those noted above.) The fact is that the control of very many,

   least half, of the class is feeble, a condition that doubtless could 
have been much improved, with the result of a reduced variabil- 
ity, by proper attention to individual cases. 
Table II presents the distribution of frequenciesin both attempts 
and rights in tests Nos. 6, 7, 8, viz., in speed reasoning, funda- 
mental operations (organized use of the tables), and two-step 
reasoning. The scores are fairly satisfactory so far as class aver- 
ages are concerned, except in test No. 8 where as compared with 
the Courtis standards they are very unsatisfactory.’ But note 
the heterogeneity of the classes, as shown by the variability co- 
efficients, especially in tests 6 and 8 (reasoning). The classes are 
much less compact in these tests than in the tabular tests; on the 
other hand, in test No. 7 (abstract work) they are about as homo- 
geneous as in the tables, which is not saying much. The exception 
to this statement is class 8A in test No. 6, though the distribution 
is “skewed.” Strange to say, this class is extremely variable in test 
o. 7, rights ranging from a score of 1 to a score of 16 points, 
hough it had been comparatively compact in the tables. This 
points to a conclusion which will be brought out more fully later, 
ne that Mr. Courtis has reached and which our results also show 
hat there is indifferent correlation between knowledge of the 
ables, as such, and ability to work abstract examples involving 
hese tables. 
So far as normality of distribution is concerned, these tests show 
requencies normally distributed in more instances than the pre- 
ious ones. The curves drawn for class 7A, test No. 6, attempts 
1Since this was written, new standards have been worked out by Mr. Courtis 
ased on scores from a very much larger number of children than were available 
lor the original standards. (See Bulletin Number Two, Courtis Standard Tests, 
etroit, 1913, page 20.) The new standards differ scarcely at all from the old 
xcept for the tests in reasoning (Nos. 6 and 8). In these tests the old standards 
re found to have been set much too high. In view of this revision the statements 
regard to comparative scores in reasoning deserve some qualification; the case 
r the local scores is made somewhat more favorable, though not sufficiently so 
necessitate any radical change in the discussion.

: and rights (Figs. 7 and 8); for class 3A, test No. 6, attempts 
(Fig. 5,); for dlass 8A attempts and rights, test No. 8 (Figs. 
and 10) show clearly the approximately normal distribution, 
though they ir more or less flattened on account of range o 
variation or size of frequencies outside the central zone. Fow 
other tests approximate a normal distribution somewhat les 
closely, viz., vp speed (one-step) reasoning rights; 5A funda       
      
     
      
    
    
   
     
    
      
    
      mentals, attempts; 6A fundamentals, attempts; and 8A spee 
reasoning, rights. 
The reason for these symmetrical distributions with so fe 
cases is not clear. Only the very general statement can be mad 
that such distributions imply the operation in the conditions of ai 
indefinitely large number of individual factors each of which i 
equally present and effective. 
The champion skew distribution among these tests is found i 
test No. 6, rights. The range is from no score, of which there ar 
18 cases, to 5, of which there is one case. The resulting curve i 
shown in Fig. 6. This 3A class is almost a complete failure} 
as a class, in speed reasoning as is shown by the distribution an 
variability (83%) and is brought up to a respectable averag 
(z.2), respectable in view of the fact that it had advanced in scho 
life only about four weeks beyond the second year (the tests wer 
given near the beginning of the school year), by a talented fe 
who make high scores. | 
On one point the conclusion from our data of distribution mus| 
differ from that of Mr. Courtis. He says, “In the early grades thi 
classes are units, but as pupils pass from grade to grade, indi 
viduals react to training in different ways so that the unity i 
broken” (42a, p. 197). It does not follow from this, howeve: 
that these differently reacting pupils will be found to an increa: 
ing extent in class after class. Under any proper scheme 
classifying and promoting pupils, differing pupils will find thei 
level, so far : such a thing is possible, through the individu

ttention that is demanded to land them in their proper groups 
d the incentives that are afforded to both teacher and pupil to 
duce making the best of the individual regardless of time-tables 
d curricula. Our plan of promotion is the half-yearly one, 
lerhaps the least flexible scheme now in use, but by dint of the 
kward and somewhat dangerous maneuver of pulling up a: 
lupil from one grade and planting him in another, the classes are 
lept measurably homogeneous. Our results would seem to show 
at in arithmetic, at least, they are increasingly so as the coeffi- 
ents in Tables I and II show on the whole a progressive decline 
size. 
It is a fundamental question in connection with these compara- 
lve tests whether the results obtained from a single test are reli- 
le measures of grade ability. The answer is that they are when 
operly analyzed and understood. Mr. Courtis early realized 
e importance of this point, and by repeated tests of his Detroit 
pils of the same grade satisfied himself that where the condi- 
lons with reference to training are constant (as during a summer 
cation) the grade averages for a given class are consistently the 
me. But this was not found to be true of the individuals com- 
sing the grade. Evenwhen the grade average was perfectly con- 
ant, individual scores were found to vary. The constancy was 
e to the fact, as the records showed, that the variations of cer- 
in individuals in one direction are offset by the variations of 
hers in the opposite direction. For the individual, therefore, 
peated tests are needed to determine his most frequent score 
d the range of his variation from it. 
It may be added that the class scores must always be considered 
connection with the variabilities in order to reach a judgment of 
leir value as representative of class performance and individual 
truction. 
The data for the working out of the Courtis standard scores 
s secured by the codperation of some twenty superintendents,

It will now be of interest perhaps to see how the local results 
mpare with the standard scores. It will be borne in mind that 
e standard scores are set as ideals to be reached at the end of the 
ool year, whereas our tests were given when the pupils were but 
few weeks beyond the beginning of the year. We find no reason, 
wever, to modify the standards in making comparisons on that 
count, except in tests No. 6 and No. 8; these, as already set 
rth, are in part reading tests and since a year’s training in read- 
ig counts for so much, especially in the lower grades, it was 
ought only fair to use the standards next below in the case of 
ch grade; for example, grade 3A (beginning the third year) is 
mpared in these two tests with the standard scores of grade 2

(end of the second year), and the matter is arranged according] 
in the table below.! Even so, our classes will be seen to be weak ii 
reasoning, especially so in two-step reasoning; on the other han 
in abstract work generally speaking, they are strong, in a cla: 
sense, even when compared with standards that are probably s 
too high, showing that much of their work in abstract arithmeti 
might better have been spent on problematic arithmetic.

From the data in this table two interesting studies may 
made: (a) the development of each ability through the seve 
grades, as compared with the standard development; (b) the pi 
formance of each grade in the several tests, as compared with t 
standard performance. The study will be greatly assisted by t 
comparative graphs, Figs. 11-18. 
1The scores so selected correspond in a general way with the average sco} 
for these tests (lower than the standard) in the Courtis table.

   The graphs tell the story first of the development in the ad 
dition, subtraction, multiplication, and division tables (Figs. 11, 12, 
13). The standard development, shown by the heavy unbroke 
line, is a smooth progression upward, while the local line falls no 
above, now below the standard. The most notable thing show: 
by these curves is that grade 5A is always above the standard, i 
three of the tests markedly above it, while grade 7A is slight 
below in all except one. The fact of the matter is that grade 5 
is too antl in the tables relatively speaking; contrast th 
work of this grade in two-step reasoning, shown in Fig. 16, wher 
it falls far below the standard. 
In Figs. 14, 15 and 16, the grades are compared with on 
another and with the standard in tests Nos. 7, 6 and 8, wit 
respect both to number of examples attempted (solid line) ani 
number of right answers (broken line). Fig. 14 shows that all 
the grades tested measure fully up to the standard in number 
right answers in fundamentals except grade 8A, but that all thy 
grades make fewer than the standard number of attempts exce 
grade 8A. On the whole this showing is favorable to the locg 
classes; they are somewhat lacking in speed, but they get the’ 
just the same, performing with greater accuracy than the standa 
calls for. (The smaller the distance between the solid and brok 
line on any ordinate the greater the accuracy.) Grade 8A has t 
lowest comparative number of right answers and is least accurat! 
In contrast i this grade 8A is the only class to reach the (mo 
fied) standard number of rights in the speed reasoning test (Fij 
15) and has also the (modified) standard number of attempts a 
therefore the standard percentage of accuracy. All the oth 
grades from 3A to 7A inclusive fall below in right answers thou 
they approximate the standard quite closely except grade 4 
which also makes relatively fewer attempts than any other gra 
except 7A; the latter, however, has 90% accuracy (4:5), bei 
slow but sure. Fig. 16 makes a sorry showing for the sch   
 
-P-A-G-E-287
Experiments 275 
fficiency in two-step reasoning, grades 5A to 8A reaching on the 
hole about 50% of the efficiency called for. The only comfort to 
e extracted from the situation is the wholesome and very 
bvious lesson that is to be gathered from such results. It is 
juestionable if any one was fully aware of this condition prior to 
e tests.

work in copying figures, while grade 8A is above the standard in 
ddition, subtraction and division. 
The graph (Fig. 18) and Table V presents even a more serious 
tory of interlapping of the grades in tests Nos. 6, 7,8. Here both 
ttempts and rights are entered. Confining our attention to 
rade scores in right answers, and summarizing as above (remem- 
ering that our standards for tests Nos. 6 and 8 are modified 
mes), grade 5A does 5th grade work in one-step reasoning and 
undamentals, and 3d grade work (or worse) in two-step reason- 
Ing; grade 6A is on the border of the 5th grade zone in one-step 
easoning (many of the individualmembersare, of course, well with- 
it), does 6th grade work in fundamentals but only 4th grade 
ork (or worse) in two-step reasoning; grade 7A does 6th grade 
ork in one-step reasoning, approximates 8th grade work in fun- 
amentals, does 5th grade work in two-step reasoning; grade 8A 
oes 8th grade work in one-step reasoning, 7th grade work in 
ndamentals, and is not quite up to the 6th grade standard in 
o-step reasoning. 
This overlapping of classes was a constant feature of the returns 
om the seventy schools concerned in furnishing data for the 
andard scores, and, as Mr. Courtis says, utterly breaks down the 
lotion that our schools are graded as they are at present consti- 
ted. 
One of the most striking things that emerges from a study of 
ese graphs is that surpassing ability in the tables does not guar- 
tee extraordinary performance in organized abstract work. 
rades 5A and 8A showed supernormal ability in the tables, but 
precisely reaches the standard in fundamentals and 8A falls 
low. 
It would seem that there is a certain minimum ability in 
e tables beyond which any increase of proficiency does not 
unt for increased ability in the fundamental operations. Fur-

    thermore, test No. 7 is a better test of practical efficiency i 
abstract work than tests Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4. Grade 7A is an illustra 
tion of this. While the class was slightly below the standard i 
two of the tables it proved to be very strong in fundamental 
It must, therefore, have possessed the necessary minimum effi 
ciency in the tables. It is highly desirable, to prevent waste,th 
teachers should know when this minimum efficiency has bee’ 
reached and this knowledge can be obtained only by frequent tes 
ing of the matter. 
A study of the individual records of Grade 5A, the class havin 
the best record in the tables, with respect to this relation poin 
to the same conclusion. Eight members of the class have a 
8th grade total score in the tables; only two of these have 
better than 5th grade score in fundamentals, and three have 
poorer; two members have a 7th grade score in the table’ 
both are below 5th in fundamentals; seven have a 6th grade in t 
former, of these, two have a better than sth grade score in t 
latter, three a poorer. On the other hand, several cases of pupij 
who are below the standard (133) in the tables or barely reach 
are fully up to the standard (5) in fundamentals or above it. T 
highest girl in the class in the latter (score 10) makes a score of 1 
in the former; the next highest (score 9) makes a score of only 1 
in the tables. But again, several who are extremely accurate 
the tables, though somewhat slow, make either no score or a ve 
low one in fundamentals. 
These evidences of lack of correlation between knowledge of t 
tables and control of the same in organized work led us to mak 
more systematic grouping of the rgo pupils in all of four gram: 
grades on the basis of right answers to see what percentage of t

, 4 (8%) rank D, etc. 
Without dwelling on all of the details of this table the outstand- 
g inferences from the data therein are that there is a slight ten- 
ency for those in the upper half of the class in fundamentals to 
e found in the upper half in the tables, but it is very slight. 
orty-four per cent of those in group A in test No. 7 fall into the 
wer half of the class in the tables; likewise forty-four per cent of 
ose in group B. On the other hand, there is a slight tendency on 
e part of those grouped in the third quarter (C) in test No. 7 to 
found in the upper half in the table (fifty-five per cent). But of 
e 31 in the lowest quarter, those having the poorest minds for 
ndamental examples, fifty-eight per cent are found in the lower 
If in the tables. 
The correlation may, then, on the whole be roughly stated as 
ither decidedly positive nor negative, but indifferent; and this 
nclusion has an important moral for teachers, viz., the necessity 
recognizing the heretofore not clearly understood fact, already 
lentioned, that there is a certain minimum efficiency in tabular 
rk which so far as it goes insures satisfactory work in examples; 
t, further, also the presence of other factors that enter into the 
mplex called a subtraction or multiplication example, for in-

    stance; factors that practically cannot be eliminated. Amon 
these additional abilities that are demanded are ability to cop 
correctly, to borrow and carry, to correctly place partial results, 
and to give the prolonged attention needed to arrive at complet 
results. It is probable that if these abilities and their attendan 
habits (or lack of habits) could be eliminated (as, of course, the: 
cannot be) the correlation would be much closer. 
In order to illustrate with more definiteness the condition of th 
classes with reference to standard performances we have selecte 
two classes for test No. 7 (fundamentals) and two for test No. 
(one-step reasoning), in each case one with a relatively high an 
one with a relatively low variability, according to the coefficien 
in Table II, p. 262. 
The distribution of the individuals of a class from the stan 
point of standards will serve to make still clearer the situation 
to variability, the critical factor in this whole discussion. T 
table shows in what grades the pupils of the four classes f 
according to efficiency standards on the basis of right answers.

pupils of 4th grade ability and below in the 6th grade, and 8 pupils 
of 6th grade ability and below in the 8th grade. 
The pupils who rank above their respective grades also call for 
comment and some detailed attention. Accordingly the scores 
(right answers), in fundamentals and in reasoning, of the indi- 
viduals in the extreme upper end of each of these classes are tabu- 
ated below to discover whether the high record in the one was 
aintained in the other. At the same time, as a matter of further 
interest, the teachers’ marks in arithmetic given to the same indi- 
iduals have been transferred from our records to the table. 
At once it ‘appears that there is little or no relation indicated 
tween the abilities called upon in the two tests. The individuals 
ho are good in both tests are the exception and it would seem, 
herefore, that these function equally well in abstract work and 
in problems not because of psychic community between the two 
inds of work but because of facility gained in some way inde- 
endently in each. In grade 5A, the individuals selected are all 
bove the sixth grade in ability in abstract work, only one shows 
etter than 5th gradein reasoning, four are below sth grade; in grade 
A all the individuals fall below 7th grade in reasoning except one 
they were above the 8th grade in fundamentals). In grades 6A 
nd 8A the eight best pupils in reasoning in the former class 
ranking above the 7th year) fall below the 6th grade in funda- 
entals with two exceptions and of the eleven best in reasoning 
8A, five fall below in fundamentals.

small coefficient would be to say that with a small percentage o’ 
the children accuracy in speed reasoning and accuracy in abstrac 
work occur together, but with a large percentage of the childre 
they do not occur together. Even in the cases where they occu:

the same tests, preliminary and final, one could determine whether 
the condition of the individuals at the close in each were due to 
natural growth in each or to the transfer of special training in the

The teachers’ marks in arithmetic as compared with the records 
ade in tests in the case of the individuals included in Table VIII 
ord considerable interest. For convenience of reference these 
ve been tabulated again (Table IX); in the table are also set

   down the marks that would seem to be proper, in view of a bal- 
ancing of the scores of the two tests for each individual, had the| 
teacher known all that the tests brought forth or had the pupils 
performed regularly for the teacher in the manner in which the 
did under the ie of a tests. The latter consideration i 
important in view of the fact that the teachers’ marks are on th 
whole relatively low. It is probable that some lazy and indifferen 
pupils were stimulated and some latent abilities, not revealed b. 
ordinary school-room procedure (though, it may be said, the. 
should be), were brought to light. In fact my acquaintance wit! 
the pupils has led me to observe such facts in the case of a consid. 
erable number of the pupils. But such revelations form part o 
the value of the tests.

han the estimated marks. 
The result, 20 out of 33 marks agreeing or practically agreeing, 
n the whole speaks well for the accuracy of the teachers’ marks 
x for the validity of the tests as a measure of ability, depending on 
he point of view. Onemust incline, generally speaking, in cases of 
ifference of marking to give greater weight to the teachers’ marks; 
he estimated marks are based on the results of single tests, and 
he individual cannot be finally judged on the basis of single tests; 
he teacher, on the other hand, has known the pupil for months, 
ut the facts that the teachers’ marks show a decided tendency to 
e the lower ones and that pupils rarely surpass themselves in a 
est lead us to believe that, fundamentally speaking, at least in 
he nine cases that are marked lower, the estimated rather than 
he teachers’ marks reflect the real ability. There were some 
hings about these pupils, and to their credit, which remained 
ndiscovered prior to the tests. 
The number of studies that might be made on the basis of the 
ata supplied by the Courtis tests is practically endless. It must 
ot be supposed that it is necessary or expected that in the practi- 
al use of the tests these detailed studies, interesting to the in- 
uirer who has leisure for them, are demanded. The minimum, 
nd highly valuable, procedure is to discover by single tests the 
easure of class ability and variability and, tentatively, indi- 
idual ability; to give frequent tests, if desired, to make sure of 
dividual ability (one test has been shown to be sufficient for the 
etermination of the class measure); and to analyze out of the 
lomplex of mistakes that are made the kind of mistakes that 
revailingly cause failure; this much for diagnostic purposes. 
ut, if reform is to be secured, the same tests must be given a 
ated repetition at intervals of five months or a year under the 
me conditions to the same classes. This is really the most im-

It was not expected that Lvidenede of the working of the Ebb 
inghaus law would be found among the practiced subtracters 0 
the upper grades. We repeat here what has been written o 
another page (p. 79): “Short cuts and well-memorized direc 
associations 
that any attempts to verify the law, say, through comparativ 
studies of the efficiency of school children in the several com| 
binations would need to be carefully scrutinized before thei 
results could be held for or against the law. It would seem, fo 
instance, that the more expert adders [also, subtracters] must b} 
ruled out and attention given to those who are still in the barbari 
stage of their mathematical evolution, that is to say, to the co: 
paratively inefficient.” . 
It was thought possible, however, that in the earlier grades an 
with the poorer pupils, some confirmation of the law might

one) cited in our table seems to contradict the law. The mistak

tive culture. We must conclude, therefore, that either there is no 
such law at work or that our pupils are too practiced in direct asso- 
ciations to show it. The two pupils who failed so utterly in sub- 
traction did so because they had no control over direct associa- 
tions and were not sufficiently barbarous (as shown by their work 
in addition) to subtract by associations allied to the count. If 
hey had been in this stage, the existence of the law would have 
een evidenced, if at all, by the slow but accurate performance of 
uch examples as 12 — 8, while errors would freely appear in such 
$12— 4. 
The experiment, as will have been gathered, really requires for a 
uccessful outcome the testing of a large and peculiarly consti- 
uted group of children, children who are in a very early stage in 
oth addition and subtraction. 
The data given in Table XI tell their own story. The conclusion 
s either that teachers are mistaken in considering these subtrac- 
ions difficult for children or that they have been the ones selected 
x special drill. The latter seems more likely to be the case. 
We have similarly tabulated below the most frequent mistakes 
the division tables.

  Again we find, as in subtractions, that many of the operations 
ually regarded as the most difficult are absent, and probably

           for the same reason. One of the most peculiar things in the table: 
is the performance of certain simple divisions. Note the 13 mis 
takes on 1 + 1,70n2+ 1,180n2~+ 2,140n5 + 5 and 140 
9 + 9 in the 8th grade, and similar results on these divisions al 
through the grades. Such results must be in part the effect of 
mistaken impression on the part of teachers that such operation: 
are too spl need attention. Not only our results but thos 
of Browne show that such divisions are a most frequent source o: 
error. Just what substitutions are made for true quotients in suc 
cases will pe from our further analysis. An anomalous condi 
tion in this connection must be mentioned, in passing. Whil 
mistakes are frequent on i+ 1,24 1,2 + 2,5+ 5,8 + 8 
9 + 9, no mistakes (or very few) are made, as our complete rec} 
ords show, on 3 + 3,4 + 4,6 + 6,7 + 7. Why children’s mind: 
should thus Ce is what “no fellow can find. out.” 
A further analysis of the mistakes seemed desirable to see ho 
far Browne’s classification of mistakes might be confirmed, esp 
cially as his attempt at classification was only tentative, and w 
based on introspective results from a few adult subjects. 
seemed that it might be possible to work out a more thoroug 
going classification, based on our objective results, which woul 
be of some ort as well as practical significance. A stud) 
of the mistakes made in all the grades tested yielded the followin 
rubrics: 
1. Making the quotient figure the same as the divisor, 
(a) When a difference of only one exists between t 
divisor and quotient; 
(b) When the quotient is commonly used as the divisi 
f the given dividend. 
2. Making some factor (other than the divisor), common’ 
used as the divisor of a given dividend, the quotient figure. 
3. When dividing a digit by itself, making the quotient figu: 
the same.

7. Pupils whose associations are as yet feeble or become so

They frequently miss count and get a quotient figure one

8. Making one of the quotient figures the quotient. 
g. Substituting multiplication for division. 
10. Unclassified. 
When a mistake might be classified indifferently, which it is but 
proper to say happened but seldom, preference was given to the 
class nearest the head of the list.

“transfer?” It is a common opinion among teachers that at least 
addition has a close relation to subtraction and multiplication to 
division. Our results tend to bear out this opinion to a consider- 
able extent. A glance over the individual records of the pupils, 
comparing their scores in the four tables, shows some relationship. 
To test this matter somewhat more thoroughly, we threw the 275 
pupils, grades 3A to 8A, who had been present at all the four 
speed tests into eleven groups of 25 pupils each, ranging them 
from low to high, regardless of grade in the order of their scores 
(right answers) (a) in addition, (b) in multiplication; we then 
computed the averages of the several groups, also the averages of 
the corresponding groups containing the same individuals, (a) in 
subtraction, (b) in division. Two series of averages were thus 
obtained for each relation to be explored, viz., addition with sub- 
traction and multiplication with division, and relation curves 
ere drawn, one series being plotted as the function of the other in 
‘ach case.

and express the facts shown accordingly we should say that sub-

An interesting correlation was made by the foregoing method 
by Mr. Courtis with his Detroit children between rate of motor 
activity (test No. 5) and total score in the speed tests (tests Nos.

As before intimated, we place little stress on these per cents

results of the tests could be further simplified by disregarding 
mumber of attempts altogether.

For both of these purposes drill is necessary, both individual

ttle, and in fact drill has fallep into disfavor. We can see, how- 
er, that it is plainlyindicated, and that more light is needed on

the subject. One of the best studies is that of J. C. Brown—An 
Investigation of the Value of Drill Work, Jour. Ed. Psychol. II, 
1911, 81-88. But his results are in such shape that they are not 
available here. The suggestions of Mr. Courtis are so good that 
we cannot do better than quote them. He says, “Inordinate drill 
is surely harmful. Drill out of place is also harmful. But drill in 
its proper place (after not before understanding control), and in 
proper amount, enough to insure the minimum ability necessary 
to effective work but not enough to involve waste of teaching 
effort, such drill is one of the vital factors in efficient teaching” 
(Elementary School Teacher, Nov., rorz, p. 136). Some drill 
exercises used with his own classes follow: 
The first five minutes of each class period was devoted to drill 
work on the tables. Again the spiral method was used, the same 
table, the same operation, or the same type of practice (visual, 
motor, oral, etc.) never being followed two days in succession; 
that is, if the table of 6’s in multiplication was written one day, 
the table of 3’s in addition might be practiced orally the next. In 
another class the drill on one operation was continued weeks at a 
time, although the type of practice was frequently changed. In 
another the drill was on one topic for a short period with frequent 
changes of practice. Just what the results of these devices might 
be has not been determined with exactness. ‘If the schools of a 
city were vie into districts of, say, ten schools each and defi 
nite methods of drill assigned to each district, appropriate records 
of the work actually done being kept, comparative tests woul 
determine in a single year, with scientific exactness, the relativ 
effectiveness of the various methods” (Elementary Schoo 
Teacher, March, rgrr, p. 370). We also quote from folder H 
Courtis Standard Tests: “If the time at the disposal of the teach 
ers will not permit special drill periods, emphasize the special 
points in the regular lesson, slightly, if necessary, the kinds o 
work in which the grade excels. Uniform development is the thin,

     jo be desired.” “Drill work should be rapid, free, pleasant play 
eriods of short duration. Skill is not acquired by mere repetition 
ut by unusual exertion.” ‘Drill work for a group must be 
road.” “Narrow drill produces a specific ability which does not 
‘ansfer.”” 
“Education is an individual matter and no gradeinstruction nor 
roup work can possibly be devised to minister adequately or 
ciently to the widely differing needs of any group selected

ndling large numbers of children and the many benefits that 
crue from group work make its continuance a certainty. At 
e same time the differences in individuals make it imperative

et by having for each subject and each grade standard scores 
d standard growths in all those component abilities that are

nstant checking of the results of classwork, supplemented by 
dividual prescriptions of study and work, would insure the 
tainment of any desired degree of minimum ability, and still 
ve room in the nonessentials of the subject for all those per- 
issible individual variations which make for personality. If 
ucation is to become either scientific or efficient, more attention

    Our account of the genetic studies of primitive men, children, 
rodigies, and persons having number forms, pointed to certain 
sychological and pedagogical conclusions, which are stated in 
heir appropriate places. The same is true of the psychological 
tudies of perception, counting, processes and reasoning; of the 
tatistical studies of efficiency, transfer, hygiene, and ideation; 
f the didactical studies of apprehension; as well as of our inquiry 
to the ability of school children (a) to nae the cardinal 
umbers, and (b) to deal with the processes. 
It is not proposed to repeat in detail these conclusions here. 
may be of some assistance, however, if some of the points 
rived at are summarized, though the conclusions in detail 
€ not repeated (see index under Conclusions). 
1—The number sense (including apprehension and calcula- 
lon) arises primitively from counting. We have found this 
be the case in our studies of primitive men, of prodigies, of 
ildren and of adults (when, in times of fatigue or confusion, 
ey respond to primitive impulses). All the fundamental 
‘ocesses are, primitively speaking, counting. These processes 
le what they are, because man is what he is, viz., from this 
int of view, a counting animal. (The lower animals probably 
not count; all their: mathematical performances can be ex- 
ined as quantitative discrimination.) 
2—Counting assumes several phases in the child’s history: 
Counting is a motor response to an inner rhythmical series 
thout reference to objects, a subjective ordering of experiences 
ich the child can not resist. The responses at first are certain 
scular movements, as repeating strokes with the clock, rolling 
d balls, nodding the head, arranging pebbles, moving toes and 
ers, etc.; later articulating, using number names. It is in 
Is stage that number forms often originate. In the absence 
umber names which later serve to free the motor mechanism 
giving it adequate and easily pursued avenues of discharge, 
303,

     the field of response is much restricted. The number forms servi 
as the means of bursting the bounds of these restrictions, and a: 
a kind of concrete symbolism analogous to the sticks, pebbles} 
etc., of the prenaming period. The motor impulses find thei! 
outlet and their relief in a geometrizing psychosis (doubtles: 
instinctive), which leads to localization in space or imaginar, 
movement along imagined lines, which movement, of cours! 
must have a spatial background. It might pay to cultivate i 
children good number forms as aids to memory and reproductio’ 
and thus to elementary operations; 
(b) Counting is a mechanical application of number names t 
objects. Froma dE stohyaiel point of view, it is the mate 
ing up or approximate synchronization of the terms of two seri 
of events in consciousness; the one being a series of innervatio' 
tending to motordischarge, in other words to articulatory respon 
or naming, the other a series of impressions from sense-stimu 
(c) Counting becomes rational, i. e., a conceptual proce: 
This involves the putting of units (parts) in a certain order 
relation to one another, as well as marking them off or discrii 
inating them. “The concept two [for example] involves the aj 
of putting together and holding together two discriminat 
ones.” It is in this sense of the word that counting may 
said truly to require “a considerable power of intellect 
abstraction.” At this point a new element from the pedagi 
ical standpoint enters in, viz., motivation; the motive is the ne 
for exact measurement felt by the child in adjusting himself 
his environment. The measurement motive runs as well throu 
his later calculations and is partly social in its nature, par 
mathematical per se. 
3—The child enters school with eal counting psychosis 
established (at least, in its first stage); it is the part of wisd 
not to ignore it, but wisely to take advantage of it. But, 
the economical development of number concepts, the use

           number pictures to follow or accompany the seeing, counting, 
and handling of objects is indicated. Through practice with 
them the ability to grasp groups is strengthened and percept, 
image and symbolization all are brought about with economy 
{ time and effort. Furthermore, since the concept, if it is to 
e more than nominal, that is contentful, must grow out of clear 
mages, it is important that the images be of such a form that 
hey may be returned to readily again and again, thus growing 
nto type-forms of a semi-abstract kind, working categories under 
hich may be subsumed by children all their early numerical 
xperiences. Variety of pictures for a given number should be 
voided. The number pictures constitute for the child a tre- 
endous step toward complete abstraction in that he is taken 
way from the specific numbered objects of various kinds to a 
lepresentation that may stand for any of them. Concepts of a 
ertain sort would doubtless come in time to children confined 
the more primitive and wasteful counting method, but, the 
ncept would be unrepresentable by any economical (group- 
ide) symbolization, would be slow in arriving, and would be 
deniably less tangible and referable to any clarifying content. 
4—The instantaneous grasp of a group of objects visually 
esented is not intuitive. The perception of number is a 
gment mediated in part by spatial data, in part by other 
alitative characteristics. This judgment is made possible 
repeated prior experiences of association of certain quali- 
tive differences in the unit impression with certain num- 
rs of parts derived by actual count. When the association ; 
s become established the experiences that have led up to the 
ation of association have dropped out of consciousness and 
apprehension seems to be immediate. Lay’s notion that 
apprehension is immediate cannot be sustained. It is true

s—Lay’s number pictures may be said, on the basis of 
experimental results, to i on the whole the best perceptio} 
material. Our own experiments on apprehension with his p' 
tures under school room conditions tend to confirm this; and al 
showed, among other hinpes that there is a certain order in whi 
the cardinal numbers come to full consciousness. (For compl 
statement see pp. 249-251.) | 
6—Psychophysically the simple fundamental processes (c 
ried on orally usually for tabular drill, as when a series of sin; 
digits are added, subtracted, etc.) may be analyzed into f 
factors, stated in order of functioning: (a) The recognition) 
a result; (b) the motorizing of the result; (c) the recognit 
of the digit to be added, subtracted, etc.; (d) the associat 
process leading to the sum, difference, product, quotient.

   idered besides the psychological, e. g., ¢hoice and organization 
f subject matter from a utilitarian or a mathematical view- 
joint; the former is an external factor having little influence on 
ethodology, the latter, internal, involving a choice between 
wo aims, (a) that of conferring mathematical insight or (b) 
f mere calculating skill. We have tried to show that the former 
the true aim and that the teaching of processes can be made 
ational without sacrificing the time or the skill of pupils. 
7—Calculation per se is of importance. It would probably 
ay, therefore, to study the methods of prodigies to discover 
asible short cuts now not much noted. 
8—Reasoning in both problematic and process work is deduc- 
ve. Pupils can probably be improved in problematic work by 
ractice in attending to and clearly formulating the “major 
remise.” There is an order in which the several operations in 
e-step and two-step problems can probably be best introduced. 
Tests of efficiency in reasoning await the determination of 
andards in reading before their results can be interpreted at 
eir real value as measures of reasoning. 
9—Transfer and efficiency experiments seem to show that 
e mind instead of being a unity is extremely pluralistic. Little 
idence is found of community of function between one ability 
d another, e. g., between computation and reasoning, or be- 
een addition in tables and addition in columns, multiplication 
tables and multiplication in examples. It seems that each 
ility must be dealt with specifically, and that learning tables as 
ch is not of much value. To confer skill particular acts must 
repeated in a number of situations likely to occur. Knowledge 
6+3 = 9 as an isolated fact will not necessarily function in 
complex 4-+2+3. Hence it is probable that economical 
rning of the simple processes involves learning them in com- 
x situations, that is, in organized examples.

11—Hygiene counsels against mechanical, untimely, unps 
chologized drill, leading to automatisms and arrested develo 
ment; against the too early introduction of problematic work a: 
the use of number puzzles; and against giving too much time 
the subject under an exaggerated notion of its value as men 
discipline or as practical training or the mistaken impressi 
that efficiency is a function of the time devoted to a subject.

Incidentally, the data from the 1 pa in subtraction w: 
analyzed to find confirmation, if possible, of the Ebbinghaus |: 
according to which the more difficult subtractions, gener: 
speaking, would be exemplified by 12—4 as against 12—8, tha’ 
to say, those cases in which the largest difference exists betw: 
minuend and subtrahend. No traces of the working of suc 
law were discovered. Also an analysis of the mistakes madi

MATERIALS AND PROCEDURE USED IN EXPERIMENTS ON THE ESTIMATION OF 
Numper (C. T. Burnett, Harvarp Psycuoxocicat StuprEs, VoL. 2). 
Influence of Group Area. 
Four sets of experiments were given. 
A. Squares, 1 cm., neutral gray, no. 1 (Bradley), were arranged irreg- 
ularly in two groups with irregular outlines on a background of 
black cardboard. One group was large in area, the other small, 
the attempt being made to fill each square homogeneously. Groups 
were not proportional in shape of area. 
B. As above, save that circles 11 mm. approximately in diameter 
were substituted for squares in the interest of distinctiness for the 
several objects. 
C. The area of the groups was oblong and regular and the sides 
proportional (Compact—72.5 mm.: 58 mm.; scattered—11o0 mm.: 
88 mm.). These relations were determined by the size of the 
frame that had already been used, and by the desire to make the 
difference in area as marked as the other necessary conditions 
would admit. The color of the compact group was the deepest 
shade of normal gray; of scattered group of the next higher shade. 
These dark grays were used to reduce to a minimum the ten- 
dency to produce after-images. The difference in the shades of 
the two groups was in the interest of avoiding the greater bright- 
ness due to the mass effect of the compact group. 
D. As in C, except that India ink outline circles 1/; to 1/; mm. line 
were used on a background of granite cardboard. This change 
was made to avoid as far as possible the greater mass stimulation 
due to the reinforcing effect of the compact arrangement. The 
size of the circles remained as before. 
Care was taken to eliminate all influence of numerical judgment, since the 
eriments were to determine the influence of other factors. The numerical factor

Procedure in Experimentation 
The subjects were eight students in Clark University, none of whom was a prac- 
ical arithmetician. 
Single-digit adding (six subjects). 
A pack of twenty cards, a single digit written upon each with a cover card, was 
eld by the subject in his left hand. At a signal, he removed the cover card with 
is right hand and saw the first figure, removed the card carrying that, saw the 
econd figure, added it; and so on to the end of the series, handling the cards as a 
layer would to see that all were there. The cards were highly glazed so as to be 
asy of manipulation. 
The figures were added silently, the total sum being announced by the subject 
s a signal that the series was completed. The experimenter then recorded the intro- 
pections and the time. The digits 1 to 9 inclusive, twenty of each evenly distributed 
ten packs, differently arranged at each sitting, were added five times over in 
ve different sittings by each subject. 
The removal of the cards was practically automatic from the first and much 
ore rapid than the adding. The figure to be added always appeared with the 
adiness to add and without conscious effort on the part of the subject. 
Simple subtraction (four subjects). 
The same pack of cards was used as in addition. No pack had digits adding 
loo, 99 being the highest sum, 79 the lowest. The subject always started at 100, 
btracting each digit as it appeared, from the previous remainder. Other con- 
itions as in single-digit adding. 
Written subtraction (four subjects).  
-P-A-G-E-328
  316 Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
    
          
                    
   Fifty examples written upon white cards, having each digit in both subtrahend 
and minuend, but differently arranged each time, were performed by each subject. 
The card held in place by the left hand rested across a tin plate so arranged that 
the writing of the digits on the card pressed down the plate sufficiently to bring 
it into contact with a row of brass screws directly under it, thus completing an 
electrical circuit and recording the time of writing each digit upon a rotating drum. 
The eeamile was covered by a oe of paper, removed simultaneously with the 
signal “go. y 
Sipe multiplication (four subjects). 
The numbers upon the cards used in single digit adding were multiplied digit 
by digit consecutively by each of the digits 2 to 9 inclusive by each subject. 
The multiplier was announced an instant before the “ready” and “go” signals. 
Other conditions were the same as in single digit adding. 
Written multiplication (four subjects). 
Eight examples were written upon white cards each containing all the digits 
differently arranged. These multiplicands were multiplied by each digit 2 to 9 
inclusive by each subject. Otherwise the method was the same as in written sub- 
traction. 
Simple dividing (four subjects). 
Eight packs of 18 cards each were used. Each pace contained all the nine 
multiples of the digits except one yielding a quotient 1 to 9, each multiple appearing, 
twice. The subject divided through each pack, cali time differently arranged, 
ten times. The divisor was announced just before the “ready” and “go” signals. 
Written short division (four subjects). 
The method and examples used were the same as described i in written multiplica- 
tion except that numbers were divided instead of multiplied.

318: Pedagogy of Arithmetic 
The numbers at the left (23, 48, 73» 98) differ in pairs by 25; and so with the 
numbers at the top. In each set of factors there is one multiple of 4—48 in first 
set, 32 in second set; also, in each set there is anodd multiple of 2—08 (= 2 X 40), 
82 (==2 X 41); again, in each set there is one number of the form 40+ r (73, 57) 
and one number of the form 40—1 (23, 07). 
The sixteen numbers, in the body of the table, all belong to a similar series—11, 
36, 61, 86. If either of the factors is a multiple of 4, tr product has the ending 36 
as shown by the second line, second column; if both are odd multiples of 2 (98, 82), 
the product again ends with 36; if one is an odd multiple of 2 (98, 82) and the 
other an odd number, the product has the ending 86 (= 36+ 50). Finally, if 
both numbers are odd the ending of the products is 36 + 25, i.e., 11 or 61; 61 (a 
number of the form 4o + 1), if the numbers multiplied are either both of the form 
40 +1 (73 X 57) or both of the form 40—1 (23 X 07); 11 (a number of the 
form 40 — 1), if one of the factors is of the form 40 + 1 and the other of the form 
4o— (73 X 07, 23 X 57)- 
Thus, by applying a few simple rules any one of the 16 products in the table} 
can be made to depend on the single product, 48 X 32, of the two multiples of 4] 
in the table. Hence to find the ending of the product of two odd numbers, change} 
each into a multiple of 4 by adding or subtracting 25, multiply these multiples o! 
4 together and then add or subtract 25 as the case may require to get the answer, 
A similar principle applies to the power series of any odd number; simply find th 
required power of the corresponding even number, and then either add or subtrac 
25. | |         
      
      
       
        
   
   
   
     Leaving out of account multiples of 5, in a class by themselves and very eas 
to multiply, the whole of multiplication so far as the endings are concerned may b

24, 28, 32, 36, etc., instead of 3200 combinations which would otherwise be required 
and the problem of finding the last two figures of any power may be reduced to le: 
than 4oo simple cases. | |

0 Tur ApPLICATION OF THE METHOD orf Two-FicurE ENDINGS TO FACTORING. 
(Adapted from Mitchell’s Mathematical Prodigies, Ped. Sem. XVIII.) 
Tf the number to be factored is not already odd and prime to 3 and 5, it may 
made so by division in order to limit the possible number of two-figure endings i 
the number to be factored. 
Take the case of an odd number prime to 5. If the last two figures of one of i 
divisors are known and the division is exact, the last two figures of the other c: 
have only one value; a table may be constructed, if desired, showing the differe 
pairs of endings in the factors which will produce a given ending in the product. |
-P-A-G-E-331
Appendices 319 
     
     
  The procedure would be as follows: Having rendered the number to be factored 
prime to 3 or 5, if not so already, observe the two-figure ending; consult the table 
(the table in Appendix IV shows the kind of table indicated, though the actual table 
would be more exhaustive of two-figure endings) for the two-figure endings of each 
of an initial pair of factors; assume that a certain number with one of these endings 
is a factor; carry a division far enough to decide whether the last two figures of the 
other factor can result, and as soon as this is seen to be impossible, abandon the 
work; try again. 
For example, factor the number 487305. 
487305 + 5 = 97461 
Since the two-figure ending is 61, the two-figure endings of the initial factors are 
73 and 57 (table, Appendix IV). 
Try 373 as one factor; it is known that the other factor will end in 57. 
373) 97461 (26

Abandoned, because 6 appears in the quotient instead of 5.

Initial factors are 273 and 357 
273 = 3 X 81 
357 =7 X St 
The factors of 487305 = 5 X 3 X 7 X 51 X OI. 
It is thus possible to save much work, especially where the numbers involved 
re not very large; a factor may often be rejected almost at a glance which would 
therwise have to be divided through to the end. 
Note.—I have slightly modified and somewhat changed the wording of Mitchell’s 
ccount, in order to make the scheme more workable by the ordinary person. For 
he sake of clearness, an example has been worked out.

APPENDIX VI 
GerorcE P. Brpper, Sr.’s METHOD OF MULTIPLICATION 
From Bidder’s own account quoted by Scripture (13). Bidder, Sr. did not 
use cross-multiplication, as his son did, but a “natural” method. 
{ 
Problem—Multiply 397 by 173 | | 
100 X 397 = 39700 
70 X 300 = 21000 = 60700 
70 X go 6300 = 67000 
19K 7 490 = 67490 
3 X 300 goo = 68390 3 
3X 90 270 = 68660 
Bax 7 21 = 68681 
“The last result in each operation being alone registered by the memory, all 
the previous results are consecutively obliterated until a total product is obtained.”

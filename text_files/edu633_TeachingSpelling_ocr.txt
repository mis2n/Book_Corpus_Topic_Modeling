  PREFACE 
a. purpose of this book is to bring together from 
all sources the more reliable and pertinent facts 
in the teaching of spelling, and to present them in their 
relation to the practical problems which the teacher has 
to face every day in the classroom. 
The book is an outgrowth of a thesis on “ The Ex- 
perimental Studies of Spelling,” which embodied an 
exhaustive study of some ninety investigations. In 
the preparation of the book, this material was supple- 
mented by such information as could be gathered from 
the general literature of the subject, including books 
and articles on methods of teaching and on the psychol- 
ogy of learning, and the better spelling texts of the day. 
A third source of material was the author’s three years’ 
experience as an elementary school principal and super- 
visor in testing, evaluating, and applying in actual 
classroom work the conclusions of the preceding 
studies. 
The author gratefully acknowledges his indebtedness 
to the many investigators and teachers whose fruitful 
labors have made this book possible. He is indebted, 
more especially, to Dean Thomas M. Balliet, of New 
York University, for suggesting the preparation of the 
book and aiding in its construction; to Dr. F. J. Kelly, 
Dean of the Department of Education, University of 
Kansas, Mr. F. S. Camp, Superintendent of Schools, 
Stamford, Connecticut, and Miss Alice Scott, Supervisor 
of Instruction, Elwood, Indiana, for reading the manu- 
script and offering many helpful suggestions; to Miss 
Nellie V. Wedderspoon, Miss Sara A. Ward, Miss Eliza- 
beth M. Drumm, and Miss Helen A. Brown, teachers in

  THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
CHAPTER ONE 
Tue SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF Worps 
THE TRADITIONAL SPELLING MATERIAL 
— study of spelling has value for the child just to 
the extent that the words learned are the words 
that the child uses or that he will use in the near future 
in doing the writing involved in carrying on the every- 
day affairs of life. | This simple truth, so widely ac- 
cepted today, was Tittle understood in the past. As a 
consequence, curricula were filled with words of infre- 
quent use and of unusual difficulty. 
Large numbers of unusual words in spelling lists. 
The more recent offenders in this particular were the 
textbook makers and teachers, who by arbitrary selec- 
tion, or by comparison with the results obtained by per- 
sons follawing similar methods of investigation, com- 
piled long lists of words of special or limited use, includ- 
ing many technical terms from geography, history, gov- 
ernment, law, medicine, physiology, and the like. This 
material came from many sources, but was most fre- 
quently taken from textbooks. The result of this 
method of selecting words is seen in the following groups 
of words taken almost at random from a speller in com- 
mon use: dyspepsia, hydrophobia, sciatica, catarrh, 
eczema, rabies, gastritis, jaundice; macadamize, avoir- 
dupois, imperturbable, inexplicable, porte-cochére. 
Traces of the traditional material still found. Such 
compilations of words for spelling purposes, the prod- 
uct of a false conception of the aims and purposes of 
the teaching of spelling, have come down to us as a 
[1]

  THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
part of our inheritance from the past and have domi- 
nated the work of the school until quite recent years. 
Even yet traces of the traditional material are found in 
many schoolrooms. Time and effort spent in strug- 
gling for the mastery of words of this character are for — 
the most part time and effort wasted. By dint of de- 
termined effort and persistent drill the child may be able 
to master these words and to retain them throughout his 
school life. But when the school doors finally close be- 
hind him the old knowledge and skill have little value ; 
through disuse they soon pass away, while the child 
is left poorly equipped for the real demands of life. 
THE SOURCE OF SPELLING MATERIAL 
Improvement in the quality of spelling material de- 
pends upon the adoption of saner principles of selecting 
words. ‘The first principle of importance concerns the 
source of material. 
Hearing, reading, speaking, and writing vocabularies 
distinguished. Instead of constituting one large vocab- 
ulary of words, each word of which serves as occasion 
demands in the getting of thought in hearing and in 
reading, and the expression of thought in speaking and 
in writing, the words that we use are seen on closer ob- 
servation to fall into four more or less distinct groups 
which form the vocabularies of hearing, reading, speak- 
ing, and writing?7 A word of one vocabulary may or 
may not be found in the other vocabularies./ To illus- 
trate, the word face is familiar to us, whether we hear 
it spoken, see it on the printed page, or use it in speak- 
ing or writing. The same is not true of impregnable or 
imperturbable. 'The meaning of either is apparent 
when heard or read. Impregnable is common enough, 
also, to occur in our speech, but I doubt if we should 
[2]
-P-A-G-E-11
  
THE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS 
take any liberties with imperturbable. Probably 
neither word would be used commonly in writing, cer- 
tainly not by children. 
In short, there are kinds and degrees of acquaint- 
anceship with words as with friends. Some words are 
known to us only as we hear them spoken by other per- 
sons. Others are recognized in our reading but are 
strangers to our speaking and writing vocabularies. 
Finally, there are a few choice words with which we are 
so familiar that we use them with confidence to convey 
our thoughts to others. Among the latter are the 
words that we use in writing. 
. Words for spelling limited to the writing vocabulary. 
These distinctions between the hearing, speaking, read- 
ing, and writing vocabularies must be kept in mind in 
making word lists. It is evidently unwise to have a 
pupil spend the greater part of his spelling time upon 
words that appear only in his hearing, reading, or 
speaking vocabularies. (Obviously, the words that a 
child needs to know how to spell are in the main the 
words that he uses in writing. While the words of 
the writing vocabulary are common to the hearing, 
speaking, and reading vocabularies, and while the 
growth of the writing vocabulary is probably by way of 
hearing or seeing to speaking and then to writing, the 
writing vocabulary does not by any means represent a 
random selection of words from the other groups; 
rather,Gt consists of a relatively small number of the 
words most useful to the child in expressing his own 
thoughts. To select words for spelling from the read- 
ing vocabulary, as is commonly done, may not result in 
very serious mistakes in the lower primary grades, but 
the principle leads to vicious consequences if carried far 
up in the grades. 
[3]

THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
The writing vocabulary found in the spontaneous 
compositions of children and adults. [The restriction 
of the field of spelling material to the words actually 
‘used in writing makes the task of selecting words simple 
and definite. ['The words to be chosen for special drill 
in spelling are primarily the words found in the written 
compositions of children. J'This provides for the child’s 
present spelling needs. But, since it is our duty to an- 
ticipate in a measure the growing needs of the child, we 
must teach him also the words that he will probably use 
as an adult. ‘These are in all probability the words 
that adults now use, and are found in their written com- 
positions. In seeking to discover what words really 
form the child’s vocabulary, only spontaneous composi- 
tions should be considered, for in literal reproductions 
large numbers of the unassimilated words of the text are 
certain to be brought into the written work. 
Common words only to be taken for special study. 
Not all the words that children use spontaneously are 
of equal importance for spelling purposes. In general 
the words vary in value as the frequency of use. That 
is, only the commonest words should be chosen for 
special study. /In addition to the infrequent words, 
certain others should be omitted; namely, words of 
temporary use, words that are too easy, and words that 
are too difficult for children to learn to spell. For in- 
frequent, transient, and unusually difficult words the 
spelling should be indicated by the teacher when the 
word is required, or the children should use the diction- 
ary as the occasion demands. 
The advantages of taking the spelling material from 
the words most commonly used by children and adults 
in their spontaneous compositions are twofold: this pro- 
cedure does away with the necessity for the arbitrary 
[4]
-P-A-G-E-13
    THE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS 
exercise of opinion, which teachers have found to be a 
very difficult task; and it places the selecting of words 
upon a simple, natural, and matter-of-fact basis. 
Class word lists prepared by the teacher. LA com- 
mon practice among teachers of making up word lists 
from the written work handed in from day to day is 
valuable only to the extent that the teacher succeeds in 
hitting upon the common words. It is doubtful if the 
teacher can do this for a large number of words. The 
practice is useful in the way of emphasizing local needs 
and special difficulties, but does not take the place of a 
list based upon extensive concrete investigations. 
The work of choosing the commonest words from a 
series of compositions, while simple and straightfor- 
ward, is exceedingly laborious and time-consuming, as 
any one who will undertake the task may discover for 
himself. To get typical results for a word list of any 
size, it is necessary to examine many thousands of run- 
ning words. Unless there is a large amount of clerical 
assistance, the work is likely to extend into years. 
This makes it practically impossible for each teacher to 
work out extensive lists of words for herself. Fortu- 
nately, we have a number of reputable and extensive 
investigations which make the task unnecessary. 
CONCRETE INVESTIGATIONS 
A minimum list of common words. For the purpose 
of reporting in this book, a comparative study was 
made of the six important investigations of the words 
commonly used by children and adults in their written 
compositions. These included: (1) the Jones list of 
4532 words selected from an examination of more than 
15,000,000 words in the themes of 1050 school children ; 
(2) the Smith list of 1125 words, consisting of the 
[5]
-P-A-G-E-14
THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
commonest words in '75,000 running words in the spon- 
taneous compositions of the public school children of 
Madison, Wisconsin; (3) the Cook and O’Shea list, 
comprising 3200 of the most frequently used words in 
the compositions of thirteen adults; (4) the 1000 com- 
monest words found by W. E. Chancellor in letters re- 
ceived daily from many sources; (5) a list of 3470 com- 
mon words compiled from many sources, including the 
list of Dr. Burk, prepared by C. K. Studley and Allison 
Ware; and (6) a list of 1000 words, prepared by Ayres 
by combining the results of four concrete studies. 
The combined results of these six investigations are 
presented in Appendix B, which shows the words found 
in four or more studies. The total number of such 
words is 1254, This is the most reliable list of the 
words most commonly used by children and adults that 
can be made at the present time. The words may be 
taken as the minimum essentials of a course of study in 
spelling. In actual use it will be found necessary to 
supplement this list greatly. 
SPELLING BOOKS FREQUENTLY SHOW A POOR SELECTION 
OF WORDS 
Ayres’ study of the N. E. A. lists. As compared 
with this and similar lists of words, what showing is 
made by the spellers in daily use by teachers? )Atten- 
tion has already been called to the fact that cursory 
examination of many of the popular spelling books re- 
veals long lists of unusual words and technical terms 
taken indiscriminately from readers, histories, physiol- 
ogies, geographies, and the like. When more detailed 
comparisons are made, the disparity between the words 
of textbooks and the words selected on the basis of con- 
crete investigation appears more striking. On this 
[6]
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS 
point Dr. Ayres reports a comparison of the words of 
the National Education Association spelling lists used 
in the famous Cleveland tests of 1908 with his study of 
the vocabularies of 2000 business and personal letters. 
The results of the comparison show that of the 414 
words of the National Education Association list, only 
125 were found in the 2000 letters analyzed, while 289, 
or 70 per cent of the words, did not appear even once. 
A study of thirteen common spellers. The author 
has made a study of thirteen spellers now in general 
use to determine what per cent of the words of these 
spellers are contained in (a) the 3324 words common to 
two or more of the six investigations reported above, 
and (b) all the 6250 different words found in the sev- 
eral investigations. The comparisons were based upon 
random selections of pages from the texts in two grades, 
IV and VII. The results show that on the average only 
19 per cent of the words in Grade VII are contained in 
the smaller list, and only 35 per cent are contained in 
the larger list. For Grade IV the corresponding fig- 
ures are 57 per cent and 74 per cent. That is to say, 
about four fifths of the words of Grade VII and two 
fifths of the words of Grade IV are not found in the list 
of 3324 words common to two or more of the six investi- 
gations; about two thirds of the words of Grade VII 
and one fourth of the words of Grade IV are not found 
even once in the 6250 words of the six different investi- 
gations. 
/It is a significant fact, also, that spellers show little 
agreement among themselves in the words that they con- 
tain. In addition to Miss Arnold’s results reported be- 
low, we have the statement of Cook and O’Shea ! that of 
a total of 12,489 different words used in three spellers 
1Cook and O’Shea, The Child and His Spelling, 1914, page 226, 
ae
-P-A-G-E-16
THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
only 1613, or less than 13 per cent, were common to 
all the spellers. 
The need for discrimination in choosing texts. 'The 
purpose of the author is not to discredit all the spellers 
in common use, but rather to suggest the need for care- 
ful discrimination in choosing texts, and to give a stand- 
ard of values which may be applied in the criticism of 
textbooks and courses of study. In spite of the poor 
selection of words, almost any speller will show some 
point of excellence. However, the desire to emphasize 
some one principle, such as the phonic relationship of 
words or the contextual presentation of words, should 
not lead to the exclusion or subordination of other im- 
portant factors. The need of the day is a good, well- 
balanced, practical speller. 
THE NUMBER OF WORDS TO BE TAUGHT 
Another inheritance from the past which still causes 
a great waste of time and energy is the practice of 
teaching an extremely large number of words. It is not 
difficult to find in current use spelling books containing 
six, eight, ten, and even fifteen thousand words. \In or- 
der to meet the requirements of these voluminous texts 
it is found necessary to make the daily assignments cor- 
respondingly large, so that ten to twenty words are 
commonly given in a lesson. )Facts now well substan- 
tiated fail to support this practice. 
The number of different words used im writing. 
There is not a great variety of words in the writing vo- 
cabularies of children and adults. [Ayres * found that 
about nine words recur so frequently as to constitute 
one fourth of the whole number of words written, while

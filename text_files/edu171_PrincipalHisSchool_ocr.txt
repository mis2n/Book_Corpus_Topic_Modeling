  AUTHOR’S PREFACE 
Aw attempt has been made in this volume to do what in the 
industrial world is commonly spoken of as “‘job analysis.” 
The problem set has been an analysis of the work of a princi- 
pal or supervising principal in the organization, administra- 
tion, and supervision of instruction in an elementary school 
in a city, town, or county-unit school system, or of a super- © 
vising principal for a small group of closely related elemen- 
tary schools. In addition, at the beginning of the volume, 
there is a statement as to the importance and opportunities 
and possibilities of the principalship as it is possible to make 
it in our American school systems, and at the close attention 
is called to the constantly growing outside relationships of 
the school of which a principal must to-day take cognizance. 
This book, like the preceding volumes in this series by the 
present writer, is an outgrowth of a course offered at Stan- 
ford University. In the present case an effort has been 
made to place before university students of education the 
special technique of a limited field for which it seemed that 
definite and specific training should be given. The course 
has been listed and described in the university announce- 
ments as follows: 
44. The Principal and his School. A practical course, dealing 
with the problems of organization and administration of a single 
school, the supervision of instruction, school extension, community 
relationships, etc. A thesis on some administrative or supervisory 
problem required of each student. 
4 units, Spring Quarter (Cubberley) 
After giving this course for a few years, and working over 
the needed materials, I have now written up the course in 
book form, not only to give my own students the benefit of 
  MIDDLE TENNESSEE ceil

-P-A-G-E-4
  vi PREFACE 
clearer and better-thought-out statements and easier access 
to drawings and tables and references which cannot be so 
well presented in a lecture course, but also that I may. place 
in the hands of teachers of education elsewhere the results of 
what I have worked out. I have also materially enlarged 
my original list of questions and problems for students, and 
in its present form the book offers plenty of material for 
a four- to five-unit quarter course or a three- to four-unit 
semester course. 
The technique of school organization, administration, and 
supervision, from the point of view of the principal or super- 
vising principal, has by now been sufficiently worked out 
that there is a definite body of concrete experience and sci- 
entific information which should be taught to those who 
are looking forward to becoming principals of elementary 
schools in cities, towns, or county-unit school systems. 
Such a course is needed to-day in our schools of education 
for those men and women in training who are looking for- 
ward to administrative service in our public schools. The 
elementary-school principalship, too, is frequently a begin- 
ning position for many capable men who later rise to super- 
intendencies, and it is important that these men be trained 
for a high grade of professional service during their appren- 
ticeship period. 
A course of special training in the technique of the princi- 
palship ought also to be offered in our normal schools and 
teachers’ colleges, and be open to those young men and 
women of executive ability who are likely to find early serv- 
ice as principals of town or county-unit schools, or in city 
school systems. While the majority of the nearly six thou- 
sand elementary-school principals in our cities and towns are 
men, many very capable women are also entering the work, 
With the reorganization of our city school systems on the 
6-3-3 plan it is probable that most of the six-year elemen-
-P-A-G-E-5
  PREFACE Vii 
tary schools will in time come to be in charge of women 
principals, drawn from among those who have been gradu- 
ated from a normal school or teachers’ college rather than 
from among those who have been university trained. To 
offer special training that will better prepare their more ca- 
pable students for such executive work ought to be one of the 
functions of the normal school and teachers’ college. For 
this purpose a course specifically intended to prepare for the 
principalship is more directly practical than a course in city 
school administration. 
While designed primarily to organize the subject matter 
for a new course in school administration of a very practical 
type, this book also contains much that principals in service 
will find useful. That the work and duties outlined are 
greater than a new principal can cover in a single year is 
readily admitted; that they are greater than a principal 
should learn to handle is not. On the contrary, the type of 
elementary-school principal described herein is one that our 
schools need, and one that schools of education and teachers’ 
colleges must try to produce. As an aid in this work it is 
hoped that the book herewith presented may be of real 
service. 
It is also hoped that the book may contribute something 
toward magnifying the importance of the position of elemen- 
tary principal in our city and town-school organization, by 
revealing the possibilities for larger professional service, and 
in consequence may attract better and better trained men 
and women into the work. The organization of education 
during the past ten to fifteen years has gone forward by 
leaps and bounds, and there is every reason to think that the 
next ten to fifteen years will witness an even greater develop- 
ment in the scientific organization of the instructional pro- 
cess. This will call for sound professional training and gen- 
uine administrative and supervisory skill on the part of those
-P-A-G-E-6

who are to direct our schools, and this in turn must inevi- 
tably result in changing the principalship of an elementary 
school in our cities into a career of quite satisfactory emolu- 
ments and large professional importance. 
My thanks are due to many students who have provided 
me with concrete illustrative material covering actual school 
practices, and to six in particular for plans of the school 
buildings and grounds reproduced in Figures 5 to 10. Iam 
also especially indebted to Mr. William R. Rutherford, 
formerly superintendent of schools at Eugene, Oregon, and 
now in the educational service of the Navy, for help with the 
bibliographies and for permission to use some half dozen 
pages from his master’s thesis on the supervision of instruc- 
tion; to my colleague, Professor John C. Almack, for a num- 
ber of practical suggestions; and to Mr. Howard O. Welty, 
principal of the Lockwood Junior High School in Oakland, 
California, for having read the manuscript and suggested a 
number of changes and additions which his experience as an 
elementary-school principal indicated as desirable.

CHAPTER I 
TYPE FORMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION 
The unit for educational administration. The unit for edu- 
cational administration with us is the school district, though 
we have many different types of districts, and these vary 
much in size and in the scope of the school system which 
they maintain. We have rural-school districts, village- 
school districts, incorporated-town school districts, consoli- 
dated-school districts, county-unit school districts, small- 
city school districts, and large-city school districts. At one 
extreme is the little Southern or Western mountain school 
district, under the immediate control of three local trustees, 
and employing but one teacher. At the other extreme is 
the metropolitan-city school district, under a board of edu- 
cation and employing a staff of supervisory officers and 
thousands of teachers for the hundred or more schools it 
directs and maintains. Between these two extremes in size 
we find the village, town, consolidated, and small and 
medium-sized city school districts, each having problems of 
organization and administration more or less peculiar to 
itself. 
A common feature of practically all types and sizes and 
forms of school districts is the presence of a governing board, 
known as a board of school trustees, school committee, 
board of school directors, board of education, board for 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
/ 
\ \ 
  Aes THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
school control, or some similar title, which represents the 
people on the one hand and the State on the other in the or- 
ganization and administration of the schools. Only in some 
of the recently-organized commission-governed or business- 
manager type of cities do we find the board for school con- 
trol lacking. This board, acting under the school laws of 
the State, but also more or less independently, organizes and 
directs the administration of the schools under its charge. 
Supervision of the schools. The board, though, acts only 
when meeting as a body, and by recorded vote. Individu- 
ally, and outside of the board meeting, the members have no 
actual authority, though this is often assumed. To the 
teacher, if there be but one; to the principal, if there be two 
or more; and to a supervising principal or superintendent, if 
there be a number of schools, the board must entrust many 
of the details of organizing, supervising, and administering 
the work of the schools. As the school increases in size the 
number of functions and duties which must be entrusted to 
the principal and the superintendent naturally increase. 
/~Inalarge school building in a town, or in a city school sys- 
tem maintaining many schools, the principal of a school has 
many important duties and responsibilities. Upon him 
must rest, to a very large extent, the responsibility not only 
for the immediate supervision of the instruction in the 
school but for the smooth running of its administrative 
machinery as well. He must look after the details of organ- 
\ ization and administration, settle difficulties and problems 
as they arise, supervise the instruction, and direct and ad- 
minister his school as a unit in a larger organization or 
system. 
Specialization of the supervisory function. The tendency 
of our cities has been to specialize the supervisory function. 
Not only has the superintendent been given additional pow- 
ers, special supervisors been appointed, and bureaus for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  TYPE FORMS OF ORGANIZATION ee 
study of supervisory problems created, but the principal has 
been freed more and more from teaching and from clerical 
duties that he may devote a larger percentage of his time to 
the close supervision of the instruction in his school. More 
and more has the tendency grown to impose on him the re- 
sponsibility for the successful organization and administra- 
tion of his school and for the proper progress of the children 
in it. While this tendency has perhaps been more marked 
in the cities, where a principal directs but one of a number of 
units in a large school system, it has also been quite in evi- 
dence in town-school organization, where the school sys- 
tem is represented wholly or in large part by one large school 
building. 
To carry out the supervisory function successfully in a 
city calls for the organization of an adequate supervisory 
corps, under the general direction of and responsible to the 
superintendent of schools, and the unifying of the work of 
this corps that it-may render effective service. To the prin- 
cipal of the high school, one division and kind of work will 
fall; to the principal of the junior high school, atiother; to 
the elementary-school principals, another; and to the special 
supervisors, still another. Of all of these the principals of 
the elementary schools occupy a position the importance of 
which has seldom been fully realized or attained. 
It is of the work of the principal of an elementary school in 
a city, or the supervising principal in a city, town, or county- 
unit school organization, with which this volume of the se- 
ries will be concerned. Before taking up the work of sucha 
principal in detail, we shall first examine briefly the type 
forms for school organization which have so far been evolved, 
that we may have before us the different types of organiza- 
tion and work which we have to consider. We shall also ex- 
amine briefly the personal character of the service which the 
principal himself is expected to render,

THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Type forms of school organization. Passing at once to an 
examination of school organization as it relates to the princi- 
palship, we find a number of type forms in use in our Amer- 
ican cities and towns. The simplest form is the village or 
city elementary-school principalship, the principal being in 
charge of a small building containing from eight to twenty 
teachers in charge of the different school grades. The fol- 
lowing organization for a twelve-room elementary-school 
building may be regarded as fairly typical of that found 
in many towns and cities in different parts of the United 
States.

School grounds cover a quarter of a city block. 
A school system consisting of three or four such elemen-

which the principals may also teach a class, and one high- 
school building, and employing a total of 75 teachers and 
principals and having an average daily attendance of ap- 
proximately 1800 pupils, would be fairly representative of 
many cities in this country which have a total population of 
from 15,000 to 18,000 inhabitants. Such a city might be 
represented by the distribution shown in Figure 1. Quite 
frequently a city of such population-size would have a larger 
number of small school buildings and fewer large ones.

on the contrary, we find one third of the teaching force and

  8 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
The two building illustrations (Figs. 1, 2) may be taken as 
good examples of different sizes of the usual type of elemen- 
tary-school organization. In each we find the older type of 
eight-year graded school system, under the direction of a 
principal who has been freed from classroom teaching that 
he may devote all his time to the immediate problems relat- 
ing to the organization, administration, and supervision of 
the instruction in his school. While we sometimes find such 
a type of organization for as small as six- to eight-teacher 
buildings, on the one hand, and on the other in our large 
cities for still larger groups than the second illustration 
given above, perhaps it is safe to assert that the most com- 
mon type of eight-grade elementary-school organization 
now in use is the eight to twenty classroom building, and 
for each of which a principal who does not teach is em- 
ployed. 
Other types of elementary-school organization. The 
simplest form of variation from the type just described is 
that in which the two upper grades, and not infrequently 
the three upper grades, have been reorganized under what 
is known as the departmental type of upper-grade organiza- 
tion. Under this plan the lower grades are still taught by 
grade teachers, but the upper grades are taught by subjects 
and the pupils move about from teacher to teacher. Such 
a plan of combined grade and departmental organization 
may be worked out easily in any large elementary-school 
building. : 
Another simple variation from the grade type of organiza- 
tion is that in which some of the upper grades have been 
omitted. Where the junior high school type of school has 
been established in a city, the seventh and eighth grades are 
usually missing from the grade schools, these, together with 
the ninth grade from the high school, having been concen- 
trated in one or more central schools and organized under a

departmental plan of instruction. Sometimes one finds 
only the first five or four, or even three grades present in a 
school building, but in such cases the school is usually a 
primary school, feeding into some other elementary school 
not far away. 
The junior high school type of organization, or rather re- 
organization, has frequently been introduced.as much as a 
means of economically handling a congested-building prob- 
lem, presented by a city growing in population and not ex- 
panding in area, as because of its educational merits. Such 
a situation is well shown in Figure 2, which shows how the

Due to increase in population without increase in area, all schools became congested, and

same city used in Figure 1 handled a somewhat evenly dis- 
tributed population growth sufficient to necessitate the em- 
ployment of eighteen additional teachers, and by the erec- 
tion of but one new school building. One new junior high 
school building, erected at a central location, relieved the

high school building of caring for the ninth grade, and also 
took from all the elementary schools the seventh and eighth 
grades. These latter now become six-year elementary 
schools, and the school system has been changed from the 
8-4 plan of organization to the 6-3-3 plan. The new chil- 
dren in the first six grades in the city represented by the 
eleven additional teachers for grades one to six have been 
accommodated in the most economical manner possible, 
and at the same time a better form of educational organiza- 
tion has been obtained. 
The old (Figure 1) and the new (Figure 2) supervisory or- 
ganizations may now be contrasted, as follows:

In addition to these main types of schools — elementary, 
junior high, and high school — one finds other types of 
schools employing principals, in both city school districts 
and county-unit school districts. These include such spe- 
cial-type schools as evening schools, agricultural and tech- 
nical high schools, and special schools for some form of 
special instruction, such as industrial schools, parental 
schools, schools for defectives, etc. 
The following is typical of the administrative organiza- 
tion in a city school district employing a teaching and super- 
visory staff of approximately 200, or in a county-unit school 
system employing approximately 150 teachers and super- 
visors.

The group, or supervising principal. In all the types so 
far studied we have considered only the building principal. 
In a few of our cities another type of organization for the ad- 
ministration and supervision of schools has been worked 
out, which is known as the group or supervising principal. 
The essential features of the group plan are shown in Figure 
8, two forms or types of the group supervisory system being 
given. In each case a small group of schools is placed under 
the immediate control of a supervising principal, who looks - 
after the larger details of administration and supervises all 
the schools of the group, assisted usually by vice-principals 
in each of the buildings. These vice-principals usually teach 
a class, and hence have no time for supervisory and not 
much time for administrative duties. 
In cities having a number of small school buildings, lo- 
cated but short distances apart, some form of group super- 
visory organization is almost a necessity if economical and 
effective supervision is to be secured. In many cities now 
employing the group-principal plan for supervision, the real 
reason for so doing is the large number of small buildings lo- 
cated in close proximity to one another. Where large build- 
ings not too close together can be had, better school admin-  
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  12 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
istration and supervision can usually be secured by having a 
principal who does not teach for each elementary-school 
building. 
Desirable use of the group-principal idea. There is, how- 
ever, a certain use which may be made of the group- or 
supervising-principal idea which probably would lead to 
greater effectiveness in school administration and super-

Each group requires 53 teachers and a supervising principal. Each may be assumed to represent a section of a city, and to be bounded by street lines. The organization to the right is based on an eight-years’ elementary school, and a four-years’ high school; the one to the left on a six-years’ graded elementary school, a three-years’ junior high school, and a three years’ high school.

might even cost more. It is based on a combination of the

ter opportunities and instruction for children, and of (6) 
providing sufficient supervision and specializing it some- 
what in kind. Figure 4 illustrates the idea very well for a

Figures 4. ‘In.ustratine ANoTHER METHOD OF USING THE SUPERVISING 
Principat Inga 
In this river city of approximately 35,000 inhabitants the schools are so located and of such size as to permit of the organization of the city into three groups of five schools each, employ- ing 55, 56, and 54 teachers respectively, and for each of which groups a supervising principal is employed. In addition the principal for each elementary-school building is freed from class work half of each day for the administration and supervision of the school. ‘The central school in each group is an intermediate, or junior high school, and the three junior high schools send their pupils to the central city high school. Each supervising principal here is in effect an assistant superintendent of schools. As is explained in the text, this might also be a county-unit school system. 
The city, as will be seen from the drawing, is divided into 
three school groups, each group having four elementary 
schools and a junior high school. The kindergarten and 
only the first six grades are to be found in each of the 
elementary schools. The junior high schools contain the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, these being organized 
on the departmental plan. The central high school con- 
tains the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades of instruction. 
Under the plan shown in Figure 4, a woman probably 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
4 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  would be placed in charge of each elementary school as 
principal. This principal would teach half of each day, the 
schools here being small in size, and in addition she would 
handle the details of building organization and administra- 
tion. An additional teacher would be assigned to each pair 
of elementary-school buildings to relieve the principals, such 
additional teacher relieving the principal in one building of 
the pair by teaching her class in the morning, and the princi- 
pal in the other building of the pair by teaching her class in 
the afternoon. The principal in each junior high school 
might teach some one subject, such as mathematics or sci- 
ence, which would not require over half his time, the remain- 
der of the day being free for administrative and supervisory 
work. For each of the three supervisory groups, indicated 
by the dotted lines on the drawing, a supervisory principal 
would be provided. This officer would not teach, but would 
devote all his time to the supervision of instruction and to 
the larger features and problems of the organization and ad- 
ministration of the five buildings of his group. Details of 
administration would be handled by the building principal. 
The three supervising principals under such a plan as is 
shown in Figure 4 would be in effect assistant superintend- 
ents for the schools of the city, but with definite super- 
visory areas and duties assigned to them. 
This same plan of group-principal organization would ap- 
ply equally well to a county-unit type of school organiza- 
tion. If we imagine Figure 4 to represent a county school 
district, instead of a city, the fifteen schools of the drawing 
each to be a consolidated rural school under a principal who 
probably teaches part of each day, the high school to be 
a central county agricultural high school, and the three 
groups as shown to represent three subdivisions of the 
county for supervisory purposes, we would have a county- 
unit supervisory organization well worked out, such as
-P-A-G-E-31
TYPE FORMS OF ORGANIZATION 15 
  might be found in Utah or Maryland. The administrative 
principles involved would be practically the same, in either 
case. ‘ 
Effectiveness of building supervision. Whatever plan or 
combination of plans may be worked out for providing the 
needed supervision of instruction and the details of school 
building administration, either in city or in county-unit 
school systems, there can be no question but that plenty of 
close professional supervision pays and pays well. The hun- 
dred and one little details of building organization and ad- 
ministration need constant attention if smooth running con- 
ditions are to be expected. Where little things are con- 
stantly looked after big things seldom arise. The oversight 
of the material and educational surroundings of three to four 
hundred children assembled in one school building, if prop- 
erly done, will give a building principal plenty of occupation 
without any regular fixed classroom service. The physical 
conditions surrounding the work of instruction need to be 
looked after, the playground properly handled, children’s 
needs and difficulties attended to without undue delay, the 
school morale built up and maintained, parents seen and 
treated courteously, the progress of the children through the 
school watched and studied, and teachers helped and stimu- 
lated to do their best work. Upon the building principal 
falls very largely the task of creating the right conditions 
and atmosphere for the school. “As is the principal, so is 
the school,” is a much truer statement than the similar 
one relating to the teacher. 
Viewed from the standpoint of educational efficiency 
alone, a good school principal should pay for his services by 
reason of the more economical progress of the children 
through the grades. The acceleration ought to be greater 
and the retardation less by reason of the more scientific 
placement of pupils. The few comparative studies which
-P-A-G-E-32
16 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  have been made show that this is the case. The small out- 
lying schools of a city which do not have a principal freed 
from classroom instruction usually do not make the educa- 
tional progress of the large well-supervised city school, while 
the larger amount of retardation in our rural and small 
town schools, as compared with good city schools, is a mat- 
ter of common knowledge. The business of the school 
should be to get the children through the grades as rapidly 
as their abilities will permit. Not only do all our studies re- 
veal the heavy loss from school of retarded pupils, but also 
that children who reach the high school late usually make 
the poorest success with high school studies. On the other 
hand the bright pupils, who need to be singled out and 
helped along, because they are usually held back too much 
by the teachers, are the ones who should be pushed for- 
ward to the high school and given extra advantages. Such 
useful and economically important service pays largely, and 
amply justifies the presence and expense of a good building 
principal. 
How to organize and administer a school and produce 
conditions leading to most effective building or group super- 
vision is a problem that should interest every building or su- 
pervisory principal, in all types of school organization, and 
will be the subject of this volume in this series of textbooks. 
Before proceeding to the details of building organization, 
administration, and supervision however, we wish to devote 
two chapters to a consideration of the nature and work and 
opportunities of the principalship itself. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
‘1. State the disadvantages in school administration when the principal 
teaches the entire school day. 
2. If a principal were obliged by regulation to teach one hour a. day, 
would it be better that he teach one fixed class at the same period

a. Assume that the four large schools have individual principals who 
do not teach and the small school a principal who teaches, but no 
supervising principal. - 
b. Assume a supervising principal for the group, principals who 
teach for the small school and the large central school, and princi- 
pals who do not teach elsewhere. 
c. Assume a supervising principal for the group, a principal who 
teaches in the small school, and two additional teachers em- 
ployed to relieve the principals of the other schools each a half of 
every day.

CHAPTER II 
  THE PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 
Position of the principalship. ‘The principal of a schoolin-a 
city school system occupies a peculiar and somewhat confi- 
Be oaietto the nuperintendeaket See tem, and his connections with the superintendent’s office 
must be on a higher plane than if he were merely a teacher. 
The relationship is analogous in the business world to that 
of the manager of a town branch of a public utility to the 
general superintendent of the business; to that of the man- 
ager of a single department to the general manager of a de- 
partment store; to that of the superintendent of a division 
of a railroad to the president of the company; or to that of 
the colonel of a regiment to the commanding general of an 
army. In each case the manager or superintendent or presi- 
dent or general is responsible directly to the directors of the 
business or to the public authorities in charge for the larger 
outlines of policy and for the general success of the under- 
taking, while the subordinate in charge of a branch or a divi- 
sion or a regiment or a school is responsible only indirectly’ 
to the highest authorities, but is immediately responsible to 
the officer above him for the success of the division or unit 
entrusted to him for management and ccygol. {Still more, 
he is responsible for the management and rol of his divi- 
sion or unit in accordance with the larger lines of policy de- 
cided upon by the commanding officer and the directors of 
the business, regardless of whether or not he approves or 
knew of or had any part in formulating the policy to be fol- 
lowed. On any other basis a business courts bankruptcy, an 
army disaster, and a school system disorganization and inef- 
ficiency.  
-P-A-G-E-35
PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 19 
  Complementary nature of principal and superintendent. 
The principal of a school and the superintendent of a school 
system hold somewhat complementary positions in the ad-' 
ministration of a system of public instruction. The super- 
intendent. of the schools is primarily responsible to the 
school board and to the people of the whole city for the suc- 
cessful conduct of the whole school system; the principal is 
primarily responsible to the superintendent for the success- 
ful conduct of a single school, or, in the case of a supervising 
principal, a group of related schools. It is primarily the 
function of the superintendent to think and to plan and to 
lead; it is pri i inci: 
plans and to follow and to support. It is also the function 
of the superintendent of schools to pass upon and decide the 
more important matters referred to him from the schools 
and by the school board; it is the. function of the principal to 
aan ee as is possible, and 
to refer for decision only the more important questions to 
the central office above. A principal should be able to sense 
the superintendent’s policy, and to carry it out without 
bothering him continually for details. He should also note 
call the attention of the-superintendent-to-what seent to- 
i ni head. Both su- 
perintendent and principal must be alike able and willing to 
shoulder responsibility, to be frank and helpful to one an- 
other, and at times each must stand firmly in defense of the 
other. In a school system in which rapid progress is being 
made this is particularly important, as in such cases the 
progress in the schools often outruns the thinking of the 
people, and sooner or later a reaction is almost inevitable. 
Such a relationship calls for many important executive 
qualities, some of which unfortunately are not possessed by 
the majority of school people. Especially does it call for
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
tact, intelligence, convictions, good common sense, deep 
personal loyalty, technical knowledge, and a type of profes- 
_ sional skill not always found in those who think they would 
, make good school principals. 
The principal in the administrative organization. The 
larger the school system becomes the more marked will the 
relationship described above become. Often new plans will 
be considered in conference, and sometimes so decided, but 
often instead matured plans will merely be given to the 
group to execute. Whether or not the principal has had a 
part in the maturing of the plans so promulgated, he must 
now feel a personal responsibility for their application and 
detailed working out in his particular school, and must co- 
operate fully in an effort to insure the success of his part of 
the common undertaking. Success or failure, too, usually 
depends upon him alone. Closely as he is in touch with 
his teachers, he can determine almost absolutely the fate, in 
his school, of any policy the superintendent may inaugu- 
rate. 
Detailed conferences with subordinates are not possible in 
a large city school system. The superintendent of schools 
and the heads of departments under him, acting in conjunc- 
tion with the board of education, must settle many of the 
larger features of policy and plan in the administration of a 
large city school system, and this without taking the time to 
confer over each detail with the principals and teachers. 
There are too many things to be done in a large school sys- 
tem to proceed by a plan so wasteful of time and effort. 
Much of what is so decided upon the principal must take for 
granted, and as the basis upon which his own work is to be- 
gin and to be carried on. His functions will be much more 
those of execution, in his own school or group of schools, of 
plans which have been decided upon by authorities of larger 
scope, than of helping to formulate new plans and policies
-P-A-G-E-37
  PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 21 
for the school system as a whole. The superintendent, too, 
must often of necessity deal with problems only in the large, 
but the principal must work with these same problems in a 
much more limited and much more concrete way. The su- 
perintendent, too, often can present only the larger outlines 
of a plan which has been decided upon, and must leave to 
the principal the working out in his school of its smaller 
details. i 
It is such whole-hearted codperative team work that in- 
sures a successful supervisory organization. To refuse to 
coéperate whole-heartedly because he was not consulted, or 
because he does not approve of the new plan, represents a 
form of bumptiousness running very close to actual disloy- 
alty. Its exhibition ought to be clear notice to a superin- 
tendent and to a school board that a principal showing such 
characteristics is not one whom they can afford to advance 
further in the school system. If the new plan is funda- 
mentally wrong it will in time so demonstrate its defects 
that it will have to be withdrawn, and a succession of such™ 
failures means the ultimate withdrawal of the superintend- 
ent promulgating them. This, however, is for the board of 
education rather than the principal to decide. 
Team work within the system. The conduct of all codp- 
erative undertakings, whether in business, sports, warfare, 
or education, calls for good team work on the part of all 
holding responsible positions on or in the team. Without 
team work, full and complete victories, in which all in a way 
share, cannot be won. Not only does each member of the 
team have a particular place to play and to fill, but for 
success each must also know the essential details and 
working rules of the game asa whole. The full philosophy 
of the game all do not need to know — that may be left 
largely to the leaders or directors. In school work this calls 
for intelligent direction and oversight from the top. On
-P-A-G-E-38
22 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  the part of those responsible for the success of the different 
administrative units of the school system — the principals 
— it calls for a high degree of individual efficiency, ability 
to shoulder responsibility, willingness to codperate whole- 
heartedly, unity in carrying out a purpose, loyalty in sup- 
port and defense of a plan, and at times self-effacement for 
the good of all. 
One of the places where self-effacement is most frequently 
called for in the practical work of administering a school sys- 
tem is in the matter of credit for new ideas and achieve- 
ments. Some otherwise satisfactory people seem incapaci- 
tated for team work in this respect. They not only want 
more than full credit for any new ideas they may de- 
velop, but not infrequently they want to keep a monopoly 
of the good ideas to themselves, so that their schools may 
seem better than the average of the system. They seem 
never to have learned that there is always glory enough to go 
_ around for all who deserve it. Not infrequently the same 
bad spirit manifests itself in jealousy of more progressive 
and more capable principals. They utterly fail to see that 
all energy spent in jealousy and internal dissension not only 
destroys their own highest efficiency, but also seriously in- 
terferes with effective team work within the system. The 
man filled with envy or carrying a constant “grouch” never 
inspires confidence, and is always relatively ineffective in 
any position that calls for leadership. f 
Personal qualities demanded. The position of principal 
in a school system, then, is a position of strategic impor- 
tance. The larger the school system becomes the more stra- 
tegic becomes the position of principal. A superintendent is 
almost entirely dependent upon the frankness and loyalty - 
of a principal for information regarding the school and the 
community, and for recommendations as to rieeded changes 
in the work of the school. Upon the educational insight,
-P-A-G-E-39
  PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 23 
largeness of vision, good nature, ability in administration, 
discretion, tact, personal loyalty, and frankness in discus- 
sion of the principals of a school system the success or failure 
of the policies evolved for the conduct of a school system in 
large part depends. The principal should feel that he rep- 
resents the administration before the teachers, before the 
children, and before the parents, and that he acts largely in 
the place of and in the name of the superintendent of 
schools. 
Misunderstandings of policy, manifestations of narrow- 
minded personal enmity, bitter political attacks, and se- 
vere newspaper criticism of the schools must at times be ex- 
pected, so long as human nature remains what it is. To be 
frank enough to discuss plans freely with the superintend- 
ent, when asked; to be discreet enough not to talk outside 
about matters still under discussion; to be able to retain 
confidences granted; to be willing whole-heartedly to try to 
put plans into operation, even though they differ from what 
one might have wished; to labor to prevent. or to remove 
misunderstandings by explaining plans and purposes; to 
bear responsibility without shirking; and at times to put 
one’s back to the wall and stand solidly in defense of the 
system — calls for personal qualities that always command 
a good market price because they are not overabundant in 
this world. To be able and willing to give an opinion when 
requested, to state one’s evidence and to draw conclusions, 
to shoulder responsibility when occasion demands, and to 
carry through necessary but disagreeable duties, calls for a 
quality of intelligence and a degree of courage and loyalty 
that will always command a premium in this world. 
Special qualifications for the office. In addition to the 
right personal qualities, the position of school principal also 
calls for certain special qualifications. To be a good princi- 
pal one should be a good teacher, should know the details of
-P-A-G-E-40
    “24 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
school organization and administration, and should have a 
reasonably satisfactory philosophy of the educational proc- 
ess which he is to supervise. These may be regarded as 
rather fundamental prerequisites. The principal ought to 
be able to take a class from any teacher and teach it well, 
and he ought to know the details of school organization and 
the reasons for doing things in certain ways better than all 
except a few of his older and more capable teachers. In ed- 
ucational grasp, as shown by his ability to supervise and to 
give reasons for doing things, he ought to be distinctively 
the educational leader of his school. 
In addition to these purely educational qualifications, the 
person who would be principal must also possess that some- 
thing so hard to test for or to define but which is known and 
recognized as executive capacity. This is a compound of 
many personal qualities and working habits. On-the personal 
side, cleanliness, courtesy, good manners, and kindliness are 
important. A good executive is seldom a sour, discourteous, 
ill-mannered boor. Good working habits — promptness, 
speed and accuracy in work, a sense of order and system, 
and a good time sense — all are important. Without a feel- 
ing for punctuality and order and accuracy, and that sense 
of proper values which makes one continually conscious of 
passing time and the value of minutes, work is almost cer- 
tain to pile up and the would-be executive will find himself 
continually behind in his work and late to his engagements. 
Still more, he is not likely to attract the attention of men 
who possess these fundamental traits. 
A good sense of proportion, too, will be of use in revealing 
relative values, and in indicating relative time-worths of 
different executive details. Some things need to be done 
now, other things can wait until to-morrow. The ability to 
grasp details, to see the problem almost before it has been 
fully stated, to see what ought to be done and why, and to -
-P-A-G-E-41
  PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 25 
decide quickly and accurately on most questions that come 
up, are also very important ear-marks of an executive. The 
man who cannot decide anything without thinking it over 
at length, or whose quick decisions are twenty-five per cent 
wrong has little business in an executive position. Ninety 
per cent of the administrative questions and problems that 
come to an executive are questions and problems that he 
ought to be capable of deciding quickly and accurately, and 
then promptly dismiss them from his mind. Only a few 
questions and problems need sleeping over. 
Ability to grasp and hold in mind numerous details, and 
to see details in their proper places and relationships, is an- 
other important characteristic of an executive. The man 
who cannot remember what he did yesterday, who has to 
keep and refer to notes as to his actions, and who cannot dis- 
tinguish details from important central ideas, is not likely to 
make a very successful executive. Still another executive 
characteristic is the ability to shed details, to get them 
handled by others, to avoid deadening office routine, and to 
save time for the more important things that are to be done 
about a school. Not to do for long what others can do, in 
order to find time to do what others cannot do, is an impor- 
tant mark of executive capacity. 
Every one has been told that the way to get ahead in this 
world is to do more than is expected of him, but not every 
one knows how to carry this precept into action. The qual- 
ities which most frequently impede the progress of men are 
lack of knowledge, lack of self-confidence, and idle habits of 
thought without the thought leading to action. Perhaps 
the best possible prescription for overcoming the first two 
and correcting the third is to daily do something that is in 
addition to one’s daily duties. The effort to be useful in 
some new way, or to master some new idea or process, leads 
to the acquirement of knowledge, gives self-confidence, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
26 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  carries thinking into action in one of the best of ways. Men 
who continually do this soon set themselves off from their 
fellows by reason of their larger knowledge, ability to do 
new things, and their habit of being serviceable in some new 
and unexpected way. They soon come to know so much 
and to be so useful that they make themselves indispen- 
sable. Ordinary natural ability and hard work are worth 
more than genius here. 
The personal equation. Frequently otherwise good prin- 
cipals fail to achieve a high degree of success because of what 
for lack of a better term may be called “the personal equa- 
tion.” Every principal ought, once in a while, seriously to 
inquire of himself if he is, in his personal and official rela- 
tions with teachers, pupils, and the public, all that he is ask- 
ing his teachers and pupils to be. To many a boy and girl in 
school the principal is the only example of a man in the 
teaching profession they will ever come in close contact with, 
and the estimate of the profession, good or bad, of many a 
citizen of to-day goes back to the impressions of his school 
days. The principal must remember that he holds a par- 
ticularly responsible position as a model in his community, 
somewhat corresponding to that of the priest in the parish 
under the old régime of the church. He must, in his dress, 
his manner, his speech, and his bearing so conduct himself 
that he will easily win and hold the respect of those 
teachers and pupils who have grown up under the best 
home influences, and who know the best social usages and 
practices of the world. 
To this end he must remember to carry himself at all 
times as a gentleman of the world should and would. He 
must be clean, both in his person and in his speech and acts. 
His clothing, his cuffs and collar, and his shoes should be 
kept in good condition. His hair should be trimmed fre- 
quently, and kept clean and neatly combed. He must be
-P-A-G-E-43
PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 27 
  careful to shave every morning. There must be nothing of- 
fensive about his breath or his person. On the streets and 
about his school, at least, he must not smoke. He must not 
frequent places where gentlemen do not go. In his dealings 
with his teachers he must be impartial, considerate, and 
just, and must show no special attentions and play no fa- 
vorites in the group. His statements must be absolutely re- 
liable; he must not shilly-shally to and fro; and his loyalty 
and support of both teacher and superintendent should be 
unquestioned. 
Every executive, too, needs a good saving sense of humor. 
Many a situation is partly solved by laughing over it, or at 
least seeing its humorous side. In all his contacts with 
teachers, pupils, and parents he must seem both genuine and 
human. Pompous dignity will count for nothing, nor will a 
too familiar manner inspire respect. Freakish clothes, a 
singular manner, obsequiousness, or roughness and lack of 
consideration for others must all be equally avoided. 
Given good personal qualities, good training, good execu- 
tive sense, energy, industry, the ability to concentrate his 
efforts, studious habits, and the willingness to postpone pres- 
ent pleasures for the sake of a larger future, a young man 
or woman, entering the principalship in a city school sys- 
tem to-day, should be able to succeed in a large way. The 
service is important, and the scope of one’s influence larger 
than most principals realize. 
Importance of the office. We are not likely to overesti- 
mate the importance of the office of school principal. As 
the superintendent of schools gives tone and character to the 
whole school system, so the school principal gives tone and 
character to the school under his control. In the adminis- 
tration of a school system the superintendent should tend 
to magnify the office of school principal. Whatever can 
be done to add strength and dignity and responsibility to
-P-A-G-E-44
28 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  the office should be done, with a view to making each princi- 
pal feel that his work is large and important, and that he 
must keep growing constantly if he is to continue to measure 
up to the demands of the position. Everything pertaining 
to his school should pass through his hands, and the posi- 
tion should be made one of definite and fixed responsibility. 
The knowledge, insight, tact, skill, and qualities of help- 
ful professional leadership of the principal of the school 
practically determine the ideals and standards of achieve- 
ment of both teachers and pupils within the school. The 
best supervisory organization cannot make strong schools 
where principals are weak and inefficient, while a strong 
and capable principal can develop a strong school even in 
cities where the general supervisory organization is weak and 
the professional interest of teachers is low. The mere fact 
that helpful supervision is so predominantly personal in its 
nature and methods gives to the office of school principal 
large potential importance. 
That our school principals, speaking generally and of 
the United States as a whole, realize the full possibilities of 
their position, few who have carefully observed principals 
at work would contend. Many principals give their time 
almost entirely to administrative duties and do little super- 
visory work, though the latter ought to be their most im- 
portant function. Of those who do supervisory work, many 
fail to make their supervision helpfully constructive to the 
teachers supervised. 
Often the principals are not wholly or even largely to 
blame for such a condition. Where the principal is given 
little authority to vary anything, or to depart from a pre- 
scribed uniformity, supervision easily degenerates into in- 
spection and the office work exerts the strongest pull. Even 
good principals gradually lose their energy and their capacity 
for usefulness under such administrative conditions. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 29 
breaking up of uniformity and rigidity in administration, 
the placing of authority with and responsibility on the princi- 
pals, and the awakening on their part of a desire to excel, 
are among the best means a superintendent can employ to 
imptove the work of the school principal. If principals do 
not know it, the difference between office-chair administra- 
tion and clerical perfection on the one hand, and helpful and 
constructive supervision on the other, should be clearly set 
forth and emphasized in the administration of the system. 
Difficult situations. Sometimes a principal finds himself 
in the peculiar situation of sensing much more clearly what 
ought to be done than do the supervisory officers over him, 
and he finds himself chafing under the directions given as 
to work, or the limitations and restraints and office detail 
which the administration imposes upon him. The question 
now arises as to what should be the principal’s attitude and 
action under such circumstances. 
Tn the first place, the principal should be very sure that he 
is in the right. Possibly he is setting himself up as an au- 
thority in opposition to the superintendent on very inade- 
quate grounds. The superintendent may know what ought 
to be done better than he. The public presumption is likely 
to be in the superintendent’s favor in case of any conflict, 
“and opposition may be regarded, as it not infrequently is, as 
mere bumptiousness on the part of a young fellow who is be- 
ginning to feel his oats. 
On the other hand, the principal may be right, and in such 
a case he needs to consider his actions and attitude very 
carefully. He is always at liberty to talk over the situation 
with his superiors, and, if he is pleasant about it, and uses 
ordinary tact in selecting his time and method of approach, 
he will seldom encounter any difficulty in having his point 
of view heard and considered. Should he find himself un- 
able to convince his superior officers that they are wrong and  
-P-A-G-E-46
- 80 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  that he is right, he ought either to follow instructions and 
execute policies or resign. Refusal to obey instructions is 
not likely to accomplish anything. Only in the rarest of 
circumstances is one warranted in open rebellion, and he 
who chooses this method should remember that there are 
very few successful rebels in history, and that failure means 
professional disaster. 
It is a truism that if one is to command he ought first to 
have learned to obey. This does not mean that a principal 
surrenders his professional opinions to’a school board or to a 
superintendent when he becomes a paid employee in the 
school system. His right to these he retains, and as a citi- 
zen or in an educational meeting he is privileged to vote and 
speak as he thinks. His right to exploit these ideas in the ad- 
ministration of his school, however, in opposition to the ex- 
pressed wishes or directions of those in positions of larger 
responsibility over him, is not a right which he retains when 
he enters employment as principal of a particular school in 
a particular school system. By entering the employment 
he from that time forth owes allegiance to the policies and 
plans as regularly determined for the school system, and if he 
cannoterender such allegiance he should resign and find em- 
ployment in a school system where he is in sympathy with 
the policies, and can codperate fully and loyally with the 
authorities. 
Personal relationships. Sometimes the problem which a 
principal faces is one of personal relationships between the 
superintendent and himself. He may not feel that the su- 
perintendent treats him properly, that he does not allow 
him to exercise proper authority in his school, that he does 
not uphold him in his actions and decisions, or that the su- 
perintendent decides against him without giving him an ad- 
equate hearing. Such situations at times arise, but before 
taking any action the principal ought to be very sure that he
-P-A-G-E-47
PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 31 
  is not himself mistaken. A slow, retiring, somewhat moody, 
and quite sensitive principal may easily imagine difficulties 
of this type which have no real existence, and may take as 
personal slights the inattention or quickness of decision of a 
very busy man. The stronger the superintendent and the 
larger the problems he faces, the more likely he is to think 
and act quickly. Often he will sense the situation and make 
a quick decision before the principal thinks he has had time 
to grasp the problem. Often, too, he has too many things 
to do in a day to waste time in listening to long stories, read- 
ing and answering long letters, or spending an undue pro- 
portion of his time on any one case. ‘Every executive is 
familiar with the type of man — with school people more 
common among men than among women — who cannot 
state a case quickly, who cannot set forth the crux of a situ- 
ation without burying it under a mass of irrelevant details, 
who writes letters pages long, who feels that if he gets a 
quick decision his case has not been properly considered, 
and who often experiences difficulty in getting away from 
the office after his business is done. Such people often feel 
slighted and hurt when the trouble lies with themselves. 
On the other hand, the superintendent ought to be very 
careful to treat the principal as the executive head of a 
school should be treated, to uphold and strengthen his au- 
thority as the head of the school, and to be very considerate 
of his feelings if at times he feels compelled to reverse his 
decisions. The superintendent is more likely to see a situa- 
tion from a larger point of view than the principal, and an 
intelligent man will accept occasional reversals in a good 
spirit and in no way as a personal slight. 
If, on the other hand, the principal, after long and careful 
thinking over the matter, feels that the superintendent does 
not treat him in a professional manner, and that the super- 
intendent’s attitude toward him and his work is undermin-
-P-A-G-E-48
  32 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ing his usefulness as principal of the school, the thing to do 
is to await a good opportunity and then lay the matter 
frankly before the superintendent. If done at a time that is 
opportune, and done without bitterness and in apparent 
good spirit, there are few superintendents who will not listen 
carefully to a principal’s statement of his case and try to 
make hirn feel satisfied in the future. In presenting his case 
the principal must do it tactfully, frankly, and without any 
evidence of bad temper, and he should accept the superin- 
tendent’s assurances as genuine and drop the matter. Ifno 
improvement in relations then results the principal has three 
courses open to him. One, and probably the best one, is to 
go ahead and do his work and try to forget the whole mat- 
ter. A second is to appeal over the superintendent’s head 
to the board of education for just treatment. The third is 
to move to some position elsewhere where he may expect to 
be treated differently. Which one of these lines the princi- 
pal should follow must depend on the particular situation 
involved, and will call for the exercise of the principal’s best 
judgment. 
What the principalship offers. The principalship of a 
school in an American city to-day offers unusual opportuni- 
ties for personal growth and for community service to the 
person who is studiously inclined and interested in children. 
Of all places in the school system, if the principal uses his 
time well, the principalship offers the largest opportunities 
for study and personal growth. This is equally true whether 
one regards the position as a permanent career or as an 
apprenticeship for a superintendency elsewhere. As a 
permanent occupation the position offers large opportuni- 
ties and leisure to the student. The monetary prizes are 
not so large as in business or the professions, but on the 
other hand there are few blanks. Success and steady em- 
ployment are more certain, and failure and bankruptcy much
-P-A-G-E-49
—— ee 
PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 33 
less common. To the student the position makes a strong 
appeal. The school work, day by day, can be made experi- 
mental and fruitful, professional books and magazines can 
usually be had free of cost for reading and study, and the 
regularity of work and the long vacations permit a plan- 
ning of one’s life work not possible in most lines of human 
endeavor. 
To one to whom some form of social service makes an ap- 
peal, the position of school principal offers advantages al- 
most unequaled elsewhere in a city for a very important and 
useful type of community service. Few who serve a city 
have such opportunities for constructive work. Many of our 
cities have men and women who have served twenty-five to 
thirty years or more as the principal of one school building, 
and whose work has in consequence deeply moulded the 
lives of a generation of the people. Not infrequently we 
find new school buildings named after such principals, in 
grateful recognition of long and devoted service. 
A student’s opportunity. Viewed from the standpoint of 
an apprenticeship for larger work later on, the principalship 
is also a student’s opportunity. Four or five years may well 
be spent in an elementary-schoo] principalship by one who 
desires to train himself for a school superintendency. Such 
an apprenticeship, if rightly used, more than doubles the ef- 
fectiveness of his previous collegiate and professional prep- 
aration. During these years the principal must be a stu- 
dent of educational processes in his school, and must save as 
much time as possible for careful reading and study along 
the lines of his future profession. 
He should also, during these years, gradually crystallize 
for himself a good working educational philosophy, to guide 
him in his later work and to vitalize all his later educational 
procedure. He must seize intelligent hold on the concep- 
tion that education stands for the higher evolution of both
-P-A-G-E-50
  34 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the individual and the race, and must relegate to their 
proper place in the educational scheme all the details of or- 
ganization, administration, and instruction. Without such 
a guiding conception administrative work soon becomes dull 
and fruitless routine, and the principal sooner or later sinks, 
-as so many do, to the level of a professionally dead and inef- 
fective office worker. i 
Learning and working. During these years of appren- 
ticeship one who would rise to a superintendency should ac- 
cumulate a good working library along the line of his major 
interests. He should keep closely in touch, too, with all 
advancements and important experiments in his field, and 
with what other workers elsewhere are doing. He should 
welcome new school tasks, making himself as professionally 
useful as possible, and should take a deep personal satisfac- 
tion in doing difficult things. He should give himself prac- 
tice in developing an ability to speak easily and briefly, and 
to write clearly and convincingly. He should mix some- 
what with practical men of affairs, partly to counteract his 
daily life with women and children, and partly because from 
such men he can learn much that will be very useful to him 
later on. The acquaintance of some successful and: older 
doctor, or lawyer, or banker in the community may prove 
well worth his time and attention. If the opportunity of- 
fers to join a discussion club, especially if composed of men 
older and more mature than himself, he should avail him- 
self of it. Lodges, purely social organizations, bridge-whist 
clubs, and similar affairs he will probably do well to keep 
out of. Unless he is in need of social polishing, dances and 
parties should be indulged in rather sparingly, they being 
wasteful of time and energy and having in them little that is 
of permanent value. If his salary does not seem large 
enough to cover both married life and study, he should for a 
time resolutely put marriage aside. If he does marry, he 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  PRINCIPALSHIP AND THE PRINCIPAL 35 
should be very sure that the woman he marries is in sym- 
pathy with his work, is his equal in education and ambition, 
and is in other respects his superior. With so many good 
women inthe world’ 4 man shotld never marry beneath him. 2B 
It requires concentration of effort and will power to carry 
through such a program, as well as a willingness to make so- 
cial and other sacrifices for the sake of the larger future. 
These many young people are not willing to make, but, 
given brain power, and manners, and tact, and quickness of 
action, those young people who are willing to sacrifice the 
present for the sake of the future will inevitably hold the im- 
portant places a decade or two ahead. 
The young man must, during these years of apprentice- 
ship, willingly accept work and burdens that lead toward 
his desired goal, and resolutely reject those which do not. 
He should know and remember that the habit of hard and 
faithful work is one that is established but slowly; that it re- 
quires close watching of one’s pole star to establish it;.and 
that it is not fully established in most men before thirty-five 
to forty years of age. He should also remember that it 
requires thirty to forty years of careful preparation to get 
ready to do something really large in life. Too many men 
never accomplish much because they dissipate their ener- 
gies in pleasure, in family life, or in taking part in dozens 
of things they ought to let alone. One must concentrate his 
energies to a purpose and work hard if he expects to ac- 
complish much in this world. 
The principalship of a school then must be considered as 
one of the most desirable of all educational positions. In 
opportunities for a studious life, as well as in salary, it ranks 
fairly well with that of a teaching position in a college. To 
the man with the habits and instincts and aspirations of a 
student there are few vocations in which one can realize bet-
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 THE PRINCIPAL AND. HIS SCHOOL 
ter the ideals of his life. No other person in the school sys- 
tem can do so much good at first hand, no other person in 
the community can so immediately mould its life and shape 
its ideals, and the opportunities for personal culture and 
pleasure are very large to the man or woman who will use 
them. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. What about the common excuse, given so often by schoolmen for fail- 
ure to follow instructions or a plan, that they are too deeply interested 
in the child — that the child is more important to them than the sys- 
tem? 
2. Show how a principal may help to ward off criticism of a city school 
system, or may help to bring it on, by the way in which he handles his 
administrative duties. 
8. Show that people lacking a time sense, regardless of ability, must al- 
ways work on a lower plane of efficiency than those of equal ability 
who have it. 
4. It is often stated that successful people are set off from unsuccessful 
people largely by their practice of utilizing little opportunities to im- 
prove themselves or to be useful, which opportunities unsuccessful 
people neglect. Illustrate. 
5. If the principalship is such a strategic position, how do you account 
for our long failure to realize the possibilities of the office? 
6. Distinguish between the rights and the obligations of a principal when 
in his official relations and when out of school as a citizen. Even as a 
citizen does he have complete liberty? 
7. Explain more fully what is meant by the statement that the principal 
should build up for himself a guiding educational philosophy, and the 
* importance of doing this.
-P-A-G-E-53
  CHAPTER III 
GENERAL NATURE OF THE PRINCIPAL’S WORK 
Range of duties. The range of duties devolving upon a 
building principal is determined somewhat by the size of the 
school system in which he works. If the system is a small 
one and the superintendent is teaching part time in the high 
school, or if the system is a large one and the superintendent 
is engrossed with problems of policy and procedure and can 
give but little time to supervision — then in either case the 
work, of the principal must include many duties and respon- 
sibilities, in both school organization and administration, 
which do not come to a principal working in a school system 
of medium size. The three classes of situations commonly 
met, with may be briefly described, as follows: -\ 
As Small city system. City of 6000 to 10,000 inhabitants. 
( Superintendent also principal of-high school, and teaches 
) part time. Two to three grade schools, with principals. 
{ Many administrative duties on superintendent, and little of- 
| fice assistance. Principal here must assume many adminis- 
| trative and supervisory duties. 
'B. Medium-sized city system. City of 20,000 to 60,000 inhabitants. 
| Superintendent does not teach, and has time for supervi- 
sion. One high school, and four to eight grade buildings un- 
| der principals. Principals now partially relieved of many ad- 
{ ministrative and supervisory functions, or carry these out in 
( _ conjunction with the superintendent. 
1C. Large city system. City of 75,000 inhabitants and upward. 
H Practically no supervision by superintendent. Principals 
\ responsible for organization, administration, and supervision 
of buildings. Can make or break the superintendent, as far 
_\ as work in his building is concerned. Loyalty to policies 
\ mow extremely important, and more often lacking than in B 
\. or A types,
-P-A-G-E-54
38 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
From the above classification it will be seen that not all 
principals perform the same duties or shoulder the same 
responsibilities. All principals, though, perform the same 
general types of duties, and these general types may be clas- 
sified under four main heads: 
1. Organization duties. 4, 
2. Administrative duties. ~~ 
8. Supervisory duties. ~~ 
4. Social duties. 
  We shall consider each of these briefly here, and more in de- 
tail in the four main divisions of the book which follow. In 
each of these four aspects of the work the principal must 
possess a reasonable degree of knowledge and skill if he is to 
become a successful worker. ( 
Organization duties. As an organizer a principal will 
naturally be given greater liberty in some school systems 
than in others, even of the same size and type, but in all 
school systems a certain amount of organizing will havé to 
be done. In aschool in a type A school system, the amount 
will be small. Ina school in a type B school system, though 
the amount may be large, it will be carried on so closely in 
conjunction with the superintendent that the actual think- 
ing required of the principal may be less. In a school in a 
type C school system, the amount may be quite limited, due 
to all being required to work under uniform regulations, jor, 
on the other hand, it may be quite large, due to the es i 
tive given to principals to effect independent organizatian. 
Much will depend here on the character of the superin- 
tendent and the traditions of the school system. { 
In any case, though, and wherever he works, the princi- 
pal will be called upon to think out his peculiar local ent 
lems and to organize his school in the best manner possible 
for effective eobperctive service Whi Tie tendency, AoW

success of a school principal. In the chapters which follow

Administrative duties. After a consideration of the prob- 
lems of organization, we shall next take up the administra- 
tive work of a school principal. As_an administrator the

board of education and the central office on the one hand, 
and the teachers, children, and parents of his school on the 
other. Standing, as he does, in close touch and harmony 
with the teachers of his building, he can usually determine 
the success or failure in his school of any new administrative 
policy which is proposed.

a professional supervisor.

with courtesy when frankness is called for, and at 
courage and conviction. Occasionally he will find it n 
sary to assume control and command the situation: at other 
times he will offer good advice; again h “> hasCutio.aer 
and take what he can get; and at stiJ enon times he must 
execute orders and not question whye. c"will call for much 
good judgment to know which réle to assume as different 
situations present themselves. He must know his rights 
and also his duties; know when to stand firm and when to go 
slowly; have a genius for quickly getting close to the heart 
of every situation and deciding what ought to be done; 
know the meaning of loyalty to the decisions of those in au- 
thority; be able to establish fixed places of authority in his 
school and to have that authority met; and know how to 
handle difficult situations with both firmness and tact. To 
have a good grasp of the fundamental principles involved in 
proper school administration, and to settle problems arising _. 
in the light of these principles, is one of the surest means of 
handling difficult situations correctly. 
It should be the aim of every principal to settle wisely and 
satisfactorily as many difficult situations as possible; to refer 
as few cases as possible to the central office for decision; and 
to have the smallest possible number of appeals from his de- 
cisions go to the central office. Few surer means than just 
this ability could be thought out for winning the approval 
of those above for his administrative skill. 
Supervisory duties. It is upon the two aspects of organi- 
zation and administration that many principals spend most 
of their time'and energy. Often clerical and administrative 
duties are allowed to so monopolize the principal’s time 
that the central office can usually depend upon finding him 
at work in his office chair at any time in the day they may | 
call him on the telephone. Gilbert has well described this 
older type of office principal, in the following words: 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
    
       
  RINCIPAL AND HIS.SCHOOL 
icroachment of petty duties is insidious. The many little 
ds upon the principal’s time, calls for books or supplies, 
Pauses of discipline, long visitations with callers, answering tHe tele- 
phc ae, and reports — always reports — are so insistent that, un- 
less the is very watchful, more and more time will be given to them 
until he becomes that most ineffectual, that deadest of pedagogues, 
the office principal. Every superintendent knows him. He is al- 
ways there, in his chair at his desk. Seldom can he be surprised 
away from his customary spot and if he is, he apologizes. > 
It is because this description is so often true, and because 
the newer demands on the school require that it be 
changed, that we have recently heard so much criticism of 
the work of the school principal. 
Board-of-education rules place their emphasis here, and 
neglect of administrative duties is hard to conceal from the 
central office. The emphasis placed on this aspect of a 
principal’s work may be seen from a recent tabulation of du- 
ties by Boggs, covering the rules and regulations as to prin- 
cipals in thirty selected American cities.

In contrast with this is a recent study by McClure, in which

Sometimes the office type of principal is, in addition, 
quite a community leader and organizer, and renders useful 
service in lines of civic betterment and school improvement. 
This often tends to excuse his failure in supervision. The 
organization and administration of his school is excellent, 
and he is a leader in community welfare. This is all very 
good in itself, but the teachers in his school receive but little 
helpful supervision from him. 
Importance of the supervisory function. Yet the supervi- 
sion of instruction, that the education of children may pro- 
ceed under better conditions and be more effective in re- 
sults, is the prime purpose of freeing the principal from 
teaching, and is the end and goal toward which the organiza- 
tion and administration of the school should tend. All 
other work is in a sense preliminary to this larger function. 
‘he broader professional knowledge and insight of the prin- 
 Cipal must find expression in the daily work of the teachers 
and pupils if his largest usefulness as a principal is to be ren- 
dered. To this end he must reduce his office work and econ- 
omize his time, thai as possible 
during school hours i rooms of his school. He 
should at imes know what his school is doi to 
determine accurately the efficiency of the instruction given 
in it, know that the pupils are classified as they should be, be. 
able to give demonstration teaching, get real team work out 
of his teachers by coérdinating their work, and be able to ap- 
proach the instructional problems of his school with a de- SS

gree of expertness which is eae only on the objective and 
quantitative testing of results.) 
He o direct and build up the !p- 
entices and new teachers, to assist them in maki ir 
programs more scientifically, and to hold helpful meetings 
with his teachers for the planning and discussion of instruc- 
tion and the interpretation to them of the policy of the 
school system. The larger lines of policy will probably be 
planned by the superintendent, or decided upon in confer- 
ence, but upon the principal rests the responsibility for the 
successful carrying into practice of the ideals of the superin- 
tendent and the upbuilding of his own school. His ability 
to do this will be determined largely by the thoroughness 
and professional character of his knowledge of his own school 
problems and conditions. The highest degree of skill is 
required for the proper carrying out of this division of his 
duties, and, in consequence, the supervisory functions are 
usually much less satisfactorily carried out than are the 
administrative functions. 
Social duties. Under this heading is included a relatively 
new but increasingly important group of duties or functions 
that represent quite an extension of the older conception as 
to the work of a school principal. Under this heading must 
be included the playground and athletic activities of the pu- 
pils, inter-school games and sports, school entertainments, 
thrift work, Scout work, Junior Red Cross work, and similar 
student activities which now demand supervisory oversight. 
In addition, the principal can render a very important 
service by working with the Parent-Teacher Association, 
looking after-the-out-of-school needs Of his teachers-organ- 
Aging special school programs, codperating with the~public

In a very real sense, the principal acts as an interpreter to   
-P-A-G-E-61
  NATURE OF PRINCIPAL’S WORK 45 
the people of the meaning and importance of their own 
schools. He also owes a duty to his profession, both in the 
community and in the state. 
All these new functions are becoming increasingly impor- 
tant in building up a school and community spirit favorable 
to good school work, and an ability and a willingness to back 
the schools and the school policies against hostile attacks. 
The proper encouragement and guidance of such extra- 
school activities and interests require careful planning, and 
the expenditure of much time and energy on the part of the 
school principal, but the results achieved by such work are 
so fruitful that the time spent on them after all gives large 
returns. 
Saving time for work. Most principals who find them- 
selves swamped with routine administrative duties could 
emancipate themselves if they desired to do so. A first step 
would be to make 4 careful analysis of what they actually 
do. One good means is to make an accurate record by min- 
utes of what one does during each school day, for a week or 
two at a time, and analyze this record into percentages of 
a day. Then, with such a table before one, raise the ques- 
tion for each item as to whether the time spent on it was 
time well spent. 
For example, one principal of the writer’s acquaintance 
who found himself “‘swamped by administrative routine,” 
followed this suggestion and found that, for the first week 
for which he kept an accurate record, his ordinary run of 
duties averaged, for each five-hour day his school was in 
session, as shown in the table on page 46. 
Such a time distribution is exceedingly poor and. exceed- 
ingly wasteful. Taking the total cost for salaries, janitor 
service, supplies, and heating and lighting, and dividing by 
the number of school days per year, this principal found that 
his school was costing approximately $195 a day, or $39 an

hour. To the supervision of instruction in the school and 
the improvement of the education of 550 boys and girls he 
was giving but three and three quarter hours a week, or but 
fifteen per cent of his school time. Such a small percentage 
is very likely to be mere “room visitation,” aimlessly car- 
ried out, and without any very definite results. 
Evolving a better working schedule. Certainly an aver- 
age of fifty to sixty per cent of a principal’s time, during 
each school week, once the school is organized and under 
way, ought to be given to carefully planned supervision of 
the instruction in his school. In the above-mentioned case 
to find that amount of time required the.complete reor- 
ganization of the principal’s activities and methods of work. 
This he proceeded to do. The janitor was given the janitor 
work todo. The messages to teachers and errands for them 
were provided for by a system which utilized a mail-box sys- 
tem, combined with monitors at recesses and other non- 
school time. By being in the office much less, the telephone 
naturally required less attention. Storeroom work, record 
and report work, and building supervision and inspection 
were all relegated to before-school and after-school hours. 
The handling of pupil cases and the seeing of parents was
-P-A-G-E-63
    NATURE OF PRINCIPAL'S WORK 47 
systematized and expedited, and the time spent on callers 
materially lessened. 
The principal made the transition by at once taking three 
hours a day for classroom supervision, the other work being 
permitted to pile up, and pile up at first it did. This for a 
time required much after-school time and some home work, 
but the introduction of system soon reduced very materially 
the time required. He finally reduced his daily work to ap- 
proximately the following schedule, saving his best hours 
for the help and inspiration of pupils and teachers, and per- 
forming his office duties at times when they could be done 
most economically.

Note. Program for hours 1.00 to 2.00 and 200 to 3.00 to alternate, 
as needed for supervision. 
Laying out one’s work. Learning system and perfecting 
organization seems particularly difficult for many people. 
One finds in almost every school system principals who are 
slow in thinking and acting, halting in decision, weak and 
ineffective in organizing power, and who in consequence ac- 
complish little. Many of these are otherwise good men, but 
they have followed an uneconomical routine for so long that 
they cannot now learn new ways of working. A young per- 
son entering the principalship, though, ought from the first
-P-A-G-E-64
48 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  to develop a more intelligent organization of the work t 
done. Many little methods and plans and tricks in 1 
can be employed effectively by a quick and intelligent ¢ 
cipal. A few such may be mentioned briefly here. 
Tn the first place, one should organize his desk and his ot- 
fice for expeditious and effective work. Have ink, paper, 
blotters, envelopes, printed forms, order blanks, etc., in well- 
organized and convenient places, so that it is easy to do 
work whenever there is work to be done. Carry a pad or 
card in the pocket on which to note down things to be done 
or to be attended to later. Use printed forms and corre- 
spondence cards freely, and save the writing of letters. 
Learn to condense the letters that must be written to as 
small a space as possible, and only under exceptional cir- 
cumstances write a letter of more than one page. A half- 
page letter is nearly always better. Organize a bulletin- 
board and letter-box service for teachers and janitors, and 
have a time when notices and bulletins are put there and 
when they are expected to look for them. Organize the 
storeroom for expeditious handling, and the charging sys- 
tem for supplies and books in as simple and effective a man- 
ner as possible. Avoid elaborate filing devices which re- 
quire time, and in which things usually get lost. Have but 
few files, and these well systematized. Have the janitor do 
and look after many things that save the time of principal 
and teachers, and train teachers to do their work without 
calling upon the principal to do their errands for them. Do 
not begin that way. 
Systematize, as much as possible, the work on pupil cases, 
and have stated times, well advertised, when parents will be 
sure to find you. If parents know that they can see you best 
at certain hours, they will in time tend to come then only. 
Give the central office your working schedule, and gradually 
train this office to call you only at your office periods. At
-P-A-G-E-65
  NATURE OF PRINCIPAL’S WORK 49 
other times let the telephone ring; if you have no clerk and 
are not in the office, it will not have to be answered. There 
are very few messages that will not keep a few hours. 
Handle callers expeditiously. In handling callers, be po- 
lite, but at the same time handle cases quickly. Get rid of 
persons who come to try to interest you in something. Do 
not waste much time on casual callers, either. If they want 
to see the school, send or take them to the classrooms; if 
they merely want to talk, tell them that you have important 
duties elsewhere. In dealing with parents who call, treat 
them politely, but handle them expeditiously. If they want 
to linger, send them to the rooms where their children are. 
Be resourceful in devising polite ways of moving people 
along. Use pupils as guides or messengers, and save your 
own steps and time. Let the superintendent, when he 
comes for inspection or supervision, go about alone, unless 
he shows a desire to have you accompany him, and then try 
to show him what he came to see in your school. If he 
seems to have no definite objective, show him the high spots 
or the low places in your school, and let him see that you 
know how and in what direction your school is traveling. 
Do not make your callers too comfortable, as too many 
people do not know how to get up and get away when their 
business is over. To sit at one’s desk and have a fixed chair 
for each caller is very wasteful of time if many are to be seen. 
It is usually better to stand, or to use a light chair and move 
it about the room yourself, and to see parents anywhere — 
at the door, in the hallway, or on the playground — rather 
than to take them to the office and seat them properly be- 
fore taking up their errand. To know how to meet people 
graciously, to get their case quickly, to render a rapid and 
satisfactory decision, and then to help them to get away 
without offending them, while you get on to the next case, is 
an art which every executive who has much work to do has 
to learn. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Have a working schedule. A tentative working schedule 
will also help a principal to use his time economically. Such 
a general working plan as is given on page 47 will be found 
helpful. One will need to vary from any working plan, from 
time to time, but week by week the general plan should be 
adhered to. Keep a clock in the office or on the desk, and 
keep an eye on the clock as you work. 
In addition to a daily schedule of work, a principal should 
have a monthly and a yearly schedule, and should look at 
these frequently. They will help to anticipate work ahead, 
and prevent oversights and an undue accumulation. Such 
a schedule could be made up on good-sized cards, one for 
each month, or could be put on sheets of paper in a loose- 
leaf folder and then bound. The leaf from a yearly schedule 
made up by one principal, given on page 5, will illustrate 
the nature and use of such a schedule for work. 
Outlining the major problems of the school. Another 
type of working schedule or plan for work is one which out- 
lines the major problems which the school will attempt to 
meet during the year. The outlining of these problems will 
not be as easy for a new principal as for one who has been in 
the school before, and hence knows needs and conditions. 
Still, it will not be difficult after a little study of a situation. 
These major problems should be definite and concrete, and 
perfectly capable of solution by the teachers working to- 
gether. The formulation of such problems furnishes work- 
ing objectives for the year’s activities, and gives an addi- 
tional interest both to classroom instruction and to teachers’ 
meetings. Sometimes these objectives are formulated for 
the whole school system by an energetic and studiously 
inclined superintendent of schools, but more commonly 
they must be outlined by each individual school. In any 
case, each school has its individual problems, and can sup- 
plement any general city-wide program.

should be undertaken in any one year. Each should be defi- 
nitely formulated and stated, each should be based on a 
study of existing conditions and needs, where possible each 
should be set before the teachers in the form of graphs and 
diagnostic charts showing conditions and needs, progress 
made during the year should be similarly reduced to graphic 
form, and every effort should be made to make the study 
and work on the problems contribute to definiteness in class- 
room work and to economy in procedure throughout the 
year. In such formulation of objectives older and more 
mature teachers can render valuable service, and the selec- 
tion of objectives for each year may well be done by the 
teachers in meeting. The principal, though, must still be 
the guiding spirit, suggesting and directing the study, codr- 
dinating and integrating the results, stimulating new in- 
quiries, and carrying on far more extensive observation and 
reading on the problems than he can expect any of his teach- 
ers todo. By his larger grasp of the problems he must show 
his qualities for professional leadership. 
A few such major objectives, each suitable for the work 
of a year or more, may be stated to illustrate what is 
meant: 
1. A study of age and grade distribution, promotions, and the 
course of instruction, with a view to discovering causes of and 
means for reducing retardation in the school. 
2. A study of retardation among the brighter pupils, the effect of 
this on their work and progress, and means for speeding up 
their instruction. 
8. Improvement of the manners of pupils, better care of build- 
ing and grounds, decrease in quarrels and personal injuries, 
and the development of a big-brother attitude, objectively 
measured in the rise of a better school and community spirit. 
4. A study of reading throughout the grades, with a view to its 
analysis and improvement. Both silent and oral reading con- 
sidered.

  NATURE OF PRINCIPAL'S WORK 53 
5. An analysis of handwriting difficulties, progress, and stand- 
ards, with objective measures of results. 
6. A similar study for spelling, or composition. 
7. Objectives in geography, history, or arithmetic, and means 
for motivating the instruction in®these subjects. 
8. A study of minimum essentials in any elementary-school sub- 
ject, or group of subjects. 
9. A program for Americanization work throughout the school, 
and among the parents as the school may reach them. 
10. Better health and nutrition, and support of a Health Center. 
11. The teaching process, and the improvement of: teaching 
technique. 
12. Project work in the grades. 
It is by some such laying-out of one’s work, by the formu- 
lation of programs for economical and effective work, and 
by the concentration of attention on important fundamen- 
tal objectives in work that a principal can best emancipate 
himself from the routine of office and administrative duties 
and find time for his really important function of a super- 
visor of instruction and a helpful leader of his teachers in the 
school. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Show how a principal’s daily contact with parents may 
a. Add strength to his position and control of his school; 
b. Prove his ultimate undoing. 
2. Give concrete illustrations to show the different attitudes a principal 
must at times assume, as stated om page 41. 
8. Illustrate. the importance to a principal of (a) a good time sense; 
() a good sense of proportion; (c) easy and refined manners; (d) a good 
sense of humor; (e) quick and accurate decision; (f) human sympathy. 
4, Show that a definite program for work will help a principal to trans- 
form his work from routine into constructive service. 
5. Make up a working program for the month of December. 
6. Make up a working program, based on the principal teaching half of 
each day. 
7. Some principals have teachers’ mail boxes outside their office door, and 
expect teachers to look in these twice a day for any notices. What do 
you think of such a plan? Why twice? Why outside? 
8. List five other worthy objectives for an elementary school.

THE ORGANIZATION OF A SCHOOL
-P-A-G-E-74

-P-A-G-E-75
  CHAPTER IV 
PRELIMINARY CONFERENCES AND ORGANIZATION 
The problem in the large. Every principal of a school, 
whether new to the school or not, faces certain preliminary 
conferences and duties at the beginning of each school year. 
These naturally vary with situations and circumstances, 
and also differ according as the principal is merely assuming 
charge of a school he has directed for years, is taking charge 
of a school to which-he is new but in a city in which he has 
worked and with which he is familiar, is starting a small 
new school, or is a stranger to the city and is taking charge 
of a school some one else has previously managed. In all 
these situations, though, certain common duties will ap- 
pear, and these may be indicated most easily by describing 
the problems facing the principal coming to a city new to 
him to assume charge of an established school. 
This type of situation calls for the exercise of good sense 
that a proper first impression may be made, and then later 
the ability to live up to this first impression. To a certain 
body of teachers, and to hundreds of parents and children, 
he comes as a new and untried personage, one who may 
deeply influence their work and lives in the right direction, 
or one who may antagonize teachers, parents, and children 
by his lack of tact, arbitrary manner, and lack of under- 
standing of them and their ways and their problems. If 
the principal before him has been a strong, capable, and 
much-beloved executive, it is much in the newcomer’s favor 
if at the start he seems to measure up to his predecessor, and 
later can continue to hold such feeling. If he, too, is strong 
he will keep all that is good which has been established, and  
-P-A-G-E-76
  fe > 60 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
add to it as he can. He will also find that such a principal 
has established many traditions in the school — some good, 
and some bad — and these he will need to recognize and deal 
with carefully. 
If, on the other hand, the principal before him was 
weak, or incompetent, or lazy, or coarse, his work will in 
a way be easier. If he shows ability to do, and seems 
to understand what leadership and good work are, his work 
will win favor quickly by contrast with that of the man 
who preceded him. In other respects his work will be 
harder, because he will find that his predecessor has left 
  him a legacy of lax methods, weak discipline, poor organiza- 
tion, little or no classr isi d often few or no 
records, and these will require time and patience and hard 
work to overcome and correct. He will experience a pleas- 
ure in accomplishment, though, which will more than com- 
pensate for the difficulties he has to meet. 
In any situation which may confront him, however, the + 
ease with which he grasps the essentials, and the quickness, © 
force, and correctness of his responses, will largely determine 
his success as principal and that of the school under his 
charge. 
Learning the larger outlines of his problem. Assuming, 
then, the case of a principal new to a school system ‘and a 
city, along what preliminary lines would he best proceed? 
In the first place, during the preceding summer vacation 
period he ought to have familiarized himself, as much as can 
be done from printed material, with the educational condi- 
tions in the city and the State in which he is to work. This 
may best be done by studying carefully the Annual Report of 
the Superintendent of Schools for the city, and working over 
its statistical tables; the printed Course of Study for thecity, 
including the textbooks used; and the Rules and Regula- 
tions of the Board of Education for the city. If a school
-P-A-G-E-77
  PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION 61 
survey of the city has ever been made and printed, he should 
study this with the greatest care. 
If new to the State, the Report of the Superintendent of 
Public Instruction for the State should be looked over for its 
general view and statistics, and the L 
and Regulations of the State Board of Education, in so far as 
these“apply to principals, teachers, and pupils, should be 
made familiar. It is good to learn more than probably will 
be needed, and to know fairly well not only the duties and 
powers and prerogatives of one’s own position, but of the 
higher authorities as well. In every business the clerk who 
is studying the work of his superior officers as well as his 
own will be, given equal ability, the one most likely to be 
singled out for promotion. 
Some study of the city, too, if unfamiliar, will also be 
helpful — its size; character of its population; comparative wealth; comparative expenditure for its schools; its rail- 
» roads, commerce, and industries; and its peculiar social and 
educational problems. All such information is likely to prove 
useful many times in the early days of one’s work. When 
the time approaches for the opening of the schools, the 
principal should go to the city several days in advance — a 
week to ten days is not too long — in part to locate comfort- 
ably, and in part to have a day or two to look over the city 
quietly by himself, so as to get a better preliminary grasp of 
its peculiar characteristics and problems. A new principal 
ought also to take the boundaries of his district and walk up 
and down the streets to see what his district is like, and he 
should also walk from his boundaries to the nearest school 
in each direction, to get distances, and note any differences 
in the character of the population. 
Seeing the superintendent of schools. The first official 
call should be upon the city superintendent of schools. 
This should be arranged for in advance, by letter or tele-
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
phone, and the principal should be at the office at exactly 
the hour set. If it is a large office, where he may have to 
send in his card and pass a number of clerks, a few minutes 
should be allowed for this. In a large city he probably will 
not see the superintendent, at least at first, but may be 
asked to see instead an assistant or deputy superintendent. 
In a small city he may find it necessary to see the county 
superintendent of schools as well, to arrange as to his teach- 
ing certificate and other matters. In a small community, 
where he is to be a supervising principal and there is no city 
superintendent of schools, his first call should be upon the 
county superintendent of schools instead, and this should be 
similarly arranged for by letter or telephone. This prelim- 
inary call and conference is partly to report for duty, partly 
to see and be seen, and partly — largely — to obtain such 
preliminary information and instructions as the superintend- 
ent of schools sees fit to give individually. All general in 
structions he may be assumed to communicate to the teach- 
ers in a body at the preliminary teachers’ meeting on the 
coming Saturday, or by printed forms, and his time need 
not be taken for these at this first interview. 
The purpose of this visit should be thought out in ad- 
vance, and the information to be sought and the main ques- 
tions to be asked should be got in mind. On the back of an 
envelope or the edge of a newspaper, to be held in one’s hand 
and casually glanced at, the main topics to be brought up 
may be jotted down. This will give a purpose to the meet- 
ing and materially expedite the interview. The peculiar 
problems of the particular school one is to manage, the poli- — 
cies for it the superintendent has in mind, and any informa- 
tion the superintendent cares to impart as to the work of 
the preceding principal and the teaching and janitor staff of 
the school, might well constitute important items on one’s 
list. The main educational objectives the superintendent
-P-A-G-E-79
  PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION 63 
has in mind for the year, and the type of general teachers’ 
meeting he will hold before the opening day may well be 
other important points. One may also ask for any needed 
information as to one’s certificate, and request, at the close, 
to be referred to the clerk or other person or persons who 
can give detailed information. as to reports, blank forms, 
supplies, orders, teachers, and other administrative details 
that the superintendent may be assumed to delegate to 
others. One ought also to make the acquaintance of all the 
office force one is likely to have dealings with later on. 
Essential purposes of the visit. The principal should 
keep clearly in mind that he has called on the superintend- 
ent of schools on one of his busy days, and that he should 
stay only as long as the superintendent seems to desire to 
have him stay, and not long in any case. He has also called 
to be seen, and to secure information and advice, and it is 
‘the superintendent and not he who should do most of the 
talking. Should the superintendent turn the interview 
about and begin to ask questions, he should answer frankly 
and to the point, but rather briefly. The principal should 
assume that the superintendent does not want to be forced 
to listen to any disquisition on the principal’s educational 
views, past service to the cause, or ability to do fine things. 
When he has finished what he came for, let him show that 
he knows how to terminate an interview and get away. The 
officials over him are much more likely to think well of him 
if he states his business promptly, asks questions to the 
point, gets quickly what he came for, and leaves before they 
~ really want him to go, than if he stays so long that the line 
piles up behind him and he finally has to be helped out of 
the office. There will come occasional times, either when 
some unexpected emergency has arisen, or when business is 
very slack, when the superintendent may desire to talk and 
one is warranted in remaining for something of a visit, but
-P-A-G-E-80
    64 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
these times do not come often, and it is for the superintend- 
ent rather than the principal to indicate when one of the 
occasions has come. On the other hand an excess of timid- 
ity is not desirable, as it is nearly always regarded as an evi- 
» dence of immaturity and does not inspire confidence. 
From the subordinates and clerks in the office the princi- 
pal may assume he has a right to expect all necessary in- 
formation. The blank forms he and his teachers must use, 
the times and forms of reports to be made, the ordering of 
supplies and repairs, the handling of a petty expense ac- 
count if such be allowed, the keys to his building, what he 
may expect and require of his janitor — all these and other 
similar items he may inquire about. Even though he be 
told that supplies of all blank forms will be found in his build- 
ing, he may ask for a sample of the important ones and on 
these make notes as to when expected, and other informa- 
tion given. He may well ask to see the store and supply 
room, to learn what the school system keeps and provides. 
He should also obtain a full list of all teachers, janitors, | 
clerks, and other persons who are assigned to his building, 
together with the following information concerning each of 
his teachers, and part of it also for the janitors and clerks. 
1. Name in full. 
2. Grade assigned to. Salary. 
8. New teacher. 
a. To city system. 
b. To particular building. 
4, Education. 
5. Teaching experience, summarized by years and types. 
6. General characteristics of. 
Such information, excepting 6, is always on file at the cen- 
tral office, and the principal may ask to be permitted to 
copy it for his own information and guidance, using a sepa- 
rate card for each teacher and other employee he will have 
under him.
-P-A-G-E-81
  PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION 65 
With such information he is now ready to take up his 
work at his building, though he may have been to and taken 
a hasty look over his building and grounds before visiting 
the central office. 
Building reconnaissance. The next step probably would 
be to make a careful reconnaissance lant he is 
accra: HEAT wo Ob ih baliapunl oe 
thoroughly, and make notes for his information and guid- 
ance during the early days of his work. This should start 
at the office. Here he should go through his desk, find what 
it and his office contain, and organize his desk and cases and 
shelves and files and working materials, so that he will know 
what he has and needs, and where things are and should be. 
The same should be done for the stores, supplies, and books, 
with the amounts on hand and to be sent checked and re- 
corded. 
Probably best accompanied by the janitor, he should next 
examine each class- or special room, noting the teacher’s 
supplies and storage, contents of desk, number and kind of 
seats in room (sizes, fixed, adjustable), size, lighting, and 
general condition. The hallways, staircases, the number and 
condition of the toilets for each sex, the heating and venti- 
lating plant, drinking facilities, the lighting system, the facil- 
ities for cleaning and repairs, the fire-control provisions, and 
the signal system are points of importance in the inspection. 
The nature, size, and use made of yard and streets, and play 
apparatus on the yard and in store should also be noted. If 
the school has an assembly hall, its size and possible useful- 
ness should be noted. 
The next point might well be a careful examination of the 
building records, to see what they tell. The number of pu- 
pils for each classroom and for the school should be esti- 
mated from the registers of promotion and school-growth 
records. The health records, the attendance and tardiness
-P-A-G-E-82
  66 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
records, the truancy and disciplinary records, the petty- 
expense records, and the permanent pupil-records should 
be examined. For some, and often for many of these items, 
there will be no records to examine. This, however, is good 
to know. The age-and-grade-distribution records, the fail- 
ure and promotion records, the records as to nativity and 
occupation of parents, the transfer and withdrawal records, 
the faculty-meeting records, the parent-teacher-meeting 
records, the medical-inspection records, and any standard- 
test examination records that may be available should be 
gone over. The teachers’ classroom Registers should be 
looked over to see what they contain, and how they have 
been kept. All that a principal can learn about his school 
and its work before he sees his teachers and begins work 
with them will be of value. He will not need all this infor- 
mation, but the man who succeeds best and most easily is 
the man who knows more than he is expected to know. All 
this knowledge will help him to shape his plans for meeting 
any unexpected conditions and emergencies during the open- 
ing day and week. 
Preliminary teachers’ meetings. The number and types 
of preliminary teachers’ meetings the principal himself will 
want to hold, before the opening day of his school, will de- 
pend much upon the number and type of meetings the city 
superintendent holds. In some of our cities the opening of 
school in the autumn is preceded by a two- to three-day gen- 
eral institute, and in some cities even five days are given to 
this work. In such a case much of what the principal would 
otherwise present is given to all teachers at the general in- 
stitute. The more common plan, however, is for the super- 
intendent to hold a single meeting of all teachers on the Sat- 
urday morning preceding the opening Monday, at which 
only quite general instructions are given. In the latter case 
more preliminary work will fall to the principal of each 
building.
-P-A-G-E-83
  PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION 67 
Something will also be determined by the number of 
teachers new to the system who are to begin work in the 
principal’s building the coming year. If there are no new 
teachers the meeting problem is somewhat simplified, and 
one meeting, on Saturday, probably will suffice. If, as usu- 
ally happens, from two or three to six or eight or ten new 
teachers are to begin work in the building the coming year, 
the principal should first hold a preliminary teachers’ meet- 
ing with these new teachers alone, on the preceding Friday 
morning. At the time new teachers are elected they should 
be notified to be on hand for such a meeting, at the building, 
at a fixed hour. In some cities this preliminary conference 
with new teachers takes place on Thursday morning, Friday 
is devoted to meetings of new teachers from all buildings by 
grades, and on Saturday comes the general meetings of all 
teachers, new and old. 
The new-teachers’ building conference. The prelimi- 
nary conference of the principals with the teachers new to 
their buildings, let us assume, is set for Friday morning at 
9.30 o’clock. At this time each principal will meet only the 
teachers new to his building. The purpose of this is largely 
to initiate them into the ways of doing things in the city, 
and in his particular building. If the principal, too, is new, 
the importance of his previous study of all the conditions 
and regulations surrounding his work will be apparent. Af- 
ter the principal has been in the building, or even in the . 
school system, a short time, he can conduct such a confer- 
ence with greater ease and effectiveness. 
he program of such a preliminary conference with the 
new teachers should be, in a general way, to get acquainted 
with them, to show them their rooms, to initiate them into 
the procedure to be followed, to help them plan their pro- 
grams and work for the first few days, and to indicate to 
them something of the spirit of the school and the keynote 
of the principal’s educational creed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  68 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
More specifically, the principal should explain to them 
the regulations for and the plan of management to be fol- 
lowed in the conduct of the particular building in which 
they are to work, indicate strong and weak points for their 
guidance, explain the plan fo lowed for filing in and out, re- 
cesses, passing to toilets, usage in conducting fire drills, the 
signal system, the use of monitors, play periods, use of the 
assembly hall, degree of self-government practiced, yard 
games, yard and basement supervision, special details for 
duty, the lunch room, the health work carried on, the sick 
room and the first-aid cabinet, supplies available and how dis- 
tributed, the building keys and regulations, the permanent- 
record cards, blank forms to be used, reports to be made and 
how and when to make them, how to use the janitor and 
his duties, handling of tardiness and truancy, obstreperous 
cases, sending pupils to the office, keeping pupils in, punish- 
ments, teachers’ hours and general duties, unexpected ab- 
sence and how to report it, the grading and promotion sys- 
tem, special promotions, use of the ungraded or disciplinary 
rooms, the textbooks in use, desk and supplemental books 
- and how and where to get these, use of the public and the 
teachers’ libraries, the course of study, its administration, 
lesson plans, the vacation days and periods, the retirement 
fund, salary payments, the tenure system, building and 
grade teachers’ meetings, the general teachers’ meetings, 
_ and any other special requirements of the state laws or the 
rules and regulations of either the State Board of Education 
or of the City Board of Education, with which the older 
teachers may be assumed to be familiar and which new 
teachers ought to know. 
Plenty of opportunity should be given for the teachers to 
ask questions, so that a clear understanding of all points 
may be attained. It may be that a second afternoon meet-

Should there be a general city meeting, by grades, of all new 
teachers to go over course of study and promotional proce- 
dure, the building conference outlined above can be materi- 
ally shortened. It may also be shortened, and perhaps im- 
proved, by taking up only the matters and items likely to be 
needed for guidance during the first few days of school, re- 
serving for a second conference, to be held some afternoon 
toward the close of the first week, or on the following Satur- 
day morning, all those matters dealing with school proce- 
dure not likely to be needed the first week of school. 
The building conference for all teachers. Assuming that 
the superintendent holds a general teachers’ meeting on 
Saturday morning, the principal should then hold a general 
teachers’ meeting of all teachers of his building, old and new, 
following this general meeting. Just when and where this 
meeting should be held will depend a little on the usage pre- 
viously followed in the city, and somewhat on the condition 
of the weather that day. In some cities it is the practice to 
hold the general teachers’ meeting at 9.00 or 9.30 in the high 
school or other school building auditorium, adjourning this 
by 10.30 to 10.45, and then have all teachers meet with 
their principals for a building conference from 11.00 to 12.00, 
in the different classrooms of this same school. If this is 
the general city practice the principal would better adhere 
to it, though there is a psychological advantage in holding 
the building conference in the building in which the teachers 
are to teach. To require this, though, contrary to general 
practice, only means to incur unnecessary opposition at 
the start which more than nullifies the slight advantage 
to be gained. r 
On the other hand, one frequently finds the general teach- 
ers’ meeting held at some central place at 10.00 or 10.30, 
this lasting an hour and a half or so, and then building con- 
ferences are scheduled for 3.30 or 4.00 o’clock, at each of the
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
school buildings. This is not a heavy program, gives plenty 
of time‘to rest after lunch and escape the heat of mid-after- 
noon, and has decided advantages. Under such a plan a 
tactful and considerate principal can make such a meeting a 
very pleasant as well as a profitable occasion. 
As the meeting is partly an acquaintance and reunion 
meeting, as well as for business, it may well be partly social 
in nature. The principal, either himself or with the aid of 
the older teachers, might do much to start things off well by 
receiving each teacher in person and offering a cup of tea or 
some light refreshment. A bowl of punch, or ice cream and 
cake, may prove very acceptable on a hot afternoon, as 
opening days are apt to be, and will give an opportunity for 
introductions and general conversation which will do much 
to create a spirit of friendliness. The meeting can be for- 
mally called together later, or may gradually develop out of 
the social circle thus formed. The latter plan retains the in- 
formality of the gathering, which is useful at this first meet- 
ing. A woman principal can handle such an affair with ease 
and grace; it is much harder for a man to do so. 
If the principal has carefully thought out what he wants 
to accomplish at this meeting, and knows about what he is 
to do and say, much can be accomplished in a short time. 
A principal new to the city will need to feel his way and ask 
for information, and, unless he is quite sure he can improve 
on plans previously followed in the school, he would best ac- 
cept these and carry the school along on the opening days as 
has previously been done. If the plans are not good they 
can be changed later, when there is more time to train teach- 
ers to a new procedure and when change will savor less of 
a mere exhibition of authority. If, on the contrary, the 
principal is old to the school he will know very definitely 
what to do and say, and if most of his teachers are familiar 
with the school procedure he can proceed quite rapidly.
-P-A-G-E-87

Any new plans, though, will need careful explanation to 
all. 
General nature of this conference. This preliminary 
building teachers’ meeting may begin with a brief statement 
by the principal of his purpose in getting the teachers to- 
gether, and may well proceed along four lines, and perhaps 
best in the following order: 
’ 1, A brief résumé of such general regulations as need mention. 
ing for a clear understanding of duties, and such regulations as 
have been changed since last year and now need restating. 
2. The work and management of the first day or days of school. 
8. Certain classroom organization details that may be useful. 
4, Some general statement as to aims for the year’s work. 
The whole discussion of the above topics can proceed more 
informally at this first meeting than will be the case later, 
and there should be ample opportunities for questions by 
both the teachers and the principal. The latter, however, 
needs to have in mind, and probably still better on a card, a 
definite outline of points to be brought up for consideration, 
that important matters may not be overlooked. He may 
find it desirable, and certainly economical of time, to give 
to each teacher, in mimeographed form, certain general in- 
formation which all need to have. This may include such 
items as: 
1. Skeleton outline for a daily program, with times for beginning, 
recesses, assemblies, and dismissals indicated. 
. A time-limit sheet for subjects and grades. 
. Rules as to books and supplies. 
. The signal system used in the school, and dismissal plans. 
. Time different reports are due and expected. 
. A statement of the standards for promotion and method of 
grading, if such have been formulated for the school system as 
a whole. D> orm 09 2 
All the above in printed form avoids misunderstandings and 
saves time.

  72 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Having gone over the details of school management pre- 
viously with the new teachers, there will be little need for 
repeating many of such details now. Any new regulations, 
or important changes in the old regulations, not explained 
at the general morning meeting, will of course need atten- 
tion. Any reports to be required during the first day and 
week will be stated, with times when the principal will ex- 
pect them for use. An old principal should briefly explain 
the method to be followed in handling pupils, and a new 
principal will wisely find out from the teachers the general - 
scheme which has been followed for assembling and dis- 
missing pupils, regulating yard and basements, handling sup- 
plies, dealing with new pupils, etc., as well as any criticisms 
and suggestions for improvement. These may be consid- 
ered later. He can learn how much responsibility has been 
placed on teachers in the past, and can give them new re- 
sponsibilities under the guise of getting them to assist him. 
In a general way all teachers may be asked to take up the 
work they have previously handled. If any new or general 
type of program is to be instituted this will need careful ex- 
planation. The work of the special supervisors may need 
mention and explanation also. 
Time should not be spent in passing out supplies needed; 
instead the janitor should have placed all these in the rooms, 
ready for the teachers to put away for use. The teachers 
should be expected to see that their rooms are properly sup- 
plied with books, equipment, and supplies for the first day’s 
work, so that no time need be taken the first day with these 
details. The first day will be needed for the children only. 
Planning for the opening day. An understanding will 
need to be arrived at and clearly understood as to plans for 
handling the pupils and parents on the opening day. Each 
teacher should be provided with a list of the pupils pro- 
moted to her room and who presumably will constitute her
-P-A-G-E-89
  PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION - 73 
class for the coming term. Such lists will help teachers in 
identifying and checking up lost children, and it has a good 
effect on the children to be called by name as individuals. 
Explain the card forms to be used and data to be obtained 
from the children. Yard and other extra duties will be in- 
dicated for the first few days, at least. 
A good general plan is to have all regular pupils on as- 
sembling proceed to the room of the grade to which they 
were promoted at the close of the preceding year, where their 
credentials will be examined by the teachers, as they 
come, and, if not properly placed, they wili-be directed by 
the teachers to the proper rooms. Have pupi's coming with 
transfers from other schools in the city looked after by 
Miss A, transfers from other cities by Miss B, special cases 
— left-overs, irregulars — temporarily classified by Miss C. 
The older and wiser teachers should be requested to assume 
these positions, and how and where they should carry on 
their work as the children arrive be indicated. Have the 
kindergarten and the primary teachers look after the little 
folks and their mothers, and get them sorted out and started 
contentedly. The principal will reserve for his personal at- 
tention the more difficult cases referred to him for classifica- 
tion by the teachers. Should the school be in a foreign 
quarter better provision for pupil and teacher assistance will 
need to be made, and more teachers used in handling the 
crowds of mothers and children, collecting residence and 
other needed data, supplying books to indigents, etc. Every- 
thing comes with a mad rush in a big school in a foreign 
quarter of a city, and the principal must keep himself free 
from detail work to look after the emergencies that arise. 
Suggestions for first-day procedure. After a general 
first-day plan has been determined upon, the principal may 
well offer a few suggestions as to first-day procedure, of 
which the following may be taken as a type:
-P-A-G-E-90
10.     Be on hand early. See that you have what you need for your 
room, and that it is in good order. Order and method lead to 
effective work. A touch of beauty — flowers if available — 
add much to a favorable first-day atmosphere. 
. Have a definite plan in mind for seating and sorting the pu- 
pils, passing materials, distributing books, and getting the 
school under way in the shortest possible time. Use seating 
charts to locate pupils and fix names quickly. 
. Have and follow a very definite program the first few days. 
‘You may be more flexible later, but at first be definite and de- 
cisive, for its effect on the children. 
. Remember that pupils are “sizing up” the teacher, and that 
you have arroblem of class psychology to deal with. Take 
for granted that the children are with you, keep your eye on 
them as individuals, but treat the problem as a class problem 
— at first. 
. Have plenty of work ready, and try to open up some class or 
group problems the first day that will carry over to succeeding 
days. Motivate your work from the first. 
. Insist on good working habits from the first. Have things 
done properly. Keep everyone busy. Do not worry if you 
do not teach much the first week; the establishment of the 
right atmosphere in the school and the right type of responses 
on the part of the children are more important at the start 
than subject matter. 
. Keep yourself in the background as director and master, but 
be in control from the first. Avoid talking too much, but get 
the pupils so busily at work that they will want to do the talk- 
ing. 
. Keep yourself cheerful and natural and human, and do not 
fail to see the funny side of things with the children. Do not 
expect too high a degree of perfection, either in conduct or 
work. 
. Remember that the children have just come in from a long 
vacation, and that both they and you are working at a prob- 
lem of adjustment. : 
Watch your own habits of work, and determine whether they 
are such as you would wish your children to imitate. © 
Tell the teachers that you will call a brief teachers’ meeting 
after school the first afternoon, and ask them to note down, 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION 15 
during the day, the special problems they meet. Also tell 
them the main purpose of this first after-school meeting. 
Larger aims and purposes. When these matters have 
been disposed of, and a business-like program for the first 
day’s work has been arrived at, the principal may take a 
few minutes to state what he conceives to be his function as 
principal, emphasizing his desire to minimize administra- 
tive routine, stress his supervisory functions, uphold his 
teachers in every way he can honestly, and help them in all 
ways where his experience and advice might be of value. 
In particular he wishes to be of help to them in planning 
their work, interpreting the course of instruction, improving 
instructional procedure, and in professional advancement. 
While assured of full codperation and support, he neverthe- 
less expects them, in large measure, to handle their own 
class and individual problems, not because he is unwilling to 
help but because they will be worth more to the children if 
they are able to do so. 
The principal may well conclude the conference by a 
short talk as to the larger aims and purposes for the year. 
Like a skillful general, he may review the past accomplish- 
ments of the school, if new to the work then as he has come 
to understand them, and will open up to his co-workers 
some broad outlook on the work still remaining to be done. 
If an objective or two for the year’s work has been decided 
upon previously by the teachers, this may be touched upon 
and its larger possibilities pointed out, and if none has been 
selected he may suggest certain ones and say that he will 
bring this matter up again a little later for consideration. 
The meeting can thus fitly close with a brief discussion of 
aims and ideals and means of attainment, and the principal 
can fire his teachers with some of his own enthusiasm for the’ 
work that lies ahead. 
In this first real contact the principal must remember 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
     76 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
that his measure is being taken by the teachers, and the 
importance of a good first impression should not be over- 
looked. Tact, courtesy, kindliness, appearance, and man- 
ner all count, but after all the most important thing is his 
fullness of grasp of the problems and work, and his ability 
as an educational and inspirational leader. Nothing can be 
subordinate to this fundamental requirement. 
‘Value of these conferences. Some such scheme of pre- 
liminary conferences, if well conducted and profitably car- 
ried out, practically always wins the approval of the teach- 
ers. Newcomers find such preliminary conferences as to 
detailed procedure very helpful. What teachers object to is 
attending meetings to listen to what they already know, 
to oral instructions that would better be given in mimeo- 
graphed form and that do not concern their immediate work, 
to dictatorial statements and directions, to long explana- 
tions of “my policies,” and possibly to criticisms and scold- 
ings. From all such conferences they get little that is help- 
ful and inspiring. Teachers are by nature a body of enthu- 
siastic idealists, and they will respond quickly to one who 
knows how to fire them with new conceptions as to proce- 
dure or purpose in what they do. 
These meetings can be made as important as any other 
part of the work of the term, and they do much to start the 
school under proper “control,” but the amount teachers get 
out of them is directly proportional to the work put on prep- 
aration for them by the principal and the skill and profes- 
sional enthusiasm he evidences while conducting them. He 
must be careful not to stress too much what he wants done, 
but rather should endeavor tactfully to gain the confidence 
of his teachers by his sympathetic attitude toward their 
problems, and especially by being a good listener if the 
teachers will talk. The principal who can, in such a confer- 
ence, so manage things that the teachers become the chief

  PRILIMINARY ORGANIZATION Ty 
conferees has taken a long step toward efficient organiza- 
tion of his staff. 
One caution is of importance — have an eye on the clock, 
keep things moving along, and do not delay the teachers so 
long that they will be late in getting home for their dinners. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Show that it is easier for a good principal to follow a good principal 
than a poor one. 
2. Show the importance of a preliminary study of his district which a 
principal ought to make. 
8. Illustrate, in the case of a school principal, the common business-world 
statement that “only the man who is larger than and overruns the 
outlines of his calling is safe.” 
4, Indicate something you would add, not listed in the text, to the pre- 
liminary conference with new teachers on Friday. 
5. Do the same for the general building conference on Saturday. 
6. What is your judgment as to where and when to hold the Saturday 
building meeting? Why? 
7. Should the teachers be given the room registers and lists of pupils at 
the building meeting on Saturday, or should they find them on their 
room desks? Why?
-P-A-G-E-94
  CHAPTER V 
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 
The call for executive ability. The first day of school is a 
critical day, and probably no day in the whole year will test 
so severely the principal’s qualities of leadership. Espe- 
cially will this be true for a principal new to the school. It 
is now that his work in studying the building and records, 
organizing his office and supply room, planning his work, 
holding conferences, and distributing duties, in all of which 
he has tried to anticipate difficulties and pave the way for 
smooth and expeditious activity on the first day, will yield 
abundant fruit. The more thoroughly he has planned, the 
more little details he has looked after, and the more difficul- 
ties he has anticipated, the better will he go through the 
critical first day. It is at best a trying time for every one 
— principal, teachers, children, and parents. The weather 
is likely to be hot, everything has to be done rapidly, there 
will be little time for conversation, and nerves may easily 
get on edge. With a new principal in charge and a number 
of new teachers in the building, it is with them, as with the 
children in the rooms, “‘a psychological problem in the ad- 
justment of personalities.” 
If the last principal was a popular one, then the test on 
the part of both teachers arid pupils is likely to be more se- 
vere. To handle the situation the principal must have an- 
ticipated the main difficulties likely to occur. The larger 
the school the more must he keep himself free from detail 
work so as to have time to move about and be on hand where 
needed. The teachers will work into the new régime more 
easily if they are given quite a share in the handling of de- 
tails. The principal must be courteous, decisive, and yet
-P-A-G-E-95
  a aa aM AD 
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 79 
ready to accept any good suggestion that may be offered. 
He probably will be told, frequently, that “Principal So- 
and-So did this way,’’ and he will be foolish to resent or to 
turn such a suggestion aside without giving the plan serious 
consideration. It may be best to say, with a smile, “Very 
well, let us continue that way, at least for the present.” 
Beside the mutual adjustment problem, the day is very 
likely to test the principal’s qualities for leadership. He 
may be accepted by teachers and pupils as a nice man or a 
good fellow, but if this is all he will not get very far. He 
must in addition establish clearly his ability for leadership, 
not by driving or by arbitrary commands, but by real worth. 
To get the work done with the greatest dispatch and the 
least friction must be his aim. In all the work and decisions 
of the day, his must be the outstanding personality in the 
school if he is to hold the admiration and respect of teachers 
and pupils. Courtesy, an unruffled exterior, quick and 
correct decision, a quiet manner betokening plenty of re- 
serve force, complete confidence in himself without evidence 
of egotism, and a sane and tempered enthusiasm for the 
work will do more to give evidence that the principal is as 
large or larger than the job than almost any other qualities 
he can display on this opening day. 
The building in readiness. The conferences with new 
teachers, the preceding week, will have done much to initi- 
ate them into the work and ways of the school, and the pre- 
paratory work in planning and assigning will have helped 
materially to care for any rush the first morning. The prin- 
cipal should see to it that the janitor has distributed chalk, 
erasers, paper, scratch pads, pens, pencils, ink, blank forms 
needed, maps, and other standard supplies to the rooms the 
preceding Saturday, so that there will be no waste of time in 
securing these on the opening day. Lists of pupils to be ad- 
vanced, classification blanks, the cumulative record cards for
-P-A-G-E-96
    80 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
each pupil expected, and the reports and amount of work 
covered the preceding term should also be placed in each 
room. The teachers should select the needed desk books 
and supplemental books for first-day use from the store- 
room the preceding Saturday, and have them charged and 
delivered also by Monday morning. The old teachers will 
know how to do this, but the principal may need to initiate 
the new teachers into this procedure. If free textbooks are 
provided, supplies of these will need be ready to be charged 
and given out. If they are not provided, then printed book 
lists, to be checked and sent home with each pupil, will be 
needed, as well as application blanks for free books on the 
part of those claiming inability to purchase. In schools not 
providing free books, a good stock of supplemental reading 
material, and good plans by teachers for written and other 
work, will need to be looked after. The chances of first-day 
difficulties will be lessened if all such matters are ao 
attended to in advance. 
To sort and handle pupils and parents, large printed signs, 
put up at the outer door and in the main hallways, and giv- 
ing directions as to where to go and whom to see, will prove 
very useful. A movable blackboard may be used for the 
purpose, but it is less satisfactory than the printed cards. 
These can be read by all children above the second grade at 
least. A number of boys and girls, selected by the teachers 
or principal from the highest class, can be used to good ad- 
vantage as ushers. If a form of pupil government is.in use, 
this can be planned for at the close of the preceding school 
year, and the pupils be in readiness to assume the service. 
The boys can direct pupils and parents, assist in errands, an- 
swer the telephone, give bell signals as directed, carry and 
place chairs, and perform similar simple duties. The girls 
will be especially useful in ushering parents and in taking 
the little children to the kindergarten and first-grade rooms.
-P-A-G-E-97
a 
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL | 81 
A few leaders of both sexes can take charge of the yard, run 
up the flag, start games, and probably prevent trouble. 
The principal should have had the janitor place from 
thirty to forty chairs about the lower hallway, and.a few in 
each of the rooms, for parents to occupy. Parents are of 
course much interested, and often very useful with little 
children in giving names, quieting fears, caring for personal 
needs, etc. Signs on the doors of all rooms should indicate 
what classes of pupils or parents are to go there. The prin- 
cipal probably will do well to have a table or his desk put 
out in the hallway and work there, unless he has a very large 
outer room. A small office is easily crowded, and if there is 
but one door for entrance and exit the congestion is likely to 
slow up procedure and prove irritating. He would also best 
work standing. If he uses his office, he would best have all 
chairs removed from it for the day. On this day particu- 
larly he must not be tied to his desk or the telephone, but 
must be able to move people along rapidly and move him- 
self as needed. The advantage of having his desk out in 
the hallway is obvious. He also needs to keep three or four 
files, on which he can string and classify slips of paper bear- 
ing notes, permits, things to be attended to later, and other 
special items. On a card, carried in his pocket, he should 
make notes for the afternoon teachers’ meeting. 
The principal should also have taken some preliminary es- 
timate of his school neighborhood, and should have some 
idea as to the increase in enrollment likely, in what grades 
it is likely to be, and what he will do with it. If his school 
is likely to be overcrowded, maps of his district, showing 
streets, and on which he can locate his extra pupils by 
grades, will be very useful if he has to shift pupils to other 
schools. If he has any vacant rooms he will need to plan 
how best to use them. 
Beginning the work. In many city schools it is custom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  82 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ary for the principal and teachers to arrive early, to see that 
all is in readiness, and then for the doors to be opened at an 
advertised time, such as 8.30 or 8.45. Where there is likely 
to be much early crowding this may be desirable. Where 
this is not the case the doors would best be opened as soon 
as the teachers arrive, and the pupils be allowed to enter and 
be sorted and placed as they come. The great task for the 
first hour will be classification. With teachers in their 
rooms or at stations in readiness, particular teachers desig- 
nated to handle special cases, any unclassified or substitute 
teachers available on hand for special service, the teacher of 
say the two highest grades in the school assuming important 
duties in classification, the principal keeping himself as free 
as possible from small details, the signs up giving directions, 
and pupil ushers busy in guiding and directing, the work can 
proceed quite rapidly and without much confusion. 
When parents or children are familiar with the building 
they can find their way easily. The student ushers can di- 
rect any who are not quite sure. The signs on the doors will 
further help. Strangers are referred to the proper teacher, 
who classifies quickly, and the assisting young people show 
the pupils to the proper rooms. Some pupils will come with- 
out credentials and give evidence of an uncertain type of 
preparation. These will have to be classified experimen- 
tally, and find their proper place later on. Plenty of cards 
or slips of paper, about three by four inches in size, on which 
to write “Room No. —,” “Classification,” ‘Temporary 
Placement,” ‘“‘ Week’s Trial,” etc., will prove useful. The 
teachers receiving transfers similarly classify and sort. The 
left-overs, irregulars, and conditioned pupils, handled by 
Miss C, may be temporarily sorted, held in their old rooms 
for a few days, or sent to the ungraded room for work until 
they can be dealt with by the principal. Slips for all these 
cases should be sent with the pupil to the teacher, and saved
-P-A-G-E-99
aw 
  THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 83 
by her for consultation with the principal. It may take 
some days, or even weeks, to adjust these special cases 
properly. 
The kindergarten and first-grade teachers, probably as- 
sisted here by any substitute or special teachers available 
for service, will sort out the little ones. The kindergarten 
room is large and specially well suited for caring for a crowd, 
and is the proper place for all beginners. Those too young 
for school will be sent home, and the others temporarily 
classified. If the number of little ones exceeds provisions 
made, the substitute teacher can be given a class tempora- 
rily in one of the vacant rooms, if there be such, and if not 
she can help the first- or second-grade teacher. 
The purpose is to get a quick classification, and only as 
good a one as can be made in approximately half an hour to 
an hour. Of necessity there will have to be many cases of 
re-classification during the week, and some temporarily ad- 
mitted may be found mentally too young and may have to 
be sent home if no development class is available. With 
this in mind, in all cases of doubt classify low rather than 
high; it is much easier to move pupils up than down. In all 
temporary-classification cases, hold back book-purchase 
lists until the case is decided. Have the teachers test these 
pupils as rapidly as possible and re-classify when the case is 
obvious, leaving decision to principal only when the proper 
position of the pupil is in doubt. 
Many parents will want to see only the principal, or at 
least to see him first. Hence the advantage of his being out 
in the open, and standing, with no chairs about his desk this 
first morning. He must greet them, find their wants, send 
them on by an usher to the proper teacher or room, and get 
tc the next in line. Most cases he can refer to some teacher, 
or settle on the spot, and it is a great waste of valuable time 
to have these people file into an office, sit down, take their
-P-A-G-E-100
  84 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
turn in line, and have to get up and get out again before he 
can attend to the next case. The more difficult cases he can 
make a note about, make a temporary decision, and put the 
note on one of his files for later consideration, having the par- 
ent or pupil call again in a day or two. Parents who want to 
talk he can move along, if he is tactful, by accepting their 
profession of interest, etc., etc., and inviting them to be pres- 
ent at the first meeting of the Parent-Teacher Association, 
at 3.15, on a week from the following Thursday, when there 
will be time for them to set forth their views more at length. 
Starting the school. At 9.00, let us say, bells will give the 
signal for all children to go to their rooms. No attempt at 
lines or formal passing need be made. Teachers and ushers 
can soon get the children in and placed. The teachers in 
each room can quickly sort over those present, determine 
who should be sent elsewhere and who are to remain, enroll, 
and seat. Pupils not in the right room can be sent where 
they belong. Pupils from outside the school district are han- 
dled as the regulations direct. In many schools it is custom- 
ary for the pupils to go first to the room they occupied the 
preceding year, and then, at a signal, to pass to the new room 
they are to occupy. The plan is more wasteful of time and 
effort, and adds nothing to the effectiveness of organization. 
A good administrative principle, especially for first-day or- 
ganization, is to proceed by the most direct and most eco- 
nomical route, save unnecessary motions, and get instruc- 
tion under way as early as possible. 
A still better plan, in schools where there is not much 
change in clientéle, is for the principal to make all promotions 
just before recess the last morning of the preceding school 
year, send the pupils with their wraps and books to the room 
they will occupy the following year, and then conduct the 
classes the remainder of this last day in the new rooms. 
Everything then is in readiness to begin work promptly the
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 85 
first day in the Autumn, and classes can start to work within 
five minutes after the pupils reach the rooms. This avoids 
all delay, and gives the pupils the impression that the school 
means business from the start. 
As soon as can be done, ordinarily by or before 9.45, the 
teacher should send a pupil to the principal with a slip of 
paper containing the following information: 
Room No. 12 
Teacher Mabel Brourw 
Pupils in 6 18 Grade 2b 
Pupils in b (Grade 28 
Total No. of pupils 4q 
Number of seats nee 
By ten o’clock the principal can have transferred these items 
to a printed single-page Classification Report Sheet, and 
have a first temporary view of his grades and seating space 
to look at and figure from. Re-classifications and addi- 
tions in the afternoon will change his first tally, but it is use- 
ful to have such early preliminary returns. Probably the 
superintendent’s office will telephone for such a report be- 
fore noon, and figures are better than guesses. 
The teachers now proceed at once to organize their 
classes. On the blackboard a temporary program should 
have been placed, which the pupils are told will be followed 
for the present. On the blackboard should also be found, 
and explained by the teacher, the bell-signal system of the 
school. These signals should remain on the board for a few 
days, until the pupils have become thoroughly familiar with 
_them. If there are any absolutely necessary rules that 
~ should be stated to all, this is the time to explain them and 
the reasons for making them. ‘Teachers should be in- 
structed, though, to make at first no rules not needed, and 
none which they do not expect to enforce. Rules should 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  86 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
proceed out of needs. The principal should follow the same 
idea in his work. There are usually few cases of discipline 
on the first day, though the measure of principal and teach- 
ers, especially the new ones, is being taken by the more ag- 
gressive youngsters of the school. 
The next step is to arrange the pupil-monitors by rows, 
pass out the necessary supplies and books, charge any books 
permanently loaned to pupils, and start the work of the 
school. For this every teacher should have a tentative pro- 
gram of work laid out, so that she will know about what she 
is going to do this first day. The new teachers may need 
some special help here, though this difficulty ought in large 
part to have been anticipated at the Friday morning new- 
teachers’ meeting. ‘Teachers who are not only new to the 
school but beginners in teaching as well may need special at- 
tention the first few days, though if they can handle their 
problems it is better to let them do so, even at the cost of 
some mistakes. The effect on the children is better. By 
9.40 to 10.00 instruction ought to be under way, so that one 
group or grade may be set to work studying and the other 
have one recitation before the morning recess time comes. 
A quick and energetic start, with plenty of well-organized 
work the first day, makes a good impression and tends to 
ward off disciplinary trouble. 
Beginning school with an assembly. All that has been 
said so far has been on the assumption that the school does 
not have an assembly hall where all the pupils can meet to- 
gether, as most of the older elementary-school buildings, 
such as those shown in Figures 5, 6, 7, and 8, pages 95-99, 
do not. In such schools as are shown in Figures 9 and 10 
the situation is different, and in these the best procedure 
would be to begin the school with a general assembly of all of 
the pupils. For this the principal shonld have prepared 
with some care. It must be an inspirational and enthusiasm-
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 87 
awakening occasion, and if carried through with some spirit 
it can be made of large usefulness in putting the pupils once 
more into the spirit of the school and in starting things off 
right. An interesting program should have been thought 
out and prepared for in advance, and this should be run 
through with some “‘snap.”” Every one should leave the as- 
sembly with a good feeling for the school, and the principal 
and the teachers should feel that a good start has been made. 
At the 9.00 signal all pupils would then go to the assembly 
hall instead of to their rooms. Placards should announce the 
meeting and point the way. All cases with pupils and par- 
ents should be postponed until afterward, and all be invited 
to go to the assembly hall. If the school has any good mu- 
sic — orchestra, piano and cornet, violin, or a teacher who 
can sing well — start with a selection, and if not try to get a 
well-known song started. A good leader is important if a 
song isto be sung. The principal would best be in charge of 
the assembly, regardless of what procedure may be followed 
at other times. Give variety, as well as interest and spirit 
tothe program. Do not do any one thing very long. Make 
the program constructive; do not lay down the law, or scold, 
or preach a sermon. 
The following program, carried through by a principal, is 
suggestive of what may be done: 
9.00 — Bell signal; pupils file in. Boy Scouts used to direct and 
usher, and bring in stragglers. No special order insisted 
on, and only reasonable quiet expected. 
9.05 — Music by the school orchestra; two short selections. 
9.20 — Welcoming talk by the principal. Kindly, sympathetic, 
constructive, and inspiring for the work of the new year. 
No fault-finding, no regulations, no rules. 
9.28 — President of the School Council (boy). Short talk, call- 
ing for codperation, school loyalty, team work, and ex- 
plaining half a dozen of the important rules of the school. 
9.83 — An eighth-grade Girl-Scout pupil. A few words to the
-P-A-G-E-104
  88 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
girls on what the girls can do for the school, and appeal- 
ing for codperation and a fine school spirit. 
9.88 — Announcements by the principal. Directions as to what 
to do and where to go, and a few final words as to starting 
to work promptly and making this the best year of their 
lives. : 
9.45 — Dismissal, pupils pass out and to rooms, orchestra play- 
ing a march tune. 
9.48 — Bell signal to begin work in the rooms. 
The teachers now begin sorting and enrolling the pupils, as 
previously described, and get the work of instruction under 
way as rapidly as is possible. The principal at once resumes 
work at his desk in the hall, handling parents and pupil cases, 
and the preliminary classification report slips are expected 
from the teachers by or before the morning recess. 
Special conditions. If the school is small, or happens to 
be one of a number of elementary schools constituting a su- 
pervisory group (as in Figure 3, page 12), and in which the 
principal also teaches a class, it probably will be necessary, 
if no substitute or special teacher can be provided to relieve 
him, for him to enroll his class on arrival, give them the nec- 
essary directions for the following day, and then dismiss 
them for the day that he may have time to look after the or- 
ganization of his building as a whole. 
Again, if the upper grades of his school have been reor- 
ganized on the department plan, or as a junior high school, _ 
a special procedure will need to be followed for these grades. 
In such a case some such plan as the following may well be 
carried out: 
1. All old pupils to report to their “home room” of the preceding 
term on coming to the school. 
2. Pupils promoted from the grades below to the departmental 
work to go to a designated room and teacher for classification. 
3. Pupils new to the system to go to another room and teacher 
for classification.
-P-A-G-E-105
  
-—-_-— THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 89 
4. Both 2 and 8 might better meet in the auditorium, if there be 
such a room. 
5. Home-room assignments made (9.00-9.15), and pupils sent at 
signal to new home-room, where teachers seat and enroll as in 
the grades. 
6. The pupils now, with the assistance of the home-room teach- 
ers, make up their individual programs from the room pro- 
gram on the blackboard and the schedule key in the hands of 
the teacher. 
7, Pupils promoted in all subjects and regular simply copy the 
room or class program; pupils irregular are given variations 
by the teacher from the schedule key she holds. 
The above, together with book lists, book charging, and an- 
nouncements probably will occupy from a half to three 
quarters of an hour. It probably now will be an advantage 
to run through the day’s program of room changes, using 
eight- to ten-minute periods, until the home room is 
again reached. ‘This will familiarize the pupils with the 
changes, give the different departmental teachers an oppor- 
tunity to assign places and make announcements, and get 
everything ready for starting on the regular program imme- 
diately after the morning recess. In a small school this ex- 
perimental run of the room changes is hardly necessary; in a 
large school, and especially in a regularly organized junior 
high school, it is quite desirable. 
Again, if the school as a whole happens to be organized as 
a Gary-type, companion-class, or platoon school, a still dif- 
ferent type of preliminary organization will be needed for all 
pupils, though many of the details as to procedure previ- 
ously given will still apply. Under any one of these plans, 
as will be described further on, there are more pupils than 
there are classroom seats, there being virtually two compan- 
ion schools in the building at the same time. While one of 
these schools (A) is reciting in the classrooms, the other 
school (B) is at work in the shops, special rooms, or on the 
playground. The building is thus made to carry two
-P-A-G-E-106

schools. The details for such a type of organization will be 
given later. 
Recess, lines, and assembly. The different teachers 
will have been instructed, at the preceding conferences, as to 
dismissals, stairways to use, signals, etc., and will have been 
told, assuming that lines have been in use in the school, that 
at the first recess period the temporary yard organization 
will be perfected. Yard and basement assignments for 
teachers will also have been made, if the school has in the 
past followed this plan. 
At the close of the recess period, a short time will be taken 
to form and place the lines. Each teacher and class will take 
the position assigned to it by the principal, according to a 
worked-out plan, the details of which will be given in the fol- 
lowing chapter. The position of each class will be deter- 
mined by the shape of the yard, position of entrances, and 
scheme of movement. The necessary instructions are given 
to the pupils, the music is started, and the classes march in 
in the order called and pass to their rooms. After a few at- 
tempts the order and plan will become mechanized. The 
same oversight will be given to the lining up and marching 
in at the afternoon assembly, recess, and for a few days 
thereafter. 
After the recess the remainder of the morning will be de- 
voted to regular classroom instruction, and the school will be 
expected to settle down to its routine procedure as rapidly as 
possible. The afternoon session will find a few new pupils, 
mostly pupils coming by transfer from other schools, but or- 
dinarily these will be so few in number that the principal can 
handle and classify them alone. 
The great advantage of all the preliminary planning and 
conferences on problems of organization will early be appar- 
ent. A carefully planned and businesslike way of handling 
the difficulties which always present themselves on the
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 91 
opening day creates a healthy and lasting impression on pu- 
‘pils, teachers, and parents, insures for the school a higher 
degree of efficiency, and does much to make all concerned 
feel that the principal is master of his work. 
The afternoon teachers’ meeting. The principal will nat- 
urally have been moving about over his building during the 
day, looking in here and there and seeing conditions, an- 
swering questions of teachers, settling problems at least ten- 
tatively, helping in the revision of other tentative decisions 
of the morning, making adjustments of pupils and classes, 
and other similar work; but, notwithstanding all that may be 
done in this manner during the day, and it should be much, 
there will of necessity be many questions and problems that 
will need a hasty talking over by the group. For this an af- 
ternoon teachers’ meeting in the building will be desirable. 
This should be called as soon after school closes as the teach- 
ers are free. The principal should clear his office rapidly so 
as to get to this. The teachers are tired, and they ought to 
be allowed to go home as soon as can conveniently be done. 
The meeting ought to be carried through rapidly, without 
wasting time in considering matters that can wait, or in pro- 
longed discussion of any point. The principal again needs to 
have in mind, or still better on a card, a program of what he 
intends to take up, and matters that are not then important 
should either be quickly and tentatively ruled on or be re- 
served for consideration at a later meeting. 
The teachers should bring to this meeting a final day’s 
Classification Report, and each class and grade can be 
quickly called for and noted down on a final first-day’s 
Room and Grade. Classification Report Sheet. Each 
teacher should also bring in a written list of all pupils who 
ought to be in attendance, according to the promotion lists, 
and have not yet appeared. It is likely that each teacher 
will have problems — pupils, organization, seating, sup- 
plies, etc. — that she will want to raise questions about, and
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
on many of these the principal will want to make a note for 
action before the following morning. The principal, too, 
will want to bring up matters noted during the day on his 
pocket card, or on the slips on his office files, and also prob- 
ably to ask about particular cases, though much time should 
not be taken in considering any case or problem of interest 
to only one teacher. Marching plans, yard organization, 
the fire drill, basement and toilet supervision, and play di- 
rection are also subjects that it may seem desirable to take 
up for brief consideration. If the principal is new to the 
school these would better be left, for a time at least, as they 
have been in the past, any discussion now being merely to 
make action clearer or more forceful the following day. | 
Before leaving for the night the principal should report to 
the office of the Superintendent of Schools the condition of 
his building as to pupils and seats, and any other important 
matters. He will take home with him the serious problems 
of adjustment which he faces, that he may think them over 
and plan for the following day. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Show that executive skill consists in part in the ability to get others to 
codperate and carry the details of an undertaking. 
2. Suppose the janitor to be new and not possessed of much head; how 
handle the preliminary supply distribution so as to get the results de- 
sired? 
8. Map out a plan of teacher and pupil codperation and assignment for 
each of the buildings shown in Figures 5 to 10, Chapter VI. 
4, State how you would handle the pupil entry and classification in each 
of these buildings. 
5. Draw up a supposed first-day pupil and grade Classification Report 
Sheet for any one of the buildings. 
6. Why keep the principal's office free of chairs? Why isit best for him to 
stand the first morning? 
7. To carry through the first day’s work properly and expeditiously, list 
the things a teacher would need to plan, have, and write on the black- 
board before the school began the first day. 
8. What types of questions would you expect to take up at the teachers’ 
meeting the evening of the first day? 
9. What types of problems would the principal probably need to take 
home with him the first night?
-P-A-G-E-109
  CHAPTER VI 
INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS 
1. Intermissions and lines 
Size of grounds a limiting factor. Just how a principal 
shall arrange his recess'periods, and handle his playground 
at other times, depends much on the size and character of 
his play space, as well as on the number and grade-distribu- 
tion of the children in his school. In a school which has 
plenty of play space all the children can be on the grounds at 
once, the recess period can take place simultaneously for all, 
and the before-school period will not give any particular 
trouble. Many schools are not so fortunately situated, 
however. Especially in eastern cities are the school 
grounds, for the older buildings at least, very commonly 
small and ill-suited to modern play needs, and principals of 
such schools are frequently called upon to exercise a large 
amount of ingenuity to care for the recess and play needs of 
their children. Sometimes, where street play is not per- 
mitted by the city authorities, standing room only is all that . 
is available, and the recess periods are merely walking- 
around and fresh-air periods. 
In an average city, not suffering specially from congestion 
of population, a school site ought properly to contain some- 
where near 200 square feet (c.14’X14’) for each child. This 
would be 218 children to the acre, or would require a site of 
about four and a half acres for a school of 1000 pupils. The 
percentage of ‘the site taken up by the building will also 
materially influence the playground possibilities. A fifteen- 
room elementary-school building, with a carrying load of 
500 children, located on a quarter of a large city block with 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  94 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
grounds but 200 X 225 feet in size, would have only about 60 
square feet (7$ X 8 feet) per pupil. In such a case, dismiss- 
als, games, and sports will need to be organized quite differ- 
ently from what would be the case were the same school to 
have a whole block of land. Assuming a full’block, and 
making the same allowance for the building as before, there 
would then be about 300 square feet (15 X 20) of play space 
per pupil. This would give plenty of room for games re- 
quiring space, simultaneous recesses, plenty of free play, and 
parts of the grounds could be set apart for special purposes. 
Handling recess periods. The first problem that a prin- 
cipal faces in the matter of his recess periods is that of the 
size and nature of his school grounds and the use he can 
make of his streets. While usually he cannot change condi- 
tions, and must deal with situations as they exist, he must 
arrange his intermissions and organize his playground activ- 
ities with these limitations clearly in mind. Figures 5 to 10, 
given on the pages which follow, and which have been 
drawn from actual situations, show the many different 
types and conditions of buildings and grounds which a prin- 
cipal may meet. Each of these presents an entirely differ- 
ent problem in organization, both for recess periods and 
for play. Games suitable to the larger and less-crowded 
grounds are not possible on the smaller sites. Streets 
scarcely need be used where the site is large, but must be 
used, if permitted, where the site is small. The handling of 
the street play, and its policing, becomes an additional 
problem where the site is small. 
In the schools represented in Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 there 
is room for all children to be on the playground at one time, 
and in 8, 9, and 10 no use need be made of the adjacent 
streets. Even in Figure 7 the use of streets could be dis- 
pensed with, if necessary, but their use is desirable if possi- 
ble as the children are thus spread out more, the play is

It is located on half of a city block, a trifle over an acre in size. The carrying load of the school is 475 pupils, which gives, counting building, 105 square feet per pupil. A part of the grounds has been taken by two portables, located at the rear, and by planting, so that the available play space is much lessened in consequence. Two small indoor playrooms, though, are provided in the basement, and the large lower hallway, which is lighted by a sky- light, is also used on rainy days. Street play is forbidden by city ordinance. ‘There is no play apparatus on the grounds. The school has no kindergarten, and grades 1 to 8 are on the grade plan.

A wooden building of an old type, located in the center of a city block of a little over two 
acres. Six portable buildings have been set up in the yard to carry the increase in attend- 
ance, The school has 24 classroom teachers, and special teachers for domestic science and 
manual training, and a carrying load of 840 pupils. This gives 107 square feet per pupil, 
counting building space. Street play is prohibited by city ordinance. No play apparatus 
is provided for the grounds. The school has nine grades and kindergarten, grades 7 to 9 be- 
ing on the third floor and organized as a junior high school. On the second and third floors 
another classroom is located over the south entrance. Good playrooms are in the base- 
ment, as are the toilet rooms. The basement may be entered from both sides of the yard, as 
well as from the inside. The large central lower floor is also used for play in bad weather. 
There is but one large double stairway, but this has been rebuilt in iron, and two circular 
slide fire-escapes have been attached to the landings.

grounds, and in both Figures 5 and 6 the very limited play 
space, make the use of the simultaneous recess almost im- 
possible and the use of the streets for play very desirable. 
Perhaps the best plan, if the grounds are not too cramped, 
is to divide the school for recess purposes into two divisions 
or sections, consisting of: 
Section I — Grades 1 to 4 inclusive. 
Section II — Grades 5 to 8 inclusive. 
Then arrange the recess periods so that only one section is 
on the grounds at a time, and divide each section into two 
parts, according to sex. Then divide the playground so 
that each sex has its own play space. Even with such an ar- 
rangement, which covers only the recess periods, there will ~ 
be much crowding before school in the morning and at 
noons, unless a difference of twenty to thirty minutes is 
made in the opening and closing times. In schools having 
no indoor playground there will bé further difficulties to be 
provided against on rainy or cold days. In a school of the 
type of Figure 6, having small and crowded grounds and all 
grades from kindergarten through the ninth grade, and with 
the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades organized as a junior 
high school, three recesses would seem most desirable, with 
the school divided as follows: 
Section I— Grades 1 to 3, and kindergarten. 
Section II — Grades 4 to 6. 
Section III — Grades 7 to 9. 
All these contingencies may require two series of pro- 
grams, one for good weather and one for bad, and different 
playground arrangements for morning and noon on the one 
hand, and recess periods on the other. Not only will the 
disposition of the play space need to be different for the dif- 
ferent contingencies, but the arrangements for dismissals 
will need to be different also. In such schools as are shown

Located in a small city, on a block of approximately three and a half acres. ‘The original school was an eight-room building. With increasing population a new building of sixteen rooms was erected, as well as a special building for manual training and domestic science. ‘Twenty-two rooms are now used for nine grades, grades 7, 8, and 9 being organized as a junior high school. The building now carries 625 pupils, which gives, counting buildings, 252 square feet per pupil. The second floor of each building is a duplicate of the first, except that in the old building the space over the principal's office is given to a broad stair landing, leading to the circular fire-escape.

Lines and marching. Unless traditions have become 
well established and it seems inadvisable to change them, 
the question of lines and marching will come up for consider- 
ation and discussion almost from the first. In taking 
charge of a new school it probably will be best to start with 
the plan with which all are acquainted, and make any de- 
sired changes later. As the question of lines and marching 
involves the whole question as to the best method of getting 
pupils into and out of and about a school building, some 
consideration of the problem is called for here as a phase of 
the organization of a school. Some principals and teachers 
prefer the regular organization of the pupils into lines, the 
provision of music for marching, movement as per signals, 
and the entrance and exit of pupils in military order. Other 
principals contend that this plan is not only not necessary 
but that it is extremely undesirable, and that its use is the 
cause of from one fourth to one third of the disciplinary 
cases that occur in a school. Still other principals use both 
lines and marching and irregular entry, under different con- 
ditions and circumstances, varying from one to the other as 
different needs seem to indicate. Both plans possess certain 
values, and a brief consideration of the arguments on each 
side may be useful at this point. 
The argument for lines and marching. The argument 
for lines and marching arises in part from the classification 
of this as a routine, rather than a judgment factor in school 
organization and control. Especially is this true for a 
school located in a foreign section of a city, or a school where 
discipline and orderly procedure are lacking. As a routine 
factor it of course ought to be transformed into mechanized

This building is of wood construction, and is one story high with a high basement. It is located in the center of a block of approximately three acres, in an incorporated town, and to it children are brought in automobile busses. The main floor has twelve regular class- rooms, office and teachers’ room, and an auditorium. In the high basement are located a - gymnasium under the auditorium, toilet rooms, a lunch, room, and rooms for manual train- ing and domestic science. ‘The school has a kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, grades 6, 7, and 8 being organized on the departmental plan, ‘Twelve teachers and a principal are employed. As a grade school the carrying load is 420 pupils, which gives, counting space occupied by buildings, 250 square feet per pupil. ‘This building is so arranged that it could be reorgan- ized as a platoon-type school, as will be pointed out in Chapter VIII, carry twice the load, and still have 125 square feet per pupil.

routine as early as possible. This will leave the energy of 
principal and teachers and the time of the pupils free for the 
larger problems of the school. The pupils learn precision 
and orderly movement, a spirit of pride is developed in the 
community action, a public force in the shape of community 
opinion is awakened which helps to eliminate careless and 
thoughtless conduct, a good preparation to handle one’s self 
in a crowd or jam is given, the pupils in the elementary 
grades enjoy the marching, time is saved, and the school 
presents a good appearance to officers and visitors. In a 
way good lines and good marching impress both pupils and 
visitors with the leadership of the principal. They are con- 
crete and visible expression of the order and precision of his 
working habits and his businesslike ways. A principal who 
has had military training, or who is of the military type of 
mind, can use lines and marching with apparent marked 
effectiveness. 
Organizing the lines. If the principal decides to use 
lines, and to have the pupils march into and out of the build- 
ing in lines and to music, he needs to organize the whole line 
problem thoroughly. Its success should be marked from 
the first, and this calls for attention to the small details and 
an enthusiastic and vigorous organization at the start. Good 
psychology demands that the whole activity be transformed 
into mechanized routine as quickly as possible. 
Where marching in line is to be the policy, the principal 
is responsible for assignment to position of each class in the 
lining up, order of march, etc. To be sure, he may call his 
teachers into conference and work out the details with them, 
or will propose a working plan and ask them to help refine it 
for him. The order of march should be arranged as far as 
possible so that the class having the farthest to go before 
reaching its room will get in first. It is well to arrange this 
order if possible so that it will be identical with that to be

Located on a city block of approximately four acres. ‘The school is two stories high, and has two covered wet- or hot-weather playgrounds on the roof. Toilets are located through- out the building, off the various rooms. ‘The school has twenty-four regular classrooms, an auditorium, and special rooms for manual training, domestic science, music, drawing, and science. The carrying load of the school is 840 children. ‘The school has a kindergarten and nine grades, the three highest being organized as a junior high school. ‘This gives a ground space of 187 square feet per pupil, building included. The domestic science suite, and the art and music rooms are on the second floor at the front. The branch library, office, and suditorium may be reached without any other parts of the building being opened,

used in the fire-drill. Teachers may be stationed along the 
line of march as seems necessary, but it is better to use pupil 
monitors if it can be arranged. The principal must be gen- 
eral supervisor of this order, and much depends upon him as 
to whether the method secures its purpose or not. 
The following details, at least, will need careful attention 
and organization: 
1. Gong signals. If the school has an automatic program clock 
this will be all that is necessary, but most elementary schools are 
not so supplied. In this case, have the signal system and times 
written down plainly and in order on a card, to be tacked up by the 
push button for the janitor’s use in giving the signals. Do not de- 
pend onmemory. Also have the signals given rapidly, and do not 
keep the pupils standing in line or waiting in the rooms a second 
longer than is necessary. A waiting line is a breeder of trouble, 
and pupils kept standing lose their zest for the marching game. 
2. Routes of marching. This will prove troublesome only to the 
new pupils. Plan routes carefully, give definite instructions, and 
have some of the pupils who know lead the way. Have teachers 
see that their classes get started right. With little ones it will be 
necessary for the teachers to start many of them in the steps, and 
teach them the marching rhythm and swing. 
3. Exits to be used. For the sake of safety in case of fire use the 
nearest exit, as far as possible for each room. If there is a street on 
one side of the building in which there is a great deal of traffic, and 
but little traffic on another, this will have to be considered. If the 
yard is large and exits are not directly on the street, only the fire 
precaution will need to be considered. A circular slide for fire es- 
cape, such as is shown on the buildings of Figures 6, 7, and 8, can be 
used most effectively. Deprivation of its use will serve as a pun- 
ishment, so popular is such a slide. 
4. Double and single files. This will depend on the width of the 
halls. Pupils from different rooms may pass out in single parallel 
lines or join into double lines. Keep 18 inches between pupils if 
possible, but do not keep lines standing long. 
5. Use of stairways. If very narrow or crooked, use single lines; 
if wider, double lines. Ona very broad staircase, four-abreast may 
be managed. Always think of fire precautions and safety of de- 
scent.
-P-A-G-E-121
  INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS 105 
6. Traffic in the streets. Insist that children stay on the side- 
walks, if there is much traffic in the street. If one or more streets 
next the building are practically free from traffic at dismissal, allow 
children to use street if necessary to avoid congestion. Lines prob- 
ably will not need to be maintained after reaching the sidewalk. The 
organization of a traffic squad of older pupils to police the streets 
will prove useful. 
7. Signals for return. ‘Three minutes before time for the close of 
play give a warning signal on gong, different from other signals. 
Three or four short-spaced rings will be good. _ This will bea warn- 
ing signal only. Pupils can go on with play, get drinks, or gather 
up balls and wraps, and get ready. At the end of the three min- 
utes give one long sharp signal. At this every pupil is to stop play 
and talking, and face the yard teachers or the school. The yard 
teachers or principal may now make announcements, or the princi- 
pal may use a megaphone for the same purpose if he could not other- 
wise be heard. When ready to pass a signal is given on a whistle, 
at which the pupils move to their positions, form in lines, and pass 
into the building. If no announcement is to be made, give not less 
than five nor more than ten seconds before blowing the forward 
movement signal, to let the play exuberance quiet down somewhat 
and bring the school under control. The psychology of eliminating 
trouble in the lines lies largely in gaining this control. 
8. Returning to rooms after recesses. Have the older pupils lead, 
and have the pupils return the way they marched out. Have 
teachers go with the primary pupils. Have all directed as to the 
place where lines form after recess. 
9. Dismissing big and little children without interference. This 
will take care of itself if the time schedule is properly cared for. The 
rooms on the lower floor should pass out first, while the pupils from 
the upper rooms are coming down stairs. Good timing here is de- 
sirable. 
10. Leaders for lines. These should always be selected from last 
year’s pupils. Have the teachers pick dependable children at first; 
later the class may be permitted to choose, or leadership may be 
made an honor. 
11. Music for marching. If available this is a potent aid to order 
and regularity. Drum or victrola or triangle will serve as a substi- 
tute if piano or orchestra is not to be had. If the school has an 
orchestra this is a good time to use it. 
Have the teachers give these instructions to the pupils
-P-A-G-E-122
  106 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
as the need for them arises. It is poor planning to give a 
lot of instructions that are to be held in mind for execu- 
tion at a remote time. Children will remember, if they do 
the thing when it is ordered, and just as it is ordered. 
The argument against lines, The bearing of the method 
of movement in and out and about a building on the lives of 
the children outside the school needs also to be considered. 
There are many principals who oppose the use of lines and 
marching and contend that, since school should prepare for 
life by living life, and as adults do not line up and march 
into and out of buildings, shops, stores, churches, theaters, 
or public meetings of any kind, lines and marching in 
schools are unnatural life procedures and should be aban- 
doned. The cry of progressive educators, they say, has been 
against the creation of an artificial schoolroom atmosphere 
and procedure, so why then should we create for the school 
an organized system entirely divorced from the usage of or- 
dinary life. Pupils know where and how to go, they say, 
and would do so if left alone. Such principals allow their 
pupils to pass from rooms in any reasonably quiet manner, 
have no music or lines or marching, and bring the pupils into 
the building by one signal to stop play and stand just where 
they are, and another, immediately afterward, to move 
quietly to the proper entrance and walk to their rooms. 
The pupils move at their own rate, may talk and laugh in 
passing, and in every way conduct themselves as normally 
as possible. Some excellent training in self-control and self- 
direction no doubt is given in such schools, and a large 
amount of self-dependence is developed. Carried too far 
such schools become noisy and careless, the entry is a rough- 
and-tumble procedure, and the independence developed fre- 
quently exhibits its natural outcome in a lack of ability to 
act together in any united way. 
Our national life calls for two types of self-discipline.
-P-A-G-E-123
    INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS 107 
One type is the ability to care for one’s self, and to direct 
one’s own life. A too rigid insistence on lines and marching 
and quiet and policing naturally tends to defeat such inde- 
pendence in action. The other type of discipline called for 
demands that at times each subordinate himself to a com- 
mon purpose, and at times yield up his independence in ac- 
tion and follow a leader. Both types of self-discipline are 
called for in the modern world, and a combination of the two 
is desirable in the school. The problem, then, that the 
school principal faces, is how to combine these two types of 
training and secure for his pupils the best in each. 
Minimizing the marching procedure. Most principals 
would agree that, after the school has been organized, the 
principal and teachers established in control, the marching 
procedure learned for fire-drill and public-exercise needs, and 
the school reduced to order and system, then at least the 
principal and teachers might well set about the gradual elim- 
ination of all unnecessary formality and routine. The aim 
should then be to substitute individual control for mechan- 
ized routine in policed lines. To keep pupils marching in 
silent lines, to fife and drum, and with a teacher at every 
corner watching for offenders, not only does not develop self- 
control but is an almost certain breeder of disciplinary trou- 
bles. One of the strong arguments against lines and march- 
ing is that they are too prolific of cases of discipline. Not 
only is this true, but a situation is created in which teachers 
and principal do not show to advantage, and in consequence 
discipline is weakened. 
It is possible gradually to change line organization from 
aroutine to a judgment procedure, and to bring into it 
the educational elements of self-direction and self-control. 
This necessitates the gradual minimizing of lines and march- 
ing, and the limiting their use to those necessary occasions 
when such procedure is the obvious one to follow. March-
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ing out in lines and order, a few times a week, is valuable as 
a matter of self-discipline, and as a preparation for such 
emergencies as the fire-drill. It is also useful as a phase of 
the work in physical training. ‘To move a large number of 
children from their rooms to an assembly hall, in a short pe- 
riod of time, and to avoid congestion in entrance and seat- 
ing, may also possibly call for dismissal by rooms and by or+ 
derly procedure. On the playground, special periods for 
marching exercises may be utilized, when all join in march- 
ing up and down, with music and flags, and as a pleasurable 
drill. The salute to the flag may be accompanied with a lin- 
ing-up of the pupils in designated positions. 
Building up self-control. A principal may allow rooms 
located near an exit to pass out quietly and quickly, without 
forming into lines. This liberty will be recognized as a 
privilege, and will serve to stimulate pupil control. By do- 
ing this, in some buildings, the pressure on central corridors 
may be so relieved that the others may then be allowed to 
pass out in the same informal way. In moving to assembly 
halls it may be arranged that pupils pass directly and with- 
out forming lines. A principal can easily find many oppor- 
tunities to minimize routine and extend freedom, and in do- 
ing so save time and build up pupil self-dependence and con- 
trol. This will tend to remove the cause of much petty dis- 
cipline, relieve the teachers of an onerous duty, and train the 
pupils to respect the rights of others through rational self- 
control. By permitting the pupils to move freely and to 
converse while passing the school is extending to them, as 
fast as they can use it, a personal liberty that is important, 
and one which they may retain so long as the rights and 
privileges of others in the school are not molested. 
As will be pointed out in a later chapter, such self-control 
can be greatly added to by organizing the school as a civic 
and social body, with departments of health, police, etc.,
-P-A-G-E-125
INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS 109 
and making the pupils feel that, subject to the necessary ad- 
vice and guidance, it is their job to assume responsibility 
for control. To build up such a conception in some schools 
may require time, and in some foreign neighborhoods it may 
meet with opposition from the parents, but when it is once 
established the results in training for future living are large 
and school discipline is reduced in consequence to a mini- 
mum. 
In conclusion, then, there is no one method that is best 
suited to all conditions and to all schools and seasons. At 
times a military procedure is desirable, and for certain pur- 
poses almost a necessity. At other times as large personal 
liberty as can be used intelligently is what is needed. In 
some types of buildings and neighborhoods marching in 
lines seems desirable; in other types of buildings and neigh- 
borhoods not. The principal must here be allowed a rather 
free hand so long as his method shows a definite plan and 
purpose and a reasonable degree of common sense. The 
danger lies in the two extremes — military precision and a 
disorderly procedure — rather than in a combined plan or 
on middle ground. 
2. Fire-drills 
Purpose of the drill. The laws of our different American 
States, and the rules and regulations of practically all city 
boards of education, alike require that the children in our 
schools be trained to leave the school building according to 
what is known as a fire-drill, so that, in case of a fire, the 
danger of loss of life may be minimized. The purpose of 
the drill is to make the exit of the pupils from the building as 
nearly automatic as possible. This drill takes precedence 
over every other school activity, and aims at the rapid and 
safe exit of every pupil and teacher from the school building. 
It is not to be taken as a joke, a race, or an exhibition, but is
-P-A-G-E-126
  EE LE 
110 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
a serious undertaking intended to fasten a habit, so that 
panic danger in case of a real fire may be eliminated as far as 
possible. 
Organizing the fire-drill. If the building of which the 
principal is in charge is a modern fireproof or largely fire- 
proof structure, the inauguration of the fire-drill need not be 
taken up at once, unless the rules so require, but if the build- 
ing is of wood or is a brick shell, or has poor stairways and 
exits, the matter of a fire-drill should receive attention not 
later than the second morning. In such cases the principal, 
at the teachers’ meeting at the close of the first day’s work, 
should give directions to the teachers that a fire-drill will be 
practiced the following morning, and should issue the rules 
that are to govern all signals and movements. The duty of 
the principal in the matter is to outline the best method for 
getting the children out of the building. If the principal is 
new to the school he will do well to confer with his teachers 
as to previous practices, and in any case to consider all sug- 
gestions they may offer as to the organization and conduct 
of the drills. After the details have been decided upon, and 
the teachers are conversant with the plan to be followed, it 
is then the duty of the teachers to carry out the plan and of 
the principal to see that they do so. 
By way of illustration, the directioris issued for the build- 
ing shown in Figure 7, page 98, are reproduced here: 
DIRECTIONS FOR FIRE-DRILL 
1. Fire signal. One long and two short. Stop work and form in 
single files in aisles, teacher opens door, room captains lead, 
and pupils follow by rows and pass at once to street in order 
printed. Teacher last to leave room, except in kindergarten 
and first grade, where teachers will need to lead line until 
room|captains arrive. 
2. Order of Passing. Rooms 1 and 8, followed by 2 and 7, pass 
out north exit to street.. If exit closed, then in reverse order
-P-A-G-E-127
INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS lll 
out of north side of rear exit to alley, and thence to position 
in north street. 
Rooms 4 and 5, followed by 3 and 6, pass out south exit to 
street. If exit closed, then in reverse order out of south side 
of rear exit to alley, and thence to position in south street. 
Second floor rooms 9, 10, 15, and 16 move by twos down 
north side of stairway to landing, and rooms 11, 12, 18, and 14 
down south side of stairway to landing and join, and then de- 
scend main stairway by fours and pass directly out front door. 
If front door blocked, then divide by twos and pass out of 
north and south end exits and pass to position on west street 
via sidewalks. 
8. Regulations. Move carefully, by twos. Do not try to hurry. 
Step quickly, but do not run. Keep step and speed with the 
line. Do not talk after leaving classroom until in position in 
street. 
Follow the captains, and look and listen for directions from 
captains or teachers. Follow any directions they may give. 
Do not move from your position in the street until directed 
to do so by teacher. In case of a real fire no pupil may leave 
the line except by permission of the teacher. 
4. Return Order. When “fire out” signal (one long and two 
short whistles, given by principal) sounds, follow directions of 
teacher and lead of captains, and return to rooms in reverse 
order of exit. 
Let us assume that the principal and teachers agree that 
the first practice drill is to be held at.9.45 the second morn- 
ing. This will give the teachers time to explain the signals 
and procedure to the children, and to practice the little 
children in the movements. ‘The signals and procedure for 
each room above the first grade should be placed on the 
blackboard by the teacher, and allowed to remain for a 
week or two, until the drill has been learned. In a school 
which has quite a permanent constituency much less time 
will be needed to learn the drill than in a school where many 
changes are taking place. The first time the drill is tried 
the pupils should be told that the fire signal will sound this 
morning, for a practice drill, When the signal sounds, the
-P-A-G-E-128
112 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
class should follow the directions just given, and should be 
told that they may be halted at the stairs or doorway for 
further instructions. No attempt at speed should be made. 
Under the leadership of the teacher the class should pass to 
the yard and to the designated position outside, where the 
class in the future will always line up. This is to be a fixed 
position for each class, so that, in case of a fire, parents will 
know where to find their children. There the class is to re- 
main, under the care of the teacher, until the “fire-out” sig- 
nal is sounded, when the class is to return with the teacher 
to the classroom. 
To see that the pupils understand the plan, a second alarm 
might well be sounded immediately after the pupils are well 
in their seats, this time without warning. All future drills 
are also to be sounded without warning. During the first 
few weeks the drill should be sounded rather frequently. 
As soon as it is evident that the pupils have learned the drill, 
and such variations, such as blocked stairways, as the needs 
of the building seem to require, the frequency can be reduced 
to once in two or three weeks, or even once in four weeks 
later in the year, unless drills at stated intervals are required 
by the schoolboard regulations. 
Cautions to be observed. The fire-drill, to be most ef- 
fective, should be adapted to the conditions peculiar to the 
particular building. Unless building conditions are uni- 
form, no one form of drill should be prescribed for the school 
system of a city. The special conditions within a building 
may make two, or possibly even three variations of the drill 
desirable, the one to be used being indicated by different sig- 
nals or different forms of control. In an old frame building, 
with heating plant in the basement, the stairways might 
easily become blocked and other than the regular ways would 
then have to be used. Even the fire escapes might have to 
be employed. Because of the danger of confusion, however,
-P-A-G-E-129
ee ee 
INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS 118 
the number of plans should be limited to the fewest possible, 
safety considered. A useful variety may be introduced by 
occasionally closing or roping-off certain exits or stairways, 
by having certain rooms use the fire escapes, or by planning 
the drill to empty all from the assembly hall. 
In giving the practice drills, certain precautions need to 
be borne in mind by the principal. The time for the drill 
should be chosen with some care. For this reason it is bet- 
ter that the time for drills be determined by the principal, 
and he be held responsible for the use of good judgment as to 
when to call for them. In many cities it is customary for 
the superintendent to announce his presence by sounding 
the alarm, or for the city fire department officials to enter 
the building and give the signal. It is not a bad idea to have 
a member of the district fire department occasionally pres- 
ent to witness the drill, and to listen to any suggestions he 
may have to offer. In many other cities, on the contrary, 
the responsibility for fire-drills is placed solely with the prin- 
cipal. Parental complaint as to unseasonable alarms then 
comes directly to him. 
A drill should not be sounded when it is raining, during or 
after a heavy snow and before walks have been cleared, or 
on cold, windy, raw days when the exposure of children from 
warm rooms might result in injury. For this reason the 
drill should be thoroughly learned early in the Autumn, so as 
not to need much practice in mid-winter. A large degree of 
common sense, too, must be used as to when to hold the 
practice. In general, morning is the best time, and imme- 
diately after lunch the poorest. 
Special points to be looked after. The following special 
points should be observed in the organization and conduct 
of the fire-drill: 
1.- The signal. A special loud gong, located in the main hallway 
of each floor and basement, and not used for any other purpose, is  
-P-A-G-E-130
114 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL | 
desirable for fire-signal purposes. This should be so wired that all 
bells can be rung from any floor. It should be tested each morning 
to see that it is in order. If the building does not have a separate 
bell system, then a special signal, not used for any other purpose, 
should be employed. The signal should be sharp, and of a charac- 
ter to take the children out of their seats with a jump. 
2. Exits. All doors should open outward, and be provided with 
panic bolts so adjusted that kindergarten children can by pressure 
open the doors. If panic bolts are not on, the doors must be kept 
unlocked while children are in the building. Certain older children 
should be chosen, from the upper rooms, to move: to the various 
exits on the sounding of the alarm and see that all doors are 
open. 
3. Leaders or captains. The most level-headed children should 
be chosen for leaders or captains of the lines. There should be two 
for each room, and they should be seated near the exit. Older cap- 
tains from adjacent rooms should be ready to lead the kindergarten 
and first-grade children, so that the teacher may be the last to 
leave. Unless these little ones have a separate exit, or can easily 
get out first, they should wait until the last, as they are timid and 
panicky, and harder to keep moving. 
4. Care for cripples. Children slightly crippled should go to rear 
of room line, and be looked after by some able child. In general 
they should pass out after the room has been cleared; they must 
not be allowed to impede the motion of the lines. For each seriously 
crippled child have two able pupils designated to make a hand sad- 
dle, and carry such from the building, following after the others. 
5. Lines. Have an order for passing, with lead classes for each 
floor. Have children pass by twos, as this tends to prevent panic 
and gives each child a helper in case of astumble. Some principals 
have each pair take hold of hands, though there are often personal 
objections to this, unless there is smoke in the building, or unless 
the stairs are crooked and dark. In general, lines from a floor 
above must halt at base of stairs if lines from below are using exit, 
though one line from above may step abreast of a line below and 
pass if exit is wide enough. ‘Teachers direct such movements. 
6. Order and speed. Safety first is the important principle. Give 
attention to this, and not primarily to speed. Do not emphasize 
the time element. If a building can be cleared in two and a half to 
three minutes, it is safe enough. Nothing is to be gained by hurry- 
ing the lines, as disorder and stumbling not only delay but tend to 
general panic. No talking, not necessary, should be the absolute
-P-A-G-E-131
  INTERMISSIONS, LINES, AND DRILLS 115 
rule. Order and discipline in the lines should be made to seem very 
.. important to the children. 
7. Music and marching. Some principals use music and march- 
ing, as tending to quiet a panic should one arise, but in general this 
is not desirable. There will be delay in waiting for the music, and 
in case of actual fire it might be lacking. Pupils trained to good 
and automatic response and possessed of a sound morale will move 
more rapidly without music. 
8. Clearing the rooms and floors. Every one — children, cripples, 
teachers, and visitors — must leave the rooms and floors. In gen- 
eral, the room captains should lead and the teachers leave last, af- 
ter all is clear; but, since the teacher should keep with her class, 
there should be floor captains to check up each room, cloakroom, 
and hallway, and report the floor clear to the principal below. 
Sometimes each teacher is responsible for her room and one teacher 
for the floor, these “clean-up” teachers reporting from the top floor 
downward and the basement upward to the principal, who should 
take his stand in the main lower hallway, help direct the passing, 
and leave the building last. Arrangements should be made with 
the telephone company, by the superintendent’s office, that, in 
case of an actual fire in any building, a message will be telephoned 
to central that a certain school is on fire, and that the building has 
been cleared and every one is safe and under the care of teachers 
outside. Central can then answer all inquiries from parents. 
9. Stopping places. A designated stopping place for each room 
must be determined upon, and never varied from. If not reached 
by the regular exit, a roundabout route to the designated place 
must be followed. These stopping places must be selected with 
reference to distance from danger, street traffic, fire-engine ap- 
proaches, hydrants and hose-lines, ete. On arrival the pupils 
must stay placed, remain reasonably quiet, and the teacher must 
not leave them. In case of fire and bad weather the principal may 
direct their removal to some better place or shelter, leaving a room 
captain to direct parents. In no case should a teacher permit a 
child to leave the line to start home alone, but should hold them 
until the parents arrive, or until the principal authorizes their dis- 
missal to go home. Only the principal should sound the “‘fire- 
out” or recall, and until this has been sounded the classes should 
not move to return. 
10. Books and wraps. It is not the prime business of the drill to 
save property, but to get the children to safety. No attempt 
should be made to save books or wraps if the building presents 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
a bad fire hazard. Books should be left in any case, but in bad 
weather and in buildings that present no bad fire hazard (heating - 
plant outside; not over two stories; good stairs; slow-burning con- 
struction) a separate signal may indicate that pupils should pass 
through cloakrooms and get and throw about them coats or wraps 
for protection. If wraps are taken, stop and adjust hastily before 
passing into the hallways, so that there may be no confusion in 
or stopping of the line once it gets started. 
11. Fighting the fire. It is not primarily the business of the 
school to fight a fire, yet some effort should be made to hold a small 
fire in check until the fire department arrives. To this end a small 
number of chosen or elected older boys, probably best the clean-up 
floor captains, should remain with the principal and janitor to act 
as temporary firemen until the regular firemen arrive. Of this little 
group the principal should be commander-in-chief. 
Carried out in this way, the fire-drill can be made edu- 
cative to a high degree in any school.

  CHAPTER VII 
YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 
1. Yard organization 
Varying problems. As was stated in the previous chapter, 
the size of grounds and school are very important limiting 
factors in determining not only recess periods, but school- 
ground. organization .as well. In a school such as the one 
shown in Figure 5, where a double recess is necessary, or the 
one shown in Figure 6, where a triple recess is advisable, 
and where there is actually much congestion at times before 
school in the morning and at noons, quite a different prob- 
lem confronts the principal from that found in such schools 
as are shown in Figures 8, 9, and 10, where the playroom is 
ample for all. The lack of play apparatus in the school 
yards shown in Figures 5 and 6 also accentuates the prob- 
lem, and the prohibition of street play by city ordinance in 
both cases adds still further to the difficulties which the prin- 
cipal must meet and solve as best he can. 
One of the problems, then, which every principal faces the 
first few days of school, is that of the organization of his 
playground so as to get a maximum of results with a mini- 
mum of difficulties. The pupils will want to get the games 
started from the first, and it is important that they should 
be started early and started right. In crowded schools with 
small playgrounds this presents difficulties which require 
careful planning in advance. Fortunately, in most schools, 
the new principal will find established traditions and ways of 
doing things. These old ways should be followed at first, un- 
less so fundamentally wrong as to warrant prohibiting them 
from the start, and changes should be made after there has
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
been time for the school to settle down and fewer other 
matters are demanding attention. 
The teachers and yard duty. In different schools one 
finds different practices as to teacher: participation in the 
school-ground activities. In some schools every teacher is 
expected to pass to the playground, with her class, and be on 
playground duty during the recess period. This gives more 
supervision than is needed, is not liked by either teachers or 
pupils, leaves the building unattended, and is unnecessary. 
In most schools only a few of the teachers are expected to be 
on the playgrounds, the others being allowed to remain in 
their rooms or the building. This is much better, as it dis- 
tributes the supervision over both building and grounds, 
gives teachers larger freedom, and tends toward freer yard 
play. 
In determining the division of yard duty, one of two plans 
is usually followed. One plan is to select the number of 
teachers needed from among those who know the games 
best and like the playground work, leaving those who by rea- 
son of age or inaptitude are not useful for playground work 
free to remain in the building. This plan often pleases all 
around, but it is questionable if it is the better plan. The other 
is to divide the school into details, under which the teachers 
either take turns for one- to two-week periods, or for certain 
days each week, and from one third to one fourth of the 
teachers being on the playground at any one time. 
For example, in the school yards shown in Figures 7 and 
8, where the common recess would be used and where the 
play space is ample and plenty of apparatus for play at 
hand, 4 of the 16 teachers in building 7, and 5 of the 24 
teachers in building 8 would probably be sufficient for any 
desirable playground supervision at any time. As a matter 
of fact, the school grounds shown in Figure 8 were supervised 
by four teachers, whose work was distributed as follows;
-P-A-G-E-135
  YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 119 
Grades I and II — All teachers came out with classes, and then 
all but one returned to rooms. The three teachers alternated 
in supervision, each serving one day in three. 
Grades III to VIII, girls — Five teachers, each taking supervi- 
sion but one day a week. 
Grades III and IV, boys— Three teachers, each taking super- 
vision one day in three. 
Grades V to VIII, boys— Under the principal, every day. 
The other form of detail is where the teachers are given 
assignments for longer periods of time, and then are relieved 
for atime. Under this plan the assignments are made out a 
term in advance, the whole assignment being reduced to a 
table or a chart, copies of which can be given the teachers 
and one posted in the principal’s office. Figure 11 (page 
121) shows one such chart, the assignments here having 
been arranged on the basis of shifting the teachers from one 
play-period to another, and from one part of the playground 
to another, so that each teacher may come to know the 
different play groups and they her. While the theory under- 
lying such rotating assignments is good, it might not be de- 
sirable in some schools to carry out the shifting of teachers 
so far as is indicated in Figure 11. Some teachers might 
work better with the boys than with the girls, or with the 
older children than with the little ones, and vice versa. 
Instead of such a long-term program, or rather as a sup- 
plement to it, some principals who have office clerks go still 
further and give each teacher a Daily Program and Assign- 
ment Card, of which the following is a sample:

Notices: 
November Science Outline begins. 
Monthly supply orders due Thursday. 
Monthly reports due Friday. 
Whatever form of detail is employed, and notice of such 
given, there should be a few teachers on the playground, for 
emergency purposes, at all times. The more the yard and 
building organization can be handled by the older pupils the 
less there will be for the teachers to do. In schools where 
double or triple recess periods are needed, a larger number of 
teachers will naturally need to be given assignments each 
day than where a single recess is the rule. 
Dividing off the play space. On a school ground that has 
been well organized and provided with play apparatus, a di- 
vision of the grounds for groups and sexes will nearly always 
have been made. This is well shown for the grounds of 
Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10, where spaces for boys, girls, and little 
children have been marked off. In school grounds such as 
are shown in Figures 5 and 6, sides will have been assigned, 
but in the organization of play work on such grounds a map- 
ping off of space will need to be made. Where the streets 
can be made use of they should be used for some of the 
games of the larger children, particularly the boys. 
In dividing off the playgrounds it is best to provide for the 
separation of the sexes, above the second or at most the 
third grade, though in small schools there are some games, 
such as blackman, that may be played together. Folk 
dancing may also be joined in by both sexes. It is also a 
good plan to divide the grounds still further, where space 
will permit, making the division by ages or grades, because 
of certain differences in play needs that manifest themselves 
in children of different*ages. These differences may be in- 
dicated roughly by the following groupings, and are also 
shown in the diagram on page 123,

  122 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Ages 5 to 8 — Children good imitators, individualists, and with 
little ability to codperate except under direction. Need sug- 
gestion and direction of teachers. Games involving largely 
individual action, such as sand box and building blocks, or 
slightly codperative ring games under the direction of the 
teacher or an older pupil-leader, make most appeal. Imita- 
tion, impersonation, imagination, repetition, and singing 
strong elements in games. 
Ages 8 to 10 — With girls the above characteristics last a little 
longer than with boys. By the third grade the boy has be- 
come a marked individualist, and games involving competi- 
tion, daring others, choosing sides, climbing, jumping, and run- 
ning, make strong appeals. The inclined ladder, swings, bars, 
ropes, the giant stride, and the slides are favorites with both 
sexes of these ages. Games involving muscular coérdination 
such as rope jumping, and sense judging such as marbles and 
top spinning, are also popular. Handling children of this 
group is difficult, because they tend to scatter so, their compe- 
tition being individual rather than group. It probably calls 
for more supervision and cheerfulness than any other period. 
Ages 10 to 12 — The preceding characteristics continue, but tend 
to pass over more into group competition. Tug-of-war, crack- 
the-whip, wrestling, boxing, and other rough games tend to be 
rather prominent with the boys, and need some control, while 
the girls take on some of the rough-and-tumble plays as well. 
Ages 12 to 16 or 17 —This is the early adolescent period and is 
marked, with both sexes, by the rise of an interest in team 
games under a leader, and codperative group play involving 
rules and organization, with strong loyalty to sides. Games 
which develop and challenge courage, endurance, self-control, 
bravery, and similar virtues, are favorites now, and can be 
used by supervisors with large educational results. Football, 
indoor baseball, bat-ball, basket-ball, cricket, volley-ball, and 
tennis now begin to make a strong appeal, and individual 
stunts where a side’s winnings are at stake are also of much im- 
portance. Group consciousness begins to arise, and a desire 
to manage things for themselves becomes evident. 
Apportioning the grounds and apparatus. Applying the 
above to the grounds of the Figure 8 school, we find the first 
two grades, boys and girls, assigned to the space between the

girls to the north, on the west side; the smaller boys east of 
the buildings and along the driveway; and the larger boys

further to the east. Interest can be kept at a little higher 
point by an occasional rotation of parts of these play spaces, 
so that the smaller grades may move about somewhat, and 
especially that third- and fourth-grade boys may use any 
apparatus suited to their age. 
This gives a free play space for the girls on the west lawn 
and to the north of the larger building, and for the boys to 
the east. The large baseball diamond and bleachers can be 
used by the little boys for play at intermissions, or for indoor 
baseball, as the large diamond cannot be used for regular 
baseball, because of the danger, except at stated times after 
school, on holidays, and when school and inter-school con- 
tests are scheduled. The volley-ball space, when not in use, 
is also open for free play. 
The indoor baseball, basket-ball, and volley-ball grounds 
will have to be apportioned out on a regular schedule to 
those who can use them, they being used by different groups 
on alternate days or periods. An organization can be ef- 
fected by an active principal, either himself or through his 
play teachers, working in codperation with the pupil leaders, 
whereby a series of plays, games, and competitive matches, 
varying with the seasons, can be provided for and scheduled 
for the parts of the grounds allotted to the older pupils. 
An open space for free play by both sexes, such as black- 
man, dare base, tag, etc., should be retained, and an open 
space where all may join in marching, drills, and calisthenic 
exercises should be retained where possible. Occasional use 
of such space by the whole school will prove profitable and 
interesting. A smooth space for folk dancing is also very 
useful. 
The small school grounds. When we pass from such 
large well-organized school grounds as are shown in Figures 
7 to 10 to such small and unequipped grounds as are shown in 
Figures 5 and 6, where there is no play apparatus, where the
-P-A-G-E-141
  YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 125 
play space is quite limited, and where, as in both cases, 
street play has been rather foolishly prohibited by city or- 
dinance, the problem of providing for the needed play be- 
comes a much more difficult one. 
At the recess periods, the double or triple recess helps 
solve some of the difficulties, as the limited grounds can 
then be made to do double duty, but in the mornings, at 
noons, and after school serious difficulties present them- 
selves. The basement play spaces and the inner first-floor 
hall can be used for some relief, and still further relief may 
have to be found by arranging different times for beginning 
and ending the sessions for parts of the school. If the city 
authorities could be induced to permit of roping off the 
streets at recesses and noons, and their use at such times for 
play spaces, it would remedy the matter somewhat. A traf-, 
fic squad of older boys and girls could be organized to help 
protect those at play, if street play were permitted. In any 
case some space, for both boys and girls, should be set apart 
for playing the organized games of the older pupils, and 
where group matches may be prepared for and played. Af- 
ter this, the remaining space must be apportioned off as can 
best be done. 
A satisfactory playground outfit. The provision of play- 
ground apparatus for a school ground seldom is made all at 
once. Usually the apparatus is obtained a piece at a time, 
and often pieces are made in the school shops and erected 
by the older pupils. We find playgrounds in all stages in 
the matter of equipment. Some of the playgrounds shown 
for the schools drawn in Figures 5 to 10 have even more 
equipment than is actually needed, while two of the schools 
have no equipment at all. As equipment usually comes a 
few pieces at a time, it may be well to list here the type of 
equipment an elementary school should aim to secure, 
This may be indicated as follows:
-P-A-G-E-142
  126 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
A sand court and shelter for the little ones. 
. A frame, carrying five or six swings. 
. Another frame, carrying five or six teeter ladders. 
. A single combination frame, or two or more shorter frames, 
carrying: ; 
Two inclined ladders, 
Two sliding poles, 
Two vaulting bars, 
One pair of flying rings, 
One hand swing, 
Two climbing poles. 
. Another frame, with four or five flying rings. 
One or two giant strides. 
. One or two ladder-and-incline slides. 
. Two indoor-baseball diamonds. 
. One or two volley-ball courts. 
. One or two basket-ball courts. BIE SOMDAAN 
A reference to Figure 12 will show the ages to which the dif- 
ferent sports make their chief appeal, and will help some- 
what in deciding what pieces of apparatus are most impor- 
tant when one cannot have all. 
Supplies, and use of grounds. The needed play supplies, 
such as baseballs, bats, basket-balls, and footballs, are now 
rather commonly supplied on requisition by the school de- 
partment, as are paper, ink, and books. Where this is not 
the case, and the board of education is not willing to assume 
the charge, the school may raise the needed funds by appeals 
to parents, citizens, athletic clubs, or by giving entertain- 
ments. Until such general provision can be made the pu- 
pils must be depended upon to furnish the needed equip- 
ment. ‘This latter plan is a little less desirable, as thereby 
some pupils are prevented from playing some of the games 
they could and would like to play. 
When supplies are furnished by the school department, or 
by the school itself, they must be kept under control in a 
special room or place, and checked out to the pupils or
-P-A-G-E-143
Bie . 
YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 127 
classes and checked back in return. This should not be a 
teacher’s job, except possibly in a small school or at the 
start. Instead, pupil storekeepers should be developed and 
trained to accountability. To allot a sufficient supply of 
commonly used play supplies to each classroom is a good 
plan, as the bats, balls, etc., can be taken into the classroom 
by pupils at the end of each intermission and carried out 
again when the pupils pass out for play. 
While it is not always possible of attainment, the ideal for 
school-ground use should be a neighborhood playground, 
open on school days from early morning until dark, on Sat- 
urdays at least, and on holidays and during the long sum- 
mer vacation. The grounds should be open for play both 
before and after school for a definite time, the length of the 
time to be extended as pupil control is built up or special 
play teachers are provided. If play teachers are provided 
the grounds should also be open at certain hours on Sun- 
days as well. The grounds where large enough should be 
the natural place for school and inter-school contests, and 
after school and on Saturdays is the natural time for such 
affairs. 
Supervising the play. What is wanted on the play- 
ground, in having some teachers always on hand, is organi- 
zation and proper supervision rather than any minute con- 
trol. Policing of the playground by the teachers will create 
plenty of disciplinary cases for the school to handle. What 
is needed, instead, is only so much supervision of the play as 
is necessary to teach the pupils the games, organize the ac- 
tivities, start things off well, and keep them running freely 
and smoothly. Too much organization, like standing in 
line and marching to commands, tends to defeat its purpose. 
As much freedom in play as can be used safely and intelli- 
gently is the desideratum. 
This supervision naturally differs somewhat with children  
-P-A-G-E-144
  128 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
of different ages. With the little ones the teacher must ini- 
tiate and assist and guide and keep interest going, and teach 
them how to play many simple games suited to their ages. 
The work will in great part consist in awakening a play 
spirit and developing a play habit. The middle groups are 
harder to handle, and must be allowed to follow much their 
own wishes, so long as this does not lead to what is harmful. 
The older pupils need starting and direction, but much less 
supervision, and the girls need more attention than do the 
boys. The teachers on duty need to be constantly on the 
watch to see that the play apparatus is not monopolized by 
a few, and that the games are kept open and inclusive and 
not confined to small groups to the exclusion of worthy pu- 
pils. When teams are formed in any game or group, they 
should receive no‘ more of the teacher’s time than an equal 
number of pupils not in the teams. This calls for tact 
and for a good understanding of human nature. Immo- 
rality, fighting, and too rough play of course call for inter- 
ference. 
Teachers who are to supervise play, and the principal in 
particular, need a sympathetic understanding of not only 
play and play possibilities, but also a quick and sympathetic 
insight into child character and motives. No better means 
for promoting good relationships with the pupils could be 
found than for the principal to attain the reputation of hay- 
ing a good understanding of plays and games, and of being a 
thoroughly good sport. For the same reason it is good for 
all teachers, on some days at least, to take part in the plays 
of their children. 
While the principal will have some general supervision of 
the whole playground, and will at times give attention to the 
play of the pupils, his work will naturally center with the 
play and games of the older boys of the school. He needs 
especially their respect and good will, as in any form of pu-
-P-A-G-E-145
  YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 129 
pil control or helpfulness he must depend largely on them 
for codperation and support. 
Advantages of good play organization. The building up 
among the pupils of the school of a good physical tone and a 
good school morale is one of the large returns that come from 
giving some attention to the organization of the play activi- 
ties of the school grounds. Few other things do as much as 
these same activities to transform the yard bully into a use- 
ful school citizen, bring out the timid and backward pupils, 
limit accidents, create good feeling, assist discipline, teach 
pupil self-control, train the muscles and the eye to codrdina- 
tion, or awaken the best spirit of the pupils. 
Indoor baseball and basket-ball and bat-ball, which are 
favorites among both boys and girls, are excellent develop- 
ers of the qualities needed for good citizenship. In the es- 
tablishment among the pupils of some such principles or 
tules of action as the following, formulated in the Seattle 
schools, the school playground is giving very valuable civic 
training. The Seattle school playground rules read as fol- 
lows: 
1. The rules are to be regarded as mutual agreements, the 
spirit or letter of which one should no sooner try to evade or 
break than one would any other agreement between gentle- 
men. The stealing of advantage in sport should be regarded 
in the same way as stealing of any other kind. 
* 2. No action is to be taken nor course of conduct pursued which 
would seem ungentlemanly or dishonorable if known to one’s 
opponent or the public. 
8. No advantages are to be sought over others except those in 
which the game is understood to show superiority. 
4. Officers and opponents are to be regarded and treated as hon- 
est in intention. When opponents are evidentiy not gentle- 
men, and officers are manifestly dishonest or incompetent, 
future relationships with them may be avoided. 
5. Decisions of officials are to be abided by, even when they seem 
unfair.
-P-A-G-E-146
  130 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
6. Ungentlemanly and unfair means are not to be used even 
when they are used by opponents. 
7. Good points in others should be appreciated and suitable 
recognition given. 
The transformation that has taken place in recent years, 
in these games, through the influence of the school play- 
ground, is wonderful. The corner-lot baseball game of a 
decade ago, with its constant quarreling, profanity, and__ 
gang groupings, has given way on the playground to a game 
of law and order. In all the organized games a fine point 
of contact between principal and teachers and pupils is 
established, and the ancient antagonism of youth chafing 
against teacher restraint disappears. In the development 
of team and school spirit, and the preparation for and plan- 
ning of contests, much fine feeling is awakened and much 
ugly disposition is worked off. 
Supervision at the lunch hour. There is a phase of build- 
ing and yard supervision, closely connected with the play- 
ground, that often is of much importance, and that is the su- 
pervision of the building and grounds during the time that 
the pupils are eating their lunch at noon. This is especially 
the case if many pupils eat their lunch at the building, and 
still more so if the school grounds have play apparatus. If 
not regulated, the tendency is for the pupils either to bolt 
down their lunch so as to get out early, or to take their 
lunch to a piece of play apparatus and then exercise the 
rights of squatter sovereignty on the piece of apparatus so 
preémpted. The grounds are also likely to have lunch 
débris left scattered over them. 
The proper supervision of the lunch hour calls for the de- 
tail of one or two teachers, the requirement that the pupils 
eat together, in one or two places, spend a definite time at 
their lunch, clean up all débris and put away their lunch 
boxes, and then pass to the playgrounds at a given signal. In
-P-A-G-E-147
  YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 131 
schools such as those shown in Figures 5 and 6 there is noth- 
ing to do but use a couple of classrooms, or possibly the base- 
ment playrooms. In the schools shown in Figures 8 and 10, 
however, much better arrangements have been made. In 
the Figure 8 school a common out-of-doors lunch place has 
been provided between the buildings and under the trees, 
and in bad weather the domestic science and manual train- 
ing rooms are used. Not many pupils at this school remain 
for lunch. In the Figure 10 school, which is in a city of 
some size and where a large number of pupils bring their 
lunch with them, two vine-covered arbors have been built 
in the yard for luncheon purposes in good weather, and 
in bad weather the auditorium is used. The roof play- 
grounds were used before the arbors were built by the boys, 
as a shop exercise. 
Tn ariy case some such rules as the following should be en- 
forced: i 
1. All who are to lunch at the building are to pass at dismissal 
to the lunching places. 
2. No one is to leave until the teacher in charge gives the signal, 
which is only given after inspection to see that all débris 
has been gathered up and is ready for proper disposal. 
Use pupil monitors for the oversight where possible. 
8. No one is to leave, even though through, except on permis- 
sion for emergencies, until after twenty minutes have elapsed. 
This gives time to eat leisurely, tends to prevent bolting 
down the food, and gives all an equal opportunity at the 
play apparatus. 
Where the school building is fortunate enough to have a 
school cafeteria, as some of our more recent buildings now 
do, the lunch problem can be handled in a still better way. 
Even where a cafeteria is not provided, and where no city 
lunch organization attempts to help the schools meet the 
lunch problem, the domestic science equipment can be used 
to provide at least one hot dish for those who remain for
-P-A-G-E-148
  132 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
lunch at the building. This plan is being adopted by an 
increasing number of elementary schools. The school- 
lunch problem in its hygienic aspects is, after all, really a 
part of the school-health problem, and city school systems 
are beginning to take it up and deal with it on that basis. 
In connection with the lunch hour, it might well be added 
here that it ought to be an unwritten. rule of every school 
that the principal and all teachers who lunch at the building 
and are not required for duty be expected to lunch together. 
If everything is going well this may not be important, but 
it prevents the formation of little groups and the growth of 
clannishness, promotes friendliness and understanding and 
sociability, helps smooth out many a wrinkle, and, if any- 
thing arises in the school system over which there is likely 
to be a sharp division of opinion, the common lunch under- 
standing will hold a group together that would otherwise 
break up into factions. ° 
2. Supervision of toilets and basements 
Toilets a strong influence. The maintenance of a good 
physical tone among the pupils, and keeping them inter- 
ested in school affairs which call for action and coéperation, 
will do much to head off that peculiar and difficult type of 
trouble one encounters in connection with the use of the 
school toilets. If plays and games are made of but small 
importance, if the activities of the school are not empha- 
sized, and if the pupils are allowed to stand around and loaf, 
trouble in the toilets is almost certain to develop, and trou- 
ble there is hard to handle. In such cases the toilets not 
infrequently become focal points for insubordination and 
vandalism, as well as for vulgarity, obscenity, smoking, and 
licentious practices. The proper supervision of the school 
toilets thus becomes an important feature of building super- 
vision. In a well-organized school, supplied with proper and
-P-A-G-E-149
  YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 133 
adequate sanitary appliances and in good condition, trouble 
from this source is much less common, but even here spo- 
radic outbreaks are likely to occur. 
Toilets are provided for a certain use, but not to become 
social centers for either sex. When so used, it is commonly 
the pupils whose morals are low and vulgar who hold forth. 
The toilets must be frequented by all, from the most modest 
to the most vulgar-minded, and it is part of the work of the 
school so to shape conditions and control that the toilets 
may be used only as they should and not become centers of 
moral contamination. 
Shaping conditions. One of the things that a new princi- 
pal should examine carefully, on taking charge of a school, 
is the toilet facilities of his school plant. These facilities 
should be as nearly adequate as possible, and in a clean and 
sanitary condition. Still more, they should be so built and 
finished that they may be kept in good condition easily, and 
if they are not, at the end of the year, in his lists of wants, he 
should request such reasonable changes as will make them 
easier to care for, both from a sanitary and a moral point of 
view. Good, light, well-ventilated rooms, supplied with a 
sufficient number of seats and urinals, and with plenty of toi- 
let paper, towels, running water, and liquid soap, give far 
less trouble than do the inferior and inadequate equipment so 
commonly found in the older type of school buildings. 
The toilets for the two sexes should, of course, be entirely 
separate, with no connecting passageway, and so set off 
that conversation will not carry over. The entrances 
should be from separate directions. The toilets should be 
light, well-ventilated, capable of being kept clean easily, and 
at some time of day should get sunshine. It is desirable 
that little children, those below Grade III, have separate 
places, but, as this is seldom provided, except in the newer 
and more modern-type buildings, it probably will be best
-P-A-G-E-150
  134 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
that they have a separate time for general use of the toilets 
unless the facilities are quite ample for all. , In any case, 
some lower seats or raised platforms might well be provided 
for their special use. In number there should be, for proper 
' equipment, approximately one urinal for every twenty boys, 
and one toilet seat for every fifteen girls and twenty-five 
boys. These numbers are based on a common recess, and 
need not be quite so large where pupils mostly go home for 
lunch, or where the double or triple recess is necessitated by 
playground conditions. The supervision is much easier 
where the toilets and urinals are banked around the walls, 
with openings facing out to a large central room, than where 
a double row of toilets, back to back, run down the middle 
of the room. Dividing partitions should not be over five 
feet high, both for light and for supervision, and the toilet 
doors should be cut away ten inches at the bottom. 
Use and supervision of the toilets. The free use of the 
toilets during school hours should be discouraged, where not 
necessitated by physical conditions, and teachers should, in 
general, not allow two pupils of the same sex to pass from 
the room to the toilets at the same time. Any long absence 
from the room should be noted by the teacher. In the first 
and second grades a greater freedom will have to be allowed. 
The recesses should be long enough, in good weather, to al- 
low for both a full use of the toilets and a good play, and pu- 
pils should be encouraged to go to the toilets first and then 
pass to the playground. Some principals send their pupils 
first to the basements, for use of toilets and drinking foun- 
tains, and then to the grounds. This is a very good plan if 
the school is not large, and if the basement and toilet space 
are ample, but it is not applicable to crowded-building con- 
ditions. 
A rapid inspection of the toilet rooms by the principal, 
preferably early in the morning, should be a part of his daily
-P-A-G-E-151
  YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 185 
routine of building inspection. This should be made to see 
that the janitor has done his cleaning properly, that supplies 
of all kinds are at hand, and that the conditions are right for 
the day. An occasional entry of the boys’ toilet during the 
day by the principal, and of the girls’ toilet by some woman 
teacher, serves as a desirable check on conditions. The jan- 
itor, if a man, should have as one of his important functions 
the oversight of the boys’ toilet room, and he should be on the 
quiet watch for the appearance of obscenity or vulgarity on 
the walls or about the room. Under the guise of brushing 
up, putting in supplies, and looking after sanitary condi- 
tions, an intelligent janitor can be of great help in prevent- 
ing loitering, smoking, obscene talk, writing, or carving, and 
the moral contamination of the many by the few of vulgar 
nature and often of low intelligence as well. In a similar 
manner, the girls’ toilet room needs a certain supervision. If 
there is a woman assistant to the janitor, she can assume 
the responsibility, but if not, some supervision by a rotation 
of the women teachers should be provided. The idea to be 
borne in mind is that of keeping the toilets clean and sani- 
tary, with no associations connected therewith to direct at- 
tention to bad habits, or conditions that would stimulate 
their development. 
Stopping trouble. The degree of trouble that will arise 
from toilet room sources will naturally vary much with the 
character of the neighborhood and the pupils, the degree of 
congestion, and the presence or lack of adequate facilities. 
In practically every school, though, some trouble will from 
time to time break out. While this is mostly confined to 
the boys between the third and seventh grades, and often 
comes from over-age pupils of lower mental ability, yet it is 
not wholly confined to these, nor to the boys alone. Some- 
times serious trouble arises on the girls’ side. 
A plan of spying out and catching and punishing the cul-
-P-A-G-E-152
  136 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
prits will hardly be effective. The more spying that is done, . 
the more ordinarily there will be to do, though there are 
times when catching a culprit will have a beneficial effect. 
This usually is when the evidence points to an individual, or 
a small group of individuals, as being guilty of some particu- 
larly indecent happening. Often this can be accomplished 
best by the janitor, sometimes necessitating a checking up of 
suspects after each use of facilities. In all such supervision, 
however, care should be taken that such work is not over- 
done, to the extent of drawing general attention to it. The 
supervisory work should be done as quietly and unostenta- 
tiously as possible, and with as little publicity of results as 
can be done. 
Tf a serious situation arises, with either sex, it is best to 
face the matter frankly at once. The principal can handle 
the boys, even though the principal be a woman, and some 
teacher, selected on the basis of wisdom and discretion, can 
take the situation in hand if it be with the girls. Call a 
meeting, without stating the purpose, and then face the is- 
sue quickly and frankly in a simple and direct talk. Tell 
them briefly the conditions that need remedying, that such 
conditions affect the reputation and standing of the whole 
school, that they would not want such conditions in their 
homes, and that the school is a big family and in a way a 
home. One may frankly state that it is not easy for the 
principal or teacher to watch for and catch the offenders, 
and that you do not intend to do so. That really it is up to 
them to stop it, and you appeal to their school pride and 
school morale not to tolerate such offenses from a few of 
their number. Accordingly you ask them to put a stop to 
it themselves, and that you will approve any reasonable 
punishment they see fit to inflict on those who continue to 
offend. One principal, of the writer’s acquaintance, con- 
fronted by a series of particularly dirty incidents which he
-P-A-G-E-153
YARD AND BUILDING ORGANIZATION 137 
could not locate, told the boys that if they caught the of- 
fenders and gave them a pounding or hosing he would ap- 
prove and protect them. Two boys stuck in a water trough, 
a few days later, ended the trouble. 
Handling through school organization and teaching. 
Proper supervision and control, here as elsewhere, are 
closely linked with the creation of a wholesome pride in the 
school, the activities of the institution, and the proper care 
of both building and grounds. School spirit and school 
morale are as effective agents in handling toilets and base- 
ments as in handling building activities and playgrounds, 
and should be the object of constructive effort on the part of 
the principal. Emphasis on those things that build up 
school spirit, encouragement of healthful play on the part of 
all, and the development of a school pride in building and 
grounds, all tend to foster a school morale conducive to 
proper conduct elsewhere. In the teaching of hygiene, sci- 
ence, and civics, opportunities are presented for construc- 
tive work along sanitary lines. 
The most effective means, though, lies in the development 
of a school civic league or codperative pupil control, 
through which school: and yard supervision is effected 
largely through the older pupils, and proper standards as to 
health, cleanliness, sanitation, and care of public property 
are built up. The supervision of toilets then would be but 
one specific example of this type of service. A committee of 
the boys and of the girls, or better still school police and 
school sanitary inspectors, can be organized to handle the 
whole problem in a quiet but effective manner. A word of 
warning from a pupil officer is far more effective than from 
ateacher. A strong social pressure, with a reasonable cer- 
tainty of punishment for continued offense, is now set up to 
put an end to practices which the pupils themselves have 
come to condemn. As will be pointed out in a later chap-  
-P-A-G-E-154
  138 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ter, some such form of organization, though requiring work 
to start and care in handling, is nevertheless one of the most 
effective means not only for control but for teaching a prac- 
tical form of civics that can be devised. The pupils learn 
virtue and citizenship by practicing them. 
The basement. Where there are basement playrooms for 
hot weather, wet weather, or winter play use, the same prin- 
ciples of play supervision would apply as for the grounds. 
Much depends on the space available, but ordinarily it will 
be too cramped to provide for a common recess or any 
games requiring much space. In hot weather the space 
may be used by the little children. For wet or cold weather, 
games which do not require much space, in which some can 
play and others watch, should be chosen. In schools such 
as are shown in Figure 10, where the entire roof is a covered 
playground, hot- and wet-weather conditions do not offer 
any particular difficulties. 
Into the janitor’s quarters, in the basement, the pupils 
should not go. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. What, in your judgment, is the best plan for yard supervision? Why 
do you think so? 
2. Show how you would distribute your teachers for playground su- 
pervision, in the case of building 6, where a triple recess is neces- 
sary, and how many would you need to use at recesses and noons * 
and mornings? 
3. Do you think the arrangements made for yard duty, given for the 
school shown in Figure 9, were good? 
4, Suppose that the school board furnished all play supplies, how would 
you arrange for their care, and for checking them in and out? 
5. Arrange the play spaces for each of the schools shown in Figures 5 to 
10, including double or triple recess periods and different times for be- 
ginning and closing schools for Figures 5 and 6. 
6. What plans would you suggest for use of the toilets in the buildings 
shown in Figures 5 and 6? How would you supervise their use in 
these buildings? 
7. Was it a good plan for the principal, described on page 109, to turn the 
discipline for toilet obscenity over to the pupils to handle? Why?

  F CHAPTER VIII 
THE CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 
The principal and the problem. A steady increase in the 
number of school children to be provided with seating ac- 
commodations is a common condition in our American cit- 
ies. Often the increase in population is so rapid that the in- 
crease in school attendance comes faster than is expected or 
than buildings can be arranged for and built. Since the 
World War, and the general halt in schoolhouse construc- 
tion occasioned thereby, hundreds of American cities find 
themselves with totally inadequate seating accommoda- 
tions. In consequence, principals of schools, superintend- 
ents of instruction, and boards of education alike find 
themselves hard pressed to care for the needs of the pupils 
who present themselves for schooling, and all kinds of tem- 
porary makeshifts are employed to provide some semblance 
of schoolroom facilities. 
Where the problem is a general one, facing a city as a 
whole, it is largely for the central school officers to solve 
rather than for the individual principal, but even then it is 
well for the school principal to have some ideas as to how he 
might handle the problem, and thus be able to work inde- 
pendently in case he is thrown on his own resources, by the 
central office, in the rush period of the opening days of 
school. Even though the central office should ultimately 
decide just what is to be done, it is well for the principal to 
have thought out what might be done and be able to offer 
some helpful and constructive suggestions. The superin- 
tendent and his assistants are almost certain to be extremely 
busy during the opening days of the school year, and any in- 
telligent superintendent is glad to receive helpful sugges-
-P-A-G-E-157
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 141 
tions for the solution of the practical problems which daily 
arise. Every superintendent knows the principal who 
dumps his problems at the superintendent’s feet and offers 
no suggestions — often has no ideas — as to their solution. 
It is not his business to think them out; he exists only to 
execute orders. Such men are often exasperating, and such 
principals are seldom singled out for promotion. It is the 
man who studies the problems of his superiors and comes to 
know what they know, who, given the proper personality, is 
usually selected for advancement. 
Solutions for the crowded-building problem. Fortunate 
indeed is the principal these days who has a building with a 
few extra rooms, as the constant increase in the number of 
pupils is one of the problems with which principals almost 
everywhere have to contend. A principal is wise, too, who 
anticipates not only an increase in numbers but also what 
grades will be most crowded, and who so arranges his room- 
distribution that he has a place ready for any overflow. 
To illustrate, one principal of the author’s acquaintance, 
who had two vacant rooms in his building, concluded from 
walking through his district a few days before school opened 
that the new families had mostly little children and that the 
crowding would be in the kindergarten and the first and 
second grades. He then so distributed his teachers that he 
left one vacant room near the first-grade room, and one near 
the second. The first morning 112 children came who were 
classified as first-graders. By temporarily putting two 
rather small upper grades together under one teacher, and 
using the teacher thus freed to help temporarily with the 
little ones, and himself helping, the situation was tided over 
until the afternoon, when a substitute teacher arrived, and 
thus to the next morning when a second teacher was ob- 
tained. 
Most principals, though, have little or no space in which
-P-A-G-E-158
bas 142 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
to fit out new rooms, and, should the school be crowded on 
the opening day, they must resort to some one or other of the 
following plans: 
1. Shift the district lines, with the consent of the superintendent, 
and transfer some pupils of the crowded grades to other schools 
having vacant seating space. This can often be done with 
the older pupils, who can walk longer distances, but is not 
a feasible plan for the little children. 
2. Secure the so-called “‘portable buildings” and set them up in 
the schoolyard, or in adjoining vacant lots which the school 
department may lease. 
8. Use vacant storerooms, or even residences, if any are available 
near by. Z 
4, Use the auditorium or the gymnasium, if there be such, for 
classroom purposes. 
5. Put the teachers of the younger children on a part-time plan 
— that is, give the first-grade and possibly the second-grade 
teacher two classes, one in the morning and one in the after- 
noon, such children attending school only half the day. Two 
different teachers may be provided instead, as the central 
office may decide. 
6. Reorganize the instruction in the school in such a way that 
the building will be made to carry a larger load of children. 
While any one of these plans naturally requires the con- 
sent of the superintendent of schools, the principal should 
nevertheless have considered what he might do and how he 
would do it in advance of the situation itself. He is not then 
taken off his feet by the condition which develops, as he has 
gone through such a problem already in his thinking and is 
ready with a solution as soon as it presents itself. 
The advantage of securing a preliminary “Room and 
Grade Classification Report” (Chapter V) as early as possi- 
ble in the morning will now be apparent. By ten o’clock the 
principal should know the exact nature of the problem he 
faces, and be ready to report it to the superintendent’s of- 
fice. If he can solve it himself without incurring any serious

School C, a large school, has two seventh grades and room for but one eighth, but there are forty-six eighth-grade pupils, indicated by dots, residing in the district. Schools B and E and F can each take a few more eighth-grade pupils. By drawing in the district lines for eighth-grade pupils, two will be transferred to school B, five to school D, and four to school F, thus reducing the number to thirty-five, which can be cared for. Similarly, the two sixth- grade rooms have some vacant seats, whereas the one sixth-grade in schools B and E have too many pupils. By expanding the district lines for sixth-grade pupils, seven sixth-grade pupils from district B, and six from E, indicated by crosses, may be provided with seats and instruction in school C. 
ecutive. capacity are insight into problems and the willing- 
ness to undertake their solution. : 
Shifting the district lines. The shifting of the district 
lines, with the consequent transfer of a few pupils to some 
neighboring school, is often an easy solution, as Figure 13 
shows. This drawing shows a large school which has two 
seventh grades, and too many pupils for one eighth grade 
and not enough for two. By spotting the residences of the
-P-A-G-E-160
  144 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
eighth-grade pupils on a street map of the district it is seen 
to be possible to move enough to adjacent schools, which 
telephonic inquiry had shown to have vacant seats, to re- 
lieve entirely the eighth-grade congestion. The school also 
has some vacant seats in its three sixth grades, whereas 
schools B and E report too many sixth-grade pupils. By 
shifting the lines for the sixth grade also all may now be 
provided with seats. 
Such a plan for solving congestion should ordinarily, not 
be employed by a principal, unless in the case of a few pu- 
pils who will agree to move voluntarily, without the consent 
of the superintendent, as such transfers not infrequently 
waken serious protest from the parents of the children so 
transferred. Parents like a particular school, their other 
children are there, and they do not like a split-school alle- 
giance and the longer distance some of their children will 
have to travel. Often the argument advanced for opposing 
the change is weak, but the opposition awakened by such 
transfers is frequently strong. Sometimes volunteers can 
be found who will make the transfer, but often the transfers 
have to be made in the face of protests. 
In making the transfers the principal and the teachers 
should take care to smooth out the situation as much as pos- 
sible. Say little about the transfers in advance of taking ac- 
tion, and when action is taken carefully explain to the pu- 
pils the necessity for it, point out that the schools are city 
schools and that all the children of the city are to be consid- 
ered, and ask them, as a matter of good citizenship and loy- 
alty to public interest, to go and do their best to fit into the 
new school and be happy there. As school loyalty and ath- 
letic rivalry often enter as factors, say that the school re- 
grets their loss, but that they will strengthen the teams of 
the schools to which they go, and if, in the new teams, they 
can come back and squarely defeat their old school, that the
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 145 
school will be proud of them and will take its punishment 
without a whimper. 
Using portables and renting rooms. Often such a shifting 
of lines cannot be accomplished, either due to popular oppo- 
sition or to lack of room in other schools. In such a case 
some other expedient has to be adopted. A very common 
solution, in such a case, is to set up the so-called “portable 
buildings” in the school yard, or on some adjacent empty 
lot which can be leased, or to rent vacant storerooms or resi- 
dences in the immediate neighborhood and fit up school- 
rooms in them. The school is then reorganized to fit the 
new conditions, and the makeshift arrangement can usually 
be made to last a year. The portables, though, nearly al- 
ways become permanent, and, if yard space permits, are 
added to from year to year. Figure 6 shows such a condi- 
tion well, where a school yard having but 107 square feet per 
pupil has had a row of six portables installed in the yard, 
trees having been removed to make place for them. Some- 
times an empty storeroom some distance away has to be 
rented, one or two classes of younger children installed, and 
a branch school established there. A number of problems, 
involving the employment of such expedients, are given at 
the close of this chapter. 
The portable buildings, very often, are in their interior ar- 
rangements not particularly objectionable. They are built 
according to good schoolroom specifications, are thoroughly 
sanitary, and are well lighted and heated, though in warm 
weather they are likely to be hot and on very cold days cold. 
The chief objection to them is rather in their outward ap- 
pearance, the space they take from the playground, and, if 
on vacant lots a little removed or across the street, in their 
separation from the other children of the school. It is best 
to use these portables for the little children, whose plays are 
different and who do not so much miss contact with other 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
children, or else for special work, such as domestic science or 
manual training. 
Part-time instruction. The provision of part-time in- 
struction is another solution. It does not fill up the school 
yard with portables, but in other respects does not offer so 
satisfactory a solution. The essential idea of the plan is to 
put two classes, each attending only a half-day (three hours) 
in each classroom, and thus make each room so needed 
carry a double shift of pupils. Generally only the little 
children — first or first and second grades — are so ar- 
ranged for, but in some of our crowded cities entire or al- 
most entire schools are working on the part-time or half- 
day plan. The classes so divided come in two sections, one 
in the mornings from 9 to 12, and the other in the afternoons 
from 1 to 4. This can be made to answer fairly well for 
first-grade children, and tolerably well for second-grade pu- 
pils, but for the older children the school hours must be 
lengthened or the instruction is insufficient. 
Quite commonly one teacher teaches both classes, and is 
given extra pay for the longer hours. It makes a long day, 
though, for the teacher, and is a hard nervous strain. | If a 
teacher is provided for each shift it is much better, but 
school boards often object to the full double pay, and with- 
out full pay the teachers do not like the plan. This, how- 
ever, is a detail that is settled at the superintendent’s office, 
and which the principal must accept as it is. 
There is usually little objection from the-parents of the 
little children who can come in the morning section, but usu- 
ally much from the parents of those who have to attend in 
the afternoon. 
Other expedients to increase the carrying load. The use 
of the auditorium stage, the gymnasium, the school library 
room, and the fitting up of rooms in the basement for class 
use are other expedients not infrequently used to tide over
-P-A-G-E-163
  
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 147 
situations. None of these is very satisfactory, but one is 
sometimes forced to employ them. The erection of port- 
ables offers a far more satisfactory solution than any of 
these expedients, because the portable is a room adapted 
to instruction, and the expedients mentioned above seldom 
are. 
Another plan, which the tendencies of the past half cen- 
tury have been against, but which has begun to find some 
favor again since the building shortage has become so pro- 
nounced and the cost for schools has risen so markedly, is to 
increase the number of pupils per room by putting in more 
seats. Until recently the tendency has been to reduce classes 
to 30 or 35 pupils, but some recent studies have seemed to 
show that good teachers can carry classes of 40 to 45, if pu- 
pils are properly classified into working groups, with about 
as good results, measured in instruction, as though the 
classes were smaller. Some contend that it is more eco- 
nomical to employ good teachers at good salaries and in- 
crease the size of the classes up to 40 to 45 children for grades 
2 to 6 inclusive, with a somewhat smaller number in first, 
seventh, and eighth grades. Where the size of the rooms 
and the quality of the teacher will permit, a classroom could 
be seated to carry 6 X 7 = 42 children, instead of 5 X 6 = 30, 
or 5X7=35. Some of our larger cities, in their recent 
building programs, have fixed on 40 to 42 children for their 
classrooms in grades 1 to 6 inclusive. The Batavia plan, of 
which much has been written by its few advocates, has been 
based on putting 50 to 75 children in a classroom, with a 
second capable teacher added whenever the number ex- 
ceeds 50, and half the time being given to supervised pupil- 
study under the direction of the teacher or teachers. 
Building reorganization to increase the carrying load. 
Another solution not infrequently employed, within recent 
years, is that of increasing the carrying load of the building
-P-A-G-E-164
  148 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
by reorganizing the instruction, rather than by merely in- 
creasing the number of seats in the classrooms. This plan, 
where the character of the building makes its employment 
possible, is much to be preferred because it enables the 
building to carry a larger pupil load without increasing the 
burdens of the individual teacher. There are two main 
forms for this reorganization, one of which moves the 
teacher with her class and does not involve the specializa- 
tion of teachers, and the other moves the classes from 
teacher to teacher, and involves more or less specialization of 
teaching work. Combinations of the two plans are possible 
to any degree desired, but only the two types will be consid- 
ered here. The first form we will term the companion-class 
plan, in which both teacher and pupils move from room to 
room without specialization of teachers. The facilities for 
instruction are specialized, but the teachers are not. The 
second form, commonly known as the platoon school, in- 
volves the specialization of teachers as well as facilities for 
instruction. 
The companion-class plan. This plan calls for the least 
specialization of facilities and the smallest withdrawal of 
classrooms from regular instruction to be fitted up as special 
rooms. The essentials of this form of school reorganization 
can be seen at a glance from the drawing given in Figure 14. 
In the first place a small number of the regular classrooms 
are withdrawn from regular class use and are fitted up as 
special rooms. Let us take the school shown in Figure 5 to 
illustrate the plan. This is a fourteen classroom old-style 
building, carrying the eight grades and organized on the 
straight grade plan. The building has two fairly satisfac- 
tory playrooms in the basement, and two buildings in the 
yard for domestic science and manual training. Of the 
fourteen classrooms we will need to take three for special 
purposes, to be fitted up for class work in drawing, music,
-P-A-G-E-165
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 149 
and science. This leaves eleven classrooms, which may 
now be made to carry two separate schools of eleven classes 
each, which we will designate as an A school and a B school.

By dividing the day into fourteen equal periods, and having 
the B school begin and close two periods later than the A 
school, it is possible to get the use of the eleven classrooms in 
the building, for each of the schools (A and B), for a total of 
nine of the fourteen periods of each day. Of the remaining
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
five periods, three are spent in the special rooms, and the re- 
maining two on the playground or in the indoor playrooms 
in supervised play. How this can be done is well shown in 
Figure 14, on page 149. Under such an arrangement, 
this building could be made to carry 22 classes instead of 
14, or, at an average of 34 to the room as at present, 748 
pupils. instead of 475. The plan would also, by doing 
away with the common recess, put fewer pupils on the 
playground at any one time, a part of the noon hour ex- 
cepted, than under the grade plan now in use. 
Under the companion-class plan as commonly used there 
is a teacher for each class, or in this case there would be 22 
teachers for the school, not counting manual training or 
domestic science teachers. Each of these teachers moves 
with her class, teaching the drill work in the regular class- 
rooms, the special work in the special rooms, and the plays 
and games in the playrooms or on the playground. It is in 
reality a grade-school plan of organization, with a shift plan 
introduced to vacate the regular classrooms five fourteenths 
of the day, so as to make possible the addition of a second or 
B school to the building. A more detailed program for such 
a school will be given in the chapter which follows. If in- 
stead of such a straight-grade organization, as is described, 
we begin to specialize the teachers and the instruction, the 
plan shades into the platoon plan. 
The platoon plan. The essentials of the platoon plan, as 
before, lie in the setting aside of a certain number of class- 
rooms to be fitted up as special rooms, in which only in- 
struction in the special subjects will be given, and the or- 
ganization of a double school (A and B) for the building. If 
both schools begin and dismiss at the same time, morning, 
noon, and afternoon, a larger number of special rooms will 
need to be fitted up than if the hours are different, as shown 
in Figure 14 for the companion-class plan, The plan works
-P-A-G-E-167
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 151 
best in a school where, after withdrawing rooms to be fitted 
up as special rooms, at least eight to ten classrooms are left 
for regular work with the A and B schools. There will or- 
dinarily need to be special rooms for music, drawing, sci- 
ence, literature, manual training, and domestic science. If 
the beginning and closing hours are different, the literature 
room can be eliminated and this work done in the regular 
class periods, thus adding two more classes to the number 
the building may be made to carry. The auditorium is a 
very useful addition to the list of special rooms, and is a ne- 
cessity in a good form of the platoon system. Two small in- 
door playrooms or gymnasia are also very desirable, to be 
used in place of the playground for supervised play and 
physical training in bad weather. 
The school is then divided into two schools, which are 
perhaps best called the A and B schools, though X and Y 
schools, and Alpha and Beta schools are terms also used. 
The instruction is then so arranged that when one school is 
using the regular classrooms the other school is using the 
special rooms, laboratories, playgrounds, gymnasium, or 
the assembly hall, and these two schools alternate twice 
during the day in the use of the school facilities. The day 
is lengthened somewhat to give more time for the special in- 
struction, though the time actually spent in the classrooms 
is decreased. Roughly the plan would be somewhat as fol- 
lows:

2.00 to 3.30 Special work Class work 
Applying the platoon plan to an old-type building. How 
this plan of organizing the school into two platoons would
-P-A-G-E-168
  152 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
increase the carrying load of a building may be illustrated 
by selecting three of the buildings shown in Figures 5 
to 10. 
We will first take the building shown in Figure 7. This 
building now has 16 classrooms on the two main floors, and 
two small indoor playrooms as well as two special rooms for 
manual training and domestic science in the basement. It 
has no assembly hall, however. The building now has seats 
for 560 children, or an average of 35 seatstoaroom. There 
are eight grades and a kindergarten in the building, there be- 
ing three teachers for the first grade, two for each grade from 
second to sixth inclusive, and one each for the seventh and 
eighth grades. The work in the kindergarten and the first 
grade is well connected. The sixth, seventh, and eighth 
grades are organized on the departmental plan. 
To reorganize this school to make the building carry a 
larger load we would first set off the kindergarten and the 
two first grades, since the work of the two is so well inte- 
grated, and in addition we would set off one more room to 
carry the additional first-grade pupils who would come in 
under the platoon plan. This leaves twelve classrooms. 
We would next take four more classrooms to be fitted up as 
rooms for special instruction — one each for drawing, music, 
science, and literature. In each of these rooms the ordinary 
furniture may be left, if necessary for economy; but it is 
much better to replace this by music racks, tables, and arm- 
chairs. In these rooms each class would be taught as one 
section. The school has no auditorium, so auditorium work 
could not be included. While it is possible to schedule the 
work without an auditorium, by increasing the number of 
classes at play, still, to show the plan better, we will assume 
that a regular “portable” is erected on the northeast cor- 
ner of the school yard for use as an auditorium. 
This leaves eight classrooms, which can now be made to
-P-A-G-E-169
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 153 
do double duty and carry two schools, an A school and a 
B school, which will alternate in the use of the classrooms. 
This would be 16 classes. Adding now the three first-grade 
rooms and the kindergarten, gives a total of 20 classes 
as against 16 before, or a gain of 140 pupils in the carrying 
load of the building secured by the platoon-type .reorganiza- 
tion. 
How program such a school. A detailed program for 
such a school will be given in the chapter which follows. 
Here we will merely indicate the general plan for such a re- 
organization. Roughly this would be, taking a fifth-grade 
class (see Table 3, p. 171) as an example: 
Prriops A Scoot B Scuoon 8.80 to 10.00 Class. Reading Special Auditorium work Arithmetic work Supervised play Penmanship { Drawing (2 days) Recess time Music (8 days) 10.00 to 11.80 Special Auditorium Class Recess time work Gymnasium work Reading Drawing (2 days) Arithmetic Music (8 days) Penmanship

2,00to 3.80 Special —_Literature Class Recess time 
work { Geography (3 days) work Reading Science (2 days) Arithmetic Manual training (B) Language 
Sewing (G) Spelling 
Other classes would have a somewhat similar program. 
In carrying out such a plan two classes or rooms would be 
on the playground at once, and two in the playrooms. In 
the auditorium and literature rooms there would be one 
class each; one each, on alternate days, in the music or draw- 
ing room; and one in the science, or in the domestic science 
(girls) or manual training (boys) rooms. 
The classes would then be distributed as follows, taking 
the first period of the day as an illustration: ~“

secured by erecting another portable in the yard, each 
school (A and B) could be made to carry 9 classes, or a 
total of 18 instead of 16 classes, thus adding 70 more pu- 
pils to the school. This could be accomplished by sending 
two classes to the auditorium each period instead of one. 
Each school would then carry 9 classes and 315 pupils. 
Applying the platoon plan to a modern building. If in- 
stead of taking the building shown in Figure 7, we take 
the much more modern building shown in Figure 9, the 
platoon plan is much easier of application. 
Leaving out the kindergarten room and the two rooms for 
the first grades, we have nine regular classrooms. Whether 
the first grades shall be left out or included in the platoon 
plan depends much on the relation of their instruction to the 
kindergarten work below. If the connection is close they 
should be left out; if there is little connection they may be 
included. We will assume here that the connection is close 
and leave them out. The high basement already contains 
a gymnasium, and special rooms for manual training, sci- 
ence instruction, and domestic science. The school has a 
good auditorium on the first floor. Taking one of the class- 
rooms for a music room, one for a drawing room, and one for
-P-A-G-E-171
  
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 155 
a literature room, and using the basement rooms as before, 
we have six regular classrooms left. Putting in an A anda 
B school gives 12 classes. With the kindergarten and the 
two first-grade classes this gives 15, as against 12 under the 
old plan. At 35 pupils to the class this is a clear gain of 105 
pupils after providing well for special rooms. If the two 
first grades were included in the platoon plan, two addi- 
tional classes could be accommodated, adding 70 pupils 
more. 
The weekly distribution of classes then would be (see 
Table 7, p. 180) taking the first period of the day as an illus- 
tration:

6 classrooms, at 35 pupils each one room (3 days) 35 il

Manual training (B) (2 days) 35 “ 
Domestic science (G) ( é Dax 
Total g210 “ Music room (3 days) 
In such a building as is shown in Figure 10 the plan is still 
easier to carry out, as the building has more special rooms. 
Leaving four rooms for kindergarten and first grades, and 
one for an ungraded or special room, still leaves 19 regular 
classrooms. The school has an auditorium, two roof play- 
grounds for hot or wet weather use, and special rooms for 
manual training, domestic science, music, drawing and art, 
and science. Taking one more for a literature room leaves 
18 regular classrooms. At 35 pupils to the room, the carry- 
ing load of the building with 24 classrooms is 840 children; 
under the platoon plan of 18 classes each, and 35 pupils to 
the class, the same building will have a carrying capacity of 
1260 pupils, or 630 pupils in each of the two platoon schools. 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  156 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Adding kindergarten and first grades, at the same number 
per room, will add 140 more pupils, or a total of 1400 pupils 
when organized as a platoon school, as against 840 as a 
grade-type school. 
The distribution of classes in the Figure 10 school, when 
organized on the platoon plan, would be about as follows:

Administrative details to be considered. In any platoon- 
Plan form of organization certain administrative details 
need to be considered and provided for. These relate to 
cloakrooms, books, attendance, special rooms, recesses, and 
similar items. 
In new buildings built for the platoon plan, special lockers 
and cloakracks are usually built in the basement or along 
the first-floor walls to provide space for the books and wraps 
of all pupils attending the school, but in old buildings this is 
usually an expense neither desirable or possible. Instead, 
either the existing cloakrooms are made to carry a double 
load of hooks and spaces for wraps, or racks are added in the 
hallways, if wide enough, or in basement space, to carry 
the extra pupil wraps. As for books, box racks having 70 
to 80 spaces are usually erected in the classrooms, and each 
pupil then has a box space, with name on it, for his or her 
books and supplies. 
Regular desk equipment can be used in the special rooms, 
but in buildings erected for platoon use special equipment is
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  CROWDED-BUILDING PROBLEM 157 
provided in the form of long music benches, tilted drawing 
stands, flat science tables, and armchairs for the literature 
room. While these are very nice, they are not a necessity. 
The attendance of pupils is cared for in various ways, the 
most common plan being to have the first teacher of each 
main division of the school record attendance, both morning 
and afternoon. 
Usually a short recess of ten minutes is given at the end or 
the beginning of each classroom period, but sometimes the 
play activities take the place of the regular recesses and only 
a short period (2-3 minutes) for passing is allowed. As will 
be seen from the detailed programs given in the following 
chapter, the recesses of the two schools do not come to- 
gether. 
The platoon plan provides a six-hour day, not counting 
the noon intermission, which is long for teachers, though usu- 
ally considered as compensated for by the relief that comes 
from the specialization of work. In most of our large city 
schools using the plan the actual teaching work is reduced 
to five hours by the employment of so-called “relief teach- 
ers,”’ one for every five regular classes, and these are then so 
assigned and move about as to give every regular teacher 
one free hour each day. In the program calculated out in 
the following chapter a still more liberal allowance is made 
by having each teacher teach but three of the four main 
periods of the day, or a total of four and a half hours. This 
requires the addition of one relief teacher for every four 
classes, or a number slightly higher than is usually pro- 
vided. Under the 1 to 5 plan there is a slight saving in 
teachers; under the 1 to 4 plan, the same number of teachers 
is required as for grade work. 
Educational advantages of the plan. Whether or not the 
platoon plan is to be applied to any school building involves 
questions of administrative policy which must be settled by 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
158 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the superintendent’s office, but in some of our cities, not us- 
ing the plan generally, individual principals have been per- 
mitted to experiment with the plan and to make the neces- 
sary reorganization of their schools. The educational ad- 
vantages which the platoon school is believed to offer may 
be summarized briefly, as follows: 
10. 
hy 
12. 
13. . A larger carrying load for a given building. 
. A more constant use of the whole school plant, and particu- 
larly beneficial use of the assembly hall, gymnasia, and play- 
grounds. 
. Addition of specialized instruction in what are often regarded 
as extras — music, drawing, science, school gardening, domes- 
tic arts, manual training, shop work, and directed play — and 
without prohibitory costs. 
. The introduction of play and auditorium activities as inte- 
gral parts of the course of study. 
. Special emphasis on the work in literature with a view to its 
cultural value. 
. Provision for pupils of a school day more varied, more intense, 
and more interesting. . Experience shows that the pupils do 
not become as fatigued as when they sit in classrooms for long 
sessions. 
. The partial specialization of the work of the classroom teach- 
ers, and to a still greater extent the work of the special-activi- 
ties teachers. . 
. A great reduction in the need for special-subject supervisors. 
Economies in the cost for building, and for general and special 
supervision. 
The pupils gain from the different contacts, get the best froma 
number of teachers, and the exceptional child advances more 
easily. 
The assembly-hall period can be made a distinct addition to 
the social side of school work, as will be shown in a later chap- 
ter. (Chapter XVII) 
The opportunities for the socialization and Americanization of 
the pupils are greatly increased. 
Physical training under direction and supervised play take 
the place of the old-fashioned pell-mell recess, with its conges- 
tion and its disciplinary problems.

14. Class discipline is easier because the pupils do not become rest- 
less from long sitting. 
It is these advantages which have caused many thought- 
ful educators to give serious consideration recently to the 
platoon-type school. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1, Suppose that the school shown in Figure 5 becomes badly crowded, 
there being 180 pupils beyond the seating capacity for the school. As- 
sume also that it is possible to install six portables on a quarter of a 
block of rented ground to the east and rear, and that the congestion is 
. solved in this manner. Show a distribution of classes in the school be- 
fore, and after the increased enrollment has been cared for by the use of 
the six portables. 
2. Make a grade-and-room distribution for the school shown in Figure 6, 
and show how you would rearrange matters if 60 pupils beyond capac- 
ity appeared, and the board gave you two more portables for use in 
the yard. 
8. Suppose, in the above case, you had 100 excess pupils, no more port- 
ables were provided, and any reorganization of instruction did not 
seem advisable. Instead, part-time instruction became necessary. 
How would you then rearrange your school? 
4. Under the same conditions as above, how would you rearrange your 
school in case the excess amounted to 200 pupils? 
5. Instead of reorganizing the school shown in Figure 5 as a companion- 
class school, as described in the text, work out a platoon type of organ- 
ization for it and show its possibilities, assuming the use of the lower 
central hall for assembly-hall purposes, the pupils either standing or sit- 
ting on the floor at assembly periods. 
6. Instead of reorganizing the school shown in Figure 7 as a platoon- 
type school, as described in the text, reorganize it as a companion- 
class school after the plan of Figure 14. How would you then arrange 
it, and what would then be its carrying capacity? 
7. Point out the many advantages of such a building as is shown in 
Figure 10, for any type of school organization. 
8. What type of educational organization will use the building shown 
in Figure 7 to the best advantage? What form the building shown 
in Figure 10? Why, in each case? 
9. Arrange the different types of school organization, discussed in this 
chapter, in the order of the degree of skill required to organize, admin- 
ister, and supervise the instruction in the school, and give reasons for 
the order you indicate. 
10. What type of educational organization is most likely to provide a rich 
and stimulating atmosphere in the school? Why?

CHAPTER IX 
PROGRAM-MAKING 
Different types of programs. One of the problems of organ- 
ization which every principal, old or new, must look after 
early in his work is that of the programs for daily work of 
: the different teachers in his building. The extent to which 
he will need to give attention to this phase of school organi- 
zation will be determined somewhat by the type of regula- 
tions as to time allotments and program-making in force in 
the city in which he is at work, and the type of educational 
organization found in his school. In many cities, general 
regulations covering the details of program-making are is- 
sued for all grades, and these prescribe the maximum and 
the minimum time-allotments by grades and subjects. Ina 
few cities quite uniform time-allotments and program-types 
.are enforced. On the other hand, there are many cities 
which leave such matters largely to the judgment of the 
principal, recognizing that conditions vary much as between 
schools and even from time to time within the same school. 
If the principal is in a town school where there is no superin- 
tendent over him, he will then naturally have to formulate 
his own plans and make his own requirements. 
The type of programs to be formulated for a school will 
vary somewhat not only with the character of the pupils and 
teachers and neighborhood, but also with the peculiar de- 
mands of the building and grounds. If a double or a triple 
recess is necessitated by conditions, the principal must plan 
his time schedules accordingly, and may even need to ar- 
range his opening hour in the morning and at noon slightly 
differently for the different grades of pupils. If his school is
-P-A-G-E-179
PROGRAM-MAKING 163 
crowded and he has part of the pupils on part-time, this will 
necessitate still different types of programs. 
Still more, the types of programs the principal will need to 
use will vary with the type of educational organization ex- 
isting in the school or the city. If the school is organized as 
a straight eight-grade elementary school, a quite simple type 
_of program will be required., If the upper grades are or- 
ganized on the departmental plan, a different type of pro- 
gram will need to be employed for these grades. If the 
school is organized on the 6-3 plan, a still different arrange- - 
ment will need to be effected. If the school uses some spe- 
cial type of educational organization, such as the Batavia 
plan, the promotion-by-subjects plan, the companion-elass 
plan, the platoon plan, or a highly organized Gary plan, still 
other types of programs will need to be employed. The 
more complex the plan of organization the more minutely 
will the principal need to supervise and apprové the work 
of program-making. 
Principles in program-making. In any case, though, the 
principal will need to look after the matter of the programs 
of his teachers if for no other purpose than to see that they 
conform with regulations, provide properly for the special 
work, and are properly organized and proportioned. He 
ought to do more than this, even in simple grade-type 
schools. He should be able to help his teachers to formu- 
late their programs in more scientific form than many of the 
teachers would themselves be able alone todo. At the same 
time he must avoid rigid prescription in opposition to the 
judgment of a teacher, or any unreasonable insistence on 
what is after all only his own point of view. 
In the first place, it is a good plan to let the more experi- 
enced teachers make their own room programs, the princi- 
pal reserving his help at first chiefly for the new teachers. 
For beginners it probably will be best to provide them at the 
>
-P-A-G-E-180
164 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
start with a prepared program to be used at least until they 
are able to make a better one. By the beginning of the sec- 
ond week of the term, or by its close at latest, every teacher i 
should have determined on her daily program and sub- . 
mitted it to the principal for his files and his approval. In 
the case of experienced teachers programs should not be 
disapproved or changed except for good cause, and then 
only after consultation with the teacher concerned. 
In the making of programs, or the approving of programs 
submitted, the principal should work with*certain construc- 
tive ideas in mind. He must of course see that the allotted 
times figure out correctly, that the recesses and dismissals 
come as they should, that schedules do not conflict with as- 
sembly periods, that the maximum and minimum time al- 
lotments prescribed are not exceeded, that the work to be 
supervised by special teachers comes in proper rotation so 
far as is possible, and that the number of periods for each 
subject per week are as they should be. In addition the fol- 
lowing principles ought to find embodiment, so far as can 
be done, in the permanent programs: 
1. After the opening exercises should come one of the more diffi- 
cult subjects, and preferably the one that is hardest for the 
teacher to teach. 
2. Subjects similar in character, such as writing and drawing, 
phonics and word study, reading and literature, should not 
ordinarily follow one another. 
8. Similarly, subjects in which the school is taught a as a whole 
should not follow one another, some sectional subject coming 
in between. 
4. Subjects requiring good muscular control, such as writing or 
drawing, should not immediately follow a recess period. 
5. Class work in physical training should not either just precede 
or immediately follow a recess. x 
6. Subjects which require the use of special material, such as 
drawing or science, should come when such special material 
can be taken care of with the least waste of time. If special
-P-A-G-E-181
  
  PROGRAM-MAKING 165 
rooms are to be used, then conflict between classes in the use 
of rooms must be avoided. 
7. Something of a balance should be retained between the work 
of the morning and that of the afternoon, not all the easier 
subjects being placed in the afternoon, though the more ex- 
acting subjects may well come in the morning. 
8. A heavy or an exacting subject, or one requiring physical ac- © 
tivity, should not be placed immediately after lunch. 
9. Subjects requiring close mental work should alternate, where 
possible, with subjects requiring motor activity. 
10. Study periods with a teacher should not immediately precede 
recitation periods in that subject, as this plan tends to pre- 
vent the formation of habits of independent thought. 
11. The number of subjects per day, and the time given each 
subject should vary with the grade periods, becoming longer 
as the children grow older. Recitation periods in the first 
grade should not ordinarily exceed fifteen minutes, in the sec- 
ond grade not over twenty minutes, in the third and fourth 
grades not over twenty-five minutes, in the fifth grade not 
over thirty minutes, in the sixth grade not over thirty-five 
minutes, and in the seventh and eighth grades not over forty- 
five to fifty minutes. 
12. If the work of special teachers must be provided for, the sub- 
jects they supervise should be arranged, sc far as can be done, 
that they can visit the classes in rotation on the days or half- 
days they visit the school for supervision, and thus avoid dis- 
arranging the school programs the days they visit the school. 
13. The degree of flexibility and variability in a program may 
very properly vary with the experience and ability of the 
teacher concerned. ; 
Special supervisors and the programs. The presence of 
supervisors of special subjects in the school system, who 
visit the schools at stated times for the purposes of supervi- 
sion of the work of the regular teachers in their subjects, of- 
ten offers difficulties in the matter of program-making to the 
principal of a school organized on the grade plan. While at 
first thought it would seem that am experienced teacher 
should be permitted to organize her program as she wished, 
if proper program standards were met, this cannot always
-P-A-G-E-182
166 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
be done if the traveling supervisors must be provided for so 
that they can do their work in the most economical manner 
possible. If there are three or four such special supervisors, 
the principal may have some difficulty in arranging satis- 
factory programs and at the same time satisfying his room 
teachers. The special teachers feel that their work is highly 
important, and resent it if their work is not properly ar- 
ranged for. The regular teachers, on the other hand, have 
their preferences as to times and order of work. It is not 
possible for the special teachers to come at times that will 
* best suit the room teachers, either, as they usually must 
confine their work to a half-day visit to the building. 
Some concessions by the regular teachers will probably 
have to be made, and the principal will have to secure these 
on a give-and-take basis, and try to secure the best codpera- 
tion possible on the part of all concerned. He and his teach- 
ers must realize that the special supervisors have some 
rights in the matter, and the special supervisors must also 
recognize that the programs cannot be framed with their 
needs alone in mind. In grades organized on the depart- 
mental plan these difficulties largely disappear, while under 
the platoon type, where the special work is done by teachers 
in the school, the problem solves itself. Often no complete 
program arrangement satisfactory to all can be made, and 
the best plan will be to make programs that are satisfactory 
to the school, and then change them on the days when the 
special teachers come for their work. 
Program standards. A number of studies of time allot- 
ments and distribution have been made in recent years, and 
these show very wide variations in the time given different 
school subjects. Other studies have revealed that excessive 
time given to a subject seldom gives returns in learning 
which warrant the longer time involved. Other studies of 
school fatigue have shown that the quantity and quality of
-P-A-G-E-183
  PROGRAM-MAKING 167 
work done by pupils at different times of the day vary much 
less than has been commonly supposed. Results at the 
close of afternoon sessions, under good conditions of school 
hygiene, have been about as good as in the morning. Asa 
result of these studies there has been a growing tendency, 
within recent years, to approach more uniform standards in 
time allotments, and to give less attention to subject fatigue 
as related to time of day. Accordingly many of our school 
systems have recently issued maximum and minimum time 
schedules, or a common time schedule with maximum and 
minimum variations from this stated. On pages 168 and 
169 we reproduce two pages of a time schedule arranged 
on the latter plan, as issued by one of our larger American 
cities, and which may be taken to represent good present- 
day practice in the matter of time distribution. The rules 
governing the use of these time-distribution tables are 
printed under them. 
Using such tables as guides, teachers can work out pro- 
grams for temporary use and, when refined, for approval by 
the principal. The eventual program should be made out 
on printed cards, about 8 X 9 inches in size, and somewhat af- 
ter the form shown in Table III, one copy to be given to the 
principal for reference and filing in his office, and one copy 
to be fastened to the outside of the room door. A copy of 
the program should also be written on the room blackboard. 
As worked out for the fifth grade in a grade-teacher-system 
school, the program given on page 171 would result. 
Departmental type programs. The time distribution by 
grades and the program just worked out for the fifth grade 
represent the simplest type of program to construct. With 
a time-distribution sheet as a guide, such programs, except 
in the case of beginners, should be left to the teachers to 
formulate, the work of the principal being supervisory to see 
that conflicts in the use of rooms or special facilitiés are

1. The above time allotments have been worked out to cover the 
needs of the present course of study, and in schools having no 
exceptional conditions may be considered as approximately 
the proper proportional distribution. 
Variations from the above may be permitted, to adjust to 
time schedules or to meet special conditions and needs, with 
the consent of the principal, to an extent of not over 25 per 
cent with short-period a and 20 is cent with long- 
period classes. 
The recess periods must not be cut down, or the total school 
time lengthened. In schools in which the upper grades are 
organized on the departmental plan, two full hours of instruc- 
tion in the afternoon will, however, be permitted for these 
grades, bo s

4. The opening morning exercises in the first grade should be 
i used to put before the school the thought for the day, and in 
the other primary grades for a somewhat similar purpose. 
Talks, songs, poems, reports by pupils, or an experiment may 
-be used. In the grammar grades the time may, with the con- 
sent of the principal, be used for other purposes. 
5. In Word Study, Reading, Language in the first and grammar 
grades, Geography and History in the last two grades in which 
these subjects are taught, and in Mathematics, it is assumed 
that there will ordinarily be two sections or classes in each 
room. In other subjects the room will work as a whole. 
6. In the common or one-section work, with mixed grades, take 
the work assigned to the higher section. 
7. Boys in the grammar gradesgo to work in Manual Training 
at the same time that the girls go to their work in the 
Household Arts, so that both boys and girls have the full 
time indicated each week.

avoided, that time allotments are not exceeded, and that 
good principles in program-making are employed. This 
simple type of program would apply to such a simple school 
organization as is found in the building shown in Figure 5, 
which has only the eight grades, or in Figure 7, which has 
only a kindergarten and a straight eight-grade educational 
organization. 
For the other buildings shown in Figures 5 to 10, a more 
complex educational organization exists and must be pro- 
vided for. These will be: 
Figure 9. Kindergarten; grades 1-5 on grade-organization plan; 
grades 6-8 on a departmental plan, but with special 
rooms sufficient to permit of the reorganization of 
the school as a platoon school. 
Figures 6 Kindergarten; 6-3 plan, the three upper grades being 
and 8. organized as a junior high school. 
Figure 10. Same, but so equipped with special rooms that it 
could be reorganized as a platoon school or as a full 
Gary-type school. 
The building shown in Figure 9 will illustrate the depart- 
mental type of program. This building has twelve class- 
rooms, all in use, an auditorium, gymnasium, and two spe- 
cially equipped rooms in the basement. The classroom 
distribution for this building is: kindergarten; grades 1 to 5 
on a grade form of organization, with seven teachers; and 
grades 6 to 8 organized on the departmental plan, with four 
teachers. $ : ‘ : 
The seven grade-organization-type teachers will have 
programs of the simple grade types, as shown on page 171, 
and can arrange their periods with some freedom, but the 
four departmental teachers must rotate their pupils at the 
same times, and must also divide the teaching subjects be- 
tween them. The departmental program must then be di- 
vided into four main periods, approximately equal in length 
for morning and for afternoon, at the end of each of which

172 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the pupils move to another room and teacher, finally return- 
ing to their “home rooms” just before disrnissal in the after- 
noon. The program must then be organized about these 
four major movements, and will be approximately as shown 
in Table IV, on the opposite page. 
From this program it will be seen how the departmental 
plan specializes the work of the teachers. In this program 
each teacher looks after her opening exercises and gives the 
ten minutes of physical training required. Aside from 
these there is no common work. Teachers A and C divide 
the reading and literature between them; teacher A teaches 
the history and penmanship; teacher B the mathematics, 
drawing, and science; teacher C the geography, music, and 
the hygiene and civics; and teacher D the composition and 
language, and the spelling and work study. The manual 
training, domestic science, and sewing are taught by special 
teachers, who spend one day each week at the school. 
Other special-type programs. The buildings shown in 
Figures 6 and 8 will call for much the same type of organiza- 
tion, the first six grades in each being organized on the 
straight grade plan, and grades 7 to 9 being organized on a 
departmental plan as a junior high school. If some differ- 
entiation in courses is allowed in the latter a somewhat more 
flexible program is called for, so as to permit of a choice be- 
tween certain studies. Promotion in junior high schools, 
too, not infrequently takes place by subjects instead of by 
grades, and if this is to be done programs must also be ar- 
ranged with possibilities for some choice or variation as to 
studies, without conflict as to time. 
The common plan for dealing with elementary-school pu- 
pils who get ahead or behind in certain subjects in their 
grade is to employ the ungraded room, or the special coach 
teacher, either to bring the pupil up to the grade in the sub- 
ject or subjects in which he is behind, or to prepare him for

  174 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
a special promotion to a higher grade. This carries pupils 
along rather uniformly, makes grade organization easier to 
handle from the administrative end, and makes the transfer 
of pupils from school to school easier of accomplishment. 
Occasionally, however, one finds an elementary-school prin- 
cipal, and sometimes even a school system, where the idea 
of individual progress is carried to the extreme of promotion 
throughout by individual subjects, with the resulting mix- 
ing of pupils for.recitation purposes by sending them to re- 
cite, in each subject, to the grade where they most properly 
belong. 
Such a plan calls for a common recitation time for all the 
important school subjects, such as language, arithmetic, 
history, geography, reading, and drawing, so that pupils. 
may pass from room to room at the recitation periods, and 
recite in the grade to which they are assigned. Otherwise 
the programs are of the grade-room type. 
The companion-class and the platoon-type programs. 
When we pass to these types of programs a much more com-” 
plicated problem in program-making presents itself to the 
principal for solution. There are now two schools to be 
cared for, an A anda B school. The pupils now pass from 
room to room, and in consequence conflicts in the use of the 
school’s facilities must be looked after with care. In the 
strictly companion-class type of organization, the teachers” 
move with the classes from room to room and from room to_ 
playground. They. are in reality moving class or grade 
teachers. The difficulty then that presents itself is that of 
keeping the classes from conflicting in the use of the special 
rooms. This type of organization is shown in Figure 14. 
As the arrangement of a schedule for the use of rooms and 
playground is so similar to that found in the platoon schools, 
we will pass directly to a consideration of the platoon-type 
programs.
-P-A-G-E-191
  PROGRAM-MAKING 1%5 
In the platoon-type school, program-making becomes 
still more difficult. The teachers no longer move with their 
classes, in the pure platoon type, but are selected and classi- 
fied for special types of work and their room distribution is 
relatively easy. Some overlapping of work and some “fill- 
ing-in”’ teaching is almost inevitable, however, to provide 
for the needs of all the classes. One difficulty that presents 
itself lies in the proper scheduling of the work of the relief 
teachers, as any one teacher seldom teaches the whole of the 
six-hour day. The greatest difficulty lies in the scheduling 
of the use of the special rooms to avoid conflicts in the use of 
the special facilities. This calls for even more care in ar- 
ranging the program when the two schools‘(A and B) begin 
and close at the same time than when different opening and 
closing hours are taken, as in the companion-class plan 
shown in Figure 14. 
The chief difficulties encountered. The chief difficulties 
in platoon-type program-making can be illustrated by tak- 
ing the school shown in Figure 9, and using the platoon or- 
ganization for this school, as described in the precéding 
chapter (page 154). The platoon organization here involves 
grades 2 to 8 inclusive. Assuming that no teacher will be 
expected to teach more than three of the four major periods 
of the day (43 of the 6 hours the school is in session), this will 
call for 8 classroom teachers and 8 special teachers, whose 
distribution will be shown in Table V._ The first thing to be 
worked out, in preparing a program for such a school, is the 
class programs. These are given for the school in Table VI. 
At first these will have to be in tentative form, and must 
next be transferred onto a room-distribution program, as 
shown in Table VII, and the necessary adjustments and 
corrections made. 
In making the room-distribution table (VII) care must be 
taken to keep the same relative order for the classes in the

  PROGRAM-MAKING 177 
different shifts, as may be seen by looking over the table 
given. In the literature-room assignments, for instance, 
the assignments for the auditorium periods are just reversed, 
morning going to afternoon, and vice versa. Next the 
three divisions of each main period are each changed in or- 
der in the same way; to get the gymnasium assigr ments, the 
gymnasium periods find their complement in science. Then 
one more change in order .in each period and the combina- 
tion shown in the drawing and music periods is produced, 
and this in turn is reversed to secure the assignments for 
manual training, sewing, and domestic science. The secret 
of making such a program is the following of a fixed order of 
assignments and changes; any guesswork placing will lead 
to conflict after conflict. The final results are shown in 
Tables V, VI, and VII. If the school were larger, as is the 
school shown in Figure 10, the plan would be much the 
same, except that two or more classes would now go to the 
auditorium, gymnasium, and play at once, instead of one, 
and more special teachers and rooms would be required. A 
complete program for the Figure 10 school, similar to one 
given for the Figure 9 school, could be constructed by follow- 
ing the plan just outlined. 
In a platoon-type school the principal must be responsi- 
ble for the organization of the school and the working out of 
the program. The class teachers merely work out their 
class period time-distributions, so as to provide for section 
work, recesses, and a proper distribution for each hour and a 
half period. This is a relatively easy thing to do. The pro- 
gram,'too, must be ready in advance of the opening of school, 
and should be ready for distribution in printed form, at the 
preliminary teachers’ meeting, so that each teacher may 
know the arrangement and distribution of her work. 
The weekly class and room programs for the Figure 9 
school are given on the following pages.

  THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
. Assume, for the school shown in Figure 5, that the first two grades are 
part-time double-session grades, and that it is necessary to arrange 
matters so that the kindergarten and grades one and two, grades three 
to five, and grades six to eight shall have different recess periods. 
Show how you would arrange the program. 
. Using Tables I and II for seventh- and eighth-grade studies, and as- 
suming mathematics, general science, English, and an option between 
a language and a vocational subject for the ninth-grade studies, con- 
struct a departmental-type program for grades seven to nine, or the 
junior high school, of the school shown in Figure 8, assuming four 
teachers for the three grades. 
Using the same time schedules as are given in Tables I and II, and as- 
suming a school managed on the promotion by subject plan, as de- 
scribed on page 174, show how you would arrange the school programs 
to carry out this idea, and to embrace as many of the principles stated 
on pages 164-165 as possible. 
. Calculate costs for the twelve-class platoon-type school shown in Fig- 
ure 9, as described in this and the previous chapter, and show whether 
or not it will cost more or less to conduct the school as a platoon-type 
school than to care for an equal number of children under a grade- 
school type of organization. Estimate also the educational efficiency 
of the two types of school organization. 
. Outline a program for a platoon-type school in the building shown in 
Figure 10, calculating the number and types of teachers needed and 
work out a room and class distribution for this 36-class platoon-type 
school. 
. Calculate costs, as in problem 4, for the two types of schools for Figure 
10, as indicated in problem 5. 
. Which type of school adapts itself best to the platoon type of educa- 
tional organization, a large or a small school, and a school with few 
special rooms or with many?

THE ADMINISTRATION OF A SCHOOL

  CHAPTER X 
BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
1. The office and its work 
The principal and office routine. In Chapter III (page 51) 
we gave a daily program which one principal worked out for 
his own guidance and emancipation, and pointed out a num- 
ber of means for saving time and getting routine work done. 
It ought to be possible for any principal working without 
much clerical assistance, and in a city not afflicted with an 
excess of central-office regulations and red tape or an inordi- 
nate amount of report work, similarly to free himself from 
the pressure of office duties and gain time for the real work 
of school supervision. What was said there need not be re- 
peated here, but instead certain additional points in business 
organization and management will be considered. 
A certain amount of office work is inevitable and must be 
handled. This naturally will be greater in some school sys- 
tems than in others, much depending on the type of adminis- 
tration imposed on the schools by the central office. The 
question is how to handle routine work expeditiously and 
satisfactorily. Much will depend on the principal himself, 
his habits of work, his conception of the position, his ability 
as an organizer and systematizer, his sense of proportion, 
his mastery of the details of his work, and his ability to work 
through others. His capacity for getting work done will 
also be in part determined by the facilities at his disposal to 
expedite his work, such as a satisfactory office, desks, filing 
cabinets, typewriter, duplicator,-good signal system, good 
blank forms, and above all, if the system can afford it, a 
good office clerk.
-P-A-G-E-202
  186 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
System and the man. In the great majority of schools 
and school systems the principal must work without the as- 
sistance of an office clerk. If he then is to secure adequate 
time for the real purpose of his presence — that of high- 
grade professional supervision and school leadership — he 
-must find ways of cutting through the administrative rou- 
tine and getting done the many little time-consuming but 
after all mediocre tasks that come up for handling in every 
school. One often hears a principal say that he simply can’t 
find time for supervision, helping his teachers, or keeping 
abreast of his profession, because of the pressure of adminis- 
trative details that cannot wait, such as pupil cases, seeing 
parents, answering the telephone, discipline, records, sup- 
plies, reports, forms, and sundry routine matters, and with- 
out an office clerk to carry these duties real supervision is 
with him impossible. 
These duties no doubt cut down greatly the time avail- 
able for supervision, and if given encouragement will iake all 
‘of it, but they are not insurmountable. The introduction 
of system will do much to help find time for the more im- 
portant duties, but other factors are involved besides the 
lack of system. Some men, due to certain personal limita- 
tions, such as lack of a time-sense or a sense of values and 
proportion, could not operate a good system were it devised 
for them. A, for example, treats all cases as about of equal 
value, gives too much time to individuals, and is always be- 
hind in his work and his engagements. B has such an exag- 
gerated idea as to form, neatness, promptness, and accuracy 
that the mechanical phases of his work keep him tied to his 
office desk. C feels so personally responsible for every- 
thing that he tries to do everything himself, and never clears 
the way for really big things. D, who could organize and 
do better, chafes so under the necessity of the mechanical 
work of his office that he spends his time and energy in con-
-P-A-G-E-203
BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 187 
demnation of the system and wishing for different condi- 
tions, instead of working out a scheme of things that will 
lead to his emancipation. The trouble with E is that he is 
as yet so little the master of his work that he does not 
see beyond the minor and more pressing problems of his 
situation. 
The school without an office clerk. In aschool where the 
principal must handle all the office details himself, keep his 
own records, write his own letters, compile his own reports, 
care for the stock room, answer the telephone, and see pu- 
pils and parents, the task is hopeless without good system, 
if any real supervision is to be done. The principal must 
adopt some workable scheme for economizing time and 
working quickly. He must also expect to remain at his 
building and work after school hours. If he trusts to chance 
he is almost certain gradually to become an office principal 
and be forever busy with letters, reports, supplies, pupils, 
the telephone, and the minute details of his work. 
The first thing to do then, as soon as the principal gets his 
schoo! started in the autumn and sees the run of the work, 
assuming him to be new to the position, is to draw up a 
tentative working schedule of work, somewhat after the 
plan of the one given in Form ‘1, page 51. If the principal 
finds that the program cannot be followed, even when he 
conserves his time, he should readjust the program to a more 
workable basis. He must keep in mind, though, that the chief 
“lifficulty will liein keeping to his program rather than in mak- 
ing it, and that if he is to save time for important work he 
must try hard to follow his program rather than readjust it. 
The more he allows the details and office work to run over 
their allotted time the more they will continue to run over. 
It is better to try to reorganize the work, and to find means 
of getting through the details more rapidly. It is true that 
any working schedule will be upset from time to time by un-
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
expected happenings or special occasions. In such situations 
the schedule will of course have to be temporarily set aside. 
The merit of the schedule will be that as soon as the inter- 
ruption passes the principal may turn to the thing that 
should be done next, rather than starting in in a haphazard 
manner on anything he may happen to think of, or wasting 
time trying to decide where to begin or what to do. 
Classifying duties and organizing a working schedule. 
The duties of every principal naturally classify themselves 
under: — (1) regular duties, that is duties which must be 
looked after every day; and (2) those occasional duties 
which come up irregularly or only at stated intervals, 
These'may be arranged, somewhat as follows: 
I. Recuiar Dutizs. L 
1. Early arrival at school building. (8.00) 
2. Morning inspection of building and grounds. This should 
be done early, before teachers and pupils arrive. (8.05- 
8.15) 
8. Hasty glance over office, desk, program for day’s work, 
and any list of things to be done or attended to. Fill in 
time with any minor detail work at hand. (8.15-8.35) 
4. Teachers and pupils arriving, and possibly parents. Time 
best spent in the hallways or near front or office door, 
where cases can be attended to standing, and time saved. 
This is no, time for the principal to go into his office 
with callers and sit down. Assembling of school. (8:35 - 
9.00) 
5. Morning assembly of pupils, if there be an assembly hal)\ 
that will accommodate the school. (9.00-9.10) + 
6. Short period’at office, seeing pupils sent there by teachers, 
receiving reports as to attendance, starting attendance of- 
ficer on his work, doing necessary telephoning to central 
office, and glancing hastily over office mail for anything of 
special importance. (9.15-9.30) 
%. School supervision, giving the best hours of the day to the 
work. (9.30-11.45) 
8. Minor office work, — tardy reports, fill out and file super- 
vision records. (11.45 - 12.00)  
-P-A-G-E-205
  
  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 189 
Noon Hour 
9. Same as No.4 in morning, moving about building and 
grounds, overseeing conditions, and settling minor mat- 
ters with quick decisions. (12.40- 1.00) 
10. Short office period for pupil cases, “good-work” inter- 
views, afternoon attendance records, attention to mail, 
and filling out reports and records demanded by system. 
(1.00 - 2.00) 
11. School supervision; on stated days principals’ meetings. 
(2.00 -3.00) 
Note: Numbers 10 and 11 to alternate as necessary, so 
as to cover supervision of work from 1.00-2.00. 
12. Office Hour, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. An- 
nounce office hours “ from 3.00,” so as to get business in 
promptly, and fill in all vacant time to 4.00 with routine 
work, such as records, reports, requisitions, letters, mem- 
oranda filings, etc. (3.00-4.00) 
Teachers’ Meetings on alternate Tuesdays; Parent- 
Teacher Meetings on alternate Thursdays. 
_ 18. Clean up office work, arrange bulletin board, plan coming 
day’s work, and leave by 4.15 to 4.30. 
II, Occastonan Dutizs. 
1. Special conferences and disciplinary cases. 
2. Checking up the supply room, and ordering supplies. 
S, Special monthly and term reports. 
|. Meetings of parent-teacher, pupil organizations, and 
neighborhood clubs. 
5. Special problems in school organization and the supervi- 
sion of instruction. 
From such a list it will be seen that a working schedule 
-can be prepared, once a school is under way, which will 
leave the principal, working without an office clerk, from 
three to three and a half hours, on most days of the week, 
for the work of school supervision and such other important 
duties in connection with the progress of pupils through the 
school as may need attention. A principal who has a good 
office clerk ought to find still more. By organization and 
" system the principal who really wants to do so may shake

himself partially free from the much magnified clerical and 
office demands, and be able to devote his powers, on most 
school days, to the educational problems connected with the 
instruction in his school. There will come times, naturally, 
when a principal may have to spend a half-day or even a 
whole day consecutively at his desk, because some impor- 
tant problem may need to be worked out before other mat- 
ters dependent on it can proceed. Most big problems, 
though, should be thought out and planned away from the 
interruptions of the office. 
Minor schemes for saving time. To carry out such a 
working schedule the principal must resolve to cut himself 
loose from clerical duties by minimizing their importance, 
attending to them after hours, and making time by cutting 
off all unnecessary wastes and drains on his time. Teachers 
should be asked and expected to do everything of a clerical 
nature pertaining to the work of their room or class that they 
_ can possibly do. ‘Train teachers to assume responsibility, 
and to handle minor matters themselves. Notes from pu- 
pils’ homes can be handled by the classroom teachers, when 
regular, and sent to the office only when office approval is 
needed and at times when the principal is likely to be there. 
Clear instructions given teachers, at the teachers’ meetings 
early in the year, can be made to save much office time. 
Teachers should be trained not to expect to find the princi- 
pal in his office except at the hours stated, and should not 
refer matters or pupils to the office except at these hours. 
In special emergencies a pupil may be sent to find the prin- 
cipal, or the signal for the principal may be sounded on the 
gong. The issuing of supplies and textbooks should take 
place only at stated times, or may be placed in charge of the 
janitor, who will file the charge and credit slips and see that 
they are properly made out. 
A pull-gong signal system, by which a loud gong, centrally
-P-A-G-E-207
  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 191 
located, may be pulled to give signals, is a very desirable ad- 
dition to a school’s equipment, and can be made into a time- 
saver. By the gong should be a card giving the signal code, 
such as: 
EmerceEncy SIGNALs 
1 stroke, Janitor wanted 
2 strokes, Principal wanted 
8 strokes, Medical Officer (or School Nurse) arriving 
Another good device is a bulletin board, upon which is 
placed the daily registration sheet for teachers, and all spe- 
cial and general notices of interest or importance to teach- 
ers. Notices which all teachers should read should be so 
indicated, a pencil on a string be near, and all teachers, on 
reading, be expected to pencil their initials beneath the no- 
tice. A mail box for each teacher and for the janitor, just 
outside the general office door, is also another good device. 
Into this all mail or instructions for teachers or janitor may 
be placed, including also circulars, report forms, returned 
pupils’ notes, and any material to be distributed. Teachers 
may call for these, or the janitor or a pupil may distribute at 
some fixed time each day. Pupils in the manual training 
work can make the bulletin board and mail boxes if the 
school does not have them. 
The school with an office clerk. Only the larger schools - 
may be expected to be provided with an office clerk, but 
where such a helper is provided she can be made very useful. 
In a school of a dozen to fifteen teachers a clerk ought to be 
provided, beginning with those schools where there are prin- 
cipals who can use a clerk to the best advantage and gradu- 
ally extending the plan. She can handle the supply room, 
deal with many pupil cases, get rid of callers the principal 
should not waste time on, answer the inquiries of many par- 
ents and make engagements for the principal with others, 
answer the telephone, reply to much of the mail, make and
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
file records, fill out requisitions, compile many of the school 
reports, execute many directions from the principal as to 
work or people to call up and see, remind the principal of 
things to be done in case he forgets, and manage the office 
and answer inquiries in his absence. Of course the larger 
the school the more there will be to be done, but with a good 
clerk on the one hand and a principal who knows how to use 
helpers on the other, the principal ought on an average to 
give sixty per cent of the time the school is in session to edu- 
cational and supervisory work. 
Office hours. A principal needs to have some definite of- 
fice hours to systematize the calls of parents. These hours 
can be posted in the lower hall where all can see, be printed 
on a little card to be enclosed in notes when a call is desired, 
be printed on his letter heads, and otherwise be made gener- 
ally known. Some such plan as the following will be good 
for all but the larger schools: 
Daily — 8.40 to 9.00, (In hallways or office. D) 
Se — 12.40 to 1.00, (In ce 
- M.W.F.— 3.00 to 4.00, (In office.) 
In all conferences it is important that the principal meet 
parents pleasantly, but that he expedite business as much as 
possible. Some callers — for instance a wrathy parent — 
will have to be heard through, but most cases can aud 
should be heard and decided quickly. How rapidly the 
principal can handle people will depend somewhat on the 
ways and habits of the community itself. In a city people 
are used to rapid action, but in small places, where time is 
worth less, people are not used to being handled rapidly and 
sometimes resent it if not permitted to talk themselves out. 
The principal then must learn to size up people and situa- 
tions quickly and plan ways for getting through without 
giving offense. If there is an office clerk, make liberal use of 
her by giving directions, and having the parent explain de-
-P-A-G-E-209
  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 193 
tails to her. If there are a number of people waiting, it may 
be wise to sort out the short cases first. If there is likely to 
be anything disagreeable in an interview, train the clerk, at a 
certain signal, to take notes of what is said. With a copy of 
the conversation, by'a reliable witness, there is little danger 
of being caught in an unpleasant situation without adequate 
defense. : 
One of the most wasteful features of the office hour, to 
most young principals and to many older ones, is that of 
keeping busy when no visitors are about. It is relatively 
easy to spend the vacant time in musing, walking about, or 
looking out of the window. This is an unnecessary waste. 
A desk nearly always has something on it waiting for atten- 
tion, and these odd minutes can be made very useful. One 
of the best devices is to jot down on a card work to be done, 
or have two or three classified cards, or a little note book, 
and then keep these before one as one works. Some days 
there may be little to do, and on other days a dozen or more 
little things. As each is attended to, scratch it off. When 
all are done throw away the card; if one or two remain, 
transfer to a new card and start over the next day. In this 
way it is relatively easy to utilize moments that would other- 
wise be lost. Such an organization of details helps im- 
mensely in office work as well. One cannot regulate the time 
of callers, but the plan should be to have plenty of fill-up 
work to put in time on. One can accomplish much in odd 
moments if he sorts out and saves up for them those little 
details and odd jobs which do not require careful or contin- 
uous thinking, and which may be dropped anywhere and 
taken up again easily. ; 
2. Supplies and the storeroom 
Types of supplies required. The rules and regulations of 
boards of education commonly hold the principal responsi-
-P-A-G-E-210
  194 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ble for the ordering and care of the needed school supplies 
and the equipment of his school, and the superintendent's 
office, to a greater or lesser degree, holds him responsible for 
their proper and economical use. The supplies used about 
a school may be classified under a number of heads, some- 
what as follows: 
1. Janitor’s supplies. These include cleaning compounds, soaps, 
towels, toilet paper, mops, brushes, floor oil, sweeping com- 
pounds, dusters, window brushes and driers, pails, dust 
pans, gas mantles, electric bulbs, thermometers, waste paper 
baskets, nails and screws, paints and oils, tools, ink, and simi- 
lar material. 
2. Blank forms and office supplies. These include the various 
blank forms used by principal, teachers, and janitor, and such 
ffice supplies as letter paper, envelopes, postage stamps, 
thumb tacks, mucilage, rubber stamps, and paper fasteners. 
3. Instructional supplies. These include chalk, erasers, pointers, 
blank paper of all kinds, pencils, penholders and pens, writ- 
ing pads, blotters, paste, twine, rulers, blank books, and sim- 
ilar material consumed in office work or classroom instruction. 
4. Textbooks and supplemental books. These include the regular 
free textbooks supplied pupils, the free texts supplied indi- 
gents if free books are not supplied generally, the desk books 
supplied teachers, and the supplemental books supplied for in- 
struction. 
5. Special supplies. These include kindergarten material, spe- 
cial primary-grade material, and materials used in manual 
training, domestic science, sewing, art, and science instruc- 
tion. They also include, if furnished by the school, all play 
material, such as balls, bats, nets, and similar equipment. 
Still further they may include such more-expensive, less- 
frequently-used, and more-easily-broken supplies, such as 
lantern slides, stereoscopes and views, maps, charts, pictures, 
knives, scissors, and special pieces of teaching apparatus. 
6. Health-work supplies. These include all material needed in 
the first-aid cabinet, and special materials used by the nurses 
and health inspectors on their visits or in their clinics. 
7. Fuel. Wood, coal, and kindling.   ° 
Ordering these supplies. Different school systems have
-P-A-G-E-211
BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 195 
different methods for furnishing these supplies to schools, 
but the most common way is to provide the school with an 
initial supply in the autumn, and then deliver additional 
supplies each month, as requisitioned for by the school prin- 
cipal. Supplemental and reference books are supplied as 
needed, as are wood and coal, while orders for special ma- 
terial needed and not in the stock rooms are usually hon- 
ored as received. 
Different forms of requisition blanks are usually supplied 
schools on which to order the supplies needed. The jani- 
tor requisitions for his supplies as needed, the principal ap- 
proving the requisition and forwarding it to the central of- 
fice. The janitor usually telephones to the central office his 
needs as to wood and coal. ‘The janitor also verifies, and 
signs and issues receipts for all coal, wood, and general sup- 
plies delivered at the school. He also issues orders for pay 
for removing each load of garbage or ashes, and often verifies 
the readings each month of the water, gas, and electric light 
meters. The principal or his clerk must keep up the stock 
of instructional supplies, office supplies, and blank forms by 
watching his supply room and ordering properly in advance, 
while the special teachers and the school nurse will be ex- 
pected to make their requisitions to him, similarly, for the 
special supplies they need for their work. The regular text- 
books and desk books are usually supplied not more than 
twice a year, and. the indigent books and supplemental 
books as needed for instruction. Special orders need the 
oversight and approval of the principal. If the school has a 
small expense budget, small items needed in a hurry may 
be purchased in the neighborhood. 
' Toward the close of each year the principal is usually ex- 
pected to give an estimate to the central office, based on the 
past requirements and the expected future increases, of the 
amount and kind of supplies needed by the school the com-
-P-A-G-E-212
  
196 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ing year. At the close of the year he is usually expected to 
make out an inventory of all supplies and equipment on 
hand, and for this purpose he either gathers into the stock- 
room all instructional supplies from the rooms, or has each 
teacher give him an inventory of the supplies in each class or 
special room. The latter is the easier way, unless there is 
some special reason for gathering up the supplies. The spe- 
cial supplies are inventoried by the special teachers. The 
principal is also expected, before leaving for his vacation, to 
file a requisition for enough of all kinds of supplies to start 
the school in the autumn and carry it along the first month. 
In some school systems, or for some kinds of supplies, the 
requisition is for the half year. Then month by month, or 
term by term, the principal is expected to supply the central 
office, by a certain day, with requisitions for all additional 
supplies needed. These are then sent on certain days from 
the general storeroom, or by the dealers to the school, and 
the principal or janitor must inspect the delivery and re-, 
ceipt for the supplies. 
Giving out the supplies. The janitor’s supplies are kept 
in the janitor’s storeroom, and used as needed. The princi- 
pal merely has in his office a duplicate inventory and requisi- 
tion record, from which he can check up the amount of each 
supply used. The blank forms will be stored in a cabinet or 
drawer in the principal’s office, or in the adjacent storeroom. 
The office supplies and the instructional supplies will be 
kept in the general storeroom, and distributed to the rooms 
asneeded. The special supplies needed in the kindergarten, 
primary grades, manual training, domestic science, and 
sewing will best be stored in the special rooms. The play 
equipment should be in the basement or the gymnasium, 
and some special pupil or teacher checking-in-and-out sys- 
tem devised for it. New equipment should go through the 
storeroom. All books not in use should be on the shelves 
of the storeroom.
-P-A-G-E-213
  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 197 
To retain control of the supplies, and be able to check 
waste, a number of different plans are in use in different cit- 
ies, and these plans run from the extreme of keeping every- 
thing under lock, and the principal carrying the keys, to an 
open storeroom where teachers may help themselves. The 
former is too wasteful a method to be tolerated, yet the 
writer once examined one large city school system where 
this plan was followed. Supplies were given out in doles, 
under a false idea of economy, and it was necessary to find 
the principal and have him unlock the door every time any- 
thing was needed. He became, in reality, “‘a hander out of 
chalk and paper.”’ Of the two plans the open storeroom is 
preferable, as any waste in supplies is many times counter- 
balanced by the saving of the time of the most highly paid 
employee of the school. 
If the principal has an office clerk she can handle the 
storeroom and oversee all income and outgo, but, if not, a 
plan somewhat after one of the following can be made to 
work easily and well. ' 
If the schoolrooms are provided with a closet for room 
supplies, as most schoolrooms are, have placed in each room, 
at the beginning of school in the autumn, a reasonable quan- 
tity of materials, say enough to run five or six weeks. Train 
the teachers to anticipate their needs, as far as possible, and 
get new supplies at stated times once a month, or at most 
once each week. Hang the key to the storeroom in a known 
place in the office, so that special or unexpected needs may 
be attended to and charged by the teachers themselves. 
This plan places on the teacher the responsibility for ac- 
counting for what is taken. Another plan which centralizes 
responsibility on the janitor is to have him attend to all or- 
ders or wants of the teachers, taking their requisition slips 
to the storeroom, placing them on the file, and bringing back 
to the rooms the material needed, It is usually not advis-
-P-A-G-E-214
  198 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
able that pupils be sent to the general storeroom for sup- 
plies. 
Keeping records and charging. No supplies should be 
taken or issued except on the filing of a simple requisition, 
or charge slip, dated, listing everything and the amount 
wanted or taken, and signed by the teacher desiring the sup- 
plies. All such charge slips are to be put on a file from 
which they will be taken, from time to time, by the princi- 
pal or his clerk, for record and tabulation. If supplies are 
issued ordinarily only once a month, a monthly requisition 
can be made out by the teacher, and then charge slips are 
used only for special items.: The trouble with any insist- 
ence on a monthly requisition is that it is hard for new teach- 
ers to anticipate needs and order enough and not too much, 
and the fixed plan tends to interfere with instructional 
needs. Teachers go without supplies, or borrow from one 
another, rather than ask the principal for more. 
Some simple plan, such as one of the above, will prove 
satisfactory in nearly all schools, and will obviate the neces- 
sity for any elaborate requisition form, prior approval by 
principal, issuance of duplicate “I charge you”’ slips to be 
signed by the teacher, and the return of these slips to the 
office for record. 
Nor need there be any elaborate bookkeeping. The 
charge slips form an account with each teacher, and from 
these once or twice a year a tabulation can be made and un- 
due waste seen and checked. ‘The record for instructional 
supplies need only contain date, item, quantity, and signa- 
ture, as they are not expected to come back. Books, maps, 
globes, lantern slides, and apparatus are different — espe- 
cially books. For these devise as simple a charging system 
as is definite and workable. A card, on which can be entered 
date and signature when taken and returned, answers for 
most pieces of supply. For books a charge card for each
-P-A-G-E-215
  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 199° 
book or set of books may be kept, or, easier still, a large card 
can be thumb-tacked to a drawing board fastened on the 
door, and ruled so as to carry a complete record of all books 
in the school. 
By some such simple means as the above the principal 
can so organize the supply problem that it will not cost him 
more than a couple of hours a month at most. With an of- 
fice clerk to attend to the ordering, storing, and charging, it 
need require hardly any attention. 
3. A small school budget 
Need for and use of. The school department furnishes 
each school with a definite list of supplies, this being larger 
in some cities than in others. Often in cities the list pre- 
viously given (page 194) of “5, Special Supplies,” will be 
strictly limited, while “6, Health-Work Supplies,” will not 
be furnished at all. In other cities, though these may be 
furnished, in whole or in part, it is difficult to get new or 
special items added to the list. Yet in the administration of 
every school building many little unforeseen and unclassified 
items of expense arise during the year that are legitimate 
school expenditures. Many of them are too trivial, and 
many of them are of too irregular a nature to bring before 
the central office or board of education on requisition, and 
as a result the principal either pays for them or the school 
goes without what are often minor necessities. Some prin- 
cipals shoulder the burden uncomplainingly, while others 
refuse to provide many small expense items that would 
minister to the smooth and efficient administration of the 
school. 
In many school systems an attempt has been made to 
meet this by authorizing entertainments to raise funds for 
special school purposes, or by allowing the principal a small 
budget for minor miscellaneous expenses, or, still better, by
-P-A-G-E-216
  ~ 200 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
both. Money raised by entertainments is best used for spe- 
cial purposes, such as the purchase of playground equip- 
ment, a phonograph, a lantern, pictures, or some analogous 
expenditure. The budget for minor miscellaneous expenses 
can be made to cover a host of needs, such as express on ex- 
hibits, telegrams, toll telephone calls, car tickets for messen- 
gers, pupils sent home because of illness or accident, taxi 
fares for the same purpose, printing of school programs, 
postage, decorations for special occasions, copies of playlets 
to be put on, renting of costumes for free entertainments, 
ribbon, pennants, Christmas tree, display material, crépe 
paper, drayage, supplies for the first-aid cabinet, folk-dance 
music, baseballs and bats, basket balls and volley balls, 
minor expenses of speakers or musicians, emergency jani- 
tor or teacher supplies, some little change about the build- 
ing, etc. 
Apportionment and accounting. The common plan is 
either to allow the principal a definite amount per half-year, 
generally about $50.00, or a definite amount per pupil en- 
rolled for each half year, such as 10 cents per pupil. This 
amount the principal is allowed to pay out, and from time 
to time is reimbursed by check on the submission of an item- 
ized petty-fund account. Money raised by special enter- 
tainments within the school is likewise to be spent under the 
direction or requisition of the principal, though when any 
large item is to be bought it is best to purchase it through 
the school purchasing department. 
The school principal is a business manager as well as an 
educator, managing a $20,000 to $50,000 a year business, 
and he should be allowed what business superintendents 
generally are allowed — a small petty-expense fund for con- 
tingencies and minor miscellaneous purchases. To keep a 
record of receipts and expenses is simple and will require but 
little time, If the principal has an office clerk she can attend
-P-A-G-E-217
  BUSINESS ORGANIZATION ‘1201 
toitall. The whole record can be kept on a card, or a sheet 
of ledger paper. 
Another special budget item sometimes granted, and one 
which is best done quietly, is one for the purchase of milk, 
eggs, butter, soups, cereals, etc., for the special school feed- 
ing of the children of poor and often ignorant parents, many 
of whom are undernourished, anzemic, or tubercular. A 
special budget of $50.00 per half year for this purpose would 
add greatly to the efficiency of the instruction given such 
children in many a school. 
4. Blank forms and reports 
Blanks for pupils and parents. In the office of the princi- 
pal of every school, large or small, quite a number of blank 
forms must be kept on hand, and a certain number of re- 
quired reports must be made to the central office. The 
making of certain statistical reports to the central office is a 
necessity, though the matter is often overdone. Not infre- 
quently reporting is made more time-consuming than neces- 
sary because the report forms from teachers to principal and 
from principal to the central office do not have the items 
arranged in similar order. On the other hand, the more 
printed forms available for charging, requisitions, notices to 
pupils and parents, and for sending information to the cen- 
tral office the better. These forms require only the filling in 
of a name or a brief statement of facts, and the signature of 
the teacher or principal. It is quite important, though, that 
these printed forms be couched in good language, and that 
the information they contain as to pupil conduct or studies 
be so stated as to elicit cobperation instead of awakening 
resentment. While the blanks used by any city are deter- 
mined by the central authorities, and the principal must use 
what is given him, yet he always has a chance, in principals’ 
meeting or in personal conferences, to suggest improvements.

2. Various cumulative records, for a series of years. 
(A Record Book for Elementary School Principals, such 
as the one by that title devised by Strayer and Engle- 
hardt, and published by C. F. Williams and Son, Inc., 
Albany, New York, gives the principal a choice of a 
large number of records, which may be kept for a series 
of years and in good form for easy reference.) 
5. Relations with the central office 
Punctuality and proper form. Promptness, punctuality, 
courtesy, and respect for authority are prime essentials in a 
successful principal. In the matter of reports and requisi- 
tions certain principals are almost always late, while certain 
others can be counted on to get their reports in on time or a 
little ahead of time. The same is true of teachers in the mat- 
ter of their reports to the principal. The supply clerk can- 
not combine requisitions and place orders, the superintendent 
of schools cannot complete his statistical report for the 
board of education, and the principal cannot complete his 
report for the superintendent of schools because some one 
person along the line is late. An occasional failure, due to 
illness or overwork, can be passed over, but the delay be- 
comes exasperating when caused month by month by the 
same small group of unbusinesslike teachers and principals. 
The delay is usually wholly unnecessary. The thing for 
the principal to do is to anticipate his work, and see to it 
that his teachers do the same. Often he must anticipate it 
for them. The same principles so frequently mentioned as 
means of saving time and expediting work, applied to re- 
ports, will produce similar results. 
Courtesy and respect for authority too are essential. The 
superintendent of schools, business manager, attendance of- 
ficer, and health officer may all be inferior to the principal in 
education, knowledge of their work, or in culture and refine- 
ment, yet they hold certain positions which represent au-  
-P-A-G-E-222
    206 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
thority and in such should be given the same respect that the 
principal would like to have extended to him as head of his 
school. One can be friendly without being familiar, respect- 
ful without being obsequious, and can accept decisions and 
carry them out without kow-tow-ing. In addressing com- 
munications to his superiors in office, a polite acknowledg- 
ment of relationships is an evidence of good breeding. At 
the heading of the letter and on the envelope, of all official 
communications, put the officer’s official title. Do not ad- 
dress the letter or the envelope to “John Jones,” or to 
“Supt. John Jones,” or to “John Jones, Supt. of Schs.,”’ but 
take time to spell out the words and to address your com- 
munication to “Mr. John Jones, Superintendent of City 
Schools,” and head your letter “Dear Sir,” or “Dear Super- 
intendent Jones,” according to the nature of the communi- 
cation and the extent of your acquaintance. Besides being 
in proper form, and evidencing a gentleman, such little 
courtesies actually pay in the longrun. The same is true of 
the other officers connected with the school system. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Can you characterize principals you have known who represent differ- 
ent types from those described under A to E, on page 186? If so, do 
so. 
2. Plan a working schedule, similar to Form 1, page 51, for the last 
month of school. 
8. Have you anything to add to or to change in the tentative daily Pro- 
gram for the principal, given on pages 188-89? 
4. Most people waste an inordinate amount of time in purposeless talk 
and inability to state quickly a problem or an issue. This human 
characteristic will cause a principal to waste much valuable time from 
his five valuable school-session hours if he is not careful. Suggest other 
means, than those mentioned in the text, for preventing waste of time 
in this way, and at the same time without giving offense to parents 
or teachers. 
5. Inestablishing such office hoursas those given on page 192, should anew 
principal hold rigidly to them at first, or should he gradually train 
people to know and to follow them? Why?
-P-A-G-E-223
BUSINESS ORGANIZATION 207 
6. How will a principal’s ability to establish such hours -vary with: 
a. The character of the neighborhood? 
b. The size of the school? 
c. The presence or lack of an office clerk? 
d. The traditions and habits of the community? 
7. Outline a simple plan by which a principal could make a semi-annual 
per-pupil check of instructional supplies used by each teacher in his 
building. 
8. Should the principal know the actual and relative consumption of fuel 
by his janitor? Why? 
9. Make up a single charge-and-credit slip, for use by teachers in securing 
or returning: 
a. Instructional supplies. 
b. Special supplies. 
c. Desk and reference books. 
d. Supplemental readers. 
10. Prepare a monthly account statement, for the superintendent’s office, 
showing status of and expenditures from: 
a. The petty school budget. 
b. The special pupil-feeding fund. 
11. The Superintendent of Schools has, by general letter, asked all princi- 
pals in the city to make a brief report to him, in writing, as to the dif- 
ficulties now experienced, if any, in the matter of pupils securing their 
textbooks promptly, and whether, in the judgment of the principals, 
the difficulties encountered are such as would warrant the Board of 
Education in supplying free textbooks, in whole or in part. 
Prepare your report on the matter, in proper form, for forwarding 
to the superintendent’s office.

CHAPTER XI 
THE SCHOOL JANITOR AND HIS WORK 
The position, and janitorial types. It is often and quite 
truthfully said that the most important individual about 
any large school building, after the principal, is the school 
janitor. Outside of the principal, no one has more influence 
over the physical well-being of the children in the school 
than has the janitor. It is he who under-heats or over- 
heats the classrooms, controls the ventilation, cleans the 
building properly or does not, and keeps the toilet facilities 
in proper order if they are so kept. He is often a potent in- 
fluence in the discipline of the school; he knows the good 
and the poor teachers of the school as few other persons do; 
and he is often an influential factor in the formation of 
neighborhood opinion as to the school and the principal. 
Important as the position appears to be, he is the only of- 
ficial in the school who is not required to have any training 
for his work. Despite the marked improvement in janitor 
service which has taken place in the past quarter-century, in 
few of our cities is there as yet any adequate conception of 
the importance of the position, or any standards for the 
man’s selection. Sometimes, when the salary paid is low, 
any one who will apply will be taken. Sometimes, even when 
the salary is satisfactory, the long hours and the numerous 
“bosses” keep good men from seeking the appointment. 
Sometimes one finds cities where the place is a political sine- 
cure, and the janitor a powerful personality in the politics of 
his district. The writer has been told of two cases in which 
janitors have been elected to the school board, and one in 
which the janitor was elected as a member of the city coun- 
cil, a body which in that city fixed the school department  
-P-A-G-E-226
  210 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
annual budget. Occasionally, in the smaller cities, one 
finds the janitors are political pensioners, and in such a 
case the principal often is compelled not to see too much or 
to expect too much. 
In most cases, though, the janitor, man or woman, is just 
an ordinary individual, unskilled in any line of work, igno- 
rant of sanitary standards and educational needs, sometimes 
grouchy, sometimes pig-headed, but usually quite human, 
amenable to kind treatment, and willing to do about what 
seems to him as fair and reasonable for the pay he receives, 
and not much more. 
If one could choose his janitor he would set up as stand- 
ards such qualities as good moral character, cleanly personal 
habits and speech, reasonably good English, an interest in 
and a right attitude toward children, and a willingness to be 
useful and to learn. This last is more important than ini- 
tial skill. A young man is usually better than an old man, 
and a married man than one who is single. The kind of work 
he has been engaged in before is often indicative of the type 
of janitor the person will make. The best three janitors 
the writer has known, two men and a woman, had previously 
been a carpenter, a pastor of a little church, and a nurse 
with inadequate preparation. ; 
Varied nature of the janitor’s work. The school janitor 
who is efficient and useful has a varied task, with at times 
hard work and long hours, and under modern conditions he 
is expected to manage complicated processes and do techni- 
cal work for which he seldom has any preparation. In a 
modern school building to-day there are complicated heating 
and ventilating plants, electric switches, vacuum cleaning 
equipment, electric motors, and, in dirty cities, expensive air- 
washing machines. The building, too, has special rooms, 
equipped with expensive and often delicate apparatus. The 
work calls for a combination of a good housekeeper, a sani-
-P-A-G-E-227
THE SCHOOL JANITOR 211 
tary expert, a carpenter, a plumber, an electrician, and an 
engineer. There is as yet, though, scarcely anywhere any 
training given for the work, even to those in service. 
Janitors, especially men janitors, certainly are not born, 
but must be made. This task devolves on the principal, 
and it is for him to get satisfactory service from unskilled 
and often unintelligent labor, and to develop some pride in 
good work in a man of no perspective. The janitor usually 
does his work by rule of thumb, and often sees no reason for 
many of the things he is required to do. Particularly does 
he usually fail to appreciate the sanitary aspect of his work, 
and considers many of the requirements as sheer nonsense. 
Fresh air and sunlight he often seems afraid of, and dust usu- 
ally has no terrors for him. 
In winter the janitor must be on hand before daylight to 
get the fires started and the building warm. He must shovel 
coal, ashes, and snow, and dispose of dirt, paper waste, and 
garbage. He must clean the building daily and in a sanitary 
manner. He must act as general repair man, doing bits of 
carpenter work, plumbing, painting, wiring, and oiling. 
Doors, seats, hinges, sidewalks, tree-protection frames, and 
loose things generally call for his attention. He is under 
obligations to afford police protection to his building and 
grounds. He receives supplies as delivered, keeps an eye on 
strangers, admits workmen to the building and keeps an ac- 
count of their labor, and answers the doorbell when the 
building is closed. It is his duty to assist the principal with 
discipline, especially as it relates to the basement and toi- 
lets. If he understands children he can be very helpful. 
He is a sort of chore boy for all the teachers. They call 
upon him to bring them supplies, hang pictures, open win- 
dows, put up shelves, oil rusty locks and hinges, fill ink 
wells, and adjust seats as directed. He must work in the 
dirt of the basement, and yet, if summoned to a teacher’s
-P-A-G-E-228
- 212 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
room or to the principal’s office, he is expected to present a 
reasonably good appearance. Though teachers and princi- 
pal at times are tired and peevish and fussy, he is expected 
to be always polite and good natured when asked to do some- 
thing. The position is not an easy one to fill satisfactorily, 
the janitor often receives little education or training from 
the principal, and all in all is probably more often maligned 
than understood. 
The task of the school principal. One measure of the 
success of a school principal and of his fitness for the posi- 
tion should be his ability to give any willing and reasonably 
intelligent janitor a large conception of his job, and to help 
him to see how important in the lives of children is the work 
he hastodo. He must help the janitor to evaluate his work, 
establish in him standards of accomplishment, and must 
appreciate and encourage and protect him as long as he ex- 
hibits a willingness to try to render satisfactory service. 
The principal going to a new position will do well to get 
acquainted with his janitor early, and take his measure well. 
It is good psychology to have the janitor show a new princi- 
pal over the building, and explain things to the newcomer. 
A good janitor will nearly always show an interest and a 
helpful spirit, but if the principal finds a man who is secre- 
tive, grouchy, on the defensive from the start, and inclined 
to stand on his rights, it is best to ignore these qualities at 
first and try to warm him upa bit. Most janitors have too 
much to do, all are human, and almost all are sensitive to 
little courtesies and expressions of appreciation, as well as to 
criticism and attempts to drive them, or to impose on them 
what seem to them to be unreasonable requirements. It is 
well to understand these things and act accordingly. Per- 
haps the janitor is overworked and underpaid; perhaps he 
and the last principal did not get along well; perhaps the 
teachers are fussy and the pupils careless; perhaps he has
-P-A-G-E-229
    THE SCHOOL JANITOR 213 
troubles at home; perhaps his defensive attitude is merely 
that exhibition of bad manners and an “I’m as good as 
you” pose not infrequently shown by poorly educated 
working people toward those who wear better clothes and 
have better manners than they. 
It may be just his way of showing you his conception of 
democracy. The probabilities, though, are that the princi- 
pal is facing a situation in which ultimately he will need to 
know how far his authority will be supported when the test 
comes as to who is in control. If the janitor happens to be 
a janitress, the task may be still more unpleasant under such 
conditions. Even though this should be the case, little can 
be accomplished by posting rules and regulations, laying 
down the law prematurely, or nagging or scolding. The 
janitor may be lazy, incompetent when judged by fair stand- 
ards, uncouth and rude, and even at times discourteous, 
and still one may have to get along with him for years to 
come. He certainly will be a trial, but he may not be en- 
tirely hopeless. Possibly the teachers in the school may ex- 
hibit some of the same characteristics; they may even be 
the characteristic traits of the people of the neighborhood. 
If so, here is a fine opportunity for a kindly, considerate 
gentleman to teach by example, even though at times he 
boils within. On the other hand the man may be ugly by 
nature and be trying out the new principal, and things may 
come to a crisis rapidly. If the test really comes the prin- 
cipal must possess power to deal with the janitor in a brief 
and pointed manner. The relation between principal and 
janitor is so close that friction between them soon impairs 
the efficiency of both, and when it does arise it is better to 
try a new janitor — or principal. 
Administrative principles in dealing with the janitor. In 
nine cases out of ten, however, the principal will find instead 
a well-meaning janitor, possessed of ordinary average intelli-
-P-A-G-E-230
214 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
gence, and willing to try to please if he understands what is 
wanted and does not have what he considers unreasonable 
demands made upon him. The task of the principal is to 
get as good results as possible under such conditions. The 
problem presented is as varied as human nature itself, but: 
there are certain administrative principles which underlie 
the relations between principal and janitor, and teachers 
and janitor, which should be observed. Briefly stated, 
these are: 
1. Make your janitor feel that you are open to suggestions, and 
will welcome any ideas as to procedure that he may offer. If 
they are good, thank him and tell him so; if you cannot use 
them, explain to him why. The janitor often knows pupils 
and teachers well, and in addition possesses a fund of prac- 
tical experience that can be made to contribute to the 
efficiency of the school. 
. The principal should stand ready to make the janitor’s. work 
as light as reasonably good service permits. To this end he 
should insist that he be provided with as good quarters and as 
good supplies as possible. Do not expect him to do good 
work with poor brooms and brushes and cleaning materials. 
. Keep in mind that his hours are long, and that he gets tired 
and sleepy just as other people do. Try to help him to adjust 
his work to a good schedule so as to lighten it when possible, 
and do not allow teachers to delay him unnecessarily in his 
work or make it difficult for him to do. 
. Protect him as far as possible from the fussy teachers of the 
building. Some women are never pleased with anything a 
man does, particularly in the line of housekeeping. Ask them 
not to find fault with him, especially in the presence of their 
pupils, but to bring their complaints to you. 
. Do not address him as “Janitor,” or “George,” but as ‘‘Mr. 
Strowbridge,” and ask your teachers to do the same. When 
you give him instructions, do not say “Do so and so,” but 
rather ‘Will you please do so and so.”” Don’t forget to say 
“Good morning” to him, and if he tells you that his wife or 
baby is sick, ask him occasionally how they are getting along. 
If he works well and is attentive to little things, express ap- 
preciation from time to time, A “that’s fine,” or “I’m glad
-P-A-G-E-231
  10. THE SCHOOL JANITOR 215 
you thought of that,” helps very much. Have the teachers 
say such things to him, too, once in a while. In showing vis- 
itors about the building, do not ignore him, but ask him to 
explain things, though you might easily do it yourself. 
. Cultivate in him a feeling of ownership in the building and 
grounds, and occasionally take orders from him. You can af- 
ford to let him be a little important and officious provided he 
is rendering efficient service. Occasionally ask him if every- 
thing is all right, if he needs anything, how the furnace is 
working to-day, or “how much coal was burned last month,” 
and how that compares with a year ago. Teach him to read 
the meters, if he does not know, and to figure out some- 
thing as to maintenance costs. Occasionally give him an 
article relating to his work, as in the School Board Journal, or 
show him a picture of some new school or school appliance. 
. Cultivate in him a pride in doing his work, and help him to 
find better and more economical ways of doing things. Some- 
times the suggestion that you will furnish the paint or varnish 
for some little job will start a regular clean-up about the build- 
ing. If he is interested in having some flowers in the yard let 
him put them out, and if necessary train the pupils to let 
them alone. 
. Train pupils.and teachers.to help him in his work by.keeping 
loose paper off floor.and.yard, by clearing desks in the after- 
noon, and by turning the seats ready for sweeping. It is 
much. easier for forty pupils to pick up loose paper than for 
one man alone, and for four hundred boys and girls to learn 
to scrape their muddy feet than for one man to gather the 
dirt from the floors and stairs of the building. Such little 
courtesies are appreciated, and are besides good training in 
decent living procedure for boys and girls — especially for 
the boys. An assembly talk on the janitor and his work 
might be given once each year or two. 
. If the janitor has a grievance, let him tell it to you; if it is a 
reasonable one, remedy it if it relates to the school work. He 
is a human being and an American citizen, and as such has his 
rights. Many teachers are unreasonable and inconsiderate, 
and a janitor can often tell you things it is good for you to 
know. He has many opportunities for observing teacher’s 
methods of class control. 
It pays well in service, if the teachers and principal and jani- 
tor can work harmoniously together, to show the janitor some
-P-A-G-E-232
216 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
little courtesies occasionally that come as the joint thoughtful- 
ness of teachers and principal. A turkey at Thanksgiving, a 
box of cigars or some piece of wearing apparel at Christmas. 
and when the fine spring days come and there are no fires io 
keep up, a few days off until late afternoon to go fishing or to 
set out his garden, and the saving of some refreshments for 
him when these are served at the school, are little attentions 
that are much appreciated and pay big dividends. 
Placing responsibility for service. Such a policy in han- 
dling a school janitor and getting work out of him does not 
mean that he is to be coddled to get him to do his work, or 
that he is to be given an exaggerated opinion of his own im- 
portance. Neither does it mean that he is to be allowed 
to dictate or to choose his own methods, duties, or hours. 
Such a policy does mean, however, that the principal is to 
take pains to get the janitor’s viewpoint, to encourage sug- 
gestions, to give orders and directions to him in a tact- 
ful manner, to help soothe irritated feelings caused by 
thoughtless teachers with sharp tongues, and to endeavor to 
awaken in him ideals for his work and a pride in the appear- 
ance of his school. 
At the same time have fixed standards of work and re- 
sponsibility, and see that these are met. The rules and reg- 
ulations of the school board usually cover most important 
points, and frequently there are supplemental instructions 
from the superintendent’s office. Do not ostentatiously 
tack these up in his quarters, but inquire if he has a copy, 
or hand him any new instructions received. . Assume that 
he reads and will follow these, but if they seem too unreason- 
able, in view of his other work, try to lighten his load. 
Have perfectly attainable standards, adapted to different 
types of days — clear and dry, rainy and muddy, snow and 
cold, parent-teacher days, entértainment-night days — and 
help him plan and shift his work so as to get along reason- 
ably satisfactorily under different or vexatious conditions,
-P-A-G-E-233
    THE SCHOOL JANITOR 217 
The janitor should know just what he is to do each day 
and week and month. He and the principal must agree 
upon what is a reasonable basis for judging the quality of 
the work, in case the principal is not satisfied with the way 
itisdone. There are many degrees of “good” in the way a 
room may be swept, but it must be clearly understood what 
kind of sweeping will be accepted and what will not. After 
a definite understanding has been arrived at, if an under- 
standing becomes necessary, the principal must see that the 
requirements are met, as any let-up in the case of an unsat- 
isfactory janitor will be regarded as a chance to slight the 
work, 
Reasonable standards for work. The question as to what 
are reasonable standards for work will vary somewhat in 
different cities, in different types of school buildings, in 
different seasons and conditions of weather, and somewhat 
also according to the size of the building and the amount of 
janitor assistance provided. The following at least, with 
sufficient service provided, seem reasonable standards upon 
which to insist: 
1. That wooden floors in classrooms and main hallways should 
be thoroughly waxed or oiled twice a year, and cleaned once 
each day. Some hallways may need cleaning still oftener in 
bad weather. 
2. That dampened sawdust or a sweeping compound should be 
used, and that dry sweeping or sprinkling floors should be pro- 
hibited. 
8. That feather dusters should not be used, but dust cloths 
should be employed and the dust shaken out outside the 
building. , 
4, After sweeping the desks are to be wiped off, and the curtains 
left up so that the room may get all the sunlight possible. 
. Blackboards are to be cleaned each night. 
. Erasers and chalk troughs must be clept clean. If the school 
‘has a vacuum cleaning plant, the erasers may be cleaned by 
it in the basement; if not, then out of doors and away from 
the building. Qo
-P-A-G-E-234
  218 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
7. Windows and doors are to be kept in repair, and windows 
cleaned on a schedule to be determined by local atmospheric 
conditions. 
8. Electric light and gas fixtures are to be kept clean, and broken 
bulbs and gas mantles replaced. 
9. Waste paper baskets to be emptied and contents burned daily. 
10. Foot mats at entrances, steps, and hallways to be kept clean, 
shaking and brushing up as often as necessary. 
11. Fire fighting apparatus to be inspected at stated periods, these 
being determined somewhat by the nature of the building. 
12. Waste paper and trash never to be allowed to accumulate in 
basement or near furnace. Oiled rags to be hung up in the 
open air, and never kept in a closet or box. 
13. Temperature to be as directed by principal, and fires to be 
started early enough to secure it by the time pupiis begin to 
arrive. 
14. Toilets to be inspected after each intermission, to see that 
they are clean and flushing properly. 
15. Drinking fountains to be kept in repair. 
16. Ventilating furnace for toilets, if there be one, to be kept 
running at all times during school hours. 
17. Vacuum cleaning apparatus, where provided, to be used daily, 
as this obviates most of the dusting. 
In the carrying out of these and other desirable regula- 
tions, leave as much discretion and choice of time to the jan- 
itor as service will permit. Whether he shall clean the 
schoolroom floors in the morning before teachers and pupils 
arrive or in the evening after they leave is immaterial, so 
long as they are in order when wanted. What is true of the 
sweeping is true of many other phases of the janitor’s work. 
Have the janitor responsible to but one person, and that 
person the principal. Teachers may of course ask him for 
little favors, but the constant giving of directions by too 
many people ultimately leads to friction and is not desirable. 
When teachers want things done that call for time and labor, 
it will be best if they make their requests through the princi- 
pal, or at least ask the principal about it before speaking to 
the janitor. While hard and fast rules in such matters are
-P-A-G-E-235
THE SCHOOL JANITOR 219 
not desirable, especially in small schools, it is well that the 
principal at least should first know of and approve of any 
special requests for janitorial service. 
Estimating the janitor’s work. While the above seem 
reasonable standards, they may be impossible of fulfillment 
at times due to extra work or unexpected happenings, or 
they may be impossible of fulfillment at all because the jan- 
itorial service provided is inadequate for the size of the. 
building and the character of the work. It is important 
that the principal come to know just what the janitor has to 
do each day and week, and how long it takes him to keep the 
building in good condition. Careful observation of his work 
for a while will give the principal a basis for judging. Rea- 
sonable allowances must be made for bad weather condi- 
tions and extra occasions, and for the furnace work in win- 
ter. If the janitor is overworked, the principal should plead 
his cause with the superintendent or business office. 
In time we shall doubtless have good rating cards for jan- 
itorial service, but as yet the cards devised leave much to be 
desired. One worked out a few years ago for Rockford, Illi- 
nois, tried to provide a quantitative measure of a janitor’s 
work and standardize it on the basis of one man for an eight- 
classroom and office building. This gave 100 points for this 
size of building, distributed 75 on care of building and the 
heating plant, 15 on care of grounds, and 10 on codperation 
with principal and teachers. The one recently worked out 
by the National Association of School Business and Ac- 
counting Officers, which is typical of most attempts to con- 
struct a rating card, neglects building size and conditions en- 
tirely, and rates the janitor on a number of items as superior, 
above average, average, below average, poor. Following the 
standards stated in this chapter, with adjustments and al- 
lowances for conditions, the principal can evaluate the work 
his janitor is expected to do and performs. The value of a
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
rating sheet is that it provides a somewhat objective meas- 
ure of efficiency that at times may be valuable. 
The daily building inspection. Even assuming a good 
janitor the principal should never take chances on things 
being properly done, but should make a daily building in- 
spection. As has been said before, the best time for this is on 
arrival in the morning, before teachers or pupils arrive. If 
the janitor knows that all his work, from cellar to roof, is to 
be inspected by the principal, he will tend to do his work 
better. Any manager of a business or an industrial plant 
will tell you that systematic inspection is one of the surest 
remedies known to cure inattention to duties. A janitor, 
fair or good, needs the tonic that comes from inspection as 
much as a teacher or a principal does. Every good house- 
keeper, too, finds constant supervision of servants indis- 
pensable to good results. In a few minutes, if things are as 
they should be, the principal can walk through the building 
and hastily note its condition. If things are not satisfac- 
tory he must first consider whether conditions and the 
amount of work to be done has made better work impossible. 
If the principal feels that the work ought to have been done, 
then he should ask the janitor the reason; if the excuse is un- 
satisfactory, he may ask the janitor to go and give immedi- 
ate attention to what is wrong. In general this latter is not 
a wise plan, as it savors too much of the arbitrary exercise 
of authority, but there are occasions when failure to follow 
it would be a mistake. 
The items to be looked after on this hasty building in- 
spection include: 
1. Condition of the classrooms — floors, desks, blackboards, 
erasers, chalk troughs, books, cloakrooms, etc. 
2. The special rooms — office, teachers, lunch, emergency, 
music, drawing, manual training, domestic science, assembly 
hall — similarly examined.
-P-A-G-E-237
THE SCHOOL JANITOR 221 
8. The toilet rooms for conditions, lewd pictures, writing, 
toilet paper, towels, soap, cleanliness of wash bowls, etc. 
4. The basement for cleanliness, the furnaces for general con- 
dition and the small ventilating furnace, where such is a part 
of the equipment, to see that it is in use. 
5. The halls and stairways, for cleanliness and general appear- 
ance. 
6. Small repairs needed, any over-night damage to building or 
grounds. 
7. The playgrounds, play apparatus, shrubbery, walks, fences, 
etc. 
It is well also to pass into the toilet rooms occasionally dur- 
ing the day, to see that all continues well. In time a prin- 
cipal becomes so sensitive to conditions that he notices 
things that are wrong when he would not have noticed them 
if right. 
As the pupils come, and as the principal passes about the 
building later in the day, he should also note: 
8. The general “‘atmosphere” of the rooms as shown by teacher, 
pupils, written work, cleanliness, ventilation, etc. 
The janitor asa helper. A good janitor, who is interested 
in children and who understands them, can be of much assist- 
ance to the principal in the matter of the discipline of the 
school. He ought to be on reasonably good terms with the 
boys, yet he must at times help supervise them. One jani- 
tor whom the writer knew was so up on games that he was 
continually called on by the boys to act as starter and um- 
pire; another taught the boys new games; another (the 
former pastor) attended to all injuries on the grounds and 
looked after the youngsters generally. Such help in school 
management is a valuable addition. Often a little encour- 
agement will bring out the janitor’s good qualities, and when 
the boys take to him they will do much to lighten his load. 
Often the principal, by a word now and then, can help de- 
velop such a situation.
-P-A-G-E-238
222 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
On the other hand, some janitors by their ways and talk 
bring down ridicule on themselves, and sometimes even an- 
noyance from the children. Unless the matter goes beyond 
the point of innocent fun it is not advisable to interfere, even 
though the janitor complain. Perhaps the best attitude to 
take in case of difficulty between janitor and pupils is that of 
mediator. Usually a little smoothing of the ruffled feelings 
of the janitor, a little timely advice as to why they annoy 
him, and suggestions as to how to get along in the future and 
avoid further trouble will solve his side of the problem, while 
a frank discussion of the difficulty with the class containing 
the mischievous ones will handle the boy end. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Would you add anything more to the ten administrative principles for 
dealing with the janitor, stated on pages 214-16, and if so, what? 
Do you take exception to any of the ten, and if so what ones, and 
why? 
2. Would you add anything more to the seventeen standards for work 
stated on pages 217-18, and if so, what? Do any of these statements 
appear to you to be too exacting? 
3. Do you agree that requests for service from the janitor should, in all 
important matters, first be approved by the principal? If not, why? 
4, What sort of records should the janitor keep? 
5. If there is too much for the janitor to do, and he has no helpers or in- 
sufficient help, what work may he best be permitted to neglect? What 
must he not neglect? 
6. Assume that your new janitor is willing, faithful, and ignorant; outline 
a plan for his gradual education. 
7. What ought a good janitor to know regarding his job?

  CHAPTER XII 
HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 
A principal’s work in health matters. While the work of 
school sanitation, health supervision, health teaching, physi- 
cal education, and child hygiene each represents a specizt 
field, for which in large school systems expert service is usu- 
ally provided, there is nevertheless a certain amount of 
knowledge as to each subject that is common and of which 
the principal should be cognizant. There are also certain 
measures that he should take to improve the health condi- 
tions in his school, even though some expert professional 
health supervision is provided by the school department or 
by the health department of the city. In many schools in 
the smaller cities and towns, however, no professional 
health supervision will. be provided, and in such schools 
whatever is done to care for and to improve the health con- 
ditions surrounding the children in his school must be 
planned by the principal himself. ~The position of principal 
offers large opportunities for useful constructive work along 
lines of health conservation, as much can be done independ- 
ently of professional assistance, but the position is not one 
in which a person holding Christian Science ideas as to 
health work can render much service. ; ; 
There are five divisions of educational hygiene concern- 
ing which a principal should have some knowledge, and on 
each of which he should have at least one good book in-his 
library for occasional reading and consultation. These are: 
Play and physical education. 
School sanitation. 
. Child hygiene. 
. Health teaching, including first-aid work. 
. Health supervision, including the work of the school nurse: or 98 Oe

  2% THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
By familiarizing himself with their contents, and using 
good judgment as to what he is to do and what to let alone, 
a principal ought to be able to look after the health work in 
his school with a reasonable degree of satisfaction, even 
though he be without expert scientific assistance. 4 
Something as to the nature and problems of play was in- 
dicated in Chapter VIII, and in the chapter just preceding 
this one the work of school sanitation was dealt with as it re- 
lates to the work of the school janitor. In this chapter, 
then, we shall treat briefly only the three other aspects of 
educational hygiene not previously considered. 
Child hygiene. The need here, on the part of the princi- 
pal, is for good general knowledge of the problems involved 
and possible lines of remedial treatment, to guide him in the 
many problems of school work that concern the hygiene of 
instruction. It is necessary that both principal and teach- 
ers take a biological point of view in dealing with the educa- 
tional process, and relate their school work to the laws of 
physical growth. For an understanding of childhood this 
biological point of view is essential. A defect of the schocl 
through all the ages has been the tendency to regard the 
child as exempt from the laws of physical nature, to judge 
the child by adult standards, and to forget that much that is 
best in education is, after all, wisely guided natural growth. 
There is an order of physiological development of which ed- 
ucation must take cognizance, and the close connection be- 
tween mental and physiological growth needs to be kept 
clearly in mind. Some knowledge of the principles of child 
hygiene will do much to correct wrong points of emphasis in 
the education of children. 
It is not necessary here to do more than indicate the gen- 
eral field of educational hygiene, though it is one that the 
principal needs tc master to help guide and shape his educa- 
tional philosophy. Without a clear understanding of its
-P-A-G-E-241
HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 225 
importance his school is likely to be a subject-matter school, 
and not a real educational institution. Briefly, then, the 
knowledge of educational hygiene that a principal needs lies 
along the following lines: 
1. The physical basis of education. 
2. The general laws of growth. 
a. Growth rate and disease resistance. : 
b. Relations between physical and mental growth. 
. Factors influencing growth. 
. Physiological characteristics of children. 
. Educational significance of physiological age. 
a. Contrast between this and mental age.

a. Chief defects, and their causes. 
b. The hygiene of posture.

a. Proper regimen. 
b. Open-air schools.

c. Common neuroses of development. 
21. Evil effects of school life. 
Terman’s Hygiene of the School Child is the best single 
book for the principal’s use along the lines of educational 
hygiene. 
Health teaching. In the matter of hygiene teaching 
much will_be outlined in any city course of study, and some 
“Health Primer” or series of “Health Readers” probably 
will be available for school use. In addition, the principal 
has constant opportunities to stimulate the teaching of 
proper health ideas and the formation of proper habits of 
health by the children. 
During the first six years of school life the formation of 
proper health habits is perhaps the most important thing to 
be looked after, and this involves right ideas as to cleanli- 
ness and personal care. In.addition to such general instr c- 
tion as may be provided for in the course of study, and 
which may come from a primer or reader, one good plan for 
teaching proper health habits is the gradual mauguration of 
a daily personal inspection by the pupils themselves, the 
teacher guiding the work. This may well include: 
1. Did you sleep with your windows open last night? 
2. Did you brush your teeth last night and this morning? 
3. Did you wash your face, hands, neck, and ears before coming 
to school? 
. Are your finger nails clean? 
Did you go without tea and coffee yesterday? 
. Did you play at least one game yesterday? 
. Did you practice at least three physical-training exercises 
yesterday? 
. Did you try to sit, stand, and walk correctly yesterday? 
. Did you keep your desk and surroundings in good order yes- 
terday? 
10. Did you do at least one helpful deed yesterday? 
The morning is the best time for this inspection. It may 
be a rapid checking-up by the teacher, or it may be made

one of the functions of a school health club, in which the 
children are inspected by health officers of their own elec- 
tion. The latter plan is the more effective. The inspection 
ought also, after it is once fully inaugurated, to go further 
than the above ten items, and include questions as to diet, 
sleep, and exercise. The gradual introduction of a health 
scale, such as is given in Oppen’s Teaching Health (p. 7) 
will add much to the concreteness and effectiveness of the 
instruction. 
In the upper grades the instruction should center about 
bodily care, health rather than disease, and should pass over 
into practical studies involving health conditions on the 
playground, about the school, in the home, the city streets 
and alleys, and such places as a bakery, a market, a dairy, 
a mill, or a factory. The principal can do much to direct 
the health teaching along practical lines, and keep it from 
becoming bookish and ineffective. 
What any school may do. In most of our schools the 
great burden for proper health work will still rest with the 
principal and teachers, and for the simple reason that the 
community has not as yet seen fit to make any provision for 
special service. Despite this lack of provision a principal 
and teachers who are interested can do much that is valu- 
able, working alone. Some of the simple means at hand 
may well be indicated. ' 
As a beginning, the school might well take time to make a 
health and nutrition survey, to find what are the actual ex- 
isting conditions in the school and among the pupils. This 
may well include the sanitary conditions in the school build- 
ing, toilets, and rooms; the play activities and possibilities; the 
heating, lighting, and ventilation of the building; the recess 
periods, study periods, and the home work; what type of in- 
struction in health is given; how effective is the instruction 
in cooking and physical training, as measured by the health
-P-A-G-E-244
    228 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
habits of the pupils; what foods the children eat; what kind 
of lunches they bring to school and eat; how they live and 
sleep, and how much they sleep; what their health habits 
are; etc. On the basis of the summarized results of such a 
study the instruction given in hygiene can usually be mate- 
rially improved, better lessons on proper diet and bodily 
care given, and many. features of the school work and 
school regimen changed. 
A next step is to determine the physical condition of the 
children themselves. There should be a pair of scales, with 
height measuring rod, in every school, though this is not 
usually found. Often a Parent-Teacher Association will 
supply this, if the board of education will not. If not, 
height can easily be determined, and a pair of scales cah be 
located in town where children may weigh themselves, or be 
weighed. Tables of normal height and weight can be found 
in many easily available books, and classroom weight rec- 
ords, like the one opposite, can be obtained on cards 124 
X 20’’in size, as indicated. With these aids the undernour- 
ished pupils can be singled out for attention, those falling 7 
per cent or more below normal being considered as under- 
nourished. A medical examination for these is desirable, if 
obtainable, to locate the causes for the malnutrition, and if 
possible secure their removal. No school, though, should 
hesitate to make the beginnings indicated because it has no 
physician and no funds for examinations. The resulting inn- 
provement in the health instruction will in itself pay for the 
labor of the survey. 
A campaign of health education. Based on the results of 
the survey, a campaign of health education can now be inau- 
gurated. This will call more for enthusiasm than for techni- 
cal knowledge. To enlist the leaders of the school in a 
health campaign calls for some of the same type of imparted 
enthusiasm as the selling of liberty bonds, tickets for a

school entertainment, or a thrift campaign. The school that 
launches a series of health drives, care-of-teeth drives, sleep 
drives, proper-diet drives, anti-coffee drives, better-break- 
fast drives, no-sweets-between-meals drives, accident-pre- 
vention drives, and be-strong-and-well drives will be sure to 
accomplish lasting results. 
All this work, as will be pointed out in this and the follow- 
ing chapters, can be closely tied up with the other activities 
of the school, and in consequence require less actual time in 
doing than in planning. Some schools have regular “‘Hy- 
giene Days,” and use the time very effectively for instruc- 
tion with regard to questions of personal hygiene, posture, 
remedial measures, care of person, and questions of civic 
health and welfare, with special reports by the pupils on 
assigned topics. In platoon-type schools, where an assem- 
bly period is used regularly for class purposes, the assembly 
can occasionally be used for hygiene teaching, with talks, 
short papers by pupils, demonstrations by Boy Scouts, 
Camp Fire Girls, and similar work. Sometimes minor acci- 
dents can be taken toaclassroom and treated by the teacher, 
with the class observing, and when this is possible it serves 
as very effective hygiene instruction. Such work easily 
passes over from the school to the home, and is often very 
valuable in its results. i 
Malnutrition, school feeding, fresh-air rooms. In every 
large public school there are children, frequently quite a 
number, who do not do well in their school work because they 
are cold, or hungry, or sick, or all three. These a health and 
nutrition survey at once reveals.’ In schools having many 
children of foreign-born parents, and especially South and 
East Europeans, this condition is very likely to exist. Poor, 
with large families, earning a low yearly wage, relatively ig- 
norant, living in cramped quarters, and careless as to cloth- 
ing and feeding and the laws of health, the children of these
-P-A-G-E-247
  
(Hei ea a ar _ 
HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 231 
families come to school in a poorly clothed or nourished 
condition, and not infrequently evidence the beginnings of 
tuberculosis. The marvel is that they are able to get along 
as well as they do. When the father is without work the 
children come to school without breakfast, or with a break- 
fast of only coffee and bread, and sometimes get no lunch, or 
at best buy a few pennies’ worth of food from a push cart or 
a neighboring grocery. 
Often the school can do nothing to remedy this condition. 
The people have not been educated to appreciate the need, 
they are too poor to act even if they did understand, and the 
sentiment of the school board and the community would 
be against any public attempt to alleviate this condition. 
Still, it is a sheer waste of good money to pay good salaries 
to good teachers to try to teach such children, as the in- 
struction is seldom fifty per cent effective. Here is a prob- 
lem for a principal to see if something cannot be done to 
remedy the condition and inaugurate a limited school feed- 
ing. Often, when the facts are presented to a Parent-Teacher 
Association, they will interest themselves and contribute 
both money and food to solve the problem. A number of 
instances where this has been done have been described. 
Sometimes boards of education can be interested, and a 
small appropriation for the work made. Sometimes school 
entertainments have been given to raise funds, but this is 
objectionable because of the publicity it gives to what is 
being done. Sometimes the principal is allowed to use part 
of his small school budget, or petty expense fund, for this 
purpose, the fund being increased to cover the added costs. 
The amount needed is not large —a little goes a long 
way and renders real service. The details of such work have 
been described, and do not need repetition here. The work 
requires some supervision, and records as to its cost and effec- 
tiveness and as to weight growth should be kept. Care must  
-P-A-G-E-248
  232 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
be taken that the food value of what is served is high. Eggs, 
milk, hot soup, cereals, and fruit are among the best things 
to use. For all children seven per cent or more under 
weight a mid-morning lunch should be served, at 10.00. 
For this bread or graham crackers and butter, with a half 
pint of milk, is very satisfactory. 
Even with children of low mentality some change is observ- 
able with this extra feeding, but near-normal children show a 
change of attitude toward school work that often is striking. 
The discipline work with these children largely disappears, 
they become mentally much more alert, their appearance is 
better, they increase in weight and height and chest expan- 
sion, they take a new interest in play, their school work 
materially improves, and the percentage of non-promotions 
among them is very materially reduced. Measured by the 
cost for repeaters in the school, the school feeding gives large 
returns. 
In schools having regular open-air schoolrooms, these, 
coupled with studied school feeding, often render large 
service with children of tubercular tendencies. In warm 
climates, such as Florida and Southern California, the open- 
air or partially open-air room usually gives good results for 
all children. Recent experiments, though, seem to cast 
much doubt on the value of open-air rooms in cold climates, 
and rather emphasize the importance of well-ventilated and 
properly-heated schoolrooms of the ordinary type. 
First-aid work. Other lines of health work than those in- 
dicated above may be carried on by a principal and a body 
of interested teachers, without the aid of professional health 
service, or even a school nurse. One of the easiest of these 
\ines is that of first-aid work, in the care of accidents. 
A school without accidents would indeed be a curiosity. 
Accidents are constantly happening about every school — 
small cuts of fingers, usually done in the manual training
-P-A-G-E-249
  HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 233 
rooms or in the elementary sloyd work; burns, in the cooking 
room; scratches and bruises of head, arms, hands, and feet 
on the playground; stubbed toes; bumped and bleeding 
noses; toothache; fainting; chills; frozen ears, fingers, and 
feet; serious jolts or cuts, made by ball bats, or in falls from 
the apparatus; and occasional broken bones and epileptic 
fits. 
To care for such accidents and illness every school should 
have some provision for caring for the injuries of the pupils. 
There should be a rest room, fitted with a plain rattan or 
leather couch, on which a sick teacher or pupil may be laid. 
There should also be blankets, hot water bottles, and gran- 
ite iron basins for use. Hot water, or a quick means of heat- 
ing water, should also be at hand. If the building has no 
such room, and old buildings usually do not, then the princi- 
pal’s office should be so arranged that it can be made use of 
for the purpose. 
In addition there should be in every school at least one 
first-aid cabinet or case, in which are to be found needed 
supplies for first-aid and emergency work. Many schools 
have one on each floor, easily reached, as well as one in the 
rest or nurse’s room. Partial supplies are also often found 
in the manual training shop, to care for minor accidents 
there on the spot. If the school department does not and 
will not provide such equipment, then the principal, through 
health teaching, Boy and Girl Scouts, and Parent-Teacher 
meetings, should awaken enough interest in having these 
things that they will be provided by gifts or obtained by 
purchase from the proceeds of entertainments given for the 
purpose. 
The first-aid case. With the spread of the industrial- 
accident insurance idea by reason of state legislation, the 
first-aid case can now easily be bought complete. Usually, 
for school use, it is better to have it made and organized at
-P-A-G-E-250
  234 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the school, under the direction of the school nurse or some 
teacher. The pupils can then be made to understand why 
the different things are included, and how to prepare a some- 
what similar kit for home use. The first-aid case should 
contain at least the following: 
. Rolls of absorbent cotton. 
. Rolls of sterile gauze. 
. Several bandages, of assorted sizes, triangular and roll. 
. Spools of surgeon’s zinc-oxide adhesive tape, of different 
widths.

The emergency books will give the necessary routine that 
can be studied and followed at once. In addition, the prin- 
cipal should have on a card on the case door the telephone 
calls of the nearest doctors who will respond to such cases, 
and the nearest ambulance, in case either should be needed. 
The telephone call of the school nurse and school physician, 
where such are not stationed at the school, and of the city 
health department when it performs such services, should 
also be at hand. It is also a good idea to have four or five
-P-A-G-E-251
HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 235 
eighth-grade pupils trained as assistants for emergency 
work, who should respond to calls and: 
1. Notify the home, if this should be done. 
2. Call doctor or nurse, as needed. 
8. Stay with the pupil, and assist. 
4, Make up card data of accident for principal’s records. 
5. Accompany a sick or injured pupil home. 
First-aid teaching in the school. Training for emergency 
work and accident prevention should begin by the fifth 
grade, and should continue on up through the grades. The 
purpose is not only to care for simple accidents at once, but 
also to teach hygienic practices and procedure in the most 
effective manner. Demonstration first-aid work should be 
given ‘in all rooms each year from the fifth grade up, and the 
pupils may well have explained to them the make-up and 
use of each article in the first-aid kit. One main idea is to 
have the principles of good health service carry over into 
the homes and stay by the pupils for life. Where this work 
is well done it is not uncommon, as a result of what the 
children carry home, for parents to ask that the school 
nurse, or some teacher, give a demonstration at a Parent- 
Teacher meeting. 
The following suggestions will prove of value in the con- 
duct of the work in a school. 
1. Begin by taking precaution against injury. Teach with a 
view to accident and disease prevention. A recent little 
book, Hygiene for the Worker, offers the material for good in- 
struction. 
2. Emphasize the safety-first idea, and make definite use of the 
og hom Girl Scouts along this line, as well as in first-aid 
work. 
. Emphasize good posture, and its relation to good health. 
. Have the school nurse, or if there be none some teacher, give 
demonstrations in first-aid methods, including, bandaging, in 
each grade from the fifth up, each year. Later have the Boy 
Scouts give demonstrations. em 09

236 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
5. Train the older pupils to clean bruises and cuts and simple in- 
juries, and to bandage them. 
6. If in a river or seaport town, train in resuscitation from 
drowning. 
7. Emphasize everywhere the proper care of cuts, bruises, bleed- 
ing of the nose, fainting, toothache, etc., and the importance 
of attention to minor injuries. 
8. Make the school nurse serviceable, but see that she works un- 
der definite rules, not too restrictive in type, but clearly speci- 
fying her field of work. 
9. While treating minor injuries and cases of illness, be careful to 
exclude the serious ones. For these call a physician at once 
and get in touch with the home. [If a child is not in need of 
immediate medication, as in case of fits, call an ambulance or 
taxi, and send the child home. Usually the police ambulance 
can be summoned and used without cost. : 
Keep a card or book record of all cases handled, the same 
to include name, date, time, nature of case, treatment, and 
disposition of. This data can be filled out quickly, often by 
pupils, on printed forms or cards which should be provided. 
Such a record may be useful in case of trouble, and a study 
of cases may help to reveal causes of the more frequent acci- 
dents, and means for preventing some of them. As an ex- 
ample of such a study and instruction, one of our larger 
school systems (Detroit) was able in one year to reduce its 
accidents as follows:

Reductions: Fatal, 79 to 40; serious, 140 to 71: minor, 591 to $48, 
Such a record means that by accident-prevention instruc- 
tion, and notwithstanding a rapid increase in the total num-
-P-A-G-E-253
HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 237 
ber of children enrolled and the number of automobiles 
registered, the number of fatal and serious accidents in the 
city was cut in half, and the minor ones reduced two fifths. 
Stated otherwise it means that 39 more children were alive 
at the end of the year than would have been the case if the 
accident teaching had not been undertaken, 69 children 
were saved from confinement to bed and possibly a crip- 
pled existence, and 249 were saved from minor injuries and 
resultant shock. 
Utilizing the Scouts. The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts 
(or Camp Fire Girls) organizations can be made very useful 
in teaching hygiene, personal care, first-aid work, and acci- 
dent prevention, and in helping care for those who are sick 
or have been hurt. By proper management these Scouts 
can be trained to help in teaching the use of the playground 
apparatus; to point out the dangers and danger line for 
swings, rings, bars, teeters, etc.; and to be a strong influence 
for order and fair play on the playground, with a view to re- 
ducing crowding, roughness, and accidents. They can also 
be used to advantage in taking care of the sick and injured, 
attending to some of the first-aid work, keeping records, 
and in accompanying the sick or injured home. Dem- 
onstrations of accident-prevention, safety-first work, and 
first-aid methods given before a school or class are excellent. 
Bailey’s Sure Pop and the Safety Scouts is a good supple- 
mental reader for use with the lower grades. 
The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations are too val- 
uable not to be utilized to the full. The principal ought to 
have studied Scouting, served as a Scout Master, and be a 
member of the Troup Committee. Some of the teachers 
ought to have had equivalent experience with the girls. The 
members of these organizations should then be utilized to as- 
sist the teachers and the principal in organizing safety pa- 
trols, whose duties would be to guard street intersections 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
238 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
when children are passing or at play; to rope off the streets 
and direct traffic at mornings, noons, and recesses, when 
this is permitted by the city authorities; to help smaller 
children at crossings; to help organize the pupils for codpera- 
tion in safety-first and first-aid work; to codperate in the 
fire drills; to report any dangerous conditions anywhere to 
the principal; to help remove or guard injurious obstruc- 
tions, or protruding nails, or open manholes; and to make 
reports of accidents to the principal. 
The “Big Brother” and “Big Sister” idea can also be 
made helpful in securing easy supervision of the little chil- 
dren by the older ones. This can be handled so as to be 
made an effective teaching instrument, and yet so that no 
one will lose any of the joy and freedom of spontaneous play. 
Organization of a school health department. The same idea 
is carried out in some schools through the organization of 
the school into departments, such as police, judicial, health, 
etc. The health department then takes partial charge of the 
health, cleanliness, sanitation, accident prevention and care, 
and similar functions about the school and playground and 
streets. There isa chief health officer, selected from the high- 
est grade, with assistants for playgrounds, toilets, streets, 
and building service. There are also room health officers, 
from the third or fourth grade up, to look after the morning 
inspection and to assist the teacher in her health work. The 
whole department is under the supervision of some one 
teacher, who keeps an eye on what is being done, advises 
and suggests, stimulates enthusiasm, receives reports, and 
handles cases requiring special attention. 
In the morning room inspections, directions from the 
room health officer to go to the washroom and clean hands, 
comb hair, or wash the face are received and acted on much 
better than if given by the teacher. Still more, the pupil- 
work is so effective in results that there is soon little to at-
-P-A-G-E-255
  HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 289 
tend to. Children who have “temperature” and look sick 
are segregated by the teacher, and taken to the nurse or 
principal by the room health officer. Children absent and 
reported ill are looked up by the health officer, and reported 
to the nurse or principal. In case of a child being cut, 
bruised, or hurt while at play or about the building, or if he 
becomes ill, one of the health department officers has him 
brought to the rest room for treatment by the teacher in 
charge. After treatment, the injured or sick child is often 
taken home by this same officer. 
The children in such schools are very proud of being se- 
lected for office in the health department. Election to this 
board can be made both an honor and a reward for profi- 
ciency in health work. The idea, like that of the Scouts, 
can be made to contribute much to teaching health habits, 
the idea of “service,” and to the development of an excel- 
lent school spirit. 
Junior Health Leagues. In some of our school systems 
excellent results have been obtained by the organization of 
what are known as Junior Health Leagues in each of the 
elementary schoolrooms. 
Once each week the pupils of each room elect a health of- 
ficer from among their number for the following week. This 
officer wears a badge, showing his authority. It is his duty 
during the week to look after the general health conditions 
of the rooms, halls, and grounds. A blank report sheet is 
furnished which is filled out at the close of the week, and 
copies of this filled-out report are placed in the hands of the 
principal and the city or school health officer. On this 
blank, among other items, the junior health officer for each 
room reports the following: The temperature of the room, 
taken three times a day; the cleanliness of floors and walls 
in room and halls; the quality and method of dusting by the 
janitor; the lighting of the room; the ventilation; condition
-P-A-G-E-256
240 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
of the drinking facilities; condition of toilets and grounds; 
and possibly afew otheritems. A record of absentees is also 
kept for the week, and, in cases of sickness and disease, an 
accurate report is given, noting especially the prevalence of 
any contagious disease. That part of the report relating to 
absentees may be given to the attendance department, and 
that on health to the health department. The janitor is 
also furnished a copy as it relates to his work. 
The reports in themselves may not be of much value, but 
the chief benefit in the plan is the training it gives the chil- 
dren, and through them the home, in forming habits of 
observing and correcting unsanitary conditions. Another 
benefit is that it causes the teacher to be conscious of gen- 
eral conditions. The school health officer can handle the 
ventilation, working under general rules, usually better than 
the teachers will attend to it. In attending to the duties of 
instruction she frequently neglects to give proper attention 
to health conditions. 
Not the least of the advantages of the plan is that it en-_ 
ables a follow-up system to be carried on by the health and 
truancy officers. The children usually delight in acting as 
active junior health officers, and take an interest in the work. 
It frequently leads to an improvement of both attendance 
and health conditions that the teachers alone would not be 
able to secure. The fact that these officers are given some 
authority, and are encouraged to exercise initiative in the 
performance of their duties, furnishes an opportunity for 
no mean training in itself. The pupils often get results with 
ease that a principal would find difficulty in securing. 
The Junior Red Cross. The Junior Red Cross is another 
excellent organization that principals and teachers should 
make use of in the work of the school. Realizing that the 
hope of the future lies with the children, the American Red 
Cross has organized the Junior Division, so that school
-P-A-G-E-257
  
HEALTH AND SANITARY CONTROL 241 
children may be trained early in health ideas and in the 
habit of service. When school children are given an oppor- 
tunity to understand how other children live, to learn what 
is their proper share of the world’s work, and to codperate 
in large plans for a better and happier childhood the world 
over, they have taken a long step toward good citizenship 
and toward world peace and good will. 
Through codperation in constructive undertakings, mu- 
tual service, helpful community work, clean-up campaigns, 
promotion of health knowledge, enforcement of health regu- 
lations, participation in civic and patriotic movements, 
making toys and hospital equipment for distribution at 
home and abroad, and in helping to clothe, feed, nurse, and 
educate thousands of suffering children in Europe and Asia, 
this organization of children is rendering a service that will 
do much to give the children a world outlook of large pos- 
sibilities, develop higher ideals of citizenship, do much to 
alleviate suffering and eradicate disease, and carry Ameri- 
can altruistic service to new heights. 
The Junior Red Cross did very important service during 
the World War, but in places has lost its importance since 
the close of the struggle. Where the school has focused its 
efforts anew on some home undertaking its importance has 
on the contrary increased. No better form of “project 
teaching” could be devised than some of the codperative 
home work done by this organization. One of the best 
of the many which have recently been described has been 
the work of the children of Spokane, Washington, working 
in codperation, by schools. There a clinic and five-bed 
hospital for the care of children suffering from remediable 
defects and too poor to pay, was first established and sup- 
ported. The removal of adenoids and tonsils were the main 
operations. Much of the fitting up of the hospital was done 
by the boys in their manual training and the girls in their 
Rt Mek

  242 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
sewing. The next addition, a year later, was the provision 
of a full-time nurse for nutrition work among the children. 
A year after this, when the Supreme Court forbade the ex- 
penditure of school money for a dental clinic, the children 
took this over and employed a full-time dentist to care for 
the children’s teeth. That the work has made a strong ap- 
peal to the children is evidenced by an increase in member- 
ship, in the four years following the War, of from 48 per 
cent to 75.6 per cent of the enrollment of children in the 
public schools of the city. Such work has very large val- 
ues in teaching codperation and service and in training for 
citizenship, wholly aside from its large value as health work. 
Every school could well be enrolled as a Junior Red Cross 
Auxiliary, and receive and make use of, in teaching history, 
geography, English, and civics, the Junior Red Cross News 
which comes with membership in the organization. Full 
information as to this can be obtained from the American 
Red Cross, Department of Junior Red Cross, Washington, 
D.C., or from local state and county directors. 
The school nurse and health supervision. Every large 
school should have the services of a part-time or full-time 
nurse, and the partial services of a school physician as well. 
This, though, many cities and towns do aot provide, and in 
many smaller cities no health service is furnished. Some- 
times even a first-aid case is refused. In such cities the 
Parent-Teacher Association is a good center with which 
the principal may begin a propaganda for some form of 
health service. In some of the larger cities having “Visit- 
ing Nurse Associations,” or “Health Centers,” or *‘Out- 
Patient Dispensaries,’ a nurse can be obtained for part- 
time school service. If so, this service is an excellent one to 
utilize when the school department does not provide the 
needed aid. 
If but little can be had at first, it is better to start with

the partial services of a school nurse. In making routine 
schoolroom inspection, in the detection of contagious dis- 
eases in the early stages, in looking after minor injuries, in 
assisting in the direction of any school feeding, and in giving 
instruction to teachers and children in first-aid work, the 
school nurse has repeatedly proved her high efficiency. One 
very good explanation for this is that a school nurse prob- 
ably meets with more cases of whooping cough, measles, 
mumps, and cut fingers and heads in a good-sized school in 
two or three months than an ordinary practicing physician 
would deal with in a decade. Much contagious disease is 
detected in its very beginnings, and excluded before much 
harm has been done; cases of malnutrition can be looked 
after; help given in physical examinations; homes can be 
visited and advised and follow-up work done; and many 
health defects can be attended to, both in the school and 
followed up in the home. To influence parents to provide 
medical attention for their children is usually 110 small task. 
Often the parents are poor and object to the expense: 
Many have strong prejudices against glasses for their chil- 
dren. Many resent being told that they do not feed or clothe 
their children properly. Much time and tact and patience 
often are required to get results. This home work is very 
important, though, as almost every extreme disciplinary 
case is found to have some serious physical defect back of it, 
and after correction of such defect marked improvement 
usually results. 
A professional school health service. In school systems 
where a professional school health service is provided the 
principal can turn over to it many of the problems that in a 
school less well equipped he must look after largely alone. 
If this health work is to render its greatest service, those di- 
recting it should have passed in their thinking beyond the 
stage of mere disease detection, though this will always
-P-A-G-E-260
244 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
remain an important feature of the work; and beyond mere 
physical examinations, though these should be given; and 
should conceive of the service as preventive more than re- 
medial, and should lay the emphasis on the preservation of 
health even more than on the elimination of disease. Such 
a service calls for: 
1. The detection of incipient disease, and especially contagious 
disease. 
2. Careful physical examinations yearly, to detect hidden de- 
fects. 
8. The establishment of free medical and dental service for those 
unable to provide such. f 
4, Systematic mstruction throughout the grades in matters of 
health and bodily care. 
. Some attention to play activities and athletics. 
. Some instruction to teachers in health matters. 
. Improvement of the janitorial service, with special reference 
to heating, lighting, ventilation, and school housekeeping. 
. School feeding. 
. Some attention to speech defects. 
. Organized extension work, through nurses, designed to im- 
prove conditions surrounding children in their homes 
IDO 
Soo 
School health work of this larger type goes far beyond 
what is commonly thought of under “medical inspection,” 
and may well be termed “health and development supervi- 
sion.”’ Its aim is to focus attention not only on the preven- 
tion of disease, but also on the development of as high a de- 
gree of physical efficiency as possible. A principal who has 
the assistance of such a complete health service is fortunate 
indeed, and he should codperate loyally in the carrying out 
of such a health policy.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 
A universal problem. The problem of securing good and 
prompt attendance in school on the part of the pupils is one 
with which every principal has to deal. Much of the ease or 
difficulty of the problem will of course be determined by the 
nature of the community in which the school is located 
and by the character of the people who form the patrons 
of the school. In some places the sentiment for education 
is strong, and the parents readily and fully support the 
principal and teachers in their efforts to. have the pupils in 
school on time each day. In such communities the task of 
regulating attendance is easy. In other communities no 
such sentiment is general, and the task of the principal and 
teachers is one that calls for continual vigilance and at times 
an appeal to authority. 
Because irregular attendance is such an important cause 
of retardation and ultimate elimination from school, because 
the irregular pupil becomes such a drag on the class on ac- 
count of what he has missed, and because truancy and tardi- 
ness are bad habits and tend to undermine the discipline and 
morals of a school, it is important that the principal give 
careful attention to the matter of attendance. Jt is a prob- 
lem upon which he may easily be led to spend much time; 
therefore it is important that he systematize his procedure 
so as to handle the work both expeditiously and effectively. 
Causes of irregular attendance. While the poverty of 
parents, sickness, and a desire to put children to work are 
common causes of absence from school, these are, after all, 
not the serious causes. They can generally be easily re- 
moyed or controlled. Among the children of foreign-born  
-P-A-G-E-264
  248 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
parents ignorance of the law is often a cause, but when the 
law and its penalties are once made clear to them this class 
usually makes little trouble thereafter. Irregular attendance 
commonly comes from a relatively small number of fam- 
ilies, and much. more trouble from both tardiness and irreg- 
ular attendance is usually experienced from the children of 
native-born families than from the children of the foreign- 
born. 
While in some cases the prime cause of the trouble lies in 
the home, the great source of irregular attendance, though, 
lies rather ip_the~school itself Statistical studies have 
clearly shown that the majority of pupils leaving the school 
before completing its work do so because of a lack of interest 
in the school itself.. Neither they nor their parents feel that 
the school is of much value for them. Studies of truancy 
show the same reasons. To the truant the school work lacks 
interest and vitality, the companionship found in the school 
and on the playground does not appeal, and often the upper- 
grade work at least is not well adapted to his needs. 
It is perhaps not too much to say that the holding and 
drawing power of a school is one of the measurable stand- 
ards by which its efficiency may be judged. Many things, 
though, contribute to the creation of a strong holding and 
drawing power. Some of these are external to the particular 
school itself, such as the character of the community, its at- 
titude toward education, the nature of the school census, 
the compulsory attendance law, and the character of the 
compulsory attendance service. Others are characteristic 
of the school system as a whole, such as the organization of 
the instruction, the types of school work offered, the empha- 
sis placed on different aspects of the instruction, and the 
types of teachers employed. Still others lie wholly within 
the school itself, such as attention given to the problem, 
‘motivation of the school work, and the development of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 249 
school spirit, and for these the principal must be held re- 
sponsible. 
Handling the problem. Plans in use for handling the at- 
tendance problem vary somewhat from city to city, depend- 
ing in part on the size and character of the city and in part 
on the conception of the attendance problem held by the 
state and city educational authorities. In a general way 
they vary from lax to strict enforcement, and from an em- 
phasis on compulsion from without to motivation from 
within. Every principal will naturally have to adjust him- 
self somewhat to the regulations and plans in force in the 
state and city in which he works, so that any description as 
to desirable methods can only be applied where the princi- 
pal is given a rather free hand. Assuming that the princi- 
pal is allowed a certain amount of initiative, the suggestions 
which follow ought to prove helpful. 
To secure a quick and effective handling of the problem 
by the use of commonplace methods, the principal needs 
some simple device for securing, sorting, reporting, and re- 
cording information. This will involve checking the school 
census at the beginning of the year, a daily classroom check, 
good relations with the compulsory-attendance officer, and 
teacher and pupil relations. 
Checking the school census. In handling the school at- 
tendance problem it is quite important to get as early a 
start on it as is'possible. If the city has an even fairly accu- 
rate school census it is possible to get a good check of all 
pupils the first week of school. If a school can get the 
children started properly in September, non-attendance can 
be kept down throughout the year. 
Schools to-day are usually supplied with a “Census List” 
of the pupils who reside within the school district lines. 
Sometimes this is in card form, in which case the cards are 
easily sorted, and sometimes the names occur on slips, or
-P-A-G-E-266
  - 250 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
sheet lists. If the principal has been in the school before 
and knows his district, a preliminary survey of it in the 
days just preceding the opening of the school will be helpful 
by way of noting new families in the district. 
The first day of school a registration card should be filled 
out by or for each pupil, giving name, age, grade, parent, 
and residence, and, if new to the school, school last at- 
tended, in city or elsewhere.. These ought to be checked 
up the first night against the school census lists. In doing 
so the principal will find his cards falling into three piles, 
or classes. 
1. Children whose names are on the census lists and who are in 
school. 
2. Children whose names are on the census list but who are not 
in school. 
3. Children whose names are not on the census list but who are 
in school. 
Class 2 will include children whose parents have left the city : 
or have moved to some other school district in the city, 
children who have gone to the high school, children who 
have not as yet returned from their summer vacation, and 
children who are staying out of school and need looking up. 
Class 3 will include children whose parents have moved into 
the city or the district, and children belonging to some other 
district who are trying to “sneak” into the school. For 
new children census cards should be made out for filing in 
the school records, and for reporting to the attendance office. 
Locating the missing ones. After school on the first 
Wednesday afternoon the principals of all schools in the city 
should meet to check up their new and missing children. 
Where children are found to have moved during the sum- 
mer, and have hence entered the school in their proper dis- 
trict, permanent record cards are exchanged.) Where chil- 
dren are attempting to get into another school outside their
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 251 
distict, without transfer or permission from the superin- 
tendtgt, their names are exchanged and the children are sent 
to th¢r proper school the next morning. Children in the 
high Shool are checked off all lists. This leaves on each 
list th, names of those children who have either left town or 
havryailed to enter school. These names the principal takes 
brk to his school and divides among his teachers and him- 
self to be investigated. This does not give any one person 
a very large number of names, and by the end of the week 
every child of compulsory school-attendance age on the cen- 
sus list can be accounted for in some way. The telephone 
may be used in some cases. Pupils from the same street 
may give useful information. A call often reveals a legiti- 
mate excuse. Sometimes the parents merely need to have 
the law explained to them. New families should also be 
looked after and checked. The teachers and principals, by 
persuasion or mention of the law, thus get the most of those 
out of school but still in the city back into school. Those 
who Have moved into another school district and are not 
iu school ar» reported to the principal of that school. Those 
Y= have moved out of the city are struck off the census 
list. “hose who have gone to a private or a parochial 
school ® so checked, and the attendance officer deals with 
such schoo «thereafter for the attendance of these children.

should be in su.so] and who fail to appear by the following 
Monday rorningas well as all for whom information is lack- 
ing or uncertain, @ then given to the attendance officer to 
roundup. Usually th.e are but few cases left to be investi- 
gated, and the attenda.e officer gets the difficult cases to 
handle right at the start This is a great advantage over 
the plan of reporting all esos to him and causing him to 
waste days in investigating sitpje cases, while the really 
hard ones are not reached for weks, Under this plan the

principal and teachers handle the easy ones, and the seond 
week the attendance officer can reach the difficult ones By 
the end of the second week the docket is cleared, and fe of- 
ficer is ready to go after the first cases of truancy an¢ 2On- 
attendance reported from the schools. 
The daily classroom check. Having located the chidren 
thus early, a rapid, simple, and effective means for checkit$ 
absences each day and half-day throughout the year is now 
desirable. One means, commonly used, is to have each 
teacher send to the office of the principal a printed slip form, 
on which the teacher writes the names of pupils absent and 
any information she may have as to the cause for the ab- 
sence. These slips then have to be tabulated onto cards, 
and the names sorted out under the headings of probably 
tardy, probably truant, sick, and unclassified. While this 
can be done rather rapidly, and if the principal has an office 
clerk it can be attended to by her, it is still more complicated 
than need be. 
The simplest form which the writer has ever seen, and at 
the same time the most effective, is the one given on the o* 
posite page. For this plan the school needs printed @rds, 
8% X 11 inchesin size, printed on good cardboard. ‘hereisa 
card for each room in the school, and each card * used for a 
month. The cards are placed on the teacher desks daily 
before 9.00 and 1.00, by a monitor, who go” to the princi- 
pal’s office for them, they being placed reoiarly ipa definite 
box or placé for him. Each teacher prils in on the cards 
the absentees, and room monitors +¢ them back to the 
principal’s office by or before 9.¥ and 1.15 daily. The 
teachers write on the front or ba of the card only with a 
pencil, and the principal only wi ink. One card thus coy- 
ers all cases of tardiness»¢ absence for each room for a 
month, and at the endf the month is filed in a letter-file 
case. As alabor-savindevice this monthly attendance rec-

  254 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ord is excellent, and for a principal without an office clerk 
it is by far the simplest form to use. One of its special mer- 
its is that everything for a month is before one and may be 
seen at a glance, without the necessity of sorting out slips or 
hunting up cards. Individual cumulative record cards may 
be made up from this record form, at any time, as desired. 
All of this, with blanks and a little system, requires less 
time to handle than it takes to describe it, and makes the ad- 
ministration of the attendance records quick and automatic 
and easy for all concerned. Transfers, removals, truancy, 
and sickness are easily discovered, with the result that rec- 
ords are kept more accurately and non-attendance is de- 
creased. 
Some principles to be followed. In the absence of specific 
rules directing otherwise, the following plan will be found to 
be workable. 
1. Each teacher is to keep a record of the daily attendance of 
each pupil, in a register provided for that purpose. 
2. Each teacher is to handle cases of tardiness, subject to such 
oversight as the principal sees fit to give. 
8. There is ordinarily little reason for requiring a tardy pupil to 
go first to the principal’s office and wait for his permission be- 
forecoming tohisroom. Get the pupil into class and at work 
as quickly as possible, and attend to excuses afterward. 
4, Pupils not present at a designated time are to be reported on 
slips or cards, to the office, as outlined above. 
5. In reporting pupils absent, teachers should give an opinion or 
guess, if illness or truancy is suspected. 
6. Teachers should make an effort to find out from others why 
pupils are absent, and when found out, state reasons on sub- 
sequent reports. 
7. Teachers should avoid making so much of the evil of tardiness 
thata pupil, especially in the lower grades, will go back home 
rather than be tardy. 
8. Excuse those from work missed on account of sickness only 
until they shall have had time to make it up, and those absent 
without a satisfactory excuse must make up the work lost out-
-P-A-G-E-271
  an 
5 wag 
THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 255 
side of hours. ‘Those excused may be helped on back work; 
those not excused to receive a zero on the time lost. 
9. Excuses for tardiness and absence should first go to the 
teacher, and may be referred to the principal later, if she thinks 
it desirable or necessary. In the case of absences caused by ~ 
truancy, or some form of pupil negligence, it often has a very 
wholesome effect if the pupil has to take the excuse to the 
principal and secure his approval. This should be done, 
though, at his office periods, or at intermissions. 
10. *Vhen new pupils enter, or pupils leave or are transferred, 
the attendance officer should be notified accordingly. 
11. Keep in mind that the machinery of attendance is only a 
means to an end, and that results often depend more on the 
attitude toward promptness and regularity assumed by the 
principal and teachers than upon compulsory enforcement. 
12. It is well to establish helpful relations with the police as re- 
gards attendance. If pupils inclined to play truant know that 
a number of persons in authority are likely to be looking for 
them, they will be more careful about their absences. 
It must be remembered that the prime purpose of all reg- 
ulations and machinery for attendance-enforcement is to 
try to establish habits of punctuality and regularity in at- 
tendance at school. This is done more for the future value 
of such habits to the pupil than for bringing up the average 
attendance, desirable as this may be. Something can be ac- 
complished by using certain devices to stimulate attend- 
ance, much by building up a school spirit that will make pu- 
pils want to come to school promptly and regularly, and in 
a few cases something by an impartial and effective enforce- 
ment of the compulsory education law. 
Devices for stimulating attendance. The main idea un- 
derlying the use of all devices for stimulating attendance is 
that of placing a premium on regularity rather than. the 
penalizing of delinquency. An attempt is made to render a 
motive from within more effective than a danger from with- 
out. To this end numerous devices are used by schools, 
among which should be mentioned: 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  256 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
1. The placing and keeping of lists of pupils on the blackboards of 
the different rooms, with a star for each month or week in 
which the pupils have been neither absent nor tardy. Dia- 
grams and charts which compare the room records with other 
rooms, and the school with other schools, are often useful. 
2. The use of banners or pennants, one to be awarded to each 
room having a perfect-attendance score for the week or month, 
and a champion-room pennant to be held for a month by the 
room having the best attendance for the preceding month. 
A similar champion-school pennant may be used, to be flown 
from the flagpole by the school in the city having the highest 
attendance score, month by month. If the awarding and 
hanging of these banners or pennants are administered by a 
student organization, added interest in attendance is awak- 
ened. 
8. The publication of lists, in the local papers, at the end of each 
term or year, of all pupils who have not been absent or tardy 
during the designated period. 
4, Having student officers, such as the health officer or the police 
officer, take the attendance for the rooms from third or fourth 
grade up; make out the “missing lists,” subject to the ap- 
proval of the teacher; and have them find out, so far as can 
be done, why pupils are tardy or absent. Student pressure to 
keep up a room average is often far more effective than any 
other kind. When this plan is coupled with pennants, and per- 
fect attendance is made much of by the school authorities, 
these student organizations often effectively round up most of 
the habitual cases. Sometimes the school has even to inter- 
pose to prevent the offender from being too severely handled 
by the other boys. 
5. Sometimes very effective results can be obtained by making 
attendance officers of some of the offending pupils, thus plac- 
ing responsibility directly on them. 
6. Where credits for home work are given, these should be made 
dependent upon the attendance record. 
7. Pupils arriving tardy are required to remain after dismissal 
in the afternoon to make up all time lost — sometimes time 
and a half or double time is required. 
Some schools give an early dismissal once a month, and some 
even a partial holiday to those pupils or rooms having a per- 
fect or nearly perfect score. This plan is open to rather seri- 
ous educational objections, however. A much better plan is g
-P-A-G-E-273
  THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 257 
to permit the substitution of something unusual to the quali- 
fying rooms, such as a special school “mqvie,” a school ex- 
cursion to some point of special interest, or a nature study 
trip, in place of part or all of the last Friday afternoon’s work. 
9. Interesting opening exercises are often very useful. Reading 
a good story serially, having pupils take part in the exercises, 
singing songs which the children like, the use of the victrola, 
and selections by the orchestra are some of the other means 
which may be employed. In schools having an assembly hall 
the assembly period can be made very attractive. 
Most of these devices, while working well with the major- 
ity of the children, often fail to reach the calloused, habitual 
offenders. In plans where the pupils of a room or school 
become interested collectively in the attendance problem, 
because of an awakened school pride or to win some prize or 
to secure some reward, the children themselves often find 
some means of rounding up and bringing in these habitual 
offenders. To assign to such persons some distinctive duty 
which requires regularity, such as putting up the school 
flag, ringing the bells, playing in the orchestra, inspecting 
and reporting on the toilets and playground, reporting the 
room attendance, or some form of service or monitorial duty, 
usually acts as a very effective stimulant. 
In most cases where habitual truancy occurs, a careful 
health examination should be made; often bad physical con- 
ditions will be found which may largely explain the delin- 
quency. Wherever physical examinations of habitual tru- 
ants have been made a surprisingly large percentage of 
remediable defects, such as nasal obstructions, defective eye- 
sight, bad tonsils, and similar disorders, have been found to 
exist. Sometimes improper or deficient feeding is the cause 
of the trouble. 
Principal and teachers and the home. Along with all 
such devices the principal and teachers should stand for a 
positive policy as to the importance of punctuality and reg-
-P-A-G-E-274
  258 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL , 
ularity as life habits, without which the pupils can hardly 
hope to succeedsin the business world. This conception will 
often have to be éxtended to the homes. To require excuses 
in writing, and, when the validity of the excuse is doubtful, 
to impress upon pupil and parent that irregular attendance 
is certain to interfere with the child’s progress and chances 
for promotion will be necessary in many cases. A talk on 
this subject to the Parent-Teacher meeting, illustrated by 
charts and figures giving the results of studies of irregularity 
in attendance on promotions and school progress, will often 
prove helpful. 
All possible codperation between the school and the home 
should be established, leading as it does to better results 
and the avoidance of friction. In the matter of enforcing 
attendance a common method is to notify the attendance 
officer the first day a pupil is absent, and he then goes to 
the home and finds the reason for the absence. Possibly 
the child is sick, possibly there is sickness in the family, 
possibly he has been kept at home to render some service 
which seemed important, and possibly it is a real case of 
“playing hookey.’’ Whatever the cause, the home often 
resents the visit and a feeling of antagonism is engendered. 
Not infrequently the home comes to take the attitude that 
the school is meddling in matters that are none of its 
business, and that to be able to outwit the school is quite 
legitimate. The pupil thus acquires an attitude from the 
home that is anti-social and vicious. 
On the other hand, if the principal and teachers try to 
know something of the home, and show a genuine interest in 
the children and in the family as a whole, in most cases they 
win the family as well as the children and make of all loyal 
supporters of the school. In many places, to-day, principals 
and teachers and nurses are making an effort to know every 
home that sends a child to the school. When such relations
-P-A-G-E-275
  
  THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 259 
have been established and a pupil is absent, instead of send- 
ing an officer to the door, the principal or teacher can often 
handle the case by an inquiry through some pupil, or by a 
personal call. The latter can in most cases be made as the 
exhibition of a friendly interest, and will be appreciated 
where the visit of an officer would be resented. Often both 
parent and child may be won by such methods not only to 
reasonably satisfactory attendance, but also as supporters 
of the social order for which the school really stands. 
This does not mean the substitution of easy or slip shod 
methods for definite records and follow-up methods in at- 
tendance matters. It merely means the use of gentle 
methods first without making a display of all the authority 
of the school. 
The visiting teacher. There has recently been introduced 
into our school organization a new type of helper with the 
difficult cases, intermediate between the teacher on the one 
hand and the social worker on the other, and known as the 
Visiting Teacher. Beginning in 1906-07, in three of our 
American cities, and as yet confined to some fifty or sixty 
of the larger ones, the services rendered have proved so use- 
ful and helpful that it is not unreasonable to expect that in 
time such a personage will be found connected with each 
small city school system, and with groups of schools or large 
individual schools in our larger cities. 
Such a teacher has an office and office hours, in the school 
building or at the central office, according to the scope of 
the service rendered, and to her are referred, for investiga- 
tion and handling, the difficult pupil-cases the school work 
reveals. Children irregular in attendance, children unable 
to make necessary social adjustments in the school, children 
deficient in scholarship, cases of probable home neglect or 
underfeeding, cases involving moral delinquency or serious 
discipline, and sometimes the cases of precocious children,
-P-A-G-E-276
  260 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
are referred to the visiting teacher for special investigation 
and report. For each case a card is made out, the visiting 
teacher sees the child and talks with the teacher, visits the 
home, sees the parent, analyzes the case, tries to gain the 
family confidence, when necessary secures the codperation 
of other social agencies in the community, represents the 
school in relations with the home and the home in relations 
with the school, suggests readjustments or changes in school 
work, follows up the case much as does the visiting nurse 
her cases, and occasionally enforces the law to protect the 
child. Visiting teachers thus come into such close and inti- 
mate relations with the homes that not infrequently, at office 
hours, the visiting teacher finds awaiting her, for further 
help, some mother whom she once advised in a case that has 
been “‘closed.” 
Such a visiting teacher, connected with a school or a 
group of schools, such as a supervisory group, can be of very 
large assistance to teachers and principal in helping them to 
handle their most difficult and mos: time-consuming prob- 
lems, thus saving their time for the more important work of 
instruction. Such a teacher, in part due to training, special 
personal qualifications, a specialization of functions, and 
more and better home visiting, can develop a technique of 
social-case work not possible to the class teacher and to but 
few principals. Each irregular or difficult case becomes a 
special case for individual study and adjustment, and the 
causes underlying the trouble are ascertained and so far as 
possible removed. In smaller cities, and in many schools in 
cities of any size, the work, at least in its beginnings, might 
well be and often is combined with the functions of the school 
or visiting nurse. 
The spirit of the school and attendance. Where no such 
special help is available, which will be in the large majority 
of schools for some time to come, the regularity of attend-
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE ATTENDANCE OF PUPILS 261 
ance will have to depend largely on the attitude and person- 
ality of the principal and teachers who handle the problem. 
The machinery provided by law and by the school board for 
enforcing attendance may be good, but the professional skill 
of the instructing staff will mainly determine its effective- 
ness. A notable falling off in attendance in any one room 
during the early days of the school should be a notice to the 
principal to examine the instruction and general attitude of 
the teacher of that room. 
There is too much of a tendency to consider the attend- 
ance problem chiefly from the standpoint of a rigid enforce- 
ment of the attendance laws. ‘This idea rests in great part 
on a belief that children and parents should be made to feel 
the dignity of the law and fear the penalty of its violation, 
and in part on a feeling that looking up children who fail to 
come to school is not the teacher’s business. In specific 
dealing with attendance cases the principal and teachers 
must consider irregularity in attendance the serious matter 
that it is, and must possess the knack of talking to the pu- 
pils in such a way as to make them also so consider it. In 
passing about in the rooms the principal will do well to 
evince his interest in the problem by complimenting rooms 
in which the attendance is perfect, or especially good in view 
of bad weather conditions or community distractions. 
Children, however, ordinarily like to go to school and like 
the companionship of the other pupils. In most cases they 
await with impatience the day they can start to school, and 
they enjoy the feelings of friendship and interest manifested 
by the principal and teachers of their school. If they later 
lose this feeling for the school, may not the school itself be 
largely to blame? The school work must be made interest- 
ing and vital, and the pupils must be made to like their 
school and to believe in the value for them of what it has to 
give. Making the school work really vital through motiva-
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
tion and intelligent supervision of instruction, attention to 
the play periods, the building up of a strong school spirit, 
making the building and grounds as attractive as possible, 
enlisting the codperation of parents whenever practicable, 
all coupled with a quick and energetic handling of the first 
cases of irregularity that occur, will do much to reduce the 
problem to its lowest terms for any particular school. In 
the absence of an attendance officer it often has a whole- 
some effect on a school if the principal will go out and 
quickly round up a few cases of “hookey,” and bring the 
youngsters in. 
Use of stronger methods. There will still be some cases, 
both of pupils and homes, which cannot be reached by any 
of the above gentler methods. These, once they are clearly 
segregated, should be dealt with promptly and vigorously 
by the attendance officer. But even he should show a hu- 
mane attitude in dealing with the homes. Often he will find 
poverty, sickness in the home, and lack of proper clothing at 
bottom the real cause. He and the principal should be in 
touch with relief organizations that can render help when 
needed. The school nurse and the visiting teacher often 
need to be called in for help. Only the stubborn parent 
should be made to feel the weight of the law. 
The work of enforcing attendance will be made much eas- 
ier for all concerned if the school system has some special 
schools for handling both the incipient and the more stub- 
born cases. Otherwise the enforcement of attendance will 
bring into the classroom many children who gain little of 
value from the school and who often become a nuisance. 
The result is an increase in corporal punishment and retar- 
dation, and a failure, from the citizenship point of view, of the 
school to attain the ends for which the school really stands. 
Without such special classes and schools, expulsion is all 
that is left for those who cannot be brought under control.

One of these rooms should be attached to a number of the \ 
elementary schools of the city, and to this class principals 
should be permitted to send pupils who are breaking from 
the ordinary classroom control, the purpose being, if possi- 
ble, to check the first tendencies to waywardness and to re- 
turn the pupil in time to his regular classroom. Thesecond 
special school is the parental school, to which those who can- ,,” 
not be controlled in the disciplinary class may next be sent. Vv 
The purpose here is to hold the pupil to a routine impossible 
in the home from which he comes, and to try to discover 
upon what interests the building of his character may be 
begun. A third type of school is the central or industrial 
school, a school which disregards grading and courses of 
study and leads toward instruction in the trade or industry 
or occupation in which the pupil may find himself. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Suppose that, the first week of school in the autumn, a new principal 
finds that eight boys from two sixth grades are not in school some nice 
afternoon. What would you suggest that the principal do about it, as- 
suming that the school employs no attendance officer? 
2. How do you explain the greater irregularity of attendance of children 
from good-stock native-born families than from among the foreign 
born? 
8. Do you know of any better plan for checking the school census, 
early in the school term, than the one given on pages 249-51? 
4. Suppose that the city does not employ an attendance officer; what 
plan would then be followed after the preliminary checking of the 
school census? 
5. Doyou take exception to any of the principles stated on pages 254-55, 
and if so to what ones, and why? Would you add any to the list, 
and if so, what new ones? 
6. Can you suggest any additional devices, to those listed on pages 
256-57, for stimulating attendance? 
7. Does the strict attitude of the school toward attendance tend to de- 
velop an anti-social and non-codperative attitude on the part of the 
parents? If so, are there ways of preventing this? 
8, What penalties would you impose for playing hookey, and what aim 
would you have in mind in imposing each?

Inheriting an unruly school. @If irregular attendance and an 
occasional case of “hookey’’ were all the disciplinary dis- 
turbances coming in to interfere with the work of a princi- 
pal, his lot would be an easy onef Unfortunately he will fre- 
quently have much more serious troubles. Even in the best! 
of schools there will be mischief, line trouble, snowballing, ee" 
fighting, petty thefts, and obscenity to deal with, while ina P*” 
school which has become unruly and is largely out of control 
the problem may at first call for an inordinate amount of 
time and attention. While some neighborhoods will, b; 
their nature, call for more disciplmary control than will 
others, a school in any neighborhood which has been sub- 
jected to a harsh and unsympathetic treatment, or to the 
other extreme of indulgence and weakness, will cause a new 
principal disciplinary difficulty until he can bring it under, 
control. His problem then will be to transform an unruly 
into a well-governed school, and this may require some time 
There are many causes for an unruly school, though the a 
two most common are those stated above. A third common 
cause is consistently poor teaching and a type of instruction 
lacking spirit and vitality. Disciplinary weakness on the 
part of the teachers, arising from unfitness for their work, 
lack of sympathy with young people on’ the part of either 
teachers or principal, vacillation in control, want of tact, 
procrastination in handling cases, an unimpressive personal- 
ity, lack of administrative force, failure to mechanize the 
routine elements in management and control — these are 
other causes which combine to create a school that is hard 
to handle. The transformation of this type of school into a , \ che

school of spirit, proud of its ability to do things, and desirous 
of the approbation of principal and teachers. calls for a good 
understanding of human nature and no false moves on the 
part of the principal. 
Transforming an unruly school. The principal must first 
of all understand boys, as most of the trouble comes from 
them. If the boys assume the right attitude the girls usu- 
ally cause little concern. He needs a saving sense of humor, 
Sa spirit of frankness and fairness, the ability to. make boys 
_A feel that he is square and a good sport, and also the ability 
to act quickly and certainly when action is the needed vir- 
| tue. On the other hand he must not be an unsympathetic 
* old man in his attitude, nor must he exhibit a certain “‘swag- 
ger of authority” if he wishes to gain and hold control. He 
must not see or hear too much, must not try to regulate 
everything at once, and must make but few rules and only 
j such as will be easy of enforcement because of their evident 
/ fairness and justice. 
“~The transformation of an unruly school must be accom- 
plished largely by other means than rules and coercion, 
though these may have to be used. (The awakening of a 
strong school pride and spirit, particular attention to play- 
. ground organization, the stimulation of group responsibility, 
individual assignment for duty, snap and spirit in the school 
management, and a raising all along the line of the quality of 
the school work are all excellent helps. Order, system, a 
good regimen of work, and plenty of good play have a strong 
tonic effect on any school. 
These are the methods of “peaceful penetration”’ that in 
time accomplish large results, and are the methods a princi- 
pal should strive to use as much as possible. They are far 
more effective than force and punishment, yet there are 
times and schools where mild means must be temporarily 
set aside and force applied. A school in rebellion will regard
-P-A-G-E-283
  DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 267 
a teacher or principal as weak who does not act then. Will- | 
ful disobedience or mischief, insolence and insult, and bully- 
ing and maltreating of pupils usually call for discipline of a 
~ severe type. In such cases, if force is the thing to use, the 
action should be swift, unerring, and certain. e 4 
Few would care to be principal in a school where corporal” 
punishment was forbidden under all circumstances. There 
are times in a school, as in a home, where its use is a means of 
saving grace. This is particularly true in dealing with — 
While the days of corporal punishment are passing, ther 
still remain youths from certain types of homes to whom it 
alone will appeal. It must, however, be used sparingly, and 
should always be regarded as an emergency and transition 
remedy to be dispensed with as soon as milder methods can be 
made to work. With individuals and schools one strives to 
pass upward from the plane of imposed force, through indi- 
rect and constructive control, to smooth-running self-con- 
trol, which is the best preparation for social life. 
To prepare young people for proper social participation is 
one of America’s most difficult problems. The securing of 
order in a conglomerate democracy such as ours is obviously 
a far more subtle and difficult problem than the mainte- 
nance of order in such a homogeneous and docile country as 
Germany. To strike a golden mean between iron-clad au- 
tocracy on the one hand and disorder and anarchy on the 
other, while preserving a respect for the individuality of the 
pupils under his control, is a neat problem for any principal 
to solve. It is clear to any one who is exposed to the bad 
manners of many school children, and to the general irre- 
sponsibility, slovenliness, and trouble-making capacity of 
many classes, that the problem of adequate government is 
far from solved in this country. Yet the welfare of our 
country demands that the school lead in finding a solution. 
Fortunately most of life is a succession of small things rather
-P-A-G-E-284
    268 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
than a few big ones, and it is in the handling of these smaller 
difficulties where lie the main opportunities for constructive 
service. What a few of these smaller and common disciplin- 
ary troubles are we shall now consider. 
Minor disorders in the school. In addition to truancy, 
described in the preceding chapter, and which is in most 
cases easily controlled, the principal of every school en- 
{ counters many cases of pure mischief, which display only an 
exuberance of youthful spirits, induced perhaps by too rigid 
\ regulations, by teachers unsympathetic with children, or by 
those who see and hear too much. For example, pushing in 
‘Tine is a common cause of trouble. Some teachers are al- 
ways nagging their children when in line. Some principals 
hold that lines and marching cause more cases of discipline 
than any other single thing. Still others have abandoned 
lines entirely and let pupils move as they wish, so long as 
there is no marked rudeness. Probably the trouble lies in 
an insistence on too perfect order in lines. Except in fire- 
drills, where the safety of the group may be imperiled by 
the inattention or disobedience of one, a certain amount of 
innocent foolishness from children just from the playground 
ought to be overlooked. 
This same attitude may be best, also, regarding quite an 
amount of the harmless and perfectly natural and normal 
mischief and “monkey shines” that take place about a 
school building or ina classroom. Many a boy is haled be- 
fore a class and punished by a teacher when what he has 
done should be ignored, smiled at, gently interfered with, 
laughed at, or the whole proceeding adroitly turned against 
him and he be made to appear ridiculous. A lack of under-- 
standing of child nature, a lack of sympathy with boys, a 
lack of love for and interest in teaching, and a lack of a sav- 
ing sense of humor cause unhappy experiences to many a 
teacher and pupil. Such a condition is usually evidence of
-P-A-G-E-285
  DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 269 
poor teaching, and cannot be remedied merely by instruc- 
tion in classroom control. 
Snowballing is often a source of trouble, and repressive 
measures, while holding it largely in check on the grounds, 
still give the principal plenty to do. , A frank talk about the 
matter before the snow comes, and an understanding as to 
what is fair and right, will do much to prevent trouble.’ If 
possible, a part of the grounds or the street may be made 
free for the sport, and the regulation of it be given to the older 
pupils. Often a code can be set up under which immunity 
.for pupils going to and from school may be largely guaran- 
teed; other relations can be established with the police 
which will help to enforce the guarantee. If the sport must 
be prohibited on the school grounds, because of their small 
size and the attendant danger, the reasons for so doing 
ought to be made clear to the pupils. : 
Fighting among pupils. Fighting is another common 
cause of trouble in every school. Among boys from the 
ages of ten to twelve fighting is more common than among 
either the older or the younger children. At this age the in- 
stinct for fighting seems to be at its height. Boys appear 
to fight from the love of the game. Girls seldom fight; and 
when they do it is usually more distressing than serious. 
Boys on the whole fight fairly, and frequently a fight be- 
tween two boys clears the atmosphere and makes friends of 
the combatants as nothing else could do. If the mothers of 
the boys can be kept from taking too active a part in the af- 
fair it usually has no bad results. 
When two. boys, fairly evenly matched, between whom 
trouble has loag been brewing finally “get at it,” it isa good 
plan for the principal not to be in any great hurry to arrive 
and stop the fight. Sometimes it is a good plan to let hostil- 
ities proceed until there are signs of slackening, and then 
step up and tel! the boys they would better stop now and go
-P-A-G-E-286
270 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  inand wash up. The case can be investigated afterward. If 
the case was one where a mutual settlement was inevitable, 
and would have taken place outside if it had not happened 
on the school ground, and if it seems that a satisfactory set- 
tlement has now been arrived at, it is usually best not to in- 
flict punishment at all. 
In one such case as this, a principal of the writer’s ac- 
quaintance merely told the boys that she hoped, now that 
they had the matter settled, there would be no further diffi- 
culty. She then gave the boys open excuses to their teacher 
for being tardy, stating that they “‘had been detained on im- 
portant business,” and sent them to their rooms. This 
made them grin, settled the matter, and the boys after- 
wards became good friends. It takes some courage to do 
this, when indignant mothers send notes denouncing the 
moral standard of a school which allows fighting, but practi- 
cally no protests ever come from the fathers on this score. 
Such fights are fights with a real cause, and the boys’ way 
of looking at the matter must not be lost sight of. Adults 
are prone to think lightly of the troubles of children, but 
they are very real to them. Women particularly often fail 
to understand a boy’s code of honor, and frequently regard 
such affairs as uncalled for and meriting severe punishment. 
Adults too often forget that the use of fists long ruled man- 
kind, that intellect and the moral sense are comparatively 
recent developments, and that there are situations when a 
keen sense of his personal honor is a man’s best capital. 
Not many boys are “too proud to fight.” On the other 
harid it is undoubtedly a duty of the school to teach young 
people how to rise to a higher level, and hovy to settle dis- 
putes by an appeal to reason rather than to brute force. 
After treatment for fighting. There can be-noset proce- 
dure-for handling fighting, and a principal ‘shuld have no 
set rules regarding it. Fights are individua!, and do not go

by rule. Some are childish, and may be classed as mere 
“scraps” without an apparent cause. Calling each other 
names is one of this class, and probably starts more school 
fights than any other one thing. It is usually confined to 
the younger boys and girls, and especially to those in grades 
four to six. One school known to the author broke these 
fights up by having a stock punishment for such affairs, 
_ consisting of requiring the contestants to sit together in one 
armchair for an hour, before the class, with their arms 
around one another. Sometimes such scraps develop into 
real fights when older boys are concerned, and usually arise 
out of a “kidding match.” Finally one boy makes a jibe 
that goes beneath the skin, and a fight ison. In such cases 
little or no punishment is needed, but the silliness of such a 
fight needs to be adroitly brought out by the principal. 
Sometimes it is a school bully who picks on the wrong boy, 
or pushes some mild-mannered boy too far and gets a well- 
deserved thrashing. In such a case it is wise to let him get 
it, and then tell him that he got only what he merited. 
As to how to take hold of an affair, once it is brought to 
the attention of the principal, depends on the circumstances 
involved. In the majority of cases it is fortunate if such 
things are not referred to him, for such notice merely serves 
to lend dignity to them. The writer knows a principal, and 
a very successful one, who simply lets the little fellows fight 
it out. Then it is settled. If a fight starts on the play- 
ground, among the younger boys, he steps over and insists 
that they settle the issue. Asa matter of fact, the instigator 
becomes weak in the presence of authority and the affair 
speedily terminates. A fight among the older boys is some- 
what different. 
When two “scrappers”’ put in an appearance at the office 
with fightingyas the cause, a good plan is to permit the boys 
to “sweat” a while. This permits their tempers to cool 
  ay

down a bit, and they are then more amenable to reason. 
Once they are in this frame of mind they must not be fur- 
ther aroused by undue severity from the principal. A 
friendly, kindly, and often a jolly attitude, and a refusal to 
take their difficulty seriously often suffices to make the boys 
feel foolish and accomplishes results, if the fight is about a 
trivial matter. On the other hand, when both combatants 
feel keenly the justice of their stand, quite a different 
method must obtain. The matter now deserves careful con- 
sideration, and the boys must be made to feel that they are 
going to get a square deal. Nothing less will suffice. Then 
by a course of mediation the breach may be healed. It 
must not, however, be forced. A principal is compelled to 
deal with human nature as he finds it. He may endeavor to 
remedy the situation; he may condemn the fighting; but he 
must not, by sheer authority, compel an external acquiescence 
to the judgment passed. ‘This does not inspire respect for 
the principal’s decision or fairness, and forced apologies are 
worthless and leave a lingering sense of injustice which may 
easily cause the trouble to break out again. 
Sometimes talking the situation over with each offender 
individually, and then bringing them together and repeat- 
ing the story will straighten out the trouble. The boys may 
be led to feel silly or ashamed, or to see the lack of good 
sportsmanship in their action. Where one is clearly the ag- 
gressor the other may be excused, even commended for de- 
fending himself if the aggression was unwarranted, and the 
aggressor punished or deprived of some privilege he values. 
The school bully: promoted fights: gang fights. These 
are the more serious cases, and call for a different type of 
treatment. The school bully, who imposes on smaller pu- 
pils, is usually a coward, and a thorough whipping on the 
first clear-cut case will usually stop him. The bully is com- 
monly a product of inadequate play facilities, and schools
-P-A-G-E-289
DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 273 
  with good playgrounds usually have few bullies to deal 
with. Making the bully an assistant play director often 
cures him by giving him a new and better occupation. 
Sometimes, on the contrary, he is merely low in mentality 
and vicious by nature, and needs to be sent to a special 
school. 
Promoted fights, that is fights instigated by older boys, 
who by telling different lies to each of the principals finally 
get two boys to fighting, are hard kinds of fights to handle. 
At times these will be worked up and pulled off after school. 
The first knowledge a principal may have of them is when 
an indignant parent brings a battered-up boy to school the 
next morning and complains. It is best to proceed slowly 
here, and to be sure to have the instigators located before 
acting. The boys who have been led to do the fighting can 
usually be cured by showing them what fools the leaders 
have made of them. Sometimes, also, privileges that count 
will have to be withheld from them fora time. The promo- 
tors, when finally located, who in nearly all cases are older 
boys, need to be dealt with in such a manner as will effec- 
tively stop further fight promoting. The more a spectacle 
the fight was made the more severely they should be dealt 
with. The principal must make it clear to the school that, 
while he does not prohibit fighting when the provocation is 
great, fight-promoting he will not tolerate. 
Gang fights are perhaps the hardest of all to handle. If 
the two gangs are from different schools it is a little easier, 
as school pride comes in to help. Little canbe accdmplished 
here by threats or punishments. The commonness of the 
gang spirit and the loyalty of the gang must be recognized. 
Usually the best avenue of approach lies in a pleasant smile 
and a “Well, boys, who won?” type of question. This will 
usually bring out all the little details, especially from the 
winners. Then the problem is rather to repair damages and
-P-A-G-E-290
274 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
  try to prevent future gang fights. The ordinary good-na- 
tured town-boy gang does not need punishment so much as 
a deflection of its energy in better directions; the depraved 
village-tough type of gang calls for more severe measures. 
The principal must exercise common sense in such matters, 
and be able to distinguish between cases that can be par- 
tially or wholly overlooked and those calling for vigorous ac- 
al should not make the mistake of trying to prohibit it en- 
tirely. Every case which comes up is worthy of more or less 
attention, and should be dealt with so as to try to teach the 
participants that arbitration, compromise, and often tolera- 
tion are better than war.) The lesson should be made as 
convincing as possible without savoring of the sanctimoni- 
ous. The principal stands in the capacity of referee, and in 
this capacity he must measure up to a boy’s conception of a 
| square deal. He must be able to see the boy’s point of 
view in the affair, and all his decisions must ring true. In 
the settlement of these “affairs of honor” the principal has 
an opportunity to do much i the boys a 
reputation for fairness and justice, This is one of his most 
valuable assets as a principal. He has also a fine opportu- 
nity to do constructive work that will tend to establish better 
methods of settling disputes than by fighting them out. He 
may thus be able to make his discipline pay in social train- 
, ing all that it costs in time. 
——Lying and stealing: “Tying varies in character and seri- 
ousness to such a degree that few rules can be laid down for 
dealing with cases of it. The causes for it are hard to find. 
With little children a vivid imagination may be responsible, 
and when this is true very mild correctives should be em- 
ployed. Some children lie from fear to tell the truth; a pre- 
mium on truth-telling and the sympathy of the teacher may tion. 
i. Fighting, of course, must be condemned, but the princi-
-P-A-G-E-291
  DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 275 
be helpful in such cases. On the other hand, unruly boys 
who want to accomplish some mischief through lying need 
much firmer handling. Some of the most baffling cases are 
with girls, for which little excuse isevident. It is best not to 
"give public prominence to the cases, but:to handle each as 
far as possible quietly. Often the lies are unpremeditated, 
do not indicate depravity, and do not warrant severe cen- 
sure. Any attitude that provokes stubbornness on the part 
of the pupil will be fatal if the truth is desired. To tell a 
child caught in a lie that you will never believe him again is 
a great mistake. You may feel that way, but refrain from 
saying so. 
Stealing is a much more serious matter, especially if the 
article stolen is of value. One must proceed slowly and be 
quite sure of the facts before acting. If very little stealing 
is done it is best not to warn the pupils about the safety of 
their belongings, as it leads to speculation and works against 
the morale of the school. ‘When the offender has been lo- 
cated, the mode of approach will depend much on the nature 
of the child. It is best to take the matter up with the child 
and if possible settle-it there. Sometimes it is best to call in 
the parents. In dealing with offenders, ask your questions 
so the pupil will feel that you know. To ask the pupil 7f he 
took the article is less satisfactory than asking him why he 
took it. Vigorous measures are less effective, except in the 
case of old offenders, than gentle measures. 
Not infrequently one finds, too, a child not by nature bad 
but who by environment has come to consider deceit and 
theft something of an art, and who feels some pride in his or 
her success in this line. Many such children are classed 
as bad when in reality they are only ignorant. They fre- 
quently respond in a surprising way to kind treatment, to an 
appeal to a sense of honor, and to a new conception of stand- 
ards and values in life which a principal or a teacher may 
k
-P-A-G-E-292
  276 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
give them. Harsh treatment of such children would prob- 
ably lead to moral ruin. 
The principal will do well in dealing with all such cases to 
emphasize the idea that neither lying nor stealing really 
pay. Our whole social and civic life is built up around the 
sanctity of one’s word and the inviolability of private prop- 
erty. This can be pointed out, and that to repudiate these 
standards is always in the long run a losing game — loss of 
friendships, loss of self-respect, loss of position, failure to get 
on in the world, and ultimately the payment of a severe 
penalty. Honesty, as a mere practical proposition, is al- 
ways the best policy, and wrongdoing never pays in the long 
run because the present-day world has set its face against it. 
Cases in real life that escape penalty for long are very rare, 
and the course can never be one of permanent profit. The 
child will grasp the idea more quickly if reduced from moral 
to practical standards. The causes back of these two of- 
fenses — lying and stealing — still remain to be dealt with, 
and they are delicate matters upon which to approach par- 
ents. Still, if tactfully done, nearly all parents will respond 
in the proper spirit when they see that the object in appeal- 
ing to them is the good of the child. The chronic case, the 
habitual liar and thief, is another matter entirely. Such 
pupils should be isolated, if firm dealing with proves ineffec- 
tive, or turned over to the juvenile court to handle. 
Vulgarity and obscenity. This has been considered be- 
fore, in Chapter VII. Most of the vulgarity and obscenity 
manifested about a school building — obscene writing and 
pictures on blackboards, walls, and in toilets, and foul talk 
— are closely associated with the reproductive instinct, and 
indicate not only an unwholesome state of mind but also a 
lack of enough good hard play to turn the attention into 
other channels. 
In case of a proved piece of obscenity a plain frank talk
-P-A-G-E-293
DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 277 
with the pupil may be effective, or a conference with the 
parents may seem desirable. To have the father or mother 
brought face to face with the child for such a transgression 
usually has a salutary result. To get the pupil busy in play. 
activities also has a good tonic effect. 
The principal as judge. Most of the cases with which the 
principal has to deal will be cases which arise on the play- 
ground, in the hallways or basement, or on the way to and 
from school. These may be classified as the general cases. 
Regardless of how good the corps of teachers may be, there 
will always be a few cases which arise in the rooms, in the 
handling of which the assistance of the principal is desirable. 
In most such cases it is better if the pupil has to go to the 
principal for a hearing. Usually this will be by prearrange- 
ment with the teacher, but sometimes a crisis will come so 
suddenly that this is impossible. It should be understood 
that a pupil so sent is virtually suspended from the room, 
and can only be reinstated by the principal after a hearing 
of the case. During this time the pupil should remain iso- 
lated, receive no favors, and be allowed no privileges. 
In all such hearings the principal should choose his own 
time, and should adopt a system that will enable him to 
handle the cases rather rapidly. A few general rules may be 
useful. 
1. Do not deal with an angry pupil. Give him time to cool off 
and think it over. 
2. In the beginning, state the complaint clearly and fairly to the 
pupil, and listen to his defense. 
8. If the case is a rather evident one, lead the pupil by question- 
ing to see that he has convicted himself. 
4, Show no feeling against the pupil while listening to his case. 
Avoid any personal feeling; be judicial; try to get the pupil to 
talk freely; get the facts. 
5. Try to get at the motive behind the offense as well as the 
facts, and evaluate this in terms of the principles of organized 
society, 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
278 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Having arrived at the facts and the motive, the principal 
must now determine what is to be done about it. He 
should not work by fixed rules, but should consider the of- 
fense, the motive, the provocation, and particularly the age, 
understanding, and general attitude of the pupil. He 
should remember that the purpose of all discipline is con- 
structive and not penal, reformative and not retributive. 
There must first be order in a school that the school may do 
its work, but behind the requirement of order lies the end 
for which order is sought and enforced. In most cases the 
bad effect of such conduct on the society in which the pupil 
lives can be made clear, and how soon that society would go 
to pieces if all assumed such liberties pointed out. The dif- 
ference between liberty and license, and the fact that one 
person’s rights end when they interfere with another’s lib- 
erties, may be brought out. 
In determining what is to be done, the principal as judge 
should keep in mind certain principles of control. 
1. The punishment should be adjusted to the offense, the motive 
behind it, and the pupil. 
2. It should seem fair and just to a reasonable pupil, and be 
closely associated with the offense. 
8, Unless a frank talk and an admonition are considered suffi- 
cient, which may be the case with certain first offenders, the 
punishment ought to cause the pupil some real discomfort. 
4. Avoid using threats, school tasks, taking away earned marks, 
personal indignities, sarcasm, ridicule, or inordinate punish- 
ment as penalties. 
5. Among desirable means are deprivation of privileges, isola- 
tion, restitution, public apology, appeal to public opinion, re- 
ports to parents, assignment to a special class, corporal pun- 
ishment, suspension, and in extreme cases expulsion. 
6. Do not give any decision or administer any punishment im- 
pulsively. The attitude toward the offender is important. 
Punishments should be impersonal, distinct, deliberate, and 
decisive. In case of corporal punishment it is best to have a 
witness present, and to keep a record of the action,
-P-A-G-E-295
  DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 279 
If the pupil has damaged or taken property, a willingness 
to repair or restore it is good, provided he actually does it; 
if he has wrongfully taken the time of a class, he may be 
asked to forfeit some of his own; if he has committed an of- 
fense against a class, he may apologize for it, and if against a 
teacher, to her. In certain types of offenses the punishment 
may be left to the class to consider and determine. A period 
of probation, if.an old offender, may reasonably be insisted 
upon. A fundamental principle to be insisted on is that the 
amends or apology should be made before the group or per- 
ey ee gi a public one the apology should be public; otherwise the 
pupils may think the offender “got away with it.” _ 
Making discipline productive. "This: cfben boast it said 
that discipline is worth its cost in the chance it gives for 
teaching life lessons of value. Handled rightly, every out- 
break in a classroom or school offers an excellent opportu- 
nity to train young people for social control. Every fight, 
every gang scrap, every petty theft or piece of mischief, 
every truancy, and every offense against order or decency or 
law offers a constructive opportunity to teachers and princi- 
pal to place the control of the school in the future on a little 
higher plane. A skillful principal will seize upon these situa- 
tions and set them right before young people. He will grad- 
ually bring the pupils to see that conduct in a school is after 
all the same in principle as conduct in a home or in society. 
The idea should be continually emphasized in handling 
cases that offenses are not offenses against the principal or 
teachers, but against the class or school, and that the class 
or school has some right to protection and in saying what 
shall be done with offenders against their rights. The anal- 
ogy to society should be kept clear. The more thoroughly 
this idea can be developed in a school the more likely is the 
discipline to become easier and productive, 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  280 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Young people usually have a strong sense of justice and 
fair play, know the meaning of a square deal, and appreciate 
being dealt with as though they possessed some manhood 
and were worthy of some respect and confidence. Dealt 
with on this plane they will accept punishment without bit- 
terness, as the records of our juvenile courts well reveal. 
Wherever possible, it is on this plane that the principal 
should handle his cases, Take pains to get the pupils’ 
point of view, try to look at the matter as they did at the 
time, find and bring out the weakness in their conception of 
their rights, deal with the case without passion, keep an eye 
for the humor of the situation, and test your decision before 
announcing it to see if it will appeal to the pupils as fair and 
just. Often it pays to be in no hurry about a decision; often 
it is a good plan to set the case clearly before the pupil and 
let him think out what ought to be done about it; and some- 
times it is wise, after all the facts are in, to put the problem 
before the pupils of the offender’s room and let them discuss 
it and decide by vote upon it. It is, after all, not so much a 
question as to what the principal or_teacher will do about 
any particular breach of discipline as to what the pupil will 
do, and where the training in thinking out what ought to be 
done can well be extended to a group it is good to do so. It 
is often quite a revelation to a pupil to be told by his class- 
mates that he was wrong, and, if he does not mend his ways, 
that the class does not wish him longer as a member. If 
this is to be done, however, teachers and principal must per- 
mit pupils to discuss the occurrence freely, and must at times 
accept decisions which are not quite what they would have 
made for themselves. 
Decreasing discipline by prevention. The end and aim 
of school management and control should be to build up 
in the school such an interest in work and good order that 
discipline, as such, will be largely unnecessary. To shift
-P-A-G-E-297
  DISCIPLINE AND CONTROL 281 
young people’s ideals, by proper handling, from malicious 
mischief and general bad conduct to constructive work for a 
common good and purpose, and to make them feel th=t what 
they are doing is very important, is a wonderful service to 
them. It also contributes much to making a school easier 
to control. Constructive discipline, plenty of motivated 
school work, good teaching, good playground organization 
and inter-school games, organized pupil activities, a good 
grading and promotional plan, wise use of the assembly pe- 
riod, employment of the pupils as leaders, the awakening of 
a school pride and loyal spirit, the development of some type 
of community service, and the impress of the ideals and 
personality of strong teachers and a capable principal — all 
these contribute as preventive measures to decrease the 
necessity for much attention to discipline. 
| It is the business of the school to try to find and bring out 
the good that is in young people, and to turn youthful en- 
ergy and spirit into useful channels. } Unruly boys and girls 
can often be almost completely changed in character by 
awakening their pride, making them feel that they are of 
real help and use, and filling them with a desire to become 
somebody worth while in this world. The school offers an 
alert principal and body of teachers plenty of constructive 
opportunities, both in the school and in the neighborhood, 
for training pupils for useful participation in civic life. To 
open up these possibilities for service and turn the energies 
of the young people into new and useful directions constitute 
important means for reducing disciplinary troubles, and for 
shifting the disciplinary problem to higher levels. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Point out the tonic effect on a school of plenty of play, good system, a 
good regimen of work, and spirit and snap in what is done. 
2. Assuming that you keep lines and marching, what rules as to order in 
line would you insist upon?
-P-A-G-E-298
  THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
. Point out the opportunity for useful instruction in having pupils see 
the difference in order that must be insisted upon in a fire-drill. 
. Show how the bullying tendency may be made useful in helpful con- 
trol of children, and what transformation to a higher level in thinking 
this produces in the boy. 
. Suppose two boys, in play. One makes some statement, the other 
flares up and calls him a liar, gets slapped in the face, and a fight is on. 
What would you do about it? 
. Suppose two girls, for no real provocation other than personal dislike 
of one another, get into a scrap with hair-pulling and kicking, when 
you stop the affair. What would you do about it? 
. A somewhat ugly and spoiled boy in a classroom refuses to do some- 
thing a teacher tells him to do, and when she puts her hand on him to 
urge him along, he turns and kicks her on the shin. Without attempt- 
ing to handle him further, she sends him to you. What would you do 
about this case? 
. You tell a big boy, on the playground, to do some simple thing; he does 
. not move or say anything: you tell him again, and he tells you, “Go to 
10. 
i. 
12. Hell.” What would you do in this case? 
. Half a dozen eighth-grade boys frame up a promoted fight, after school 
and off the school grounds, between two sixth-grade boys in your 
school, and before an audience of thirty or forty of your boys. They 
are fairly evenly matched, and both are badly bruised. The first 
you know of it is the next morning, when the mothers of the two boys 
arrive to complain to you of the affair. What procedure would you 
follow, and what would you do? 
You set a trap and catch a twelve-year-old girl, at a recess period, tak- 
ing small change from the pockets of wraps of other girls. The girl is 
from a reasonably good home, and there is no reason why she should 
steal. Map out two or three possible lines of action. Suppose the 
girl to be from a poor, ignorant, foreign-born home and, similarly, 
map out your lines of action. 
Show the large opportunities that come, both in management and in- 
struction, in bringing to pupils the conception that honesty actually 
pays. 
How may a school, through discipline and control, promote the idea, 
often advanced, of nations finding a peaceful moral substitute for war?

CHAPTER XV 
  THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 
Relation of principal and teachers. While the principal 
must of necessity handle most of the general and more seri- 
ous cases of discipline that arise on the playground and 
about the school, he must not be expected to do the entire 
disciplinary work. The infractions of order and the 
breaches of discipline which occur in the classrooms and in 
the presence of the teacher elsewhere should be handled 
largely by the teachers themselves, and without bothering the 
principal about it or taking him away from more important 
service. Just as the efficiency of a principal is to be in part 
measured by how few cases of discipline he sends to the su- 
perintendent’s office, so the efficiency of a teacher must in 
part be determined by how well she handles her room and 
how few disciplinary cases she sends to the principal. 
This does not mean that a teacher should not consult the 
principal about disciplinary cases, or seek his professional 
advice as to handling them. On the contrary, this is often 
very desirable. Serious cases he certainly ought to know 
about, whether he comes in touch with the case or not. The 
corporal punishment of the school would best be adminis- 
tered by him alone, but with the teacher or the janitor as a 
witness. It simply means that teachers should try, with ad- 
vice as needed, to handle as many of the cases of discipline 
that arise under their jurisdiction as they can, and that 
sending a pupil to the principal’s office ought to be in the na- 
ture of a last resort. More, naturally, can be expected of 
some teachers in this matter than of others, and full allow- 
ance for natural difficulties of new and inexperienced teach- 
ers must be made. These differences the principal should 
 
-P-A-G-E-301

THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 285 
take into consideration, and he should accordingly lay down 
few general rules as to when he should and should not be 
called upon. 
Different classes of teachers. Not infrequently a new 
principal will inherit a school, not unruly as a whole, but a 
school in which a few rooms are unruly. Again a principal 
who has brought a school under good control will find new 
teachers frequently have to be “broken in”’ and fitted into 
the-organization. A principal in any large school will also 
usually find that he has three or four different types of teach- 
ers, considered from the point of view of classroom control, 
and different degrees of obligation will rest upon him, in the 
matter of helping in discipline, with these different classes. 
There will be at least the able and helpful teacher, who has 
little disciplinary trouble, and who seldom needs any assist- 
ance from the principal; the military disciplinarian, who se- 
cures order, but without the best results; the beginner, who 
needs help but-can learn or is learning; and the beginner 
who lacks the personality and the understanding requisite, 
and who probably never will learn to be effective. 
Any principal is fortunate if he has a majority of experi- 
enced teachers who are both able teachers and able disci- 
plinarians. The better the teacher usually the better the 
disciplinarian, the two abilities being closely related. Often 
the best teachers seem to have no discipline to handle, 
and often they are unable to tell how such happens to be 
the case. These teachers will constitute the older, better 
trained, more discerning, and more experienced corps of 
the school, and will call for little help or advice in disciplin- 
ary matters from the principal. 
Probably not all the older and more experienced teachers 
will belong to this first class, for one often finds among the 
older teachers one or more who handle problems of disci- 
pline alone and keep a certain kind of order, but whose ideal

in discipline is fundamentally wrong. They are the marti- 
nets of the building, and the pupils usually resent their 
strictness and the military type of control which they impose. 
The effect of the discipline of such a teacher on the spirit of the 
school isnot good. Sometimes a suggestion to her, as one 
who has perfect order and hence is in a position to allow 
more freedom and more spontaneity, will bring the desired 
results. Sometimes a teachers’-meeting consideration of the 
problems of child control will act as an entering wedge, and 
stimulate the teacher to read some good book on classroom 
organization and control. Often the principal can render a 
real service in enlarging the teacher’s viewpoint and modi- 
fying the military aspect of her schoolroom control. Prob- 
ably just as often, on the other hand, little or nothing can be 
done to change conditions. 
It is with the beginners and the less experienced teach- 
ers that the principal’s chief work in forming disciplinary 
habits must be done. These will fall rather quickly into 
at least two classes. The first class will be the teachers of 
promise who are anxious to be helped and to learn, and the 
second will be those for whom one can do little other than 
preventing anarchy before the year is over. Most begin- 
ners, however, belong to the first class. The second class 
will not often appear in school systems where evidence of 
professional training and competency are made prerequisite 
for employment. 
An alert principal will discover the characteristics of his 
teaching force very early in their work together, and will 
seek to help those in need and to apply preventive meas- 
ures before the situation gets beyond control. 
Shaping conditions to be of service. The first thing a 
principal must do, in the process of helping a teacher in 
trouble with her discipline, is to diagnose the situation and 
locate the cause of the weakness. When that has been done,
-P-A-G-E-303
THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 287 
corrective treatment may follow. By first analyzing the 
problem the principal can determine if the teacher has the 
proper ideal of what good order is; if not, how he can impart 
this to her; if she has the right ideal, what is preventing her 
from realizing it; and what devices and line of procedure will 
enable him to help her most easily and surely. A careful 
analysis of the breaches of discipline occurring in her room 
may reveal the sources of weakness, and indicate the best 
type of remedial treatment to follow. The difficulty may 
arise chiefly in the passing in and out, or in the confusion 
caused by passing material. It may be that the trouble is 
caused by one or two pupils who are not classified properly, 
or whose loyalty is yet to be won. It may be that the pu- 
pils are not kept busy, or that the instruction does not call 
for activity in doing or thinking on their part. It may be 
that the difficulty arises from the teacher trying to teach 
some subject in which she is not competent. 
Another necessary prerequisite to aiding a teacher is the 
establishment of sympathetic and helpful relations with her. 
She must be made to feel that the principal is interested in 
her success and really wants to assist her. Between teach- 
ers and principal there is not infrequently a lack of the right 
personal attitude. In cities where the board of education 
expects the principal each year to find teachers to dismiss, 
an attitude of fear and suspicion is almost certain to exist. 
An office-chair principal, who is primarily an executive, 
may awaken the same suspicious attitude on the part of the 
teachers. A not uncommon position for teachers to take 
toward a principal, until he disarms suspicion by service, is 
that he is a detective, a boss, a driver. Often in addition 
there is the feeling that, after all, he really does not know. 
Men principals probably are more often regarded in this 
light than are women. 
A prerequisite to any large helpfulness, then, is that such 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  288 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
suspicions be allayed. If this can be done, and the teachers 
put in the right attitude toward the principal, the road in 
the future is much easier. Some principals do not try to do 
much in helping teachers until the right personal relations 
have been established — until the teachers have come to 
see that the principal wants to be a guide and leader and 
helper, and not a driver and boss and spy. A principal 
needs the friendship, confidence, and trust of his teachers, 
and they must feel that he can and will help them if they will 
give him the chance. It will be worth much to a princi- 
pal to spend time and effort in establishing such relation- 
ships. 
The situation having been diagnosed, and some sort of 
helpful relationships having been established, the principal 
is ready to proceed in assisting his teachers with their class- 
room problems. 
Strengthening the teacher in government. Those most in 
need of help are usually the young and inexperienced teach- 
ers. What they need is advice as to how to strengthen their 
control. This must be given through observation and sug- 
gestion, but not by doing the governing for them. Above 
all, the principal must refrain from doing anything that 
may give the pupils the idea that he considers the teacher 
lacking in governing ability. From the start the teacher 
must realize that her problem must, after all, be solved by 
herself, and the principal should try to give her confidence 
in her ability to succeed. A great element in success is the 
feeling that one can ‘“‘swing” what one undertakes to do. 
Usually a little encouragement, appreciation of what is well 
done, helpful suggestions, and an appeal to her self-reliance 
will be the best tonic for a live and capable girl that a princi- 
pal can give. In addition, he may employ the following de- 
vices by way of helping her to put herself in control and to 
develop the necessary confidence in herself.

THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 289 
1. Give her very practical suggestions for improvement, out of 
your own experience as a teacher. 
2. Caution her to make few rules, but having made a rule to in- 
sist upon a reasonable compliance with it. 
8. Caution her against making rules involving definite punish- 
ments for misbehavior. The pupils may decide that the fun 
is worth the pain. Punishments should come as surprises. 
4. Caution her to say what she means and to mean what she 
says. Do not try to discipline a school with a continual vol- 
< ley of Don’ts. Do not tell pupils twice. Do not try to bluff 
the American boy, and do not be bluffed by gim. 
5. Do not let her start out either too severely or too easily. One 
direction leads to the martinet, and the other to the easy, 
‘ mushy, “golden-ruler,” who soon forms an easy mark for the 
mischievous and unruly pupils. If she learns from the first 
to keep cool, to be sympathetic, but to temper her kindness 
and sympathy with firmness, and at times with the exhibi- 
tion of a little “nerve,” few pupils will care to bother her 
long. 
6. Try to keep the beginner from worry and despondency; she 
needs all her energy for her teaching problems. 
7. When you visit the room be careful to let the pupils see that 
you continually defer to her as in control. Never criticize 
her before the pupils. 
8. Use your influence to build up in her class a kind of pride in 
the success of that particular class. Stress the fact that class 
comparisons are made, and show them what they need to do 
to bring their room up. The pupils will usually respond. 
9. Show her that her strongest ally is public opinion within the 
schoolroom itself. If she assumes that the offender is on one 
side against the other pupils and herself, this alignment is 
likely to be a strong factor in her favor. 
10. Remember that a well-taught school is usually an orderly 
school, and strive most of all to build up the teacher in teach- 
ing skill. In particular, show her how to strengthen the 
mechanized routine of the school. Have her grasp the idea 
that she is there primarily as a teacher, and that if she teaches 
well the discipline will be reduced to a minimum. 
11. Locate the weak points in her control, and give her magazine 
articles or a book to read which will be helpful to her. 
12. Give her a few half days for visiting, and let her see other 
teachers at work who do not have her defects. If there is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  ' 
290 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
“demonstration teacher” or a “training teacher” employed 
by the school system, arrange for her to visit the teacher and 
offer help. 
The teacher must be brought to see that good control in- 
volves the recognition of the fact that different cases call 
for different types of treatment. Sensitive pupils some- 
times offend against group well-being, and for these a re- 
minder is enough. Stupid or thick-skinned obstructionists 
may need morg vigorous handling. The worst type of trou- 
ble maker may sometimes be cured by securing from him ac- 
ceptance of some responsibility; frequently “‘live wires” 
make trouble for lack of something better to do. Imposed 
trust may successfully challenge this type to higher action. 
Sympathy, humorous appreciation of the childish point of 
view, and ability to turn a clever jest — these sometimes re- 
lieve a situation for a group and call down on the offender 
the laughter of the class. In but few cases will there be 
those for whom the only effective treatment is through the 
cuticle. A 
If the principal has been so unfortunate as to draw a 
teacher who cannot learn methods of control, though he has 
exhausted all efforts to help her, he has one of two courses 
which he can follow. The first is to transfer the more un- 
ruly pupils to other teachers and reduce the size of her class, 
and the other, and probably the more effective of the two 
courses, is to tell her that you have done all you can to help 
her and that the responsibility for control must in the future 
rest with her. Thus thrown on her own resources, she must 
learn to carry the responsibility if she is to survive to the 
end of the year. 
Causes of poor control. Poor control in a classroom usu- 
ally is evidence either of a weak personality, one lacking in 
force, or of faulty organizing and instructing ability, or both. 
Native managerial ability plays an important part in class-
-P-A-G-E-307
THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 291 
room control. The teacher’s general make-up may arouse 
hostility. A poor high-keyed voice, a high-strung nervous 
manner, peculiar dress, constant nagging, sarcastic remarks, 
and a lack of patience and sympathy with children may eas- 
ily stir up aroom to disorder. Unfairness in attitude toward 
children, and an easy manner one day and a cross one the 
next will not do. When such defects are evident, the princi- 
pal must frankly tell the teacher the causes of her troubles 
and suggest corrective procedure. Many of these manner- 
isms and bad habits, once the teacher becomes conscious of 
the handicap they impose, may be eliminated by her per- 
sonal attention to them. If the teacher has no real sym- 
pathy with and interest in children, tell her that she must at 
least assume these attitudes for the sake of her influence 
with them. 
Inferior organizing ability and lack of system also cause 
much poor classroom control. The children feel the want 
of the smooth-running organization that evidences mastery. 
The room and the pupils often reveal these characteristics 
of the teacher. Things are helter-skelter, the room is often 
in confusion, often little is accomplished in the recitation 
time, and a poor start in the morning carries over through 
the whole day. The pupils fail to experience the pleasure 
that comes from. thorough systematic work, and mischief 
and disorder arise. The principal must, little by little, train 
such teachers in order and system and organization. This 
he cannot do, though, if he does not possess such habits 
himself. . 
Poor teaching method is a prolific cause of poor classroom 
control. Poor methods of presentation, poor recitation tech- 
nique, poor preparation and assignment, lack of content in 
the instruction, too much talking on the part of the teacher 
and too little work by the pupils, all are very conducive to 
disorder in a classroom, and the handling of this disorder in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  292 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
evitably degrades further the quality of the teaching. The 
close relation between a busy, contented school and good 
teaching technique and ease in control should be pointed 
out and illustrated by the principal. To teach the class for 
her, give her helpful constructive criticism on what she 
does, and send her to visit other classes with a definite pur- 
pose in mind, are all good correctives. Select some help- 
ful book on classroom technique, such as Bagley’s or More- 
house’s School Discipline, or Sears’ Classroom Organization 
and Control, for her to read. 
What a new principal may find. A new principal, on tak- 
ing charge of a building, may find that the teachers have in 
the past been in the habit of depending largely on the princi- 
pal to handle the discipline of the school. His predecessor 
may have been more of an office type of principal, and may 
have not only enjoyed the disciplinary aspect of his work 
but may also have been remarkably efficient in it. In such 
a situation the new principal would best lay his plans to 
change the procedure. Helping children to overcome dis- 
ciplinary ills and to develop into self-directing and useful 
citizens is a part of a teacher’s work, and the problem of dis- 
cipline can be made as productive in the classroom as in the 
principal’s office. Still more, there is likely to be much 
more discipline to handle when the pupils see that the 
teacher does not or can not handle it. 
The subject may be a very fruitful one for consideration 
at the teachers’ meetings which the principal will hold. If 
so, he must approach the problem from the point of view of 
the pupils’ best interests, rather than from a desire to be re- 
lieved from the work himself. While standing ready at all 
times to help his teachers with their discipline, he must 
nevertheless encourage them to study the problem and use 
their own resources with a view to becoming more self-reli- 
ant. Gradually he must more and more deal with his teach-
-P-A-G-E-309
THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 293 
ers in the way described above for new teachers, and more 
and more push back upon them the greater part of the work 
of handling pupils and training them to. overcome their 
objectionable habits and develop into useful citizens. 
The principal should gradually come to an understanding 
with his teachers as to just what kind of disciplinary cases 
they are to refer to him, and what types they are to handle 
themselves. This will vary somewhat with different teach- 
ers, for reasons previously stated, though certain types of 
cases may be expected to be handled by all teachers alone. 
The principal should work to strengthen his teachers by re- 
signing to them just as much control as they can learn to 
handle. The teacher knows the child and the offense better 
than any one else, and where she can handle it alone or deal 
with the parents about it alone she should be permitted to 
do so. 
Supporting the teacher in government. The first real 
try-out of a new principal, in so far as the teachers of his 
building are concerned, will come the first time one of his 
staff sends an unruly boy to his office for discipline. Much 
of the principal’s future success in the school will be deter- 
mined by the wisdom with which he handles this first case. 
If he does not handle it well; if he is weak or vacillating; if 
he palliates the offense or sides with the pupil; and if he does 
not impose a punishment or require an amend suitable for 
the pupil and the offense, he will lose not only the confidence 
of the teacher sending the pupil but probably that of the 
whole force as well. News that the new principal is weak 
and will not back up the teacher spreads rapidly through- 
out the building, and it may take a good principal a long 
time to regain the confidence lost on a first case. 
One of the greatest helps toward good discipline that a 
teacher, new or old, can have in her school work is the sup- 
port of the principal in what she tries todo, The principal’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  294 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
attitude toward her, both in and outside the classroom, 
counts for much. She should be made to feel that the prin- 
cipal will stand behind her in all just treatment of pupils for 
purposes of control. 
While the principal should stand behind his teachers and 
be ready to take over cases formally referred to him, on the 
other hand he should not be expected to settle every little 
perplexing case arising in a classroom. Teachers who begin 
that way should be gently given to understand that they 
must learn to handle the cases that are within their ability 
to handle. A principal who pursues any other course is not 
doing his duty by his teachers. Instead of building them 
up in classroom control he is leading them toward failure. 
The pupils sense the situation, the rooms become more and 
more unruly, and the boys and girls take a ghance with the 
principal for the fun of worrying the teacher who cannot 
control them. 
On the other hand, teachers are at times “run over” by 
the momentum of a disorderly school, where the real fault 
lies in the weak personality or lack of support of the princi- 
pal. Not only must the general morale of the school be in- 
sured, but a teacher is strengthened by knowing that dis- 
ciplinary cases which she sends from her classroom will be 
settled with decision in the office, or that her own rulings, if 
' within the pale of justice and reason, will be promptly and 
vigorously sustained by her superior in case of an appeal. 
Given this assurance of solid backing from the principal, it 
is the teacher’s next move to avail herself of it as little as is 
possible and to handle her own difficulties as long as she can. 
Supporting the teacher when wrong. Even though the 
teacher may have imposed a punishment that is pedagogi- 
cally wrong, or have gone a little too far, from the legal or 
politic point of view, if a new teacher and not knowing bet- 
ter the principal ought to stand by her. He Should, of
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 295 
course, under such circumstances explain to her why he 
would not have done it that way, and why what she has 
done is pedagogically or even legally wrong, but assure her 
that this time he will stand behind her as fully as he can 
and help pull her through. Only when she has violated 
known rules can he fail to support her. 
If, for example, she has punished a pupil by assigning him 
a lesson to study or a poem to memorize, enforce her au- 
thority and see that the pupil does it, but make her see 
that this is not a proper punishment because pedagogically 
it leads to bad results. Defend her as far as possible from 
irate parents, even though you may feel that she has not 
acted very wisely. The beginning teacher cannot be ex- 
pected to possess the same sound judgment and pedagogical 
skill as an experienced principal. One of the reasons for the 
principal being in the position he is, is that he may guide 
and direct and help educate the new and younger employ- 
ees in the teaching service. 
The teachers must come to eridesstard: however, that 
while advice and full support will be given them in handling 
their troublesome cases, and that while a strong arm will be 
ready in last resort to uphold their authority, still, for their 
own good and for the good of their children, they must feel 
that the final responsibility for good order rests with them. 
This is necessary for a teacher’s best. development, that she 
may in time learn to walk alone. Teachers must also be 
made to see that poor teaching organization and technique 
lies at the bottom of most disciplinary troubles. A busy 
school is a contented school. 
Protecting the teacher. A principal can do much toward 
making a teacher’s lot easier and winning her full codpera- 
-tion by protecting her from over-strain and annoyances, 
that she may do her work under good conditions and in 
peace, He must possess tact and understanding, and be
-P-A-G-E-312
  296 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
willing to shunt off from her all the worry and trouble he 
can. This is a part of what he is there for. 
Teaching is a hard nervous strain to most women, and a 
young teacher often wears under it badly. When signs of 
nervous over-strain appear the principal should try to ward 
off trouble by assuming some of the teacher’s burden, or by 
relieving her of her class at an hour when the class seems 
particularly troublesome. It is always desirable that the 
children should not detect any evidence that the class is too 
much for.the teacher. An hour in the rést room at times 
has kept many a nervous girl from becoming discouraged 
and losing her hold. Sometimes an older and well-estab- 
lished teacher can be materially helped in a similar manner: 
The complaining parent. Another form of protection of 
teachers that the principal ought to assume is that of deal- 
ing with parents who write or come to complain. It is prob- 
ably best that teachers be instructed to turn over all com- 
plaining and fault-finding notes to the principal for reply, 
and it adds force and dignity to the reply when the parent 
sees that the teacher has taken the matter to the principal, 
and that the reply comes from him. His reply is more effec- 
tive, too, if it is on official letter paper, is written on a type- 
writer, and is properly and formally addressed and signed. 
Parents not infrequently send hasty and angry notes to 
teachers on the biased and incompetent evidence of their 
own children. It is best for the principal to assume the duty 
of answering all such notes, and his letter of reply should be 
dignified, brief, non-argumentative, should assume the par- 
ent’s interest in the welfare of the child, and usually should 
be conclusive and not of a type to invite further argument. 
Where the letter is typewritten, it is well to retain a carbon 
copy for evidence, and this the teacher should be permitted ° 
to read. 
The irate parent who comes to the school, A complaining
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 207 
or irate parent coming to the school should in all cases be 
taken over by the principal. Notices in the hallway should 
direct the parent to the principal’s office, and the rules 
should forbid a complaining parent going to the teacher’s 
classroom. Should the parent do so, as is frequently the 
case, the teacher may talk with him or her if the school is 
not in session. If it is, she should politely but firmly refer 
the parent to the principal, and not permit the time of the 
class to be taken up in listening to a complaint. The 
teacher should be protected in this action by this being made 
a school rule. A pupil may be sent-with the parent to find 
the principal, or to show the way to the office. The princi- 
pal should then take over the case and handle it for the 
teacher. 
A first rule in such an interview is to keep cool and col- 
lected and to let the parent do most of the talking. Talk is 
an excellent safety valve. Do not interrupt except to ask 
necessary questions. Assume throughout that the parent 
is reasonable and rational and deeply interested in the wel- 
fare of the child, even though you think otherwise. When 
you finally come to a decision, give it quietly and judicially. 
The fact that you have listened and have kept cool gives 
you the advantage that calmness always has over anger. 
Perhaps after all it is only some little misunderstanding 
caused by some child’s tale, and a few calm, tactful, and rea- 
sonable words will set it right. If you think this will not be 
sufficient you may take the case under advisement, or, if you 
wish to secure further information, ask the parent to leave 
the matter with you and to call again. It is sometimes good 
psychology not to be in any hurry to make your decision. 
While giving each case a just settlement do not worry over 
the difficulty, and try to deal with each case as it is likely to 
look to you a month afterward. 
Sometimes it may: seem best to arrange for an interview
-P-A-G-E-314
  298 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
on the matter between the parent and the teacher. If it is 
after all a trifling matter, easily explained, it will be good for 
the teacher and the parent to talk it over. This meeting 
may be arranged for at the close of school, and may be left 
to the teacher to handle. If the parent is likely to be un- 
reasonable, then it would best be in the principal’s office, 
and the principal would do well to remain or to be within 
call. If matters become unpleasant, the principal should 
come to the rescue of the teacher and take charge of the in- 
terview. Such protection and defense of a teacher is just 
and right, and will do much to give tone and character to 
the management of a school. 
Many of the complaints which come to a principal at his 
office he should handle and settle without saying anything 
to the teacher about them. If the teacher is right, as she 
usually is, he should protect her from the annoyance and 
worry incident to the complaint. It is part of the princi- 
pal’s business to shield his teachers as much as possible that 
they may do their teaching in peace and under the most 
favorable conditions. 
Improving relations with parents. Much is now done by 
our schools to bring parents, teachers, and the public into 
better understanding and closer codperation, and to pro- 
mote harmonious relations generally. Parent-teacher as- 
sociations, the visiting nurse and teacher, and organized 
school publicity are all new efforts to establish better under- 
standings. These new developments are all very useful 
and, even in small school systems, can be made quite effec- 
tive. Despite all that can be done, though, to keep parents 
in touch and sympathy with what the school is trying to do 
for their children, the difficult or unreasonable parent will 
from time to time appear. Both the principal and the 
teacher are likely to encounter him or her. While the num- 
ber of such parents is relatively small, and if the school
-P-A-G-E-315
THE TEACHER AND GOVERNMENT 299 
stands well in the community they need not be taken very 
seriously, yet there exist a number of varieties of this species 
of parent, and these different varieties have to be dealt with 
in somewhat different ways. One principal has made the 
following classification: 
1. Parents who listen to all the childish grievances, and develop 
unreasonable prejudices against the teacher. 
2. Parents who incite their children to take revenge by petty 
annoyances for fancied grievances. 
3. Faddists along some line, such as some school subject, voca- 
tional work, over-study, open-air classes, outdoor work, or re- 
ligious education. 
4. Parents who try to form the lives of their children, without 
considering abilities or aptitudes. 
5. Parents who regard the teachers as servants, and claim special 
rights as taxpayers. 
6. Parents who enforce no discipline at home, and object to the 
school having any. 
7. Parents who expect the school to do for their children what 
their abilities will not permit of being done. 
8. Sensitive parents, easily offended over nothing. 
9. Egotistical parents, very sure of themselves and of their chil- 
dren. 
10. Ignorant parents. 
A safe method in dealing with all these cases lies in getting 
acquainted with the parents, learning their point of view, 
meeting them on the common and perfectly safe ground of 
mutual interest in the child’s welfare, talking little and listen- 
ing much, a plentiful use of tact, impartiality, and an effort 
to educate them as to their child’s best interests by giving 
them new points of view. In case of necessity the principal 
can fall back on the perfectly safe ground that the superin- 
tendent and the board of education have so ordered, and 
that he is held responsible for certain results; that his teach- 
ers and he have better technical knowledge as to what 
ought to be done than has the parent; and that no one 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
Ne 
300 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
is more interested in the child’s best welfare than are his 
teachers and himself. The handling of each case should be 
carried through in a calm, judicial manner, and should evi- 
dence the same dignified tone expressed in the principal’s 
letters to the parents. The principal may be called upon to 
defend the school and his teachers. In so doing he should 
appear to maintain an impartial attitude and base all his 
reasonings and decisions on the real welfare of the child. 
Many of the cases coming to a principal’s office, general- 
ized and made impersonal, form excellent material for dis- 
cussion at general meetings at which parents are present. 
So utilized, tactfully and without fault-finding, they give a 
principal good opportunities to inform his community as to 
the work of his teachers and his school, and to contribute to 
the building up of asentiment which will increase codper- 
ation and decrease complaints. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. The first day of school, in the autumn, you enter the room of a begin- 
ning teacher and find it all in confusion. Throughout the first week 
the teacher seems to gain little in organization or control. What 
would you do, and why? 
2. Suppose, in your building, of two beginning teachers in the lower 
grades, you finally come to the conclusion that one is of promise and 
anxious to learn, but very young and high-strung, while the other is 
heavy, slow, and probably hopeless. Give some lines of procedure for 
each, 
3. Assume for the first one, and list, eight mistakes she constantly makes 
in control, and suggest a remedial line of treatment for each. 
4. List half a dozen devices you would employ, in either case, to lead the 
pupils to think you look up to the teacher and respect her authority. 
5. List, also, half a dozen mistakes a principal might make in such a room 
and with such teachers.

. The first week you act as principal in charge of a school an old teacher 
in the building has an altercation with an upper-grade pupil. It seems 
to you to have arisen largely from the teacher having been hasty and 
not understanding the pupil, new to her room. She orders him to 
stand in a corner until dismissal time, and, when he refuses to obey, 
sends him to your office for punishment. What will you do about it?

to the rule of the board of education, and the mother comes to you 
about it, quite angry, demanding redress under pain of carrying the

Suppose, in the case of the boy in Question 7 of the preceding chapter, 
you temporarily suspend him, sending him home with a note request- 
ing the mother to call. Your investigation leads you to conclude that 
the boy was wholly in the wrong. The mother calls, is very indignant, 
and defends her boy. She demands a transfer for him to another 
school. What would you do in this case? 
A parent sends the following note to a teacher: 
Miss Evprmee: 
My boy is a good boy, and I don’t like the way you pick on 
him and favor other boys. I told him not to stay in for you after 
school, so don’t try to keep him again for trivial matters. If you 
do I shall be forced to carry the matter to the principal.

CHAPTER XVI 
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 
The school without spirit. The presence of any large 
amount of trouble with attendance and discipline in a school 
is generally indicative of something fundamentally wrong 
in the organization and administration of the school itself. 
Such a school probably stands as an organized institution, 
fulfilling the letter of the law, but without having developed 
that spirit which gives life to an institution and attaches 
children and parents to it. One still finds many such 
schools, though they are less common to-day than they were 
a decade ago. Where they do exist one generally finds that 
neither principal nor teachers have become conscious of any 
large social purpose in their work. In consequence, the 
school they control fails to measure up to its possibilities as 
a social institution, training young people for life. The pu- 
pils accordingly show toward the school little of that loyalty 
which they give to their outside interests; they disregard its 
regulations when it seems reasonably safe to do so; and they 
absent themselves from its instruction for trifling reasons. 
* The school, in turn, falls back upon a stricter discipline and 
a more rigid enforcement of the compulsory attendance law, 
and a vicious circle is formed which prevents the possibility 
of improvement. 
There are many explanations for such a situation, the chief 
of which has just been stated. In the end all explanations 
go back to a failure of the school to grasp the social signifi- 
cance of its work, to see the importance of taking pains with 
young people, enlisting their interests, and making the 
school seem vital and important and real to them. A prin- 
cipal and a body of teachers who regard such labor as too
-P-A-G-E-319
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 308 
much trouble, who feel that they are not paid for work out- 
side of school hours, or who have become afflicted with 
labor-union conceptions of the teaching service will quickly 
produce such a condition. One of the most unruly and so- 
cially most inefficient schoo] systems with which the writer 
ever came into close touch was one in which the teachers had 
formed a teachers’ union, the purposes of which were stated 
to be “‘to shorten the hours of labor, increase the compensa- 
tion, and advance the professional interests of all.” The 
first two purposes were the important ones. In five minutes 
after the schools closed in the afternoon one could seldom 
find a principal or teacher about a building. It was often 
a good wager as to whether the principal, teachers, or chil- 
dren would get away first. There was much truancy and 
many occasions for discipline, the instruction was lifeless 
and socially ineffective, the parents seldom visited the 
schools except when sent for or to complain, the private 
and parochial schools in the community were flourishing, 
and the community interest in public education was low. 
Yet in school systems of this type one occasionally finds a 
school or two, and more frequently rooms here and there, 
where quite a different attitude is evident and where that 
something called school spirit pervades the work. 
What is school spirit? Every school, naturally, has some 
kind of a school spirit. There may be a spirit of insubordi- 
nation or of /ndifference, or an anti-social attitude. These 
types, though, are not what is usually meant by the term. 
Instead, we have vraduallycome to use it as signifying some- 
thing better and more social — a certain subtle something 
which motivates and gives purpose and life to the work of 
the school. Using a term made common in the World War, 
it might well be described as school morale. 
It is not an easy mattzr to define what is meant by the 
right kind of school spirit, though its absence in a school is
-P-A-G-E-320
  304 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
easily recognized. When absent, its lack is noticed at once 
by the experienced observer. When present, it stimulates 
and energizes all. Its influence is felt in every department 
of the school’s activity — in the classrooms, on the play- 
grounds, about the building, and on the streets. It is re- 
sponsible to a large degree for the good feeling, cheerful 
manner, school loyalty, and team work in evidence on every 
hand. Often, too, it expresses itself in a spirit of healthy 
pride, and in friendly rivalry with other schools. The dis- 
cipline is materially decreased, the cases are simpler and 
more easily handled, truancy and tardiness are greatly di- 
minished, while corporal punishment and the expulsion of 
pupils practically disappear. The principal is less often 
called upon for disciplinary service and consequently has 
more time to think and plan and supervise, while the super- 
intendent’s office gives but little thought to the school. 
School spirit is a contagious something, and ‘soon spreads 
throughout a group from the one infected with it. 
The principal creates this spirit. Probably in no single 
aspect of the organization and administration of a school is 
the statement that ‘“‘as is the principal, so is the school” 
more true than in the creation and maintenance of a good, 
strong, healthy school spirit. If the principal loves his work, 
if he is adapted to the service, if he is possessed of a good 
qvorking philosophy for the educational process, if he thinks 
and plans well, if he believes in young people; if he has energy 
and executive capacity, if he possesses that ability to fire 
others with his own enthusiasmefor ideals and service, he 
can usually make over a school according to his own desires. 
Tf he lacks some of these qualities he should try to cultivate 
them, for nothing will help him more in his work, attach par- 
ents and pupils to him more closely, or do more to transform 
his school into a constructive agéat for ministering to the 
social needs of a modern world than will the awakening

among his pupils of a strong, healthy school loyalty and 
spirit. 4 
How he goes about doing this is of the utmost importance. 
He may know perfectly well just what kind of a school spirit 
he would Jike to develop in his school, but by proceeding 
along wrong lines he may utterly fail to create it. In few 
places in his work will a practical knowledge of child psy- 
chology stand him in better stead. To talk to the pupils 
and tell them that they have no school spirit, that they 
ought to do this way and not to do that way, that they 
ought to be ashamed of their actions or of themselves, that 
some other school has so much more spirit than have they 
— these are sure ways to kill what little good spirit may ex- 
ist. It cannot be stimulated that way. On the contrary, 
little talks about school spirit, and an emphasis on the con- 
structive work which tends to awaken and develop spirit 
and ideals will be the most effective means a principal can 
use. He must create it by getting the pupils interested and 
busy rather than by too much talking about it, though a cer- 
tain kind of talking, as we shall point out in the following 
chapter, is very valuable. 
\What means touse. Just what means a principal should 
use in the work of creating a strong school spirit for his 
building will vary somewhat with conditions which he may 
inherit, the character of his teaching force, the presence or 
absence of an assembly room, and the stage in development 
in which he finds his school. We shall briefly enumerate 
certain means which may be used, placing them somewhat 
in the order in which probably they will be most serviceable. 
1. Make the instruction good. As has been previously 
pointed out, the improvement of teaching technique is one of 
the best means for improving order and discipline. A busy 
school is almost sure to be an interested and an easily-con- 
trolled school. If the teachers are not very capable, it is es-  
-P-A-G-E-322
  306 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
pecially important that the principal give careful attention 
to this first of all. He must so arrange whatever else he has 
to do as to find much time to give to the supervision of 
instruction and the improvement of classroom technique. 
Through helpful suggestions, teachers’ meetings, and se- 
lected reading, he must gradually build up not only the 
technical skill of his teachers but a professional pride in 
what they are doing as well. On the side of discipline they 
should be shown how to mechanize the routine work of a 
classroom so as to handle it rapidly and effectively, using 
pupils as helpers whenever pupils can assist advantageously. 
On the side of general conduct some attention should be 
given to good manners, and to the general human relation- 
ships expressed in the usages of society. On the side of the 
instruction itself, much attention should be given to the 
motivation of the course of study and to means for promot- 
ing effectiveness. Many opportunities come in history, lit- 
erature, civics, and geography which an alert teacher can use 
to good advantage in giving to the pupils proper social and 
civic ideas. Good teaching, interested teachers and pupils, 
and well-motivated instruction lie at the very foundation of 
school spirit of the right kind. 
2. Monitorial service. To make use of the surplus energy 
of the pupils, and especially of the more troublesome ones, 
in performing all kinds of little services about the school is a 
‘step toward building up school spirit and warding off trou- 
ble. A number of such services have been suggested in the 
preceding chapters, such as having pupils assist the teachers 
in various minor ways about the rooms — distributing and 
collecting papers and supplies, opening windows, cleaning 
blackboards, recording thermometer readings, collecting 
waste paper, etc. — and as room attendance officers, room 
and playground health officers, fire-drill officers, school flag 
details, managing the signals, street-control traffic police,
-P-A-G-E-323
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT . 807 
managing the school bulletin board, oversight of the little _ 
ones on the playground, an accident squad, and similar 
forms of pupil activities. All such means require a little 
time at the start to interest the pupils and train them for the 
service, but the time is well spent, as it in turn relieves the 
principal and teachers from routine work. The pupils en- 
joy looking after such matters and regard their selection as 
an honor. 
8. The playground games. Athletics offer large opportu- 
nities toa principal and teachers to organize the older pu- 
pils, both boys and girls, into groups and squads in a way 
that will do much to develop leadership. Often an incipi- 
ent school tough may be made into a useful school citizen 
by making him an assistant playground director. In the 
games which are played, and especially the inter-school 
games, many opportunities for the development and expres- 
sion of a school spirit and school loyalty are provided. To 
work off the surplus energies of a school in hard active 
play is a good way to shunt off trouble. . 
There ought to be in each school some teacher who would 
be willing to help the girls, and another the boys, in the 
matter of organizing and helping to direct the play and 
games of the pupils. The principal will find it time well 
spent occasionally to give part of his Saturdays to the games 
of his pupils, and to help them prepare for inter-school con- 
tests. To be selected to umpire a ball game or to referee a 
contest is an honor he should be glad to accept. It is a con- 
crete expression of the pupils’ belief in his good judgment 
and fairness, and is worth much to him in the daily work of 
the school. One main reason why discerning parents to-day 
pay large tuition fees to private schools for the supervision 
of the education of their boys is that the private schools 
make a strong point of giving to their pupils just this type of 
activity supervision and leadership training.
-P-A-G-E-324
  308. THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
4. Organization of group activities. There are numerous 
other group activities which it is desirable to organize within 
or about a school. In the conduct of these the different 
teachers can render much service, as one teacher can take 
charge of the development of one group activity, another 
teacher of another, etc. Some of the possible activities of 
this group type are a school orchestra, a musical club to at- 
tempt more difficult work than the regular classwork pro- 
vides, singing clubs for learning familiar songs for the pure 
enjoyment of it and also to entertain at assemblies, sewing 
clubs, cooking clubs, canning clubs, gardening clubs, bird 
(Audubon Society) clubs, nature-study clubs, hiking clubs, 
story-telling clubs, civic clubs, health leagues, etc. Such 
organizations often mean the adopting and transforming of 
the gang spirit. School gardening can often be made a very 
important spring undertaking, the work being done after 
school hours, and if an exhibit and prizes and ribbons can 
be added, it awakens much interest. 
Which of these activities to organize will depend largely 
on the interests and abilities of the teachers and on the local 
environment, as well as somewhat on the season of the year. 
Do not attempt to organize more than one or two at a time. 
In connection with these various activities a school picnic 
may be given, once a year in the spring, in which the differ- 
ent clubs take charge of the arrangements and entertaining. 
5. Scouts and Leagues. The Boy Scout and Camp Fire 
Girls or the Girl Scout organizations ought to find a place 
in each school, and some teachers ought to be interested 
enough to train themselves as Scout Masters and take 
charge. If the principal should have done this at some time 
and become a member of the Advisory Council it will be 
good. Whether a man or woman principal, few things are 
likely to give him or her a better hold on the boys and girls 
than to be familiar with and interested in the Scout work.
-P-A-G-E-325
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 309 
Another useful organization of a similar type is the Girl Re- 
serves, an organization affiliated with the Y.M.C.A. The 
opportunities for enlisting service, building up a school 
morale, and toning up the whole school through the help of 
these organizations, are many and should not be neglected. 
Pupils of the Scout age are easily enlisted in service, and 
service is a prime feature of the Scouts. A Scout is a friend 
to all. He is a big brother to every other Scout. To intro- 
duce such a spirit on the school grounds and about the build- 
ing is most important. There is a spirit of adventure and 
romance in the Scout organization. There is a lesson to be 
learned and the Scouts are usually eager to learn that lesson, 
whether it be a lesson in nature-study, first-aid, kindness to 
animals, courtesy, or what not. There is an appeal in the 
drills and the “hikes” and the required accomplishments, 
and in these boys participate with enthusiasm. The girls 
have equivalent lessons which they take pleasure in learn- 
ing. One of the reasons for the strong spirit of the Scout 
organizations to-day is that they teach their members to feel 
that there is a strong relation existing between them and so- 
ciety in general — that their organizations foster manliness, 
self-reliance, personal honor, truthfulness, helpfulness, serv- 
ice, and similar civic and social virtues. 
There are certain other forms of service-organizations 
that can be made to present a strong appeal if properly car- 
ried on, though they are not so easy to put on a running ba- 
sis as are the Scouts. The Junior Red Cross, school health 
leagues, and school civic leagues for the study and enforce- 
ment of local regulations have been made valuable adjuncts 
to school work in many places. The Junior Red Cross is do- 
ing good work generally; in one city known to the author a 
local school health league codperated with the city health of- 
ficer to clean up and make sanitary the dirty part of the city 
in which the school was located; in another city the pupils 
   
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
organized their school as a city, for school governmental 
ends; in still another city, the children of the whole city 
codperate, by paper sales, service, entertainments, etc., to 
help maintain a free dental clinic for the children of the 
city. 
6. School entertainments. School entertainments, while 
requiring work, are generally worth their cost in time and ef- 
fort in building up a school loyalty and spirit, and in inter- 
esting parents in what their children are doing. Entertain- 
ments, in which many organizations participate, may be 
given to raise money for things the school may need, such 
as play apparatus, a projection lantern, a moving-picture 
machine, a Victrola and records, school pictures, ete. Keep 
the entertainments simple and representative. Have the 
pupils, not a few but many, prominent on the program. 
Try to do something that the pupils like to do and the par- 
ents like to see, and which will be somewhat representative 
of the school work. An annual school fair, or exhibit of 
work, to which the parents are invited and at which the pu- 
pils act as hosts, is another device sometimes used in build- 
ing up school spirit among both pupils and parents. 
7. The school assembly. Not many elementary schools 
possess a school assembly room large enough to seat all the 
pupils at one time, but where such does exist it is a school 
gain to take a quarter of an hour at the beginning of each 
day for a school assembly, if the school is organized as a 
grade school. Group work can be made much more effec- 
tive than can the individual room exercises. If, on the 
contrary, the school is organized as a platoon-type or 
Gary-type school, neither the opening assembly nor opening 
room exercises will be needed, as the regular use of an as- 
sembly room by groups of classes throughout the day is 
provided for in such a type of school program. The assembly 
work then becomes one of the activity subjects of the school.
-P-A-G-E-327
: 
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 311 
Even under these conditions a weekly school assembly is de- 
sirable, as school spirit rather than group spirit is built up 
here. 
The assembly is so important and so useful, both in de- 
veloping a school morale and as a teaching institution, that 
the subject will be considered more at length in the chapter 
which follows. 
8. The school savings bank. The institution of the school 
savings bank has usually been found a very useful adjunct 
in developing school spirit. While the main idea is to teach 
thrift and the value of money, it also, if the idea gains mo- 
mentum in a school, becomes another means of developing 
that form of healthy rivalry which contributes to the forma- 
tion of a school spirit. Instead of the teacher doing all the 
work, it is a good plan to use eighth-grade pupils for the 
clerical work. It gives them practical experience and a 
sense of pride in their own importance. The pupils are like- 
wise proud to be the possessors of a bank book. 
9. Outside influences that help. In addition to all the in- 
fluences within the school which have been enumerated as 
helping in the creation and maintenance of a school spirit, 
much valuable assistance can also be obtained by gradually 
enlisting the codperation of certain forces without the 
school, as will be described more at length in Part V of this 
book. Chief among these are the Parent-Teacher organi- 
zations, any School Improvement League that may exist, 
and the press if the city be small. 
The pupil-government idea. Another method of build- 
ing up a school spirit that at times is made to work well, but 
which has to be approached very carefully and dealt with 
very intelligently, is that of using the pupils in a somewhat 
formal way as participants in the school government. Full 
school government in an elementary school seldom works 
even reasonably well, due to the youth and extreme individ-
-P-A-G-E-328
312 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
uality of the pupils. There is a tendency, too, to concen- 
trate attention on the elections and then to leave to the offi- 
cers the whole matter of the school government. Certain 
elements in the pupil self-government idea, however, are 
capable of application in the control of an elementary 
school. These cannot be inaugurated all at once, but year by 
year, as pupils and parents become accustomed to the idea 
of that individual self-control toward which any adaptation 
of the idea tends, the responsibilities for order can be shifted 
more and more from the paid employees of the school board 
to the pupils themselves. 
Notwithstanding what has just been said, very elaborate 
plans for pupil government have been worked out and used 
with apparent success by a few principals here and there. 
The Jane Brownlee plan, worked out a few years ago at 
Toledo, and widely advertised, is a good example. The suc- 
cess of all such plans depends ultimately upon the principal 
and teachers behind the plan. Any successful plan for self- 
government in an elementary school requires stronger disci- 
plinary skill on the part of the authorities than does the ordi- 
nary type of school control. A young principal in particular 
should be very sure of his ability to control a school and se- 
cure good conduct from the pupils under ordinary condi- 
tions before experimenting with any elaborate plan for self- 
government by the pupils themselves. 
Partial plans and adaptations. A number of simple and 
partial adaptations of the pupil-government idea have al- 
ready been described, such as pupil control and direction of 
the playground games, pupil attendance officers, pupil po- 
lice, pupil health and first-aid officers, use of the Scouts, stu- 
dent handling of assemblies, and, in certain types of cases, 
student determination of punishments to be imposed. Of- 
ten it is best to stop with these features as being about all 
that the peculiar conditions within the school and the neigh-
-P-A-G-E-329
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 318 
borhood seem to make desirable or possible. Sometimes, 
on the contrary, it is perfectly safe to go further. 
One simple plan, used here and there very effectively, is 
that of making the eighth-grade class feel a certain responsi- 
bility in the conduct of the school. ‘The suggestion is given 
them that they set a pattern and establish an atmosphere, 
somewhat as do seniors in the high school or in a college. 
The principal and the teacher of the class make them feel 
that they consider them as anxious as they themselves are 
to maintain the best possible school spirit, and they and the 
other teachers also encourage the younger classes to make 
themselves ready for their responsibilities when it shall 
come their time to serve. Confidence in this class is shown 
by sharing with it many little duties and honors, and by 
making its members feel that they are of much importance 
in the management of the school. 
The school council. Another simple plan, which certain 
principals have made work rather effectively, is that of 
creating a student council and using it to give pupil support 
to good ideas in school control. One plan used was to have 
each room, above the second, elect a boy and a girl to the stu- 
dent council of the school. Another was to have each room 
above the second elect but one person, boy or girl as they 
might decide, and then have also on the council the presi- 
dent or head of each registered organization (the council to 
determine the registration, according to rules), such as ath- 
letic clubs, music clubs, Scouts, Audubon Society, etc., as 
ex-officio members. This plan naturally brings to the council 
the leaders and framers of opinion of the school. Some- 
times the pupils also select one or two teachers to be on the 
council with them. It is usually best that this be done. In 
any case the principal is a member ex officio and the guiding 
genius of the council. 
This council meets once a week to consider school affairs
-P-A-G-E-330
  $14 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
and problems, and all general regulations for the school as a 
whole are first approved by it. Such problems as yard con- 
trol, care of building, throwing papers, conduct in the base- 
ments, Halloween control, annoying neighbors, snowballing, 
lines, drills, special entertainments and programs, and ath- 
letic events are talked over, and any needed rules concerning 
them made. Much valuable elementary training in par- 
liamentary procedure can be given in such an organization. 
What the council considers is actually in large part what the 
principal and teachers have previously planned, and the 
council can nearly always be brought to decide as the school 
authorities wish. The pupils, though, think that they are 
making the decisions and promulgating the regulations, and 
in consequence enforce what they have decided upon. Still 
more, at assemblies or in class, what has been talked over 
and decided is reported and explained, and often student 
sentiment on a proposal may be polled, or enlisted by the 
class leaders. 
Handled carefully, this type of organization can be made + 
very effective means for creating and maintaining a good 
helpful school spirit. If some other school does something 
good or wins some special recognition, the pupils begin at 
once to plan to do something better. As everything done 
van easily be made subject to keeping up the class work and 
having a good attendance record, the organization becomes 
a leverage for good school work as well. 
The school-captain$ plan. Another adaptation of the 
pupil-control idea, which one principal known to the writer 
has carried on very successfully for years, consists of the ap- 
pointing by the principal and teachers of one boy and one 
girl, each half year, from the eighth grade, to act as captains 
general for the boys and for the girls. These pupils then 
appoint, from among the older pupils, as many assistants, 
known as captains, as they deem necessary. These cap-
-P-A-G-E-331
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 315 
tains, under the direction of the captains general, take over 
the supervision of the building and grounds, from 8.15 to 
4.00. The captains general assume full responsibility, and 
are the only ones the teachers or principal consult in case of 
any irregularity. 
Captains are assigned for duty to handle the hallways, 
basements, toilets, playgrounds, ring the bells, care for ap- 
paratus, look after the lines, supervise the games, collect 
any information asked for by the principal, take the attend- 
ance records and look up absentees, collect fines, and protect 
property from damage. Each captain is given authority to 
impose discipline as in his or her judgment the case may re- 
quire, reporting to the captain general. Any pupil or par- 
“ent may appeal to the principal, who may be seen by any 
one with a grievance. He may confirm or reverse a deci- 
sion. The regulations enforced are those of the school, 
though the captains may propose new regulations or the 
modification of existing ones, and these become effective if 
approved by the principal. 
The School Congress idea. Another adaptation, some- 
times used effectively, is the School Congress idea, in which 
a constitution is adopted by an elected Congress, somewhat 
after the model of our national Congress. This School 
Congress works through committees, a committee being ap- 
pointed for each of the main activities of the school, such as 
school-ground control, playground supervision, attendance, 
discipline, complaints, color guard, games, field days, thrift, 
health work, special entertainments, speakers, etc. The 
purpose here is civic training, as well as school control, the 
plan being to make every pupil feel that he is an interested 
and responsible member of the school community, and that 
what he does is of importance in helping to create a good 
school spirit and a school of which all may be proud. 
Results of such pupil-control plans. Such plans, when
-P-A-G-E-332
316 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
they can be inaugurated under good conditions and be 
backed by the right school spirit, are very valuable aids in 
control and do much to teach young people to govern for 
themselves. They do not relieve the principal and teachers 
of the duties of oversight nor of the holding of control in the 
background, but they do change his work and that of his 
teachers from that of detectives to advisers, and greatly de- 
crease the necessity for classroom and school-ground control. 
Such systems tend to break up gangs, decrease jealousy and 
bitterness between pupils, and do away with the spirit of 
trying to beat the teachers at a game of wits. They intro- 
duce the ‘‘ Big Brother” idea into control, and relieve princi- 
pal and teachers of any immediate building and yard super- 
vision. They tend to promote frankness and honesty and a * 
new attitude toward law and order. 
Need for this work in our modern society. The great so- 
cial and industrial changes in the past three-quarters of a 
century, with the accompanying development of city life, 
have thrown a new responsibility upon the school for the 
proper education of the young in much that makes for use- 
ful and successful living in organized society. The home 
has undergone great changes in nature and spirit and pur- 
pose, while both life and education have become specialized. 
In consequence, the home to-dayJeaves to the school a large 
amount of training which once formed no part of the func- 
tion or purpose of the school. The modern city is essen- 
tially a center of trade and industry, and home life and 
home conditions must inevitably be determined by this 
fact. The city, too, emphasizes education through the eye 
and the ear, but gives little through actual doing. Children 
under the older home conditions, too, were taught rever- 
ence, courtesy, respect, proper demeanor, obedience, hon- 
esty, fidelity, virtue, and useful employments much more 
than they are to-day. The coming to our cities of large
-P-A-G-E-333
BUILDING UP A SCHOOL SPIRIT 317 
numbers of foreign-born children, and especially those from 
the south of Europe, has further complicated the educa- 
tional problem. , 
To remedy some of these defects of our modern city life, 
to give pupils some useful education through doing, to cre- 
ate for them good standards and habits, to awaken the 
spirit of fair play, good sportsmanship, and high ideals of 
honor and righteousness in the social and civic life, are new 
opportunities and obligations of the modern school. Our 
school organization and instruction cannot be divorced from 
these essentials without the loss of valuable possibilities. 
The cultivation of a strong and healthy and loyal school 
spirit, by some such means as are indicated above, helps 
greatly not only in control, but, even more important, in 
preparation for civic usefulness and social participation. 
Difficulties the principal will meet. This spirit of loyalty 
and idealism and service is not easily built up. Teachers 
often lack sympathy with the idea, and consider the time 
and effort required as completely beyond the benefits de- 
rived. Sometimes petty jealousies and animosities among 
the teachers undermine it, or prevent its creation. The pu- 
pils are at first shy of such organizations, and have to be 
dealt with carefully. Sometimes the parents think it is all 
nonsense and object. It has to be nurtured patiently year 
after year through its period of infancy, until a feeling of 
pride in the school because of what it does for one can be 
built up, and then transformed into a feeling of pride in 
one’s self and a willingness to be of service to one’s fellows. 
Such a spirit, once built up and carried along, often persists 
after principal and teachers have departed and the spirit of 
the school has changed. As evidence of this, one not infre- 
quently reads, in our cities, of a meeting and banquet of the 
“old grads” of some grammar school, thus bearing witness 
to a spirit that once existed and to a leader no longer there.
-P-A-G-E-334
318 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Sometimes, on the other hand, it takes the form of a testimo- 
nial of affection to some principal, retiring after a quarter- 
century or more of service in one particular school. 
In all this work the personality of the principal and the 
wisdom of his guidance are of much importance. A school, 
as well as any other human institution, moves forward or 
backward according to the quality of its leadership. It is 
the principal who must conceive the problem in its larger as- 
pects, he who must think it through, he who must secure for 
it the sympathetic interest and codperation of his teachers, 
and he who must guide and guard it in its development. Of- 
ten he can do this best if he thinks his plan through and then 
outlines it to his teachers but slowly, making his moves one 
at a time. ‘Teachers are easily frightened if they think 
their burdens are to be materially increased. As the differ- 
ent pupil agencies are developed the principal and his teach- 
ers must set aside time for the purpose of keeping in touch 
with the work they do, and the pupils must be made to feel 
their real interest in what is accomplished. A principal and 
teachers who have faith in children and in their power to 
govern themselves, and who train their pupils to have con- 
fidence in themselves and in their ability to do so, are the 
ones who make a system of pupil-government successful. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
. Will such conditions as arg described on page 303 almost inevitably 
follow such an attitude on the part of the teaching force? 
. What is the effect on the spirit of a school (or a class) of lecturing 
or scolding those present for the faults of those absent, or the 
many for the actions of the few? Under what conditions may this 
plan still be useful? 
. In the school buildings shown in Figures 5 to 10, in what ones would 
it be easiest and in what ones most difficult to develop a good school 
spirit, assuming teachers and pupils to be the same? Why? 
. In assuming charge of a school which has but little good school spirit, 
and in attempting to build it up, would it pay to take the time from 
classroom supervision which this new work would for some time de- 
mand? Why? .

. Assuming that you decide to inaugurate a number of group activities 
to develop a better school spirit, as described in 3 to 6, pages.307-10, 
indicate how you would like to use your teachers for service in such a 
building as is drawn in Figure 7, page 98. 
. Suppose that your teachers have no special ability in any of these lines, 
and while not unwilling are not interested. What means would you 
take to get them into service? 
, Show the large values in citizenship training of health leagues, Junior 
Red Cross, Scouts, school civic leagues, and the school savings bank. 
. Why is the group assembly, in a grade-type school, so much better 
than individual room exercises? 
. Some teachers and principals object to assemblies of the whole school 
each morning as (a) a waste of time, and (b) likely to promote disorder. 
What of these objections? 
Why is it a good idea to give special importance and position to the 
highest class in the school? 
Why, in a school council, is it desirable to bring in the natural leaders 
of the school? In starting such an organization it may bring in the 
leading school toughs. Would this be harmful? 
Suppose an old couple, living near the school, complain to you about 
the annoyance and discourtesy they are subjected to by the pupils of 
your school. What would you do, assuming it to be a legitimate case 
for complaint, (a) if you have no pupil organizations for control, and 
(b) if you have a school council or school captain plan in working 
order. 
In a certain city known to the writer a group of men, between the ages 
of forty-five and sixty, meet once a year for a dinner and to tell stories 
of their school days. The group is known as the “old boys” of the 
Lincoln (elementary) School. What conclusions do you draw from 
this? 
When labor strikes occur much lawlessness frequently results. Do 
you see any connection between this and the type of imposed disci- 
pline usually found in our schools? : A

  CHAPTER XVII 
USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 
Arranging for school assemblies. Another very important 
means for assisting in building up a school spirit which will 
materially aid in the elimination of tardiness, truancy, and 
disorder is the proper use of the school assembly. Many 
elementary schools, unfortunately, do not have an assembly 
room in which all or even half the pupils can meet together. 
Where this condition exists, the principal must resort to 
various expedients to try to obtain for his school the advan- 
tages that come from assembly periods. Sometimes this 
can be done, in good weather, by more or less frequent exer- 
cises in front of the school or in the yard. As the pupils 
must of necessity stand, these periods should be short, held 
only in good weather, and must be carried through with 
more snap and go than would be needed were the pupils 
seated in an assembly hall. If bleachers, such as are shown 
in the Figure 8 school, exist, they may also be used for good 
weather meetings of parts of the school. A larger lower 
central hallway, such as is shown in the Figure 5 school, 
may also be used for group assemblies. Basement play- 
rooms may be utilized at times. 
Where there is an assembly hall in the building the princi- 
pal should utilize it for general meetings. Sometimes all 
the school should meet together, and in some schools it may 
seem desirable that this plan be followed regularly. Per- 
haps most of the time, however, the little ones, say the kin- 
dergarten and grades I to III, should meet separately from 
the grades from IV up. One suggestion as to meetings 
would be:
-P-A-G-E-337
USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 321 
Wednesday General meeting of all pupils. 
Monday, Thursday Kindergarten and Grades I-III. 
Tuesday, Friday Grades IV-VIII. 
Another plan, though not so good, would be to have sepa- 
rate assemblies as the regular thing, on alternate days or at 
different times of the day, and joint assemblies only on such 
special occasions as Thanksgiving, Christmas exercises, 
February 12 and 22, Arbor Day, Longfellow Day, etc. The 
time given to the meetings, when the assembly hall is used, 
should be about, fifteen minutes, with the time extended 
possibly once a week to twenty-five or thirty minutes, if 
something especially interesting is put on. 
Importance of the assembly period. The value of an as- 
sembly period in unifying the work of a school and in giv- 
ing tone and spirit to what is done is not fully appreciated 
by many principals and most teachers. Too frequently the 
principal carries it on largely because it is prescribed, or be- 
cause in a general way it is thought to be a good thing to get 
the pupils together, while the teachers look upon it as a 
waste of teaching time. On the contrary, if rightly used, it 
is one of the most important periods of the day. A live 
principal can use this period as a means of getting a firm 
grasp on his whole school. Others may do much of the work, 
and the better he has it organized the more this will be the 
case, but he must keep in touch with all that is done and 
through it all stamp his personality on the work of the 
school. 
The assembly, rightly used, offers a splendid opportunity 
for the awakening of that intangible but highly desirable as- 
set called school spirit. It is here that the principal and his 
teachers and his pupil aids may create and build up that 
school spirit which is so useful for effective school control and 
for united effort. A school which can have assemblies, and 
which does not stress the importance of this period, loses a 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
  822 TERE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
great opportunity to arouse school loyalty and an To 
to be useful and to succeed. 
The principal and the assembly period. Too often the 
assembly period fails of usefulness because it is misused and 
mismanaged. Dry ceremonial, listless routine, a religious 
atmosphere or too much emphasis on religious observances, 
and an insistence on perfect order on entering and while 
there, invariably fail to produce results. The assembly, too, 
must not be a cut-and-dried affair. If the pupils know the 
nature and order of the exercises, and about what songs will 
be sung, the assembly will not make any strong appeal. 
Neither should the time be used for collective scolding and 
fault finding. Anything of this nature, as well as “sermon- 
izing” by the principal, are certain to be fatal to school 
spirit. Not much time, either, should betaken for announce- 
ments. If announcements are to be made, do it with a 
clear decisive voice, in a businesslike manner, and with dis- 
patch. Ifa bulletin board, or the classroom, or the school 
recess after-whistle period would serve better, do not use the 
assembly time. Nor should a principal use the assembly 
period often as his time for talking. There must be variety, 
and what is done must appeal to the izterests of the chil- 
dren and be suited to their needs and capacities. 
Yet at times the principal should take the assembly in 
hand and talk, using the period to fix more firmly his grasp 
on his school. For such times he must make preparation, 
and know just what he is going to do and how he is going to 
do it, For a young principal to go before the assembled pu- 
pils without detailed plans is most unwise. It is to him that 
the young people naturally look as the leader and final ar- 
biter of the school. They recognize in him the head of af- 
fairs, and he ought by his assembly manner and speech to 
fix their faith in him and to awaken their admiration for the 
way he does things. It will not be possible for a principal to  
-P-A-G-E-339
  USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 323 
fix their faith or win their admiration if he fails to measure 
up to their ideas of him at these important times. If he 
conducts the assemblies as though they were a bore to him, 
if he seems weak and forceless, if he is unnecessarily stern 
and severe, or if his conduct as the pupils observe it does not 
square with his talks, he will awaken instead their disrespect 
— secret it may be, but none the less forceful. Hesitancy, 
weakness, vacillation, a fault-finding attitude, an excess of 
seriousness, lack of a sense of humor, or an exaggerated idea 
of his own importance may spoil the whole effect. What- 
ever the principal does should call for his best effort. 
“Heart-to-heart” talks. If the right kind of relations 
have been established between the principal and his pupils, 
he can at times use the assembly period most effectively to 
appeal to the best side of the young people. The children 
of the early adolescent period are idealistic to a high degree, 
and are easy to set afire with enthusiasm for good things. 
The principal is the one to supply the spark. Rightly used, 
the principal can make ‘these little talks, once good relations 
have been established, one of the strongest disciplinary 
agents in his school. He must be forceful, quick, good- 
natured, appreciative, and constructive to be effective. 
At times the principal will need to talk directly to the pu- 
pils regarding some misconduct on the part of the school, or 
some needed change in the direction of school activities. 
Then he must be very clear in his own mind as to what he 
wants to accomplish and the means he must use, and he must 
be very concrete and talk in terms the pupils will understand. 
By making practical application to the needs of the moment 
he can, if he uses tact and skill, develop loyalty, ideals, ap- 
preciation, patriotism, and other virtues of a well-managed 
school. By occasional intimate talks on matters of school 
control, the general attitude and discipline of a school can be 
materially improved, and the school property protected in-
-P-A-G-E-340
324 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
stead of destroyed. By making the youngsters see that af- 
ter all the school is their school, and that only foolish people 
destroy their own property, school depredations can be re- 
placed by school protection. By talking simply but con- 
cretely and effectively on questions of civic responsibility, 
human relationships, morals, ambitions, and ideals, by skill- 
fully seizing an opportunity presented to drive home great 
life lessons, and by talking with enthusiasm but not sancti- 
moniously, the principal may leave a lasting impression for 
good with the young people under his control. 
Types of assemblies. A number of types of assemblies 
may be conducted with advantage, and quite a little variety 
in type is desirable. At times, as has just been described, 
the principal may use the assembly period to “put over” 
some idea he wants the pupils to get. Sometimes a teacher 
may present the program for the day, or some citizen be 
asked to speak. The assembly may at times be used for im- 
parting information of general interest to the school, or for 
showing the place of the school in work or in competitive 
events with other schools of the city. In all these types the 
principal and his teachers conduct the assembly and present 
their points of view. Within limits, this type of assembly 
can be made very effective. 
Another type is that in which the pupils as a whole parti- 
cipate, as in chorus singing, and in expressions of school loy- 
alty and spirit. Mass singing is a very attractive and effec- 
tive means for developing school spirit. Some schools use a 
song, often selected by the pupils, as the first number of 
every assembly. Some teacher who can lead well and put 
vim into the singing should take charge. It is important 
that there be some swing and go to the affair. On certain 
days special “song assemblies” may be found desirable. 
School loyalty and spirit demand opportunity for expres- 
sion, and at times the assembly can well be given over to an
-P-A-G-E-341
  USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 325 
enthusiastic outburst of it. An occasional “booster as- 
sembly” has its place and use. 
Most of the assembly periods, though, should be given 
over to the work of the pupils themselves. The assemblies 
will be much more potent influences in developing school 
spirit if the principal and teachers remain somewhat in the 
background. In the case of divided assemblies, the smaller 
pupils will naturally need more help than will the older pu- 
pils, but even here the little ones can be led to take part and 
do much that is interesting to them. To the extent that pu- 
pils can be trained to feel that the responsibility for inter- 
esting, helpful exercises is theirs, will the assembly period 
achieve its maximum usefulness. To enlist the activity of 
the pupils in the programs, and to have this activity shared 
by as many as possible, is a wise procedure. To use organi- 
zations within the school, such as classes, leagues, scouts, 
and clubs, is better than singling out individuals. 
A good principle to keep in mind is that the exercises the 
pupils present should have an element of instruction in them, 
and should be of a character likely to affect favorably their 
ideas and aspirations. Another good rule is that nothing 
presented by the pupils should partake of the nature of a 
big “‘performance.” The aim should be social and educa- 
tional, and the pupil offerings should be largely summaries 
of projects actually growing out of the everyday classroom 
work, given for the purpose of entertaining or instructing 
others. The exercises should also be short enough to hold 
the attention of the youngest pupils present. 
When this type of assembly program is being presented it 
is best for the principal and teachers to remain off the plat- 
form, leaving to the pupils the explanations and presenta- 
tion of their program. Occasional questions asked by the 
principal or teachers or pupils may be helpful rather than 
otherwise, but any interruption should be very brief. Let
-P-A-G-E-342
  826 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the older classes select their own presiding officer, master of 
ceremonies, or stage manager, announce their numbers, and 
present their program. This adds to the interest, teaches 
proper procedure, emphasizes the importance of clear enun- 
ciation, develops self-confidence, awakens a sense of respon- 
sibility, and trains pupils to work in codperation. Do not 
expect perfect order and quiet in this type of assembly, as 
there is bound to be a certain amount of disturbance, but it 
is usually of the harmless kind. 
Types of assembly programs. Many different types of 
assembly programs, using the pupils, may be thought out 
and made to work successfully by an interested group of 
teachers and a principal directing the activities of the pupils. 
A few typical ones will be cited here. 
1. Musical assemblies. At these a short musical pro- 
gram would be presented. There may be part-singing, folk- 
songs and dancing, patriotic songs, chorus work, orchestra 
assembly, victrola days, or some person from outside the 
school may sing or play for the entertainment and instruc- 
tion of the pupils. 
2. Literary exercises. Reading old poems, telling of sto- 
ries, dramatization of stories, and pantomimes are examples. 
3. Demonstration assemblies. Work of the Boy Scouts 
and the Girl Scouts. Demonstrations of simple experi- 
ments or of useful information. 
4. Historical and geographical. Talks on other lands and 
peoples, often illustrated by lantern slides or other means. 
A talk on a foreign country by some one who once lived 
there or who has visited there may prove interesting at 
times. 
5. Health work. Talks and demonstrations regarding 
health matters can be made very interesting and instructive. 
Food, exercise, sleep, care of one’s body, accident preven- 
tion, germ carriers, importance of a clean water supply, milk
-P-A-G-E-343
  USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 327 
tnspection, work of the health department, cleaning of the 
streets, disposal of garbage, work of the visiting nurse, and 
work of the Junior Red Cross are all types of subjects. 
6. Civic talks. Good relations with the city officials can 
be made useful here. A brief talk by the mayor, a juvenile 
court judge, the superintendent of parks and streets, the 
health officer, a police officer or fireman in uniform, the 
treasurer of the city, or the superintendent of schools, on 
their work for the city, can be made helpful, and makes 
friends for the school. This is not possible in large cities, 
but in smaller places such talks can usually be arranged. 
7. Talks by citizens. Short talks by alumni of the school 
who see the value of their education, and by successful 
business men and citizens who know how to “get over” a 
short message to young people. Sometimes these talks will 
seem interesting to the children and will serve to make 
friends for the school without being especially good in them- 
selves. Banking, thrift, success in business, selecting a 
career, and qualities that make for success in life are types 
of subjects for such talks. 
8. Special-day assemblies. Brief programs for such days 
as Longfellow day, Lincoln day, Arbor day, Fire-Prevention 
day, Thanksgiving, and similar occasions. Such special- 
day programs might be a little longer than the usual assem- 
bly program. 
9. Special “movie” programs. If the school has a moving 
picture booth and machine, some special programs of an ed- 
ucational type may be presented, once a week or so. These 
may come at the morning assembly or, possibly better still, 
at a special, voluntary-attendance assembly of thirty min- 
utes or so at the close of school in the afternoon. Such films 
as making steel, the whaling industry, a coal mine, the city 
beautiful, birds of the southern coast, California, plant or 
animal life, the Yellowstone Park, health films, automobile
-P-A-G-E-344
  328 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
manufacture, etc., are interesting and instructive. The 
Pathé weekly news films are also good. 
Class responsibility for programs. On pupil assembly 
days it is a good idea to have the various classes (and teach- 
ers) assume responsibility for the program. With the sug- 
gestion and guidance of the teacher the class chooses the 
type of work it will present, organizes the program, and 
carries it through. The assembly period thus serves as a 
stimulus to clear thinking, good organization, and distinct 
enunciation, as the children soon learn that unless they have 
something to say and say it in an interesting way they will 
not be able to command the attention of the school when 
they stand before it. Divided up in this way classes are 
not called on for programs very often, and have plenty of 
opportunities to think out, prepare, and try to excel in what 
they do. Ina sixteen-room school having one common as- 
sembly a class would not be called on for a program oftener 
than once a month. 
The pupils should be encouraged to present things that 
are interesting to them — experiences they have had, things 
they have seen or studied, or classroom successes they have 
made. Folk dances, rhythmic games and drills, good singing, 
science demonstrations, dramatization of a story, reading of 
a poem or story, results of some study — these are types 
of what a class may present. Dramatization of historical 
events, Greek myths, Indian legends, and simple stories fur- 
nish excellent material. Dramatization and class programs 
are particularly useful for such occasions, and may well be 
especially encouraged. In such work each child has a part © 
to perform, and in the effort to carry it through in such a 
way as will be acceptable to the audience and fit in with the 
work of his classmates certain desirable results are certain 
to be achieved. The ability to codperate is stimulated in a 
way that mere classroom instruction could not do, and self- 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 329 
confidence and the acceptance of responsibility naturally re- 
sult. : 
An aim in all such work to be kept in mind by principal 
and teachers is that of arousing in the children the feeling 
that they are all members of a single school family, and as 
such have certain duties and obligations which make for the 
pleasure and profit of all. This leads directly into good cit- 
izenship. 
The period should be one to which the children will look 
forward. Interest must not be allowed to lag, or the activi- 
ties be allowed to settle down into arut. It should be the 
period when some kind of a surprise may be expected by the 
children at almost any time. 
A month’s program. To illustrate the possibilities of the 
assembly period, a month’s program, as worked out by one 
school, may be given as a type. 
First WEEK 
Monday The Kindergarten — Activity selected by the 
teacher. 
Tuesday Seventh Grade—Germ carriers. Illustrated by 
lantern slides, two pupils explaining. 
Wednesday A graduate of the school — Talk on “The Work of a 
Life Saver.” 
Thursday Chorus songs — Two sixth grades. 
Friday Eighth-Grade debate — Boys against girls. Ques- 
tion: — Resolved, that the automobile has been 
more useful to mankind than the horse.

Hood.

Fourra Wrrex 
Monday Performance by the school orchestra. 
Tuesday The Audubon Club — Bird protection. 
Wednesday The principal — Pictures from Fairchild’s book on 
moral training, with brief comments. 
Thursday Seventh Grade — Accident prevention. 
Friday Flag Day — History; salute; singing of national 
songs. 
Similar programs, bringing in an almost endless variety of 
topics, could be planned and carried on from month to 
month and from year to year. One good feature is to open 
one assembly each week, or the weekly assembly where only 
one general meeting is held, with the flag salute. Have one 
boy act as color bearer, and one as color guard, the latter 
giving the commands, “Attention,” “Salute,” etc. 
The platoon school or Gary-type assembly. With the de- 
velopment of the platoon school and the Gary-type school a 
somewhat different type of assembly program now becomes 
possible, though the types described above may be contin- 
ued with smaller groups. As will be remembered from the 
descriptions given of this class of schools in Chapter IX, the 
assembly now comes in as a regularly scheduled school exer- 
cise, just as does reading, arithmetic, play, or science, and is 
in charge of a teacher. The assembly room, too, while it 
may be large enough to accommodate the school as a whole, 
can now be used when so small as to hold but two or three 
classes at one time. Even assuming a large assembly hall, 
where the entire school can meet together on occasions, the 
major use of the assembly period will still be by small
-P-A-G-E-347
  USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 331 
groups. From two to four classes (see programs, pp. 154-56) 
now meet together, with one or more teachers in charge, and 
carry through a series of programs, day after day. The 
purpose, in addition to the acquirement of knowledge, is to 
train in self-confidence, expression, parliamentary proce- 
dure, codperation, the assumption of responsibility, and the 
development of leadership. The assembly period being 
longer, usually about thirty minutes, the programs can be 
longer, and the emphasis need not be placed so strongly on 
quick work and snap in the proceedings. 
It is rather common to develop a formal organization. 
The groups may elect a president and a secretary who con- 
duct the meetings, and often keep written minutes, and a 
more consecutive program may now be carried out. Not 
uncommonly a week is given to a topic by the older grades. 
The following program, carried out in a Gary-type school by 
two seventh grades, may be taken as illustrative. 
First Werk — General topic — Safety First. 
Monday The increase in the number of accidents.

Each program in this school occupied thirty minutes. Each 
month a president and a secretary were elected to manage 
the assemblies, and a committee on program worked with 
the teachers and assigned parts. Each meeting was called 
to order by the president, the minutes for the preceding day 
were read and corrected, and the program, usually consist- 
ing of about three five-minute papers or talks, with occa- 
sional lantern slides shown and explained by the pupils, was 
presented. Some general discussion often followed, and the 
meeting was properly adjourned at the end of the period. 
Judged by adult standards the programs and the procedure 
were at times not very good, but the children thought they 
were all right and entered into them with zest. To them 
they had a sense of reality and importance which was after 
all one of their best features. 
Other values of the school assembly. As a means of elim- 
inating tardiness and reducing absence a good school as- 
sembly organization is worth more than an attendance officer. 
If the programs are short, full of variety, and interesting, 
about the only cases of tardiness are those with perfectly 
satisfactory excuses. The author knows of one large-city 
school where the introduction of such assembly periods as 
have been described reduced the tardiness from near three 
hundred cases a month to almost nothing. 
The discipline is also made much easier, in part by reason 
of the new interest created, and in part because problems of 
school control can be discussed with ease before all, and the 
best side of the pupils’ nature appealed to. Little intimate
-P-A-G-E-349
USE OF THE ASSEMBLY PERIOD 333 
talks on matters of school control, as the need for them 
arises, will do much to give pupils right conceptions and to 
bring about the right reactions. 
The athletic life of the school can be in large part con- 
trolled through the school assembly. Occasional athletic as- 
semblies may be held, before some inter-school contest or 
after some big victory, in which the pupils will formulate 
their conduct and explain team work. Praise for sports- 
manlike conduct and for gameness and fairness in play, 
rather than for victories won, goes a long way in creating 
proper attitudes. 
As a means for motivating the classwork, awakening a 
healthful school spirit, increasing the interest and working 
capacity of the pupils, training for bearing responsibility, 
imparting useful knowledge and ideas, forming life ambi- 
tions, and stimulating to self-activity, the assembly is prob- 
ably worth more in results than any other fifteen minutes of 
the whole school day. In arousing a good school spirit on 
the part of the pupils that in turn finds expression in an in- 
terest on the part of the parents, the assembly also has a 
value which is well worth acquiring. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. What possibilities would there be for holding an assembly in the case 
of any one of the schools shown in Figures 5 to 8? 
2. Could any type of assembly desired be held in the schools shown in 
Figures 9 and 10? 
8. Do you agree with the importance of the assembly, as stated in this 
text? Why? 
4. Suppose an inter-school athletic contest is to be held on Saturday, and 
an athletic “booster assembly” is to take place on Friday morning. 
The young people have not yet caught the spirit of fair play and sports- 
manship. The principal has three minutes to speak, along with the 
captains and leaders, and he chooses to use his time to urge fine sports- 
manship and clean play, regardless of victory. Outline, or write out, 
his three-minute speech. 
5. Outline a month’s assembly program, similar in form to the one on 
page $29, for the school shown in Figure 10, assuming it to be conducted 
as a grade school.

CHAPTER XViil 
KNOWING THE SCHOOL 
Preparing the way for supervision. While the list of organ- 
izing and administrative duties so far given may seem quite 
formidable to one who has never been a principal of an ele- 
mentary school, the list, after all, need alarm no one. In 
‘the first place, the organization duties, as outlined in Part 
‘II, will very largely have to be anticipated before the open- 
ing of school in the Autumn, or be mostly attended to dur- 
ing the first week of school, and thereafter will require 
watching and minor adjustments to keep things running 
smoothly rather than long periods of attention. The ad- 
ministrative duties, outlined in Part III, will in part require 
daily or weekly attention, though, if the work is properly 
programmed and the help of teachers is used, no inordinate 
amount of time will be required on any one day, always bar- 
ring some unexpected trouble or “flare-up.” ” Quite a large 
part of what has been outlined, too,.can be tied onto and 
made a portion of the work of school supervision, to be out- 
lined in this‘section of the book. This will be especially 
true of the health supervision, strengthening the teacher in 
government, the assembly-period work, and in part also of 
the work in building up a good school spirit. Organization, 
system, and careful planning beforehand can do much to 
decrease the time needed for administrative duties, and to 
increase that left free for school supervision. 
As was said in the beginning, in Chapter III, the prime 
importance of the supervisory function cannot be gainsaid. 
It ought to be made the great constructive service of the 
head of the school. All that he does in organization and ad- 
ministration should look toward bringing teachers and pu-

  338 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
pils together under conditions most likely to be conducive to 
good instruction, which he, by his superior knowledge and 
skill, may then labor-to make still more effective. To do 
this the principai must first come to know his school, as it re- 
lates to the pupils and the instructional organization; must 
know what the courses of study and the plans of the superin- 
tendent call for, and then lay his plans for as liberal an in- 
terpretation of these as is permissible and possible; must de- 
sign his supervision carefully, so as to secure maximum re- 
sults for the time he puts in on it; must measure and evalu- 
ate the instruction and the progress made under it; and must 
be able to interpret his aims and conceptions and the results 
of their work to the class teachers themselves. The first - 
step in such a program is for the principal to know his school 
thoroughly. This calls for a knowledge of his community, 
his teachers, his pupils, and the parents. 
Knowing his community. The character of the city it- 
self — residential, manufacturing, agricultural, and trading, 
predominately native American or foreign-born, relative 
wealth, general character and tone, and conception of the 
importance of education — will somewhat determine the 
types of schools found in the city as a whole. In every city 
of any size, however, the character of the individual schools 
varies greatly in different parts of the city, and different ed- 
ucational problems present themselves to different princi- 
pals for solution. The principal must accordingly know 
much as to the nationality, racial elements, occupations, 
home life, culture, relative wealth, belief in the school, and 
general character of the people whose children attend his 
school. The relative patronage of private or parochial 
schools by the people of his district is another element of 
importance to know. 
Much of this information he will sense during the first 
week or two of his work as a principal. An exploratory
-P-A-G-E-355
KNOWING THE SCHOOL 339 
trip through his district will reveal much as to the character 
of the homes, and a tabulation of the school census cards or 
the pupil enrollment cards, for nationality, occupations, chil- 
dren per family, and similar data, will give him still more 
accurate information which it will be good for him to know. 
All this, though, is merely preliminary, relatively easily 
obtained, and requires but little interpretation. The more 
important knowledge relates to the children in the school — 
their position, advancement, intelligence, and needs. 
The census reports and his school. Another type of 
somewhat general information which a principal ought to 
have and use is information as to the drawing and holding 
power of his school. This can be obtained from a study of 
the school census cards and the records of his school. Itisa 
type of information to be compiled as he or his clerk has 
time. In some cities it is compiled at and provided by the 
central office, and as a phase of the research activities of the 
school department. If not so provided, the principal ought 
to compile it himself, doing it a little at a time as he finds 
leisure from other duties. It would be a good Saturday job. 
This information ought to include such items as: 
1. Percentage of the school census of his district, for the ages 
represented by his school, enrolled in his school, over a period 
of years. 
a. If low, how explain the large number not in? 
b. Is the percentage increasing, or not? 
2. What is the drawing power of his school, as shown by: 
a. The regularity of school attendance? 
b. Attendance from his district at private and parochial 
schools? 
ec. Is the drawing power increasing, or not? 
d. Use of the compulsory attendance officer. 
8. What is the holding power of his school, as represented by: 
a. Average ae and attendance, based on enroll- 
ment? 
b. Children who remain beyond the compulsory-age limit?
-P-A-G-E-356
340 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ce. Children who complete the highest grade in the school? 
d. Children who go to high school? 
4. Plot a curve for his school, showing the relation of his enroll- 
ment and attendance, by grades, with the total possible en- 
rollment, and also with the percentages for the city as a whole. 
All this information, when collected, makes good chart 
material, useful both at teachers’ meetings and at Parent- 
Teacher meetings, and often is good material to display in 
the office. With a view to its use for such purposes it ought 
to be charted on cardboard or heavy paper, large enough to 
be seen across a room when hung up. The regulation card- 
board, 223’’ X 28}/’, makes good charts. With paster hang- 
ers, set with eyelets, which may be purchased and attached 
to the charts, they may then be hung on a frame to stand in 
the office, or be moved from place to place. Such a frame 
can be made in the manual training rooms. The next best 
material after cardboard is heavy manila paper, or muslin, 
cut to some standard size. As a principal ought to prepare 
many such charts, to show graphically the work of his school, 
it is well to plan from the start for some standard form and 
method for display. 
The age-and-grade distribution sheet. A still more im- 
portant type of statistical data that every principal should 
collect early in the year is that showing, by rooms, by 
grades, and for the school as a whole, the age-and-grade dis- 
tribution of the children in his school. To this end each 
teacher should turn in to him, quite early in each school

lower heavy line, marks off those who~eze one year over age. All cases 
below the dotted line should be investigated.

  842 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
year (or term), an age-and-grade distribution sheet for the 
pupils in her room. These will show room distributions, 
and the data can be combined for grades and for the school 
as a whole. A principal who has been in a building for a 
number of years may be presumed to know fairly well the 
nature of the distribution existing in his school, though 
many do not, but for a principal new to a school such an 
age-and-grade distribution sheet is most important, should 
be made up early, and the results should be given careful 
study. On page 341, a school distribution sheet is shown 
for an elementary school of 560 pupils, which we may as- 
sume is for the school shown in Figure 7, page 98. This 
school has a kindergarten and eight grades, the upper three 
being organized on the departmental plan. 
This table (VIII) has been made up on the assumption 
that semiannual promotions are in use in the school, and 
on the basis of what are probably the best age-limits to use. 
The plan employed is to count children as of normal age who 
range from three months too young to three months over the 
strict age-limits for the grade. Taking the first grade, for 
example, children would be considered of normal age for the 
lower division (1B) who range from 5 years 9 months to 6 
years 9 months in age, and for the upper division (1A) who 
range from 6 years 3 months to 7 years 3 months. This al- 
lows a leeway of three months in each direction for each half- 
grade, or grade, or, stated another way, a range of eighteen 
months for each year grade. Such tables are frequently 
made up where this leeway at the bottom is not allowed in 
counting, though children lacking two or three months of full 
age are commonly permitted to enter in September or Febru- 
ary. Insuch tables the age-limits for each grade begin with , 
the even year, as 6 years for the first grade, 7 years for the 
second year,etc. Such tables, on the other hand, commonly 
allow from one and a half to two years for the grade limits, 
by ranging only upward from the basa! age. Thus, for first
-P-A-G-E-359
  KNOWING THE SCHOOL 343 
grade, the range would be from 6 to 73 years, or from 6 to 8 
years. A better plan, it seems to the writer, is the one used 
in Table VIII, which allows a year for each half of a grade, 
and a year and a half for the whole grade, but with a leeway 
of three months in both directions instead of all at the upper 
end. ° 
The two heavy lines seen on Table VIII then enclose the 
children who are of normal age for the grade by this method 
of calculation. The children indicated by numbers above

the upper heavy line are those who are ahead—the acceler- 
ated; those below the lower heavy line are those who are not 
up to grade for their age — the retarded. The dotted line, 
below the lower heavy line, marks off those who are less than 
one year over-age for the grade from those who are more 
than one yearover-age. The cases above the dotted line may 
not be important; those below should be investigated to de-
-P-A-G-E-360
344 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
termine causes for their low position in school. Accelera- 
tion and retardation can then be measured in terms of the 
number of years the pupil is under-age or over-age for the 
grade, and the percentage of acceleration and retardation in 
a school may be determined in yearly or half-yearly divi- 
sions. Making such a calculation from Table VIII we get 
the results shown in Figure 17. 
The type of school revealed. Figure 17 gives the distri- 
bution of the pupils for the whole school, given in Table 
VIII, and shows at a glance the amount and the distribu- 
tion of both the acceleration and the retardation in this 
school. Combined with Table VIII, the condition of the 
school is clearly revealed. Unless some explanation for 
the condition shown can be adduced, it may be said at once 
that not enough pupils are ahead of grade, and that too 
many are behind grade, though the condition in this school 
is better than in many that might be found. Table VIII 
also shows that the retardation increases steadily to the 
sixth grade, and then almost disappears. It further indi- 
cates that the pupils are held in school by the compulsory 
school-law until the compulsory school age of fifteen years 
is past, and then drop from the school, and also that the 
holding power of the departmental organization in the 
sixth, seventh, and eighth grades is small. 
While many schools would show a worse age-and-grade 
distribution than does this school, still the small number of 
accelerated pupils, and the much larger number of retarded 
pupils, ought to call for some inquiry as to the reasons there- 
for. If we assume intelligence to be about evenly distrib- 
uted, as Terman’s studies indicate that it is, and that there 
are approximately as many bright children as dull children, 
. then the number accelerated after the second or third grade 
ought approximately to balance the number retarded, un- 
less there is some special explanation for the situation in 
   
-P-A-G-E-361
KNOWING THE SCHOOL 345 
this school. A glance at Table VIII shows that late en- 
trance to school has not been much of a factor in the re- 
tardation, as most 1B children have entered school in their 
sixth-age year. : 
Causes for this condition. To find the reasons and the 
remedies for such a condition may require some time. If 
the retardation is especially heavy in a school, and no partic- 
ular attention has been given to it in past years by princi- 
pal or teachers, a concentration of effort on the problem will, 
in time, give’ positive results of value. In one school of 
which the writer knows, a five-year study of acceleration and 
retardation furnished the results shown in Figure 18. Many

schools, in which no continued study of age-and-grade dis- 
tribution tables has been carried on, would present con- 
ditions similar to those existing in this school in 1917, when 
the new principal took charge. Teachers tend constantly, as 
Terman has so well shown, to hold back the bright children 
who ought to go on, while the dull ones, by reason of failures

in promotion and lack of special attention, tend to mire 
down deeper and deeper in the grades. 
Room and pupil studies will reveal the cases and the 
causes of much retardation, and on the basis of such study 
individual promotions and readjustments may be made. 
An example of such room-and-pupil charting is given-in Fig-

then is a pupil age-chart for the room or grade. 
The good results arising from making a reduction of re- 
tardation one of the major objectives in such a school, as
-P-A-G-E-363
KNOWING THE SCHOOL 347 
was indicated in Chapter III to be desirable, and holding to 
the idea for a five-year period, is well shown in Figure 18. 
It will be seen from this figure that for this school, at least, 
the principal has now fully reached what the economist calls 
“the point of diminishing returns.” His problem from 
now on will be to see that he holds things about as they are, 
and that the old conditions do not reassert themselves.

the problem of retardation is that of finding the rate of non- 
promotion by grades, and the chief causes for non-promo- 
tion by grades and by subjects. Suppose that a tabulation is 
made of the failures in promotion by grades, and the results 
are charted, for this same school, for the last four semi-an- 
nual promotions, and suppose that the conditions shown in 
Figure 20 are revealed. 
Such a result would be about what might be expected in 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  348, THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
such a school as is charted in Table VIII. After a certain 
amount of holding back in the first grade, promotions go 
along rather evenly for the second and third grades. Then 
non-promotion begins to mount in the fourth grade, and 
climbs high in the fifth and sixth grades. The pupils who 
persist to the seventh and eighth grades are promoted rather 
well at the end of these grades. About the same rate of pro- 
motion has apparently prevailed in each grade for the past 
four times. The question for the principal now is, are these 
rates of non-promotion high, low, or about right for his par- 
ticular school, and, if high, can anything be done to lower 
the rate without lowering promotional standards. The an- 
swer to these questions may require some study of condi- 
tions. If low, the traditions of the school may be at fault. 
If high, the pupils may be a somewhat dull or lazy lot; the 
school may lack spirit; the instruction may need toning up; 
the courses of study and books used may not be properly 
adjusted to the needs or interests or capacities of the 
pupils; individual pupils may need special attention; or 
other factors may be found that will explain the condition. 
Let us suppose that the school records also show in what 
subjects the non-promoted pupils were adjudged deficient, 
and that the principal tabulates these records to see if they 
throw any light on the retardation problem. The results he 
obtains by tabulating are as given in Table IX. This table 
shows at once how a few subjects bulk large in holding 
pupils back, and indicate clearly where courses-of-study 
adjustments, change in emphasis, or the improvement of 
the instruction are needed. 
A new aid in pupil classification. Enough has been 
shown by the tables and drawings so far used in this chapter

number of pupils one still finds who are markedly over-age 
for their grade is large, despite recent efforts to reduce re- 
tardation, and also despite the rather common tendency of 
teachers and principals to promote pupils somewhat on the 
basis of their age and physical size. 
Largely within the past decade an entirely new aid in the 
determination of the proper placement of school children 
has been given us in the form of the newly devised intelligence 
tests. Coming first as individual tests, and during the 
World War expanded into group tests, we to-day have well- 
standardized instruments for use in determining the mental 
capacity of school children, both individually and in groups. 
The group tests enable one to test a group or class at a time, 
and their chief value lies in the rapidity with which the
-P-A-G-E-366
350 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
group or class may be given a first sorting to determine the 
intelligence of the different pupils composing it. The indi- 
vidual tests have their chief use as a means of verification 
and for a still finer determination of what the group test has 
revealed. 
Of the tests we have for use at present, the following prob- 
ably are to be recommended as best to use for testing pu- 
pils of the different grades and ages indicated.

Use of intelligence testing. The ability to give intelli- 
gence tests to pupils, and to interpret the results, may by 
now be said to have become a necessary part of the equip- 
ment of every elementary school principal. Even in cities 
which provide special service for such work, it is important 
that the school principal be familiar with and be able to sup- 
plement the work done. So important has intelligence test~ 
ing become, in the handling and proper placement of pupils, 
that it is no exaggeration to say that what the blood count 
is to physical diagnosis the mental test now is to educational 
diagnosis. 
By means of intelligence tests it is now possible to deter- 
mine, with accuracy, the mental age of any pupil, as distinct 
from the chronological age. With this new device we have 
not only found that children of the same chronological age 
differ widely as to mental age, but that, taking large groups 
of unselected children, there are approximately as many

children of superior ability, per thousand, as there are of in- 
ferior ability. A distribution curve for intelligence of any 
age-group is an approximately symmetrical curve, extend- 
ing from feeble-mindedness at one end to genius at the other, 
but with the great mass of pupils in the middle, at or near 
normal on the curve. This is well shown by Figure 21, 
which gives the variations in intellectual capacity of an un- 
selected group of first grade school children, as found in the 
entering classes of the schools of Oakland, California. 
What intelligence tests may reveal as to class groups. 
Intelligence tests have also shown us that practically every 
unassorted school class contains pupils varying widely in 
mental age, and hence in their ability to profit by the in- 
struction given. A class all of which are of the same chrono- 
logical age may vary widely in mental ages, whereas a well- 
selected class of pupils of widely differing chronological ages 
may be of approximately the same mental age. ;In a gen- 
eral way it is usually the case that those who are oldest in 
age for the grade are lowest in intelligence, and vice versa. 
It might, for example, be, that the school shown in Table 
VIII, and charted as to acceleration and retardation in Fig- 
ure 17, is after all a well-sorted school, so far as mental age 
is concerned. The same might possibly be true for the 5B 
class, charted in Figure 19. Despite the wide age variations 
shown, the pupils of this 5B class might be of nearly the 
same mental age, and the situation in consequence not be so 
bad as it appears at first sight. 
On the other hand, when charted for mental and chrono- 
logical age, grade 5B might possibly reveal such conditions 
as are shown in Figure 22. A class of school pupils showing 
such wide variation in mental and chronological ages calls 
for careful study and for some reclassification. A glance at 
Figure 22 shows at once that such a group of children can- 
not be expected to do average grade work, even under a very

ought to be sent to special classes. On the other hand, three 
pupils at least ought to be given an opportunity for promo- 
tion elsewhere. Such a group may look fairly well sorted to 
the casual visitor, but anything approaching the conditions 
shown in Figure 22, when charted, reveals the impossibility 
of school success with such an ill-assorted group. 
Once the mental age of each child is known, the principal 
can now construct a Mental-Age-Grade School Distribution 
Sheet, following the same form as Table VIII, except. that 
the numbers of pupils in each space on the table will now 
show the number of pupils in each grade of each mental-age 
group, instead of the chronological ages as in Table VIII. 
The two tables, then placed side by side, will present an 
interesting comparison, and reveal at a glance the capacity- 
character of the school. A series of detailed room studies, 
similar to the one given in Figure 22 for the 5B grade of
-P-A-G-E-370
  354 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Table VIII school, will show the individual capacity-char- 
acter of the different rooms. Such room studies as Figure 
22 can be made quickly with a pencil on cross-section paper, 
and erasures and additions made as pupils come and go. 
Importance of graphic methods and of the new psycho- 
logical tools for the school principal. It is by such means 
as have been indicated thai a principal should come to know 
his school as a whole, and each grade and class in it. The 
time taken in making the tabulations will well repay the in- 
vestment. It is only by means of such studies that the true 
conditions and needs of a school can be ascertained, and only 
by means of intelligence tests that the true character and 
possibilities of a school can be determined. The principles 
involved in the construction of age-grade distribution tables 
and the charting of ordinary statistical data can easily be 
mastered. Charts are too valuable as a means for display- 
ing facts to be neglected in the administration of a school. 
The results, though, are for the information of the school, 
and should be given to parents but rarely. The results of 
the intelligence tests should almost never be given to par- 
ents, and never by teachers. In the hands of parents such 
information leads to talking, criticism, bragging, and com- 
parisons which often lead to serious trouble. 
Intelligence testing calls for a somewhat special type of 
skill — a type of skill that requires some instruction to be- 
come proficient in using. Yet the educational significance 
of the results obtained from measuring the intelligence of 
the children of a school are so important that the work can- 
not be neglected much longer. If the city does not provide 
a psychological expert to do the testing, or if some teacher 
in the building is not skilled in the work, then the principal 
must learn how to do it himself. As a means for determin- 
ing accurately the ability and needs of entering pupils the 
intelligence test is unsurpassed, as Figure 21 shows at a
-P-A-G-E-371
  
KNOWING THE SCHOOL 355 
glance. More than all other forms of data combined, the 
intelligence test gives the necessary information from which 
a pupil’s possibilities can best be foretold, and his further ed- 
ucation be most profitably directed. The many questions, 
too, that arise in a school relating to grading, promotions, 
choice of studies, delinquency, vocational guidance, and the 
handling of sub-normals on the one hand and gifted children 
on the other, can all be handled far more intelligently when 
working with the results of intelligence tests at hand. In 
the handling of all peculiar or irregular cases the intelligence 
test has now become a matter of necessary routine which 
the principal of a school should know how to employ. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Show that the plan used in determining normal age for a grade is in 
keeping with our usual method of counting pupils as of normal age 
who enter the first grade at six, and pass to the high school at fourteen. 
2. On the above basis of counting, are not the pupils shown on Table 
VIII, between the lower heavy line and the dotted line, actually re- 
tarded pupils, though by a common method of counting they are not 
considered.as so? 
8. Would acceleration and retardation approximately balance one an- 
other in a well-graded school? Why? 
4. What effect would late entrance to first grade make on an age-grade 
distribution table? For how long? 
5. If the reduction of retardation were made a major objective for a num- 
ber of years in a school, what checks could be introduced to prevent too 
rapid promotions, with the result that the upper grades would come to 
be filled with unprepared pupils? Is this a real danger? 
6. What specific defects in a school might the promotional results given 
in Table IX indicate? 
7. It is often stated that the ability to read and understand what is read 
is the best single basis for the classification of children, because so 
many different school activities depend on its acquisition. Do you 
accept this? Does Table IX indicate that, it was accepted by that 
particular school? 
8. Explain the tendency to promote over-age and “‘nice”’ pupils, and to 
hold back young but bright pupils. 
9. What does Figure 20 indicate as to promotional bases? 
10. Outline a procedure for dealing with such a situation as is indicated in 
Figure 22. 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  356 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
11. Explain why, in the different schools of most cities, the intelligence 
curve for the children tends to be skewed toward one end or the other 
of the curve, instead of being a symmetrical distribution. 
12. Make up an age-grade distribution chart, as in Table VIII, for the 
school shown in Figure 8, page 99, assuming retardation to be at 
about the same rate as in Table VIII.

  “ CHAPTER XIX 
CLASSIFYING AND PROMOTING THE PUPILS 
The principal and promotional procedure. In but few 
school systems into which a principal may go will he find 
himself at liberty at once to make changes in the system of 
classification and promotion of pupils. Such matters are 
usually settled for him, in advance, by rules and regulations 
applicable to the school system as a whole. His work will 
be rather to carry out the plan as it exists, though generally 
he has power, or will be given power as he convinces those in 
authority that he knows how to use it, to modify the plan in 
minor particulars in so far as it relates to the administration 
of his school. 
Still, despite the fact that the system of classification and 
promotion for a city school system usually is settled in.its 
main essentials for the school system as a whole, and not by 
individual schools, the reverse is sometimes the case. In 
some cities superintendents are willing to permit intelligent 
and enterprising principals, on a proper showing of reasons 
therefor, to modify the existing system and to experiment 
with some different plan. In any case, though, the work of 
classifying and promoting the pupils is of such fundamental 
importance to the successful administration of a school and 
to the proper progress of the children through the grades, 
that a principal should be familiar with the best principles 
of procedure in use, generally, as well as with those in use in 
the particular school system in which he works. 
Type plans for school classification. While many small 
schools still promote their pupils but once a year, and hence 
have their pupils classified into year grades, the most. general 
plan now in use is that of semiannual promotions, This
-P-A-G-E-375
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 359 
divides each school grade into two sections or sub-grades, a 
Band an A. While the nomenclature is not uniform, still 
by far the most common plan is to designate the lower or be- 
ginning section as the B, and the more advanced or upper 
section as the A. This nomenclature will be used through- 
out this volume. Thus a pupil would enter the elementary 
school in grade 1B, and leave it at the end of grade 8A. 
Since there is such difference in practice in different school 
systems, and one must always learn whether B or A means 
low, it would be well if the use of B and A were abandoned, 
in school systems not, following a differentiated type of 
course of study (see Figure 24, page 361) and L and H sub- 
stituted in their stead. 
In the parallel-course school system, shown in Figure 23, 
  Ficure 23. Tae Paratier-Course Puan 
Two parallel elementary-school courses, with one third more work assigned for each year in Course B than in Course A. Pupils may be transferred from one course to the other at any of the five main junction points, or, with slight coaching or slight loss, at ten other points. 
all except the last year of each course is divided into three 
sections, C, B, and A, each one third of a year apart: Ina 
few large city schools a further subdivision is made into four 
sections, D, C, B, and A, with promotions but ten weeks 
apart. This latter plan, however, is not very common, and 
is not feasible except in quite large buildings. Under the 
semiannual promotion plan an eight-room building, with a 72 o 
avy
-P-A-G-E-376
     360 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
school grade to each room, would have an A and a B section 
in each room, and a sixteen- to eighteen-room building could 
still further specialize the work by giving each teacher only 
a B oran A section of a grade, and this, for recitation and 
study purposes, could be still further subdivided into twe 
sections. 
In all the above described plans the different sections may ° 
be moving along at a somewhat uniform rate over a com- 
mon course of study. This is the most common plan. On 
the other hand, and especially in the larger buildings, there 
may be instead some differentiation_in the instruction, and 
the pupils in the different sections may be sorted so as to 
e put them into more homogeneous working groups than any 
grouping on the basis of age or advancement alone can ever 
provide. In such schools one frequently finds as many as 
three sections, C, B, and A, to a grade, with the pupils 
sorted so as to provide slow-moving, average-moving, and 
fast-moving groups. In large schools, at least in the first 
to the sixth grades, one may find from two to three such , 
classifications, on the basis of ability to do work, for each 
half year of a school grade. In such schools there is usually 
some form of parallel courses and a flexible promotion plan, 
of which the so-called Cambridge plan, shown in Figure 23, 
isatype. Almost all other parallel course and flexible pro- 
motion’ plans are more or less a variation of this plan. Un- 
der such plans the time a pupil spends in the elementary 
school may vary from six to eight or more years, depending 
upon ability and school progress. 
Again, in still other schools, though a much smaller num- 
ber, the classification of pupils during the first six grades is 
made on a different basis. For each grade, or half grade, 
there are three groups, C DB and A, the pupils being sorted 
into these groups on the basis of intellectual capacity and 
working sian, land the three groups then work along side
-P-A-G-E-377
  
CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 
by side and at the same yearly 
rate, but following minimum, 
average, and maximum courses 
of study. Such an arrangement 
represents a second main type 
plan of grading and promotion. 
The common form taken is well 
shown in Figure 24, which is typ- 
_ ieal of all such differentiated- 
course plans for grading and 
promotion. While practically 
all pupils here take six years for 
the elementary school course, 
there may easily be transfers 
from group to group within a 
grade, as progress or lack of 
progress may seem to warrant, 
.and even some special promo- 
tions to higher grades. This plan 
attempts to keep each pupil 
' working where he belongs and 
up to full capacity. 
Special plans sometimes used. 
Here and there one also finds 
such a special form of pupil 
classification as grading and pro- 
motion by subjects. Under such 
a plan the pupils are placed in 
the room nearest their natural 
stage of advancement, as for 
example 4A or 6B, but they 
may pass to some other room, 
either higher or lower, to recite |

in which they are either ahead of or behind the class. 
Such a plan necessitates a common school program for 
all fundamental subjects, at least from 3B to 6A, so 
that the pupils may pass from room to room for instruction, 
(and calls for careful supervision on the part of the principal. 
Due to the mixed character of the progress made, the diffi- 
culty occasioned in transferring pupils to and receiving 
them from other schools, and the objections to a common 
school program, the plan has so far found but small accept- 
ance in grade-organization schools. Subdivision of the 
grade into sections based largely on working capacity, flex- 
ibility in promotions, and the provision of a special or un- 
. graded room, are felt by most principals to make better | 
provision for the individual adjustments for which the 
promotion-by-subjects plan attempts to provide. The 
idea, though, as we shall point out later on, is in modified 
form a useful one with over-age children. It has also been 
successfully employed in Gary-type and platoon-type 
schools. 
An even more special plan, still occasionally used, is that 
of individual progress and promotion, following the main 
outlines of the plan worked out many years ago at Pueblo, 
Colorado, and often termed the Pueblo plan. Under this 
plan individual pupils, or more generally four or five small 
groups of pupils within a room, make individual progress in 
each subject, the advancement of any pupil being deter- 
mined by his capacity and willingness to work. Only a very 
capable teacher can handle sucha plan. It is much better 
adapted to use in the high school than in the elementary 
school, and where tried wholesale in the grades almost in- 
evitably results in hopeless confusion. 
Homogeneous working groups. All our studies as to the 
intelligence and working capacity of school pupils have 
brought out forcibly the great differences existing among 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
sede 
CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 363 
children of the same age, in these two important respects. 
Figures 17 and 19 show the age differences that commonly 
exist among pupils of the same school grades, and Figures 
21 and 22 bring out even more strikingly not only the wide 
distribution in the amount of intellectual endowment pos- 
sessed by pupils of the same age, but also the wide varia- 
tions existing between mental and chronological age. 
«What is wanted, in each working group, is a fair balance 
between the work to be done and the capacity of the pupils 
to do it. Even a few ill-assorted cases, at either end of the 
scale, interfere tremendously with the ability of a teacher 
to render good service to a group, and such pupils ought to 
be placed in groups elsewhere where the work is nearer 
their needs and capacities. Each pupil, we know, has a cer- 
tain inherited capacity for thinking, and this inherited ca- 
pacity we know from intelligence testing varies widely with 
different pupils of the same age groups. In addition, each 
pupil has a certain ability to do, lower than his actual in- 
herited.capacity, and this also varies with pupils of the same 
inherited capacity. This difference is due to the effects of 
or the lack of certain specific training which pupils have or 
have not had. There is, still further, the actual perform- 
ance of the pupils, which may be and in many cases is still 
lower than their actual ability to do. This difference be- 
tween ability to do and actual performance may be due to 
low physical tone, bad sanitary conditions, laziness, lack of 
intellectual stimulus, or other somewhat similar causes. 
Whatever the cause, it should be one of the purposes of the 
school to diminish this difference between ability to do and 
actual performance by removing obstacles to progress and 
stimulating to activity. 
The work of the principal then, as it relates to grading 
and promotion, is to see that the pupils are sorted into work- 
ing groups which are as homogeneous in intellectual capac-

ity and working power as is possible with the school organi-— 
zation at his command. He must study his problem and, if 
necessary; try to reshape or expand his working organiza- 
tion with a view to improving its usefulness to the pupils of 
his particular school. Often this can be done as needs can 
be proven; sometimes financial limitations or administra- 
tive rigidity will prevent any changes or expansions being 
made. 
Means for obtaining homogeneous working groups. To 
secure and maintain working groups throughout his school 
as homogeneous as possible, the principal must so use what- 
ever plan or plans he may be permitted to employ as to 
obtain the maximum possible results in the placing and 
progress of the children under his control. While different 
plans or systems for grading and promotion may prove help- 
ful, in different ways, he must not forget that in employing 
these the most important single guiding tool at his command 
will be the intelligence test.’ It is on the basis of intellectual 
capacity, rather than on age or size or effort, or even the 
judgment of teachers, that the rate of advancement of indi- 
vidual pupils must largely be determined. He must also 
not forget that the important thing for a pupil is that he be 
placed where his ability to work will be most deeply chal- 
lenged, and that frequently; as shown by educational tests, 
there is little difference in the achievement of pupils in 
grades one or two years apart. What a pupil loses by skip- 
ping a grade is frequently much more than compensated for 
by placing him where he will work to better advantage. 
There are four main situations in which a principal may 
find himself in the matter of the grading and promotion of 
his pupils. Under perhaps the simplest of conditions he will 
(find a uniform course of study and an annual or semiannual 
promotional plan in force, and with no special rooms or 
coaching teachers provided. Under such a plan he will have
-P-A-G-E-381
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 365 
to make his adjustments wholly by means of special promo- 
tions, and such variations in the course of study as are 
permissible. (A somewhat better condition will be that in 
which, in addition, he will be provided with one or more 
special or ungraded teachers and rooms to assist him in mak- 
ing pupil adjustments and transfers.to other-classes. Again 
he may find himself in a school having parallel courses of 
study, with pupils traveling at different rates and perhaps 
with one or more special teachers and rooms to facili- 
tate adjustments.) In a fourth situation, he may be work- 
ing in a school with differentiated courses of study, the 
different groups doing different quantities and qualities of 
work. UZ 
The first is probably the more common situation, chief 
reliance being placed on special promotions for preserving 
somewhat homogeneous working groups. As yet but a 
relatively small percentage of our elementary schools are 
provided with special rooms and teachers to whom children 
may be sent for special help. Ungraded rooms, opportunity 
rooms, rooms for sub-normals, and disciplinary rooms repre- 
sent special means for sorting and helping irregular or pecu- 
liar pupils, who do not do well under ordinary classroom 
conditions. While such special rooms and teachers are of 
much value and are highly desirable additions to school or- 
ganization, greatly increasing the efficiency of the classroom 
teacher, nevertheless much can be done without them by 
working through the regular classroom organization, pro- 
vided as much flexibility as can be advantageously used be 
introduced into the sorting and grading and promoting of 
the pupils. A few of the means for introducing this flexibil- 
ity will be considered. : 
Promotional rules. Taking the first situation described 
above, the problem of the principal is to so handle his semi- 
annual promotions and the irregular promotions as to ob-
-P-A-G-E-382
366 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
tain the best results for the individual pupils concerned. 
The majority of the pupils, if the school is an average and 
not an exceptional one, one way or the other, will progress 
regularly and normally from grade to grade at the regular 
promotion times. The cases that will need watching are the 
ones at either end of the scale, as well as cases that are trou- 
blesome, from any cause. In a general way the following 
rules as to promotion should prevail: 
1. oe Utilize the teacher’s judgment as to promotion, as much as 
possible, but keep in mind that at times it is quite unreliable. 
If convinced that the teacher is wrong, make a trial promo- 
tion to see. 
. All promotions, regular or otherwise, should be viséd by the 
principal) It is one of his important means for supervising 
instruction. 
. All pupils whom the teacher considers as [unquestionably 
ready, for promotion should ordinarily go ahead. 
. In all doubtful cases; the educational importance of the sub- 
jects in which deficiencies exist should be considered. Differ- 
ent subjects have different promotional. values in the different 
grades, and promotion, subject to a deficiency being made up, 
may at times well be made. 
« Promotions should not be based on the results of final tests, 
Instead, daily class work should be the main factor. A pupil 
may make a low mark in a written test in one or more sub- 
jects, and yet for his own good ought to go on. 
. Ability to do the work of the grade ahead \is more important 
than the passing out of that just completed. 
. Any pupil not promoted at a regular promotional time should 
have the’ right of appeal to the principal, and objective tests 
should then be used to settle the question. 
. Only in very exceptional cases — many experienced princi- 
pals would say never — should a pupil be held back at a regu- 
lar promotional time because of misconduct. Often the best 
cure for troublesome cases is a promotion to work that will 
challenge larger effort. Especially is this the case with chil- 
dren of superior ability: 
. With pupils of average intelligence, a year of advanced work 
is worth more than repeating a grade. Failures in school offer
-P-A-G-E-383
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 367 
good preparation for failure in life. Teachers may object 
to a promotion, and the principal must decide what is best 
to do. 
10. Where no special-rooms-or differentiated courses exist for 
handling pupils of low intelligence it is better to promote 
them, after reasonable trial in a grade, and then not expect full 
work of them, rather than to keep them back where they 
“mire down” deeper and deeper. After one repetition of a 
grade-they will almost always absorb more that is useful for 
them from the work of the grade next ahead. : 
11. As it is easier to promote than to demote, pupils coming in 
from rural or outside schools may at first be placed on trial a 
trifle lower than may seem their due, but proper allowance 4 
-should be made for differences in type of preparation, and 
such pupils should be advanced to a grade of work which 
they are best fitted to do, regardless of whether they may 
have missed some parts of the course of study. 
12. Occasionally a pupil ten to twelve years old will enter school 
for the first time. In such cases the first grade is not the place 
for him. It is better to place such pupils, if they are of normal 
intelligence, in the third or fourth grade, sending them to the 
first for reading, and to wait a half-year or so before definitely « 
fixing their classification. Such pupils properly belong in an 
ungraded room, but where such is not provided the best possi- 
ble makeshift must be substituted. 
Special promotions. _ In a school lacking special teachers 
and rooms, or some form of parallel or differentiated class 
organization, the need for special promotions will be par- 
ticularly marked, and to this phase of his supervisory prob- 
Jem the principal must give some study.) His age-and- 
grade distribution sheets for the different rooms, his records 
as to the intelligence levels and school progress of the differ- 
ent pupils, and his study of the troublesome cases of the 
school will all serve to indicate the pupils who need his spe- 
cial attention. He will probably have to make, too, more 
special promotions than his teachers will approve. Espe- 
cially are they likely to object to the promotion of those un- 
der age for the grade. Studies generally show that it is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
368 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
bright child who is most held back by teachers and in con- 
sequence most retarded in our schools. The teachers may 
also be expected to object somewhat to the promotion of the 
slow and over-aged, as many grade teachers are firmly con- 
vinced that “skipping” means the loss of important work, 
and that the standard for passing to the grade next ahead 
should always be the passing on the work that lies behind. 
There are so many cases on record, though, that show the 
highly beneficial results to pupils of at times jumping whole 
grades or years of work that a principal, once he is convinced 
that such a jump would be to the best interests of the pupil, 
should not hesitate to stretch all the rules of the school in 
making a special promotion. 
In handling the matter of special promotions, in the first 
type of school organization above described, the following 
principles should guide: 
1. The initiative in the case of a special promotion may come 
from either the teacher or the principal, but before action is 
taken the principal should approve. 
2. If the school can give a good physical examination before de- 
ciding, it will be a wise thing to do. If the results of such an 
examination are unfavorable, an extra promotion may well be 
a questionable proceeding. 
8. In most cases it is best to consult with the parents before mak- 
ing the promotion. Especially is this desirable if the parents 
are intelligent people. Sometimes there are health reasons, 
unknown to the school, which might make a special promo- 
tion undesirable. Usually the parents approve, and are 
pleased at being consulted. In case of a demotion parental 
objections are likely to be encountered, and because this is so 
they should be consulted before such action is taken. Often 
they are able to do something to prevent the need for it. 
4, Of the over-size and over-age pupils in a school, a few of fair 
intelligence can usually be singled out who will improve to a 
marked degree when placed in a grade ahead. A partial or 
: trial promotion often spurs them to their best efforts. 
5. When a bright pupil gives evidence of having too little to do
-P-A-G-E-385
10. 
ll. 
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION er) 
it is best to put him ahead where he will have to work harder. 
Trouble is often gaused by lack of occupation. All trouble- 
some cases should be looked up as to intelligence level and the 
character of their daily work. 
. A pupil of good physique, who has outside help that enables 
him to do more work, can often be spurred to larger effort by a 
promotion. 
Partial promotions can often be made to an advanced section 
in the same room, the pupil sometimes reciting in both sec- 
tions, in one or more subjects, until the transition can be 
made in full. ‘ 
. Special promotions ought in general to be made early in the 
term, to insure time for adjustment before the next promo- 
tion. A special promotion, also, ought ordinarily only be 
made when there is a strong probability that the pupil will be 
able to make the regular promotion also at the end of the 
term, as a hold over practically cancels the benefit of the spe- 
cial promotion. 
. In making special promotions ad interim it is best to make 
them as trial promotions. If good judgment is exercised in 
selecting the pupils nearly all will make good, but for the few 
who do not the dropping backward is made easier if the pro- 
motion is at first partial, or on trial. In one school system fol- 
lowing such a plan, known to the writer, the special promo- 
tions during the past year equaled 9.7 per cent of the average 
daily attendance, while the failures to make good of those 
specially promoted was but 4.3 per cent, as against a failure 
rate of 11.7 per cent for the school system as a whole at the 
regular semiannual promotions. 
Sometimes a whole grade or room will be ready for promotion 
before the end of the semiannual period, and in such cases it 
is a good thing to permit the group to proceed with the work 
ahead. Before approving. such a procedure, the principal 
should take the class for half a day and convince himself, and 
the pupils, that the group is ready for promotion. This can 
best be done by means of an oral quiz, and offers the princi- 
pal an excellent opportunity for group supervision. So valu- 
able is this supervisory opportunity that some superintend- 
ents reserve such approval to themselves, in order that they 
may thus test the work of the teachers. 
In the case of special promotions, good conduct, good school 
citizenship, punctuality, and good attention to duty may
-P-A-G-E-386
  
370 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
very properly be insisted upon in addition to good scholar- 
ship. 
12. To stimulate ambition, some prominence may be given, if. 
done tactfully, to the special promotions which are made. 
13. To prevent too rapid advancement, a good rule is that no 
child shall have more than one special promotion in any year, 
nor more than two in three years, unless shown by the Binet 
testa to be distinctly superior in intelligence, and of a mental 
age at least as high as that proper for the grade to which he is 
to go. 
Securing results by individual study. However desirable 
and effective some of the special promotional schemes and 
differentiated courses may be in caring for irregular pupils 
and stimulating acceleration in a school, much that needs 
to be done can be done without their aid, in schools not 
themselves abnormal in type, by either more attention to 
individual cases or by a rather liberal use of the special pro- 
motion. 
In Detroit, for example, the rate of non-promotion, for 
the entire school system, was cut down, in one year, from 
14.7 per cent to 8.4 per cent, without lowering standards in 
any way as proved by the use of the standards tests, by 
means of a systematic city-wide attention to pupil cases, 
‘along the following lines: 
1. Attention was centered upon the needs and difficulties of each 
individual pupil. 
2. The principal or teacher interviewed each pupil privately, and 
the situation was frankly discussed in an effort to arrive at the ° 
cause and find a remedy. 
8. Parents-were visited, called into consultation, or otherwise in- 
formed of the impending failure, and their codperation was re- 
quested. 
4. Pupils were permitted to devote more time to the subjects i in 
which they were weak. 
5. Special help was given by the ungraded-room teacher, or by 
brighter pupils, during or after school. 
6. Weak pupils were required to make special reports to the
-P-A-G-E-387
  
CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 371 
principal, at stated intervals, daily or weekly, upon their 
scholastic progress. 
‘7. Outside*help and study for such pupils were encouraged. 
The procedure was carefully worked out, tests were used to 
see that standards were not lowered, and the attention of 
principals and teachers was concentrated on the ‘#flunkage” 
problem. 
Value of, in school administration. The importance of 
such careful studies of promotions, and the use of special 
promotions where needed, cannot be questioned. There 
is little use for longer continuing a “lock-step” system of 
promotions in our schoels. The special promotion also has 
a good effect on the teachers. Once they catch a vision of 
the possibilities of pupils, and come to regard the course of 
study as a means and not an end, it develops open-minded- 
ness and leads them to make a new kind of study of both 
their children and the subject-matter. With the pupils, it 
does much to stimulate ambition and bring out leadership. 
They learn to look ahead, to plan, and to try to make good 
in a larger way. As#one principal states it, it puts “pep” 
into a school. Pupils see their classmates advancing, and 
begin to inquire what they may do to advance also: The 
discipline of a school is frequently improved in a noticeable 
manner. Bright boys who have been troublesome because 
they found the work too easy develop into leaders for the 
school, once their best efforts are challenged. By holding to 
good conduct in class and good citizenship in the school as a 
necessity for special promotion, many troublesome cases can 
be transformed through the power of work and the stimulus 
of rivalry. 
The usual experience ati a pupil given a special promotion 
is that at first he falls below his former high standing, and is 
compelled to work harder than before to hold his place. 
Gradually, though, if the promotion was a proper one, the
-P-A-G-E-388
  872 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
bright pupil pulls up and becomes at least a good average 
member of the new working group. It is good for pupils to 
have to make such a pull, and to succeed at it. To master 
the work of the new grade, day by day, is of much more im- 
portance than the work missed by skipping. Subject-matter 
is not so closely articulated or so intimately related that it 
must all be done. In arithmetic, spelling, reading, writing, 
composition, and language study there is constant review, 
and the bright pupil can soon master the particular points 
of the grade work passed over. Even in geography. and 
history, where the clearest omissions will occur, there is usu- 
ally a double cycle of study, and if not the loss is usually less 
important than the gain. 
The use of the special promotion then, together with some 
shifting of pupils between stronger and weaker teachers in 
schools large enough to have duplicate grades, tends to 
keep more homogeneous working groups and in consequence 
to make classroom instruction both easier and more effec- 
tive. 
The whole plan, however, it must Be freely admitted, has 
its limitations, and in schools having many pupils of low in- 
telligence and poor home conditions it does not give the 
needed relief. The pupils are passed along when what they 
need is special help, they get beyond their depth, become 
discouraged, and tend to truancy and to dropping early from 
school. Such pupils need the help and classification that 
only special teachers and rooms can give. 
The special, or ungraded room. Where a principal has in 
his building one or more teachers whose function is that of 
supplementing the work of the regular teachers by provid- 
ing some form of help or coaching service, still more can be 
done to provide homogeneous working groups in the regular 
classrooms. Two main types of such special teachers are 
found. These are: (1) the special, or ungraded, or auxiliary,
-P-A-G-E-389
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 373 
or a typical-class, or opportunity-room teacher; and (2) the 
disciplinary-class teacher. {The first type has been provided 
for helpful educational service to particular children; the 
second is disciplinary, the room representing an interme- 
diate stage between the regular classroom and the parental 
school. 
To the disciplinary room, where such is provided, are 
sent, for indefinite periods, those who find themselves un- 
able to conform to the established ways of organized society 
as found in the school. The better the adjustment of the 
promotional machinery to the pupils, and the more pupils 
are classified according to mental rather than chronological 
age and given work suited to their capacities and needs, the 
more the necessity for the disciplinary class will disappear. 
Nearly all disciplinary cases can be analyzed and reduced to 
some particular cause, other than mere perversity, though 
this does sometimes constitute the actuating motive. The 
special disciplinary class has its place and use, but its place 
and use are smaller the more intelligently the classifi- 
cation of pupils is attended to. 
To the other type of special room are sent those pupils 
who need special instruction, either to enable them to keep 
up with their class or to move ahead to the next class. The 
ungraded or special room is thus a real Opportunity Room, 
and is often known as such, because it offers an opportunity 
to those who have fallen behind to catch up, and to those 
who find the work of thé grade too easy to make up deficien- 
cies and move ahead.- 
Still another plan would be to have at least two special or 
auxiliary teachers to deal with the retarded, to keep the 
slow-moving up to grade, and to forward capable pupils. 
The slow and retarded are relieved of some of the work of 
the course of study. The normal pupils who, for any cause, 
have fallen behind are helped up, being for a time relieved
-P-A-G-E-390
  
874 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
of some of the special work. Such rooms are sometimes 
designated as restoration rooms. For those who are to go 
ahead, instead of making a special promotion without prep- 
aration, the pupils are sent to this special room. 
The special teacher in such a room can handle two work- 
ing groups, of about ten to twelve pupils each, and she can 
handle about four such double groups a year. This will give 
about nine weeks to coach up each double group and get it 
advanced enough, in all the essential work of the grade, to 
fit it into the grade ahead. By so dividing the work of the 
teacher, and so selecting the pupils and timing their extra 
" progress, eight working groups of accelerates can be handled 
each year, and from 80 to 95 pupils can be thus coached to 
gain a half-year in their school progress. A working group 
of capables from each class from 3B to 6A could thus be 
given nine weeks of coaching each year with a view to their 
acceleration. 
Best use of such aroom. In using such a room for aiding 
retarded pupils, two policies may be followed. The first 
and the more common one, is to send to this teacher all pu- 
pils who are retarded more than a fixed amount, or all who 
are falling behind in their classwork, and then expect the 
special-room teacher to bring them up to grade. This is of- 
ten expecting the impossible, as some have not the mental 
ability to enable them to reach or to hold their age-grade 
level. (A second and a wiser policy is to apply mental tests 
to all pupils before sending them to this room, and to try to 
~ do only what is possible and best. The mental subnormals 
can thus be located, and a type of work prescribed for them 
in which they may hope to succeed. If the school system 
makes such provision it is best to group the subnormals sep- 
arately, but in many smaller school systems this is not pos- 
sible. In this case the subnormals and the normal but re- 
tarded pupils will be in the same room, and the teacher will
-P-A-G-E-391
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 3875 
be called upon to adjust her teaching so as to meet the needs 
of both groups. 
The best use of the ungraded room is that of helping pu- 
pils to keep up or to get ahead. It then becomes an oppor- 
tunity, or an adjustment room. These, too, are better 
names for the room than ungraded or special. They give 
the room and service better standing in the eyes of all the 
pupils, and tend to prevent the room becoming known 
as the “dummy room” or the “bonehead room.” Sending 
bright pupils to the room for special coaching, to enable 
them to move ahead by special promotion, does much to 
ward off such pupil terminology. 
In many cases the special teacher will be able to coach pu- 
pils so that they may hold their grades. Pupils who have 
been absent or ill, or who have entered late, may be sent to 
this room to be helped back to grade. Some may need to be 
in the room all day, for a time; others will go to the room 
only for part-time work. Pupils who are fairly intelligent 
but who need help in the use of English may also be sent to 
this room. Pupils coming from rural schools and giving 
evidence of uneven preparation, or pupils retarded by much 
moving about, may also need the services of the special 
teacher. Timid pupils, those who are discouraged, those 
lacking in ambition, and those who have not found school 
attractive sometimes do well when sent to the special. 
teacher. 
Use of asaclearing house. The special, or ungraded, or 
adjustment, or auxiliary, or opportunity room can thus be 
made of large usefulness in any school in enabling the princi- 
pal to keep more homogeneous working groups in the regular 
classrooms. Such rooms become, as it were, clearing houses, 
designed to handle all irregular cases, and thus keep the 
classroom groups more homogeneous. A large school could 
use two to three such rooms, specializing them somewhat 
   
-P-A-G-E-392
  
376 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
as to grade and type of service. If there is but one such 
~ teacher to a building, she can be most useful by working 
largely with the pupils of grades three, four, five, and six, as 
there is more need for help in these grades than in others. 
From about twelve to twenty pupils, varying somewhat with 
conditions and needs and the character of the special teacher, 
is about what may be expected. If the teacher has too ~ 
many pupils the individuality of the instruction and the ef- 
fectiveness of the service rendered are alike interfered with. 
In a few schools the ungraded room is organized on an 
eight-hour, two-section plan, with about fifteen to eighteen 
pupils each for the morning and the afternoon sections. 
The-room may have even more pupils attending the class 
before school opens in the morning, or after it closes in the 
afternoon. The enrollment, too, will vary from week to 
week as the pupils come and go, and may vary with the 
different hours of the day, depending upon what use is 
made of the room. 
Unless the room has been especially organized as a school 
for retarded or low-mentality pupils, those sent to it should 
be coached up and sent back as rapidly as can be done. The 
room should not be conducted as an asylum. To this end 
the teacher should have a good working program, with a 
proper time allotment for those fundamental subjects which 
the room is to teach. Special subjects, such as music, draw- 
ing, and gymnastics, have little place in the ungraded room. 
The best use of such a room or rooms, too, calls for spe- 
cially trained teachers who possess energy, enthusiasm, and 
personality; the use of educational and intelligence tests for 
diagnosis; special methods, such as a decrease in drill and ex- 
planation and discipline, and an emphasis on initiative and 
application and underlying principles; some special equip- 
ment; and an absence of school-grade rigidity. Such rooms, 
intelligently used, improve classroom work and school mor-
-P-A-G-E-393
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 377 
ale, strengthen weak spots, reduce retardation, help dis- 
couraged pupils to get a grip on themselves, and hold pupils 
better and longer in school. The extra cost for such work is 
more than compensated for by the advantages accruing to 
the classes from which the ill-adjusted children have been re- 
moved. _ 
Acceleration and retardation in a parallel-course school. 
When we pass from the common course of study to the par- 
allel course of study. such as is illustrated in Figure 23, page 
359, we find the adjustment of instruction to pupil easier to 
make. A glance at Figure 23, which may be taken as a type, 
will show the five natural transfer points for the two courses. 
The bright pupil can here find plenty of opportunities for ac- 
celeration, and pupils can be tried out in either course and 
easily shifted from one to the other. The special promotion 
now becomes of much less importance, and the ungraded 
room, while still of use in helping pupils to move forward, 
now finds its chief usefulness with the slow and the mentally 
subnormal. The apportionment of each year’s work into 
three divisions instead of two helps to make a non-promotion 
less serious than under a semiannual promotional plan. 
That the advantages of such a parallel course plan may be 
reaped in schools not definitely organized in this manner, by 
the formation of special working groups, the following quo- 
tation from a report made by the Superintendent of Schools 
of Montclair, New Jersey, will show: 
In September, 1912, a group of fourth-grade children of fairly 
uniform and superior ability were put in charge of a strong teacher, 
who was instructed to allow the class to advance as rapidly as it de- 
sired. No pressure was ever brought to bear upon the pupils, but 
dawdling was discouraged. The class remained with the same 
teacher for two years, and in this time did three years of work. 
Four months after the special group entered the seventh grade, care- 
ful tests were made to determine to what extent the experiment had 
been a success or a failure. A comparison of the record of the spe-
-P-A-G-E-394
  378 _ THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
cial seventh-grade pupils with those of the entire seventh grade with 
which they had been merged, and with two other seventh gradés of 
a similar type, showed a very gratifying situation. ‘Tests in spell- 
ing, arithmetic, and English were given by the principal and a stand- 
ard test in composition by the superintendent, pee the penman- 
ship was rated by the writing supervisor. 
The following facts show the results of these taut

The promotional problem in the differentiated-course 
school. When we pass still further to the differentiated 
course of study type of school, such as is shown in Figure 24, 
page 361, we find the promotional problem still easier to 
handle. Such a course of study, however, does not work out 
well in a small school, as it almost requires that a building 
have two rooms to a grade to carry it along to the best ad- 
vantage. For example, supposing two fourth-grade rooms 
containing 72 pupils, we might expect to find that they 
would be classified by tests into approximately: 
15 to 20 slow moving pupils, or 4C, 
35 to 40 average pupils, or 4B, and 
15 to 20 fast moving pupils, or 4A. 
The pupils of this fourth grade could then be assigned to the 
two teachers and rooms, as follows:

The second grouping is the better, as it makes transfers 
from group to group a little easier. 
The champions of this type of grading and promotion 
plan claim that it is far superior to progress by special pro- 
motions. Pupils, they properly contend, should be doing 4B 4B (more able half) and 4A.
-P-A-G-E-395
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 379 
work that is adapted to their ability and their rate of speed, 
and the basis for classification should be the individual differ- 
ences which tests and performance reveal. Instead of skip- 
ping a grade by an extra promotion, which leaves gaps in 
performance, the pupils are divided into three groups on the 
basis of mental and pedagogical tests, teachers’ markings, 
health and strength, and actual schoolroom performance. 
The teachers will know the A group as the accelerated or su- 
perior group; the B group as the normal or average group; 
and the C group as the slow-moving group. To the pupils 
they will be known only as A, B, and C. 
The course of study and the schoolroom procedure will 
then be adapted to the needs of each group, there virtually 
being three parallel courses. Group A will be able to take 
more abstract work, to cover a wider field, and to bring in 
much outside and supplementary material. Group B will 
not only cover average class work in the subjects of study, 
but will have the work more adapted to their interests and 
abilities. Group C will be given work at a rate best adapted 
to their needs, and a course with more emphasis on concrete 
work and practical everyday needs. Instead of imposing 
a uniform program on all, pupils will work and progress at 
rates of speed which are normal and natural for them. The 
pupil, rather than the course of study, becomes the meas- 
ure for school work. 
Special promotions and progress under this plan. From 
the diagram, Figure 24, it would be inferred that all children, 
during the first six years in school, would under this plan 
move forward at a uniform rate, that is a year to a school 
grade, the difference being in the amount of work done in 
each grade. Ordinarily this would be the case, the special 
promotions being of C pupils to a B division, and B pupils to 
an A division. Most principals, though, will find a few A 
pupils who, by reason of very superior ability, ought to go  
-P-A-G-E-396
  380 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ahead faster. If an ungraded teacher is available the prob- 
lem is relatively easy, but under the differentiated-course 
plan of grading and promotion the ungraded teacher is 
largely dispensed with. In case no such service is at hand 
the principal must then depend on home coaching, home 
study, and reciting in two grades at school, or else plain 
skipping to enable him to advance his A pupil to at least a 
B division of the grade ahead. The fact that the school, un- 
less quite large, has year grades instead of half-year grades 
makes such a transfer more difficult. It can, however, be 
done. 
A good example of the special progress of a superior group 
recently came to the writer’s notice. A principal found six 
5B and twelve 5A pupils of very superior ability in his 
school. By two intelligence tests all ranked as superior or 
gifted children. He organized them into a group by them- 
selves and called them his “Special Fives.” The group, 
working together, covered a year’s work in four months, and 
even then the work had to be enriched for them beyond that 
ordinarily given. Checking the results of their progress by 
standard educational tests revealed a class median better 
than the standard medians for the tests, or of equivalent 
classes in the school. His conclusions were that gifted 
children work better when working with pupils of their own 
type; that they work with greater profit when moving more 
rapidly than normal children; that they demand a richer 
course of study; and that they are better students and hap- 
pier when segregated into a group where all are subjected to 
competition of their own kind. 
The two. great advantages of the differentiated course of 
study plan lie in the provision of more homogeneous work- 
ing groups, and in the‘adjustment of the effort demanded to 
the capacity of the pupils. The C course of study represents 
the minimum for the slow moving pupils; the A course the
-P-A-G-E-397
  CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 381 
maximum load for the most capable children. By this type 
of segregation all three groups are benefited. The pupils 
make better progress when working with others of their own 
capacity, and they enjoy their school work more. The slow 
and timid are encouraged because they can now do the work 
and are not continually dwarfed by the competition of those 
whom they can never equal, while the capable pupils are 
worked up to capacity and in consequence largely prevented 
from developing into lazy and troublesome members of the 
school because they never have enough to do. To these 
specially capable pupils the school is under a special obliga- 
tion, and for them working to capacity in a special group is 
better than extra promotions to get them ahead where the 
work will be more difficult. The writer is convinced that 
many a bright boy who later becomes a lazy loafer and 
never achieves any large success in life, does so because 
his teachers never taught him the joy of working to capa- 
city. He loafed through school and he loafs through life. 
Combination promotional plans. The different plans so 
far described have been set forth as though they were sepa- 
rate and distinct plans, and as though a principal using one 
plan would not make use of another. Such, though, is not 
the case. Instead, it is possible to combine them some- 
what. To illustrate such combination we will take the 
school shown in Figure 6, page 96, and describe a possible 
combined grading and promotional plan for it. This school 
has a kindergarten, an ungraded room and teacher, nine 
grades, and a carrying load of 840 pupils. Grades one to 
six are organized on the grade plan, and grades seven to nine 
as a junior high school and on a departmental plan. 
Let us now assume that grades one to six follow a com- 
mon average-type course of study, with semiannual promo- 
tions, and that in the junior high school promotion is by 
subjects. Let us also suppose that the principal has power
-P-A-G-E-398
  382 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
to make minor changes in the course of study for different 
classes, to make special promotions as may seem wise, and to 
organize special retarded or accelerated groups if the best 
interests of the pupils seem to indicate this procedure as de- 
sirable. We may also assume that in each of the first two 
grades the principal may now organize three working groups, 
C, B, and A, while in grades three to six two groups would 
probably suffice. The great bulk of the pupils will make 
normal progress, and the semiannual promotions, the un- 
graded teacher and room, and the special promotions will 
provide for their needs. There will be a certain number, 
however, at both ends of the scale who will need some spe- 
cial attention. The number of each kind will vary materi- 
ally with the character of the neighborhood and the charac- 
ter of the parents who send pupils to the school. To care 
for these children some adaptation of the ungraded or the 
auxiliary room or of the differentiated-course plan may be 
introduced. i 
Adaptations for the slow and the capable. As this school 
is large, 840 pupils, there will probably be enough over-age 
and over-size and retarded pupils, by the time the sixth 
grade is reached, to organize them into special classes by 
themselves, one for boys and one for girls, putting them in 
charge of special teachers — a man, if the right type can be 
had, for the boys, and a woman for the girls. A few extra- 
large and over-age fifth-grade pupils may also be included. 
Because of their size and age these groups may be classified 
as specials, or as opportunity-room pupils, and may be 
placed with the junior high school part of the school organi- 
zation. The room teacher for each of these groups will give 
most of the academic work they will need, but they should 
be allowed to elect such studies as manual training, cooking, 
sewing, millinery, hygiene, printing, typewriting, and agri- 
culture, if they aré interested in them and can do the work,
-P-A-G-E-399
CLASSIFICATION AND PROMOTION 383 
For the special subjects — music, drawing, writing, and 
science — they may recite with any class in the building 
with which they best fit. A pupil.in one of these special 
rooms may then be doing 5A geography, 5B arithmetic, 4A 
language, 6B writing, 5B science, be excused from drawing 
except as he gets it in manual training, and be learning 
printing. Into these classes — special, adjustment, or op- 
portunity rooms — are fitted as many of the slow-moving, 
over-age pupils as can profit more from work in them than 
in the regular grade rooms, and for them the course of 
study may be widely differentiated and no more attempted 
than can be done to advantage. Nearly all such pupils will 
leave school as soon as the compulsory years are over, and 
the purpose of the school should be to do the most possible 
for them before they go out into life. 
There will also be a number of superior pupils in such a 
school who can do more than the regular work and who 
ought to be given the opportunity, but who probably ought 
not to be promoted too rapidly. By the time the fifth 
grade is reached these children may begin to do extra work, 
and after the seventh grade is reached, and promotion by 
subjects becomes the rule, these pupils can be cared for 
easily. In a few school systems the very superior pupils 
are segregated, after the sixth grade, with the consent of the 
parents, and sent to central schools where an enriched course 
of study is offered and an opportunity given them to do four 
years of work (seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades) in 
three years. Without such central schools much the same 
results may be obtained in a school organized as is the school 
under consideration. Such a school should offer an oppor- 
tunity for the superior children to study a modern language, 
do special work in music or drawing, more extensive work in 
some subject of study, or carry extra work in some of the 
manual or domestic arts.

384 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
To a casual visitor the upper grades of a school organized 
as just described may appear somewhat confused. It nat- 
urally lacks the military regularity of the old-type, lock- 
step, graded school. The pupils, in passing, seem to be 
going everywhere and to be all out of line. Each pupil, 
though, has a definite program, knows where he is going and 
what he is after, and is learning to assume responsibility. 
The capable and ambitious pupil has a chance to cut off a 
year in his school progress. The slow and backward pupil 
associates with those of his own age, and recites with those 
of his stage of advancement. By taking the over-age boys 
and girls out of the fifth and sixth grades the problem of dis- 
cipline there is simplified, and by giving them a course of in- 
struction suited to‘their capacities they are better prepared 
for life. By such flexible grading and promotional adjust- 
ments boys and girls make better school progress, are hap- 
pier in their work, and stay in school longer. The problem 
for every school principal then is to so handle the classifica- 
tion and promotion of pupils as to introduce as much flexi- 
bility as is of advantage, and to keep the needs of the pupil 
rather than the course of study in mind in doing his work. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Take the school shown in Figure 7, page 98, and the age-and-grade 
distribution of which is shown in Table VIII, page 341, and arrange a 
grade and room distribution of the classes in such a manner that the 
first two grades will be divided into three divisions or working groups 
— C, B, and A —and the remaining grades into two working groups 
— Band A. 
2. What would you try to do with such a grade as is shown in Figure 19, 
page 346? 
8. Suppose your lower grades showed some such mental-age distribution 
as is shown in Figure 22, page 353. Would an opportunity or devel- 
opment room be a useful adjunct to your school? If so, how would 
you use it? 
4. Would you make any additional rules of promotion to the two lists 
given in the text, and if so what ones? Would you eliminate any 
of those given? If so, on what grounds?

5. Suppose, in the school shown in Figure 8, page 99, the retardation 7 
*. was found to be rather heavy, as shown in your age-grade distribu- 
tion sheet, asked for in Question 12 of the preceding chapter, and on 
a showing of the facts the superintendent should give you two extra 
ungraded-room-type teachers, and two portables for your yard, with 
complete freedom to use them as you see fit. How would you use 
these teachers? 
6. Could you use a companion-class organization, as described in Chap- 
ter VIII, pages 148-50, for the school shown in Figure 5 to help you 
with your promotional problems? If so, how? 
7. How would the platoon-type of educational organization, as described 
in Chapter VIII for the schools shown in Figures 7 and 10, modify or 
help in solving promotional problems? 
8. Work out a schedule for School 7 of Table VIII, showing how you 
would use a special coaching teacher to forward eight groups of accel- 
erates each year, as described on page 374. 
9. Show how a bright pupil might do four years’ work in three in the jun- 
ior high organization, as described on page 383 of this chapter.

CHAPTER XX 
OBTAINING RESULTS FROM THE COURSES 
OF STUDY 
Types of courses of study. Practically everywhere a princi- 
pal may begin work he will find a course of study outlined 
for the guidance of himself and his teachers. Sometimes 
this course of study will have been laid down by the State, 
occasionally by the county, but most commonly by the edu- 
cational authorities of the city in which he is to work. Oc- 
casionally it will have been formulated by committees of the 
teachers themselves, but more commonly it will trace its 
origin to the superintendent’s office. 
In character the course of study will vary much in differ- 
ent places. In certain places there will be a very rigid course 
of study, with what is to be done carefully laid down and 
uniformly required of all. Sometimes this will be in terms 
of fixed assignments in fixed. textbooks, and sometimes in 
fixed directions as to what is to be done. Examinations for 
promotions may even be based on such assignments, and be 
uniform for the city. On the contrary, in places where the 
educational authorities have been blessed with a more in- 
telligent conception of the educational process, the course 
of study may be a very flexible one, with optional work 
and optional textbooks. In some places it may be a mini- 
mum course, with authority left to principal and teach- 
ers to supplement it as they deem wise; in still other places 
two or even three parallel courses may be outlined for pupil 
groups of different working capacities. 
Using the course of study as a stimulus to thinking. 
Even in school systems where the course of study is rigidly 
_ outlined, and even based on definite page assignments in
-P-A-G-E-405
  + 
THE COURSES OF STUDY 389 
definite textbooks, the principal will still find it possible to 
suggest some points for omission or emphasis, and to help 
teachers, especially new ones, to plan out the term’s work 
for their classes. The problem then is not only to try to 
modify, where possible, with a view to providing as intelli- 
gent instruction for the pupils as can be done, but also to 
inject as much stimulus to thinking as is possible for the 
teachers, despite the rigidity of the instruction. There is al- 
‘ways the greatest danger, under such a system, of the teach- 
ers becoming mechanical workers and the covering of the 
course of study becoming the end and aim of the work. 
In school systems where a more modern type of course of 
study is in force, and where options are allowed to both 
schools.and teachers, the principal will find it an important 
part of his work to help his teachers plan out their instruc- 
tion and decide what and how much it is best to do. Since 
different groups will be traveling at different rates, and 
covering different amounts as they travel, the adjustment 
of the course of study to group needs will be one of the 
major problems of supervision in such a school. The prin- 
cipal now has an opportunity to use organization and adap- 
tation of the course of study to group needs as one means 
of keeping his teachers thinking and growing, and he will 
in general do this best by giving them much liberty in 
making decisions rather than by taking it all upon himself. 
Mapping out the instruction. In every school grade, and 
with every properly organized working group of pupils, 
there will be certain minimal work to be done, certain work 
that may be gone over very rapidly, and certain major 
points to be emphasized. There are also certain things that 
should be stressed for capable groups, and which may be 
minimized or omitted for other groups. The work of the 
grade or term, too, will have certain large objectives which 
should be reached. All of this should be set forth in relief to
-P-A-G-E-406
390 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the teachers, that they may see their work as.a whole and 
in its relationships, and in consequence be better able to or- 
ganize their work for the grade or term into its parts or de- 
tails. In many smaller city school systems this is done by 
the superintendent of schools, through his grade meetings, 
and if well done this is the most effective means. The 
larger objectives which each grade is to attempt may also 
well be set forth by the superintendent to the principals, at 
his principals’ conference. If the superintendent assumes 
this function and gives his suggestions in a liberal spirit, it 
is of the greatest help to the principal in what he should 
later do. If the superintendent does not do this, then the 
principal should assume the work and incorporate it as a 
phase of his classroom supervision and service. In any case, 
je should reinforce and supplement whatever the superin- 
tendent may do, as it relates to his particular school, so that 
the minimal work and the larger objectives for the differ- 
ent grades may be clearly in mind. He probably will 
want to set up additional objectives for his own particular 
school. 
Once these larger objectives for a term’s work of a grade 
are in mind, the next thing for principal and teachers will he 
to lay out roughly into parts the work to be done, and then 
so to plan and space these requirements that the work may 
proceed rather evenly from week to week and from month to 
month. The older and more skillful teachers will need little 
help, and, if the principal finds them efficient, they may 
safely be entrusted with the organization of their own work. 
The younger and inexperienced teachers, though, should re- 
ceive whatever help they may seem to need. With begin- 
ners, assistance in planning from week to week, with sug- 
gestions even from day to day, may at first be needed, until 
they grasp the idea of planning and attain some skill at it. 
Good organization of work and specific planning of what is
-P-A-G-E-407
THE COURSES OF STUDY 301 
to be done, and when, make for definite progress, eliminate 
waste, and promote thoroughness on the part of the pupils, 
but all this requires thinking the work through on the part 
of the teacher. 
Distinctions as to major and minor aims should be clear, 
and as much liberty in the selection of materials and methods 
as can be used should be left to the teachers themselves. 
Where not prohibited from above, variations between 
classes and in different terms should be encouraged, and the 
major aim may be shifted from year to year or from time to 
time within the year. While carrying out the main thought 
of the course of study, it is well to allow variations and con- 
tributions from both teachers and pupils. The principal, 
too, should make his contribution. Both pupils and teach- 
ers are helped if they can exercise some choice in what they 
do. \ 
Use and abuse of lesson plans. In mapping out the work 
to be done, some form of outline or lesson plan often is re- 
quired, though lesson plans are not used to-day as much as 
they were twenty yearsago. The idea has certain good uses, 
but some principals and superintendents carry it so far that 
it becomes a handicap rather than a help, and tends to de- 
velop and perpetuate mechanical work instead of serving the 
larger purpose of improving the instruction of the teacher. 
Some principals proceed on the theory that teachers gener- 
ally do not know what they are trying to do, and to correct 
this require lesson plans for each week, and sometimes for 
each day, to be handed in at the office in advance. To such 
lesson planning serious objections are advanced, which may 
be summarized about as follows: 
Seldom, it is argued, are such plans examined, and the 
time put on their preparation would better be put on other 
types of work. The principal or superintendent does not 
need them to tell what is being done when they visit the
-P-A-G-E-408
392 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
school, or to check up what is done when they do not. Pub- 
lic school teachers are seldom in the practice-teacher stage, 
and should seldom be required to follow practice-teacher 
methods and plans. The time spent in preparing detailed 
plans for the principal’s desk would usually be better spent 
in reading, working with pupils, getting acquainted with par- 
ents and children, resting, playing, or sleeping. Ifa teacher 
possesses so little interest and enthusiasm in her work that a 
submitted lesson plan is the only assurance a principal can 
have that any thought has been given to the work of the 
day, then the sooner such teacher is eliminated from the 
school the better it will be. 
On the other hand, some supervisors contend that the les- 
son plan has its use, but a use chiefly to the teacher who 
makes it. It represents, its advocates contend, evidence of 
some thinking as to what is to be done, some picking out of 
important points for emphasis, and some unit-planning of 
work to be accomplished. It aids the teacher in seeing her 
task for a week or a day as a whole, tends to secure better 
correlations, eliminates overlapping, usually insures a better 
organization of the instruction, aids in assigning new work, 
and is very useful to a substitute teacher if the regular 
teacher is forced to be absent. Used in this manner, a brief 
outline of the main points to be attempted for each week be- 
comes a means to’an end, viz., good instruction, and not an 
» end in itself, viz., the plan. 
How far such planning should go, and to what detail, will 
ordinarily vary much with the training and experience and 
skill of the individual teachers. Some teachers scarcely 
need to make any plan on paper for their own use, others 
only a brief page outline, while still others may need, for a 
time, to make rather full plans for what they are todo. So 
greatly do needs vary that lesson-planning is a poor subject 
for a principal to manage by uniform rules unless he knows

clearly what he is about, and wants to use the plans in his 
visitation and supervision. 
Used for this purpose the lesson plan can be made of dis- 
tinct use to the school principal, especially in a large school. 
In one, of the writer’s acquaintance, where the principal 
spends a large percentage of his time in classroom supervi- 
sion and plans this supervision carefully, the teachers are. 
required to send to his office each evening or early each 
morning a penciled-in card-form plan-of-work for the day. 
Printed cards are supplied, of which the form given on page 
893 is an example. Such a form is simple and easily pre- 
pared, leads to definiteness in planning the instruction, and 
is of use to the principal in arranging any visitation or 
special inspection he may desire to make. 
Assistance to teachers. It is wise for a new principal. 
until his classroom supervision confirms the contrary, to 
take certain things for granted. He may with safety as- 
sume that his more experienced teachers have a good gen- 
eral grasp of the subject-matter to be taught, and will fill in 
the details from day to day as they are needed. He may 
also assume that they do some planning of their work, have 
fairly good methods which will bring fair results with the 
children, and have in mind certain definite aims toward 
which they work and which are in harmony with the proper 
progress of instruction and the larger objectives of the 
course of study and the school. Survey may show him that 
these assumptions are not valid, but they are good safe first 
‘assumptions. If some form of lesson planning seems neces- 
sary, it can be introduced later on. 
This does not mean, though, that the young, the inexpe- 
rienced, the weak, or even the strong and capable teachers 
need make no preparation for their work from day to day. 
- The beginners, and some of the younger or weaker teach- 
ers, may need help almost on the practice-teacher level. In-  
-P-A-G-E-411
  THE COURSES OF STUDY 395 
stead of making a uniform rule for all the principal should 
give such teachers individual help, having them plan out 
parts of their work for his approval. He should find their 
weak points and seek to strengthen them. He should dis- 
cuss their plans with them, and in the room supervision 
show them how to develop better working plans. He must 
point out to them that they must know and evaluate the sub- 
ject-matter they are trying to teach; that they must organ- 
ize their. day’s work around the problems they want the - 
children to solve; that they must think out a half-dozen piv- 
otal questions to enable them to start the recitation well, 
and hold the discussion to the main issue; that they must 
make provision for summaries as they proceed; that they 
must have their future assignments clearly in mind, and 
make them very definite; and that they must use enough 
but not too much supplemental and illustrative material to 
keep the recitation going well. He must teach them to an- 
alyze and check up their work from day to day, in order to 
evaluate the strong and the weak points in what they do. 
Occasionally, instead of the principal taking the whole bur- 
den on himself, he can do a double service by asking some 
older, “know-it-all,” and not-particularly-successful type of 
teacher to help in doing this service for some younger one — 
“out of the fullness of her experience” — and then sit back 
and watch them both. 
Plans a means to an end. ‘Teachers, new and inexperi- 
enced, or those who have never become accustomed to such 
planning of their work, can be materially helped in their pra- 
fession by some training along this line. Effective and eco- 
nomical teaching demands just such preparatory thinking, 
whether or not it be reduced to writing. _ Written plans are 
most useful to new and inexperienced teachers, as well as to 
old teachers beginning to be seriously afflicted with “peda- 
gogical cramp.” It is necessary for them to think out their
-P-A-G-E-412
396 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
work more clearly, and to keep a better sense of proportion 
in what they do. Requiring written lesson plans from good 
and able teachers, on the contrary, is a waste of time and 
energy that ought to go to the children. Still more, an in- 
sistence on their preparation diverts the teacher’s atten- 
tion from the work to the plan, tends to set up the false 
standard of satisfying the supervisor, develops unnecessary 
routine work, and ultimately tends to produce lifeless teach- 
ing and teachers. The best lesson plans for able teachers 
are mental ones, because they involve the least expenditure 
of time and energy. 
It is the principal’s duty to so shape his supervision of in- 
struction that every teacher will, of necessity, have to think 
out her work and organize some form of mental or written 
plan for it. How frequently he will discuss these plans with 
any teacher will be determined largely by the need for help 
of the teacher concerned. It is also the duty of the principal 
to so shape his interpretation of the course of study and the 
instructional work of the school that only the best lesson 
plans will be possible, and that only sound pedagogical prin- 
ciples will be employed in formulating these plans and in 
conducting the lessons themselves. If, in addition, the 
principal himself personifies the qualities which good lesson 
plans are supposed to cultivate, if he has good working hab- 
its and works to a purpose, if he can do constructive think- 
ing, and if he studies the teaching problems of his teachers as 
well as he expects them to study them, it will go a long way 
in securing the qualities he desires his teachers to exhibit in 
their classroom work. 
The course of study not an end initself. In all discussion 
of instruction, lesson plans, and of work to be covered, 
both the principal and the teachers should keep clearly 
before them the important idea that any course of study 
is after all only a means to an end, and not an end in itself.
-P-A-G-E-413
  THE COURSES OF STUDY 397 
The purpose of all school instruction is the best possible de- 
velopment of the pupil taught, rather than the acquisition 
of subject-matter. After all, there is nothing especially 
sacred about the subject-matter of a course of study. If 
pupils are trained to think and work for themselves, and 
to stand on their own feet, the prime purpose of all instruc- 
tion will have been accomplished. 
No course of study, no matter how scientifically it has 
been worked out and mapped out, can accomplish its pur- 
pose in the education of youth without constant adaptations 
to the needs of the children taught. All our study of work- 
ing groups has shown this clearly. New teachers need much 
help here in order to catch the vision of what modern educa- 
tion should attempt to do for young people. Because it is 
so much easier to have pupils memorize and recite from 
fixed material than it is to train them to think and work in- 
dependently, new teachers require special attention and su- 
pervision to start them right. A principal who shapes the 
administration of the course of study in his school to this 
end, and who makes of it an important part of his school su- 
pervision, will find it one of the most helpful means at hand 
for developing and keeping a proper professional attitude 
on the part of his teachers. 
Getting results by drives. While the great purpose of 
education is to train pupils to work independently and to 
think for themselves, there are still certain abilities and cer- 
tain fact materials that must be mastered. Many studies 
along these lines have revealed the importance of concen- 
trated study and work, for short periods, in such mastery. 
To this end the school grades will need, from time to time, 
to set up certain major objectives for short-period “drives,” 
with the idea of concentrating attention on the rapid mas- 
tery of some skill or some set body of facts. Sometimes a 
selected group may make a drive to do a piece of work well
-P-A-G-E-414
  
398 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
in a brief period, as, for example, a term’s work in arithme- 
tic or language in half the regular time. The same principle 
will apply to review work, to which many courses of study 
seem to devote an unjustifiable amount of scattered time. 
Intensive. one-week term reviews may be used to replace the 
term examination, the emphasis in the review work being 
placed on rapid, intensive work, with enough competitive 
work within the class to keep interest keen. 
These “drives” will, for atime, become the major objec- 
tives of the group. Sometimes a term or even a year may 
be devoted to such objectives as improvement in English 
usage, better writing and spelling, new science work, or 
studies in civics. On the other hand, much valuable work 
can be accomplished by short, intensive efforts to fix some 
particular thing. 
Types of such short-period drives would be: 
1. For the school as a whole. 
a. Bringing up the health score. 
b. Best attendance for the month. 
ce. Cleaner yard and building. 
2. Special grade drives. 
a. Improving arithmetic scores. 
b. Improving writing scores. 
c. Elimination of composition errors. 
d. Elimination of common spelling errors. 
Teachers should be encouraged to organize such cam- 
paigns from time to time, but the principal should give care- 
ful oversight to what is attempted. Most of the minor and 
short-period classroom drives can be left to the discretion of 
the teacher concerned; the major school drives should be de- 
cided upon by the teachers as a group. When once inaugu- 
rated, every such drive should be made to seem of much im- 
portance; the purpose of it should be clearly set forth; in- 
tensive work should be done; the results of the drive should 
be measured and graphically shown to both pupils and teach-
-P-A-G-E-415
THE COURSES OF STUDY 399 
ers; and the principal should show himself deeply mterested 
in what is to be done and in the results obtained. Much 
of the value of any such drive lies in the enthusiasm it 
awakens and the pride of accomplishment that comes from 
success. All this tends to develop a school spirit that is 
worth much in many ways. 
The question of home study by pupils. One of the impor- 
tant questions every principal will have to face, in the ad- 
ministration of the course of study in his school, will be what 
attitude the school will take toward the question of home 
study by the pupils. This is sometimes a burning question 
in a school, oreven inacity. If an unreasonable amount of 
home work has been assigned by teachers it sometimes leads 
to a reaction that goes to the extreme of forbidding all home 
assignments. Just what position a school may assume will 
depend a little on circumstances, though there is a moderate 
and a median position that the school should take if it can. 
A question that may be asked of a new principal, at his 
first meeting with his teachers, is, “ Are you, or are you not, 
going to require home study?” As this is a very important 
question the new principal may very well reply that since it 
is so important, and since the right answer depends so much 
on conditions and attitudes, he would like to think the prob- 
lem over before answering definitely. He may, on the other 
hand, inquire what has been the practice of the school in the 
past, and, if there seems to be no serious objection, the 
school may continue as before until there seems to be need 
for change. The subject, thougli, is one of much impor- 
tance and should receive the most careful attention. Pupil 
progress in school, good teaching, and satisfactory relations 
with the home all in large part depend upon how the ques- 
tion of home study by pupils is handled by the principal and 
his teachers. 
The home and home study. While a few of the better
-P-A-G-E-416
  400 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
middle-class homes like to have the pupils have some home 
assignments, the great majority of homes object to it. In 
many schools the most serious cause of friction between 
parents and school, and the basis of most of the criticism of 
the school, is this matter of home study by the children. In 
most homes there is no quiet place where the children may 
prepare their lessons; the children often do not know how to 
work alone, and bother their parents to help them; and to 
get the children to bed in time the parents often do their 
sums or write their sentences for them. The children in 
consequence develop poor habits of work, and are marked 
low by the teachers if they fail to get all that is assigned 
them. The tendency, too, of the poor teacher is to increase 
the home assignments if recitations are unsatisfactory. 
This only increases the dislike of the pupils for school and 
augments the friction between the parents and the teacher. 
In schools where teachers assign tasks, hear recitations, 
mark grades, and send the children home at night with book 
assignments for the morrow, there is not likely to be any 
large number of satisfied children or parents. Such work 
denotes both poor teaching and poor school supervision, and 
a defense of such instruction is the refuge of poor teachers 
and poor principals everywhere. In ignorant families with — 
bad home conditions little is accomplished; in better homes 
the parents turn teacher, do much of the work, and get the 
child off to bed. The general result is to make the children 
nervous and anxious, destroy their sense of honor, fill them 
with undigested information, prevent the development of 
their thinking power and good working habits, make them 
superficial, and arouse a sense of injustice in both ‘parents 
and children. The parents rightly feel that the teacher 
should teach, rather than hear the recitations the home pre- 
pares. t 
What is good teaching? This attitude on the part of in-
-P-A-G-E-417
THE COURSES OF STUDY 401 
telligent parents raises a fundamental question as to what, 
after all, is the purpose of the school. If the course of study 
is a fixed thing, if certain facts have to be learned and cer- 
tain pages of textbooks covered, if term examinations are 
made out at the central office and are uniform for all, and if 
principals and teachers have little or no option to vary the 
instruction, then such antagonism between home and school 
as has just been described may be expected, and little that 
the school can do will diminish it because the emphasis in 
education is put at the wrong place. 
The real purpose in education, aside from the learning of 
a few facts and the mastery of certain abilities that are 
found to be of use in later life, is to train young people how 
to analyze a problem and find out things for themselves; to 
form in them good working habits; to show them how to 
concentrate attention and to study effectively and inde- 
pendently; to teach them how to gather facts and marshal 
them to form a conclusion; and to awaken in them motives 
for work beyond what the school requires. That many 
teachers and schools fail to grasp such a conception of their 
work, and that many pupils get a wrong idea of what “to 
study” means, is common knowledge. Yet probably the 
most important element in good teaching is the develop- 
ment of good habits of study and the ability to do independ- 
ent thinking. The beginnings of the formation of such 
study habits go down as low as the third grade. 
It is in these important respects that home study for 
younger pupils fails most completely. Even under the most 
favorable conditions there is loss of time and working effec- 
tiveness, while in the poorer homes the neglect of prepara- 
tion and the bad working habits developed are a distinct 
loss to the children concerned. Home study, as usually 
carried on, is destructive of the good habits of work the mod- 
ern school should be laboring to establish, and tends to train 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
402 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
young people to dilly-dally, waste time and energy, and in 
the end to dishonesty by their getting some one else to do 
their work for them. 
New work for the school principal. It is the growing real- 
ization on the part of the school of these defects that has 
caused many schools to abandon all home-study assign- 
ments for pupils below the fifth grade, and often below the 
seventh, and to turn instead to teaching pupils to do effec- 
tive studying in the school. This almost at once demands 
new attention to the teaching process, because the key to 
good teaching is found in the training given pupils as to how 
to study. Conversely, improper study habits on the part of 
pupils is an evidence of poor teaching and of poor study as- 
signments on the part of the teacher. This in turn calls for 
new attention to the supervision of instruction on the part 
of the principal, for he will often find it necessary to show 
his teachers how to train their pupils to do effective study- 
ing. To this end he must himself be fairly well informed on 
the psychology of the learning process, as it relates to the 
different ages and the different subjects of study. He must 
also be able, in his classroom visitation, quickly to evaluate 
the instruction given by his teachers in its relation to pupil 
study. He must be able to explain in simple terms the prin- 
ciples underlying good study, and teaching pupils how to 
study, as these bear on programs, recitation work, and course 
of study assignments, and be capable of demonstrating what 
he means by at times taking the class from the teacher and 
showing her how. y 
He will naturally need to give more help and encourage- 
ment to some teachers than to others. To some it will mean 
a complete change of point of view. ‘Those who talk too 
much will need to be shown how to question instead; those 
who waste time will need to learn how to work more e¢onom- 
ically; those weak in assignment will need to be shown how
-P-A-G-E-419
  THE COURSES OF STUDY 408 
to organize their work better; those who make the recita- 
tion chiefly an exercise of memory will need to have revealed 
to them better aims and ends; those who use the textbook 
as a source of knowledge and an end in itself will need to be 
shown how to use books as tools. He may need to explain 
to his teachers the ways children can and do study, and to 
emphasize the importance of planning work and assign- 
ments so as to motivate what is to be done. A good insight 
into the problem to be dealt with, the ability to give helpful 
suggestions and encouragement, and above all the capability 
of actually demonstrating what he wants done by doing it 
with a class, will carry a principal along far in the training 
of his teachers to develop effective habits of study on the 
part of their pupils. 
Organizing a school for directed study. Scarcely any- 
where will a new principal find it to have been the practice 
to give home work to children below the fourth grade, 
though in a few places third-grade assignments may obtain. 
After the fourth grade home assignments usually increase 
gradually up to the high school age. 
Let us suppose that a principal, after taking charge of a 
school, considers the matter with his teachers and that they 
decide to change to a school-study plan, with little or no 
home study before the seventh grade. There will, of course, 
have to be certain exceptions. Children may with advan- 
tage take home books for reading. A pupil interested in a 
problem may take it home for further inquiry or study. A 
perfectly well child who is slow and plodding, needing a little 
extra work to fix some point, may be given some definite 
home assignment. A well child, who is trying to gain pro- 
motion, may systematically take home assignments of ex- 
tra work, as may a well child who is getting behind. Paren- 
tal help in such cases may be enlisted, and be quite benefi- 
cial. 
   
-P-A-G-E-420
404 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
The first difficulty in inaugurating the new plan will be 
encountered in the school program, as the ordinary grade 
program, with two grades to a room, is adjusted to reciting 
rather than to studying. With but one class or section or 
grade to a room the matter is easy, but this is seldom the 
case. One plan, commonly followed, is that of rearranging 
the program of all grades from 3B upward, so that approx- 
imately forty minutes will be allowed for each directed- 
study subject. In the junior high school grades the time 
may be extended to forty-five or fifty minutes. Approxi- 
mately one half the time is then given to recitation work, 
and the other half, directly following, to directed study, 
the teacher helping the pupils to make the transition and get 
to work. 
With two sections or grades in a room there will, under 
such a plan, be but little time during which the teacher can 
give the pupils actual help in learning how to study. In 
such a case, and this is very common, it will be necessary to 
try one or more of a number of expedients. One is to reduce 
the time of the recitation somewhat and use the time thus 
saved for directions as to what is to be done for the morrow, 
and how to doit. This shifts the emphasis from reciting to 
working, and the teacher will often need training in how to 
handle codperative group activity, where finding out some- 
thing instead of telling is the purpose. Sometimes a whole 
recitation period may be given over to directed study. Prob- 
lems in arithmetic, campaigns in history, map study in 
geography, and language study are types of work in which 
purposeful directed study may well replace reciting. 
Another plan is to concentrate the saved time and use it 
for a directed-study period in the morning and another in 
the afternoon. Another is to organize an optional after- 
school period for helping those most in need of special serv- 
ice. Another is the adoption of some form of the Batavia
-P-A-G-E-421
THE COURSES OF STUDY 405 
plan, under which two teachers work in a room, one doing 
the drill and recitation work and the other the pupil-study 
direction. This plan, though, is not possible in the school of 
ordinary size, except as some special or ungraded teacher 
may give assistance. Under the platoon type of school or- 
ganization directed study is easier to arrange for than under 
the grade-system plan. The best plan, but the one least 
possible of realization in most places at present, would be 
to lengthen the school day, have the studying all done in 
school, and compensate for it by freeing the pupils from all 
home work. If a six-hour school day could be provided, all 
needed study below the seventh or.eighth grade, aside from 
reading assignments, could :be done in school, under close 
supervision and with a maximum of effectiveness. This is 
one of the strong features of the Gary plan. A study of the 
school programs given in Chapter IX will show how little 
time can be saved by any of these expedients under the five- 
hour school day. : 
Redirecting the instruction. In making the transition 
from a home-study type of organization to a school-study 
plan it will be found that most of the pupils do not know 
how to study to advantage a lesson assigned. The same 
wasteful, wandering, dilly-dallying methods developed in 
the home work show in the school, and if the home work is 
cut off the pupils fail to get the assignments and.the whole 
grade at first falls behind. Probably not over ten per cent 
of our teachers, on the average, have ever taken any special 
time or pains to show young people how to study, unless re- 
quired to do so. Our teachers have not been trained to such 
service, and they think that the simple direction to “study” 
a certain assignment is all that is necessary to bring about 
intelligent and efficient work on the part of the pupils. If 
the pupils waste time and do not get their lessons in school, 
they have to get them in some way at home, or fail of pro-
-P-A-G-E-422
406 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
motion; the business of the teacher has been to see that they 
get them, not to help them get them. 
The work of the principal now will be to try to focus the 
interest of his teachers in this new direction, and to build 
them up in the art of assigning work and showing pupils how 
to study. This will be much easier of accomplishment if the 
teachers themselves can be brought to see the need of such 
improvement, rather than having it forced on them by the 
principal. If some book that contains helpful material, 
such as McMurry, or Wilson, or some good magazine article 
on the subject, such as the ones by Hall-Quest, Merriam, or 
Holzinger, could be studied before the plan is tried it would 
be a decided advantage. Directed school study, too, would 
best be introduced gradually, that teachers may master its 
technique. Sometimes it is better to introduce the tech- 
nique without saying much about the subject or plan itself, 
and gradually accustom the teachers to it and to a reduction 
and redirection of home assignments before any serious con- 
sideration of the plan in its entirety is undertaken. 
The teacher’s part in the work. The teachers must, in 
one way or another, be led to see that if the children are to 
prepare their lessons well they must be made to seem of im- 
portance to them, and that, to this end, the teacher must 
organize her own work effectively and make her assignments 
clear-cut and definite. She must have command of the 
needed facts, see what type of treatment the lesson calls for, 
see whether the problem is apparent or not and whether or 
not it calls for supplementary material, think out how best 
to attack the work and the steps in its solution, and then 
show the pupils just how to work, what to look for, and 
what to do. As in all good recitation work, there must be 
a specific purpose to the work assigned. Pupils, too, need 
training in how to use an index, a dictionary, a map, an en- 
cyclopedia, and a text, and how to judge values and form  
-P-A-G-E-423
  THE COURSES OF STUDY 407 
conclusions. The importance of directness, concentration, 
speed, and accuracy need to be brought before the pupils. 
Occasional talks on how to analyze a topic, get the thought 
of a lesson, run down a problem, or study a lesson in reading 
or geography or history or spelling may well be given the 
classes by principal or teacher. There is much representing 
the accumulated experience of adults that can be set before 
children to enable them to work more intelligently and 
effectively. Often the ideas and plans of the pupils, after 
they come to know how to work, can be used, and it is well 
to encourage them to help and suggest. 
The teacher, too, must learn how to work intelligently at 
training pupils to study. She must direct and show: the 
way, but not do too much herself. She should strive to 
give them the technique of proper studying, remove mis- 
understandings, and stimulate codperative effort, but not 
do their work for them except when she wants to show 
them how to do some particular type of work. The study 
period must not be transformed into another recitation pe- 
riod, nor should the teacher use it as a time to do work her- 
self while the pupils work. At times she will need to work 
with or show the whole working group or grade what and 
how to do, actually using texts, references, and going 
through the working processes with them; at times she will 
deal with smaller sub-groups; at still other times she will 
pass rapidly from individual to individual, overseeing what 
is being done. 
Where directed study is needed. The elementary school 
studies in which special attention as to how to study them 
should be given are arithmetic, geography, history, language 
work, reading, and spelling. The drill subjects — drawing, 
music, penmanship, and physical training — and the work 
in science and the domestic and manual arts will not, on the 
other hand, call for such training. The study of those sub-
-P-A-G-E-424

jects which involve the formation of specific habits should 
be handled in school, while home assignments should be 
supplemental, review in type, or interesting and easily done. 
Spelling, for example, involves the formation of certain im- 
portant habits, such as looking carefully at the word, seeing 
its parts, selecting out the special part for attention, visualiz- 
ing it, pronouncing its syllables, noting similarities and con- 
trasts with other words, etc. This is important habit for- 
mation, and the classroom is its place and the teacher its 
director. Review work in spelling is different, and may be 
done at home. Similarly, reading drill is school work; read- 
ing for pleasure or information is quite different. Language 
work and sums in arithmetic should be done in school and 
not at home, except in such cases as were previously noted. 
Where home work, on the contrary, means reading a story 
or a geographical reader for pleasure, the following out from 
vital interest of some problem in science or history or geog- 
raphy or industry that has arisen in the school, or some 
experiment carried home, quite a different situation exists. 
Then home work is indicative of instruction that has chal- 
lenged the pupils and awakened their interest, instead of be- 
ing the refuge of a weak teacher who is either not skillful 
enough or too lazy to do effective teaching during school 
hours, and tries to conceal her inefficiency by home assign- 
ments and parent assistance to bring the pupils along. 
In the junior high school grades it is well that the pupils 
should begin to learn how to do some effective home study. 
The work here is a little more difficult, and additional sub- 
jects come in which necessitate longer time for preparation 
than the school hours can provide. It is now that the value 
of the earlier training in how to study reveals itself, and now 
that supplemental instruction as to how to work alone is 
needed. The conditions for study — quiet, good light, a 
table where books and papers may be placed and kept, and a
-P-A-G-E-425
  THE COURSES OF STUDY 409 
definite time for concentrated effort — need to be explained, 
that the pupils may begin early to develop the ways and 
habits of students. If the homes of the neighborhood do 
not provide such facilities, as many naturally do not, then a 
talk on the duty of providing them might be a good subject 
for a Parent-Teacher meeting. 
What directed study may add. Directed school study, 
like the motivation of school work, project work, or special 
drives, is only a means to an end, and is not a panacea for all 
the difficulties a school encounters in its efforts to train 
young people to do what the race, after all, has done for but 
a very short period of its history. It is only one of many 
means that may be used to make easier what is no easy task, 
but it is one of the best of supplemental means because it 
heads the educational process in the right direction, tends to 
decrease the criticism of the school by the home, and is a sim- 
ple but effective method of improving the teaching process: 
For that reason it has been selected for rather detailed ex- 
planation here. 
Directed school study, too, offers both teachers and prin- 
cipal a reliable means for measuring the efficiency of the in- 
struction after, of course, first evaluating the character of 
the working group the teacher has to deal with. The effec- 
tiveness of the teacher’s analysis of difficulties and assign- 
ment of study-problems will appear in the recitations, and 
in the relative degree of progress which the class makes with- 
out home help. That teacher who finds her pupils growing 
in ability to do independent study, and their need for special 
help decreasing constantly, is well on the way toward be- 
coming a successful teacher. The training of pupils in 
proper life habits, and the developing in them of independ- 
ent power for effective work, is perhaps the highest evidence 
of teaching skill and probably the best thing a teacher ever 
does for boys and girls.

410. THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
In the development of this type of instruction the princi- 
pal plays an important part. It is one of his greatest 
opportunities for constructive work with his teachers. 
Whether or not his school takes up directed school study 
as a major idea, he should try, in his classroom supervision, 
to give to his teachers the best of its technique, in so far as it 
relates to assignment of work and training pupils for intel- 
ligent and independent study. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1, Suppose, in taking charge of a new school, you find a Minimum-Essen- 
tials course of study, with options to schools to supplement this for 
working groups as may seem best. What part would you have (a) the 
principal, and (b) the classroom teachers, take in the selection of the 
supplemental work? Why? 
2. Suppose, on the contrary, you find a fixed course of study, fixed text- 
books and page assignments, promotional examinations based on uni- 
form questions for the city, and central supervision that is essentially 
inspection. What could or would you do, assuming that you remain’ 
in the system as a principal? 
8. Suppose the rules and regulations of the school board require that “all 
teachers in teaching history, geography, and science must prepare an 
outline for each day’s instruction, and do their teaching from the out- 
line and not from the textbook.” What good uses could you make of 
such a rule, and how would you mitigate its severity? 
4, Assume that a new principal takes it for granted that his experienced 
teachers have good teaching technique and properly plan their work, 
and that his classroom supervision shows him the contrary to be the 
case with a few of the older teachers. How should he proceed to im- 
prove conditions? 
5. Assume that, instead of a simple grade school, the principal is the su- 
pervising principal of a group of schools, such as is shown in Figure 3, 
page 12, Show’‘how he could plan for grade meetings of the teachers 
of the different schools so as to provide small working groups for dis- 
cussion of the course-of-study aims and objectives. 
6. What is your judgment as to lesson-planning, after reading the argu- 
ments pro and con? 
7. Make a topical outline for a talk to a Parent-Teacher meeting on the 
home work and home study surroundings of children, to show what 
points you would emphasize. 
8, Would it be safe to say that the amount and nature of the home study 
assignments of a school would form a rough measure of the efficiency 
of the instruction and supervision of it?
-P-A-G-E-427
THE COURSES OF STUDY 411 
9. Suppose, in adopting a school-study plan of work, it was found neces- 
sary to organize a special help hour for a time, after school, for those 
most needing assistance in learning how to do their work. How would 
you plan it (a) supposing all teachers were willing to remain a short 
time, and (b) supposing one or more ungraded teachers were paid to 
remain? 
10. Dr. T. D. Wood, in his Health in Education, in the Ninth Yearbook of 
* the National Society for the Study of Education, Part I, gives the follow- 
ing table (page 54) as to the sleep of school children:

What does this table indicate as to home study time, by grades? Ter- 
man and Hocking, in their study of the sleep of school children, found 
that children sleep Jess than the above amounts, Compare their 
studies, reported in Terman’s Hygiene of the School Child, chap. xx. 
11. Some schools find, after directed school study has been put into opera- 
tion, that the children have more free time than they can well use. 
Some schools keep the playground open until six o’clock, with a teacher 
in charge. Others have made a schedule of home work, after the plan 
outlined in Alderman, and have required one school credit in home- 
work activities each term. Outline such a plan for home-credit activ- 
ities, and state how you would administer it. What do you think of 
the value of such work?

CHAPTER XXI 
THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 
Types of special teachers. A phase of the work of the prin- 
cipal in the supervision of instruction which may possibly 
cause him much trouble relates to the work of the special su- 
pervisors and teachers who come to his building, either as 
specialists to oversee and direct the work of his own teach- 
ers, or to do special work themselves. 
Different cities will provide different plans for such spe- 
cial supervision and instruction. In one city the principal 
may find a visiting primary supervisor, who will oversee the 
work in the first three grades, or possibly the first four; 
a grammar-grades’ supervisor, who will cover the second 
four; and sometimes an intermediate-grades’ supervisor for 
grades four to six, with the primary and grammar-grades’ 
supervision then restricted to the thtee grades below and 
above respectively. 
In other cities these supervisors may be lacking, and in 
their place will be a number of special traveling supervisors, 
distributed by subjects, as music, drawing, penmanship, 
science, domestic arts, manual arts, physical education, or 
foreign languages. The traveling school nurse, dentist, and 
medical inspector in part come in under this classification. 
Sometimes two or more of these will be combined with the 
primary and grammar-grade supervisors mentioned above. 
There will also be teachers of special subjects who belong 
to the building, or who divide their time between one or 
two adjacent buildings, such as the ungraded-room teacher, 
special coaching teachers, playground teachers, the visiting 
nurse or visiting teacher, and teachers of cooking, sewing, or 
manual training. These latter have special rooms in which  
-P-A-G-E-431

to work, do special work at stated program periods, and are 
more directly under the principal while at the school than 
are the so-called special supervisors. 
The primary- or grammar-grades’ supervisor. This 
type of special supervisor is usually a very helpful person. 
Interested in the development and progress of the pupils in 
all their subjects, and provided primarily to promote the 
welfare of the parts of the school system they oversee by 
giving to the school work a close and professional type of su- 
pervision which principals seldom find time to give, and fre- 
quently are not capable of giving, the visits of this type of 
supervisor can usually be looked forward to as days of pro- 
fessional help for both teachers and principal. Even should 
these supervisors not be persons of large knowledge nor pos- 
sess distinct qualities of leadership, the principal, by dealing 
with them much as he must the more special supervisors, 
may secure considerable help from them despite any per- 
sonal limitations that may be in evidence. 
This type of special supervisor comes with something of 
the authority of the superintendent of schools himself, in 
that he or she usually represents and speaks for the superin- 
tendent in the interpretation of the purpose and intent of 
the course of study as it is carried into effect in the schools. 
They represent a form of specialized assistant to the super- 
intendent, doing little except the supervision of classroom 
instruction in certain grades of the school system. Usually 
persons of good training and personality and experience, 
and visiting different schools from day:to day, they are in 
better position than the principal to compare and evaluate 
the work being done in his building. 
By helpful suggestions, outlines for supplementary work, 
organization of new teaching material, and personal confer- 
ences with the teachers, this type of special supervisor is one 
who may be of much assistance to the principal in solving his
-P-A-G-E-432
Me a ee 
416 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
‘peculiar instructional problems, and from whom he may 
learn much of value. Able to take classroom work as they 
find it, calling for no special program or rearrangement of 
work when they visit, and possessed of a better understand- 
ing of the meaning of administrative organization and rela- 
tionships than the usual supervisor of the so-called special 
subjects, this type of supervisor is a real help when visit- 
ing a school. Instead of leaving to them the work of the 
grades, as some principals do, he should follow them about 
and discuss the work done with them, that he may become 
as skillful at classroom supervision as they may be. If he 
can exceed them in supervisory skill, as he might well do, 
knowing his teachers and pupils better, so much to the good, 
The following outline for work, by a primary supervisor 
in a city of 45,000 people, will illustrate the nature of the 
work done by this type of special supervisor: 
. Visits each teacher in grades I-IV, once in four weeks. 
. Gives model work on visits. 
. Helps teachers to do work in better ways. 
. Holds a grade meeting with teachers of each grade, once a 
month. : 
. Prepares bulletins to aid teachers in work. 
. Gives demonstration work at city institute. 
Keeps accurate notes on all visits. 
. Gives criticisms directly to teachers. 
. Keeps .principals informed as to work and progress of all 
teachers.

The problem of the special supervisor. It is the travel- 
ing supervisors of special subjects who are likely to cause 
the most trouble for the principal, and at times they, instead 
of the principal, run the school and direct the work when 
they are in the building. Coming as they also do with some- 
thing of the standing and authority of an assistant superin- 
tendent, not infrequently they tend to regard the principal as
-P-A-G-E-433
  THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 417 
a subordinate and to assume thatthe direction of their special 
work is something of which he knows little and over which 
he has no control. Much will depend on the traditions as to 
such service which have grown up within the city, and the 
place given to the principal in the educational organization 
by the superintendent of schools and the rules and regula- 
tions of the board of education. In some cities the superin- 
tendent will have established the conception that the princi- 
pal is the head of the school, and that all directions for its 
control must be approved by him; in other cities this will 
not be the case, the special supervisors will largely ignore 
him in directions to the teachers, and when in his building 
will do about as they see fit. At times the first knowledge 
a principal may have that a special supervisor is in his build- 
ing will be when he finds his programs disarranged and the 
regular work of the school upset to suit the requirements of 
some supervisor. As these special supervisors frequently 
have no regular schedule of visitation, the work of a school 
for a day may be completely upset by the unannounced ar- 
rival of two or three of them. ' 
In addition to their actual classroom visitations the spe- 
cial supervisors frequently call the teachers together, by 
grades or by subjects, and give them instruction as to the 
work they are to do. Sometimes these are merely a restate- 
ment of a printed outline, and are onerous in character. 
Sometimes the work outlined is so excessive that it tends to 
destroy the needed balance in the work of the classes. The 
principals are not invited to these meetings, they are not 
met as a body by the special supervisors, and they must in- 
quire of their teachers to learn what type of directions have 
been issued. Not only are the teachers not advised to talk 
over the work to be done with their principals, but at times 
they are advised to the contrary. Sometimes, in arranging 
the school programs, the special supervisors are very insist-
-P-A-G-E-434
418 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
ent that the arrangement he made with their work primarily 
in mind. Where but one or two supervisors are concerned 
this might be possible, but with three or four it is not. In 
the making up of school programs in the Autumn, delay is 
sometimes occasioned because the supervisors whose work 
calls for regular visitations have not made up their sched- 
ules.’ Some of the special supervisors, too, are possessed of 
the so-called “artistic temperament,” and are not easy to 
get along with even under the best of. circumstances. In 
consequence, many principals wash their hands of the 
whole business and do not attempt to direct in any way 
the work of the special subjects so supervised. 
The principal and the special supervisor. Such condi- 
tions are bad for a school, and are fundamentally wrong at- 
titudes for special supervisors or teachers to be allowed to 
take. |They indicate a lack of proper organization of the 
work of school supervision, against which the principals of 
the school system ought politely but very firmly to protest) 
They represent a false perspective and a misconception as to 
the proper place and function of the principal of a school. \ 
That many of the school principals know little about the 
special work and would only interfere with the special su- 
pervisors if given control over them is not only a poor de- 
fense of a fundamentally wrong system, but one that. tends 
to produce the wrong type of principal as well. 
As was stated in Chapter IT, school administration should 
tend to magnify the office of the school principal, and this of- 
fice should be one of fixed responsibility and authority. All 
that relates to the work of the teachers or children in his 
building is his province, and in the organization and admin- 
istration of his building he should be regarded as the head. 
Even the superintendent of schools for the city ought to con- 
‘sult with him before giving orders for changes in the organi- 
zation or work of his building. \ Of course this does not mean 
 
-P-A-G-E-435
THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 419 
that the superintendent could,not advise a teacher as to 
better plans for instruction, or the school janitor for better 
heating or cleaning. Such directions will tend to strengthen 
and not to weaken the principal’s authority, but even 
in simple directions the superintendent may wisely work 
through the principal instead of directly. / In the case-of- 
special supervisors and teachers, even though they do come 
with the authority of assistant superintendents, they should 
be made to feel that they must respect the position and au- 
thority of the principal in his building, and where possible 
consult with and work through him. They should also be 
expected to meet approximately the same standards, in 
their supervision of the instruction, that the principal sets 
for himself in such work. 
Types of difficulties encountered. The more school or- 
ganization passes from the grade type toward the depart- 
mental and platoon type, the more the special traveling su- 
pervisors can be dispensed with. Under the platoon type of 
organization the teachers are employed and placed as spe- 
cial teachers, and the supervision of special subjects is then 
reduced to that of keeping up the tone and holding up the 
standards of the system, rather than of teaching teachers 
how toteach. The grade-type of organization calls for the 
largest number of special supervisors and the most class- 
room visitation by them, and consequently presents the 
possibility of the largest number of difficulties for the prin- 
cipal of the school. 
Some special supervisors bring the name special into dis- 
repute with the teachers by their exactions and their in- 
spectorial and critical manner. Some so over-emphasize 
their work that they encroach seriously on the pupils’ 
time. Some hold long teachers’ meetings to explain “ out- 
lines,” with a waste of the teachers’ time and strength and 
with little pedagogical return. Some know their subject
-P-A-G-E-436
420 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
fairly well but do not know children, and keep the teacher 
busy with discipline while they are present and for an hour 
after they are gone. Some fuss at what is being done, and 
feel that their work is being slighted because it is not made 
to count or to count more in the promotions. Some de- 
mand so many changes in programs and classes that regular 
work is seriously disrupted. Some seem to have no concep- 
tion as to a general school policy and administrative pur- 
poses, are left to do about as they please by the superintend- 
ent, and are much in need of expert supervision and advice 
themselves. Some, if not most, insist on rather uniform re- 
quirements, seemingly unaware of the great differences in 
the capacities and needs of different pupils and classes. 
Many special supervisors, to be sure, are persons of good 
sense and good judgment, are businesslike in the matter of 
their hours and work, are careful as to their relationships, 
have a proper appreciation of the place of their work in the 
School program, and not only give no trouble to the princi- 
pal but aid materially in giving tone and spirit to the school. 
Still more, as a consequence of such qualities and considera- 
tion, they secure an emphasis of their work by the teachers 
which leaves little to be desired and nothing to complain” 
of. Still, it must be admitted that this desirable type of 
supervisor is not the most common type, and that one of 
the troublesome problems every superintendent faces is 
that of how to handle the work of his special supervisors. 
On the other hand, the regular teachers of the building 
may have formed the habit of looking on the special super- 
visors as outsiders, their work as not entitled to the same 
consideration as the “regular subjects,” and as a sort of 
necessary evil imposed on the school by the superintendent. 
There may, too, be a disposition on the part of a number of 
the teachers to feel little responsibility for the work super- 
vised by the special teachers, and to leave it to them to do
-P-A-G-E-437
‘THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 421 
as completely as may be possible. If the special supervisors 
take charge of the class and do the teaching when they visit, 
instead of training the teachers to do it, this tendency on the 
part of the teachers will naturally become more and more 
marked. 
The place of the principal in special instruction. If the 
school principal, in such situations as have just been de- 
scribed, possesses no definite powers of control and is not 
considered responsible for the special work, and in turn dis- 
claims any duties connected with the special-instruction 
problem, the effect on the work of the school will be most 
unsatisfactory and may be positively demoralizing. If the 
instruction in the special subjects of study is to proceed 
properly, and if the teachers are to grow in ability to do 
their work, the principal must be in ultimate control and 
must keep and be kept in touch with what is being done. 
The principals of the city and the special supervisors, too, 
should work somewhat closely together, and the methods of 
the latter should be open to criticism by the principals indi- 
vidually or as a body. This much, at least, the principals 
of a city may properly ask. 
' If the following rather fundamental administrative prin- 
ciples are accepted as a basis for relationships, many of the 
difficulties so frequently experienced will disappear. 
1. In the organization and administration of a school building 
the principal is in control, and changes in organization should 
not be made by special supervisors without his consent, and 
would best be made by his specific orders. 
2. When the special teacher or supervisor enters his building to 
work, he or she comes under the professional supervision of 
the principal, and the relationship now established lies some- 
where between that of a teacher in the school and that of a 
visiting superintendent. 
8. The prime purpose of the special supervisor is to train the 
- regular teachers, where this is possible, to do the special work, 
and to this end the special supervisor stands in much the
-P-A-G-E-438
422 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
position of an assistant principal whos@ function is that of 
improving instruction within the school. 
4, The principal, conversely, should keep closely enough in 
touch with the plans and work of the special supervisors to 
enable him to promote efficiency in the work, and to help his 
teachers in planning their teaching of the special subjects. 
5. Special teachers who enter the building to do special teaching 
service, while in the building must be regarded as teachers in 
the school, and as subject to the same regulations and super- 
vision as are other teachers. 
6. The supervisor should usually reach the building before the 
opening of school, should inform the principal of his presence, 
should see that any changes in program desired meet with his 
approval, and in most cases should have a conference with the 
principal before leaving. If a teacher needs help, the super- 
visor should confer with her also. 
Cooperation with the supervisors. The above principles 
are quite fundamental, though not generally understood. 
While the principal may well expect that this much author- 
ity and responsibility should be placed with him, he will do 
better to keep his ultimate authority in the background and 
proceed by trying to find out how he may be of assistance, 
both to the teacher and to the supervisor, and what is to 
be or is being done. By helping the special supervisors to 
arrange a good working program for their visits, by discuss- 
ing briefly with them the aims and purposes and methods 
of their work, by dropping into the classrooms and observ- 
ing them at work, by knowing what his teachers do when 
the supervisor is not present, by showing approval or appre- 
ciation of any particularly good work by either supervisor 
or teacher, by helping the supervisors to locate and handle 
any special difficulties experienced by the teachers of the 
building, and by frequently turning what they do or using 
their special knowledge for something of special value to the 
building, a good basis for codperation between teachers, su- 
pervisors, and the principal himself will be laid. All such 
   
-P-A-G-E-439
  THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 493 
service tends to make teachers and pupils alike feel the im- 
portance of the work, and will greatly lessen the friction so 
common between the school and the special supervisors. It 
also enables a principal to diagnose the difficulties of a 
specialist who is not yet a teacher, and to hold somewhat in 
check the over-enthusiastic specialist who would distort the 
purpose of the school. 
The principal, by interested codperation with the special 
supervisor, can usually secure desired modifications of the 
work to fit the needs of his special school. Schools.in dif- 
ferent types of communities in a city have different needs as 
to work in some of the special subjects — notably cooking, 
sewing, music, and drawing. The principal and teachers, 
who know the home needs and know the children, are in a 
position to suggest many desirable changes in a uniform out- 
line that will make the work more worth while to their pu- 
pils. Ifthe grade teacher and the supervisor work together, 
and the grade teacher is given some liberty in modifying - 
outlines, much more of value can be accomplished. Teach- 
ers often have ideas of value, and these too frequently are 
not sought for or utilized by supervisors. If the supervisors 
feel that the principal is anxious to help them make their 
work a success, they will be more willing to do their part in 
adjusting their work as he desires. 
Best use of the supervisor’s time. Whether the special 
supervisors visit on a regular schedule or come unannounced 
will depend somewhat on the purposes of the visitation and 
the requirements of the school system. In any case an even 
distribution of time and a similar type of work in each class- 
room is not the best use of the supervisor’s time. The su- 
pervisor should always keep in mind that the real purpose 
of the work is to train the teachers to do without his help. 
Different teachers and schools naturally then call for differ- 
ent types and amounts of the helpful service the supervisor 
is supposed to be able to give,  
-P-A-G-E-440
  424 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
There are three main types of teachers which a special su- 
pervisor may find in any building: 
The first is the thoroughly capable teacher of the subject, 
who does the work well and who puts life into it. Such 
teachers need no visitation for inspectional purposes, and 
the chief service a special supervisor.can render here will be 
by a word of encouragement, by giving them some new idea, 
or by using them for demonstration purposes while training 
others to teach. 
Another type is that of the teacher who has sufficient 
knowledge of the subject-matter, and who proceeds with 
the work by methods which are pedagogically sound, but 
whose work is deadening on the pupils and tends to destroy 
their interest in the subject. It will be the chief work of the 
special supervisor here to develop — if this is possible — an 
interest in and an enthusiasm for the subject. 
The third type, mostly the newer and younger teachers, 
- are those who lack a real grasp of the subject-matter and 
whose methods are weak. While possessing less skill, this 
group will in general show more enthusiasm for the work and 
profit more from the instruction. They will need special at- 
tention and help to enable them to develop skill and a cor- 
rect method of work, and likewise to increase their grasp of 
the subject itself. Often the principal can be of real assist- 
ance with this class of teachers, and if so it will be wise for 
him to help the special teacher. 
The special supervisor in the classrooms. The bulk of 
the actual teaching of the subject should be done by the reg- 
ular classroom teachers, and not by the special supervisor. 
The latter will probably desire to give occasional model les- 
sons, and should do so, but this will still leave most of the 
teaching to the regular teacher, if she can do it. The same 
principles apply here as would apply to a lesson in geog- 
raphy or arithmetic. If the regular teacher can do the 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
C 
THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 425 
work reasonably well she should do it, the special supervisor 
taking the class at times to illustrate a point or a principle, 
and surrendering it again to the classroom teacher. New 
teachers will need extra help, as do new teachers in any kind 
of classroom work. The supervisor should be careful, how- 
ever, not to let it appear to the pupils that the teacher is 
being taught how to-teach. 
In working in the classrooms certain principles ought to 
apply in the relations that are established between the spe- 
cial supervisor and the classroom teacher. These may be 
summarized as follows: 
1. The regular classroom time should be carefully adhered to. 
The special teacher should not attempt work of a kind that 
cannot be done in the time allotted to the special subject. ° 
2. Demonstration lessons by the special supervisor should be of 
the same general character as the classroom teacher is ex- 
pected to give, and should be open to the same questioning 
as to purpose and plan and results, by teacher or principal, as 
would be a lesson by the teacher. 
8. It is usually bad policy to interrupt a recitation by questions 
or remarks, although the teacher or supervisor may approve 
or request such. Breaking in by the supervisor tends to 
cheapen what the teacher does in the eyes of the pupils, and 
consequently weakens her authority with the children. | 
4. A supervisor should observe the same proprieties as a prin~ 
cipal in not criticizing the work of a teacher before the pupils, 
or challenging a point of view in their presence. 
5. A demonstration lesson by a supervisor should have a definite 
purpose, and this should be made clear to the teacher in 
advance. 
If. the regular teacher should be unable to learn to teach 
the special subject, as might happen in music or drawing, 
the principal should arrange some exchange of work between 
teachers in the building that will care for the subject, and 
not expect the special supervisor either to do the impossible 
or to instruct the class. The prime purpose of the special 
supervisor, it should always be remembered, is to train the 
 
-P-A-G-E-442
  426 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
teachers to do work for which they are not as yet fully pre- 
pared. Every visit of the special supervisor should con- 
tribute something toward making the teacher more able to do 
without the supervisor entirely, and the special supervisors 
will have achieved their largest influence when they shall 
have made themselves no longer necessary. 
Departmental-type organization. Some of the difficulties 
so far stated disappear for the upper grades when we pass 
from the grade-school type of organization to the depart- 
mental type of school. The departmental plan, however, is 
not generally employed lower than the sixth grade, but in 
the grades from the sixth up it provides a form of specializa- 
tion that makes it easier to secure good instruction in the 
special subjects without the necessity of so much oversight 
by the special supervisors. Teachers can now be placed, 
and new ones employed, with some reference to their com- 
petency to teach the special subjects. Still more, all the 
instruction in any one special subject may now be given in 
one room, which may itself be somewhat specialized in 
equipment and “atmosphere.” The pupils move to this 
room, instead of the teacher moving, which is also an ad- 
vantage. 
A glance at Table IV, page 173, giving the daily program 
for grades six, seven, and eight of a departmental-type 
school, will show the degree of specialization of instruction 
that may be attained for the upper grades under such a plan 
of organization. Four teachers, it will be seen, are used to 
teach these grades, and they are specialized by subjects as 
follows: 
A — Reading and Literature ($), History, Penmanship. 
B— Mathematics, Drawing, Science. 
C — Reading and Literature (4), Music, Hygiene, and Civics. 
D — Composition and Language, Spelling, and Word Study» 
Teacher D is also relieved for one sixty-minute period a
-P-A-G-E-443
THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 427 
week, by special teachers who take the boys for work in 
manual training and the girls for work in sewing and cook- 
ing. The difficulties encountered in teaching the special 
subjects in these upper grades, either with or without spe- 
cial supervision, are in consequence greatly decreased. For 
these grades at least — and in these grades the most difficult 
special work is to be done — the teacher is specialized and 
the best talent the school affords may be selected for the 
work. 
Platoon-type organization. The platoon type of school 
organization provides for a still greater degree of specializa- 
tion, in that two types of teachers — classroom, and special 
teachers — are now employed for all the work above the 
first, or at most, the second grade. An inspection of Table 
V, page 176, will show the distribution of teachers in the 
school shown in Figure 9, page. 101, when organized as a 
platoon-type school. Table VI, page 178, shows the weekly 
program for this same school, and reveals still more clearly 
the specialization of the instruction now provided through- 
out the school. Eight classroom teachers teach the drill 
subjects, while eight other special teachers handle the spe- 
cial subjects, the distribution now being: 
8 Class teachers teach: 8 Special teachers teach: 
Phonics Music 
Spelling and word call Drawing 
Reading Science and Geography 
Language Manual Training 
Composition Domestic Arts 
Penmanship Gymnastics and Play 
Arithmetic Auditorium 
History Literature 
How much more effective instruction can be made, and 
how much simpler the supervision of the instruction will be 
for “the -principal, a glance at these tables will reveal. If 
the special teachers selected for this work are well prepared
-P-A-G-E-444
428 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
they will need but little assistance in their work from the 
special supervisors. In small cities, given good principals, 
or an assistant to the superintendent interested in the spe- 
cial work, this special supervision might almost be dis- 
pensed with; in large cities the special supervisors’ staff can 
be materially reduced in size and used for a different kind 
of supervisory service. 
The supervisory work of the principal. Under either the 
departmental or the platoon type of organization the super- 
visory work of the principal will now be changed somewhat 
in direction and purpose. Instead of having to keep in 
touch with what the special supervisors desire and do, and 
performing balance-wheel and corrective work, it will now 
be the duty of the principal to supervise the special work on 
approximately the same basis as the so-called regular sub- 
jects. All subjects now become regular subjects, and all 
now come definitely within the scope of his work as the 
supervisor of the instruction within his school. It will now 
be his duty to see that the teachers of the special subjects 
keep a proper balance in what they do, and that they do 
not let their enthusiasm for their special subjects run away 
with them. He will need to keep even more closely in 
touch with what is attempted and done, with the nature of 
the work-assignments, and with the standards set up for 
accomplishment than was expected under the grade-school 
form of educational organization. 
The principal’s work with all the so-called special teachers 
under a platoon type of organization, as was said above, will 
not be essentially different from what is called for in looking 
after the special teachers who are in or who come to a grade- 
type building. These may include ungraded-room teach- 
ers, coach teachers, teachers for classes of defectives of 
various types, disciplinary-class teachers, teachers of classes 
for the oral instruction of the deaf, playground teachers, and
-P-A-G-E-445
THE SPECIAL TEACHERS AND THEIR WORK 429 
teachers of manual training, cooking, sewing, and print- 
ing. All such special teachers, when in his building at work, 
are regular teachers in the building, and his supervisory 
oversight and control over their work does not differ essen- 
tially from that over the regular classroom teachers. Nei- 
ther is his responsibility for helping them in their teaching 
problems any less. He may not presume to know their spe- 
cial work, but the fundamental principles of the art of teach- 
ing, the teaching technique they employ, and in particular 
the results of their work with the children, are matters upon 
which he may properly offer suggestions and, in case of need, 
exercise certain control. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Does a principal need to arrange any special program for a visiting 
primary supervisor? Why? : 
2. Assume that a special drawing supervisor arrives unexpectedly some 
morning at the building, has only the morning to spend, and wants to 
see the work in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grades. The time al- 
lotment for drawing is twenty-five minutes, and there are six teachers 
in these grades (two thirds, and two fourths) in the building. Leav- 
ing the fifth-grade program (Table III, page 171) as it is, arrange a 
schedule for the supervisor that will give him a chance to see regular 
work in all rooms, and a,short conference with the principal as to the 
work before he leaves the building at noon. 
8. Suppose, at the recess time of some grade, you find a room late in com- 
ing out, and on investigation you find a special supervisor has arrived, 
rearranged the programs, and held the class. What would you do? 
4, Show that the demand for full school control by the principal does not 
arise from any desire to exercise authority or to show his importance, 
but represents sound administrative conceptions as to the office he 
holds. é 
5. Formulate the arguments for and against a regular schedule of visita- 
tion by the supervisors of special subjects. 
6. In some cities special supervisors try to demand that principals ar- 
range classroom programs so that the work in a special subject may 
come in sequence in the grades, in order to facilitate visitation and 
work. Show, by programs, that this may be possible for a few special 
teacher subjects (manual training, domestic arts, music), but would be 
quite difficult for many subjects. Is it necessary for subjects super- 
vised, but not taught? 
 
-P-A-G-E-446

7. What use might be made of Teacher D (page 426) the sixty-minute 
period a week she is relieved of her class while the boys go to manual 
training and the girls to cooking or sewing? 
8. Does the companion-class form of school organization (Chapter VIII, 
Figure 14) decrease the need for special subject supervisors?

~- CHAPTER XXII 
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 
Supervision a supreme duty. In Chapter III the impor- 
tance of the supervisory function was pointed out, and it was 
stated there that, of all the different aspects of a principal’s 
work, this is the most essential and the one which he must 
in some way find time to do. This idea is not likely, under 
present conditions in the principalship in our American cit- 
ies, to be emphasized too strongly. All else’that the princi- 
pal may do, important as this all else may be, is after all but 
getting ready for the most important service of all. All the 
work in the organization and the administration of a school 
is but the shaping of conditions so that teachers and pupils 
may meet together under the best possible conditions for in- 
struction — the prime purpose of the school. To contin- 
ually guide and improve this instruction, so that the chil- 
dren in the school may develop best and most rapidly under 
it, should be the deepest interest of the principal. If the re- 
sponsibility for instructional progress is not placed definitely 
on him by the superintendent of schools or the rules of the 
school board, he should assume it any way, and should in- 
sist that he be given time to devote to this most important 
of functions. _ f : 
One who has read even a few of the many school surveys 
published within recent years cannot but be impressed with 
the emphasis placed by the surveyors on this function of the 
school principal, and also how frequently they find that the 
function is either not assumed or is abused. The more 
recent scientific studies of grade progress, made by stand- 
ardized educational tests, have all tended to fix the respon- 
sibility for the success of the school work still more definitely
-P-A-G-E-448
432 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
with the principal of the school. One of the most striking 
proofs of the principal’s responsibility for results through 
supervision is found in the large differences revealed, by 
many of the surveys, in the achievements of the pupils in 
the different schools of the same city. These differences oc- 
cur even when no marked differences are to be found in the 
course of study, textbooks, teachers, or pupils, and, in some 
cases where pupil— and population — differences are 
marked in various parts of the city, some of the better 
schools are found where they might least be expected. Dr. 
J. M. Rice, in his pioneer investigation of school results, dis- 
covered that “the striking differences are found not so much 
between individual classrooms as between buildings,” and 
the more scientific school surveyors since his day have often 
confirmed his statement. 
The supervision of instruction, then, must be regarded as 
the one supreme duty of a school principal, the one for which 
he must find time by minimizing other duties, and the one 
for which he must hold himself responsible whether the su- 
perintendent of schools or the board of education does or 
does not. That a great number of elementary-school princi- 
pals throughout the country to-day are exerting little or no 
influence on the instruction carried on in their schools, and 
are contributing little or nothing toward the primary pur- 
pose for which their schools are maintained, cannot be ac- 
cepted as excusing such neglect. The prime test of the 
competency of an elementary-school principal is his ability 
to improve the instruction in his school by helpful and con- 
structive service to his teachers in their work of instructing 
children; the measure of his interest in such service is the 
‘means he employs to find time to do such work. 
Supervisory mistakes. Some principals do not seem to 
know what to do; others have the idea that they are to act 
as detectives. The result is much misdirected effort and
-P-A-G-E-449
  PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 433 
many mistakes. A common defect in the work of many 
principals who attempt to give some supervision is that they 
seem unable to offer constructive service to teachers after 
their visits. Some only criticize; many only observe and 
go away, leaving their teachers entirely in doubt as to what 
they may have thought of the work they saw. The princi- 
pal forms his opinion of the teacher and keeps it to himself; 
the teacher in turn does the same of him. In consequence it 
not infrequently happens, in our cities, that a teacher is rec- 
ommended for dismissal by a principal who has never made 
any definite attempt to help her, and who perhaps has never 
given her to understand that her work was other than satis- 
factory. Many a teacher’s professional career would be 
quite different if she were taken in hand from the start by a 
strong principal, and helped to a firm foundation based on 
sound pedagogical procedure. 
The supervisory function is sometimes abused, in that it is 
exercised in a harsh, severe, and dictatorial manner. ‘‘ You 
do it this way”; “You should have done it this way”; 
“Don’t do it that way”; “You don’t do it right”; “ You fail 
to get results,” are types of supervisory, criticisms not infre- 
quently given. Notes are sometimes left on teachers’ desks, 
in criticism of lessons observed, which lead to weeping on 
the part of the teachers. Some principals seem to visit only 
at times when conditions are unusual, as though their aim 
was to detect the poorest work done. Principals have been 
reported as having entered classrooms with a stenographer, 
taken down the words of teacher and pupils, left the room 
without comment, and never to have mentioned the work 
seen to the teacher afterward. Principals have also been re- 
ported as seldom visiting a classroom exercise except toward 
spring, about the time they would be called upon by the 
board of education to recommend teachers for dismissal. 
At that time they visit certain teachers for a whole day
-P-A-G-E-450
  434 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
at a time, take notes, and offer no comments or sugges~ 
tions. 
All such types of so-called supervision are fundamentally 
wrong. They do not help teachers to instruct children bet- 
ter, they destroy the fine feeling that ought to exist, they 
make coéperation largely impossible, and they tend to drive 
teachers into labor unions and to agitation for life-tenure 
laws. Under such conditions it is the principal who ought 
to be changed, instead of the teachers. If the superintend- 
ent of schools were to deal with him by these same methods, 
he might appreciate better how the teachers feel who have 
to take this bitter medicine. 
As a partial corrective of such errors, one superintendent 
recently issued the following cautions, in printed form, to 
the principals of his city: 
MAY I REMIND YOU: 
1. That the teachers are the real operators of the school plant. 
2. That your chief function is to clear the way for them. 
3. That their comfort, their self-respect, their potentiality, are to 
be safeguarded at every turn. The wise principal not only 
guards but nourishes these three. 
LET ME COUNSEL YOU: 
1. To show respect unfailingly for the judgment and abilities of 
the teachers. 
. To judge them not too soon nor too late. 
. To hear their side through patiently. 
. To use the question five times to the declaration once. 
. To encourage every one in your corps to find her way of doing 
her job better. 
. To seek out unfulfilled capacity in both your teachers and 
yourself. Or He 09 2 a 
Beginning supervision in a new school. Assuming a new 
principal taking charge of a school, one who is interested and 
competent, and who is skillful in arranging his time schedule 
so as to find the needed time for classroom visitation and the 
supervision of instruction, one important measure of his tact  
-P-A-G-E-451
  PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 435 
and skill will now be how he will begin, what he will do, and 
how intelligently he will plan what he does. Just how he 
will begin and what he will do at first should be determined 
much by what he finds needs to be done. 
The most favorable situation will be where the new prin- 
cipal inherits a school in which a strong and masterful prin- 
cipal has been in control, and where the teaching body is 
alert, capable, and progressive. In such a case he may al- 
most from the first plan a progressive and advanced type of, 
school supervision, and may proceed along lines that we will 
indicate a little further on. It is more likely that the new 
principal will not inherit such good conditions, and will need 
to lead up to such a type of school supervision, for a time, at 
least, rather feeling his way. The most unfavorable situa- 
tion will perhaps be where a principal succeeds to a school 
over which a well-meaning and very kindly administrative 
type of principal has presided for a quarter-century or more, 
and in which the teaching force has remained rather station- 
ary and has come to accept his office-type of administration, 
and the freedom from supervision that it entailed, as the 
proper type of work for the principal of the school. Such a 
school may be quite well managed and orderly, and the 
teachers probably will be earnest, well-disposed, and well- 
satisfied with what they are doing, but inclined to resent at 
once any change in the status quo. Many of the teachers 
may have taught the same grade in the same room for so 
long that they have come to feel an ownership in both. The 
best advice to give a principal under such conditions is to 
“Go Slowly.” 
Good introductory plans. A good plan would be first to get 
the school going, study the organization, plan your work to 
have needed time for supervision, and then start in to visit 
and see and learn. Begin in the first grade and work up- 
ward, keep your opinions to yourself, say that you want to  
-P-A-G-E-452
  436 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
see the school and its work, note conditions, and try to find 
things to commend as you go along. Such general com- 
mendations as “a well-behaved class,” “a well-kept room,” 
“a bright-looking lot of pupils,” “you questioned the class 
well,” and “that was good drill work,” are types of remarks 
that may be made when deserved. After two rounds of the 
school, conditions will become clearer and needs more evi- 
dent, and then you can plan what to do and how to start. A 
magazine club may be suggested and started, some teacher 
may be asked to present an idea to a teachers’ meeting that 
can be thrown open for discussion, or some teacher whom 
you have seen present a lesson with energy and some skill 
may be commended and asked to teach some new but sim- 
ilar lesson before all or part of the teachers, following with a 
discussion of it. This gives an opportunity for skillful ques- 
tioning on the conduct of the lesson and the art of teaching, 
for which the principal should be prepared. ‘Did the les- 
son show motive?” “Was it well organized?” “Was it well 
based on the needs and knowledge of the children?” “Did 
it challenge their interest?” “Were they self-reliant?” 
“Were the questions thought-provoking? ” ‘Did the lesson 
move?” “Was the teaching technique good?” “Are the 
educational principles (which have been brought out) ap- 
plicable to instruction in other subjects, or other grades?” 
Such a discussion, if shaped to challenge thinking, will do so, 
and will probably show results in the classroom instruc- 
tion. 
Another introductory plan is to select problems appli- 
cable to three or four grades or teachers, propose that they 
and you stay some afternoon after school for a little while to 
consider them, prepare-yourself so as to be able both to give 
. help that will be recognized as such and will challenge the 
teachers and make them think too, and then to do follow-up 
work on the problems in the classrooms. Difficulties com-
-P-A-G-E-453
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 437 
mon to the school may be brought up at the general meet- 
ings. The work of the principal will be not so much to offer 
his ideas or to criticize as to challenge thinking, by continu- 
ally asking questions and searching for pedagogical reasons 
for procedure. His larger knowledge and grasp of educa- 
tional principles will be of much use to him in such a situa- 
tion. After some such careful beginning, the next step 
would best be to ask permission to take a class and teach it 
before the teacher, doing good demonstration work and let- 
ting the teacher question his technique. 
Accompany this procedure by loyal support of the teach- 
ers’ authority in discipline, protect the teachers from petty 
annoyances, give the impression by actions rather than by 
words that you want to work with them rather than over 
them, and say words of encouragement whenever you can. 
Always give credit for any good work to the teacher rather 
than taking it for your school, be considerate, appreciate 
fully their difficulties, be just and impartial in dealing with 
all school problems, and in time a new principal will be re- 
ceived even into the worst of situations, and he may then 
proceed to assume control and begin active supervision of 
the instruction of his school. 
Planning what is to be done. After a principal feels that 
he is able to proceed with the important work of helping his 
teachers to become better teachers, and of improving the in- 
struction his children receive, it is essential that he lay out 
some plan or plans for what he proposes to do. Just asa 
principal’s working schedule needs to be well organized, to 
enable him to find time for supervision, so his classroom vis- 
itation needs to becarefully planned if he expects it to be 
most fruitful in results for his teachers and in giving him 
firm control of his school. He must now lay out in his own 
mind what it is he wants to see and do, know why he wants 
to see it and what he will do with the results, and then plan  
-P-A-G-E-454
438 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
his visitation carefully with his teachers’ programs before 
him. The more definitely he plans what he is after the 
more certain will he be to get results that are valuable, the 
surer he will be to become interested in the work of supervi- 
sion, and the easier he will find it to minimize the time given 
to routine work and to visitors and to find the needed time 
for systematic and helpful classroom service. 
The poorest and most unprofi if le type of classroom su- 
pervision he can give is the randony visitation of classrooms, 
where he “just drops in, to se@what is going on,”’ and stays 
for from ten minutes to an hour, according to whether or 
not he finds the work interésting. While such supervision 
is of course better than none t all, it is far less effective, and 
does both teacher and prineipal far less good, than would 
carefully planned visitation. Some such brief and random 
visitation a principal will always want to do, especially at 
the beginning of a new school year, or where a substitute or 
a new and inexperienced teacher is at work, but it should 
not represent his regular procedure. During the first week 
of school it may be the best kind of visitation, as the princi- 
pal can thus quickly get a line on the school and the work 
of its teachers and children. There will also be other times, 
throughout the year, when the principal will want to drop 
into the classrooms, for a few-minutes at a time, to see how 
things are going and to get a measure of the health and san- 
itary conditions, the atmosphere of work, and similarstems. 
A few minutes, though, usually will be sufficient for such 
inspectional visits, and not many of them will be needed 
after a school is once well under way. School inspection 
would be a much better term to apply to such work than 
school supervision, for it is not school supervision in any real 
or helpful sense of the term. 
Types of supervisory plans. A principal who desires to 
make his classroom supervision effective and helpful will
-P-A-G-E-455
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 439 
need to formulate some more definite plan for his work than 
_ mere random visitation. 
One type of planning, sometimes followed, is the day-to- 
day planning, based on an inspection of such lesson plans as 
the one given on page 393. The principal can then plan to 
go at definite times to see definite things done, has an op- 
portunity to evaluate the lesson from the points of view of 
aim, method, and results, and then may afterward offer the 
teacher suggestions as to more effective procedure or an im- 
provement in teaching technique. With new teachers who 
are in need of special help, such visitation may be very use- 
ful, though a more detailed lesson plan for some of the sub- 
jects than the one shown on page 393 should then be ex- 
pected. The day-by-day selective planning may also be 
useful as an alternate on days that are badly broken up, 
when careful systematic visitation is out of the question. 
Such a day-to-day planning of visitation is superior to the 
random classroom visitation so commonly followed, but it 
lacks good organization and continuity of effort, and still 
better plans are possible and in most cases ought to be used. 
Good planning ought to be done for a longer period than 
a single day. Week-to-week planning is much better, and 
two or three or four weeks may profitably be laid out, 
though the type of work done may vary from week to week. 
Under such long-time planning the principal concentrates on 
one or possibly two subjects of instruction, and the accom- 
panying teaching technique, and then follows the subject or 
subjects day by day through the grades; or he may study 
one or two grades as a whole; or he may take different types 
of working groups, as a C or an A group, and inspect the work 
in some one grade or in a succession of grades. Still again, 
attention may be centered for a week at a time on some gen- 
eral téaching problem, such as the motivation of the work, 
training the pupils to study, socializing the recitation, or ef-
-P-A-G-E-456
  
440 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
fective questioning. Whatever the particular plan or aim it 
should not be random or indefinite, no one subject or type 
of work should be pursued long enough or often enough to 
become a fetich, and in the carrying out of any type of 
planned work the principal should systematically concen- 
trate upon the most definite objectives he is able to select. 
Definite long-time supervisory planning. If the aim of 
the principal is helpful supervision, and not inspection and 
detection, there can be no objection to his informing his 
teachers of the aims he has formulated for his supervisory 
visitation for a week or more in advance. This might be 
done at his regular teachers’ meetings, or, better, a schedule 
might be posted on the principal’s bulletin board for the in- 
spection of the teachers. Still better would be a mimeo- 
graphed outline, a copy to be placed on each teacher’s desk. 
It is as fair for the principal to be expected to plan his work 
before the teachers in advance of visitation as it is for the 
teachers to be expected to plan their work and to reduce 
their plans to writing for his inspection. It is also a good 
thing for the principal to do, for its influence on the school. 
The more the teachers are taken into the confidence of the 
principal in his supervisory work, the more teaching is made 
to partake of the nature of codperative work between 
teachers and principal for the good of the pupils, and the 
less it seems to be inspection and checking up, the more will 
teachers be encouraged to do their best and the better will 
be the spirit prevailing throughout the schools. The princi- 
pal who can make his visits welcome, who encounters good 
will as he goes from room to room, and who because of this 
sees the best his teachers can do and draws from them their 
best work and ideas, has an asset of great value that he 
ought, to strive to keep.

  Form 4, A Cuassroom Supervision OUTLINE 
 
-P-A-G-E-458
  442 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
an outline of proposed work, mimeographed and placed on 
each teacher’s desk at the beginning of the rhonth, would 
tend toward definiteness of work, economy of time, and ef- 
fective supervision, because perfectly definite objective aims 
have been set up. Rightly used, such carefully planned 
supervision will lead to more invitations from teachers to 
inspect work and to visit classrooms than a principal can 
attend to. 
Even such a well-formulated working plan as that given 
ought to be capable of some adjustment, and teachers ought 
to feel free to make requests of the principal to that effect. 
Some teacher may feel that her pupils would show their 
progress better to-day than two days from now; another 
might prefer a visit to-morrow instead of to-day; another 
may frankly say that what she is doing is not working out 
well, and ask the principal not to judge her work by the 
progress of a particular working group. Small happenings, 
too, disturb classes as well as teachers, and ought to be 
taken into consideration. Teachers, like other human be- 
ings, usually develop faith in themselves in about the same 
degree that the principal shows faith in them. 
Professional leadership. Some pertinent reading has 
been suggested at the bottom of the outline, which teachers 
may or may not do, but with which the principal should be 
thoroughly familiar. It is perhaps best that any reading by 
the teachers should be voluntary, coming from a feeling of 
need for it. It will also be noted that each two weeks of 
work has here been made the basis for a teachers’ meeting, 
in which the principal will present the results as he saw them 
and bring out discussion. Used in this way such a discus- 
sion is likely to be lively, and the principal will need to be 
well informed. Clearly beyond all but the most superior of 
his teachers the principal should know the best thought on 
the work he is attempting to supervise. He must lead in
-P-A-G-E-459
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 443, 
his school, as he expects his teachers to lead in their class- 
rooms. ; 
The planned outline gives him many advantages in this. 
Concentrated as it is on one subject for a week or more at a 
time, he can study up both the course of study material and 
the wisest thought on what should be the aims in the work. 
Teaching technique, in its different types, he will also need 
to know, but this is general rather than particular, and 
much the same principles apply to all instruction. With 
such a visitation outline he can also prepare himself much 
more easily to take a class and demonstrate his ideas, as he 
can now prepare on certain limited topics or lessons, and 
then demonstrate only with these. By making thoughtful 
preparation in advance his “impromptu” demonstrations 
will be much more effective. 
A young principal would, for a few years, find that such 
work calls for a large amount of thinking and reading and 
preparation. This, however, will be good for him, and is 
just what he ought to be doing. Few investments he can 
make are likely to yield such large dividends in the future. 
He should keep notes on his reading, preserve his outlines, 
build up a working library, and mark his books. In time the 
work will become easier as he accumulates knowledge and 
experience, and the results will well repay the effort made. 
He may put it down as an axiom that it is only on a basis of 
some such broad and substantial knowledge of the teaching 
process, and of the aims and means and ends in education, 
that a principal may hope firmly to establish his professional 
leadership in a school. In organization and administration 
he may impose his leadership, and if things go reasonably 
well it will be accepted; in educational matters he must es- 
tablish his leadership on the basis of understanding, consid- 
eration; human feelings, and in particular on broader knowl- 
edge and an ability to point the way to larger things, or his
-P-A-G-E-460
  444 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
leadership will not be accepted by the teachers. There 
may be a form of lip service, but it will never be genuine and 
real. 
Paving the way for helpfulness. The formulation of a 
good working plan for supervisory visitation, however, 
represents but the beginning. Even adequate professional 
knowledge in addition may not suffice to establish good re- 
lations and secure the best results. Nowhere in all the prin- 
cipal’s work does his personality and method of attack play 
so important apart as in the work of classroom visitation 
and supervision. The principal is here dealing with the hp- 
man factor at close range, and it is important that he estab- 
lish the proper relationships before he goes very far, for he 
cannot help a teacher who does not repose confidence in 
him. He must, therefore, be careful to start right. He 
must remember that women are far more easily offended by 
even the most helpful of criticism than are men, and that a 
few women are especially resentful of any criticism from a 
man. Patience, kindliness, consideration, and helpfulness 
are necessary to win the confidence of teachers, and unless 
teachers come to feel that the principal is a friend working 
with them, and interested in their success, rather than a crit- 
ical representative of the central office or the board of edu- 
cation, helpful relations are not likely to be established be- 
tween them. 
The principal’s prime purpose in visitation is not to dis- 
cover for himself or for any one else if he has weak teachers; 
in all probability he has, and it is one of his important func- 
tions to try to improve them. His purpose is rather to find 
where and how he can be of service. Helpful leadership, 
rather than inspection or dictation or criticism, is what the 
teachers need. Mere criticism, except as a basis for con- 
structive suggestions, is deadening, while criticism based on 
sound pedagogical principles is a direct challenge to the
-P-A-G-E-461
ne 
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 445 
teacher’s knowledge and thinking. Encouragement, sugges- 
tion, practical demonstrations, drawing out the teacher’s 
best, and with criticism only as a basis for constructive help, 
should represent the principal’s chief line of approach. It is 
a good plan to make teachers feel that you believe them in 
earnest, that you consider what they are doing as of large 
importance, that you expect them to go ahead and keep 
busy, and that, as principal, you are there largely to be of as- 
sistance to them. Principals who inspire ‘confidence will 
find that teachers will often come to them and tell them of 
their mistakes and ask for suggestions, instead of trying to 
conceal such for fear of making a bad impression. Such an 
attitude of frankness is very desirable, and the principal 
ought to encourage such confidence by confidence and help- 
fulness in return. 
The technique of visitation. If the principal is visiting 
casually and without following a systematic plan, such as is 
given in the Classroom Visitation Program on page 441, and 
as he may frequently desire to do at times even though an 
outline is in use for the more thorough supervision of the in- 
struction, the following suggestions as to procedure should 
ordinarily be observed: 
1. Enter the classroom quietly, and disturb what is in progress as 
little as is possible. 
2. Do not rush across the room, shake hands with the teacher, 
and make a general commotion. A quietly nodded ‘“‘Good 
morning” is less disturbing and just as useful. 
8. Preferably sit in the back of the room, or at one side, rather 
than on a chair in front. You want to be a quiet and largely 
an unnoticed observer, and not the center of what is going on. 
Sit at the teacher’s desk or in front only if you expect to take 
charge of the class and conduct the lesson. 
4, Make your presence in the room as little noticed as possible, 
and gradually train both teachers and pupils to go on with 
their work and pay little attention to your presence. 
5. Appear to be an interested observer or listener, entering into
-P-A-G-E-462
446 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the spirit of the class work. Do not sit with “a mask on” — 
bored, expressionless, sour — or leave the room with an evi- 
dent expression of disapproval. 
6. After the novelty of your presence wears off, give attention to 
the teaching process. Try to analyze it. 
7. Do not make notes on the lesson in a notebook or on a card 
while in the room, but do this outside after leaving. 
8. If the teacher seems to be in, difficulty and needs help, quietly 
move forward and suggest, in an undertone, the right proce- 
dure. Sometimes a question or two which changes the char- 
acter and direction of the lesson may be all that is needed. 
If the teacher does not bring the lesson around right, it may 
be a good time for you to take the class and yourself demon- 
strate a better procedure. 
9. Always ask the teacher’s permission to break into a recita- 
tion, even with a question, or, if you desire to take the class, 
always let the pupils feel that you have full confidence in 
the teacher, and that you continually defer to her as in con- 
trol. 
10. After a teaching demonstration for a new teacher it is usually 
best to leave the room, to avoid any embarrassment to her in 
resuming charge of the class. 
Whether visiting casually or by plan, it is best to try to 
see lessons as a whole. In doing so, the following additional 
suggestions will be found useful: 
11. Examine the teacher’s plan card or book, if you require or ex- 
pect such, to see just what she is about to do. If no plan card is | 
required, expect her to tell you, in a sentence or two, just what 
she plans to accomplish to-day. 
Stay throughout the entire lesson, and note the beginning, the 
steps in the instruction as it proceeds, the assignment of new 
work, and how the teacher sets the pupils to work and starts 
the next class. 
Give careful attention to the teacher’s procedure, analyze it 
for good and bad technique, but as above make no notes while 
in the room. 
14. Immediately after leaving the room make either a brief ana-, 
lytical summary, from which more detailed notes may be made 
later, or hastily fill out the desired record at once. 12. 
13
-P-A-G-E-463
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 447 
Visitation records. It has just been stated, as a principle 
of supervisory technique, that the principal should not take 
other than mental notes while observing a lesson, but should 
give his undivided attention to the work of the teacher and 
pupils, making his notes after leaving the classroom. Some 
supervisory authorities, mostly those who have worked in 
teacher-training practice schools, would disagree here, and 
would contend that the principal should make full and 
exact notes on each recitation-whole he visits for supervi- 
sion, embodying faulty questions and procedure, wrong 
aims, poor technique, etc. Some would even use a rather 
elaborate blank form for checking, with a carbon copy for the 
teacher. It is claimed that the teacher will soon become 
used to this procedure and not mind it. Perhaps the best 
answer to this point of view is that a supervisor should at- 
tempt to correct but a few things at a time; that an evident 
critical attitude always is disconcerting; that elaborate 
checking devices distract attention from the few large and 
central ideas; that a competent principal, after observing 
carefully a lesson-whole, ought to be able to analyze it suffi- 
ciently to make a brief card record; and that a collection of - 
such records will be sufficient for all practical purposes. 
Some principals keep rather full notes in a personal note- 
book; a few return to their office at once and dictate a rec- 
ord, with a copy for the teacher; some principals check 
their observations on a printed form, with a carbon dupli- 
cate for the teacher; and others use a card form of record as 
being easier to make, sort, find, and file, and which the teach- 
ers may see. A sample of a simple form of such a record is 
given on page 448. 
While an elaborate form of record keeping is more likely 
to be time-consuming than useful, some brief record on each 
supervisory visit it is desirable to make and to keep. Such 
a record form may also well be filed for the work of the

  PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 449 
special teachers and supervisors observed by the principal. 
The invariable making of a record leads to system, careful 
observation, definiteness in analysis and thinking, is useful 
in discussing the recitation later on with the teacher, con- 
tains good material from which to compile supervisory notes 
for teachers’ conferences, and is a useful record to file 
away. A series of such cards, numbered in order, will give 
an objective record of the defects and rate of progress and 
successes of any teacher. If it is thought desirable to have 
a conference with a teacher about the lesson observed, the 
date and general results of the conference should be re- 
corded on the card. 
Offering constructive criticisms. Different principals 
have different methods of offering their criticisms to their 
teachers. Some reserve their criticisms and suggestions for 
the general teachers’ meeting, and then offer them as gen- 
eral suggestions. This plan is quite likely to prove ineffec- 
tive. Criticisms and suggestions to be helpful need to be 
personal and given at the time when of most use, while gen- 
eral criticisms given to a group, later on, are likely to be ac- 
cepted as fault-finding and forgotten, or be taken to heart 
by those least in need of them. The most helpful sugges- 
tions will always be those given before the first flush of suc- 
cess or failure has departed. Sometimes, with most teach- 
ers always, a word of suggestion at the close of a teaching 
exercise will be all that is necessary. Often the suggestions 
will be of such a nature that it will be perfectly proper to 
give them at that time, if it can be done quietly and so as 
not to attract the unfavorable attention of the pupils or 
embarrass the teacher in their presence. Sometimes the 
class may well hear that the principal thinks the teacher’s 
work good, and why he thinks it good. Such comment, 
properly given, tends to strengthen the hold of the teacher 
on her class. 
     
-P-A-G-E-466
450 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Should the suggestions the principal desires to give be of 
such a nature as to require privacy or more time, there is 
nothing so effective as a personal conference with the 
teacher before she leaves the building for the day. A verbal 
conference always gives an opportunity for questions and 
answers and for a tactful, sympathetic putting of criticisms 
and suggestions that no letter to a teacher can ever afford. 
Words, tactfully spoken, usually do not stir up the resent- 
ment that comes from reading cold type. If such personal 
conferences are held quite often, and the spirit of them is 
kept right by the principal, they ought not to cause appre- 
hension on the part of the teachers. The work, the child, 
the good of the school are the elements to be kept in the fore- 
ground. Be impersonal, fair, just, and try to get the teach- 
er’s point of view. Remember that sound criticism seeks 
rather to discover and appreciate merits than to note faults, 
and to be helpful rather than destructive. Where such con- 
ferences are the rule, and the principal is helpful, the teach- 
ers come to expect them and the help they give and they- 
are taken as a matter of routine. 
Many a misunderstanding and many a failure in school 
work could be prevented by frank, constructive criticism 
given at the right time and in the right way. The unpleas- 
ant duty is likely to be put off until too late. Teachers are . 
permitted to continue in wrong practices, even when they 
mean ultimate failure, because the principal dislikes the 
duty of changing their methods by constructive advice. 
This is not fair to the teacher or to the children under her, 
and is a clear evasion of duty by the principal. If the prin- 
cipal knows his ground pedagogically, if his criticisms and 
suggestions are constructive and not merely captious and 
fault-finding in nature, and if he has from the start estab- 
lished the right type of relationships between his teachers 
and himself, he ought not to find such conferences the dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-467
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 451 
agreeable duty so many principals ‘seem to find them. 
Should a conference prove to be disagreeable, though, 
through no fault of the principal, the best plan is to go 
through with it — as tactfully as possible, to be sure — and 
start right with such a teacher, for if he does not do so he © 
can count with surety on more disagreeable encounters 
later on. Keep a sense of humor during it all. Sometimes 
a story or a laugh will relieve the situation and restore bal- 
ance and good feeling. 
Keeping the conference informal. The principal will do 
well to make such personal conferences as informal as possi- 
ble. Ordinarily it is best to drop into the teacher’s room 
later in the day, at recess or noon or after school, and begin 
the conference in a somewhat casual way by asking ques- 
tions as to the teacher’s procedure or purpose, and then grad- 
ually lead up to the suggestions intended to be given. “I 
was much interested, Miss Jones, in your recitation this 
morning, but I kept wondering through it all why you did 
so and so,” or “just what it was you were trying to do,” is 
not a bad way of beginning. It shows interest, commits 
the principal to nothing, puts the questionable procedure at 
once to the front, and gives the teacher a chance to explain. 
She will do this better in her own classroom and on her own 
ground and if taken unexpectedly, than if formally sum- 
moned to the principal’s office, at a fixed hour, to receive 
what she will probably interpret to be a criticism of her 
work. 
Where the case is one of long standing and serious, or 
where the teacher has habitually shown a rebellious atti- 
tude, and where the purpose is more the assertion of author- 
ity or the imparting of some straight advice or admonition, 
the principal may desire to call the teacher to his office and 
have the conference on his own ground. There is a certain 
psychological advantage in being in one’s own room and on   
 
-P-A-G-E-468
  452 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
home ground that ordinarily the principal should allow to 
his teachers, but which in certain cases he may be allowed to 
capitalize for himself. 
Keeping the criticism constructive. The most effective 
method to use in conferences with teachers will vary with 
the conditions, the purpose, and the matter under discus- 
sion, but the principal should not deviate from:a construc- 
tive and friendly attitude, and a polite but frank considera- | 
tion of the problem. No phase of the principal’s work calls 
for such professional grasp as do these conferences with his 
teachers. He must be sure of himself and of the reasons. — 
founded on sound educational theory and practice — for his 
point of view. A principal who does not know as much 
about teaching as his teachers cannot be very helpful in sug- 
gestions to them, nor is he likely to find himself on safe 
ground in attempting to improve their instruction. He 
must not only know that a particular recitation or piece of 
work was good or bad, but also why it was good or bad, and 
he must be able to defend his point of view and to offer con- 
crete suggestions or materials for improving it when not 
satisfactory. It will always be the force of sound educa- 
tional reasons, rather than personal authority, that will 
make criticisms or suggestions helpful and effective with 
teachers. 
Even favorable comment on a teaching exercise should be 
sufficiently discriminating to enable the teacher to recognize 
the particular factors that made it a good exercise, and thus 
capitalize them in future work of a similar nature. For ex- 
ample, instead of merely telling a teacher that a particular 
class exercise was good, it will be much more helpful to tell 
her also that the particular things that made it good were 
the skillful questioning that brought out clearly the central 
thought of the lesson, and the alert attitude of the class. It 
vill be still more helpful to tell her that the skillful question-
-P-A-G-E-469
  
PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 453 
ing and the alert attitude of the pupils were the results of 
her own good preparation for the lesson, which enabled her 
to do the skillful questioning and to lead up to the cen- 
tral thought of the lesson in the very definite and logical 
and clear-cut way in which she did. A suggestion as to 
how to apply the idea to some phase of her work. not so 
successful may also possibly be in place and be appre- 
ciated. 
Conversely, merely to tell a teacher that a lesson in arith- 
metic, for example, was not successful or satisfactory, with 
no analysis of its defects and no constructive suggestions 
for making it better, is likely to still further weaken the 
teacher by robbing her of the little self-confidence she had. 
She doubtless has done the best she knew how to do, and if 
she is to do better work she needs to have shown to her — in 
all kindliness of manner — a better way. This, out of his 
larger experience and broader reading, it is the business of 
the principal to give. To tell her, on the other hand, that 
the reason the lesson was not successful was because she did 
not make her explanations clear, that this in turn was be- 
cause she taught by a method too mature for the group, and 
that the remedy lies in simpler procedure and more concrete 
application, such as (illustrating), is to make her feel that 
the criticism was just and to look ahead with confidence to 
an improvement of her classroom methods. To say that, if 
she would like to have you do so, you will come in again to- 
morrow and teach the class for her, to illustrate what you 
mean, thus throwing yourself open to her criticism in turn, 
will inspire still more confidence. 
Under such discriminating and constructive criticism 
teachers tend constantly to increase their ability in self- 
criticism, and to become more independent in correcting the 
mistakes in their own teaching procedure. This is not only 
a fundamental requisite for personal growth in teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
  454 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
power, but it is also one of the best evidences of the presence 
of helpful and constructive supervision. 
Supervision should liberate the teacher. An important 
purpose of classroom supervision, in addition to improving 
the teacher’s technique, should be to liberate her and gradu- 
ally free her from set procedure and definite prescriptions. 
Lesson planning, conferences on teaching procedure, demon- 
stration lessons, teachers’ meetings — all should tend to- 
ward freeing the teacher from the necessity of any close con- 
formity to set plans and ways of doing things. In a few 
matters there will naturally still need to be definite prescrip- 
tion, but this is only in so far as may be necessary to secure a 
proper correlation and continuity of the work of the school. 
Otherwise the intent should be to extend liberty of action so 
far as liberty can be shown to be used intelligently, to place 
a premium on sensible originality and initiative, and to in- 
fuse the teaching force with such large conceptions of their 
work and of the aims and purposes of education as will illu-. 
minate procedure and stimulate the development of self-re- 
liance and intelligent individuality. Nothing is more dead- 
ening to the growth of such initiative among teachers, nor 
more likely to result in arrested development, than a rigid, 
restrictive, and mandatory type of supervision. 
On the other hand, this does not mean that teachers are to 
be freed from supervision because they have developed into 
good teachers, nor that the principal can now evade respon- 
sibility for making his school still better on the pretext of 
allowing wide initiative and large freedom to his teachers. 
No one who has caught the true significance of the modern 
liberalizing and democratic movement in education can be- 
lieve that it places any lessened duty on the principal of a 
school in the matter of leadership. Instead, it will call for 
larger leadership and more real ability than did the older 
‘ype of school administration. Under the older type the
-P-A-G-E-471
  PLANNING THE SUPERVISION 455 4 
principal dominated the school and its instruction through ' 
mandatory requirements and the force of his position in the 
administrative organization of the city; under the new he 
must win and hold his place by virtue of his larger insight 
and knowledge and his qualities of leadership. He must 
still be the controlling factor in his school, but in the matter 
of the supervision of the instruction he must change from an 
inspector to an educational Jeader. No teacher really re- 
spects a principal who is an educational fossil, even though 
he makes life easy for her, as well as for himself. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Explain why the different School Surveys so commonly report the ele- 
mentary principalship as a seriously weak point in the school organiza- 
tion. 
2. Assuming a day of selected visitation, based on teacher lesson-plan 
cards (Form 3 type) handed in, and a classroom supervision time 
schedule as given on page 47, make up a day’s visiting program for 
work with grades 5 and 6 from the Platoon-type Class Program given 
in Table VI, pages 178-79. 
8. Fill out Supervisory Visitation Records (Form 5) for Erol lesson- 
wholes seen during the day, planned as in Question 2. 
4. Make out a Classroom Supervision Program (Form 4) for some other 
month and purposes. 
5. This week you are going over the work in geography. You have a new 
teacher in 5B who seems to have little ability in geography teaching, 
though fairly promising otherwise. Yesterday she tried to teach drain- 
age of the watersheds of the United States, but her work was over the 
heads of the children, and her questioning poor. She talked too much 
herself. You indicated her difficulties to her yesterday, at recess, and 
to-day you plan to go back, ask to take the class, start a review, and 
then turn the lesson into a skillful map-exercise to bring out the ideas 
of water-flow, watersheds, drainage basins, slope in relation to flow 
and uses of the river, why swamp lands, city and harbor locations and 
why, and similar information, to be thought out largely by the class 
under quick-fire questioning. Map out a card lesson plan outline 
that you will hand to the teacher as you take the class, that she may 
see what you want her to see and learn. 
6. Suppose you have an older teacher who is hardly average, but who 
considers herself perfect, resents criticism, and will not let you be of 
help to her.. You prefer not to use your authority, but rather to re- 
spect her position and rights and bring to bear a slowly cumulative

456 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
pressure that will in time produce either a change in her or a clear-cut 
issue with her. What will you do, and how will you do it? 
7. Suppose, in visiting an arithmetic lesson, in the addition of fractions, 
the teacher first reads off a problem which each pupil copies and then 
proceeds to solve. After a proper time the teacher asks those who are 
through to hold up their hands, some one pupil to read his answer, and 
the class agree that this is right or wrong. The teacher then repeats 
the process, to the end of the period. Some hands are never up, and a 
few do most of the answering. 
Write out a Supervisory Visit Record (Form 5) for this visit, and 
state what you would do afterward, and how you would do it. 
8. Draw up a year’s Supervisory Program for classroom and subject- 
matter supervision (main outlines only), by months, October to May 
inclusive, but with this main idea in mind: — Your teachers are weak 
in teaching technique, and you would like to have them read some of 
Strayer’s Brief Course in the Teaching Process. If you asked them to 
do this as reading circle work for discussion in building teachers’ meet- 
ings they would object, and do it only perfunctorily. Instead, you 
plan out’ a year’s supervision of subject-matter instruction so that, 
week by week, you state, as a Supplemental Objective, one or more of 
the important phases of teaching technique as outlined in this book: 
Always cite the book and chapter under the “Interesting Readings,” 
and always bring in the ideas of the chapter in the following teachers’ 
meeting.

CHAPTER XXIII 
HELPING THE TEACHER 
Types of teachers. Any principal, on taking charge of a 
school,will find that the teaching force he inherits probably 
will represent:a number of different types in training and ex- 
perience and teaching power, and that several different 
kinds of human nature will also be in evidence. This he 
must expect, and he must learn to get along with the situa- 
tion. , Taking things as he finds them, it will be the problem 
of the principal to do the best possible for all his teachers, 
dealing with them as individuals rather than as a group, 
and remembering that in working to improve his teachers 
in instruction and management he is working primarily in 
the interests of the children in his school. 
Except in cities where the best of standards for the selec- 
tion of teachers have long prevailed, the principal will be 
fortunate if he finds a teaching force twenty-five per cent of 
which are really superior teachers — teachers who are well 
trained, ambitious and capable, who know what to do and 
why and how, and who will need but little help from a prin- 
cipal other than inspiration to do still better work. He will 
also be fortunate if not more than twenty-five per cent of 
his teachers are not either. beginners who’ probably will 
need much help, or older teachers who have become set in 
partially wrong ways and are in consequence somewhat in- 
effective. Some of the older ones will be willing to do bet- 
ter work, if shown a better way; some, on the contrary, 
will be so set that they will be unwilling to change their ways 
or to make any effort at improvement. Something like fifty 
per cent of his force he may expect to belong to the fair- 
average type of teachers — teachers who do fairly satisfac-
-P-A-G-E-476
  460 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
tory work, but who do not rise to any large conception of 
the possibilities of their work or attain to any high degree 
of teaching skill. Though standards as to training are con- 
stantly improving, the bulk of the teaching in our schools 
will still for some time probably have to be done by this fair- 
average type of teacher. Many of this type can be changed 
by helpful advice and education into better teachers; a 
few will not improve much even though they may seem 
to try. 
It is with such types of teachers that a principal will have 
to work, and working through them do his work. He can 
do much to help them and make their work more attractive 
to them, though it will not be wholly by classroom supervi- 
sion that he will accomplish the results he desires. The hu- 
man factor will count for much. His interest in his prob- 
lems, his energy and zeal for his work, his orderly habits, his 
businesslike attitude, his sense of humor, his appreciation of 
the human side of life, his understanding and sympathy, his 
kindliness and courtesy, his own desire for growth, his work- 
ing philosophy of the educational process, his practical 
knowledge, and his ability to lead without driving — all will 
be important factors in moulding his teachers, in improving 
their methods, and in inspiring them with a larger vision 
of the importance of the work they do. 
Types of service. The superior type of teacher the prin- 
cipal can both: help and be helped by. The kind of help this 
type will need will be different from that needed by the other 
types. In handling children and in teaching technique they 
may be superior to the principal, and the lessons they teach 
probably will not need to be discussed at all. Many will be 
carried along by their own ideals of excellence, but all of 
them can be kept at maximum efficiency by evidence of ap- 
preciation of what they do, as well as by a form of profes- 
sional helpfulness which consists largely of suggesting to
-P-A-G-E-477
  HELPING THE TEACHER 461 
them possibilities of further achievement of which they had 
not been aware. On the other hand, superior teachers 
strengthen the principal by showing him new standards for 
accomplishment, new technique that he can use, and by 
their stabilizing influence with the other teachers if they 
come to have confidence in the principal’s leadership. Of 
all the teachers in a building, the aid and support of the 
most capable group is the backing most worth having. To 
win and hold this calls for a high degree of competence. 
To the improvement in instruction and management of 
the other types of teachers the principal will need to give a 
varying amount of time and attention, and in doing so may 
need to employ a number of different supervisory devices. 
Of these devices some will be of more service in one school 
than in another. 
The teachers most in need of help, and the ones who will 
profit most by the help given and usually be the most appre- 
ciative of it, are the beginning teachers. It is important 
that these be started right, and for these the principal 
should make his school a form of normal school. Each be- 
ginner, potentially, has the making of a superior. teacher, 
but if neglected and allowed to struggle along may soon lose 
all professional enthusiasm and become confirmed in faulty 
procedure and teaching mistakes. It is easier and better to 
take these beginners and make good teachers of them, if this 
can be done, than it is to drop them and start over again. 
The fair-average type of teacher also needs that constant 
stimulus to professional activity which a professionally alive 
and interested principal can give. The purpose is to change 
wrong ways of doing things, to eliminate mistakes in man- 
agement and method that lead to a low grade of accomplish- 
ment and to discouragement, to awaken new professional in- 
terest, and to cause teachers of this type to catch a new vi- 
sion of service and because of it to rise above mediocrity.
-P-A-G-E-478
462 - THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Often this type of teacher will do sufficiently well from year 
to year to warrant retention, yet without working or devel- 
oping as she should. 
It is these fair-average teachers who present a real prob- 
lem to the principal. Yet so many cases are known in 
which a new principal, coming into a school, has taken a 
professionally dead teaching force and fired it with new life; 
we have so many instances of single schools, in cities that 
are professionally dead, being made centers of professional 
activity by a principal; and so great is the enthusiasm 
and optimism of women teachers when it comes to service 
for children that a principal possessed of the right type of 
personality and knowledge can be almost sure of success. A ~ 
man or woman who knows what to do, and who has energy 
and imagination and fire can almost on a certainty count on 
succeeding if given a relatively free hand. The first meet- 
ing of such a principal and a body of teachers often gives the 
teachers a new sense of power, and they leave the room with 
a feeling of certainty that they will all be distinctly alive be- 
fore he is through with them. Under the stimulus of leader- 
ship of this type a body of teachers responds and grows by 
leaps and bounds. 
In helping teachers to ah a number of supervisory 
devices have been found useful, and these will be briefly 
mentioned here. ’ 
The beginning teacher. A principal often fails to appre- 
ciate the difficulties that a beginning teacher has to en- 
counter. Often inadequately trained, timid, shrinking from 
assuming new responsibilities, unconscious of errors made, 
unable to diagnose a situation and apply a remedy when 
things go wrong — the beginning teacher is often in deep 
water before the principal realizes it. Even when a normal 
school graduate and possessed of a modern viewpoint, the 
beginner usually finds actual schoolroom conditions quite
-P-A-G-E-479
  HELPING THE TEACHER : 468 
different from the small teaching groups and the close super- 
vision of the training school. Both these types of beginners 
need oversight and attention. It is best that the principal 
should not assume the management of the room for her, ex- 
cept in extreme cases, for it is important that she learn 
quickly how to do for herself. To this end she should not at 
first be given much line or yard work or other types of 
duties that may lead to disciplinary difficulties, and for 
the first month or two she should be watched rather care- 
fully and started right. To feel sure that there is a sym- 
pathetic principal who will respond with helpful suggestions 
during the learning period is a great help to such a teacher in 
establishing herself and learning to control the situation. 
The young teacher usually runs into her first trouble with 
discipline. Not able as yet to teach effectively, her class 
gets away from her. The principal’s work will be, not to 
do the disciplining for her unless things are serious, but to 
diagnose her difficulties, to tell her where and why the meth- 
ods she uses fail, to point out what better’ methods she 
ought to employ, to keep her courage up, by showing confi- 
dence in her ability to pull through ultimately, and by pro- 
tecting her from all possible annoyances that may tend to 
impair her working efficiency. Many a beginning teacher 
fails here, is not given the help and support a principal 
should give her, loses self-confidence, becomes discouraged, 
goes from bad to worse, drags through the year, spoils a 
class, and is. dropped by the school board at the end of the 
year. $ 
The principal should keep every beginning teacher under 
observation, and be quick to detect and ward off trouble be- 
fore it becomes serious. It is wise to have it definitely un- 
derstood by every new teacher, at the beginning of her 
teaching in your school, that you expect to keep a close eye on 
her work and to help her all you can, and that you hope she
-P-A-G-E-480
  464 * THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
will not become nervous under your observation nor object 
to any suggestions you may see fit to give her. At the first 
sign of trouble diagnose the situation, get at the causes and 
the probable remedies, and then give her the benefit of your 
larger experience and insight. Often the whole trouble will 
lie in that two or three boys can out-guess her, while things 
are new and little of the work has as yet become habitual. 
If she can get a grip on the situation well and good, but if 
she does not do so quickly, ask her to let you take her class 
and show her how you would handle it. To see how easily 
you squelch a disturbing youngster and to note your meth- 
ods may be worth much more than any verbal instructions 
you could give her. Often a little reading on school manage- 
ment, a booklet on “does and don’ts,” an article on how to 
handle an unruly room, or a book that will give her a better 
understanding of boys, may help her quickly. 
Building up the beginner in teaching skill. As most dis- 
ciplinary troubles have. their origin in poor teaching, the 
best line of ‘remedial treatment lies in building up the 
teacher in teaching power. Some simple book on teaching 
technique may be very helpful to her. Her trouble may lie 
in defective questioning, in talking too much and working 
the pupils too little, in giving her attention to but a few of 
the class, to an unfavorable voice and manner, in not being 
rapid and expeditious in her work, in poor assignments for 
work, or in other directions. Teachers who ultimately fail 
because of such faults may very properly ask of the princi- 
pal, “ Why did you not tell me?”; and the superintendent of 
schools may properly ask the same question of the principal. 
Here is the place for the principal to show his large skill in 
educational diagnosis and in suggestions for remedial proce- 
dure. He ought to correct mistakes from the first, and build 
up the teacher in teaching power as rapidly as_ possible. 
The first year a new teacher. may require much help, but  
-P-A-G-E-481
  HELPING THE TEACHER 465 
after a couple of years she ought to be able to care for herself 
inthe main. While it usually takes five or six years to make 
a really good teacher out of a promising beginner, after the 
second year materially less guidance will be needed. 
An important service by the principal during this early 
building-up process will be to keep the teacher from becom- 
ing discouraged. Most young teachers have been more or 
less impressed by stories of “born teachers,”’ and technical 
skill seems so easy and natural to the expert and so hard for 
them to acquire, that many are depressed by their difficul- 
ties. A little wholesome encouragement along with advice 
as to better procedure, and some sound information as to 
how largely teaching must be learned, will often do much to 
keep up the spirits and courage of a beginning teacher. 
Occasionally, on the other hand, the principal may draw 
a beginner who is very’sure that she, or he, is right, and that 
the results obtained are much better than the principal 
thinks. This attitude is especially likely to be the case if 
the beginner is a man teacher in one of the upper grades, and 
still more likely if he is a normal school or college graduate. 
Such a case may call for some patience and much argument 
and education. Sometimes an arranged visit to another 
teacher may be helpful, sometimes reading can be suggested 
that will let in the light, sometimes a cock-sure individual 
learns best by permitting him, or her, to ride to a fall. If 
the principal bases his suggestions on sound educational 
principles he can usually afford to give these ‘“‘heady”’ per- 
sons quite a large amount of rope, sure they will tangle 
themselves up in it in time. If the success of the school 
work is imperiled he may need to assert his authority, 
quietly but firmly, confident that he will be upheld in so 
doing if the teacher can be shown to be in the wrong and 
impervious to suggestions and advice. 
The group conference. A principal can do much, for se-  
-P-A-G-E-482
  466 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
lected teachers in need of certain types of help, by organiz- 
ing group conferences with those having the same type of 
difficulties or in need of the same kind of assistance. The 
groups may be quite flexible, and may change much in per- 
sonnel and character. They are in effect short teachers’ 
meetings, held with selected groups of teachers for some spe- 
cial purpose, and to consider matters that should not come 
before a general teachers’ meeting of the school. Where the 
principal is a supervising principal, in charge of the supervi- 
sion of a small group of schools, such group conferences can 
be arranged with greater advantage than where the princi- 
pal has but one small group of teachers under him. 
Such conferences probably will be most successful when 
they seem to have arisen somewhat spontaneously out of 
the needs of the teachers. Sometimes conditions can be so 
shaped that the teachers will be brought to ask for them; 
sometimes they can owe their origin to an offer by the prin- 
cipal to give some definite form of assistance. In these con- 
ferences real constructive help must be presented, and the 
principal must be sure to be ready to afford it. Fault- 
finding conferences will accomplish nothing. They must be 
constructive, must analyze conditions and difficulties for 
the teachers, ought to be based on needs that have been ob- 
served or felt, and should either point out better ways or 
lead to sound hard thinking about teaching procedure. 
Teachers ought to go away from them with a new feeling of 
mastery over their difficulties. 
The following are suggested as types of possible special- 
group conferences for groups of new teachers, and possibly 
some of the older teachers who may be in need of similar 
help. 
1. Special technique in the teaching of: 
a. Primary spelling. 
b. Upper-grade spelling.
-P-A-G-E-483

ce. Primary number work. 
d. Mental arithmetic. 
e. Observational geography. 
f. Poetry in the upper grades. 
. The organization of lesson-wholes and plans. 
. Useful teaching devices. 
. The development type of lesson and its place. 
. The drill lesson and its use. 2 
. The review lesson and how to use it. 
The appreciation lesson. 
. The assignment of new work. 
. Disciplinary difficulties. 
. Over-teaching by the teacher. SOMNAAH HL e 
Analyzing one of the above, to show something of what 
the principal needs to have in hand for such a conference, we 
will take the first. 
A. Primary spelling. 
1. Psychological processes involved in spelling. 
a. Perception. 
b. Image types (visual, auditory, motor). 
ce. Habit formation. 
2. Application of these principles. 
a. Conditions of presentation, and errors in. 
b. Reproductory visual image desired. 
(a) Written, not oral spelling. 
c. Habituation of the image. 
8. Method in teaching spelling. 
a. Writing and spelling at first coincident. 
b. Steps in teaching phonetic words. 
ce. Steps in teaching non-phonetic words. 
4. Learning new words. 
a. Discover poor spellers early, and diagnose difficulty. 
(a) Correct work rather than speed. 
(b) Habituation to correct forms only remedy. 
b. Teach words in context. 
ec. Teach limited number of fundamental words. 
(a) Use of Ayres’ lists. 
5. Primary spelling don’ts. 
In these conferences the principal will need to assume 
control and to lead, much as would a teacher with a class in
-P-A-G-E-484
  468 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
a normal school. Some magazine articles or chapters in 
available books that may be read should be suggested, by 
way of follow-up work. Another form of follow-up work 
that is good is to enumerate various classroom applications 
that may be employed, and in the visitation watch to see if 
these are used. Occasionally some short and very pertinent 
book may be read by all, and later used as a basis for a fur- 
ther conference. Some suggestions along this line would be: 
Betts, G.H. The Recitation. 116 pp. 
Haliburton and Smith. Teaching Poetry in the Grades. 166 pp. 
Hartwell, E. C. The Teaching of History. 67 pp. 
Horne, H. H. The Teacher as Artist. 57 pp. 
Suzzallo, H. The Teaching of Spelling. 128 pp. 
Wilson, H. B. Training Pupils to Study. 70 pp. 
Demonstration teaching. While the theoretical presen- 
tation of a problem and its solution has its place, the practi- 
cal demonstration also has its function. It is surprising, af- 
ter all, how much we learn by imitation. A demonstration 
lesson often teaches what it is desired should be taught bet- 
ter than any other plan could do. In taking charge of a 
class to do demonstration teaching the principal should be 
sure that he is prepared to do well what he attempts, so that 
it may be a real demonstration lesson, and he should explain 
the main points in his procedure in the light of sound educa- 
tional theory. In taking charge of a class it is a good idea 
for the principal to work the class rather hard, that they 
may not think that the teacher asks too much of them. Af- 
ter the lesson, be glad if the teacher will question you about 
it, as this evidences a healthy interest. If she has criticism 
of your work, welcome that too. Show that you were right 
and why, or admit that you were not. If she is commenda- 
tory, explain to her, if she cannot herself, the educational 
principles: that were applied and which made the lesson 
good. 
 
-P-A-G-E-485
  
HELPING THE TEACHER 469 
Should the system employ a few so-called training-teach- 
ers — older and specially capable teachers, paid a little ex- 
tra for the service, and charged with helping beginners and 
others to become efficient — they can be made particularly 
useful by a principal in helping his teachers to acquire 
needed skill. The primary supervisor is a form of such spe- 
cial service of help. The function of the training teacher is 
to visit, as needed, staying from a quarter to half a day with 
a teacher needing assistance, showing her how to handle her 
work, and then a few days later have this teacher, possibly 
in company with two or three others from other schools, 
visit the training teacher in her own room, for from half to a 
whole day, and see how she does the work with her own 
children. Such demonstration teaching is about the most 
valuable service that can be given new teachers. It has, 
too, the psychological advantage of coming from one of the 
teaching force, and not from a superior, and is in conse- 
quence more effective. The demonstration teaching by the 
primary supervisor, and visiting under her direction or with 
her, can be made very useful in the same way. 
Every principal, in observing the instruction within his 
own school, or in his contact with visiting supervisors, will 
find opportunities for organizing an occasional demonstra- 
tion lesson, to be put on before a part or possibly all of his 
teachers. It may be some particularly strong lesson work 
that he may like to have repeated before a selected confer- 
ence group, or it may be a type of work representing com- 
mon errors in aim or procedure which he finds occurring frem 
grade to grade in his school. In the conference-group type 
it should be a real demonstration lesson, setting before the 
teachers who need it an example of excellent instruction 
which they may see, and upon which they may question as 
they wish. In the second case the lesson may also be of this 
same type, if that is what is desired, or it may be of the type
-P-A-G-E-486
  470 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
mentioned above and the purpose of the principal will be to 
throw it open to questioning as to aim, content, and tech- 
nique, with a view to tactfully bringing out in the discussion 
the errors he desires to bring to the attention of his teachers 
as a body. Needful criticism may thus be given without 
making it in any way personal, thus avoiding injured feel- 
ings. 
The demonstration lesson has possibilities that as yet 
have been but little utilized. As one writer puts it, “some 
of the most expert teaching power of our best teachers is go- 
ing to waste as far as imparting this power to others is con- 
cerned.”’ After the lesson, the opportunity for analysis and 
constructive suggestion is very great. It would be well if all 
teachers could occasionally observe the work of a master 
craftsman, and be able to question as to the why and the 
how. 
A visiting day. Many school systems allow teachers two 
or three “visiting days” a year, during which they are re- 
lieved of their room work and may visit other schools in the 
system or in adjacent’ cities. Teachers who are weak are 
’ often sent to visit some stronger teacher doing the same 
type of work. This device is useful now and then, if there 
is some specific purpose in view. Too much of the “visit- 
ing,” though, is haphazard and not of any special value to 
the teacher or the school, being in effect a sort of a day off 
—a day when the teacher “dresses up and goes visiting.” 
If training teachers are employed to help those needing it, 
as has just been described, there will be much less need for 
general visiting days. 
On the other hand, the visiting day can be made useful 
and helpful if the visiting is done under direction, if it is ar- 
ranged for with thought, and if some report on the visiting 
is expected. A superintendent of schools might with ad- 
yantage provide that visiting be arranged for by conference,
-P-A-G-E-487
  
{ ’ HELPING THE TEACHER 471 
that certain definite objectives be kept in mind, and that, at 
least for teachers not as yet in the class of the strong and 
capable, a visiting outline be given the teacher by the princi- 
pal, or by an assistant superintendent or special supervisor, 
indicating the main points she is to observe and be prepared 
to report upon on her return. For example, a teacher in 
need of help in teaching technique might be sent to visit one 
or two teachers who are noted for their skillful procedure, 
and might be given written directions as to what is to be 
looked for, of which the form on page 472 is supposed to be a 
copy. Such directions, of course, would not need to be filled 
out when superior teachers take their visiting day, only the 
permit part being used and the teacher left free to report on 
what she finds is worth while. Sometimes, especially when 
a superior teacher who is a good observer finds some particu- 
larly excellent work, it is a good plan to have a report on it 
made to a general meeting of all the teachers. 
Another form of visiting that is occasionally useful is 
short room-to-room visiting in the same building. Some- 
times, when a teacher is tired and nervous, the principal 
may take the class for a single lesson, often using the time 
to-test the work of the class, and send the teacher to an- 
other room fora half-hour visit, to rest and to see some 
other teacher at work. To see how the teacher next below 
is preparing pupils to enter her grade, or how the teacher 
next above is using previous preparation may be helpful, 
as may also a short visit to some superior teacher doing an 
entirely different type of instructing. 
Special teaching problems. All the suggestions as to de- 
vices so far given have been of the remedial or corrective 
type. The suggestion of special problems to teachers, on 
the contrary, represents a constructive type of device be- 
cause the problem can be made to appeal to the teacher’s 
interest and lead to study that is certain to improve in-

HELPING THE TEACHER 473 
struction. An observing principal has constant opportuni- 
ties for suggesting new ways of doing things that will chal- 
lenge the attention of the teacher. By proposing some sim- 
ple problem to her that will lead her to think more closely as 
to procedure, and to observe results more critically, he is 
quite likely to stimulate her to some activity. To suggest 
as many such teaching problems as teachers can use advan- 
tageously, and to be acquiring new problems, through read- 
ing, is one of the marks of a professionally alert principal. 
Similarly, to be able to use such suggestions is a mark of 
an alert teacher. In making his suggestions the principal 
should exercise care that the problems he proposes are very 
definite and concrete, are limited to a small segment of the 
subject, and are perfectly capable of solution by a teacher 
who will think. Large, vague, and general objectives will 
not give the desired results. If a teacher who is not strong 
and capable will not or cannot use the problem suggestions 
a principal gives her, it should be counted as one point 
against her when the principal comes to score her up for the 
information of the superintendent. 
Any one of the possible teacher-conference subjects given 
on pages 466-67 might be subdivided into a number of simple 
problems which could be tested out in one or more rooms. 
Reading, geography, spelling, arithmetic, and English are 
fruitful of problems, and there is plenty of good literature 
oneach. A principal, as he reads, ought to compile a card 
catalogue of simple teaching problems, with references to 
simple and easily obtained reading. A few such teaching 
problems, by way of illustration, may be mentioned here: 
1. Locate any persistent errors made by pupils in different 
school subjects, and find out, if possible, why they make them. 
2. Locate your bad spellers, diagnose their difficulties, and sug- 
gest remedial instruction for each pupil. 
8. Locate the common errors made in composition, by type and 
by pupils, and plan a remedial procedure.
-P-A-G-E-490
  474 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
4. Organize your composition teaching to secure greater effective- 
ness and less after-school paper work. 
5. What is the best use of illustrative material with intermediate 
geography work? 
6. How best eradicate persistent errors in English? 
%. Diagnose the difficulties of your poor readers, and see if the 
analysis of causes will not offer suggestions for improvement. 
8. If intelligent thought-getting in reading requires careful at- 
tention to punctuation, how can we reverse the process and get 
proper punctuation in composition work by attention to ex- 
pression of the meaning? 
A teaching problem illustrated. To illustrate the type of 
solution that might be arrived at, let us take the first prob- 
lem and cite an actual case reported to the writer by a prin- 
cipal. In a 3A class a little girl, apparently rather bright, 
could do little in arithmetic. Her reports were always poor. 
When asked about her, the teacher replied that ‘‘ Marie just 
is n’t able to learn arithmetic.” The principal, in looking 
over her written work, discovered that her trouble was due 
to Marie making a constant error because of having learned 
a “carrying” direction wrong. She was very accurate, ac- 
cording to her conception of the multiplying process, but 
was constantly marked wrong by the teacher because she 
was wrong by the books. The following examples from her 
written work will illustrate: 
(1) (2) (3) (4) 468 567 828 4152 
eS ee! aes ar 1589 3228 969 20208 
The principal, seeing that problem (3) was right and the 
others wrong, soon diagnosed the difficulty. She had mis- 
understood carrying; instead of adding the number to be 
carried to the next product after the multiplication, she first 
added the number to be carried to the next number in the 
multiplicand, and then multiplied. By her understanding
-P-A-G-E-491
  
HELPING THE TEACHER 475 
her sums were 100 per cent correct, instead of twenty-five 
per cent, and problem (3) would have shown the same error 
had the product.at any time given a number to carry. To 
train teachers in such diagnostic methods leads rapidly to 
interest in teaching and to improved instruction. It also 
helps pupils to succeed and stimulates their interest and 
confidence. On the other hand, telling pupils that they will 
not pass if they do not improve, that they do not know any- 
thing, and that they do not work, only leads to discourage- 
ment and causes them to stop trying. 
Course of study problems. Another type of special prob- 
lem work, productive of much interest and personal growth, 
is that in which a principal is able to get teachers to work on 
phases of the course of study. This type of problem work, 
with the resulting discussion, is often one of the best means 
for bringing some older teacher to take a new interest in the 
professional side of her work, with a resulting improvement 
in the value of the instruction she gives the children. 
“Where a principal is allowed something of a free hand as to 
modifications and minor changes and omissions, or in the 
determination as to what special groups may do, or where 
the daily contacts of teachers with children are capitalized 
in the formulation of course-of-study requirements and in 
making changes in established procedure, such course-of- 
study discussion by teachers can often be made useful. 
This device for teacher stimulation should not be tried lo- 
cally unless the principal is fairly well established in control 
of his school, and the teachers have come to have a fairly 
clear idea as to his aims and standards and are in sympathy 
with them. When this condition has been brought about 
the teachers may be started on the preparation of special 
syllabi, or a discussion of aims may be started. Often this 
will best grow out of the results of instruction measure- 
ment, described in the following chapter. A consideration
-P-A-G-E-492
476 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
of the work in spelling, of oral arithmetic, or the produc- 
tion of a syllabus for language instruction are types of 
simple work which do not involve any fundamental change 
in the city course of study, and which can be attempted al- 
most anywhere. If the experiences and successes of other 
schools can be brought in, the interest is usually heightened. 
At first the principal will need to keep control of the dis- 
cussion and direct it; later on he may gradually withdraw 
and let committees of the teachers assume control. The 
results accomplished may not be of fundamental impor- 
tance, but the exchange of experiences and ideas, the looking 
up and quoting of authorities, and the weighing of values in 
instruction are often very useful in awakening professional 
interest and in making teachers alive to the problems of 
their work and of the school. There is a training and an in- 
spiration for work that comes from creative activity that 
the passive recipient of the work of others never knows. 
This is not a device that can be used generally and at any 
time, but when possible of use the principal should be alive to _ 
its value. 
Professional reading. While a principal may expect to 
find a few teachers in any school who are not interested in 
improving the quality of their work, he will find that most 
teachers, on the contrary, are hungry for help. Perhaps 
one main reason why teachers do not progress professionally 
"as much as they should, and why some experience an early 
professional death, is that the principals under whom they 
work so often devote almost no effort to keeping their 
teachers professionally alert. The details of administra- 
tion absorb the thought and energy of the principal, and 
office work — always office work — in time produces that 
deadest of school men, the office principal. Such men, in- 
stead of being inspirers of others and instead of their school 
being a professional workshop, produce an institution which
-P-A-G-E-493
  
HELPING THE TEACHER avy 
is lacking in spirit and which mechanically grinds out re- 
sults. The teachers are faithful, diligent, punctual, morally 
upright, and interested in their children, but they lose en- 
thusiasm and professional ambition. 
To keep his teachers professionally alert and his school a 
sort of a continuation professional school ought to be one of 
the highest ambitions of a school principal. To be able to 
stimulate teachers to think, and from thinking to want to 
read, is the clear mark of a professional leader. The princi- 
pal, though, should remember that teachers will get little 
- from reading done from any other motive than a feeling of 
need for it.: To create this need and then lead the way in 
satisfying it is the principal’s work. When the principal 
finds a book that is helpful to him, and which he thinks will 
be helpful to some one of his teachers, he may properly 
bring it to her attention. If it proves to be of general in- 
terest he may pass it around. Particularly important mag- 
azine articles may also be brought to the general attention of 
teachers. The principal, however, must remember that 
teachers do not have the time or the energy to read much, 
and what is suggested should be short, pertinent, and at- 
tractively written. The principal himself must read and 
give his teachers the advantage-of much professional litera- 
ture that he cannot expect them to read. If he can get each 
teacher interested enough to read half a dozen magazine 
articles each year, a couple of good professional books, and 
two or three books giving an insight into child life or indus- 
try or world affairs, he may feel quite well satisfied. 
To this end every principal ought to build up for himself 
a good working library of professional books upon which he 
can draw as needed. The school building ought also to 
have a small professional library of useful and pertinent 
volumes, and the ability further to draw on a central teach- 
ers’ professional library for temporary loans. There should
-P-A-G-E-494
  478 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
also be a few of the best magazines kept regularly at every 
school. As these are seldom furnished by the school de- 
partment, a school ought to establish a magazine club and 
provide them itself. One way is for each teacher to give an 
equal amount; another is for each teacher to subscribe for 
some one professional or general magazine and deposit it at 
the building. It is best to let a committee of the teachers 
handle this, determine the magazines, and arrange the rules. 
The principal can well afford to put in two or three maga- 
zines himself. 
Often some professional book that bears on classroom - 
work can be adopted for reading and discussion. If this 
seems to be a desirable thing to do, it can be made very val- 
uable. While the principal should prepare carefully on the 
work and be ready to keep the discussion alive and vital, it 
is best to appoint some one teacher to open the discussion 
each time. If chapters can be assigned so that teachers 
who are likely to be most helped by some particular chapter 
can be selected to lead, much good educational work can be 
accomplished without seeming intent. 
Discovering special ability. Another type of device, 
sometimes used very effectively by principals, consists in 
studying teachers who are not doing their best work to 
see wherein they show signs of interest or ability, and then 
striving to develop that special interest or ability. A prin- 
cipal who is constantly finding his teachers able to do more 
than they had themselves thought possible, and who stimu- 
lates them by acknowledging their good work, is a type of 
leader most teachers will be willing to follow. Sometimes a 
fair-average or indifferent teacher, when thus encouraged 
and placed in a new type of situation, turns into an inter- 
ested and good teacher. Often this is one of the best de- 
vices to use with older teachers who need, more than any- 
thing else, a change of work to wake them up.
-P-A-G-E-495
  HELPING THE TEACHER 479 
Sometimes a grade teacher can be changed to a depart- 
mental type of work, or vice versa. Sometimes special 
ability in some one subject or type of work can be empha- 
sized. Sometimes a teacher has been too long in one grade 
of work and would be improved by achange. Sometimes to 
allow a teacher to progress upward with her class, for a year 
or two, may develop new interest. Sometimes a change to 
another school may be a wise thing to suggest. 
Training in working habits. Often teachers can be very 
much helped by a principal who gradually trains them in 
better working habits. To show a teacher how to do a 
thing more expeditiously is a service of value. The princi- 
pal ought to have some of the characteristics of an efficiency 
engineer. If he has he can often show his teachers how to 
save time, how to get work done more effectively, how to 
concentrate on the essentials, how to organize and simplify 
the mechanics of their ¢lassroom procedure, how to mech- 
anize their routine work, and how to cut down time spent 
on written work. Teach them that it is not necessary to 
correct and hand back all written work; that written work 
for the office does not need to be copied again for excessive 
neatness; that they must develop a time sense and a sense of 
proportion; and that it is important to save time for recrea- 
tion and personal growth. ‘ 
Conserve, also, the teachers’ nervous energy as much as 
possible. Limit routine work, reports, statistical informa- 
tion, lesson plans, and records as much as the proper prog- 
ress of the school will permit. Relieve them too, whenever 
possible, of the strain of adjusting difficulties with irate 
parents. One purpose of the presence of the school princi- 
pal is to protect his teachers as much as can be done from 
everything that tends to interfere with their highest effi- 
ciency in instruction, and to promote everything that will 
tend to bring teachers and children together under condi-
-P-A-G-E-496
  480 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
tions most likely to result in good instruction. Any device 
that improves the teacher results in an improvement of her 
school. 
Rating the teachers. Many school systems now require 
principals to rate their teachers, once or twice a year, on in- 
dividual score cards. The teachers are also rated, as is the 
principal, on similar cards by the superintendent, the assist- 
ant superintendents, and by special supervisors, and the 
ratings of all are frequently combined to form a composite 
score card. While these teacher rating cards may vary 
somewhat in form and items used, preparation, personality, 
professional attitude, teaching technique, and results at- 
tained are commonly included. The aim of all has been to 
provide a somewhat objective and practical method by 
means of which teachers may be rated and the efficiency of 
their work determined. One such rating card, on which 
three supervisory officers have rated the same teacher, is 
shown opposite. It will be seen from this that all unite 
in rating this teacher as a good to an excellent teacher. 
Some principals, after making up these cards, give or show 
copies of them to their teachers, as a supervisory device. 
Some principals ask each teacher to rate herself on one of 
these cards and turn it in to him, and some combine the 
teacher’s rating of herself with their own by way of fairness 
to the teacher. 
In making such ratings the principal will be aided in being 
objective himself if he has kept a series of numbered class- 
room supervisory-visit records for each teacher, after some 
such form as is shown in Form 5, page 448. When called 
upon to report on the efficiency of his teachers by the super- 
intendent or the board of education he will then be able to 
base his report, or frame his rating card, from recorded data 
that will largely save him from being charged with personal 
bias and subjective opinion, in case he reports unfavorably

This card shows the rating of a good teacher by three supervisory officers, and is in effect a 
consolidated score. Another plan of using the card would be for each to indicate rating by 
dots, and then to connect the dots by lines, using different colored ink for each rating.

on ateacher. His visitation records will give him accurate 
information as to each classroom exercise seen, the number 
of times he has visited the teacher, the date of each visit, the 
kind of instruction witnessed, and the degree of help he has 
attempted to give each teacher in his school. He will not 
then be in danger of himself being embarrassed, when a 
teacher he recommends for transfer or dismissal turns 
against him and fights, by reason of his having filed such 
highly subjective charges against her as the following, taken 
from the records of charges in one of our American cities. 
She is not a good teacher. She does not do as I tell her to do, and 
does not get results. She does not get along well She will not 
follow directions. My judgment is that the school would be im- 
proved if she were sent elsewhere, or dropped. 
A well-organized rating card, one which focuses attention on 
important objective data, and by means of which the princi- 
pal’s judgment will be compared with that of other supervi- 
sory officers, is a good form of record for the principal to 
make and keep. 
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Compare the classification of types of teachers given on page 459 with 
that given by Superintendent Van Sickle (Proceedings of National 
Education Association, 1911, p. 437, or Cubberley’s Public School Ad- 
ministration, p. 232). Does Van Sickle’s classification set off the work 
of supervision more clearly? 
2. State the fundamental purposes in the supervision of instruction by a 
principal. 
8. Make an outline for conducting a group conference with three new 
teachers in grades two and three on mental arithmetic, or on the drill 
lesson and its use. 
4, Plan a demonstration lesson outline either on some topic in observa- 
tional geography (4th grade), or on the teaching of Longfellow’s poem 
“The Day is Done” (5th grade). 
5. Make out a Visiting-Day Directions (Form 6 type) for a fifth grade 
teacher of two or three years’ experience, but who lacks good working 
habits and is weak in lesson assignment and discipline. 
6. A good capable older teacher asks for a visiting day, to which she is en-
-P-A-G-E-499
  HELPING THE TEACHER 483 
titled. What kind of a form would you fill out for her, if any? What 
type of report would you expect? 
7. Propose three additional simple teaching problems, similar in type to 
those on page 473. 
8. Can you suggest another illustration of the diagnosis of a pupil- 
difficulty? 
9. What magazines would you suggest that a building group provide? 
10. Suggest three books that would be good for general teacher reading 
and discussion, and state on what basis you selected each book. 
11. On the Form 7 chart score up, by a series of dots connected by a 
pencil line, a “‘does-enough-to-get-by” type of teacher — one who 
does fair average work rather by reason of a strong executive person- 
ality and a pleasant manner than because of professional interest or 
preparation, and who is weak in teaching technique. 
12. What changes or additions would you propose in the cea che rating 
card given?

CHAPTER XXIV 
MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 
New scientific tools. There is another type of objective 
data, more important than any we have so far considered, 
which will be of very positive help to a principal in deter-- 
mining the efficiency of the instruction in his school and of 
each teacher in it, and of which he should not fail to avail 
himself. This is the type of data given by the use of the re- 
cently evolved standard tests and measures for determining 
the efficiency of the instruction given. Up to the present 
time some three hundred of these tests have been evolved 
and more or less standardized, and more are in process of 
construction. Of this number at least twenty-five to thirty 
are of enough importance for the work of the elementary 
school that the principal should be thoroughly familiar with 
them, and know how to give them and score and interpret 
the results. . 
The use of these tests enables the principal to substitute 
measurable and standardized results for personal opinion, 
and provides him with a series of clear and incontestable 
records of the achievement of the pupils and teachers in his 
school. They give him a scientific and objective basis upon 
which to build his supervisory procedure and defend what 
he proposes to do. As an instrument of supervision they 
are indispensable. Of course, testing can never displace 
constructive, helpful criticism, but the results furnish a ra- 
tional basis for such criticism without which the best of su- 
pervision is relatively ineffective. So important is this new 
method in education that a principal can no longer be con- 
sidered prepared for his work unless he is familiar with the
-P-A-G-E-502
486 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
use of the standard tests and measures and with simple 
statistical procedure. 
Uses of these new tools. From an examination of the 
statistical array or the charted results of such measurements, 
a principal can tell, almost at a glance, whether pupils or 
rooms are making proper progress; when any working- 
group has made all desirable progress and should advance; 
how well a working-group is suited to continue working to- 
. gether; whether instruction is being directed to what are the 
weak points; where teachers who are carrying a heavy load 
or need help are located, as well as in what particulars they 
need help; in what rooms the load and the teacher are not 
properly adjusted; and whether the teacher is getting out of 
the pupils as much as they are capable of doing. 
In diagnosing pupil and teacher difficulties, in planning 
remedial procedure, in the classification and promotion of 
pupils, and in evaluating the efficiency of the instruction, the 
standard tests and measures are off large value to the princi- 
pal in the supervision of the instruction in his school.) No 
single tool developed within the past quarter-century has 
meant so much for the scientific organization and progress 
of school work as has the introduction of intelligence and 
educational measurements. Still more, no addition to our 
procedure has done so much to change the emphasis, in the 
work of the school principal, from the duties of organization 
and administration to those relating to the supervision of 
instruction. The coming of standardized tests has changed 
the character of the service principals must render, and the 
character of the preparation they need for the work they are 
todo. Their use has now become a matter of routine super- 
visory procedure in determining and evaluating the results 
of instruction in a school. 
The so-called informal tests. The old*type of subject 
examination has long been used to test the efficiency of the
-P-A-G-E-503
MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 487 
instruction in school systems. Often uniform questions, 
based on the subject-matter of the course of study, have 
been formulated at the superintendent’s office and given, at 
stated times, to the school system as a whole, the papers be. 
ing graded and the results tabulated at the central office. 
The purpose has been to determine the efficiency of the in- 
struction in the different schools, though we now know that 
this method was crude and that the results were unreliable. 
Such testing on subject-matter still has its place, where the 
aim is to test the mastery of definite subject-matter content, 
but such-tests are now clearly subordinate to a more scien- 
tific examining procedure. 
The so-called informal school tests, many of which have 
been evolved and published, and which can be worked out 
rather easily by principals and teachers, represent a first 
step away from the old type of examination and in the di- 
rection of a more scientific procedure. They have been 
called “‘scientific tests in the making,” though but few of 
them will ever be perfected and standardized. Such is not 
the intention in constructing them. They are, however, 
patterned after the standardized tests, and are so con- 
structed that the method of giving and scoring them is ap- 
proximately the same as for the standard tests. The object 
in preparing them is to secure an accurate objective measure 
of the achievement of the pupils in a particular room or 
grade in some one subject or part of a subject. They are 
constructed so that they may be scored objectively, and 
thus avoid the wide divergence in marking of results so 
common on the old type of examination paper. Their 
diagnostic value is somewhat similar to the so-called stand- 
‘ard tests. 
A few selected samples, taken from tests described by 
McCall, will illustrate the nature of three types of these 
tests,

Such tests are based on the instruction outlined in the 
course of study or given from the textbooks used; they are 
an attempt to measure objectively the desirable outcomes of 
teaching; they are useful in the diagnosis of errors and in re- 
vealing points that need further emphasis; they can be used 
to direct and motivate the instruction; when prepared by 
the teachers the work is of value to them; they are useful in 
checking up that mastery of facts or ability to think closely 
which the school is trying to emphasize; and they may be 
used to supplement or prepare for the use of the standard 
tests. The ability to score accurately such tests consti- 
tutes one of their main advantages over the older type of 
examination,
-P-A-G-E-505
MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 489 
Use of the standardized tests. The use of the informal 
tests, as has been stated, forms a good preparation for both 
pupils arid teachers for the use of the standardized tests. 
These'tests have the advantage of much more careful prep- 
aration, and they have been used long enough and in a 
large enough number of places to have become standardized 
as to results. For all the older and better tests in the fun- 
damental subjects of the elementary school — arithmetic, 
reading, spelling, handwriting, and language — well-estab- 
lished scores or norms have been built up, so that the ac- 
complishment of any grade in any school can be objectively 
measured and compared with the norm for such grade and 
work done in schools generally. Fairly satisfactory. tests 
also are available for history and geography. The useful- 
ness of the standardized tests in improving the effectiveness 
of instruction has been so frequently demonstrated that pro- 
gressive teachers and principals to-day use them continu- 
ally to check up and standardize the ordinary schoolroom 
procedure.. The norms provide schools everywhere with 
standards of attainment, based on the performance of tens - 
of thousands of children in schools all over the land. 
The course of study for a school system can at best give 
but general directions as to what teachers are to do, and the 
directions are usually stated in terms of textbooks, subject- 
matter acquirements, or of types of training to be- given. 
Certain definite information is to be imparted — to read, 
write, spell, cipher, think, compose, learn geographical and 
historical facts; certain types of instruction are indicated to 
be used — drill work, reasoning exercises, directed-study 
work, lessons in appreciation; and certain aims are set forth 
as important — civic training, moral education, and health 
habits. These, however, at best are quite general specifica- 
tions, and the same work naturally is indicated to be done 
with and for all pupils. Even when a differentiated-type
-P-A-G-E-506
  490 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
course of study is provided, the same work is indicated for 
each of the groups. Such general aims in the more formal 
drill subjects are insufficient, in that they are not specific 
enough to lead to the type of results desired. The use of 
the standard tests and an interpretation of the scores ob- 
tained call the attention of the teachers to other aspects of 
the work of instruction — the results secured rather than 
the subject-matter covered; the needs of the pupils rather 
than the contents of the textbooks; the needs of individual 
pupils as well as the needs of the class as a whole; and to 
specific items and skills in teaching rather than vague gen- 
eral aims. 
Diagnostic value of the tests illustrated by handwriting. 
One of the chief outcomes from the use of the standard ac. 
complishment tests is the ability, from an examination of 
the scores obtained, to diagnose difficulties and to prescribe 
remedial procedure. For example, the results of a hand- 
inly tare Owe

The general quality of this 6B specimen is about average for the grade, but when ana- lyzed into its elements the lines for future instruction are revealed. In size the letters are a little small; the letter formation is fair to good, but needs attention; the spacing throughout is good; the alignment of letters is fair, and of lines poor; the slant is variable and only fair; and the quality of the line is poor. 
writing test may reveal undue perfection with too little 
speed, or too much speed coupled with low legibility. In 
either case the specimens can be analyzed as to size, letter 
form, spacing of letters and words and lines, alignment, 
slant, and quality of line, and individual remedial treatment

can be indicated. This is well illustrated in the specimen of 
6B handwriting reproduced in Figure 25 opposite, with the 
needed type of future instruction indicated beneath. Such 
intelligent diagnosis leads to handwriting instruction that is 
far superior to “‘just writing.”

Three entirely different spelling situations are here shown. 
words, may indicate much as to ability and needs of classes 
and pupils. The class averages may differ much, due to dif- 
ferent types of situations. We may find a low class aver- 
age, caused by a general low average of all or by the very 
low score of afew. Again, we may find good average condi- 
tions, the class as a whole doing good average work. Or we 
may find a class average much above the standard or norm, 
and that quite a number of the pupils (those spelling all the 
words of the test) were not tested at all. Figure 26, given 
above, reveals three such conditions in three fifth-grade 
classes, composed of different types of working groups. 
Taking one of the three type situations there shown and 
analyzing it by individuals gives us Figure 27. This at once 
locates the poor and the good spellers of this group, as shown 
by the test. The next step is to diagnose the types of errors 
made by the individual pupils, and then to prescribe reme- 
dial procedure for the ones most in need of help. (See Form 
8, page 493.) A fourth of this class, at least, probably needs

Each of the pupils listed as to words spelled cor- rectly on the Fig. 26 Spelling Test. Figure 26 would indi- 
cate the need of some- 
what different types of 
spelling instruction for 
the three classes. The 
C-course class needs 
primary methods — 
visualizing, pronounc- 
ing, and written work; 
the A-course class can 
dispense with this type 
of instruction entirely, 
shorten the spelling 
time, and do oral work. 
The B-course class 
may do best with a 
combination of both 
types of work. 
Diagnostic value il- 
lustrated by reading. 
A reading test, simi- 
larly, may reveal vary- 
ing conditions. A class 
may do very good oral 
reading, and yet be 
doing very little thought-getting. The pronunciation may 
be good, but the comprehension may be low. Again, both 
rate and comprehension in both oral and silent reading 
may be low or high. Still further there may be wide vari- 
ations between different pupils in the same working group.

grade class in silent reading, with the diagnosis. The score

The standard tests are also of use in revealing objectively 
to teachers and principals not only the status of an individ- 
ual or a class at any particular time. the degree of 
progress made by a pupil or a class ge period of 
time.) This use of the standard tests is well shown by Figure

29, which gives the status of a sixth-grade class in Septem- 
ber, in the matter of both speed and accuracy in the four 
fundamental operations in arithmetic, and the results of 
seven months’ work with this class by the teacher. By 
means of the tests the teacher knew definitely that the class 
entering her room in September was deficient, the amount 
they were below the grade norm, and the amount they ought 
to gain. In April, use of the same test revealed that the 
teacher had more than brought up the class. 
What achievement tests do not reveal. While the stand- 
ard tests that test accomplishment in studies (achievement 
tests) do have, as indicated, large diagnostic value, there are 
many times when they fail to tell the whole story. Jenkins 
has recently described a good case in point. In a large 
school in an Italian quarter of a large city, of which he was 
principal, the Monroe Standardized Reading Tests, Forms 
1 and 2, were given in the Auttimn to three fourth- and two 
fifth-grade classes. The scores showed all classes, in both 
rate and comprehension, much below the standard scores 
for the test. The teachers were somewhat surprised, as the 
oral reading had been regarded as quite satisfactory. All 
agreed, however, to make every effort to remove the defi- 
ciencies which the test revealed. Special attention was given 
to increasing both rate and comprehension. The work in 
silent reading was carefully motivated, daily drills for in- 
creasing rate were given, emphasis was placed on thought- 
getting, and the over-emphasis on oral reading was changed. 
A test later in the year showed that all grades had made 
good gains except one 5B class of forty-one pupils which 
still stood, despite all the teacher’s labors, on about the 
same level as the 4B class in the same school. The teacher 
was a strong, energetic, and intelligent woman, interested in 
the problem, and bie of doing a high grade of work. 
After examining all the evidence, and the cumulative pupil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-513
  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 497 
record cards, the conclusion was reached that this 5B class 
must be one of a lower mental level than the ‘other classes. 
As Jenkins well says: “This, however, was only an opinion, 
and counted for but little in scientific education.” 
It is here that the intelligence test comes in to supplement 
the educational tests in determining the capacity of the pu- 
pils for learning. This test is an added scientific tool of the 
most fundamental importance in educational diagnosis. In 
view of the principal’s estimate of the teacher, the above 
failure could hardly be attributed to poor instruction. From 
the results obtained from intelligence testing we now know 
that it is not safe to assume that poor teaching is the cause 
of the failure to make proper progress in their school work, 
either of pupils or of classes. Other factors enter into the 
problem which may be listed as follows: 
1. Success may be due to: 
a. Superior intelligence, regardless of the teaching. 
b. Average intelligence and good teaching. 
2. Failure may be due to: 
a. Average intelligence, and poor teaching. 
b. Low intelligence, regardless of the teaching. 
It therefore follows that teachers can hardly be held ac- 
countable for the failure of pupils or classes to make normal 
_ progress until the intelligence level is known. Figure 26 il- 
lustrates well the differences in possibilities for instruction 
of three different classes of fifth-grade pupils, while Figure 
22 shows still more clearly the impossibility of a teacher 
doing even average work with such a class. All our studies 
of pupil intelligence only emphasize the desirability of 
differentiating the instruction for different types of pupils, 
assigning different types of working groups to different 
teachers to handle, and then expecting quite different stand- 
ards of accomplishment from the different groups. 
On applying an intelligence test to the 5B class which
-P-A-G-E-514
498 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
failed to make proper progress in the reading, it was found 
that the average mental age of the class was but eight years, 
eight. months, or two years below normal, and that the 
average intelligence quotient (I.Q.) for the class was but 
74. Grouping the pupils according to mental age the class 
was found to consist of: 
PupPmILs IQ. 
Feeble-minded a Below 60 
Border-line cases “14 60-74 
Dull and slow 10° 15-84 
Normal pupils 10° 85-114. 
A re-study of the achievements of the class, as shown by 
the reading tests, with their low mental age now taken into 
consideration, showed that the teacher had done excellent 
work rather than otherwise, the low mental age and the size 
of the class (41) considered. She had attempted the impos- 
sible, and had done as well as any teacher could have done. 
Importance of the mental age (I.Q.). Such cases as the 
one just described bring forcibly to attention the desirability 
of finding some simple means of relating the two types of 
tests, and of being able to state the educational possibilities 
of a class or a pupil in some mathematical formula which 
will be readily intelligible. This we are now able to do. 
In the beginning, both the accomplishment tests and the 
intelligence tests were developed separately, and for a time 
no attempt was made to establish any direct relationship be- 
tween them. As the close relation of intelligence to school 
accomplishment was perceived, an effort was made to relate 
the two so as to be able to interpret achievement test scores 
in terms of mental rather than of chronological age. Stated 
another way, it was felt that the mental age, rather than the 
chronological age, should be taken as the basis of what a pu- 
pil should be able to do, whereas the school has in the past
-P-A-G-E-515
  MEASURING. THE INSTRUCTION 499 
always based expectations on the chronological age. If the 
pupil’s intelligence is 100, or approximately that, chronolog- 
ical age’is a perfectly proper basis. If, however, the pupil 
has an intelligence quotient (I.Q.)of but 85 per cent of normal, 
or of 115 per cent of normal, the situation is quite different. A 
twelve-year-old pupil with an I.Q. of 85 would be, mentally, 
but ten years and two plus months old, and normally should 
be in 5B grade instead of finishing 6A. Similarly, a twelve- 
year-old pupil with an I.Q. of 115 would be, mentally, thir- 
teen years and nine months old, and ought to be doing 8A 
work. The mental age of a pupil is thus seen to be a better 
basis for the grade classification of pupils than is the chrono- 
logical age, and the giving of a mental test to all school 
pupils, as was pointed out in Chapter XIX, is seen to be a 
desirable routine procedure. 
New achievement norms. Further study, however, -re- 
vealed that even mental age was not wholly dependable as 
a basis for classification, as some children did better school 
work, as measured by the tests, than their mental age would 
indicate, and others did not do so well. This is readily un- 
derstood if we remember that the test norms have been de- 
rived from results with tens of thousands of children, in 
many different cities and in different types of schools. In- 
tered | in the work, perseverance, seriousness of purpose, la- 
: zines, inattentiofi, and good and poor instruction, have all 
comé in as modifying factors. To express a: pupil’s accom- 
plishment in terms of the standard scores for each of the 
tests, arranged as they have been on all kinds of numerical 
scales, would be unintelligible to any one but a professional. 
What was desired then was a simple decimal figure, analo- 
gous to the I.Q., by means of which both the actual educa- 
tional accomplishments of a pupil and his possibilities of 
accomplishment could both be expressed by a figure that 
was based, as is the I.Q., on 100 as normal.
-P-A-G-E-516
500 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
The first step was to develop age-score norms for the dif- 
ferent test norms, so that any score made on a test could be 
at once translated, from prepared tables, from,a test norm 
to an age norm, as, for example: 
Test score 4.36=10 years, 0 months age-score “ 474=10 “ 6 “ « 
fer ee 5.86=11 “ o « « “ 
«es 6 613=11 “ 6 « “ “ 
The next step was to develop a “battery of tests,” of both 
intelligence and accomplishment, which when combined 
would give a measure of the pupil’s educational achieve- 
ment. This has been done in “The Illinois Examination.” 
Other somewhat similar combinations of tests have been 
formed for a similar purpose, and described, one of the 
latest being the new “Stanford Achievement Tests,” de- 
vised by Kelley, Ruch, and Terman. 
’ As a result of the studies which have been made we now 
have three indices of good reliability, by means of which we 
may now express the educational possibilities and determine 
the educational accomplishments of a pupil or a class, as 
well as the skill in instruction of the teacher teaching the 
class. The first of these is the Intelligence Quotient (I.Q.), 
by which we mean the percentage a pupil’s mental age is of 
his chronological age. The second is the Educational Quo- 
tient (E.Q.), by which we mean the properly-weighted arith- ~ 
metic mean of the age-scores made by the pupil on the dif- 
ferent tests constituting the “battery”? used. The third is 
the Achievement (or Accomplishment) Quotient (A.Q.), by 
which we mean what the child actually accomplishes, com- 
pared with what his mental age would indicate him as ca- 
pable of accomplishing. 
For example, suppose a boy in a 6A grade is 10 years, 10 
months old, chronologically, but by an intelligence test he is 
found to be 13 years, 0 months old, mentally. His I.Q. then

is 
. and he presumably ought to be at least a year further along. 
On a properly weighted arithmetic mean of the different ac- 
complishment tests used (battery), his work (age-score) is 
found to average up to that of a pupil 11 years, 4 months old.

We now know his educational possibilities, and how hard he 
works. While his Intelligence Quotient (120) shows him to 
be able to de much better work than children of his age, and 
his Educational Quotient (105 + ) shows that he does, his 
Achievement Quotient (89 + ) shows that he is after all 
working to only 
wt 84°4 per cent 
of his capacity to do. If this pupil is well and strong he 
ought to be put ahead in another grade, shifted to a maxi-

accomplishment nearer to his capacity. He is learning to 
loaf at his work in his present place. The A.Q. is the meas- 
ure that tells the real story. 
Importance of the Achievement Quotient. Suppose we 
now apply the above to a concrete case, by going back to the 
C-course fifth-grade class of Figure 26, page 491, whose work 
in spelling was analyzed by individuals in Figure 27, page 
492, and take three cases from each end of the Figure 27 
display and three from the middle, and list them in a table 
which may be assumed to represent the scores and the abil- 
ity of each. We then get the following table:

  The last column gives the important item, the A.Q. If 
the nine pupils selected are a fair sample of the whole class, 
it must at once be recognized that a very capable teacher is 
in charge of this C-course class, as she is getting capacity 
work from a class of very ordinary pupils. 
It is evident that the Achievement Quotient is the only 
measure that fully takes into account the actual material 
with which the teacher works. For the teacher of a slow 
and backward class it is the only measure which fairly inter-
-P-A-G-E-519
  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 503 
prets her efforts and accomplishments. An inspection of 
the above table shows at once that the chronological age 
would be no measure, the range for fifth grade (see Table 
VIII, page 341) being 9-9 to 11-3 years. The I.Q.’s would be 
but little more reliable as an index, except that they would 
reveal the character of the group and that Casey, at least, 
ought to be removed to a border-line class. The mean age- 
scores would be better, but even these are not wholly indica- 
tive. The E.Q.’s reveal the possibilities for doing work, and 
the’A.Q.’s tell what percentage of their possibilities for ac- 
complishment the teacher is getting out of them. The low 
scores on the accomplishment test in spelling (Figure 26) 
now appear much better when compared with the capacity 
of the class. The same method applied to the A-course class 
shown in Figure 26, or to any class of bright pupils, might. 
reveal that after all their rapid progress was no special 
credit to the teacher. The A.Q. of this 5A class might all 
be under 100, while the mean age-scores might show that 
the class ought to be doing sixth grade work instead of fifth. 
The principal and educational measurement. In time 
our schools will come to have pupil records which will show, 
for each pupil, his standing and accomplishments at various 
dates, and battery tests will be used to determine periodi- 
cally the progress of the pupils and the efficiency of the in-. 
struction in each class in the school. We may expect be- 
fore long, too, that teachers will be supplied with such in- 
formation regarding each pupil who comes to them to be 
taught, and that they will be expected by supervisory officers 
to get results according to the material they receive with 
which to work. A class of low intelligence capacity, or a 
class that has been poorly taught for a year or two before, 
will have such facts revealed on the records, while teachers 
who receive alert and well-taught classes will be expected to 
keep them up in accomplishment,
-P-A-G-E-520
  504 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
This new type of supervisory work will call for an entirely 
new type of preparation on the part of the principal, and 
somewhat on the part of the teachers. It will also call for 
the addition of an entirely new type of classroom super- 
vision from that which principals have heretofore given. ~ 
Just at present cities are trying to do this new work by creat- 
ing “‘Efficiency Departments” and “Bureaus of Research,” 
but the work is too large and too important to be handled 
long by such centralized methods, and soon we may expect 
that.principals will be called upon to be familiar with educa- 
tional and intelligence tests and statistical procedure, know 
how to give such tests and score the results, know how to 
interpret the scores and diagnose from them, and be able 
quickly, from prepared tables, to calculate I.Q.’s, E.Q.’s, and 
.A.Q.’s. Teachers, too, may soon be expected to be some- 
what more generally familiar with the nature of a few of the 
more important tests, and also sufficiently acquainted with 
the more important terms used to know their meaning when 
applied to their work. In tests and measures and scores and °- 
quotients and statistical procedure we have new tools of such 
large importance for education that the school will be forced 
to use them. To be able to evaluate the instruction by means . 
of these will become one of the essential tests as to the com- 
petence of both principals and supervisors. 
In time, too, new items will be added to the teacher rating 
sheets (Form 7, page 481) which principals will be asked to 
fill out relating to their teachers, and which will call for rat- 
ings based on the character of the class, and how much the : 
teacher accomplishes considering the material given her. 
With such objective data a principal, against whose rating 
a teacher has appealed, will not feel as now that he has been 
placed on trial and lacks evidence for his defense. _ 
All this new work is far larger and more important than 
the use of new symbols, the accumulation of tables, and'the
-P-A-G-E-521
  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 506 
making of graphs. ‘These are only the means to an end. 
This new work means the introduction of scientific manage- 
ment into the-work of school supervision, and the direction 
of the activities of the school upon the basis of the best pro- 
cedure known. It aims to measure as accurately as possible 
the actual results of teaching, ‘as well as to pass on the meth- 
ods used. Instead of debating whether or not a procédure 
is in accordance with a psychological principle, it goes di- 
rectly at the results of the work with flesh and blood chil- 
dren. While there are, no doubt, intangible values in teach- 
ing, and especially in the personal influence of teachers on 
children which can be measured only in the lives of the pu- 
pils, inaccuracy in procedure because the school is not really 
aware of what needs doing cannot be excused on this ground. 
Most of the influence of a teacher is exerted through means 
which are perfectly tangible and which may be appraised in 
quantitative terms. 
Teachers’ marks and report cards. It may be expected 
that in time the influence of these important new tools may 
extend over to the marking of pupils and to the monthly and 
semi-monthly report card sent home to parents. Anexam- - 
ination of many report cards in use shows that a report is usu- 
ally made on each subject studied, the times tardy and the 
days absent are given, and then some kind of grade is com- 
monly added on some one or more of such items as “ inter- 
est,” “effort,” “attitude toward work,” or “progress.” 
The grading of the work in the school subjects is quite vari- 
able, and often without much of a standard. The personal 
opinion of the teacher or the results of an old-type examina- 
tion form the usual basis for the marks, and not infrequently 
the basis for grading is wholly subjective. Teachers have 
been known to refuse to promote pupils because of poor de- 
portment, or “because they do not deserve it” — that is 
because they had been disagreeable or offensive to the
-P-A-G-E-522
  506 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
teacher or had not studied as hard as the teacher thought 
they should. Such considerations should have nothing to 
do with promotions, and leave the marks charged with sub- 
jective influences of which parents and pupils quite prop- 
erly complain. It is a temperamental rating not supported 
by any objective evidence. 
Even under ordinary grade-school conditions, with a uni- 
form course of study, a principal can gradually introduce 
system and plan into the school marks by examining the 
pupil report cards, preferably at the teacher’s desk in the 
rooms, before they are sent home to the parents. So mean- 
ingless are the reports at times that some principals would 
do away with them entirely, and send no reports home except 
when the pupil is falling behind. The pupil comparison, 
envy, excitement, charges of unfairness, discouragement, 
destruction of the reports, and forging of signatures repre- 
sent the bad side of the monthly report card. Still, parents 
expect them and like to see them, and will blame the school 
when anything is unsatisfactory if they are not notified.’ 
To use the standard test scores, or the translated age- 
scores would be meaningless, as would E.Q., A.Q., or any 
similar technical terms. It is possible, though, that a more 
standardized grading plan may in time be formulated that 
will take into account educational capacity and the ratio of 
actual accomplishment, rather than the comparison of a pu- 
pil’s work with the teacher’s idea of perfection. It will then 
be possible to develop a more scientific procedure in deciding 
upon the usual school marks to be sent home, and also in 
determining what kind of mark to give such desirable gen- 
eral terms as “effort,” “progress,” and ‘‘accomplishment.” 
In formulating such new school grading and report-card 
standards and terms, the new scientific procedure in measur- 
ing instruction will of necessity play an important part. 
Vocational guidance uses. There is another field in 
 
-P-A-G-E-523
  MEASURING THE INSTRUCTION 507 
which the new scientific measures as to intelligence and edu- 
cational capacity are likely to become of increasing impor- 
tance, even in the elementary school, and that is in advising 
young people as to possible life careers. The first main task 
of the elementary school in this direction is to make the 
school so attractive and so vital that pupils will remain in it 
until they have finished its work. There is no work worth 
while out in the world into which uneducated boys and girls 
can go. Only very limited “blind alley” work is open to 
them, and by twenty or soon after they see — then too late 
—the impossibility of getting ahead and amounting to 
much. 
To hold pupils in school long enough to give them some. 
educational equipment for life’s work is a first essential. 
All the labors of a principal and his teachers in looking after 
the school attendance, making the school attractive, im- 
proving the physical welfare of the pupils, exercising good 
control, making the school work vital and strongly motivat- 
ing'it, and in building up a strong school spirit are steps in 
this direction. In the upper grammar grades or junior high 
school years much should be done to bring the pupils, 
through readings, discussions, vocational studies, and op- 
portunities to try one’s hand in vocational work, into some 
real contact with the industrial activity of the community 
about them. The manual and domestic instruction given, 
the visits to industries, the study of trade and transporta- 
tion, and similar work offer good opportunities to set pupils 
to thinking along lines of their possible future life work. 
While all this work of opening up vistas of opportunity is 
important and should not be neglected, nevertheless it must 
be recognized that the degree of intelligence a pupil pos- 
sesses must after all limit his or her possibilities for useful- 
ness in'life. While a low I.Q. will not determine tastes and 
aptitudes or indicate the particular kind of life service in
-P-A-G-E-524
  508 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
which a pupil can best succeed, it will, however, limit the 
level of the type of occupations in which that pupil can profit- 
ably engage. Conversely, the higher the I.Q. the more op- 
portunities there will be open to a boy or girl, and the more 
they can be encouraged to stay in school and increase their 
preparation for life’s work. 
Intelligence requirements of the vocations. We are as 
yet in the mere beginnings of the study of vocational guid- 
ance by means of intelligence and aptitude tests, though the 
broad outlines of the field have been worked out. The pre- 
liminary studies by Terman and his students as to the I.Q.’s 
of certain groups of workers disclose an ascending level, by 
types of occupations, approximately as follows:

Other studies by other workers have confirmed the exist- 
ence of such an ascending scale. Interpreting the figures, in 
terms of pupils, it would mean that many of those of the low 
1.Q.’s ought to be directed toward vocational courses and 
work, and that some differentiation in the school work 
ought to be provided in the junior high school years. Em- 
phasis should be given in the case of the “finger-minded” 
pupils to their shop work, to nature study and agricultural

instruction, and along the lines of the domestic arts. It is 
almost useless for a boy or girl with an I.Q. of 75 to try to go 
to the high school, or for a boy of 80 to 85 to expect to go to 
college. Certain occupations, too, do not call for large in- 
telligence. An I.Q. of over 85 is probably wasted intelli- 
gence in a barber, street car conductor, or teamster, and 95 
and over on a carpenter, plumber, or office clerk. On the 
other hand, studies of children’s aspirations have shown the 
importance of directing many away from the learned pro- 
fessions and the white-collar employments. If all the chil- 
dren who in the elementary school think that they want to 
become lawyers and doctors and bank clerks were to do so, 
the present over-supply in these lines would be increased 
many times. 
While the main place for vocational guidance studies will 
always be in the high school; and the elementary school 
must always largely concern itself with holding the pupils in 
school and teaching them the fundamental ‘tools and the 
minimum essentials needed for life’s work, the opportunities 
of the upper grammar grades for starting thinking and di- 
recting effort along vocational lines ought not to be neg- 
lected. As recent studies have shown, we are after all 
largely a nation of sixth-graders, and much of what the 
school can do along lines of vocational guidance must be 
done in the elementary school if it is to be done at all. In 
this work of guiding aptitudes and shaping ambitions and 
advising parents the results of the new intelligence and ac; 
complishment tests are likely to play a rapidly increasing 
part.

CHAPTER XXV 
MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 
The teachers’ view. In the estimation of the teachers con- 
cerned the after-school meetings held by principals vary all 
the way from a bore and a necessary evil to an invaluable 
privilege. With educational work changing and expanding 
as it is with us the teachers’ meeting is a necessary feature in 
the administration of a school or a school system, yet in 
many schools the teachers’ meetings are the most disliked of 
all school duties. The additional hour or more added to the 
working day, the lack of any vital import of what is fre- 
quently presented, and their usual unprofitable character 
are sufficient explanations for the wery prevalent attitude. 
The principal who can get along with the fewest teachers’ 
meetings, and who can make the ones he does hold short, 
usually is most approved of by the teachers: Yet the teach- 
ers’ meeting, if properly handled, can be made a vital force 
in welding a group of teachers together, maintaining unity 
of purpose in a school, and building up professional ambi- 
tion and spirit. It is too valuable an instrument to be neg- 
lected, and the quite common objection to giving time to it 
must rest on its improper handling by many principals. 
Because of the objections so generally made many princi- 
pals do not hold any teachers’ meetings of a professional 
type, such meetings as are held being routine in character and 
of very brief duration. Others hold them as infrequently as 
the rules will permit. The writer has been acquainted with 
school systems where building teachers’ meetings of a pro- 
fessional type were entirely unknown. 
Reasons for this attitude. The reasons for this rather 
common attitude toward what conceivably could be made
-P-A-G-E-530
  514 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
of large value to the teachers themselves lie in the charac- 
ter of the meetings commonly held. 
Called at the fag end of the day, when tired nervous sys- 
tems are demanding rest and relaxation, seldom beginning 
on time, lacking in plan or help or inspiration, unnecessarily 
protracted, the discussion often monopolized by a few, and 
usually getting nowhere, it is not surprising that teachers 
begrudge the time they take and look upon them as an un- 
necessary waste of energy. 
Objectionable types of meetings. There are several types 
of teachers’ meetings that will almost certainly produce this 
result, and it may be well to enumerate here a few of the 
more common of the objectionable types. 
1. The bulletin-board type. ‘This type is that in which the 
principal calls his teachers together in meetings to tell them 
what he ought to inform them of by means of a bulletin 
board, personal notices, or a daily or weekly bulletin placed 
on their desks. Often three fourths of the time of a meet- 
ing is taken up with reading notices, calling attention to re- 
ports that will be due, giving out statistical information, and 
explaining matters of a purely routine nature. If a teach- 
ers’ meeting is to be made profitable, very little time should 
be taken up with such matters. It is not surprising that 
teachers object to staying to have read to them what they 
frequently already know, and if not should be informed of 
by some better method. 
2. The grievance-day type. In these the time is taken up 
by the teachers in presenting their various grievances, and 
having them considered. The teachers keep a record of 
their troubles, trials, and tribulations, and unload them, 
often from recorded notes, at the teachers’ meetings. Some 
teachers have few or none to unload; other teachers always 
have a plentiful supply. A half-dozen teachers consume 
the hour, the teachers leave the meeting dispirited and more
-P-A-G-E-531
  MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 515 
fatigued than when they entered it, little or nothing of any . - 
consequence is decided upon, and the help teachers have a 
right to expect is not forthcoming. All such matters should 
be settled as they occur, and between the parties concerned. 
It is bad policy to start teachers to recording their griev- 
ances. Put the emphasis on the other side. 
3. The grumbling type. In these the principal utilizes 
the meetings as an opportunity to find fault with what 
he has seen in the classrooms, on the grounds, and about the 
building. Some principals attempt to do their supervision 
of instruction in this manner, in an effort to avoid dealing di- 
rectly and individually with teachers. Criticisms are made 
in general, to be applied by those whom they fit. Some- 
times the occasion is used by the principal to “bawl out” 
some one without naming the person. It is a fundamental 
mistake to scold a body of teachers for the shortcomings of a 
few. Sometimes the teachers, trained by this kind of proce- 
dure, take the bit themselves and complain of existing con- 
ditions and requirements. This type of meeting soon pro- 
motes mutual dislike, distrust, and disloyalty to those in 
authority, and effectively destroys that esprit de corps and 
professional spirit which should animate a body of teachers. 
4. The lecture-by-the-principal type. In this type the 
principal dominates the meeting and gives a professional 
lecture to the teachers. What he gives them may be good 
in itself without being useful. There will be times when a 
principal may properly take most of the time to present 
something that is vital to the work of the school, but after 
doing so he should leave some time for questions or discus- 
sion by the teachers. The principal who continually tries 
to “carry the ball” will find that the teachers soon lose in- 
terest in the game. 
5. The routine-business type. Some principals devote 
their teachers’ meetings entirely or almost entirely to pupil
-P-A-G-E-532
TT ee eee Pee Ce ee 
516 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
cases, formulating regulations, and other types of routine 
school business. This type of meeting is usually more ac- 
ceptable than the other types mentioned because the teach- 
ers now have an opportunity to participate in the discussion 
and help in formulating the regulations for the school. 
Some principals find so many matters to bring before the 
routine type of meeting for discussion and decision that they 
excuse themselves from planning any more serious or more 
profitable work. 
Certain routine business is likely to need attention by the 
teachers as a group, but to devote whole meetings, unless 
quite short ones, to routine matters is not profitable. If 
routine matters need consideration at a regular after-school 
teachers’ meeting, bring them up first, handle them expedi- 
tiously, get at a decision quickly, and then proceed to more 
important business. Some principals hold two types of 
teachers’ meetings — one a short one of ten to fifteen min- 
utes, meeting at or just after the lunch hour and for routine 
matters only, and the other an after-school meeting for pro- 
fessional purposes. 
It is not to be wondered that busy, hard-working, and 
sincere teachers look upon most of such meetings as 4n im- 
position and a waste of time. Thinking, well-educated 
teachers have a right to expect more from the leadership of 
a principal when he detains them for a teachers’ meeting. 
Responsibility of a principal. If a principal finds that a 
majority of his teachers have concluded that his teachers’ 
meetings are uninteresting and unprofitable, he should se- 
riously examine himself to see if he is not to blame. After 
all, a principal stands in much the same relation to his teach- 
ers that the teachers do to the children. When the work 
presented to the children fails to make an appeal the princi- 
pal places the responsibility on the teacher or the course of 
study, rather than on the children. Do not the same princi-
-P-A-G-E-533
Fe nee RE ee ee ee ae eet nr a Ree ee ee 
MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 517 
ples apply to the teachers’ meetings? That these meetings 
can be made a potent force in awakening and stimulating 
professional interest has been demonstrated too often to be 
* gainsaid. 
The principal should use his every endeavor to make his 
teachers’ meetings live, interesting, and profitable. In a 
general way they should aim to develop and strengthen a 
spirit of unity, loyalty, and ambition among the teachers; 
they should contribute to the professional growth of the 
teachers, both in theory and in practice; and they should 
serve the principal as one of a number of means of effective 
supervision of his corps. Most teachers are, after all is said, 
anxious to grow, and it is the chief duty of the principal to 
stimulate them and help them to do so. The building 
teachers’ meeting, rightly handled, is one means to this end. 
There are few tests of the real qualities of professional 
leadership of a principal quite so exacting as the test of his 
ability to make his regular building teachers’ meetings of in- 
terest and real professional value to his teachers. To do so 
calls for sound professional training and knowledge, some 
insight into human nature, genuine professional enthusiasm, 
and some administrative skill. If the principal can succeed 
in making his meetings of large professional value, and can 
stand out as the teacher and: leader and master-mind of his 
group, he has an asset that will stand him in good stead and 
win for him the professional support of his teachers as al- 
most nothing else will do. Far too many principals fail to 
realize the large possibilities they have for making good 
teachers into better ones, and that the greater part of the 
teacher’s professional growth comes after she begins work as 
a teacher. 
Types, time, frequency, and method. - There are two 
types of teachers’ meetings that a principal will probably 
want to hold — (1) short ones for matters of school business, °
-P-A-G-E-534
  518 - THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
and (2) longer ones for professional purposes. It is a good 
plan to keep the two types of meeting separate. The best 
time for the routine business meeting is at the noon hour, 
and the time limit for such meetings should be fifteen to 
twenty minutes. If the teachers lunch together, immedi- 
ately after lunch is the time to hold such meetings, and they 
should be as informal and business should be expedited as 
rapidly as can be done...Such meetings might be held once 
a week, on a fixed day, or more often at times, if there 
seemed a necessity for so doing. 
The other type of teachers’ meeting, for professional pur- 
poses, should be longer, and is best held after school on a 
fixed afternoon. Some principals hold these professional 
meetings as frequently as once a week, others twice a 
month, some once a month, and some only occasionally on 
‘call. Unless there are rules to the contrary, the number held 
should be no more than can be-made profitable and helpful. 
On the other hand they should be frequent enough to enable 
a principal to carry through a definite plan or campaign 
and accomplish something during the year. Remembering 
that teachers have other meetings to attend — grade meet~ 
ings, special supervisors, superintendent’s general, parent- 
teacher, and personal organizations — once in two weeks is 
perhaps the most desirable frequency. 
_As to time, hold the-meetings early in the week, before 
\ the teachers get tired and “nerves”’ get on edge. The day 
and time might well be fixed, after consideration with the 
teachers at the beginning of the year, though Monday and 
Tuesday are perhaps the best days, and ten to fifteen min- 
utes after school closes the best time. In some schools all 
pupils are dismissed a half hour early on teachers’ meeting 
ES days, but it is doubtful if the cutting down of the school 
_ hours can be justified for a building teachers’ meeting. As 
in the business world, teachers must be expected to take
-P-A-G-E-535
MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 519 
some little time to familiarize themselves with the best pro- 
cedure in the business in which they are engaged, and to im- 
prove their qualifications as salesmen. Once the day is 
  fixed it ought to be adhered to, so that teachers may know | 
when to expect the meetings and may make their plans ac- 
cordingly. As >to place, hold it in the most comfortable 
room in the building. If the teachers can gather around a 
common table, it generally promotes discussion. 
As the teachers are tired, it is not only restful but puts 
every one in a better humor if ten to fifteen minutes at the 
beginning are taken for social purposes, over a cup of tea 
with sandwiches or cakes. Such a “psychology tea’’ re- 
laxes the strain of the day, promotes good feeling, and gives 
fresh vigor for thinking during the following hour. The 
principal could well afford to begin this at his own expense. 
Committees to handle the refreshments can easily be ap- 
pointed, and thé teachers will soon offer to share the cost. 
The formal meeting can then begin by 3.20 to 3.25, and 
should close at-the end-of an-hour... It is important that the 
meeting start promptly, know how and where it is going, 
and stop when it is finished. Conduct it as though it were a 
business proposition. You have a definite piece of work to 
do; do it and let your teachers go.. Only when there is @ 
general desire to continue longer should the meeting be al- 
lowed to run over the hour, and then not for more than five 
or ten minutes. The principal should then adjourn the 
meeting and let those who care to talk longer remain to do 
so. It is good psychology to stop before the group has 
talked the subject out. The principal will need to-keep his 
program in mind, keep his eye on the clock, hold down irrel- 
evant discussion, and proceed systematically to the desired 
end. be 
Have definite objectives.’-A principal should no more at- 
tempt to conduct a professional teachers’ meeting without a
-P-A-G-E-536
520 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
clear outline of what he intends to do during a term, or year, 
and careful preparation for each fortnightly meeting, than 
should a professor in a university attempt to meet classes 
without knowing what he is going to do and how he is going 
to doit. (The first thing a principal must decide upon is the 
general line of work he expects to carry out over a period of 
time at least as long as a half year.) He should welcome 
suggestions from the teachers as to’ what they would like 
best to do, and if they seem profitable he may adopt some of 
them. Still he must be the master mind in the matter of 
“ff | the teachers’ meetings if he hopes to be the professional 
leader in the school. His teachers’ meetings, instead of be- 
ing dry, routine affairs, should be sources of professional in- 
spiration and new life, but if they are to be such it must 
come from his wider knowledge, more extensive reading, and 
larger professional insight and enthusiasm and skill. In the 
conduct of his teachers’ meetings he stands somewhat in the 
position of an instructor in a normal school, and he must 
lead as he expects his teachers to lead in their classrooms. 
No work that a principal can do will do more to keep him 
alive and growing professionally than will the personal 
study and preparation necessary for good classroom super- 
vision, and the conduct of vigorous and professionally help- 
ful teachers’ meetings. 
The first thing then for him to do is to determine his ob- 
4 jectives over a period of time, and then organize his meet- 
ings so as to cover some one part of his objective at each 
meeting. Just what kind of objectives he will decide upon 
will be determined somewhat by the needs of his staff, their 
general professional attitude, the special problems of his 
school, and the general policies which the superintendent is 
trying to put into effect for the school system as a whole. 
There are so many problems possible to a live and thinking 
principal that he might conduct normal school work with  
-P-A-G-E-537
  MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 521 
his teachers for a decade without duplicating what he has 
done before. 
Types of objectives. Only a few types of objectives can 
be indicated here, but these may be taken as illustrative of 
what any live and intelligent principal may think out for 
himself. 
I. A connected series of pupil problems. Many of these 
could be outlined. The following may be taken as illustra- 
tive: 
1. Securing good attendance. 
2. The drawing and holding power of our school. 
8. Utilizing the play impulse. 
4. Truancy; its causes and remedies. 
5. Boys and their gangs. 
6. Building up pupil codperation. 
7. Making special days useful. 
8. Codperation with the Parent-Teacher Association. 
9. How make our school entertainments of value. 
0. 10. Building up the school spirit. 
II. Practical classroom teaching problems. Dozens of 
these could be outlined. A few pertinent ones for which 
there is plenty of good reading are: 
. Types of teaching. 
. The drill lesson. 
. The inductive lesson. 
. The deductive lesson. 
. The lesson for appreciation. 
. The study lesson. 
. The review lesson. 
. The recitation lesson. 
. The art of questioning. 
. Artistic teaching. 
11. Habit formation. 
12. How and what to memorize. 
13. Attention and interest. 
14. Stimulating thinking. 
15. Socializing the school work. _ SOMRIAMNE WWE
-P-A-G-E-538

16. Repetition, wise and otherwise. 
17. Awakening ideals. 
18. Training for citizenship. 
19. Economy in classroom management. 
20. Variability of teachers’ marks. 
III. Pupil-differences problems. This is a very interest- 
ing field with plenty of live problems, and a year or two 
could be well spent on the general topic, with much profit- 
able reading done by all. Terman’s The Intelligence of 
School Children would be a good book for general reading, 
while centering the discussion of the meetings about some 
such list of practical schoolroom topics as the following: 
. Individual differences. 
. Promotions. 
. Best bases for promotion. 
Use of the ungraded.room. 
. Retardation and acceleration. 
. Differentiated courses of study. 
Minimum essentials. 
. The average pupil. 
' 9. The superior group. 
10. Special opportunities for ability.

IV. Miscellaneous school problems. Often a principal 
will find it advisable to follow a number of lines during a 
year, taking up topics that seem of most usefulness without 
reference to any one objective. His objéctive now is a gen- 
eral-purpose objective. The following outline for a year’s 
work will illustrate this type of planning: 
| 1. Routine work on organization and administrative problems. 
‘2. On what may we concentrate this year? 
‘8. How are we using the educational resources of our commu- 
nity? 
4. What do our boys and girls do outside of school hours? 
\ 8. Making our special school occasions profitable. 
6. How may we build up our Parent-Teacher meetings? 
7. Health factors which influence the progress of our children.
-P-A-G-E-539

8. Devices for interesting careless and indifferent pupils. 
9. Best methods for handling the written work of pupils. 
10. Our school savings bank in relation to the corner grocery and 
drug store. ‘: 
/11. How preserve the teacher’s health throughout the year? 
12. Preparing our pupils for social usefulness. 
13. Larger aspects of our civic work. 
14. Forming ideals and ambitions. 
15. School excursions and how to conduct them. 
16. Mechanizing routine. 
17. Reading for appreciation. 
(18. How to be happy as a teacher. 
19. Why it pays to go to summer school. 
20. Routine administrative work. 
V. Objectives in the different subjects in the course of study. 
One or more meetings might be given to a consideration of 
what are the main objectives in teaching the different sub- 
jects in the course of study, and what the school should aim 
to accomplish in each. For example, three or four meetings 
might be devoted to the teaching of spelling or handwriting 
or reading, or the larger aims in teaching civics or science or 
play might be made profitable and helpful. With so many 
possibilities, the problem is rather the selection of that 
which is most needed and can be best presented. 
Sometimes course-of-study work can be made into a co- 
operative study, with committees, to formulate new out- 
lines or supplemental outlines for use along with the regular 
course of study. This often becomes quite prolonged, leads 
to much discussion, and can be made very fruitful in educat- 
ing teachers in the aims and purposes and underlying theory 
of the work of the schools. 
VI. Results of the classroom supervision. Form 4, page 
441, gave a supervisory program of one principal for one 
month. Similar programs could be made out covering 
eight or nine of the months of a school year, and so organ- 
“ized in advance that the whole would represent a some-
-P-A-G-E-540
524, THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
what connected outline of work. The results of each two 
weeks’ supervisory visitation would then be presented to the 
teachers at the fortnightly teachers’ meetings. The results 
should be organized by the principal, some of the data 
charted, and the whole placed before the teachers with a 
series of questions which will lead to discussion and help to 
bring out the significance of the results obtained. 
VII. Educational tests and measurements. A year’s 
work in the use and interpretation of the results of the best 
of the educational tests, using as guides some such books as 
Hines’ Guide to Educational Measurements and Monroe’s 
Measuring the Results of Teaching in studying and giving 
the tests and interpreting the results. This is rather ma- 
ture work, and might prove too ambitious a program. If 
so, it would be better to take up individual subjects, such as 
spelling, arithmetic, or handwriting, use the tests as supple- 
mental aids, explain their use and how to give them, try 
them in the grades, and use the results at a later teachers’ 
meeting. 
VIII. Study of a book. Sometimes, when there is a gen- 
eral desire for a group study of some good professional book, 
such as one of the Reading Circle books, this can be made 
quite profitable, but too often this kind of work is rather 
dreary and without much value because it is poorly handled. 
A study of topics or problems is usually better. If a book is 
used the principal should not assign chapters and then con- 
duct a quiz on the reading. This is deadening. Instead, 
organize the teachers into study or problem groups, have in- 
dividual teachers take charge on different days, and keep 
plenty of time for discussion. If fifteen minutes were made 
a maximum for the presentation and criticism of the chap- 
ter by the leader, and the remainder of the time given to a 
group discussion of not only the chapter, but also of a dozen 
or so thought-provoking questions applying the chapter to
-P-A-G-E-541
MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 525 
schoolroom practice which the principal, or better still a 
group of teachers has prepared and given out, the work will 
be relieved of what most teachers find so deadening in the 
so-called Reading Circle discussion of a book. The princi- 
pal can then keep largely in the background until the sum- 
ming-up time comes. 
IX. Capitalizing the successes of the teachers. Much of 
the fine work done by teachers goes to waste because it is not 
capitalized by principals and superintendents. At times 
some teacher may tell of some particular work she has made 
a success in developing, and stand a quiz on it. Occasionally 
some especially good work may be taught before the group, 
and the whole laid open to questioning as to purpose and 
plan and procedure. This has been mentioned before 
(Chapter XXII). The best place for ‘this type of work, 
though, is at the grade teachers’ meetings for a supervisory 
group or for the whole city, rather than at the single building 
teachers’ meeting. {A good principle to keep in mind is that 
what is presented att a building teachers’ meeting should be 
of.interest to all, and closely applied to the work the teachers 
are doing. If demonstration lessons are given before a build- 
ing teachers’ meeting the emphasis should be placed on 
method or procedure, rather than on subject-matter. 
The principal as the professional leader of the group. 
The above types are illustrative of what might be done in 
the professional teachers’ meetings. Sometimes, instead of 
following a single line, combinations of different types of 
work may be made. Occasionally, too, the principal should 
take full charge of the meeting, and tell the group what is 
going on in the educational world, suggest to them possibili- 
ties of accomplishment not thought of before, describe to 
them some ‘significant educational experiment now being 
made, open up a new vision of usefulness in the profession, 
or digest for them the main contribution of some new and
-P-A-G-E-542
    526 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
stimulating article or book. The principal should not be in 
the center of the st: stage all the time in a teachers’ meeting 
any more than in a school assembly, but there are times 
“in each when he should take charge and “put over” a talk 
* that will not only be interesting and important, but also 
will do something to-lift teachers out of the monotony of 
their daily work and give them a larger vision. He can 
usually base such a talk on some article or book he has 
read, or something that he has seen, and thus become an 
interpreter to them of the best educational thought of the 
day. 
An important rule to follow in all he does is to keep what 
/ he attempts simple, concrete, and clearly applicable to the 
teachers’ classroom problems. | The principal must not ex- 
pect his teachers to do any large amount of reading or work 
’for these meetings; they have other things to do. Rather 
he must do the thinking and the preparing, and use the 
meetings to give them new inspiration for their work and to 
stimulate them to think. (He must have read more and 
know more about every subject brought before the group 
than he can expect his teachers to do or know. He needs to 
be full of ideas and questions, and to know much more about 
‘the topic for the day than he will say or use. Still more, he 
must be enthusiastic about it, and be able to make his en- 
thusiasm contagious. The better the principal is prepared 
the less he will need to say, and the more he will be able by 
skillful questioning to stimulate others to activity instead? 
Rules and cautions. That a principal should make his 
teachers’ meetings helpful and stimulating and vital has 
been said with sufficient emphasis not to need further men- 
tion. By way of summary a few rules and cautions may be 
given: 
1. Avoid trying to do too much in any one meeting or series of 
meetings. Take time to follow up a good lead that teachers
-P-A-G-E-543
  
MAKING TEACHERS’ MEETINGS PROFITABLE 527 
are interested in, even if the program you had formed for the 
term or year may not becovered. Much of what you planned 
to do may well go over to next year. Any one of the topics 
suggested above for a single meeting might prove so interest- 
ing that it might pay to devote two or three meetings to it. 
2. Donot try to do all the work alone. Ask different teachers to 
take part. Organize working committees. Recognize that 
your interest in a subject has come largely from your study of 
it, and that the teachers are likely to become interested in pro- 
portion as you relate the topic to their daily work and get 
them to thinking and working on it. 
8. Try to get all the teachers, as far as possible, into the discus- 
sion, by asking questions of them if they do not enter it volun- 
tarily. ; 
4. Keep the meeting as informal as conditions will permit, but 
be able to hold every one to the question so that the meeting 
will move along. A rapid fire of questions in which many 
take part is far better than longer talks by any one. 
5. Keep the questioning and discussion constructive. Do not 
illustrate the point by mentioning some wrong practice you 
have seen in the rooms. On the contrary, frequently take oc- 
casion to illustrate with good things you have seen your teach- 
ers do. 
6. If a professional book is used as a basis for the discussion, use 
teachers to present the work of the day, and small groups of 
teachers to plan the discussion. Keep somewhat in the back- 
ground yourself, so as to keep alive the interest of the teach- 
ers in the book. 
7. Do not hold the meetings too long. The teachers get tired, 
and they are not as interested in them as you ought to be. 
Keep the meeting moving, and leave the discussion at a point 
where the teachers are eager for more. 
8. If a demonstration lesson is to be given, know in advance ex- 
actly what is to be taught and the outlines of the lesson plan, 
that you may be prepared to handle the discussion and keep it 
going well. 
Permit interruptions by questions and illustrative contribu- 
tions, as this is a good sign of teacher activity. Invite a chal- 
lenge of every point involved. 
10. While in general expecting all teachers to be present, do not 
wait for tardy ones, and be perfectly willing to excuse a 
teacher without requiring her to tell you why. 9. 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
    ne THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
AL . Keep the meeting balanced and well-timed. Do not use over 
fifteen or twenty minutes, ordinarily, for presentation of the 
topic of the day. Keep half an hour for general discussion, 
and be prepared with enough good questions and applications 
to make the discussion active and pertinent. 
12. That the meeting may be brought to a proper conclusion, al- 
ways save a few minutes to sum up the points, pro and con, 
that have been brought out, suggest a few applications and 
further questions, and summarize the discussion. This leaves 
* the teachers with a consciousness that something has come 
out of the meeting, that it was worth while, and that the prin- 
cipal had a real purpose in holding it. 
13. At the close of the meeting, announce the topic for the next 
meeting, and the leaders for the day. This is good psychology, 
as it awakens interest and stimulates thinking. 
14. Keep the meetings largely for yourself and your teachers, and 
ordinarily do not bring in outside persons to talk to the teach- 
ers. Teachers hear far too many lectures, and think in groups 
far too little. If teachers from other schools want to come, 
that is a different matter. 
Conducted somewhat as has been described, the building 
teachers’ meetings can be made helpful and profitable. ( Ad- 
equate professional preparation on the part of the principal, 
and his willingness to organize efficiently the details of each 
meeting, are the prime requisites for ses) They will re- 
quire thinking and planning on the part of thé principal, but 
it will be time and effort well spent. He will grow more un- 
der it than will his teachers. If he plans his meetings so as to 
present material for discussion having a close connection 
with their daily problems, if he keeps the meeting a discus- 
sion meeting, if he is a good presiding officer and knows how 
to keep the talk moving and to the point, if he prepares him- 
self well so as to be able to inject ideas and questions and 
pertinent data, and if he can summarize well what has been 
done in the hour, it is safe to say that his teachers will soon 
come to feel that his teachers’ meetings are not only profit- 
able but an invaluable privilege as well.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS 
1. Suppose a new and well-prepared principal, going to a school which 
has not had building teachers’ meetings of a professional type for 
years. What type of professional meetings would you suggest that 
he begin with? Why? 
2. Suppose you conduct two types of building teachers’ meetings, as de- 
scribed in this chapter. List a dozen topics you would take up at 
the noon after-lunch meeting. 
8. Take any topic given under Types of Objectives, I, II, or III, and pre- 
pare the kind of an outline you would make up on it for a building pro- 
fessional teachers’ meeting. Add two or three good brief references, 
and half a dozen good questions that apply the topic to the school 
work. 
4.. Name some professional book you think would be good to use as a 
Reading Circle book with your teachers, state why you think it would 
be good, and indicate how you would plan to use it. 
5. Suppose it is your day to take charge of the meeting and give your 
teachers a real message. What would you do? 
6. It is often stated that the life.of a school can be made to revolve 
about good teachers’ meetings. Show how this might be true.

  CHAPTER XXVI 
EXTRA SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 
1. Special school occasions 
Changed conception of the school. The progressive change 
shown in the character of the school buildings reproduced in 
Figures 5 to 10, pages 95 to 103, beginning with a simple, 
old-style school building of fourteen classrooms and an office 
and with almost no play space, as shown in Figure 5, and 
gradually progressing to the large, well-arranged, highly- 
differentiated community-center school building shown in 
Figure 10, with its regular classrooms, many special rooms, 
good play space, branch library, and assembly hall, is typi- 
cal of the change in the conception as to the purpose of Amer- 
ican education that has come in the past quarter-century. 
Once a somewhat isolated and purely academic institution 
and dealing only with children, the public schoolhouse is to- 
day in process of being transformed into a center for the 
community life. 
With the coming of large numbers of foreign-born peo- 
ples, and the increased participation in the functions of gov- 
ernment on the part of all the people, the demand has be- 
come stronger and stronger that the public school, as the 
One great, active, unifying, non-racial, non-political, non- 
sectarian force in our national life, should take upon itself a 
new service and make of itself a center for the formation 
and education of community sentiment. As the public 
schoo] authorities have in turn been forced to ask the people 
for increased funds for the support of the many new policies 
and extensions the past quarter-century has brought, it has 
become increasingly necessary that each unit in the public

534 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
school system do its part in the formation of that commu- 
nity sentiment, and in promoting understanding between the 
school and the parents who send their children to it. 
In an increasing number of our cities definite community- 
center activities are being organized in connection with the 
schools by a special staff of workers, and the school building 
is being utilized extensively, outside the regular school 
hours, for many new types of educational and semi-educa- 
tional work. Such work is quite generally under some form 
of special organization, and no attempt will be made to de- 
scribe it here. Instead, only a few of the more simple things 
that a principal and. his teachers may do, working without 
the aid of any community-center organization, will be indi- 
cated. 
Building up school support. As was pointed out in Chap- 
ter III, in outlining the general nature of the principal’s 
work, all these new social functions and relationships mean 
quite an extension of the older conception as to the work of 
an elementary-school principal. The progress of the school 
having outrun the thinking of the people, in a very real sense 
the principal must now act as an interpreter to the people of 
his community of the meaning and significance of what the 
sehool is trying to do for their children, and of the larger 
policies that the superintendent of schools and the board of 
education are trying to put in force for the city as a whole. 
It is one of his functions to help build up in his community 
a spirit of codperation and willingness to back the schools 
in voicing their needs, and against hostile attacks. A 
school system that is moving forward cannot afford to have 
its public in ignorance of its aims and its achievements. 
For the benefit of the school, then, as well as for the bene- 
fit of its public, each school ought to provide a number of 
opportunities during the school year when the parents may 
come and see to advantage the work of the school. These
-P-A-G-E-551
  
EXTRA SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 535 
special opportunities, or occasions, when the parents of the 
children are invited to come, are the school’s chance to get 
in close touch with the parents. Well managed, they enlist 
solid support for the school; poorly managed, they generate 
opposition from those who ought to be the school’s friends. 
They are opportunities for a form of educational propa- 
ganda, but unless the campaign is well thought out and the 
plan of action clear, with a quite definite purpose for each 
such undertaking, they may not contribute much to the pro- 
motion of better relations between the home and the school. 
Just what it is best to do and just how to do it will depend 
much on the character of the people who send children to 
the school, upon the type of school, the neighborhood, the 
traditions of the city, and the degree of success or failure 
that has attended any past efforts in this direction. In gen- 
eral, three main types of special school occasions may be 
provided for by a principal and his teachers, viz., (1) special 
school visitation days, (2) special program cee and (3) 
annual exhibit days. 
Special school visitation days. These are attempts to get 
the parents into close personal touch with the earnest and 
thoughtful service which progressive and capable teachers 
are rendering daily to their children. How to secure such 
visitation is sometimes a difficult problem, but the greatest 
appreciation usually results from it. One plan is to set aside 
three or four afternoons a year for this special purpose, have 
the pupils invite their parents, and have them visit the class- 
rooms where their children are or see work in which they are 
interested. The program may be somewhat rearranged for 
the afternoon, though regular school work should proceed. 
It is often highly interesting and helpful for parents to hear 
and see how the old-line subjects are taught by modern 
methods, and it does much toward inspiring confidence in 
the work of the schools and the ability of the teacher. Afew
-P-A-G-E-552
  536 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
words of explanation given by the teacher before each exer- 
cise will serve to make clearer the work being done. 
One principal of the writer’s acquaintance, who has been 
particularly successful in building up school and home codp- 
eration, holds one of these visitation-day afternoons once a 
month, on the afternoon that the Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tion meets at his school, and once a year he has a big eve- 
ning meeting instead, intended to reach the fathers, and with 
all the instruction done by teachers and classes on the audi- 
torium stage. For each such meeting his pupils write notes 
inviting their parents to be present, and copying from the 
blackboard the program that will be followed that after- 
noon. ‘The following is a sample. 
PROGRAM FOR MARCH 15 
Room 9 — Grade 4A 
Mary Brewer, Teacher 
1.00 to 1.25 Music — Note drill — Rote singing. 
1.25 to 1.50 Oral arithmetic drill. 
1.50 to 2.05 Recess. 
2.05 to 2.30 Blackboard drill work. 
2.30 to 3.00. Home geography. 
The parents are received and ushered to the rooms by 
eighth-grade pupils, and the teachers work in their class- 
rooms until closing time. By keeping their programs 
wholly representative of the work of the school, both princi- 
pals and teachers use these special days to build up home 
understanding and support and codperation. 
Special program days. Every school will have a number 
of special program days, when half an hour or more will be 
given to a special program celebrating some event or special 
day, and to which parents may or may not be invited to 
come. Such special days would be Columbus Day, Thanks- 
giving Wednesday, Lincoln’s Birthday, Washington’s Birth- 
day, Longfellow’s Birthday, Fire-Prevention Day, and Arbor 
Day. Every school bearing some person’s name should
-P-A-G-E-553
EXTRA SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 587 
have a special program on that person’s birthday, that the 
pupils may become familiar with what he did and stood for 
and why the school came to be named for him. These, 
though, are school affairs rather than special school occa- 
sions. 
In addition, a school may well afford to take time to or- 
ganize one or two special programs, best carried out in the 
evenings, and which the parents are urged to attend. A 
good program illustrative of the school work should be pre- 
pared, the older pupils or the Scouts should do the ushering 
and manage the affair, and the principal should preside, wel- 
come the parents, and introduce the numbers with a few 
words of explanation of each. 
Another type of evening program occasionally used is that 
in which regular school work is carried on in the classrooms 
for an hour in the evening, the parents coming and being 
seated in the rooms. One principal who did this, in a school 
in a foreign community, found it so successful that the par- 
ents refused to send their children to a parochial school that 
was about to be opened in the neighborhood, and the attend- 
ance of parents at the public evening school greatly in- 
creased. Such occasions develop a community apprecia- 
tion for the school and are helpful in many ways, provided 
they are not undertaken too frequently and do not involve 
too much special preparation. 
It is usually rather easy to get out a good attendance 
for programs in the evening if held in a comfortable school 
auditorium equipped with good seats and a well-lighted 
stage. In such buildings as are shown in Figures 5, 6, 7, 
and 8 such a program would not be possible because of the 
lack of a school auditorium, but in the schools shown in Fig- 
ures 9 and 10 much of importance could be provided. The 
preparation will of course require some extra work on the 
part of the principal and teachers, the crowd will get the

  538 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCH ‘ Fae ¢   
building dirty, and there may be some disorder in the hall- _ 
ways, but these disadvantages are more than compensated — 
for by the increase in home understanding and codperation 
that come from a good program well presented. 
Since the attendance frequently will be rather closely re- 
lated to the number of different pupils participating, a prin- 
cipal is wise to see to it that in the choruses and exercises a 
large number of pupils have a part in the program. Single- 
pupil numbers should be avoided, and the work should be 
kept as truly representative of the regular school work as 
can be done. An orchestra number or two; some part sing- 
ing by whole classes; a chorus; some physical exercise drills; 
some actual class exercises on the platform, such as rapid 
drill work and problem solving in mental arithmetic, a de- 
velopmental lesson on some topic in American history, or a 
map-drill lesson in geography; with a closing song by the 
audience, led by the teacher of music; represent one type of 
program that might be profitable. Nothing should be con- 
tinued for very long, the program itself should not be too 
extended, and what is done should be done promptly and 
rapidly. 
Annual exhibit days. Many schools find it very profit- 
able to hold, in the spring, an annual school exhibit of the 
work done throughout the year, to which parents are in- 
vited. Representative work is exhibited in the different 
classrooms and shops. The pupils not acting as ushers are 
dismissed for the afternoon. The teachers are present 
in their rooms to meet parents and explain the work, 
and some form of program is given in the evening. It isa 
sort of general reception and parents’ day combined. A 
special effort is made to get the fathers out at the evening 
meeting. Since this exhibit is anticipated during the whole 
year, good work can be laid aside for it and the actual ex- 
hibit should not require much extra time for preparation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-555
    organization. What is exhibited, too, eitsalek be the regular 
work of the school, and not specially prepared work that is 
not only not representative of actual conditions but is waste- 
ful of time and effort as well. If the principal isa good chart 
maker, and can have some good diagrams to hang up show- 
ing school results, it adds to the interest. 
The purpose of all these special occasions is to bring the 
parents who send children to the school into closer contact 
with principal and teachers, and to build up understanding 
and support. A school system that is making progress 
needs to keep its parents in touch with what is being done, 
In so doing these special occasions are far more effective 
than articles in the newspapers, useful as these may be. All 
the special occasions so far described should be free of charge, 
that no family need be kept away by the necessity of pay- 
ing an admission fee. This is an important feature. 
2. Entertainments to raise money 
The arguments against. In many schools, however, it is 
customary to have entertainments for the purpose of raising 
money for some school need. Whether or not this type of 
entertainment is desirable depends much on the type of par- 
ents and neighborhood sending children to the school. In 
some places they are quite successful and provoke little ad- 
verse comment, while in others they make trouble and cause 
much criticism of the school. In a few cities they have 
been forbidden by the general school regulations.. Some 
principals believe in them heartily, while others regard 
them as a nuisance that should be suppressed. In school 
systems of moderate size or in small towns, where the school 
money is more limited and where the board of education 
has not as yet come to see that certain types of supplies and 
equipment should be provided at public expense, the enter- 
tainment to raise money usually works out better than in
-P-A-G-E-556
540 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
the larger cities. The admission-fee entertainment is often 
the device of the needy community, and the only means 
available by which the school can provide itself with needed 
play apparatus, musical equipment, or support some worthy 
school undertaking. Often, on the other hand, the com- 
\ . munity could well afford to provide the needed equipment, 
but has never been educated up to see that it ought to do so. 
A very good case can be made out against entertainments 
to raise money for school needs. It can be argued that it is 
not the business of principal or teachers to raise money for 
school purposes, but that they should look to the school au- 
thorities to provide the necessary books, pictures, play ap- 
’ paratus, athletic equipment, musical instruments, and sim- 
ilar material. - It can also be argued that any form of enter- 
tainment for school purposes in a public schoolhouse ought 
to be free to all, and that the-school, being a state institu- 
tion, should have its legitimate needs met by general taxa- 
tion instead of trying to extract small sums of money from 
parents and children who often can hardly afford to pay, 
but who grudgingly contribute to keep up appearances. 
The preparation for thesé occasions, too, breaks into regular 
school work, takes the time of pupils and teachers that 
should be used for other things, imposes unnecessary extra 
burdens on principal and teachers and dissipates the ener- 
gies of the school, while the net financial returns are not at 
all commensurate with the labor expended. Once begun, 
the board of education is likely to use their success as an 
excuse for not appropriating funds another year, and the 
abuse persists. The advocates of the above points of view 
would prohibit all entertainments in the school buildings or 
elsewhere for the purpose of raising money for the schools, 
and would permit only the free entertainment and school 
displays described in the preceding section. 
The opposite point of view. While admitting the objec-
-P-A-G-E-557
EXTRA SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 541 
tions given above as important, there are other principals 
who believe that these objections can be obviated by proper 
handling, and that the advantages to be obtained from the 
pay type of entertainment outweigh their disadvantages. 
In the development of a strong school spirit, in training the 
pupils in group activity and friendly codperation, and in in- 
teresting the parents in the school, it is held that one or pos- 
sibly two pay entertainments a year are worth all they cost. 
Rarely, they contend, do the parents begrudge the dimes 
they pay, while both parents and pupils appreciate the 
school the more because by their efforts they helped to pro- 
vide it with something it needed and which they can now 
enjoy. ‘ 
The pupils, too, get valuable training and develop much 
fine school spirit from putting through some entertainment 
that to an adult might seem wasteful of effort and relatively 
unprofitable. It is what one gives to an institution rather 
than what one gets from it that counts, after all. The gen- 
eral result of a successful entertainment is a feeling of 
pride in the school, and an improved attitude toward it 
on the part of the pupils. The parents often give material 
help in preparing for these occasions, and this in turn fre- 
quently develops appreciation and support. Rightly han- 
dled they can be made to contribute to discipline and order 
by enlisting the activities of pupils who might otherwise be 
troublesome. The experience gained by the pupils, too, is 
of distinct value, and there is also an element of value in the 
business side of an undertaking carried through successfully. 
Handling such an entertainment. Even admitting that 
the bad features probably outweigh the good, that the good 
features could be obtained for the school in some less 
wasteful manner, and that it would be desirable in most 
communities not to have pay entertainments at all, still 
the necessities of the school and the traditions of the
-P-A-G-E-558
  542 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
community may be such that it will seem wise to hold an 
occasional entertainment for which an admission fee is 
charged. If so, then so far as possible the following prin- 
ciples ought to prevail in its organization and conduct. 
1. See that the entertainment put on has some intrinsic educa- 
tional value, and is worth while from an educational point of 
view as well as a money-raiser. 
2. Do not have many pay entertainments in a year — one or two 
at most. 
8. Keep the admission charge to the main entertainment moder- 
ate, but at the same time do not go to the trouble of arranging 
for it unless you expect to make some money by it. Some op- 
tional side-shows for which an extra fee is charged may help 
the fund. 
4, The entertainment given should be worth the admission price. 
5. As far as possible avoid individual-pupil exercises. Instead 
put on group activities, and in these give all pupils equal op- 
portunities regardless of ability. Chorus singing, group calis- 
thenic drills, pageants, dramatization, folk dancing groups, 
Boy Scout demonstrations, an inter-school debate, or a May 
Day entertainment are types of group activities that interest 
and do not awaken criticism as do such individual perform- 
ances as where Rosie speaks a piece or Oscar plays the violin. 
Minimizing the work of preparation. In oie school 
which has handled the pay entertainment very satisfacto- 
rily, two such entertainments are given each year. One year 
the one in the late autumn is given by the first four grades, 
and the one in the spring by the four upper grades. The 
next year this order is reversed. ‘The teachers of each 
group and the principal decide early on the date and general 
outline of the program, and divide up the work by assign$ 
ing definite parts to each room. The exercises are planned, 
as far as possible, to take in whole classes, and are as repre- 
sentative of the school work as is the usual assembly pro- 
gram (Chapter XVII). This enables the teacher to train the 
pupils gradually, as part of their regular school work, to do

some particular thing well. This avoids all after-school 
practicing and extra preparation, and in consequence re- 
moves most of the objectionable features. A week before 
the entertainment the practicing is transferred to the school 
auditorium stage by the teachers, separately, and one com- 
plete rehearsal is held the afternoon preceding the perform- 
ance. This minimizes the labor of preparation and keeps 
the program representative of the school work about as 
much as is possible. The school fair or bazaar, often used 
to make money, represents the opposite. It is not typical 
of the school work, is burdensome on the teachers and prin- 
cipal and janitor, and does not give the parents any proper 
conception of the school as an educational institution. 
As a means of awakening school spirit and loyalty on the 
part of the pupils the pay entertainment to raise money for 
some good school purpose doubtless exceeds in value the free 
exhibition of the school’s work, because it develops team 
work and a group coéperation for success much better than 
does the free-exhibition type. It also probably awakens 
more interest in the school on the part of many parents. 
The clientele of a school, though, will determine to a marked 
degree the nature of the entertainment, free or paid, which 
ean be undertaken with a good chance of success. In 
schools where the children come from the homes of the poor 
and the foreign-born, very simple and free affairs are best; 
with children coming from “the spoiled darling” type of 
homes such simple free affairs will not prove very satisfac- 
tory, and more elaborate entertainments will be necessary. 
3. Inter-school contests 
Value of if properly controlled. Competitive contests 
between different schools of the same school system, as 
between different groups in the same school, are almost 
certain to develop where playground sports are practiced.
-P-A-G-E-560

Whether they are made useful as a teaching institution and 
influence properly the life of the schools, or otherwise, will 
depend much upon how they are organized and handled. 
If well managed they are productive of much good. They 
help to deyelop a strong school spirit that can be turned to 
account in getting other and less interesting things done. 
They can be made effective instruments in teaching self- 
control, in inculcating ideas of fair play and sportsmanlike 
conduct, and in training pupils to be good losers. For the 
boy and girl of mediocre intellectual ability they offer often 
the only chance to rise to any position of importance in the 
life of the school. On the other hand, when poorly managed 
they develop inter-school rivalry and jealousy that often 
leads to fighting, unsportsmanlike conduct in the games, 
and even to antagonisms between teachers in the different 
schools. 
Whether or not there are to be inter-school contests is 
to be decided almost wholly on the ground of results they 
give. In American schools these contests do not have to be 
stimulated. They are the most highly motivated activities 
wehave. What is needed is guidance and restraint, and the 
direction of the sport impulse into good channels. Like 
almost any other highly useful instrument for service, 
if not looked after carefully it gives very undesirable re- 
sults. If the right kind of supervision and control is given 
_to the inter-class and inter-school contests they form excel- 
lent tools for the development of fine manly qualities in the 
pupils. No people have secured better results with sports 
in this respect than have the English. Without the right 
type of supervision and control these contests are almost 
certain to bring harm to the pupils and to the school. 
Rightly handled they offer an excellent opportunity to work 
off surplus energy that otherwise would find an outlet in 
ways that might be injurious to the school.
-P-A-G-E-561
  EXTRA SCHOOL ACTIVITIES 545 
While a help in developing school spirit, a good means of 
physical education, and a source of pleasure to many, all 
this should be held subordinate to the question of proper 
control with a view to character development. The con- 
tests should teach fair play, clean sport, an appreciation of 
good work, and develop self-control and an abjlity to lose 
without ugliness. 
An opportunity to teach important lessons. The develop- 
ment of a sportsmanlike attitude on the part of both teach- 
ers and pupils is important, and no one can do more to 
further this than can the principal. By a talk in the school 
assembly on fairness and courtesy to the teams they are to 
meet, by stimulating others to talk on the conduct of a 
manly game, by cautioning the pupils to avoid “rough-hous- 
ing” and “mud slinging,” even if started by their oppo- 
nents, and by setting clearly before the school the type of 
conduct that is expected of both the contestants and the 
bleachers, he can do much to build up a right attitude that 
will carry over into school work long after the contest has 
passed. To win a game fairly and manfully or else lose it 
ought to be the ideal of every school. Sometimes the teach- 
ers need as much cautioning as the pupils, since in their de- 
sire for victory for their school they sometimes exercise less 
judgment than do the pupils. Often the parents who attend 
are even worse partisans than the teachers. 
Rules for handling inter-school contests. All inter- 
school contests need careful supervision. They areas much 
opportunities for teaching as are the classrooms, and a prin- 
cipal will save himself much trouble if he keeps a firm hand 
on the whole situation. The following regulations are usu- 
ally desirable ones to enforce: f 
1. The contests should always be managed by representatives 
from the schools, and no games should be permitted to be 
matched without the presence of such representatives.  
-P-A-G-E-562
  546 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
2. Unless there is a playground director who has charge of the 
sports, the principal or some teacher should have charge and 
go with the team when games are played. 
8. The school, principal, and teachers, must let the pupils en- 
gaged win or lose the games, and must give to them as large 
a share as is possible in the direction and control of the games 
without leaving them unsupervised. 
4. The principal must always reserve the right to choose or ap- 
prove of the players, and to advise the captains as to their 
choice. Standards as to attendance and conduct and school 
work may properly be set up and enforced. 
5. To reduce dissatisfaction to a minimum, care should be taken 
to secure responsible and competent officials for the contest. 
6. The rules as to time limits should be enforced. 
7. In traveling to and from the contest the contestants should 
go in a body, and under the supervision of the principal or 
some teacher. 
8. The dressing rooms and showers used should be supervised. 
9. It is not best to carry competition with any one school to the 
point where rivalry becomes intense; it is better to contest 
with a number of different schools instead. 
10. Contests with schools outside the city should ordinarily not be 
permitted to elementary school pupils. 
Handled in this way there is not much chance of things 
going wrong, provided the sports be kept clearly in the ama- 
teur class and free from the highly technical professional 
class that makes such an appeal to high school students. 
The sports are worth their cost in the chances they offer 
for improving conduct and building up sportsmanlike atti- 
tudes. They unify a school as few other things do, and they 
put forward the idea of selection on the basis of ability to do 
rather than on any other standard. The girls need more en- 
couragement to play games than do the boys, and for both 
boys and girls as many different children as can play should 
be encouraged to compete. As the children come to school 
without the traditions of good sportsmanship, the school 
.can render good service in training young people in the 
elements — manliness, courtesy, confidence, courage, fair 
play — that go to make up this important characteristic. _

  CHAPTER XXVII 
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 
_The new school-and-home organization movement. The 
school, the home, and the church stand as the three great. 
constructive agencies of society for moulding the next gen- 
eration along desired lines. The nature of our form of gov- 
ernment makes any close codperation between the public 
school and the church impossible, but between the school 
and the home there can and should be the closest codpera- 
tion and the most perfect understanding. This desirable 
condition can of course never be perfectly attained, and in 
different communities it will exist in all degrees from close 
and sympathetic understanding to almost no understand- 
ing at all. That sympathy and codperation are desirable, 
from the point of view of both the school and the home, is 
generally recognized. How to get them while retaining to 
each its proper sphere of action is not always an easy ques- 
tion to answer. . 
With the increasing intelligence of the home, the coming: 
of more leisure generally, and the extension of the suffrage 
to women, it has been but natural that the mothers of the 
children should direct new attention to the school with a 
view to a better understanding of its work and a greater co- 
operation with it in what it is attempting to do for their 
children. In consequence there has arisen in this country, 
within the past two or three decades, a number of organiza- « 
tions and movements which have for their purpose a closer 
affiliation of the home and the school. These have taken 
form under a. variety of names— Home and School 
Leagues, School and Civic Leagues, Child Study Clubs, 
Special Committees of Women’s Clubs, Patrons’ Leagues, 
 
-P-A-G-E-565
  
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 549 
Fathers’ Clubs, Parent-Teacher Associations, and Mothers’ 
Clubs — but their general purpose has been much the same. 
Next to the board of education these organizations stand 
closer to the school than any other official or non-official 
body, and they should form an intimate link connecting 
the home and the school. The organization which has at- 
.tained the largest membership, and the only one to become 
national in scope, is the Parent-Teacher movement, spon- 
sored by the National Congress of Mothers and Parent- 
Teacher Associations. This organization now has branches 
in nearly every state, over half a million members (1922), 
and is increasing in membership at a very rapid rate. It 
promises to become general within a short time, and is an or- 
ganization of large possibilities for usefulness when its ener- 
gies are directed into proper channels. With its purposes 
and possibilities and plans for work every school principal 
should be familiar. 
Any such organization represents an interest in the school 
and an impulse toward constructive work. Just what it will 
succeed in doing will depend much on the intelligence with 
which it is directed, and the information and guidance given 
to it by those who know what is needed. Such associations 
in some form are almost certain to rise wherever there are 
schools. If largely ignored by teachers and school authori- 
ties and left to their own resources they will find their own 
work. Just what this will be will be determined largely by 
the’energy and the character of the knowledge as to what 
ought to be attempted which the organization possesses. 
Like every other form of organization that is an expression 
of our democratic life, if rightly guided it can be made useful 
and helpful; if left to its own resources it can become a med- 
dlesome nuisance to the school. 
When to organize an Association. Whether a principal 
or a superintendent will want to try to organize a Parent- 
 
-P-A-G-E-566
  550 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Teacher Association will depend somewhat on conditions 
in the community. If the town or city is already over- 
organized with churches, lodges, and clubs, it probably 
will be better to try to do what is needed by working 
through committees of existing organizations. There are 
after all only about so many leaders in any community, and, 
if the energies of these are absorbed in existing organizations, 
-an additional and less prominent organization may bring to 
the front only a group of poorly balanced but energetic souls 
who have failed to secure advancement in the older and 
more general community undertakings. Such a Parent- 
Teacher Association is likely to prove troublesome and hard 
to handle because of its lack of good leaders. In such a case 
it would be better to try to work through educational com- 
mittees of the Women’s Club, the Rotary Club, or the 
Chamber of Commerce, and to leave the educational direc- 
tion of these club activities more to the central school au- 
thorities to handle. 
As soon, though, as a school begins to interest its parents 
in the work its teachers are doing, and to have special school 
occasions which awaken interest, a demand for some form 
of a school organization analogous to a Parent-Teacher As- 
sociation is sure to arise among the patrons of the school. 
When it does, the principal and teachers should codperate 
fully with the movement, try to secure a good organization 
for it, strive to make its meetings profitable, and plan to 
keep it so busy on constructive undertakings that it will 
have little time or desire to engage in those of another type. 
All such organizations ought to come into being as the re- 
sult of a need felt for association. When they arise they 
need real leadership, which the principal may for a time 
have to supply. Like the school assembly, the playground, 
inter-school contests, and pupil organizations to assist in 
management, the Parent-Teacher Associations can be made
-P-A-G-E-567
  
  THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 551 
useful instruments for school ends if given attention, and if 
neglected can build up troubles for a principal and superin- 
tendent which will be both vexatious and time-consuming. 
Troublesome organizations. The trouble with so many 
troublesome so-called Parent-Teacher Associations is that 
they are not parent-teacher associations at all, but merely 
parents’ associations. Too often the parents desire to meet 
and coéperate, but the teachers, feeling that they have done 
their fair share of school work for the day, do not remain, 
and in consequence neglect their best opportunity to meet 
and know the parents of their children. They likewise neg- 
lect an important opportunity to help shape their thinking 
and their opinion of the school. While the avowed aim of 
such meetings is to bring the home and the school into closer 
relations, that greater things may be done for the children, 
the teachers, and sometimes the principal as well, leave the 
building and the meeting is forced to fall back on its own re- 
sources. Far too often a few over-zealous persons, lacking 
real knowledge, turn critic of the existing conditions and 
those responsible for them, and set up new goals for educa- 
tion that are both undesirable and unattainable. 
If a principal can organize a Parent-Teacher Association 
from the start he can, if tactful, shape the organization and 
direct it at once into useful lines of service. It is not willful- 
ness, but ignorance of what to do, that causes parents’ organ- 
izations to give trouble. A principal coming to a build- 
ing may inherit an association that has been neglected and 
gone wrong. In such a case the first thing for him and 
his teachers to do is to get into close touch with the or- 
ganization and make of it a real Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tion, both in the social part and in the program part of the 
meeting. The leaders, especially, are to be gotten ac- 
quainted with, the program committee interested, and the 
work of the organization gradually diverted into new chan-
-P-A-G-E-568
552 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
nels. It is redirection, not criticism, that is needed. It is 
much the same problem as that of helping a weak teacher, 
but with the difference that the principal should here at- 
tempt no exercise of authority. He is now only a member 
of a group, and he will be wise to remain somewhat in the 
background. As a properly organized Parent-Teacher As- 
sociation always makes the principal a member of the man- 
aging committee, he has a good opportunity to help direct 
the organization without seeming to do so or being too 
prominent in the meetings. By attending the meetings 
along with his teachers, helping with the programs, taking 
part in the discussion, and accepting every challenge as an 
opportunity for enlightenment, much can be done by way 
of redirection that will be very valuable. 
One principal known to the writer, inheriting such an as- 
sociation, accepted an invitation to address the first meet- 
ing. He outlined to them something of the great work of an 
American public school and the help that parents could 
give, said in closing that there were doubtless many ques- 
tions they would like to ask which time did not then permit 
to be answered, and proposed a question-box for the future 
meetings. The proposal was adopted at once, and for the 
next three meetings there were more questions, mostly of a 
critical nature, than could be answered. The following are 
illustrative: 
Why don’t you teach reading by the alphabet method? 
Why do you place so much emphasis on tardiness? 
Why do you not have more book work in geography, and not so 
much of this home geography? 
Why don’t you teach arithmetic in the first grade? 
Of what use is your so-called nature study? 
Why does the school waste money on teaching cooking, and in 
furnishing baseballs and bats? 
Why don’t you stop fighting? 
Why do we have part-time instruction in the first and second 
grades?
-P-A-G-E-569
  
  THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 553 
Why don’t the teachers teach the children in school instead of ex- 
pecting the parents to do it at home? 
Why do you punish one child for something and let another off 
free for the same offense? 
These were all legitimate questions which represented in- 
terest and ignorance, and each gave an opportunity for en- 
lightenment. The principal answered many of the ques- 
tions, but asked some of the teachers to answer others. 
When the question “‘ What are the policies of this school sys- 
tem anyway?’ came, the principal proposed that the super- 
intendent of schools be invited to come and talk to them in 
answer to that question. This was readily accepted, with 
excellent results. Before the year had gone by, the associa- 
tion was clearly in the process of transformation from a 
critical body of small usefulness into an organization help- 
ful to the schools. What the organization was suffering 
from was neglect and ignorance, and the energy which led 
to its inception was being turned into destructive channels. 
Need for a constructive program of work. Every such 
organization needs a worthy outlet for its activities, and the 
best way to reform a troublesome Parent-Teacher Associa- 
tion, 4s has been said before, is to set it to work on some- 
thing useful. Many times such an organization will ask a 
principal what he wants done, or what it ought todo. This 
is his opportunity, and he ought to be ready to answer the 
question. 
There are two main types of work which these associa- 
tions may undertake with profit to the schools and to them- 
selves. The first is in doing something needed by the school, 
and the second is in improving their own knowledge of 
school conditions and child needs by arranging meetings at 
which they will study or be told something of interest and 
value. The principal, when called on, should be able to ad- 
vise as to a number of the most possible and helpful lines of 
   
-P-A-G-E-570
554 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
effort, of both types, that a particular association may well 
undertake. 
For the first type of work, there should always be some- 
thing concrete for the organization to do — something to be 
provided which the school needs, or some new service for the 
children that calls for codperative effort. To get the school 
a victrola, a picture machine, playground apparatus, in- 
struments for the school orchestra, test blanks, shrubs and 
trees for Arbor Day, or anything that is difficult to obtain 
through the regular channels represents one type of con- 
structive effort. Women have a peculiar genius for this 
kind of work and are happy in doing it. It does much to 
make them strong supporters of the school. 
The organization of school lunches, the provision of shoes 
and clothing and food for needy children, the furnishing of 
dental service or a school nurse, or the backing of the re- 
quests of the school authorities for better provisions for the 
children represent a still better type of service, and one that 
is more useful than raising money for school needs that the 
public ought to supply. The same amount of energy, agita- 
tion, and persistent effort that money-raising for school 
needs requires, if directed toward the formation of a public 
sentiment in favor of higher taxes that the school may be 
provided with all needed equipment, will produce larger re- 
turns, leave the community in a better state of mind toward 
its schools, and free the energies of the Parent-Teacher Asso- 
ciation for more useful service. 
For the second type of activity there should be a group of 
topics of interest which can be taken up, and which will lead 
to better information as to what should be done both for 
the children and for the school. 
Meetings, and types of work. The best results with 
these organizations have usually been obtained from meet- 
ings held once a month at the school building, the program
-P-A-G-E-571
  
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 555 
usually beginning a very few minutes after the school dis- 
missal. It is common to begin the meetings with a short 
program in which some school activity is shown, and which 
the teachers or the principal are called upon to provide. 
In all such work it is best to remember the cautions stated 
in the preceding chapter, use group or class activities 
rather than single-pupil activities, and keep what is _pre- 
sented as representative of school work as can be done. It 
is customary to adjourn the formal program at the end of an 
hour. After this a period of social intercourse should be pro- 
vided. Frequently some light refreshments are served by 
the domestic science class or the eighth-grade girls, either 
just before or just after the formal program, though many 
successful association meetings are held without any such 
service. 
As to the program, there are dozens of things that may be 
done, though just what would be best to do in one school 
might not be best in another. A few suggestions may be 
made to indicate possible lines of effort. 
I. Things that may be done for the school. The following 
are possible and desirable things for most communities: 
. Furnish materials for the first-aid cabinets and sick room. 
2. Supply money for purchasing food for undernourished chil- 
dren. : 
8. Establish and manage warm lunches in the schools. 
4. Supply musical instruments for the school orchestra. 
5. Equip the auditorium with a lantern, or a moving-picture 
machine. 
6. Provide funds for renting slides or reels. 
7. Make a home-conditions survey of the district.

. Provide shoes and clothing for needy children. 
. Provide a school or a visiting nurse. 
10. Provide for a dental clinic for the children. 
11. Back the Junior Red Cross in its work. 
12. Back the Boy Scouts and the Camp Fire Girls in their work. 
13. Provide a good teachers’ room in the building.

. Purchase a few good pictures or busts for the school. 
. Conduct a campaign for better sanitary conditions in the build- 
ings, and larger and better equipped playgrounds for the chil- 
dren. 
Provide for a summer kindergarten and school playground. 
Institute a strong home movement for simpler school dress, 
better social activities, and improved amusements for the 
children. : 
Establish a censorship of the “Movies,” with a view to pro- 
tecting the children from bad films. 
Establish school savings banks, and teach children how to use 
money and leisure intelligently. 
Study the needs and policies of the school system as a whole, 
and back legitimate demands for school bond issues and in- 
creased school taxes. 
II. Talks that may be arranged. Every such organiza- 
tion needs to be told many things that will give them a bet- 
ter insight into the newer phases of education. The follow- 
ing are types of talks that may be made helpful: oe

Senn . The school nurse, on child feeding and care. 
. The domestic science teacher, on lunches and feeding, 
. The primary supervisor, on phases of primary work. 
. The principal, on problems of pupil administration. 
A dentist, on care of the teeth. 
A nose, throat, and ear specialist, on the hygiene of thege or- 
gans. 
A social worker, on community needs.

. A play teacher, on the play needs of children. 
.. The school nurse, on first-aid work and supplies.’ 
One school of which the writer knows holds a useful but 
somewhat different type of parents’ meeting at least once 
each year. Just after the reports go out, at the end of the 
first ten weeks, the teachers hold a parents’ conference, in 
their individual classrooms, to which the parents of all the 
children are invited to come. By this time the school has 
become fairly well acquainted with its children, and the 
teachers now suggest ways in which the parents can be of
-P-A-G-E-573
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 557 
assistance to the school in its work, such as seeing that the 
boys and girls are kept in school regularly, that their attend- 
ance at movies be restricted, that they have the proper 
amount of sleep, and that the parents give them a desirable 
kind of help and encouragement without doing their work 
for them. These meetings have proved helpful in promot- 
ing understanding, and have contributed toward keeping 
down retardation in this school. 
The national Parent-Teacher Association organization 
has recently organized a division for the study of problems 
that relate to child welfare before the school age — baby 
clinics, child-welfare work, infant care and feeding, child 
discipline, and early education — that promises much of 
value for both home and school. It is known as The Pre- 
School-Age Mothers’ Study Circle, and is intended to be a 
junior organization that will become a feeder of mothers into 
the Parent-Teacher Associations. This organization, too, 
considers the schoolhouse as a background and its proper 
meeting place, and the school kindergarten teachers and 
nurses and physicians as its supporters and instructors. 
This, too, a principal may be called upon to aid and encour- 
age, and if so he should do it willingly. If he will carefully 
read Gesell’s The Pre-School Child he will be better able to 
give intelligent aid. 
Working through these organizations. Some form of par- 
ents’ association is a natural development of the present- 
day interest of the American people in the education of their 
children. When they are started, principals and teachers 
should keep in close touch with them, that they may neither 
die early of inanition or become troublesome because their 
energies are misdirected. The policies of the school and the 
school system ought to be explained to them, that their sup- 
port may be enlisted. In the last analysis it is public opin- 
ion that controls and limits school progress, and the Parent-
-P-A-G-E-574
  558 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
Teacher Associations are potent influences in the formation 
of public opinion. 
A live principal, awake to his opportunities, will prefer to 
work in a school where there is a strong, active, and intelli- 
gent Parent-Teacher Association to working in one where 
the parents have not enough interest in the schools to form 
one, or keep it alive after it is formed. This organization 
offers opportunities for increasing the influence of the school 
and for building up school support that do not exist where 
these associations are lacking. The legitimate interest of 
the parent in the school is enlisted, recognized, and re- 
spected. Parents come to feel the sincerity of the teachers 
and their genuine interest in their children. Better results 
in instruction and discipline are obtained. Improved sani- 
tary conditions almost invariably result. Play needs are 
recognized. Tardiness and absence decrease. There is a 
better understanding of school aims and school policies, be- 
cause the people are kept closer to the schools. As an an- 
chor to windward when trouble arises, or as a reliance for 
support in carrying through progressive school policies, 
there are few possible sources of backing superior to that of 
an intelligently directed and well-informed Parent-Teacher 
Association. Asa phase of the constructive administra- 
tive policy of a board of education and a superintendent of 
schools it would be well to have such an association in con- 
nection with every school in the city. In carrying out such 
a school-and-home codperative policy the superintendent 
must rely largely on the intelligent assistance of the princi- 
pal and teachers of each-school building.

  CHAPTER XXVIII 
THE PRINCIPAL AS A LEADER IN THE PROFESSION 
His duty in leadership. In the two chapters which have 
preceded this final one the place and work of the principal 
in developing good community relationships and in helping 
carry out in his community the administrative policies of 
the school system have been indicated. However good the 
policy of the board of education or the superintendent of 
schools, it may largely be negatived in any school district 
within a city or a county-unit school system by the wrong 
action or lack of action of the principal and teachers of that 
particular school. ‘As is the principal so is the school” is 
as true here as elsewhere. The principal virtually decides 
the fate in his school of many constructive policies of the 
authorities above him. 
Just as the school cannot to-day remain in isolation and 
apart from the people and life of the community which sur- 
rounds and supports it, but must assume its share of re- 
sponsibility for the community attitudes toward it and for 
the educational progress of the school system as a whole, so 
the principal of a school cannot realize his largest efficiency 
if he is content to be merely the leader of his single school, 
however good a leader he may be. He owes a duty also to 
the educational profession, both within the community in 
which he works and to a certain extent in the state and na- 
__tion-as well, The same student-like qualities which have 
been emphasized throughout this volume as so important 
for the principal in his school should extend over into the 
principals’ meetings which the superintendent holds, and 
into all local discussions of questions of general educational 
interest. Without being always on his feet or making him-
-P-A-G-E-577
THE PRINCIPAL AS A LEADER 561 
self too prominent, he should take his proper place and play 
his proper part in the principals’ meetings and in the pro- 
fessional meetings of the teachers of his city or county. Out- 
side he also owes a much more limited but no less certain 
duty as an upholder of professional standards, and as one 
deeply interested in the advancement of the work to which 
he is giving the best energies of his life. 
The professional spirit. Perhaps the matter of first im- 
portance for the principal who would be a leader in his pro- 
fession is that he become fully imbued with the professional 
spirit. He must see, more clearly than those around him, 
the great spiritual importance of the work in which he is en- 
gaged. Probably no service that one person renders to an- 
other compares in importance with the proper educational 
development of the boy and the girl. In a democratic na- 
tion such as ours, public education is the greatest of all our 
undertakings for the promotion of our national welfare, and 
the teacher in our schools renders an inconspicuous but 
highly important national service. In teaching the youth of 
our nation the principles which lie at the foundation of our 
democratic life; in awakening in them the conception of lib- 
erty guided by law, and the difference between freedom and 
| license; in training them for self-control; in developing in 
them the power to shoulder responsibility; in giving them a 
sense of the greatness of that democratic nobility in which 
all may share; in instilling into them the importance of fidel- 
ity to duty, truth, honor, and virtue; in arousing in them a 
desire to be clean and strong, both in mind and body; and in 
unifying diverse elements and fusing them into the national 
mould, the teachers in our schools are rendering a service sel- 
dom appreciated and not likely to be overestimated. 
The principal needs to grasp firmly these conceptions as | 
to the great importance of the service in which he is en- 
gaged. His is not a small local but a great national service,    
-P-A-G-E-578
  562 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
yearly becoming more and more clearly recognized as public 
education comes to be understood by more and more of our 
people as the greatest constructive undertaking of the na- 
tion. Above all the petty trials of the day, the discourage- 
ments that are bound to come, and the short-sighted and 
often highly critical attitude of his teachers, he should see 
and feel clearly, and strive to keep alive in others, his fun- 
damental faith in the vast importance of what they all are 
doing. If the parents of his children do not see that it is 
more important to “train the mind than to mind the train” 
he must do his part, by the life he leads, the service he ren- 
ders, the stands he takes, and what he says when speech is 
the proper thing, to lead his people to see the importance of 
the work of the school and to respect the services and the 
devotion of those who give their lives to the training of 
the generation that is to follow. The mere fact that the 
mass of mankind does not fully appreciate the services of 
the teacher, and places higher values on less important com- 
munity services, presents him his opportunity rather than 
being a cause for discouragement. 
The professional spirit has its basis in knowledge. Such 
large conceptions as to the nature and importance of the 
work in which they are engaged come mostly to the men and ,, 
women who are masters of their calling, and this results not 
so much from genius as from right attitudes, perseverance, 
concentration, and hard work. The man who decides where 
he wants to go and why he wants to go there, who embraces 
the opportunities that lead in that direction and rejects those 
that do not, will, given ordinary average ability, some day 
reach his goal. He will also be proud of the profession he 
is in. 
Leadership in any field involves a broad fundamental 
knowledge of the work in which the man is engaged. Super- 
ficial information will not suffice. The principal who would 
become a leader in education must have built up by reading
-P-A-G-E-579
THE PRINCIPAL AS A LEADER 5638 
and study and observation and thinking a good clear philos- 
ophy of the educational process, and be deeply impressed 
with the conception of the improvability and advancement 
of the race by means of education. He must also be able 
to think through and beyond the current practices of his 
profession, and see the possibilities of doing things differ- 
ently and in a larger and a better way. 
To this end the principal ought to be a leader in profes- 
sional improvement, not only as it relates to his own work in 
_ his own school, but also through his influence with those 
with whom he works. As was pointed out in Chapter II, 
the principalship is a student’s opportunity, and one far too 
seldom realized, speaking generally, by the principals now 
in service in our schools. By personal reading and study, 
by attendance at the summer sessions of colleges and univer- 
sities, by trying out new methods and procedures, by mak- 
ing numerous little studies, by being sure he has something 
to say and to give when he talks before parents and at in- 
stitutes, and by the contribution of short articles from time 
to time to professional magazines and educational gather- 
ings, a man or woman who works and thinks is almost cer- 
tain to be looked up to as a leader and to become conscious 
of growth in knowledge and power to do. They come to 
think in terms of a personal philosophy for and definite 
knowledge as to the educational process, and learn to plan 
for and do things that to many would seem impossible. 
Marks of the professional leader. A recent writer on ed- 
ucational leadership, writing in one of our professional mag- 
azines, characterized this ability to think through an idea, 
work it out clearly, and reduce it to such written form that 
it influences others and moulds procedure elsewhere as the 
first indication of developing professional leadership. Such 
a person is well on the way to becoming a leader in the pro- 
fession. Without this ability to think things through in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-580
ee eae 
564 THE PRINCIPAL AND HIS SCHOOL 
light of sound knowledge, and to organize one’s thinking in 
simple but concrete form, one is not likely to rise to emi- 
nence in the educational profession. 
To impress one’s ability for leadership on others, though, 
ealls for certain other important characteristics. The 
writer referred to enumerated four others, the first of which 
was the ability to stand on one’s feet and speak fairly well. 
A principal should embrace the many opportunities that 
come to him to express in simple form the concrete thinking 
which he does. Usually if he has ideas words will come; his 
work will then be to improve the manner of his presentation. 
Many schoolmen would be greatly benefited if they were to 
take a course in public speaking in some of the summer 
schools which they attend, and give some attention to prac- 
tice which will improve their enunciation and platform pres- 
ence and eliminate objectionable mannerisms. 
For the three other marks of an educational leader, which 
the writer gave, we cannot do better than quote what he 
wrote: 
  There is a third attribute of leaders that is universal and not con- 
fined to the field of education. This is that all leaders are mentally 
active. They are always-restlessly moving on to new thoughts, 
new acts, new methods of work. No one can exercise leadership 
through inertia. 
Along with the mental activity of a leader goes intellectual cour- 
age. A leader is characteristically willing to take a chance. The 
man who always plays safe stays still, or follows. He doesnot lead. 
Another characteristic, essential to educati leadership, and 
usually necessary in other sorts, is the ability to get along well with 
people. The Spaniards call this quality the don de gentes, or the gift 
of the people, and they recognize it as being as definitely a personal 
trait as eloquence, perseverance, or accuracy. This ability to get 
along well with other people is one which the educational leader 
must possess, and one he must not confuse with its counterfeit, 
which is being a professional mixer, or its imitation, which is being 
a glad hander. 
The five attributes that have been described constitute, I be-
-P-A-G-E-581
  
THE PRINCIPAL AS A LEADER 565 
lieve, the fundamental essentials for educational leadership. Edu- 
cation for leadership largely means education for ability along these 
five lines, and, in the main, this means self-education.! 
Maintenance of professional standards. The principal 
also owes a duty to his profession in the support of leader- 
ship in the organizations of the profession, and in the main- 
tenance of professional standards. While individual prog- 
ress may be made in isolation, it is in organization that pro- 
fessional progress is made. Man expresses himself best 
through the organized institutions of society. In education 
there are local, state, and national organizations that are im- 
portant for him to be more or less connected with and to 
which he ought to give his support. In the teachers’ insti- 
tutes of his city or county he ought to be willing to put his 
shoulder to the wheel and do his full part. The state teach- 
ers’ associations, despite their many defects, are on the 
whole rendering a valuable service in advancing professional 
interests and standards and promoting useful educational 
legislation. The hope for sound educational progress 
through legislation must lie almost wholly within the teach- 
ing profession, and it is important that those in a position to 
lead be well informed and actuated by sound professional 
motives. 
In the matter of the ethics of his profession the principal 
also owes a duty‘analogous to that of a judge on the bench to 
the law, a leader in medical practice to medicine, or a minis- 
ter to the ethics of a Christian life. In his relations with 
the school officers over him, with his colleagues in the work 
in which he is’ engaged, and with the teachers and pupils 
whose work he oversees and directs, he owes it to. his pro- 
fession to embody in his speech and actions the best ethics 
of the profession to which he is devoting his life.

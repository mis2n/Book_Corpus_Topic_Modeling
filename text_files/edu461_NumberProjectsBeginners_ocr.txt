  PREFACE 
Turs little book presents a series of number 
projects for primary grades. The projects 
have been worked out by the first grades in 
the State Normal College, Oxford, Ohio, in 
the Elementary School of the University of 
Chicago, and in the State Normal School at 
Dillon, Montana. The work was initiated for 
the most part by the children in connection 
with their interests and activities in and out of 
school. The projects are so arranged as to 
provide for an easy progression in the develop- 
ment of concepts in beginning number. 
Throughout the book the aim has been to 
arouse a consciousness and appreciation of the 
quantitative side of every-day experiences. 
In attempting to realize this aim an effort has 
been made: (1) To build up a body of mathe- 
matical imagery that is comparable to the 
body of language imagery acquired before the 
formal study of reading is begun; (2) to

vi PREFACE 
make clear simple quantitative relations as 
the child meets them in his own problems; 
(3) to awaken an appreciation of the value and 
need of units of measure for length, weight, 
time, or cost; (4) to secure a grasp of the 
essential number facts needed by the child for 
his specific purposes; and (5) to give social 
insight into the quantitative side of commu- 
nity life. « 
The early number experiences of children 
seem to be a more or less confused mass of 
ideas and feelings about objects and activities. 
But as one situation after another is singled 
out of this “big buzzing confusion” and given 
meaning and significance, the child’s number 
percepts are clarified and enlarged. Ideas but 
vaguely sensed at first gradually acquire 
significance and value as they are seen to 
function in situation after situation. Thus 
there is built up a large body of mathematical 
experiences that form a background and give a 
basis for the later and more formal study of 
number. This principle is similar to the one 
used in teaching beginning reading. Before

the child is introduced to word forms and 
symbols in reading he has acquired a large 
meaning vocabulary through the use he has 
made of language before entering the begin- 
ning reading class. Thus the printed or 
written word is a symbol for an idea or con- 
cept which is not only familiar, but rich in 
associations built up through the repeated 
experiences with the same word or idea. The 
authors of this little book are convinced that 
the child should, in a like manner, gain a fa- 
miliarity with simple number facts and rela- 
tions before beginning work with the formal 
symbols of number. 
Realizing that “‘it is not the mere percep- 
tion of things that gives the idea, but the em- 
ploying of things in a constructive way,” care 
has been taken to include only those situations 
that appeal to the child in response to his 
conscious needs. The projects for the most 
part have been initiated by the interests and 
activities of the home, the school, and the 
neighborhood. They include (1) such social 
plays ag storekeeping, gardening, cooking, and
-P-A-G-E-10
  viii PREFACE 
other imitations of adult life; and (2) such 
competitive group games as grow out of the 
various projects. The games serve to make 
the acquisition\of the new number facts more 
permanent and to develop skill in their appli- 
cation. 
While the text describes in detail the method 
of procedure, attention is called to the pro- 
vision for experimentation and testing out by 
the group of all suggestions and conclusions 
accepted by the class. If these were found 
inadequate or if other difficulties were dis- 
covered, further study was given the situ- 
ation with perhaps a few questions by the 
teacher that focalized the special problems 
barring the way to the goal sought. 
In thus selecting, testing, and using number 
facts as they function in particular situations, 
the child gets an early training in problem’ 
solving and in thinking. As in the kinder- 
garten the child plays with number, so in the 
first grade this play element entered into all 
the work. The children played with the new 
facts learned or the new skill acquired. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  PREFACE ix 
example, when the ruler was first introduced 
the children wished to measure everything— 
desks, books, window-sills, each other, the 
teacher, the floor, and everything having 
linear dimensions. After learning to count by 
twos, fives, and tens, these new ‘‘counts” were 
used for scores in games. This type of play 
continued at times for days until, tiring of it, 
the group showed a readiness and disposition 
for a more productive use of the new knowl- 
edge. 
Though it was not the desire or the inten- 
tion of the authors to formulate a course of 
study for the first grade, it was found that by 
allowing the children to work out their own 
projects the following results were attained: 
J. Number Facts and Relations: 
To count by 1’s, 2’s, 10’s, 5’s. 
To group objects, as two 3’s; four 2’s. 
To separate large quantities into smaller, as 
20—four 5’s. 
To recognize relation and value of cent, 
nickel, dime, quarter, half-dollar, and 
dollar. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
PREFACE 
To write numbers from 1 to 100. 
To recognize and use inch, foot, yard. 
To know the relation of inch to foot, and 
foot to yard. 
To tell time and count minutes in half, 
quarter, and hour. 
To recognize and use pint, quart. 
To count change for amounts between nickel 
and half-dollar. 
To use twenty of the 45 additive combina- 
tions. 
To recognize 14, 44, 4. 
To know meaning of =, —, +. 
To know meaning of terms measure, add, 
subtract, radius, circle, diameter, triangle, 
square, oblong. 
II. Habits, Skills: 
Initiative in handling material in experi- 
mental ways. 
Ability to discriminate longer and shorter; 
heavier and lighter; narrow and wide. 
Familiarity with standard units of measure 
—inch, foot, yard, pint, quart, minute,

Familiarity with specialized vocabulary, as 
measure, count, change, add, divide, fold, 
overlap, equals, take from, less, subtract, 
allow, weigh, price, circle maker, dimen- 
sion, estimate, names of numbers from 1 
to 20. 
III. Attitudes: 
Feeling that number is a means of expressing 
ideas in a definite way. 
Feeling that standard units of measurements 
aid in giving more definite value to quan- 
tity. 
Independence and initiative in experiment- 
ing with number in social plays imitative 
of adult activities.

indebtedness and to express their appre- 
ciation for the valuable suggestions and help

NUMBER PROJECTS FOR 
BEGINNERS 
CHAPTER I 
NUMBER WORK IN THE KINDERGAR- 
TEN OR PRE-PRIMARY GRADES 
THERE is no formal number work in the 
kindergarten or pre-primary classes. ‘The use 
of number is entirely incidental, growing out 
of the needs and experiences of the children, 
who by means of these experiences enter first 
grade knowing much of number language. 
Though there is no attempt in the kindergar- 
ten or pre-primary classes to fix facts concern- 
ing number, yet the use as they are needed 
renders them familiar for later use in first 
grade. 
When a need for number arises in the kinder- 
garten, for example, as when a child attempts 
to count the number of flowers in bloom in the 
window-box, the teacher seizes the occasion to

help him. She allows no opportunity to pass 
unheeded for the use of numbers. Through 
many and varied first-hand experiences and 
through a feeling of need, the children begin 
to sense number. Thus though the number 
work is incidental, it is not accidental, yet it is 
never imposed. 
“Tdeas may grow out of the children’s 
handling of material. Problems are suggested 
and formulated because of discoveries of the 
possibilities of material.”+ In a certain 
kindergarten one child found a peg board in 
the cupboard and counted the holes to dis- 
cover how many rows of pegs she could put in 
it. She then put in two rows each of different 
colors and counted to see how many colors she 
had. She then put one row of one color and 
two of another alternately and counted her 
colors. She had some help by the teacher as 
she asked for it. 
“The children may formulate problems 
suggested by some present interest or some

Education. See eee reas

past experience which may be related to the 
subject-matter of the curriculum.” 2 
Several children in one kindergarten be- 
came interested in dividing materials among 
the group. There were five children and ten 
crayons. They found that by giving one 
around twice, each child had two. 
“The children may formulate problems to 
meet needs created by some social situation in 
the kindergarten. These too will often be sug- 
gested by the content of the curriculum.” * 
At one Hallowe’en party the children made 
favors for the children in another room. There 
were just as many as in theirown room. They 
decided that each should make one favor. 
The needs of children of kindergarten age 
usually call for such number experiences as the 
following: 
1. Simple counting by ones and twos: 
a. Counting the children present. 
b. Counting absent children. 
c. Counting materials needed.

Many other opportunities arise for the type of 
number work indicated. The types given are 
only suggestive. The projects in this book 
were worked out with children having gained 
this previous familiarity with number through 
use of number terms and facts. 
A. The Curriculum.—The curriculum, as it 
was once regarded, was a set body of subject- 
matter, divided according to what we consider
-P-A-G-E-25
NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 7 
its difficulties and complexities, to fit the dif- 
ferent grades. In this conception of curricu- 
lum we looked upon the child as a being into 
whom was poured doses of ready-made and 
sometimes patent material to fit him to “live 
and move and have his being” in a wise and 
a utilitarian adultism; we looked upon the 
school as an institution in which these doses 
were to be administered periodically in an 
atmosphere estranged from all with which the 
child had been surrounded; we looked upon 
the method as that which would secure the 
best discipline and the quickest results. 
This conception of the curriculum is rapidly 
giving place to the newer one that is based: 
upon the child’s needs. The following is.one 
of Dr. McMurry’s ‘ principles for guidance in 
making and judging such curricula: ‘The 
subject-matter for a curriculum should be 
selected from among those experiences that 
are related to life and which appeal to the 
children as directly worth while.”   
* McMurry, Teachers College Record, September, 1915. 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
  8 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
What number experiences might be selected 
which are related most nearly to the lives of 
children from six to eight, and which appeal to 
them as directly worth while? Watching them 
in their spontaneous play and in their every- 
day affairs will give us the answer. Their 
games ask for comparisons, counting, all the 
fundamental processes, keeping score—Mary 
is a faster jumper than Kate, John caught the 
ball six times, Susan played six games of jacks 
and missed only twice in each game. Susan’s 
side made 8, Anne’s made 6. Every day 
brings the children in contact with number 
experiences in company with the adults—going 
to the store, bringing back change, planning 
the cost of gifts, and, if they have an allow- 
ance, judging of possible expenditures. 
But, it will be noticed, all these experiences 
have come through the play way, through the 
arising of needs demanding satisfaction, or 
problems necessitating a solution. It will be 
noticed, too, that the driving power which 
enables the children to undertake what might 
be considered arduous tasks is interest.
-P-A-G-E-27
  NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 9 
The secret for the proper selection of mate- 
rial for the curriculum is to make the school a 
part of life, a little social community in which 
will occur situations and conditions just as 
they occur in the every-day life with which the 
children are familiar, and which they fear not 
to attack. 
Dewey 5 tells us, ‘School should be a genuine 
form of active, community life instead of a 
place set apart in which to learn lessons. It 
should work along common lines, in a common 
spirit, with reference to common aims, for 
common needs and aims demand a growing 
unity of sympathetic feeling. When the 
school introduces and trains each child of 
society into membership within such a little 
community, saturates him with the spirit of 
service, and provides him with the instrument 
of effective self-direction, we shall have the 
deepest and best guaranty of a larger society 
which is worthy, lovely, and harmonious, for 
we cannot overlook the factors of discipline 
and of character-building involved in this kind 
5 Dewey, “School and Society.”” (University of Chicago Press.)   
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  10 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
of life—training in habits of order and dis- 
cipline, the idea of responsibility, of obligation, 
to do something in the world, a feeling of real 
necessity that each should do his part faith- 
fully and in codperation with others. With 
this training, we have personalities effective 
in action, bred and tested in the medium of 
action.” 
“Tf it is true to say that we must not 
act without thinking, why is it not equally 
true to say that we must not think without 
acting ?”’ 6 
B. Value of Number in the Curriculum.— 
The principle that ‘Education is control of 
conduct” has long been accepted in theory, but 
violated in practice. Each subject in the cur- 
riculum should be a “working force in be- 
havior’’ to be of true worth. It should give to 
the child one, some, or all of the following 
values: 
1. Information or knowledge necessary 
to good health and to a wise use of 
leisure.   
6 Cook, “The Play Way.” (Frederick A. Stokes Co.)
-P-A-G-E-29
NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 11 
2. Practical efficiency—tools of civilized 
life, right habits and attitudes, 
appreciations. 
3. Ability to be a good citizen—‘‘a 
- thoroughly efficient and serviceable 
member of society, one with all his 
powers of body and mind under 
control.”’7 
We ask then, “What of these values does 
number bring to the child?” Dewey and 
McLellan * answer this for us. ‘Number is 
the tool whereby modern society in its vast 
and intricate processes of exchange introduces 
system, balance, and economy in those rela- 
tions upon which our daily life depends. 
Properly conceived and presented, neither 
geography nor history is a more efficient mode 
of bringing home to the pupil the realization of 
the social environment in which he lives than 
is arithmetic. 
“Because, in the case of number, ‘form’ 
represents the measured adjustment of means   
7 Dewey, “Moral Education.”” (Houghton Mifflin Co.) 
8 McLellan and Dewey’s “ Psychology of Number.” (D. 
Appleton & Co.)
-P-A-G-E-30
  
12 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
to ends, the rhythmical balancing of parts as a 
whole, the mastery of form represents direct- 
ness, accuracy, and economy of perception, 
the power to discriminate the relevant from 
the irrelevant, and ability to mass and con- 
verge relevant material upon a destined end 
represents, in short, precisely what we under- 
stand by good sense, good judgment, the 
power to put two and two together. 
‘Even upon its merely formal side, a study 
whichrequires exactitude, continuity, patience, 
which automatically rejects all falsification of 
data, all slovenly manipulation, which sets up 
a controlling standard of balance at every 
point, can hardly be condemned as lacking in 
the ethical element.” 
The above statements are not to be con- 
strued to advocate the doctrine of formal dis- 
cipline which would carry over the power of 
judgment and reasoning in one subject to 
every other like situation in which the child 
found himself. It must be remembered that 
arithmetic, in this curriculum, is being used in 
social situations where varying symptoms 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 13 
need to be interpreted, values weighed, and 
resourcefulness relied upon. All this puts the 
child in contact with a variety of experiences 
in which good judgment, good sense, and the 
power to size up situations are needed. This 
is not a transfer of power but an immediate 
use of controlled power. 
Klapper’ gives two values accruing from 
the use of arithmetic, the practical value, 
“meaning by that the utilitarian, and the tradi- 
tional values—the disciplinary, the pleasur- 
able, the cultural, the preparatory. As taught 
from the utilitarian viewpoint the child gets 
the common mathematical symbols, common 
business practices, a view of life’s problems 
from the quantitative standpoint, a new view- 
point and interpretation to experience, and an 
enrichment of understanding. These, then, 
are the primary values. 
We have already spoken of the so-called 
disciplinary value, and have seen that a study 
is disciplinary only in proportion “to its per- 
manent effect on mind and character.” 
9 Klapper, “Teaching Arithmetic.” (D. Appleton & Co.)
-P-A-G-E-32
14 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
The pleasure value comes through the 
rhythmic sense in counting, and through the 
puzzle instinct in solving problems. The 
cultural value comes through the understand- 
ing of a language socially necessary to get 
along in the world, and the preparatory value 
comes with the realization that certain facts 
are necessary for the next step in progress, 
whether that be in manual training, physics, or 
chemistry. But, as has been previously stated, 
no study has a place in the curriculum except 
as it explains social practice and answers so- 
cial needs. In so far as arithmetic answers 
that requirement, in just so far has it value. 
Suzzallo,?° in speaking of the pernicious be- 
lief in a scientific and disciplinary value in 
number, states, “Teachers still tend to teach 
future workmen in the lower schools as they 
themselves were taught by scientific scholars 
in the universities. Under such an influence 
the worth of a mathematical fact is measured 
by its place in a logical scheme rather than by   
10 Suzzallo, “Teaching of Primary Arithmetic.” (Houghton 
Mifflin Co.)

NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 15 
its significance and recurrence in every-day 
life. Effective, every-day use requires an ac- 
curate habit of carrying, for instance, rather 
than an accurate explanation. 
“The effect of the doctrine of formal dis- 
cipline is to defend and perpetuate every 
obsolete, unimportant, and wasteful practice 
in the teaching of mathematics. 
“Business need and social situations deter- 
mine whether a fact or a process is worth com- 
prehending. The work is still scientific in that 
it is accurate; it is still disciplinary in that it 
trains; but the truth and the training which 
are given are selected and associated with 
actual business situations common to every- 
day life. * * * The problems, in increasing 
extent, are real problems, typical of life, if not 
actual. No more does arithmetic in the best 
schools confine itself to figures alone. Figures 
are applied in concrete problems.” 
C. Psychology of Number.—It is only as 
the teacher understands the psychology of 
number, as she understands it as a ‘‘rational 
process and not a sense fact,” does she

  16 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
properly introduce it to the child. Dewey ™ 
warns us, “There is perhaps no point at which 
the teacher is more likely to go astray than in 
assuming that objects have for a child the 
definiteness or concreteness of qualities which 
they have for us: It is a grave error to suppose 
that * * * * a collection of five objects are 
definitely grasped mental wholes to the child 
simply because there are certain physical 
wholes present to his senses. The idea of 
number is not impressed upon the mind by 
objects even when these are presented under 
the most favorable circumstances. * * * * * 
Number is a product of the way in which the 
mind deals with objects in the operation of 
making a vague whole definite.” 
This operation involves discrimination, 
where the several objects viewed are seen as 
parts of wholes, and generalization, where the 
parts are seen as one group. 
“Rational counting involves putting of 
units in a certain ordered relation to one   
McLellan and Dewey’s “Psychology of Number.” (D. 
Appleton & Co.)

another, as well as marking them off or dis- 
criminating them. * * * * When we reach 
two in counting, we must still keep in mind 
one; if we do not we have not two but merely 
another one. Two things may be before us, 
and the word two may be uttered, but the 
concept two is absent. 
Teaching number merely as a set of sym- 
bols, or treating it as a direct property of ob- 
jects, are methods used. ‘Both methods are 
vitiated by the same fundamental, psycholog- 
ical error—they do not take account of the 
fact that number arises in and through the 
activity of mind in dealing with objects. * * * * 
Number does not belong to things in them- 
selves, but arises in the economical adaptation 
of things to some use or purpose. * * * * It 
is not the mere perception of things which 
gives us the idea, but the employing of things 
in a constructive way.” 
D. Psychology of Method.—‘‘The most sig- 
nificant factor in teaching method is the 
attempt to adjust method of presentation to 
the psychological condition of childhood. Since

the child’s acquisition tends the more to be part 
and parcel of his own life under such system- 
atic teaching, the products of such instruction 
are enduring.”’ ? 
In the old, rigid type of teaching method, 
subject-matter was poured into the child, 
willy-nilly, whether there was need or not. The 
child’s interests may have been far from the 
schoolroom. He may have had a show of 
attention, but the real urge was elsewhere. 
What happened? No satisfaction resulted 
from the effort put into his study, hence no 
connection or identification was made between 
the self and the study. Instead of becoming 
part of the very fibre of his being, as it would, 
had it satisfied a felt need on his part, it 
became something to be disliked; opposing 
bonds or connections were set up, according to 
the Law of Effect that when a modifiable 
bond acts it is strengthened or weakened 
according as satisfaction or annoyance results. 
No satisfaction and no felt need being present, 
  
1% Suzzallo, “Teaching of Primary Arithmetic.” (Houghton 
Mifflin Co.)
-P-A-G-E-37
NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 19 
there is no surety of the endurance of the 
learning process. 
Now what would have happened had the 
knowledge been desired? Many bonds would 
have been ready to act. In acting, satisfaction 
and a glow of feeling would have resulted; the 
bonds would have been strengthened; and each 
step in the process would have been connected 
with other experiences. Kilpatrick'says, ‘Even 
more pronounced is the difference in the by- 
products or concomitants from these contrasted 
activities. The one boy looks upon his school 
activity with joy and confidence and plans 
yet other projects; the other counts his school 
a bore and begins to look elsewhere for the ex- 
pression there denied. To the one the teacher 
is a friend and comrade; to the other a task- 
master dnd enemy. The one easily feels him- 
self on the side of the school and other social 
agencies; the other with equal ease considers 
them all instruments of suppression.” 
Suzzallo further warns, ‘‘The era of complete 
dependence upon. teaching genius and mere 
common sense in methods of instruction has 
1 Teachers College Record, Sept. 1918.  
-P-A-G-E-38
  20 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
passed out of the American elementary school. 
We are now in a period where a specific pro- 
fessional technique in teaching is demanded.” 
And by technique, Suzzallo does not mean 
device, but applicable knowledge of educa- 
tional principles and psychology. A teacher 
must know how to form desirable bonds and 
divert undesirable; she must know what to do 
to form right habits; she must know the signs 
of power in certain directions and how to use 
those signs for the effective upbuilding of 
character; and contrariwise she must know the 
signs of weakness and how to use those as 
warnings for the building of a different foun- 
dation. 
So-called methods emphasize but one phase 
of an idea, as the Grube method, whereas, 
classroom situations vary. Method, therefore, 
must be a ‘‘series of particular adjustments. 
The technique of methods should be as in- 
finitely variable as the conditions calling for 
their use are endlessly changeable. No one 
method should be used with a preéstablished 
rigidity.”
-P-A-G-E-39
NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 21 
Neither must there be over-uniformity, for 
it “lacks spontaneity in teaching. Thus it 
happens that we memorize, cram, drill, and 
review; and soon the subtler processes of 
thinking and evaluating, which are the best 
fruits of education, cease to exist.” 
Dewey is as emphatic as Suzzallo on the im- 
portance of subordinating method to the child. 
He says, “Every aim proposed by the educator 
which is not in harmony with the intrinsic aim 
of human nature itself, every method or device 
employed by the teacher that is not in perfect 
accord with the mind’s own workings, not 
only wastes time and energy, but results in 
positive and permanent harm. Running 
‘counter to the true activities of the mind, it 
certainly distorts and may possibly destroy 
them.” 
Dewey gives three resources available in 
the work of education: 
1. Native tact and skill. 
2. Experience. 
3. Authoritative instruction in methods and 
devices. Of the first he says: “Native endow-     
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS - 
ment can work itself out in the best possible 
results only when it works under right condi- 
tions.’’ And we should add also, when it is 
coupled with child psychology and educational 
principles. 
Of experience Dewey says: “There are 
certain qualities of practice, not mere practice 
which produces the expert and the artist. 
Unless the practice is based upon rational 
principles, upon insight into facts and their 
meaning, experience simply fixes incorrect 
acts into wrong habits. Time and energy are 
wasted. The mark of the scientific worker is 
that he has power in grappling with the new 
and untried; he is master of principles which he 
can effectively apply under novel conditions.” 
“Dewey thinks little of the ordinary devices 
doled out to teachers like soothing syrups. 
This is what he says: “Only knowledge of the 
principles upon which all methods are based 
can free the teacher from dependence upon 
the educational nostrums which are recom- 
mended like patent medicines as panacea for 
all educational ills.”
-P-A-G-E-41
  NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 23 
Method, then, is application of educational 
principles and psychology; it is directing 
native skill into scientific channels; it is ration- 
alizing experience; it is applying scientific 
criteria to suggested devices; it is all this added 
to the character of the teacher. 
On the child’s side, Cook ** has this to say, 
“The method of study is quite as important as 
the matter to be studied. Direct instruction 
is only a small part of what can take place in 
the classroom. Self-government is not a 
matter of discipline only, but a condition 
which makes it possible for the children to 
learn, by themselves, in actual lessons.” 
The advantages accruing are the pure joy 
which they feel in working independently 
and uninfluenced; the amicability engendered 
through coédperation; the discovery of the 
pleasant side of learning, and the satisfaction 
which comes from play with substance in it 
rather than play with aimless amusement; the 
keen interest sustained. 
“Under a natural system of education there 
18 Cook, “The Play Way.” (Frederick A. Stokes Co.)  
-P-A-G-E-42
  24 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
can be no absolute standard of discipline. 
Right behavior is a relative condition to be 
determined by its appropriateness to the 
occasion. Learning how to move is of im- 
measurably greater importance than learning 
to sit still.” But “‘if children are to be taught 
by means of play the master must have a gen- 
uine interest in play.” 
E. The Play Way.— The Play Way is not 
the easy way. You cannot just throw a few 
materials to the children and leave them to 
amuse themselves. They will find enough 
sheer amusement in their own free time; but 
where a teacher takes part, the play should 
be something of pith and substance. There is 
more hard work, even actual labor, attached to 
the Play Way schemes than there is in class- 
room ‘work.’ ” 
Dr. McMurry “ refers to one danger: ‘In 
all * * * * modes of concreting ele- 
mentary number operations there is great 
danger of overdoing the matter by continuing 
“McMurry, “Special Method in Arithmetic.” (The Mac- 
millan Co.)
-P-A-G-E-43
  NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 25 
too long in objective work, thus converting it 
into a routine. In all cases it is necessary to 
push on to the more rapid and abstract treat- 
ment of number, always keeping the way open 
to a quick return to the concrete, where there 
is lack of clearness in thinking.” 
We should mention another danger, espe- 
cially where games are used for drill purposes. 
Care must be exercised that the game element 
does not overbalance the number element, else 
the number value is lost. 
F. Distribution of Arithmetic Work.—More 
and more is beginning number work being 
pushed out of the first grade into the second, 
and, in some cases, even into the third. 
“Learning the mechanics of reading is quite 
the most important part of the first school 
year, and the addition of the difficulty of 
another language—for such number is—would 
overburden and distract the child. Hence a 
common-sense distribution of burdens and 
tasks would delay the formal and systematic 
study of arithmetic a half or whole school 
year.” But the authors do not quite agree
-P-A-G-E-44
  26 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
with Suzzalo. If the first grade children have , 
had kindergarten training they come with 
some knowledge of number upon which the 
first grade teacher can build. And not only 
that, they are eager for it, they use it in keep- 
ing simple scores, in playing store, and some 
even tell time. Is this foundation to lie dor- 
mant until such a time as the teacher may 
think the child can reason? The teacher may 
let it alone, but the child will not. There are 
constant social demands for the use of number. 
The child’s brother or sister finds his pages in 
the books, reads the thermometer, counts out 
change, and the child wishes to do the same. 
The rhythmical sense of number appeals; he 
wants to count by 2’s, 5’s, 10’s. Psychology 
will help the teacher to meet the different 
levels of child maturity and give him number 
as he needs it and keep it away from him 
when there is no need. Where there is the 
logical arrangement the child pursues the sub- 
ject as a task, “not as an answer to his own 
curiosities or necessities.” 
Those who would delay the teaching of
-P-A-G-E-45
NUMBER WORK IN KINDERGARTEN 27 
number until the second or third grade would 
have it occur incidentally up to that time, but 
incidental is apt to be accidental, and the child 
reaches the second grade with only haphazard 
elements in number, not a number sense. 
G. Some Practical Hints.—Freeman ** tells 
us that young children have an interest in 
counting rather in the things themselves. 
Things are used only as counters. The only 
way in which children really feel number is 
through the necessity for its use. Then the 
interest is transferred from mere rhythmical 
counting to use of means to reach an end. 
The danger to avoid is that the child continues 
counting with no meaning—that he thinks of 
each number name as being the name of one of 
his fingers, for instance. rather than as one in a 
group of others. 
Through measurement he gets the idea of 
whole better than the use of individual units. 
Dewey says: “The unit is never to be thought 
as a fixed thing, but always as a unit of meas-   
Freeman, ‘Psychology of the Common Branches.” 
(Houghton Mifflin Co.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
    28 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
urement. It is a unit not in virtue of any 
quality inherent in it, but in virtue of its use 
in measuring cost, length, weight, duration. 
The method which neglects to recognize 
number as measurement and considers it 
simply as a plurality of fixed units, necessarily 
leads to exhausted and meaningless mechan- 
ical drill. The natural beginning of number is 
a whole needing measurement.”

CHAPTER II 
MAKING DOMINOES 
Tue first grade children wished to make 
dominoes to use at home. They had played 
with the large dominoes made from the kinder- 
garten blocks but decided these were too 
heavy to carry home. One child suggested 
that cigar-box lids be used instead of the large 
wooden blocks; another thought cardboard 
would serve the purpose better. After some 
discussion all agreed upon cardboard as the 
most suitable material. Cardboards of vari- 
ous dimensions were then placed along the 
chalk ledge and the children selected the one 
they thought similar in shape to the large 
wooden blocks. A card of the size and shape 
selected was given to each child and he meas- 
ured the length and width with one-inch cubes. 
The cards were found to be six blocks long and 
three blocks wide. When told that the cube 
29 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  30 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
measured one inch, they then stated the 
dimensions in inches. 
But in order to make the domino cards, 
they needed a measuring unit that could be 
used more accurately and conveniently than 
the inch cubes. When asked if they knew of 
any easier way to measure, many suggested 
using rulers. The teacher gave them rulers 
marked with inches only. The children placed 
the blocks upon the inch spaces and found 
that the spaces were the same length as their 
blocks. They found that the ruler contained 
twelve spaces or twelve inches. 
Strawboard 12” <6” was then given to them 
and they were asked to find how many domino 
cards could be cut from that size paper. After 
a sufficient number of cards had been measured 
and cut for the domino set, they compared 
them with the large set to find out the next 
step in their work. They saw that each of their 
cards had to be marked off into halves to sepa- 
rate the groups of dots. Various ways of 
dividing the card into halves were tried. Some
-P-A-G-E-49
MAKING DOMINOES 31 
children bent one card and so saw that three 
inches marked off one half of the card; some 
said that three is a half of six and therefore 
measured off three inches. Others took a strip 
of paper six inches long, folded it, and laid it 
on the ruler to see how much a half of six is. 
But all found out and learned for themselves 
that three is a half of six. 
When the cards were ready for the dots, the 
children sat in groups of five or six around the 
large wooden domino game used as a model. 
The teacher gave them a small pan of water 
and 14” parquetry circles. They pasted these 
on the cards, following the arrangement on the 
large domino blocks. Each child’s package of 
cards when complete was about one inch high. 
A child suggested that boxes be made for the 
sets of cards. What size paper was needed for 
. each was the question. In their attempt to 
answer it, they built a box with one inch cubes. 
By measuring the box thus made, they found 
that the dimensions of the bottom were 
6X3," just the size of the cards. But when
-P-A-G-E-50
  82 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
the children found how difficult it was to take 
the cards from the box, they decided that the 
box must be larger than 6’ X3’’.. One inch was 
allowed on both the length and width. 
To make the box one inch deep they added 
two more inches to each of the dimensions. 
They measured in one inch from each of the 
four edges and formed the box by folding in 
the corners and securing them with paper- 
fasteners. 
The box was thought to be incomplete with- 
out a lid. At first the children insisted that 
the same sized paper was required for the lid, 
but upon measuring and cutting a sample from 
newspaper they found that the lid had to be a 
little larger than the bottom of the box. With 
the correct sized paper the lid was made in the 
same manner as the box. Each child pasted a 
slip of paper bearing his name upon the box 
when it was completed. The cards were used 
not only as in the regular game, but also in 
games involving number combinations.

combinations of dots making 5, and said, 
  “Three and two are 5”; or “Four and one are

nation won. The row or group having the 
greatest number of ‘‘calls’” won. A child 
appointed from each row kept the score on the

A PUZZLE GAME—MEASURING 
Tue children used their rulers for meas- 
uring all sorts of things—window-sills, tops 
of desks, bookcase doors, length and width of 
the room, etc. They made boxes similar to 
the domino boxes and used these for cut-out 
puzzle pictures. To make the puzzle pictures 
they pasted heavy tag board on the back of 
pictures they had grown familiar with during 
language and conversation periods. On the 
tag-board side they measured off and cut out 
two-inch squares. Three or four such puzzle 
pictures were put into each box. A number of 
these puzzle boxes provided interesting games 
for rainy recesses.

CHAPTER V 
PLAYING STORE 
Tue children decided to play store. They 
decided to sell the paper fans, balls, boxes, 
houses, and doll furniture which they had 
made. Those who had been absent when 
these articles were made were the buyers.. A 
store was built by placing a number of boxes 
together to form shelves. These boxes were 
obtained at the grocery-store and painted by 
the children. (The large kindergarten blocks 
may be used instead of the boxes.) Paper 
discs were made to represent money. Price- 
tags indicating the cost of each article were 
made and attached. Nothing in the store 
was to cost more than ten cents. 
When the store playing began, the children 
discovered that some of them did not know the 
number of pennies in a dime nor the number of 
nickels in a dime. The children who knew 
helped to teach the others. A child who had 
37
-P-A-G-E-58
     38 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS     
  missed no days at school, and hence was more 
experienced, went with an inexperienced child 
to do the purchasing. He helped him to see 
that if he bought a chair for 3 cents and a 
table for a nickel, his purchase amounted to 8 
cents, and that from his dime he had 2 cents 
left. He saw that since one of his nickels was 
used in paying for the table, and 3 cents of the 
second nickel were used in paying for the chair, 
he could have only 2 cents left. 
When the storekeeper gave him a slip of 
paper upon which was written the amount of 
his purchases, he checked the slip with his 
change to make certain that it was correct.

counted out the pennies, knowing that there 
were ten pennies in 1 ten, but discovering that 
there were 20 pennies in 2 tens, and 30 pennies
-P-A-G-E-59
PLAYING STORE 39 
in 3 tens. At this point the children saw 
that the store had to be closed until they 
learned to count quickly by tens. 
As the children counted, the teacher placed 
the tens upon the board:

They knew that there were ten ones in 1 ten, 
and they soon saw that there were twenty 
ones in 2 tens, thirty ones in 3 tens, forty ones 
in 4 tens, etc. They now counted by tens to 
100; one child did the counting while another 
pointed to the numbers at the bottom of the 
columns. 
Next the teacher called attention to the
-P-A-G-E-60
40 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
fact that the number on the left told how 
many tens were represented. One ten had a 
figure 1 to the left, 2 tens or 20 had a figure 2 
to the left, ete. Next she asked what the fig- 
ure to the right told. Since no one knew, she 
asked what money made up 11 cents. Some 
children said 11 pennies, some said a dime and 
1 penny. She asked then how many tens and 
ones make 11. She questioned in the “same 
way concerning 14, 17, 23, 28, ete. The chil- _ 
dren now saw that the figures on the right told 
the number of ones and those on the left told 
the number of tens in a given number. They 
then read 24, 38, 45, as so many tens and so 
many ones. After this explanation and drill, 
they were able to continue their store-play on 
the next and subsequent days with any num- 
ber to 100. : 
From their play they learned that 100 
pennies is the same as ten dimes or $1; $.50 
is one half-dollar or five dimes or fifty pen- 
nies; $.75 is the same as seven dimes and one 
nickel; $.25 is two dimes and one nickel. They 
learned that if they bought something for $.30, 
 
-P-A-G-E-61

or three dimes, they should have two dimes 
change from $.50. 
From time to time the children continued 
their store-play and thus had many oppor-

CHAPTER VI 
GAMES WITH COMBINATIONS 
1. An oblong containing the numbers from 
one to ten was placed upon the board. The 
children took turns throwing at any one of the 
numbers in the oblong. As the number was 
  struck the child throwing the ball gave a com- 
bination whose sum was represented by the 
number. If this was correct he passed the ball 
on to the next child and then wrote the com- 
bination on the board: 
6+2=8 or 5+4=9 
2. The children formed two groups with a 
captain for each group. Six or eight figures 
were placed on the board in the following . 
manner:

One of the captains chose a number to add 
to these numbers. A child chosen from each 
group stood at the opposite ends of the line of 
figures. When the signal “Go” was given, 
the children put down the sums in rapid succes- 
sion, trying to finish as many combinations as 
possible before they met along the line of fig- 
ures. If the number chosen was 2, then the 
results were 4, 10, 6, 5, 7, and so on, beginning 
at the left. When the two children came to- 
gether they drew a line to separate their work.

The captains kept the score. In this case 
the right side made 5 and the left 2. At the 
end of the game the side making the highest 
score won.

MAKING REINS 
In connection with a miniature farm the 
children played shipping the milk to the city. 
They made a wagon and milk-cans, using the 
Schoenhut blocks.* At first cord served for 
harness but later it proved to be unsatisfac- 
tory and tape was substituted. To find the 
amount of tape needed they measured the cord 
harness and found it was five rulers. or five 
feet long. A child suggested putting a piece 
of tape across the front and placing bells upon 
it. This required nine inches. The bells were 
placed three inches apart. 
Those children wishing to have individual 
reins brought tape from home and made the 
reins during a seat work period. These af- 
forded much fun at the play periods.

PURSES FOR TOY MONEY 
From time to time the children came back to 
their store with renewed interest, changing it 
to a vegetable market, a toy-shop, or a candy- 
store. As their play continued they discovered 
they needed purses for small change. Several 
children had made them at home. The others 
looked at these and selected one most nearly 
like a real purse. They chose a piece of art 
construction paper the color of the leather they 
liked. The owner of the purse allowed the 
others to measure it to estimate the amount of 
paper needed. His purse had four folds, each 
two inches in depth. After some discussion, 
the children saw that four two-inch folds were 
needed, or a paper eight inches long. A child 
noticed that another inch must be added for 
the flap, making the paper nine inches long. 
The model purse was three inches wide, so the 
strip of paper for the purse was cut 9” <3”. 
48
-P-A-G-E-71
PURSES FOR TOY MONEY 49 
They measured off the two-inch folds. But the 
sides were open and the money fell out. They 
saw that the model purse had hinges to pre- 
vent this. By experimenting with a piece of 
paper, the children made the hinges. They 
then measured the folds of the model hinge to 
see how wide it was. Each fold was half an 
inch deep. Four half-inch folds were re- 
quired for yee hinge. The purse was 
two inches deep. So a paper 2” 2” was cut 
for each hinge. After these were pasted into 
the purses, they were ready for playing store. 
An elastic was placed around the purse to 
keep it shut.

CHAPTER X 
HALLOWE’EN LANTERN 
Tue children had free choice in making a 
number of Hallowe’en articles, some for deco- 
pation, some for gifts, others for a play. One 
7 child brought a paper lantern from 
home, which all the children wanted 
to copy. They chose orange-colored 
construction paper. After opening 
NY up and measuring the lantern brought 
to school, each child cut a paper 844” x 6”. 
One half inch was allowed for the flap, eight 
inches for the entire jee eas 
width of the four sides, 
and six inches for the 
height. The two 
inches forming each of 
the four sides of the 
lantern were measured off and folded. This 
left one half inch for the flap. The next step 
was to make the windows. A frame was made

by measuring in from the sides one half inch. 
The windows were then cut out and covered 
with thin white onion- 
skin paper to give the 
appearance of glass. 
Some children thought 
this paper should be the exact size of the 
windows, but found this made no allowance for 
pasting. Some thought the thin paper should 
be cut the same as the sides of the lantern 
(6” <2”). A few thought the paper should be 
cut large enough to cover the entire lantern 
with the exception of the flap—8” x6”. The 
last plan was finally accepted and carried out. 
Decorations of black cats and witches were 
added. The lantern was then pasted together. 
Paper was measured, cut, and pasted upon it 
for a handle.

  CHAPTER XI 
DRESSING THE PILGRIMS 
Cuffs.—For a school assembly period, the 
children wished to give a Pilgrim play just 
before Thanksgiving. They went to the 
library and examined a number of books for 
pictures of costumes. The librarian helped 
them. They decided to make collars, cuffs, 
caps, and hats. From newspapers, they cut 
out patterns for cuffs, but these did not fit very 
well. The teacher showed them on the board 
that by measuring in one inch 
from each end of one of the long 
sides and then drawing down a 
slanting line to the corners of the other long 
side, their cuffs would fit better. From a paper 
9” <6” this pattern was cut. 
Collar.*—The children had trouble in cut- 
ting collars to fit. They asked the teacher 
for help. Newspapers (18 X24’’) were passed   
*Made by children who knew use of circle-maker. See p. 77, 
Making Wigwams. 
52
-P-A-G-E-77
DRESSING THE PILGRIMS 53 
out. The children drew circles, the centers of 
which were one third of the distance in from 
one of the long edges, and one half of the dis- 
tance in from the short edges. 
The teacher gave the follow- 
ing dictation: 
Place the edge of the paper 
nearest circle at the front 
edge of the desk. That is 
the front edge of the paper. 
From that edge, measure 
down on each short edge of your paper five 
inches. Measure the same in the middle of 
your paper. Connect all these dots by a line 
and cut along this line. 
| What part of the collar 
does that make? (It is 
the front edge of the 
collar.) What is the 
next step? (Cut out 
- the circle.) What have 
you now? (The neck of the collar.) How can 
you cut a good collar shape from this? (One 
child suggested he put the paper on another 
child and cut a collar to fit him.) All children , 
    
-P-A-G-E-78
  54 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
followed his suggestion. Some very creditable 
collars resulted. The best was taken for a 
model, and placed on blackboard, with the 
original paper attached. Newspapers were 
given to the children 
and the necks cut out 
as before. The teacher 
continued the direc- 
tions. Look at the side 
of John’s paper where the neck is cut out. 
Measure and find out how far in he began 
to cut. (John measured two inches.) How 
far in on the other side? (Two inches.) You 
may all measure two inches in from either 
side and place dots. What is the next step? 
(Children said to cut straight down.) Does 
the Pilgrim’s collar in the picture look as 
though it were cut 
straight? Put this one 
which is cut straight 
on John, and this one 
which is cut slanting 
on Fred. Which do you like better? (The 
slanting one.) Why? (It fits better.) How
-P-A-G-E-79
  DRESSING THE PILGRIMS 55 
can we know how much to slant it? (Measure 
in at the bottom, just as we did at the top.) 
How many inches should we measure in on 
either side of the paper? (Four inches.) Now, 
what shall we do? 
(Draw lines and cut 
out collars.) Now you 
each have a pattern for 
your Pilgrim collars. 
Caps.—The children tried making the caps. 
The boys helped the girls. They found that by 
taking an oblong 18’’X9” and folding it the 
short way, it looked a little 
like a Pilgrim mother’s cap, 
with the exception of the 
wings. The children tried 
using an oblong 9’’ <4” along the entire edge 
of the cap. It did not give the appearance 
of wings. The children s 
saw thatthe difficulty SA Jb 
ee was due to the NA 
fact that their nine-inch strip did not 
allow for the peak at the top. The teacher 
also suggested that the strip be curved on the  
-P-A-G-E-80
  56 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
front edge to make the wings stand away from 
the cap. 
The children then cut a strip 10’ x4”, and 
the teacher gave the following dictation for 
the wings of the cap: 
Place your oblong on the desk, with the long 
edges running with the long edges of the desk. 
. Wecall that parallel, From the top 
right-hand corner, measure in on 
the long edge two inches. Draw 
a line from that dot to the lower right-hand 
corner. What shape is that piece of paper just 
marked off? (A trian- 
gle.) You may cut off Ls bal aa 
that triangle. Mark that cut edge, on the 
large paper, 1. 
On the lower long edge, from the left-hand 
corner, measure in one inch. Draw line from 
bX ba this dot to the upper left- 
4 hand corner. Cut off 
that triangle. Mark that edge, 2. 
How many of these wings will you Aik 
need? How could you cut another very 
quickly? (Use this asa pattern.) How would
-P-A-G-E-81
  DRESSING THE PILGRIMS 57 
you place these on your cap? Which of your 
short edges looks better at the top of your cap? 
(2.) Are the wings all right? Look at this 
cap. How do these wings differ from yours? 
(They are shaped.) Place one of the wings on 
the desk just as you had it in the first place. 
In the middle of the 
bottom line, meas- Ae | ‘a 
ure in one inch. Draw a curved line from 
either corner to this dot, and cut on the line. 
Remembering which short edge belongs at the 
top of the cap, you may pin on the wings. 
Hats*.—Since the boys helped the girls 
make their caps, the girls helped the boys make 
their hats. A Pilgrim hat was used as a 
model. It did not fit all the boys, so the chil- 
dren thought they must measure the heads of 
the boys for whom they were going to make 
hats. They did this with a string. The dif- 
ficulty then was to know the size circle to make 
for the brim. They referred to the teacher. 
She told them to fold the string into thirds. 
* Made by children who knew use of circle-maker. See p. 77, 
Making Wigwams.  
-P-A-G-E-82
    
58 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
One third was the diameter of the circle 
needed. It was about one third the distance 
around the circle. They measured the third. 
Different children had slightly different meas- 
urements, but most of them used eight inches 
as the diameter. All measured to find out the 
size paper needed for the brim—four inches 
for the radius, five inches for the brim, gave 
half of what was needed, so they cut eighteen- 
inch squares from stiff black paper. 
A discussion followed as to how to find the 
center of the square for the making of the 
inner circle. The children measured the square 
in half each way, and where the two lines 
crossed was the center. Using this 
center as the center of the circle, 
they drew and cut it. Then by 
adding the radius of this circle to 
the width of the brim desired, they knew the 
size of the outer circle. 
The making of the crown was the next step. 
The teacher helped the children to make it. 
Tf you look at this hat, it will help you to see 
how the crown is made. -How many parts

(The top part.) What would you

ment do you need? You have already had 
one measurement which will help you. (The

CHAPTER XII 
REPARING FOR CHRISTMAS 
i7./Making Needle-Books.—One day each 
weék for an hour, the children did Christmas 
sewing. Needles were dropped and lost after 
every period. The teacher asked the children 
how their mothers kept needles from getting 
lost. They said they had needle-books. The 
children had boxes in which to keep their 
sewing. They thought it a good plan to have 
needle-books in which to keep their needles. 
They made patterns showing the kind of 
needle-books they preferred. The favorite was 
the shape of a book containing “leaves of 
cloth.” When the cloth leaves were folded and 
placed into a paper-back cover, the fact that 
the cover must be larger than the leaves became 
apparent. They then took art construction 
paper and made a back for their book which 
was one half inch longer and wider than the 
leaves.

%. Repairing Toys.—At Christmas time, each 
child in first grade became interested in mak- 
ing gifts for a child of another school. The gifts 
were planned as a surprise for these children. 
A toy-shop was opened. Every child who 
had a toy to give away brought it to school. 
All toys were examined and those in need of 
repair were placed in a box. 
One hour each day was given 
to the mending of toys or the 
dressing of dolls. For some 
of the dolls the children made 
aprons, using a pattern resembling paper-doll 
designs. Several of the dolls were dressed in 
Pilgrim costume. 
The dolls were measured for their costumes. 
Pieces of mending tissue were measured and 
cut for torn books. Certain number and 
kinds of brads, fasteners, or needles had to be 
counted out and distributed. Pieces of wood 
had to be measured and sawed in repairing 
kites, boxes, or other toys. 
3. Making and Packing Candy.—The chil- 
dren also planned to make candy-boxes with
-P-A-G-E-89

lids, similar to those made for the domino 
cards. They decorated them in the art period 
with decorations appropriate to the season. 
Each child measured out, in the cooking-room, 
the following ingredients for the candy, cooked 
it, and placed it in his box.

* Portfolio for Cut-out Pictures.—The chil- 
dren, through one child’s suggestion, became 
much interested in tracing and cutting out 
various farm animals. These, they thought, 
would add to the pleasure of the children for 
whom they were planning the Christmas sur- 
prise. They planned to make an envelope to 
contain the animals.
-P-A-G-E-90
  64 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
They made it out of art construction paper. 
A discussion arose as to what size to make the 
envelope. The children said that it must be 
of such a size that the largest animal could 
easily be put in. The horse was the largest 
animal. A paper 6” x4’ covered him. To 
allow plenty of room, a paper 8” <6” was sug- 
gested, one for each side of the envelope. 
Some children thought the envelope should be 
made by simply pasting the sides together. 
Others thought a flap of two inches should be 
allowed on the six-inch side; still others 
thought the envelope could be made as the 
purses had been made. This required a paper 
large enough to fold and to 
allow for a flap. So papers 
8” X14” werecut. This allowed 
2" for the flap. Hinges were measured, cut, 
and pasted in, and a very satisfactory envelope 
portfolio was the result. 
‘§. Jack-in-the-Box.—Some of the children 
who finished before the others made a Jack- 
in-the-Box or a Nest of Boxes. The former 
was made by first fashioning a box and cover

similar to those made for the Christmas boxes. 
“Jack” was cut free-hand or an appropriate 
cutting from a magazine was used instead. 
“Jack” was pasted to the end of the hinge of 
five folds made to serve as the spring within 
the box. The opposite end of the hinge was 
pasted to the bottom of the box. 
6. Nest of Boxes.—In making a nest of 
boxes the children were again applying what 
they had previously learned. The smallest 
box was 1’ <1”, the largest was 4" x4’. Each 
box was a half-inch smaller than the one into 
which it fitted. A lid was made for each box 
and a Christmas greeting was put into the 
smallest one of the nest. The largest box was 
decorated with an appropriate design.

MAKING SCHOOLROOM CURTAINS 
In the fall the teacher showed the children 
some material for making curtains for the 
schoolroom, with the question, ‘‘How should 
you like to help me make them?” The chil- 
dren said the first thing to do was to measure 
the windows. They found by standing on the 
window-sill they could not reach the top of 
the windows with their rulers. The teacher 
gave them what they thought were longer 
tulers, stating that they were called “yard- 
sticks.” Some children measured and saw 
that there were three of their rulers, or three 
feet, in one yard. They then measured the 
windows, finding them to be six feet or two 
yards in length. One child measured off two 
yards of the material, marking the place with 
apin. He pinned the curtain over the rod and 
the teacher hung it. The curtain was too 
short. The children then added on three 
inches for the casing. The teacher called

their attention to the fact that they also 
needed some for the hem. Three inches was 
allowed for that. The curtains had to be two 
yards and six inches long, or six and one-half 
feet long. There were eight windows. Two 
curtains were needed at each window. Count- 
ing by twos, the children found they needed 
sixteen curtains. 
Different children took turns measuring and 
marking, while others cut the material and 
pinned up the hems. The latter they sewed 
with yarn—two long stitches, two short 
stitches, for three rows:

A Game of Twos.—Each child had a pack- 
age of cards which he had made himself. On 
these cards were all the products contained in 
the table of twos—2, 4, 6, 8, and so forth. 
The captain of the group called, for instance, 
four twos. The first children holding up the

cards bearing the figure 8, gave these cards to 
the captain. Other numbers were called in 
the same way. The children having the least 
number of cards at the end, won. 
Now, in order for the owners to get back 
the cards to complete their sets, the children 
took turns calling out the combinations in the 
table of twos. The captain then returned the 
card containing the product for which the 
combination called. The game was continued 
until each child had his complete set again.

PLAYING INDIAN 
1. Getting Material for Indian Dresses.— 
While the children of the first grade were 
studying Indian life, several children appeared 
in Indian costume. That was enough. The 
entire room was immediately transformed into 
an Indian village. Those who had suits wore 
them on each succeeding day. Those who did 
not have them, and could not get them, 
wondered how they could possess one. A child 
suggested making one. Then arose discussion 
as to where to get the material, and the cost. 
It was decided to go to a near-by store to price 
it. It was found to be $.12 a yard. The 
children discovered they did not know how 
much to buy, which necessitated finding what 
was needed for each child. How to do that 
was the question. 
Remembering what they used to measure 
their curtains the children wished to measure

each other with a yardstick. The teacher then 
showed them how to use the tape’ measure. 
Some children required one and one-half yards 
and some two yards. The children calcu- 
lated how much their dresses would cost. 
They thought their mothers would give them 
the money. A discussion brought out the fact 
that it was not fair to ask their mothers to 
buy. something for which they could earn the 
money. Many suggestions came until a 
candy sale was settled upon. 
Recipes were brought from home and dis- 
cussions as to relative costs ensued. Peanut 
brittle was selected. The teacher offered to 
lend them the money for materials until after 
the sale. They went to the store and bought 
Karo, fat, and peanuts, the teacher telling 
them the bulk amount to get, and afterwards 
giving to each child a slip of paper upon 
which was the amount of his charge. 
Notes were sent to the cooking teacher 
asking her for the use of the laboratory. Those 
who had suits were eager and willing to help 
those who hadn’t suits to make the candy,
-P-A-G-E-104
    74 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
Use of scales and measuring-cup was intro- 
duced in this part of work. Invitations were 
sent to each room asking the children and 
teachers to come to the sale. Attractive 
booths were built of blocks and decorated. 
There were six booths, two children at a booth 
with a change box and boxes of candy. The 
latter sold for five cents a box, each containing 
six pieces of candy about two inches square. 
The boxes were of different shapes, made by 
the children. The most attractive and neatest 
boxes were sold first. 
After the sale the money borrowed from the 
teacher was returned. The remainder of the 
proceeds was counted out by the children, each 
child receiving $.18 or $.24 according to the 
amount needed for his suit. A small amount 
of money was left. Class discussion brought 
out the decision to save this for future needs. 
The yards of material needed for the Indian 
dresses were counted and in a subsequent 
period the children purchased the total amount. 
Upon return to the school each child measured 
and cut off material for his own dress.

Indian Dresses.—After much discussion 
design of the Hiawatha costume was 
chosen. This is a simple paper-doll apron 
effect. It was suggested that they do as their 
mothers did and make a newspaper pattern 
first. In the fashioning of these such ques- 
tions as the following were asked: 
What will you have to know to make yours 
the right size? From what points will you 
measure yourself? What does your mother 
use for measuring? What is the first thing to 
do with the paper? After you have cut the
-P-A-G-E-108

paper the right length what is the next step? 
What width should the sleeves be? How deep 
are you going to cut in for the length of the 
sleeves? What is an easy way of telling? 
(Holding the paper on the person.) Is the 
pattern now finished? (Neck is needed.) 
How many inches across should you allow for 
the neck? Where do you begin to measure? 
The child measures and cuts out the opening 
for the neck. 
The children worked in groups of two, and 
when each had tried his paper pattern on the 
other and found it satisfactory the material 
was cut for the Indian dress. Cambric, 
khaki color, about one and one-half yards to a 
child, was used. After the dresses were prop- 
erly fitted they were fringed along the sides 
and bottom and a suitable Indian decoration 
was added. The meaning and significance of 
the various designs had been discussed pre- 
viously in the art class. 
The costumes were worn daily while the 
interest in the study of Indian life lasted. 
During the time that the above project was

being worked out, the class, in their study of 
Indian life, evolved the plan of presenting the 
story of Hiawatha at a school assembly. 
These costumes were used for that purpose. 
3. Making Wigwams.—While studying In- 
dian life, the children asked to make an Indian 
Villiage in the sand-pan. They wished to 
make wigwams first. After many attempts on 
their part, they finally asked the teacher to 
show them how to make wigwams. She said 
they could make better ones from circles, and 
showed them how to cut a circle-maker. The 
children cut strips of strawboard 1614”. 
They measured off one half inch from one end, 
drawing a line. They called this the half- 
inch line. 
  From that line, they measured off and 
marked inches to the end. 
Upon a large piece of paper on the black- 
board, the teacher made different sized circles 
with her circle-maker, each time telling the
-P-A-G-E-112
  78 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
children where she placed the pin in the circle- 
maker—at 2, 3, 4, and so forth. The pencil 
she placed in a hole punched in the middle of 
~ the half-inch line. The teacher, 
when she placed the pin in the 
two-inch line, asked the children 
to notice what sized circle she was 
‘ making. When she took the 
circle-maker away, she asked the children to 
tell her how many inches across half the circle, 
then across the entire circle. She 
did this until it was clear to the 
children that in order to make a 
certain sized circle, they must 
place their pin on their marker 
at the number indicating half the size. The 
teacher told them that the line dividing the 
circle exactly in half was called the diameter. 
Half of the diameter was the radius. Hence- 
forth she used these terms.

above were used fora number game. A large 
straw circular porch mat was placed upon an 
easel in the rear of the room. Upon this was 
marked off three rings with red, white, and 
blue paint. > After discussing how much more 
difficult it was to get an arrow within the inner 
circle the children decided that a score of five 
should be given for this circle, a score of three 
for the next, and two for the outer one. The 
scores were kept on the board for comparison 
at the end of any contest:

called out, for instance, 5—2. The two chil- 
dren whose corners were numbered 3 tried to 
change places before “Pussy,” or the child 
calling, reached one of the two corners. The 
child left out was ‘‘Pussy,” and he continued 
the game. At the end of the period, the chil- 
dren who had never been caught were the 
winners.

they placed all the combinations used in the 
various projects. These strips were passed 
back of a small wooden screen containing an 
opening large enough to expose one set of 
numbers at a time. Two children passed the 
“film” through the screen, being careful to 
  bend back the strips so that only the numbers 
appearing in the opening could be seen by the 
class. The time used for the drill was recorded 
each day. The combinations causing difficulty 
were noted for special drill; and the amount of 
improvement, if any, was found by comparing 
the day’s record with previous ones. 
5. A Silent Number Game.—The class was 
divided into two teams. A child from one

nodded to a child of the other team, who ran 
to the board and wrote the correct answer. He 
in turn placed another problem in halves on 
the board, as 14 of 8= and nodded to an 
opponent to answer it. The game proceeded 
until both sides had written themselves out. 
If either side failed to answer correctly th 
opposite side scored by giving the correct 
answer. All problems were read aloud at the 
end of the game,

CHAPTER XVI 
TELLING TIME 
THERE came a day when children wished to 
know how to tell time. The teacher called 
their attention to the fact that they had 
learned many ways of measuring and that the 
clock was just another way. The clock meas- 
ured time, but instead of using inches, it used 
minutes and hours. On the face of an old, 
unused clock, she showed them the minute- 
spaces, and the hand which measured off the 
minutes. Then she showed them how the 
hours were measured off by the hour-hand. 
The children counted the minute-spaces over > 
which the minute-hand must travel in an hour. 
One child suggested that they could count the 
spaces much more quickly if they counted by 
fives. He showed the children that there were 
five minute-spaces between the figures on the 
clock. The teacher placed on the board. the 
numbers up to sixty in the following order, 
85 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  86 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
grouping them by fives. The children, in 
learning to count by tens in the ten-cent store, 
11 21 were already familiar 
12 p 22 with this arrangement. 
13 23 They counted five to 
14 24 the first underlined fig- 
15 25 ure, five more to the 
16 26 second, five more to 
17 97 the third, and so on to 
18 28 sixty. Some children 
19 29 became keenly inter- 
20 30 ested and went on to 
—  -—— 100. They then counted 
5’s to different points, to 80, to 30, to 20. By 
that time they were ready to count by 5’s on the 
clock-face, and they found there were 12 fives 
in 60 minutes, or one hour. One child counted 
by 5’s to see the number of minutes in the 
recess period, another found how many min- 
utes they had at noon. Different children 
showed the time for periods of work—5 min- 
utes after nine for Reading period, half past 
nine for Gymnasium. They found the minute- 
hand travelled only half the distance of the _ BS to a0 in cl ae ho a
-P-A-G-E-123
  TELLING TIME 87 
clock-face at half past the hour, and that there 
were 30 minutes in a half-hour—30 is a half 
of 60. 
The children noted the clock and announced 
the close of each period. They asked to make 
their own clock-faces in order to play in telling 
time. They had made circles when making 
their Indian wigwams. They measured the 
diameter of the clock-face in the room. It was 
twelve inches. They then knew, that on their 
circle-marker, they must use a radius of six 
inches. They used heavy tag board. When 
the circles were finished, the children thought 
the five-minute spaces would be 
the most easily put in. The 
teacher told them‘ ‘to cut another 
circle of drawing-paper, the same 
size as their first one, for a pat- 
tern in measuring off the minutes. They folded 
these circles into four equal parts. The teacher 
told them each of the parts was called “a 
fourth,” or “a quarter.” They saw that ina 
half there were two fourths, or quarters, and 
ina whole, there were four fourths, or four
-P-A-G-E-124
    
88 NUMBER PROJECTS FOR BEGINNERS 
quarters. They then cut out 14 of their circle, 
and used that to measure off the quarters on 
the clock-faces. They saw that 
in each quarter, there were 15 
minutes, and three five-minute 
spaces. To indicate the five- 
minute spaces, they folded the 
pattern into three parts and marked off the 
spaces on the clock-face. 
After marking off the spaces, the children 
put in the Roman numerals. They 
cut the hands and fastened them 
on with paper-fasteners. The 
Third Grade marked the minute- 
spaces for them. For several 
days, the children played with their clock- 
faces, turning the hands to mark dif- 
ie ferent periods of work, some the dinner- 
hour, others time to return to school, ete.

  CHAPTER XVII 
READING THE THERMOMETER 
WHEN the weather began to be severe, the 
children were interested in reading the ther- 
mometer and watching daily the rise and fall 
of the mercury column. They had already 
learned to count by twos in selecting partners 
for games, and they had learned to count by 
twos in their ten-cent store. Therefore, it 
was an easy matter to learn that each of the 
spaces on the thermometer measured two 
degrees, and to count the degrees by twos. 
They wanted individual thermometers to use 
in their play as they had used their toy clocks. 
The teacher gave them strips of tag board 
24’ 5’’. The children looked at a large ther- 
mometer to get suggestions for making. They 
first drew two lines two inches in from either 
side of the long edges of their paper. These 
were to represent the glass used for the mer- 
cury. The children then decided that it would 
90 :
-P-A-G-E-127
READING THE THERMOMETER 91 
be easier to measure the lines ten degrees 
apart first. On the large thermometer, they 
were one and one-quarter ——————————_ 
inches apart. The chil- 
dren did not know the 
quarter-inches. The 
teacher recalled the clock quarters, and 
asked the children to find the number of 
spaces into which the inches on the ruler were 
divided. They found there were four equal 
divisions. Some of the children said these were 
fourths. They were then able to see that the 
lines measuring off the ten degrees were one 
and one-quarter 
After measuring 
off the quarter-inches for the degrees, the 
children placed the numbers on the ten-degree 
  spaces and placed tape, half dipped in red 
ink, through slits at the top and bottom. This

tape they drew up and down, giving. each 
time the thermometer reading for the height 
of the red column. When coming in from 
play, they often showed by the tape the out- 
door temperature, or, when coming from home, 
they showed the temperature of the different 
rooms at home.

PLANTING A GARDEN 
In the spring the children were told that 
they each might have a plot of ground 6’X4’ 
for a garden. In order that they might know 
just how to place their flowers or vegetables 
in their plot when the ground was ready to 
use, several children drew plots 6’X4’ with 
the yard measure on the schoolroom floor. 
They were given their choice of flowers and 
vegetables. They worked out different ar- 
rangements. Some planned to have tall 
plants like corn in the middle, and the lower 
plants along the sides. Others planned to plant 
gardens according to the color of the blos- 
soming plants. They had to know how far 
apart to plant the'seeds. They then drew lines 
crosswise on the plot, a half a foot apart 
for the small plants and a foot apart for the 
large ones. 
They thought they might forget what they

MAKING NUMBER BOOKS 
Tue children each made a book in which to 
keep a record of all the numbers learned. 
They each had five sheets of paper 6X8’. 
They counted the sheets. Each sheet made

CHAPTER XXII 
MARKETING THE SCHOOL GARDEN 
PRODUCE 
Tue last week of school, the children invited 
their mothers to come to their Garden Market 
to buy radishes, lettuce, and onions. On the 
appointed day, the children picked their 
produce, washed it, tied it in bunches, and 
covered it with wet cloths. They printed 
price-tags and arranged the produce on long 
tables in the garden. Lettuce sold for 5 cents 
a bunch, radishes, two for 5, and onions three 
for 5 cents. At the end of the sale, each child 
counted his proceeds, and placed the amount on 
the board. The room made $9.50, which was 
used for buying tools for the classroom work- 
bench.

CHAPTER XXIII 
PLANNING A FLAG 
~ On Memorial Day, the school had outdoor 
exercises, each room marching to the place of 
meeting carrying a flag. During the class 
discussion previous to the exercises some chil- 
dren suggested buying a flag, and others 
wished to make one. The latter plan was 
accepted. The children bought the material 
and the staff from the money left over from 
the candy sale. In order to find out how much 
material to buy, the children measured a flag 
which they thought they could easily carry 
upon a staff. They found the dimensions of 
the blue field first and allowed for seams. 
They placed these dimensions upon the board. 
Blue field 2434” x 2634” 
With the yard measure, different children 
took turns measuring the stripes. They 
found that if they measured one short stripe

and one long stripe, they had the measure- 
ments for all the others. These measurements 
were also placed upon the board. 
4red_ stripesl yard, 7 in. long, 314 in. wide. 
3 white stripes 1 yard, 7 in. long, 314 in. wide. 
3 white stripes 1 yard, 33 in. long, 314 in. wide. 
3red_ stripes 1 yard, 33 in. long, 314 in. wide. 
The children worked in twos, cutting paper 
patterns of the stripes from paper the width of 
bunting. One child cut the pattern for the 
field of blue. Some of the other children 
found that from a two-inch square, they could 
cut stars of the proper size for patterns. 
When all the patterns were cut, the children 
laid all the patterns for the long and short red 
stripes on paper the width of bunting. They 
remembered that in all other patterns they 
had cut, they had to allow for seams or hems. 
After allowing 34 of an inch on one side and 
on one end for seams, the children found that 
they needed two pieces of bunting, one red and 
one white, each 1 yard and 3334 inches long. 
The bunting made seven red stripes and seven

white ones. Since only six of the latter were 
needed, the seventh was used in making the 
stars. 
The teacher and the children bought the 
bunting. It was $.25 a yard. Upon arriving 
home, the children calculated the cost on the 
board. One child wrote the following items, 
with some help from the teacher. 
2 yards red..... $50 (The storekeeper 
would not sell 1 
yard, 3334 inches 
exactly.)

At a mother’s meeting a machine was brought 
in from the sewing-room, and the mothers 
made the flag. Two of the larger boys of the 
class were elected by the children to be their 
flag-bearers in the Memorial Day procession.

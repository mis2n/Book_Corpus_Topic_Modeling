BASIC STANDARDS IN 
CHILD TRAINING 
An attempt to set down in the form of gen- 
eral principles some of the wisdom gained by 
contact with the children and teachers of the 
Merrill Palmer School of Detroit. 
Illustrated out of the experience of the Nurs- 
ery School in dealing with children between 
two and five, but applicable to other ages in 
schools or homes. 
Arranged conveniently for the uses of groups 
of parents, classes of girls, or others engaged 
or interested in the training of little children. S

SOURCE AND AIM 
Tue purpose of this book is not primarily 
to add to the great and growing volume of 
material available to the student of child 
health and child psychology. It is rather to 
present to the interested adult the body of 
doctrine which has grown out of the research 
work of specialists in these fields, to indicate by 
illustrative examples the inductive processes by 
which these conclusions have been arrived at, 
and to suggest a method of using individual 
experience to contribute to the further evolution 
of sound theory. It is designed to serve not as a 
final source of information, but as a stimulus to. 
the seeking of information, and as a guide to 
show how and where reliable information may 
be found. It aims especially to state the funda- 
mental principles underlying the training of 
children in a definite form suitable for use in 
the home, in short courses for parent-teacher 
associations or kindergartens, other adult 
groups, or as a text-book for high school classes’ 
of girls in home economics, embodying in a ty si

central core the theory to be supplemented by 
actual practice in child care. 
The Merrill Palmer School is an institution 
endowed under the will of the late Mrs. Lizzie 
Merrill Palmer of Detroit, for training of girls 
for motherhood. The girls in training are stu- 
dents in various colleges and universities. Their 
work deals with child health and nutrition, child 
psychology, child management, and educational 
method. To provide them with practice an 
experimental nursery school is maintained. 
The little children who attend the school furnish 
most of the illustrative material which follows. 
The staff of specialists who conduct the school 
have contributed the scientific research work 
from which are drawn the conclusions herewith 
submitted. To Miss Edna N. White, director, 
I am indebted for the generous and whole- 
hearted gift of the keys of the school, which, 
literally speaking, has meant the freedom of 
the building, the resources of the library, the 
use of a delightful lecture room for extension 
classes, and an ideal place to study at those 
evening and holiday hours when public offices 
are janitorless and cold—and figuratively

speaking has meant sharing the joys of a 
pioneer educational experiment, sitting in at 
fruitful conferences and seminars, and contact 
with the many worth while people from all over 
the world who have come to see and study and 
gone forth to praise. Miss Lila Skinner, dieti- 
tian, has contributed the results of her experi- 
ments in the feeding of the children, and has 
critically read and revised the material dealing 
with physical development, which also has been 
passed on by Dr. Icie Macy, nutrition specialist. 
For the material on children’s clothing Miss 
Ellen Miller, in charge of extension work, is 
the authority. Miss Rachael Stutsman, fellow 
in psychology, conducted most of the mental 
tests whose results are presented in the section 
on mental development. Miss Emma Henton, 
Miss Winifred Harley, and Miss Christine 
Heinig, nursery school teachers, were the first 
to tell me most of the tales of individual children 
which follow. Many of these tales have been 
by this time retold to many audiences. We have 
all used each other’s stories, studies, and sta- 
tistics whenever possible. What I, technically 
an outsider, have attempted here is simply to

put them together in connected form, For the 
material itself I am indebted to them all, but to 
none so deeply as to my beloved friend, Dr. 
Helen T. Woolley, psychologist in charge of the 
nursery school, whose patient and loving re- 
searches, in the light of her rare powers of 
insight and interpretation, have led her farther 
than anyone I have ever known into the heart 
of childhood.

INTRODUCTORY

“Teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.” 
JupGES, xiii, 8. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE IMPRESSIONS 
OF EARLY CHILDHOOD 
Tue modern state, in the exercise of its 
power of guardianship, asserts with confidence 
and emphasis its right to intervene between 
parent and child to protect the rights of the 
child in behalf of the citizen of the future. It 
postpones the parents’ enjoyment of the child’s 
earnings by prohibiting or restricting child 
labor. It holds the parent to his responsibility 
for the child’s education by enforcing school 
attendance.! | Its authority extends even to the 
“power of arbitrarily removing the child from 
the unfit parent. But most of its active inter- 
vention begins with what may be roughly termed 
the school age. | From the time the child enters zs :
-P-A-G-E-18

the kindergarten the power and protection of 
the state begin to encompass him. Though the 
state may fall short in carrying out its ideal 
program of child welfare, at least it does to 
some extent provide the machinery for exercis- 
ing trusteeship over its children until they are 
able to assert their own rights for themselves. 
Before the school age, however, the child has 
been left almost entirely to the care of the 
parents, partly on the naive assumption that 
“‘ natural instinct ’’ is a safe guide in the train-_ 
ing of young children, partly because the com- 
munity has been slow to realize the immense 
significance of the impressions received in 
early childhood. 
A BETTER ENVIRONMENT FOR THE BABY 
We have only just begun to question the 
wisdom of this system—to ask ourselves how far 
parents in general have justified this confidence, 
and to perceive that community interest in 
childhood is weakest during the period between 
two and five years of age..The very little baby 
is much better looked after. His novelty and 
frailness keep him an object of tenderest atten-
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE NEEDS OF THE TODDLER 5 
tion and concern. The vigorous campaigns that 
have been carried on by government and private 
agencies to reduce the rate of infant mortality, 
the multiplying of baby clinics, the ‘‘ better 
babies ’’ contests, the efforts of women’s clubs, 
the stream of authoritative publicity available 
to all through newspapers and women’s maga- 
zines—all these forces have combined to pro- 
duce a better environment for the baby. But 
for the child who has passed out of babyhood 
and has not yet reached the school age, there 
has been much less community concern. We 
have tended to slip back into the comfortable 
theory that all that is really needed to tide him 
over until the school age is to keep him free 
from actual illness and reasonably happy and 
let him vegetate, and that to perform this easy 
task the average mother in the average home is 
abundantly competent. We have even carried 
this comfortable theory so far as to assume that 
for the average mother in the average home no 
special training in child care is necessary, an 
attitude which has fostered a very general and 
complacent ignorance of the needs of children 
under school age, so that the kindergarten finds
-P-A-G-E-20
6 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
them already sadly handicapped. We have 
barely arrived at the point where the group at 
last perceives that our schemes of education for 
girls have omitted the special training for the 
kind of life we know that most of them will 
live, although the unfortunate results of this 
lack of training are all about us. 
MOTHERS AND TEACHERS 
In our slow arriving at this point, moreover, 
we have been building up a tradition whose 
inertia is hard to overcome. There is the stand- 
ard that any mother is a better authority on 
children than any teacher. There is the stand- 
ard that home and school aygseparate ‘‘ fields,’’ 
and should not interfere wy other’s affairs. 
There is the theory that tfaining in practical 
life activities, to be effective, should be deferred 
until the student is confronted with the actual 
situation, which is reaching beyond the grasp 
of our present educational system, and forget- 
ting that many girls are already grappling with 
the problem in the character of elder sisters. 
Most fundamental of all, there is a sensitively 
felt class consciousness—in the upper groups 
an aristocratic assumption of inborn infalli-
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE NEEDS OF THE TODDLER 7 
bility in matters of daily living and upbringing ; 
in the lower groups a desperate imitation of that 
Olympian rejection of instruction. And there 
is always the practical difficulty of providing a 
satisfactory method of instruction. The ideal 
method should be, of course, a laboratory 
method—actual practice with children. And 
when this method is attempted or discussed, the 
doubters begin their anxious questions :’ Where 
are the children coming from? Would mothers 
surrender three and four year old children to 
the schools? Should they be permitted to do so 
if they would? Where could you get competent 
teachers? How could you regulate numbers to 
provide enough practice for training classes 
without eoliglgptren Would the present 
type of school butldings be suitable? If not, 
what kind should be provided? And where 
would the money come from? 
While this discussion is going on, the un- 
fortunate conditions continue to challenge our 
educational systems. Consider the standards 
revealed in such casual remarks as these, made 
recently by pupils in evening schools: ‘I’ve 
been trying to bring our baby over for you to 
see, but the darn little thing goes to sleep on me
-P-A-G-E-22
  8 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
every night when it’s time to start. She’s only 
six months old, and she spills tomatoes all down 
her front too cute for anything. And you ought 
to hear her holler when we quit feeding her 
sweet potatoes.’’ 
“« Yes, I told my sister she shouldn’t feed 
her kids tea and coffee when they’re only two 
and three, but she started it on ’em when they 
was little babies and now she can’t break it on 
’em. They’d yell like the devil if they didn’t get 
it. They don’t mind her good. They’re afraid 
of their pa when he’s home, but she can’t hurt 
?em enough.’’ 
All around us in our cities we see these 
unfortunate babies, devouring pickles and 
bananas in their go-carts, late at night falling 
asleep in crowded street cars, or pitifully wide 
awake at the movies. We know that they are 
objects of love and hope and sacrifice and that 
the trouble is simply that their parents are 
untrained. We are so used to it that for the 
most part we accept it as something we are 
powerless to prevent.*

THE DAY’S ACTIVITY OF THE THREE < 
YEAR OLD 
The three year old, in hundreds of thousands 
of American homes begins his day by getting 
along as best he can while mother cooks the 
breakfast and gets father off to work and the 
older children off to schcol. He follows mother 
about, more or less in the way, while she washes 
the dishes and makes the beds and bathes the 
baby. Of course he is learning something from 
his environment, but very little is actually 
planned for his training or happiness. If he is 
very lucky he finds other children of his own age 
to play with. Too often he is merely turned 
loose in the yard (if there is one) and hedged 
about with prohibitions as to how far he may 
wander, or accompanies mother to the store, 
trotting beside the baby carriage. Then mother 
has to get lunch for the older children and wash 
the dishes, and put the baby to bed, and darn 
stockings, and take up the baby and wash and 
dress them both, and get dinner, and wash the 
dishes, and put the children to bed. How is she 
to keep rested and wise and fit to meet his 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
emergencies and play with him and tell him 
stories and solve his puzzles and develop in him 
tastes and appreciations and ethical standards? 
THE DEMAND FOR MOTHER TRAINING 
\, Only very recently have the mothers them- 
selves begun to realize and bewail their lack of 
training. But the demand is growing. Libra- 
ries are besieged for reliable material; news- 
papers are running ‘mothers’ columns ’’ 
edited by the best available authorities; 
women’s clubs and study classes and parent- 
teacher associations are urging serious and 
scientific study of childhood and its needs. The 
newly incorporated American Child Health 
Association of which Mr. Herbert Hoover is 
president has chosen as its most pressing prob- 
lem the need of the pre-school child. ‘‘ Until 
he’s two he’s a baby and baby is king,’’ says 
Dr. Philip Van Ingen, distinguished child 
specialist and secretary of the association. 
‘But after his second birthday what happens? 
He doesn’t go to the baby welfare station any- 
more. He isn’t received in many nurseries. He 
is too young to go to school. Probably there is 
 
-P-A-G-E-25

another baby in his mother’s arms. So he is 
neglected at just the age when he particularly 
demands care and attention . . . Iam convinced 
that the neglect of the pre-school child was 
mainly responsible for the appallingly large 
number of physically deficient youths dis- 
covered by our army examiners during the 
war.’’ He further points out the hopelessness 
of leaving the correction of these conditions in 
the hands of the ordinary mothers ‘‘ You can 
put a baby in a crib and let it sleep,’’ he says, 
‘“< But you have to amuse a child of three and 
it’s no easy job. You have to keep this child out 
in the open air: it’s one woman’s job to keep a 
child of pre-school age playing safely in the 
park. If a child of that age is not watched— 
well, for one thing, any article the child touches 
may go into its mouth. Yet how can the mother 
in poor circumstances, with several other chil- 
dren, a smaller baby among them, with her house- 
work and her husband—how can this woman 
spend a long day outdoors with her young child? 
If she’s careful and conscientious, she keeps it 
in the house most of the time—and there again 
the child suffers.’’

  12 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
In a series of articles written for the 
Woman’s Home Companion, Mrs. Ethel Puffer 
Howes has been voicing the protest of the every 
day American woman against the impossible 
burden she is expected to assume. In response 
to the magazine’s invitation letters have come 
from all parts of the country detailing the 
record of drudging days and demanding a 
measure of relief in the care of little children in 
order to care for them better. Codperative 
schemes for lightening the labor are being sug- 
gested, tried, and reported on. Here and there, 
small groups of women have combined to em- 
ploy a nurse or kindergartner. 
The American Association of University 
‘Women has recently taken the education of the 
pre-school child as one of its main subjects for 
investigation, employing for this purpose a spe- 
cial salaried assistant to the general secretary. 
EARLY TRAINING AND ITS EFFECT ON 
LATER LIFE 
Along with this growing consciousness of the 
need for training in child care comes the voice of 
authority, telling us with more and more cer- 
tainty that these very years during which the 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE NEEDS OF THE TODDLER 13 
child is left to the mother’s inexpert and unaided 
care, are the most critical period in his develop- 
ment. The work of Freud and his pupils, and of 
an increasing number of physicians and psychia- 
trists is pointing more and more to the inescap- 
able conclusion that the impressions received at 
this early age are imperishable and fraught with 
momentous consequences, that the nature of 
these impressions determines much more largely 
than we had dreamed the destiny of the indi- 
vidual—whether he is to become a normal 
person, capable of adjustment with his environ- 
ment, or an abnormal person, incompatible with 
the world in which he lives. We are told, for 
instance, of great harm in adult life resulting 
from unwise emotional treatment of children’s 
lies or tantrums or curiosities. We are warned 
that serious pathological disturbances arise 
from natural impulses repressed or fears 
aroused or truths distorted in early childhood.- 
We have begun to realize that habits, good and 
bad, of lifelong tenacity are being formed in the 
three year old child; that powers are being born 
in him that need wise direction or restraint; 
that standards of behavior are developing from 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  14 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
his contacts with his group. We are coming to 
see that in order to develop right habits and 
powers and standards he must be provided with 
the best possible environment, and that no ordi- 
nary home can provide the best possible condi- 
tions for three year olds, any more than for six 
year olds, for twenty-four hours a day unaided. 
THE IDEA OF THE MERRILL PALMER SCHOOL 
This is to say, we are awakening to the need 
for an earlier beginning of organized education. 
Such an awakening can be greatly stimulated, 
of course by the work of private agencies. 
Detroit is fortunate in having in the Merrill 
Palmer School an agency able and willing to 
conduct an experimental nursery school for the 
purpose of demonstrating this need. The 
Merrill Palmer School is an institution endowed 
under the will of Mrs. Lizzie Merrill Palmer for 
the training of girls for motherhood as 
expressed in the following clause: ‘‘ I hold pro- 
foundly the conviction that the welfare of any 
community is divinely and hence, inseparably, 
dependent upon the quality of its motherhood, 
and the spirit and character of its homes, and
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE NEEDS OF THE TODDLER 15 
moved by this conviction, I hereby give, devise 
and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder 
of my Estate, of whatsoever kind and character 
and wheresoever situated, for the founding, 
endowment and maintenance, in the City of 
Detroit, or in the Township of Greenfield, 
County of Wayne, State of Michigan, of a 
school to be known as the Merrill Palmer 
Motherhood and Home Training School, at 
which, upon such plan and system, and under 
such rules and regulations, as shall, in the 
judgment and wisdom of those upon whom the 
adminstration shall devolve, be adopted, girls 
and young women of the age of ten (10) years 
or more shall be educated, trained, developed 
and disciplined with special reference to fitting 
them mentally, morally, physically and relig- 
iously for the discharge of the functions and 
service of wifehood and motherhood, and the 
management, supervision, direction and inspira- 
tion of homes.’’ * 
The will of Mrs. Palmer providing for the 
establishment of the Merrill Palmer School was 
signed May 17, 1916. Mrs. Palmer died July

  16 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
28, 1916, and the will was admitted to probate 
June 26, 1918. The court ordered that as soon ~ 
as possible after the will had been admitted to 
probate the Executors convey all the property, 
both real and personal, coming into their hands 
and belonging to the trust created by Mrs. 
Palmer’s will, to a corporation to be thereafter 
formed and named the Merrill Palmer Mother- 
hood and Home Training School. On October 
20, 1918, the corporation of five men was organ- 
ized. One of the first official acts of this body 
of men was to select as associates six women. 
Their particular responsibility was to be the 
actual organization of the school from the point 
of view of the needs of girls and women, while 
the men were to retain the business administra- 
tion of the corporation. Miss Edna N. White, 
Head of the Department of Home Economics at 
the University of Ohio, in charge of academic 
work, extension, and teacher training, and at 
that time President of the National Home Hco- 
nomics Association was appointed as general 
director and began her work in February, 1920. 
In the spring of 1921, Miss White presented 
to the board a plan for the establishing of an
-P-A-G-E-31
  
“THE NEEDS OF THE TODDLER 17 
experimental nursery school on the lines of the 
nursery schools in England under the Fisher 
Act, with the aim of providing an adequate 
laboratory for the training of girls in child care 
and of measuring the value of certain types of 
training for children of pre-school age. The 
plan was approved, and Miss White was sent 
to England to study the nursery schools there. 
On her return in the fall the project was pushed 
rapidly forward. The choice of a director had 
been from the first a matter of concern. It was 
felt that whoever was to pioneer this field in 
America should be a woman of outstanding 
ability, with broad educational background and 
experience, the originality to develop new 
methods, particularly along the lines of mental 
development, and a national reputation which 
would insure general interest and confidence. 
Such qualifications are easier to formulate than 
to secure, but by great good fortune the Merrill 
Palmer School was able to realize this ideal in 
Dr. Helen T. Woolley, who was resigning her 
position as Head of the Vocational Guidance 
Bureau of Cincinnati Public Schools to live in 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  18 TRAINING THE TODDLER % 
Detroit, where her husband’s work had called 
him. Mrs. Woolley began organizing the work 
in the fall of 1921. Miss Emma Henton, Head 
of an English Nursery School, was secured as 
teacher. Arrangements were made with 
Michigan Agricultural College to permit senior 
students to enter the Merrill Palmer School in 
groups of six for a twelve week term of instruc- 
tion in home-making and child care, and the 
school opened with thirty children enrolled in 
January, 1922. 
THE NURSERY SCHOOL 
The building secured by the trustees for the 
nursery school and main offices is a fortunate 
choice. It was the home of the late Mr. Charles 
M. Freer, wealthy and well known art collector, 
during whose lifetime it was much visited by art 
lovers and frequently thrown open to groups 
representing civic or educational interests. 
There were two large galleries, housing a fine 
collection of oriental paintings which were left 
by Mr. Freer’s will to the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion. These galleries, of fire proof construction, 
were difficult to alter to the uses of a home, but
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE NEEDS OF THE TODDLER 19 
admirably adapted to the purposes of the school. 
The location on Ferry Avenue near Woodward, 
in a once “‘ desirable residence section,’? now 
encroached upon by stores and cheaper dwell- 
ings, is a good centre from which to draw all the 
various types of children who will later attend 
the public schools. In the second year, the house 
next door, another stately old home, was secured 
as living quarters for students and the enlarged 
staff. A little house in the rear which had been 
used as servants’ quarters was fitted up as a 
laboratory for mental testing. 
EQUIPMENT CHOSEN TO MEET 
THE CHILD’S NEEDS 
The equipment of the nursery school proper 
has been chosen with the idea of providing for 
the children an adequate and attractive though 
simple and practical material environment. Out- 
doors there are tiny teeters, slides and swings, 
and a big sandpile. The indoor equipment is 
adapted in size and character to the uses and 
handling of the children. The floors of the play- 
rooms are covered with heavy linoleum, easy to 
mop and easy to fall on. The downstairs room
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
is equipped with little tables and chairs and 
lined with low shelves, for all sorts of play- 
things—dolls, toys, blocks, pictures, books, 
building material—everything likely to help a 
child enjoy a pleasant and profitable day. In 
the store room, ready to be dragged outdoors, 
are velocipedes, wagons, kiddie cars, large 
building blocks, sand pails and shovels and little 
gardening tools. Hach child has his own par- 
ticular cupboard in the cloak room and his own 
towel hook in the bath room, which he knows by 
gay little pictures pasted above them. 
Nothing has been bought without the aid of 
thoughtful study and expert judgment, which 
care has been repaid by a most attractive 
general effect. The quiet, harmonious coloring 
and the scrupulous neatness and order produce 
a very pleasing and appropriate setting for the 
delightful play of every day. 
ACTIVITIES OF THE SCHOOL DAY 
The nursery school day begins about eight 
o’clock in the morning for John’s mother and 
Helen’s are teachers, Jessie’s ‘‘goes out by the 
day ’’? and Sammy’s auntie works in an office

down town. These children are usually the first 
arrivals. A little later and one at a time come 
those who are driven to school in state by 
fathers on their way to business/ About nine 
the school bus drives gaily up and_releases its 
impatient load of youngsters, the teacher in 
charge apparently attempting a lively imper- 
sonation of the old woman who lived in a shoe as 
she tries to make herself heard above the shout- 
ing and laughter and the excited barking of the 
driver’s Airedale. This long drawn out period 
of arrivals has the advantage of giving the 
teachers more of an opportunity to welcome the 
children individually, and confer with the par- 
ents than would be possible in an ordinary 
schedule-ridden school. 
All the regular activities throughout the day 
are consciously made educational processes. 
Each child, on arriving in the morning, takes 
off his own wraps and hangs them in his own 
cupboard with as little assistance as possible. 
When wraps have been removed, each child is 
inspected by a Board of Health nurse stationed 
at one end of the cloak-room. No child enters. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38

the playroom without passing this inspection. 
If there is evidence of cold or fever the child is 
sent home. If there is any minor ailment that 
can safely be cared for at the school, the nurse 
attends to it. She may, for instance, prescribe 
quiet, or indoors, or a modification of diet, or 
exercise for the day. This precaution has prob- 
ably helped very much in keeping the children 
in good condition and preventing outbreaks of 
contagious disease. 
After a morning of outdoor play in the sand- 
piles, on the swings and teeters, with wagons 
and kiddie cars and velocipedes, the children go 
intodinner. Just before the serious business of 
table-setting begins they gather for a few 
moments in a circle for a story and a little music. 
A very enlightening flow of conversation is an 
entertaining feature of this period. This is the 
dread age of endless questioning—of that 
insatiable appetite for stories which will 
swallow the most improbable of wonder tales, 
which relishes the same ones over and over, and 
can stili stomach the Chicken Little style of 
repetition. This is the time of memorizing by

rote rather than logic, as illustrated by EHliza- 
beth’s prayer: 
‘* Now I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep;’’ 
“* Tf he hollers, let him go, 
Eny, meeny, miny, mo! ”’ 
Imagination~is very lively. Fact and fancy 
are likely to trip each other up, as when Johnny, 
on his way to school, ‘‘ meeted a high cat ’? who 
suddenly departed from realism by remarking, 
‘¢ Hello, who’s this little boy? ”’ 
The dinner scene suggests a Barrie play. 
The charm of the conversation that goes on 
about the tiny tables is the charm of the Never 
Never Land. David, impressed by the little 
grace the children have sung, neglects his soup 
to say with a smile of reminiscent pleasure, 
‘“<That was pretty. It was pretty. Wasn’t it 
pretty? ’? But no one else at his table is inter- 
ested in the grace. He gives it up and attacks 
his dinner. Brown-eyed Rachael, at another 
table is entertaining a grown up guest. ‘‘ Do 
you like this dinner? ’’ she asks seriously. “ It’s 
from God.’? Some quality of other-worldli- 
ness in her tone affects the nerves of timid little

Edward. He moves uneasily, frowns over his 
plate and remarks defensively, ‘‘ I’m a good 
boy. Ieat all my carrots.’? James, eating very 
slowly and daintily, regards Annie with marked 
distaste. ‘‘ You gobble,’’ he proclaims senten- 
tiously. His reproof is lost on the lively Annie 
who is watching the cautious approach of 
Dorothy, balancing a glass of milk on a tray. 
‘‘ Bring me some more milk, Dorothy,’’ she 
shouts, beating the table with her spoon. 
Dorothy stops, regards her critically, and 
remarks in a quietly rebuking tone, ‘‘ I think, 
Annie, that if you want some more milk, the 
thing for you to do is to get up and get it 
yourself.”” She passes on to her own table, 
pausing just long enough to say to Lawrence, 
‘* You should serve every one else before your- 
self, honey.’’ 
Right after dinner the children go upstairs 
for their naps. Hach child has his own cot and 
blanket. The windows are kept open and the 
children warmly covered. They are required to 
be quiet until three o’clock. Most of them sleep 
soundly and wake rested and refreshed and 
ready to greet their parents, who are beginning

to come for them. Before they leave they are 
given a little fruit or half a glass of milk. 
They have had a day of ordered tranquillity 
and cheerfulness—a day of educative play with 
a rich variety of carefully chosen materials 
under wise and loving supervision—a day of 
wholesome association with their peers under 
the best conditions for physical, mental, and 
moral development, a day that has intelligently 
supplemented, not substituted for, the life of. 
the home to which they now gladly return. How 
significant the message they bring with them 
in their daily home-coming, we cannot guess. 
How far-reaching the effects of the training of 
this little group, we cannot calculate. We can 
only observe and record and seek for guiding 
principles. What seem at this point to be the 
most fundamental of these guiding principles 
are herewith tentatively submitted.

“The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his 
heart fretteth against the Lord.” 
PROVERBS, xix, 3. 
THE NEW SCIENTIFIC ATTITUDE 
Human nature is characterized by a lamen- 
table but fairly general streak of perversity 
which resents instruction and chafes under 
regulation. Forced by the conditions of life to 
submit to instruction and regulation at every 
turn, we find them particularly obnoxious when 
they intrude upon the few personal and private 
corners we dare to call our own. It is too bad, 
we feel, to make us wear the yoke of rule and 
measure even in the home, too bad to profes- 
sionalize our relation to our children. Now this 
is a very unregenerate attitude of mind to main- 
tain in the face of the disasters we continually 
bring on ourselves by our lack of training for 
parenthood. The first thing we have to do in 
making use of the material which follows is to 
subdue our froward hearts to a sober, calcula- 
~ ting consideration of the meaning of the experi- 
26 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  TWO LIONS IN THE PATH 27 
ence here set forth—to approach the problem 
from a scientific rather than a sentimental 
standpoint. 
STANDARDIZATION OF PARENTHOOD 
John Dewey, when he visited the Merrill 
Palmer School, implied its function in the 
remark: ‘‘ Parenthood is the last unstandard- 
ized profession.’?. The school is contributing 
toward the ‘‘ standardizing ’’ of training for 
parenthood by providing desirable conditions 
for the working out of sound principles. After 
we find that a certain method has been success- 
ful in a certain number of cases, we may assume 
that it is likely to prove a safe method to try. 
Of course we have always to make allowance 
for individual differences. Tach child must: 
always be studied as a separate problem. But 
if we have as a guide a method which has proved 
helpful with most children, we have at least a 
suggestive program which we may modify to 
suit the individual case. This is the way to use 
experience to increase the sum of knowledge— 
not only grandma’s experience—arrived at 
through chance opportunity, but accumulated
-P-A-G-E-44
  28 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
group experience, interpreted by trained inves- 
tigators who have at their command all that is 
known of the workings of the child mind. 
The hardest thing we have to do in attaining 
this scientific attitude is to realize what a long 
step it is from accepting a proposition to acting 
on it. One young mother, who seemed to the 
nursery school staff to have consistently vio- 
lated most of the rules which follow, has been 
deeply interested in the project of making a 
book of them and very confident of its value as 
a guide—to others. ‘‘Of course it is all so 
familiar to me, just what I always do,’’ she 
placidly asserts, to the blank amazement of her 
hearers. Another reports in all sincerity that 
the diet recommended for her child has been 
adhered to every day, when as a matter of fact 
it has been adhered to on an average of four 
days a week. It is so easy when we agree to the 
desirableness of a course of action, to convince 
ourselves that it is our regular practice. 
Fathers seem better able than mothers to main- 
tain an impartial attitude where children are 
concerned. Every teacher knows how rare is 
the mother who will admit her child to be at
-P-A-G-E-45
TWO LIONS IN THE PATH 29 
fault—how common the mother whose first 
impulse is to hide or deny the fault rather than 
to set about to correct it. If mothers will 
approach the suggestive standards which fol- 
low with a strictly appraising ‘‘ Do I do exactly 
this? ’’ attitude, instead of a defensively cock- 
sure ‘‘ This is exactly what I do ”’ attitude, they 
will find more readily the enlightenment 
they seek. 
WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH 
ENVIRONMENT 
The second thing we have to do is to banish 
the bogy of heredity. The child is what he is as 
a result of two factors—heredity and_environ- 
ment;--It.is too late to do anything about hered- 
ity, but we can do something about environment. 
It is easy to take a fatalistic tone about the 
qualities children have inherited. The nursery 
school authorities hear often that Billy has his 
father’s savage temper and Irene her mother’s 
nervous temperament. Yet in the rarefied atmos- 
phere of the school Billy’s temper ceases from 
troubling and Irene’s nerves are at rest. All 
the inherited devils seem miraculously exor-
-P-A-G-E-46
80 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
cised, forcing the investigator to the encourag- 
ing conclusion that Billy’s tantrums are the 
result not of inheritance from father but of 
living with father, and Irene’s nervous reac- 
tions are not so much inherited as directly 
stimulated by mother’s lack of control. This 
conclusion is encouraging because though we 
can’t help inheritance we can manipulate en- 
vironment. The school has demonstrated that 
the way the little actor plays his part is largely 
if not chiefly due to the way his stage is set. 
Some of the ways of setting the stage—of 
making environment serve the healthful devel- 
opment of personality—are here set forth under 
the heads of standards of physical, mental, 
emotional and social development. 
TEST EXERCISES 
1. Make a list of all the kinds of training you have 
received which you think have helped to fit you to 
bring up children. 
2. What resources does your community offer for 
training in child care? What classes, books, oppor- 
tunities for discussion are available? 
3. Make a study of the degree of interest in 
child-training which exists in your community. Com-

pare, men and women, parents and other adults, 
churches, social agencies, and clubs. 
4, Write your off-hand opinion of the nursery 
school idea. Compare it with your opinion after 
studying the subject and if possible visiting a nursery 
school. Try to account for your attitude. 
5. Compare the oldest and youngest children in as 
many large families as you know well. Can you 
trace any differences due to the parents’ growth in 
experience ? 
6. What do you consider the most serious mis- 
takes in your own training? How do you think they 
could have been avoided? Are you so determined 
to avoid them with your own children as to be in 
danger of going too far in the other direction? 
7. Note as many cases as possible where you have 
observed some definite improvement brought about in 
a child—some problem apparently on the way to be 
solved. What seem to you to have been the determin- 
ing factors in the treatment? 
$. Make a list of the mental and moral qualities 
your child seems to have inherited. Can you find any 
which may not be explained as the effect of environ- 
ment?

“They shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall

Isatau, xl, 31. 
Tue Merrill Palmer Nursery School has 
certainly something to say to the home concern- 
ing the physical development of children, for it 
has succeeded in making a most spectacular 
improvement in the physical condition of all 
the children who attend. It has done better for 
them not only than the average home, but even 
than the superior home. They have grown at 
have been cured completely of minor chronic 
difficulties such as slight anemia or constipation. 
The dietitian, in reporting on a group of twenty- 
four whose tendency to cdnstipation has been 
corrected, added the significant comment, 
“« though we do occasionally have a little trouble 
with them on a Monday morning, after a week- 
end at home.’’ Now how has this improvement 
been brought about? 
85 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  36 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
UNRELENTING REGULARITY A CONDITION 
OF DEVELOPMENT 
To begin with, every child is given a very 
thorough physical examination and laboratory 
test. Hach day he passes a nurse’s inspection 
before he enters the playroom. A constant and 
careful watch is kept over his nutritional con- 
dition and general development. A monthly 
record is made of his height, weight, and general 
condition. No guesswork is tolerated, no irreg- 
ularities in his daily schedule are allowed. 
Right habits are persistently drilled into him 
by steady insistence on regular wholesome 
meals, proper clothing, cleanliness, rest, fresh 
air, exercise, and fun. It is in the opportunity 
for this wurelenting regularity that the nursery 
school has one of its greatest advantages over 
the home. A schedule which is easily possible 
with trained specialists supervising each detail 
of the child’s day is almost unattainable under 
the direction of one mother who must adjust to 
the needs of a whole family. Yet since the school 
has demonstrated so conclusively that regu- 
larity is a condition of proper development, it 
seems only fair to insist in the face of all diffi- 
culties that regularity must somehow be secured.

PROPER FOOD AT REGULAR HOURS 
A very important element in physical devel- 
opment is regularity of diet. We are learning 
some significant things about the relation of a 
child’s personality to the food he eats. Some 
experts tell us that food determines gland secre- 
tions and gland secretions play a leading part in 
influencing behavior. Certainly the school can 
show a large and growing list of children whose 
behavior has improved along with their general 
health since they began eating proper food at 
proper and regular times. Now what are 
proper and regular times, and why are they so 
hard to observe in the home? To begin with, 
the little child should have his hearty meal at 
noon and a very light supper at five or there- 
abouts. This plan is fairly well carried out in 
England, even in ‘‘ lower middle class ’’ homes, 
where the family lunch is the children’s dinner, 
nursery tea an established custom, and evening 
dinner a function from which the younger chil- 
dren are excluded. In our American cities, how- 
ever, the usual plan is to give the children a hit 
and miss luncheon at noon and permit them to 
eat a hearty dinner in the evening when father 
comes home. It is too much work for mother or 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
38 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
the maid to cook vegetables and puddings at 
noon just for one or two little children, 
“< Their father likes to have them at dinner,”’ 
mother will argue, ‘‘ It’s his only chance to see 
them. And of course they want what they see 
the rest have,’’ or more recklessly still, ‘‘ We got 
along well enough on what the rest had. We had 
pie and doughnuts and tea at night and grew up 
all right.’’ 
NOON DINNERS AND LIGHT SUPPERS 
The mid-day dinner at the school is the main 
meal of the day. Its attempt to regulate diet 
may be undone, of course, by the two meals the 
children have at home. Most of the mothers, 
however, have codperated splendidly, keeping 
records of food eaten at home, following sug- 
gestive menus sent out by the school, and per- 
mitting no eating between meals. 
CULTIVATING TASTE FOR WHOLESOME FOOD 
The diet is planned to met the needs of each 
individual. The students who assist in the prep- 
aration and serving of the food are also required 
to make a study of the protein, calorie, calcium,
-P-A-G-E-57
  PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 39 
phosphorus, iron, and vitamin intake. Soup, a 
little meat, vegetables, milk, eggs, whole wheat 
bread and butter, fruit, and simple puddings 
make up the dinner menus. An effort is made to 
cultivate tastes for wholesome food, and to 
induce the children to conquer unreasonable 
dislikes. They will invariably learn to eat with- 
out protest at the school what they refuse 
at home. 
Marian, for instance, had acquired the habit 
of refusing food. Every time she was placed 
at the table she staged the same scene of defi- 
ance. Her mother tried coaxing, threatening, 
punishing, all in vain. Every meal ended with 
a regular battle, the child being finally whipped 
into submission. The first time she had dinner 
at the school she obviously assumed her war 
paint at the sight of food, and was as obviously 
disappointed when no war developed. The 
rejected dinner was quietly removed, and her 
mother was urged to see that she was given 
nothing until supper time, no matter how 
hungry she became. This simple treatment was 
at once successful. In less than a week Marian 
was eating regularly and contentedly at school, 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  40 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
though at home she continued to have relapses 
until grandmother could be prevailed upon to 
stop giving her cookies between meals. Of 
course the school had the advantage of the con- 
scious and unconscious influence of the group. 
It is an unusual child who can stand out against 
what all the other children accept as a matter 
of course. And the rebel is likely to be dis- 
ciplined by his peers. ‘‘ Aren’t you going to 
eat your dinner? ’’ demanded little Virginia, 
who was serving Marian’s table on one of the 
first days. ‘‘ If you don’t eat your dinner I’ll 
have to take it away,’’ and she bore the tray 
back to the serving table with an air of disap- 
proval which drew angry tears from Marian. 
Virginia regarded her thoughtfully a moment 
and. then proposed, ‘‘ If you’ll eat your dinner 
T’ll let you serve the dessert.’’? ‘‘ Can I pass 
all the dishes to the children? ’’ asked Marian, 
brightening. And, being assured that she could 
indeed, she surrendered unconditionally and ate 
all her.dinner. The new experience was more 
attractive than the accustomed row. The danger 
of allowing a row to become a regular event is 
of course the formation of the habit—the
-P-A-G-E-59
  PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 41 
attitude of mind that can’t get along without 
the row. 
(The only way to get food habits properly 
established with little children is to begin at the 
very beginning and simply take it for granted 
that they must eat what is set before them. Of 
course every effort should be made to get them 
to really enjoy their meals. Enough variety 
should be planned to stimulate the appetite. 
Children, like the rest of us, grow very tired of 
eating the same things day after day, and it is 
hard at the best to vary their restricted dict.\ 
Doctor Woolley’s little girl, lunching at the 
Woman’s Exchange, was asked what she would 
like. Laying down the menu card with a sigh, 
she responded, ‘‘ Anything but healthy food—I 
get so much of that at home.’’ 
VARIETY IMPORTANT IN ESTABLISHING 
FOOD HABITS 
To get variety within the limits of ‘‘ healthy 
food,’’ each day’s menu should include protein 
foods for tissue building and repairing, largely 
milk and eggs, fuel foods, as butter, starches, 
and a small amount of sugar; regulatory and 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
bone-building foods, or foods containing the 
various important mineral salts and bulk, as 
vegetables and fruits; and finally foods valued 
for their vitamin content, which is essential for 
growth and maintenance of health. Some of 
the school menus may be found in the appendix. 
In general the approved foods for little children 
‘are milk and eggs, soup, occasionally a little 
meat (broiled steak, lamb chops or chicken) 
whole grain cereals, whole wheat bread and 
butter, vegetables, fruits, and simple puddings. 
The prohibited foods are sweets (except a little 
candy after dinner) most meats, ‘‘ rich ’’ foods, 
such as pastry, fats, gravy, nuts, and cheese, and 
tea or coffee. No eating between meals should 
be permitted. | 
OVERCOMING DISTASTE WITHOUT 
4 INSISTENCE 
\ Resistance to food may be overcome in vari- 
ous ways, always depending on the child and 
the circumstances.\ Little games and plays are 
sometimes temporarily helpful. One baby had 
a beloved toy kitty who professed a joy in empty 
bowls, and would sit patiently on the floor until
-P-A-G-E-61
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 45 
the meal was over, waiting to climb up the high 
chair and caper with ecstasy at sight of the 
bottoms of the dishes. ( Withholding some 
desired tidbit until the spinach or carrots are 
eaten is often effective. But the best way to 
get children to eat and enjoy their meals is 
through daily example. If meal times are 
treated as enjoyable feasts, if no mention is 
made of distastes, if adults eat willingly and 
_ cheerfully what is set before them, the chances 
are that children will do the same, ) In the 
nursery school even those children who were 
reported as unfavorably affected by some article 
of food, such as spinach or egg, have responded 
negatively to sensitization tests, showing that 
what inhibition existed was not physical, but 
mental./ We do not know much about how food 
prejudiees get started, but what little we do 
know indicates that the trouble is the result 
either of some chance disagreeable association 
—such as Agnes indicated in insisting that 
macaroni made her think of worms, in imitation 
of the behavior of adults, or of injudicious 
insistence} If a child is forced to eat more than 
he really needs—beyond the point of satiety,
-P-A-G-E-62
44 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
or when he is slightly ill—he is likely to develop 
an attitude of resistance which is hard to over- 
come. The hard thing of course is to know when 
to insist—and it is here that ‘‘ maternal 
instinct ’’ comes in. 
CLOTHING—A. FOR COMFORT AND 
CONVENIENCE, NOT CARE AND ANNOYANCE 
Another very important factor in a child’s 
in selecting a child’s clothing should be not 
style nor beauty primarily, but the comfort and 
convenience of the child... Sometimes the 
nursery school children seem obsessed by the 
fear of injuring their clothing. George, at 
three, was so impressed with the immaculate- 
ness of his tiny trousers that he could not be 
induced to sit down for fear of soiling them. 
Mary wept bitter tears over a soup stain on her 
new silk dress. Annie kept wistfully aloof from 
the slide lest it soil or muss her light blue coat. 
Harold, when asked what faults he was punished 
for at home replied, ‘‘ I set on the davenport 
(evidently a cherished piece of family furni- 
ture) in my dirty pants, I set in the dust in my
-P-A-G-E-63
   PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 45 
clean pants.’? Now this is all nonsense. While 
it may be proper to check undue destructiveness 
or wanton carelessness, it is certainly unfor- 
tunate to give children a disproportionate 
respect for material things, to allow them to 
forget that the life is more than meat and the 
body than raiment. It is better to provide 
coarser garments and more of them than to 
check wholesome play or permit unneces- 
_ Sary worry. 
    B. SIMPLE TO MANAGE) ¥ 
Another important principle in clothing 
children is to see to it that dressing is as little 
of an ordeal as may be, and that they learn as 
soon as possible to dress themselves. The little 
baby hates to be dressed. He has no use for 
clothing and makes his objections very clear. 
And his objection to being twisted and turned 
with each separate garment is entirely reason- 
able. It is a most unnecessary proceeding. He 
can be dressed ‘‘ with one motion,’’ so to speak, 
by the following rule. First lay on a table (with 
a canvas top if possible) the little soft gown or 
night gown made with front closing all the way 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  46 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
down. On top of that lay the little shirt, also 
closing in front. Tuck the shirt sleeves inside 
the gown sleeves. Finally spread out the diaper 
(to be folded horizontally). Lay the baby on his 
back on the clothing, put his arms in the sleeves, 
and fasten everything in the front without turn- 
ing him. 
i Children of nursery school age are usually 
“ eager to dress and undress themselves. At 
school they are encouraged to do so with as little 
help as possible. Parents are perennially 
astonished at the proficiency developed by 
three year olds in taking off and putting on 
wraps, lacing shoes, buttoning leggings and the 
like. ‘‘ If I’d known she could learn so quickly 
I’d have let her do it long ago,’’ said Grace’s 
mother, watching the capable little fingers tug- 
ging at the stiff buttonholes. ‘‘ She has always 
wanted to, but I never had time to wait for her ”’ 
—a short sighted point of view, even from the 
busy mother’s standpoint, for independence 
means time saved in the end. With the aim of 
developing independence the school recommends 
that garments fasten in front with large buttons 
and easy buttonholes, rather than small hooks
-P-A-G-E-65
PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 47 
and eyes or the diabolical little loops so hard 
for tiny fingers to manage. An exhibit of model 
garments is kept at the school for educational 
purposes, including a complete set of infants’ 
clothing, samples of desirable underwear, 
attractive little dresses free from fussiness, 
and practical little trousers without the com- 
plicated closings that make independence all 
but impossible. 
C. SUITABLE TO SEASON fe 
A third important requirement for children’s } 
clothing is that it be suitable to the season. On 
the whole there is more danger of dressing 
children too warmly than not warmly enough, 
particularly in winter in our overheated Ameri- 
can houses. The safest solution is to provide 
light indoor and warm outdoor garments. 
Sweaters are not so warm as they look, the open 
weave letting in cold air very freely. A sweater 
is not suitable for very cold weather unless a 
light, closely woven garment is worn over it. 
Coats should be warm, but not heavy. Hllen’s 
coat, with its triple cape puts altogether too 
much weight on her slender shoulders. A belt
-P-A-G-E-66
48 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
around the hips, not the waist, helps to dis- 
tribute the weight. (Socks are considered unde- * 
sirable except in very warm weather, exposure 
of the knees interfering with circulation.) 
D. FREE FROM PRESSURE OR IRRITATION 
Great care should be taken to see that all 
clothing is loose and comfortable, with no 
pressure, rubbing, or irritation. Bloomer elas- 
tics should not leave marks on children’s legs. 
Outgrown underwear should be discarded. 
Starchy or scratchy surfaces should be guarded 
against. 
E. WITHOUT UNDUE PRIDE IN 
“OUTWARD SHOW” 
Finally the temptation to ‘‘ dress up ”’ chil- 
dren for the pleasure of adults should be sternly 
resisted. It is probably too much to expect of 
human nature that there shall not be special 
oceasions when the child must display himself 
in glad raiment before the admiring family— 
must turn about and ‘‘ show auntie ’’ and be the 
centre of attention. But these times should be 
few, and the opportunity should be used to call 
his attention to the attractive appearance of the 
other children, as all contributing to the general
-P-A-G-E-67
  PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 49 
festivity of the party, rather than to encourage 
vainglory, complacency, or odious comparisons. 
Otherwise he will take to peacocking and pride- 
ful strutting, or develop a false sense of the 
importance of outward show. 
A BED FOR EVERY CHILD . 
Of the ancient ‘‘ three requirements of 
man ’’—food, clothing, and shelter—the hard- 
est to provide for the modern city child appears 
to be shelter) The question of housing is one 
of the most serious problems we have to face in 
child care. Every child should have a bed to , 
himself and if possible a room to himself—a 
space of his own where he can keep his own 
possessions and be by himself at times.) Under 
present conditions this is often an unattainable 
luxury. Too many children, however, who are 
sleeping on window seats or couches in city 
apartments might be living in houses with yards 
in plainer suburban neighborhoods if mother 
were not afraid of the work, the unfashionable 
neighborhood or the distance from the shops 
and theaters. Lacking the big yard so sorely 
needed, the next best substitute is the liberal

use of the public parks and playgrounds, the 
walks to school and back, and plenty of fresh 
air within doors. 
CONTINUOUS FRESH AIR 
No child should ever play in a room with all 
the windows closed, even to protect the old or 
ill from ‘‘ draughts,’’ and of course the windows 
should be wide open at night. Anna Garland 
Spencer, in The Family and Its Members, says 
with truth and courage that no family living 
room is spacious enough for the continuous use 
of three generations. Little Dick has developed 
ear trouble which may prove serious as a result 
of playing in an apartment with windows shut 
to suit his grandmother. Of course it is easier 
to sacrifice Dick than to persuade grandmother 
to sit in her own room or brave the breeze with 
a shawl around her shoulders. But itis not fair 
to children to risk lung and throat troubles by 
depriving them of continuous fresh air. 
A DAILY BATH AND A DAILY “ CHANGE” 
Modern city civilization has at least made 
easy to manage another fundamental need of the 
child—the daily all-over bath. There is no real

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 51 
danger of the daily bath ‘‘ weakening ’’ the 
child, or ‘‘ washing away his strength ’’ in spite 
of grandma’s apprehensions. And the last place 
for a family with children to economize is the 
laundry. Now is the time to develop the habit 
of fastidious neatness so important in later life 
—the disposition that would rather wash out 
underwear and stockings nightly than wear 
them soiled. 
INVIOLATE NAP AND BEDTIME 
One of our greatest crimes against the child ae 
in these whirling times is in failing to see that 
he has sufficient rest. While we do at times keep 
him sinfully quiet, lest his ‘‘ racket ’’ disturb 
some tyrannical elder, we do at other times take 
unjustifiable liberties with the regular nap time 
and early bedtime that sometimes interfere with 
adult projects. The inevitable result is that the | 
child is over-stimulated and sooner or later 
shows it in some unfavorable reaction of mind 
or body. Children are naturally averse to being 
put to sleep and will do all they can to make it 
difficult. They will think of endless excuses for 
putting it off. Doris, not yet three, when
-P-A-G-E-70
52 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
sternly told to shut her eyes, replied sweetly, 
*“T can’t. You are so beautiful I have to look 
at you.’’ Dick’s mother reported that it was 
simply impossible to make Dick stay in bed. He 
insisted on getting up, no matter what was done 
to him. He had been coaxed, reasoned with, 
spanked, and still refused to rest in peace. 
Ruthless investigation revealed that he had 
occasionally been allowed to stay up and occa- 
sionally taken into mother’s bed. It was pointed 
out that it was in his occasional victories that 
the trouble lay. Of course he would take a 
chance. The only way to settle the matter was 
to stop coaxing, reasoning, and spanking, and 
simply put him back every time he got up. His 
mother objected that that would keep her up all 
night. It was pointed out that she could rest 
the next day, that it would probably not take 
more than three or four nights with shorter 
intervals of activity, that the fault was hers in 
the first place and that this was the only way to 
correct it. In a day or two she reported ‘‘ I’m 
ashamed to tell you how easy it was! The first 
night he did get up every little while until mid- 
night. We just kept putting him back. The
-P-A-G-E-71
  PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 53 
second night we hoped the siege would not be 
so long. He just went to bed like a lamb and 
has been no trouble since.’’ 
Every child under four should have at least 
an hour’s rest in the afternoon. The nursery 
school children sometimes protest that they 
“« don’t want to sleep.’’ ‘‘ You needn’t,’’? Miss 
Henton equably assures them. ‘‘ Just lie down 
and close your eyes and don’t go to sleep if you 
don’t want to.’? The children then relax con- 
tentedly and drift off to a sleep which sometimes 
lasts two hours. The afternoon nap should be 
continued even with school children on Satur- 
days and Sundays and during vacation. The 
child under two should sleep at least thirteen 
hours at night, the child under four, twelve, the 
child under six, eleven. 
ABUNDANT PLAY TO EXERCISE 
GROWING MUSCLES 
Little children need much more exercise than 
most of their guardians realize. They require 
space enough outdoors for the running, jump- 
ing, and skipping so essential for proper motor 
coérdination. If they do not get this training 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
in early years they cannot altogether make up 
for it later. They want to get up and run about 
after very short intervals of rest, and should 
not be restrained in this free activity. Types 
of play calling for the exercise of different 
musclés-should be encouraged. Slides, teeters, 
tricycles, Velocipedes and toy wagons are pro- 
vided at the school and the children learn to 
use them with pleasure and skill. 
IMPORTANCE OF A HAPPY 
MENTAL ATTITUDE 
Pleasure—a happy mental attitude—is a 
/ very important element in the physical well- 
being of children as of adults. Several cases of 
physical disturbance in the nursery school have 
been traced directly to unhappiness at home— 
objections to food caused by the irritation of 
listening to quarrelling at meals, rebelling 
against nagging or bossing methods of control, 
or nervous fears resulting from overhearing 
conversations about troubles half understood. 
Such worries bring about tensions which inter- 
fere with normal physical condition. One of 
the most impressive things about the nursery
-P-A-G-E-73
  PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT 55 / 
school is the obvious and continuous happiness 
of the children. The wholesome shouting and 
laughter, the smiling little faces, the zest with 
which the activities are entered into—all are 
eloquent of that mysterious relation between the 
spiritual and corporeal self which decrees that 
no physical regimen, however irreproachably 
regular, can be trusted to maintain health unless 
it can be practiced with willingness and joy. * 
TEST EXERCISES 
1. How recently has your child had a physical 
examination? What defects did it show? Are you 
proceeding on a definite program to remedy them? 
What progress has been made? How often is prog- 
ress measured? Do you know his exact weight and 
height and how they compare with the standard 
mieasures ? 
2. About how many times should you say off-hand. 
that you permit exceptions in the child’s regular 
physical routine to occur in the course of a month? 
Check up carefully for a month and see how many 
actually did occur. Give the cause of each infringe- 
ment (e.g., Christmas over-eating, or a party after 
bedtime). Did you notice any undesirable effects? 
3. What desirable foods does your child show 
distaste for? What undesirable foods does he like? 
How do you account for these food prejudices? What 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  56 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
are you doing to overcome them? How far are 
you. succeeding ? 
4. Has your child exhibited any special interest 
in clothes? Any marked likes or dislikes for special 
garments? Can you account for his attitude? How 
far can he dress himself? How much choice do you 
allow him? How much judgment does he show in 
what he wants to wear? 
5. Have you been able to set aside a room for each 
child? A corner of the nursery for each child? Does 
the child feel a sense of responsibility for his own 
place? Do you keep the windows of his playroom 
open? Does he play most of time outdoors? Does he 
get a chance to play frequently in big open spaces— 
the fields, the woods, the beach? 
6. At what age are your children able to take a 
daily all-over bath without supervision as a matter 
of habit? 
7. Do you know how much sleep the child gets? 
How early does he wake in the morning? Have you 
something for him to do when he wakes earlier than 
the adults? Does he take his nap as a matter of 
course? Count the number of times his nap is inter- 
fered with in a month. 
8. Does the child play eagerly and heartily, or 
does he have to be urged? Does he tend to sit still 
or lie down most of the time? Can he hold his own 
in outdoor games? 
9. Does the child enjoy his food, relax comfortably 
when he rests, find vigorous pleasure in the exercise of 
his developing physical powers?

PsauMs, exix, 34. 
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AN ORDERLY 
PROCESS FROM BABYHOOD 
Ir was taken the world a long time to chal- 
lenge the ancient custom of beginning system- 
atic education at six or seven years of age. We 
have been slow to realize that mental develop- 
ment begins in infancy and proceeds in orderly 
fashion—that it is possible to determine what 
a child should be able to understand at any given 
age, whether a particular child is at a given 
time advanced or retarded, and how to plan 
an intelligent program for his normal mental 
development. There is nothing occult or mysteri- 
ous about the method of working out such 
standards. It consists merely in accurately 
observing the performance of a sufficient num- ; 
ber of children at a given age to determine what 
the average performance is. In the nursery 
school, for instance, the children are given 
59 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
Madame Montessori’s ‘‘ pink tower ’’ to build. 
This consists of ten blocks, which they place in 
order from largest to smallest. All the four and 
five year olds have done it easily, and most of the 
three year olds, though they take a longer time. 
So far every two year old has failed. If a two 
year old succeeds, we may fairly conclude that 
he is ahead of his age in that particular kind 
of ability. Ifa four year old fails we may fairly 
conclude that he is behind his age in that par- 
ticular kind of ability. This is the way all 
standard tests have been worked out. 
THE VALUE OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
AS GUIDES 
There are as yet very few authoritative tests 
to measure the intelligence of children of pre- 
school age, because there have been so few 
opportunities to study them in groups. The 
school is making the best of its fine opportunity 
to add to the number. Noone claims that the 
tests are infallible. It is not necessary to accept 
them as gospel. They are simply the best means 
known of measuring mental ability, and consti- 
tute a valuable guide in directing a child’s edu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  BUDDING INTELLIGENCE

MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 61 
cational program. To the mother who is 
without nursery school advantages, but wishes 
to direct as wisely as possible the mental devel- 
opment of her children, the nursery school can 
give worth while assistance by furnishing her 
with definite standards of ability. These stand- 
ards are not all worked out in terms of scientific 
authority, but even the off-hand judgment of 
skilled experts, based on careful observation of 
large numbers of children, is a safer guide than 
untrained ‘‘ maternal instinct.’’ ‘‘ It is as silly 
to trust the maternal instinct to bring up a 
child,’’ says Doctor Woolley, ‘‘ as to trust the 
acquisitive instinct to earn a living for the 
family. Instinct is at the base of all we do, but 
does not relieve us of the necessity of training.’? 
MATERIALS FOR TESTING SENSE 
PERCEPTION 
What mental abilities, then, should be 
expected to develop before the child enters . 
kindergarten at five? Let us take, to begin with, 
the matter of sense training. Long before sys- 
tematic education begins the little child is 
learning his world through its spirited attack
-P-A-G-E-82
ee ee 
62 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
on his senses. He should be supplied with a 
rich variety of play material to train eyes and 
ears and touch—delightful things which he can 
recognize as hard or soft, heavy or light, rough 
or smooth. The nursery school children have 
blocks and beads, sand and clay, crayon and 
paints, paper and scissors, as well as the Mon- 
tessori materials. By observation and by tests 
the school is learning how to formulate a few 
authoritative standards as to the degree of 
sense perception which may be expected of 
children of different ages. Most children can 
be trained to distinguish color, for instance, in 
their second year, yet for lack of such training 
a goodly number reach the kindergarten with 
this faculty undeveloped. The little boxes of 
color cubes sold in toy shops make good educa- 
tional playthings. Picture puzzles are fine to 
develop judgments of size and shape. Hven 
two year olds can handle them successfully, 
though in a longer time than three year olds. 
All the five year olds in the nursery school have 
been able to touch the thumb and finger tips of 
one hand, all four year olds have done it in three 
trials, but all under three years and six months 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 63 
have failed. The two year olds in the nursery 
school enjoy playing in the sand—just letting 
it run through their fingers, pouring it, or filling 
and emptying pails. At three they begin to make 
cakes or dig tunnels or build houses. 
SIZE, SHAPE, SOUND AND WEIGHT 
The home kitchen offers a fine variety of 
sense training material, inexpensive and not 
easily broken. The three and four year olds who 
know the joys of measuring sugar, beating eggs, 
stirring batter, sifting flour, and handling 
dough, when mother makes a cake are getting 
splendid sense training. Children who enter 
kindergarten with the power of distinguishing 
differences of color, size, shape, sound, touch 
and weight are of course at a great advantage. 
HOW THE CHILD GETS HIS VOCABULARY 
Again take the use of language. The child | 
begins to use single words at from ten months 
toa year old. At twenty-three months he should 
,be using simple phrases. By the time he is 
"three he has a large vocabulary. (500 to 1500 
words) and can converse well enough for his
-P-A-G-E-84
ee et eee 
64 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
own practical purposes. The nursery school 
children exhibit marked differences in fluency, 
in extent and type of vocabulary, and in ability 
to make sentences, depending chiefly on what 
they hear at home, and on the range of their 
experiences. Of course the child’s own temper- 
ament isa factor in his language expression. 
David has a good vocabulary but is not a talka- 
tive child. Lillian speaks slowly and precisely 
because of her leisurely nature rather than any 
lack of proficiency. But the response of Billy’s 
mother to a comment on his use of slang, ‘‘ Well, 
I’ve told the crazy little nut to cut that 
out!’’? ig an excellent illustration of the 
general principle. 
~The child needs not only to hear good Eng- 
lish but to have a chance to practice it. In the 
first joy of the new power of expression he is 
apt to become very talkative, and demand an 
audience in and out of season. This impulse 
should be encouraged. Of course he should not 
interrupt, but neither should he be ruthlessly 
interrupted. The little girl who complained: 
‘“‘ Daddy scolds me for interrupting him, but 
when I just looked at him for interrupting me

MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 65 
he sent me from the table ’’—had justice on 
her side, even allowing for all that might have 
been expressed in her ‘‘ look.’ 
COMPREHENSION AS IMPORTANT 
AS EXPRESSION 
Another aspect of language training not 
always fully understood is the gauging of the 
child’s ability to comprehend what he hears 
others say.& Miss Henton says she has often 
to wait several minutes before a child obeys a 
request or suggestion. There is a very real 
danger of mistaking this slowness of response 
for indifference or disobedience, and arousing in 
the child a confused and bewildered resentment. 
We should always make sure that the child 
grasps what we are telling him—get his atten- 
tion to begin with, and give him time to ‘“‘ take 
iting? 
ROLE OF STORIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF APPRECIATION 
The importance of story telling for the edu- 
cation of the little child, is well enough under- 
stood by most mothers, even though too often 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  66 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
neglected. The stories most in demand in the 
nursery school are ‘‘ Chicken Little,’? ‘‘ The 
Little Red Hen,’’ ‘‘ The Three Bears,’’ and the 
‘“« Peter Rabbit Stories.’? The endless repeti- 
tion and the series effects make these stories 
easy for baby minds to follow. The child loves 
to listen to the same ones over and over, prob- 
ably because he takes in only a little at first and 
finds something new in every telling. He often 
knows a beloved tale word for word, and objects 
vigorously to the slightest change, omission, or 
addition. Doris and Hlizabeth had each been 
taught the little old French nursery song Frere 
Jacques—but one had learned to sing the last 
line ‘‘ Bim Bam Boum! ”’ and the other ‘‘ Ding 
Dong.’’ They enjoyed singing it together, but 
neither could. bear to change it, and so each 
vociferated her own climax, much to the mar- 
ring of the general effect. Very popular indeed 
in the nursery school are Lucy Sprague 
Mitchell’s ‘‘ Here and Now Stories.’’ These 
are a distinct departure from tradition, being 
built upon the basis of stories told by children 
rather than by adults. They deal with every- 
day experiences, such as getting dressed or
-P-A-G-E-89
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 67 
going to school, and with everyday objects, such 
as automobiles or engines. They are not usu- 
ally attractive to adults. The teachers were 
reluctant even to try them. But the children 
were enraptured at once. Day after day they 
demanded the book, and could hardly be torn 
from it even to go out to play. Even the two 
year olds, who had manifested no interest in 
anything but nursery rhymes, would listen 
enthralled to stories along this order, when told. 
about themselves. ‘‘ Shall I tell a story about 
Albert? ’? Miss Harley will begin, with a little 
group of two year olds. ‘‘ Well, Albert woke 
up from his nap, and opened his eyes, and got 
up from his cot, and had his face washed, and 
had a drink of water, and then the bus came to 
take Albert home, and Albert took Miss 
Harley’s hand, and they went to the cupboard, 
and put on Albert’s leggings, first one leg and 
then the other, and then his coat with the shiny 
buttons, and buttoned the buttons, one, two, 
three, four and then his cap, and then his mit- 
tens, first one hand and then the other, and they 
went out and got in the bus, and all the other
-P-A-G-E-90
  68 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
children got in, Billy and Tommy and Jennie 
and all, and the driver said ‘ All ready,’ and 
they started ‘ toot-toot ’ and by and by they 
came to Albert’s house, and there was Albert’s 
mother in the door. And she ran out and lifted 
Albert down and gave him a big hug,’’ and so 
on and so on through supper and bedtime, with 
every one still interested and all too ready to 
listen to the same tale with Billy or Tommy 
for hero. 
These stories were so stimulating as to be 
the source of some splendid play activities. 
‘““The Grocery Man’’ suggested making a 
grocery store out of the large Patty Hill build- 
ing blocks. It was an elaborate affair with a 
counter, over which were sold soap, plasticene 
oranges and grapefruit, and canned goods made 
of large empty spools painted appropriate 
colors to represent jelly and pickles. This was 
conceived and carried out by the children them- 
selves. The main difficulty appeared to be that 
the merchants became so attached to the goods 
that they refused to part with what they had 
sold, which considerably complicated their
-P-A-G-E-91
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 69 
transactions. Another ambitious group project 
was the building of a stage whereon was enacted 
the tragedy of ‘‘ Chicken Little.’’ The stage 
was a substantial platform made of the large 
building blocks, with impressive columns at the 
two outer corners. There was also a den for 
the villain fox, the rounded screen of blocks 
enclosing a rear corner. The fox, however, 
refused to stay in his abode and caused further 
concern by smiling most inappropriately. 
‘“‘ This is the way a fox should look,’’? remon- 
strated Florence, assuming an expression of 
ferocity and craft. 
Of course in this dramatic play the nursery 
school has again the great advantage of the 
group with similar interests. It can be done 
at home quite well, however, with the family 
and playmates as actors. The reproduction and 
discussion of stories should also be encouraged. 
Miss Harley has a delightful way of pausing for 
the comments of excited listeners without losing 
the thread of the story, so that they have a sense 
of participation and a consciousness of group 
* enjoyment,
-P-A-G-E-92
70 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
DEVELOPMENT OF OBSERVATION 
AND JUDGMENT. 
Another very valuable kind of mental train- 
ing that should be begun long before the school 
age is preparation for scientific thinking. The 
nursery school children are trained to observe 
carefully and report accurately and form 
judgments of their own. They have a little 
garden where they may dig and plant seeds and 
watch them grow, They note the arrival and 
departure of the birds, the building of nests, 
the hatching of eggs, and the feeding and train- 
ing of the young. Kittens and dogs have been 
brought to visit the school. On one occasion a 
lamb was the guest of honor. Rabbits are per- 
manent residents, much beloved. When the 
school went en masse to Belle Isle and saw the 
animals in the Zoo, they were deeply impressed 
by the elephant, the ostriches, the buffaloes, 
wolves, and bears, but it was the rabbits that 
roused the real burst of enthusiasm. Elizabeth, 
who lives in the country, was politely interested 
in all the animals at the circus, but asked her 
father not to forget to take her where the cows 
were. The thing we know through experience
-P-A-G-E-93
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 7 
becomes a part of us, and the more we know 
through experience the more at home we are in 
the universe. The power to reason and reach 
conclusions is sometimes present at three, 
though of course the background for logical 
argument is lacking. The three year old girl 
who met her mother’s warning, ‘‘ If you scream 
like that, you’ll ruin your voice,’’ with the royal 
response, ‘‘ Well, I’ll scream till I’m through, 
and then I’ll gargle,’’ had grasped the process, 
though she could not reach infallible conclu- 
sions. Bessie’s sage remark, ‘‘ Today is yester- 
day’s tomorrow ’”’ is an excellent example of 
logical thinking. 
THE NATURAL RESPONSE TO BEAUTY 
The art impulse—the desire to create beauty 
and the power to appreciate beauty—should be 
very tenderly nourished. It is present and 
active at three and expresses itself in various 
ways, in the love of stories and the making of 
imaginary stories and plays, in drawing and 
painting and modeling, in looking at pictures, 
and listening to music. Often it is hard to dis- 
tinguish between the real and the pretended  
-P-A-G-E-94
  72 TRAINING THE TODDLER’ 
world, and little children are sometimes 
unwisely reproved for lying when they are 
only legitimately romancing. When one can 
travel to New York or the moon by kiddie-car 
and set up housekeeping in a packing box, what 
is the use of confining one’s Muse to the dull 
bounds of actual happenings. 
NEED OF OUTLETS FOR THE 
CREATIVE INSTINCT 
The nursery school children are encouraged 
in imaginative play projects and in all kinds of 
creative art. Some of them display such definite 
powers and feel so definite an impulse to exert 
them that if not indulged they show a tendency 
to get satisfaction in undesirable ways. Lillian, 
for instance, was mad about plasticene. She 
never tired of modeling things, chose this activ- 
ity whenever there was a choice. Finally she 
began to take lumps of it without asking and 
hide it in her pocket. Miss Henton was ex- 
tremely anxious to avoid any suggestion of 
stealing, lest the idea of taking things as desir- 
able and yet wrong get started in the child’s 
mind, and so waited for an occasion when she
-P-A-G-E-95
Se RS I on ee 
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 73 
might actually see the theft of the stolen goods 
without making a delinquency of it by accusa- 
tions. Finally one morning Bobby lost his neck- 
tie and Miss Henton, helping him look for it, 
noticed an end of it sticking out of Lillian’s 
pocket. ‘‘ See, Lillian,’’ she said, in a natural 
tone, ‘‘ Here is Bobby’s tie in your pocket. 
Wouldn’t you like to take it back to him and 
help him put it on? ’? Lillian without a trace of 
confusion, acquiesced, and as she pulled out the 
tie a lump of clay rolled out with it. That day 
Miss Henton asked Lillian’s mother if the child 
had any plasticene at home. ‘‘ No,’ the mother 
said, ‘‘ she has been asking for it but I wouldn’t 
let her have it because it makes such a mess.   
Some one gave her some last year and it got in 
the rugs and all over the house.’’ ‘‘ I think it 
would be a good thing to let her have it,’’ 
advised Miss Henton. ‘‘ She’s a bigger girl 
now, and if you spread oilcloth or newspapers 
on a table I’m sure she could keep it in the one 
place. She would surprise you by the ability 
she shows in handling it. She made a really 
wonderful birdnest with eggs in it and a bird

sitting on them.’’? That very afternoon the 
mother got the plasticene and from that day 
Lillian has taken nothing more. 
EARLY LOVE OF MUSIC 
Most children find much joy in listening to 
music. The power to recognize tunes may 
appear as early as the beginning of the second 
year. Those that have the opportunity to hear 
good music at home are of course at decided 
advantage. At school the children are eager 
to dance to music, and try to sing, though very 
few can really ‘‘ carry a tune.’’ They have their 
favorite songs, which they call for and recog- 
nize. Edwin always wants ‘‘ Pretty Polly 
Perkins ’’ and Alice demands ‘‘ Dance to your 
Daddy.’’ Usually they prefer the cheerful, 
lively airs, though one mournful ditty, ‘‘ The 
Grey Goose is Dead,’’ is very popular, in spite 
of its tendency to affect the more sympathetic 
singers to tears. 
Some children show a decided feeling for 
beauty even before they are three. Doris, at 
two, cried at the sight of anything which seemed 
to her ugly. When she went to see Elizabeth, 
she was so repelled at the sight of a ‘‘ character
-P-A-G-E-97
STE Oe ON eee, LER PET elec SRR RPS eT a eR he STN 
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 75 
doll ’? with a crying face that she would not 
stay in the room with it. Elizabeth on the con- 
trary adored her ‘‘ funny ’’ doll and wept when 
it was relegated to the hall. Alice is sensitive 
to color, demanding her yellow hair ribbon to 
match her yellow bloomers. David is repulsed 
by the sight of spilled food or dirty hands. 
Bessie is particularly alive to beauty, and often 
shows delight over flowers or pictures. She was 
the first to notice a Raphael Madonna which 
had been placed in the playroom. After look- 
ing at it for a long time with evident pleasure 
she walked over to a modern mother and 
child picture, which had been hanging on the 
wall for some time, studied it awhile, and then 
said, pointing to the classic, ‘‘ That is the best,’’ 
a discrimination which may of course have been 
accidental. This attitude of mind, the need for 
harmonious adjustment to the material world, 
if wisely guided, is a source of life long riches. 
DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNICAL SKILL

practical skills involving mechanical ability and 
manual dexterity. Training for the development  
-P-A-G-E-98
  76 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
of these technical skills has now a recognized 
place in education and may very profitably be 
begun during the pre-school period. Besides 
the practice in washing and dressing themselves 
already referred to, the school children do many 
of the simpler tasks about the nursery schools, 
such as dusting, watering plants, setting the 
table, and serving dinner. One child is selected 
to serve each group of four or five and even the 
two year olds learn to handle the trays without 
accident. It is a pretty sight to see them run- 
ning up to the long serving table and walking 
carefully back. When anything is spilled the 
child responsible simply runs for mop and pail 
and helps remove the traces. Some children 
show particular interest in this sort of activity. 
David, for instance, hums a happy little tune 
as he goes about his labors, and Philip loudly 
chants ‘‘ Oh how I do love to walk around with 
trays!’’ Betty works like an adult with her 
capable little hands, helping all the others, rol- 
ling up cuffs, tying shoe laces, combing hair or 
laying the table cloth smooth. Many who enter 
the school quite helpless learn in a short time 
to use their hands very effectively and manage

all the materials presented to them. People 
who have early gained control over technical 
processes, who are skilled in the use of tools, 
and can make and mend for themselves ara 
much more at home in a world full of malevo- 
lent material objects than those who are with- 
out mechanical ability. 
DEVELOPMENT OF CONCENTRATION 
THROUGH INTEREST 
rf The home, then, can aid very effectively the 
mental development of children along many of 
the lines of traditional school training, and can 
begin even before the traditional school period. 
It can give training in sense perception, in the 
use of language,) in scientific observations and 
judgments, in appreciation of music, literature 
and art and in technical skills. The great danger 
in the hands of the average untrained parent 
is in attempting to teach too much at one time 
or in trying to force a child’s attention rather 
than to hold it through interest. Attention is a 
queer vagrant kind of quality, never staying 
fixed, but wandering off and having to be 
brought back again and again. The power of  
-P-A-G-E-100
  78 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
concentration is a most desirable gift and seems 
to be inborn in the individual, though it can be 
cultivated to some extent, and can be injured by 
injudicious treatment. Many parents do not 
realize, for instance, that it is bad practice to 
interrupt even a little baby who is concentrat- 
ing on something he wants to study. Yet babies 
often object very definitely to being torn away 
from what they are staring at. The only way a 
little baby has to increase his knowledge is to 
stare and touch and taste. One five-months old 
baby spent twenty profitable minutes investi- 
gating with her hands the edge of an open 
bureau drawer. When possible, children should 
be allowed to continue staring at and feeling an 
object of interest until they desist of their own 
accord. Breaking their attention tends to cause 
nervous irritation and resistance, and ulti- 
mately to break down their power of concentra- 
ee, The nursery school children differ widely 
in the length of time and degree of attention 
they put on their various projects, Donald will 
work contentedly for three-quarters of an hour 
at a time with the Patty Hill blocks, while Annie, 
the same age and equally bright, seems unable 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 79 
to carry through anything she starts. She will 
stop to play, to engage in irrelevant conversa- 
tion, or to call attention to what she has half 
done, and will abandon her tools and playthings 
and have to be called back again and again to 
put them away. Billy, violent and quarrelsome 
and emotionally unstable, has surprising powers 
of concentration. If he once starts a project he 
will work at it and stick to it regardless of what 
goes on around him. The teacher tries to foster 
this power by refraining from unnecessary 
interruption of anything which is engaging a 
child’s attention and by trying to hold his inter- 
est if it flags too easily, offering some new aspect 
of the subject to make it attractive. Of course 
there are some things the child must do whether 
he likes them or not—put away his toys, or do 
his share of necessary. work—of these tasks 
there will be plenty without going out of our 
way to seek them. 
ENJOYMENT IN MENTAL EXERCISE 
But if his mental powers are to be developed 
to the fulfilment of their best possibilities, he 
must learn above everything else ‘‘ the joy of

the working.’? He must find more pleasure in 
the mental exercise he gets in games requiring 
active participation, skill and quick thinking 
than in passive recreations like the movies. He 
must feel that there is no more fun in this enig- 
matie world than the delight of working out 
a problem. 
TEST EXERCISES 
1. What is your off-hand opinion of the value of 
mental tests? If possible, have your child tested and 
get an impartial estimate of his general mental abil- 
ity. Has the result altered your opinion of the value 
of mental tests? 
2. Record the ages at which your children begin 
to distinguish colors, notice sounds, recognize voices, 
play with blocks, ete. Have you any idea whether 
they are up to the average standards in sense per- 
ception? Have you any idea of the best times to 
present sense training materials? 
8. Does your child speak plainly or use baby 
talk? Note the age at which he begins to use sen- 
tences. What stories does he like best? Does he 
attempt to tell stories himself? Try to put down some 
of his stories word for word, study them thought- 
fully, and see how much they teach you of what he 
thinks about and what impresses him. Record the 
various cases of misunderstanding of what he hears 
others say. Try to understand why he failed to under-
-P-A-G-E-103
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 81 
stand. Does he make dramatic plays from stories? 
From his observation of life? 
4. What indication does your child give of posses- 
sing powers of observation? How do you attempt to 
develop these powers? Note the cases in which he 
has apparently thought for himself and formed inde- 
pendent judgments. 
5. Have you provided materials with which the 
child may exercise creative ability—paints, crayons, 
modeling clay, cut-outs, ete.? Is the child interested 
in using these materials? Has he shown pleasure in 
looking at pictureg? In listening to music? In 
nature? Are you teaching him to find beauty in 
these things? In what ways does he show imagina- 
tive power? 
6. Have the children developed an attitude to 
interest in the world’s work? Note the ages at which 
your children can bathe and dress themselves, care 
for themselves in the toilet, perform successfully vari- 
ous manual operations, such as opening and shutting 
doors, boxes, drawers, etc., managing spoons, forks, 
knives, screwing, pouring, weaving, hammering, saw- 
ing, cutting, sewing. 
7. Note the amount of time children stick to their 
various occupations. Can you safeguard them from 
too much interruption?

we are still surprised to observe the same reac- 
tions in two and three year olds. 
The types of delinquency exhibited by three 
year old children have been found to parallel 
very closely the varieties found in adult society. 
In dealing with them, an attempt has been made 
to trace the conditions that have permitted their 
development, and to provide conditions in which 
the elements that seemed chiefly responsible for 
the trouble should be corrected. 
BEHAVIOR AND EMOTIONAL STABILITY 
‘We do not know enough as yet of the nature 
of behavior problems to make any satisfactory 
classifications into types for study and discus- 
sion. It seems possible, however, to place in 
one grouping certain forms of undesirable 
behavior that arise from poor emotional con- 
trol. And since so little is known about the 
causes and nature of the mighty forces we call 
human emotions and so little is done through 
our educational systems to train or control 
them, it seems wise to consider emotional 
development. in a section by itself.
-P-A-G-E-109
   EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 87 
,FORCES OF ANGER, LOVE AND FEAR 
(The particular emotions that seem to get 
the better of us and drive us in spite of our- 
selves into unworthy conduct are anger, love, 
and fear—all mighty forces which lay hold of 
us at birth and in most of us are unsubdued till 
death. The only investigator who has made an 
extended study of the emotional reactions of 
very young children is Dr. John Watson, 
formerly Professor of Psychology in Johns 
Hopkins University. He tells us that the pri- 
mary cause of anger is being thwarted. Even 
little babies, if the movements they want to 
make are restrained, will stiffen and scream 
with rage. If they find that these manifesta- 
tions secure them freedom from interference, 
get them what they want, they will soon develop 
‘tantrum ’’—a fairly common affliction among 
children of pre-school age. The worst case in 
the nursery school was that of Katherine, who 
would oppose anything suggested to her, and if 
not instantly allowed to have her way would 
throw herself into a violent tantrum. Her 
mother explained that this unfortunate state of 
affairs was due to an illness during which she     
  
-P-A-G-E-110
    
   88 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
suffered so much pain as to develop a hysterical 
condition, so that it was felt to be dangerous to 
oppose her. Yet no one observing the slavish 
deportment of her grandfather, who brought 
her to school, could fail to conclude that he had 
been at least as harmful to her as the illness. 
Katherine was a member of the school only a 
few weeks, but her brief school history is inter- 
esting as an example of the success of Miss 
Henton’s method of dealing with tantrums. 
TREATMENT OF TANTRUMS 
The first and most difficult thing to do was 
to get rid of the grandfather. Hvery morning 
when the hour for parting arrived, Katherine 
would cling about his neck and shriek, deaf to 
his beseeching and cajoling. After a most pain- 
ful scene, distressing alike to participants and 
observers, he would be induced to hand her over 
to Miss Henton, but would stand in the doorway 
with agonized countenance, holding out his arms 
to her as she was borne away to look at the 
goldfish. Of course as long as he was in sight 
she refused to be diverted by the goldfish and
-P-A-G-E-111
EE ee ap ae RE CETTE Re Ne ESTER RCS Ce Ore eae 
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 89 
continued to wreck the peace of the school. He 
would leave the doorway only to return at a 
more piercing scream. When he finally did 
depart Katherine would throw herself on the 
floor with her eye on the door, and when she 
‘perceived that he had really left and nothing 
more could be accomplished, would suddenly 
desist from her tantrum. 
  All day she would watch for opportunities 
for resistance, and if resistance failed, would 
develop a tantrum. It seemed as if tantrums 
were the breath of life to her. Miss Henton 
adopted the simple plan of making them well 
nigh impossible by avoiding occasions for them. 
Nothing was required of Katherine, so there 
was nothing to oppose. She could play with 
whatever she preferred, she need not join the 
circle if she didn’t care to, she need not even 
eat unless she liked. She was put to it to find 
something to resist. It was funny to watch her 
standing about glowering and looking for 
trouble. If she succeeded in finding an issue 
that could not be avoided and began a tantrum, 
she was promptly removed to a room where she
-P-A-G-E-112
  90 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
could have it alone. Tantrums require an audi- 
ence and few children will indulge in one when 
there is no one to see. 
This treatment proved most successful. In 
the short time that she was at the school, the 
tantrums were practically cured. At home she 
had been surrounded by an agitated group, 
father, mother, grandfather, and aunties, all 
scolding, cajoling, threatening, all at the mercy 
of Katherine, the important centre of the group. 
Had she been left alone in a room by herself 
she would probably have recovered forthwith, 
as she certainly did at school. For violent 
. tantrums that will not yield to isolation cold 
water is sometimes effective—a cold shower or 
tub, or dash of cold water in the face. This 
should be done in a common sense way, with no 
effect of violence, as curative treatment rather 
than punishment. 
THE WISE DIRECTION OF ANGER 
(Indeed, the first great thing to realize in 
trying to tame the savage emotion of anger is 
that punishment is useless. It cannot be beaten 
out of a child. The second great thing to realize
-P-A-G-E-113
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 91 
is that\anger is a noble quality when rightly 
directed, To lose one’s temper when petty per- 
sonal projects are interfered with is weakness, 
To be capable of righteous wrath when human 
progress is interfered with is strength. The 
generous rage of individuals is often the spark 
that kindles great social reforms. Such indig- 
nation, for instance as flamed in Lincoln’s heart 
when he first saw a slave market, burned stead- 
ily until he had the chance to help extinguish 
slavery. Anger needs not checking but diverting 
to broader channels. If thwarting a child’s 
purposes stirs him to anger, the thing to attack’ 
is not the anger, but the purposes—the thing 
to accomplish is to teach him to form worthier 
purposes. When the thing he wants is in 
harmony with the laws of life then anger at 
interference becomes a legitimate and noble 
passion. Let him learn to be angry at mean- ,_ 
ness and envy and jealousy and cruelty and - 
hatred, and let him learn to ‘‘ work off ’’ his 
anger in strenuous battling against the forces 
of evil. Let him “ fight the good fight ’’ for a 
better world. 
/ A second great human emotion, which ac-

92 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
cording to the way we learn to deal with it, 
makes or mars our lives, is love. For all life 
** Ts just our chance at the prize of learning love, 
How love might be, hath been, indeed, and is.’’ 
Often and often we find children who are 
victims of unwise affection. 
THE DANGERS IN EXCESSIVE AFFECTION 
A serious—perhaps pathological—problem 
is presented by Henry, whose mother’s handling 
has brought him to a most unhappy pass. Her- 
self an emotional, ‘‘ high strung ’’ sort of 
person, she had suffered intense grief over the 
loss of a baby before Henry was born, and had 
lavished on this second child a most unwise 
and dangerous form of love—an excessive type 
of physical affection. She cuddled and kissed 
ae and petted him continually, which developed in 
him a clinging sort of dependence on such atten- 
tions. At the same time, she thoroughly spoiled 
him, so that as he grew older and more assertive 
» she found herself unable to manage him. She 
then had recourse to threats of the punishments 
his father would inflict when he came home. The 
father, a rather sensible young man, confided ~~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 93 
frankly to Doctor Woolley that he feared the 
child was being badly mismanaged. And indeed 
the effects of faulty training were plain to see. 
When Henry was first enrolled he could not be 
induced to play with any of the boys or notice 
the other children. He would attach himself 
to some adult female—teacher, student, or guest 
—and would cling to her and follow her about, 
coaxing for attention and petting. At the same 
time he displayed a marked aversion to men. 
He became quite excited when a man entered 
the school, showing plainly his dislike. One day, 
for instance, he was in the office when the secre- 
tary’s brother happened to be visiting. He 
accidentally spilled some ink on her desk and 
immediately said ‘‘ Don’t tell the man.’’? Day 
after day he would say, ‘‘ My daddy won’t come 
for me today,’’ in spite of the fact that his father 
had never failed to come. Sometimes he would 
say over and over ‘‘ My daddy’s dead! My 
daddy’s dead!’’ Several times he remarked 
that he wanted to wear dresses and be a little 
girl. When the children played wedding he 
insisted on being a bride and was exasperated. 
when the piece of lace curtain that was used for 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  94 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
a veil refused to stay fastened to his cropped 
hair. He is difficult to control and works himself 
up into an emotional state of irritation or rebel- 
lion for no apparent reason. Removal for a few 
hours every day from the highly charged atmos- 
phere of his mother, persistent stimulating of 
normal occupational interests, and steady dis- 
couragement of his abnormal craving for atten- 
tion and petting have produced a noticeable 
improvement in Henry. He has learned to work 
and play with enjoyment, and is on the whole 
somewhat easier to manage. But he is often 
overtaken by his inexpli and apparently 
abnormal attacks of bad befvior, and it seems 
rather doubtful whether the deep and unfortu- 
nate efforts of injudicious early training can 
ever be quite erased from his personality. 
HOW TO DEAL WITH JEALOUSY 
Another trouble arising from ‘‘ inordinate 
and sinful affections ’’ is jealousy. The com- 
monest form with little children is jealousy of 
the new baby that absorbs the mother’s atten- 
tion. One nineteen-months old girl, witness- 
ing in silent despair the delight of the whole 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 95 
family over the baby’s bath, suddenly demanded 
the baby’s toe, saying ‘‘ I want to kiss it,’’ and 
when it was held out to her, bit it savagely with 
her four little teeth. Y Jealousy, though so human 
and universal, always means suffering, and too 
often leads to unworthy conduct. It should be 
patiently worked with by making the victim feel 
that he also is loved, and teaching him to love 
more worthily. Families sometimes fail to 
realize how hard it is for the child who has been 
the petted baby to be suddenly thrust aside, and 
how much suffering can be saved by making the 
transition less abrupt and complete by a little 
judicious petting of the unfortunate ex-baby. 
More rarely, but still too often, we find 
children who are suffering from too little affec- 
tion. A sense of being unloved is quite disas- 
trous to a child’s disposition, making him either 
hard and insensitive, or shrinking and unhappy. 
Such children are usually institutional or step 
children, but once in a while they have parents 
of their own whom Puritan tradition or too 
rigorous ideals of discipline have made mar- 
tinets. A particularly vicious combination of 
too much and too little love is displayed in the
-P-A-G-E-118
  
  96 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
attitude of the society woman who pets her 
children outrageously in the brief time she is 
with them and leaves them for long intervals to 
the neglect of indifferent servants. 
THE AVOIDANCE AND CONTROL OF FEAR 
Of all the emotional dragons that beset our 
painful mortal progress the most wretched and 
unworthy is the demon of fear. We are born 
into this life, Doctor Watson tells us, afraid of 
only two things—loud noises and removal of 
support. New born babies, he has demon- 
strated, will register fear at sudden sharp noises 
or at being dropped a very little way into a 
suspended blanket. Nothing else alarms us 
until our cruel experience teaches us how many 
things there are to fear. The more we can be 
guarded from fear, the better for us and for our 
work. It is a grave mistake to use fear as an 
“aid to discipline. It always does harm, often 
permanent harm. Too many of us suffer physi- 
cally and mentally as a result of childhood fears. 
The thing many parents fail to realize is that 
the effects of fear are so lasting, so out of pro- 
portion to the original frightening incident.
-P-A-G-E-119
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 97 
One child had a panicky dread of band music 
which tormented the first five or six years of her 
life. Whenever she heard the beat of a drum, 
her heart stood still, and a hideous picture 
flashed into her mind of pawing hoofs in her 
face as she sat in a baby buggy. This picture 
she did not recognize as a memory until many 
enlightening years had passed. Her conscious 
memory did not reach back to her baby buggy 
days. The ghastly picture simply appeared as 
an unreasoning accompaniment to the band. 
Later she realized that it was a definite memory, 
made vivid by its alarming character, of a time 
when her nurse had pushed the buggy close to 
the curb to see a parade, and the sudden clamor 
of horn and drum had frightened a horse from 
whose prancing hoofs she had been pulled back 
just in time. Her mother, knowing nothing of 
the incident, could not understand the fear, and 
was particularly puzzled by the way the child 
refused her comfort—would become frantic if 
held, and tear herself from the protecting arms 
to dash into the nursery and precipitate herself 
over the railing of her little bed. This sense of 
the futility of mother’s aid may have been due 
7
-P-A-G-E-120
~~ Sg e  s O asccne A S G  e 
98 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
to mother’s absence at the time of the original 
terror. Gradually as her love of music grew, 
the obsession disappeared, though the joyous 
thrill of martial music always held for her a 
touch of fear. 
A CASE OF PHOBIA : 
In the nursery school every effort is made 
to overcome these childish fears. One interest- 
ing case of phobia has appeared in a three year 
old child. Irene was discovered one day at the. 
top of the short flight of stairs leading from the 
sleeping room to the playroom, crying and 
trembling because she was afraid to come down. 
She was afraid, she said, to pass two of the rail- 
ings. The teachers were entirely at a loss to 
account for this manifestation, as the two 
pointed out were, so far as anyone could see, 
exactly like all the other railings, and the only 
reason she could give for the terror they 
inspired was that ‘‘ there was no curtain.’’ 
Every effort was made to conquer the unreason- 
able fear. Irene was assured that there was 
nothing about the railings to be afraid of, that 
they were ‘‘ nice railings ’’ placed there for
-P-A-G-E-121
   EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 99 
her protection. She was even induced to touch 
them. But she did this shrinking and trembling 
in very obvious terror and distress. She com- 
plicated the problem still further by protesting 
that she did not mind going up stairs at all. It 
was only when coming down that she feared the 
two railings. For weeks she suffered until at 
last Miss Henton yielded to the obsession and 
hung a rug over the dread objects. Doctor 
Woalley meanwhile kept seeking for a cause in 
' some repressed fright or worry. The most nota- 
ble event in Irene’s family life had been the 
recent arrival of a baby sister. Irene, however, 
her mother said, had showed no strong feeling 
of any kind about the baby—had indeed almost 
never talked about her. This in itself was sur- 
prising enough to be suspicious, particularly in 
conjunction with the fact that she had talked at 
school about the baby’s arrival, and had 
repeated several times in a puzzled, strained 
way :‘‘ When she went to the hospital she didn’t 
have the baby, and when she came back from the 
hospital she did have the baby.’’ She had not 
been prepared in any way for the baby’s com- 
ing, nor had she asked any questions as to where 
LIBRARY MIDDLE TENS   
  
-P-A-G-E-122
  100 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
it came from. This again suggested repression. 
Further questioning revealed that she had 
several times been taken to see her mother at 
the hospital; that she had always gone up in 
the elevator but had usually walked down the 
one flight, as there was a small stairway near 
her mother’s room; that this stairway was 
almost exactly like the one at the school. At 
this point it seemed fairly clear that she had 
experienced some shock—that whatever had 
oceurred or had been said was beyond her com- 
prehension, but that she had brooded on it in 
secret so that when she found herself in a 
similar situation to that in which it arose, the 
repressed trouble appeared as a phobia. Doctor 
Woolley advised her mother to talk to her about 
the baby, giving her an opportunity to ask 
questions and release her pent up feelings, and 
to tell her what she could understand. This was 
done and the fear completely disappeared. 
“ PERFECT LOVE CASTETH OUT FEAR” 
Love, we are wisely told, is always the thing 
that casts out fear. Many a child has overcome 
the fear of dogs or cats by learning to love and
-P-A-G-E-123
  - EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 101 
‘ eare for a pet. Fear of the awful dark may be 
avoided by teaching love of the soft, quiet, com- 
fortable dark. One two year old who had been 
so trained was put into a dark closet by way of 
punishment. When released, she looked calmly 
at the misguided auntie who had hoped thus to 
quell her, and commanded ‘‘ Put Betty back. 
Betty love ’a da’ak! ’? We cannot fear the thing 
we love. 
HOW TO TREAT THE EARLY SEX INTEREST 
Most children have begun by the third or 
fourth year to be normally conscious of them- 
selves as little boys or little girls, normally 
interested in the differences between little boys 
and little girls, normally curious as to where 
little boys and little girls come from. This 
fundamental consciousness, interest, and curi- 
osity needs wise direction, lest it develop into 
an unwholesome emotional attitude toward the 
basic aspects of life, or express itself in undesir- 
able habits. Such habits, when they do appear, 
should of course be checked in a common sense 
way, without undue emphasis or alarm. The 
popular belief that they are the causes of
-P-A-G-E-124
102 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
ghastly mental deterioration is without founda- 
tion. Much more harm is caused by investing 
the habit with an atmosphere of horror and 
humiliation than by the habit itself. 
Though we are painfully acquiring a more 
matter of fact way of meeting this problem a 
surprising number of young mothers have still 
to be assured that discovery of a child’s unde- 
sirable practice is not ground for despair. The 
| questions children ask about sex should be fully 
and truthfully answered. An atmosphere of 
secrecy or embarrassment—even an, over elabo- 
rate modesty—should be avoided. Repression 
of this as of any normal interest is likely to 
result in the development of an unfortunate 
emotional attitude. 
THE CONTROL OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION 
We know unfortunately very little about con- 
trolling emotional development. Some authori- 
ties declare that it cannot be done. What we 
usually do, and to a certain extent are forced to 
do, is to control the expression of emotion. 
When children find that unrestrained yielding 
to jealousy or anger is followed by unpleasant 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 103 
consequences, they learn to control the expres- 
sion of these feelings. Emotions, however, are 
mighty forces, which cannot be bottled up with- 
out danger. _Children-whose natural emotional 
expression is u is s unduly. ch by rere 
“tis far better to work by such methods as are 
described above. It is well, whenever possible, 
to change the attitude of mind produced by the 
situation that has caused an undesirable emo- 
tional state. When Junior, for instance, regis- 
ters fury at little sister for taking his cookie, his 
attitude may be changed by pointing out how 
smart it was of the baby to snatch it when his 
back was turned, and how funny she looked try- 
ing to cram it all into her mouth at once. Our 
feelings toward a situation may be completely 
changed by suddenly seeing it from another 
angle. It is sometimes best to divert the child 
until the emotion passes. And it is always best 
to insist that no matter how excited—how 
‘‘keyed up ’’ one may feel, he has no right to 
communicate to others anything but pleasant- 
ness, no right to ‘‘ spoil the atmosphere ’’ by 
publishing his personal irritation or depression
-P-A-G-E-126
  104 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
or craving for attention. Mary, at two, objected 
so definitely to anything but peace and pleasant- 
ness that when she fell and hurt herself, instead 
of rushing to mother for sympathy, she would 
say bracingly ‘‘ Ne’mind, baby,’’ and go about 
her play. Dorothy, also two, was discovered 
kissing her own bumped knee, rather than 
intrude on mother’s tea party with a tale of 
woe. And the warning against disagreeableness 
in the section on physical development should 
be repeated here. No grown up quarreling or 
melancholy should be permitted to infect the 
children’s atmosphere. Such poisons ruin dis- 
positions as well as constitutions. 
/ MAINTENANCE OF A PLEASANT 
f EMOTIONAL TONE 
The maintaining of a cheerful atmosphere, 
an unflinchingly pleasant emotional tone, should 
be made a very definite responsibility of every 
human being from earliest childhood. 
TEST EXERCISES 
1. Watch for any evidence of emotional instability 
in the children. Do they seem nervous, excitable, high 
strung? Can you find anything in the home atmos- 
phere which tends to overstimulate their emotions?
-P-A-G-E-127
  EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 105 
2. Study any manifestations of anger that occur. 
What caused them? Have you found any effective 
method of helping a child gain control over his temper? 
3. Observe the attitude of children toward affec- 
tion. Do they respond to the affection of adults? 
Do they endure, or avoid, or seck caresses? Are they 
unduly dependent on others emotionally? Note any 
display of jealousy. Do the children show marked 
attachments for special individuals within or outside 
of the family? Do they ‘‘ take dislikes’? Can 
you account for differences in these respects in the 
same family? 
4. Are the children fearless in their general atti- 
tude? Note any special objects of fear. Can you 
discover how these fears started? To what extent 
have you succeeded in getting them to conquer these 
fears? By what method?

PSALMS, xxxvii, 10. 
STANDARDS OF CONDUCT FROM 
GROUP CONTACT 
Grantine that the child develops his stand- 
ards of conduct out of contacts with his group, 
it seems to follow that he should begin early to 
spend at least part of his time in a group of his 
peers, whose purposes, abilities, and limitations 
are similar to his own, rather than all of his 
time in the family group, with its varying ages 
and interests. The most conservative observer 
must admit that in opportunities for social 
training the home falls far short of the play- 
room of the nursery school. It is here that the 
children show their individual characteristics, 
the particular powers and weaknesses that must 
be reckoned with. It is in the playroom that 
Harold, the most perfect physical specimen in 
the school, displays the tendencies to boss and 
bully which will mean trouble later if not

checked now. With a budding consciousness of 
his overpowering personality, he struts regally 
to the cupboard, points out what he wants to 
play with, drags two or three unwilling slaves 
to his assistance and embarks on a project which 
is pleasure for him and toil and trouble for 
them. It is in the playroom that the unsocial 
nature of little John reveals itself. For John 
prefers to do everything entirely by himself, 
and is as nearly irritated as is possible to his 
even disposition by attempts to join in his play 
or interfere with his work. It is in the play- 
room that Eva’s unfortunate inclination for 
‘“* crushes ’’ becomes evident, as she jealously 
guards the intimate of the moment from the 
advances of other children. It is in the play- 
room that gentle little Jewish Rachael learns 
some of her first lessons in Christian civiliza- 
tion. One day she had placed her doll in a little 
cart, and was pulling it slowly along with a 
beatific backward smile, when Bobby, the bold 
and bad, fell down. Picking himself up with a 
muttered ‘‘ I fell down, damn it! ’’ and glancing 
irately about for something on which to vent his 
wrath, he observed Rachael’s enjoyment of her 
doll’s outing. Stamping across the room, he
-P-A-G-E-133
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT lll 
growled, ‘‘ Det dat doll out o’ dere! ’’ and, hurl- 
ing the doll on the floor, made off with the wagon. 
Rachael remained motionless until he had got 
quite a distance away. Finally she stooped, 
picked up her doll and kissed it, and carrying it 
into a corner, tenderly rearranged its dis- 
ordered attire. Then she looked over her 
shoulder at Bobby, a long, reproachful, puzzled 
look that seemed to wonder at the unaccount- 
able cruelties of life as expressed through 
little boys. 
REPRESSION OF THE TOO DOMINANT 
PERSONALITY 
Itis hard for the individual to learn to adjust 
himself to the group, and many kinds of undesir- 
able behavior arise from poor adjustment. 
Annie, for instance, had been so spoiled that 
when she entered the school she did not know 
how to occupy any position but the centre of the 
stage. Her peculiarly loud, harsh, voice was 
always heard above the others, demanding, ex- 
acting, ordering, ‘‘ Let me do it.’’ ‘‘ J want to 
carry the tray.’’ “‘ Z’ll show you how to play it.’’ 
Her chubby little figure was always dancing in 
the foreground, the butterfly bow in her dark  
-P-A-G-E-134
  112 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
curls bobbing gaily in amusing contrast to the 
serious and strenuous expression of her fat little 
round face. One day when the children were 
playing outdoors, Annie was observed in tears. 
A group of children had set up housekeeping in 
one of the large packing boxes provided for their 
games, and Annie ardently desired to join them, 
but they did not want her. Miss Henton, mark- 
ing her grief, came over and inquired the cause. 
“‘We don’t want her,’’ explained Virginia 
earnestly. ‘‘ We have a father and a mother and 
two children and we don’t want her.’’ Miss 
Henton, instead of urging that poor Annie be 
included, attacked the situation from the right 
angle at once. ‘‘ Come away, Annie,’’ she said 
in a sensible, matter of fact tone, ‘‘ let us find 
some other pleasant thing to do. Their party is 
made up.’’ In a moment Annie had called to 
Tommy and Bessie, ‘‘ Come on, let’s slide,’? 
and a gay little group collected about the slides. 
Miss Henton’s substitution of an independent 
activity for Annie’s attempt to force herself 
into a group where she was not wanted was 
much appreciated by a group of visitors, one of 
whom commented, ‘‘ She might as well learn as
-P-A-G-E-135
  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ' 118 
soon as possible that in this life some parties 
are made up.’? By a series of such gentle 
repressions Annie has been led to modify her 
too insistent ego so that she now no longer 
stands out from the group on every occasion, 
and thrusts her personality on the general 
attention. 
“AIRS” 
Another hopeful achievement of the school 
is the waking up of supercilious Donald to his 
own unpopularity. He would never descend to 
play with the others on equal terms, but stood 
apart regarding them with an air of superior 
aloofness almost incredible in a three year old. 
One day it suddenly struck him that the children 
did not like him. He frankly asked of one child 
after another ‘‘ Do you like me? ’’ receiving 
always the answer ‘‘ No.’? The next day his 
mother reported that Donald had the oddest 
impression that the other children didn’t like 
him. Of course she knew it couldn’t be true, 
but wasn’t it unfortunate he should get such an 
idea? It had obviously never occurred to her 
to take it seriously, to seek for a cause, to seek 
8
-P-A-G-E-136
  114 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
for it at home, to plan a reconstructive program. 
So far the general attitude of dislike is 
' unaltered. Billy, marching about as a soldier, 
levels the little stick which is his gun, at one 
child after another but always relents at the 
plea ‘‘ Don’t shoot me ”’ because of a fondness 
for the intended victim. What good is a gun if 
there is no one you would enjoy shooting? At 
last Philip finds a solution. ‘‘ I’ll tell you who 
to shoot,’’ he shouts, ‘‘ Shoot Donald.’’ There 
is a chorus of ‘‘ Yes, shoot Donald,’’ and Donald 
is massacred amid general satisfaction. It is 
something gained that Donald is aware of the 
feeling he inspires. Perhaps his mother can 
be enlightened, too, and can be made to realize 
that superior conceited airs are as unpopular at 
three as at thirty, and the atmosphere which 
breeds them is an undesirable environment for 
a little child to live in. 
CONQUERING SELFISHNESS WITH 
THE SENSE OF FAIRNESS 
Selfishness is a very common fault, particu- 
larly in the only little one at home or the petted 
baby of the family. Where no one else is inter- 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 115 
ested in the toys suitable to his age the child 
soon gets to feel that he has the right to monop- 
oly. Taking turns at the swings and teeters, 
waiting until some one else is through with the 
tricycle, enjoying some one else’s pleasure in 
dressing the doll—all these disciplines that 
come naturally in a group of like interests help 
a child to get into right relations with his 
neighbors. Fairness is perhaps a better ideal. 
than sacrifice. It is a wise mother who divides 
the scanty supply of ice-cream evenly instead 
of doing without any herself. Some children 
when they enter the nursery school have no 
compunction about snatching what they want 
even out of the hands of others. Little George 
could hardly be pried from the Noah’s Ark, 
which so delighted him that he waked his whole 
family at six o’clock on two successive mornings 
to tell them of its glories. When he went out to 
play he would laboriously mount a chair to place 
it on a shelf, muttering as he cautiously pushed 
it well back. ‘‘ So the other kids can’t get it.’’ 
This sort of attitude at this early age soon yields 
to a very real pleasure in the pleasure of others 
if the conditions are kept equally fair for all. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  116 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
CONTRARINESS 
Joan was contrary. Her first reaction to 
every situation was ‘‘ won’t.’’? She could not be 
tested because it was impossible to get her to 
perform the little tasks. When she entered the 
school she was thoroughly antagonistic to every- 
thing and everybody, and stood about with a 
dark scowl on her pretty little face, looking for 
something to oppose. Her father is one of those / 
only sons who have been so spoiled that there 
is almost no living with them. His mother’s 
unwise indulgence has developed in him an 
undisciplined attitude toward life which makes 
him a failure in everything he undertakes, along 
with an overweening conceit which keeps him 
from seeing himself as the cause of the failure. 
Herself an educated woman, she has permitted 
him to grow up without proper schooling and 
with no training for any kind of work. His 
wife, a stenographer, really supports the family, 
while he gives up one job after another. On one 
oceasion he sold all the furniture to get money 
for a new start in another city, but was back in 
ten days with no money and no work. The whole 
atmosphere of the home is charged with unpleas-
-P-A-G-E-139
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 117 
antness, which the little girl had quite naturally 
absorbed. But instead of trying to improve the 
atmosphere, the father’s idea of treatment is to 
beat it out of the child. One morning when she 
was getting ready for school her mother under- 
took to sew a button on her underwear. Her 
father came up where she stood and asked her 
to kiss him goodbye. She refused in her usual 
contrary way, and he seized her forthwith and 
beat her severely. When her mother got her 
back she discovered that only half of the needle 
she had been using was to be found. She took 
Joan to the hospital, and, as she had feared, the 
X-rays revealed the needle embedded in the 
child’s flesh. Of course it had to be removed. 
The father rushed frantically to the hospital 
and there protested his grief and his devotion 
to the child. But the doctor’s cold suggestion 
that he express this devotion by paying the 
hospital bills failed to take effect. 
In the atmosphere of the school Joan’s con- 
trariness melted at once in the entire absence of / 
any attempt to force her to do anything. If she 
wished to play this or that, well and good. If 
not, there was no attempt to force her. After 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  118 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
two or three days of this treatment, in an atmos- 
phere of gentleness and affection, she became 
as sweet and tractable a child as one could wish 
to see. 
STIMULATING INDIVIDUALITY 
AND INITIATIVE 
Some children, instead of unduly thrusting 
forward their own personalities so as to appear 
domineering, conceited, contrary, or selfish, 
tend to become absorbed in the group to the 
detriment of their own individuality and initia- 
tive. Bessie, a very intelligent sensitive child, 
holds her dainty little personality like a cup to 
receive the wine of life poured into it by others. 
She is imitative to a fault, copying not only what 
the other children do, but what they say, as 
exactly as possible. She is, of course, very 
popular, as she is pretty, sunny and courteous, 
and aims to please. Though she can handle all 
the play materials easily and well, she never 
seems to choose any activity for itself, but enters 
into whatever the others are doing. This is 
a dangerous characteristic, the more so because 
the child possessing it is so easy to live with— 
fits like a glove into the other personalities in
-P-A-G-E-141
SES ree gm feo eRe CEC Agta Ne rat hoe Cee 
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 119 
the family. At the school Bessie is steadily 
urged to make choices of her own and stimulated 
to take interest in the game rather than in the 
other children who are playing. This treatment, 
wisely persisted in, ought to free her from too 
much dependence on other personalities and 
help her to find and hold her own place worthily. 
THE CAUSE AND CURE OF SHYNESS 
/ Many little children are made miserable by 
extreme shyness, which is usually the result of 
being too constantly alone with their mothers, 
or of seeing too few people outside the family. 
* The varied society of the nursery school has 
never failed to cure this distressing handicap. 
If mothers would make a point of occasionally 
leaving children in charge of others and bring- 
ing company into the home more frequently, 
children would not develop this agonizing shy- 
ness, which too often persists into maturity and 
robs human intercourse of half its pleasure. 
THE HANDLING OF THE UNSOCIAL CHILD 
Another less common way of withdrawing 
from the group, harder to understand and deal 
with, is the unsocial attitude of the child wha  
-P-A-G-E-142
  120 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
appears averse to joining the group because 
he is sufficient unto himself rather than shy. 
The nursery school experience seems to indi- 
eate that this trait is found only in superior 
children—children who can do things better 
than the others and would rather play alone than 
be annoyed by the stupidity of their neighbors. 
It requires extremely careful handling. David 
at first preferred to do everything by himself, 
and made it very plain that he did not welcome 
interference or companionship. Sunny and 
docile when left to himself, he would register 
surprising resentment at intrusion into his per- 
sonal affairs. Once, when little Jane threw 
stones into his sand house, he was incensed to 
the point of striking her. No attempt was made 
to force him to join the group or take any one 
else into his own projects. After a few weeks 
he began to single out Harold and Philip for 
attention. His interest in these particular 
children was undoubtedly aroused by admira- 
tion of their powers, for both are big, handsome 
boys. Having begun in this way, however, 
David went on to notice other children and to 
like them. ‘‘ I’m glad you’re sitting here,’’ he

SERVING DINNER
-P-A-G-E-144

-P-A-G-E-145
See ane Enns Cane rere te

was heard to remark to his neighbor at table, 
‘«T like you.”” He has several times displayed 
sympathy with others. When Warren fell down 
inconveniently in front of Annie’s wagon and 
Annie began to pound him forthwith, David 
listened attentively to the moral remarks of the 
student in charge, who pointed out that helping 
Warren up would have been more to the purpose 
and when Warren accommodatingly fell again, | 
David got off his tricycle to come to the rescue. 
He has been seen to help little Henry upstairs, 
kissing him three times on the way, and to 
return the doll he had snatched from Betty, 
kissing her ardently and telling her not to ery. 
These unsocial superior children should not be 
forced into the group, but every effort should be 
made to find them friends who can give them 
real companionship as well as what points of 
congeniality with the general group are possible. 
It is well for them to have resources within 
themselves, well for them that they do not wish 
to dominate or attract attention, but they must 
learn that they cannot realize themselves at all 
without including others. Often the natures that 
are unable to be ‘‘ good mixers,’’ that are un- 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
122 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
happy trying to be “‘ one of the bunch,’’ have 
valuable contributions to make. They should 
not be embittered or discouraged by having 
their differences regarded as a disadvantage 
but should be given as much companionship as 
they desire and as much letting alone. Families 
are too prone to punish by an unfriendly atti- 
tude the member who doesn’t always want to 
join the family project—a most unfair use of 
group power. 
CAUSES OF SUSPICION IN CHILDREN 
Another unfortunate type of failure to 
adjust properly to the group is the attitude of 
suspiciousness. This unhappy quality, not often 
found in early childhood, is of course, the result 
of being evaded or tricked. Billy, not yet three, 
surprised his mother by asking where babies 
come from. Feeling unprepared to answer 
wisely, she put him off with the traditional 
response that they came from Heaven. Fixing 
her with a gaze of darkest suspicion, he retorted 
ironically, ‘‘ You said you’d never been there! ”’ 
Betty, armed to withstand the ‘‘joshing ”’ of 
some lively young uncles, was proof against the
-P-A-G-E-147
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 123 
doctor, when in answer to her inquiry, he 
gravely explained to her the magical properties 
of the sterilizer. With hand on hip, and crushing 
glance over her shoulder, she put him in his 
place with the bored rejoinder, ‘‘ Ah, g’wan.”’ 
Children who are put on guard against being 
cheated often carry into adult life a shrewd 
suspiciousness that jaundices their relations 
with others and takes much of the joy out of 
home and vocation. 
The same principle of reaction to environ- 
ment holds true of the graver faults. Lying is 
much more often a matter of insincerity in the 
atmosphere than in the natural disposition. 
CAUSE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR LYING 
Children may lie because they are afraid, or 
romancing, or to get some fancied advantage, 
but the usual reason they lie is because they are 
lied to. Parents who wouldn’t go so far as to 
say there isn’t any candy and risk the child’s 
discovering that there is, will sneak out of the 
house to avoid the row at parting, or will inform 
the company that the extra special feast is 
‘* just a plain home dinner, such as we have
-P-A-G-E-148
Te 
124 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
every night.’’ Children soon ‘‘ get on to ’’ this 
sort of thing. Keeping one attitude or set of 
manners for the home and another for the out- 
side world is sure to breed insincerity. Hven 
politeness may be a dangerous thing to teach 
“if it is made too artificial. Diplomacy begets 
diplomacy. Dorothy not yet three, who had been 
‘“‘managed ’’ somewhat overtactfully to induce 
her to let another child hold her doll, considered 
a moment and then, holding out her empty arms 
with an ingratiatingly brilliant smile, inquired 
“ Isn’t s’e too heavy for 00? ’’ 
Children should never be accused of lying 
‘unless it is positively proved. The day the 
nursery school children were taken to the island 
park, George’s parents through some over- 
sight, had not been informed of the projected 
trip. George went home with glowing accounts 
of his adventures. Rapturously he told his 
mother what a fine time he had seeing the ani- 
mals and riding on the elephant—and was 
spanked forthwith for lying. When his father 
came home he stuck to his story and was 
spanked again. Charlotte was much more 
wisely treated when she feigned illness to get
-P-A-G-E-149
  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 125 
out of going to school. She was given a dose 
of castor oil and put to bed with tender concern. 
She did not repeat the experience. 
A CASE OF STEALING 
Only one case of actual stealing—appropri- 
ating the property of others with understanding 
and intention—has been observed so far in the 
nursery school. Jimmy at four was a very 
competent little thief. Inquiry into the sins of 
his fathers revealed first that his parents lived 
in a constant atmosphere of quarrels and fights, 
even going so far as to throw the furniture 
about, if Jimmy’s reports were not character- 
istically embellished. The root of their discord 
was poverty—apparently owing to the inability 
of the father to get any work he could do and 
the inability of the mother to do any work she 
could get. She was a flighty, hysterical young 
woman, who had had some training in a normal 
school and a little ineffectual experience in 
minor office work, and was allowed to remain to 
assist about the domestic work at the school, 
after proving herself incompetent in the office. 
Even here she was in a state of continual con- 
flict with the colored cook, the students, the
-P-A-G-E-150
  ‘ 
126 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
teachers, always superior and abused and weep- 
ing over the way she was treated. The second 
significant element in Jimmy’s history was the 
cross grandmother who had had unwilling 
charge of him and his little brother Bertie while 
the parents were trving to find or keep jobs. 
She was an excessively unpleasant old lady 
whose only interest in life was a bitter struggle, 
to keep the house neat—a losing battle, of 
course, wih two small boys about. She would 
not let tliem play with even the few poor toys 
they had, and scolded or beat them if they 
““mussed up ’”’ the premises. A study of the 
whole situation seemed to lead to the conclusion 
that Jimmy had simply figured out that any- 
thing he ever got had to be snatched when he 
could get it. He might be caught and punished 
or he might lie out of a scrape. The only way 
to have anything for himself was to take a 
chance. Now if this diagnosis was correct the 
way to break the unhappy spell was to make 
him feel that he could have what he wanted with- 
out stealing or lying, and that he need not fear 
punishment. Here are some examples of this 
treatment and its results. 
One of the students on duty in the cloak room
-P-A-G-E-151
Bae Ree ST en nenre em eT eye erent Sheena 
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 127 
happened to see Jimmy take Alice’s little 
pocketbook out of her cupboard and put it in 
his own cupboard under his hat. She reported 
the felony to Miss Henton, who after some con- 
sideration finally led Jimmy to his cupboard 
and showed him the pocketbook. ‘‘ Do you know 
how this came here, Jimmy? ’’ she inquired. 
“‘No,’’ he muttered, with a furtive, frightened 
look. ‘*‘ Do you know to whom it belongs? ’’ 
she persisted. ‘‘ No,’? he repeated with a 
driven, hunted manner. ‘‘ Well,’’ she responded 
calmly, still holding his hand, ‘‘ I know whose 
it is. It is Alice’s. Would you like to take it 
and put it in Alice’s locker? ’’ Jimmy’s face 
cleared at once. He ran to replace the pocket- 
book. ‘‘ For the first time since he entered the 
school,’? says Miss Henton, ‘‘he gave me a 
really childlike smile. I don’t believe he had 
ever before been helped out of a delinquency, 
ever been given an opportunity to perform a 
constructive act of restitution.’’ 
For some time he ‘‘ kept his hands from 
picking and stealing.’’? Then one day there was 
a party and each child was given a tiny bag of 
hard candies, one to be eaten at once, the rest 
to be taken home. The bags were left in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
128 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
children’s cupboards while they took their naps. 
Before any one else was awake, Jimmy sneaked 
downstairs and took five or six bags, hiding 
them in his own cupboard under his hat. Of 
course the bags were missed when it was time 
to go home, and a great wailing arose. Miss 
Henton felt certain of Jimmy’s guilt but by this 
time had discovered that if asked whether he 
had taken anything he invariably answered 
‘* No,’’ and if asked who had done it, as invari- 
ably replied ‘‘ Bertie,’’ his little brother. So 
she merely said ‘‘ Jimmy, show me the cup- 
boards you took the bags from.’? He immedi- 
ately trotted to the right cupboards and restored. 
the bags. Then Miss Henton said ‘‘ Jimmy, 
when you want candy, come and ask me for it, 
and if I have it I will give it to you. We don’t 
want to keep you from having nice things or 
to take things away from you. We like to give 
you nice things. But you mustn’t take things 
that belong to other people. Come and ask me 
for what you want and I’ll be glad to give it to 
you if I can.’’? Jimmy seemed both impressed 
and relieved. He showed that he had under- 
stood by coming, in a short time, to Miss Henton 
and saying ‘‘I want some candy.’’ She im-
-P-A-G-E-153
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 129 
mediately gave him a piece. Later he returned, 
repeating the demand. Again she made good, 
giving him several pieces and inducing him to 
share them with the others lest he eat too much. 
In this way she did succeed in appreciably 
lessening Jimmy’s temptation to snatch what 
he wanted by building up a confidence that he 
could have what was right and reasonable for 
the asking. Of course this was a process requir- 
ing patience and more time than the brief period 
during which he was a member of the school. 
The marked and steady improvement through- 
out this period seems proof, however, of the 
wisdom of the treatment. 
DEVELOPING AN EARLY RESPECT FOR 
PROPERTY RIGHTS 
A feeling for ownership—a respect for 
property rights, if developed in very early 
childhood, may usually be trusted to persist 
through life. Doctor Woolley reports that her 
babies, when less than a year old, would stretch 
out their hands for things with a little sound 
of inquiry, and if she said ‘‘ No, that is mine,’’ 
would draw back, but at the words ‘‘ Yes, that 
is yours,’’ would seize the desired plaything.

“MINE AND THINE” 
In too many homes there is no rigid division 
of property so that children have no sense of 
mine and thine. Handkerchiefs, stockings, toys, 
are regarded as common property and borrowed 
without formality. Children who grow up in 
this kind of atmosphere are not likely to be too 
scrupulous later if confronted with temptation. 
CRUELTY NO CURE FOR CRUELTY 
Another very dangerous tendency is the 
impulse to cruelty. Children sometimes seem 
to take a positive pleasure in inflicting pain. 
Of course they have at first no real conception 
of what pain means. Harry pushed Josephine 
so that she fell downstairs and then laughed 
elfishly at her and at the bump on her forehead. 
Two desperadoes attacked the rabbits, and hurt 
one so that it had to be chloroformed. The 
problem in cases of this kind is to make the child 
want to be gentle, and this cannot be accom- 
plished by treating him ungently. Severity is 
certainly in order for the treatment of so seri- 
ous a fault, but not the retaliative infliction of 
physical pain. The type of severity should 
depend on the circumstances and on how deeply

the child seems to be impressed. Often, if he 
has not been made insensitive by rough treat- 
ment, he is quite sufficiently disciplined by the 
disapproving or distressed attitude of those he 
loves, and will grieve most wholesomely until 
favor is restored. Isolation is a severe and 
perfectly logical punishment for violent behay- 
ior. It is not wise to put a child to bed in the 
day time, but it is often wise to keep him fora 
brief time in a room by himself, ‘‘ to think it 
over,’ and it is sometimes very wise, though 
it takes fortitude, to keep him home (under su- 
pervision) from the anticipated party or picnic.   PREVENTION, NOT PUNISHMENT 
Cases in which definite and encouraging 
progress has been made in checking undesirable 
tendencies could be indefinitely multiplied. It 
seems fair to assume that the scientific method 
used by the school is more effective than the 
usual off-hand punishment, blame or praise. 
This method in so far as it can be reduced to 
a definite formulation, might be expressed in 
some such rules as these: (1) Look for the cause 
of the trouble. Seek it in the action of the
-P-A-G-E-156
  132 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
environment on the individual. Proceed in 
scientific fashion with attention to physical con- 
dition, inherited traits, nutritive history and 
results of intelligence tests in their bearing on 
conduct. (2) Try to modify the environment, so 
as to minimize the tendency to produce undesir- 
able types of reaction. Keep experimenting and 
measuring results. Reéducate according to a 
definite program. Be content with gradual 
improvement. (3) Enlist the active codperation 
of the individual by substituting desirable ac- 
tivities for those to be corrected. 
The ways by which we grow in grace—the 
forces that may be used to overcome our defects 
are three—instruction, experience and example, 
and the greatest of these is example. Some 
preaching we must do, and a little of it may be 
effective. ‘‘ This is right,’’ ‘‘ That is wrong,’’ 
we tell our children, and possibly sometimes 
they heed us and save themselves some pains. 
The older they grow and the more confidence 
they develop in our judgment the more effective 
this kind of teaching is, particularly when they 
have learned to want it—to question us ‘‘ Is 
this right? ’’ ‘‘ Is that wrong? ’’ But this they 
learn only as a result of experience and example.  
-P-A-G-E-157
  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 133 
THE EDUCATIVE VALUE OF EXPERIENCE 
We should keep trying, then, to give them an 
educative experience. This means, for one 
thing, what we call logical punishment, letting 
the consequences fall relentlessly on the sinner. 
(The hard thing for us to do is to endure the 
suffering our children bring upon themselves, 
though we guiltily admit what they need in these 
indulgent days is discipline. We ought for their 
sakes to nerve ourselves to refrain from inter- 
vening to save them from consequences. When 
careless Charlotte lost her pretty new hat, her 
mother said ‘‘ It is too bad, dear, but we can’t 
afford another,’’ and Charlotte wore an old 
cast off one all winter long—unhappy to be sure, 
but not resentful. How much better to let 
experience teach its lesson than to scold or 
punish her and then buy another hat. When 
Bessie demanded a spoonful of lard because it 
was so pretty and white ‘‘ just like ice-cream,”’ 
her mother explained that it did not taste good 
and she would not like it. When Bessie whin- 
ingly persisted, her mother simply said, ‘‘ Very 
well,’’ and allowed the child to take a heaping 
spoonful of the nauseating stuff, knowing of 
course that it could not really hurt her.  
-P-A-G-E-158
    134 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
THE FORCE OF EXAMPLE 
More powerful than either preaching or 
experience is the almost irresistible force of 
example. All the studies made by the nursery 
school authorities go to show that most of the 
behavior problems presented by little children 
are the result of the behavior of those whom 
they live with. Miss Henton’s almost miracu- 
lous results in dealing with these problems are 
due, she believes, not to methods alone, but 
also to three factors in her attitude toward the 
child: first to her sincere and deep love for the 
‘child, which he feels as his unfailing comfort 
and support even at times of discipline, second 
to her reverent respect for him as an individual 
as important as herself, however little, and third 
to unwearying patience. These should indeed 
be elements in the attitude with which the adult 
approaches the problems of child training. And 
to all these another element should be added, 
the attitude that encourages gaiety and 
laughter, and insists on joy as a right and duty. 
Just as in considering standards of physical, 
mental, and emotional development we came at 
last to the conclusion that there could be no
-P-A-G-E-159
  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT 135 
health without happiness, and no right learn- 
ing, without pleasure in learning, no wholesome 
emotional condition without a sunny atmos- 
phere, so in considering standards for social 
development ‘we realize that the good child is 
the happy child and that the way to teach good- 
ness to a child is to help him find the ultimate 
joy in goodness, joy in service, joy in sacrifice, 
joy in life and in work. 
TEST EXERCISES 
1. Provide opportunities for children to play 
together and note their behavior in a group. Do they 
seem shy or forward, social or unsocial, popular or 
unpopular, leaders or followers? Consider the atti- 
tude of other children and of adults toward the child 
you are studying and note the exact types of behavior 
toward which their attitude is a response. Is it what 
the child says or does or something in his appearance 
or manner that makes people like or dislike, seek or 
avoid him? 
2. Analyze the child’s quarrels, going back not 
only to the original offensive act, but to the nature of 
the provocation behind it. 
8. Note the ages when children play individually, 
each with his own doll or toy kept strictly to himself 
and when they begin to share their playthings or pool 
them for some common project. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
ee ee ee nae 
136 TRAINING THE TODDLER 10g 
| ~~, Consider critically your own methods of trying 
to help children conquer their faults. How do you go 
to work on each problem? Do you try to modify 
feeling or expression of feeling? Have you realized 
the possibilities of indirect methods which save the 
child’s pride? 
5. Is the child developing standards regarding the 
relative seriousness of various kinds of misconduct 
or does he seem to regard trivial faults (breaking or 
losing things, coming late to meals, etc.) as on the 
same plane with vital defects such as lying, cruelty, 
or jealousy ? 
6. Analyze carefully every lie you are sure of. 
Do you understand the motive? Can you find any 
trace of insincerity in the child’s atmosphere—any- 
thing underhand in the conduct of others toward him? 
If a tendency to lying has been overcome, what do 
you think accomplished the cure? 
7. Study the cause of any display of eruelty. Try 
to determine whether it was due to curiosity to observe 
the conduct of the victim, to ignorance of the suffer- 
ing involved, to actual enjoyment of the sight of suf- 
fering, or to a mere freakish unconsidered impulse. 
8. Note successful and unsuccessful attempts to 
modify children’s behavior which you have observed 
or experienced. Try to discover where the mistakes 
were made and what were the special factors in the 
treatment which made for success.

RESULTS FROM NURSERY SCHOOL TRAINING 
Turty children who had attended the 
Merrill Palmer School more than six months 
are now. enrolled in public schools. Not until 
reports from many more are received shall we 
dare pass judgment on the effect of their pre- 
school training. All we can do as yet is to 
watch the progress of each child, record the 
results of any definite tests and measurements, 
note any significant comments of teachers, 
parents, or children, as they pass into our 
standardized school systems, and hope so to 
interpret the message they bring as to lead to 
ever wiser modification of our ever tenta-

INDEPENDENCE 
Sammy’s mother is a widow, a teacher in 
the large school in whose kindergarten he 
enrolled when he left the nursery school. His 
teacher is awe-struck at Sammy’s competent 
organizing of his own small affairs. ‘‘ He takes 
139
-P-A-G-E-164
140 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
off and cares for his wraps without help,’’ she 
reports, ‘‘ knows where all the material is and 
when and how to get it out and put it back, and 
exactly how to help me get things done right. 
When noon comes he sets his own little table 
and unpacks his nice lunch—hot soup or cocoa 
in his thermos bottle and all. While he eats, he 
entertains us, and when he is through he clears 
everything up himself. Then he takes a book or 
toy to amuse himself and trots off for the 
teachers’ rest room, where he lies down on a 
couch and takes his nap. His mother’s last 
class is over early in the afternoon and then 
she comes to sit beside him with her work, until 
he wakes to go home with her.’’ 
Sammy’s case is of course unusual, but the 
most general comment of kindergarten teachers 
has been that the children from the Merrill 
Palmer School stand out as able to take care 
of themselves—‘‘ not so helpless,’’? say the 
teachers, ‘‘ as the average kindergarten pupil.’’ 
This of course is a result to be expected. It 
only shows more clearly the possibility of 
acquiring this desirable independence before the 
kindergarten period.

LANGUAGE 
Melpa is a little Greek girl who heard no 
English at home and spoke very little when she 
entered the nursery school, at three. Her 
kindergarten teacher says she did not realize 
how recently Melpa’s English had been picked 
up—had supposed the family must have been 
in this country a long time, as the child was 
under no handicap in comparison with the 
American born children in the class. Melpa 
again is an extreme case, but perhaps the second 
most frequent comment on the nursery school 
children has been that they are at home with 
words, at ease in conversation, accustomed to 
story telling and memorizing and discussion. 
James, at three, was somewhat of a problem. 
His intelligence quotient was not high, he was 
handicapped by a deformed foot so that he had 
to wear a brace, and his behavior was often dis- 
tinctly unsocial. His kindergarten teacher, 
who had not been informed of his previous 
record, says: 
LEADERSHIP 
“« James is the best example I have ever seen 
of development which was slow and disappoint- 
ing at first and thoroughly satisfactory later.
-P-A-G-E-166
  142 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
He could not adjust for months—did absolutely 
nothing. I had expected a good deal of him 
because I knew he had a good home background 
and the advantage of this wonderful pre-school 
training. His father was as disappointed as I 
was. He thought perhaps James would do 
better if he skipped the second semester of 
kindergarten and went right into first grade. 
We had several long talks about it. I said to 
him, ‘I could teach James to read tomorrow, 
but that isn’t what James needs, He needs 
adjustment to the larger group and a chance to 
develop qualities that will help him to find his 
place among other first graders.’ His father 
decided to follow my advice and James in his 
own good time began to show leadership, initia- 
tive and originality. The first time he stood out 
in a marked way was on the day the children 
were building a house of blocks. They wanted 
a light for their house and did not know what 
to do about it. James belongs to the morning 
group, but in the afternoon of this day, he came 
hurrying in with eyes and cheeks blazing, and 
something held up in both hands. ‘ My daddy 
is going to take me to Northville,’ he burst forth,
-P-A-G-E-167
GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 143 
‘ but first I came here because I’ve got an idea,’ 
and he held up his treasure—an old electric 
bulb. ‘ This will be a light for the house.’ Then 
he considered— But how can I make it stand 
up?—I know! J’ll build it up with clay.’ His 
father followed him in and said, ‘ I’m going to 
take him for a drive but he wouldn’t go until 
he had brought you this.’ The next day James 
built his lamp up with clay and then decided— 
‘ Now I’m going to let this dry.’ ‘ What then?’ 
L asked, ‘ Then I’m going to paint it,’ he replied. 
The others followed his example and we had 
several lovely lamps. From that time, he has 
been a leader. ‘ Come over to my house,’ he 
will say. ‘ My father has lumber in the base- 
ment and he will give us some.’ And he will 
get several of them to help him haul boards to 
school in his wagon. He is a good experience 
for a teacher who gets discouraged.’’ 
ELIMINATION OF UNDESIRABLE 
TENDENCIES 
Quite as interesting as the development of 
desirable characteristics has been the elimi- 
nation of undesirable ones. Rose Marie is a
-P-A-G-E-168
144 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
brilliant little girl with an alarmingly high in- 
telligence quotient. At three, when she entered 
the Merrill Palmer School, she was addicted to 
“« showing off.’’ Her first remark when enrolled 
was, ‘‘ I’m a precocious child with a fascinating 
personality.’’ At six, she is spectacularly a 
member of the third grade, but among all the 
characteristics fully and capably discussed by 
her teacher, there is no word of ‘‘ showing off.’’ 
Direct questioning elicits only surprise. ‘‘ Why 
no, I never noticed Rose Marie showing off ’’— 
a result astonishing and gratifying to nursery 
school authorities. 
David, whose shyness in the nursery school 
was his chief handicap, displays no trace of it 
in the larger kindergarten group. ‘‘ Why no,’’ ' 
says the teacher again, ‘‘ He’s anything but a 
shy child.’’ 
Obstreperous Bobby, the terror of the 
nursery school, is now a member in good and 
regular standing of the second grade. His 
teacher’s comment is, ‘‘ Such a darling child— 
no trouble at all—lively and mischievous, but so 
eute. And he’s lovely in games and singing,
-P-A-G-E-169
  GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 145 
and you ought to see how sweet he looked in the 
lavender suit he wore on purpose to show me.”’ 
Supercilious Donald, selected in preceding 
pages as an example of conceited ‘‘ stand-off- 
ishness,’’ is described by his teacher as a 
“* pleasant, manly little chap, straightforward, 
nice with the other children.’’ 
Of course it must be admitted that there 
may have been other wholesome influences at 
work in these children’s lives besides the Merrill 
Palmer School, so that without its help these 
undesirable tendencies might have been cured. 
Every mother knows that worrisome traits in 
little children seem sometimes to disappear as 
suddenly and inexplicably as they came, and of 
course, the pre-school training is not an infal- 
lible specific. 
OBSTINATE CASES 
There have been two cases of difficult chil- 
dren who are still reported as difficult. In both 
cases the mothers can not be brought to see or 
admit the difficulties, but continue to excuse and 
explain and deny without any real attempt to 
cooperate. And there is one case of conflict in 
reports of mental ability which still baffles us 
10  
-P-A-G-E-170
ER Le ee mE nT eer ee rgd 
r 
146 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
all. Lizzie, whose intelligence quotient was 
among the highest, whose whole record at the 
Merrill Palmer School is extremely superior, 
has made a very mediocre showing in public 
school. Her low test record placed her in the 
second intelligence grouping, and her indiffer- 
ent reading and spelling bore out this judgment. 
After several months, she was returned to the 
Merrill Palmer School and re-tested—again 
with a superior rating, though not so high as at 
first. On the strength of this she was promoted 
from the kindergarten to the first grade where 
she ‘‘ failed ’’ and had to repeat the work. The 
only explanation so far offered is that her home 
background, distinctly poorer than that of the 
children she associates with, makes more of a 
difference at six in academic school subjects 
than it did at three in nursery school activities. 
This is borne out by the fact that she is still 
reported as ‘‘ precocious,’’ capable in all kinds 
of manual work, and reliable and responsible 
beyond her years. The remark of one teacher, 
‘“ Lizzie never says an unnecessary word,’’ sug- 
gests that she may be inhibited by some feeling 
of social disadvantage, But in spite of these
-P-A-G-E-171
GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 147 
three cases it seems only fair to say that the 
evidence is strong to show that the pre-school 
training made it possible to check with compara- 
tive ease faults which would only have become 
more deeply rooted had the conditions which 
bred them been unmodified for two more years. 
THE NURSERY SCHOOL’S MESSAGE TO 
THE KINDERGARTEN 
Granting, then, that the satisfactory devel- 
opment of the children who attend the nursery 
school and their satisfactory adjustment to 
the public kindergarten seems to indicate 
that such training is eminently worth while, 
what message has this training for the kinder- 
garten itself? Is there anything that kinder- 
garten teachers may do with the resources now 
at their command to hasten the day when edu- 
cational systems will begin betimes? There 
seems no doubt that kindergarten teachers are 
ready to welcome the nursery school. Their 
interest in the pre-school child is always alert 
and comprehensive. They read the writings of 
those who are studying pre-school education 
and invite them to speak at kindergarten con-  
-P-A-G-E-172
148 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
ventions. Indeed, there is nothing in kinder- 
garten tradition that shuts out the child under 
five. We all know that education, as understood 
in the kindergarten, through play, with joy and 
freedom and active self-expression, in an atmos- 
phere of gentleness and affection, is as appro- 
priate to the three year old as to the five year 
old. But the present problem of the kinder- 
garten is the five year old. What does a study of 
nursery school method suggest that might in 
any way improve our service to our five 
year olds? 
CONTINUATION OF PHYSICAL CARE 
““TIt would be splendid,’’ says one kinder- 
garten teacher after visiting the Merrill Palmer 
School, ‘‘ If our public kindergarten could con- 
tinue the elaborate physical care these children 
receive. I wish you could see the stuff my 
children bring to eat. The mothers seem con- 
vineed that they can’t get through the morning 
without a lunch, and when the lunches are 
opened, I am horrified, Mamie will have two 
bananas, Tommy a huge piece of cocoanut cake, 
Elsie four pickles and a bag of salted peanuts,
-P-A-G-E-173
  GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 149 
Katy cold sausage. I try my best to tell them 
they don’t need anything between meals and 
then the mothers come and complain to the 
principal that I expect them to starve the 
children.’ 
APPLICATION OF HEALTH STANDARDS 
The teacher’s problem here, of course, is to 
educate the parents. To be effective, she must 
first know what physical standards should be 
expected of five year olds—what degree of 
physical development they should have reached 
—weight, height, motor abilities, ete. Thus 
fortified with a working set of standards for the 
ideal five year old, the kindergarten teacher 
should in the second place do her conscientious 
best to measure against these standards each 
child in her charge. She should know the physi- 
cal condition of every one, and cooperate intel- 
ligently with the parents in making and keeping 
the children physically fit. Where physical ex- 
aminations have been made, she should know the 
results. Where they have not been made, she 
should urge parents not to delay them, and 
should strive to hasten the day when such exam-
-P-A-G-E-174
  150 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
inations shall be a part of the regular routine 
of enrolment in every school. She should 
furthermore accustom herself to the habit of 
daily inspection of each child entering the room, 
and train herself to recognize symptoms of 
malnutrition, fatigue, cold, fever, undue nervous 
strain, or incipient infections. She should keep 
the room, particularly the floor, washed clean, 
at any cost of battling with janitors and rigor- 
ous wiping of shoes. She should use every 
opportunity to warn both children and parents 
against coffee, pork, pie, doughnuts, and too 
much candy, and to urge hygienic clothing, out- 
door play, open windows, and sufficient sleep. 
Invested with the sanction of the institution, she 
speaks with an authority Oe even kinder- 
garten children accept. Nervous little Mamie 
was losing weight and sleep under the over- 
stimulating responsibility of ‘‘ being a fairy in 
a show.’’ She rebelled at going to bed at nine 
o’clock and was in: a continual state of fuming 
irritability. Her worried mother finally ap- 
pealed to her teacher, who attacked the situa- 
tion so competently that the child was induced 
to retire regularly at half past seven, with 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 151 
immediately beneficial results. ‘‘ Oh, Miss 
Arden, won’t you please get Charles to take his 
castor oil? ”? entreated another frantic parent, 
*¢ He’ll do anything you say.’’ 
The same two general principles may be 
applied to the contribution of nursery school 
practice in revealing the responsibility of the 
kindergarten teacher toward the mental devel- 
opment of five year olds. It is harder to get 
reliable standards for mental than for physical 
development, but what there are should be avail- 
able to kindergarten teachers, so that they may 
know what ought to be expected of the children, 
and determine so far as possible the mental 
attainment and capacity of each child. Kinder- 
garten teachers are always astonished at the 
powers of three year olds. Many of them would 
be interested in assisting with scientific studies 
of the powers of five year olds. If only the 
kindergarten could make use of its opportunity 
to experiment, compare, measure, standardize, 
it might render a tremendous service to the 
progress of scientific child study. This means 
first of all trained leadership, and is primarily 
a problem of supervision. When pre-school
-P-A-G-E-176
  152 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
training becomes more general, it will be of 
course desirable for pre-school and kindergarten 
teachers to agree upon a curriculum which will 
avoid unnecessary duplication. ‘‘ Same games, 
same stories, nothing new at all,’? was Maud’s 
disgusted comment on her kindergarten. At 
present, it would seem more to the point for the 
few nursery school teachers to acquaint them- 
selves with standard kindergarten activities, 
and build their own programs to adjust as well 
as possible. 
CONTINUED OBSERVATION OF 
EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES 
Very suggestive indeed to the kindergartner 
is the attention given in the Merrill Palmer 
School to emotional attitudes. To maintain a 
pleasant wholesome emotional atmosphere has 
always been regarded as a requirement of the 
satisfactory kindergarten. But to feel definitely 
responsible for the diagnosing and treatment of 
the undesirable emotional states of individual 
children is a different matter. It is a short 
step, however, from the motherly, sympathetic, - 
affection so universally characteristic of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
US 2 CEE ae OMT en Ter ater) ety te Teer teem 
GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 153 
kindergartner to the trained scientific consider- 
ation of the fears and tempers and jealousies 
that beset the infant soul. The teacher should 
attack the problem seriously, first by keeping 
up with the rapidly increasing volume of ap- 
propriate psychological literature, second by 
thoughtful study of any manifestations of anger, 
fear, jealousy and other marked evil feelings, 
seeking causes and planning intelligent treat- 
ment. She should avoid antagonisms and re- 
pressions and respect children’s sensitiveness. 
Too many teachers, in the hurry of the day, fail 
to note the changing expressions on little chil- 
dren’s faces, and so lose a particularly delicate 
and charming method of discovering what goes 
on in little minds. Too many sweet and well 
disposed young teachers fail to grasp the impor- 
tance of treating the very little with the same 
courtesy they would show to adults. Too often 
the investigator who was following up the 
Merrill Palmer children was embarrassed by 
the kindergartner’s loud ‘‘ Johnny Jones? Yes, 
he’s right here. That’s Johnny, sitting over 
there. Come here, Johnny ’’ with no explana- 
tion as to why a stranger should be making 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
ee en er ene en eee 
154 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
inquiries about Johnny, and no perception of 
Johnny’s shy bewilderment in the face of his 
staring mates. In one case a teacher—not a 
kindergarten teacher—called shrilly, ‘‘ Come 
here, Tony—(look at that scar over his eye). 
Tell the lady how you got that scar, Tony. Shot, 
yes! Shot with what, Tony? A bomb, yes! ’’— 
all the time quite oblivious of Tony’s agonized 
shame. Even in this enlightened day when 
corporal punishment is no more there are occa- 
sional teachers who resort to loud tones and 
““erossness.’’ Kathleen’s mother, reproached 
with Kathleen’s frequent absences, explained, 
‘That teacher is too rough for her—yells at 
the kids and scares her so she can’t stand it 
every day.’’ And little James in the first grade 
asked his mother to have his front seat changed 
—‘‘ I’ve got the desk she always pounds on with 
an eraser when she wants us to pay attention 
and it hurts my ears,’’ he explained. 
It must be admitted that no one who has had 
the opportunity to observe closely over a period 
of years the whole school system of a large city 
can fail to note that the most sympathetic 
insight into child nature, the most ideal emo- 
tional atmosphere found anywhere is in kinder-  
-P-A-G-E-179
GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 155 
garten teaching. It is in the extension of this 
type of teaching up and down that the most 
significant contribution to educational method 
can be made. On the adjustment of the child to 
the social group, the nursery school has 
developed no technique that the kindergarten is 
not already practicing. The problem in the 
kindergarten is to relieve the sense of scram- 
bling by reducing the size of the group in pro- 
portion to the number of teachers. No one 
teacher can keep the balance right in a group 
of thirty or forty children. And perhaps this 
situation may not be so hopeless as from the 
budget point of view, it sometimes seems. The 
success of student helpers in the nursery school, 
the need of high school students for practice 
with little children, may suggest new modi- 
fications of the old pupil teacher idea to 
the advantage of both high school and kinder- 
garten classes. 
OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE COMMUNITY 
IN CHILD CARE 
The nursery school has after all relatively 
little to suggest to the kindergarten regarding 
method or practice. Its real message is rather 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
er ee ee 
156 TRAINING THE TODDLER 
a challenge to the kindergarten to use more 
effectively its opportunity to educate the com- 
munity in sound standards of child care. To 
accomplish this, the kindergarten should work 
not only through individual teachers, but with 
organized power and purpose. Its teachers 
should be supplied systematically with informa- 
tion as to extension classes or reading material 
which may be placed at the service of parents. 
They should be made familiar with the functions 
of the various social agencies and sympathetic 
toward their aims so that workers might enter 
the schools secure of intelligent codperation. 
The teacher, who sees the children daily, is in 
a far more strategic position to work out family 
and neighborhood problems than the social 
worker, who is only an occasional visitor. 
COOPERATION WITH 
PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 
The best medium of all for the kindergarten 
to work with is the Parent-Teacher Association. 
If there is none, the kindergarten should take a 
leading part in stimulating a desire for its 
immediate organization. Where it already
-P-A-G-E-181
GRADUATING INTO KINDERGARTEN 157 
exists, the kindergarten should keep very close 
to it, acting as interpreter between the home and 
the more formal departments of the school. In 
Detroit, a weekly class in child care is held at 
the Merrill Palmer School, and is attended by 
representatives of Parent-Teacher Associations 
and of Federated Clubs who take the message 
back to their various organizations. It would 
be well if kindergarten teachers also were 
enrolled in such a class. The Parent-Teacher 
Association is the best medium because it is the 
only organization which brings together in the 
interests of childhood the two institutions com- 
mitted to the service of childhood, the home and 
the school, and for the sake of that service has 
over and over again demonstrated that parents 
and teachers can work together, that men and 
women can work together, that people of oppos- 
ing creeds, nations, races, color, in the face of 
life-long prejudices and ignorances, can still 
triumphantly and effectively work together.

PREFACE 
This book, as suggested by its title, contains a discussion of 
the general problem of equipping the farm and the farmstead. 
The material herein presented has been collected from various 
sources during the author’s service as a teacher. An effort 
has been made to bring together and to present in a readable 
and teachable form such facts and principles as the modern 
farmer demands and must understand for the successful practice 
of his profession. 
It is only in very recent years that questions such as those 
discussed in this book have been given the consideration which 
they deserve. Colleges, experiment stations, institute speakers, 
and lecturers generally, have given their full time and effort 
during the past quarter of a century to the discussion of larger 
crop yields and better live stock. It is well perhaps that it should 
have been so, for profitable crop and live-stock production are the 
foundation of agricultural prosperity. On the other hand, when 
one reflects that about one fifth of the total value of farms in the 
corn belt is wrapped up in buildings and machinery, the wonder 
is that the subject has not been given adequate discussion long 
before. But times have changed and the remarkable interest 
which is now being taken in such questions as farm buildings, 
water supply, sewage-disposal, farm lighting etc. proves beyond 
question that information on these and kindred subjects is being 
eagerly sought. 
The point of view taken in this book has been, first, that of 
the farmer of the present who is seeking information as to ways 
and means of making his work easier and his burdens lighter — 
to whom it is hoped the book will make a strong appeal and in 
the solution of whose problems it is believed he may find practical 
help ; second, that of the student who is to become the farmer of 
the futuré. In the student’s interest an attempt has been made 
vu

to arrange the subject matter in pedagogic For though it is 
probably true that the formal rules of pedagogy have frequently 
been violated, for in the presentation of a subject so new, and on 
which there is so little available material, the chief problem has 
been what to present rather than in what manner it should be 
presented. An effort has also been made to approach each sub- 
ject in such a way as to emphasize the practical application of the 
principles involved and studiously to avoid academic discussion 
of detail having little or no practical value. 
The author wishes to express his deep obligation to the many 
commercial firms through whose hearty codperation the use of 
many of the illustrations herein found was made possible, and 
especially would he commend his publishers for their painstaking 
care in the preparation of illustrative material. Thanks are due 
also to Mr. F. W. Ives, for generous assistance in the preparation 
of drawings. It is hoped that the many errors which are sure to 
occur, together with the possible shortcomings of the book, will 
be given charitable consideration. H. C. RAMSOWER

CHAPTER 
SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS 
In a study of farm engineering and, in particular, of that phase 
of the subject dealing with farm mechanics, we are constantly 
considering the matter of forces, their application, their trans- 
formation, their effects, as embodied in even the simplest farm 
tools. A certain force is required to draw a plow, to drive a 
wedge, to lift a load, to make an engine 
run, to tie a knot in a grain-binder, each 
task requiring a different method of utiliz- 
ing the same thing — force; and it is only 
through a knowledge of some of the simple 
principles of mechanics that we can come 
to a clear understanding of these things. 
Force. A force is an action exerted by 
one body upon another, which tends to 
change the state of motion of the body acted A . Fic. 1. Illustrating the upon. Thus, a loaded wagon is drawn by a principle of moment and 
team. The team (one body) exerts a force moment arm 
upon the wagon (the other body) and changes 
its state of motion. A man picks up a bucket of water. His 
hand changes the state of motion of the bucket and therefore 
exerts a force. A small boy endeavors to lift the same bucket 
but does not move it. The definition of a force, however, still 
holds true, since he tends to change its state of motion. 
Moment of a force. If a rope AZ is directed over a pulley 
as shown in Fig. 1, and another rope is attached to the axle of 
the pulley as at C and a weight W suspended from this rope, 
I 
   
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
there will obviously be no rotation of the pulley. If the weight 
be transferred to A, however, the pulley will begin to rotate 
toward the right. The force exerted by the weight in this posi- 
tion is said to have a moment 
arm a, which is the perpendic- 
ular distance from the line 
along which the force acts to 
the axle of the pulley, or, 
more generally speaking, to 
the axis of rotation. This tend- 
ency of a force to produce 
rotation about a given axis is called the moment of the force in 
respect to that axis; hence, 
  Fic.2. Another method of illustrating 
the principle of moment and moment arm 
The moment of a force = the force x the moment arm. 
In Fig. 2 the force / applied to the end of the lever work- 
ing over the fulcrum # tends to lift the weight 7. In other 
words, it tends to produce rotation about the axis O because it 
has a moment arm a. 
The moment of the forcee=/'x a. 
Line representation of forces. Any force acting on a body is 
completely described if three things are stated: (1) its point of 
application, (2) its direction, and (3) its magnitude. Since a line 
may begin at any point, may 
be drawn in any direction, and 
may be of any length, it may 
be used to represent a force. 
Any convenient scale may be 
assumed, as 10 lb. to the inch, 
20 |b. to the inch, etc. Thus, 
two boys each have a rope tied 
to a post at approximately the 
same point, as shown in Fig. 3. 
One of the boys exerts a pull of 10 Ib. in one direction, the 
other a pull of 20 lb. in the opposite direction. If two lines 
are. drawn, one 2 in. long representing the 10-pound force, 
and the other extending 4 in. in the opposite direction, we       
  Fic. 3. Line representation of forces
-P-A-G-E-15
  
SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS 3 
have a representation of the magnitude and direction of each 
of the forces in question. Plainly, the sum, or resultant, of 
these is represented by the difference:in length of the two lines, 
a difference which represents a force of 10 |b. 
acting in the direction of the greater force. 
Composition of forces. In Fig. 4 let it be 
assumed that two ropes are attached to a weight. 
A force of 40 lb. is applied at the end of 
Fic. 4. Resultant of one rope and a force of 30 Ib. at the end

the same effect as the The tendency of the two forces will be to 
two original forces ove the object in a direction represented by 
the diagonal of the parallelogram as constructed on the two force 
lines. Since the two lines as drawn completely specify the two 
forces acting on the body, the diagonal will specify in magnitude 
and direction a single force which could supplant the two forces 
and produce the same effect on the body. Plotting the forces 
to a scale of 10 lb, to the inch and completing the parallelogram, 
we find that the length of 
the diagonal represents the 
resultant of the two forces. 
The same relation exists — : neraenithevtotorceeba nd Fie. 5. ee oe acting at a 
their resultant, even though The parallelogram method applies even though the forces act at angles other _ the forces are not acting at an angle of go with 
than 90°. If, for example, oie 
a horizontal force of 60 Ib, acts at an angle of 30° with another 
force of 36 lb., the diagonal of the parallelogram, completed as be- 
fore, will show the resultant to represent a force of 92.9 Ib. (Fig. 5). 
It may be concluded, therefore, that if two forces act at the 
same point and in different directions in the same plane, the 
resultant may be found from the parallelogram of forces and will 
be represented in magnitude by the diagonal of the parallelogram, 
If more than two forces act at a point, the resultant of the 
system may be found by determining the resultant of any two, 
then the resultant of this resultant and a third force, etc. through 
all the forces, the last resultant being that of the system (Fig. 6).

Resolution of forces. Just as two or more forces acting upon 
a body may be combined into one force having the same effect 
on the body, so may a single force be resolved into two or more 
— component forces having 
the same effect upon the 
body as the original force. 
Such a process is called 
the resolution of forces, 
and the solution of such 
cases is through the paral- 
lelogram, as before. In 
  Fic, 6. Showing method of finding the resultant Fi8- 7; for example, a 
of three or more forces force of 100 Ib, is acting 
A system of three or more forces may be reduced to. at an angle of 30° with a single resultant by the parallelogram method I an the horizontal. This force 
may be resolved into its horizontal and vertical components by 
completing a parallelogram of which the given force is the diag- 
onal, one side being vertical, the other horizontal. Constructing 
to scale, the horizon- 
tal force is found to 
be 86.6 lb. ; the verti- 
cal force, 50 lb. 
It should be clearly 
understood that the 
result of the solution 
shows that when the 
force of 100 Ib. acts 
on the body at an an- 
gle of 30°, as shown, 
there is a tendency to 
lift the body vertically Fic. 7. Showing the use of coérdinate paper in 
plotting curves as well as a tendency 
to draw the body in a horizontal direction. To find the values 
of these two tendencies is the object of the solution, 
The use of codrdinate paper. The solution of simple problems 
in the composition and resolution of forces is readily accomplished 
on coordinate paper. A sample of eight-division paper with a 
problem solved is shown in Fig. 7.

SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS 5 
Work. When a force acts upon a body and causes it to change 
its state of motion, work is done upon that body. For example, 
a team draws a loaded wagon. The state of motion of the wagon 
is changed, and hence work is done. Work, therefore, is equal 
to the product of the force exerted and the distance passed over 
in the direction in which the force acts; or, 
Work = force x distance, 
or W=Fs, 
If the displacement is not in the direction in which the force 
acts, the work done is equal to the product of the force and the 
component of the distance in the direction in which the force 
acts, or the product of the distance and the component of the 
force in the direction of displacement. Thus, a barrel of salt is 
rolled up a plank twelve feet long into a wagon four feet high, 
the force acting in a line parallel to the ground. The work done 
is equal to the horizontal component of the distance over which 
the force acts (which is the distance on the ground from the end 
of the plank to the wagon) x the force. 
The significance of the factor s should be noted. The load 
above referred to might be so heavy that the team could not 
move it. No matter how hard they strain, no matter how much 
force they exert, no work is done until the wagon is moved. 
Measure of work. Since work is the product of force x distance, 
if, as is the custom, force is measured in pounds and distance in 
feet, the unit of work becomes the footpound (ft.-lb.) ; that is, 
a foot-pound of work is done when a force of 1 Ib, acts through 
a distance of 1 ft. In the case of the barrel of salt, if the barrel 
weighs 180 lb. and is lifted through a vertical distance of 4 ft., 
the work done is equal to 180 x 4 =720 ft.-lb. 
Power. A mason’s helper carries a pile of bricks from the ground 
to the second story of a building. The same amount of work is done 
whether he performs the task in one hour or in ten. If the work 
is done in one hour, however, more energy is consumed, more 
effort is put forth, more power is required. Hence power is the rate 
of doing work, the element of time entering into consideration. 
Unit of power. The customary unit of power is the horse power 
(H. P.). When coal was raised from the mines in England, it was
-P-A-G-E-18
    6 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
found that the average horse could lift a certain number of pounds 
through a certain height in one day. From this practical approxi- 
mation the value of the unit for horse power was determined. 
It represents work done at the rate of 33,000 ft.-lb. per minute, 
or H.P.= 33,000 ft.-lb. per minute. 
Energy. Energy may be defined as the power to do work. Thus, 
water flowing over a dam possesses energy which may be used 
to turn a water-wheel. A storage battery possesses energy, since 
it may furnish ‘the current to run a motor, ignite the charge in 
a gasoline engine, etc. A sledge hammer possesses energy when 
poised in the air. 
Energy is of two kinds. Potential energy is defined as energy 
due to position, such as that possessed by water flowing over a 
dam. It may be measured by ascertaining the amount falling 
and the distance through which it falls. Thus, if the dam is 
10 ft. high, each cubic foot of water has a potential energy of 
62.4 X 10= 624 ft.lb. Therefore, 
Potential energy = W x h, 
where W= weight in pounds 
and A= height in feet. 
Kinetic energy is energy possessed by a body because of its 
motion. Thus, after water begins to fall it possesses energy because 
of its motion, and the common expression for this condition is 
  2 
Kinetic energy = aes , 
where M = mass (weight + gravity) 
and V= velocity in feet per second. 
Machines. When the word “machine” is mentioned we 
think at once of corn-planters, grain-binders, gasoline engines — 
tools with which we are familiar. These are machines, indeed, 
but each one, being rather complex, is made up of simpler 
elements which are machines just as truly as are the more com- 
plex structures. A machine is a device which receives energy 
from some outside source and transmits and delivers it, in part, 
to some other point for the purpose of doing work. The object
-P-A-G-E-19
SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS 7 
in using machines. is to perform work which could not be per- 
formed so easily or so quickly without them, and at the same 
time to secure certain mechanical advantages. 
The lever and the inclined plane are the two basic machines. 
All other simple machines, such as the screw, the wheel and 
axle, the wedge, etc. — of which more complex machines are com- 
posed —are different forms of the lever and the inclined plane. 
The lever. The lever is used in three different forms, or 
classes — the class used depending upon the kind of work to be 
done, since each class has its Pa wa 
particular advantage. The 
three classes are shown in P F Ww 
Fig. 8. The distinguishing A 
feature in the classes is found 
to be in the point at which 
the force is applied in rela- 
tion to the weight and the 
fulcrum. In the first class 
the force must move over a 
much longer distance than 
  the weight; hence power is |“ F 
gained at the expense of dis- p 
tance, and the force moves ae i 
in a direction opposite to Mee Cc 
that of the weight. In the Fic. 8. Three classes of levers 
second class the same advan- _, first class; B, second class; C, third class 
tage is had as in the first class, 
but in this case the force and the weight move in the same direc- 
tion. In the ¢hird class the force moves through a shorter distance 
than the weight, velocity being secured at the expense of force. 
The solution of problems involving any one of the three 
classes depends upon the equation 
Power x power arm = weight x weight arm, 
or Px Pa=W*x Wa. 
No matter what the shape of the lever, the power arm is 
measured as the perpendicular distance from the fulcrum to the 
line in which the power acts.
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The inclined plane. The inclined plane is another simple 
machine, and is frequently used in rolling barrels up a plank, in 
the tread power, etc. The mechanical advantage depends upon 
the direction in which the power is applied. In Fig. 9, W 
might represent a barrel being rolled up an inclined plane. The 
weight of the barrel is represented by the vertical line WD. 
Resolving this into its two components, WE and WF, we find 
that WE represents the force that tends to pull the barrel down 
the plane. From the similar triangles DEW and ABC, 
EW: DW::BC: AC, 
or Pek. AG, 
or Power x power’s distance = weight x weight’s distance. 
When the power, therefore, acts in a line parallel to the plane, 
the power’s distance is the length of the plane. When the 
action is parallel to the base of the 
plane, the power’s distance is the length 
of the base—the weight’s distance 
being the same in either case and 
being equal to the height of the plane. 
The jackscrew. The screw is a mod- 
8 ification of the inclined plane. The 
pitch of a screw designates the dis-

ple of the inclined plane Therefore a screw of } pitch (some- 
times designated as 8 pitch) has eight 
threads per inch, and in order that the screw may be moved 
through one inch it must be turned eight times around. The 
jackscrew is a screw built on a large scale and so constructed 
as to use the principle of the inclined plane in a peculiar way. 
The mechanical advantage is determined in the same way as for 
the inclined plane. This calculation is based upon the condi- 
tion that the power moves through a distance equal to the 
circumference of a circle whose radius is the length of the jack- 
screw bar, while the weight is being moved through a distance 
equal to the pitch of the screw. 
The wheel and axle. The wheel and axle is an application of 
a lever of the first or the second class —usually of the second c

class. In most cases, as in the common windlass, the radius of 
the wheel (in this case the crank) is the power arm, while the 
radius of the axle is the weight arm. Problems involving the

view of a tackle 
Each block has three sheaves 
or pulleys. The rope to which 
the power is applied is the fall 
rope, and the block from which 
this rope passes is the fall block 
must be held by the pulleys for some time. 
Fig. 11 illustrates the construction, and its oper- 
ation may be explained, with the help of Fig. 12, 
as follows : The upper block has two sheaves dif- 
  wheel and axle are solved most easily 
by means of the lever formula. 
The pulley. The pulley is a lever of 
the first or second class having equal arms. 
A single pulley has no mechanical advan- 
tage, but serves simply to change the direc- 
tion of the rope. When pulleys are used 
in combination, however, as in a tackle, the 
mechanical advantage varies directly as the 
number of cords supporting the weight. 
In the tackle shown in Fig. 10 there 
are three sheaves in both the upper 
and the lower block. If the lower block 
is raised one foot, the power applied at 
P will move through six feet. Hence, 
neglecting friction, a given power at 
P will raise a weight W 
six times greater than 
itself. 
The differential pulley.

until the upper sheaves turn once around, it will have moved 
through a distance equal to 27R, and rope AA’ will be raised the 
same distance. At the same time the smaller sheave will turn

to 2mr. The rope AA'A'B will be shortened a distance equal 
to 27R— 277, or 27 (R—7), and the weight will be moved up 
one half this distance. The ratio between the distance through 
which the power moves and the distance through which the 
weight moves, which is the mechanical advantage of the pulley,

the weight does not travel downward when the power is removed.

the principle of t! 
  The moment tending to turn the sheaves in a 
clockwise direction is equal to e x 7; the coun- 
terclockwise moment is ree R. Since R is 
greater than 7, the tendency to a counterclock-

pulley must equal this amount or the weight will 
move downward if the power is removed. 
Friction. Friction is the resistance encountered 
when an effort is made to slide one body along 
another, If a loaded sled is standing on snow, 
quite a force is required to start it; but once 
te started, it is kept moving by the application 
eitcrential pale of a very small force. Here, then, are two kinds 
of friction : (1) static friction, or friction encoun- 
tered when a body is started from rest, and (2) siding friction, or 
friction eer when a body is kept in motion. 
The coefficie ut of friction is the ratio between the force neces- 
sary to start or draw one body along another and the pressure 
normal to the surface in contact; that is, 
Coefficient of friction = friction ‘ 
pressure 
It is very evident that friction is an extremely variable factor 
depending upon many variable conditions. Experimental evidence 
goes to show, however, that certain general statements, which 
are known as the laws of friction, may be made. 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS II 
1. Friction is independent of the area in contact. 
2. Friction is proportional to the pressure between the surfaces 
in contact. 
3. Friction does not vary greatly with velocity, but is greatest 
at low speeds. 
4. Friction depends upon the nature of the surfaces in contact. 
Friction in machines. Since all machines, no matter how 
simple, have surfaces rubbing on other surfaces, the element of 
friction must be considered. The amount of friction, with other 
losses, determines the efficiency of a machine; by efficiency is 
meant the ratio between the amount of energy delivered by a 
machine as useful work and the amount put into the machine. 
For example, a certain amount of gasoline is consumed in operat- 
ing an engine for a given length of time. This fuel in the 
process of combustion exerts a certain definite force against the 
piston head. If, now, a break is applied to the belt pulley, and 
the useful work which the. engine is capable of delivering is 
measured, it will be found to be less than that delivered to the 
piston head. Friction and other losses consume the difference. 
The efficiency, then, may be stated thus: 
Efficiency = output . input 
As a concrete illustration, a jackscrew having } pitch is placed 
under a load of 4 tons. To lift the load it is necessary to exert 
a force of 50 lb. on the end of the jackscrew bar, the bar being 
18 in. from its end to the center of the screw. Theoretically 
the force required if the jackscrew were a frictionless machine 
would be as follows : 
8000 x a X 9.42 5 ase 9.42; 
whence 27.0, 
In this case the output, or the work actually delivered, is 17.6 lb., 
while the input is 501b.; hence, 
Efficiency of jackscrew = +78 X 100 = 35.2 per cent, 
   
-P-A-G-E-24
  12 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
It is not possible to eliminate all of the friction in farm machines, 
but their efficiency may be generally increased by giving attention 
to their proper care and adjustment. Dull knives will greatly 
decrease the output of the mower, the grain-binder, the ensilage- 
cutter, etc. A little rust on the plow, the cultivator shovels, or 
the binder knotter materially increases friction. Lack of grease 
and oil on the bearings of the wagon, the manure-spreader, the 
Wp binder, etc. increases not only fric- 
tion but the wear on the bearings. 
Strength of materials. All mate- 
rials used in the construction of farm 
implements and farm structures are 
subjected to certain stresses and 
strains. They must therefore be so 
designed as to meet the demands 
made upon them without breaking. 
jw In. determining the load which a 
, timber — for example, a floor joist 
e Vf —wwill carry, two things must be 
taken into consideration, namely, 
= the size and shape of the joist and 
i the manner in which it is loaded. 
a Z The load which a timber sub- 
ene Four different ways in mitted to a bending stress will 
Besson gmaven loaded carry, varies as the breadth, as the 
square of the depth, and as the length between supports. A timber 
may be loaded in at least four different ways: it may be (1) sup- 
ported at one end and loaded at the other, (2) supported at one 
end and uniformly loaded, (3) supported at both ends and loaded 
in the middle, (4) supported at both ends and uniformly loaded. 
A factor of safety is used, also, in the design of timbers sub- 
jected to stress. This factor recognizes the fact that the safe 
load is very much less than the breaking load, the amount by 
which it is less depending on the strains to which it is likely to 
be subjected. The safe load may vary from one third to one 
twelfth of the breaking load, but as a rule it is taken to be about 
one sixth, in which case the factor of safety is said to be six. 
Taking these factors into consideration, certain formulas are     
  ESS

SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS 13 
presented to fit the cases above mentioned, by means of which it 
is possible to determine the proper size of timbers to use in places 
where a load is supported (as on floor joists) or to determine the 
safe load which timbers will carry. 
Naturally the load will vary with the kind of timber used. To 
allow for this a constant, A, is included in the formulas, and the 
value given this constant provides for a reasonable factor of 
safety. The values of A are as follows for the materials mentioned :

supports a hay fork and carrier at the end of a barn. How deep 
must the timber be to carry safely a load of 1500 lb. when 
applied 3 ft. from the support ? 
The problem falls under Case I, in which 6= 2" and Z = 3!. ath 
Substituting, 1500 = Biziepog

a= 90,

Hence a 2” x 10" piece would be used. 
Eveners. Fig. 14 illustrates the principle underlying the con- 
struction of the common two-horse evener, or doubletree. In the 
upper figure the three 
holes are on the same 
straight line. No matter 
in what position the 
horses are in relation to 
each other, the load will 
be evenly divided be- 
tween the two, because 
the lever arms, as shown 
in the figure, will always 
be of the same length. 
In the middle figure 
the end holes are placed 
to the rear of the mid- 
dle hole, a construction 
which is very common 
in farm eveners. One 
end is shown in a posi- 
tion 8 in. to the rear of

The upper figure is the only one which will equalize position the lever arm the load with the horses in any position z 
of the rear horse is seen 
to be 214 in. while that of the other horse is 234 in., this arrange- 
ment giving the horse in the rear a much greater portion of 
the total load. If the total pull is 4oo lb., in the position shown   
 
-P-A-G-E-27
SOME PRINCIPLES OF MECHANICS 15 
the load would be divided between the two horses as follows: 
The sum of the two lever arms, 21} in. + 23? in., is equal to 
45 in., which represents the effective length of the evener. 
Then, if « represents the pull of the rear horse, and since the 
load is in inverse proportion to the lever arms, 
45 :400::23}: 43 
hence, 45 x= 400 X 233, 
ie Tei s 
400 — 211.2 = 188.8 lb., pull of other horse. 
From this solution it is found that the rear horse, though usually 
the weaker of the two, is forced to pull 11.8 per cent more than 
his mate when the former is in a position 8 in. back of normal. 
The farther he gets behind, the heavier does his load become. 
The lowest figure shows a common construction for wagon 
doubletrees. The end clevis is firmly bolted to the evener, in 
which case the point of application of the pull is in front of the 
middle hole. As one horse forges ahead, his lever arm becomes 
shorter, and consequently his load becomes heavier, while the 
load of the horse which is behind becomes lighter. 
Although it is not practicable to make eveners with the three 
holes on the same straight line, this condition should be approxi- 
mated as closely as possible. The further lesson taught by these 
figures is that the driver should at all times keep the two horses 
abreast if he would have each pull one half the load. 
An advantage may be given either horse by lengthening his 
end of the evener or by shortening the other end. The amount 
of advantage given may be easily figured. Suppose one arm in 
a 48-inch evener were shortened 2 in. This would make one 
arm 22 in. and the other 24 in., with a total length of 46 in. 
If the total pull is 500 Ib., then 
40°75 00 37 222-5 
hence, 46 x = 11,000, 
x = 239.1 lb., the smaller load. 
The other horse will then pull 500 — 239.1 = 261.9 lb. The horse 
given the advantage pulls 8.7 per cent less than the other horse.

CHAPTER] II 
TRANSMISSION OF POWER 
As gasoline engines, electric generators and motors, and _vari- 
ous forms of water power are finding wide use on farms, a 
knowledge of the simple principles of power transmission is 
necessary. Only those principles a knowledge of which is likely 
to be useful upon the farm will be considered. Power is usually 
transmitted by means of belts, pulleys, and shafting ; by chains 
and sprockets ; and by gears. Rope transmission is only occasion- 
ally used in rural districts. 
Belts. There are three kinds of belts as regards material in 
common use —leather, rubber, and canvas. Leather belts are 
cut from the main body of a hide after the neck, belly, and tail 
portions are removed. The best belting is cut from the center, 
or the backbone portion, of the hide; the poorer qualities come 
from the edges. Leather belts are made in single-ply or double- 
ply. The latter costs twice as much as the former, but it is said to 
last more than twice as long. A double-ply belt cannot be used 
on pulleys smaller than ten or twelve inches in diameter. The 
leather belt should always be worked with the hair side next to 
the pulley, for this is the smoother side and so clings more 
closely to the pulley. Leather belts must be protected from 
moisture, steam, and oil. They should be cleaned and dressed 
occasionally. There are many belt-dressings on the market, but 
neat’s-foot oil is probably as good as any of them. 
Rubber belts are made by cementing together alternate layers 
of rubber and canvas, coating the whole with rubber, and then 
vulcanizing the rubber under high pressure. In thickness they 
vary from 2-ply to 8-ply. A 4-ply rubber belt is considered the 
equal of a single-ply leather belt. A rubber belt withstands heat 
and moisture better than leather, though under ordinary condi- 
tions it will not last so long as leather. A rubber belt must be 
carefully protected from oil and grease. 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
TRANSMISSION OF POWER 17 
Canvas belts are used a great deal on agricultural machinery, 
where they are exposed to the weather. They wear well, but 
are not quite so desirable for pulleys at fixed distances apart. 
To give an idea of the relative prices of the three kinds of belts, 
the retail prices in effect at the present time are quoted: 4-inch, 
4-ply rubber, 15 cents per foot; 4-inch, 4-ply canvas, 13 cents 
per foot; 4-inch single-ply leather, 48 cents per foot. The gaudy 
belt is a special form 
of canvas belt made 
by combining the can- 
vas layers with water- Ooo 
proofing material and 
then stitching and 
coating the whole 
again with the same 
material. This belt- 
ing is very durable 
and withstands hard HAacahene 
usage well. 
Horse power of 
leather belts. Power B 
is transmitted by a Fic. 15. Two methods for lacing belts 
belt by the aid of The lacing is begun at the middle of the belt 
friction between belt 
and pulleys. The horse power which a belt is transmitting at any 
time depends upon the pull, or tension, in the belt and upon the 
rate of travel, Kent gives the following formula for the horse 
power of a single-ply leather belt working under a tension of 
thirty-three pounds per inch of width:   
    
  
        
Horse power =   
1000” 
where v= velocity in feet per minute 
and zw = width in inches. 
The length of the belt required for two pulleys may be secured 
by a rule given by Kent: ‘‘ Add the diameter of the two pulleys, 
divide the sum by 2, multiply the quotient by 34, and add the 
product to twice the distance between the centers of the shafts.”
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Pulleys. Pulleys are made of iron or wood. The split-wood 
pulley is well adapted to all kinds of line-shaft work, though for 
permanent positions, as on grinders, shellers, etc., the iron pulley 
is perhaps to be preferred. The face of the pulley should be 
crowned, so that the belt will run to the center. A leather 
covering is frequently used to secure a better grip between belt 
and pulley, but, except under heavy loads, it is not necessary. 
In case of pulleys so placed that the belt is horizontal, the lower 
side of the belt should be the tight, or driving, side. Such an 
arrangement permits the slack upper side to settle upon the 
pulleys, thus adding to the friction and tending to prevent slippage. 
The speed and size of pulleys. A convenient rule for deter- 
mining either the speed or size of pulleys connected by a belt 
is the following : 
R.P.M. of driver x its diameter = R. P.M. of driven x its diameter. 
If any three of these factors are given, the fourth may be 
found. If, for example, a gasoline engine having a pulley 10 in. 
in diameter is belted to an electric generator having a 4-inch 
pulley and running at 1700 revolutions per minute, the speed 
may be found as follows. If 2 be the R.P.M. of the engine, then 
%X 10=1700 X 4 ;.. whence; 47= 280, 
If the speed or size of toothed gears is to be determined, it is 
only necessary to substitute the number of teeth for the diameter 
of the pulley, as given above. 
Shafting. Shafting is very frequently used where more than 
one machine is to be operated by the same engine. Cold-rolled 
steel shafting is the kind most generally used, it being supported 
upon hangers which are fastened to the floor, the wall, or the ceil- 
ing. The distance apart of the hangers depends on the size of the 
shafting. Kent gives the following formula for determining the 
proper distance between hangers : 
  Bee oe Le L=Vi4od, or d= , 140 
when £ = distance between hangers, in feet, 
and d= diameter of shaft, in inches. 
As a general rule the hangers should be about eight feet apart.
-P-A-G-E-31
  
TRANSMISSION OF POWER 19 
The horse power which shafting will transmit depends upon 
the diameter and upon the number of revolutions per minute. 
The usual formula is as follows, and assumes that the shaft is 
well supported, with pulleys close to bearings : 
3 
Horse power =   
? 
50 
when 5 d= diameter of shaft, in inches, 
and R= revolutions per minute. 
Sprockets and chains versus gears. In the construction of grain- 
binders, mowers, manure-spreaders, and other farm machinery 
both sprockets and chains, and gears, are used. Chain trans- 
mission is suitable where the speed is not great and where a 
positive drive is desired, if lost motion is not a consideration. 
It has this very decided advantage over the gear drive —it is 
cheaper to break a link in a chain than a tooth in a gear. In 
spur gears and bevel gears two teeth take almost the entire 
strain of the load, whereas in chain transmission a chain wraps 
around both sprockets, thus engaging a large number of teeth. 
Gears, however, afford a more compact and substantial construc. 
tion, and though lost motion is always found, proper adjustment 
reduces it to a minimum. Chazz links are made of steel or of 
malleable iron. The latter is more gen- 
erally used, though either gives satisfac- 
tion. It is claimed that steel links wear 
the sprockets more than do the malleable 
links, 
Triangles. Triangles are frequently fFic.16. The triangle is fre- 
used to transmit power from a windmill quently used to transmit 
to a pump some distance away, which PW Boo ne eee a pump some distance away 
distance should not exceed one hundred 
and fifty feet. As shown in Fig. 16, the wires should be crossed 
so that the mill rod.and the pump plunger will work in unison 
and the. windmill will do the heavy work on the upstroke.

  _CHAPTER III 
‘MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION 
In the chapters relating to various farm implements and 
machines, certain terms will be used in describing the materials 
from which such implements and machines are made. It is desir- 
able that some space be given to a discussion of these materials, 
in order that the student may better understand their properties. 
Wood. Wood enters to a greater or less extent into the con- 
struction of nearly all farm machines. It is far superior to iron 
or steel for those parts where a certain degree of resiliency is 
desirable, as in wagon wheels and in pitman rods for mowers. 
Since the weight of woods varies greatly, wood of light weight 
can be selected where lightness rather than strength is desirable. 
Wood lends itself, moreover, to neat construction and to artistic 
decoration with paint. 
Where strength and durability are required, the harder woods, 
such as hickory, oak, ash, and maple, are used. Such woods are 
found in bed rails for manure-spreaders and in wagon gears, 
tongues, eveners, etc. Where lightness is desired, pine and 
poplar are greatly used. Wagon beds, for example, are largely 
made of poplar. The wood entering into the construction of 
farm machinery, since it must endure hard usage and musi 
often stand out in the weather the year round, must be of the 
best quality, well seasoned, and thoroughly coated with paint. 
The increasing scarcity of timber has been largely responsible 
for the wide use of iron as material for farm machines. Iron is 
used in many common forms, such as cast iron, chilled iron, 
malleable iron, and steel. 
Cast iron. In the manufacture of cast iron the crude iron ore 
is charged into a blast furnace with alternate layers of limestone, 
or flux, and coke. A fire is kindled at the bottom of the furnace, 
and an intense heat is maintained by means of a forced air blast. 
20
-P-A-G-E-33
  MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION 21 
The melted iron drops to the bottom of the furnace. Some of 
the impurities pass off in gas, some combine with the flux, and 
still others remain in the iron. The melted iron, when not taken 
directly through other processes, is drawn off and cooled, forming 
pig iron. The pig iron is then remelted and cast into various 
forms which are known as cast-iron castings. 
Cast iron is of a coarse crystalline structure and is extremely 
hard and brittle. The carbon content is high, ranging from 2 
to 4} per cent, and exists in two forms, known as combined 
carbon and graphitic carbon. Wzte iron contains carbon in the 
former state and is extremely hard and brittle. Gray iron con- 
tains carbon in the graphitic form and is much softer than white 
iron, though of course it still possesses the characteristics of 
cast iron. 
Cast iron finds its greatest use in machine-construction. It 
can be readily cast into various shapes, and for the making of 
large castings, as engine foundations and mower frames, and for 
smaller castings where its physical properties meet the require- 
ments, it has no competitor. Gray iron is used extensively for 
gears, pulleys, and other parts which must be turned to shape 
in a lathe. 
Chilled iron. In certain parts of some farm implements and 
machines, as in some types of plow bottoms and bearings for 
disk harrows, a material is wanted that will take a good polish 
and wear well. Chilled iron meets these requirements in a very 
satisfactory way. In the making of chilled castings the usual 
method of making cast-iron castings is followed, except that the 
sand mold, or certain parts of it, is lined with iron, such part 
being called a chill. The result is that the casting cools rapidly 
and the carbon consequently remains in chemical combination 
and makes the casting extremely hard. The chill extends to a 
depth of from a quarter to three quarters of an inch, the depth 
depending upon the nature and effectiveness of the mold; the 
exterior surface, consequently, has the appearance of white iron, 
while the interior remains a gray iron. Chilled castings, such 
as those for bearings and plow bottoms, since, because of their 
hardness, they cannot be worked in a lathe, are ground and 
polished to the desired shape and smoothness.
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Malleable iron. Malleable-iron castings are manufactured by 
first making white-iron castings of the desired shape and size. 
These castings are then thoroughly cleaned of sand and put 
through an annealing process. This process consists in packing 
the castings in large iron boxes, surrounded by some packing- 
material, and heating them to redness for from four to six days. 
The packing-material is generally a decarbonizing agent such as 
iron oxide, though sand or clay will do, As a result of this 
process the carbon disappears from the surface of the castings, 
leaving a layer resembling steel and from about a sixteenth to a 
quarter of an inch thick, which covers the body of the castings, 
while the inner portion is softened to some extent. A malleable- 
iron casting, therefore, is tough; it will stand a heavy blow, and 
will bend before it will break. 
Malleable-iron castings find a wide use in the manufacture of 
farm machines, for such parts as the packers and needles of 
binders, the gears of binders and spreaders, and for innumerable 
other small parts which are subjected to great strains or sudden 
shocks. Malleable-iron castings are never large, but since they 
combine the advantages of cast iron (in that they can be molded 
to any desired shape) with the toughness and ductility of steel, 
they occupy an unusual place in the field of farm-machinery 
construction. Other things being equal, a considerable number 
of malleable-iron castings in a machine is an almost certain 
indication of superior quality. 
Wrought iron. Wrought iron is a very pure form of iron made 
by melting pig iron in the hearth of a furnace until, on the 
removal of a large percentage of the impurities, the mass becomes 
pasty. It is then worked up into a ball and is removed from the 
furnace and rolled into large bars. Wrought iron is remarkably 
tough and ductile and is the iron most commonly used by black- 
smiths for forging purposes. It is largely used in the manufacture 
of rolled rods and bars, pipes, pipe-fittings, etc. 
Steel. Steel is a form of iron which, in composition and 
properties, stands between cast iron and wrought iron. It is low 
in carbon content in comparison with cast iron, ranging from 
about 0.1 to 1.5 per cent of carbon. There are several kinds of 
steel, the kind depending upon the process by which it is made.
-P-A-G-E-35
  
MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION 23 
Bessemer steel is manufactured by charging molten pig iron 
into a large Bessemer converter and forcing blasts of air through 
the mass until the impurities are largely eliminated, the boiling 
temperature being maintained by the oxidation of the impurities. 
A recarburizer, chiefly ferromanganese, is then added to secure 
the proper carbon content and to assist in eliminating air bubbles 
from the boiling mass. The metal is then poured into large 
molds and carried to the rolling-mills, where the ingots are 
reduced to smaller blocks, or billets, preparatory to being rolled 
or shaped into commercial products. 
In the acid Bessemer process the converter is lined with 
sandstone, in which case the phosphorus of the pig iron remains 
in the steel. In the basic Bessemer process the converter is 
lined with limestone, in which case the phosphorus of the iron 
combines with the limestone, forming basic slag, which is used 
as a fertilizer. i 
Open-hearth steel is manufactured by melting a charge of 
pig iron and steel scrap on the hearth of an open-hearth fur- 
nace; a flame from the fire-box of the furnace is passed over 
the molten mass, being reflected back upon it by the arched 
roof above the hearth. The decarbonizing agent is added in 
the form of ferromanganese, as in the Bessemer process, either 
before pouring or as the metal is poured. Open-hearth steel, 
like Bessemer steel, may be made by either the basic or the 
acid process. 
In 1912 about 33 per cent of all the steel produced was 
made by the Bessemer process, while 66 per cent was made by 
the open-hearth process, the remaining 1 per cent being largely 
crucible steel. 
Soft-center steel. Soft-center steel is now rather generally used 
in the manufacture of steel plow bottoms and cultivator shovels. 
It is made by welding together three sheets of steel. The two 
outer layers are made of high-carbon steel and hence are ex- 
tremely hard. The inner layer is made of a softer grade of 
steel. The outer layers take a good polish and withstand the 
wearing action of the soil, while the inner softer layer seems to 
prevent the parts from breaking when subjected to sharp blows 
or sudden strains.

  24 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Babbitt metal. Babbitt metal is an alloy of tin, copper, and 
antimony, in the proportion of about 85 parts tin, 6 parts copper, 
and 9 parts antimony. This metal, which is used chiefly for 
bearings, is sufficiently hard to resist wear, and yet soft enough 
to be easily shaped to a bearing. Moreover it adjusts itself to 
the shaft and so gives a minimum of friction. 
Bronze. This metal is an alloy of copper and tin, containing 
about 80 per cent copper and 20 per cent tin. It is used as a 
bearing metal, and for stuffing-boxes, piston rings, cut gears, etc. 
Phosphor bronze is made from ordinary bronze by adding a small 
amount of phosphorus. This addition, which increases the tensile 
strength and produces a harder metal, makes phosphor bronze 
especially valuable for gears and bearings, for which use it excels 
almost any other class of bearing metals, since it offers great 
resistance to wear and has a low coefficient of friction.

CHAPTER IV 
CEMENT AND CONCRETE 
Concrete is now used in such a great variety of ways about 
the farm that everyone should study its possibilities and learn 
how to use this important and valuable building-material. Its 
successful use depends upon the care and judgment exercised in 
the choice and handling of the materials. Crumbling walks, 
broken posts, and leaking watering-troughs, too frequently seen, 
testify to the fact that great care and judgment are required. 
MATERIALS USED 
Cement. Cement is the foundation of all concrete work. There 
are two kinds to be found upon the market — natural cement 
and Portland cement. 
Natural cement is made from a rock containing varying quan- 
tities of lime and clay. The rock is first ground into fine particles 
and then burned. The resulting clinker is then reground into a 
very ‘fine powder known as natural cement. Inasmuch as the 
rocks from which natural cement is made vary greatly in their 
composition, the cement varies in its quality. Natural cement, 
although it begins its initial set more quickly than Portland 
cement, never attains the ultimate strength that the latter does. 
It is somewhat cheaper in first cost, but Portland cement should 
be given the preference for all kinds of concrete work. 
Portland cement takes its name from the Portland rocks near 
Leeds, England, from which it was first made, in 1829. In the 
United States it was first manufactured in 1870, at Copley, 
Pennsylvania. Its use has increased so rapidly that now the out- 
put amounts to about 100,000,000 bbl. per year. 
Portland cement is made from an artificial mixture of com- 
paratively pure limestone or chalk, and clay or shale, the active 
ingredients being lime, silica, and alumina. The raw materials 
25
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
are first mixed in the proper proportions and ground to a rather 
fine powder. The mixture is then fed into large rotary kilns 
and heated to an extremely high temperature, the powder par- 
tially fusing and forming clinkers. These clinkers are then 
ground into a very fine powder known as Portland cement. 
Inasmuch as the quality and chemical composition of the raw 
materials, as well as the proportions in which they are mixed, 
are accurately controlled, the resulting cement is of uniform 
composition, There are many brands of Portland cement, one 
differing but little from the others in general desirability. The 
consumer can and should judge of the physical condition of the 
brand or brands available. If the bags are exposed to dampness, 
the cement becomes lumpy. If the lumps are hard, the cement 
is practically worthless and should not be used. It will keep 
indefinitely if stored in a dry place. The bags should not be 
piled on or very near an earth floor. 
Sand. In all concrete work some coarse material, or aggre- 
gate, is used. A fence post made of pure cement and water 
would be very strong indeed, but its cost would be prohibitive. 
The aggregate is used solely to cheapen the cost of the object 
made. Sand is sometimes called the fine aggregate. That portion 
of the aggregate the particles of which are one-quarter inch in 
diameter or under is called sand. For good concrete work, sand 
must possess several characteristics. Jt must be clean; that is to 
say, it must be free from fine clay and from loam. Either of 
these impurities will completely cover the quartz grains of which 
sand is composed and prevent a proper bond, or union, between 
the cement and the sand grains. The presence of these impuri- 
ties in damaging quantities can be detected by a few simple tests : 
If a small quantity of the sand is picked up in the hand and 
then thrown away, fine particles will be seen clinging to the 
palm of the hand. If these particles are soft to the touch, and 
if the coating on the hand is rather thick, it may be suspected 
that clay is present in too large quantities. 
If this simple test discloses the presence of a considerable 
amount of clay or loam, a small quantity of the sand should then 
be thrown into a small glass jar filled with water. If the water 
remains very roily for a considerable time, it is likely that there
-P-A-G-E-39
CEMENT AND CONCRETE 27 
is too much clay in the sand to allow its being good aggregate 
material. If the jar is allowed to stand until the particles have 
completely settled, and if, when the water is poured off, the 
surface of the jar is found to be covered with clay, it may be 
concluded that the sand is not of the best and should not be used 
without being tested in an actual mixture. The test may be 
carried out by making a small block of the concrete and testing 
its strength after setting. 
The sand should be well graded from fine to medium-coarse © 
particles. A great deal of the sand usually available is too fine 
for the best work. A fine sand, as will be seen when the ques- 
tion of proportion is considered, requires more cement than a 
well-graded, or even a coarse, sand. With fine sand a little more 
cement than the proportion calls for should be used. 
It was formerly considered necessary that the sand grains 
should be sharp and angular, thus giving opportunity for a better 
bond between the cement and sand; this is no longer considered 
a necessity, however. If the sand particles are clean, the cement 
will form such a perfect bond with them that if a rupture occurs 
the particles will frequently break through the middle instead of 
cleaving from the cement. 
Coarse aggregate. Gravel is the most common coarse aggre- 
gate used in concrete construction on the farm. There is no 
better material if it is clean and properly graded. To be clean, 
it, like sand, must be free from clay, loam, or other foreign 
matter. Bank gravel frequently has a considerable amount of 
clay mixed with it. If this occurs in rather coarse and separate 
lumps, a small quantity will do no harm. If, however, the clay 
is very fine and covers and adheres to the pebbles or gravel, 
good concrete work is impossible. If such gravel must be used, 
it should be thoroughly washed by dashing water over it after 
spreading it out in a thin layer. 
The gravel should be well graded; that is, the pebbles should 
grade from fine to coarse. The size of the largest pebbles should 
be determined by the kind of work to be done. If the concrete 
is to be used for heavy foundations, rocks up to several inches in 
diameter may be used. If fence posts or other small reénforced 
objects are being made, the largest pebbles should not be more
-P-A-G-E-40
28 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
than three quarters of an inch in diameter ; if larger, they inter- 
fere with the placing of the reénforcing rods. 
Crushed limestone, where available, makes excellent coarse 
aggregate. It is usually clean and well graded and can be secured 
in almost any size desired. 
Cinders, brickbats, sandstones, and other similar materials may 
be used in unimportant work, but inasmuch as concrete is no 
stronger than the weakest material put into it, the use of such 
aggregate cannot be expected to result in good work. If such 
materials are to be had in large quantities, they mav be used to 
good advantage as a foundation for the concrete. 
PROPORTIONING THE MIXTURE 
Theory of proportions. In all concrete work it is desirable to 
secure the densest possible mixture. To do this in an ideal way, 
just enough sand must be taken to fill the voids, or air spaces, 
in the coarse aggregate and, in turn, just enough cement must 
be used to fill the voids in the sand. Such a proportion would, 
in theory, give a mixture free from air spaces and consequently 
as dense as the materials used in making it. 
Proportioning in practice. Obviously it is not possible in prac- 
tice to obtain a mixture in. accordance with the theory just 
outlined. It is very essential, however, that every effort be made 
to secure a mixture that will correspond as closely as possible to 
the theoretical. 
If the percentage of voids in the material used were known, 
it would be possible so to proportion the cement and aggregate 
as to approach very closely to the best possible mixture. A rough 
approximation may be secured by filling with water a bucket of 
known volume into which has been placed as much as possible 
of the material to be tested. Then the volume of water used, 
divided by the volume of the bucket, will give the percentage of 
voids in the material. This crude method will give a fair idea 
of how much sand to use with the coarse aggregate at hand or of 
how much cement to use with the sand in question. Such a test 
as this, if it does nothing more, enables one to see some reason 
for the proportions usually given for standard mixtures.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
CEMENT AND CONCRETE 29 
It is readily understood that, no matter how accurately the 
voids are determined, when the materials are actually mixed 
the theoretical conditions are changed, and the proportions so 
accurately determined no longer obtain. This is true because in 
mixing the sand and coarse aggregate, for example, the sand 
particles will not accurately fill the voids in the stone or gravel, 
but will tend to fit in between the larger pieces, separate them, 
and thus increase the space to be filled by sand. There is then 
only one correct method for determining the proper mixture to 
use, and that is to make up blocks of concrete, using different 
proportions of the materials. Then, after the blocks have been 
allowed to set for a period of from two to four weeks, that propor- 
tion which is best adapted to the work at hand may be determined 
by means of appropriate tests. 
Standard proportions. Long experience with concreting- 
materials and with such concrete work as is done about the farm 
has suggested several standard proportions. A standard propor- 
tion has reference to a certain mixture of cement, sand, and 
gravel that is deemed best for a particular kind of work. For 
example, a 1-2-3 mixture, that is, one in which the materials 
are mixed in the proportion of 1 part (by volume) of cement, 
2 parts of sand, and 3 parts of screened gravel or rock, is stand- 
ard for watering-troughs. That is to say, without going to the 
trouble of determining the best possible mixture for the material 
at hand, if this material is of average grade, it may be expected 
to make a good watering-trough if mixed in the above proportions. 
The following table of standard mixtures with the purposes to 
which each is best adapted will be found helpful in choosing the 
proper proportions for the work at hand : 
1. A 1-2-3 mixture. This represents a very rich mixture 
and is used where exceptional water-tightness is desired, for re- 
enforced beams carrying great weight, or where unusual stress is 
to be withstood. 
2. A I-2-4 mixture. This is a rich mixture and is commonly 
used for reénforced beams and columns, floors, walks, tanks, 
troughs, fence posts, etc. 
3. A 1-2!-5 mixture. This is a medium mixture and is used 
for ordinary floors, feeding-floors, retaining-walls, foundations, etc.
-P-A-G-E-42
  
30 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
4. A 1-3-6 mixture. This is a lean mixture and is used for 
subfoundations and heavy walls, where the concrete is placed in 
great masses, 
It will be noticed that in most of the standard mixtures the 
volume of cement used is one half that of the sand, and the sand 
one half that of the coarse aggregate. Such a proportion is based 
on the assumption that one half the volume of the coarse aggre- 
gate and sand is made up of voids. Though this corresponds very 
closely to the fact, the voids will frequently be found to compose 
much less than half of the volume of the aggregate. 
Proportioning cement and gravel. In most concrete work done 
on the farm, bank or creek gravel is used. This is commonly 
mixed with cement in such 
proportions as I-4, I-5, 1-6,         
    
    
        
              
         Ze : KC \ etc. These proportions are 
NZ all based upon the assump- 
\\ \\\ tion that the proper amount 
: \\ < . of sand is already to be 
  found in the gravel; hence 
the sand factor is simply 
eliminated from the standard 
proportions given above, and 
where unscreened gravel is 
used a I-4, a I-5, or a I-6 
Fic. 17. A good type of screen mixture corresponds respec- 
‘The wires are } in. apart tively to a I-2-4, a 1-2}-5, 
or a 1-3-6 mixture when 
the sand and coarse aggregate are separately provided. The idea 
frequently obtains that a 1-6 mixture where unscreened gravel is 
used is the same as a I-2—4 mixture in which the three materials 
are separate. That such an idea is erroneous will be seen when 
the question of the proper quantity of materials necessary for a 
given structure is discussed. 
Gravel seldom contains the proper amount of sand. Almost 
all bank and creek gravel contains too much sand, often from two 
to three times as much as the standard mixtures demand. Con- 
sequently, for the best results, the gravel should be screened by 
throwing it upon a No. 4 screen (Fig. 17), that is, one whose
-P-A-G-E-43
  CEMENT AND CONCRETE 31 
meshes are one-quarter inch in size. That part of the gravel 
which passes through is used as sand, and the remainder as the 
coarse aggregate. After the fine and the coarse aggregate are 
separated they may be remixed in the proper portion. When 
such a procedure is followed, it will usually be found that at least 
as much sand is left over as was used in the standard mixture. 
If it is not practicable to screen the gravel when more than 
the required amount of sand is present, it is well to use a little 
more cement than the amount indicated by the proportion it was 
intended to follow. This is necessary because in the final mixing 
it is the aim to have every particle of sand coated with cement. 
If extra sand is added to any one of the standard mixtures, it 
will be necessary to increase the quantity of cement used if the 
resulting work is to be of the quality reasonably to be expected 
from the mixture used. 
MeasurinG, Mrxinc, AND PLAcING THE MATERIALS 
No matter how good the materials used or how rich the mix- 
ture, if the materials are not properly mixed and placed, poor 
work is bound ‘to result. Too much attention cannot be given to 
this important step in the making of concrete. 
Quantity of materials required. It is necessary that one know 
how to determine the amount of the various materials that will 
be required to construct the object or complete the piece of work 
at hand. Such problems as the following, for example, are con- 
stantly presenting themselves to the farmer: If a floor 20 ft. 
wide by 30 ft. long and 4 in. thick is to be laid in a hog house, 
how much cement, sand, and screened gravel or crushed rock 
will be required to complete the job if a standard 1-2-5 mixture 
is to be used? 
If the sand and coarse aggregate are graded according to the 
assumption underlying the proportions given in all of the standard 
mixtures, the sand is intended exactly to fill the voids in the 
coarse aggregate, and the cement in turn is supposed to fill the 
voids in the sand. Under average conditions this will be very 
close to the fact, as previously explained. This could be very easily 
demonstrated by filling a box holding 5 cu. ft. with the coarse  
-P-A-G-E-44
32 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
aggregate and then pouring in 2} cu. ft. of sand. With a little 
shaking, the sand will disappear and fill the voids in the coarse 
material. If, now, 1 cu. ft. of cement is added, it too will disap- 
pear, since it fills the voids in the sand. Thus, 84 cu. ft. of 
materials have been poured into the box, with a total volume of 
slightly more than 5 cu. ft. resulting. The slight increase in 
volume represents the difference between theory and practice 
and should be taken into consideration when the quantity of the 
various materials required is determined. This increase is fairly 
constant, and, in order to allow for it, a good rule is to take as 
the volume of the coarse aggregate 0.9 of the total volume of the 
mold. The sand and cement will then be such portions of this 
volume as the mixture specifies. 
Thus, in the floor mentioned above, the total volume of the 
mold to be filled is equal to 
20 X 30x $= 200 cu. ft, 
0.9 of 200 = 180 cu. ft. 
Therefore there will be required 
180 cu. ft., or 6.66 cu. yd., of coarse aggregate, 
90 cu. ft., or 3.33 cu. yd., of sand, 
36 cu. ft., or 36 bags, of cement. 
Mixing the materials. If the materials are to be mixed by hand, 
a mixing-platform (Fig. 18) at least 12 ft. square should be pro- 
vided in case the work is 
216 "Edge on 2" Malched and not being done near a barn

is available. The platform 
should be practically water-

methods followed in regard 
to the order in which the materials are placed upon the platform, 
but the one generally accepted as the best will be given first.
-P-A-G-E-45
CEMENT AND CONCRETE 33 
Assuming that a 1-2-4 mixture is to be used, a bottomless 
box (Fig. 19) 2 ft. long, 1 ft.6 in. wide, and 8 in. deep, holding 
2 cu. ft., would make a convenient size for mixing. The box 
should be placed upon the mixing-platform and filled with sand. 
The sand should then be spread out, and one bag of cement 
poured over it. The sand and cement should then be turned 
with a shovel, the operator starting at one end of the pile and 
working systematically toward the other end, taking care that all 
parts of the pile are stirred. 
The shovel should be given 
a spreading motion as it is 
turned over. Two men can 
perform the work to the best 
advantage, and can best work 
directly opposite each other. 
Two or three turnings are FIG. 19. A measuring-box of convenient 
size and shape 
necessary to secure an even 
mixture. If gray streaks are to be seen after the shovel has been 
run over the surface of the pile, one more turning should be 
given. As a rule three turnings are required. 
The mixture should then be spread out and two boxfuls of 
coarse aggregate measured out upon the pile. The pile should 
then be turned at least twice. If the coarse aggregate is very 
dry, it is well to sprinkle it shortly before it is used. The 
materials should then be thrown together in a round pile, a good- 
sized crater formed, and water poured in. The edges should then 
be gradually spaded into the water, more water being added as 
needed. To secure the proper amount of water it is best to begin 
the final turnings while the mixture is rather dry, applying water 
by means of a sprinkling-pot while the material is being turned. 
The water should not be thrown upon the mixture with much 
force, as the cement will be washed from the sand or gravel 
and a faulty mixture will result. Two or three complete turn- 
ings are necessary after the water is added. This last mixing is 
important and should not be slighted. 
A wet, a medium, or a dry mixture may be used, the mixture 
depending upon the kind of work to be done. A wet mixture, 
which is made so thin that it will run from a shovel or pour readily 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
from a bucket, is used in making foundation walls where perfectly 
tight forms are provided. A medium mixture is that most com- 
monly used ; that is, one in which just enough water is used to 
give a mixture that will run slightly when piled up —a “ quaking 
mixture”’ so called. When placed in the forms it is usually 
tamped until water rises to the surface. This kind of a mixture 
finishes well both on the surface, as in a feeding-floor, and on 
the sides next the forms, as in a watering-trough. A dry mixture 
is used in making building-blocks, drain tile, and, frequently, fence 
posts —in short, when rather expensive molds are required, and 
when it is desirable to make one piece after another as fast as 
the mold can be filled and removed. The resulting work will be 
porous, will not harden properly, and will not attain the most 
desirable ultimate strength. 
As was said at the beginning of this chapter, Portland cement 
will begin to set within thirty minutes after the water is added. 
Consequently, the size of the batch should not be larger than 
can be used within thirty minutes. 
Instead of first mixing the cement and sand together and then 
adding the coarse aggregate, some follow the plan of first meas- 
uring out the coarse aggregate, next placing the sand on top of 
it and the cement on top of the sand, and finally mixing the 
three together at the same time. While this seems to result in 
first-class work, the first method, as a rule, is to be preferred, 
since it undoubtedly secures a more intimate mixture of the sand 
and the cement. Inasmuch as it is the object to coat each 
particle of sand with cement and in turn to cover each particle 
of the coarse aggregate with a layer of the mortar, the first 
method, it seems, would result in a more uniform mixture. 
Machine mixing. Mixing concrete by hand is extremely hard 
work, and if one has much to mix, it pays to engage a machine 
for the purpose. In almost every village in the country there 
is someone who is engaged in the business of laying cement 
walks and doing other kinds of concrete work. Such men can 
usually be hired by the day, and it will be found economical to 
engage them for such work as putting in foundations, laying 
floors, etc., if the material to be mixed exceeds, say, a volume 
of fifteen cubic yards.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
CEMENT AND CONCRETE 35 
There are some inexpensive but satisfactory hand and small 
? power mixing-machines now on the market, and if one con- 
templates doing much concrete work it will be advisable to 
investigate them and see 
whether the labor which 
it would be possible to 
save would not pay a 
good rate of interest on 
the investment. It is fre- 
quently possible to inter- 
est several neighbors in 
concrete work and buy a 
power mixer in partner- 
ship. Such a plan is espe- 
cially practicable if one 
of them already owns 
an engine which might 
be used for such work,  Fic.20. A good hand or power batch mixer

by hand or by power. Such a mixer costs about fifty dollars. 
  Forms FoR CONCRETE WorK 
It is essential that forms for such concrete work as watering- 
troughs, foundation walls for barns, etc. be rigidly braced. Con- 
crete of itself is very heavy, and in addition it is frequently 
tamped as it is being placed, so that the strain on the forms 
is great. If inch boards are used in such straight work as foun- 
dation walls, they should be supported by uprights every two or 
three feet. As shown in the illustrations, the outer and inner 
forms may be wired together for wall work, spacers being placed 
between the forms to maintain the proper thickness of wall. This 
method is particularly useful where it is convenient to brace 
but one of the forms. There are several different ways in which 
this bracing can be accomplished, one common method being 
shown in Fig. 21.
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Material. Material for the forms must vary with the kind of 
work. In rough work, as that for foundations, almost any kind of 
rough, unfinished lumber will do, provided it is strong enough. 
A few knot-holes are not objectionable, it being possible to fill 
many of them with clay. If, however, a smooth finish is desired, 
as in a watering-trough, good lumber must be chosen. It is not 
essential that it be dressed lumber, though a perfectly smooth 
wall cannot be secured otherwise. If the forms are to be used 
several times for the same work, more expensive material can be 
used. For watering-troughs it is advisable to use one-and-one-half- 
inch lumber. If the boards are matched it is all the better. 
For more particular work, where a good finish, inside and out, 
is desired and where the forms are to be removed while the 
concrete is still green, in order that the surface may be properly 
dressed, it is well to paint the forms with linseed oil just before 
erecting them. This not only keeps the form boards from ab- 
sorbing water from the concrete and thus interfering with the set- 
ting of the cement, but it also makes it easier to remove the 
forms, since cement will not stick to an oiled surface. 
Construction DETAILS 
It will be quite impossible in a work of this kind to give the 
details of construction for the scores of things which might be 
made of concrete. However, the average farmer’s activities in 
this direction are confined to relatively few lines of work, and 
these will be covered in some detail. A working familiarity 
with concrete, obtained through the making of the simpler 
objects, will suggest ways and means for the construction of 
more complex things. 
Foundations. In the construction of foundations for various 
farm buildings, concrete finds one of its best uses. The impor- 
tance of a good foundation, properly constructed, is too frequently 
overlooked. In most of the older farm buildings (and the same 
thing is true of many of the newer ones) good-sized stones were 
buried in the ground at the corners and the sills placed upon 
them. The siding was then carried down to the surface of the 
ground. In a few years the lower ends rotted off, presenting
-P-A-G-E-49
  CEMENT AND CONCRETE 37 
a very untidy appearance and perm 
to blow up under the barn floor. 
  
  
  
    
    Fic. 21. A method of supporting forms for 
a foundation wall 
Note the extra width of wall at the bottom 
  itting cold winds and rain 
If concrete is used for a 
foundation it is a very 
simple task to carry the 
wall above the surface of 
the ground, thus keeping 
out wind, rain, and snow 
and at the same time en- 
abling one to keep the sid- 
ing up where it will not 
be stained and rotted by 
spattering rains. 
A foundation should ex- 
tend below reasonable frost 
depth. This means that 
the trench should be about 
20 in. deep for small build- 
ings, though for large barns 
and silos it should be at 
least 2 ft. deep ; and if the 
soil is not firm at this 
depth, even 3 ft. is none too much. The base of the wall proper 
should be widened as shown in Fig. 
where the soil is not very firm 
this should be made at least 2 ft. 
wide. In general, for small build- 
ings, the foundation walls should 
be 6 in. thick; for large build- 
ings, from 8 to Io in. thick; and 
for silos made of concrete or clay 
blocks, from 14 to 18 in. thick, 
the thickness depending upon the 
height of the silo.

method of erecting and bracing

the outer form by wiring the two together, as shown in Fig. 22, 
and nailing stays across the top. ‘ 
The concrete should be mixed in the proportion of 1-24—5 
and made wet enough to pour well. As the forms are being 
filled that part of the wall which is to appear above the sur- 
face of the ground should be well “spaded”’; that is, as the 
concrete is being tamped a straight spade or even a thin board 
should be worked up and down between the forms and the con- 
crete. This forces all large pieces of the coarse aggregate back 
from the surface and allows the finer particles to form the face of 
the wall. A very smooth finish can be obtained in this way if the 
spading is thoroughly done. The forms should not be removed for 
at least one week, and the superstructure should not be started 
for from ten days or two weeks after the concrete is placed. 
If the wall is carried much more than one foot above the 
surface of the ground, it should be reénforced at the corners by 
No. 9 fencing-wire placed near its center. Two }-inch steel bars 
should be placed across the top of all windows in foundation 
walls. In very windy sections it is deemed advisable to embed 
long bolts, with the threaded end up, in the concrete before it 
sets. Holes are then bored in the sills and the superstructure 
thus anchored to the foundation. 
Walks. In the construction of walks the first step is to ex- 
cavate to a depth of from 12 to 18 in. and to tamp the bottom of 
the trench thoroughly if it is not already solid. The trench 
should then be filled to within 5 in. of the top with gravel or 
cinders, tamped into place as the filling proceeds. If the soil is 
not well drained naturally, it is well to lay a string of tile at the 
bottom of the trench, to prevent water from collecting beneath 
the walk. This precaution will in such cases prevent walks from 
heaving because of freezing. Ordinarily the tile will not be 
needed. 
Next, 2 x 5 pieces laid edgewise should be placed along the 
edge of the walk and held in place by stakes driven on either 
side, as shown in Fig. 23. If the walk is along the side of a 
building, the outer form strip should be lower than the one next 
to the building in order that water may not stand on the walk. 
A slope outward of } in. for each foot of width is sufficient.
-P-A-G-E-51
  CEMENT AND CONCRETE 30 
The outer edge of the walk should be well above the level of 
the ground. While it is not absolutely necessary, it is a good 
plan to place cross strips at intervals of from 4 to 6 ft., as shown 
in Fig. 24, marking their position on the outer form. These 
cross strips, which may be removed, as described later, divide the 
walk into blocks, and thus 
provide for expansion and 
for easy repair should a 
section prove faulty. 
The materials should be 
mixed in the proportion 
of 1-2}-5, or if bank-run 
gravel is used, 1-4. The 
mixture should be made medium wet and thoroughly tamped, the 
form finally being filled to within about one inch of the top. If 
the walk is not too long, the entire first coat can be laid before 
the surface coat is started. The latter should be laid, however, 
within three hours or so after the first course in order to secure 
a proper bond between the two courses. 
The crosspieces should now be taken out, and if tarred paper 
is at hand a strip should be put in, the crack being filled in with 
concrete. This very effectively prevents the adjacent slabs from 
bonding together and pro- 
vides for-expansion during 
extreme changes in tem- 
perature. If nothing of 
this kind is available, the 
cracks may be filled in 
with some of the first-

in getting it too wet. When it is placed, a straightedge should be 
run across the top to level it and give the surface the proper slope. 
If the work is not along a building, the straightedge — or the

where a slope is necessary, particular care should be taken that 
the forms are properly

Fence posts. The scarcity of timber for fence posts has served 
to direct the attention of farmers to concrete as a possible sub- 
stitute. As a result concrete posts have been made and used in 
large quantities during the last few years. Success with this 
material has been rather indifferent, however. Undoubtedly in 
the early history of the industry the posts were not properly re- 
enforced ; and, further, since many farmers who attempted to 
make their own posts were not sufficiently informed as to the

At the left is shown one way of preparing the reénforcing rods 
materials, mixing, etc., poor work frequently resulted. To make 
satisfactory posts, good materials, plenty of reénforcement, and a 
great deal of care are required. 
Forms. In Fig. 32 is shown a simple, easily made gang mold. 
This is constructed to make a post 4 by § in. at the bottom, 3 by 
4in, at the top, and 7 ft. long. The forms are made of 14-inch 
yellow pine, the end pieces being held in place by screen-door 
hooks, as shown in the figure. It is seen that the posts alter- 
nate bottom with top at each end of the form. It is desirable 
to place triangular strips having 1-inch faces in the bottom of 
each mold to cut off the sharp corners. It is not so convenient 
to do this at the top, though if the top is used as the face of 
the post, it is not so necessary that the corners be cut off.
-P-A-G-E-55
  
CEMENT AND CONCRETE 43 
Materials and proportions. Fence posts are usually made from 
a 1-2-4 mixture. A 1-2}—5 mixture is frequently recommended, 
but failures are likely to result, and the extra cost. of the richer 
mixture is very small when compared to the probable life of the 
finished post. If bank-run gravel is used, it should first be run 
over a #-inch screen to remove the large pebbles and then over 
a }-inch screen to separate the sand from the coarse aggregate. 
If crushed limestone is purchased for coarse aggregate, the grade 
known as “three-quarter” should be used ; that is, the grade in 
which no particles are larger than # in. in diameter. 
Reénforcement. A concrete post without reénforcing material 
is almost worthless. In fact the post is just about as strong as this 
material makes it, since the concrete itself will stand but a very 
small bending stress. 
The reénforcing rods or wires should be so distributed in the 
post that they will be put under a tensile stress when the post 
is subjected to a bending stress. This simply means, in the case 
of a rectangular post, that they be put as near the corners as 
possible, being not nearer than oné inch to the surface. Fig. 32 
shows one way of preparing the rods for placing in the mold. 
Various materials may be used for reénforcing posts. Ordi- 
nary No. 8 or No.9 fencing-wire is very good. Two No. 12 
fence wires twisted together make excellent material, for the 
twist does away with the danger of the concrete’s slipping on the 
wires. One-quarter-inch round iron rods, which in 7-foot lengths 
cost from about 1} cents to 2 cents apiece, make perhaps the 
best material that it is possible to secure. 
Mixing and placing. The materials should be mixed according 
to rules already given, a medium-wet mixture being best. After the 
forms have been thoroughly oiled, about 1 in. of concrete should 
be placed in the molds, leveled, and tamped. Two reénforcing 
wires should then be put in, about 1 in. from the sides, and the 
molds filled to within 1 in. of the top, the mixture being thoroughly 
tamped while it is being placed, or until water comes to the sur- 
face. The remaining rods should then be placed and the filling 
completed. The sides of the posts should be thoroughly spaded 
with a trowel or other tool to make them as smooth as possible, 
and a trowel should be used also to finish the surface of the posts.  
-P-A-G-E-56
  
44 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The forms may be removed on the second or third day if the 
work is carefully done, but the posts should not be disturbed for 
at least one week. If in a dry place, they should be sprinkled 
daily while curing. They should not be set for at least one 
month after being made. There is a tendency to move the 
posts within a few days after they have been made, because 
they seem to be thoroughly hard. This is a mistake, however, 
as the posts may be greatly injured by being handled too soon.

The mold may be easily taken down and used elsewhere 
End and corner posts. End and corner posts are usually made 
8 by 8 in. or 10 by 10 in. square. They may be made in molds 
and then set as line posts are, or they may be molded in place. 
The reénforcing of an end post is even more important than 
that of the line posts. At least ten wires or rods should be used, 
evenly distributed near the four sides. Gas-pipe, if less than 3 in. 
in diameter, placed in the center of the post does not constitute 
adequate reénforcing. 
Fig. 33 shows a form that has been used for molding end 
posts in place. The concrete brace is molded with the post. 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  CEMENT AND CONCRETE 45 
This is not essential, however, since the brace may be separately 
molded and then used as an ordinary timber brace; in this case 
a block should be nailed to the inside of the post form at the 
proper height to make a hole to take the end of the brace. The 
same thing should be done with the brace post. Other forms 
and other methods of bracing will suggest themselves as one 
becomes used to working with concrete. Gate hinges and gate 
latches may be set in the posts as they are being molded. 
Patent molds. There are a number of patent molds on the

the fence to the posts 
is that of wrapping a small soft-iron wire about the post and 
around the line wires, as shown in Fig. 34, A. This method, in 
the main, is satisfactory, though there is sometimes a tendency 
for the fastening wires to slip on the post. If, while the post is 
being molded, short three-eighths-inch greased rods are inserted in 
the concrete at the proper distances (the distance depending upon 
the spacing of the wires in the fence) and then removed after the 
post has hardened, one of the very best means for fastening the 
fence is provided. This method is illustrated in Fig. 34, B.

This works very satisfactorily, though it has been found that the 
parts harden with age so 
that it is difficult to drive 
staples into some of the 
posts.

Forms. Fig. 36 illustrates one way of constructing forms. 
The sides must be rigidly braced and the inner form thoroughly 
secured so that it cannot move as the concrete is placed. The 
walls should ordinarily be about 4 in. thick at the top and 6 in. 
thick at the bottom, the inner form being given the desired 
slope. When the proper slope is given, there is not much danger

Foundation. In most soils it is necessary to prepare a foun- 
dation by excavating a hole at least one foot in depth and some- 
what larger than the finished trough is to be. Gravel or cinders 
should then be filled in, sprinkled, and thoroughly tamped. If 
the soil is not well drained naturally, a string of tile should be 
laid beneath the filling. The outer form may then be set in place 
  
  
  Fic. 37. Showing a section of a well-made concrete watering-trough 
Note the method of emptying the trough 
and well braced, as shown in Fig. 36. The inlet pipe and the

For a very large trough, say 5 by 15 ft., it is best to dig a 
trench from 20 to 24 in. deep and 10 in. wide, under the sides 
of the trough (Fig. 37), in addition to the excavation above men- 
tioned. This trench may be filled to the bottom of the trough 
with a 1-3-5 mixture. This additional foundation is a safeguard 
against the cracking due to uneven settling. It is a good 
plan to lay a floor, or apron, some three feet wide around the 
trough, which prevents the mudhole so frequently seen about 
watering-troughs,

Reénforcing. The reénforcing rods or wires should now be 
prepared. If round steel rods are to be used, they should as 
the filling proceeds, be bent and placed as shown in Fig. 37. The 
rods are placed 1 ft. apart in both directions over the bottom, 
extending well up into the sides of the trough. The horizontal 
rods should be placed 6 in. apart, beginning about 2 in. above the 
level of the bottom of the trough. Woven-wire fencing, preferably 
of No. 9 wire, makes excellent reénforcing material for a trough. 
This should be cut and bent, 
as shown in Fig. 38. It is 
not a bad plan to double the 
reénforcing around corners. 
Mixing and placing. A 
I-2-3 proportion should be 
used and at least enough 
mixed at first to iay the 
bottom of the trough, the 
mixture being medium dry.

be put in and 4 in. more of concrete placed. This should be 
thoroughly tamped and the surface finished with a trowel. 
The inner form should next be put in place, the lower edge 
just touching the concrete. As shown in Fig. 36, this form must 
be held in place by cross ties and fastened so that it cannot be 
moved as the walls are filled in. Two or three inches of concrete 
should then be put in and the first horizontal rods placed. Filling 
should then proceed as rapidly as possible, the reénforcement hav- 
ing been placed as shown, and the sides tamped and spaded. With 
careful spading, the sides of the trough can be made very smooth. 
The inner form may be removed in two or three days, and 
while the concrete is still green the inner walls should be finished 
by the application of a thick wash of pure cement and water, 
with a whitewash brush. This fills all small holes, leaves a 
smooth surface, and adds to the water-tightness of the trough.

The outer forms should not be removed for several days, and in 
the meantime the trough should be protected from the hot sun 
and from drying winds. The trough should not be filled for two 
or three weeks at least. 
Cement drain tile. Cement tile are made in a special mold, 
from a mixture of cement and coarse, well-graded sand, in the 
proportion of 1-3. The mixture must of course be a dry mixture,

the mold is an important feature in their manufacture. It is 
doubtful whether a farmer is justified in attempting to make his 
own tile. Under ordinary drainage conditions cement tile have 
no advantage over hard-burned clay tile; in fact, the advantage 
is with the clay tile, since there is usually considerable breakage 
in handling cement tile. If one has good sand on the farm it 
may be profitable to attempt the manufacture of cement tile ; 
but ordinarily it is not to be recommended. 
Complex work. Such work as building reénforced driveways 
and reénforced beams, and constructing elevated tanks and towers, 
monolithic silos, etc., should not be undertaken without the advice 
of a competent engineer in regard to proper sizes and the amount 
and size of reénforcement required.

  CHAPTER: V: 
LAYING OUT THE FARM 
Laying out the farm includes the location of the buildings with 
reference to each other and to the fields, the division of the 
land into fields of the proper size, the location of the orchard, 
of the garden, of tile drains —in short, the proper setting of the 
entire plant. Quite naturally many of these questions will be 
determined by the topography of the land, and inasmuch as there 
are never two farms with identically the same surface contour, 
the question of laying out the farm must in its final analysis vary 
with each individual farm. There are certain principles, however, 
which apply to farms in general, and it is with these principles 
that this chapter is concerned. 
Usually the plan of the farm has already been fixed by pre- 
vious owners. The buildings have been located, the number and . 
size of the fields determined, the orchard planted, the permanent 
pasture well established ; and to change these matters is not the 
work of one or even five years, if a change is at all possible. It 
frequently happens, however, that changes for the better can be 
made without much inconvenience and without involving any 
great outlay of time or money, if the owner fixes in his mind a 
general scheme according to which he can develop his problem. 
He must have an ideal, in other words; and the task before 
him is to bring his farm arrangement as close to that ideal as all 
conditions will permit. 
Location of the buildings. Every farm should be regarded as 
a manufacturing establishment, in which the buildings represent 
' the central plant, and the fields branch houses where the raw 
materials are produced. The proper location of the buildings 
with respect to the fields and the highway is worthy of careful 
thought. With respect to the public highway, the buildings may 
be located close to or at some distance from it; the former 
5°
-P-A-G-E-63
LAYING OUT THE FARM 51 
location is understood to mean not less than one hundred nor 
more than three hundred feet from the road. 
If the chief concern is to develop a manufacturing plant to 
the highest degree of economy as measured in dollars and cents, 
a location near the center of the farm is without doubt the proper 
one. ‘In such a position all fields are accessible from the central 
plant, and little or no time is lost in going to and from the’ fields. 
The teams may, go directly from the barnyard into any one of 
several fields. (The crops are harvested and brought to the barns 
at a minimum expense of time and labor. The farmer is always 
near the barns in case the stock should need his attention during 
the day. Fig. 40, which is a plan of an actual plant in central Ohio, 
illustrates these points. It will be seen that four fields in this 
instance adjoin the barnyard, and stock from any one of these 
may have the run of the yards. On this farm, where the pasture 
is rotated in common with other crops and where the water is 
found in the barnyard and nowhere else, this is a matter of first 
importance. Again, there are no expensive lane fences to keep up, 
since the two fields. at the east end of the farm are never pastured. 
A location close to the highway sacrifices the merits of a cen- 
‘ tral position, but in the minds of many possesses advantages 
which more than offset its disadvantages. Such a location affords 
ready communication with the school, the church, and the town. 
Neighbors do not seem so far away; and friendly visits and 
roadside chats are all factors in a contented rural life. City folk 
who seek the country as a place to rest prefer a more secluded 
location, but the permanent country dweller chooses, and perhaps 
wisely, to locate his buildings near the highway. 
The house should if possible be set on a slight elevation, not 
merely for the better outlook which it is nearly always possible 
to secure, but for better drainage facilities, a feature so essential 
to the health of the family. It should seldom be closer than 
100 ft. to the highway, and 150 ft. or 200 ft. away is better. 
There should be an open expanse of lawn between house and 
road, with shrubs and vines tastefully decorating the border. The 
approach to the house should, if possible, be by a winding road 
and where convenient the road to the barns should not approach 
too closely to the house. 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The darns, as a rule, should be placed back of the house — 
never between the house and the road, and never on the side of 
the road opposite the house except for some unusual reasons. 
The main barn should be at least one hundred feet from the 
house and not much farther away, and in a direction opposite 
to that of the prevailing winds, which in the Central West would 
be north or east of the house. This direction is desirable in order 
that the odors from the barn and the stables may be carried away 
from the house, and that the danger to the house in case of fire 
at the barns, where fires seem most likely to occur, may be lessened. 
The barn should be on a site slightly lower than that of the 
house, although none of the buildings should be in a depression, 
or hollow, as such locations are damp and the soil is difficult to 
drain, The drainage of the barnyards should be carefully looked to. 
A little slope is desirable, though too much is likely to lead to loss 
of manure by leaching. A dry footing for animals in winter, how- 
ever, is of vastly more importance than the loss of a little manure 
if one or the other must be sacrificed, which is seldom the case. 
The various barns and outbuildings, including the main barn and 
the corncrib, implement-shed, hog-house, poultry-house, etc., should 
be grouped close together and placed each in such a position that 
it will serve best the purpose for which it is intended. In this 
matter the saving of time in choring should be kept constantly 
in view. The corncrib, for example, should be but a few steps 
from the main barn, and close to the hog-house. In Fig. 40 the 
corncrib is adjacent to the feeding-floor, where nearly all of 
the corn is fed, and at the same time, very close to the stable 
door. The second barn in Fig. 40 is in the back barnyard, and 
is used chiefly for the storage of rough feed which is fed in 
the yard. The poultry-house is frequently best located near the 
house, since the farmer’s wife usually takes care of the poultry, 
and house scraps may then be conveniently thrown to the chickens. 
It is very desirable to be able to confine the poultry, at least during 
certain seasons, to keep them out of barns and other buildings. 
The danger from fire is, of course, an objection to the close 
arrangement of buildings, and to avoid it many farmers are in- 
clined to locate their buildings several rods apart. That there is 
merit in the objection cannot be denied, but it would seem that

with insurance, which is inexpensive, together with reasonable 
fire protection, especially lightning-rods, the risk involved where 
buildings are closely grouped is small when compared with the 
total saving of time and labor through a lifetime. It might be 
mentioned, at this point, that small chemical fire-extinguishers 
which may be purchased for seven dollars and a half make a 
valuable addition to fire-protection equipment. 
Location and size of fields. The location and size of the fields 
will be determined chiefly by the topography, the shape, and the 
size of the farm. So far as topography is concerned, each farm 
represents an individual problem and must be dealt with accord- 
ingly. In the interest of tillage and of harvesting-operations an 
effort should be made to avoid having widely different soil types 
in the same field. Hills should, where possible, be so included in 
the various fields as to make field operations as easy as possible. 
This is particularly true of plowing, as it is essential that lands 
be so laid out that furrows may be turned downhill. A single 
hill had better be near the center of a field. Streams should 
be included in fields intended for pasture, and if two or more 
fields can be so laid out as to include a small portion of such 
a stream, a valuable source of water is easily provided. 
It is always advisable to have the entrance of as many of the 
fields as possible near the barn. Fig. 40 shows an admirable plan 
in this respect, the advantages of which have already been dis- 
cussed. Fig. 41 shows what is perhaps the nearest approach to 
the central-location plan. In this plan all fields are fairly close 
to the barn, and only a short lane is necessary. 
A long rectangular field, say two, three, or four times as long 
as it is wide, is much to be preferred to a square one. In such a 
field some of the field operations, such as cultivating the short 
way, are carried on at a disadvantage, but on the whole a great 
saving of time is effected. For example, in plowing, say, a 10-acre 
field laid out in the form of a square 40 rd. on each side, if 
a 14-inch furrow were cut, there would be required 282 rounds, 
necessitating 1128 turns. If the same area were in the form of 
a rectangle 20rd. by 80 rd., just one half as many turns, or 564, 
would be necessary, The distance traveled, neglecting turns, 
would be the same in either case, a little over 7 mi., but if only

one minute were allowed for each turn, one day would be saved 
in plowing the rectangular field. The saving of time is perhaps 
sufficient to overcome all other objections, 
On the other hand, the amount of fencing required is affected 
by the shape of the fields. The most economical shape for a field,

field mentioned requires 40 rd. more fence than the square one, 
which, at 75 cents per rod, would cost $30. If the fence lasts 
ten years, the annual cost, including interest at 6 per cent, would 
be $5.40, which amount would be easily saved in labor during 
one season. . 
Figs. 42 and 43 show one-hundred-acre farms, the one with 
the long side next to the road, the other with the short side 
adjoining the highway. In Fig. 42 the buildings are most ad- 
vantageously located in the middle of the long side. None of 
the fields is very far from the barns, and the shape of each is 
very desirable. In Fig. 43 the long lane is objectionable, but 
there is no other method if the buildings must be near the road. 
It very frequently happens that the scattering woodland is on 
the back end of the farm and the stock must have access to it. 
The cultivated fields could well be run the other way if the 
topography permitted. 
The size of the fields will be determined by the size of the 
farm and the type of farming practiced. The one-hundred-acre 
farm in Fig. 42 is conveniently divided for a four-year rotation, 
while in Fig. 43 a farm of the same size is divided for a three- 
year rotation. The fields should be of the same size so far as 
possible, though it is well to have a small field for odd crops, as 
for soiling purposes.

CHAPTER VI 
FARM FENCES 
One of the most serious questions that confronts the present- 
day farmer is that of what kind of fence to build. As an illus- 
tration of its magnitude, attention may be called to the fact that 
there are 272,000 farms in Ohio, according to the census of 
IgIO, averaging 88 A. each. According to figures compiled by 
the United States Department of Agriculture, Ohio farms of 
too A. or less require an average of 71rd. of fence per acre. 
This would mean 7oo rd. of fence per farm, which, at 75 cents 
per rod, would cost $525. For the state as a whole there would 
be required an investment of $142,800,000 to fence the farms 
at the average rate, an amount almost equal to the total value of 
the live stock as shown by the same census. In a consideration 
of fences the question divides itself into two parts — fence posts 
and fencing proper. 
Fence Posts 
By far the greater part of all farm fence is made of wire, and 
for this reason the selection of the proper post material is of 
much importance; in fact any fence using posts is just about 
what the posts make it. The choice of posts, so far as material 
is concerned, is confined to wood, steel, and concrete. 
Wood posts. Wood in the past has been, and will for some 
time continue to be, the most widely used post material. The 
kind of timber used depends upon local conditions. If oak or 
chestnut is abundant, posts of those timbers are likely to be the 
most common. In the corn-belt region nearly all post timber is 
shipped in, and the choice becomes largely a matter of cost per 
post and of probable durability, as frequently two or more timbers 
are represented in the local market. In an extended investigation 
of the fence problem, covering the states of the Middle West, the 
United States Department of Agriculture collected information

concerning the kinds of timber most commonly used for posts, 
their length of life, and the cost. Table I shows a summary of 
the results. The investigation was carried on in different areas, 
these areas being specified by number. Area No. 1 included 
Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan; No. 2, Wisconsin and Illinois; 
No. 3, Iowa, Missouri, southern Minnesota, eastern Kansas, and 
eastern Nebraska ; No. 4, northern Minnesota, the Dakotas, west- 
ern Kansas, and western Nebraska. The investigation, while not 
exhaustive, is thought to be a fair index of common practice.

The table shows that white cedar is the leading post timber 
of all the areas studied but one, and that it is estimated to have 
an average life of 14.3 years; white oak follows for the area as 
a whole, with an average life of 11.4 years. The next most 
common timber used is osage orange, which, with an average life 
of almost thirty years, stands at the top in regard to durability. 
Catalpa, which is being talked of a great deal as a promising post 
timber, has not as yet, according to this report, become widely 
used. Its lasting quality, 15.5 years, compares very favorably with 
that of other common timbers, 
As bearing upon the question of durability, the Ohio Agricul- 
tural Experiment Station! carried on a personal investigation of 
over 30,000 fence posts found in 292 different fences, and in 
its findings rated the timbers encountered in the order of their 
durability as follows: osage orange, locust, red cedar, mulberry, 
white cedar, catalpa, chestnut, oak, and black ash. As regards 
the first four kinds of timber, the two investigations agree, 
while in the others there is but a slight difference in the ratings 
given. 
It will be noticed that so far as cost is concerned there is 
a wide variation in the different areas, largely due to the presence 
or absence of the timber as a local product. Red cedar heads 
the list with an average cost, for the whole area, of 29 cents 
per post; white cedar and white oak, the two most common 
timbers, being rated at 18 cents and 12 cents respectively. 
In the Ohio bulletin are found some general conclusions based 
on the results of the investigation, which are interesting. 
1. There is no difference which end of the post is put in the ground 
except that the larger end should have preference. 
2. From data collected so far, seasoning does not seem to have any 
marked effect on durability. It is hoped that the matter will be investigated 
further. 
3. Timber that grows rapidly in the open is not so good as the same 
variety that grows in the woods. 
4. There is some evidence that it is not a good time to cut posts just as 
the tree begins to grow in early spring. 
5. The wood at the center of the tree is not so good as that just inside 
the sap wood.

Preservative treatment. The rapidly increasing cost of the 
more durable woods for fence posts has led to the investigation 
of certain treatments designed to prolong the life of the cheaper 
woods when used for posts. Some of these are feasible and 
worthy of consideration, while others are worth but little. 
Rotting is caused by the growth of fungi, or low forms of plant 
life which feed upon the tissues of the wood. The fungi require 
heat, light, moisture, and food for their development. These 
requisites are all supplied near the surface of the ground, and 
hence posts rot off at this point. A post rots but little beneath the 
surface of the ground, because the lack of air prevents the growth 
of fungi, while aboveground the lack of moisture prevents their 
growth. It is not possible to control the moisture, the heat, nor 
the air supply, but if the food supply can be controlled the fungi 
cannot develop. The most feasible method of destroying the food 
supply is to impregnate the wood with creosote, a coal-tar product. 
This method is best carried out by heating the creosote in a 
large kettle and setting well-seasoned posts into it, leaving them 
there for an hour or so, They are then removed and set into a 
kettle of cold creosote and left for several hours, during which 
time the liquid soaks into the posts to a considerable depth, 
the depth depending upon the nature of the wood. The hot 
bath is of itself fairly effective, but the cold bath following is 
essential to a thorough impregnation. This method, to be suc- 
cessfully carried on, requires an equipment specially arranged for 
the purpose. Painting the lower portions of the posts with hot 
creosote will probably prolong the life of the post long enough 
to pay for the treatment. The estimated cost of treatment is 
about 15 cents per post; and when the cheaper timbers are used 
it may reasonably be expected that the life of the post will be 
doubled or even trebled. It probably will not pay to treat the 
better classes of hardwood posts, since the denseness of the wood 
prevents the absorption of the creosote in beneficial quantities. 
Charring the post is a very effective method of preventing 
decay. That portion of the post which is to go into the ground 
is placed in a bed of hot coals and left until thoroughly charred. 
This process destroys the food supply of the fungi and prevents 
their getting a start, 
   
-P-A-G-E-75
  FARM FENCES 63 
Painting the lower portion of the post with an oil paint is 
effective as long as the paint lasts, but it soon scales off. The 
beneficial effects are probably not worth the time and trouble 
taken to apply the paint. 
Zinc chloride has sometimes been recommended as a preserv- 
ative. It is usually applied by boring holes in the posts and 
filling the holes with the solution, which is slowly absorbed by 
the wood. Zinc chloride is easily soluble, and as a consequence 
the solution next the surface of the post soon loses its effective- 
ness. This method is used but little if at all. 
Steel posts. Steel posts are now being widely used in many 
sections of the country. They are generally so made that they 
may be driven, thus materially decreasing the labor cost of the 
fence, a fact which makes a strong appeal to the farmer. 
Furthermore, they do not heave so badly as wood or concrete 
posts. A steel post, too, forms a ground connection for the wire 
fence, thus lessening the danger to stock from lightning. 
It is impossible to say which form of steel post is best. The 
heavy angular post made of soft steel has not proved satisfactory, 
since it is too easily bent by stock crowding against the fence, and 
once bent, even though straightened, it never possesses its former 
strength. Moreover such posts frequently rust off in five years’ 
time. The galvanized-iron posts, either round or irregular in 
shape, are so easily bent as to make one hesitate to use them. The 
lighter forms of high-carbon steel posts are meeting with consider- 
able favor. They have the decided advantage of springing back 
into place’ when bent out of shape, though they are not easily bent. 
The lasting quality of steel posts seems to be somewhat variable. 
They have been known to last for fifteen or twenty years, while, 
as above mentioned, they may rust off, or be broken off because 
of rusting, in a few years. Manufacturers have evidently not yet 
discovered the best material for fence posts, though the posts of 
the future must be largely made of steel in some form. 
Concrete posts. A discussion of the making of concrete fence 
posts will be found in the chapter on concrete. It need only be 
said, at this time, that though the durability of concrete recom- 
mends it as a post material, unusual care and the best of 
materials and reénforcement are necessary if a good post is
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
secured. Numerous failures have resulted when farmers have 
attempted to make their own posts, largely because of a lack of 
attention to one or more of the above requisites. Beyond a 
doubt concrete posts will find a wide use in the future, and 
where good materials are available at moderate prices it may 
pay to make the posts on the farm, utilizing labor at spare times. 
  
  
  
  Fic. 44. Several methods of bracing end posts 
At A is shown the most common method, though it is not so satisfactory as the method 
shown at C, The brace shown at B is frequently used if the wire is not in the way. Excel- 
lent braces are shown at D and Z; G shows a commendable patent brace for steel posts 
The cement post is not cheap in first cost, as many are led 
to believe. The cement alone, in a well-made post, will cost 
from 8 to 10 cents, and the reénforcing rods from 5 to 10 
cents —the amount depending upon the material used; so that 
even if the sand, gravel, and labor are thrown in, the total cost 
will be from 15 to 20 cents per post. There is no intention in 
this discussion to discourage the use of concrete posts, but the 
idea that they can be hurriedly and cheaply made is a mistaken 
one —a fact which should be now widely known,  
-P-A-G-E-77

Setting the posts. End posts, of whatever kind, must be of 
good size and thoroughly anchored and braced. It is utterly 
useless to hang a good fence on small end posts poorly set. 
Fig. 44 shows several common methods for bracing end posts. 
These posts may well be of concrete or heavy-steel construction, 
even though wooden line posts are most frequently used. If steel 
posts are used, they should be set in liberal portions of concrete, 
though some of the manufacturers of spring-steel posts do not so 
recommend. Wood posts have been set in concrete with varying 
  Fic. 45. Neat and substantial corner-post construction 
Note that the braces are horizontal; they could well have been placed a little higher 
degrees of success. There is a tendency for the post to swell 
and rupture the concrete, and water seeping down the sides 
of the post causes decay to set in. It is doubtful whether the 
concrete prolongs the life of the post, though it undoubtedly 
secures a more substantial setting. 
End posts are required at least every 40 or 50 rd. Line posts 
should not be set more than 20 ft. apart, and it probably pays 
to put them not more than 1 rod apart. Though the cost for 
post material is of course more if the distance between posts is 
short, the stock will usually not bear down the fence so badly, a 
circumstance which effects a saving that more than offsets the 
added expense for posts.

FENCING 
While almost every conceivable kind of fence can be found in 
any section of the country, there are only three materials of 
wide importance; namely, wire, wood, and hedge. Wire fences 
consist chiefly of some form of woven wire or barbed wire. 
Wood fences may be of the worm rail or the post-and-rail type, 
or of boards or pickets. Hedge fence may be entirely of hedge 
or of hedge and woven wire. Table II shows the distribution of 
the leading types of fence in the areas shown, as taken from Bul- 
letin No. 321 of the United States Department of Agriculture. 
A woven-wire fence over forty-two inches high is classed as a 
high fence ; one under forty-two inches, as a low fence.

The table shows that woven wire is the most common type 
of fence in the Middle West. Ohio shows 27.9 per cent of 
wooden fences, while barbed wire finds its greatest use in the 
range sections,
-P-A-G-E-79
  FARM FENCES 67 
Although there is a wide variation in the size of wire used in 
woven-wire fences, the modern tendency is to use a fence made 
of No. 9 wires throughout. This makes a more expensive fence 
and one that is harder to erect, but the increased length of life 
more than offsets the difference. The use of stay wires so small 
as No. 12 or No. 14 is to be discouraged. 
The rapid rusting of modern fencing-wire is a phenomenon 
observed by all users of woven-wire fence. Scientists have long 
been searching for the cause of this rapid rusting, but as yet 
. no satisfactory explanation has been offered, though there seems 
to be some evidence which tends to attribute the difficulty to 
the modern method of making the steel from which the wire is 
manufactured, Years ago nearly all the steel used in making 
fencing-wire was manufactured by the puddled-iron process, in 
which the metal was carefully and thoroughly worked by hand. 
However, it was only after the introduction of the Bessemer and 
open-hearth processes for the manufacture of steel that woven- 
wire fencing came into prominent use, and it did so largely 
because these processes made possible cheaper steel. 
After the steel is taken from the Bessemer converter or from 
the open-hearth furnace, it is poured into large molds, forming 
ingots of solid steel. It is then carried to the rolling-mills 
and reduced by constant rolling to a size approaching that of a 
lead pencil; finally it is drawn through a die and formed into a 
round wire of a size equal to No. § or No. 6. After it has been 
properly heated and tempered, this stock is drawn cold through 
appropriate dies and gradually reduced to wires of the desired size. 
To galvanize steel fence wire is to coat it with a layer of zinc. 
The wire to be galvanized is first drawn through an oven, in 
which it is properly annealed. On leaving this oven it is taken 
into a tank of weak acid to clean it properly, and to provide a 
soldering-solution. It is then drawn through a tank of molten 
zinc, and a portion of the material clings to the wire. On emerg- 
ing from the tank the wire is drawn through asbestos wipers to 
secure a uniform coating. Undoubtedly the thickness of the zinc 
coating is a factor in the lasting quality of the wire. 
In spite of .the zinc coating, however, the wire rusts, and 
investigations carried on by the United States Department of  
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Agriculture in 1905 and reported in Bulletin No. 239 seem to 
indicate that the element manganese, which is added to the steel 
just before it is poured from the furnace, whether it is made by 
the Bessemer or by the open-hearth process, is at the bottom of 
the trouble. When a wire rusts it pits, and the explanation, as 
frequently given, is that the pitting is due to electrolytic action 
set up because of the unequal distribution of manganese in the 
wire. It seems that this explanation is not yet regarded as an 
established fact. 
It is generally claimed by manufacturers that wire made from 
open-hearth steel is superior to that made from Bessemer steel. 
This statement cannot be made with absolute certainty, however, 
though evidence seems to point to such a conclusion, Neverthe- 
less the fact remains that modern fence wire does rust out rapidly, 
though it is believed that manufacturers are doing everything in 
their power to improve the quality of their product. The farmers’ 
chief protection lies in buying a fence made of nothing smaller 
than No. 9 wires, and even larger sizes may be advisable. 
The height of woven-wire fence varies considerably. What is 
known to the trade as a 10-47 fence, that is, a fence having 
10 wires and measuring 47 in. in height, is the most common 
type in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. A fence of this height, if 
intended for horses, is not complete without a barbed wire on 
top. The low fence, with 2 or more barbed wires, is most com- 
mon in Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Illinois. This makes a 
good cattle fence, but where it is used to fence in horses it is 
somewhat more dangerous than the 47-inch fence with but one 
barbed wire on top. 
Barbed wire should be used with the utmost care. The practice 
of placing it on old fences, and, especially, near the ground, when 
horses are to be pastured or inclosed, cannot be too severely con- 
demned. Horses maimed and ruined for sale if not for service 
are to be found in every community where barbed wire is used. 
It has, to be sure, a real place on top of a well-constructed fence 
42 or 47 in. high, but if it is placed lower than this there is an 
element of danger that is likely to result in serious accidents. 
Homemade woven-wire fences are constructed in a variety of 
ways by machines especially designed for the purpose. Good

fence. When erecting 
the fence, one should re- 
member that it is to be 
in place for a number of 
years, and that the degree 
of tightness will deter- 
mine in no small measure 
the length of life of the 
fence. In view of this 
fact every effort should 
be made to secure it prop- 
erly at both ends after 
stretching it as: tightly as 
possible.

and the bottom of the clamp-bar, each chain 
being controlled by a separate windlass. This 
makes it possible to keep the fence plumb, a 
thing which is not possible where there is but 
one windlass, The clamp-bar should be so 
placed that it will stand about three feet from 
the end post when the fence is finally stretched. 
The fence should then be cut off and the wires 
tightened by means of an individual wire- 
stretcher as each is stapled to the post. The 
wires should be bent around the post and 
wrapped around themselves, as the staples are

by twisting about themselves. This is a rather difficult task, but 
it may be accomplished in such a way (Fig. 48) that there is but 
little slack in the fence after it is released. 
One should never lose sight of the fact that the wire fence is 
put up to last for at least ten years, and in the majority of cases for 
fifteen years, and no 
effort should be spared 
to secure a’ first-class 
job. The need of first-

Wood fences are used as general farm fences only in those 
regions where timber is plentiful. The old-fashioned worm rail 
fence is rapidly disappearing. This type of fence has served an 
excellent purpose, but in comparison with the woven-wire fence it 
has but few things to 
recommend it. It oc- 
cupies too much space 
on the ground, it har- 
bors weeds, trash, and 
insects, it blows down 
frequently, and it is 
easily pushed over by 
horses; these disad- 
vantages are sufficient Fic. 49. A woven-wire fence on concrete posts

only occasionally seen, Picket fences, although used for yard pur- 
poses, do not play an important part in the fencing of fields. Such 
fences are erected by nailing pickets to wood rails or by weaving

the pickets into horizontal wires usually arranged in three pairs at 
the top, bottom, and middle of the pickets. A neat and substantial 
yard or garden fence may be made by bolting wood rails to steel 
posts set in concrete and nailing the pickets on. If pine pickets 
are used, it is a good plan to paint them before they are put on.

Substantial, properly hung, well-painted gates add much to the appearance of a farm 
cared for, hedge makes a very desirable fence. A common way 
of making hedge fences is to set the plants 8 in. apart where 
the hedge is to be and, after they have grown to a height of about 
3 ft. (which generally means a growth of two years), to erect 
a 24-inch or 30-inch fence on short posts driven in the line of 
the fence. Two smooth wires may then be stretched on the 
opposite side of the hedge row for the purpose of holding the 
plants erect and close to the wire fence. The hedge should then
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
be kept trimmed to a height of 4 ft. and the width should not 
exceed 10 or 12in. Such a fence may be kept in proper shape 
by trimming twice each year. If a hedge fence is permitted to 
grow to a height of several feet, it shades the land, draws heavily 
on the soil for food and water, and usually stands for poor farming 
and faulty management. If it is properly cared for, however, none 
of these objections can 
be urged against it.

rary, fences are fre-

the field is used at one time, a twenty-four-inch wire fence may 
be tied to hills of corn, where it will stand until moved to another 
position. With a few well-made stakes, a narrow wire fence may 
be made to serve many purposes as a temporary fence, Fig. 51 
shows a common method of constructing movable panels.

CHAPTER VII 
FARM BUILDINGS 
A work on farm equipment is scarcely complete without some 
reference to farm buildings, but the subject covers su wide a field 
that it can be given only the briefest consideration in this text. 
Plans of those farm buildings which are of interest to the general 
farmer are presented, with the idea that in this way details of 
plan and construction can best be presented. 
H0G-HOUSES 
The individual cot. Figs. 52, 53, and 54 illustrate one method 
of constructing the individual type of hog-house. This type of 
house is in great favor among 
many swine-breeders and_ is 
recommended for a number of Forinacin 
reasons. It is possible to isolate 
the sow at farrowing-time and 
for some time thereafter from 
the remainder of the herd. The 
cots may be moved about and 
placed in pastures or other de- 
sirable places. The sows and 
pigs are forced to take a cer- 
tain amount of exercise in going 
to and from their feed, since 
the cots are usually at some 
distance from the feeding-place. From the standpoint of sanita- 
tion the individual cot offers an unusual advantage. The hogs 
are not permitted to bunch together, and since it is frequently 
moved, there is less likelihood of contamination than where the 
location is fixed for all time, as in the colony house. The chief 
objection to this type of house is that the herd is usually very

much scattered, a condition which makes necessary the expendi- 
ture of much time in feeding and in other required attention. 
The cot is usually built on runners and may or may not 
be provided with a floor, though for use at all seasons of the 
year a floor is very 
ee ea much to be desired.

not be provided. In

door. It keeps out cold

The colony house. There are very many designs which may be 
used for the colony type of hog-house. Fig. 56 shows a standard 
plan. The colony house is in great favor because it centralizes 
the herd and greatly lessens the time required to feed and care 
for the hogs. Further, it is 
possible to warm the house at 
farrowing-time if desirable. 
Provision may be made, too, 
for storing feed in the house 
so that all operations are car- 
ried on under one roof. Good 
construction and a great deal 
of care and attention are re- 
quired to keep such a house 
clean and free from disease ; 
but this is quite possible un- Fic. 54. Perspective of the A-frame

The gens in this plan are 8 x 8, though many consider a 6 x 8 
pen amply large for a sowand her litter. The partitions may be con- 
structed so as to be readily removed, thus making it possible to use 
the entire house, if necessary, as a feeding-floor for fattening hogs.     ae

“The floors for hog-houses are now rather generally made of 
concrete. Such a floor is very easily cleaned and never wears 
out. Inasmuch as it is somewhat cold and damp for sows at 
farrowing-time, a wood mat should be provided in one corner of 
the pen, as a nesting-place. This mat may be hinged to the wall 
so that it may be turned up out of the way when not needed.

The end elevation (Fig. 56) shows the half-monitor roof-con- 
struction. Since it is highly desirable to have as much sunlight 
as possible in every pen, this type of construction is especially to 
be recommended. With such a house facing the south, sunlight 
strikes all of the pens for a considerable portion of the day. The 
height of the windows is determined by the latitude in which the 
house is built.

A great many farmers prefer a two-story house with ample 
room above for the storage of feed, baled straw, etc. With a 
liberal area of windows there is no objection to this construction, 
and it is very convenient and economical. 
THE GENERAL BARN 
The general barn as it is found on the average farm has 
been built with but little thought given to the interior plan. The 
usual procedure has been to erect the barn and then to make the

best of the inside arrangement, although just the opposite plan 
is the more logical one to follow. The general barn usually pro- 
vides room for the horses and for the milk-cows, with box stalls 
for calves, colts, brood mares, etc. 
Figs. 57, 58, and 59 are presented as a type of the general 
barn more for the purpose of showing certain principles of ar- 
rangement and construction than of presenting an ideal design. 
The interior arrangement (Fig. 57) could be changed to that of a 
dairy barn or that of a horse barn, or the space allotted to horses 
and cows may be divided in any suitable manner.

The framing details shown in Figs. 58 and 59 are of the 
plank-frame type, as opposed to pin-frame construction, so com- 
mon, particularly in older barns. This type of construction is 
comparatively new, and consequently has not as yet come into 
extended use. It has, how- 
ever, so many advantages 
over the pin-frame type that 
it will undoubtedly be the 
barn of the future. In its 
construction all beams, posts, 
etc., are built up from two- 
inch plank. Some of its ad- 
vantages are the following:

the second floor is not cut up

Type 4 has straight sides and a plank floor. Type Z has flaring sides and a concrete floor

lumber required ; (3) there is a great saving in the time and labor 
required ; (4) timber can be used that would probably find no place 
in a pin frame; (5) the self-supporting roof is used to advantage. 
The chief objection to this type of construction is that the sides 
are not securely tied together and that the ends are not sufficiently 
supported against the inward pressure, a condition which results 
 
-P-A-G-E-93

in bulging sides. This, no doubt, has been true in many barns of 
this type where a sufficiently strong truss was not used for the 
roof. With care in this regard, there is little danger from spreading. 
The barn may be built with or without a basement structure. 
In sections where the bank barn is possible, the basement plan is 
perhaps to be advised. Sometimes, however, in level sections an 
elevated driveway is built up and the basement structure provided. 
One or two driveways may be included, the number depending 
upon the length of the barn. The gambrel roof shown is well 
adapted to this type of 
construction and increases 
the mow room materially.

Fig. 61 shows a simple and inexpensive plan for an implement-

example, the height of the posts cqn be increased so as to provide 
a limited amount of storage above. One bent may be made 
higher than the rest, for housing machinery that will not enter 
a ten-foot door, or one bent may be constructed so as to be 
used for manure storage.

raisers. The floor plan (Fig. 64) pro- 
vides ample roosting space. The 
perches are spaced 15 in. apart, and 
an allowance of about 8 in. of perch 
room is made for each fowl. The 
dropping-board is hinged to the wall

be placed in either end of the house or under the dropping-board. 
In the front elevation (Fig. 66) the size and location of windows

readily pass out through the windows. The tops of the windows 
should be about 6 ft. from the floor for a house of this width, in 
order that the sun may shine into the back part of the pen. 
They should also extend nearly to the floor, for a similar reason. 
The muslin-covered sash permits the passage of air for purposes 
of ventilation without draft, which is an essential feature, and, 
when open, provides for free circulation of air in warm weather.

Fic. 64. Floor plan for a one-hundred-fowl poultry-house 
The floor and foundation of the house should be made of 
concrete. Earth makes a fairly satisfactory floor, but is usually 
damp at certain seasons of the year, and it cannot be kept clean. 
A concrete floor is easily cleaned, is dry, and, if kept covered 
with litter, is sufficiently warm. 
If a layer of tarred roofing-paper is placed in the floor about 
two inches from the bottom while the concrete is being placed, 
it will aid in keeping the floor warm and dry. Its function is to 
prevent the passage of moisture up through the concrete and 
thus to prevent evaporation from the surface of the floor, which 
in itself is a cooling process. Though, even with this precaution, 
the concrete floor is rather cold, its evident advantages greatly 
outweigh this one disadvantage. -

SILos 
Storing feed in a silo has beyond question demonstrated itself 
to be an economical and satisfactory method, and anyone who 
keeps ten or more head of cattle should seriously consider the 
advisability of purchasing a silo. The chief questions which 
face a prospective purchaser relate to the kind and size of silo 
best suited to his conditions. There are so many types of silos 
on the market that it becomes a difficult question to determine 
which kind to buy. 
What constitutes a good silo? The purpose of a silo is to pre- 
serve the green food placed in it. To do this the walls must be 
tight enough to keep out air and to retain the moisture, and 
they must be strong enough to withstand the pressure from 
within. Further, they must be smooth so that the ensilage will 
settle evenly around the edges. Any material which meets these 
requisites will keep ensilage. In addition to these chief essentials, 
a silo should be reasonably permanent and durable. 
Kinds of silos. The stave silo is by far the most common silo 
in use. If properly constructed it will keep ensilage as well as 
any other type, or possibly better than others, and if properly 
cared for it will last for from ten to twenty years. The best of 
staves should be purchased. The joints should be leaded when 
the silo is put up, and when finished it should be painted on 
the inside with creosote or some other wood preservative and 
on the outside with a good oil paint. If the hoops are kept tight 
in the summer and if the silo is anchored to a good foundation, 
satisfactory service will result from its use. This.type of silo is 
quickly and easily erected and may, if occasion demands, be taken 
down and erected elsewhere, though not without considerable 
damage. The stave silo sometimes blows down and twists out of 
shape, but such things do not happen often if proper precautions 
are taken. 
The wooden-hoop silo is only a modification of the stave silo, 
wooden hoops being used in place of the iron ones, and the 
staves nailed to them. There is no way of tightening such hoops, 
but they should expand and contract with the staves, so that 
adjustment is not so necessary. A well-constructed wooden-hoop 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
silo is a good investment, but this type has been so cheaply put up 
and so unsatisfactory in many cases that it is not in good favor. 
The monolithic concrete silo has been constructed with success 
and used with satisfaction in large numbers. When made of good 
materials, with a four-inch to six-inch wall, and well reénforced, 
it will serve its purpose well. The concrete must be rich in 
cement (a I-2-4 mixture is none too good), to prevent the ab- 
sorption of juices by the walls. If the inner surface is painted 
with asphalt paint or a similar preparation, absorption is reduced 
toa minimum. The objection is frequently raised against a con- 
crete silo that the juices of the silage soften the concrete. Ex- 
perience seems to show that there is little foundation for such a 
statement. The concrete silo costs a little more than the stave 
silo, but its longer life more than makes up for the extra cost. 
Of course there is always danger that the silo will crack because 
of poor construction in walls or foundation, and if the cracking 
is severe the loss is great. This one thing militates against the 
wider use of this type of silo. Another objection is that expen- 
sive forms are required, and the labor cost of erecting it is heavy. 
The cement-block silo is now used quite extensively. The ease 
with which it is erected, when compared to the monolithic type, 
recommends it. The blocks must be made with extreme care. 
Too frequently the blocks are made with a mixture so dry that 
it is impossible to procure an impervious block. When the silo 
is plastered on the inside with a thick coating of cement, it is 
made sufficiently impervious, but this must be carefully done to 
secure a lasting job. The silo must, of course, be well reénforced, 
this being accomplished by laying reénforcing wires in the mortar 
joints. The success of this silo depends upon the quality of 
the blocks used and the manner of erection. Many are giving 
unqualified success. 
The vitrified-clay-block silo is growing in favor every year. 
Vitrified clay blocks represent a material that is almost ideal for 
the construction of silos. They are impervious to moisture and 
air and are strong, smooth, and durable. They furnish a hollow 
wall that has some advantages in freezing weather, and they are 
easily built into a silo, with a minimum requirement of time and 
labor. When laid with good cement mortar and well reénforced,
-P-A-G-E-101

they make a silo that is sure to keep the ensilage well and that 
is practically indestructible. 
Relative cost of silos. The following statement as to the rela- 
tive cost of different types of silos represents average costs as 
collected from a large number of Ohio farmers, the figures rep- 
resenting cost per ton capacity of the silo: wood-stave, $2.75 ; 
homemade wooden-hoop, $1.70; monolithic-concrete, $3.93; 
concrete-block, $4.20; vitrified-tile, $4.75; metal, $4. 
The size of the silo. The question of the size of the silo is a 
very important one for the farmer, and of course has to do with 
the diameter and the height. The diameter will be determined 
by the number of cattle to be fed, while the height will be de- 
termined largely by the number of days the herd will be fed from 
the silo. It is necessary to feed from 1} in. to 2 in. in depth 
from a silo each day to prevent molding. Hence the proper 
diameter can be determined by figuring the quantity of ensilage 
in pounds to be used daily; then by reducing the quantity to 
cubic feet a diameter can be determined that will cause at least 
the minimum amount to be used from the silo each day. The 
average weight of a cubic foot of ensilage is taken as 40 lb. 
The following table gives the amount of ensilage ordinarily 
consumed by live stock.

As an illustration of the method used to determine the proper 
diameter of a silo, let it be assumed that 15 cows are to be fed 
40 lb. per day each, that a cubic foot of ensilage weighs 40 lb., 
and that 2 in. are to be fed from the silo each day. If @ be the 
diameter of the silo, then, 
15 X 40 = 600 lb. fed each day, 
600 + 40 = 15 cu. ft. fed each day,

The result shows that a silo 11 ft. in diameter will be required 
if 2 in, are to be removed each day. 
The height of the silo is to be determined by the number of 
feeding-days and by the quantity to be fed daily. If the 2-inch- 
per-day plan is followed, a silo whose height is equal to one 
sixth the total number of feeding-days will be required. Thus, to 
feed for one hundred and eighty days, a silo 30 ft. high would be

CHAPTER VIII 
THE FARMHOUSE 
By F. W. Ives 
The farmhouse has many functions to fulfill and should be 
designed to perform these functions with economy, harmony, 
and convenience. Durability and beauty of construction may, 
in a measure, be secondary, but are of no less importance in 
promoting happiness and permanent comfort. 
The function. The chief function of the house is to shelter 
the occupants and the equipment. In our climate, where the ex- 
tremes of temperature may vary 120° F, within the short space 
of two or three months, and where varying conditions of rainfall 
and drought must be faced; where there are long and short 
periods of daylight and where there are rodents and insect pests, 
the shelter must be weather resisting, waterproof and damp-proof, 
well lighted, and sanitary. Further, the house is the social center 
and nearly always the business center of the farm. Family and 
neighborhood gatherings are held in it; visitors and callers are 
entertained in it; dinners are served and business is transacted 
in it. It is also a laboratory for the preparation of food. 
The site. As the farmhouse is the center of human activity on 
the farm, its site must be determined somewhat by the fact that 
the house should be accessible to barns, garden, and highway. 
For the most part, the barns are the first permanent structures 
on a farm, and the farmhouse follows. It is necessary, therefore, 
to fit the house site to existing roads and buildings. With this 
in view, the house should be placed so that the prevailing winds 
shall not blow toward it from the yards and barns. The ground 
should, if possible, slope from the house to the barn rather than 
the other way about, and the water supply should be in a place 
free from contamination from barns, yards, and outbuildings, 
92
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE FARMHOUSE 93 
A hill affords an ideal site from the standpoint of air, but it 
may be very bleak and cold in the winter. On the other hand, 
a low site may be excellent for plants and trees and shrubs for 
beautiful surroundings, but may be subject to damp air and poor 
drainage, and hence be unhealthful. The happy medium would 
be the side of a slope, where all conditions would seem to be in 
better balance. 
The design. It would be difficult indeed to build an ideal 
house, but if care and thought are given to its planning, one may 
be built that will suit a given family in most respects. The 
habits of the family, its size, and the manner of living, as well 
as the site and surroundings, will all influence the design. In 
general it may be said that one should secure the services of 
a competent architect when he is building a house, for the archi- 
tect’s experience and knowledge of materials and methods will 
save many mistakes ; he will also plan the building to fit the site 
and will make it pleasing in appearance. 
It is not always possible to incorporate into one house all the 
desirable features that one would wish, since one idea may conflict 
with another. It is evident that it is hardly possible to give every 
room a south or an east exposure, although such exposures are 
very desirable in a room. Planning, then, resolves itself into 
putting together the most desirable rooms, and the most desir- 
able features into rooms, the whole to make a harmonious unit. 
The materials. Permanent and sanitary construction are easily 
attained with our modern materials. Brick, hollow tile, and con- 
crete are the materials best suited for this construction. These 
materials are fireproof and weatherproof, and while the first cost 
may run from 5 per cent to 15 per cent more than that of other 
types, there is a saving in the long run. No material is more 
beautiful or more easily worked than wood. Its main objection, of 
course, is its comparatively high degree of inflammability. Many 
wooden structures are now covered with stucco, which is a plaster 
applied to lath, either of wood or metal, but preferably of metal. 
Roof coverings are diverse and are easily obtainable in one 
form or another. Wood shingles are beautiful, and are durable 
if properly taken care of. Shingles of asphalt and of felt are pro- 
curable also, as well-as of asbestos and of tile. Slate and tile are
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
good, but require heavier roof framing than the others. Sheet- 
metal roofings of tin plate, galvanized iron, or copper are satis- 
factory when properly laid. There are also on the market many 
good patented prepared roll roofings. On the whole, the fire- 
resisting materials are to be preferred. 
The plan. To fulfill the functions of the house as a home 
some rooms may be listed as necessary and some as desirable. 
The necessary rooms are a kitchen (which may also serve as a 
dining-room), a living-room, and sleeping-rooms. These may be 
on one or on two floors. Additional rooms to make the house 
more pleasant and more comfortable are a dining-room, a wash- 
room, a pantry, a library or office, and an inclosed porch. 
With the one-story bungalow type it is possible to have all 
the rooms on one floor. When there are two floors a stair hall, 
a bathroom, and a sleeping-porch should be added. Plans for a 
second floor should never be drawn without careful comparison 
with the first floor, so that stairways, halls, chimneys, and plumb- 
ing can be properly taken care of. Windows on the second floor 
should correspond in location to those on the first floor as far as 
convenience will allow. Chimneys should be straight from cellar 
to roof, and must not be supported ‘partially or wholly upon a 
wood structure. Winders in stairways should be avoided, since 
they are dangerous. Outside light and ventilation in all rooms 
should be carefully prepared for. Spindles and brackets are costly 
and are difficult to maintain and repair; simple beauty is best. 
The square house is the most economical to construct, and it is 
easily divided into shapely rooms. 
The kitchen is one of the most important rooms in a house, 
and should be given first thought in planning the house. The 
housewife spends more time and does more work in the kitchen 
than in any other room. A particular effort should be made to 
design this room so that the distance between sink and stove, 
stove and worktable, worktable and sink, will be cut to a mini- 
mum. Light and ventilation are next in consideration, and to 
make these satisfactory there should be windows on two sides of 
the room if possible. These windows should be not less than 
thirty-four inches above the floor, so as not to interfere with tables 
or sinks beneath them, A rear porch, screened in the summer

and fitted with sash in the winter, will add much to the comfort 
of the workers. Useful adjuncts to the kitchen would be a storage 
pantry and a room in which the men coming from the fields or

bedroom. A living-porch of ample size is almost a necessity in 
the summer. A porch, to be comfortable, should be not less than 
eight feet in width. 
Although the dedrooms may be built on the first floor, economy 
of construction will result in utilizing the second floor. As far 
as possible all rooms used for sleeping should have cross venti- 
lation. Access should be provided direct from a hall so that it 
will not be necessary to pass through one room to enter another. 
The bathroom should be accessible and not too small. If care 
is taken to place the bathroom nearly above the kitchen, some 
saving in plumbing will result. 
Ample closet space should be provided upstairs and downstairs. 
A closet to each bedroom, with additional closets for bedding, 
linen, and cleaning-apparatus will make a considerable addition 
to the value of the house. 
Sleeping-porches are becoming popular. They are not neces- 
sarily expensive, and add much to comfort. Provision should be 
made for closing the openings in stormy weather. Glass sash, 
canvas curtains, or shutters may be used. Screens are of course 
essential during the warmer months. 
The cellar should be accessible from both the exterior and the 
interior of the house; the former to aid in taking in vegetables, 
fruits, and fuel, and in taking out ashes and refuse, and the 
latter for the convenience of the housewife. The cellar should 
extend under the whole house and should be provided with light, 
ventilation, and drainage. These three things will keep the cellar 
sanitary and make it less likely to harbor rats and mice. If the 
heating plant is in the basement, it should be in a room by itself ; 
otherwise the vegetables and fruits must be provided with means 
of storage cut off from the rest of the room. It is well to have 
the laundry in the cellar or basement, and a drying-room is a 
great convenience on rainy days. 
Heating. No house is complete without some means of heat- 
ing and of ventilation. Good ventilation is easy to secure where 
a warm-air furnace is used or where there are fireplaces. Window 
ventilators may also be used. The common types of heaters, 
aside from stoves and grates, are the warm-air furnace, and the 
steam, the hot-water, and the vapor systems,  
-P-A-G-E-111
  
THE FARMHOUSE 99 
The warm-air furnace, which may be quite cheaply installed, 
draws part of its air from out of doors and part through cold-air 
ducts from the first and second floors, and discharges the warm 
air through pipes to registers in the floors or walls of the various 
rooms. It is a fairly satisfactory method of heating if a means 
of adding moisture to the air is provided. However, difficulty 
in heating rooms at a distance from the furnace or on the 
windward side of the house is sometimes experienced. 
Steam heats by means of radiators placed in the rooms or in 
air ducts leading to the rooms. A boiler is provided. It is 
somewhat more expensive to install than a warm-air plant. Since 
the water must boil, heat cannot be obtained immediately ; but 
with good piping it will heat the whole house. Vapor heating is 
not unlike steam, but will heat the room for some time after the 
fire has died down. The cost of installation is higher than that 
of steam, but the cost of operation is somewhat lower. 
Hfot-water heating is steady and reliable and is economical of 
fuel. Its cost of installation is higher than that of warm-air or 
steam heating, it requires larger radiators than the steam or vapor 
systems, and, unless properly installed, it may give trouble from 
leakage. This last disadvantage can be eliminated by hiring 
good workmen. 
The advantages and disadvantages of all the above systems 
should be carefully weighed before any type is installed. In 
many cases individual taste should decide the question.  
-P-A-G-E-112
  CHAPTER IX 
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 
It is a matter of common observation that places of business 
such as saloons and moving-picture houses, designed to attract 
persons who are looking for some place to while away the 
time, are usually dazzlingly illuminated, the owners realizing 
that money spent for this purpose will bring its sure return. 
All who are interested in the making of a good home should 
take the lesson to heart. The absence of a good light makes 
work difficult of accomplishment, deadens companionship, and 
drives cheer away. Modern developments in the art of illumina- 
tion have made it possible for every farm home to be cheaply 
and adequately lighted. 
The tallow candle was the only means possessed by our fore- 
fathers of but a few generations ago for the lighting of their 
humble homes, It served its purpose until a better method be- 
came available, and just as our fathers and even our grand- 
fathers would have considered it a great hardship to have been 
forced to depend upon a candle for light, so we, in a very short 
time, shall consider it almost out of the question to get along 
without electricity or acetylene or some other completely installed 
system of lighting. 
The present generation should have a better lighting system 
than was in vogue three generations ago. To-day the farm home 
is abundantly supplied with magazines, books, and daily and 
weekly papers, and we must read and study if we would keep up 
with the march of progress; so the demand for a better method 
of lighting the farm home is not due to pride alone, but is a 
matter of economic necessity. There are four sources of light that 
may be used in country homes, — kerosene, gasoline, acetylene, 
and electricity. These will be discussed in the order named and 
in connection with the equipment designed for their utilization. 
100
-P-A-G-E-113
  
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 101 
KEROSENE AND KEROSENE LAMPS 
Although kerosene had been known and, in a limited way, 
used for purposes of illumination for several centuries, it was not 
until 1859, when Drake made his petroleum discoveries in Penn- 
sylvania, that it became a commercial possibility. In that year the 
first American patent for a petroleum lamp was granted; before 
the year was ended forty other applications had been presented, 
and for the following twenty years eighty applications a year were 
made, on an average. 
Crude petroleum is a liquid varying in color from pale yellow 
to black, and has a disagreeable odor. Its specific gravity ranges 
from 0.8 to 0.9. It is made up chiefly of carbon and hydrogen, 
being on an average about 85 per cent carbon and 15 per cent 
hydrogen. It is composed of a variety of the so-called ‘ hydro- 
carbon’ compounds, which are separated the one from the other 
by means of fractional distillation. On being subjected to heat, 
naturally the lighter and more volatile compounds pass off first. 
Among the first of the distillates to pass off is gasoline, with a 
density of about 0.65, followed by the naphthas (including ben- 
zine), with a density of 0.68 to 0.74, and kerosene, with a density 
varying from 0.78 to 0.84. These lighter compounds are then 
followed by the various grades of lubricating-oils, with densities 
from 0.87 to 0.93, after which come the heavier oils, or greases, 
as vaseline. 
Kerosene should be nearly colorless (though it sometimes ap- 
proaches a yellow color), and it should not give off inflammable 
vapor below 120° F. It is much better if inflammable vapors are 
not given off below 150° F., since frequent lamp explosions are 
due to the fact that the heat. of the flame causes the oil in the 
fount to vaporize, a condition which, if the wick-holder is taken 
off or the filling-cap removed, is likely to result in the explosion 
of the vapor. 
The kerosene lamp in its typical form consists of the bowl, 
or fount for carrying the oil, the wick-holder, the wick, and the 
chimney. 
The wick-holder, or burner, consists of a device for raising 
or lowering the wick, of a perforated platform, or gallery, which 
   
-P-A-G-E-114
    102 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
supports the chimney, and of the dome which surrounds the upper 
portion of the wick. The perforations in the platform of the 
burner are for the purpose of breaking up air currents in order 
that the air may be evenly distributed as it passes up around the 
flame. The dome assists in directing the air currents against the 
flame at the points where the most air is required, and steadies 
the flame. 
The operation of the lamp may be explained as follows: by 
the force of capillary attraction the oil is drawn up through the 
wick to the flame, where it is volatilized by the heat of the flame, 
and where the carbon and the hydrogen of the oil vapor, uniting 
with the oxygen of the air, yield carbon dioxide and water, the 
usual products of combustion. The luminosity of the flame is due 
to the fact that, since some of the carbon is not completely con- 
sumed, the free carbon particles floating about in the flame are 
heated to incandescence. 
Just the proper amount of oil must be supplied — not too 
much and not too little. If there is an excess of oil, or, rather, a 
deficiency in the air supply, products of incomplete combustion 
will result, such as carbon monoxide and petroleum vapor — the 
former injurious to the health, even poisonous, in fact, and the 
latter very disagreeable. These conditions will also result in 
the deposit of carbon, or soot. 
To control these two factors, the oil and the air, the fount 
must be kept well filled with oil, and the wick must not be 
allowed to become too short. There is a tendency to use a wick 
as long as it touches the oil, but a wick just dipping into the oil 
will not feed freely — it should extend well down to the bottom of 
the fount. Some authorities claim that a new wick should trail 
the bottom at least two inches and should be discarded when the 
trail is used up; the statement is perhaps true for maximum 
efficiency. The wick should not be unduly compressed in the 
wick-holder, as this tends to break the capillarity. The air supply 
is frequently interfered with if the gallery perforations become 
clogged. 
There are several types of kerosene lamps, the types differing 
mainly in the construction of the burner and the wick. The 
principle of operation as explained above applies to nearly all
-P-A-G-E-115
  LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 103 
types, though there are slight differences arising from construction 
details which will be pointed out in the following paragraphs. 
The flat-wick lamp. This was the first form of kerosene lamp 
to come into prominent use. There is a wide variation as to size 
and shape of fount and width of wick. The latter varies from

a wick 1}in. wide will develop about

fifty to sixty hours on 1 gal. of fuel. 
The round-wick lamp. The round- 
wick kerosene lamp was the result of 
an effort to secure a more even distri- 
bution of .air around the flame, thus 
bringing about more complete combus- 
tion. The principle of this type of 
lamp is illustrated in the cross section 
shown in Fig. 71. The central draft- 
tube extends from the base-of the lamp 
to the top of the burner, The flame is 
thus supplied with air from both sides. 
The flame-spreader diverts the flame 
from the vertical path which it would IX 
naturally take in following the draft aan 
currents. SOS TEIN

The mantle lamp. Fig. 72 shows a kerosene mantle lamp. 
This is a lamp of the round-wick type, with a mantle suspended 
above the flame. Its construction and operation are essentially 
the same as the round-wick lamp, though for highest efficiency it 
requires greater care in its manipulation.

  104 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The mantle is responsible for the higher efficiency of the lamp 
and is at the same time the source of the difficulty encountered 
in the actual use of the lamp. The mantle is made of a small 
cylinder of cotton net soaked in a solution of the nitrates of 
some of the rare earths (chiefly thoria and ceria), after which 
the net is burned. During the process of burning, the nitrates 
are changed to oxides, only the framework of the net remaining. 
This is then soaked in collodion (guncotton in ether and castor 
oil), to give a firm set to the structure. This 
material is burned off when the mantle is 
put in place on the lamp. The materials 
of which the mantle is made reach a high 
degree of incandescence when properly 
heated, and the lamp in consequence yields 
an unusually soft and pleasing white light. 
The difficulty in the operation of a kero- 
sene lamp equipped with a mantle comes 
from the fact that the mantle must be heated 
to a high degree, and, to attain the proper 
temperature, the fuel must be burned with 
a blue flame; that is, combustion must be 
complete, so that no carbon particles, or 
soot, will be deposited upon the mantle. 
This requires careful trimming and regula- 
  Fic. 72. A kerosene

A shade, not shown here, tion of the wick, A special wick-trimmer is 
is ordinarily used with ysually furnished with the lamp, and this this lamp 
should be regularly and carefully used. No 
attempt should be made to trim the wick with scissors or with a 
match stem, as is sometimes done. If the wick becomes uneven 
or if a thread is loosened and not cut off, the flame will be uneven 
and soot will collect on the mantle. Only the charred portion of 
the wick should be removed, and the trimming should cease just 
before the unburned part of the wick is reached. 
When the lamp is lighted the wick should not be turned high. 
As the flame becomes even and the burner heats through, the 
wick should be gradually turned up until the full brilliancy of the 
flame is reached. This is an important matter, and its neglect 
often leads users of this lamp to become dissatisfied with it, when
-P-A-G-E-117
  
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 105 
the fault is all their own. Should any portion of the mantle be- 
come coated with soot, it is only necessary to turn the wick down 
a little, when the soot will disappear. 
The mantle costs 25 cents and with reasonable care will last 
from two to five months. Many times it will last a full year. If 
the lamp is carried about from one room to another, it must be 
set down with care or the mantle will be jarred from its support. 
The wick is supported in a special framework, and when it is 
burned short a new wick and frame should be supplied. No 
attempt should be made to put a new wick into the old frame, 
because it is impossible to get 
the wick perfectly even. 
The best makes of mantle 
lamps cost about $6. They 
will develop from 50 to 60 
candle power, and by numer- 
ous tests on at least one make 
it has been shown that they 
may be expected to burn about 
fifty hours on 1 gal. of fuel. 
The quality of the light is 
of the very best. Its clear, ‘rns is caeentially, a: fatwick lamp with the white, soft rays are unusually — wick supported in a nearly horizontal position 
pleasing, and when it is placed 
beside the common round-wick lamp the contrast between the 
white light of the former and the yellow light of the latter is 
very great. Attention will be called later to the healthful qualities 
of this lamp in comparison with other forms of illumination. 
The pressure lamp. There are mantle lamps designed to burn 
kerosene, the fuel being supplied under pressure, without the use 
of a wick. This type of lamp will be discussed more fully under 
the subject of gasoline, since in such a lamp gasoline seems to 
give better satisfaction than kerosene. 
The angle lamp. An illustration of an angle lamp is shown 
in Fig. 73. This is a flat-wick lamp with the burner placed at 
an angle, the wick being almost horizontal. It may be pro- 
vided in the form of a single-burner wall lamp or as a 1-burner, 
2-burner, or 3-burner hanging lamp. 
  Fic. 73. A two-burner angle lamp

  106 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The chief merit of this lamp is found in the fact that the 
flame is directed downward from the flat surface of the wick, 
rather than upward as in the common wick lamp. The oil is 
supplied to the wick by a double-chambered fount, the oil in the 
outer chamber being kept always at exactly the same level. This 
feature undoubtedly secures a more uniform flow of oil through 
the wick than would ordinarily be secured in the common wick 
lamp. No tests are available to prove the performance of the 
lamp, but the manufacturers claim that it will burn about sixty 
hours on one gallon of fuel and give 50 per cent more light than 
the common round-wick lamp. 
GASOLINE AND GASOLINE LAMPS 
Gasoline, as before mentioned, is one of the lighter and more 
volatile hydrocarbon compounds derived from crude petroleum by 
distillation. It has a density of about 0.65 and is so volatile that 
it gives off inflammable vapors at ordinary temperatures. It is 
thus much more dangerous to handle than kerosene, which fact 
has prevented its wider use for lighting purposes. The increased 
demand for gasoline has led to a material increase in the price, 
with the tendency to include in the so-called “ gasoline” product 
a part of the distillate from petroleum formerly included in kero- 
sene. In other words, the density of gasoline approaches more 
closely to that of kerosene, with a consequent decrease in volatility 
—a characteristic which renders it less desirable for the uses to 
which it has been considered best adapted. For lighting pur- 
poses it is used in tightly inclosed founts and in connection with 
incandescent burners. 
The gasoline mantle lamp. The individual gasoline lamp is 
found in two forms, which differ in the manner in which the 
fuel is supplied to the burner, one form using gravity pressure 
by suspending the fuel-container a few inches above the burner, 
the other form using air pressure to lift the fuel up to the 
burner. The gravity-pressure type is the older, and is being 
rapidly replaced by the air-pressure type, which overcomes the 
very real danger of leakage always present where the fuel supply 
is above the burner.  
-P-A-G-E-119
  LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 107 
Fig. 74 shows a common form of air-pressure lamp, The fount 
forms the base of the lamp, and from this a small tube leads 
up to the burner. A small needle valve controls the opening at 
the upper end of this tube. By means of a small hand pump, 
air is forced into the fount (which is filled about three-fourths 
full of gasoline) until the fuel is 
under a pressure of several pounds. 
One charging with air is intended 
te last until the entire fount of 
fuel is consumed. The light will 
gradually grow dimmer as the pres- 
sure decreases, but if the proper 
initial pressure is obtained, it will 
usually burn with satisfactory bril- 
liancy until the oil is consumed. 
By referring to Fig. 75, which is 
a sectional view of a similar lamp, 
one may trace the path of the 
fuel from the fount to the burner. 
In all types there is a pinhole 
opening in the upper end of the 
fueltube (Fig. 74, A). If the 
needle valve B is opened, the fuel 
under pressure will be forced into 
the burner and mantle through 
tube C. Before it can be burned 
in such a way as to heat the 
mantle to incandescence, however, 
it must be volatilized. In the par- Fis. 74. A common type of gaso- 
ticular lamp shown this is done line pressure lamp 
by soaking an asbestos torch in 
alcohol and hanging it under the 
tube, just to the right of point A, for a minute or two. When 
the needle valve is opened, the fuel is vaporized as it crosses this 
hot tube, and is consumed as a gas in the burner. Before the 
vapor reaches the burner it is properly mixed with air as the 
* vapor emerges from the pinhole, so that combustion is complete 
and there is almost no sooting of the mantle.

The chief difficulty encountered with this type of lamp is keep- 
ing the pinhole in the feed tube free from impurities found in the 
oil. The lamp shown is provided with a cleaner, which consists 
of a finely pointed wire placed in the fuel-tube and controlled by 
a convenient lever D. When the hole becomes clogged, or at 
frequent intervals whether the clogging is noticeable or not, the 
wire is forced through the hole, which is thus kept free from all 
obstructions. This may be done while the lamp is in operation if 
done quickly. The 
best lamps of this 
type are provided 
with some sort of 
convenient cleaner.

The hollow-wire gasoline system. As soon as it was proved 
that gasoline could be successfully used in incandescent burners 
there came a desire to design a system in which it could be

building after the manner of natural or artificial gas. The modern

A single tank is ordinarily used

operation, and that is reason- 
ably safe. The plant consists 
of a pressure tank or tanks, 
a hand air pump, the neces- 
sary length of hollow wire, 
and burners with the desired 
fixtures properly placed. 
A compound ¢avk is shown 
in Fig. 76. For a house of 
average size each tank holds 
from four to eight gallons. 
A single tank is sufficient, 
though a compound tank is 
sometimes installed, the chief 
advantage of the latter being 
that it is possible to charge 
the tanks with more fuel 
without permitting the pres- 
sure in the pipe to run down ; 
in fact the charging can be 
done while the lamps are in operation. The tank must be well 
made and must be provided with good valves and connections. An 
ordinary hand bicycle pump 
will serve to charge the tank 
with air. The tank may be 
placed in the basement or at 
any other convenient location, 
preferably in a room where 
there is no fire, in order to 
eliminate any possible danger 
from explosion while filling 
the tank. It is highly impor- 
tant, too, that the tank should 
never be filled when a flame 
of any kind is in the room.

Then, after the valve leading

course it is necessary to gen-

used in a hollow-wire gasoline system. With the fuel under a 
pressure of 16 lb. the lamp developed 147 candle power, while 
at a pressure of 34 Ib. it devel-

always raised when the use of 
gasoline for lighting purposes 
is considered. It cannot be 
denied that there is an element 
of danger present when gas of 
any kind is piped into a house, 
and the fact that gasoline is 
such a volatile liquid adds to 
the danger. However, in the 
hollow-wire system, with the 
pipes thoroughly tested, as 
should be the case with any 
gas system, and with reasonable 
care exercised in the operation 
of the plant, there is no more 
ground for fear than when the

ACETYLENE AND ACETYLENE SYSTEMS 
Although the gas product known as acetylene has been familiar 
to the chemist for many years, it having been produced from 
calcium carbide in 1862 by Wohler, a famous chemist, its 
commercial use is of very recent origin. Thomas L. Willson,! 
an electrical engineer of Spray, North Carolina, in 1892, while 
attempting to prepare metallic calcium by fusing a mixture of 
lime and coal tar in the heat of an electric furnace was disap- 
pointed in his search and threw the product which he secured 
into a near-by stream. It was observed that a large quantity of 
gas was liberated, which on being ignited burned with a bright 
but smoky flame. Further investigation proved the product to 
be acetylene, and to Willson belongs the honor of discovering a 
commercial method for the manufacture of calcium carbide, from 
which acetylene is made. 
Calcium carbide. Calcium carbide is now manufactured by com- 
bining ground coke and lime in the heat of the electric furnace, 
the two uniting to form calcium carbide and carbon monoxide. 
a0 +30 = CaC, + co 
Quicklime and coke form calcium carbide and carbon monoxide. 
In this reaction 56 lb. of lime (CaO) combine with 36 lb. of coke 
(C) to form 64 lb. of calcium carbide (CaC,) and 28 Ib. of the gas 
carbon monoxide (CO). 
Calcium carbide is a dark-gray, extremely hard crystalline com- 
pound. It is not affected by heat or cold, but it must be kept 
absolutely dry, exposure even to air causing it to disintegrate. 
It is packed for shipment in air-tight steel drums containing 
100 Ib. each. Five-pound and 10-pound cans are available for 
certain uses. It is prepared in five different grades (the grade 
depending upon the size of the pieces) ; namely, lump, egg, nut, 
quarter, and granulated, the pieces ranging in size from that of 
coarse gunpowder in the granulated grade to 2 or 3 in. in di- 
ameter for the lump grade. The size purchased depends upon 
the use to which it is to be put.

Acetylene. Acetylene is the gas evolved when calcium carbide 
and water are brought together. 
CaC, +2H,O= C,H, + Ca(OH), 2 
Calcium carbide and water yield acetylene and slaked lime. 
In other words, 64 lb. of calcium carbide (CaC,) combine with 
36 Ib. of water (H,O) to form 74 Ib. of slaked lime (Ca (OH),) 
and 26 Ib. of acetylene (C,H,). The materials always combine in 
this proportion and yield products in the same proportion, One 
pound of pure carbide will yield between 54 and 6 cu. ft. of 
acetylene, but the commercial product may be expected to yield 
only from 4} to 5 cu. ft. 
From its chemical formula it is seen that acetylene is one of 
the hydrocarbons, being composed of 92.3 per cent carbon and 
7.7 per cent hydrogen, It is a colorless, tasteless gas having 
an extremely pungent odor. It has a density of 0.91, being 
thus lighter than air but much heavier than natural gas, the latter 
having a density of 0.56. When ignited in the presence of air, 
acetylene burns with a bright but smoky flame. When it is con- 
sumed in a proper type of burner, however, the flame is almost 
pure white, yielding a light that approaches daylight more closely 
than any other artificial light available for common use. The 
combustion reaction may be shown as follows : 
2C Hie. 5 Of: = 4 COS 1 ee2O) 
Acetylene and oxygen yield carbon dioxide and water. 
From this reaction it is seen that 2} cu. ft. of oxygen (O,) com- 
bine with 1 cu. ft. of acetylene (C,H,) to form 2 cu, ft. of carbon 
dioxide (CO,) and 1 cu. ft. of water (H,O). 
As compared with other illuminants, acetylene deprives the air 
of much less of its oxygen and adds very much less carbon 
dioxide, as a later table will show. 
A great deal of misinformation is abroad in regard to the 
danger accompanying the use of acetylene as an illuminant or 
for cooking purposes. The gas in its pure state will not explode, 
and it will ignite only when a certain quantity of air is supplied. 
To secure an explosive mixture it must be combined with air 
until it forms from about 3 per cent to 50 per cent of the
-P-A-G-E-126
  
114 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
mixture. Experiments indicate that a mixture leaner or richer 
than the limits stated above will not explode.! It is therefore 
next to an impossibility that enough gas should escape from an 
ordinary burner to create an explosive mixture. The common 
burner discharges $ cu. ft. of gas per hour. If such a burner 
were to discharge gas continuously into a sleeping-room 10 by 
12 by 8, with all openings tightly closed, it would take fifty-seven 
hours to reach the lowest limit of explosibility. 
Asphyxiation by acetylene has never been known to occur. 
Not only is the gas much less poisonous than coal gas or natural 
gas, but the odor of the gas is so disagreeable that escaping gas 
is quickly noticed, and it would be next to impossible for one to 
sleep with the gas escaping into the room. 
There is no desire, however, to underestimate the danger that is 
likely to occur from the careless use of the gas. No fire, not even 
a lighted cigar, should be permitted in the room when the gener- 
ator is being filled. If the odor of gas is noticed, the leak should 
be found, but a candle should not be used in searching for it. 
Quoting from Dr. Pond’s bulletin before referred to, ‘the use of 
acetylene for the illumination of rural homes, provided it is gen- 
erated from good carbide in a first class apparatus, and all reason- 
able regulations followed, is no more fraught with danger at the 
present day than any available method of illumination by gas or by 
electricity and less so than the usual employment of petroleum.” 
Generators. The essential part of an acetylene-lighting system is 
the generator. There are two general classes known as (1) carbide- 
feed generators, in which the carbide is fed into the water, and 
(2) water-feed generators, in which water is fed into the carbide. 
In Fig. 81 is shown a sectional view of a typical carbide-feed 
generator. The portion to the left constitutes the generating- 
chamber, the portion to the right the storage chamber. The 
carbide is placed in the chamber A, at the bottom of which is a 
rotating disk 2. This disk is rotated by means of the clockwork 
C. The clockwork, or motor, is operated by the weight D. As 
the disk B is rotated, the carbide which it carries comes in 
contact with shoes on the collar which are supported by chains,

of Mines. :

and a portion of the carbide is forced off and falls into the water 
in the chamber /. As soon as the carbide strikes the water the 
gas is formed, and, bubbling up through the water, it passes 
through the pipe / into the base of the collecting-chamber, 
thence upward through pipe G into the gasometer chamber 7. 
The gasometer bell /'is an inverted bucket fitting into the larger 
chamber /, which is filled with water, the level being shown at X. 
  
    
  
      
  Fic. 81. Sectional view of a carbide-feed acetylene-generator 
  As the gas collects in chamber /# the bell rises until through the 
chains Z the motor is stopped and the formation of gas ceases. 
From chamber # the gas passes down through pipe J/ and up 
into the filter V. This is a chamber filled with felt, through 
which all the gas must pass before it enters the service pipes, 
the purpose of the filter being to remove any particles of lime 
dust or other dirt that may be carried in with the gas. The 
service pipes are connected at point O. As soon as any gas is 
consumed the pressure in H is lowered, the bell 7 drops by its 
own weight, and the motor starts the carbide-feed, causing the 
generation of a new supply of gas to take the place of that used. 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Safety devices are provided to meet certain possible conditions. 
For example, if for any reason the pressure in the gasometer 
should rise to an unusual degree, the bell would be lifted higher 
than is ordinarily done. The excess gas would at once enter the 
holes at P in the outer section of this telescopic tube and would 
pass down into the sealed chamber Q, which connects with the 
open air through pipe #. Again, should the bell become fastened 
or caught for any reason and the motor continue to feed carbide 
into the water, the excess pressure would force the gas to bubble 
through the lower end of pipe J7 at S and escape at R. Since 
the chamber Q contains only a few inches of water, it is seen 
how small is the pressure in any part of the pipe line. 
This type of generator must have capacity for 1 gal. of water 
in the generating-chamber for each pound of carbide charged 
into it at one time. Thus, a 50-pound generator must hold 
50 gal. of water. This necessitates some convenient device for 
cleaning. The slaked lime collects in the bottom of chamber Z. 
When it is necessary to clean the chamber, the contents are 
stirred up by the agitator 7 worked by the crank U, and the 
material is drawn off through the valve at 
All carbide-feed generators work on a similar plan. They differ 
only in the means provided for the accomplishment of the steps 
outlined. The chief advantages of the carbide-feed generator over 
the water-feed generator are that the carbide is dropped piece by 
piece into a large volume of water, thus insuring complete chemical 
action and preventing an undue rise in temperature, there being a 
large amount of heat liberated as the gas is generated. Besides, the 
gas is thoroughly washed as it passes through the water. An objec- 
tion to this type is that much labor is required to supply the large 
amount of water necessary, as well as to clean out the generator. 
The water-feed generator, which is the older type, is now 
largely displaced by the carbide-feed generator, though several 
companies are still making excellent forms of this machine. 
The water is fed into the carbide, which is charged usually into 
several small compartments, the water being forced to enter and 
consume all of the carbide in one compartment before it can get 
into the next. These compartments hold from one and one-half 
to two pounds, the amount depending upon the size of the machine.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME Tay 
The objections urged against the water-feed generator are that 
since the water is fed into the carbide the temperature is likely 
to rise higher than is desirable; and, further, the reaction will 
probably not be so complete. Various cooling-devices are pro- 
vided by manufacturers of this type of generator, so that the 
danger from high temperatures is virtually eliminated. This type 
has one decided advantage over the carbide-feed in that it re- 
quires but little water, and hence less labor is necessary for its 
operation. While the carbide-feed seems to be the most approved 
form of generator and is preferred by experts on acetylene gen- 
eration, the water-feed is giving satisfaction in many homes. 
The following vegudsites for a good generator are specified by 
Dr. Pond in his bulletin previously mentioned : 
1. It must allow no possibility of the existence of an explosive mixture in 
any of its parts at any time. It is not enough to argue that a mixture, even if 
it exists, cannot be exploded unless kindled. It is necessary to demand that a 
dangerous mixture can at no time be formed even if the machine is tampered 
with by an ignorant person. The perfect machine must be so constructed that 
it shall be impossible at any time, under any circumstances, to blow it up. It 
must be “ fool-proof.” 
2. It must insure cool generation. Since this is a relative term, all machines 
being heated somewhat during the generation of gas, this amounts to saying 
that a machine must heat but little. A pound of carbide decomposed by water 
develops the same amount of heat under all circumstances, but that heat can 
be allowed to increase locally to a high point, or it can be equalized by water 
so that no part of the material becomes heated enough to do damage. 
3. It must be well constructed. A good generator does not need, perhaps, 
to be “ built like a watch,” but it should be solid, substantial, of good material. 
No light-weight, half-price metal, likely to rust through and cause leakage and 
resultant gas mixtures, should be tolerated. It should be built of the best ma- 
terial adapted to the purpose. It should be built for service — to last and not 
simply to sell; anything short of this is to be avoided as unsafe and unreliable. 
4. It must be simple. The more complicated the machine the sooner it will 
get out of order. Understand your generator. Know what is inside of it and 
beware of an apparatus, however attractive its exterior, whose interior is filled 
with pipes and tubes, valves and diaphragms, whose functions you do not per- 
fectly understand. If a complicated mechanism is employed to perform what 
seems to you a simple duty, rely upon your own common sense and look 
further till you find a perfectly simple but strong mechanism to perform the 
work of automatically making gas. There are plenty of them and you can 
afford to meet the price of the machine which is least likely to call for repair 
next season.  
-P-A-G-E-130

5. It should create no considerable pressure in any of its parts. More than 
a pound of pressure at any point may be a source of danger; more than a few 
ounces is wholly unnecessary, and not to be tolerated. 
6. It should be capable of being cleaned and recharged and of receiving all 
other necessary attention without loss of gas, both for economy’s sake, and 
more particularly to avoid filling the house with a disagreeable odor. There is 
no need of any perceptible odor about the machine or in the house, and the 
better machines successfully guard against this nuisance. 
7. It should require little attention. All machines have to be emptied and 
recharged periodically ; but the more this process is simplified and the more 
quickly this can be accomplished, the better. 
8. It should be provided with a suitable indicator to designate how the 
charge is in order that the refilling may be done in good season. A generator 
which can by any reasonable possibility leave the household, without warning, 
plunged in darkness, is not to be tolerated. 
g. It should completely use up the carbide, generating the maximum amount 
of gas. 
Location of the generator. The National Board of Fire Under- 
writers has adopted a code of rules and regulations concerning not 
only the location but the manufacture of generators. As to the loca- 
tion, they specify, among other things, that generators should prefer- 
ably be placed outside the residence, though basement locations are 
not prohibited. They must be so located that they may be filled with- 
out the use of artificial light and must be at least 15 ft. from a fur- 
nace. They must be placed where water will not freeze. They must 
have sufficient capacity to make charging at night unnecessary and 
must supply at least 1 Ib. of carbide for each burner, the }-foot burner 
being the standard. The piping must be done according to standard 
specifications and be thoroughly tested by competent persons. 
Neither the generator nor the piping should ever be tested for 
leaks with a flame. A lighted match, lamp, candle, or other 
flame should never be brought near the machine. There are 
generators made in such a way that they may be buried in the 
ground, a possibility which results in a safe and satisfactory in- 
stallation. In this case the sludge is pumped out of the generator. 
Piping. The average house is piped with one-half-inch and 
three-eighths-inch pipe, there being specified sizes for regulation 
distances and for a certain number of lights. If the house has been 
piped for natural gas, it is only necessary to connect the generator 
with the piping, though the pipe is probably larger than necessary.

Burners and fixtures. Fig. 82 shows the typical acetylene 
burner. The gas emerges from the two angles of the Y, the two jets 
meeting and forming a flat flame. There are four common sizes 
specified, — the }-foot, $-foot, }-foot, and 1-foot burner, the figures 
meaning that the burners consume this amount of 
gas in one hour and generate respectively, 12, 25, 
37, and 50 candle power. The }-foot burner is 
the size most commonly used. Of course no man- 
tles are required and globes need not be supplied. 
The latter, however, are to be preferred as well for 
appearance’ sake as for the better distribution of pig. 4 typical

A small acetylene plant. There is on the market at present 
a small semiportable generator having a capacity of twelve lights. 
This system is different from all others, in 
that mantles are used instead of the open- 
flame burners. 
Fig. 83 shows a sectional view of the gen- 
erator. The lower part contains the water, 
the capacity being 5 gal. The carbide, granu- 
lated in form, is charged into the hopper A, 
which has a capacity of 5 lb. The plunger 
rod B is fastened to the plunger top C, on top 
of which is the removable weight D. In the 
position shown, the plunger is locked up by 
the spring lock £, the plunger shaft closing 
the hopper-feed opening at /. The generator 
is started by unlocking the plunger by simply 
pushing the lock £& in. The weight then 
penis forces the plunger down, a position which 
Fic. 83. A semi- allows some of the carbide to pass out, since 
portable carbidefeed the corrugated portion G does not completely acetylene-generator 
re ey close the feed opening. As soon as a suffi- 
ia lights cient amount of gas is formed, the pressure 
on the plunger above the carbide raises the 
weight and so prevents the further passage of carbide into the water. 
The gas enters the service-pipe connection at H and passes 
through the muslin filter _/, through the coil connection, into the 
service pipe. As soon as the pressure in the hopper is lowered,       WATERLINE 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 121 
the weight forces the plunger down, permitting more carbide to 
feed into the water when the process just described is repeated. 
To recharge the generator it is necessary to loosen the thumb- 
screws K, remove the hopper, unscrew the cap at /, and refill. 
The lower chamber is easily picked up by the handle Z, carried 
out, and emptied. 
The generator may be placed 
in the basement or in any con- 
venient place where it will not 
freeze. It may be placed in 
the house, though there is an 
objectionable odor when it is 
being recharged. 
The pipe used is three- 
sixteenths-inch nickeled brass 
tubing. It is soft and pliable 
and may be bent around cor- 
ners, placed under picture- 
molding, etc. Convenient 
unions are supplied for mak- 
ing the necessary connections, 
and it is a comparatively easy 
task to pipe a house. 
The burners are different 
from the common open-flame 
type, since a mantle is used. 
They are rated as 4-foot 
burners, and the company Fic. 84. An acetylene table lamp 
claims that each will develop The construction of this lamp is similar to the 
construction of the generator shown in Fig. 83 
from 40 to 50 candle power. 
The mantle is, of course, very fragile and is subjected to a strain 
each time the burner is lighted, because of a slight explosion, or 
pop, that occurs when the gas is ignited. Under reasonable care, 
and barring breaks caused from drafts, jars, etc., the mantle should 
last from one to two months, the company stating that from two 
hundred to three hundred hours of service may be expected. 
The maximum capacity of the system is twelve +-foot burners. 
Since 5 lb. of carbide are put in at one charging, a total of 20 cu. ft 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
122 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
of gas should be generated. If the burners are not underrated, 
this would run the 12 burners for six hours or 6 burners in 
continuous service for twelve hours. Reasonable service would 
demand the equivalent of eighteen hours of light from 1 burner, 
at which rate the generator would burn four days on one charging. 
Experience indicates that two chargings per week are usually 
necessary. It is not safe to count on operating the 12 lights at 
one time, as this maximum capacity is virtually an overload.

The lamps were first compared in regard to their effect on the 
atmosphere of the room in which they were burning. Table VI 
shows the heat produced in calories, the oxygen consumed, and 
the carbon dioxide given off per 100-candle-power hours. 
The table shows a remarkable variation in the amount of heat 
produced and in the extent to which the air was vitiated. For 
example, comparing lamps No. 2 and No. 3, both of the round- 
wick type, but the latter using a mantle, it is seen that No. 2 
produces about three times as much heat, consumes three times 
as much oxygen, and gives off three times as much carbon 
dioxide. In Table VII, it will be shown that in this test, 
lamp No. 2 developed only about eighteen candle power, while 
No. 3 developed about twenty-nine candle power. The favor- 
able record, by comparison, of acetylene in lamp No. 5 should 
also be noted. It stands virtually at the head of the list.

Table VII is adapted from the same bulletin and compares the 
candle power of the lamps tested, together with the cost of opera- 
tion. The cost is figured on the basis of 12 cents per gallon for 
kerosene, 15 cents for gasoline, and 4 cents per pound for carbide. 
By comparing lamps No. 1 and No, 2 it is seen that No. 2 
gives one half more light than No. 1, while the cost of operation 
for a given period of time is just about doubled. Comparing 
No. 2 and No. A, the latter representing probably the best type 
of mantle lamp available, one finds that the candle power is more 
than trebled by the use of the mantle, while the cost of operation 
is less than half as great. Acetylene is the most expensive light 
of all when cost per candle-power hour is considered. Gasoline 
burns most efficiently in the air-pressure lamp at thirty-four 
pounds. It would not be possible to maintain this pressure, but 
from the standpoint of operation even at a pressure of sixteen 
pounds, it is the cheapest source of light shown. 
ELECTRIC-LIGHTING SYSTEMS 
Until recent years electricity has never been seriously consid- 
ered as a source of illumination for isolated country homes, but 
the advent of the low-voltage generator with the storage battery 
made possible by the introduction of the tungsten lamp, has 
made it a possibility, and the first cost of installation has been 
sufficiently lowered to bring it within the means of large numbers 
of farmers in every community. As compared with kerosene, 
gasoline, or acetylene, for illumination purposes, it has the advan- 
tage of affording a light that is noiseless, dirtless, odorless, and 
nonexplosive, and the danger from fire is reduced to a minimum. 
Terms defined. In the discussion of electric-lighting plants 
certain technical terms will be used which should be well under- 
stood. The ampere is the unit used to measure the flow of cur- 
rent through a wire, just as the gallon is the unit used to measure 
the flow of water in pipes. The vo/¢ is the unit used to measure 
the pressure at the source which causes the flow of current, just 
as the pound is used to measure the pressure which causes the 
water to flow from a pneumatic or elevated tank. The ohm is 
the unit used to measure the resistance which the current meets 
   
-P-A-G-E-137
  
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 125 
in flowing through a wire. There is no definite unit used to 
measure the corresponding factor in the flow of water in pipes, 
which is called friction, though it is estimated as requiring so 
many pounds of pressure, or feet of head, to overcome it. These 
three factors form this familiar equation : 
volts Amperes = shine:   
The watt is the unit used to measure the power of a current, 
just as the horse power is used to measure the power of a flow- 
ing stream. The power of a stream flowing at the rate of so 
many gallons or pounds per minute, and under a head, or pres- 
sure, of so many feet, is determined by multiplying the flow in 
pounds per minute by the head in feet, a process which gives 
the power expressed in foot-pounds per minute. To reduce to 
horse power, this product is divided by 33,000; as 
pounds per minute x head in feet Horse power = 33000 
So the power of an electric current is the product of the flow in 
amperes by the pressure in volts. The power is usually measured 
in kilowatts, or 1000 watts, this being a larger and more conven- 
ient unit; as 
Watts = amperes x volts, 
amperes x volts 
1000 ; 
1 H.P.=746 watts. 
1 kilowatt = 1.34 H.P. or Kilowatts = 
Electric-lighting systems may be purchased in low-voltage or 
high-voltage plants, the fundamental difference being in the gen- 
erator, which may be constructed to furnish current under either 
low or high pressure, as desired. In common lighting plants, 
low voltage means from 30 to 45 volts, while high voltage means 
110 volts. The low-voltage system, which is the most common, 
will be discussed first. The essential parts of a lighting plant are 
the generator, the storage battery (which with a 32-volt plant con- 
sists of 16 cells), and the switchboard, with some form of motor 
(usually a gasoline engine) to drive the generator. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The generator. The generation of electrical current by mechan- 
ical means is discussed under gas-engine ignition, and generators 
for electric-lighting plants are built on exactly the same principle. 
There are, however, complex varia- 
tions which cannot be discussed here. 
Suffice it to say that a direct-current 
generator, usually one of the shunt- 
wound type, is always used with stor- 
age batteries. The capacity depends 
upon the size of the plant and will be 
discussed later. The care of the gen- 
erator consists in using a little oil at 
cts Ai commonctroe lof regular intervals, and in seeing that 
generator ready for service the brushes are kept clean. They 
should be wiped off with a dry cloth 
or with cotton waste when dirt and oil collect. The brushes wear 
out slowly and should be replaced when the contact becomes 
poor, a condition which will be indicated by faulty and irregular 
amperage in charging. 
The storage battery. If two plates, one of copper and one 
of zinc, are immersed in a weak solution of sulphuric acid and 
connected by a wire, a current of elec- 
tricity will flow from the copper plate 
to the zinc plate. During this action 
the zinc plate is attacked by the acid, 
zinc sulphate being formed, and the 
zinc is gradually consumed. If a cur- 
rent from some outside source is now 
passed through the cell, entering at 
the pole of the copper plate, the zinc 
in the solution will be deposited upon 
the remains of the zinc plate, thus re- 
storing it to something like its original F1s- 86. A type of positive plate 
condition. When the cell is so con- eee dna: storage paver 
structed that it may be recharged and 
caused to return to its former state after having been partially 
or wholly discharged, it is known as a secondary, or storage, cell. 
Several cells together constitute a battery. 
    This plate is reddish in color  
-P-A-G-E-139
  LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 127 
‘The lates in the common storage cell are made up of a metal 
framework consisting of an alloy of antimony and tin which gives 
the plates stiffness and rigidity. Moreover these materials are 
not acted upon by the acid in the cell. Pure, spongy lead (Pb) is 
pressed into holes punched in one of the frames to form the 
negative plate, which is gray in 
color. Lead peroxide (PbO,) is 
pressed into the other frame to 
form the positive plate, which is 
reddish in color. The lead and the 
lead peroxide constitute the active 
parts of the plates. The plate is 
sometimes called a grid. Fig. 86 
shows one type of positive and 
Fig. 87 one type of negative plate. 
There are many other ways of 
forming these plates. 
When the cell is being discharged 
the sulphuric acid (H,SO,), as be- 
fore stated, attacks the lead of the 
negative plate, forming lead sulphate (PbSO,). At the same time 
the acid attacks the lead peroxide, forming lead sulphate at the 
positive plate, both plates being reduced to lead sulphate. The 
cell will continue to deliver current until either the lead or 
the lead peroxide is consumed. The action within the cell may 
be shown as follows :1 
PbO, + Pb + 2H,SO, = 2PbSO, +2H,0 Lead peroxide and lead and sulphuric acid form lead sulphate and water. 
  Fic. 87. A type. of negative plate 
used in a storage battery 
This negative plate is gray in color 
The reaction in charging the cell would be just the opposite of that 
given above for the discharge, the lead sulphate being broken up and 
the lead and the lead peroxide restored to their original condition. 
The size of the cell, or what is usually referred to as “type” 
in commercial catalogues, depends upon the size of the individual 
plates and the number included in each cell. In the usual farm 
lighting plant there are 3, 5, 7, or 9 plates to a cell. Where 
there are 2 or more of either the positive or the negative plates, 
1 Timbie, Elements of Electricity, p. 341. 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
they are joined together in parallel. There is always one more 
negative than positive plate in a cell, the idea being to have both 
sides of each positive plate covered by a negative plate, an ar- 
rangement which makes an odd number of plates in each cell. 
The size, as well as the number, of the individual plates is varied 
to suit the capacity desired. The plates are separated by a thin 
sheet of wood or other nonconductor. 
The capacity is rated in ampere-hours; that is, to suit the 
demand for current which is to be made upon the cell, the size 
and number of plates must be such as to deliver so many amperes 
for a given length of time. Eight hours is the period for which 
cells are usually rated, and to say that a cell has a capacity of 
80 ampere-hours means that it will deliver current for eight 
hours at the rate of 10 amperes. Manufacturers allow a capacity 
of about 50 ampere-hours for each square foot of positive-plate 
area, counting both sides of the plate. 
Table VIII shows the normal charging-rate and discharging- 
rate for two different sizes of plates and for a varying number 
of plates as given by a leading company which manufactures 
storage cells.

The jar used as a container for the electrolyte and the plates 
is usually of glass or rubber. The g/ass jars are made in open or 
closed types. In the open type (Fig. 88) the elements of the cell

LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 129 
are shipped separately, and the jars are filled with the electrolyte 
and the plates put in at the place of installation, This means that 
the cells are not charged and must be given the initial charge when 
assembled. This requires from fifty to sixty hours of constant 
charging and should be done by one who thoroughly understands 
the work. It means, in fact, that an expert must assemble the 
plant. The sealed glass jar (Fig. 93) is shipped completely as- 
sembled and charged ready for use. The rudder jar (Fig. 92) is 
always completely sealed and charged when shipped. It has the 
advantage over the glass jar 
of not being so easily broken 
in shipment, but the contents 
of the cell are completely hid- 
den from view so that it is 
impossible to see the internal 
action of the cell, a thing to 
be desired in charging. Fur- 
ther, the electrolyte evaporates, 
and the level frequently falls 
below the upper surface of the 
plates. With the glass jar this 
condition is easily seen and 
more electrolyte may be added. 
The only way of observing this 
with the rubber jar is to screw 
off the small cap and look down 
on the top of the plates. The Fic. 88. An open-glass-jar storage cell

The operation and care of the storage cell. The operation and 
care of the storage cell should be carefully studied. The operation 
is relatively simple and the time required small, but a little neglect 
may injure, if not ruin, the entire battery. The first cost of a cell 
is high, and the depreciation is rather rapid under the best of 
care and very rapid under poor care. 
The chief ways in which cells may be injured are (1) by the

discharged ; (3) by being overcharged or overdischarged, the latter, 
especially, being a frequent cause of injury. 
Lyury by the use of an impure electrolyte or by failure to keep 
the electrolyte at the proper density. The electrolyte is made up of 
a weak solution of sulphuric acid. The density at the beginning of 
the charging is usually 1.2; when fully charged it is about 1.28 ; 
on discharge it should not fall below 1.25. The relative values 
of these densities differ in different types of cells, making it 
necessary to follow the manufacturer’s specifications. A hydrom- 
eter is furnished with every battery, and it should be frequently 
used in order that the electrolyte may be kept at the proper 
density. The water evaporates from the cells even though they 
are tightly closed. The solution should always stand about one-half 
inch above the top of the plates, and if it drops below this, more 
water must be supplied. Pure rain water or distilled water should 
be used for this purpose. Well water should never be used ; it is 
likely to contain minerals that would injure the plates in the cells. 
Lyury by being too rapidly charged or discharged. As has been 
noted in Table VIII, every cell has its normal rate of charge and 
discharge. For example, the cell having five plates, each 73!x 73", 
has a normal discharging-rate of 10 amperes. If the cell is dis- 
charged too rapidly, chemical action does not keep apace, and 
the sulphate will collect on the plates in such quantities as to 
cause them to buckle and twist out of shape, possibly resulting 
in a short circuit within the cell. Moreover too heavy a collection 
of sulphate will interfere with the proper chemical action on the 
metals beneath. If the cell is charged too rapidly, the electrolyte 
will bubble and froth, showing a disturbed condition which inter- 
feres with normal chemical action and frequently results in a de- 
posit in the bottom of the jar. The ammeter should be carefully 
observed and the normal rate of charge or discharge not exceeded. 
Lyury by being overcharged or overdischarged. Not much harm 
is likely to come from overcharging ; in fact it is often advised that 
cells be given an overcharge occasionally. One should be sure 
that chemical changes are complete. However, when all of the 
lead sulphate has been reduced to lead or to lead peroxide, it is 
useless to continue charging further. When the cells are fully 
charged they will bubble freely, or boil. Another indication of
-P-A-G-E-143
  LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 131 
complete charging is to be found in the change in the specific 
gravity of the electrolyte. According to the chemical action 
which takes place during charging, the lead sulphate and water 
are broken up and sulphuric acid formed. This increases the 
density of the electrolyte, which should not rise above 1.28. 
Further, when the voltage at normal charging has reached 2.5, 
charging should cease. 
Overdischarging is the greatest danger that the battery-user 
must guard against. It is so easy to neglect to charge the 
batteries until the lights begin to get dim, 
that a great deal of damage is thoughtlessly 
done. Overdischarging gives rise to several 
troubles —lead sulphate is formed in exces- 
sive quantities and, being deposited upon the 
plates, causes buckling; an excess of lead 
sulphate also increases the internal resistance 
of the cell and greatly weakens the action 
and renders it sluggish. 
When the cell is discharging at the normal 
rate, the voltage drops from 2 or 2.3 to 1.8 
volts per cell. A cell should never be further 
discharged after the voltage has dropped to 
1.8. Furthermore, the specific gravity of the 
electrolyte, which gradually falls on discharge, 
should not be allowed to drop below 1.25 or 
the minimum figure fixed by the maker of the Note the small size in 
cells. A battery should never be discharged so comparison with the lead 
completely that the lights begin to grow dim. ae 
The nickel-iron battery. There has recently been designed 
and put upon the market a storage battery in which the positive 
element is nickel oxide and the negative element pure iron. The 
electrolyte is a solution of caustic potash. The container is made 
of nickel-plated steel. The average discharge voltage is 1.2. The 
reaction in charging, according to Timbie, is as follows :

Some of the advantages claimed for this cell are that it is light 
in weight and therefore suited for traction purposes. The great 
difficulty, encountered with lead cells, of sulphating the plates is 
entirely overcome. It is claimed that the 
cell will stand a great deal of abuse in over- 
charging and overdischarging, and that it 
will stand idle in any condition for a long 
time without injury. It is a little more ex- 
pensive than the lead cell and has not as 
yet been used widely for farm lighting plants.

well as the voltage of the batteries after they are charged. The,

The board should be so wired and provided with the necessary 
switches that the lights may be run (1) from the battery alone, 
and at the same time that it is being charged, (2) from the gen- 
erator and battery combined, which virtually doubles the capacity 
of the plant, or (3) from the generator alone. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 133 
An automatic circuit-breaker should be provided and so regu- 
lated that should anything happen to the engine to stop it, the 
circuit from the generator to the battery will be broken and the 
current prevented from flowing back through the generator. 
A rheostat is usually provided for the purpose of throwing the 
necessary resistance into the path of the current, that the battery 
may be charged at the desired rate. This rate is usually the 
specified normal rate of charge. However, if the engine were 
being used for other work, it 
may be convenient to charge 
for a longer time at a lower 
rate. Again, it is sometimes 
deemed advisable to charge at 
a rate slightly above the nor- 
mal, to render complete the 
chemical action within the cell. 
An ampere-hour meter is 
regarded as a valuable addi- 
tion to a switchboard. The 
purpose of such an_ instru- 
ment is to indicate to the 
operator (1) when the bat- 
tery needs to be charged; 
(2) when the battery has been Fic. 92. The generator, switchboard, and

moving hand indicates the above conditions at a glance. Further- 
more, this instrument may be set so that the circuit will be broken 
and the engine stopped when the batteries are completely charged. 
Counter, or end, cells. When it is necessary to operate the 
lights while the battery is being charged, a voltage higher than nor- 
mal will be thrown upon the lighting circuit, with the result that the 
lamps will burn with unusual brilliancy. To overcome this difficulty, 
counter, or end, cells are frequently provided, usually three in num- 
ber, and an extra switch attached to the switchboard, so that they 
may be thrown into the circuit and made to absorb the extra voltage

resulting from the fact that the generator as well as the battery is 
in the circuit. Many companies do not include end cells, maintain- 
ing that with the improved tungsten lamp they are not necessary. 
The size and capacity of the plant. The szze of the plant is 
determined by the demand that is to be made upon it. For 
lighting purposes only, this depends upon the number of lights,

whereas the carbon-

dition to having such 
a low rate of current- 
consumption, it gives 
a whiter light and maintains its rated candle power better than 
the carbon-filament lamp. The latter requires so high a voltage 
for its operation that it is not used in low-voltage plants.

Table IX gives the most common sizes for thirty-two-volt 
tungsten lamps, together with the power required, in watts, and 
the current-consumption, in amperes. 
The capacity of the storage battery is to be determined by 
the number and size of the lights on the circuit. There are sev- 
eral ways of figuring the requirements of a circuit, and in order 
thoroughly to comprehend the problem it will be well for the 
computer to assume an actual installation, determining the prob- 
able number of lights and the size of each, and estimating the 
probable service in hours per day. In Table X is found such an 
installation. In column A is shown the location of the lights ; in 
column B, the number in each location; in column C, the prob- 
able number of hours the lamps will be in service ; in column D, 
‘the number of lamp-hours (equal to B x C); in column E, the 
size of lamps, in watts; in column F, the current-consumption 
per lamp, in amperes; in column G, the number of amperes 
required for each location (equal to B x F); in column H, the 
number of amperes consumed per hour (equal to D x F); in 
column I, the power required, in watts (equal to B x E), The in- 
stallation includes the wiring of the barn, and while the number 
and size of lights are modest, the estimate is probably not far 
from average conditions.

It will be seen that 9.54 amperes will be required to operate 
all of the lights at one time and 21 ampere-hours will be required 
for the day’s service. Now, while it is not probable that all of 
the lights will be turned on at the same time, there is a great 
deal of satisfaction in knowing that the plant will easily take care 
of all the lights if they are needed. Further, the storage battery, 
as has previously been noted, 
is rated in ampere-hours and 
will not only deliver the full- 
current capacity for the nor- 
mal discharging-time of eight 
hours, but will deliver it at 
a correspondingly higher rate 
in a less number of hours. 
For example, referring to 
Table VIII, the first type of 
cell, size 6" x 6", with five 
plates to the cell, will furnish 
Io amperes for three hours, 
or a total of 30 ampere-hours. 
(It will be noticed that this 
table does not rate the bat- 
tery at the same ampere-hour 
capacity when discharging at a 
rate above the normal.) But 
30 ampere-hours would run

An air-cooled engine is used ity, since 21 amperes are re- quired for each day’s service. 
Under ordinary regulation this battery would probably run the cir- 
cuit for two days or more. The 7-plate cell in the 6” x 6" size will 
deliver 10 amperes for five hours, or 52 ampere-hours, which 
is sufficient for a two-and-one-half days’ run. This size is the 
regular 60-ampere-hour battery, and when discharging at the rate 
of 74 amperes, which would be a fair rate for the plant in ques- 
tion, would need charging only every third day. In summer one 
charging should last for many days.   
   
-P-A-G-E-149
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 1S 
There is always danger that too small a capacity will be 
chosen. It is invariably true that more lights will be used than 
are counted upon at first, and it is always better to have a 
reserve supply of current than to be overloading the battery. 
The capacity of the generator is determined by the size of the 
storage battery, as well as by other purposes to which it may be put, 
as, for example, the operation of motors or heating-appliances. 
The size for lighting purposes only will first be considered. 
The storage battery has a voltage of 32 ordinarily; and when 
charged to full capacity, a voltage of about 40. The generator 
should have a_volt- 
age higher than this ; 
hence a 40-volt or 45- 
volt generator will be 
required. The latter 
is the size usually 
furnished with low- 
voltage plants. At 
the normal rate of 
charge the generator 
must furnish 8 am- 
peres; for excessive 
charging it should be 
able to furnish cur- 
rent at the rate of 10 amperes. Generators are rated in kilowatts. 
A 1o-ampere, 45-volt generator would furnish 450 volts, or a little 
less than } kilowatt. A 4-kilowatt size, then, should be chosen. 
The plant, then, should be equipped with a 4o-volt or 45-volt, 
$-kilowatt generator, and a 16-cell, 60-ampere-hour storage battery. 
The same kind of switchboard is suited to all ordinary farm plants. 
Operation of motors and heating-appliances. It is possible to 
operate small motors from the storage battery, though it is not 
desirable to attempt too much in this direction. Table XI shows 
the size of motor commonly used for the machines specified, the 
current-consumption of each, and the number of twenty-watt 
lamps that could be operated on the same current. 
An examination of this table shows that even the smallest 
motors require a large amount of current. Motors up to and

The current-consumption of all of the above articles is so great 
as to preclude their use with a storage battery. 
Use of generator and storage battery combined. As previously 
noted, a style of switchboard was selected by means of which it 
would be possible to take current from the battery alone, from 
the generator alone, or from the two combined. If it is found 
to be-very desirable to run relatively large motors or operate 
   
-P-A-G-E-151
  LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 139 
heating-devices requiring a heavy current-consumption, it may be 
done by running the generator while the motor or heating-device 
is in use. For example, a 4-pound flatiron may be satisfactorily 
operated from the 10-ampere generator alone. At a small addi- 
tional cost a 15-ampere or 20-ampere generator could be secured 
for heating or for motor work.

Cost of operation. It is very difficult to make an intelligent 
estimate of the cost of operating an electric-lighting plant. The 
actual cash cost is made up chiefly of gasoline and oil for the 
engine, but there is a certain rate of interest on the investment 
and a certain amount of depreciation of the plant that must enter 
into the annual cost. The storage batteries depreciate more 
rapidly than any other part of the plant. The positive plates
-P-A-G-E-152

will need to be replaced in about five years, the negative plates 
in ten years. These elements will cost between $5 and $6 per 
cell, the total 
annual cost for 
this one item 
of depreciation 
amounting to 
from $10 to 
$12. The de- 
preciation on 
the generator, 
the — switch- 
board, and the 
wiring, under 
ordinary care, 
is small; and 
since the en-

estimates the annual cost on a four-hundred-dollar plant at $7.15 
per month and adds that no farm electric-lighting plant of average 
size can be operated for less than $5 per month. 
High-voltage plants. The preceding discussion has been con- 
cerned with low-voltage plants only. High-voltage plants (the 
term usually being taken to mean 110 volts) are not infrequently 
used for farm lighting purposes. With a high-voltage plant

-P-A-G-E-153
  
LIGHTING THE FARM HOME I4I 
a I10-volt generator is most commonly used. All of the equip- 
ment, including switchboard, storage batteries, wiring, and lights, 
must, of course, be designed for similar voltage. Except for the 
storage battery the cost of the equipment is essentially the same 
as for the low-voltage plant. If a storage battery is used, how- 
ever, — and, since without it the generator would have to be run 
whenever lights were needed, it is necessary,— at least 56 cells 
would be required, instead of 16 as in the low-voltage plant. 
This makes a heavy, cumbersome outfit, and the cost of the bat- 
tery is considerably increased. The use of the high-voltage cur- 
rent, however, makes it possible to operate larger motors, and 
heating-appliances can be used more freely. Further, the cost of 
wiring a house is not so much, since a smaller wire is used. 
It is also possible to transmit a high-voltage current a longer 
  
  
  distance without an appreciable drop in voltage, which is fre- 
quently an advantage, as in lighting distant tenant houses,

A low-voltage current cannot be profitably carried for more 
than 500 ft., because of the excessive cost of the large wire 
which it is necessary to use. The size of the wire to be used
-P-A-G-E-154
  
142 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
depends upon the amount of current which must be transmitted 
and also upon the distance. The size may easily be figured from 
the following simple formula : 
Length in feet x amperes carried x I1 sae: SS —____—— = area in circular mils. Loss in volts 
In a low-voltage plant the loss in volts should not be greater than 
1 or 2. A high-voltage plant will stand a much greater loss. The 
resistance of 1 ft. of copper wire 1 circular mil (1 one-thousandth 
of an inch) in area is 11 ohms. The length in feet is the total 
length of wire used, which is twice the distance to the point to 
which the current is to be carried. For example, in the assumed 
plant approximately 2 amperes are required to operate the lights 
at the barn. If the barn is 300 ft. from the house, what size of 
wire will be required to carry the current with a loss of 1 volt? 
Length in feet = 300 x 2 = 600, 
Amperes carried = 2, 
Loss in volts = 1; 
600 xX 2X II ; = 13,200, area in circular mils. 
By referring to Table XIV it is found that a No. 9 wire will 
be required. If a 2-volt loss were allowed, a wire having an 
area of 6600 circular mils would be required, which, according 
to the table, is a No. 12, the size commonly used in low-voltage 
transmission. 
If, now, a 110-volt plant were in use, a drop of 3 volts would 
not be so serious as a drop of 2 volts in a low-voltage plant, and 
for such'a loss a wire with an area of 4400 circular mils, or a 
No. 14, would be ample, and the cost would be materially reduced. 
Though the high-voltage plant has many advantages, the low- 
voltage plant is the one which is being most rapidly developed 
for farm use. 
Location of the plant. It is most convenient to have the en- 
tire plant, including engine, generator, switchboard, and storage 
battery, close together. This makes regulation and control very 
easy. The basement is a good place for the plant, or it may be  
-P-A-G-E-155
    LIGHTING THE FARM HOME 143 
located in an outbuilding. The storage batteries will not freeze 
if kept charged, and consequently there is no danger from low 
temperatures unless the engine is water-cooled. In this case, 
however, proper precaution should be taken to prevent injury to 
it. The room must be well ventilated, as the fumes arising from 
the batteries when they are being charged are objectionable. If 
it is necessary, the engine and the generator may be located at a 
considerable distance from the batteries. 
Driving the generator. The gasoline engine is without doubt 
more commonly used than any other source of power for driving 
the generator. This is naturally so; since the gasoline engine 
can be purchased in any size to suit the plant, and since it is 
easily operated and lends itself to almost any location. Water 
power and wind power are used to some extent for driving 
generators, 
Water power is, of course, available only in a few localities. 
Where a stream of considerable size flows near a farmstead it is 
frequently possible to install a water-wheel which may be made 
to generate a current at an extremely low cost after the plant is 
once installed. A relatively heavy flow is required to develop 
even a small amount of power. For example, in the lighting 
plant assumed, a }-kilowatt generator was used. At least 1 H.P. 
will be required to operate it. If a stream were delivering 120 
cu. ft., or 900 gal., per minute, over a dam 6 ft. high, and if it 
were possible to utilize the whole flow under the full head, there 
would be developed 1.36 theoretical horse power as verified in 
the following computation : 
120 X 62.4 X6 _ 1.36. 33000 3 
Since water-wheels are only about 80 per cent efficient, approx- 
imately 1 H.P. would be delivered at the generator. There are, 
however, numerous streams the country over where thousands 
of horse power are going to waste that could be utilized for just 
such purposes as the lighting of farm homes. 
The windmill has been used to only a limited extent for driv- 
ing electric generators for power and light. Bz/letin No. 105 of 
the North Dakota Agricultural College describes a successful
-P-A-G-E-156
144 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
lighting and power plant driven by a 16-foot windmill. In this 
plant a 150-volt generator was used, and a 62-cell storage battery 
was installed in the attic of the house. The switchboard was 
placed in the kitchen. 
The chief difficulty met with at this plant was the irregular 
speed of the wheel. A governing-device was designed in con- 
nection with the belt pulley, and there was an automatic cut-out 
to prevent the current from flowing back from the battery to the 
generator when the speed dropped below normal. All the diffi- 
culties seem to have been overcome in this case, but the inherent 
difficulties in the use of wind power are such as to make its wide 
use for farm lighting plants improbable.

  CHAPTER X 
SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY 
The first question that should claim one’s attention in a dis- 
cussion of a farm water-supply system has to do with the source 
of the water. While it may be true that in the majority of cases 
the wells or cisterns are already in, a general consideration of 
the subject may be profitable for all concerned. There are two 
possible sources of supply: (1) surface waters and (2) under- 
ground waters, 
Surface waters. Surface waters are not widely used for human 
consumption, though under certain conditions they may be used 
with impunity, and they are often, indeed, the most satisfactory 
source of supply. However, their use is largely confined to that 
for stock and laundry purposes. Surface waters may be roughly 
divided into two classes: (1) flowing streams and (2) ponds. 
The water of flowing streams has its origin, as does all other 
- water available for farm use, in rainfall. But rainfall may reach 
the stream in several ways. For example, it may reach it as 
surface run-off or drainage water, that is, as the water of under- 
drainage. 
If a stream is supplied entirely, or even largely, by surface 
wash, possible sources of contamination are so many as to pre- 
clude the use of its water for domestic purposes. Water flowing 
over the surface of the soil comes in contact with and carries 
in solution, to a greater or less degree, certain soluble elements 
found in the upper layer of soil. Barnyard manure and com- 
mercial fertilizers applied to the land yield their share of soluble 
minerals and of certain organic substances which, while not 
positively dangerous, render the water distasteful. Further, sur- 
face waters come in contact with both human and animal wastes, 
thus adding an element of positive danger if used for human 
consumption. Decayed and rotting vegetation, particularly ar 
145
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
certain times of the year, render surface run-off distasteful and 
dangerous. Moreover, the purity of the surface run-off may be 
influenced by the nature of the stream bed and the banks of the 
stream. Water that is quite unfit for human use may be rendered 
safe if allowed to flow for some distance in a stream having a 
rocky or gravelly bottom and sides. The action of the sun and 
the air has a purifying effect that is remarkable. The water of a 
stream that is fed largely by underdrains may be fairly pure and 
not objectionable to the taste. The water in reaching the tile has 
been filtered through two or three feet or more of earth, the ex- 
tent of the filtering action depending, of course, on the type of 
soil. Since tile drains are usually found in clayey soils, organic 
substances as well as some of the mineral salts are removed by 
the soil. Streams thus fed represent only a temporary source of 
supply except in large drainage districts, where water flows from 
the tiles the greater part of the year. 
In many regions fonds are relied on to furnish water for live 
stock during the summer months. Indeed they are often the only 
source of water for house use. Such ponds may be formed by a 
natural depression, by damming a draw of some size, or by scoop- 
ing out over a considerable area a hole from three to four feet 
deep. They are usually made in regions where the soil is a stiff 
clay and holds what surface water finds its way into them until 
it is consumed by stock or evaporated. As long as rains are fre- 
quent and the weather cool, these ponds form a fairly satisfactory 
source of supply for stock; but in the dry summer months the 
water becomes filled with low forms of plant life and is quite 
unfit for any kind of stock. 
Underground waters. Springs, as a general rule, form a most 
satisfactory source of water for the farm. The term “ spring”’ is 
usually applied to a decided stream of water emerging from the 
ground at a more or less constant rate. There are certain forms 
of so-called “springs” which are really only seepage veins, the 
water escaping from a water-bearing stratum over a considerable 
area and oftentimes only in the rainy season, in which case they 
are sometimes called wet-weather springs. 
Gravity, or seepage, springs are probably the most common 
kind encountered. The condition which usually gives rise to
-P-A-G-E-159
  
SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY 147 
such a spring is shown in Fig. 97. The water-bearing stratum, 
which may be clay, gravel, sand, or a mixture of all of these 
materials, is found in more or less well-defined layers. Surface 
water from large areas percolates downward through this material 
until it encounters a harder, more impervious stratum ; the water 
then finds its 
way along this 
layer, finally 
emerging, usu- 
ally at some 
point along the 
bank of a val- 
ley or stream, through a well-defined channel. If the vein from 
the hillside is not well defined, but emerges into a flat area as 
seepage water, it gives rise to swampy conditions. It is also fre- 
quently noticed that at times the flow is well defined, the water 
issuing forth in a fair-sized stream, while at other times this flow 
will cease or perhaps break out at some other place or come forth 
as seepage water. 
The quality of the water from such springs varies widely ; it 
is usually hard and contains minerals the nature of which varies 
with the kind of soil through which the water filters. Iron is 
nearly always’ found, and frequently an oily scum forms on the 
surface because of the decaying vegetation so often found about 
this type of 
spring. 
An artesian 
spring is one 
whose waters 
bubble up out 
of the earth, 
and, if they 
are confined 
in a pipe, may rise for some distance above the surface. A pos- 
sible condition under which such a spring may exist is shown in 
Fig. 98. The water finds its way into the water-bearing stratum 
and passes downward to an opening, as shown, from which it 
emerges with a force dependent upon the distance of the highest 
  Fic. 97. The conditions which give rise to seepage springs

point of water-bearing stratum above the opening. These springs 
often have a deep-seated origin, as is attested by the temperature 
of the water, the opening through which they emerge being a 
joint in the overlying impervious strata. 
The water from springs is, as a general rule, free from all 
impurities. If the water is contaminated in any way, it is usually 
from surface wash. Polluting elements may, however, enter the 
water-bearing stratum at a point some distance from the spring, 
where it may happen that 
the stratum approaches the 
surface very closely. If the 
spring is subject to con- 
tamination from either of 
these sources, it will usually 
become disturbed and show 
turbidity after heavy rains. 
If the disturbance comes 
from surface wash directly, 
some means should be pro- 
vided to protect the spring. 
If there is adequate protec- 
tion here, and the water 
roils after heavy rains, pre- 
caution should be taken 
Fic. 99. A satisfactory method of collect- that no privy vaults are 
ing and protecting spring water open to the surface within 
a reasonable distance from 
the spring. This distance depends altogether upon the posi- 
tion of the upper strata. Frequently, by observing the general 
trend of stratification on eroded banks along streams, one may 
form an idea of their direction and of the distance from the 
spring at which the water-bearing stratum is likely to approach 
the surface. 
The proper protection of a spring consists chiefly ingpreventing 
surface wash, leaves, and other foreign material from getting into 
the pool or basin in which the water is caught. Where the water 
flows in a decided stream and can be collected in a spout or pipe, 
the only precaution necessary is to keep live stock, dogs, etc., 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY 149 
away. But often there is no distinct stream, and a basin of some 
kind must be provided. It is advisable never to do more dig- 
ging about a spring than is absolutely necessary, as the flow may 
be very easily interfered with. A square plank frame, a hollow 
log, or a half-barrel sunk into the basin, with the earth cleaned 
out, forms a fairly satisfactory and inexpensive basin. Timber, 
under such conditions, will last a long time. A very satisfactory 
basin can be made by sinking one or more joints of sewer pipe. 
This affords a permanent installation which is easily cleaned 
and which is satisfactory in every way. Brick or concrete is an 
excellent material for this purpose, especially where a roof must 
be built over the basin 
to keep out leaves and Concrete tabie 
trash. Fig. 99 gives an 
idea of how the basin and 
cover may be installed. 
Frequently the ques- 
tion arises as to the best 
method of forcing the 
water up into a tile or basin when it tends to rise to the surface 
over a considerable area. This is usually a difficult task. In 
Fig. 100 is shown an installation which has worked satisfactorily     
Fic. 100. A method of forcing spring water 
to collect in a central basin 
in many cases. 
Wells. With but relatively few exceptions our farm water 
supply is taken from wells. As a rule they furnish pure water. 
It is well to consider possible sources of contamination, however, 
and to understand how different types of wells vary in adapta- 
bility, in cost, and in liability to pollution. The common types 
are dug wells, drilled wells, and driven wells. 
The dug well is by far the most common type, particularly in 
the older parts of the country. It is only natural that this should 
be so, for this class of well was the most easily and quickly put 
down; the farmer could do the work with his own force, for 
neither skilled labor nor extensive equipment were required. 
This well, however, is limited to those sections where an ade- 
quate supply of water is encountered within fifty feet of the sur- 
face. Fifty feet is a reasonable maximum depth for a dug well, 
though depths considerably in excess of this are often reached.
-P-A-G-E-162
  
150 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The séze of the hole dug varies from 4 ft. to 8 ft. in diameter. 
The size depends upon the material used in laying the wall, the 
nature of the strata into which the well is sunk, and the depth 
to which the well is likely to go. It is advisable to secure a free 
diameter for the well of not less than 24 ft. (better, of 3 ft.), in 
order to make as light as possible the labor of digging, laying 
the wall, and cleaning. Then, if two courses of brick are to 
be used in laying the wall, a total of 1 ft. 4 in. (8 in. on either 
side) would be taken up by the wall, an amount making necessary 
a hole at least 4 ft. 6 in. in diameter to maintain a free diame- 
ter of 3 ft. If building-stones— either limestone, sandstone, or 
cobblestones — are used, a wall 1 ft. thick is usually laid, and this 
thickness of course requires a correspondingly larger excavation. 
The material in which the well is sunk is a factor in determin- 
ing the size of the well, since this type of well is relatively 
shallow and does not frequently strike strong-flowing veins of 
water. It is desirable, therefore, to have a good-sized well, for 
the purpose of storing a considerable amount of water, so that 
the supply may not easily be exhausted in pumping. Further, in 
some formations into which such wells are dug no distinct veins 
are encountered and the total supply comes into the well as 
seepage water. Here it is especially desirable to have a large 
capacity for storage. 
The depth to which the well is likely to go influences the size 
only as it is related to the amount of work involved. Naturally, 
if the well is to exceed a depth of, say, about forty feet, it would 
be wise to make it as small as possible in order to reduce the 
work of excavation. However, in an effort to save the volume of 
excavation, the mistake of making the hole too small is usually 
made, the result being that the workmen are hindered to such an 
extent that the digging is more costly than if the hole were larger. 
In beginning the excavation a circle of the desired diameter is 
marked out and the hole sunk until it becomes difficult to throw 
the earth out by hand (a workman can throw the earth out of a 
hole from eight to ten feet deep without difficulty if the diameter 
is of good size). A windlass is then constructed over the hole and 
a bucket or tub lowered by means of a rope. The earth is best 
loosened: by means of a crowbar or spud, a pick being advisable  
-P-A-G-E-163
  
SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY I51 
in the larger holes. A plumb bob should be dropped from the sur- 
face frequently, or a mason’s level used, to keep the walls plumb. 
A try stick too should be at hand to test the diameter frequently. 
Some difficulty is encountered at times from the caving in of 
the walls. If caving is very troublesome, about the only way to 
overcome it is to have a cylinder of wood 
or sheet iron that may be slipped down as 
the digging proceeds. However, in re- 
gions where dug wells are common the 
earth is not subject to caving. The well 
is sunk until a reasonably strong vein of 
water is struck. At times such a vein is ati 
suddenly encountered after the digging 
has gone through an impervious stratum, 
and in some cases the water rises very 
rapidly, sometimes quite to the top of 
the well. Often, to avoid difficulty in 
laying the wall after the water is struck, 
an experienced well-digger lays several 
feet of the wall just before he enters the 
water vein, Frequently a slow vein, 
through which the water merely seeps 
into the well, is struck, and it may be 
necessary to carry the hole into and 
through several such veins before enough 
water will collect to make the well of 
value. The material for laying the wall 
should be close at hand, for use in case FG. tor. A method of lay- ache ing the wall of a dug well a very strong vein is struck. 
The material generally used in laying 
the wall is uncut stone, but bricks or 
sewer tile may be used. These materials, which are laid without 
mortar, make a wall ten or twelve inches thick. There is no 
necessity for taking great pains to secure a smooth and even wall, 
as it adds little to the value of the well. It is essential, however, 
that all stones should be securely placed in the wall, so that none 
may be dislodged to cause accident when the well is cleaned. 
In Fig. 101 is shown a proper method of laying the wall.   
  
  
      
    
  ‘The upper portion is laid with 
cement mortar 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
152 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The wall may be finished in many ways, but in each case the 
well should be so protected that nothing can fall into it, If the 
wall is carelessly laid at the top with loose stones only, and a poor 
curb provided, fishworms, toads, snakes, rats, or mice frequently 
fall into the well. Even a small fishworm may cause a consider- 
able disturbance in the water, and a toad will render it unfit for 
drinking for many days. If the plan shown in Fig. 101 is followed 
(and this is not hard to do), little trouble will be encountered. 
In this case six to ten feet of the upper part of the wall are 
laid with cement mortar. This prevents worms or rats from get- 
ting into the well, even 
though they burrow some 
distance beneath the sur- 
face. Further, this water- 
tight wall tends to keep 
out surface wash with its 
impurities. 
While the curb may be 
made of a large flagstone 
or of wood plank, there 
is nothing so desirable as a concrete slab. This may be made in 
place by building up forms beneath and then knocking them out 
after the slab has set, or it may be molded to one side and later 
placed over the well. The concrete should be a 1-2-4 mixture 
and reénforced with fence wire or other rods as shown in Fig. 102. 
It will be noticed that the top of the wall shown in Fig. 1o1 is 
also of concrete, thus giving a smooth surface on which to place 
the curb. Just before the slab is placed over the well, the top of 
the wall may be covered with cement mortar, so as to form 
a virtually water-tight joint. The center hole in the curb need 
only be large enough to take the pump cylinder. The holes for 
the bolts should be formed by inserting either the bolts them- 
selves, or other rods slightly larger, while the concrete is being 
placed. If the bolts are placed they should be well greased and 
should be removed before the cement is thoroughly set. This is 
done in order to make it possible to put in new bolts when the 
threads on the old ones become worn or twisted off. The top of 
the curb should slope outward from the center.

In Fig. 103 is shown another method for protecting the water 
in a dug well. It has many things to recommend it, though one 
rather hesitates to cover up the water supply so completely as this 
method requires. One could rest secure, however, that nothing 
from the surface would find entrance into such a well. 
The dug well should, for obvious reasons, be located at a point 
higher than the surrounding surface, so 
that all surface wash may flow away from 
the well. It is advisable to spend a little 
extra time digging, in order to secure such 
a location, rather than to place the well at 
a lower point. The distance from barn- 
yards, cesspools, privies, etc., will vary 
with the nature of the soil. In heavy 
clay or heavy sandy or loam soil, where 
seepage is necessarily slow, a distance of 
from 50 ft. to 100 ft. may be considered 
safe. This is especially true if the well 
is rather deep and the water comes from 
a distinct vein instead of from seepage. 
If the well is shallow, however, and the 
soil is of an open nature, no cesspools or 
privies should be nearer than from 200 ft. 
to 300 ft. 
The water of dug wells, of course, 
always comes from clays, sands, gravels, 
glacial drift, etc. — the loose, earthy for- 
mations. The water from these formations 
varies decidedly, but because it dissolves Fic. 103. Another method

tities is nearly always present, and calcium and magnesium are 
found in varying amounts. Such minerals as are found are 
seldom objectionable. ; 
The cost of the dug well varies with the size of the hole and 
the nature of the digging, but, as a rule, it will be from two to 
four dollars per foot for the ordinary depth, including the wall.     
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
By way of a summary it may be said that the dug well is 
adapted to localities where water is found near the surface in un- 
consolidated strata. It is cheaply and easily constructed by the 
farm help; the outfit required for digging is not expensive ; and 
the wall may be 
laid of cheap stone. 
It affords a large 
capacity for the 
storage from slow- 
seepage veins, and 
it responds quickly 
to rainfall, On the 
other hand, trou- 
ble may be had 
from caving while 
the well is being 
dug. Such a well 
is subject to pollu- 
tion from the top 
and from under- 
ground — seepage, 
and it cannot be 
dug in rock nor 
sunk to depths 
much in excess of 
fifty feet.

At ais shown an enlarged view of the drill type, and in newer 
parts of the coun- 
try it is often the only type of well found. It is adapted to 
nearly all parts of the country, and it may be sunk in rocks of 
all kinds and to depths of thousands of feet, though for ordinary 
purposes the depth is usually less than three hundred feet. 
A common type of well-drilling outfit is shown in Fig. 104. 
It consists of an engine, of several easily controlled drums on

SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY TIRES 
which ropes are wound and given out at the will of the operator, 
and of a derrick with which the drills, the hammer, and the 
bucket are lifted and lowered. In the illustration the greater part 
of the drill is in the well-casing in the drilling position. Standing 
by the derrick is the bucket which is used to dip the material 
from the bottom of the well. The drill bit is shown enlarged 
in Fig. 104, a. The drill complete weighs from one to two tons. 
An iron casing, usually from five to eight inches in diameter, 
is driven into the ground by suddenly dropping upon it a heavy 
hammer which is raised by means of the derrick and rope. After 
the casing has been driven down a short distance, the drill is 
lowered into the pipe, a little water is added, and the earth 
churned up to a thin paste. A long tubular bucket with a foot 
valve is then lowered into the pipe until the valve stem strikes 
the bottom; this opens the valve, and the bucket fills and is 
drawn out. After the pipe is cleaned it is driven down a few 
feet further and the operations repeated. Extra joints are screwed 
on the top of the casing from time to time as they are needed. 
When rock is struck the drilling continues in the same man- 
ner except that the iron casing is not driven a great distance 
below the surface of the rock. It should, however, be carried 
into the rock several feet, to prevent any possible pollution from 
entering near the surface of the rock. When the casing is sunk 
into the rock, the drill is used to bore the hole and then the 
casing is driven. When a vein of water is struck, a pump is 
usually put in and the well tested by constant pumping for 
several days, to determine the strength of the vein and the quality 
of the water. 
A dry well must be installed if the water is to be piped to 
a point at a distance from the well, as to watering-troughs, 
pressure tanks, etc., in order that pipes may be laid underground. 
Fig. 105 shows a drilled well with a dry well built of bricks. 
A six-inch casing is driven down until it extends a few feet into 
the limestone formation. The remainder of the drilled hole, 
which ends in a fissure in the limestone, does not require casing. 
The dry well is sunk to a depth of five feet and walled up with 
bricks or concrete, with a clear diameter of four feet remaining. 
This size is necessary in order to have plenty of room to work

with wrenches and pipe tools. In the process of laying the walls 
of the well the pipes necessary to connect with the system to be 
used must be inserted. Since it is possible to obtain pumps that 
have a base-cap that will just fit well-casings of different diame- 
  
  Fic. 105. A drilled well with 
a dry well for underground 
pipe installation ters, complete protection to the well 
at the top is easily secured. 
If it is possible to put in a tile drain 
to take care of any water that may col- 
lect in the dry well, this should be 
done. Otherwise it will be necessary 
to leave the bottom open so that such 
water may soak into the soil. If the 
water is drained off, a concrete bottom 
adds to the convenience of the work- 
man when installing or altering pipe 
connections. There is some advantage 
in placing the dry well so that the 
well-casing will be to one side instead 
of exactly in the middle, as the side 
“arrangement gives more room for the 
workman. 
The question of surface pollution 
is not a matter of great concern in 
the location of a drilled well, since the 
depth of the well is usually such as 
to preclude any reasonable possibility 
of seepage waters entering the supply- 
ing vein, and since the iron casing 
keeps out all the immediate surface 
materials, provided the top of the cas- 
ing is properly covered. The chief 
consideration is one of convenience. 
The well should be as close to the point of delivery as possible, 
to avoid the use of needless pipes, and if the pump is to be oper- 
ated by hand, it should of course be close to the house or barn. 
The water of drilled wells may come from any of the sources 
mentioned in the discussion of dug wells and, in addition, from 
any of the rock formations in which water is usually found,
-P-A-G-E-169
  SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY 157 
Aside from sands and gravels, which represent the most abundant 
sources of supply of unconsolidated materials, sandstone and lime- 
stone furnish the most of our water, the former being the best 
water-bearer of all the rock formations. 
The water from sandstone is usually as pure as any unless it be 
that found in sand and gravels. Sandstones show considerable 
variation in structure, some being very coarse-grained, with open 
pores, others being fine-grained, with little pore space; but all 
are usually saturated and as a general thing give up their water 
readily. The water is not highly mineralized. 
The water from limestone is usually found in open fissures, 
sometimes of small size, sometimes of vast dimensions. Of the 
latter, Mammoth Cave, in Kentucky, is an example. The water 
tends to dissolve the limestone and increase the size of the cavity 
in which it flows. As a consequence water from this formation 
should be carefully watched. Often underground cavities connect 
with smaller cavities which reach to the surface. Surface wash of 
all kinds may therefore be carried directly to the supply of a well 
which is thought to be sufficiently deep to preclude all possibility 
of pollution. In the great limestone regions some of these cay- 
ities are frequently used as cesspools, a practice which should 
be severely condemned if wells are near. The water from 
limestone is always hard, but it is usually not otherwise strongly 
mineralized. 
Shales are usually poor formations to yield water. They are 
simply clays stratified and consolidated and are therefore so 
fine-grained as to yield water slowly. 
The cost of the drilled well is usually from $1.50 to $2 per 
foot, including the casing. This estimate is for ordinary drill- 
ing. In hard limestones or in granites the cost may go as high 
as $5 per foot, or even higher. Good wrought-iron casing 4 in. 
in diameter weighs 10} lb. per foot and costs about 35 cents 
per foot. Casing 6 in. in diameter weighs about 27 lb. per foot 
and costs about $1.25 per foot. 
By way of summary it may be said that a drilled well has no 
equal for general desirability. It is adapted to almost all regions. 
It may be put down to a depth of from ten feet to several 
hundred feet. It can readily be deepened if for any reason the
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
vein goes dry. It can be located at any convenient place, and 
the deeper types are not affected by drought. On the other hand, 
it is rather high in first cost, as it requires an expensive outfit and 
skilled operators. The pipes rust and corrode. Water constantly 
standing in the pipes absorbs an iron 
taste, and there is little storage capacity 
if the vein is weak. 
Driven wells are common in sections 
of the country where water may be found 
in sands or gravels within a distance of 
from 50 to 75 ft. and where stones or 
other obstacles to driving are not found. 
Driven wells are found most commonly 
where water occurs at a depth of not 
over 30 ft. 
In the construction of this type of 
well an ordinary pipe, usually one and 
one-half inches in diameter, is fitted 
with a special drive point. This is then 
driven by means of a maul or sledge, 
extra joints being screwed on as the 
driving proceeds. From time to time a 
pump is attached to the pipe in order to 
ascertain whether water has been struck. 
As soon as the point punctures a vein of 
sand or gravel carrying water, the pump 
is operated rapidly for some time, until 
the screen of the drive point is cleared 
Fic. 106. A common form of Of sand and a more or less decided basin   
  
  
    
  ~ driven well is formed at the bottom of the pipe. 
Note the drive point at the base In Fig. 106 is shown a common form of the pipe of this type of well with the dry well 
installed for underground delivery to other points. Such an instal- 
lation is frequently necessary in order to place the cylinder within 
at least twenty-five feet of the water. Often the vein is so close 
to the surface that a common pitcher pump may be placed on the 
pipe. In other cases it is necessary to dig the dry well to a depth 
of several feet in order to get the cylinder down far enough.
-P-A-G-E-171
  SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY 159 
Where the water is more than 30 ft. below the surface, a 3-inch 
pipe is driven and the pump cylinder lowered into this pipe to 
the desired depth. Wells of this type, which require some form 
of power drive, may be sunk several hundred feet if necessary, 
but the average depth does not exceed 75 ft. 
The water of driven wells, since it is usually found in sands 
or gravel, is pure and not subjected to polluting influences. 
There is no chance for surface wash to enter the well, and the 
seepage from privies, cesspools, etc. is not likely to find its way 
to the water vein, because sand is a good filter. 
Under. conditions that are at all favorable this is one of the 
least expensive types of wells. If a one-and-one-half-inch pipe is 
used, it will cost about 11 cents per foot. The driving is often 
the work of only a few hours if no disturbing circumstances, such 
as striking stones that stop or deflect the pipe, arise. There are 
in existence many wells of this type that were put down in three 
hours, some of them furnishing, the year round, all the water 
used on farms of considerable size. 
The driven well is cheaply, quickly, and easily put down. It 
is virtually sealed from all sources of pollution and yields the 
pure water usually associated with sands and gravels. It is adapted 
only to limited areas and offers some little difficulty in operation, 
by way of clogged holes in the well point, especially if there is 
much iron in the water. In the larger pipes there are screens on 
the inside of the point which may be raised or lowered, a device 
which frees the point from any collecting scale. 
The artesian well, since it is made possible only by certain 
geological formations, is found in a limited area. In certain 
regions there are large areas over -which artesian wells are com- 
mon, but these regions are few. The best flows usually come 
from sands and sandstones, although glacial materials afford many 
flowing wells. Artesian wells, except in certain regions, are not 
located in limestone formations. 
Fig. 107 is a diagrammatic representation of conditions that give 
rise to flowing wells. If the water-bearing stratum is punctured at 
any point below the crest, or surface elevation, there will be suffi- 
cient head to force the water to the surface. In many cases this 
head is sufficient to throw the water several feet above the surface,
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The nature of the water varies with the material from which 
it comes, and what was said of the waters of glacial drift, sand- 
stone, and limestone in the foregoing discussion of different 
types of wells applies also to artesian wells. Frequently the 
source of the artesian well is at a great depth, and the water is 
usually pure and cold. 
The water witch. The use of the mythical divining-rod in 
locating underground water-pipes, water veins, etc. has been 
discussed pro and con for years, and in the minds of many it 
represents a more or less infallible method of locating wells. It 
is a well-known fact that the course of underground water veins 
  Fic. 107. Conditions which give rise to artesian wells 
is far from regular, and there is no reasonable assurance that a 
well sunk even 30 ft. or less from a good existing well will not 
be a failure. If there is any reliable means that might be used 
in locating strong veins of water, thousands of dollars that are 
now consumed yearly in drilling holes could be saved. That 
there is any influence whatever, the power of which reaches from 
a distance of 25 ft., 50 ft., or 100 ft. below the earth’s crust to 
the surface, and causes a twig from a peach or other tree to 
turn in one’s hand when a supposed vein of water is approached, 
seems highly improbable; yet there are those whose experience 
makes them strong believers in the divining-rod. : 
One professed believer proceeds as follows : 
Holding the branches of the fork, with thumbs down, the fork resting on 
the chest like the letter A, I walk back and forth. On crossing a vein of water, 
drain tile, sewer pipe, or water main, the fork will cave forward to the ground. 
When the depth is sought I grasp the branches in one hand, steadying the stick 
with the other, and while in a stooping posture I extend the fork forward over 
the vein. The A of the fork will begin to vibrate downward and with a stroke 
that indicates the strength of the vein, the number of full downward strokes
-P-A-G-E-173
  
  SOURCES OF FARM WATER SUPPLY 161 
will indicate the number of feet to the vein. I have had as good luck with the 
bitter elm or swamp willow as with the peach twig.’ 
Another believer says, “Any twig will turn whose fruit has a 
seed of any size.” 
Those of us who are inclined to search for a reason founded in 
fact will look with some suspicion on him who claims the power 
to locate our wells by such methods, and will hesitate to invest 
in his reputed ability. It would seem that the use of the water 
witch is a pseudoscientific process rather than a scientific one.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE PUMPING AND PIPING OF WATER 
In discussing the subject of farmstead installations it will be 
necessary to refer frequently to the friction of flowing water in 
pipes as related to the proper size of pipe to use. Further, the 
question of water pressure will be mentioned, as will the power 
required to operate a pump. So, in order to obtain an under- 
standing of these and other terms, it will be well to discuss the 
general question of the flow of water in pipes and some of the 
general properties of this liquid as related to pumps and pumping. 
Properties of water. Water at ordinary temperature is a liquid. 
Its density, and hence its weight per cubic foot, changes slightly 
as its temperature varies. It reaches its greatest density at 
39.3° F., when its weight is 62.424 lb. per cubic foot. At 100° F. 
a cubic foot of water weighs 62 lb. In determining the weight of 
water, as, for example, in tanks, the number 62.4 is always used. 
A cubic foot of water contains 7} gal. One gallon weighs 8} Ib. 
The pressure in pounds per square inch at the base of a column 
of water, as in a standpipe, an elevated tank, or a pipe leading 
to the cylinder of a pump in a deep well, depends entirely upon 
the Aeight of the column. The shape and size of the column 
do not affect the pressure in the least. Illustrations of this fact 
shown in Fig. 108 are typical. At @ is shown a steel stand- 
pipe 2 ft. in diameter and 40 ft. above the faucet at the base. At 
6 is shown an elevated tank, the top of which is 40 ft. from the 
faucet at the base of the tower. The pressure in pounds per 
square inch at the faucet is exactly the same in both cases as 
long as the level of the water stands at the same height in each. 
Consequently the pressure per square inch at the base of each 
is equal to the height of a column of water 1 sq. in. in cross 
section and 40 ft. high, provided both are full, as shown. How 
much is this pressure ? 
162
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE PUMPING, AND PIPING OF WATER 163 
If a box 1 ft. in the clear on each side be filled with water, 
its contents would weigh 62.424 lb. Each face is 12 in. square 
and contains 144 sq. in. If the top face were divided into 144 
equal squares, there would be a column of water 1 ft. high and 
I sq. in. in cross section for each square. Each column would 
weigh 62.424 divided by 144, or 0.434 lb., approximately. In 
the above cases, then, the pressure exerted at the faucets is 
0.434 X 40, or 17.36 lb. per 
square inch. If the pipe is 1 in. 
in diameter, the total pressure is 
equal to 17 x 0.7854 x 17.36, or 
13.6 lb. 
What is the total pressure on 
the base of the standpipe when 
it is full? The pressure on 
each square inch of the base is 
(0434, X.40;. or §17436: Ibaaihe 
area of the base is 24” x 0.7854, 
or 452.39 sq. in. The total pres- 
sure is, then, 452.39 x 17.36, or 
7853.49 lb. 
The same condition is shown 
in a somewhat different form in 
Fig. 108, c. The pump, pipe, and 
cylinder are installed in a well 
40 ft. deep, with the water stand-     
  : Fic. 108. Pressure of water in a tank

G th a 
the level of the curb, what is ee 
the downward pressure on the plunger of the pump cylinder? 
Although the pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of 
the water in the well will force the water up to the cylinder, the 
work done in creating the vacuum below the cylinder is equiva- 
lent to lifting a column of water 20 ft. high, since in this case 
the cylinder is 20 ft. from the water. The plunger, then, in being 
drawn upward is working against a column of water 35 ft. high. 
The pressure of this column is 35 x 0.434, or 15.19 lb., per
-P-A-G-E-176
    164 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
square inch. The plunger is 3 in. in diameter ; its area, then, is 
3° X 0.7854, or 7 sq.in. The total pressure, then, on the plunger 
is 15.19 x7, or 106.33 Ib. Note that the problem was not 
concerned with the weight of a column of water 35 ft. high and 
1} in, in area, which is, in reality, lifted by the plunger, but 
rather with the force of a column of water 35 ft. high exerted 
over the entire area of the plunger. 
Flow of water in pipes. Water flowing through pipes follows 
the same general law as bodies falling through space. There are, 
however, certain factors which oppose the free passage of water 
in pipes, all of which represent some form of friction, For exam- 
ple, the friction in a rough pipe is greater than that in a smooth 
one. There is more friction in a long pipe than in a short one. 
A small pipe offers more resistance in proportion to the amount 
of water carried than a large one. Certain Jaws of friction may 
be stated, as follows: (1) friction is proportional to the length of 
the pipe, other factors remaining the same ; (2) friction increases 
approximately as the square of the velocity; (3) friction varies in- 
versely as the diameter of the pipe; (4) friction increases with 
the roughness of the pipe and with the number of bends. All of 
these laws have a practical bearing on the installation of farm 
water-supply systems. Often attention to the principles herein 
stated would save a great deal of power in pumping — notably 
through the use of a slightly larger pipe. Where water is piped 
for some distance the effective head can be very quickly con- 
sumed in friction if a small pipe is used. Table XV shows the loss 
in head because of friction in the sizes of pipes commonly used 
in farm water-supply systems. These figures are adapted from 
G. S. Williams’s ‘‘ Hydraulic Tables,” and are for ordinary pipe. 
The practical application of this table may be shown by citing 
an example or two. Some years ago the writer’s attention was 
called to an installation by which water was piped to a barn from 
a spring 700 ft. distant. The total fall was 11 ft., and a 3-inch 
pipe was used. The total flow of the spring did not exceed 2 gal. 
per minute. The water scarcely dripped from the pipe at the 
barn, By referring to Table XV it is seen that if a -inch pipe 
is carrying water at the rate of 2 gal. per minute, the friction loss 
in each 100 ft. of pipe is 1.9 ft., or almost 2 ft.; that is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
- THE PUMPING AND PIPING OF WATER 165 
say, it requires 2 ft, of head to overcome the frictional resistance 
in each 100 ft. of pipe, or 14 ft. in the whole line. But in the 
above instance a head of only 11 ft. was available, a fact which 
explains why the water merely dripped at the barn.

Now suppose a I-inch pipe had been used. The table shows 
nothing smaller than a flow of 3 gal. per minute. At this rate the 
friction loss is 14 ft. for each 100 ft. of pipe, or a total loss of head 
of only 8.75 ft., leaving a free head of 2.25 ft. If the water were 
flowing at the rate of 2 gal. per minute, the loss in head for the 
total length would not be over 5 ft., which would leave a free work- 
ing head of 6 ft. To go still further, if a 14-inch pipe were used, 
the total friction loss with a flow of 4 gal. per minute would be 
only 0.26 ft. per 100 ft. of pipe, or only 1.8 ft. for the total length. 
This emphasizes the necessity, where the pipe is long, of 
using a sufficiently large pipe so that a great portion of the 
total head may not be consumed in overcoming friction. The 
principle that friction decreases with an increase in the size of 
the pipe is strikingly brought out in the table; as is also the 
fact that friction increases very rapidly as velocity, or quantity 
discharged, increases. 
The last column in the table, giving the friction loss in pounds 
pressure per square inch, is obtained by multiplying the preced- 
ing column by the factor 0.434. This is useful in estimating the 
power necessary to force water into a pneumatic tank by means of 
a ram or common pump when a certain pressure must be attained 
in addition to that required to force the water through the pump 
pipe. For example, suppose that it is necessary to force water 
500 ft. through a I-inch pipe at the rate of 6 gal. per minute and 
discharge it into a pneumatic tank. It is desired to maintain a 
pressure of 40 lb. in the tank. What pressure will the pump have 
to work against? From the table the friction loss in pounds per 
square inch for each roo ft. of pipe carrying water at the above rate 
is 1.97. The total pressure, then, necessary to overcome friction 
is 9.85 lb. The pump, therefore, must work against a pressure 
of 49.85 lb. This is equivalent to a vertical lift of 114.65 ft. 
The quantity of water which a pipe of any given size will 
discharge depends upon (1) the head, or total fall, (2) the length 
of the pipe and the number of bends, and (3) the condition of 
the interior surface of the pipe. The ead represents the differ- 
ence in level between the surface of the water in the free cham- 
ber from which it enters the pipe and the center of the pipe at 
the point of free discharge.
-P-A-G-E-179
  
THE PUMPING AND PIPING OF WATER 167 
A formula used in figuring the quantity of discharge is based 
on Darcy’s formula for the flow of water in clean cast-iron pipes 
discharging water under pressure and is 
  where Q=quantity discharged in cubic feet per second. 
Tables XVI and XVII give the values of the factors in the 
above formula for some of the common sizes of pipes and for 
various conditions in regard to fall, or head. It is not necessary, 
therefore, that the student know the meaning or the derivation 
of the remaining symbols in Darcy’s formula.

An example will serve to illustrate the use of this formula. It is 
desired to pipe water from a spring to a house 1000 ft. distant. The 
total fall is 10 ft. How much water will a 1-inch pipe deliver ? 
From Table XVI the value of ac-Vr for a 1-inch pipe is 0.06334. 
The fall is 10 ft. in 1000 ft., or 1 ft. in 100 ft. From Table XVII 
the value of Vs for this fall is 0.1. Substituting, 
Q = 0.06334. 0.1 
006334 cu. ft. per second 
.38 cu. ft. per minute 
2.85 gal. per minute. Heil 
If there are several elbows in the pipe line, 10 ft. should, in 
general, be added to the total length of pipe, for each elbow. 
The operation of a pump. It is frequently necessary to deter- 
mine the amount of water a given pump will deliver, as well as 
the power required to operate it under certain definite conditions. 
The size of cylinder refers to its diameter and length. Common 
sizes are 2-inch, 2}-inch, 3-inch, and 3}-inch diameters and 
1o-inch, 12-inch, 14-inch, and 18-inch lengths. Which size to 
use depends upon the depth of the well. This matter is fre- 
quently overlooked and so large a cylinder installed that the pump 
is very hard to operate. An illustration will serve to show how 
the size affects the pumping. 
Suppose a pump with a 3-inch cylinder is installed in a well 
120 ft. deep. What force will be required on the end of the 
handle to operate the pump, the handle having arms 4 in. and 
28 in. long? As previously shown, the pressure exerted on the 
plunger of the pump in pounds per square inch is determined by 
the height of the column of water which it supports. Assuming 
that it is 120 ft. from the pump spout to the surface of the water 
in the well, the pressure on the plunger would be as follows : 
120 X 0.434 = 52 lb. per square inch, 
3X 3 x 0.7854 =7 sq. in., area of plunger, 
52 X 7 = 364 lb., total pressure, 
28 + 4 = 7, leverage of pump handle, 
364 + 7 = 52 lb. on end of handle. 
A person operating a pump cannot, with comfort, supply in 
continuous pumping a force in excess of from 15 to 20 lb. 
Therefore a 3-inch cylinder is out of the question. 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  
  THE PUMPING AND PIPING OF WATER 169 
What force would be necessary on the end of the handle if a 
2-inch cylinder were used ? 
120 X 0.434 = 52 lb. per square inch, 
2X 2 xX 0.7854 = 3.14 sq. in., area of plunger, 
52 X 3.14 = 163.28 lb., total pressure, 
163.28 + 7 = 23.32 lb. on end of handle. 
A 2-inch cylinder, then, requires a force of 23.32 lb. on the 
end of the handle. This is within the range of possibility, but 
still very difficult work, as would be expected in a well of this 
depth. Friction in the pump was disregarded in each case, as 
was the weight of the plunger rod, both of which would add 
something to the above results. 
The guantity of water which a pump will deliver, depends 
upon the size of the cylinder, the length of the stroke, and the 
number of strokes per minute. Pumps should not be operated 
faster than 40 strokes per minute, or there will be undue wear 
on the leathers. How much water will a pump having a cylinder 
3 in. in diameter and a 6-inch stroke deliver when operated at 
the rate of 40 strokes per minute? 
3 X 3 x 0.7854 = 7 in., area of base of cylinder, 
7 x 6 = 42 cu. in., volume of each stroke, 
42 X 40 = 1680 cu. in., volume of 40 strokes, 
1680 + 231 = 7.27 gal. per minute, 
7.27 X 70% = 5.08 gal. per minute, actually delivered. 
The last step allows an efficiency of 70 per cent for the pump; 
that is, the pump will deliver only 70 per cent of the total volume 
at each stroke, 30 per cent being a reasonable allowance for poor 
leathers, leakage, etc. 
Power for pumping. All power is measured in terms of horse 
power. One horse power represents the amount of work done in 
lifting 33,000 Ib. to a height of 1 ft. in one minute, or, briefly 
stated, it represents 33,000 ft.-lb. per minute. The same work 
would be done if 33 lb. were lifted to a height of 1000 ft. in one 
minute ; any other transformation, also, would still be the equiva- 
lent, provided the proper relation of factors is maintained. 
It follows, therefore, that in order to determine the power 
required for pumping water, it is only necessary to determine
-P-A-G-E-182
  .170 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
the amount per minute that is to be delivered, the height to 
which it is to be lifted, and the length of pipe through which it 
must be forced. An illustration will explain. How much power 
will be required to operate a pump which is lifting water from 
the bottom of a well 120 ft. deep and forcing it into a tank 
40 ft. high at the rate of 10 gal. per minute? The tank is 
located 300 ft. from the well. All pipe used is 1} in. in diameter. 
120 + 40 + 300 = 460, total length of pipe, 
3 ft. = friction loss per 100 ft. (Table XV), 
4.6 X 3 = 13.8, friction loss in 460 ft., 
120 + 4o + 13.8 = 173.8 ft., total lift, 
10 x 8} = 83.3 Ib. lifted per minute, 
83.3 x 173.8 = 14,477.5 ft-lb. per minute, 
14,477.5 + 33,000 = 0.44 H. P. (theoretical). 
In order to allow for losses in the engine, pump, etc., the 
theoretical horse power should be doubled. This would give 0.88 
in the above problem, a number requiring a 1-horse-power engine. 
Table XVIII gives the capacity, at the rate of forty strokes 
per minute, of the sizes of cylinders mentioned, and the theo- 
retical horse power required to lift the given quantity to the 
stated height. 
This table, as stated, gives the theoretical horse power. The 
figures should be doubled to give the actual horse power required. 
In fact some writers recommend that the theoretical power be 
multiplied by three for pumps of small capacity under high lifts. 
The windmill and the gasoline engine are two very common 
sources of power for pumping. However, the details of construc- 
tion or of operation of neither will be discussed-in this chapter, 
since each will be considered in detail in other chapters. But the 
question as to which is the more satisfactory for pumping water 
frequently arises and for that reason is briefly discussed here. 
There is no doubt that the windmill affords the cheaper 
source of power. It requires almost no attention except oiling 
once a week; it will last for fifteen years if it is properly cared 
for, its bolts kept tightened, etc. Moreover, the wind costs 
nothing. On the other hand, it is essential that a sufficient 
amount of storage be provided to tide over possible days of calm. 
If much live stock is dependent on the mill for water, there are
-P-A-G-E-183
THE PUMPING AND PIPING OF WATER 171 
almost sure to be days when the water will give out. Intelligent 
care in keeping the tanks full will not allow this to happen often. 
Storage in winter means cold and frozen water; in summer, 
warm water. The windmill, too, is likely to be wrecked by storm.

The engine is being widely used for pumping water. Its first 
cost is less by one half than that of a windmill. The water can 
be pumped when needed, which means fresh water both summer 
and winter. It will not blow over, but it requires constant care, 
and the fuel cost for a year’s pumping is considerable. All 
things considered, the windmill seems to be the better device 
unless from thirty to forty head of live stock are to be supplied, 
in which case the storage would become so expensive an item 
as to make an engine the more economical.

CHAPTER XII 
PUMPS AND THEIR OPERATION 
Before taking up a detailed study of the different types of 
pumps in common use it will be necessary to give some atten- 
tion to the theory of pump operation, in preparation for a clear 
understanding of the reasons underlying the various construc- 
tions discussed. 
Air in its relation to pumping. Nearly all our modern 
pumps depend upon and make use of certain properties of air, 
the chief of which are its weight and its elasticity, or compressi- 
bility. We are living at the bottom of a great sea of air which 
is many miles in depth. Just as a column of water supported in a 
vertical pipe exerts a pressure at the bottom of the pipe, so does 
this sea of air, which may be considered as made up of many 
columns, exert a pressure on all objects or surfaces at its bottom. 
Several everyday phenomena illustrate this fact. If one is 
sucking cider through a long straw, the pressure of the air on 
the outer surface of the straw frequently causes it to collapse. 
If water is pumped through a rubber hose used as a suction 
pipe — for example, in a spraying-outfit— and if the entrance 
to the hose becomes clogged, it will collapse, because the pres- 
sure on the outside is greater than that on the inside. If a 
sirup can is filled to a depth of one inch or so with water and 
then placed on a stove until the water boils vigorously, a part of 
the air within the can is driven out. Now if the cap is screwed 
on tightly and the can set in cold water or even allowed to cool 
in the open room, the sides will soon begin to collapse. Here 
again the pressure on the outside is greater than that on the 
inside ; or, in other words, it is the weight of the air pressing 
on the surface of the straw, rubber hose, or can that produces 
the collapse. An open vessel does not collapse, because the air 
pressure is the same on all sides. 
172)
-P-A-G-E-185
  
PUMPS AND THEIR OPERATION 173 
If a tube forty inches in length is filled with mercury and 
inverted and the open end placed in a vessel of mercury, at sea 
level it will be found that the surface of the mercury in the 
tube will be approximately thirty inches above the level of that 
in the vessel. The absence of air in the tube removes the pres- 
sure on the inside of the tube, and the weight of the air pressing 
on the surface of the liquid in the vessel, in order to preserve 
a balance of pressure, holds the mercury at this height. 
If the tube were I sq. in. in cross section, there would be 30 
cu. in. of mercury supported in the tube, and since 1 cu. in. 
of mercury weighs 0.49 lb., the total weight of this column of 
mercury would be 0.49 x 30 = 14.7 1b, In other words, there is 
a pressure upwards on the bottom of this tube equal to 14.7 lb. 
per square inch of the surface of the mercury in the vessel. If 
this is true of the mercury in the vessel, it is true of all surfaces 
at the sea level; and they are in reality found to be subjected to 
this same pressure of 14.7 lb. per square inch. 
Mercury is 13.6 times as heavy as water; so that if water 
were substituted in the tube, it would rise 13.6 times as high, 
or 13.6 X 30= 408 in., or 34 ft., which is recognized as the 
approximate height to which air pressure will lift a column of 
water under ideal conditions. When the piston, or plunger, of 
a pump is drawn upward it exhausts the air from the cylinder, 
and the pressure of the atmosphere upon the water in the well 
forces the water up through the pipe and fills the cylinder. 
Theoretically, then, pump cylinders could be placed 34 ft. above 
the level of low water, but owing to valve leakage, worn leathers, 
etc., the maximum working distance is 25 ft., and 20 ft. is a 
safer working distance. 
Atmospheric pressure is, as stated, 14.7 lb. per square inch at 
sea level. This pressure decreases as elevation increases, at an 
approximate rate of }1b. for each 1000 ft., until at an elevation 
of 45 miles the air is so rare as to have no appreciable weight. 
The elasticity, or compressibility, of air is made use of in 
pumping water in pneumatic systems of water supply. If a 
tightly fitting piston is forced into an air-tight cylinder until the 
volume of air originally contained is reduced one half, or until 
the same volume of air is forced into one half the space it
-P-A-G-E-186
  
174 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
originally occupied, it is found that the pressure contained is twice 
as great as it was before compression. If the same air is com- 
pressed into a space one third, one tenth, etc., as large as the 
original, the pressure of that air becomes three, four, ten, etc. 
times as great. On the other hand, if this compressed air is 
allowed to expand to a volume three, four, ten, etc., times as 
great as that which it originally occupied, the pressure will be 
reduced exactly one third, one fourth, one tenth, etc. 
In pneumatic systems water is used in place of the piston, 
and the pneumatic tank in place of the cylinder. The action is 
exactly the same, with a few exceptions, and depends upon the 
principle that since water is virtually incompressible, it acts as 
a solid piston. It dissolves, or absorbs, air to some extent, how- 
ever, and if air is not supplied at intervals, the volume of air 
originally contained in the tank becomes smaller and smaller 
until in time it may become completely absorbed by the water. 
More will be said of this when pneumatic systems are discussed. 
Types oF Pumps 
There are upon the market many different types of pumps, 
each adapted to some specific purpose. The following sections 
will briefly describe the 
more common types and 
tell how they operate and 
what conditions they are 
intended to meet. 
Thesweep. The sweep 
was one of the first me- 
chanical devices put into 
use for lifting water from 
wells. It was an improve- 
ment over the bucket 
and rope, but is now 
only occasionally found. 
The windlass. The windlass represents the next step in water- 
lifting devices, and associated with it for all time is ‘The Old 
Oaken Bucket.” The windlass is still frequently used, and from 
  Fic. 109. A well-constructed, neat, and sanitary 
windlass and cover 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
PUMPS AND THEIR OPERATION 175 
the standpoint of sanitation it is fairly satisfactory if the well is 
properly protected. The effort required to lift the water is out 
of all proportion to the fancied advantages of the windlass, how- 
ever, and too often it is the case that the housewife has the 
bulk of the water to lift. Fig. 109 shows a type of windlass 
and cover in common use. 
The chain pump. There pyre 
are two types of chain 
pumps, differing in the shied 
method used to raise the Bucket 
water. The first and older type 
has small tx buckets, holding 
about one pint each, mounted 
on an endless chain. As the 
chain is revolved each bucket 
dips into the water in the well, 
carries its portion to the top, 
and empties the contents into 
the delivery spout as it passes 
over the reel. Each bucket has 
a small hole near the bottom, to 3 
drain out all water in case of |WNe-____}_j _____ 
freezing weather. 
The more modern type of 
chain pump is shown in Fig. 110. 
Rubber buckets are attached to 
the chain at intervals of several 
feet. These buckets, one of ic. 110. A modern chain pump with 
which is shown in Fig. 110, a, rubber buckets and steel tube 
are drawn through tubing, and At zis shown a section of an adjustable 
as each bucket is drawn upward eo aie 
it tends to leave a vacuum beneath it, the air pressure forcing 
the water up into the tube. As soon as another bucket enters 
the tube it lifts directly the water which is above it, and carries 
it to the top of the tube. 
Formerly the ¢#dzng was made of wood, which was satisfactory 
material, lasting for many years. In a well of any depth, how- 
ever, it was so heavy that it was a difficult task to lift it out of    
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
the well. The metal tubing is so much lighter and more satis- 
factory in every way that itis now rather generally used. The 
buckets are of different kinds, some being adjustable. The one 
shown is capable of being enlarged as the rubber becomes worn, 
if the nut on the threaded stem is turned up. This is a valuable 
feature, and buckets of this type should always be purchased. 
The chain pump is best adapted to cisterns and shallow wells. 
There is no other type of hand pump that can be made to throw 
a larger stream, and hence in the shallow reser- 
voir it is most satisfactory. In wells as deep as 
thirty feet, however, the weight of the chain is 
so great as to make the pump hard to operate. 
It is best adapted, therefore, to wells less than 
twenty-five feet in depth. The pump gives but 
little trouble. The buckets must be renewed 
every year or so, and the chain will, in five or 
six years, become worn at the wearing surfaces 
so as to give trouble from breaking. The deeper 
the well, the greater the wear. A good chain 
pump for a cistern or a shallow well costs 
about $12. 
The plunger pump. The plunger pump repre- 
sents a type of which there are several forms. 
All have the same general construction in that 
the pumping-parts consist essentially of a cylin- 
der and of a plunger, or piston. Plunger pumps 
may be classified as (1) lift pumps and (2) force 
pumps. They may be further classified as 
(1) single-action pumps and (2) double-action 
pumps. A single-action pump may be a lift pump or a force 
pump ; a double-action pump is always a force pump. 
A single-action lift pump is shown in Fig. 111. It is called a 
lift pump because the top of the standard through which the 
plunger rod works is open so that water cannot be forced higher 
than the spout. It is called single-action because, as will be 
shown later, the greater part of the water is delivered on the up 
stroke of the plunger. The action of the pump is as follows: In 
Fig. 112, a, the plunger is being lifted by the down stroke of the       Set length pipe 
Fic. 111. A single- 
action lift pump 
   
-P-A-G-E-189
PUMPS AND THEIR OPERATION 177 
handle. As it passes upward there is a tendency to create a 
vacuum below the plunger, but since the atmosphere is pressing 
down on the surface of the water in the well at the rate of 14.7 
pounds per square inch at sea level, this force, in order to main- 
tain equal pressure within the cylinder, will drive water up against 
the flap valve and into the cylinder. Thus, when the plunger 
reaches the limit of its upper stroke, the cylinder is almost full 
of water, although it is never 
completely full, since there 
is never a perfect vacuum 
created. 
On the down stroke of the 
plunger (Fig. 112, 4) the 
flap valve closes, the poppet 
valve is lifted off its seat, 
and the plunger finishes its 
stroke with all the water 
above it. In the next up 
stroke of the plunger, the 
water above it is lifted up to 
the spout, while at the same 
time a new charge is forced 
into the cylinder from below. 
It is seen that water is lifted 
to the delivery spout only on 
the up stroke of the plunger, 
which corresponds to the 
down stroke of the handle ; 
hence the term “‘ single-action 
pump.” If one pumps fast 
enough it is possible to secure a more or less steady stream, 
although as a rule the flow is intermittent. 
This pump is primarily intended for shallow wells. The pipe ex- 
tending from the standard to the cylinder is called a set-length pipe, 
a term meaning that the cylinder is seldom placed nearer the water 
than the set length permits. This would limit the use of the pump 
to wells not over thirty-five feet deep. As a matter of fact the 
cylinder may be lowered any reasonable distance with satisfaction.

The cylinder may be made of cast iron, of galvanized iron, of 
iron lined with brass or with porcelain, or it may be made of solid

or brass-lined cylinder 
has the great ad- 
vantage of unusual 
smoothness, an advan- 
tage which is condu- 
cive to long life of the 
leathers. An all-brass 
cylinder, however, is 
rather soft and cannot. 
be readily clasped with 
pipe-wrenches without 
being dented. The 
porcelain-lined cylinder is very smooth, but is likely to scale. It 
is used in pumping salt water or other material that would corrode 
iron. A first-class iron 
cylinder turned to a true 
diameter, ground, and pol- 
ished, is cheaper than 
any of the others and is 
very satisfactory. It can 
be readily handled with 
wrenches and will not bend 
out of shape. Fig. 113, a, 
6, c, d, shows various types 
of cylinders. The inside- 
cap cylinder (Fig. 113, 2) 
is for use in wells of 
small bore. 
The plunger, details 
of which are shown: in 
Fig. 114, is one of the 
vital parts of the pump. Cup LEATHER BEFORE

The plunger leather, or cup valve, is a crimped leather and 
should always be made of oak-tanned leather of the best quality. 
It wears rapidly, and the efficiency of the pump depends in
-P-A-G-E-191
  
PUMPS AND THEIR OPERATION 179 
large measure on the quality and durability of this leather. The 
bottom of the plunger is screwed off, the leather inserted, and 
the bottom replaced. 
The poppet valve is usually made of iron. Some manufacturers 
are providing a brass seat for this valve. Brass would not cor- 
rode and roughen as would iron, and it is readily seen that a 
perfectly smooth seat is essential. A ball valve is used by some 
manufacturers. This type pos- 
sesses the advantage of wear- 
ing evenly all around, and 
sand is not so likely to inter- 
fere with its proper seating. 
The flap valve, or suction 
leather, should be made of the 
best leather possible. The seat 
is usually of iron, though it 
may be of brass or glass. 
When quicksand is present, it 
is sometimes advisable to place 
a disk of leather beneath the 
valve, in which case the fine 
sand particles do not hold the 
valve off its seat so easily. 
A ball valve is frequently 
used, and where there is sand 
in the water this type is espe- 
cially desirable. 
The cost of the single-action Fic. 115. Construction of a common 
lift pump with the 5-foot set- pitcher pump, used chiefly in cisterns 
length pipe is about as follows: 3-inch cylinder and 14-inch pipe, 
complete with iron cylinder, $5.75 ; with porcelain-lined cylinder, 
$6.75; with brass-lined cylinder, $7.25 ; brass-body cylinder, $8.25. 
The pztcher pump, shown in Fig. 115, is a type of lift pump 
primarily adapted to cisterns. Its construction and operation 
are essentially the same as the lift pump just described, except 
that the cylinder is a part of the pump standard. This pump 
must never be set more than 20 ft. above the level of the water, 
and 15 ft. is a more common distance. It will of course lift

  180 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
water 30 ft. or more, but the handle is usually so short that 
pumping to this height is very difficult. The cylinder may be 
of the same materials as those mentioned for the lift pump. 
The porcelain-lined cylinder is commonly used for pumping salt 
water, milk, etc. 
The single-action force pump, one style of which is shown in 
Fig. 116, differs from the lift pump in that the standard is enlarged 
into an air-chamber, and the plunger rod 
works through a stuffing-box in the top of 
this chamber. The action of this pump is 
quite different from that of the lift pump. 
As the water is forced upward by the up 
stroke of the plunger, a part of it goes out 
through the delivery spout, while a part acts 
to compress air in the air-chamber. Then, 
on the down stroke of the plunger, this air 
expands and drives the water out through 
the spout. With reasonably fast pumping, 
a steady stream is maintained; and since 
the top of the standard is closed, the water 
may be delivered against considerable pres- 
sure, a characteristic of the pump which 
gives rise to the term “force pump.” 
At times, when all of the leathers are 
new and the stuffing-box is air-tight and 
water-tight, the air-chamber loses its effec- 
Fic. 116. A simple type tiveness because of the fact that the water of single-action force : A 
pump dissolves, or absorbs, the air, and so the 
chamber becomes filled with water. There 
is usually a plug in the chamber which may be screwed out to per- 
mit the chamber to fill with air. The packing around the plunger 
rod will need to be renewed occasionally, and the box must 
be screwed down at intervals as the packing wears. The air- 
chamber on this pump may be entirely separate from the 
pump standard and attached to the delivery spout by a short 
length of pipe. This arrangement is often seen in cistern pumps 
where the water is forced to an attic tank. One advantage in 
this type of pump lies in the fact that if a large air-chamber is 
   
-P-A-G-E-193
  
PUMPS AND THEIR OPERATION 181 
needed, as when pumping the water to a considerable height or 
when pumping against high pressure of any kind, the chamber 
best adapted to the work to be done may be attached. This 
type of pump will cost about two dollars more than a common 
lift pump similarly equipped. 
A double-action force pump is shown in Fig. 117. It will be 
noticed that this pump has two cylinders, a sectional view of which 
is shown in Fig. 118. In addition 
to the two cylinders there are the 
delivery pipe and the pipe forming 
part of the pump standard, which is Cire ey, 
used as an air-chamber. The action 
of the pump may be seen by re- 
ferring to Fig. 118. On the up 
stroke of the plunger, water is drawn 
into the main cylinder by the action 
heretofore described. On the down 
stroke this water is transferred to 
the upper part of the lower cylin- et a a 
der. On the following up stroke Cenneation! 
(Fig. 118, a), while the lower part 
of the main cylinder is filling with 
water from below, the water above 
the lower plunger is being forced 
partly into the delivery pipe, partly 
into the secondary cylinder, and partly 
into the air-chamber. On the next 
down stroke (Fig. 118, 4) the plunger 
in the secondary cylinder is forcing its contents out deen the 
delivery pipe. At the instant between strokes the air in the air- 
chamber is permitted to expand and force still more water out 
of the delivery pipe. Thus it is seen that water is forced out 
through the delivery pipe on both the up stroke and the down 
stroke of the plunger; hence the name “ double-action pump.” 
It should be noted, however, that water is drawn from the well 
only on the up stroke of the plunger, the same as in a common 
lift pump. The term ‘double-action” is used here as opposed to 
the term ‘‘double-acting,” which will be used later in connection         Adjustable Base

with a type of pump that draws water from the source of supply 
at each stroke of the handle. 
The secondary cylinder is usually one half the volume of the 
main cylinder, so that on the up stroke approximately one half 
the water enters the upper cylinder, and the greater part of the 
rest goes out through the 
delivery pipe. The pres- 
ence of this upper cylin- 
der makes this type a 
positive force pump, 
whereas the type just de- 
scribed as a single-action 
force pump is not posi- 
tive, but relies entirely 
on the alternate compres- 
sion and expansion of the 
air in the air-chamber to 
secure a steady flow. 
As shown in Fig, 117, 
the secondary cylinder in 
this particular type is 
placed at a set length 
below the platform, usu- 
ally five feet. The lower 
cylinder may be any dis- 
tance below the upper 
cylinder, it being neces- 
sary only to lengthen the 
pipe and the plunger rod. 
This pump is adapted, 
then, to wells of any 
depth. In many cases 
the lower cylinder is placed beneath the water ; in such a position 
the valve leathers never dry out and priming is never necessary. 
All of the piping, including the air-chamber which forms the 
standard of the pump, may be of either galvanized iron or black 
wrought iron. The galvanized-iron piping is slightly the more 
expensive, adding about 50 cents to the cost of the pump with N EN

set-length pipes, but it is considered to be worth the extra cost. 
The size of the pipe varies with the depth of the well and with the 
size of the cylinder. For less than 30 ft. in depth a 3}-inch 
cylinder and a 14-inch pipe is used ; from 30 ft. to 40 ft. in depth, 
a 3-inch cylinder and a 14-inch pipe ; from 40 ft. to 50 ft. in depth, 
a 24-inch cylinder and a 1-inch pipe. Some manufacturers use a 
1-inch pipe for nearly all conditions, A 2}-inch lower cylinder is 
usually fitted with a 14-inch 
upper cylinder, and a 3}- 
inch lower cylinder with a 
2-inch upper cylinder. 
The pump shown in 
Fig. 117 is fitted with an 
adjustable base. This is a 
decided advantage when the trepeceota 
position of the set length  ™"*" 
is fixed, since no exact cut- 
ting of pipe is necessary in 
order to make a fixed base 
meet the platform properly. 
The eccentric lever on the 
pump spout controls a three- 
way valve at the point where 
the underground-pipe con- 
nection is made, so_ that 
water may be forced under- 
ground or delivered at the 
spout. Many of these force FIG. 119. Showing the construction of a

pumps are so made that it 
is possible, by unscrewing a cap at the base of the upper cylinder, 
to remove the plungers of both cylinders without disconnecting 
any of the pipes, provided the pump is in a shallow well and the 
lower cylinder attached directly to the set-length pipes. 
The rotary pump. The rotary pump, one type of which is 
shown in Fig. 119, operates on the same principle as the plunger 
pump, with each tooth of the gears, or cams, acting as a piston. 
The parts are made of iron or bronze. The cams are usually 
well fitted and work with little friction. This pump is particularly    
 
-P-A-G-E-196
184 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
adapted to lifting dirty water for irrigation purposes, since sand 
or other foreign matter does not readily interfere with its operation. 
It is not commonly used as a well pump, yet on lifts not ex- 
ceeding 25 ft. it is very efficient, requires little power, and will 
work against a pressure of from Io Ib. to 50 lb., which is equiva- 
lent to a head of from 23 ft. to 115 ft. The capacity of such a 
type as shown in Fig. 119 varies from 5 gal. to 12 gal. per minute 
when the pump is operated

this casing is lowered a 14-inch casing, and just outside of the 
1}-inch casing is lowered another pipe # in. in diameter which en- 
ters the 14-inch casing near the bottom. When compressed air is 
turned into the 3-inch pipe, it flows into the water-pipe ; and since 
the pressure at the base of this pipe is exactly the same outside as 
inside, the compressed air, which enters the pipe a short distance 
above the bottom, tends to rise and forces up a column of water 
above it. The passage of the air upward creates a suction, another 
column of water flows in to fill the space, and a column of air 
falls in behind it, forcing it to the top of the pipe. Thus, there

water enters through a flap valve. The 
chamber around the cylinder is always 
filled with water ; hence the valve leathers

manufacturers say that there is almost 
no limit to the horizontal distance.

the same time the weight is raised. As the water in the tank 
is lowered, the valve in the water-pipe will gradually open and 
allow the water to flow into the tank, the hydraulic cylinder will 
resume its original position, and the weight will pull the mill back 
into gear. This feature is especially desirable if the well is at 
a considerable distance from the house. There is no reason why 
it should not operate in a satisfactory manner for several years if 
the float is kept in order and so protected that the stock cannot 
interfere with its action. A safety plug is provided in the bottom 
of the hydraulic cylinder which, in case any part of the device 
should fail to work, will be blown out and thus will prevent any 
material damage to the pump.

CHAPTER XIII 
WINDMILLS 
The windmill is now used almost exclusively in the operation 
of pumps, though its usefulness is not confined entirely to this 
work. Since it makes use of the wind as a motive power, it is 
unquestionably one of the most economical machines available 
within its more or less limited field. The small gasoline engine 
is its only competitor, and 
elsewhere in this text the 
two are compared as to 
their value in pumping 
water. Though already in 
use in very large num- 
bers, the windmill should 
be more common, because 
it is a real labor-saver and 
within the reach of nearly 
all farmers.

The strain comes between 2 bearings post or 4-post tower made 
of galvanized angle steel. 
The 4-post structure is to be preferred as offering a better sup- 
port for the wheel, though it is slightly more expensive than the 
3-post tower. Wood towers, though once common, are seldom 
used now. The height of the tower varies from 10 ft. to 100 ft. 
It should be high enough to raise the wheel above the level of 
all objects such as buildings, windbreaks, and hills, within 500 ft. 
of the mill. A clear and unobstructed sweep of the wind is 
essential to the mill’s proper operation. 
The foundation of the tower posts should be of concrete. 
Footings for the posts are furnished, and they should be set at 
188 
   
-P-A-G-E-201
  
WINDMILLS 189 
least five feet in the ground, with the holes into which they are 
laced filled with concrete. If the footings are not provided with 
broad steel bases, the posts should 
be anchored to rods placed across 
the holes and covered with concrete. 
The wheel. The wheel consists 
of a steel framework upon which are 
mounted the sails, which may be of 
either wood or steel, the latter be- 
ing most generally used. The sails 
are set at an angle to the plane of 
the wheel. This angle varies from 
twenty to thirty degrees and is 
known as the angle of weather. 
There is a wide variation in the 
width of sail, though the wider sail, 
HiGurzoMehimines sears amine measuring some twelve inches, 
end of the shaft seems to be more generally used. 
The strain comes on the end of the A rudder, or vane, is nearly al- 
shaft which has only one bearing | ways provided, its purpose being to 
keep the plane of the wheel perpendicular to the direction of the 
wind, thus realizing 
the greatest force pos- 
sible from the wind’s 
velocity. If the wheel 
has no rudder, the sails 
are so constructed as to 
present automatically 
a greater or less sur- 
face to the wind, this 
surface varying with 
the wind’s velocity. 
Gears. The shaft 
of the wheel must be F!6 127. Windmill having a bent crank ana a 
rocker arm instead of gears   
        
    supported upon long, 
well-constructed bear-

is transmitted from the shaft to the pump rod either directly, Note the brake around the end wheel 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
through a pitman-wheel connection, when it is known as a direct 
connected mill, or indirectly, through spur gears, when it is known 
as a back-geared will. 
As the latter term signi- 
fies, the speed of the 
wheel is reduced, the 
ratio varying from 1:1 
to 1:5. The purpose in 
back-gearing a mill is to 
permit the wheel to re- 
volve more rapidly and 
still not operate the pump 
at more than thirty or 
forty strokes per minute. 
In the direct-connected 
mill the wheel must be 
so governed as to be 
thrown out of gear when only a moderate speed is reached, else 
the pump will be ruined by too rapid working. The back- 
geared wheel, because of its possible higher speed, is capable of 
developing more power than 
the direct-connected type, 
though the latter will pump 
faster in light breezes. 
Fig. 125 shows a_ back- 
geared mill with liberal bear- 
ings on either side of the 
gears, with the pump rod be- 
tween. This represents good 
construction and is superior

a pump should not be operated at a faster rate than forty strokes 
per minute, it is very necessary to have some device on the wheel 
that will keep the speed within a proper limit. Such a device is

regulator operated by a float 
  velocity, thus exposing more 
or less surface to the driving 
force of the wind. 
During a high wind, when 
the wheel tends to turn into 
a plane parallel to the wind’s 
direction and thus to be 
thrown out of gear, the gov- 
ernor, usually a long coiled 
spring, operates to hold the 
wheel toward the wind at a 
proper angle to secure the de- 
sired speed. The tension of 
this spring can usually be con- 
trolled so as to regulate the   
  speed to the work which the mill has to do, In Fig. 128 the 
lower cut shows the rudder in a position to hold the wheel in a 
plane at right angles to the wind’s direction. As the velocity of 
the wind increases the wheel tends 
to turn toward the rudder, thus plac- 
ing the coiled spring under tension 
as shown in the upper figure. As 
the velocity of the wind decreases 
the coiled spring draws the wheel 
back into the wind. 
A brake, usually in the form of a 
steel band surrounding the rim of 
one of the gears (Fig. 129), locks 
the wheel when it is out of gear so 
there will be no movement of wheel 
or pump. Automatic regulators may 
be attached to any mill by means of 
which, through a float connection 
with a near-by tank, it may be auto- 
matically thrown out of gear when 
the tank is filled and thrown in gear

when the water in the tank is lowered. The regulator of Fig. 130 
operates as follows: The arm of the ratchet wheel is attached to 
  
  
  the pump rod shown on the left, 
the vertical wire passes around the 
ratchet reel and up to the rudder. 
The horizontal wire (at the top) is 
connected to the float in the tank. 
When the tank is empty the float 
is down, the weighted lever is up, 
and the dogs are held out of en- 
gagement with the ratchet wheel. 
As the float rises in the tank the 
weighted lever drops and the dogs 
are permitted to engage the ratchet 
wheel. This wheel, then, operated 
by the pump rod throws the mill

and line-shaft connections of a out of gear. As soon as the float 
is lowered the mill is permitted to 
be drawn into gear. 
Power from windmills. The power to be derived from a wind- 
mill depends directly upon the force of the wind impinging upon 
the sails of the wheel. 
Since the force of the 
wind varies as the square 
of the velocity and since 
the amount striking the 
wheel varies directly as 
the velocity, theoretically 
the power of the wheel 
should vary as the cube of 
the wind’s velocity, the 
size of the wheel remain- 
ing the same. For wheels 
of different diameters, 
then, the power developed 
should vary as the cube of 
  Fic. 133. A vaneless wheel 
The wind blows from the side of the vane arm, and 
the force of a high wind on the ends of the sails 
closes the wheel. The weight opens the wheel as 
the velocity of the wind decreases 
the wind’s velocity and as the square of the diameter of the 
wheel, since surfaces vary as the square of like dimensions.
-P-A-G-E-205
  WINDMILLS 193 
Smeaton’s experiments seemed to show this to be the case, but 
later tests indicate that in practice the power varies as the square 
of the velocity of the wind and as one and one-fourth times the 
diameter of the wheel. 
The latter ratio is, 
quite naturally, cut 
down in the larger 
wheels because of the 
heavier construction 
necessary to withstand 
the added strain. 
The following table 
is given as a basis of 
judgment as to the Fic.134. Raising a windmill by means of a tackle

For pumping purposes the 6-foot and 8-foot wheels are the 
most common. On the basis of pumping at the rate of 5 gal. per 
minute, which is a reasonable rate, through a vertical lift of 100 ft., 
a theoretical horse power of 0.12 would be required. Doubling 
this to get the working horse power required, gives 0.25, which,
-P-A-G-E-206
    
  194 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
according to the above table, would require an 8-foot wheel and 
a 15-mile wind. These figures accord with common practice. 
Use of the windmill. As before mentioned, the use of the 
windmill is confined almost exclusively to the pumping of water. 
For this purpose it is 
fairly reliable if suffi- 
cient storage is pro- 
vided when live stock 
is kept. Sufficient 
water should be stored 
to last at least three 
days. 
The windmill is used 
in a limited way for 
grinding feed and 
for running machines, 
such as grindstones, lathes, shellers, etc., if one is prepared to do 
the work when the wind is blowing. It has been used in a few 
instances for running a dy- 
namo to generate an electric 
current, but difficulty in main- 
taining a uniform speed will 
probably prevent its wide use 
in this way. For small power 
purposes it never will suc- 
cessfully compete with the 
gasoline engine. 
Care of the windmill. While 
the windmill needs but little 
care and attention, it needs 
that little very much. Lubri- 
cation is the one thing that 
should not be neglected. The 
automatic oilers provided with 
the better mills should be 
regularly filled. A few mills 
are now so made that the gears run in an oil bath. All nuts in 
the framework and the wheel should be kept tight.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE HYDRAULIC RAM 
In all sections of the country where a rolling topography pre- 
vails, many springs are to be found near farmsteads, but situated 
at a level considerably below that of the buildings. Frequently 
the only source of water for the house is just such a spring, and 
too often the duty of carrying the daily supply falls on the women 
of the household. Or it may be that at some distance from 
the barn there is a stream of relatively pure water flowing in 
abundance and that the water of this stream could be profitably 
used in barns or yards if the water could be easily and economi- 
cally got to them. The hydraulic ram, which is serviceable in 
just such situations as these, may be described as a type of pump 
or engine which utilizes the power derived from a large part of 
the water of a flowing stream to lift a small part of this water 
and deliver it at some point above the level of the stream itself 
and at some distance from it if desired. 
The essential parts. The essential parts of a hydraulic ram 
are shown in Fig. 137, which is a diagrammatic cross section 
of a ram. The base G 
of the ram affords the 
framework on which the 
other parts are built and 
receives the water from 
the supply pipe A, which 
connects with the spring 
or other source of sup- 
ply. The air-chamber C 
is mounted on the base, 
with the check valve D connecting the two. Leading from the 
air-chamber is the delivery pipe #, connecting with the point of 
discharge. The waste valve B leads from the base and, in its 
195         
  Fic. 137. Diagrammatic section of a 
hydraulic ram  
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
natural position, is open, as shown. At F is a small snifting 
valve, which opens inward from outside pressure at a certain 
phase of each stroke. There are only three moving parts about 
a ram — the waste valve, the snifting valve, and the check valve. 
There are several types of valves, some of which will be shown 
later. Many rams do not have the snifting valve. 
The operation. The operation of the ram is as follows: The 
water from the spring or other source of supply flows down 
the pipe A, which is laid with considerable fall, and entering the 
chamber G flows out through the waste valve 4, which is open. 
This flowing water soon attains a considerable momentum, and, 
pushing up on the waste valve, closes it. The escape here being 
suddenly shut off, the water lifts the check valve D and enters 
the chamber C. As the flow into C continues, the air in the 
chamber is compressed. Soon the pressure overbalances the 
force of the incoming water and the flow ceases. Just at this 
point there is a rebound, or backward surge, in the base of the 
ram and in the supply pipe, as there is when one object strikes 
another. At this instant the pressure below the waste valve is 
sufficiently decreased to permit it to open and allow the supply 
water to escape. Flow past the waste valve will continue until 
there is sufficient force to close the valve; then the above action 
is repeated. The operation is entirely automatic, and gives an 
intermittent flow at the point of delivery, the intermittency cor- 
responding to the cycles, or beats, of the waste valve. 
The general installation. The general conditions required for 
the successful installation of the ram are set forth in Fig. 138. 
The ram itself is placed some distance down the stream from 
the source of supply and usually in a pit A, as shown. The supply 
water comes from the pool shown at #, through the supply pipe 
C. The length of this pipe, which must be laid with consider- 
able fall, must bear a definite relation to the height to which 
the water is to be lifted, and its size must be proportionate to the 
amount of water available and to the size of the ram used. The 
delivery pipe Z, which leads to the point of delivery, be it an ele- 
vated tank at the barn, a watering-trough, or a tank in the kitchen 
sink, bears a definite relation in size to the supply pipe. The 
vertical and horizontal length of the delivery pipe is limited by
-P-A-G-E-209
  
THE HYDRAULIC RAM 197 
the total fall of the supply pipe, the amount of water available, 
and the amount desired at the point of delivery. 
The source of supply. As before noted, the water to operate the 
ram must come from a flowing stream, a spring, or an artesian well. 
Whatever the source of supply, there must be a basin constructed 
in which a constant supply of water may be maintained. If a 
spring furnishes the supply it is usually a simple matter to build 
a containing-basin of brick or concrete. A barrel or a twenty- 
four-inch sewer-pipe tile, sunk below the surface, will furnish an 
adequate chamber ; or an earth bank may be thrown up and made 
  Fic. 138. Showing the requirements for the installation of a ram 
to hold a sufficient supply, but the earth bank is not so permanent 
and does not afford adequate protection to the water. 
If a stream furnishes the supply, care must be taken to protect 
from overflows the basin from which the supply is taken, as sedi- 
ment and trash are likely to be washed in. In this case it is well 
to build a containing-basin to one side of the stream and to con- 
nect the two by a short line of tile or pipe. The basin can then 
be covered, and high water does not interfere with the operation 
of the ram. In the case of flowing wells it is possible to connect 
the supply pipe directly to the casing of the well by suitable 
connections, forcing the entire flow through the ram. If the 
water is delivered from the well under considerable force, this 
force is equivalent to a head equal to the distance the water 
would rise in a standpipe, and the ram may be placed near the 
well and on a level with it. The essential feature in all cases is 
to maintain a constant supply which will not become sufficiently 
roiled to permit silt or sand to enter the pipe.

The supply pipe. The supply pipe should be laid on an even 
grade from the basin to the ram, without bends or elbows except 
where it enters the ram base. Here the pipe should be bent on 
a smooth curve, no connections being used. The mouth of the 
pipe should be placed at least one foot below low-water level in 
the basin. This is necessary to prevent air from entering the pipe 
and stopping the ram. The end of the pipe should be further 
protected by a strainer, or screen, to keep out sand and sedi- 
ment. The length of the supply pipe should be just about equal 
to the vertical height to which the water is to be lifted; that is, 
if the water is lifted to a tank 4o ft. above the ram, the length 
of the supply pipe running from the basin to the ram should be

Fic. 139. Showing how the total head may be realized when the ram is at a 
considerable distance from the spring 
40 ft. In cases of short lifts, however, the length of the supply 
pipe should not be less than from eight to ten times the total 
fall, where the fall is 5 ft. or less. For example, if the water 
is to be delivered to a height of 15 ft., by the rule stated above, 
a drive pipe 15 ft. long would be required. However, this is not 
sufficient for a fall of 5 ft. or less. If the fall were 5 ft., the 
drive pipe should be 8 x 5, or 4o ft. long. 
In many installations it will be found necessary to go down- 
stream quite a distance from the supply basin in order to secure 
the proper fall. Suppose, for example, it becomes necessary to 
go a distance of 200 ft. downstream in order to secure a fall of 
4 ft. The total lift is to be, say, 40 ft. Proper regulations would 
call for a drive pipe 4o ft. long. Now if the flow from the 
spring is small, too much of the force due to the total head 
would be used up in friction arising from the passage through 
the 200 ft. of pipe, so that the effective head at the ram would 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE HYDRAULIC RAM 199 
be very much less than 4 ft.—so much less, in fact, that the ram 
would not operate. This difficulty is overcome by a device such 
as that shown in Fig. 139. In the instance above referred to, the 
standpipe would be connected to the supply pipe at the proper 
distance, 40 ft., from the ram. The water rises in this pipe to 
the same level as the water in the spring, thus giving the full 
force of the total head to the operation of the ram. This stand- 
pipe may be a short pipe a little larger than the supply pipe 
and connected to it by a T-connection, or it may be a barrel 
sunk in the ground with the supply pipe from it to the ram con- 
nected in the ordinary way. The pipe from the spring to the 
standpipe should be somewhat larger than the drive pipe proper. 
The size of the supply pipe is governed by the flow of the 
spring and by the quantity of water it is desired to deliver. The 
smallest size that it is desirable to use is {-inch pipe; it is found 
on No. 2 rams, which require from 2 to 3 gal. per minute to 
operate them. For ordinary farm purposes the largest size is 
usually 2 in.; it is found on No, 6 rams, which require from 5 to 
12 gal. per minute to operate them. A gate valve should be placed 
in this line next to the ram so that the water may be turned off 
in case the ram needs repairs. 
The fall. The fall, or head, is the difference between the 
level of the feed water and the point at which it enters the ram, 
and is designated by / in Fig. 138. As a general rule this should 
be 1 ft. for each 7 ft. of vertical rise in the discharge pipe, with 
a minimum fall of from 2 to 3 ft. no matter how small the 
vertical lift. This fall too should not greatly exceed the maximum 
required by the lift, as an undue strain will be put upon the ram. 
The delivery pipe. The delivery, or discharge, pipe shown at 
& in Fig. 138 is usually one half the diameter of the supply pipe. 
This pipe is laid according to the rules for laying all water-pipes, 
that is, with as few elbows and turns as possible, because each 
elbow increases the friction in the pipe and cuts down the total 
efficiency of the ram. It may be laid on a gradual incline, as is 
usually the case; it may extend horizontally the desired distance 
and then rise vertically ; or, it may first rise vertically and then 
extend horizontally to the desired place. In case of extremely 
high lifts or long horizontal distances this pipe should be made
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
larger than one half the diameter of the supply pipe in order to 
reduce friction. A gate valve should be placed in this line next 
to the air-chamber. 
The pit. The ram is usually placed in a pit built of bricks or 
concrete. This is done chiefly as a protection in freezing weather. 
The pit may be covered with a concrete or plank covering, and 
if the weather becomes very severe, additional protection, such as 
corn fodder, horse manure, etc., may be provided. In this way 
the operation of the ram is not interfered with in the least by 
cold weather. 
Frequently, if the fall is slight, an increase may be secured by 
placing the ram in a pit and then providing a drain, Fig. 138, D, 
for taking care of the waste water. If the pit were not provided, 
it would be necessary to go so far downstream that the increased 
friction in the pipe would more than equal the head gained. 
The drain for the waste water is, of course, necessary, whatever 
the purpose for which the ram is placed in a pit. 
The valves. As before stated, the waste valve and the check 
valve represent the only moving parts about the ram. The 
snifting valve is, of course, a moving part, but so little wear is 
occasioned by its action that it may be disregarded so far as 
wear is concerned. 
The waste valve is frequently made of iron throughout and 
rests on an iron seat as well. This sort of valve is efficient and 
wears well, but is rather noisy, and for that reason is not desir- 
able if the ram is located where noise might be an objection. 
Other valves are leather-covered or rubber-covered. This de- 
creases the noise materially and, though the wear is more rapid, 
the parts are cheaply replaced. Fig. 140, 4, shows the construction 
of a rubber-covered valve. In Fig. 140 the waste valve is seen 
to hang from an arm pivoted near the middle, at P, and working 
on an adjustable bolt at O, where the length of the vertical lift 
of the valve may be controlled. The full vertical travel is about 
one inch. Tests have been made which show that the highest 
efficiency is reached when the working stroke is about 60 per 
cent of the full vertical lift of the valve. The weight W on the 
arm supporting the valve is adjustable; it may be so moved as 
to increase or decrease the force required to close the valve and
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE HYDRAULIC RAM 201 
hence increase or decrease the frequency of the cycle. The proper 
adjustment of this weight, as well as the length of the stroke, 
depends upon the quantity of water passing through the ram 
and upon the quantity of water desired at the point of delivery. 
An adjustment should be made that will permit a smooth, steady 
stroke. The more frequent the strokes, the less the amount of 
water delivered; and conversely, the slower the beat, the more 
water delivered. 
The check valve leading to the air-chamber may, like the waste 
valve, be of iron throughout, or it may be covered with leather or 
rubber. There is not so much wear on this valve as on the waste 
valve, but it should be easily accessible in case it needs replacing. 
The snifting valve (Fig. 137, /) is for the purpose of keeping 
the air-chamber supplied with the proper amount of air. When 
water is forced into the air-chamber against considerable pressure 
a certain amount of air is absorbed. If additional air is not 
supplied in some way, the water soon fills the chamber completely, 
and the chamber fails to serve the purpose for which it was in- 
tended — that of equalizing the flow at the point of delivery. 
The snifting valve is placed close to the check valve and in the 
base of the ram, opening to the outside. At each backward surge 
of the water, as previously explained, a partial vacuum is created; 
the result is that a small amount of air is drawn through this 
valve and at the next impulse is carried into the air-chamber. 
Thus the air supply is automatically controlled. 
Starting the ram. After the ram is installed and before any 
pipes are covered, all pipes in the system should be filled with 
water and tests made for leaks, After the system has been 
tested and the pipes covered, the supply pipe should be opened; 
water will at once begin to flow through the waste valve. This 
valve should then be operated by hand, with regular beats at the 
rate of about fifty per minute, until the ram and all the pipes 
are filled; then the valve should begin to operate automatically. 
When the ram is new this valve is likely to stick occasionally 
and may need close attention for a few days. 
Ram troubles. If the ram ceases to operate, several things 
may be at fault. If the water in the supply basin has fallen 
below the mouth of the supply pipe, permitting air to enter the 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
202 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
ram, action will cease, and the ram must be started by hand. If 
silt or sand gets into the ram the valves may not seat properly, 
and the ram either will cease to work or will work imperfectly. 
The ram should be thoroughly flushed and both valves and valve 
seats cleaned. The valves may become so worn as to fail to hold 
properly. In this case the ram will begin to work imperfectly 
and finally will stop altogether. New valves should be put in. 
If the snifting valve is not working properly or if there is none, 
as is sometimes the case, the air-chamber will fill with water, 
and the ram will then cease to operate. In such a case the 
air-chamber should be drained by a plug usually provided for that 
purpose, and allowed to fill with air, after which the ram should 
be started by hand. If no plug is provided, it will be necessary to 
remove the air-chamber and allow it to fill with air. The supply 
pipe will sometimes become so filled with foreign substances, 
such as an incrustation on the walls, that the flow is decreased 
and the ram stops. This, however, does not often happen. 
The size of the ram. The size of the ram is governed by the 
flow of the spring or other source of supply and by the amount 
of water desired at the point of delivery. Table XX, which is 
furnished by a reliable pump company, gives the sizes adapted to 
ordinary farm use, together with the proper size for supply and 
delivery pipes and the quantity of water required for operation. 
While the number given to each size may be taken as a standard, 
yet a ram of the same size may be differently numbered by dif- 
ferent companies. The quantity of water required to operate the 
ram should be the guide to size.

THE HYDRAULIC RAM 203 
Efficiency of the ram. As was said in the beginning of this 
chapter, the hydraulic ram uses the power derived from a large 
part of the water of a flowing stream to lift a small part of the 
water to some point above. The quantity of water lifted- varies 
directly with the fall. That is, with a fall of 4 ft., approximately 
twice as much water will be delivered to a given height as with 
a fall of 2 ft. Further, the quantity delivered varies inversely as 
the height to which it is to be raised. That is, other things being 
equal, if 6 gal. per minute are delivered to a height of 10 ft., 
3 gal. would be delivered to a height of 20 ft. and 2 gal. would 
be delivered to a height of 30 ft. 
The last two statements are made on the theoretical basis that if 
the fall is doubled, twice as much power will be available ; and that 
hence twice as much water will be delivered provided the height of 
lift remains the same. On the other hand, if the fall remains the 
same, the same power is available, so that if the lift is doubled, 
trebled, etc., the quantity lifted will be decreased by one half, one 
third, etc. Practical results will not vary greatly from these rules, but 
there are limitations, of course, beyond which a ram will not work. 
As a working rule, a ram can be counted upon to lift to a 
reasonable height only from one tenth to one seventh of the total 
quantity delivered to the ram. Table XXI gives the relation that 
should exist between the length of supply and discharge pipes 
and the minimum quantity of water required to operate the speci- 
fied sizes under the fall indicated, together with the quantity that 
will be delivered, the specifications being those at which the ram 
will reach its highest efficiency.

  204 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
By the aid of Tables XX and XXI it is possible to select the 
proper size of ram for any condition, as well as the proper size 
of supply and delivery pipes. If, for example, a spring flows 
4 gal. per minute and it is desired to lift the water vertically 40 ft. 
under a 5 ft. fall, by turning to Table XX one can see that either 
ram No. 3 or No. 4 will operate on this amount. From Table XXI 
it is seen that ram No. 3 works most efficiently at a lift of 30 ft. 
and that ram No. 4 gives the highest efficiency at a 40-foot lift. 
It is clear, therefore, that, although the No. 3 ram will work, a 
No. 4 should be chosen. Table XX shows that the No. 4 ram 
calls for a 1}-inch drive pipe and a }-inch delivery pipe, and 
from Table X XI it will be seen that a ram of this size will deliver 
about 20 gal. per hour. 
The second column in Table XXI, giving the height of de- 
livery for each size, does not represent the maximum height to 
which these sizes will lift the water. It is never advisable, how- 
ever, to use the very small sizes for high lifts. 
While it may seem, at first thought, that a spring flowing, say, 
3 gal. per minute will not supply an adequate amount for house 
and barn use if only one tenth of it can be delivered, yet the fact 
that the flow is constant, day in and day out, through the year 
should not be forgotten. For instance, the above-mentioned flow 
means 21.6 bbl. of 50 gal. each, or more than 1000 gal., per day. 
Life and utility of the ram. There is practically no limit to 
the life of a ram. The moving parts are easily and cheaply 
replaceable. In many cases rams have given continuous service 
for over twenty years. The ram may be installed to lift water 
into an elevated tank at the house or barn or into a pneumatic 
tank if the lift is not too great. In this case it should be re- 
membered that in pumping against the pressure of a pneumatic 
tank 2.3 ft. should be added to the vertical lift for each pound 
of pressure registered by the tank gauge. For example, if it is 
desired to force water into the tank until the gauge shows 25 lb., 
it would be necessary to make allowance for a lift equivalent to 
2.3 times 25, or 57.5 ft., in addition to the lift from the ram 
to the tank. Near Dayton, Ohio, there is an installation where 
a ram pumps water into a pneumatic tank maintaining a pres- 
sure of 70 Ib, When this pressure is reached, a safety valve is
-P-A-G-E-217
THE HYDRAULIC RAM 205 
released and the water flows o through a waste pipe. The 
spring supplying this ram is of course a very strong one. 
The ram may also be used to lift water into a small tank on 
the kitchen sink, from which it may flow to the milk-house, to 
troughs at the barn, etc. Though it is possible to stop the ram at 
any time by holding the waste valve shut for a short time, it is 
better to let it run continuously if the water is available. If, how- 
ever, it is necessary to stop the ram, a wire for such purpose may 
be attached to the waste 
valve and the valve ma- 
nipulated from the house. 
The double-acting ram. 
It frequently happens that 
a spring flowing such a 
small amount of water 
that it would not operate 
a ram under the usual 
conditions is located close 
beside a stream the water 
from which is not fit for 
human consumption. The 
double-acting ram is de- 
signed to make use of the Delivery Pipe

shown in Fig. 140 and a

which is supplied by the stream, flows down the supply pipe & 
and operates the ram exactly as heretofore described, considering 
the valve at H, Fig. 140, closed. The pipe D, Fig. 141, should be 
laid to a fall of not more than two feet; if the fall is more than 
this or if the spring is at some distance from the ram, a standpipe 
£& should be erected next to the ram, If this is made the proper 
height, any excess fall is eliminated, and any undue friction is 
overcome. Water must rise in the standpipe at least two feet.  
-P-A-G-E-218
  206 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Now after the ram has begun to operate on the stream water 
it will be seen that at the time.of the backward surge which 
occurs during each beat of the ram, just following the time when 
the check valve (Z, Fig. 140) closes, a small amount of spring 
water enters this partial vacuum, forced in, in part, by the two- 
foot head. On the next beat of the ram this spring water, being 
next to the main check valve leading into the air-chamber, and

check valve this action is repeated. Undoubtedly some of the 
spring water escapes through the waste valve, as shown in the 
figure ; but the amount thus escaping is very slight and nearly all 
of the spring water is lifted to the point of delivery. 
Only a few companies manufacture double-acting rams. One of 
the largest hydraulic-ram companies, however, claims that 25 per 
cent of its business is with this kind of ram. They are slightly 
. More expensive than the single-acting type.

CHAPTER XV 
POWER FROM STREAMS 
In the rolling sections of the United States there are many 
streams, some large, some small, which are flowing under condi- 
tions that would make it possible for them to develop a consider- 
able amount of power if properly harnessed. It is the purpose of 
this chapter to discuss conditions which must exist before power 
installations are possible and to refer to the various water-wheels 
commonly used in farm installations. 
Source of power of a stream. A stream is capable of develop- 
ing power because of the fact that its head, or fall, causes its 
water to flow at a certain velocity. In the usual installations a 
dam is built across the stream, and the water is confined and 
made to flow over the dam or through a side channel or mill 
race in which the flow may be controlled. The head is the 
distance from the level of the water above the dam to the level 
of the water below the dam. 
How to determine flow and head. In order to determine 
whether or not it is possible to obtain a sufficient amount of 
power to make an installation 
worth while, it is necessary to 
make a fairly accurate deter- 
mination of the volume of 
flow and the possible head. v 
The volume of flow may be Fic. 142. Method of finding the average 
determined by the float method depth of a stream 
or by the weir method. The average depth here equals 8+ 18 + 20412 
ei divided by 4+1= 11.6 in. The float method, which is 
as follows, will give only an approximate result. A representative 
section is selected, and the depth is measured at several points at 
equal distances apart on the same line across the stream. The 
sum of these figures divided by the number of measurements plus 
207   
  
  
    
  
   
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
one is the average depth of the stream at this point. The method 
is illustrated in Fig. 142. The velocity is secured by measuring 
off a given distance, say, two hundred feet, throwing a cork or 
chip into the middle of the stream, and observing the time it 
takes to cover the measured distance. Two or three trials should 
be made and the average taken. Inasmuch as there is a great 
deal of friction along the sides and bottom of the stream, the 
mean velocity has been found to be only about 0.8 of the surface 
velocity. It is necessary, therefore, to multiply the velocity as 
determined above, by this factor, to obtain the mean velocity of 
the stream. The cross-sectional area in square feet multiplied by 
the velocity in feet per minute will give the flow of the stream in 
cubic feet per minute. 
O= a0, 
where Q=discharge in cubic feet per minute, 
a=cross-sectional area in square feet, 
v = velocity in feet per minute. 
The weir method should be used to determine the volume of 
flow if accuracy is desired. Fig. 143 shows the method of con- 
structing a weir. The 
notch is cut beveled, as 
shown, so as to afford 
as little resistance as 
possible to the passage 
of water. The width 
Fic. 143. The weir method as used to determine of| the’ notch 2 should 
the volume of flow of streams be about two thirds the 
height of the weir dam. 
The ends of the plank must of course be embedded in the banks 
and bottom of the stream so that all the water will flow through 
the notch. 
It is necessary now only to measure the head that is forcing 
the water through the notch. It will be noticed that the surface 
of the water as it flows through the weir slopes toward the notch 
and that the depth of the water is not so great at the weir as it 
is a few feet upstream. To measure the real head, then, some 
six feet back from the weir a stake should be driven, the top of 
  a
-P-A-G-E-221
POWER FROM STREAMS 209 
which should be exactly level with the bottom of the notch. The 
depth of water flowing through the weir may then be measured 
by holding a rule on the top of the stake as the water is flowing 
normally, The depth of the water and the width of the weir 
being known, the volume of flow is 
O=3.33X Wx hVh, 
where Q = discharge in cubic feet per second, 
W = width of notch, in feet, 
i = depth, in feet, flowing over weir. 
The head, or fall, is determined by the height of the dam. 
The height to which it will be possible to dam the stream de- 
pends upon the nature and height of the banks and upon the 
slope of the stream bed. The latter may easily be determined 
by means of a drainage level; or, if this is not at hand, an ordi- 
nary carpenter’s level may be used. If such a level is fastened 
to the top of a stake some three or four feet long and succes- 
sive measurements taken, the total fall available for the conditions 
presented may be found. With the flow and head of the stream 
thus accurately determined, the theoretical horse power may be 
figured by the following formula : 
    
Theoretical horse power = nets Be 33000 
where Q = flow in cubic feet per minute, 
62.4 = weight of one cubic foot, 
i = total head, in feet. 
As an illustration let the following conditions be assumed: In 
measuring a stream by the weir method the notch in the weir 
was found to be 6 ft. wide and the depth of flow 1 ft. If it is 
possible to erect a dam 10 ft. high, what theoretical horse power 
will the stream develop ? 
Q=3.33X6X IVI 
= 19:98. 
Theoretical horse power = spi a0 Ne 33000 
= 22,660; 
   
-P-A-G-E-222
  210 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Inasmuch as water-wheels will develop about 80 per cent of 
the theoretical horse power, such a stream has a sufficient flow 
and fall to make a. power plant worth while. 
There is a very common misconception as to the quantity of 
water required to develop even a small amount of power at a 
reasonable head. For example, a flow of three hundred and sixty 
gallons per minute, which, at first thought, would be considered 
a heavy flow, would have to fall through a head of eleven feet 
to develop one theoretical horse power. Hence the necessity of 
carefully measuring streams when the installation of a power 
plant is contemplated. 
WATER-WHEELS 
Water-wheels are resorted to as a means of harnessing a stream 
so that the water may be made to do useful work. Though there 
are a large number of 
different kinds of water- 
wheels available, there are 
only three which are used 
to any extent in small farm 
installations ; namely, the 
overshot wheel, the tur- 
bine wheel, and the im- 
pulse wheel. 
The overshot wheel.

wheels. It has, however, much to recommend it, and one com- 
pany in particular is manufacturing this wheel on a large scale. 
The wheel is giving satisfaction in small farm plants. Fig. 144 
shows the general construction and the principle of operation. 
The water from the dam is delivered by appropriate means on 
top of the wheel just back of the center. Coming in at such 
   
-P-A-G-E-223
  
  POWER FROM STREAMS 211 
a point, the flowing water strikes the buckets with some force, 
tending to impart motion to the wheel by reason of the velocity 
of the flow. The greatest force exerted, however, is due to the 
weight of the water in the buckets, which, in the best forms of 
wheels, is carried from the highest to the lowest point of the 
wheel before it is discharged. 
The power to be derived from a wheel depends upon its diameter 
and its width, The former must be just about equal to the 
height of the dam ; the latter must 
be controlled by the flow of the 
stream. Wheels ranging from 1 ft. 
to 75 ft. in diameter, and from 
6 in. to 20 ft. in width, are made. 
As a rule, the bottom of the wheel 
should hang clear of the discharge 
water, owing to the increased fric- 
tion caused by the wheel’s running 
in backwater. The modern steel 
wheel, however, will stand a con- 
siderable amount of backwater 
without a very great decrease in 
efficiency. 
It will be seen that this wheel 
is large, heavy, somewhat cumber- 
some, and slow in speed. There 
is, further, some danger from 
clogging and freezing. On the 
other hand, the construction and 
installation are not complex, and 
the efficiency is high. Tests made on a steel wheel, at the 
University of Wisconsin, showed an efficiency as high as 92 per 
cent. In actual use such wheels should have an efficiency of 
80 per cent to 85 per cent. The overshot wheel is best adapted 
to medium or large flows and to medium heads. For small farm 
installations, where the head is from 6 ft. to, say, 12 ft., this 
wheel may well be given consideration. 
The turbine wheel. There are many different turbines on the 
market, the types differing chiefly in the manner in which the 
  Fic. 145. A skeleton view of a 
turbine wheel

  212 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
water is received and discharged. Fig. 145 illustrates the general 
principle upon which the turbine operates. The water enters from 
  
  
  Fic. 146. Showing the usual 
method of installing a turbine 
wheel under a small head 
The water flows in at the side of 
the submerged wheel and drops 
through into the tailrace the sides and imparts motion to the 
shaft by reason of the velocity with 
which it strikes the vanes. Further- 
more, the vanes are so shaped that 
the falling water tends to impart 
motion to them and hence to the 
shaft. These two features give rise 
to the names “impulse turbine’”’ and 
“reaction turbine.” 
Fig. 146 shows the general method 
of installing a turbine where the avail- 
able head is small. The turbine is 
contained within the box, or pen- 
stock, the water from the dam flowing 
directly into this box. Passing into 
and through the turbine, the water is 
discharged into the tailrace. The draft-tube, or lower portion of 
the turbine, projects 
into the tailrace water 
several inches, to as- 
sist in maintaining or 
creating suction for 
the discharge water. 
The total head is 
the distance from the 
water in the pen- 
stock to the water 
in the tailrace. The 
wheel is provided 
with gates by which 
the amount of water 
delivered to it may 
be readily controlled.

flow and the disposition of gears and line shafting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  POWER FROM STREAMS 213 
In comparison with the overshot wheel, the turbine is small 
and light in weight and runs at a high rate of speed. It is 
adapted to medium and large flows and to any head up to several 
thousand feet. One of the smallest wheels made by a leading 
company requires a head of 7 ft. and a flow of 384 cu. ft. per min- 
ute, and under these conditions it is claimed that it will develop 
4.1 horse power. The efficiency of the turbine varies a great 
deal with the conditions under which it operates, but ordinarily 
an efficiency of from 70 per cent to 80 per cent may be expected. 
The impulse wheel. The impulse wheel, a notable example of 
which is the Pelton, is adapted only to high heads and small flow. 
While frequently installed with a twenty-foot head, this type of 
wheel is usually found with a head of one hundred or more feet. 
The wheel is operated by water flowing from a nozzle under high 
pressure and impinging against the vanes of the wheel. It is 
small and light in weight and runs at a high speed. It has only 
an occasional application in rural plants. 
Use of water powers. The power developed by a water-wheel 
may be put to a number of uses. The wheel may be attached to 
a grinding-mill if the proper location can be secured, and, through 
a system of pulleys and shafting, may be used for other power 
purposes. Perhaps there is no more desirable or convenient use 
to which small water powers may be put than that of generating 
electric current for light or power. Even though the stream may 
be at a considerable distance from the house, the generator may 
be located at the wheel and both controlled from the house. If 
the power developed is great enough, electric motors may be in- 
stalled about the house or barn; and they are a most convenient 
source of power.

  CHAPTER XVI 
WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 
Every farm and farm home has some system of water supply, 
even if it is nothing more than a well with a common hand 
pump. This well is expected to furnish water for use at both house 
and barn. There is generally a cistern also, which is located at 
the house. In this chapter will be considered some of the 
possibilities open to every farmer whereby he may provide his 
home with an adequate and convenient water-supply system. 
While especial attention is given to the question of conveying water 
into the house, the barn is not neglected. 
The simpler systems will receive first consideration ; then the 
more extensive as well as the more expensive systems will be 
discussed, in the hope that some of the ideas presented may find 
application in many of our farm homes. While a complete hot- 
and-cold-water system is greatly to be desired, it is often neither 
practical nor wise to attempt its installation; available means 
should always determine the extent of the system to be chosen. 
It is too frequently the case, however, that while the barn equip- 
ment has been improved and added to, the housewife has been 
forced to worry along under most unsatisfactory conditions, not 
the least of which is the lack of a convenient water supply. 
The amount of water actually consumed per day about the 
barn can be quite accurately determined. It is estimated that a 
horse will consume 12 gal. a day; a cow, 10 gal.; a hog, 2 gal.; 
and a sheep, 1 gal. Where a house is equipped with a bathroom 
and attendant conveniences, there will be consumed an average 
of 20 gal. per day for each occupant of the house. This of 
course includes the allowance for laundry purposes. If the house 
is not equipped with a water-supply system of any kind, the 
water-consumption would probably amount to from 5 gal. to 8 gal. 
per day for each person. 
214
-P-A-G-E-227
  WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 215 
THE CISTERN 
Size. With very few exceptions every farm home has its cistern, 
In too many cases the cistern is much too small. There are two 
things which should determine the size of the cistern: (1) the 
roof area from which it will be filled, and (2) the amount of 
water that will be consumed. The average house presents a roof 
area of about 1000 sq. ft. The average monthly rainfall for Ohio 
is about 3} in. Allowing the 
} in. as waste, one month’s rain- 
fall will yield 1875 gal. from the 
average roof, A rainfall of 6 in. uA 
per month is not at all uncom- 1a? qT 
mon, in which case 3750 gal. 
would be caught if a cistern 
of adequate size were provided. 
A family of 6 persons using 
20 gal. each per day will con- 
sume 3600 gal. per month, or 
just about the equivalent of 6 in. 
of rainfall. A cistern should by 
all means hold one full month’s 
supply to tide over periods of 
drought. It is during times of 
drought that the most water is 
used, and some allowance should 
be made for this. It should be 
remembered too that the cistern Fie. 148. Section of a concrete cistern 
is never full at the beginning Note the construction and bracing of forms 
of the dry months. A cistern 
8 ft. in diameter and 8 ft. deep to the arch will hold 3000 gal. 
A cistern 8 ft. in diameter and 10 ft. deep to the arch will hold 
3760 gal., which is equivalent to 119.3 bbl. of 31.5 gal. each. 
A cistern of this size will be easily filled from the average 
roof and will furnish none too much water. The cistern ought 
to be no smaller than this — especially if the installation of a hot- 
and-cold-water system is contemplated, in which case the amount 
used will be materially increased. 24° Tile or

Materials. Cisterns are undoubtedly most easily built from 
brick. Concrete makes a cistern that is in many ways superior 
to one built of brick, but the building of forms often involves an 
additional expense for lumber and labor. If, however, old lumber 
is at hand for the forms and if sand and gravel can be obtained 
for the hauling, the concrete cistern may prove less expensive 
than any other kind. 
Fig. 148 shows a con- 
crete cistern in section, a 
sufficient amount of de- 
tail being shown to en-

may be hewed to shape, 
but sawing would be 
much easier. The inner 
form, as high as the 
arch, should be com- 
pletely set up and _ se- 
curely fastened across the 
top, so that the bottom 
and sides can be placed 
in one operation. The 
form for the arch should 
be all ready to place as

  Nothing but good Portland cement and clean sand and gravel 
or crushed rock should be used. If bank or creek gravel is used, 
it should be run over a 4-inch screen — the part passing through 
being used as sand; and the part running over, as coarse aggre- 
gate. The materials should then be mixed in the proportion of 
I part cement, 2 parts sand, and 4 parts gravel (see the chapter 
on concrete for details in mixing and placing). It is wise to 
reénforce the arch with No. 9 fence wires spaced 6 in. apart.
-P-A-G-E-229
  
WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 2177 
The forms should be left in place for from four to six days. 
When they are removed the surface should be painted with a 
thin cement wash to fill all air-holes and to secure smoothness. 
To build such a cistern as that shown in Fig. 148 there will 
be required

Fig. 149 shows a one-course drick cistern coated with cement 
plaster. This construction has the advantage over the concrete 
type in that no forms are required. It can be made perfectly 
water-tight and, all things considered, is perhaps more easily and 
readily constructed than the concrete cistern. 
The cost of materials for such a brick cistern would be approxi- 
mately as follows : 
2800 bricks @ $8.00 per M (if filter is desired,

Thus, the total for materials is less than in the case of the 
concrete cistern. The labor cost would be less, also, although 
the service of a skilled mason would be required. 
Cistern filters. If the cistern water is to be used for drinking 
purposes, a filter of some kind is very much to be desired. Even 
for laundry purposes the water is much cleaner if filtered. Of 
course if a house is provided with a good slate or sheet-iron roof 
and if care is taken always to prevent the first washings from the 
roof from entering the cistern, the use of a filter is not so essen- 
tial; but even then a filter will prove a great aid in keeping rain 
water clean. In Fig. 149 is shown a filter that is very commonly 
used — at least in a modified form. As shown in the figure, two 
single courses of bricks are laid across the middle of the cistern, 
leaving a four-inch space between the courses, This space may
-P-A-G-E-230
    
218 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
be filled with sand. If the water entering the cistern is very dirty, 
the pores of the filter, both bricks and sand, tend to become 
clogged ; so that the filter loses its effectiveness. The brick sur- 
face should be cleaned with 
a wire brush if the coating 
becomes too heavy, and the 
sand should in a few years 
be replaced with a fresh sup- 
ply. The two courses of 
bricks may be laid close to- 
gether and the sand omitted ; 
even a single course of bricks 
will prove very effective. 
A simple form of brick 
2 filter often used consists of 
a square crib, or box, of single-course bricks, with sides about 
two feet long, built up in the center of the cistern. The pump 
pipe is placed inside this crib. 
Another form of filter that is extremely effective is shown in 
Fig. 150. It is a little more complex and expensive than the 
brick filter described above, but it 
has great filtering power. The 
bottom of the filter bed may be 
made of a slab of concrete with 
numerous small holes made by 
inserting greased pins one-fourth 
inch in diameter into the slab 
while the concrete is green. A 
piece of perforated slate will serve 
the same purpose. The charcoal 
layer may be eliminated, but it 
adds greatly to the effectiveness Fic. 151. An inexpensive but fairly

barrel and then into the other is placed between the tops of the 
barrels as shown. The barrels may be placed on top of the ground 
if they are protected during freezing weather. 
If the water in a cistern has a disagreeable odor, the best 
thing to do is to pump it out and give the cistern a thorough 
cleaning. If the loss of the water would be serious, the water can 
be purified to some extent by aération; that is, by forcing air 
through it, as by forcing an upturned bucket deep down into the 
water and then releasing the air by turning the bucket. Vigorous 
agitation will help to aérate the contents. A teaspoonful of per- 
manganate of potash sprinkled on top of the water just before it 
is agitated will eliminate some of the impurities. 
Tue Evevatep Tank 
The elevated tank is perhaps most frequently used as storage 
for well water. It may be placed out of doors, as on the windmill 
tower (Fig. 152), on a tower built 
especially for the purpose, or on the 
silo. In any case it is subject to 
freezing in the winter, the water be- 
comes warm in the summer, and the 
tank is exposed to the weather. Any 
or all of these objections may be over- 
come to some extent. If a double- 
walled wooden tank is provided and 
the space between the walls is packed 
with sawdust or with specially pre- 
pared material, the danger from 
freezing is virtually eliminated. If 
a concrete tank is built, weathering 
has no effect on it. The concrete 
elevated tank is expensive because of 
the heavy supporting columns neces- 
sary; but it is nearly indestructible 
and may prove the less expensive in the long run. . Cement 
blocks are available for the construction of tanks aboveground — 
the same kind of blocks that. is .used in silo construction, The 
  Fic. 152. A substantial installa- 
tion of an elevated tank

220 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
use of the blocks eliminates expensive forms, and cisterns built 
from such blocks have proved very satisfactory. 
Table XXII gives the common sizes and the approximate prices 
of tanks of different materials used for storing water. The prices 
of course will vary in different places.

A tank built in the attic of the house is hardly to be recom- 
mended, though such tanks are common. Heavy construction is 
usually necessary to prevent sagging, for water in large quanti- 
ties is very heavy. For example, a tank holding five hundred 
gallons weighs over two tons when filled with water. The danger 
from leakage, too, is always a menace, though a sheet-iron tray 
provided with an outlet is usually placed beneath the tank 
for the purpose of catching the leakage. The tank in the attic 
possesses the one great advantage of being protected from the  
-P-A-G-E-233
WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 221 
weather ; and with a little additional protection it will not freeze. 
The tank is frequently placed on a level with or below the eaves, 
so that it may be filled directly from the eaves spout. 
Fig. 153 shows a scheme in which the force of gravity is uti- 
lized. There is no pumping —no effort except the turning of 
faucets. This system is especially adapted to locations where the 
house is on a lower level than the barn, although it has been 
installed in many places where both house and barn were on the 
same level. It is essential in such an installation to have the

the bottom so that it may be drained in freezing weather. 
There are many modifications of this idea. A cistern may be 
built in the approach to a bank barn or in a sidehill near the 
barn. Instead of taking the water to the tank beneath the 
ground, the tank may be located closer to the barn, and the water 
carried across to the top of the tank. 
A Simpcte KircHen INSTALLATION 
Fig. 154 shows an inexpensive and simple yet convenient instal- 
lation for a kitchen. Many kitchens are provided with a sink on 
which is mounted a cistern pump. With very little additional

the sink and filled with well water supplied from a pump outside, 
or from a flowing spring, or from a hydraulic ram. If the supply 
is furnished from a windmill or a flowing stream, all of the water 
for barn use may be passed through the tank and the overflow 
taken to the barn. This keeps a constant supply of fresh water

As was said in the discussion of elevated tanks, this system has 
some serious objections, but it will give fair satisfaction if the 
tank is properly supported and possible leakage provided for.

  WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 223 
Hot-water tank. The system shown in Fig. 155 includes a hot- 
water tank which is located by the side of the kitchen range. The 
water is heated by means of a water front placed in the fire-box 
of the range. This may consist of a simple rectangular metal 
box, or it may be 
composed of a series 
of coils made of a 
one-inch pipe. The 
latter offers more 
heating-surface, but 
the small pipes fre- 
quently become com- 
pletely filled with 
deposits from the 
water. This difficulty 
is worse with some 
waters than with 
others, those having 
a large amount of 
lime being the worst. 
The rectangular box, 
although it does not 
heat the water so 
quickly, does not, 
on the other hand, 
become clogged so 
readily. There seems 
to be no cheap and 
effective way of pre- 
venting this incrus- Fic. 155. A pressure system, using an attic tank

practical remedy is to 
supply a new water front when the old one gives out. If the 
water carries a high percentage of lime, this may be necessary 
every three or four months. 
The cold-water pipe, which is taken into the tank at the top, 
is extended nearly to the bottom. The hot-water pipe is taken 
directly from the top of the tank. The tank is usually 1 ft. in

Tue HypropNEuMATIC SYSTEM 
Fig. 156 shows a possible scheme for the installation of a so- 
called “‘ hydropneumatic”’ system of water supply. This system 
consists of an air-tight tank, 
usually located in the base- 
ment of the house, a pump 
to force the water into the 
tank, a hot-water boiler for 
heating a portion of the 
supply, and a piping system 
leading to various parts of 
the house.

the most expensive single 
item of the system. It must 
be made of good material

frequently made of getting a tank that is too small. It should be 
remembered that the tank is never completely filled with water. 
As the water is pumped in, the air is compressed more and more,

15 lb. pressure the tank is one-half full of water, at 45 Ib. pres- 
sure the tank is three-fourths full of water, and at 60 lb. pressure 
the tank is four-fifths full of water. 
Since the working pressure seldom exceeds 40 lb., the tank is 
never more than three-fourths full. Furthermore, a tank will not 
deliver all the water that it contains to a point above the level of 
the tank itself unless the air within the tank is first charged to a 
pressure determined by the height to which the water is to be raised. 
For example, the bathroom fixtures are usually about 20 ft. above 
the tank. It will require a pressure of 20 x .434, or 8.68 lb., to 
lift the water in these pipes. Hence, if all the water from the 
tank is to be delivered into the bathroom, there must be a pressure 
of 8.68 Ib. left in the tank. In other words, if the tank is charged 
to about 10 lb. by forcing in air before pumping begins, all of 
the water will be delivered to the second story. This is usually 
not done, so that when the water ceases to run on the second 
floor, the tank will still be about one-third full of water. One 
must not overlook this fact when purchasing a tank.

together with the total capacity, the working capacity, and the

It was said that the tank is usually located in the basement. It 
may, however, be buried in the ground just outside the basement,
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
with one end projecting through the basement wall. This keeps 
the water cool in summer and prevents freezing in winter. The 
fact that the end projects into the basement makes possible the 
convenient connection of pipes, gauges, etc. 
The pump. The pump used to fill the tank may be a hand 
pump placed in the basement, as shown in Fig. 156, provided the 
water is not more than twenty feet below the level of the pump. 
An ordinary force pump may be placed directly over the well or 
cistern and operated by hand, by windmill, or by a gasoline engine. 
Since the water absorbs a certain amount of air, it is necessary 
to supply air to the tank at more or less regular intervals. Pumps 
for this purpose are so designed that air may be forced in with 
the water. Sometimes a separate air pump is supplied, but this 
is not necessary, 
Cistern or well water. Unless two tanks are put in, only one 
kind of water can be furnished. This should be soft water, by 
all means, since the chief household needs call for soft water. 
If hard water is desired, another and smaller tank may be put 
in and both systems operated by the same pump provided the 
well is not too deep.

WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 227. 
THe Pneumatic SysTEM 
The objection has been raised to the hydropneumatic system 
just discussed that the water must be stored, This is true, and 
if it is used for drinking purposes, this may be a real objection. 
In order to overcome this possible objection the pneumatic system, 
or so-called ‘‘ fresh-water” system, has been devised. 
General installation. Fig. 157 shows the necessary features of 
such an installation, An air-tank is placed in the basement or 
other convenient place and charged with 
air by means of an air-compressor. This 
compressor must be operated by a gaso- 
line engine. An air-pipe conducts the 
air from the tank to a pump in the well. 
Leading from this pump is another pipe 
which carries the water to the various         
   
        
The two pumps shown may be operated from the same air-tank        
Fic. 157. An installation of a pneumatic system piped for hard and for soft water 
‘The tank is charged with air, and no water is stored 
faucets in the system. The tank is now charged with air, which 
is admitted to the pipes. As soon as a faucet anywhere in the 
system is turned, the pressure on the pump is released and the 
two plungers within the pump are automatically operated, forcing 
water out through the open faucet. As soon as the faucet is 
closed the action of the pump ceases. 
The tank. The tank is essentially of the same construction as 
that described under the hydropneumatic system, though it must 
be built to withstand a higher working pressure. The degree of 
pressure which it is necessary to maintain depends upon the 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
    228 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
depth of the well and upon the distance from the well to the 
point to which the water is to be carried. For example, if the 
well is 75 ft. deep, it will require a pressure of 75 x .434, or 
32.5 lb., to lift the water to the surface. If it is to be conducted 
through an additional length of, say, 200 ft., making a total of 
275 ft. of 1-inch pipe, at the rate of 5 gal. per minute, the fric- 
tion loss would be approximately 9 ft. of head, making the total 
lift 84 ft.; consequently there will be required a minimum pressure 
of 84 x .434, or 36.5 lb., to deliver the water to the,faucet at the 
above rate. In order to maintain this pressure the initial pressure 
must be considerably higher than this. The tank is usually 
charged to a pressure of 100 lb. 
The pump. The pump is the complex and expensive feature 
in this system. It is a long tubular device, made in different 
sizes, but small enough to fit into a four-inch well-casing. It is 
made up of two cylinders with plungers and a complex set of 
valves to admit of automatic operation by the air. The material 
is brass throughout, and excellent workmanship is required. The 
pump alone costs about eighty-five dollars. 
The air-compressor. An air-compressor is necessary to charge 
the tank. An engine is required to operate it, and though simple 
in its construction, it is rather expensive. 
Cost of the system. For an average installation the cost, not 
including house fixtures or plumbing for house fixtures, would be

The great advantage of this system lies in the fact that no 
water is stored. Yet, if the well is some distance from the
-P-A-G-E-241
  
WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEMS 229 
house, the pipes must be drained before cool, fresh water is to 
be had. By the use of one air-tank it is possible to operate two 
or more pumps in different wells or cisterns. The objectionable 
feature is the expensive and complex pump. If there happens 
to be sand in the water, the working of the valves is likely to be 
interfered with. Many installations are giving satisfaction, while 
others have given considerable trouble. The system is much 
more expensive than the hydropneumatic system and can scarcely 
be considered so reliable. 
THe Automatic SysTEM 
Where an electric current is available the hydropneumatic sys- 
tem may be equipped with an electrically operated pump. The 
motor is supplied with an automatic switch connected to the pres- 
sure tank in such a way that it is thrown out when the pressure 
reaches the desired maximum point, and thrown in (thus starting 
the pump) when the pressure drops to the lowest point permis- 
sible. But little current is required to operate the motor, and 
the system seems to be giving the best of satisfaction.

    CHAPTER XVII 
SEWAGE-DISPOSAL FOR FARM HOMES 
Since good health is regarded as a natural heritage of life in 
the country and since it is common to hear the country spoken 
of as the home of rosy-cheeked children and aged men and 
women, the question, Why is there need to discuss farm sanita- 
tion? might well be asked. As a matter of fact, such statistics 
as are available seem to show that there is very little difference 
between rural and urban districts in respect to the death rate, and 
that, so far as certain diseases are concerned, — for example, tuber- 
culosis, typhoid fever, and, in general, diseases traceable to poor 
water, —the country has distinct advantages. Influenza seems to 
be one disease which is more prevalent in the country than in the 
city, the country death rate from this disease being twice as high 
as the city. But the question of disease and death does not offer 
the only excuse for this chapter. Virile manhood possessed of an 
active brain is not assured even though sickness is not common. 
Healthy bodies are frequently found in houses that are slovenly 
kept ; but self-respect, dignity and poise, culture and refinement, 
are not found there. 
Farm sanitation in its broadest sense is concerned with all 
factors relating to the health of those who live on the farm. 
These factors include the proper location of the house in regard 
to drainage, the construction and ventilation of house and stable, 
and the nature of the water supply, as well as the general tidiness 
and care of the place. The subject is here taken as referring to 
the proper disposition of night soil, or sewage from the house. 
The common privy. Almost every farm has its outdoor privy, 
which represents the common method of disposing of night soil. 
It must be said, to our shame, that too often the privy is little 
short of loathsome, a place to which one goes with much reluc- 
tance even when he is forced to do so, It is often placed several 
230
-P-A-G-E-243
SEWAGE-DISPOSAL FOR FARM HOMES 231 
rods from the house, and at times it is necessary to travel through 
mud and storm to reach it. Rather than endure these discomforts 
those who are compelled to use it are likely to postpone their 
visits as long as possible, a circumstance which results in a 
deranged system. 
A better construction should be secured, not only for the com- 
fort and convenience of those who must use the privy but also 
to guard against the spread of disease. Too frequently the privy 
vault is entirely open, and flies find easy access. Flies revel in 
filth, and it may be quite possible that they fly from just such 
places as a privy vault direct to the dinner-table or to the baby’s 
rattle, depositing the germs of some deadly disease. Further, the 
seepage from a privy vault may find its way to the well, the 
spring, or other source of water supply, carrying the germs of 
typhoid fever or other diseases. 
A good privy must be fly-proof, so constructed that there is no 
possibility of its polluting the water supply, and reasonably com- 
fortable in cold weather. A common method of construction is to 
dig a vault, over which the house is built. Sometimes the sides 
of the vault are walled up with brick, plank, or concrete; in 
other cases there is simply a hole in the ground — usually with 
no bottom: provided, so that the liquid may better seep away. 
This is a dangerous mode of construction and should be avoided 
unless the privy is located from one hundred and fifty to three 
hundred feet from the well. 
If a vault is used, it should by all means have the walls and 
bottom made of concrete. If such a vault is protected from flies 
it is reasonably safe, but it is a most disagreeable task to clean 
it out. A large vault does not have to be cleaned often, of course, 
but the accumulation of many months renders the use of the 
privy disagreeable. 
The dry-earth closet. What is perhaps one of the best con- 
structions for the common privy is what is known as the dry-earth 
closet. It is a common observation that when dead organic 
matter comes in contact with the surface soil it is very soon de- 
composed and made a part of the soil. Rotting weeds, manure, 
fecal matter, dead bodies, etc., on top of or slightly covered by 
the soil, are readily and almost greedily attacked by the millions
-P-A-G-E-244
    232 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
of bacteria in the soil, which, acting as scavengers, soon render 
the decomposing mass unobjectionable. 
If, now, a convenient receptacle for receiving the night soil in 
the closet is provided and a liberal amount of dry earth sprinkled 
over the soil each time the closet is used, the result will be sur- 
prising. The fecal matter will be practically consumed if this 
method is followed; and if the dry earth is persistently used, 
the task of cleaning will not be objectionable provided it is fre- 
quently done. Lime, road 
dust, or screened cinders 
Oy may be used, but they do 
not possess the purifying    
       
        power that live earth does. 
   
       SS 5 There are several de- 
N N signs which may be used 
S N for the receptacle. In 
SN N some cases a concrete box 
s SN S is built and is cleaned 
SN N from the rear by means of 
SS N a shovel ; in other cases a 
concrete floor is put in and 
a long wooden box slipped 
under the seat. The size 
of the box is such that it 
may easily be removed at 
the rear and lifted into a 
wagon. Fig. 158 shows 
a plan that has proved very satisfactory. A concrete floor is laid, 
and a concrete seat-front, also, is advisable, for the front of the seat 
soon becomes foul and ill smelling if made of wood. Buckets are 
provided under the seats as containers ; galvanized garbage cans, 
which are easily handled and cleaned, serve the purpose very well. 
If this method is to prove satisfactory, constant care is neces- 
sary. Children, for example, may neglect to use the dry earth 
and thus foul the cans. Persistently and regularly used, however, 
the earth will virtually eliminate the solid matter. Slop jars should 
never be emptied into the can, because the earth will not absorb 
a large amount of water.

The cans should be emptied at least once a week, although 
twice a week would be better. The contents may be buried or 
may be hauled some distance from the house and scattered over 
the field. It must be remembered, however, that, since the dry- 
earth process does not kill any disease germs that may have been 
voided in the excrement, great care must be exercised in dis- 
posing of the waste. It should be seen to, also, that such waste 
is not scattered near the buildings, where flies are likely to find it. 
  Fic. 159. A pail closet in close connection with the house 
Such a closet is convenient and, if properly cared for, sanitary 
If this type of privy is carefully managed, it need not be far 
from the house and, if possible, should be connected with it by 
means of a covered walk. 
The pail closet. Fig. 159 shows what is designated as the pail 
closet, a simple application of the dry-earth-closet principle. It 
may be located in the woodshed or in any building adjoining the 
house. The receiving pail is placed in a tight box provided with 
a closely fitting hinged cover. A vent flue leads from this box 
directly to the outside or into a chimney flue and so conveys away 
objectionable odors. If the can is emptied every few days and 
dry earth liberally used, the scheme is very satisfactory and 
exceedingly desirable, especially for children and aged people.
-P-A-G-E-246
  234 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The chemical closet. The chemical closet is a patented device 
which has recently been placed upon the market and which is 
finding a wide use in homes not supplied with running water. 
The system is used to good advantage in extremely cold climates 
and is sometimes found even in small hotels where much trouble 
results from frozen water-pipes. 
Fig. 160 shows the usual installation. The closet is best located 
on the first floor of the house. Second-floor installations are 
possible, but not at all de- 
sirable. The closet may 
be placed in a bathroom or 
in a woodshed adjoining 
the kitchen. A vent re- 
moves disagreeable odors, 
Bisioyckennay ie so there is no objection to 
locating the closet in or 
adjacent to the house. 
The tank, which is usu- 
ally of heavy steel and 
holds from 100 to 150 gal., 
is buried in the ground 
beneath the closet. One 
end projects beyond the 
foundation of the house 
so that cleaning is readily 
accomplished. The inner 
end of the tank may pro- 
ject into the basement. 
Fic. 160. A common installation of a The closet seat is a white 
chemical closet 3 E porcelain bowl with a 
tightly fitting hinged lid. Leading from the bowl to the tank is 
a 12-inch galvanized-iron tube. A vent tube, frequently made of 
4-inch heavy sheet iron, white-enameled, leads from the bowl up 
through the roof ; or it may discharge into a chimney flue. In all 
cases it is necessary that a proper vent be provided. 
The caustic material is furnished in cans, each can being suf- 
ficient for one charge. A certain quantity of water is added and 
the tank is ready for use. While the solution is strong enough         
  Locatep tn House 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  SEWAGE-DISPOSAL FOR FARM HOMES 235 
to render practically harmless the solid matter with which it comes 
in contact, it will not completely sterilize the solid matter unless 
the latter is broken up in some way. Agitators are frequently 
provided for this purpose, and if they are not provided, the 
material should at frequent intervals be stirred in some other way. 
To clean the tank it is only necessary to place a small pitcher 
pump over the outside opening in the tank, pump out the liquid, 
and remove any sludge that may collect in the bottom. This is 
not a disagreeable task. Some companies claim that the tank 
will not need cleaning oftener than twice a year. This may be 
true under certain conditions, but the chances are that, if satis- 
factory results are secured, a cleaning every month or so will be 
found necessary where the family is large. 
It will readily be seen that this system has its drawbacks. 
There is some expense connected with each charging. It takes 
considerable time to clean the tank, and the total first cost of the 
installation would amount to from twenty-five to fifty dollars. 
Moreover. the tube leading to the tank frequently becomes soiled 
and so requires attention. On the other hand, this system affords 
a comfortable closet where water is not piped into the house, and 
with reasonable care it will prove less objectionable than the 
common privy. 
The cesspool. None of the methods for the disposal of sewage 
thus far discussed involve the use of running water. As soon as 
a home is supplied with a complete water-supply system, other 
and better methods for disposing of sewage are available. 
The cesspool is not to be classed as one of the better methods, 
but questions concerning it are so frequently asked that some 
discussion is here necessary. As ordinarily constructed, the cess- 
pool is nothing more than a hole in the ground some 12 ft. deep 
and 6 or 8 ft. in diameter, loosely walled up with stones. The 
bottom is not covered. The sewage from the house is drained 
into the hole, and the liquid gradually seeps into the surrounding 
soil. The solid matter sinks to the bottom, and although much 
of it is decomposed by bacterial action, a considerable amount of 
sludge collects. 
The liquid contents of the cesspool must all be absorbed by 
the soil immediately surrounding the pool itself. This means 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
that the soil soon becomes clogged by the material from the tank 
and loses its purifying power. If the cesspool is located near a 
well, the water vein is likely to become polluted through the 
seeping of sewage into it. If once the contents of the pool find 
their way into a water vein, they may travel long distances. 
Should a person carrying typhoid germs use a closet emptying 
into the cesspool, the entire family, and possibly other families, 
may become infected through the water supply. It is no argument 
for this method to say that certain cesspools have been in opera- 
tion for years without serious results, One death from such a 
source is all too much to pay for the needless risk, and on the 
whole the use of the cesspool must be severely condemned. 
The septic tank. Without any question the septic tank is the 
best means yet devised for disposing of the sewage from the 
farmhouse. It is not expensive, it is easily installed, and, above 
all, it is safe. The form of tank most generally adopted is 
composed of two chambers. The chamber receiving the sewage 
from the house is known as the se¢tling-chamber, and the second 
compartment is known as the dosing-chamber. 
Operation of the septic tank. Two distinct steps are recognized 
in the disposal and purification of sewage by means of the septic 
tank. The material from the bathroom, the kitchen sink, etc., 
is conducted into the first chamber of a water-tight tank, where 
it is allowed to settle and where it remains without undue agi- 
tation or disturbance until a certain kind of bacteria, called 
anaérobic, or rotting, bacteria, has transformed a large portion 
of the solid matter into a liquid or gaseous state. The bacteria 
which bring about this stage in the process of purification do 
their work only in the absence of lightand air. Fortunately they 
possess in large measure the power of creating their own favor- 
able conditions. They will bring about the formation of a scum 
over the surface of the liquid in which they work, thus effectually 
excluding both light and air. 
From the settling-chamber the liquid content seeps into the 
second chamber of the tank; a small amount of solid matter is 
carried over with the liquid, and the action which took place in 
the first chamber is here continued until nearly all the solid 
matter is consumed.
-P-A-G-E-249
  SEWAGE-DISPOSAL FOR FARM HOMES 237. 
From the second chamber the liquid is discharged into a dis- 
posal system, where it is exposed to conditions favorable to the 
action of another kind of bacteria known as aérobic bacteria, which 
work only in the presence of air. It must never be forgotten 
that the liquid coming from the tank is foul and likely to be laden 
with disease germs. A tile drainage system is perhaps the best 
means by which to provide the necessary conditions for the fur- 
ther purification of the sewage. This takes advantage, as does 
the dry-earth closet, of the purifying action of the upper layer 
of soil, which soon renders the sewage virtually harmless if it is 
properly distributed. 
The discharge from the tank into the disposal system may be 
by gradual seepage, as through the upper outlet shown in Fig. 161, 
or it may be by intermittent discharge. In the latter method the 
second chamber is allowed to fill to a certain height, and then 
the contents are flushed into the disposal system either by the 
removal of a plug such as that shown in Fig. 161 or by the action 
of an automatic siphon, as shown in Fig. 162. While discharge 
by gradual seepage seems to be giving satisfaction, intermittent 
discharge serves to flush the entire disposal system and tends 
to secure better distribution of the liquid over the disposal area. 
Location of the septic tank. Since there is almost no odor 
coming from the tank, it may be located by the side of the 
house. It is perhaps best placed from twenty to fifty feet from 
the house. It should not be much further away, as in that case 
the pipe leading to the tank would be more likely to become 
clogged. The tank may be covered completely, so that there 
need be no objection to having it in the yard. 
Construction of the septic tank. Fig. 161 shows the simplest 
possible construction for a septic tank. This is a double-chamber 
tank built of concrete. It may be built of bricks thoroughly 
plastered with good cement plaster as in cistern construction. 
The hole is excavated to the desired size and the inner form 
lowered into place and supported from the top. The concrete 
is then mixed in the proportion of 1-2-4 and the boitom first 
placed. The bottom may be laid before the inner form is put in. 
Care should be taken not to have the mixture too wet, as it tends 
to flow out from the bottom of the inner form when the sides 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
are being placed. After the sides are completed the bottom 
should be smoothed over with the trowel and given the desired 
slope. The forms should be left in for at least three or four 
days. As a matter of precaution it is advisable to reénforce the 
walls (especially, near the top) with No. 9 fencing-wire placed at 
intervals of eight or ten inches. 
The cover is made up of concrete slabs, which may be molded 
in separate forms and then laid over the tank. A wood cover 
would answer for a time, but the concrete is much more satis- 
. factory. A manhole is sometimes built into the cover as a con- 
venience in cleaning, but it is not difficult to remove one or 
two slabs for this purpose, even if the tank is completely buried.

For the average farm family it should be 23 ft. wide (inside measurement) 
The inlet pipe leading from the house to the tank is a 4-inch 
vitrified sewer pipe laid to a fall of from }in. to fin. per foot. 
The pipes are laid with the bell end toward the house, and the 
joints are thoroughly cemented in order to prevent the seeping 
of sewage into the soil near the house. Cementing also holds 
the joints in line. Care should be taken to have the inside per- 
fectly smooth. A swab should be made of old rags on a stick, 
and each time a joint is laid and cemented it should be wiped 
out so that there will be no projections to clog the pipe. The 
depth should be at least 2 ft. and if the slope will permit, a 
greater depth is desirable. The warm water from the kitchen 
will prevent freezing under ordinary conditions, however, and it  
-P-A-G-E-251
SEWAGE-DISPOSAL FOR FARM HOMES 239 
is not advisable to place the tank too far beneath the surface. 
It is a good idea to lay a Y-joint, with the Y turned up, in the 
inlet pipe, about midway, between the house and the tank. The 
hole in the Y is then plugged, and in case the inlet ever clogs 
it will be convenient in cleaning the pipe. It is necessary that 
the inlet pipe should have a branch inside the tank, extending 
down into the liquid, to prevent unnecessary agitation of the 
contents of the tank and avoid breaking the surface scum. 
Fig. 162 shows a double-chamber tank equipped with an

tents of the dosing-chamber enter the disposal system. A siphon 
of this sort costs about fifteen dollars. It seems to work with 
fair satisfaction. The only difficulty encountered comes from the 
collection of foreign matter on the parts of the siphon, which 
at times interferes with its action. However, should it become 
clogged it is not difficult to clean. 
The regulations of the Ohio State Board of Health require 
that the joint extending into the tank be a T-joint, with one end 
extending down into the liquid and the other end reaching well 
above the liquid, thus allowing a free movement of air from the 
upper part of the tank back into the plumbing system of the 
house. They also require that :there be a vent of some kind in

in the tank. A great deal of gas collects above the liquid in the 
tank, and this must have a means of escape. The tank shown 
provides escape into the outlet pipe, a method which has given 
satisfaction in many installations, though the requirement referred

purified but little during the action which has taken place within 
the tank. It is important, therefore, that the effluent be properly 
disposed of. 
A tile drainage system, such as that shown in Fig. 163, rep- 
resents one of the best methods available for disposing of the 
effluent from a septic tank. The drain leading from the tank 
to such a system should be laid with sewer tile, with the joints 
cemented, in order that none of the sewage may seep out near 
the well or cistern, and that it may be carried to the several 
drains, where it will be distributed over a large area of soil. The 
grade should be at least from 4 to 6 in. per 100 ft. Its length 
should not be greater than is absolutely necessary — from 50 to 
100 ft. usually being sufficient. 
The tile drains should not be over eighteen inches deep, as this 
depth allows a more or less free circulation of air over the liquid 
and into the soil. Furthermore the sewage is thus permitted to
-P-A-G-E-253
SEWAGE-DISPOSAL FOR FARM HOMES 241 
seep out into the upper layer of soil, where the bacteria which are 
relied upon to purify it further are most abundant. A consider- 
able space is left between the joints of the tile, especially in stiff 
clay soils where seepage is likely to be slow. In unusually reten- 
tive soils it is wise to cover the drains with a few inches of 
cinders or gravel. 
The disposal system may be located anywhere conveniently 
near the tank, a pasture or a meadow being perhaps the best 
place. There is no objection, indeed, to locating it in the garden. 
There should be from 20 to 50 ft. of tile for each occupant 
of the house. An average of, say, 40 ft. would probably suffice 
for the ordinary soil, but 
the length required in- 
creases with the stiffness 
of the soil. 
The effluent from the 
tank is frequently taken 
into a tile drain laid for 
ordinary drainage  pur- 
poses. This is permissible 
and safe if the tile drain 
does not empty into a 
stream the water of which Fic. 164. A single-chamber septic tank 
is used for human con- 
sumption. Owing to the absence of adequate light and air little 
purification will take place, however, if the tile are laid to a 
depth of three feet, as tile drains should ordinarily be laid. 
The effluent may also be taken directly into an open stream 
if the water is flowing the year round and if it is not used for 
house purposes. In such a case, however, there is always danger 
that someone may use the water and that the method may thus 
lead to the spread of disease. 
The single-chamber tank. Fig. 164 shows the construction of 
a single-chamber tank. This kind of tank is essentially the same 
as the double-chamber tank except that the second chamber is 
omitted. Such a tank does not provide for the intermittent dis- 
charge of the contents into the disposal system, which in the 
opinion of many is not necessary, General practice, however, ries o

fall of incoming sewage, to prevent undue agitation, and to prevent 
so far as possible the escape of solid matter into the outlet tile. 
Size of tank. The size of the tank depends upon the number 
of persons served. The tank shown in Fig. 161 is, when made 
two and one-half feet wide (inside measurement), designed to meet 
the needs of a family of six persons. Table XXIV! specifies the 
proper dimensions for single-chamber tanks the designs for which 
are taken from the bulletin mentioned in the footnote. The size 
of the first chamber of double-chamber tanks is essentially the 
same as for single-chamber tanks. The dosing-chamber should 
be of such a size as to hold approximately one third as much 
as the settling-chamber. If an automatic siphon is used, a mini- 
mum depth must be secured and the specifications for the size of 
siphon used must be carefully followed.

Care of tank. The tank, properly installed, needs but little 
attention. Under ordinary conditions it will need cleaning but 
once in from three to five years, so completely is the solid matter 
in the tank consumed by the bacterial action. What solid matter 
there is collects in the bottom of the tank as sludge, a fine 
loamy material which is not very disagreeable to handle. To clean 
the tank it is necessary to pump the water out and remove the 
sludge with a shovel if a sludge-drain is not provided. 
Grease interferes with bacterial action, and consequently a little 
care should be exercised in this regard. However, the small 
amount of grease which ordinarily finds its way to the tank from 
the kitchen sink and the laundry will not be harmful.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE PLOW 
The plow is the basic tillage tool, the fundamental farm 
implement. It is not merely a tool for inverting the furrow 
slice, but it is the most efficient pulverizer of the soil in use. 
As the moldboard turns the furrow, each particle of soil is forced 
to slip against the particle adjoining, a process which results in 
a tilth that no other single operation approaches. The general 
impression prevails that the plow is a simple tool, requiring 
but little adjustment and less care. This is far from the truth, 
however. Without question it is the most complex tool on the 
farm, in that it requires the greatest skill for adjustments, the 
grain-binder and the gasoline engine not excepted. More effort 
has been expended in the slow process of development of this 
seemingly simple tool than in that of any other implement on 
the farm, Careful study of its construction, adjustment, and 
use will be amply rewarded. 
THE WALKING PLow 
Mechanics of the plow. The mechanical principle underlying 
the construction of the plow embraces the application of three 
simple machines : the wedge, the inclined plane, and the screw. 
The wedge is formed by the ground line and the slope of the 
share face; while in the slope and twist of the moldboard are 
found the inclined plane and the screw. 
Materials used. The moldboard, the share, and the landside 
may be made from either chilled iron or soft-center steel. 
Chillediron parts are manufactured by pouring the molten 
metal into a mold having its face lined with metal. At times 
this metal lining is hollow and water is made to circulate through 
it. This hastens the cooling of the molten mass and changes 
245  
-P-A-G-E-258
  246 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
the minute construction of the resulting piece, rendering it ex- 
tremely hard and brittle. A section of a chilled-iron moldboard 
  Fic. 169. Section of a chilled-iron moldboard 
Note the uniform texture of the metal is shown in Fig. 169. 
A chilled plow bottom, 
then, possesses the follow- 
ing characteristics : (1) it is 
extremely hard ; (2) it takes 
a good polish; (3) it has 
a long life, wearing espe- 
cially well in gravelly soil ; 
(4) it does not rust deeply 
and it repolishes easily ; 
(5) it is heavy and somewhat 
cumbersome ; (6) it breaks 
easily if struck a sharp blow. 
Soft-center steel is manufactured by taking two layers of very 
hard steel, placing between them a layer of softer steel, and then 
rolling the three together 
at welding heat. The ef- 
fect is to produce a sheet 
of steel, thin and light 
in weight, yet extremely 
tough. The soft center 
serves as a cushion to all 
blows and sudden strains. 
In Fig. 170 is shown a 
diagrammatic section of a 
soft-center steel share. 
A steel bottom has the 
following characteristics : 
(1) it is tough and not 
easily broken ; (2) it takes 
a good polish and scours 
well in sticky soil; (3) it 
does not wear so well as 
a chilled plow in gravelly

A patch of extra-hard steel is welded on top of the

often rusts and pits badly if left exposed to the weather.
-P-A-G-E-259
  
THE PLOW 247 
The modern tendency seems to be toward the exclusive use of 
the steel plow. In sections where the soil is largely gravelly 
loam or of a coarse, sandy nature, however, the chilled plow will 
outwear one made of steel. The pitting of the steel plow when 
it rusts is due primarily to the process by which the steel is 
manufactured. The phenomenon, which is not dissimilar to the 
rusting of modern fencing-wire, constitutes a defect which seems 
difficult to overcome. 
The frog. The frog is the heart of the plow, around which all 
other parts are built. It is that part of the plow bottom to which 
are attached the moldboard, the share, and the landside. The 
beam may also be attached to it. There are three materials out 
of which frogs may be made: cast iron, malleable iron, and steel. 
The cast-zron frog is confined almost entirely to wooden-beam 
plows. The reason for this is that the wood beam requires a 
standard of considerable size because the entire force required to 
draw the plow is applied at this point; and since the standard 
and the frog are of one piece, both must be large. Cast iron is 
sufficiently strong, and at the same time is less expensive than 
either steel or malleable iron. A cast-iron frog is absolutely rigid 
and forms a satisfactory base to which to attach the moldboard, 
share, and landside. 
The malleable-iron frog is frequently used in plows where 
the frog is of medium size. If cast iron were used, the thinner 
parts would break, and yet the frog is too large to permit of the 
economical use of steel. 
The steel frog is now almost universally used on steel-beam 
plows. It has the advantage over other materials in being strong, 
light in weight, and easily shaped. With all its lightness in 
weight, however, it seems to provide a sufficiently substantial base 
for other parts. There are two kinds of steel frogs, the cast-steel 
frog and the forged-steel frog. The cast-steel frog is made by 
pouring the molten steel into a mold which is the exact shape of 
the frog. The forged-steel frog is made by placing a red-hot sheet 
of steel over a form of the desired shape and size and striking 
it a heavy blow with a drop hammer. A forged-steel frog is 
smaller than a cast-steel frog, and a plow equipped with the 
former must be rigidly braced if good construction is to be secured.  
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
A convenient method of determining whether a certain piece is 
made of cast iron or of malleable iron is by the use of a hammer 
  Fig. 171. A sod moldboard 
This type of moldboard is long, gently sloping, 
and has considerable twist and chisel. If made of cast 
iron, the piece subjected to 
this test will chip; if of 
malleable iron, it will dent. 
Of course, soft steel also, 
will dent, but it is easy to 
tell whether or not a frog is 
made of steel. If the num- 
ber of the part is stamped 
into the metal by a die, we 
may usually conclude that 
the part is steel; if the number is raised, the part is cast or malleable. 
The moldboard. The moldboard has three distinct functions ; 
namely, to lift, to turn, and 
to pulverize the furrow slice, 
To perform these functions 
in different types of soil and 
under different conditions of 
moisture, tilth, etc., mold- 
boards of different shapes 
are required. The sod mold- 
board must raise the furrow

stubble moldboards bend the furrow slice so 
much as to cause buckling. 
This type of moldboard, 
therefore, is long, gently 
sloping, and characterized 
by considerable twist. The 
stubble moldboard is used 
in stubble ground or ground 
free from a stiff sod. Here 
it is not so necessary to 
turn the furrow slice completely over, and since there is no ten- 
dency to buckle, more thorough pulverization will be secured if

THE PLOW 249 
the moldboard is steep and short, with much bend. The general- 
purpose moldboard stands halfway between the sod and stubble 
types. It is the one most generally used in the older sections of 
the country, where all farms have some sod to break, but where 
there is little virgin soil. 
The breaker is a type of 
moldboard used in stiff prairie 
soil. It has an extremely 
long and gently sloping form. 
In extreme types it has a

plow used in very sticky soil, 
where it is impossible to get a moldboard plow to scour. The 
moldboard of this plow is made up of rods or of flat pieces of steel. 
Figs. 171 to 175 illustrate different types of moldboards. 
The landside. The landside is necessary in the walking plow 
to take the pressure exerted by the furrow slice on the moldboard 
and to aid in giving the plow a steady motion. There is a wide 
variation in the height, length, and shape of landsides. They are 
classified as high, medium, or low, according as they measure 
about 8in., 6in., and 4 in. respectively. The height should 
approach very closely to the depth of the furrow, else there is 
likely to be undue fric- 
tion between the furrow 
bank and the unprotected 
part of the plow. The 
friction between the land- 
side and the furrow slice 
is independent of the area Fic. 175. A rod moldboard 
of contact. A long land- This type is used in extremely sticky soils 
side aids in the proper 
handling of the plow, rendering it less susceptible to variation 
in the line of draft because of an unsteady land horse. 
Fig. 176 shows several types of landsides as regards the shape 
and angle of the face. The frequent tendency of a plow to rear 
up behind is overcome by the projecting sole on the landside, 
and thus more even running is secured. It is claimed for the 
       
-P-A-G-E-262
  250 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
sloping face that the furrows, when turned, fit more closely the 
one on the other, leaving less space between and thus interfering 
less with the rise of capillary moisture. It is doubtful, however, 
whether such a result is secured. On the contrary the slanting 
landside rather increases the tendency of the plow to rear up 
behind; moreover the slanting landside does not cut so clean a 
furrow slice, leave so smooth a furrow bank, nor afford so much 
room for the furrow horse as does the straight landside. In fact its 
effect is just opposite to that of the landside with a projecting sole. 
  Fic. 176. Types of landsides 
A, rectangular plain-faced type; B, slanting type; C, projecting-sole type ; 
D, widened-sole type 
The greatest wear comes upon the sole of the landside, and 
the heel takes the most of this. Several methods are in use for 
reénforcing the sole. In Fig. 180 is shown a detachable heel 
which is easily replaced when worn. A detachable sole is fre- 
quently provided, and it is easily replaced when it becomes worn. 
The practice of widening the sole (Fig. 176, D) is frequently 
resorted to in order to prolong the life of the landside. In many 
steel plows the landside proper is not reénforced in any way, but 
the landside back, to which it is attached, takes all the wear. 
It is doubtful whether this is the best construction, as a worn 
landside is more easily replaced than a landside back,
-P-A-G-E-263
    
THE PLOW 251 
The share. The share may be made of chilled iron or of steel. 
The steel share has several decided advantages. It may be sharp- 
ened at the forge and thus made to last several years. It should 
be said, however, that this is a difficult task, requiring much 
skill and practice for its successful operation. Both the bear- 
ing at the wing and the suction must be altered during the 
process, and the smith should have the plow at hand for a trial 
fit before he can be assured that the share is properly set. The 
steel share, although it costs two or three times as much as 
the chilled share, is probably more economical in the end. It 
can be made to carry a sharper edge than the cast share, and 
it is to be preferred in land where there are tough roots, as in 
alfalfa, shrubbery, bushes, etc. A poorly sharpened steel share, 
however, is worse than a 
dull chilled-iron share. 
The chilled-iron share, S 
commonly called a cast 
share, is recommended by 2

sible to grind this share 
on an emery wheel, but the suction, which is decreased with 
wear, cannot be increased, so that the share seldom works well 
after being sharpened. A sharp edge must not be provided, since 
it will be easily nicked and broken. It is possible to improve a 
dull cast share slightly by turning the plow upside down and 
chipping the point by sharp blows with a hammer, at the same 
time supporting it from beneath, as with an iron wedge. 
Fig. 177 shows a detachable point for the cast share. This 
usually costs about 10 cents, and although it is easily put on and 
is reversible (a feature which gives it the name of self-sharpening 
point), it has never been popular. 
The beam. The beam may be made of either wood or steel. 
Since good material is becoming rather scarce, the number of 
wooden beams in use is rapidly decreasing. The wooden beam 
(Fig. 178), however, has some advantages over the steel beam.

  THE PLOW 253 
It is lighter in weight, and the adjustment for width of futrow 
and for two or three horses is made at the rear end of the beam 
instead of at the clevis. Thus, the set of the plow is interfered 
with less than when the adjustment is made at the end of the 
beam. On the other hand, the wooden beam is frequently broken, 
and has less clearance, which is a disadvantage when one is 
plowing under trash or 
coarse manure. 
The steel beam, shown 
in Fig. 179, is now quite 
generally used. Being 
made of high-carbon steel, 
it is not easily bent and 
has plenty of clearance. 
Moreover in a few makes 
there is a special device 
for landing the beam at 
the rear, so that it pos- 
sesses the one great advan- 
tage of the wood beam, 
This device, shown in 
Fig. 180, consists of two 
wedges which, after the 
bolts at the base of the

of the steel beam are that it is rather heavy and that it can hardly 
be brought back to its original position if it is once bent out of 
shape. In fact it is quite impossible to do this unless it be 
returned to the factory and reshaped in the original mold. 
The set of the plow. When the walking plow rests on a level 
surface (Fig. 181) but three points of the bottom touch this sur-

plow into the ground, is secured by 
dipping the point of the share down-

Fig. 182. It should be from ¢ in. to 
2 in. for 12-inch to 14-inch plows, and 
about 4’; in. for 16-inch plows. As a 
share dulls, suction is destroyed, as 
shown in Fig. 183, and all penetrat- 
ing power is lost. If the share is of

ward, thus increasing the suction. This 
cannot be done with a cast share, but 
it is possible, by loosening the bolts in the share, to insert shims 
of tin or leather be-

side of the share in such a way that by moving it outward or in- 
ward the bearing is increased or decreased. Frequently a plow 
which will run properly in a dry soil will wing over from the 
land if used in wet soil, and vice versa, so that some adjustment 
is desirable. Fig. 180 shows such an adjusting-device. 
The winging over of a plow is often due to an improper hitch 
or to poor adjustment of the beam. This is not the only cause, 
however. If the land horse is considerably larger than the furrow 
horse and a rigid clevis is used in the bridle, the slant of the 
doubletree may cause 
the plow to wing over 
from the land. 
By the “landing of 
the beam” is meant 
the adjustment of the Fic. 185. Adjustment of beam

tal plane. The purpose of this is to cut varying widths of furrow 
and to change the hitch from 2 to 3 horses, or vice versa. Tia 
narrower furrow is desired, the beam or the hitch should be 
moved toward the land; for a wider furrow it should be moved 
in the opposite direction, If it is desired to change the hitch

from 2 to 3 horses, the beam or hitch should be moved toward 
the land. This is due to the fact that when the third horse is 
added the line of load is moved toward the line of draft so that 
the two may fall as nearly as possible in the same straight line. 
Fig. 185 shows the proper landing of the beam for 2, for 3, and 
for 4 horses. For 3 horses the beam is virtually on a straight line 
with the landside, while for 2 horses the landside of the beam is 
almost directly above the middle of the point of the share. This 
is not an absolute setting and will need to be varied to suit the 
size of the team, the length of the doubletree, etc. ; but the set- 
ting shown is standard, and steel beams that are rigidly set con- 
form closely to it. It should be noted that many steel-beam plows 
are now provided with an adjusting-device for landing the beam 
at its rear end. Such an adjusting-device is shown in Fig. 180. 
Line of draft. Fig. 186 shows the correct line of draft for a 
walking plow. This line starts from a theoretical point about 
two inches toward 
the moldboard side 
of the shin and just 
above the junction 
of the share and 
the moldboard. The 
hitch at the beam is supposed to occupy a position which will 
direct this line to the horses’ hames in such a way that the plow. 
may be drawn with the least friction on the furrow bottom. 
Any variation from this straight line will influence the operation 
of the plow. Raising the hip straps, for example, will break this 
line vertically, and poor adjustment at the clevis may destroy 
the line horizontally. Every effort should be made to keep 
this line perfectly straight. 
Plow attachments. Since a bare plow will seldom do satisfac- 
tory work, all plow-users should give careful study to the specific 
purpose of each attachment. The most important attachments 
are the jointer, the various forms of coulters, or cutters, and the 
beam wheel. 
The jointer is the most important single attachment found on 
plows, whether walking plows, sulky plows, or gang plows. Its 
form is shown in Figs. 179 and 187. It finds its most effective 
  Fic. 186. The line of draft in a walking plow

THE PLOW 287 
use in the plowing of sod. The jointer turns the edge of the 
furrow over in such a way that grass cannot grow up between 
the edge of the furrow slices if the plowed field stands for 
several weeks before being worked. Moreover it aids in covering 
manure and trash of any sort. It is impossible to do first-class 
plowing in sod without this attachment. The use of the jointer 
also reduces the work of preparing the seed-bed. In many cases 
it saves one harrowing, because of the way in which the furrow 
slice is turned. A mistaken impression is held by some that 
  
      
Fic. 187. A wooden-beam plow with jointer and beam wheel 
The jointer is set above the point of the share. It should run at a depth of 1} in. and should 
be set about 3 in. to the land side of the shin 
the rolling coulter takes the place of the jointer. The functions 
of the two are quite different. The jointer should be so set 
that (1) its point is above or just back of the point of the share, 
(2) it runs 1} in, to 2 in. deep, (3) it runs } in. to } in. to the 
land side of the shin of the plow. 
The coulter, or cutter, takes many forms, of which Figs. 188 
and 189 show several. The purpose of the coulter is to cut the 
furrow slice from the land, thus leaving a clean-cut furrow bank. 
If no coulter is provided, the shin of the moldboard must do 
the work of a coulter; but since in the absence of a coulter 
the face of the share begins to lift the furrow slice before the 
shin has had an opportunity to cut it off, a ragged job is sure 
to result.
-P-A-G-E-270
  
258 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The volling coulter is not well adapted to the walking plow, 
though it is sometimes used. The fin or the hanging coulter when 
used on walking plows improve the quality of the work and 
B Cc    Fic. 188. Various types of coulters

F, G, fin coulters 
materially decrease the draft. The rolling coulter should be set 
back of the point of the share, at a depth equal to about one half 
the depth of the furrow, and from 
one fourth to one half an inch 
outside the line of the shin. All 
other forms of coulters should, 
when it is possible, be set in this 
same relative position. 
The effect of a beam wheel is 
to cause the plow to run more 
steadily and thus to make the 
work easier for both man and 
team. The hitch should be so 
adjusted as to cause the wheel to 
press firmly but not too heavily 
on the ground. It should be set 
near the end of the beam and 
on a line with the landside. The 
use a agbeam oe elway seater type of coulter is in no sense a sub- sults in a more uniform furrow stitute for the jointer

and, in most cases, in a material reduction in draft. Two- 
wheeled trucks are used to a limited extent, with favorable 
results, but their weight is against their common use. 
Tue SuLtky Plow 
The sulky plow is the result of an effort to reduce friction 
as well as to provide a means for the operator to ride. The size 
of the plow is usually either 14 or 16 in., and it is essentially 
a 3-horse plow. The plow bottom, together with the frame, is 
mounted on 3 wheels, a 
feature which changes 
into rolling friction the 
sliding friction of the 
walking plow. Hence 
it is possible to add the 
weight of the frame 
and the driver and still 
not materially change 
the draft. 
The high-lift sulky 
plow. The _ high-lift

the framework is supported by and carried upon the three wheels, 
two running in the furrow and known respectively as the front 
and rear furrow wheels, and the other running upon the land. 
The frame may be raised or lowered upon the wheel-supports 
by means of two levers, one controlling the land side of the 
frame through the land wheel, the other controlling the furrow 
side by raising or lowering the frame upon the shank of the 
furrow wheel. 
The plow bottom is attached to the frame by bails, the plow 
being designated as a single-bailed or a double-bailed plow, accord- 
ing to the number of bails. A foot lever is provided which, 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
  260 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
by means of the bails, lifts the bottom sufficiently high for turning 
purposes, so that it is not necessary to use the hand levers after 
the plow is properly leveled. 
The furrow wheels are on casters and inclined to the vertical, 
so that they may run in the furrow without undue friction and

The front furrow 
wheel, which is

by a flexible rod,

tongue, which is 
connected directly 
to the front wheel. 
The frameless 
sulky plow. The 
frameless sulky 
plow, shown in 
Fig. 192, consists 
of little more than 
a walking plow 
minus the han- 
dles, with a truck 
under the end of 
the beam, a seat 
attached, and a 
wheel substituted 
for the landside. 
There are two levers to control the bottom — one to raise the 
end of the beam on the front furrow wheel, the other to level 
the plow by controlling the land wheel. By means of these levers 
the point of the share may be lifted free from the ground, but 
there is no way to lift the rear end. The front and rear furrow 
wheels are inclined from‘the land in order the better to take the

pressure of the furrow slice on the moldboard. The front furrow 
wheel is always castered; the rear one is usually castered, but 
in some types is rigidly fastened, and so becomes in reality a 
rolling landside. 
This plow is usually operated without a tongue, although in 
some plows the tongue may or may not be used. In case a tongue 
is not used, the front wheel may be controlled by a hand lever for

  convenience in turning, or by a connection from the hitch at the 
end of the beam. If the rear wheel is castered it is connected 
to the front wheel, so that both are controlled by the same lever 
or by the same hitch connection. Because this plow is short- 
coupled —the rear wheel, especially in the rigid form, running 
close to the bottom —and because of the short and rigid con- 
nection between the bottom and the wheels, it is possible to turn 
either a right-hand or a left-hand corner with equal ease. More- 
over it is not necessary to lift the plow from the ground in turning

262 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
in either direction. This type usually sells for about fifteen dollars 
less than the high-lift type. For this reason, and because of its 
general desirability, it is likely to grow rapidly in favor. 
The set of the sulky plow. The set of the sulky plow differs 
in many ways from that of the walking plow. The point of the 
share is the only part of 
the bottom that touches 
the floor when the plow 
is properly leveled. The 
wing of the share just 
swings free of the floor, 
while the heel of what 
little landside there is does 
not touch at all. The sac- 
tion, then, is not measured 
by the amount the point 
dips, but rather by the 
amount the heel of the 
landside is raised from 
the floor. Since the length 
of the landsides differs 
greatly, the suction can- 
not be stated in terms of 
distance of the heel from 
the floor unless the dis-

means provided for regulating the suction, by which it can be 
varied from zero to about 1 in. This device, which is usually 
found in connection with the shank of the rear furrow wheel, 
provides a means for raising or lowering the rear end of the 
frame. In some frameless sulkies with a rigid rear wheel it is 
impossible to alter the suction in this way.
-P-A-G-E-275
  
THE PLOW 263 
The furrow wheels are given /ead either toward or away from 
the land, as illustrated in Fig. 193. The front wheel is fre- 
quently given lead toward the land in an effort to throw the line 
of load as far to the land as possible. This is particularly true of 
gang plows. The rear furrow wheel is given lead from the land. 
There is considerable pressure on this wheel, a pressure which 
tends to crowd it into the furrow bank, and it leads away in order 
that it may have no tendency to climb over the bank. Different 
devices are provided for giving these wheels lead. 
The rear furrow wheel is also set outside the line of the land- 
side, as shown in Fig. 193, A. This is for the purpose of taking 
all friction off the landside. The amount the rear furrow wheel 
is set over varies from # in. to 2 in., but is usually about 1 in. 
The front furrow wheel must be properly adjusted to the width 
of the furrow; that is, this wheel should always be kept running 
in the bottom of the furrow and against the furrow bank. If the 
hitch is changed to cut a wider or a narrower furrow, a corre- 
sponding change must be made in the wheel. 
It is possible, too, to set the high-lift plow to float. Ordinarily 
when the bottom is lowered by the foot lever, it is locked in posi- 
tion and cannot be raised unless the frame is lifted with it. In 
nearly all cases a set-screw (Fig. 190, £) is found in connection 
with this foot lever, which may be so adjusted as to prevent its 
locking, so that if the bottom strikes a stone or root, it alone 
will be thrown out of the ground, swinging upward on its bails. 
This device is useful in the plowing of stony or stumpy ground. 
Attachments. Almost any of the various types of coulters may 
be used on sulky plows. A jozzfer attachment should be secured 
also, The ideal combination uses both the jointer and the rolling 
colter, the latter being set forward. A weed-hook is usually sup- 
plied, and it is attached to the beam, being carried just ahead of 
the moldboard. It is of great assistance in turning under weeds 
or tall grass. A cable chain is frequently used instead of a weed- 
hook ; one end is fastened to the doubletree, behind the furrow 
horse, the other end to the beam, there being a long loop that 
is permitted to drag in the furrow just ahead of the moldboard. 
Sometimes this loop is weighted to hold it to the bottom of the 
furrow. This device is even more effective than a weed-hook.  
-P-A-G-E-276
  264 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Harrow attachments are now provided for both sulky plows 
and gang plows. They may be of either the spike-tooth or the 
disk type. They are fastened to the plow by a more or less rigid 
connection and can be raised from the ground by convenient 
levers. They are undoubtedly useful, particularly in the fall, when 
the upturned soil is rather lumpy and dries quickly. They insure 
immediate harrowing, a thing very much to be desired and too 
frequently neglected. 
Bearings. The bearings, particularly of the front and rear 
furrow wheels, are constantly covered with dirt, and must be 
dirt-proof as far as possible. Removable boxings should be pro- 
vided in order that wear may be taken up without the purchase 
of a new wheel or axle. In addition, means should be provided 
for oiling, so that this essential in the proper use of the plow will 
not be neglected. 
THE Ganc PLow 
Gang plows are now quite generally used in states west of 
Ohio, and are growing in popularity in the East. Farmers in the 
pe Rintranryater ss es. , 
is 4 chief reason being that 
farms are small and the 
horse power necessary 
is frequently not avail- 
able. There has also 
been a feeling that the

and that the quality of 
the work does not con-

THE PLOW 265, 
Types of gang plows. Gang plows are made in both frameless 
and high-lift types, the latter being far the more common. It 
may be predicted, however, that the frameless type will come 
into wider use as plowmen become familiar with it. 
Adjustments. The adjustments discussed under sulky plows 
apply to gang plows, also with the difference that the lead in the 
furrow wheels is usually greater in gang plows than in sulky plows. 
Hitches. The greatest objection to be urged against gang plows 
is that of side draft. Fig. 194 shows clearly just why there is 
side draft when 
4 horses are 
hitched abreast to 
a 2-bottom gang 
plow. Here the 
line of draft is 
shown to fall 16 
in. outside the 
line of load. The 
line of load is 
found by locating 
the theoretical 
points of resis- 
tance on the two 
bottoms as shown 
and described un-

this line at the middle. If 12-inch right-hand plows are used, this 
line would be 8 in. to the right of the shin of the land plow. Any- 
thing that brings the horses closer together will alleviate side draft 
but will not eliminate it. Fig. 195 shows how the beams of the gang 
plows of a certain company are set, in an effort to bring the line 
of draft and the line of load together. It should be noted, how- 
ever, that the change in the beams does not alter the line of load. 
The only way to eliminate side draft is to hitch tandem, In 
Fig. 196 a tandem hitch is shown in which longer doubletrees 
are used than shown in Fig. 194. That side draft is virtually 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  
266 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
eliminated is shown by the fact that the line of draft falls inside 
the line of load. Fig. 197 shows two methods of hitching thus. 
The pulley and cable is satisfactory for 2-horse teams, but the 
lever must be used for other combinations. While the tandem 
hitch makes the handling of the teams more awkward, especially 
in turning, its merits 
in other ways make 
one wonder why it is 
not more commonly 
used on gang plows. 
Disk plows. Disk 
plows, in which a roll- 
ing disk is substituted 
for the moldboard, 
share, and landside, 
are the result of an 
effort to reduce draft 
by transforming. slid-

come several plows of both moldboard and disk construction de- 
signed especially for this purpose. The double-disk plow, shown

results were secured. The tests were carried on in series ; that is, 
five furrows were run on a narrow land with the bare plow, then 
five with the jointer, five with the rolling coulter, and five with 
the combination, after which the second series was started. This 
was done in order that the soil conditions under which the dif- 
ferent attachments were tested might be as uniform as possible. 
The ground was uniform, and the tests were made within a period 
of six weeks. The general average represents the average of forty 
tests and is therefore fairly reliable. The figures give the draft

The furrows are clean cut, well proportioned, and properly turned. A jointer would improve 
the quality of the work 
in pounds per square inch of furrow slice. That is, the total pull 
in pounds was divided by the cross-sectional area of the furrow 
slice in order to reduce the results to a common basis of com- 
parison. The total draft of the furrows varied widely owing to the 
unavoidable variations in both the width and the depth of furrow. 
When the total draft, however, is reduced to terms of pounds per 
square inch of furrow slice, the variation in size of furrow is not 
material. The furrows averaged 7} in. in depth and 14 in. in width.

moldboard plows. Table XXVII gives the relative draft of the 
double-disk plow and a twelve-inch walking plow in a stiff timothy

CHAPTER XIX 
TILLAGE TOOLS 
In its broadest sense the term “ tillage tools” includes all tools 
used in the preparation of the soil for the seed. This would 
include the plow, but since plowing is a process so complete in 
itself and so different in its method, it seems logical to exclude 
the plow from the class of tillage tools, remembering, however, 
the statements made in the opening paragraph of Chapter XVIII. 
For the purpose of this discussion, then, tillage tools will include 
harrows, weeders, rollers, drags, and cultivators — chiefly those 
tools which are used in preparing plowed ground for the seed 
and in caring for the crops during their period of growth. 
Harrows 
The spike-tooth harrow. Next to the plow, the spike-tooth 
harrow seems to be the tool most common to Eastern and 
Western farms. It is virtually indispensable. Its chief use is as 
a leveler, since it will not penetrate hard ground to any depth, 
though it stirs the surface soil and crushes clods to some extent. 
The steel-bar harrow has been the most popular harrow in recent 
years. The bar is made in a number of different forms. Fig. 206 
shows several forms and several methods in common use for 
attaching the teeth to the bars. This is one of the points which 
should not be overlooked in purchasing a harrow. Some forms 
of clamps have a tendency to work loose, and if the teeth which 
they hold are not enlarged at the top, teeth will frequently be 
lost. In the best types of harrows the ends of the bars are 
protected by guard rails, as shown in Fig. 207, a feature which 
prevents them from catching on posts, stones, and other obstruc- 
tions. The teeth are usually triangular, round, or square. In 
any case they should be so fastened that they may be turned 
around and thus be, in a sense, self-sharpening. The teeth must 
273

-P-A-G-E-287
    
TILLAGE TOOLS 275 
not be too large, else they will make too much of a furrow, espe- 
cially when they gather trash. The levers should permit of a wide 
range in the adjustment of the angle of the teeth, this angle vary- 
ing from about 15° 
back of a vertical posi- 
tion to a_ horizontal 
position. Runners or 
some other device 
should be provided for 
transporting the har- 
row. These runners, 
The guard rails protect the ends of the bars and help to ona ee une a eaten tached to the bars, are 
: let down as the teeth 
are slanted backward. The first part of a harrow to wear out is 
usually the link attachment between the evener bar and the sections 
of the harrow. This 
connection, therefore, 
should be quite heavy. 
Of late the qwood- 
bar harrow (Fig. 208) 
seems to be coming 
back into favor. The 
wooden bars afford a 
rigidity of construction 
which is usually lack- 
ang 1 the steel-bar har- The wooden bars are stiff and afford simple means for 
row. The teeth are bracing. The bars should be riveted at each tooth 
usually driven through 
the wooden bar, and should be riveted on either side of the tooth. 
Following is a list of the common sizes of spike-tooth harrows :

without wheels. Wheels or runners should generally be included, 
since they enable the operator to control better the depth to which 
the teeth will penetrate and since they are a great aid in transport- 
ing the harrow from 
field to field. The 
teeth may be fur- 
nished with remov- 
able points, This is an 
advantage, since teeth 
of varying shapes and 
sizes may then be

flexible teeth do not cut off so many of the root crowns as does 
the disk. But for this particular purpose the points of the teeth 
should be long and narrow (Fig. 210), and if removable points 
are provided they can be changed to suit the kind of work being 
done. Fig. 211 shows 
a spring-tooth harrow

effectively in stirring very hard ground. It does not, however, 
adapt itself to as many different conditions as does the disk. 
The following sizes of spring-tooth harrows are in common use : 
Two-horse harrow, 1 5-tooth, cuts 44 ft. 
Two-horse or three-horse harrow, 17-tooth, cuts 54 ft. 
Three-horse harrow, 23-tooth, cuts 74 ft. 
Four-horse harrow, 25-tooth, cuts 8} ft. 
The disk harrow. The disk harrow, like the spring-tooth har- 
row, is used to stir the ground to a considerable depth. It is an 
all-around harrow, being adapted to a variety of conditions. It is 
very generally used 
in preparing plowed 
land for corn or other 
crops, in preparing 
corn-stubble land for 
oats in the spring or 
for wheat in the fall, 
in cultivating alfalfa, 
and, in recent years, 
in harrowing sod pre- 
vious to breaking. 
Fig. 213 shows a good 
type of the single disk 
harrow. 
There has been a 
distinct evolution in the size of the disk used in this harrow. 
A few years ago the disks were as small as 10 in. and 12 in. 
in diameter; now the prevailing sizes are 16 in. and 18 in. 
Other things being equal, the smaller disk will penetrate better 
than the larger one, but in working over trashy ground the small 
disk is not so effective, and it probably makes for heavier draft. 
The disks may be of the solid or of the cwtaway type, as shown 
in Fig. 214. The cutaway disk will penetrate hard ground, but it 
does not stir all of the soil to the same depth, or cut trash so 
completely as the solid type. The points are likely to bend, the 
bottom of the scallops become dull, and the disk as a whole is 
difficult to sharpen. 
  Fie. 213. A well-constructed disk harrow 
A truck is an indispensable attachment to most disk har- 
rows ; it lightens the burden of the team 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  TILLAGE ‘TOOLS 279 
The double, or tandem, disk is the more modern type of disk 
harrow. Fig. 214 illustrates a common construction. In the single 
disk harrow each gang throws the soil out, and consequently the 
ground is left uneven; to level the surface it is necessary to lap 
half on each succeeding round. With the double disk harrow the 
front gangs throw out and the rear gangs throw in, thus leaving 
the ground perfectly level. In addition, the disks of the rear 
gangs are so set that each runs between the furrows cut by the 
  Fic. 214. A tandem disk harrow with fore truck 
The rear gangs are of the cutaway type. Each of the 4 gangs is separately controlled. 
‘The rear gangs may be taken off 
two disks immediately ahead, thus stirring nearly every inch of 
the soil. The ground is covered twice as fast with a tandem disk 
as with a single disk of the same width, and at the same time 
the work is done more efficiently. The power required is, of 
course, increased, but it is not doubled. 
There are two general types of construction used in the tan- 
dem disk harrow. As shown in Fig. 214, one type is nothing 
more than a single disk harrow with another set of gangs at- 
tached behind by some coupling-device. This construction offers 
one advantage in that the rear gangs may be taken off and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
    280 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
harrow then used as a single disk harrow. This type is always 
provided with a tongue truck. It will be seen that the weight of 
the frame rests entirely on the front gangs, and that the rear 
gangs cannot be very rigidly connected to those in front. In 
very hard ground the rear gangs therefore have a tendency to slip 
to one side, so that their disks follow in the tracks of the disks 
on the front gangs. 
The other type of construction is shown in Fig. 215. There is 
no tongue truck, the frame being supported equally on the front 
  
  Fic. 215. A cutaway tandem disk harrow 
The frame is supported equally on the front and rear gangs. There is no fore truck with 
this type. A tongue may or may not be used 
and rear gangs; thus the gangs are rigidly connected. Because 
of the rigid connection of the gangs, this type of harrow is 
rather difficult to turn; it is, in fact, quite impossible to turn it 
squarely around. There is, however, no tendency for the rear 
disks to run in furrows made by the front disks. It is provided 
with a stiff tongue, but works as well or better without it. 
The factors which influence the depth to which a disk harrow 
will penetrate are (1) the angle of the disks, (2) the weight of 
the harrow, (3) the sharpness of the disks, (4) the size of the 
disks, (5) the dish of the disks, and (6) the angle of the hitch. 
Of these factors the first three are the most important, and all 
are within the control of the operator.
-P-A-G-E-293
  TILLAGE TOOLS 281 
The levers for varying the angle of the gangs should be con- 
veniently located and easily operated. In the tandem disk there 
are usually 4 levers, 1 for each gang. In a few harrows there 
are but 2 levers, 1 for the front gangs and 1 for the rear gangs. 
The latter construction is not so desirable as the former. 
The disks should be sharpened every two or three years. Very 
few farmers attend to this important matter. It is an easy task 
to remove the disks and have them ground on an emery wheel at 
the blacksmith 
shop. Sharp 
disks _ relieve 
the harrow of 
much strain ; 
if they are 
dull, the angle 
of the gangs 
must be in- 
creased if the 
disks are made 
to run deeply 
enough. This 
increases the 
pressure on the 
bearings. 
Whatever the type of harrow, there are certain things that 
should be looked after in purchasing. The bearings may be either 
of chilled iron or of maple soaked in oil; roller bearings are 
only occasionally used. The bearings should be amply long, well 
protected from the dirt, easily removable, and easily oiled. The 
last feature is extremely important. One of the best methods of 
oiling is shown in Fig. 216. A large cup on a short tube, which 
keeps it up out of the dirt, may be filled with cup grease or with 
oil. In oiling some harrows it is necessary to use a wrench in 
removing a setscrew, and if the wrench is not at hand the bear- 
ing is likely to go unoiled. Sometimes long tubes reaching up 
above the disks and closed at the top by a cotter-pin plug are 
provided. This is very satisfactory, though long tubes for con- 
ducting oil are always objectionable. Hard-maple bearings are

found to be satisfactory ; they reduce friction to a minimum, they 
wear well and are easily and cheaply replaced when worn out. 
The long bolts holding 
together the disks of each 
gang are called avdor bolts. 
They should be provided 
with heavy heads and nuts, 
and in harrows where the 
heads of the arbor bolts 
take the end thrust of the 
gangs (Fig. 216) there 
should be large and sub- 
stantial bumpers. The 
Fic. 217, An extension disk harrow bearings and the spools 
between the disks are sure 
to become worn because of this end thrust, and it should always 
be possible to take up the wear through the arbor bolts. 
In both single and double disk harrows there is a tendency 
for the inner ends of all the gangs to be forced out of the 
ground. Adjustable sxabding-blocks or bars should be provided 
to force these ends 
down and secure an 
even penetration at 
all points. 
A tongue truck

nished with the single- 
disk harrow. It takes

disk of the rear gangs is set 
3 in. outside of the cor- 
responding disk in front. 
The last two sizes have an 
extra disk in the middle to 
stir the soil between the 
two rear gangs, hence the 
odd number of disks. 
The Acme harrow. The 
Acme harrow is an ex- 
cellent tool for preparing 
sod ground for corn. The 
crooked knives have a 
slicing effect; they mash 
clods well and are very 
effective in leveling the 
ground. This type of harrow cannot be put to as many uses as 
the disk or the spring-tooth, and hence has never been widely used.

WEEDERS 
Although the spike-tooth harrow is used a great deal in stir- 
ring the soil after spring crops — chiefly corn and potatoes — are 
planted, the weeder is in many cases more effective. Its numer- 
ous fine teeth stir almost every inch of the soil and tear out 
weeds, but yet do not seriously injure corn or potato plants which 
may just be coming up. By many the weeder is used with good 
results when corn or potatoes are several inches high. It should 
not be used in early morning, when the young plants are brittle 
and easily broken. 
The best modern weeders are now supplied with wheels, such 
a weeder being shown in Fig. 220. This makes it possible to 
control the depth better and to turn the weeder more easily when 
in the field. The teeth should be long, small and sharp at the 
ends, with plenty of spring.

ROLLERS 
The roller is a tool that must be used with care and judgment. 
Properly used, it is efficient in the preparation of the seed-bed, 
but improperly used it does far more harm than good. It packs 
and firms the soil in dry weather, mashes lumps, and levels the 
land. In sod ground newly plowed it may be used with profit, 
since it presses the furrow slices against the subsoil and thus

ture land that has heaved badly the roller is the only effective 
tool. On plowed lands the roller should always be followed with 
a harrow to prevent the formation of a crust and to provide the 
necessary surface mulch. 
Homemade rollers are very satisfactory. A round log with lag 
screws in the end for supporting the frame is the simplest type, 
but a 1-piece roller is difficult to turn. A /og roller may easily 
be made in 2 pieces and will last for many years. Old mower

The whole makes an inexpensive and satisfactory drum roller. 
Cast-iron and steel rollers

(Fig. 221) are now widely 
used. One type has a narrow 
middle drum which may be 
removed for the purpose of

is up. A roller should be of

it must be heavy. The follow-

kind. It is a well-known fact that if the surface of the soil is 
ridged there will be less evaporation and less tendency to form a 
crust. In spite of this advantage, however, this type of roller has 
never come into com- 
| eure mon use. One reason 
- for this probably lies 
in the fact that it is 
not generally satisfac-

Fic. 227. The subsurface packer voller-crusher, shown 
in Fig. 223, is now 
on the market. This 
roller, which weighs 700 |b. for a length of 6 ft. and a diameter 
of 12 in., does unusually effective work in crushing clods. It pul- 
verizes and packs the soil, but at the same time leaves a ridged 
surface on which a crust will seldom form. This culti-packer, as 
one company calls it, is believed by many to be the best tool 
of its kind on the 
market, and it will 
undoubtedly become 
popular. Fig. 225 
shows this tool in 
action on the Ohio 
State University farm. 
It ‘will probably find 
its greatest use in the 
preparation of the 
seed-bed for spring 
and fall crops. It has 
been used with suc- 
cess on fields after the 
corn has been planted, a use which is especially beneficial in a 
dry season. The subsurface packer, shown in Fig. 227, is used 
very generally in semiarid regions, and by some in humid regions, 
with excellent results.

Dracs 
There are numerous forms of drags, all of homemade type. 
The drag is perhaps more valuable to the average farmer than 
the roller, since it is even more efficient than the roller in crush- 
ing clods, and is, besides, a 
good leveler. Figs. 229 and 
230 show two common types 
of drags. The common plank

all purposes. The drag made

materially in crushing clods A drag made of four 2x4 
scantlings placed one foot apart is used chiefly as a leveler. It 
may be made quite long, thus making short work of a field where 
the soil is already in fairly good condition. Eight feet is the 
standard length of a drag; 
if it is longer than this, it 
does not touch throughout 
its length at all times. Some 
attempts have been made to 
overcome the slight tendency 
there is for the soil to crust 
after its use, by driving a 
row of heavy spikes or harrow teeth through the back of the rear 
plank —a good practice if the teeth can be kept from bending 
and if there is no trash to be dragged.

CULTIVATORS 
The garden cultivator. This tool, shown in Fig. 231, ought 
to be more generally owned and used in the farm garden. Work 
can be much more rapidly done with it than with the hoe, 
and just as efficiently. There are so many different attachments 
adapting it to various uses that when it is once used it is 
always used.

The one-horse cultivator. No farm can do without its 1-horse 
cultivator. For cultivating the garden, small truck patches, and 
corn after it is too large for the 2-horse cultivator, nothing will 
take its place. There are many forms of shovels for this tool. 
There should be at least 
5 shovels, and the width 
of the cultivator should be 
easily adjustable through 
a wide range. The shovels 
should be adjustable as to 
depth, and it is often an 
advantage to be able to 
turn the two outer shovels 
to throw toward or away 
from the row, though

but it is almost useless among large weeds. Moreover it is rather 
difficult to keep it running smoothly when open to its full width. 
The two-horse cultivator. The walking cultivator (Fig. 233) is 
still in quite general use in the East. On farms cultivating large 
areas it is more rare, but 
even on such farms there 
are those who wish their 
corn cultivated the first 
time with the operator 
walking. This of course 
accords with the fairly well- 
established fact that it is 
not usual for an operatoi 
to do as good work in 
small corn when riding as 
when walking.

Not a great deal of importance need be attached to the distri-

forms, any one of which is satisfactory. The spring-tooth gang is

  292 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
more widely used on walking than on sulky cultivators. It does 
excellent work except in very hard ground, when the shovels are 
likely to bend back- 
ward too much. 
It will be noticed 
(Fig. 234) that there 
is a difference in the 
shape of the shovels.

tivator forward before it will be drawn to one side, and thir makes

it slow in action. It is necessary, too, that the feet be held 
firmly against the levers at all times, else if a stone or clod is 
struck the cultivator will swerve to one side. In rough ground 
this puts a constant strain on the operator. Shifting from side 
to side, as in crooked corn, makes the work hard for the team, 
as it imparts a constant seesawing motion to the tongue. Further, 
the distance between gangs cannot be varied quickly ; so that if 
a scattered hill is encountered a part of it is likely to be plowed 
out. On the other hand, 
for sidehill work this type 
is excellent; one is able 
to keep the cultivator up- 
hill and make it straddle 
the row. In cultivating 
around trees and stumps 
there is also a consider- 
able advantage with this 
cultivator. Likewise, in 
turning, it is possible to 
steer the wheels around 
hills of corn. The depth is 
controlled by the lifting- 
levers, and it is possible 
to force the gangs to a 
considerable depth even 
in very hard ground. The ‘The gangs are controlled by the foot levers. The 
gangs may be raised sepa- arched bars may be used to connect the two gangs; 
rately, or the levers may otherwise they work independently of each other 
be locked so that one 
lever will raise both gangs. A separate lever is provided to adjust 
the width between the gangs. There is always a tendency with 
this type of cultivator to set the gangs rather too far apart, 
especially if the corn is crooked. 
A pivot-gang, or treadle-guide, cultivator is shown in Fig. 237. 
The gangs are pivoted and controlled by a system of foot levers 
so placed that the feet are moved straight to the front to throw 
the gangs out. There is usually a spring to bring them back 
toward the row. Usually each gang is controlled independently

of the other, though an 
arch may be attached to 
the gangs so that they 
may be moved together. 
In cultivating crooked rows 
it is better to work then 
independently. Since the 
gangs are controlled di- 
rectly, they may be moved 
more quickly than in the 
pivot-axle type. More- 
over there is less strain 
on the operator, and the 
work is not so hard on 
the horses. It is possible, 
too, to swing the gangs 
in between hills if neces- 
sary, a thing which can- 
not be done with the 
pivot-axle type. There is 
less tendency to rack the 
cultivator, since nothing but the gangs are moved. On the other 
  
hand, each gang must 
usually be raised sepa- 
rately, there is no 
means of forcing the 
gangs into the ground, 
and on sidehills the 
control is not so com- 
plete as with the pivot- 
axle type.

the rear end of the tongue, and by swinging the seat to one 
side the direction of the frame and wheels is changed, so that 
when the cultivator is pulled forward it travels to one side just 
as in the pivot-axle type. 
The direct foot control, as the name implies, is a type in which 
the gangs are controlled by the feet, which are placed in stirrups 
on the gangs. Figs. 239 and 240 illustrate this type. The lifting- 
levers with handholds are not effective in guiding the gangs. The

This type is sometimes called a hammock-seat cultivator, since the seat is swung from the bars at either side of the operator 
great advantage of this type is that the feet control the gangs 
directly ; the work is harder than in the former types, however, 
since no leverage is taken advantage of in the movement of the 
gangs. This type is often called the hammock-seat cultivator, a 
feature greatly prized by some, since it not only gives greater 
freedom to the feet but affords a better view of the row than does 
the straddle-seat type. 
The parallel-beam feature is now found on many one-row and 
two-row cultivators. Fig. 242 illustrates this feature with the at- 
tendant advantage. It is seen that when the gangs are kept
-P-A-G-E-308
296 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
parallel while being shifted, the shovels always travel straight to 
the front and thus are effective to their full width at all times, 
  Fic. 241. Side view of a pivot-axle cultivator 
Notice the penetrating curve on which the shovels are stirring all of the soil ; 
but if the gangs are 
not kept parallel, the 
wide angle of shift 
makes it necessary to 
draw the shovels at an 
angle, and this destroys 
their effectiveness and 
leaves narrow strips 
of soil untouched. 
In many sulky cul- 
tivators, the tongue is 
thrown up as soon as set . 
“the gangs are raised, 
since the rider is so placed as exactly to balance the tongue with 
the gangs down. The balance-frame feature which is now found 
on some cultivators is so arranged as 
to shift the wheels when the gangs 
are raised or lowered, thus maintain- 
ing a balance at all times. In many 
cases this is automatically done. It 
should be possible in all types to ad- 
just the balance for operators of dif- 
ferent weights. . 
Since the width of rows which must 
be cultivated varies, there should be 
some easy means for widening and 
narrowing the cultivator. This should 
apply not only to the width of tread 
but to the distance between gangs 
and, if possible, between the shovels. 
It should be possible to raise and 
lower each shovel on its shank so that 
the depth next the corn row may be

an advantage, too, to be able to vary the width of the gangs. For 
example, in potato culture the practice is followed of cultivating 
immediately after planting. If the cultivator gangs can be Spread 
sufficiently to cover the 
space between the rows, 
it is sufficient to straddle 
alternate rows. Fig. 243 
shows a cultivator with 
this possibility. The bar 
supporting the shovels is 
pivoted in front and may 
be swung out at will.

and may be used until 
the potatoes are from 6 
to 8 in. high. It may be 
used on corn if the soil 
is not too lumpy.

properly care for more than 25 acres of corn. With 3 horses and 
a two-row cultivator, however, he should be able to handle at 
least 40 acres. With level land and with the rows straight it is 
possible to do fairly satisfactory work with this implement. 
There are two general types of two-row cultivators, as shown in 
Figs. 248 and 249. The one straddles and cultivates 2 rows; the 
other straddles 1 row and cultivates 2 spaces. With the first type 
it is possible, when cul- 
tivating in the direc- 
tion in which the field 
is planted, to straddle 
two rows planted at 
one passage of the 
planter. Such rows 
are exactly the same 
distance apart. This

The second type, which requires but 2 horses, is compact and 
easily handled. But since it cultivates 2 spaces, and since there 
are no two adjacent spaces in a field at a uniform distance apart, 
it is not possible to cultivate as close to the corn with it as with 
the former type. In several makes it is possible to use it either 
as a I-horse or a 2-horse cultivator, the outer gang on either 
side being removable.

SEEDING-MACHINERY 
The importance of the proper selection, care, and adjustment 
of seeding-machinery cannot be overemphasized. No matter how 
well the ground is fertilized nor how well it is prepared, if the 
machines for distributing the seed are not what they ought to be, 
good crops are impossible ; and if the seeding is poorly done, the 
loss is irreparable. No one can afford to take chances with an 
old corn-planter or grain-drill. Often indeed the investment in a 
new one yields a high return, 
CORN-PLANTERS 
The corn-planter has undergone many changes within the past 
ten or fifteen years. The old hand planter, or jobber, is now used 
only for replanting, or in sections where a small acreage is grown.

A, fulthill-drop; B, cumulative-drop round-hole; C, cumulative-drop edge-selection ; 
D, cumulative-drop flat-selection 
The older styles of horse planter, which made it necessary for 
the field to be marked out one way and for one man to drive the 
planter while another rode and dropped the two rows by tripping 
just as the planter shank crossed the mark, are now obsolete. 
That type of check-row planter too in which the wire turned the

plate is seldom found. In place of these types the modern 
cumulative-drop check-row planter is now almost universally used. 
Plates. The cumulative-drop check-row planter is fitted with a 
variety of plates suited to every purpose. Fig. 251 shows the 
types in common use. The /w//-hill plate is seldom used. The 
other types are all classed as camulative-drop plates, the idea being 
that but 1 kernel is selected at a time, the cells being large enough 
for but a single grain. In the full-hill plate it is quite possible to 
find 4 kernels small enough to fit into a 3-kernel cell, or 2 kernels 
  
  Fic. 252. An edge-selection plate (on the left) and a flat-selection plate as they 
operate in the bottom of the seed-box 
large enough to fill the same cell. On the other hand, it is 
quite impossible to find 2 kernels so small as to slip into a cell 
intended for but 1. It seems that there is less variation in the 
thickness of the kernel than in any other dimension, a circum- 
stance which is the fundamental reason for the design of the 
cumulative plates. Each planter is supplied with an assortment 
of plates adapted to small, to medium, and to large kernels. 
The drop. The drop is spoken of as being fwd/-h7/l or as being 
cumulative. In the first type a full hill is deposited as each cell 
is passed over the shank of the planter. In the cumulative drop, 
since each cell of the plate holds but a single kernel, it is neces- 
sary to accumulate the kernels one at a time until the full hill is
-P-A-G-E-315
  SEEDING-MACHINERY 303 
collected. This is accomplished by turning the plate through a 
portion of its circumference until the desired number of cells has 
passed over the upper valve. For this purpose a clutch is pro- 
vided which is tripped by the knot on the check wire and which 
turns the plate the desired distance. When this distance is 
reached, the plate is thrown out, of engagement until tripped 
again. This clutch is one of the extremely important parts of the 
modern planter and is usually the first part to cause trouble. It is 
essential, whatever the construction, that the parts engage quickly 
and positively, and that there be no chance of the plate’s slipping 
out of engagement until 
it is thrown out at the 
end of the travel. 
It will be noticed from 
Fig. 253 that the clutch 
is on the drop shaft, Rees 
which, in turn, revolves eae 
the plates. In the older 
check-row _corn-planters, 
each time the clutch was NW)i}}-three changes 
tripped the drop shaft was S 
turned through one com- 
plete revolution. The gear 
on the drop shaft which 
turned the seed-plate was 
so timed as to revolve the plate through one fourth of its cir- 
cumference. Hence, if there were 4 cells in each quarter of 
the plate, 4 grains would be deposited. If a 3-kernel hill were 
desired, it became necessary to put in a plate with 3 cells in 
each quarter. These planters were regularly supplied with 8-cell, 
12-cell, and 16-cell plates. If required, 10-cell plates were pro- 
vided, so arranged as to drop 2 kernels in one hill and 3 kernels 
in the next, thus suiting the fancy of those who felt that 3 kernels 
made the corn too thick and 2 kernels made it too thin. If each 
type of plate were furnished for small, for medium, and for large 
corn, at least 18 plates would be required for each planter. 
Nearly all of the planters now on the market, unlike the older 
planters, are equipped with a variable-drop device. This device Natible-drop clutch

is found in connection with the drop shaft, either on the clutch 
or at the plate. Fig. 254 shows a type in which the shifting 
lever controls the distance 
the drop shaft travels. 
Each time the clutch is 
tripped, if the lever is 
in notch No. 4 (the top 
notch), as shown in the 
lower figure, the drop shaft 
makes one complete turn, 
which causes 4 cells to 
pass over the upper valve.

No. 3, as it is shown in 
the upper figure, the clutch

Fig. 255 shows how the same thing is accomplished in another 
way. The clutch turns the drop shaft through one complete 
revolution each time it 
is tripped. The drive 
plate beneath the seed- 
plate has three rows

plate, and turns the plate through varying distances, according to 
whether 2, 3, or 4 kernels per hill are desired. In many ways this 
type is better than that shown 
in Fig. 254, since the clutch 
is not interfered with at all. 
Figs. 256 and 257 illustrate 
another type of planter clutch. 
In Fig. 256 the dog is locked 
in such a position that it does 
not engage with the notched

ously around the drop shaft.

The variable-drop device is an advantage where it is desired 
to plant the corn thinner on the poorer parts of the field, because 
it makes it possible for the 
operator to vary the number 
of kernels per hill in a single 
round without stopping the 
team. Further, not so many 
plates are required, since the 
assortment need vary only for 
the variation in size of kernel ; 
that is, there need be but 
three plates — small, medium, 
and large — for each box. 
The accuracy of drop is in- 
fluenced by several things. 
Perhaps the most important is 
the condition of the corn in regard to uniformity of kernel. Then, 
too, the kind of box bottom, the style of plate, the speed with 
        
  Fic. 257. The clutch shown in Fig. 256 
with the parts in engagement 
   
-P-A-G-E-318
  306 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
which the plate is driven, the accuracy of the valves, the rough- 
ness of the ground, the fullness of the corn-boxes, and, no doubt 
many other matters help affect the accuracy of the drop. 
It is possible for the operator to control the most variable 
factor —the uniformity of kernel—and reduce the inaccuracy 
to a minimum. In a series of tests on ungraded, hand-graded, 
and machine-graded corn, performed by students in the course 
in Farm Machinery at Ohio State University, the results are 
uniformly in favor of the machine-graded corn. 
The three grades were obtained as follows: the ear was butted 
and tipped and the remainder shelled. This remainder com- 
prised the hand-graded corn. After this grade was tested the 
butts and tips were mixed with the hand-graded corn, the whole 
forming the ungraded corn. This grade having been tested, the 
corn was run through a simple hand grader to obtain the machine- 
graded corn. The general average of several classes, the experi- 
ment extending over several years and embracing tests on at 
least seven different makes of planters, is herewith given:

The figures at the head of the columns represent the number 
of kernels per hill. The figures in the various columns give the 
percentage of hills having 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 kernels per hill. Thus, 
with a 3-kernel hill as the ideal, ungraded corn gave 77 per cent 
perfect ; the hand-graded, 84 per cent; and the machine-graded, 
86 per cent. These tests are not given as final by any means, 
but such a general average uniformly in favor of the machine- 
graded corn is worthy of careful attention. 
The construction of the bottom of the planter box has much 
to do in determining the accuracy of the drop. The plate should 
be so arranged as to aid the kernels in every possible way to find

their places in the cells of the plate. To this end the bottom 
should be cone-shaped, so that it turns the kernels up on edge 
in the edge-selection type, and thus puts them into a_ position 
    Fic. 258. A corn-planter check head 
A, valve rod; B, trip rope; C, check wire; 
D, trip arm. The wire is stationary to slip naturally into the cells. 
The cut-off spring should work 
smoothly and not too stiffly, 
else it will tend to knock ker- 
nels out of the cells unless 
they fill the cells perfectly. 
The edge-selection planter 
has been criticized because it 
cracks a good many kernels. 
This, it seems, is particularly 
true when the kernels are not 
of fairly uniform size, in which 
case it is possible for two 
kernels to slip endways into a single cell. When this cell reaches 
the cut-off spring both kernels may be knocked out of the cell, 
one only may be knocked out, or one or both may be broken 
off, This difficulty is not so likely to occur in well-graded corn. 
It is always advisable 
to test the planter after 
the seed corn is prepared, 
to determine the proper 
plate to use. The planter 
should be placed on a 
box or other support so 
that the wheels may be 
freely turned by hand, 
the valve rod tripped, and 
a hundred hills or so run 
out, a record being kept 
of the number of kernels 
in each hill. If there are

The valves. It has been said that the hill is accumulated 
on the upper valve of the planter shank. One other valve is 
  Fic. 260. Section of planter 
shank, showing the valves 
The upper and lower valves are 
closed, with a hill on each absolutely essential, and this is the one 
found in the bottom of the shank. 
These two valves are operated by the 
knot on the check wire, through the 
valve rod, as shown in Figs. 258 and 
259. They open and close in unison, 
the corn being dropped from the top 
valve as it opens, and caught on the 
lower valve, which opens and closes 
while the hill is dropping from the 
upper to the lower valve. 
It is possible, by holding these two 
valves open or by opening them very 
slowly, to allow both the lower and 
the upper hill to drop in the same 
place. This might happen if the team ~ 
were to stop while the knot on the wire 
  was in process of tripping the valves 
(Fig. 259). To safeguard against this 
possibility most planters have a third 
valve in the shank, placed about mid- 
way between the upper and lower valves, 
This intermediate valve is timed so as 
to open when the others close and close 
when the others open. Thus, in case 
the upper and lower valves are held 
open, the hill from the upper valve will 
be caught on the intermediate valve 
and held there until the others close, 
when it drops to the lower one. In 
ordinary field operation this valve does 
not function at all, since it closes and 
opens again before the corn from the 
upper valve reaches it. Figs. 260, 261, 
and 262 show the location and opera- 
tion of valves in the planter shank.

the corn are important. It should give the hill a slight backward

All three valves must be locked 
open when corn is being drilled direction, but should not deposit it with 
force, else if the speed of the team is 
rather fast it will throw the hill out of 
line and scatter it as well. 
Drilling. Experiments seem to in- 
dicate that, if the field is properly cared 
for, more bushels per acre can be grown 
from drilled than from checked corn. 
Ordinarily, however, the increased yield 
does not pay for the extra labor required 
to keep a drilled field free from weeds. 
To set a planter for drilling, it is 
necessary to open the valves and keep 
them open, and at the same time to 
permit the clutch to remain in engage- 
ment. This is done by drawing back 
the trip arm and fastening it in this 
position. If there is an intermediate valve, it must be opened and

planter shank for each revo- 
lution of the main wheels. 
In Fig. 253 it is seen that 
there are a number of 
sprockets on the main 
shaft by means of which 
the drop shaft may be 
driven at different rates. 
The actual drilling-distance 
for a particular setting is 
determined as follows: if 
the sprocket on the main 
axle has 18 teeth and that on the drop shaft 6 teeth, then for 
each revolution of the 
main wheels the drop 
shaft will turn three times 
around. The variable-drop 
lever is usually set in 
notch No. 4, so that for 
each revolution of the drop 
shaft 4 cells pass over the 
planter shank. Thus, 12 
kernels would be dropped 
for each revolution of the 
ground wheels, or in a 
distance of 94.24 in. for a 
wheel 30 in. in diameter.

Furrow-openers. Figs. 265, 266, and 267 show several styles 
of furrow-openers. The curved runner is satisfactory and is the 
runner in most common use. The séé runner is usually adapted 
to land where there are sticks, stones, and pieces of sod to con- 
tend with, the stub nose getting under such obstructions and 
throwing them to one side. The ask, either single or double, 
penetrates well, but is hard 
to guide, has bearings to 
wear out, and in mellow 
ground is likely to plant 
the corn too deep. 
Gauge shoes or depth- 
regulators, one type of 
which is shown in Fig. 265, 
are frequently used, and if 
the mellowness of the soil 
is variable they are of value. 
Many of the numerous 
makes may be attached to 
any planter. One manu- 
facturer attempts to secure 
more even depth by bring- 
ing the wheel up closer to 
the planter shank, thus. 
forcing the furrow-opener 
to follow the wheel over 
ridges and into depres- 
sions. The distance from 
the rear valve to the bot- tne grease-cup, 4, ona short tube, provides a com tom of the wheel in this venient method of oiling

distance found in the average planter. The construction is there- 
fore awkward, and the planter will never become popular. 
Covering-devices are sometimes to be advised and are found 
in various shapes. Fig. 268 shows one type and the method of 
attaching it. 
Wheels. The fen wheel is now almost universally used. It 
does not pack the ground immediately above the hill, and hence

this ground will not bake, as is often the case when the solid 
wheel is used. In very loose ground, however, or in a dry season 
the use of the solid wheel 
is to be advised. The 
double wheel is said to 
cover better than the 
single wheel, since it has 
more gather, but it is 
awkward and does not 
meet with general favor, 
though some prefer it. 
The check wire. The 
check wire is carried on a 
reel which may be swung 
from the main frame un- 
der the seat and driven by 
a sprocket and chain from 
the main axle or which

by friction from the main 
wheel. The advantage of this second method is said to lie in the 
fact that the last rows can be planted and the wire reeled up at 
the same time. The posi- 
tion, however, is awkward ; 
the weight of the reel un- 
balances the planter, and 
very few operators would 
attempt reeling up the 
wire while planting if, 
indeed, it were practicable. 
Wire may be furnished 
with knots 3 ft. 6 in. or 
3 ft. 8 in. apart and it is 
usually furnished in 80- 
rod lengths. At intervals 
of 5 or 6rd, are spreading links, at which places the chain may be 
separated for convenience in passing trees or similar obstructions.

Conveniences. Some planters are provided with double markers, 
making it unnecessary to 
the other. These markers 
are raised by levers oper- 
ated from the seat. Where 
there is only a single 
marker, it is well to have 
an arch on the planter 
to carry the end of the 
marker rope. In this case 
a ring is slipped from side 
to side on the arch, and 
there is no interference 
with the reins. 
At the rear end of the 
tongue is a device making 
possible an adjustment 
which keeps the planter 
shanks at the same angle 
though the height of the 
team may vary. By lower- 
ing the front part of the 
frame or by raising the rear 
end of the tongue in a 
slotted bracket, the bottom 
of the planter shanks may 
be thrown backward or for- 
ward and the hill made to 
fall in the proper line. 
There is an advantage in 
being able to see the corn at 
some point in its path from 
the box to the ground. A 
sight-feed arrangement, if 
present, is usually found at 
the top valve so that the

Fic. 271. A corn-planter with fertilizer attachment 
Fertilizer attachment. Many farmers desire to fertilize their 
corn in the hill. All planters may have an attachment such as 
that shown in Fig. 271 put on for sowing fertilizer. This is 
operated by a separate sprocket from the main shaft and deposits 
the fertilizer just behind 
the hill; it may also be 
set to sow in rows. It is 
not advisable to fertilize 
heavily in the hill. It is 
perhaps better to drill 
the fertilizer broadcast by 
means of a fertilizer-drill. 
However, a little fertilizer 
in the hill may have a 
beneficial effect.

set that it is in line with 
the last furrow and if 
possible in solid ground. 
After turning the team 
at the opposite end, the 
check wire, if it has not 
all been used, should be 
unjointed and the other 
stake set directly behind 
the planter tongue in 
solid ground. The chain 
should then be brought 
to a firm tension. After 
driving across the field 
the wire should be re- 
leased from the drop 
head, the team turned, 
and the stake reset 
straight back of the 
tongue. Great care should 
be taken to bring the 
chain to the same ten- 
sion as before while the 
stake is driven home. 
Some stakes are pro- 
vided with graduated 
springs which make it 
easy to secure the same 
tension every time.

This is the simpler of 
the two and is shown in 
Figs. 275 and 276. There 
is a fluted wheel for each 
furrow-opener, and all are 
mounted on a shaft run- 
ning from one end to the 
other of the grain-box. 
The shaft is run directly 
from the main axle by 
sprockets and chain. To 
regulate the guantity per 
acre, a greater or less por- 
tion of the fluted wheels 
is exposed to the grain in 
he box. A lever attached 
to the rear side of the drill- 
ox controls the shaft to 
which the wheels are fas- 
ened. A dial plate is 
usually found beneath this 
ever, on which is indi- 
cated the proper setting 
or different quantities of 
grain per acre. 
The. simplicity of this 
fluted-wheel feed is its 
best recommendation. Be- 
sides, it is quickly changed 
rom one rate of seeding 
o another, there being no 
roublesome tables or other 
directions to follow. (In 
some drills directions for 
setting the rate of seeding

are printed on perishable paper, and if this becomes destroyed 
or lost the owner is helpless. Drills with such a makeshift 
device should not be pur- 
chased.) A further advan- 
tage of the fluted-wheel 
feed lies in the fact that 
there is a wide variation 
in the quantity which it 
is possible to sow. The 
chief difficulty with this 
feed is that it cracks some 
of the kernels. This is 
especially true with the 
larger seeds, such as beans, Fic. 277. Aninternal double-run torce-feed cup

so that large seeds will pass 
under the fluted wheel without 
danger of cracking. Another 
objection that has been brought 
against the fluted-wheel feed 
is that it tends to bunch oats 
in seeding. 
The internal double-run 
force feed. Fig. 277 shows 
the construction of this type 
of feed. There is a double- 
throated seed-cup for each 
furrow-opener. One throat is 
relatively small and is intended 
for wheat, rye, and other small 
grains. The other is larger,

is covered by a metal lid; if the larger-throated side is in use the 
smaller side is covered. The little ribbed wheel, seen in the right- 
hand compartment (Fig. 277) forces out the grain, as the wheel 
is revolved by the shaft to which it is fastened. 
The guantity per acre is regulated by changing the speed of 
the ribbed wheel; if the revolving wheel turns out a given quan- 
tity in one revolution, two revolutions will turn out twice as much. 
There is always the same wheel surface exposed to the grain.

Many devices are used for varying the speed of the ribbed 
wheel. Figs. 278 and 279 illustrate two common methods. Per- 
haps the most common is the disk gear with the movable pinion. 
The feed shaft is operated by the movable-pinion shaft, and as 
the pinion is moved from the center outward on the disk gear 
the quantity per acre is increased. This pérmits as many rates 
of seeding as there are rows of teeth on the disk, usually from 
six to nine.

The chief advantage of this feed lies in the fact that it has 
a large throat on either side and will not crack the kernels of 
such grains as corn, cow- 
peas, etc. It probably is 
not so positive as the 
fluted-wheel feed, since 
the ribs on the internal 
wheel are rather small. 
The more or less complex 
device required to control 
the quantity per acre is 
objectionable, too. For ex-

a finger plate in the bottom 
of the box for each furrow- 
opener. These are re- 
volved by a common shaft. 
The fertilizer is carried by 
the fingers through gate 
openings in the back of 
the box and is knocked 
into the grain-tubes by 
small weights which play 
over the fingers as they 
revolve. The guantity per 
acre is controlled by varying the speed of the plate and by vary- 
ing the gate opening. By means of the two the quantity per 
acre may be varied from nothing to one thousand pounds or more. 
The speed of the plate 
is controlled as shown 
in the internal double-

advantage that it may be 
reversed when one end of 
the point becomes dull. 
It is essential that these 
points be kept sharp, a re- 
quirement which necessi- 
tates their being removed 
and sharpened every two 
years at least. The hoe 
clogs somewhat in trash, 
but if a zigzag setting is 
used, the trash must be 
very thick to cause much 
difficulty. There seems to 
be a tendency on the part 
of many farmers to return 
to this type of furrow- 
opener after having used 
the disk type for a num- 
ber of years. 
The single-disk furrow- 
opener, shown in Fig. 292, 
has good penetration, cuts 
through trash well, and 
does not easily clog. On 
the other hand, the bear- 
ing becomes worn, the 
disk loosens, and, owing 
to the fact that one half 
of the disks on a drill will 
throw the soil down the 
grade, it does not cover 
well on sidehills. In fact 
it is not easy to cover well 
on the level in soil that is 
not thoroughly prepared.

not penetrate hard ground 
so well as the single disk,

for the double-disk furrow-

sown in a double row, and 
that, because of this better 
distribution, larger yields 
are insured. As shown in

Covering-devices. It is often found advisable to use a covering- 
device. The most common type is the drag chain. There are 
various types of press-wheels, too (one of which is shown in 
  Fic. 294.. A double-disk furrow-opener Fig. 298), which are use- 
ful in a dry season. 
Size of drill. The size 
of the drill is determined 
by the number of rows 
it will sow and by their 
distance apart. A drill 
sowing 12 rows with the 
rows 7 in. apart is known 
as a 12x 7 drill. It is 
advisable, unless the land 
is too hilly, to buy a drill 
with at least 9 furrow- 
openers, and a drill having 10 or 12 can be drawn by 2 horses 
on level land without difficulty. A drill with 12 furrow-openers 
is usually supplied with either a 2-horse or a 3-horse hitch.

the width of the corn rows should determine, in part at least, 
the width of the drill. For example, a 12 x 7 drill will just cover 
2 corn rows where the rows are 3 ft. 6 in. apart. 
Not many years ago all drills were built with 
the furrow-openers 8 in. apart. Recently, how- 
ever, narrower rows have been very much in de- 
mand among farmers, and there are now more 
7-inch drills on the market than any other size. 
Some drills are made with 6-inch rows, and a few 
companies are making a drill with rows only 4 in. 
apart. Experiments have not proved conclusively 
that there is any advantage in this narrowing 
of rows.

In some drills it is possible to turn the wheel forward several 
inches before the pawls engage the ratchets and start the seeding ; 
consequently there are frequently seen in drilled fields bare strips 
  Fia, 298. A single-disk drill with press-wheel attachment 
several inches wide and as long as the width of the drill. These 
bare strips show that the drill was stopped at this point and that, in 
starting, the wheels moved forward quite a distance before the pawls 
engaged the ratchets in the hub; there should be at least three 
pawls in each hub, and no two should engage at the same time. 
Lost motion in the gears would bring about the same difficulty. 
The frame. A heavy, substantial frame is essential. Not only 
must it carry the drill-box with its grain, fertilizer, and grass seed, 
but it must be substantial enough to hold all gears in perfect 
alignment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
  SEEDING-MACHINERY 329 
Convenient attachments. Every grain-drill should be equipped 
with a surveyor. It is quite unlikely that a drill will sow all kinds 
of fertilizers with equal accuracy and ac- 
cording to specified setting, but if the 
operator watches the amount put in the 
box and observes the surveyor while sow- 
ing this known quantity, he can check 
the fertilizer-setting. The same is also 
true of the grain and the grass seed, 
especially of the latter. All parts should 
be well protected, so that fertilizer will 
not fall on the gears and cause them to 
rust and thus become difficult to set and 
to operate. 
A footboard. upon 
which the operator may 
stand is of service. The 
operator can watch the 
drill and the team better 
while riding, and his weight does. not materially 
affect the draft. 
A power lift is desirable for the larger sizes ; 
that is, for drills having 16 or more furrow- 
openers. If there are as many as 12 furrow- 
openers, they should be arranged in 2 sections, 
with a lifting-lever for each. 
All parts should be automatically thrown out 
of gear when the hoes or disks are raised and 
should likewise be thrown in gear when these 
are lowered. Further, it should be possible to Fic. 300. A steel

Calibration of the drill. Every drill should be 4s the furrow-openers 
frequently tested to ascertain whether it is sow- ee 
ing the desired amount of grain per acre. It is not uncommon 
to find an error of 25 per cent in the setting of drills. This error 
will vary with the kind and purity of grain used. Seed grain   
      
Fic. 299. Steel-ribbon seed-

    330 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
should always be recleaned. There are aliways straw joints, if 
nothing else, left in by the thresher, and these will clog the drill 
and lead to inaccurate sowing. 
To calibrate the drill it is necessary to raise one or both wheels 
off the ground. The number of revolutions to seed one acre 
should be determined by dividing the area of one acre by the 
width of the drill, and this by the circumference of the wheel. 
For example, if the drill has 12 disks 7 in. apart it will sow a strip 
7 ft. wide; then, 43,560 +7= 6222.8 ; 6222.8 +12.56 = 495.4, 
the number of revolutions required to seed 1 acre. The drill should 
then be set at a certain rate, the box filled with grain, and the 
wheel turned through a sufficient number of revolutions to seed ~ 
4 acre or } acre. The weight of the grain delivered is then 
determined. A comparison of this weight with the setting of 
the drill will demonstrate the error if there is one. 
Care of the drill. Each season, after the drill is stored away, 
all parts should be thoroughly cleaned, especially if fertilizer has 
been used. The metal parts corrode rapidly if fertilizer is left in 
the box all winter or through the summer. The disks of a disk 
drill should be well cleaned and oiled or greased. The bearings 
become filled with dirt and will rust if not cleaned and oiled. 
One hour spent in such work at the proper time will save several 
hours’ work later, and besides do much to keep the operator in 
even temper. 
One-horse drills and hand drills. There are on the market 
several one-horse drills devised for sowing grain or grass seed in 
standing corn. There are also several types of hand seeders now 
in use for seeding lawns. They are very effective and give an 
even distribution of seed, covering it at the same time. 
Alfalfa drills. The extensive growing of alfalfa has been 
largely responsible for the manufacture of a drill for sowing all 
kinds of grass seed. As now made, this is usually a disk drill 
having 20 disks 4 in. apart. It is really a grain-drill on a small 
scale, the disks being only from 8 to roin. in diameter. This 
seeder is also made with a fertilizer-compartment. 
This type of seeder is coming to be widely used in sowing 
clover seed in wheat in the spring of the year. If this custom 
is followed it is necessary to wait until the ground is in tillable 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  SEEDING-MACHINERY 331 
condition. It. is claimed that the drill effects a saving in seed, 
since a much larger percentage of the seed will germinate if it 
is covered when put into the ground. It is further claimed that 
the cultivation which the wheat 
receives during the seeding of 
the clover is beneficial. 
Broadcast seeders. Many types 
of broadcast seeders are on the 
market. They are used for sow- 
ing all kinds of grass seed and 
some larger grains, chiefly oats.

sack seeder. The wheel in front

The distributing-wheel in this type of seeder crank. This wheel has several 
Sas ea et radial ribs which scatter the seed 
in all directions as it falls upon it through the graduated open- 
ing above. In some types of knapsack seeders, and usually in the 
more common type, the wheel revolves in a horizontal plane; in 
other forms there are two wheels, one above the other, the upper 
receiving one half of 
the seed and revolving 
in one direction, the 
lower wheel receiving 
the other half and re- 
volving in the opposite 
direction. The two 
wheels, it is thought, 
result in a more even 
distribution of the 
seed. In older seeders 
the wheel was revolved 
by a fiddle-bow action, Fic. 302. An end-gate broadcast seeder

being wrapped about 
the axle of the wheel in such a way as to revolve it first in one 
direction and then in the other. The objection to this type was 
that the wheel came to a full stop at both ends of the stroke.

The wheelbarrow seeder has never come into very wide use. 
There seems to be no question that the seed can be more evenly 
distributed with this type than with any of the knapsack seeders, 
since the box is carried close to the ground, and the seed does 
not have far to fall. An agitator which is kept constantly mov- 
ing inside the box prevents the holes through which the seed 
passes from clogging. The fact that clover seed is very often 
sown early in the spring when the ground is frozen or rough has 
prevented the wide use of this seeder. 
The end-gate seeder, shown in Fig. 302, is constructed on the 
knapsack principle and is used where large areas are to be sown. 
It finds a wide use in oat-growing sections where the seed is 
sown broadcast.

  CHAPTER: XX1 
MANURE-SPREADERS 
There is no longer any question as to the utility of the manure- 
spreader. Being a labor-saver, it is regarded as a necessity on 
every farm producing from seventy-five to one hundred loads of 
manure per year. In the application of manure with the spreader 
there is real economy, too, since it is the means of making a 
  
  
  Fic. 303. An endless-apron manure-spreader 
given amount of manure cover a greater acreage and cover it 
more effectively than when it is spread thickly, as is nearly always 
the case when the work is done by hand. 
The apron. The apron and the means of driving it constitute 
one of the vital parts of the spreader. There are three types of 
aprons in common use: (1) the endless apron, (2) the return 
apron, and (3) the solid bed with carrier. 
The endless apron is shown in Fig. 303. It consists of an 
endless web passing around the front and rear apron shafts. 
The web is held together by two, sometimes by three, endless 
chains, to the links of which the slats of the apron are fastened. 
In some spreaders the slats are riveted to the chain links, but it 
333
-P-A-G-E-346
334 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
is much better to have them bolted, in order that broken parts 
may be easily replaced. 
Between the front and rear shafts the upper fold of the apron 
is supported on bed rails as shown in Figs. 304 and 305. If there 
are but two of these, the 
slats must be very strong 
to support the load prop- 
erly without undue sag- 
ging. A third rail through 
the middle of the apron 
slats makes possible more 
substantial construction. 
Fastened to these rails, as 
shown in Fig. 304, are 
small pulleys which carry 
the entire weight of the 
load, thus reducing fric- 
tion to a minimum. The 
  Fic. 304. A substantial apron support 
The middle bed rail keeps the slats from sagging in TOllers should be firmly 
the middle, The rollers which carry the apron are fastened to the bed rails 
mounted between the bed-rail parts by . heavy bolioreal lag 
screw. In some spreaders the bed rail is grooved and the pulleys 
are supported in this groove. This construction occurs more often 
when steel rails are 
used, but whether steel 
rails are used or not, 
excellent support is pro- 
vided for the pulleys. 
As compared with 
the return apron the 
endless type is simple 
in construction, since   
      
no reversing gears are 
necessary. The apron 
is always ready to load; 
that is, it does not have to be run back after the load is off, as is 
the case with the return apron. No front end-gate is required 
either, a circumstance which eliminates a possible source of trouble. Fic. 305. Another good apron support 
The rollers are bolted to the sides of the outer bed rails

MANURE-SPREADERS 335 
Further, with this type of apron it is possible on long hauls to 
pile the manure above the highest loading-line, and so after the 
apron has been run back a short distance the top of the load may 
be thrown forward. On the other hand, this apron is very heavy, 
since both upper and lower folds are slatted. Manure that filters 
through the cracks in the upper fold lodges, in part at least, on 
the lower fold, and in freezing weather may be the source of 
some trouble; one company overcomes this difficulty by hinging 
the slats on one edge (Fig. 306), so that they turn down as they 
pass along the under fold, and thus allow any trash to fall to the 
ground, There is some difficulty in spreading the very last of the 
load evenly with the endless type, for when all but three or four 
  
    
Fic. 306. An endless apron with hinged slats 
bushels of the load has been spread, the remainder is rolled back- 
ward by the beater, and it is quite impossible to spread this last 
bit at the same rate as the rest of the load. This fault may be 
partially overcome by speeding up the apron at the finish. 
The return apron, as shown in Fig. 307, is very similar in con- 
struction to the endless apron except that but one fold, the upper, 
is slatted. The load is run off and the apron then returned to 
its original position before loading is started again. A front end- 
gate is provided which moves back with the apron, and conse- 
quently the load is spread evenly to the finish. The end-gate is 
circular in form, to fit the shape of the beater, so that all of the 
manure is picked up and thrown out by the beater. Since but 
one fold of this apron is slatted, it is much lighter in weight than 
the endless type, and all danger of fouling is eliminated. In load- 
ing this type of apron from the rear, as from a stable door, it is  
-P-A-G-E-348
  336 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
possible to return it only part of the way, and after the front end 
is loaded the apron may be completely returned by hand and the 
rear end loaded. It is also possible to stop this apron at any point 
while unloading, without stopping the beater, by simply pressing 
  
    
Fic. 307. A manure-spreader with a return apron 
There are no slats on the lower fold 
the return-gear lever. This is an advantage in crossing swales or 
similar places where no manure is needed. On the other hand, 
this type of apron requires a reversing gear to return it after each 
load is run out. Formerly this gear gave much trouble, but in 
modern spreaders little difficulty is had with it. It consists of a 
  
    
Fic. 308. A spreader having a solid bottom with carrier apron 
positive clutch on the rear axle, which is thrown in gear by a 
foot lever near the seat. The clutch is held in gear only dur- 
ing the time the foot lever is held down. When the apron is 
completely returned, the lever on which the foot rests is thrown
-P-A-G-E-349
  MANURE-SPREADERS 337 
upward and the clutch disengaged. The front end-gate is a point 
of weakness in this apron; it is usually not very well supported, 
and there is danger of its running into the beater if the device 
for throwing the beater out of gear is not properly adjusted. 
This arrangement is automatically controlled. 
The solid bottom with carrier, which is used on several makes 
of spreaders, is shown in Fig. 308. The load is pushed back over 
the solid bed by the endless carrier, This type affords unusually

The power to operate the ratchet-wheel is taken from the beater shaft 
substantial construction for bed and frame, but it would seem that 
there is a noticeable disadvantage in sliding the load as against 
carrying it on rollers. In hauling very dry manure the carrier is 
likely to slip under the load, though this seldom happens. 
The apron drive. The mechanism for driving the apron con- 
stitutes one of the weakest points in any spreader. There are two 
common methods in use: (1) the ratchet drive, and (2) the worm- 
gear drive. 
In the vatchet drive, shown in Fig. 309, the ratchet-wheel is 
mounted on the rear apron shaft. This wheel is actuated by one 
pawl — sometimes by two—the pawls in turn being driven by
-P-A-G-E-350
  338 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
an upright arm pivoted at the bottom and receiving a recipro- 
cating motion from the pitman driven by the beater shaft. The 
quantity per acre is regulated by raising or lowering the horizon- 
tal arm connected directly to the pawls on the upright arm driven 
by the pitman. 
As compared with the worm-gear drive, next to be discussed, 
this method of driving the apron has several advantages. In 
the first place the rachet-wheel is usually large — much larger 
as a rule than the spur gear actuating the shaft in the worm-gear 
drive — and therefore greater leverage is possible. There are not 
that constant strain and 
steady grind so noticeable 
in the worm-gear drive. 
Moreover there is a wide 
range in the number of 
loads that it is possible 
to apply per acre, this 
range in some cases ex- 
tending from nothing to 
sixty-five loads per acre. 
It is possible, too, to 
change the rate of spread- 
Fic. 310. A rachet drive in which the power jing while the team is in 
is taken directly from the rear axle motion, without danger 
of breaking any of the 
parts. 
On the other hand, this drive imparts an intermittent motion 
to the apron. While the effect of this cannot be noticed in the 
spreading, the load must be started from a dead stop following 
each backward travel of the pawls, thus forcing an excessive 
strain on the teeth of the ratchet-wheel. In frosty weather the 
teeth are likely to be stripped from the gear, though if good 
material is used in its construction this seldom happens. In the 
cheaper spreaders this wheel is frequently made of cast iron and 
the teeth are easily stripped. The power for driving the ratchet- 
wheel is in nearly all cases taken from the beater shaft. This is 
objectionable because the beater is subjected to a great strain in 
doing its own work, and if it must drive the apron in addition it is 
  The quantity per acre is controlled by regulating the 
backward travel of the pawls  
-P-A-G-E-351
  
  MANURE-SPREADERS 339 
the more likely to be strained or broken. One company resorted 
to a very ingenious device to overcome this objection, as shown 
in Fig. 310. The ratchet- 
wheel in this device is 
driven directly from the 
rear axle by a set of cams. 
In still another spreader, 
where the beater is on the 
axle, the ratchet drive is 
used for the apron, the 
power being taken from 
the axle through an eccen- 
tric (Fig. 311). In most 
‘ cases where the ratchet

is taken directly from the rear axle by an ing to prevent the apron

from racing; that is, 
running backward faster 
than it is being driven, as in going up a hill. Then, too, the 
apron in such cases has a tendency to work back in driving to 
the field, especially if the 
road is rough or upgrade. 
If there is no rear end- 
gate, this jars the load 
into the beater. To over- 
come this objection some 
companies put a brake 
on the front apron shaft 
to be operated by the 
driver if the apron has a 
tendency to race. 
The worm gear is 
shown in Fig. 312. The Fic. 312. A worm-gear apron drive

to the rear axle, or it may 
be mounted on a separate stud just to the rear of the axle but 
driven by it. There are usually four rows of teeth on this gear. 
  The beater of this spreader is on the rear axle 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  340 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Extending from it back to the spur gear on the rear apron shaft 
is a short countershaft on the front end of which is a movable 
pinion which may be set to mesh with any one of the four rows 
of teeth on the disk gear. On the rear end of this short shaft 
is the worm gear, which meshes with the spur gear on the apron 
shaft. The quantity per acre is regulated by shifting the movable 
pinion on the disk gear. 
By comparing the worm-gear drive with the ratchet drive it 
will be seen that this drive takes its power directly from the rear 
axle, thus relieving the beater of extra strain. It gives a uni- 
formly steady motion to 
the apron, and the apron 
will not race, since it can- 
not move backward faster 
than it is driven by the 
gears. On the other hand, 
there is a great strain 
on the worm and_ spur 
gears as well as on the 
disk gear and pinion. If 
all parts are not held in 
Fic. 313. A worm-gear apron drive in which proper alignment and kept 
the disk gear shown in Fig. 312 is replaced thoroughly greased, they

Many companies are now inclosing the worm and spur gears in 
a tight casing so that the parts may be run in a bath of oil. If 
the oil bath is not present, axle-grease, and not oil, should be 
freely used several times a day when the spreader is in use. 
There are usually but four changes possible in the rate of spread- 
ing, but this range in most cases covers the rates in common 
use. It is not safe to attempt to change the rate of spreading 
while the team is in motion for fear of stripping the disk gear 
or pinion. All things considered, the ratchet drive will probably 
give the average operator less trouble than the worm-gear drive 
and will give longer service. 
A combination ratchet and worm-gear drive is shown in 
Fig. 314. The crank on the small pinion driven by the spur 
gear on the rear axle actuates the pawl arm. With such a drive 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
MANURE-SPREADERS 341 
the apron is locked so that it does not race and cannot be jostled 
backward while going to the field with the load. 
The beater. The beater must spread all kinds of manure in 
various states of physical condition. It must therefore be very 
strong and well supported on its bearings. These bearings could 
well be self-aligning, since the bed in time is likely to become 
racked, in which case stiff bearings will cause undue friction. 
The bars of the beater may be made of either steel or wood. 
Whatever the material, the teeth must be firmly fastened to them. 
In several makes us- 
ing wooden bars the 
teeth are simply driven 
into the bar. This, 
however, is poor con- 
struction; the teeth 
should pass through 
the bar and be fast- 
ened by a nut. Some 
are riveted, but in 
case a tooth is broken 
it is rather difficult to 
replace it. 
There is consider- 
  Fic. 314. A combination ratchet and worm-gear 
able variation as re- apron drive 
gards the position of This circular type of beater is placed above the apron 
the beater in relation 
to the apron. Sometimes the beater is placed well forward and 
above the upper fold of the apron (Figs. 313 and 314), the ends of 
the teeth in their lowest position just clearing the slats. In this 
position the teeth are forced to work against the manure as it pre- 
sents itself, thus adding to the total draft. In other spreaders the 
beater is quite to the rear end of the apron (Fig. 320), the teeth 
extending below the line of the apron’s upper fold. In this posi- 
tion the teeth receive the manure and lift it upward with the least 
possible draft. In the first position the beater would be more 
efficient as a pulverizer, but the beater working against the 
manure must literally dig its way through, thus probably slightly 
increasing the draft. 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  342 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
It is frequently found to be difficult to spread manure evenly 
the full width of the spreader bed, there being a tendency to 
spread most thickly at the middle. To overcome this trouble each 
beater bar is sometimes 
made in two parts and 
these parts set at an angle 
to the beater shaft ; that is, 
each bar makes a wide V 
with the point of the V at 
the middle of the beater. 
This tends to throw the 
manure outward from the 
center. In another form 
the beater is composed of 
two sections (Fig. 315). 
One company places a cir- 
cular beater on its spreader 
Fic. 315. A V-shaped beater made in two (Fig. 316). This type of 
Seer eae beater will spread much 
wider than the bed. It is claimed that the circular beater makes 
better traction possible, in that it is not necessary to run one 
wheel on manure previously spread, as is the case with the 
average spreader. 
In this connection 
it should be said that 
there are several wide- 
spreading devices on 
the market. All of 
these consist of an 
additional attachment 
put on just to the rear 
of the regular beater. 
In one type large pans 
are provided which are 
placed in a horizontal position. These pans receive the manure 
from the beater and, being revolved at a rapid rate, spread the 
manure in a strip two or three times as wide as the spreader 
bed. Another company has a similar device except that the pans

  MANURE-SPREADERS 343 
revolve in a vertical plane. It does not seem, however, that it 
is at all necessary to equip a spreader with this extra mechanism. 
It adds a great deal to the cost and increases the draft of the 
spreader. Moreover it is possible without such an attachment to 
spread the manure as thinly as it should ordinarily be spread. 
The proper loading of the spreader has a great deal to do 
with the way in which the contents will be spread. In loading 
a wagon it seems easier to throw the manure into the bed, piling 
it up in: the 
middle and let- 
ting it roll off 
on either side. 
As a_ result 
the load is 
packed much 
more in the 
middle than 
on the side.

and set as shown, secures a more even distribution 
not possibly 
spread the load evenly the full width of the bed. The manure as 
loaded should be spread evenly over the bottom of the bed, and 
if rather dry material is being handled it should be well tramped 
when the box is nearly filled. In case rather heavy, coarse mate- 
rial is being handled it will be spread much more easily if, in 
loading, the load is started at the front end and continued to the 
rear. In hauling flaky sheep manure the beater will tear up the 
flakes better if the reverse order is followed in loading. 
The beater drive. There are two methods in general use for 
driving the beater and for reversing its motion; that is, for driving 
it in a direction opposite to that of the travel of the rear wheels. 
The first of these is shown in Fig. 318. The large sprocket 
passes around the main axle. It is not fastened directly to the 
axle, but by means of a lever conveniently operated by the driver
-P-A-G-E-356

  EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
it may be made to revolve with it. Fig. 319 shows a section of 
the rear axle with the sprocket wheel

‘This method uses sprockets, chains, and gears 
  it is possible to use either one of two 
speeds, the higher speed being used 
when applying the manure in large 
quantities per acre. 
This method transmits the motion 
and reverses it at the beater, An- 
other similar method reverses the 
motion at the main axle and then 
transmits it to the beater. The latter 
method probably provides a more 
substantial support for the reversing 
gears, but because of minor difficul- 
ties in throwing the beater into and 
out of gear it is seldom used. 
The second method used for driv- 
ing the beater is shown in Figs. 320 
and 321. This method uses sprockets 
and chains alone. The idle pulley to and clutch used to throw 
the beater into and out

from this sprocket to an- 
other sprocket carried on a 
separate stud, which is fas-

Fastened to this sprocket 
is a large spur gear which 
in turn meshes with a 
smaller gear on the beater 
shaft. The motion is re- 
versed and at the same 
time multiplied at this 
point. The beater usually 
makes about fifteen revo- 
utions to one revolution of the main wheels. On some spreaders

stud carries a second, larger sprocket which drives the sprocket 
on the beater shaft. 
This method possesses the great advantage of all chain drives, 
namely, it has no gear teeth to break; for it is better to break

evident; the chain working over the main sprocket engages 
only a few teeth. But even at that more teeth take the strain 
than in the case of the two spur gears in the first method. 
One company places the 
beater on the rear axle, 
such a_ spreader being 
shown in Fig. 322. This 
position calls for a differ- 
ent method of driving.

motion to the outer shell of the gear-case to which the beater is 
fastened. There is a great advantage in having all of the gears 
used in driving the beater inclosed in a tight case and running 
in oil. There seems to be no reason why this mechanism should 
not give satisfaction. 
The rake. Several different types of rakes are shown in the 
different illustrations in this chapter. A rake of some kind is 
necessary on every spreader, for without it the manure will be 
thrown out in bunches, and lumps will not be effectively broken 
up. The rake should have long, flexible teeth so that the load

This construction affords substantial support for the beater 
will not be clogged easily. In some spreaders a second beater 
which is smaller than the main beater and placed just above 
and to the front of it takes the place of the rake, as shown 
in Fig. 327. It revolves in a direction opposite to that of the 
main beater and assists materially in breaking up lumps and 
in securing even spreading. 
The rear end-gate. -Without a rear end-gate the manure in 
loading or in driving to the field is packed against the beater ; 
and as a result, when the spreader is thrown in gear, the beater 
throws out a bunch of manure. An end-gate of some kind pre- 
vents this difficulty and at the same time makes it easier to start 
the spreader. In some spreaders the rake and the end-gate are  
-P-A-G-E-359
  MANURE-SPREADERS 347 
combined. A lever is provided for raising and lowering the 
device. When lowered, it serves as an end-gate ; when raised, as 
a rake. In at least one make the rake automatically drops when 
the load is off, serving in the capacity of 
an end-gate when down. When the un- 
loading begins, the manure automatically 
raises the end-gate to the proper position 
for a rake. 
In Fig. 329 may be seen a novel ar- 
rangement used to prevent the manure 
from packing against the beater. This is 
a sort of concave, the bars being circular

Ee fore per shown spreader is being loaded, these bars are 
eee turned forward a few inches so that the 
manure cannot touch the beater. When the spreader is thrown 
in gear, the bars of the concave are thrown backward until they 
almost touch the beater bars. In this position the teeth of the 
beater project through the concave, and the manure is more 
effectively torn to pieces 
than would otherwise be 
the case. 
The wheels. Spreader 
wheels are now rather 
generally made of steel, a 
material which enables 
them to withstand wear 
and to afford good trac- 
tion. A weak point in 
many steel wheels, how- 
ever, is found in the con- 
struction of the rim. The Fic. 324. A combination chain and planetary-

the tire to prevent the 
wheels from slipping sideways ; but this forms a channel in which 
mud and slush or dust collect. This material is carried upward as 
the wheel revolves and is dropped over the gears of the spreader. 
     
-P-A-G-E-360
  348 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
This trouble may be largely overcome, however, if several large 
holes are provided in the tire to let water and slush drain out. 
  Fic. 325. Method of driving the circular beater The truck. The 
front truck of the 
spreader may be either 
wide or narrow. It is 
said to be wide when 
it is the same width 
as the rear truck. 
In soft and slippery 
ground the front 
wheels of the wide 
truck sink through to 
hard ground and so 
give better traction 
for the rear wheels. 
With the narrow truck four separate tracks are made, and while 
the rear wheels may have a tendency to slip occasionally, it is 
seldom that any of the four tracks are deep enough to damage 
the turf. Where but two 
tracks are made, as with 
the wide truck, they are 
frequently so deep as to 
damage the sod. The 
narrow truck whips the 
tongue less than the wide 
truck, because of decreased 
leverage. The wide truck, 
as a general rule, offers 
better support for the bed. 
Fig. 308 shows a com- 
mon method of attaching 
the front truck to the bed.

In a few spreaders a single wheel in front takes the place of 
the truck. This construction has never been very popular, though 
on level land there is no objection to the single wheel. Of course

all whipping of the tongue is prevented, and there is no undue tip-

into a hole. There is, however, a tendency for the single wheel 
to slide when the spreader 
is turning a sharp corner. 
In Fig. 333 is to be 
seen a novel type of truck. 
The wheels here are of 
the automobile construc- 
tion, there being no fifth

an unusually strong sup-

the bed, and there is no 
whipping of the tongue. 
While it is not possible to 
turn so short as with the other trucks, one is attracted by the 
very substantial appearance of the front end of this spreader,

Height of the spreader. In recent years nearly all manufac- 
turers have turned to the low-down spreader. The top of the 
bed has been lowered 
about one foot, the aver- 
age height now being 
about forty inches. To 
accomplish this result the 
wheels in nearly all cases 
have been lowered. In 
many types, in order to 
avoid making the front

is much to be preferred to pine, which is used for the bed rails 
in some cheap spreaders. All gears should be of malleable iron 
or of steel and should be 
thoroughly protected from

freely and frequently. A 
little attention to this 
simple detail will well re-

LIME-SPREADERS 
Lime in its various forms is now so widely used in correcting 
soil acidity that some special machine to secure its proper ap- 
plication to the land is almost a necessity. In a small way the 
manure-spreader is used for this purpose, but with it the work 
  Fic. 334. A type of feed common in lime-spreaders 
is slow and, especially with hydrated lime, rather unsatisfactory. 
Some have attempted to use the grain-drill for applying lime, 
but the range of quantity per acre is not great enough in drills 
to permit the application of lime in sufficient quantity without 
going over the land two or more times. The lime-spreader, then, 
becomes a necessity. 
The lime-spreader distributes the lime broadcast and on top of 
the ground. It must be provided with an unusually strong feeding- 
mechanism, since the spreading of raw-ground limestone rock is 
not easily accomplished. One feeding-device is shown in Fig. 334. 
The winged wheels are located just above holes in the bottom of the 
hopper and are really nothing more than agitators. In supplying 
raw-ground rock there is a tendency for it to bridge over, especially

if it is a little damp. In Fig. 335 is shown a type of feed which,

The quantity per acre is regulated by simply controlling the 
size of the openings in the bottom of the hopper. The range 
usually runs from three hundred pounds to as much as four tons 
of raw rock. The lime-spreader may be used for sowing fertilizer 
broadcast on the surface of the ground if the quantity which it is 
desired to sow is not too small and if the fertilizer is dry and fine.

CHAPTER XXII 
HAYING MACHINERY 
Few crops grown on the farm can be as completely handled by 
machinery as the hay crop. While the investment necessary to 
provide a more or less complete equipment may seem large, the 
investment pays for itself not only through a saving in labor but 
through value added to the crop by promptness in making and 
saving it. 
Mowers 
The mowing-machine is too frequently regarded as a simple 
tool requiring little care and less adjustment. As a consequence 
it is much abused, and often comparatively good machines are 
thrown away as worthless when a little adjustment and repair 
would prolong their usefulness for many years. Fig. 337 shows a 
plan view of a mower which illustrates several features to which 
attention will be called. 
The frame. It will be noticed that the frame proper is of one 
piece of cast iron. Cores are inserted in the mold to provide 
bearings for the main axle and for the countershaft. It is a 
cast-iron casting and therefore much cheaper than if made of 
steel; at the same time it is sufficiently strong to withstand all 
ordinary strains. 
The bearings. In the great majority of mowers the main axle 
is provided with roller bearings as shown (Fig. 337, D). The 
secondary shaft may or may not have roller bearings. The bear- 
ings of this shaft are important, since they are subjected to a great 
deal of wear and strain. The best construction has two bearings 
with the gears in between or with one gear between the bearings 
and one outside. This shaft is frequently provided with a device 
for taking up the wear between the beveled gears. One device is 
shown in Fig. 340, A. This is a very commendable feature and 
354 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  
HAYING MACHINERY 355 
should be found on a great many more machines. The counter- 
shaft leading to the pitman wheel is nearly always provided with 
solid bearings. The bearing next to the pitman wheel could not 
well be a roller bearing, since the reciprocating motion of the 
pitman would soon wear the rollers out of round. These solid 
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
              
    bearings are removable in all cases and so may be replaced when 
worn, They are made of bronze or of Babbitt metal — more com- 
monly of bronze. Unfortunately it is so difficult to remove these 
bearings when they become worn that, although they are said to

be replaceable, new ones are seldom put in. There are a few 
exceptions to this rule, however, as some mowers provide easily 
removable bearings. 
The ztman rod connects the countershaft to the knife. One 
end of the pitman is connected to the crank pin of the pitman 
wheel by a replaceable bearing, usually of bronze. It is very im- 
portant that this bearing should be replaced when it becomes 
worn, for a little wear at this point causes undue strain upon other 
parts of the machine. The other end of the pitman rod is fastened 
to the knife head, usually by some form of ball-and-socket joint. 
It is needless to say that this joint must be kept tight.
-P-A-G-E-368
  356 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
In several mowers a ball bearing is provided just back of the 
beveled gear on the countershaft, as shown in Fig. 338, B. This 
is to take the end thrust, which would cause a great deal of 
unnecessary friction on a 
plain friction bearing.

wheel zie mower is just the reverse 
of the gasoline engine from the point of view of the transmission 
of the initial force to the point where the work is done. The 
engine converts the rectilinear motion of the piston into the cur- 
vilinear motion of the belt wheel. The mower converts the 
curvilinear motion of the ground wheels into the rectilinear 
motion of the knife. Either type of conversion calls for a more 
or less complex construction. 
Transmission by gears alone is illustrated in Figs. 339, 340, 
and 341. Fig. 339 shows the most common method of arrang- 
ing these gears. The large gear is keyed to the main axle, and 
meshes with the small 
spur gear on the secondary 
shaft. The large beveled 
gear on this shaft in turn 
meshes with the beveled 
pinion on the counter- 
shaft. 
Fig. 340 shows another 
method of arranging these 
gears. The large gear at- 
tached to the main axle is 
called an internal gear, Fic. 339. External and beveled gears

action of the beveled 
gears, which tend to force 
the secondary shaft out- 
ward. 
Fig. 341 shows the 
gear device used by one 
manufacturer in which 
a circular gear-case, or 
bell gear, is substituted 
for the secondary shaft 
in the other types men- 
tioned. 
In the cases shown, 
two steps are taken to 
multiply the motion.

another pair of gears 
and thus take three 
steps to multiply the

have a third pair of 
gears so arranged as 
to make it possible 
to give two different 
speeds to the knife. 
This is some advan- 
tage in cutting thin 
grass, wheat stubble, 
etc., as such mowing 
does not require the Fic. 341. Beveled and bell gears

in a gear. It is difficult, however, to keep the chain tight enough 
to prevent lost motion and still not give rise to undue friction. 
The cutter bar and the knife. Fig. 337 shows the relation of 
the parts of the cutter bar and the knife. The guards are placed 
three inches apart, and the knife has a travel of three inches each 
way. The sections of the knife 
when the pitman wheel is on 
the outer center are found 
» exactly centered in certain 
guards. As the pitman moves 
to the opposite center, the sec- 
tions move to the next adjoin- 
ing guards, where they should

essential, since in this position the motion of the knife is zero, 
and it should not be possible for it to cut anything. As the 
pitman-wheel crank moves up to a position 90° in advance of 
center, the motion is fastest, and the knife should be cutting 
the most grass. From this point motion decreases and is zero 
  Fic. 343. Sections of cutter bars 
Two types of wearing-plates, 4, A, are shown 
again at the other center. Knives may be thrown out of regis- 
ter by a strained bar, by loose joints between bar and frame, by 
misadjustment of the bar, etc. 
It is not often that the knife fails to register properly except 
in very old machines. Nearly all mowers, however, provide some 
means for adjustment should it be found necessary. The bar 
(Fig. 337, QO), sometimes called the hinge bar, just in front of
-P-A-G-E-371
  
HAYING MACHINERY 359 
or to the rear of the pitman rod, is usually threaded at its outer 
end and provided with a nut by means of which the inner shoe 
and the yoke in which the bar is hung may be drawn in or forced 
out as occasion requires. 
The knife rests on wearing-plates, as shown in Fig. 343, A. 
It is essential that the rear part of the knife should be kept at 
the proper level with respect to the ledger plates. Should the 
rear part of the knife drop 
a little too low, the sections 
would not fit squarely on the 
ledger plates. The wearing- 
plates may be replaced when 
they become worn. 
The ledger plate (Fig. 344) 
is that part of the guard 
against which the knife cuts 
the grass—the other blade 
of the shears, so to speak. 
The edges of the ledger plate 
are serrated that they may 
better grasp and hold the 
grass. It is essential that a 
close shearing action be main- 
tained between the sections 
and the ledger plates. The 
knife clips, shown on top of 
the knife in Fig. 337, 2, Fic. 344. A mower guard with its ledger 
should at all times force the Plate removed 
sections down snugly on these 
plates. If the clips become worn, as soon happens, they may easily 
be bent: downward by striking them a sharp blow, repeating the 
action, if necessary, until the proper fit is secured. The clips are 
for this reason made of malleable iron. They should not be 
pounded down so close as to cause the knife to bind, and ‘the 
upper part of the guard should never be pounded down in an 
effort to force the sections close down on the plates. 
The guards should be kept in a true line at all times. If they 
become slightly bent in any direction, they may be hammered   
  
      
‘The edges of the ledger plate are serrated

back into place, since they are made of malleable iron. If they 
are out of alignment, the proper cutting action is interfered with 
and the knife is under a strain. 
It will be noticed from Fig. 337 that the knife, the cutter bar, 
and the pitman are all in perfect alignment and must be kept so 
if free and easy motion of the knife is maintained. The cutter 
bar frequently becomes strained when stumps, posts, etc. are en- 
countered and falls back of the true line. Long wear will often 
cause the outer end to lag behind and thus cause undue strain on 
all wearing-parts. It is necessary, therefore, that there should be 
_, some device for aligning the cut- 
s ter bar. One method, found on a 
well-known mower, is shown in 
Fig. 337, C. An eccentric bush- 
ing surrounds the rear shoe pin. 
By applying a wrench to this 
bushing the outer end of the cut- 
Fic. 345. Method of removing sec- ter bar may be moved through a 
Sons tronya keaife distance of several inches. Other 
machines have different methods for accomplishing the same 
thing, but a few have no such provision. 
The knife should be frequently ground, and when the ends of 
the sections become rounded by wear, new sections should be put 
on. This is a simple task which anyone can accomplish. Fig. 345 
shows how to remove sections from a knife. Care should be taken 
not to bend the knife bar any more than necessary, as it is diffi- 
cult to get it perfectly straight again. It is well, too, to keep a 
file in the mower box so as to touch up the sections if they be- 
come nicked or bent. Care in this regard will save the gears, the 
most expensive part of the machine. 
The levers for raising the cutter bar should be easily manipu- 
lated. The foot lever (the kind on which the weight is thrown 
downward rather than forward seems best) should raise the bar 
high enough for turning. Some levers will bring the bar to a 
vertical position —a thing to be desired if one is cutting in new 
ground where stumps and trees are frequent. Otherwise it is of 
no great advantage. The tilting-lever for throwing the guards up 
and down at the inner and outer shoes will make it possible to Strike a heavy blow here —;

cut high or low. Now that it has become a general custom in 
many parts of the country to clip wheat stubble in the fall of the 
year, it is desirable that the above adjustment should have enough 
range to allow the stubble to be cut at least four inches high. 
Lost motion in the mower. Lost motion 
in a mower is evident if the knife fails 
to start as soon as the main wheels begin 
to revolve. This permits the mower to 
| @ be drawn into the grass before the knife 
\ Lap i starts, and choking down is the result. 
Lost motion may occur in several places : 
: (1) Ln the hub of the wheel. Loss of 
é motion here is due to the fact that the 
pawls do not engage the ratchets all the 
time. Fig. 346 shows a pawl hub with 
three pawls. It will be seen that only one pawl is in engagement 
at a time. This is as it should be; but it is possible to turn the 
wheels a considerable distance at times before any one of the 
pawls will engage; four pawls would therefore be better than 
three. (2) Ju the de- ss 
vice for throwing the 
machine into gear. 
It is often the case 
that the wheels will 
turn one quarter of 
the way around before 
the gear clutch will 
engage. Of course 
the clutch should be 
thrown in before cut- Y

(3) Ln the gears for 
transmitting motion. 
There is very little lost motion of this sort in a new machine ; 
but in time the teeth become worn, and unless there is some 
way of taking up this wear, unusual strain will be thrown upon 
all wearing-parts. As before mentioned, the secondary shaft may 
be provided with a device for taking up wear between the beveled A, hinge bar; B, draw bar; C, push bar

point is usually taken up by providing a new bushing. (5) At the 
knife-head end of the pitman rod. These parts should be kept 
tight at all times. 
Draw-bar and push-bar cut. Mowers were formerly nearly all 
of the push-bar type; that is, the cutter bar was pushed by the 
frame connections, and no force was applied directly to and in 
front of the cutter bar. The draw-bar cut was just the opposite — 
a rod connected the doubletree hitch and the inner shoe of the 
  
  Fic. 348. A draw-bar-cut mower 
The draw-bar is shown at 4 
cutter bar, so that the bar was drawn rather than pushed. Nearly 
all mowing-machines are now combinations of the two types. 
Both draw bar and push bar are shown in Fig. 347. 
Size of mower. This is determined chiefly by the width of the 
cut, although the size of the truck may vary for the same width 
of cut. Formerly the 5-foot cut was the standard, with the 4-foot 
cut common. Now there are many 6-foot and 7-foot cuts and a 
few 8-foot cuts. It is doubtful whether it is advisable for the cut 
to be wider than 7 ft., as the side draft and the general strain on 
the whole machine are very much increased. A wide truck should 
always accompany a wide cut.

engage the tooth-bar with the wheels of the rake, thus causing the 
teeth to be lifted by the team. The advent of the loader, how- 
ever, since it makes necessary a long windrow, created a demand 
for another type of 
rake — one that would 
make such a windrow 
possible. To meet 
this demand the side- 
delivery rake was pro- 
duced. There are two 
types of side-delivery 
rakes upon the market, 
one known as the re- 
volving-cylinder rake, Fic. 350. A revolving-cylinder side-delivery rake 
the other known as_ As the rake is drawn forward the hay is gathered into a 
ie tedden ee windrow and thrown to the left 
The revolving-cylinder rake is shown in Fig. 350, The con- 
struction of this rake is very simple. The revolving cylinder 
consists of three rake bars carried at an angle to the direction of 
travel of the team. The cylinder is long enough to cover two 
     
-P-A-G-E-376
  364, EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
swaths, and the hay, which is rolled to one side as the rake is 
drawn forward, is thrown up into a loose windrow. The cylinder 
may be raised or lowered so that the teeth of the bars may run 
the proper distance from the ground. They should be set so as 
just to brush the ground and not dig into it. Two swaths usually 
make a sufficiently large windrow for a loader, but if the hay is 
thin, four or even six swaths may be thrown together. The way 
in which this rake handles the hay is a material help in curing 
it, and the use of the tedder is less necessary. The objection is 
frequently raised that this rake rolls the hay, making it difficult 
to handle in loading when a loader is used. In very long timothy 
hay this is noticeable, 
perhaps, but for aver- 
age hay it is not a 
serious objection. 
This type of rake 
is very useful in clear- 
ing trash from ground 
which is to be seeded; 
Fic. 351. A tedder side-delivery rake for instance, in clear- 
ing potato vines and 
weeds from a potato field after the potatoes are dug. The wind- 
rows are tumbled over until they are sufficiently large, when 
they may be burned or hauled off. 
The tedder rake is shown in Fig. 351. This type kicks rather 
than rolls the hay, and probably handles it more roughly than the 
cylinder rake. In some makes this rake can be reversed and 
used as a tedder. 
In the opinion of many users the side-delivery rake is to be 
preferred to the dump rake whether or not a loader is used, the 
chief advantage being that it forms a continuous windrow of any 
desired size and that it rakes cleaner perhaps than the dump rake. 
  TEDDERS 
The all-steel hay-tedder, in which the fork shaft is run by 
sprockets and chains or by gears, is now the most popular type. 
Fig. 352 shows a common style. In this type the fork shaft is
-P-A-G-E-377
  
HAVING MACHINERY 365 
driven from the middle and the shaft is in one piece. In some 
makes the shaft is in two pieces and driven from the ends. The 
latter type throws less strain on the driving mechanism. In 
nearly all the modern 
tedders one fork is 
carried outside the 
wheels, so that the 
newly tedded hay will 
not be run over on 
the succeeding round. 
It is essential that 
the tedder forks be 
provided with substan- 
tial springs that will 
permit of considerable 
freedom of movement 
should an obstruction be encountered; and yet they must be 
strong enough not to let the forks yield in handling a heavy 
bunch of hay. The coiled spring shown in the figure is perhaps 
one of the best types. 
Fig. 353 shows an 
older type of tedder, 
but one that has given 
satisfaction, The fork 
shaft, which is in two 
pieces, is driven from 
the ends by gears 
alone. The fork bars 
are of wood. 
The tedder is sub- 
jected to much vibra- 
tion; it is therefore 
essential that all nuts Fic. 353. A wooden-wheel wooden-bar tedder

strain. Oil is cheaper than new bearings or a new shaft.

LoapeErs 
The loader has come to be regarded as a necessity on farms 
where hay is one of the principal crops, not only because it is a 
labor-saver, but because the same work can be more easily accom- 
lished with less labor and in less time than could possibly be 
he case if hand methods were followed. There are two general 
types of loaders commonly 
used, the fork (or rake-bar) 
loader, and the cylinder (or 
carrier) loader. 
The fork loader. Fig. 354 
shows a typical fork loader. 
The forks work close to the 
ground and are carried back 
and forth through a travel of 
several inches by the crank 
motion shown. Several dif- 
ferent devices are used for 
giving the forks this vibrating 
motion, but they all accom- 
plish the same purpose. The 
hay is forced up the elevator 
by a series of shoves, each up- 
ward movement of the bars 
pushing it up a few inches. 
The hay is thus handled rather roughly, and there is a tendency 
to shatter the leaves, particularly of clover, if very dry. 
This loader is wide enough to cover two swaths, and it takes 
hay from the swath well; in fact, it is sometimes called a swath 
loader. It will load from the windrow, however, if the hay is not 
too thick. If there is much trash on the ground, the forks have 
a tendency to pick it up with the hay. The elevator is usually 
narrowed at the top so that the hay is not dropped on the edges 
of the load. 
The cylinder loader. Fig. 356 shows the simplest type of 
cylinder loader. The cylinder is made up of eight bars, each carry- 
ing several teeth, as shown in the figure. These bars, which

substantial support

HAYING MACHINERY = i 367 
are made to turn in their end supports, are guided in such a 
way that the teeth project downward when they are nearest the 
ground and while in this position pick up the hay. As the 
loader moves forward and the cylinder revolves, the teeth are 
turned upward, so that they grasp the hay firmly until the bars 
reach the top of the cylinder. Here they are permitted to turn 
backward, thus releasing the hay, which is deposited upon the 
carrier and elevated 
to the wagon. The 
slatted carrier, or web, 
as the figure shows, 
surrounds the cylinder. 
A separate view of 
a single cylinder is 
shown in Fig. 357, 
in which the position 
of the teeth on the 
various bars is more 
clearly shown. Al- 
though this type of 
loader will take hay 
up from the swath if 
the hay is not too 
thin on the ground, it 
is essentially a wind- 
row loader. It is not 
wide enough to cover 
two swaths. 
Figs. 358 and 359 show a ¢wo-cylinder loader. This is virtu- 
ally the same as the single-cylinder type, with an additional 
cylinder carried behind which revolves in a direction opposite to 
that of the front one. This loader is made wide enough to cover 
two swaths and will take hay from the swath in a satisfactory 
manner. The rear cylinder adds a great deal to the complexity 
of the loader, since it requires additional support and since the 
drive chains or the gears must reverse its motion. It also adds 
materially to the draft. The gathering-boards on either side of 
the carrier guide the hay to the center of the wagon.

Fig. 360 shows a loader with a jointed elevator, the joints allow- 
ing the carrier to be straightened as the load becomes higher. 
This possesses two ad- 
vantages. It is possible 
to deliver the hay farther 
to the front during the 
greater part of the load- 
ing process, and at the 
same time the hay does 
not have so far to fall. 
This is some  advan- 
tage, particularly in windy 
weather. 
The essential advan- 
tages and disadvantages 
of the loaders mentioned 
may be enumerated as

so complex as the double-cylinder type. While it handles the hay 
roughly, it is easier to load 
after than the cylinder 
type, because if the hay 
piles up in front of the 
elevator, the fork loader 
continues to push it for- 
ward and does not drag it 
back off the load as the 
cylinder loader does. The 
fork loader may be used 
to take hay from either 
swath or windrow. The 
single-cylinder type is a 
windrow loader, but is 
without doubt the lightest- Fic. 357. Details of a cylinder

It handles the hay without shattering the leaves and does not pick 
up trash so readily as does the fork loader. In a windrow loader 
there seems to be little 
need of the second 
cylinder. 
The argument is 
offered that a swath 
loader is the most eco- 
nomical, since, if it is 
used, it is not neces- 
sary to rake the hay. 
This may be true 
from the standpoint of 
economy of time, but 
it would seem that a

in the windrow rather than if it were left to lie in the swath until 
completely cured. In the latter case, of course, the top of the 
swaths is likely to be 
burned and the quality 
very much impaired. 
The method of at- 
taching the loader to 
the wagon is impor- 
tant and the work 
should be easily ac- 
complished. Loaders 
with four wheels afford 
the best connection to 
the wagon and do not 
throw extra weight on 
the rack. It should 
be possible to discon- 
nect the loader without Fic. 359. Front view of a two-cylinder loader

' In working after the loader some operators prefer to keep the 
load level from the start. Others load the rear half up to a 
level with the loader and 
then load the front end. 
There is a new type of 
loader on the market which 
is provided with a carrier 
that rests in a horizontal 
position and that may be 
stretched out to the front 
end of the rack and then 
automatically drawn to the 
rear, the hay being dis-

Still another handy loading-device provides a car extending halt 
the length of the rack and

drawn to the rear end, and 
one half the load built upon 
it. By a windlass and rope 
attached to the front standard 
the car is then drawn to the

load put on. It is doubtful 
whether such a device accom- 
plishes much as a time-saver.

inside of the barn. The track is suspended from the peak to the 
rafters and should be as close to the top as possible. There is a 
variety of tracks and cars. The former may be a wood track, bu 
more commonly it is made of angle steel. The car should be of 
the swivel type so that it may be quickly changed from end to 
end of the barn without the necessity of unthreading. Figs. 362 
anid\3 63 Show. Some Ofethe mq es a 
common tracks and cars. 
Fig. 364 shows the 
forks commonly — used. 
The double harpoon fork 
is in highest favor and is 
especially good in short, 
dry hay. The szzgle har- 
poon fork is more easily 
handled, however, and 
works very well if the hay 
is not too dry and too 
short. The grapple hook 
(Fig. 365) is especially 
useful in unloading straw 
or sheaf grain. 
Slings are very much 
in favor in many parts of 
the country. Fig. 366 
shows a good style—a Fic. 362. A nonreversible carrier 
sling that opens at the To change the fork from one end of the barn to the 
other, the rope is drawn through the carrier   
      
middle. The argument 
for the slings is that the load is taken up without any of the 
difficulties encountered in the use of the fork, such as the scatter- 
ing of hay on both sides or the failure to clean up at the finish. 
In actual operation slings are used as follows: They are taken to 
the field, where one is put on the bottom of the wagon. When 
about one fourth of the load is put on, another sling is spread 
out, and this process is repeated until about four slings to the 
load are used. At the barn the ends of the slings are hooked 
into pulleys of a special car and drawn up. The sling is then 
tripped at the middle.  
-P-A-G-E-384
  B72 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
There is some inconvenience in getting the slings to the field. 
One way is to hang them on the front and rear standards, 
If a loader is used, the slings should all be hung on the front 
standard in such a manner that each may be easily and quickly 
spread over the load when needed ; this is probably the best man- 
ner in which to handle them. Another way is to carry the slings 
on a cart or sled hitched 
to the wagon. Where hay 
is taken in from the end 
of the barn a somewhat 
larger door is required to 
admit a sling load than 
to admit a fork load; 
further, it is quite difficult 
to finish a mow with slings, 
since they hang low and 
are very much in the way. 
It is customary, therefore, 
in some localities to take 
off the slings and use a 
fork in finishing a mow. 
A great many farmers use 
one sling on the bottom 
and take off the top of the 
load with a fork. This as- 
sures the cleaning up of the 
wagon on the last load and, 
except for the slight incon- 
venience of changing from 
  Fic. 363. A reversible carrier 
To change the fork to the opposite end of the barn & 
the lower part of the carrier is turned on a swivel fork to sling, is a very 
satisfactory arrangement. 
In some localities instead of using slings two harpoon forks 
are attached to the rope and carrier. One of these forks is 
set at the front end of the load, the other at the rear end. In 
this way a complete layer of hay is taken up from the wagon, and 
the trouble arising from the hay’s hanging together and falling 
back before the load has reached the mow (an incident of frequent 
occurrence where a single fork is used) is avoided.

  Fic. 364. A single and a double

shown for returning the car by 
means of weights. Fig. 368 
shows a combination of two 
sizes of rope. In this device 
the large rope, usually three 
quarters of an inch or one inch 
in diameter, is used to draw 
the load up to the car. At this 
point the end of the smaller 
rope, a half inch in diameter, is 
hitched to the doubletree, and 
the car is drawn to the end 
of the track by it. In some 
cases the team is turned at the 
end of the smaller rope, which 
is passed around a pulley at 
the point shown, so that the car is drawn to the end of the track 
on the return trip. This 
materially lessens the dis- 
tance the team must travel, 
especially where the barn 
is long. 
Various kinds of hay- 
hoists are used in connec- 
tion with barn tools which, 
since they are operated by 
gasoline engines, effect a 
saving of time and horse 
power. Fig. 369 shows a 
cleverly arranged outfit. 
The man on the load has 
complete control of the 
hoist, and no time need 
be lost in taking the load 
off. Fig. 370 shows a 
similar device.

STACKING-TOOLS 
One very common method used in stacking is to cock the 
hay and then to haul the cocks to the stack. Figs. 371 and 372 
show the most common devices used for hauling the cocks. One 
advantage which the pole has over the rope is that cocks can be 
hauled as soon as put up, while with the ropes they must have 
settled. The rope must be tucked under the cock on both sides 
at the front, to prevent turning over, and must be left untucked 
  
  Fic. 369. A hay-hoist operated by a gasoline engine 
The operator controls the hoist by the ropes running to the wagon. By shifting levers the 
load may be drawn up and the car returned to the end of the track 
at the rear to prevent the rope from pulling under. After the 
rope has been tucked the foot should be placed on the rope at 
the rear of the cock in order to hold the rope close to the 
ground until the horse has started the cock. This prevents the 
rope from tipping the cock over and also causes the hay to be 
taken up better than if the rope were not so held. It is best to 
tie the rope in the hame ring. If a hook is put on the rope, it 
is invariably troublesome in unhitching from the cock at the stack. 
There should not be even a knot in the rope. This method of

At least a 4-horse-power engine is required to run 
such a hoist and one boy to tuck ropes 
are generally required to 
keep the work going rapidly. 
Such a force can put from 
15 to 18 tons of hay into 
stacks in a half day. When 
the stacks reach such a 
height as to make pitching 
from the ground difficult, 
a wagon may be run along- 
side the stack and the 
hay pitched first upon the 
wagon and then from there 
to the stack. The stacks 
should always be allowed 
to settle before they are finally topped out. Where the fields are 
close to the barn, the 
cocks may be hauled to 
the barn by means of 
ropes and taken up with 
the fork or with slings. 
Several tools are avail- 
able for drawing the hay 
up to and placing it upon 
the stack. Figs. 373 and 
374 illustrate one such 
outfit. Figs. 375, 376,

The simpler de-

shown in Figs. 375, 
376, 377, and 378 
commend themselves 
to the small farmer 
who has, say, 30 or 
40 tons of hay to 
stack each year. The 
outfits shown in 
Figs. 375 and 378 are 
in common use and 
seem to give entire 
satisfaction. In the 
former a special car 
carried on a_ wire 
cable is necessary, 
while in the latter 
the rope, pulleys, and 
fork required are the 
same as those used 
in the barn. 
In stacking hay it 
is a much better plan 
to make a few large 
ticks than several 
small stacks. The 
essential thing to hold constantly in mind when building a rick 
is to keep the middle full and well tramped. The edges of a 
stack should be tramped but little if at all, The hay should be

HAYING MACHINERY 379 
pitched from both sides 
if possible. If all the 
pitching is from one 
side, the stack is much 
more solid on that side, 
and in settling it will 
invariably lean toward 
the opposite side. The 
sides should be raked 
down with a hand 
rake to put them in 
better condition to shed 
water.

CHAPTER XXIII 
GRAIN-BINDERS 
The evolution of wheat-harvesting machinery which has taken 
place within the past sixty years forms one of the most interest- 
ing phases of modern industrial development. Within the memory 
of men still living, the cradle, and even the sickle, has been re- 
placed by the modern four-horse eight-foot-cut grain-binder now 
used in almost every country in the world where wheat is grown. 
This short chapter, since it cannot take up in all its detail the 
construction and oper- 
ation of the binder, 
will discuss what are 
deemed its more im- 
portant features. 
The master wheel. 
Naturally the entire 
machine is built up 
around the main wheel. 
In addition to furnish- 
Iie 80) MR olsrandlipellitieerings'aaroundiinthen Mesh coe oe ticles il aia all moving parts this 
wheel must carry the 
weight of the binder, which totals about fifteen hundred pounds. 
The necessity for strength is therefore evident. It must be wide 
and have strong heavy climbers to insure traction under all con- 
ditions. Its bearings, as shown in Fig. 380, are always of the 
roller type, with ball bearings at each end to take the end thrust. 
A convenient method should be provided for oiling these bear- 
ings. Too frequently it is made very difficult for the operator to 
attend to this important duty. The device provided for raising 
and lowering the machine on the main wheel should be amply 
strong and easily operated.

The secondary shaft. The secondary shaft, shown in Fig. 381, 
is just to the rear of the master wheel and operated by it through 
sprockets and chain. This shaft is carried on two long roller 
bearings, as shown. The coiled spring holds in place the clutch 
used to throw the ma- 
chine in and out of 
gear. At the left end 
of the shaft is shown 
a large nut by means

up and a close mesh 
assured. An enlarged view of the end of the shaft is shown 
in Fig. 382. A similar device should be found on all binders. 
The drive chain. The drive chain may be made of malleable- 
tron links or of steel links. The former are most in favor 
since they do not wear the sprockets so fast and are more easily 
put together. There are two styles of links, the ook link and 
the giv link. The hook link should be put on with hooks up, 
and to the front. This style of link is the one most commonly 
used for the main 
chain as well as for 
the elevator chain. In 
removing this kind of 
link from a chain, how- 
ever, it is necessary 
to bend two of the 
links back on each 
other in order to slip 
them together. In 
putting on the main 
drive chain it fre- 
quently becomes impossible, therefore, to get the chain as tight 
as desired. The pin link, shown in Fig. 383, is not open to this 
objection. Some hook-link chains are provided with two pin 
links to overcome the above objection,

It will be seen from the figure that oil-holes are provided in 
the pin links. In sandy soil it is not advisable to use either oil 
or grease on the main chain, since the grit will cut out both chain 
and sprockets more quickly than friction from lack of oil. If 
sand is not troublesome, axle-grease may be used. 
The countershaft. As shown in Fig. 381, the countershaft is 
driven by beveled gears from the secondary shaft. On the rear 
end of this shaft is a sprocket that runs the rear elevator chain, 
and on the front end is the pitman wheel and crank which runs 
the knife. Thus it is from the countershaft that motion for all 
parts of the binder is 
taken. The countershaft 
is usually provided with a 
roller bearing at the rear, 
as shown, but with a solid 
bearing in front. 
The cutting mechan- 
ism. The construction of 
the cutter bar, the knife, 
and the pitman is essen- 
tially the same as that of similar parts in the mower and differs 
only in some minor details. The travel of the knife is twice as 
great as in the mower and covers two guards at each movement. 
The guards are smaller, since they do not run close to the ground 
and hence do not encounter obstacles, as the mower guards do. 
The knife is made up of sickles rather than of plain sections, 
since dry grain is more easily cut by a serrated knife edge. 
The wearing-plates and the ledger plates are essentially the same. 
The cutting-mechanism is not put to so severe a strain as that 
of the mower; hence no device is found for aligning the cutter 
bar and none for bringing the knives to register. The knife 
will frequently last for several years, and the guards seldom 
need adjustment. 
The reel. It is the function of the reel to deliver the grain in 
proper shape to the platform after the knife has cut it off. It 
begins its work before the grain is cut. 
The reel may be driven by any one of the following devices : 
(1) by sprockets and chains, (2) by beveled gears and shafts, (3) by 
    Fic. 383. A main drive chain

knuckle joints. The chain drive (Fig. 384) seems to permit the 
greatest amount of lost motion in the reel. The beveled gear 
and shaft seem to give the least opportunity for lost motion or 
play. In nearly all cases the power for driving the reel is taken 
from the upper roller of the lower elevator, which, in turn, is 
driven by the elevator chain. At least one binder provides a 
special shaft for driving the reel, taking its motion from the 
  
  Fic. 384. A reel driven by sprockets and chains 
The power is taken from the elevator rollers 
secondary shaft and running to the front of the machine near 
the base of the elevators. 
The levers provided for the control of the reel should permit 
of a wide range in adjustment, both as to height and as to posi- 
tion forward, the latter adjustment being especially useful in 
lodged grain. -It should be possible to bring the reel down to 
within about four inches of the guards but no lower. After a 
time the outer end of the reel is likely to sag and catch the guards 
if the reel is dropped to the lowest point of adjustment. There 
should be some means available for keeping the reel level at all 
times, as by the small diagonal rod running to the top of the reel

bar shown in Fig. 385. In the wider cuts the outer end of the 
reel is provided with a special support, as shown in Fig. 389. 
In grain that stands up straight the reel fans should strike the 
grain about six inches below the heads, just as the knife is cut- 
ting it off. If the reel is run too low, the grain will be thrown 
back too far on the platform, and a poor bundle will result. 
In grain that is leaning from the machine the reel should be 
well forward and low. A multitude of conditions must be met, 
and the making of poor bundles may frequently be traced to poor 
  
See ; i SSS 
  Fic. 385. A reel driven by gears alone 
The diagonal rod is for the purpose of keeping the reel level 
reel-adjustment. The most common fault is that of working the 
reel too low and too far to the rear. 
The platform. The platform with its canvas receives the grain 
and carries it to the elevators. It is securely bolted to the main 
frame at the inner end, while the outer end is carried on the 
grain-wheel. This wheel must be rigidly supported and must run 
true or it will knock down the standing grain. The underside 
of the platform is covered with sheet iron, which must be heavy 
enough not to bend or it will interfere with the operation of the 
platform canvas. The outer grain-divider is frequently made to 
fold up, for convenience in passing through narrow gates or in 
storing. The same is true of the inner grain-divider. 
 
-P-A-G-E-397
  GRAIN-BINDERS 385 
The platform canvas is driven by the inner roller, this roller 
receiving its motion from the elevator chain. There should always 
be some device for tightening the canvas. This device is usually 
found in connection with the outer roller, as shown in Fig. 386. 
It is difficult, by means of buckles alone, to draw the canvas tight 
enough to prevent slippage. If there is a tightener, it should be 
loosened and the canvas buckled; then the tightener may be 
adjusted to secure the proper tension. Moreover the dew and 
damp weather will shrink the canvas and sometimes break the 
straps if the tightener is not released. 
There is often furnished with the machine a piece of strap iron 
which fastens to the outer grain-divider and lies loosely on the 
canvas, extending the full 
length of the platform, as 
shown in Fig. 385. It is 
placed on the platform where 
the heads of the grain fall, 
the purpose being, especially 
in short grain, to retard the 
heads, which being heavier 
than the straw cling more 
closely to the canvas, and so 
tend to make the grain go lengthwise into the elevator canvas. 
By means of the tilting-lever the platform may be tilted for- 
ward and the guards made to run closer to the ground. This is 
for adjustment, to suit short grain or to take up lodged grain 
better. The platform should always be tilted slightly forward, 
since it seems to take the grain better in this position than when 
run perfectly level. The wind-shield on the rear platform is 
not essential, but is helpful if the wind is blowing in the direc- 
tion of travel, in which case the proper handling of the grain is 
interfered with. 
The elevator. The elevator is made up of the upper and 
the lower elevator canvases, with the necessary framework and 
rollers. Obviously its function is to elevate the grain and deliver 
it upon the deck. The lower canvas is driven from its upper 
roller, which, in turn, drives the upper roller of the upper canvas, 
the motion being transmitted and reversed by means of spur gears

platform canvas

at the front end of the rollers. One company provides an extra- 
large lower roller for the upper elevator, the claim being made that 
it permits more spread between the upper and the lower canvases, 
so that clogging will not 
be so likely to occur. 
Frequently the elevator 
canvases begin to creep ; 
that is, one end runs ahead 
of the other and the slats 
do not run parallel with the 
rollers. The slats in such 
cases often become broken 
and then the proper de-

for tightening the canvas If this happens the eleva- 
tor frames are not square. To ascertain whether the frames are 
square, the diagonals of each frame should be measured; they 
should of course be equal if the frames are square. In most 
cases there is a device for shifting the upper portion of the frame- 
work forward or backward far enough to make the diagonals 
equal. The diagonal-rod shown in Fig. 387, A, is for squaring the 
upper elevator. Canvas- 
tighteners should be 
provided, as on the 
platform canvas. A 
canvas-tightener for 
the platform canvas is 
shown in Fig. 386 
‘and one for the upper 
elevator canvas in 
Fig. 387, B. 
The seventh roller ~ 
operates between the Fic. 388. A steel-belt butt-adjuster 
upper roller of the 
lower elevator and the deck. Its function is to carry the grain 
over to the deck and to assist in passing the grain on to the 
packers. 
     
-P-A-G-E-399
  
GRAIN-BINDERS 387 
The deck. As the grain is delivered from the elevator it 
must pass down the deck to the packers. A steep deck is a 
decided advantage, since clogging will be less likely to occur. 
Decks that are flatter, though, are not so high and so reduce the 
amount of work necessary to elevate the grain; this, however, is 
insignificant when the actual power required is estimated. 
The dutt-adjuster, or butter, is provided to assist the - grain 
down the deck and to feed it to the packers as evenly arranged 
as possible. There are two forms of butters, the vibrating butter, 
operated by a crank movement from the elevator rollers, and the 
  
    
Fic. 389. A seven-foot-cut binder 
In the wider cuts the outer end of the reel is provided with a special support 
belt butter. The belt butter, shown in Fig. 388, consists of two 
rollers with a canvas or steel belt. A canvas belt is used by some 
manufacturers, but since it must be driven at a high speed, it 
wears out quickly. The vibrating butter, such as that shown on 
the machine in Fig. 385, seems to be the most satisfactory. 
The butter should be run for the most part in a position 
straight down the deck at right angles to the grain. The com- 
mon practice of drawing the butter back if it is desired to bind 
the bundles nearer the butts is wrong and will result in a bundle 
with uneven butts. The binder head should be moved forward 
rather than the butter backward. Only in very short grain is it 
necessary to draw the butter in,  
-P-A-G-E-400
  
  388 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The binder head. After the grain is delivered to the packers 
the binder head does the rest of the work of binding and dis- 
charging the bundle. The 
essential parts of the 
binder head are shown in 
Figs. 390 and 391. These 
include the packers, the 
needle, the knotter, the 
discharge arms, the tier 
shaft —all parts, in fact, 
which have to do with the 
tying of the bundle. The 
binder head may be driven 
in either of two ways: 
(1) from the elevator chain, 
Fic. 390. Portion of a binder head as shown in Fig. 392; or 
The needle, the packers, and the triparm areshown (2) by a separate chain, in heavy black ‘ the power being taken 
from near the front end of the countershaft. The sprockets-and- 
chain connection may be seen in Fig. 390. The latter method is 
really the better, since 
it relieves the elevator 
chain of this extra 
strain. 
Most binders are 
provided with two 
packers. Some, how- 
ever, have three, the 
argument for the third 
being that by virtue 
of its position well to 
the front it assists the 
butter in bringing Fic. 391. View of a binder head

up quite close to the seventh roller, — within four to six inches of 
it, in fact, —so as to reduce the tendency of the deck to clog. 
In at least one make the packers are stopped while the bundle is

GRAIN-BINDERS 389 
being bound, or, more particularly, while the needle is above the 
deck.. This prevents the packing of grain against the needle 
while the needle is 
in the tying posi- 
tion. It will often 
be noticed that 
when a bundle is 
being discharged 
the machine chokes 
just as the needle 
is partially with- 
drawn. This is 
often due to the 
fact that the packers have forced the grain down against the 
needle, binding it tightly as it is disappearing beneath the deck. 
The packers gather the grain from the deck and force it down 
against the ¢77p arm and the dundle-sizer, or compressor, arm. 
These two devices may be in one piece, as shown in Fig. 391, A,

Fig. 391 that the upright arm just beneath the knotter is bolted

ing to the front end of the binder head. By means of short
-P-A-G-E-402
390 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
arms this shaft is con- 
nected to the small coiled 
spring shown just beneath 
the tier-shaft wheel. 
The packers drive the 
grain down against this up- 
right arm, forcing it back 
against the tension of the 
trip spring (Fig. 394, B) 
until finally the dog in the 
clutch at the front of the 
binder head is tripped, this 
action throwing the head 
in motion with the rest of 
the machine. As soon as 
the tier shaft begins to re- 
volve, the needle delivers 
the twine to the knotter ; 
one end already being held 
by the twine disk, the knot 
is tied ; the discharge arms 
kick the bundle off the 
deck ; and, as the tier shaft resumes its original position, the dog 
drops back in place, and the binder head is thrown out of gear. 
It will be seen that the 
tighter the tension of the 
trip spring referred to 
above, the tighter will the 
bundles be bound. Al- 
though many believe that 
tightening the twine ten. 
sion will increase the tight- 
ness of the bundles, this is 
not so. The twine tension Fic. 395. A roller twine tension 
(types of which are shown This type of tension will pass uneven twine without

rapidly, and it should simply be tight enough to keep slack out

of the twine. To make the bundle /azger or smaller the compressor 
arm should be moved out on the bracket as shown in Fig. 391, A, 
and ample provision 
is made for this ad- 
justment. 
If the trip arm and 
the compressor arm 
are not combined, the 
former is connected 
to the small shaft 
(Fig. 394, C) and 
through this to the 
trip spring, while the 
compressor arm is

Fic. 396. A spring twine tension arate bracket. The 
A very satisfactory tension, though it is claimed that it compressor arm is so 
tends to increase the kinking of the ball in the box   
    
called because in most 
inders it is given a slight backward motion against the bundle 
just as the needle is delivering the twine to the knotter; thus 
the bundle is compressed from both sides at the moment of tying. 
This compressor arm, when separate from the trip arm, is pro- 
vided with a compressor spring in order that the packers may 
not be obliged to 
force the grain against 
a rigid arm during 
the process of tying 
the bundle. 
As the needle travels 
forward in the process 
of tying the bundle it 
is preceded by one of 
the packers and so is 
not used in compress- 
ing the grain. This 
helps to prevent the needle from being bent out of its proper 
position. Should it for any reason become. bent out of shape, it 
may be readily bent back again, as it is made of malleable iron.   
  
  Fic. 397. Another type of spring twine tension

The travel of the needle is controlled by the length of the xeed/e 
pitman. This pitman, which is located at the front end of the 
binder head, is adjustable 
for length ; so that if for 
any reason the needle 
should fail to travel far 
enough forward to deliver 
the twine to the cord- 
holder, the proper travel 
may be secured by adjust- 
ing the length. 
The £notter, or knotter 
head, is undoubtedly the 
most delicate and most 
complicated part of the 
grain-binder. As shown 
  Fic. 398. A portion of the tier shaft and the ¢ st nae 
knotter head in Fig. 398, it is made 
up of several parts, which 
must work together in closest harmony. An actual demonstration 
of the tying of a knot on a binder head is essential to a proper 
understanding of the function of the various parts of the knotter. 
When the machine is properly threaded, one end of the twine 
is held by the swine disk (Fig. 399, A). 
As the grain collects above the breast- 
plate in the desired quantity, the 
binder head is set in motion ; and the 
needle, which comes up from beneath 
the deck, carries the twine around the 
bundle, laying it across the bill hook 
and delivering it to the twine disk. 
The bill hook now makes a complete 
revolution, producing a loop in the 
twine, the ends of which are held by 
the twine disk. Just as the bill hook 
completes its revolution it grasps the 
ends of the band, the knife cuts the twine between the bill hook 
and the disk, and the stripper slips the knot off the bill hook, 
the ends just cut off being drawn through the loop about the 
  Fic. 399. The twine disk and 
its driving-gears

GRAIN-BINDERS 303 
bill and finally completing the knot. The twine disk retains one 
end of the twine, and as the needle is withdrawn it lays the 
twine across the bill hook ready for the succeeding knot. 
The knotter illustrated and used in modified forms on nearly 
all binders is known as the Appleby knotter, because it was in- 
vented and patented by John P. Appleby. The Holmes knotter, 
used on a leading make of binder, does not use the familiar bill 
hook. The Holmes knotter ties a bowknot. The criticism is 
sometimes made that it uses more twine than the other knotter, 
which ties a straight knot. This criticism is not true, however, 
for the knotter which ties a straight knot cuts off and throws 
away a short piece of twine for every bundle, while the Holmes 
knotter puts this short piece into the knot. Both knotters use the 
same amount of twine. 
Knotter-head troubles. Troubles with the knotter head make 
up about 90 per cent of all binder troubles. In endeavoring to 
locate and remedy a trouble one should make only one adjust- 
ment at a time, for if two or three different remedies are tried at 
the same time, it is impossible to determine which is the real 
remedy. If after making one adjustment no benefit is derived, 
this adjustment should be brought back to its original position 
before another is attempted. By thus systematically going about 
the work one is almost sure to locate the trouble and so is able 
to apply the proper remedy. 
Some of the more common troubles with the knotter head are 
the following : 
1. Loose twine disk, The twine disk should hold the twine so 
tightly that a pull of about fifty pounds is required to draw it from 
the disk spring. If this spring becomes loosened, two conditions 
may be met with: (a) a band may be found clinging to the bill 
hook with a loose knot in the end, while the free end has the 
appearance of having been cut squarely off. The trouble here is 
that the twine-disk spring was so loose that it released one end 
of the twine but the other end was placed across the bill hook. 
Thus a knot was tied in one end and the twine remains on the 
bill. (4) A band may be found lying with a discharged bundle, 
there being a loose knot in one end of the string and the other 
end being cut squarely off. In this case the twine disk held the 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  
3904 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
twine until the knot was nearly completed, but one end of the 
twine slipped out of the disk just before being made a part of 
the knot, and the other end was tied in a loose knot around this 
freed end. Sometimes the knot will hold until the bundle is 
picked up, and then one end will slip out. The remedy is to 
tighten the twine-disk spring. 
2. Twine disk too tight. (a) If a band with a knot in one 
end and with the other end presenting the appearance of having 
been chewed off is found with a discharged bundle, it is an in- 
dication that the disk is too tight. When the bill hook revolves, 
one end is pulled from the disk and does not enter into the 
completed knot, being similar in this respect to 1 (a). In this 
case, however, the ragged end shows that the disk was so tight 
as almost to hack the twine off. (4) If a band is found with 
both ends presenting the appearance of having been chewed off, 
it is an indication that the disk was so tight that it would not 
allow the twine to slip at all as the bill hook revolved. The result 
was that both ends were pulled out broken from the disk. The 
remedy is to loosen the twine-disk spring. 
3. Bill spring too loose. If there is found with a discharged 
bundle a band having both ends cut squarely off and each end 
bent over as though a knot had been tied, it is an indication 
that the bill spring is too loose. As the bill hook revolved it 
made the loop in perfect order, but after the twine was cut and 
the stripper forced the loop off the bill, the ends, instead of 
being held tightly enough to be drawn through the loop, slipped 
out, and the knot was never completed. The remedy is to 
tighten the bill spring slightly. 
4. Bill spring too tight. It is possible, though it does not 
frequently happen, that the bill spring may be so tight that the 
stripper will not slip the twine off the bill, and the discharge 
arms, in seeking to kick out the bundle; will break the twine, 
leaving the knot on the bill. A rough or rusted bill will cause 
the same trouble. Not infrequently the bill becomes worn in a 
groove where the twine crosses it, giving rise to a similar trouble. 
5. Twine tension too tight. If the twine tension is too tight, 
the difficulties mentioned in 1 and 2 may be increased, so much 
force being required to draw the twine from the box that the
-P-A-G-E-407
GRAIN-BINDERS 395 
sudden passage of the needle upward pulls the twine from the 
disk instead. Broken twine is frequently the result of having 
the twine too tight. In this case the needle becomes unthreaded. 
6. Needle trouble. If a bundle is discharged with the twine 
extending back to the needle eye, it is an indication that the 
needle failed to deliver its twine to the twine disk. As a result 
the loop and knot were made in the usual way, but only one end 
. was cut off. The disk of course was not threaded for the follow- 
ing bundle. This trouble may come from the fact that the needle 
pitman does not permit the needle to travel sufficiently far for- 
ward, though this is seldom the case. What happens more fre- 
quently is that straws or trash interfere with the proper placing 
of the twine in the disk. On the discharge of the following 
bundle the disk may catch the twine and the third bundle will 
be properly bound. 
7. Several bands clinging to bill hook, This is usually the 
result of several successive misses and may be caused by any of 
the preceding troubles where the knot is left on the bill hook. 
More general troubles are the following : 
1. Loose drive chain. Vf the main drive chain is too loose, it 
attempts to climb the teeth in the small sprocket on the second- 
ary shaft and results in a jerky motion. The tension should be 
tightened or a link removed. 
2. Creeping canvases. If the canvases are too loose or if the 
elevators are not square, the canvases creep; that is, the slats do 
not remain parallel to the rollers. The remedy is obvious. 
3. Ragged bundles. Ragged bundles may be due to (a) im- 
proper manipulation of the reel, (4) improper setting of butt- 
adjuster, (c) improper position of binder head, (@) creeping 
canvases. The explanation of ragged bundles as related to these 
difficulties is made upon the assumption that the grain is in good 
condition. There are times of course when the condition of the 
grain makes good bundles impossible. 
4. Choking on the deck. This frequently happens in light, 
fluffy, overripe grain. The only remedy is to lower the deck 
cover if possible. 
5. Tier-shaft motion irregular. Vf the tier shaft, or the whole 
binder head, in fact, starts tardily when tripped, or, after starting,
-P-A-G-E-408
396 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
runs with a jerky motion or makes successive revolutions without 
stopping, the trouble is with the dog in the binder-head clutch. 
When the trip arm releases the dog stop, a spring behind the 
dog should force it to engage the clutch with the driving motion 
and start the binder head at once. It should remain in engage- 
ment throughout the complete revolution of the tier shaft. The 
dog stop may become so worn that it will not throw the dog out 
of engagement with the clutch, and the tier shaft continues to 
revolve. The face of the stop may be filed, or its length adjusted 
to remedy the trouble. The length of this stop should be such 
as to prevent play in the tier shaft. 
6. Discharging very small bundles. This is due to imperfect 
contact between the dog and dog stop. The remedy is the same 
as that in 5. 
7. Choking machine in wet ground. This trouble is often un- 
avoidable. Only a part of a swath should be cut, and relief may 
be had by tying the bundles looser and making them smaller. 
The bundle-carrier. There are two types of bundle-carriers in 
common use. In one (Fig. 385) the fingers of the carrier are 
held at right angles to the direction of travel, and in discharging 
bundles they fold backward and downward. This type is a little 
difficult to hold in position if high stubbles or other obstructions 
are in the way. It is also sometimes difficult, particularly in heavy 
grain, to return it quickly enough to catch the first bundle de- 
livered after dumping; hence the piles are likely to be scattered. 
In the other type the fingers point backward and are carried par- 
allel to the direction of travel. To discharge the load the carrier 
is simply dropped to the ground. This carrier tends to scatter 
bundles in going up hill, but it discharges the load quickly, as a 
rule, and makes neat and regular bunches. Either type should 
be so adjusted as to lock when receiving bundles, so that the 
operator will not be required to hold the carrier in place by sheer 
foot pressure. 
The tongue truck. All binders having a seven-foot or eight-foot 
cut should be equipped with a tongue truck (Fig. 393). A truck 
takes all the weight off the horses’ necks. The horses, too, turn 
the machine with their traces rather than with the neck yoke, 
and if there is any side draft the truck takes it off the team.  
-P-A-G-E-409
  
GRAIN-BINDERS ~ 307 
Better adjustment of the machine is possible with a truck than 
without one. The so-called ‘‘ quick-turning”’ truck is best, as it 
does not tip over in turning a corner. 
Size of binder. Not many years ago 5-foot cuts were common 
and the 6-foot cut was large. Now, however, all companies are 
selling more 7-foot cuts than anything else, and a large number 
of 8-foot cuts are sold. The 8-foot binder is a 4-horse machine, 
and, indeed, 4 horses ought to be used on the 7-foot binder. If 
one has as much as 30 acres of grain each year, an 8-foot machine 
will be found profitable. 
Transport trucks. The transport trucks should be so made as 
to be quickly and easily removed. In most binders one man can 
now easily truck or un- 
truck a binder except for 
putting the tongue on. 
Formerly it took two or 
three men to perform the 
task. 
Care of the binder. The 
binder should be carefully 
inspected at frequent in- 
tervals when it is being 
used, to make sure that 
all nuts are tight and Fic. 400. A self-rake

oiled at least twice each day while the faster-running parts, such 
as the packers, should be oiled several times a day. At the end 
of each season the binder should be carefully cleaned and put 
away under cover. It should not be left out in the field for days 
or weeks to rust and rot. The knife, the end of the needle, 
and the knotter should be well oiled or they will rust badly, even 
though the machine is kept in a shed. While in use the binder 
should be gone over frequently to see that all nuts are tight. 
This will often prevent broken parts. The canvases should be 
removed at night or should be well covered to prevent their be- 
coming wet from rain or dew; when the binder is stored for

the winter they should be taken off and hung up in a dry place 
where mice cannot get at them. 
The header. In the extreme western part of the country the 
header is used to some extent. This is an adaptation of the 
modern binder in which the cutting-parts, platform, and reel are 
similar to those of the common binder. The machine, which is 
pushed ahead of the team of from 4 to 6 horses, cuts a swath 
from 12 to 20 ft. wide. The heads of the grain are clipped off 
and elevated into wagons drawn along by the side of the machine. 
Some types are provided with a binding-attachment, in which 
case they are called header-binders. The combined header and 
thresher is in rather common use in some of the Western states. 
In one operation the grain is cut, threshed, and sacked. The 
sacks are dropped on the ground as the work proceeds and may 
lie there for weeks before being hauled away, as no rain occurs 
at this season of the year. These machines may be propelled by 
horses or by engine power, and they are capable of harvesting 
100 acres per day.

CHAPTER XXIV 
CORN-HARVESTERS 
Cutting corn is undoubtedly one of the most difficult and dis- 
agreeable tasks that the farmer must perform. Though a great 
effort has been made to develop machinery to make this task 
less arduous, nothing has been perfected thus far that may be 
considered a complete success. It cannot be said that the ma- 
chines are always at fault, for some of them work well under 
favorable conditions. But the corn crop is so easily blown down 
when near maturity that it is the exception rather than the rule 
to find a field where the corn stands straight and even. There 
are several types of simple cutters which are widely used the 
country over, and both the binder and the shocker are used with 
a considerable degree of success. 
The sled cutter. The “sled cutter,” so-called, is one of the 
simpler machines that works satisfactorily if the corn stands 
straight. This cutter is usually mounted on wheels, though it 
may be drawn on runners. It is drawn by one horse and cuts two 
rows at a time, requiring two men to operate it; the operators, 
one on either side, stand or sit just back of the stationary knife. 
As the cutter is drawn forward they grasp the corn just before 
the knives cut it off. When an armful is collected, the horse is 
stopped and the corn carried and set up. Obviously the operators 
cannot stoop to gather up stocks that are down. 
Modifications of the sled type. Efforts have been made to 
devise some means for collecting the corn on the platform so 
that the operators need only carry it to the shock. One har- 
vester employs a large screw about 10 in. in diameter and 6 ft. 
long, extending backward from a point at the extreme front 
end of the machine at an angle of 45° with the ground. The 
rotation of this screw carries the corn back, as the knives cut 
it off, into an arm which holds it in a vertical position, The

horse is stopped as usual and the corn carried to the shock. 
This type has met with only fair success and is used very little. 
Another cutter,  illus- 
trated in Figs. gor and 
402, carries the corn back 
by chains and drops it on 
the platform in a horizon- 
tal position. The opera- 
tors have simply to carry 
the corn to the shock. It 
is not necessary to stop 
the horse if the men can 
keep up with the machine. 
This machine is used to 
advantage in cutting corn 
  Fic. 401. Front view of a one-horse cutter for the  ensilage-cutter, 
though of course it does 
not bind it. Owing to its low first cost and to its simplicity it is 
meeting with a great deal of favor and promises to become popular. 
Still another modification provides a platform with a central 
tree around which the 
operators set the corn as 
it is cut, until a full shock 
is accumulated. It is then 
tied, and by means of a 
windlass the tree is raised 
and the shock set off to 
the rear. The tree is then 
withdrawn and placed in 
its original position. This 
cutter has not met with 
much favor, for the shocks 
are not large enough to 
be set up well and con- 
sequently soon fall down. 
The corn-binder. The 
corn-binder has not proved so popular as was anticipated when it 
was first put upon the market in a large way. There are several 
  Fic. 402. Rear view of cutter shown in Fig. 401  
-P-A-G-E-413
CORN-HARVESTERS 401 
objections to its use, the more common ones being the following : 
(1) it does not do a neat job; (2) it knocks off too many ears ; 
(3) it is difficult to get men to shock after it; and (4) if the corn 
were being cut by hand, the teams could be used in preparing 
the ground for wheat where it is customary to follow corn with 
wheat. Not all of these objections are real, however; some are 
purely local, and others do not obtain at all. Where men are not 
to be had for cutting by hand, it is conceded that corn is more

Fic. 403. Side view of a corn-binder 
‘The bundles are bound while standing in a vertical position, There are no packers on 
this machine, though most of the other makes have them 
quickly cut by means of the machine. For those who have silos 
to fill, the binder is in great favor. 
Fig. 403 shows a side view of a typical corn-binder. The long 
projecting noses on the rails of the binder can be set close to the 
ground, ‘so as to pick up lodged stalks surprisingly well. They 
will pick up nearly all the lodged stalks except those leaning 
directly away from the machine. Many stalks lying rather flat are 
broken off by the binder noses, however, because of the weight 
of the ear. The corn is conveyed to the reciprocating knife by 
elevator chains, there being at frequent intervals links, known as
-P-A-G-E-414
  402 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
picker links, provided with fingers. These elevator chains force 
the corn back to the knife, which is usually provided with three 
sections and a short pitman. 
After the corn is cut off by the knife, it is conveyed to the 
binder head. In some machines the corn is bound while in a 
vertical position. In this case the packers receive the corn as it 
leaves the elevator chains, and then force it against the trip arm, 
as in the grain-binder. The binder head is nearly the same as that 
found on the wheat-binder 
except that all parts of it 
are slightly heavier. 
If the corn is bound in 
a horizontal position, it 
drops upon the deck after 
leaving the elevator chains, 
and there it comes within 
the reach of the packers. 
A butter is used on most 
machines to assist in pass- 
ing the corn from the ele- 
vator chains to the deck. 
One binder which binds 
the bundles while in a 
Fic. 404. Gasoline engine attached to a corn- vertical position has no

With the engine attached 2 horses can easily draw claimed, and the claim 
the binder seems reasonable, that as 
a result fewer ears are knocked off than where packers are pro- 
vided. It is also considered that where the corn drops upon a 
horizontal deck, additional ears are knocked off. A bundle-carrier 
similar to that of the grain-binder is provided with all machines. 
A stubble-cutter, which is a great convenience in seeding, is 
frequently used if wheat is to follow the corn. It consists of a 
knife carried along close to the surface of the ground. The corn 
may be cut at different heights by raising or lowering the binder 
on the two wheels. Ample adjustment should be provided so that 
the elevator noses may be set to run very close to the ground if 
the corn is badly lodged.
-P-A-G-E-415
  
CORN-HARVESTERS 403 
In operating the binder it is the custom in many parts of the 
country first to “heart” the field; that is, stools are tied and 
2 rows are cut on each side. This opens up the way for the 
binder, and since it provides a substantial support for the shocks, 
very few of them fall down. The other plan is to go around the 
field and cut all of the corn with the machine, using a horse, or 
tree, to start the shock. The corn-binder is essentially a 3-horse 
machine, but inasmuch as it is somewhat difficult to handle 3 
horses in a cornfield, some prefer to use only 2 horses, changing 
teams in the middle of each half day. 
The size of the shocks, whether cut by hand or by a machine, 
varies greatly in different sections of the country. Where the 
ground is seeded to wheat, the shocks are commonly made 4 by 24, 
5 by 20, or 12 by 12; that is, the shocks are made to contain 
96 or 100 or 144 hills respectively. In the first two sizes the shock 
rows are not seeded at all, but in the last, wheat is seeded around 
the shocks. If the ground is not to be seeded, the corn is usually 
cut 10 by 10, making 100 hills to the shock. 
The corn-shocker. The corn-shocker stands less in favor than 
the binder, but many farmers are using the shocker and liking it. 
They find it a one-man machine, and by care seem to be able to 
do good work with it. Others have tried it and failed. The chief 
trouble seems to be that the shocks do not stand up well. It 
would seem that if the bottoms were made larger the shocks 
would stand better; from the way in which the shock is formed, 
it is next to impossible to make one that will stand up straight 
for any length of time. The shock is collected around a central 
tree, tied, and set off to the rear by means of a windlass. The 
tree is then pulled out and replaced ready for another shock. 
The picker-husker. In sections where the fodder is not valued 
highly, the picker-husker is used to some extent. This machine 
has a pair of rolls which snap the ears off and carry them up to 
husking-rolls. After passing over these rolls, which remove the 
husks, the ears are elevated into a wagon which is drawn along- 
side the machine. There are other machines which simply pick 
the ears but do not husk them. 
Cost of cutting by three common methods. While it is difficult 
to figure costs except for local conditions, the following comparative  
-P-A-G-E-416
    404 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
figures may be taken as an approximate average for Ohio. These 
figures are made on the assumption that the corn is cut 10 by 
10in., in which case there will be 35 shocks per acre; that 
an average hand will cut 1 acre a day by hand; that 2 men 
with a sled cutter will cut 105 shocks, or 3 acres; that 7 acres is 
an average day’s work for a man and team of 3 horses with a 
binder, 2 men being required to set the corn up; and, further, 
that 30 acres of corn will be cut with the binder each year. The 
figures represent the cost of cutting per acre, (1) by hand, 
(2) with the sled, and (3) with the binder :

CHAPTER XXV 
WAGONS 
A wagon is an absolute necessity on the modern farm. Perhaps 
no other tool is used so many days in the year, and certainly no 
other tool is called upon to do its work under such varying con- 
ditions as the farm wagon. As a rule farmers think that there is 
very little difference in wagons, and consequently they give but 
  
7 
  
    
Fic. 405. Wheels with patent hubs 
  little attention to their construction. A little study of the ques- 
tion, however, will convince anyone that there is a great variation 
in the types found on the market. 
Material. Oak, hickory, and poplar are the materials which 
enter most largely into the construction of good farm wagons. 
The best manufacturers insist on having the material air-dried 
rather than kiln-dried. The air-drying process requires at least 
three years’ time, but results in a more uniform product. Kiln 
drying is frequently done too rapidly, and the stock is not uni- 
formly cured. Many parts of the best wagons are soaked in 
405 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
406 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
linseed oil before being used, a process which makes them less 
susceptible to the action of the weather. 
The wheels. The wheels are without question the vital part of 
a wagon. The hubs are usually made of oak or of black birch. 
It is difficult to say which 
is the better material, since 
both are used by standard 
companies. One firm claims 
that birch is better, since, 
because of its yielding nature, 
it holds the spokes more 
firmly when they are driven 
into it. ; 
A patent hub is being used 
on some wagons (Fig. 405). 
This hub has some advan- 
tages over the compressed 
hub, but is more severe on 
fellies and tires and is con- 
sidered by some smiths to be more difficult to repair. 
The spokes are made of oak or of hickory. They should be 
evenly tapered at the hub tenon, and the shoulder should be cut 
with some taper also (Fig. 406) —§_—<2___________. 
in order that the weight may 
be borne evenly over the en- 
tire. surface. The mortises in 
the hub are cut so as to give 
the wheel the proper dish, that 
it may hold the tire better 
and that it may withstand side 
thrust or extra strain to which 
it is subjected, as when on 
sidehills. In addition to these prickory axles with castiron skeins are used. points, dish in a wheel is bene- The piece above the axle is called the sand 
ficial in providing for the ex- hoard 
pansion and contraction of the tires. The fellies are chiefly of 
oak, and may be bent or sawed to shape. The two methods seem 
to be equally good. A rivet through the felly on either side of

each spoke is of advantage in preventing splitting. The tires 
must of course be heavy, and for average farm conditions should 
not be less than 24 in, or 3 in. wide. The 4-inch tire is grow- 
ing in favor, and experimental 
evidence shows that the wide 
tire effects a decided saving 
in draft. 
The height of the wheels 
varies a great deal. As usu- 
ally classified, there are three 
heights, known to the trade as 
low, medium, and high. A low- 
wheeled wagon generally has 
36-inch front wheels and 44- 
inch rear wheels, and a high-wheeled wagon has 44-inch front 
wheels and 52-inch rear wheels. The medium-wheeled wagon 
is the class most commonly used by farmers. Where two wagons 
are needed on a farm, it is a good plan to have one low-wheeled 
wagon for ordinary farm 
teaming. It is, further, 
very desirable to have at 
least one wide-tired wagon, 
with a tire, say, 4 in. wide. 
The axles. The axles 
are generally made of 
hickory. They may be pro- 
vided with either cast-iron 
or steel skeins (Figs. 407, 
408, and 409). There does 
not seem to be much 
choice between the two 
types. In either case they 
should be fastened to the 
axle by clips rather than 
by bolts. Other things be- 
ing equal, that gear is best which has the fewest bolt-holes in the 
various parts. Many axles are provided with a steel truss, which 
not only strengthens the axle but holds the skeins in position.

The steel skeins are clipped to the axle. Notice 
the well-braced standards 
    Fic. 409. The bolster is fastened to the axle 
by clips 
 
-P-A-G-E-420
  408 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The skeins are so constructed and fastened to the axles as to 
give the wheels what is called gather and what is called pitch, or 
set. In the attachment of the skein the outer end is given a slight 
inclination toward the front, an inclination which holds the wheel 
against the collar and prevents its running against the nut. This 
is called gather; that is, such a setting gathers the front portion 
of the wheels. The full load on a wagon should be carried upon 
a plumb spoke, but inasmuch as the wheels are dished, the skeins 
must be so sloped as to give the proper set to the wheels and at the 
same time to cause the wheel to run toward the collar rather than 
toward the nut. This feature of construction is variously termed 
pitch, set, or bottom gather. With the proper pitch and gather, a 
heavily loaded wagon 
“chucks,” as we say ; 
that is, the wheels 
bear against neither 
the shoulder of the 
skein nor the nut with 
sufficient pressure to 
hold them in either

low steel wheels for the standard wagon   
        
two extremes. 
Miscellaneous parts. The gear parts, such as hounds, bolsters, 
reaches, and poles, are usually made of oak. As said before, the 
parts should be clipped rather than bolted together. The eveners 
and the neck yoke are made of hickory. The box, which is made 
of yellow poplar, should be well ironed and braced, as it gen- 
erally is one of the first parts of a wagon to wear out. It 
should have at least three coats of good paint. The brake is 
now generally attached to the gears, the underslung type being 
in highest favor. 
Size and capacity. The size of a wagon is generally specified 
by giving the size of skein, the height of wheels, and the width 
of tire. There are two widths of track —the narrow, or regular, 
track and the wide track (the former measuring 4} ft., the 
latter, 5 ft., from center to center of tires on the ground). The 
regular track is used almost exclusively in the Northern states.

The steel wagon. Many of the ordinary farm wagons are 
equipped with a steel axle, but only a few, except certain low- 
wheeled farm trucks, have all their gears and wheels of steel. As 
timber becomes scarcer the steel wagon will probably become more 
popular. On the other hand, as roads become improved and the 
hard brick and macadam roads replace the earth road, the weak- 
ness of the steel wagon will become more evident, which fact will 
militate against its use. It is a common observation, that since run- 
ning gears and wheels of steel are not as yielding under the strain 
of heavy loads as those of wood, the jar of rough roads will cause 
the parts to loosen to a greater degree than in an all-wood wagon. 
Roller bearings have been used to a limited extent on wagons, 
but the saving in draft has never been considered sufficient to 
offset the increased cost of construction. Moreover it becomes 
impossible to give the skein the proper gather and pitch when 
the roller bearing is used. . 
The draft of wagons. The draft of a wagon refers to the 
number of pounds of pull required to move it. It is measured 
exactly as a spring balance measures the weight hung upon its 
hook. The draft depends upon several things, among which are 
the nature of the roadbed, the weight of the load, the height of 
the wheels, the width of the tire, and the efficiency of the 
bearings. All of these may be included in three factors: (1) axle 
friction, (2) rolling resistance, and (3) grade resistance, 
 
-P-A-G-E-422
410 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Axle friction is a very small factor in determining the draft 
of a wagon. Naturally it depends upon the nature of the bearing 
surface and the state of lubrication as well as upon the ratio of 
the radius of the wheel to the radius of the axle. If X represents 
the radius of the wheel, 7 the radius of the axle, / the force 
required to move the wheel, and / the frictional resistance, then 
xt xares 
i 
whence aire 
a formula which goes to show that the power required to overcome 
frictional resistance varies inversely as the radius of the wheel. 
Rolling resistance is dependent chiefly upon the nature of the 
roadbed and the height of the wheels. Drawing a load over a

The underslung brake is the better type. The lever on the bed controls the brake 
muddy road is equivalent, in a measure, to pulling the load over 
an obstruction. A high wheel affords a greater power arm than 
a low wheel, and hence requires less force to draw it over similar 
obstructions. Furthermore a small wheel will sink further into a 
roadbed than will a high wheel under similar conditions. 
The following tests compare the draft of a similar load on high, 
medium, and low wheels on different road surfaces. A load of

of the loaded wagon with each set of wheels was with high wheels, 
3762 lb. ; with medium wheels, 3580 lb. ; with low wheels, 3362 lb.

The results are uniformly in favor of the high wheels, the 
difference being greatest on grassland and plowed land, where 
the average farmer does the most of. his teaming. It should be 
said, however, that draft is not the only factor that enters into 
the choice of height of wheels, and that in general the medium 
wheels are to be preferred even though the draft is rather more 
than is the case with the higher wheels.

The width of the tire is of even greater importance than the 
height of the wheel, particularly on the farm. The following 
tests show the influence of width of tire on the draft of wagons 
on various road surfaces. The net load was 2000 Ib. in all cases.

narrow tires were quite damaging. These tests are a forceful 
argument for broad tires on field and road. 
The grade resistance is purely a function of the angle of the 
incline, or of the per cent of grade. A grade is usually expressed

Fig. 413 it may be seen that the grade resistance is the measure 
of the force P which is required to keep the load from rolling 
down the plane. If W is the weight of the load, then 
PX AC=Wx BC;

In a general way the length of AC is virtually equal to AB, 
in which case the grade resistance is determined by multiplying 
the weight of the load by the vertical rise of the grade in each 
100 ft. Thus, for a 2500-pound load the grade resistance on a 
10 per cent grade is 250 Ib.; that is, a force of 250 lb. more is 
required to draw the load up a 10 per cent grade than to draw 
it on a level road of the same kind. whence Pi WeX

  CHAPTER XXVI 
MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS AND MACHINES 
This chapter includes a brief discussion of tools and machines 
of which some are of importance but, because of lack of space, can 
be only superficially discussed ; others are of interest to but rela- 
tively few farmers ; and still others, though used to some extent, 
are not absolutely essential to the average farm. Some machines 
in the last class, however, should be more commonly used. 
ENSILAGE-CUTTERS 
The number of silos in the United States has increased at 
an enormous rate in the last two decades, and as a result the 
ensilage-cutter has been developed and is now on the market in 
various forms and sizes. 
The cutting-head. There are two types of cutting-heads in com- 
mon use, the radial-knife cutter and the cylinder, or spiral-knife, 
cutter. The radial- 
knife cutter, shown 
in Fig. 414, has 
the _cutting-blades 
and the blower fans 
mounted together, as 
shown in Fig. 415. 
There may be 2, 3, 
or 4 knives on the 
flywheel, the length 
of cut being con- 
trolled in part in this way. The sfzra/ knife is shown in Fig. 417. 
The cutting-blades and the fan, or blower, are mounted separately. 
There is a difference of opinion as to which is the better type. 
One company which manufactures both types recommends the 
radial-knife cutter when a small engine is to be used and the 
414 
  Fic. 414. A radial-knife cutter

MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS AND MACHINES 415 
spiral-knife cutter when a steam engine or a large gasoline engine 
is used. The reason for this is that the radial-knife cutter requires 
slightly less power than the other type and will not so well stand 
the heavy strain to which it is sub- 
jected when it is pushed to the 
limit by a high-power engine. It is 
probably more difficult in the radial- 
knife cutter than in the spiral-knife 
cutter to keep the nice adjustment 
between the knives and the cutting- 
bar, which is so desirable. The 
radial-knife cutter clears the blower 
well, since the cut feed drops di- 
rectly upon the fans. In the spiral 
Fic. 415. Knives and blower fans type the feed must be drawn into 
og aan te ue the blower-case after it is cut off. 
The spiral-knife cutter seems to handle alfalfa and similar feeds 
better than the radial-knife cutter does. 
Shredding-heads (Fig. 416) or combined cutting-and-shredding 
heads are provided for attachment to either type of cutter. The 
spiral-knife type lends itself to a 
greater variety of attachments for 
such purposes than does the radial- 
knife head. 
The blower. Most ensilage- 
cutters are equipped with a blower 
for elevating the ensilage into the 
silo. Although it requires from 
four to five more horse power to 
operate the common sizes when 
equipped with the blower than 
when the web carrier is used, the 
former lends itself much better Fis- 416. A radial-knife head with

is available, the web carrier serves the purpose well. 
Tt is essential that the fan and the fan-case should be con- 
structed of the best material and be substantially made in every 
     
-P-A-G-E-428
  416 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
way, to avoid danger from bursting ; otherwise the high speed 
of the fan and the consequent great pressure created within the 
an-case will be very likely to cause the fan-case to burst. 
The feed-table and feed-rolls. The corn is carried to the feed- 
rolls by an endless web (Fig. 418), the speed of which can be 
varied by changing 
gears so as to cut the 
ensilage in different 
lengths. The length 
varies from } in. to 
Ifin., } in. being the 
most common cut. The 
feed-rolls (Fig. 419) 
must be positive in 
their action and must 
automatically adjust 
themselves to large 
and to small bunches. 
The upper roll is so arranged that it may be raised at both ends 
at the same time or at one end at a time. The lever for throw- 
ing the feed-carrier out of gear and for reversing the motion 
should be convenient to 
the operator. 
Speed. In the spiral- 
knife cutter the cutting- 
head is driven at from 550 
to 650 R. P.M., and the 
fan at from 650 to 1000 
R.P.M. The radial-knife 
head is driven at a speed 
of 650 to 1000 R. P.M.

engine is used, the

HUuSKERS AND SHREDDERS 
The corn husker and shredder is called upon to perform the 
combined task of husking the corn and shredding the fodder. 
The task is more severe than that imposed upon the grain- 
separator, since the fodder is, as a rule, heavy and frequently not 
in the best condition. 
General construction. The general construction of the husker- 
shredder is shown in Fig. 421. Corn to be husked is delivered upon 
the feed-table, 
from which it 
is carried, by 
means of the 
feed-carrier, to 
the snapping- 
rolls. Passing 
between these, 
the ears are

ing rack; /, blower the husking- 
rolls beneath. 
These rolls are placed at an angle with the horizontal and are 
provided with projecting pegs. As the ears pass down the plane 
the revolving rolls pick off the husks, which fall through upon 
the husk-carrier and are conveyed to the blower. The ears of 
corn fall from the husking-rolls to the elevator, by which they are 
carried to the wagon or 
to the crib. The fodder 
passes from the snapping- 
rolls into the shredder 
head and then to the blower. 
The cleaning-fan separates 
the husks and dirt from the shelled corn, which it delivers in bags. 
The snapping-rolls. The snapping-rolls are of cast iron, and 
the upper one is free to move up and down to accommodate large 
or small bundles. The corrugated surface of the rolls takes firm 
hold of the fodder.

Fic. 422. A shredding-cylinder
-P-A-G-E-431
  MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS AND MACHINES 419 
The shredding-cylinder. The shredding-cylinder (Fig. 422) is 
usually provided with sharp fingers that tear the fodder into shreds. 
It may be equipped with knives that cut rather than shred. It is 
claimed that the sharp, sliverlike pieces of the shredded stalks 
are more injurious to the mouths of the stock that eat the fodder 
than are the cut stalks. However, the general custom is to shred 
rather than to cut the feed. 
The husking-rolls. The husking-rolls are arranged in pairs. 
The rolls of each pair revolve toward each other, and the pegs 
with which they are pro- 
vided strip off the husks 
and pass the ears on to 
the conveyer. They are 
made of cast iron and are 
from 30 to 50 in. long. 
The size of the husker is 
determined by the num- 
ber of husking-rolls, there 
being from 2 to 12 rolls. 
Capacity and power. 
It is very difficult to state 
the capacity of a husker, 
since so much depends 
upon the kind of corn and 
its condition. Ordinarily 
one would expect to husk 
100 pa ee day for ae Fic. 423. Feed-table, feed-carrier, and snap- 
pair of rolls; that is, a ping-rolls of a husker-shredder 
4-roll husker would husk 
200 bu. per day under average conditions. Where a gasoline 
engine is used to operate the cutter, about 4 H.P. is required for 
each pair of rolls. A shredder head requires from 2 to 4 H.P. 
more than a cutter head. 
A small husker. The market offers a small 2-roll husker and 
shredder designed for the individual farmer. It is inexpensive 
and requires only a 5-horse-power engine to operate it. It per- 
forms the work in a thoroughly satisfactory manner and has a 
capacity of about 150 bu. per day,

FEED-GRINDERS 
The individual farmer frequently finds it to his advantage to

plane and are mounted upon the main shaft of the mill. The 
middle burr, with a grinding-face on both sides, revolves with 
the main shaft, while the two 
outer burrs are stationary. If 
ear corn is being ground, the 
ears are broken up by the 
upper cutter and the lower 
crusher and are reduced to a 
comparatively fine condition 
before reaching the burrs. 
The grain is forced into the 
burrs near the center and is 
reduced to the proper degree 
of fineness as it is forced to 
the edge. 
  to town and pay from 3 
to 5 cents per bushel for 
having it ground, when in 
the same time it could 
have been done at home 
and the cash outlay saved. 
The common use of small 
gasoline engines has made 
the home use of feed mills 
particularly desirable. 
The _ grinding-plates. 
The grinding-plates, or 
burrs, may be divided into 
two classes, disk grinders 
and cone grinders. One 
type of disk power grinder 
is shown in Fig. 424. 
The burrs in this grinder 
are supported in a vertica 
  Fic. 425. A corn-grinder with cone 
grinding-plates 
 
-P-A-G-E-433
  
MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS AND MACHINES 421 
The cone grinders are shown in Fig. 425. The movable cone 
is mounted upon the main shaft with the stationary cone supported 
> in heavy framework around it. Each 
of the cones is made up of sections 
which are easily removed for repair. 
As in the former mill, ear corn is re- 
duced to a fair degree of fineness before 
it reaches the grinding-plates. 
Proper adjustment of either type calls 
for a quick release, by which the plates 
may be separated so that they will not 
touch should the hopper become empty. 
The cone type is probably superior to 
the disk type in that the cones 
may be so regulated as not to 
touch, even when the mill is 
empty. This is true in a few 
disk mills also, but not in all. 
A spring release is usually 
provided, so that the burrs may 
spread should any obstruction, 
such as a nail, pass through. 
The  grinding-plates are 
usually made of chilled iron. 
Steel plates are sometimes used, but grain sticks to them and 
they are not so lasting as good 
chilled plates. Either type of 
mill will handle ear corn with 
the husks on, or ear corn with 
oats, with barley, or with other 
small grain. 
Capacity and power required. 
The size of a grinder is deter- 
mined by the diameter of the 
burrs, and the capacity depends Fic. 428. Grinding-plates and gears of

upon the kind of grain being 
ground, the fineness to which it is ground, and the speed of the 
grinder. A fair rate seems to be about two or three bushels per 
    Fic. 427. Gears of mill shown in Fig. 426

    422 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
hour for each horse power used in driving the machine. The 
former figure applies to small-sized grinders. 
Sacking attachments. Small elevators with belt carriers to 
facilitate handling the ground grain may be provided at slight cost. 
Sweep mills. Fig. 426 shows a sweep mill for use with horse 
power. Cone grinding-plates.are used in this mill, one of them 
being geared up to a speed from six to twelve times that of the 
sweep. This mill will grind from four to six bushels per hour 
with a good team on the sweep. A power attachment is frequently 
used in connection with the sweep power. 
Alfalfa-grinders. There are now on the market a number of. 
mills especially designed for grinding alfalfa, though it is claimed 
that the mills above described-will handle it alone or in connec- 
tion with other grains. 
Potato MACHINERY 
Where potatoes are grown on a large scale, special machinery 
is- absolutely essential for the economical handling of the crop. 
The chief special 
tools needed are the 
planter, the digger, 
and the sprayer. 
The planter. There 
are two general types 
of potato-planters. on 
the market, the dif- 
ference in them be- 
ing in the manner 
in which the potato 
pieces are selected 
and deposited in 
the ground. They 
might be designated 
as the one-man and 
. the two-man planter. 
Fig. 429 shows a sectional view of the one-man, or picker, 
planter. The seed is carried in the hopper, which is usually   
  Fic. 429. A picker potato-planter

  MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS AND MACHINES 423 
supplied with an agitator to work the seed down. The revolving 
shaft is equipped in this particular planter with three arms, on 
the ends of which are picker points. As these points pass up 
through the seed-hopper, they pick up pieces, one only to each 
point, and carry them over to the furrow-opener, At the proper 
time a stripper forces the pieces off the. points and into the 
bottom of the furrow. This drop works with surprising accuracy. 
  
    
Fic. 430. A two-man potato-planter 
Tt is seldom that the points fail to pick a piece when traveling 
through the hopper. 
The distance between pieces, or the rate of dropping, is regu- 
lated by changing the speed of the revolving arms, or, in some 
planters, by varying the number of arms. The common distances 
are 11, 13, and 15 in. At the 11-inch rate, from 12 to 14 bu. 
are required to seed 1 A. 
Fig. 430 shows the two-man potato-planter. A large plate 
similar to a corn-planter plate, except, of course, that it is larger, 
revolves beneath the hopper. A portion of it projects beyond the 
hopper to the rear, as shown. As the plate revolves, each hole 
 
-P-A-G-E-436
424 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
selects a piece of seed, carries it to the shank, and drops it into 
the furrow. In order to make sure that each cell will contain a 
piece, it is necessary that a man or boy ride fust to the rear of 
the planter. With this 
planter there is abso- 
lute certainty that the 
pieces will be accu- 
rately spaced, while in 
the other type there 
are certain to be miss- 
ing hills. 
The furrow-opener, 
which is of the shoe 
Fic. 431. A standard elevator potato-digger type, mustbe supported 
substantially and must 
have a keen blade, since if the potatoes are properly planted, it 
must run from four to five inches deep. 
The covering-device, which is essential, may be made up of 
disks, one on each side of the row, or it may be composed of 
two stationary curved blades, as illustrated in connection with 
corn-planters. When the disks 
are used for covering, there is 
a tendency to run the furrow- 
opener too shallow and to de- 
pend upon the disks to cover 
the seed properly. This re- 
sults in placing the seed too 
close to the surface of the 
ground, and much of it be- 
comes completely uncovered 
by later working of the soil. 
This is not, however, a fault 
of the planter but an exam- 
ple of poor judgment in its 
operation. 
All planters may be supplied with fertilizer-attachments by 
means of which varying amounts of fertilizer may be supplied. 
The fertilizer must be so distributed that it will not come in

contact with the seed. Then, too, better results will be secured if 
it is distributed over a wide space and not dropped in a narrow row.

picking-attachment 
The digger is drawn by horses, the engine operating the 
elevator and picker The potato-digger. 
The work of the 
potato-digger is com- 
plicated and difficult. 
The machine must lift 
the potatoes with a 
section of soil about 
six inches deep and 
twenty inches wide, 
in varying states of 
physical condition, and 
it must separate the 
potatoes from this soil 
and from whatever 
weeds and trash may 
be present. A machine 
capable of accomplish- 
ing such work requires the best of material and construction. 
There is but one stand-   
ard type of digger, 
the type shown in 
Fig, 431. 
The plow, or cutting- 
blade, must be long 
and keen. For the 
best work it should be 
not less than twenty 
inches wide, the size 
of the digger being 
determined by the 
width of the plow,   
    
or (what amounts to Fic. 434. A barrel sprayer 
the same thing) of the This type of sprayer is suitable for a small acreage and 
may be used for orchard work as well elevator. 
The elevator. The rod elevator is the type used in nearly al   diggers. The details are fairly well shown in Fig. 431. Each

rod with its bent, hooked ends forms a link in the elevator. The 
upper fold of the elevator runs over two sets of elliptical sprockets 
  Fic. 435. A stalk-cutter 
This tool is used where the cornstalks are left on the 
ground and plowed under which (since they serve 
to jar the load) separate 
the earth from the pota- 
toes and cause it to drop 
through the elevator to 
the ground. Weeds and 
trash are carried to the 
rear by means of vibrat- 
ing arms and are directed 
to one side so that they 
will not be deposited upon 
the potatoes. The fork 
upon which the pota- 
toes and earth drop as 
they leave the elevator 
is given a vibrating mo- 
tion to assist further in 
freeing the potatoes of 
soil, vines, and trash. 
General features. The wheels must be strongly built and be pro- 
vided with strong wide cleats. Some diggers have been deficient 
in this respect. The elevator and shaker may be driven either 
  
  Fic. 436. A beet-seed planter 
 
-P-A-G-E-439
  MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS AND MACHINES 427 
by gears or by sprockets and chains. The usual arguments may 
be offered for each method. Perhaps the gear drive affords the 
more stable construction, but breaks are costly. The fore truck 
should have quick-turning wheels ; that is, the wheels should turn 
more sharply than the tongue, this action being of assistance in 
keeping the digger centered over the row and in turning at the 
  =] 
       le 
Fic. 437. A beet-lifter 
ends of the rows. All bearings should be easily oiled and as well 
protected from the dirt as possible. 
Potato-sprayers. The most important single feature in a 
potato-sprayer is the pump. In common with all spray pumps, 
its cylinder should be of brass and it should be of the double- 
acting type. A large air-chamber should be provided to equalize 
the pressure, and it is very convenient to have a valve next to 
the pump for the purpose of retaining the pressure should it be 
necessary to stop in the field. The pump should be capable of 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
  428 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
maintaining a pressure of one hundred pounds. The drive for 
the pump should be substantial yet simple. It is desirable to 
have the plunger connection so made that the length of stroke 
may be changed to regulate the plunger travel to the gait of 
the team, 
The nozzle supports should be adjustable as to both width and 
height. When the potatoes are small the nozzles should be car- 
ried close to the plants; and as the potatoes grow the nozzles 
must be raised accordingly. The width between the nozzles must 
of course be regulated according to the width of the rows. In 
some sprayers the nozzles are supported in front of the sprayer, 
just behind the horses. In the majority of cases, however, they 
are placed to the rear of the sprayer. The hose connecting the 
nozzles to the pump should be wrapped with wire to enable it 
to withstand the pressure. The barrel should be so located that 
too great weight will not be thrown on the tongue or shafts. 
An efficient agitator should be provided to keep the liquid well 
stirred up. : 
While many other miscellaneous machines might be discussed 
in this chapter, it is believed that those given consideration are 
representative of the ones in which the average farmer is most 
interested, and the limitations of a work of this kind preclude 
the mention of others.

CHAPTER XXVII 
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 
It has long been recognized that human energy is one of the 
most expensive sources of farm power, and the history and de- 
velopment of modern farm equipment is the result of an effort to 
reduce man labor to a minimum. The introduction of the gaso- 
line engine has made it possible to economize human labor to a 
surprising degree, for the tasks on a farm which an engine can be 
made to perform are numerous. It follows, then, that the wide- 
spread use of this important machine makes it imperative that 
farmers be instructed in the fundamental principles underlying 
its construction. 
The general principle. Gas, gasoline, and oil engines belong 
to a class known as zzternal-combustion engines, so named be- 
cause they derive their power from fuel burned inside of the 
cylinder. In contrast to this type is the steam engine, which 
might be called an external-combustion engine, because it derives 
its power from fuel burned outside of the cylinder. An engine 
operating on the internal-combustion principle has many decided 
advantages: (1) the energy of the fuel acts directly against the 
piston ; (2) the engine is ready to start as soon as power is re- 
quired ; (3) loss of energy is much less than in the steam engine ; 
(4) the engine does not require constant attention ; (5) the engine 
can be purchased in small units, as low as one-half horse power. 
On the other hand, the internal-combustion engine has some 
evident disadvantages : (1) there is a tendency to unsteady speed 
because of the intermittent power stroke ; (2) there is no reserve 
power to meet sudden demands made upon the engine; (3) high 
temperature in the cylinder makes lubrication difficult and makes 
necessary some cooling-device ; (4) a more or less troublesome 
ignition is required. 
General construction. All internal-combustion engines are con- 
structed in essentially the same manner, differing only in certain

details. Fig. 438 shows a sectional and a side view of a typical 
vertical engine. The dase of the engine supports the entire struc- 
ture and varies in shape, size, and general outline with the style 
of engine. In Fig. 438 
the base contains the fuel- 
tank, a common arrange- 
ment. Figs. 439, 440,

ent types of bases and sub- 
bases. In the bases for

Note the angle at which the bearings are placed, the 
better to take the thrust of the piston supported at an angle of 
  45°. This is a very desir- 
able construction, since the thrust due to the explosions is 
taken with much less strain on the bearings. 
The crankshaft-case in the vertical engine shown in Fig. 438 
rests upon the base, or the subbase, as it is sometimes called, and 
contains the crankshaft and the crankshaft bearings ; frequently, 
too, the reducing gears 
are contained within 
the case. In the sec- 
tional view the plate 
on the left side of 
the crank-case is re- 
movable, the crank- 
shaft being inserted 
through this opening. 
The reducing gears 
are here shown at- 
tached to the side of 
the crank-case. 
The cylinder is mounted upon the crank-case, being bolted to 
it, as shown in the side view. The inlet valve (not shown) and 
the exhaust valve 7 are in the head end of the cylinder. The 
igniter block £ pierces the wall of the cylinder, which is cooled 
by the circulation of water through the jacket V.

of connecting-rods, some of the more common being shown in 
Fig. 443, A, B, C, and D. The connecting-rod is attached to the 
piston by means of 
the piston pin shown 
in the sectional view 
(Fig. 438). The pis- 
ton pin is held in 
place by the two set- 
screws shown, Several 
methods of clamping 
the connecting-rod to 
the piston pin are 
shown in Fig. 443, 
as are the different methods of fastening it to the crankshaft. 
It should be noted that both ends of the connecting-rod 
(Fig. 443, C) are clamped by the same bolt, which runs 
through the center of the rod. This makes it easy to adjust 
the bearings at each end, whereas in the other types it is neces- 
sary to remove the piston in order to tighten or loosen the 
bearing about the 
piston pin. 
The flywheels vary 
a great deal in size 
and in weight. Their 
function is to steady 
the speed and through 
their momentum en- 
able the engine to 
meet better the sud- 
den demands made 
upon it for increased power. The detailed parts shown in 
Fig. 438 will be discussed under the operation of the engine. 
Fig 448 shows a two-cylinder opposed type of engine. The 
two-cylinder engine makes it possible to secure an impulse, or 
working stroke, at each revolution of the flywheels, and when 
the cylinders are opposed the engine is much better balanced.

GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 433 
Types of engines. There are two general classes into which 
gasoline engines are divided — the 4-stroke cycle engine and the 
2-stroke cycle engine. These engines are commonly referred 
to as 4-cycle 
and 2-cycle en- 
gines respec- 
tively, but for 
the sake of 
clearness, as 
well as for ac- 
curacy of state- 
ment, the terms 
“4-stroke en- 
gine” and ‘‘2- 
stroke engine” 
will be used.

which the gases are compressed to the required degree, both 
valves being closed. At C is 
shown the expansion stroke, 
during which the gases, hav- VJ 
ing been ignited, expand and 
thus exert their full force 
against the piston head. This is the only working stroke in 
the cycle. At D is shown the exhaust stroke, during which the 
exhaust valve is held open and the burned gases are driven out. Fic. 444. A drop-forged crankshaft

The 2-stroke engine must of necessity take the same steps as 
does the 4-stroke engine, because none can be omitted; but the 
proper mechanism is sup- 
plied to make it possible 
to complete the 4 steps in 
2 strokes of the piston.

and the exhaust gases are seen escaping through the exhaust

the inlet port. It should be noted that both inlet and exhaust 
are uncovered at the same time. The deflector on the face of 
the piston tends to direct the incoming charge upward so that it 
assists in expelling the burned charge.

Thus, it is seen that at each stroke of the piston ¢zvo functions 
are performed, so that a cycle of operation is completed at each 
two strokes, or for each revolution of the flywheels. 
A comparison of the two types of engine reveals the following 
essential differences: (1) Since the 4-stroke engine receives an 
impulse only on every fourth stroke, large flywheels are required 
to carry the load during the other 3 strokes, and so the engine is 
of necessity a heavy one. The 2-stroke engine, receiving an im- , 
pulse every revolution, demands much smaller flywheels and 
frequently but 1 is used. For this reason the 2-stroke engine is 
especially desirable for motor boats and other places where space 
is at a premium and weight a consideration. (2) For reasons noted
-P-A-G-E-450
438 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
the 2-stroke engine is wasteful of fuel. The 4-stroke engine is 
more economical in this respect, using only about 75 per cent as 
much fuel as the 2-stroke en- 
gine, other conditions being 
similar. (3) The 2-stroke en- 
gine has no valves except 
the one shown at V in the 
figures, and in the 3-port 
engine (Fig. 451) even this 
is eliminated. The 4-stroke 
engine has 2 valves, which

Fic. 452. A pump-feed carburetor engine maintains a more con- 
stant speed than the 4-stroke 
engine, and for this reason may be better adapted to certain 
kinds of work. (5) The 2-stroke engine will show the effect of 
improper fuel adjustment more quickly than the 4-stroke engine. 
Since the 4-stroke engine is very 
much the more commonly used for 
farm work, the remainder of the 
chapter will deal entirely with -this 
type of engine. 
In the successful operation of an in- 
ternal combustion engine at least four 
things are absolutely essential: (1) @ 
proper fuel mixture in the cylinder; 
(2) proper compression of the charge; 
(3) a good spark, properly timed; 
(4) proper valve action. If each of these 
four things is accomplished, the en- 
gine will run. They will be taken up 
in their order, and the mechanism re- 
quired for each step and the principle 
involved will be briefly discussed. 
Carburetors. To secure a good fuel mixture in the cylinder, 
some form of carburetor is essential. As the name implies, a 
carburetor is a device for impregnating air with carbon, a thing Fic. 453. A fuel-pump 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-451
  GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 439 
which is accomplished in this case by passing air over or near 
the hydrocarbon fuel as it is drawn into the cylinder of the 
engine. There are three types of carburetors of interest here, 
and they are classified according to the method used to supply 
the fuel, as (1) pump-feed carburetors, (2) gravity-feed carburetors, 
and (3) suction-feed carburetors. All three types belong to the 
general class of spray car- 
buretors, since the fuel is 
injected into the cylinder 
in the form of a spray. 
A pump-feed carburetor 
is illustrated in Fig. 452. 
The gasoline is fed into 
the reservoir by a pump 
(Figs. 453 and 454) which 
takes the fuel from the 
base of the engine and 
forces it up through the 
feed pipe A, the excess 
returning to the  fuel- 
tank through the overflow- 
pipe 2. The pump is 
operated constantly by the 
reducing gear on the side 
of the engine. It may also 
be operated by hand. The 
gasoline in the reservoir 
is kept at a constant level, Fic. 454. Sectional view of a fuel-pump

eighth of an inch below A, plunger; 2, pipe from fuel-tank; C, pipe to 
carburetor the channel leading to the 
inlet valve, this height making it impossible, of course, for the 
fuel to be forced into the cylinder by the pump. On the suction 
stroke the inlet valve is opened and air is drawn into the air- 
inlet pipe C. This air rushes with considerable velocity past 
the mouth of the channel tube D and draws in a charge of 
gasoline, the amount depending upon the size of the opening at 
the point of the needle valve £.   
 
-P-A-G-E-452
  440 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
In the air-inlet pipe there is usually an air-valve, or damper. 
This is closed while the engine is in process of starting, to 
insure a richer mixture being taken into the cylinder. On the 
first two or three explosions 
it is opened and left open. 
In the absence of the valve 
the fingers may be placed 
over the end of the pipe. 
The milled head on the end 
of the needle valve is usually 
marked in some manner for 
a starting position and for a 
running position. More fuel 
is admitted while starting than 
is needed for continued opera- 
tion. As the point of the needle becomes worn the markings will 
not be true, and the operator must use his judgment in setting it. 
The gravityfeed carburetor is essentially the same in general 
construction as the pump-feed carburetor. Since the gasoline is 
fed to the reservoir by gravity, 
some device must be provided 
which will feed the fuel down as 
it is needed. Some form of float 
valve is used for this purpose, 
a general type being shown in 
Fig. 455. When the gasoline in 
the carburetor chamber has reached 
the proper level, the float rises and 
closes the inlet pipe. As fuel is 
drawn from the chamber into the 
cylinder the float is lowered and 
more gasoline is admitted through 
the inlet, a constant level thus ‘To fuel-tank in base i i “ c of engine 
being automatically maintained. 
The saction-feed carburetor, a 
type of which is shown in Fig. 456, is essentially the same as 
the types above mentioned, except that the fuel is drawn from 
the fuel-tank by suction through the fuel-pipe. A ball check Gasoline-inlet from

valve is placed in the fuel-pipe, so that the fuel is kept close to 
the channel tube. This type of carburetor is often called a mixer. 
A comparison of these three types shows that the last is the 
simplest, there being no pump and no float valve. It is, however, 
very easy to flood the cylinder of an engine using this type of 
carburetor unless the needle valve is carefully adjusted. The 
gravity-feed carburetor is satisfactory. One objection may be 
urged against it, however — the objection that, since the supply 
tank is above the carburetor, the development of a leak may 
drain the tank, with dangerous results. There is perhaps less 
danger of flooding the cylinder of the engine with the pump-feed 
type, and it gives excellent satis- 
faction. Of course the gasoline 
pump may wear out and give 
trouble, but it is very simple, 
and little difficulty comes from 
this source.

gine a priming cup is attached n¢ Piston ring is removed. Note the oil ‘ y grooves in the piston 
to the cylinder, for pouring fuel 
into the cylinder, so that a complete charge is assured. For 
small engines a teaspoonful is sufficient; too much is worse 
than not enough. 
Compression. With a proper charge of fuel in the cylinder ade- 
quate compression is necessary before the gases can be ignited ; 
it is necessary, at least, before they will explode with the highest 
efficiency. To secure this compression an air-tight chamber is 
essential. The piston is a solid piece of metal, working in the 
cylinder. Even though each is ground and polished to an exact 
sliding fit, the great changes in temperature inside the cylinder 
make it impossible to maintain this fit. Consequently the piston 
is made to slip rather loosely into the cylinder, and piston rings 
are supplied to make the fit gas-tight. A piston with piston rings 
is shown in Fig. 457. Grooves are cut in the piston — usually 
three or four in the smaller engines, more in the larger ones — 
near the head end, into which are fitted the piston rings. As 
shown, these rings are not solid, but are cut so that they spring 
out against the cylinder, making a gas-tight fit. In some engines 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  442 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
the rings are fixed so that they cannot turn in the grooves, the 
joints being broken. In others they are left free to turn. This 
is some advantage, for while it is possible for all joints to work 
round to the same position‘and cause leakage, the rings will foul 
less if left free to move. They should fit freely in their grooves 
and should be easily turned about with the fingers. 
The compression should be such that it is quite difficult to 
turn the engine over, when starting it, without releasing the com- 
pression in some way, and the piston should rebound with ease 
when it is forced up against the cushion of air in the chamber. 
If there is almost no compression, it is useless to attempt to 
start the engine until the fault is remedied. Poor compression 
may be due to any one of a number of causes: (1) The piston 
rings may be sticking. It frequently happens that the rings will 
stick until the engine warms up, when proper compression will 
be secured. If the compression is not enough to secure an ex- 
plosion, a pint of kerosene may be poured into the cylinder and 
the engine turned over by hand several times. If this does not 
loosen the rings, it may be necessary to remove the piston. They 
will frequently be found so completely gummed with oil and car- 
bon deposit as to make it necessary to use a chisel to loosen them. 
(2) The valves may leak. This may be due to the sticking of 
a valve stem because of lack of oil or because of a deposit of 
gummy oil about the stem. More frequently it is due to faulty 
seating of the valves, particularly of the exhaust valve. (A method 
of grinding the valves will be discussed in a later paragraph.) 
(3) The cylinder may be worn out of round or grooved. In hori- 
zontal engines there is a tendency to wear both piston and cylinder 
on the lower side, a tendency which will result in blowing. The 
position of the defective spot may be detected by holding the 
hand near the inner end of the cylinder while the engine is run- 
ning. In unusual cases the cylinder wall may be grooved, as by 
a projecting piston pin. Remedy in either case can be had only 
by reboring the cylinder. 
Ignition. After the charge has been properly compressed it is 
necessary to ignite the gas, so that through its expansive power 
it may drive the piston through the one working stroke of the 
cycle, Without question, about 90 per cent of all the troubles

the make-and-break and the

The make-and-break system 
of ignition is the simpler of 
the two. Fig. 458 shows the 
igniter block for this system. 
This block fits into the combustion-chamber and contains the 
movable electrode and the stationary, insulated electrode. 
insulation on the latter is usually composed 
of thin mica washers wrapped around by 
thin layers of the same material, which dis- 
connects it electrically from the engine 
bed. The igniter trip on the valve rod / 
(Fig. 438) lifts the dog on the movable 
electrode during the compression stroke 
and brings the two points within the cylin- 
der into contact. At the proper point in 
the stroke the dog is released, and a spring 
quickly separates the points. These con- 
tact points are made of a hard composition 
metal to stand the wear and the high heat 
caused by the passing of the spark. These 
points must fit smoothly and snugly to- 
gether. In time they become pitted ‘and 
rough, when they should be filed or 
smoothed with emery cloth.

cell serves as the container for the other materials, A stick of
-P-A-G-E-456
  444 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
carbon occupies the center of the cup and forms the negative 
element. Around the carbon is packed a filler (usually granulated 
carbon containing a good carrier of oxygen), called the depolarizer. 
Manganese dioxide is sometimes used for this purpose. The filler 
is then saturated with some solution, usually sal ammoniac, which 
serves as the electro- 
lyte. Both top and 
bottom of the cell are 
covered with a layer 
of pitch to protect the 
contents. 
As soon as the elec- 
Fic. 460. Dry cells connected in series trolyte comes in con- 
tact with the zinc, 
chemical action takes place, and the solution is broken up into two 
parts. The part containing the hydrogen is positively charged 
and carries its current to the carbon stick; the negative portion 
combines with the zinc and charges it negatively. If the two 
poles are now connected outside the cell, as by a wire, a current 
of electricity will pass from the positive, or carbon, pole to the 
negative, or zinc, pole. 
Certain electrical units are used to measure the flow of this 
current. The amount of flow is measured in amperes, and the 
force causing the flow is measured in volts. The phenomenon is 
analogous to the flow of water. If a tank several feet in height 
is filled with water and __-- 2 
this water is drawn off RT BS 
through a faucet at the 
bottom, the flow could 
be measured in gallons 
per minute, while the 
pressure causing the 
flow could be measured in pounds per square inch. Amperes, 
then, correspond to the flow of water in gallons, and volts to the 
pressure in pounds, 
A new cell should show an amperage of from 25 to 30 anda 
voltage of about 1}. When the amperage falls to 8, the cell 
should be discarded. This simple description of the construction 
     
Fic. 461. Dry cells connected in parallel
-P-A-G-E-457
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 445 
of a dry cell will serve to make clear some points in regard to 
its use and care. If the cells get wet, the electrolyte is weakened 
and chemical action ceases. If they are kept in a very warm, 
dry place, the electrolyte evaporates and the cell is ruined. 
If the poles of the dry cell are connected continuously for an 
hour or so, action ceases and the cell is dead. It will revive 
to some extent on standing, but this type of cell is intended to 
be used only on open circuits ; that is, those in which the external 
circuit is completed for but a short time and then broken, as 
in gas-engine ignition. It 
is essential, therefore, that 
the engine should not 
be stopped in a position 
that would complete the 
circuit. A dead cell may 
sometimes be revived suf- 
ficiently to give some serv- 
ice, by puncturing the 
zinc cup or the top layer 
of pitch and soaking it in 
salt water for a few hours. 
The service, at best, how- 
ever, will be short. 
The cells, as shown in Fig. 460, are connected in series; that 
is, the wiring is taken from the positive pole of one cell to the 
negative pole of the next. When they are connected in this 
way, the voltage of the battery is equal to the combined voltage of 
the single cells, while the amperage of the battery is equal to the 
amperage of a single cell only. If the cells were connected in 
parallel, that is, with like poles connected, as in Fig. 461, the 
amperage of the battery would be equal to the combined amper- 
age of the single cells, while the voltage of the battery would be 
equal to the voltage of a single cell. Since it is high voltage that 
is required in gas-engine ignition, the cells are always connected 
in series. 
The simple spark-coil is included in the ‘circuit to increase 
further the voltage of the battery. Its construction is shown in 
Fig. 462. Some insulating-material is first wrapped around a        
        Fic. 462. Construction of a simple spark-coil

core of soft-iron wires ; around this is then wrapped a great many 
turns of fine insulated copper wire. The action of the coil de- 
pends upon the principle that when the circuit is broken there is 
a tendency for the current to keep on flowing, with the result 
that an arc is drawn between the separating points, giving a 
decidedly hot spark. 
The operation of the make-and-break system is as follows: The 
wiring, as shown in Fig. 463, is taken from the insulated electrode 
to the switch; thence through the spark-coil and the battery to 
the engine bed. The wire leading to the engine bed is frequently 
called the ground wire. If, when the switch is closed, the points

begins to flow. Now, if 
the points are quickly 
separated, a long spark is 
drawn across the gap, the 
sparking taking place only 
Eee Testa een cere a rake kel eg OR and-break system of ignition cuit. There should be 
one big blue spark. If a 
shower of smaller, red sparks appears, either the battery is weak, 
the contact is imperfect, or the wiring connections are loose. The 
more rapidly the break is made between the igniter points the 
hotter will be the spark. 
It is evident that this system, from the electrical point of view, 
is very simple. There are only two wires to contend with, and 
no one need err in connecting these to their proper places. The 
chief difficulty lies in the fact that there is a moving part pierc- 
ing the wall of the combustion-chamber. It is also necessary 
to keep the insulated electrode from electrical contact with the 
engine —a thing that is not easily done. The insulating-material 
will frequently become covered with carbon, in which case it is 
necessary to remove the plug and carefully clean it; it should never 
be removed unless absolutely necessary. Under all conditions of 
operation for low-speed engines, however, this system is very.    Coil
-P-A-G-E-459
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 447 
satisfactory. It will undoubtedly stand more abuse than the jump- 
spark system and will give a hotter spark under adverse conditions. 
There are a few modified forms of the make-and-break system, 
one, shown in Fig. 464, is called the w7pe-spark system, because 
the electrode points inside the cylinder have a wiping action, one 
passing across the other. The advantage of this is that the points 
by their wiping action keep themselves clean. A cam device out- 
side the cylinder revolves the movable electrode. The hammer 
make-and-break differs from the simple make-and-break in that 
the movable electrode is struck by a trip hammer just as the 
spark is wanted; the 
points, therefore, are 
separated more quickly 
than in the simpler 
type, and the result is 
a hotter spark. 
The jump-spark sys- 
tem of ignition is radi- 
cally different from the 
make-and-break system. 
The spark-plug shown 
in section in Fig. 465 
has no moving parts. 
The plug screws into

  of the engine. The pin 
running through the center of the plug, with the screw for attach- 
ing this battery wire on its outer end, is the insulated electrode. 
The other pin inside the combustion-chamber is a part of the 
outer shell of the plug and hence in electrical contact with the 
engine bed. The ends of the two pins are separated about one 
thirty-second of an inch. 
The battery is made up of the usual dry cells and an induction 
coil. The construction of this coil is shown in Fig. 466. It will 
be seen that it contains a primary coil similar to the simple coil 
used in the make-and-break system of ignition, although the core 
is smaller and made up of finer wires. Around this coil is 
wrapped some insulating-material, around which are several

of which terminate in the secondary poles. The 
induction coil, then, as shown, has two primary 
and two secondary poles. On the end of the 
coil-box is the vibrator, or buzzer, the short 
steel spring of which is shown fastened at one 
end. On the free end is a disk of steel held 
directly above the core of the primary coil and 
a short distance from it. 
In wiring this system of ignition the primary 
wiring must be taken, as shown in Fig. 467, 
through the battery, the primary poles of the in- 
duction coil, the circuit-breaker, and the switch. 
A wire is then taken from the spark-plug to 
one of the secondary poles, the other pole being 
connected to the engine bed or grounded. 
The oferation, then, is as follows: the switch 
is closed and the engine turned over until the 
timer completes the primary circuit. The vibra- 
tor should then begin to buzz. This buzzing 
is due to the fact that as soon as the primary circuit is closed 
the current be- 
gins to flow 
through the 
primary wires, 
the core is mag- 
netized, and 
the steel disk 
is drawn down 
to the core.

completed, the current begins to flow, the core is magnetized, and 
the same action is repeated again and again at a very rapid rate. 
There is a screw for adjusting the tension of the spring holding 
the steel disk, by which the frequency of vibration of the spring 
may be varied. This 
should be adjusted 
until the buzzer gives 
forth a snappy sound. 
The screw may be 
turned in so far as to 
hold the disk down 
on the core constantly, 
or it may permit the 
disk to move so far 
away that the core 
when magnetized can- 
not draw it down. In 
either case the buzzer 
will not work, 
Sparking at the 
vibrator points will 
frequently be noticed. 
Hence coils are usually 
supplied with a con-

as a sort of reservoir 
into which the excess 
current may flow, and 
thus decreases the ten-

by the separation of the vibrator points. This condenser is made 
up of a number of sheets of tin foil insulated from each other, 
alternate sheets being connected to one another and the two poles 
connected to the primary circuit through the parts of the vibrator. 
The condenser never completely eliminates sparking, however. 
It is shown in the top of the coil (Fig. 466, X).  
-P-A-G-E-462
  450 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The current flowing through the primary coil induces a current 
in the secondary coil. Through this process of induction the 
voltage is greatly multiplied, the amount being directly propor- 
tional to the number of turns in the two windings ; and the force 
of the current is great enough to cause it to jump the gap be- 
tween the points of the spark-plug, giving a complete circuit from 
one secondary pole through the plug into the engine bed and 
back to the other pole. A series of sparks is secured between 
the points of the plug, one spark in reality appearing for each 
interruption in the flow of the current through the primary wires. 
This is due directly to the vibrator. 
In the wiring scheme shown there are 4 wires — 2 primaries 
and 2 secondaries. In many coils there are only 3 poles, one of 
the secondary poles being omitted. If this is the case there is 
an inside connection between one of the primary poles and the 
other end of the secondary winding. Even in coils having the 
2 secondary poles this inside connection is often made. Were 
this true of the coil shown in Fig. 467, the grounded secondary 
wire could be removed entirely, in which case the secondary cir- 
cuit would be completed through one of the primary wires. 
The jump-spark system may seem to be rather complex elec- 
trically, but it is not difficult to keep in order if the parts are 
understood. There are no moving points in the cylinder, an 
advantage over the make-and-break ; and for high-speed engines, 
that is, for engines running more than five hundred revolutions 
per minute, it is more satisfactory. The plugs are cheap and are 
easily replaced if broken. Another valuable feature is that in 
testing the spark, the plug may be taken out and laid on the 
engine; then when the circuit is made one may be absolutely 
sure that the spark passes. If the plug becomes short-circuited 
because of a deposit of carbon, as frequently happens, it should 
be removed, taken apart, and carefully cleaned. 
The term “‘/ow-tension ignition” is often applied to the make- 
and-break system, since a relatively low voltage is necessary to 
make a spark. The jump-spark system is often styled Aigh-tension 
ignition, since a relatively high voltage is required. 
Sources of current. Thus far the dry cell has been the only 
source of current mentioned, and in it the electrical energy is the
-P-A-G-E-463
  
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 451 
result of chemical action between the elements of the cell. There 
are several other possible sources of current in which the energy 
is supplied through mechanical means. 
The magneto is a form of generator now commonly used. 
Only the simpler features of the generation of electrical energy 
through mechanical means will be discussed. It is commonly 
known that if a loop of wire is rotated between the poles of a 
permanent magnet, a current of electricity will flow through the 
wire. An instrument for measuring the intensity and the direction 
of the current 
would show 
that the direc- 
tion is once re- 
versed during 
each _ revolu- 
tion and twice 
registers zero. 
For example, 
in Fig. 468, a, 
the loop is in 
a vertical posi- 
tion, and since 
it is cutting no lines of force, no current will result. In Fig. 468, 4, 
the loop has been turned go° to the right and in this position is 
cutting the greatest number of lines of force; hence the full in- 
tensity of the current is reached and the direction of flow is from 
B to A. In Fig. 468, ¢, the loop has passed through 180° and 
the current is again zero. In Fig. 468, d, the loop has passed 
through 270°, and the full intensity of the current is again 
reached, while the flow is from A to 2. The current, then, is zero 
in Fig. 468, a, and Fig. 468, c, and at its height in Fig. 468, 4, and 
Fig. 468, @. It flows in one direction while AB is moving down- 
ward and in the opposite direction while AZ is moving upward. 
If the current generated by this revolving loop is taken by ap- 
propriate rings and brushes through an external circuit, as shown, 
the direction and intensity will vary in this circuit just as they do in 
the revolving loop. Such a generator is known as an alternating- 
current generator, and the current as an alternating current.

If, instead of one loop, a great many loops were wound about 
a metal core and this core then rotated between the poles of a 
U-shaped magnet, a simple magneto would result. Fig. 469 
shows the outline of such a generator. As the armature revolves,

Fig. 469, C, having passed through 180°. During the second half 
of the revolution the current will reverse its direction, reaching 
its full intensity when the shaded head is down and dropping to 
zero when the original position (Fig. 469, A) is reached.
-P-A-G-E-465
  
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 453 
If the external circuit from such a magneto is carried to the 
spark-plug of an engine, it is evident that the armature must be 
so driven that the current will be at its height when the spark is 
needed. The armature therefore must be positively driven and 
properly timed. It is usually driven through a reducing gear, 
the armature making one revolution for each two revolutions of 
the flywheels. Fig. 470 shows such a connection. It would be 
possible to drive the armature only 
one fourth as fast as the flywheels, 
but this is seldom done. 
In the type just described, and 
known as a votating magneto, the 
armature is revolved continuously. It 
is necessary to revolve the armature 
through an angle of approximately 
30° only, if, after being given the 
proper initial position, it is allowed to 
return at a high speed to its original 
position. In this case a spark of the 
highest intensity will be generated, 
and if the movement is effected at 
the proper time it will be just as satis- 
factory as a complete rotation. In 
Fig. 472 is shown a magneto attached 
to the igniter block of a make-and- 
break system of ignition. The arma- F's. 471. Parts of a magneto 
ture core is attached directly to the <4 and 2, armature core; C, pole 
movable electrode. The action of the “°° yee Sree 
armature when so connected is shown 
in Fig. 474. Just as the igniter points are brought together the 
armature is turned to the position shown in Fig. 474, B. When 
the points are permitted to separate, the armature springs bring 
the armature back to its original position, shown in Fig. 474, A, 
generating an intensely hot spark just as the points separate. 
Such a type is called an oscillating magneto. 
Magnetos may be driven by means of a friction pulley on the 
flywheel of the engine. When so driven they cannot, of course, 
be positively timed to deliver the most intense spark when needed.

Because of this friction drive, generators require a spark-coil in 
the circuit. The speed of the armature is usually about two 
thousand revolutions per minute, a governor being supplied to 
draw the friction pulley away from the flywheel if the speed gets 
too high. A governor is shown in Fig. 475. If the armature 
is run at too high a speed, the generator will heat and the 
insulation of the winding is likely to be burned out. 
So far, only /ow-tension generators have been referred to, that 
is, generators which produce a low-voltage current. If such a 
generator were used with a jump-spark system of ignition, it

would be necessary to take the current through an induction coil. 
It is possible to have two windings, a primary and a secondary, 
about the armature of the generator, just as there is a primary 
and a secondary winding in an induction coil. With the con- 
denser, the circuit-breaker, and the timer included in the frame- 
work of the generator, a compact and very desirable system of 
ignition is provided which usually requires no batteries and no 
extra coils. Such a type is known as a igh-tension generator. 
A magneto should ordinarily give but little trouble. If it fails 
to ignite the charge, one should look to every other possible 
source of trouble, such as dirty electrode points, a short circuit in
-P-A-G-E-468

magneto. Never under any circumstances should one attempt to

‘The governor weights fly out and draw the drive 
wheel away from the flywheel of the engine adjust the magneto unless 
it is thoroughly understood 
or unless the company’s 
directions are carefully 
followed. The armature 
should never be removed. 
If it is, demagnetization 
follows, necessitating the 
return of the magneto to 
the makers for repairs. If 
batteries are used for any 
purpose, the circuit must 
not be carried through the 
magneto or the magneto 
will be ‘ killed.” 
In the care of the magneto one should follow the maker’s 
directions minutely. Oil should be used frequently but sparingly, 
and the brushes should be kept clean. The armature must not 
be allowed to get out of 
time, and if the oscil- 
lating types are used, 
the armature must be 
moved through the proper 
arc. With proper care a 
magneto should last for 
years. 
Another common form 
of generator is the dy-

almost the same way as 
the magneto except that 
the armature is rotated

is best. A set of dry cells which cost about 25 cents apiece will

last from one to six months. If the battery becomes short-circuited, 
it will run down in an hour or so, but under intermittent use and

  Fic. 477. A gear-driven low-tension alternating-

$8 to $15, forms an 
excellent source of cur- 
rent, and if an engine 
is used rather steadily, 
as on a hay-baler, it 
will undoubtedly pay 
to invest in one. The 
high-tension types are 
more costly, but they 
do away with the ne- 
cessity of a separate 
coil. As a rule the 
low-tension generators 
give the less trouble. 
The timing of the spark relates to the proper point in the 
compression stroke when the spark should occur. In the jump- 
spark system a special device, previously referred to as the timer, 
is provided. As explained before, this is found in connection 
with the primary circuit from the battery, and completes the 
current each second 
revolution of the fly- 
wheels. By altering 
the position of the 
timer the spark may 
be made to pass at 
different points in the 
compression stroke. 
In the make-and-

tion the timing of the 
spark is accomplished 
  A low-tension direct-current magneto 
partly dissembled 
by varying the time at which the igniter points are permitted to 
separate. This is usually done by altering the position of the 
igniter trip or the parts supporting it. A general rule is to have 
 
-P-A-G-E-470
  
458 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
the spark pass when the crank ts in advance of center about 6° for 
each one hundred revolutions of the engine. Another method is to 
advance the spark until a distinct pound is heard, and then retard 
it until pounding no longer occurs. The chief trouble with this 
method is that it requires some skill to detect the point at which 
pounding begins. The 
timer should always be 
so arranged that the 
spark may be retarded, 
or set so late as not to 
occur until the piston 
has passed center. This 
will prevent the engine 
from kicking back 
when being started. 
Improper timing is certain to result in loss of power. If the 
spark is too early, the engine will pound; the full force of the 
explosion meets the incoming piston and a distinct knocking is 
heard, This not only results in a decrease in power but puts the 
bearings to an undue strain. If the spark is too late, the full 
efficiency will not be realized from the fuel, and the engine will 
heat quickly. This is due to the fact that the gas mixture is 
not ignited at its highest compression and that when it is ignited 
it burns and generates heat throughout the stroke, imparting it to 
the cylinder walls. A very 
rich or a very lean mix- 
ture will demand a differ- 
ent timing from a normal 
mixture, since either will 
burn more slowly than the 
normal mixture and hence 
will require an earlier 
spark. An effort should 
be made, however, to secure a proper mixture instead of adjusting 
the spark to correspond to a poor mixture. 
Preignition refers to the ignition of the charge before the spark 
occurs. It may be caused by an overheated cylinder, as a result 
of which the gases are ignited before the proper compression is

reached. A small projecting point of metal in the clearance space 
of the cylinder will frequently become sufficiently hot to cause 
preignition, One may detect this occurrence by the pounding 
which usually results. 
The valves. In the average farm engine the zxlet valve is 
opened by suction. That is to say, when the piston starts on the 
suction stroke, there is a tendency to create a vacuum within the 
cylinder, and atmospheric pressure outside the cylinder forces 
the inlet open. It may be and often is, particularly in the case 
of high-speed engines, opened by mechanical means. The heavier 
spring on the exhaust valve prevents any possibility of its being 
opened on the suction stroke. 
The exhaust valve is always opened by mechanical ‘means. 
One device for accomplishing this is shown in Fig. 438. Since 
it is possible to open the exhaust valve but once for each two 
revolutions of the flywheels, a reducing gear is necessary, which 
is shown as the large gear in Fig. 438, 7. This revolves once 
every time the flywheels go around twice. On the shaft of this 
reducing gear is a cam which at the proper time raises the valve 
rod, and this, through the rocker arm, opens the exhaust. The 
detent lever which may lock this valve rod up will be discussed 
under the subject of governors. 
There is frequently some device for locking the inlet valve shut 
while the exhaust valve is open. This may be a positive lock, 
or it may be some device which increases the compression on the 
inlet-valve spring while the exhaust is open. In the absence of 
this device the inlet valve is often opened slightly during the 
exhaust of the burned gases, they rushing out with such force as 
momentarily to create a vacuum behind. In such a case fuel 
would be drawn in only to be exhausted again before being used. 
The ¢éming of the valves is important. The exhaust valve 
should open just before the end of the expansion stroke. At this 
time the expanding gases are under a pressure of from forty to 
fifty pounds per square inch, and at the opening of the exhaust 
they rush out, the cylinder being quickly freed of burned gases. 
The possibility of the piston’s being returned against pressure 
is also prevented. For farm engines the exhaust should open 
when the crank is in advance of center about 5° for each one 
   
-P-A-G-E-472
    460 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
hundred revolutions per minute. The cam which controls 
the movement of the valve rod is then of such length as to 
cause the valve to close just about at the end of the exhaust 
stroke. Some manufacturers give the very simple method of 
setting the exhaust to close at the end of the exhaust stroke. 
When so set the length of the cam is usually such as to cause 
the valve to open at the proper time for the rated speed of the 
engine. In some engines where the inlet valve is opened me- 
chanically, it is said to be 
better to open the inlet 
valve while the exhaust 
is still open, the argu- 
ment being that the new 
charge will start toward 
the exhaust-valve opening, 
following the burned gases 
which are escaping, and 
thus. serving as a sort of 
scavenger. To reap this 
benefit to the fullest extent 
the inlet valve and the 
exhaust valve should be 
Fic. 481. The valves are located on opposite separated a tangas Pos 
sides of the cylinder ble (Fig. 481). Such con- 
struction, however, is not 
common in farm engines. 
The exhaust valve frequently gives trouble because of the fact 
that it is exposed to extremely high heat. The valve stem may 
become warped so that it sticks in its cage; in this case it may 
seat too slowly or not at all. Some foreign deposit may collect on 
this valve or on the valve seat, so that leakage results. It some- 
times becomes necessary, therefore, to grind the valve to improve 
its seating, an operation which usually requires the removal of 
the cylinder head. A slot is generally provided in the valve so 
that it may be turned about on its seat by means of a screw- 
driver. A little emery dust, now conveniently furnished in the 
form of paste, is used while the valve is evenly and regularly 
turned back and forth on its seat.

The indicator diagram. The best way to understand just what 
happens within the combustion-chamber during each cycle is to 
refer to an indicator diagram such as is shown in Fig. 482. 
Such a diagram is secured by connecting a steam-engine indica- 
tor to the combustion-chamber of the engine. The device con- 
sists of a small cylinder and a piston behind which is a spring. 
Since the piston of the indicator is in close connection with the 
combustion-chamber, the force of the explosion is exerted against 
the piston, which is raised against the pressure of the spring. 
Attached to this piston through an arm, or finger, is a pencil 
point which records on a moving paper the pressure within the 
cylinder at each and 
every point of the 
stroke. On the verti-

Starting now at A, the piston moves out on its suction stroke 
AB, In the common farm engine the inlet valve is opened by 
suction, and as the piston moves outward, a part of a charge 
rushes in. Suction being thus relieved for an instant, the pres- 
sure rises nearly to that of the atmosphere, only to be reduced 
as the piston moves a little further. The suction stroke, then, 
is represented by a wavy line. At the end of the suction stroke 
the piston starts back on the compression stroke represented by 
the line BC. The pressure gradually rises to about 70 lb., a 
pressure at which the spark is ordinarily produced (point C). 
This point is reached slightly before the piston has reached the 
end of its stroke. As soon as the spark passes, the pressure 
immediately jumps from about 75 to 300 lb. per square inch, and   
 
-P-A-G-E-474
  
462 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
is represented by the line CD, The expanding gases then drive 
the piston on the outward, or expansion, stroke, the pressure 
gradually falling, as shown by the line DZ. At Z, when the 
gases are still under from 40 to 50 lb. pressure, the exhaust valve 
is opened, and the pressure drops almost to the line XY, as 
shown at ¥, the end of the stroke. The line “4 represents the 
exhaust stroke when the pressure is 
probably slightly above the atmos- 
pheric line. 
Governors. There are two systems 
of governors in common use for auto- 
matically controlling the speed of en- 
gines: (1) the hit-or-miss governor ; 
and (2) the throttling governor. 
The Ait-or-miss governor permits 
the engine to take a full charge or 
none at all. Thus the speed is con- 
trolled by preventing the engine from 
taking a charge until a full one is 
needed. The mechanism for accom- 
plishing this varies, but the principle 
: is always the same. One method is

Reference to Fig. 438 will help to sleeve on the shaft is drawn out until make this clear : : its flange catches the roller on the 
short arm of the detent lever, forcing this lever in until it locks 
the valve rod up. When this rod is up, the exhaust valve is open 
and no charge can be taken in. As soon as the speed drops, 
the governor weights will be drawn in by the springs, the sleeve 
will drop back, the exhaust valve will close, and a new charge 
will be drawn in on the next suction stroke. 
A change in the speed of a hit-or-miss-governed engine is se- 
cured in different ways. If the springs connecting the governor 
weights are tightened, a higher speed will be required to throw 
them outward. Or, as in the case with many engines, if the short 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
  
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 463 
arm of the detent is carried farther from the flange on the sleeve 
mentioned, the speed will need to be higher in order to throw the 
detent in. The latter arrangement permits of a change in speed 
while the engine is running, a feature somewhat desirable. 
The throttling governor permits the engine to take a full 
charge or any part of a charge. If the speed drops a little and 
a slight impulse is needed to bring it back to normal, a small 
portion of a full charge is admitted. The charge may be con- 
trolled as to quantity or as to quality. In the first of these cases 
the proportion of fuel and air remains the same, the amount of 
the mixture which is taken 
in being varied. In the 
second case the quality of 
the mixture is varied by 
controlling the air or the 
fuel. The former method 
is more commonly used. 
In Fig. 484 the wing valve . 
D regulates the amount 
of the mixture that is 
taken in. 
A comparison of the two Fic. 484. Sectional view of a hopper-cooled 
systems reveals the follow- engine with kerosene carburetor 
ing differences: (1) The 
hit-or-miss governor will prove the more economical in fuel, since 
similar charges are taken in and exploded under similar con- 
ditions, whereas the throttling governor, by varying the quantity 
or the quality of the mixture, alters the conditions under which 
the charge is exploded. The throttling governor may throttle 
the charge so much that it does not explode at all. (2) The 
throttling governor maintains a more steady speed, since the 
slightest charge is met by a change in fuel conditions, whereas 
the hit-or-miss governor will not permit the engine to take a 
charge until the speed has dropped low enough to demand a full 
charge. (3) The hit-or-miss governor throws a greater strain on 
the moving parts and on the bearings, because of the greater 
variation in speed. (4) The hit-or-miss-governed engine is usually 
supplied with heavier flywheels, a feature which adds considerably 
   
-P-A-G-E-476
  464 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
to the weight of the engine. When a steady speed is not essen- 
tial, the hit-or-miss governor is generally to be preferred. For the 
operation of electric generators, for example, where the lights are 
run directly from the generator, the throttling-governed engine 
will prove the more satisfactory. 
Cooling systems. There is a vast amount of heat generated 
within the cylinder of the engine, the temperature at the time 
of the explosion rising to approximately 2000° F., the melting 
point of cast iron. A relatively small amount of this total heat 
energy is converted into useful work — probably, as an average, 
  
    
Fic. 485. A vertical air-cooled engine 
The large tank is used to equalize the pressure when gas is used as fuel 
from 15 to 20 per cent; the remainder is carried off through the 
exhaust and through the cylinder walls. If the walls were not 
cooled in some way, they would soon become so hot that lubrica- 
tion would be impossible, the piston would stick, and the engine be 
ruined, There are two general methods used in cooling gas-engine 
cylinders: (1) cooling with air and (2) cooling with water or oil. 
Air cooling is confined to small-sized engines that are worked in- 
termittently. Fig. 485 shows the usual form. A fan is generally 
provided to assist in the circulation of air. For an engine used for 
pumping water or for other outdoor work where it must be exposed 
to freezing weather, this system has its greatest advantage ; it is 
scarcely efficient, however, for engines larger than five horse power.

Water-cooled engines are far more common than any other 
type. As is seen in Fig. 486, the walls of the cylinder are hol- 
low, and through this space water is circulated by different means. 
In some engines, as that shown in Fig. 487, the water circulates 
by gravity. This system is effective, but usually requires a large 
amount of water, a requirement which is a disadvantage if the 
tank must be drained in cold weather. 
Fig. 488 shows a water cooling system in which the water is 
circulated by a pump. This system uses a small amount of water, 
  
    
Fic. 488. A vertical water-cooled engine 
The water is circulated by a plunger pump. The screen above the tank is for cooling 
the water; with such a cooler only a small amount of water is required 
and in order that this may be kept cool it is distributed over the 
screen. This is one of the most satisfactory systems now in use. 
Of course the pump may get out of order, but there is little 
trouble from this source. 
A hopper-cooled engine is shown in Fig. 489. This type has 
the advantage of requiring a small amount of water and of need- 
ing no circulating-device whatever. The water, however, soon be- 
comes very hot, and while there is no great danger to the cylinder 
if water is always present, it is possible for the cylinder to become
-P-A-G-E-479
  GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 467 
too hot under continued use. It will often be noticed that lubri- 
cation is difficult in the hopper-cooled engine —a sign that the 
cylinder is not effectively cooled. Oil instead of water is some- 
times used for cooling the cylinder, its use being largely confined 
to very cold climates, where it is necessary to eliminate the danger 
of freezing. 
The temperature of the cooling water should be about 180° F. 
It is not advisable to keep it lower than this even when possible, 
since an engine runs better when the working parts are warm. 
Whatever system is used, it should always be possible to drain 
the jacket separately from 
the tank, if there is a tank. 
Often a temperature that 
would be low enough to 
burst the cylinder if the 
jacket were left full of 
water would only freeze the 
water in the tank slightly. 
Antifreezing mixtures 
may be used with con- 
siderable success when the 
engine is exposed to freez- 
ing weather. A solution 
of wood alcohol in water 
makes one of the best 
mixtures, particularly for 
a hopper-cooled engine or where the amount of water used is 
small. The alcohol evaporates rapidly when the water is hot, how- 
ever, making the mixture rather expensive. The following propor- 
tions are recommended for the stated temperatures : a 10 per cent 
solution for 25° F., a 20 per cent solution for 15° F., a 30 per 
cent solution for 0° F., a 35 per cent solution for — 10° F. 
Commercial calcium chloride dissolved in the water at the rate 
of 3} or 4 lb. to the gallon will prevent water from freezing until 
the temperature drops to — 20° F.; for ordinary temperatures 
2} Ib. per gallon of water is sufficient. This material, however, has 
a tendency to corrode iron and, in time, to form a scale on the 
jacket walls. This condition is not serious, but it is not desirable.

A 30 per cent solution of glycerin and water will not freeze until 
the temperature drops to about 10° F., but the solution is rather ex- 
pensive and is, therefore, not practicable for use in farm engines. 
Lubrication. The proper lubrication of a gasoline engine should 
be carefully attended to at all times. The piston is of course the 
most difficult part to keep well oiled. The oil used should be 
good cylinder oil, since this has a high flash point; that is, it 
will not burn or char at the ordinary temperatures which these 
parts are likely to 
reach. Common ma- 
chine oil should never 
be used in the cylin- 
der; it burns at too 
low a temperature and 
it contains impurities 
which foul the cylin- 
der and piston parts. 
In vertical engines 
the splash system of 
lubrication is quite 
generally used. The 
crank-case contains 
only enough oil to

Note the 2 oil-cups—one for lubricating the piston, the 
F other for the connecting-rod at the crank end 
  jecting parts on the 
connecting-rod just to 
dip into the oil. The rapid motion of the crank churns the oil into 
a fine spray. From this source the piston (in part at least), the wrist 
pin, the crank, and the main bearings are wholly or partly lubricated. 
The piston is usually provided with a sight-feed oil-cup to lubri- 
cate the upper part, including the piston rings. The shaft bearings 
usually have hard oilers to take care of the outer portions of the 
bearings. Other minor bearings are oiled by the common hand can. 
In horizontal engines the piston is lubricated entirely by a 
sight-feed cup. There is usually a hole through the upper part of 
the piston leading to the wrist pin. The crank pin is lubricated 
by different methods, all of which require more or less constant
-P-A-G-E-481
GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 469 
attention. It will be seen that the vertical engine possesses a 
distinct advantage in respect to lubrication, as all of the more 
important parts are reasonably assured of lubrication unless the 
operator is unnecessarily careless. 
Vertical and horizontal engines. The question is certain to arise 
as to whether one ought to purchase a vertical or a horizontal 
engine. There are several things to be considered. The vertical 
engine has the following advantages and disadvantages, as com- 
pared with the horizontal engine: (1) it occupies less space on 
the floor; (2) it is more easily lubricated, since the splash system 
may be used; (3) the piston wears evenly all around; (6) it is 
difficult to hold the engine on a foundation unless it is securely 
fastened. The horizontal engine has the following characteristics 
in comparison with the vertical engine: (1) all parts are easily 
accessible ; (2) it occupies more floor space; (3) the piston wears 
out of round; (4) the engine is not so easily lubricated. When 
everything is considered, the vertical type seems to be most in 
favor for the smaller engines. 
The power of engines. A gasoline or oil engine derives its 
power from the combustion of fuel inside the cylinder. Accord- 
ing to a previous statement only from 15 to 25 per cent of the 
energy so derived is converted into useful work. The power 
within the cylinder, then, is quite different from the power 
delivered at the belt wheel, and this fact gives rise to different 
kinds of horse power. 
Indicated horse power, or cylinder horse power, of engines is 
the power actually developed within the combustion-chamber of 
the engine. Although it is not expected that students using this 
book will have occasion to determine the indicated horse power of 
engines, the formula for obtaining it is as follows : 
LAN Indicated horse power = 7 5 33000 
in which ; P=mean effective pressure on piston in 
pounds per square inch, 
L=length of stroke, in feet, 
A =area of piston, in square inches, 
V= number of explosions per minute.
-P-A-G-E-482
470 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
The brake horse power of an engine is the power which the en- 
gine will deliver at the belt. It is obtained by the use of the Prony 
brake, the formula being 
arx Lx NxP Brake horse power = ——__— ; 33000 
in which £=length of brake arm, in feet (Fig. 491), 
N= revolutions per minute, 
P= net weight on scales. 
A common type of Prony brake is shown in Fig. 491. The 
brake is placed on the belt pulley or on the flywheel of the 
engine, with the arm resting upon the platform scale as shown. 
A brake test may be made as follows: After placing the brake 
ate in position, as shown, 
with the nuts perfectly 
: loose, the engine is 
pesiess h turned slowly and at 
uniform speed, first 
in one direction and 
then in the other ; the 
weights are recorded, 
and the mean weight, 
which represents the weight of the brake, is secured. After the 
engine has been started, the wing nuts are tightened, thus in- 
creasing the friction and hence the load on the engine. As the 
load is increased the scalebeam is kept constant, and the wing 
nuts manipulated in such a way as to keep the scalebeam bal- 
anced. While the load is being thus kept constant, the revolu- 
tions of the engine per minute are determined. All the data will 
then be at hand for the solution of the equation for brake horse 
power (B.H.P.). The solution would be as follows, assuming the 
following data : 
Ley ft, 
N= 500, 
W = 10 = weight of brake, 
P!' = 30= gross weight on scales, in pounds, 
P= 30—10=20.

If the brake is to run for a considerable length of time, it is 
necessary to provide some method for cooling the belt pulley. 
The oil-cup is provided to prevent sticking and to keep down the 
temperature, but this is not sufficient for long tests. If the pulley 
is provided with rims or if wood rims are temporarily attached, 
a little water may be kept in the pulley and the temperature kept 
down so that the brake will not stick. 
The approximate horse power of an engine may be determined 
if the diameter and stroke of the piston are known. This can 
only be approximate, however, since fuel conditions vary greatly. 
in aes _DPKXLxN. pproximate horse power =—— Eeo5—; 
in which D = diameter of piston, in inches, 
£=length of stroke, in inches, 
WV= revolutions per minute. 
If an engine, for example, has a 6 x 8 piston (that is, a piston 
6 in. in diameter with an 8-inch stroke) and runs at the rate of 
500 revolutions per minute, the formula will apply as follows : 
6? x 8 x 500 
T6600 078 Approximate horse power = 
This formula applies to 4-stroke single-cylinder engines only. 
Since a 2-stroke engine will deliver from one and one-third to 
one and one-half times as much power as a 4-stroke engine having 
the same bore and stroke, the following formula may be applied 
to such engines : .

Approximate horse power = 
Applying this formula to a 6 x 8 engine, as used above, 
‘Ai ore _ 6X8 X 500 | pproximate horse power = arOoma s 11.52. 
The rated horse power of an engine is the size of the engine 
in terms of horse power as fixed by the manufacturer. It corre- 
sponds closely with the brake horse power. Some manufacturers, 
however, rate their engines low so that they will always deliver 
the power claimed even when working under adverse conditions, 
and so that they will show up well in comparative tests, Others
-P-A-G-E-484
  
472 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
rate their engines so high that they will scarcely pull the full 
load under the most favorable conditions. With reasonable con- 
ditions obtaining, however, nearly all engines will develop their 
full rated horse power. 
Engine troubles. When one is examining an engine that is 
giving trouble, some definite plan or system should be followed. 
It is useless to crank an engine until one is worn out in a vain 
effort to get it started ; if 
every part is in working 
condition, it should start 
with but little cranking. 
Carrying out the order of 
discussion in this chapter, 
the following plan for the 
examination of such an 
engine is recommended : 
(1) The fuel supply 
should be examined. 
There must be good fuel 
in the tank. Of course it 
is useless to try to start 
an engine without fuel in 
the tank, but this is fre- 
quently done. Water may 
have become mixed with 
Fic. 492. An engine connected by gears to a the fuel. By pouring 2. 
pumping-jack few drops into the hand 
and noting the rate of 
evaporation, one may detect the presence of water. The gasoline 
should be strained through a chamois skin to remove water. One 
should make certain, too, that the gasoline pipes leading to the 
carburetor are not obstructed and that the fuel is supplied in 
proper quantity. If a pump-feed carburetor is used, the action of 
the pump is frequently faulty and fuel is not supplied regularly. 
A speck of dirt in the needle-valve tube will prevent the fuel 
from entering the cylinder. 
(2) The compression should be tested. Refer to the discussion 
on this subject for reasons and remedies for poor compression. 
     
-P-A-G-E-485
  
  GASOLINE AND OIL ENGINES 473 
(3) The ignition system should next be thoroughly tested. Ifa 
make-and-break system with dry cells is used, the wire attached to 
the insulated plug may be taken off; then, with the switch closed, 
if the wire is snapped across some clean metal part of the engine 
bed, a good spark should be obtained. If no spark is obtained 
the cells are too weak or the connection poor. After battery and 
connections are tested, the free wire should be snapped across the 
insulated electrode, care being taken that the igniter points inside 
the cylinder are not touch- 
ing. Ifa spark is obtained, 
it proves that the insula- 
tion is broken ; if no spark 
results, this electrode is 
properly insulated. This 
having been tried, the 
igniter points should be 
brought together by rais- 
ing the dog on the mov- 
able electrode. If a spark 
results, the points are in 
proper contact ; if no spark 
is obtained, the points do 
not touch or the contact 
is imperfect. The igniter i 
block should then be re- Fie. 493. An air-cooled engine attached to a

made to form a perfect This is one of the economical uses to which an engine may be put contact. If rough, they 
should be carefully smoothed with emery paper or a fine file. 
If a jump-spark system of ignition is used with dry cells as a 
source of current, the cells and primary circuit should first be 
tested. After closing the switch, the vibrator on the coil should 
operate when the circuit is completed by the timer. The vibra- 
tor should respond with a snappy sound. If the response is slow 
and weak the vibrator screw should be adjusted. If there is no 
improvement, while the trouble may come from a faulty coil, it 
will usually be found that the cells are weak or the connections 
poor, and the proper remedy should be applied, 
 
-P-A-G-E-486
  
474 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
After the primary circuit is found to be properly adjusted, the 
spark plug should be removed and, with the wire connected, laid 
on the engine bed. The engine should then be turned over until 
the timer makes contact. If no sparks appear at the electrode 
points, the gap may be too wide, the points may be touching, or 
the plug may be short-circuited. The remedy is to clean the plug 
thoroughly with gasoline and adjust the points. For remedy- 
ing imperfect working of the magneto, the reader is referred 
to the discussion under that subject. After a spark of proper 
intensity is secured it should be correctly timed according to 
directions previously given. 
(4) The valves should next be properly timed according to 
directions previously given. 
(5) The engine should be generally gone over to see that all 
bolts and nuts are tight, that all bearings are properly adjusted, 
that oil-cups and grease-cups are filled, and that the cooling 
system is in proper order. 
Miscellaneous engine troubles. If an engine is in more or 
less constant operation but does not seem to be working perfectly, 
there are certain indications of troubles which a trained eye or 
ear will discover and remedy without a careful and systematic 
survey of the whole engine. The following are some of the more 
common troubles. 
Back-firing is usually caused by too lean a mixture. The charge 
is too weak to explode, but burns slowly; the following charge 
enters and, coming in contact with this slow-burning mixture, 
explodes while the inlet is open. A leaking inlet valve may cause 
back-firing. 
An explosion in the exhaust is due to the ignition of an accu- 
mulation of unburned fuel in the exhaust pipe. This fuel accu- 
mulates when so rich a mixture is used that some of it is not 
burned and is driven out with the exhaust. Moreover, if the engine 
fails to fire a charge, it will be exhausted before being exploded. 
Black smoke at the exhaust is caused by too rich a mixture. 
Blue smoke at the exhaust is caused by too much lubricating-oil. 
Knocking, or pounding, may be due to too early a spark, to 
loose- connections at crank pin or piston pin, or to a broken 
piston ring.

  476 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
Preignition may be caused by an overheated cylinder or by a 
small projection (as a metal part or a deposit) on the cylinder 
wall becoming heated to redness. 
Overheating is caused by overloading the engine, by failure of 
the cooling system, or by a late spark. 
Misfiring —that is, an occasional miss — may be due to a 
faulty spark, to a faulty mixture, or to faulty valve action. 
Lack of power may be due to a faulty mixture, uncertain 
ignition, poor lubrication, faulty valve action, an overheated 
engine, or poor compression. 
Farm tractors. The farm-tractor situation is just now in such 
an unsettled state of affairs that but little space will be given it 
in this book. At this time, when so many new designs, of such 
widely different types as to size, weight, and general constructive 
features, are being put before the farmer, it is almost hopeless 
to attempt to offer intelligent advice to a prospective purchaser. 
Prevailing opinion seems to favor the high-speed, multicylinder, 
light-weight tractor, weighing from 2} to 3 tons as representing 
the type that will appeal most strongly to the small farmer, that 
is, the farmer tilling from 150 to 400 A. of land. As yet the 
tractor has not been used extensively for any other field operations 
than plowing and, in a limited way, the preparing of plowed 
land for the seed. Attempts have been made to design tractors 
to be used in cultivating corn, but they have as yet to demonstrate 
their usefulness. 
There are two points of view from which the purchase of a 
tractor may be considered. It may be expected to replace a cer- 
tain number of horses on the farm or it may be purchased simply 
to provide extra power in the busy season — to take care of the 
peak load. It will seldom be found possible to dispense with any 
number of horses on the average farm because the full horse 
power must be available during the seasons of cultivation, of hay- 
ing, and of harvesting, since few of these operations are now 
performed with the tractor; it is quite possible that tractors will 
be used in an increasing way for such operations. That the 
tractor will find a place in our moderm system of agriculture 
there is no doubt. It simply remains to be seen what type will 
be found to be best suited to the average farmer,

CHAPTER XXVIII 
ROPE AND ITS USES 
Rope is used in so many different ways about the farm that 
a wider knowledge of various knots, hitches, and splices is very 
desirable. But few farmers know how to splice a rope, and yet 
scarcely a haying-season passes but that such knowledge would 
mean a saving in dollars and cents. The skill necessary to 
perform the task is easily and quickly acquired if a few simple 
  
    
Fic. 496. A forest of manila plants 
directions are carefully followed, and, once acquired, the process 
is not readily forgotten. Similarly, an awkward knot, poorly tied, 
is frequently the cause of much delay and vexation, whereas the 
proper knot for the place would give perfect satisfaction. It is 
hoped that this chapter will serve to increase the common knowl- 
edge of rope and its uses among both students and farmers. 
Material. The greater part of the rope in common use is 
made from either manila fiber or sisal fiber, Mawzla fiber is a

  478 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
product of the Philippine Islands, being produced from the manila 
plant (a plant known to the natives as abaca), which in general 
  Fic. 497. Cutting manila plants in the Philip- 
pine Islands appearance resembles the 
banana tree. The work of 
separating the pulp and 
skin of the trunk of the 
plant from the fiber is done 
entirely by hand. S¢sal 
fiber is produced in Yuca- 
tan from a plant known 
as henequen. It is culti- 
vated on a large scale, an 
acre producing an average 
of one thousand pounds 
of fiber annually. 
The manila fiber of the 
better grades is finer and 
softer and more pliable 
than sisal fiber. Sisal 
fiber, however, is the more uniform in size, length, and quality, 
and though it makes a somewhat harsher yarn, is now quite

generally used in the manufacture of binder twine, perhaps 
go per cent of our binder twine being made from this fiber. It 
is less expensive than manila fiber—- another item in its favor. 
Manila, however, is much the better fiber for the larger ropes. 
  
  Fic. 499. Drying sisal fiber 
Making the rope. In the manufacture of rope the fibers are 
first twisted into yarns. A number of yarns are then twisted in 
the opposite direction, forming a strand. Three or 4 strands — 
the number depending on whether a 3-strand or a 4-strand rope is 
desired — are then 
twisted in the oppo- 
site direction to the 
twist of the strand 
forming the rope. 
It is the opposite 
twist in each suc- 
cessive step that 
keeps the rope in its 
proper form. The 
fact that a new rope

fact that the twists in the elements of the rope do not balance 
each other. Such kinks may usually be removed by hitching 
a horse to one end of the rope and letting him drag it over a 
pasture field. 
Three-strand ropes are much more common than four-strand 
ones. The latter are used in some large sizes and may be 
made with a straight cord in the center, as shown in Fig. 500.

Strength of rope. The strength of a rope depends upon several 
things, but chiefly upon the kind and quality of fiber used. The 
load which a rope will carry may be specified as the breaking 
load or as the safe load; the former represents the load which, 
when steadily applied, will just break the rope; the latter repre- 
sents the load which the rope will safely carry without danger of 
breaking. Naturally there is a great variation between the break- 
ing load and the safe load, but the ratio between the two is 
generally taken as 6 or 7 to 1; that is, the safe load is one sixth 
or one seventh of the breaking load. The factor of safety is 
the figure which expresses this ratio, which, in the above cases, 
is 6 or 7,
-P-A-G-E-493
  
ROPE AND ITS USES 481 
An approximate rule for determining the breaking strength of 
a rope as given by Hunt & Miller is as follows: Multiply the 
square of the diameter in inches by 7200. The results of this 
tule will vary somewhat from the figures given in Table XXXII, 
but there is a reasonably close agreement. This table, in addition, 
gives other information concerning manila rope.

Terms used. As indicated above, when fibers are twisted 
together, they form a strand. Three or more strands twisted 
together form a rope. A three-strand rope is sometimes called 
a hawser. Three hawsers twisted together form a cable. The 
process of twisting the strands into a rope is called laying the 
strands. To untwist the strands is to unlay them. One complete 
passage of a strand around a rope is called a turn (Fig. 500, 4). In 
tying knots a formation such as that shown in Fig. 501, 1, is called 
an open bight, or loop; one such as that in Fig. 501, 1, a bight; 
and one such as that in Fig. 501, 1, a round turn.

The following knots are the more common ones, and some of 
the uses to which each is best adapted are mentioned. In general 
they are used to form (1) knots in the end of a rope, (2) loops” 
in the end of a rope, (3) loops between the ends of a rope. 
  Fic. 502. Whipping the end of a rope 
Whipping. While the process of whipping the end of a rope 
is not strictly a knot, it is used to prevent the end of a rope 
from untwisting and takes the place of a knot when the end 
must not be enlarged, as for passing through the eye of a pulley

Square knot. The 
square knot is prob- 
ably used more than 
any other knot for 
tying two ends of rope 
or twine together. It 
is small and_ holds 
well, but draws very 
tight, and hence is 
hard to untie. It is a good knot to use in tying binder twine. 
The knot may be tied by following Fig. 503, 1, 1, 11, and rv.

  The first step in the granny knot is the same as shown in Fig. 503, 1, 
for the square knot. In the second step end A (Fig. 504) is placed 
in front of end 4, thus forming the finished knot. This is fre- 
quently tied for the square knot, but it will not hold. 
Surgeon’s knot. This knot (Fig. 505) is tied in much the 
same manner as the square knot, the only difference being that 
in the first step the ends are wrapped twice instead of once. 
The second wrap seems to make the knot more secure.

Weaver’s knot. The weaver’s knot is generally used by weavers 
in tying yarn. It is considered by many to be a better knot for 
tying binder 
twine than the 
square knot. 
It holds  se- 
curely and is 
more easily un- 
tied than the 
square knot. 
By comparing 
Figs. 503 and 
506 it will be 
seen that it 
is very easy 
to convert the 
square knot into a weaver’s knot. The weaver’s knot is tied, how- 
ever, by a different process, Cross the ends as shown in Fig. 506, I. 
With the right-hand rope throw a loop around its own end, 
keeping above the left- 
hand rope as shown in

Figure-eight knot. 
The figure-eight knot 
is used at the end of

Bowline in a bight. It is frequently necessary to form a loop 
in the bight of a rope. For such a purpose the bowline in a 
bight is very useful. Like the bowline, it is easily untied after a 
hard pull. The process of tying the knot is as follows: Tie an 
» overhand knot in the bight, as shown in Fig, 514,1. Bend the loop 
back over the knot as shown in Fig. 514, 1. Grasp that part of 
the knot indicated at A (Fig. 514, 111) and draw up on the loop

Spanish bowline knot. The Spanish bowline knot is used 
when two loops are wanted in the middle of a rope and when 
it is necessary to pull on both ends of the rope as well as on 
the loops. To tie it, form two bights in the rope as shown in 
Fig. 515, 1. Lay A over B as in Fig. 515, 11. Grasp the two 
bights at the cross between A and # (Fig. 515, 1), and lay them 
back toward you on top of the rope (Fig. 515, 111). Pass the 
larger loops through the smaller ones from front to rear as shown 
in Fig. 515,1v. Draw up both loops as shown in Fig. 515, v.

  ROPE AND ITS USES 495 
Flemish loop. The Flemish loop is used to form a loop at the 
end of or in the middle of a rope. It will not slip and forms a 
permanent knot. The first step in the process of making it is to 
form two bights in the rope, as shown in Fig. 516, 1, and adjust as 
indicated in Fig. 516, 1 
and m1. Insert the right 
hand and grasp the rope 
as shown in Fig. 516, tv. 
Withdraw the hand, pull- 
ing the rope through the 
two bights (Fig. 516, v). 
Separate the two knots 
and draw tight as in 
Fig. 516, vi. 
Harness hitch. The har- 
ness hitch is used where 
a loop is wanted in the 
middle of a rope and when 
it is necessary to pull on 
one or both ends of the 
rope after the loop is made. 
It is accomplished by first 
forming a bight in the rope 
with the left hand as shown 
in Fig. 517,1. Then, with 
the right hand, pass the 
other end of the rope over 
the bight as shown in 
Fig. 517, u. Pass the right 
hand down through the 
bight first formed, grasp-

Slip knot and half hitch. The short end of the slip knot is 
frequently secured by giving it a half hitch around the long end 
of the rope as shown in Fig. 519. 
Tomfool’s knot. The tomfool’s knot is so called because it 
is a trick knot; and yet it has its uses. The knot forms two slip 
knots and may be used in ringing hogs, one loop being slipped 
over the hog’s upper jaw and 
the other used to untie the 
knot. To tie this knot grasp the 
rope as shown in Fig. 520, 1. 
Lay the right hand across the

there is much of a pull on one end. In the first method the 
rope is held with the left hand, and the right hand is used in 
forming first one bight and then the other, placing them over the 
post as formed. The second method can be used in a similar way 
except that the short end is passed around the post instead of 
being looped over the top.

SPLICES 
Splicing is made use of in joining the ends of rope, as well as 
in making various forms of spliced crowns, spliced eyes, etc. There 
are two general methods of splicing a rope, known as the short 
splice and the long splice. Each method has certain advantages. 
  
  
    
Nv. Vil 
Fic. 533. The short splice 
Short splice. The short splice virtually doubles the size of the 
rope, and hence can be used only where such increase does not 
interfere with the passage of the rope through pulleys. At times 
it must be used, if there is but little rope to spare, since the long 
splice shortens the rope some five or six feet. To make it, unlay 
the strands about seven turns and tie a cord about the rope as 
shown in Fig. 533,1. Bring the two ends together as shown in 
Fig. 533, 1, taking care that the strands of one end alternate with
-P-A-G-E-519
  
ROPE AND ITS USES 507 
those of the other. As the ends are brought together see that 
the strands are spread as shown in Fig. 534, 1, and not as shown 
in Fig. 534, u. After joining the ends of the rope snugly together 
tie the strands of one end as shown in Fig. 533, 11. 
A marlin spike is useful in tucking the strands. The spike 
shown in Fig. 533, 111, isa good one. For use with a ¢-inch rope 
the pin should be about 6 in. long and 7 in. in diameter at the 
large end, tapering to a point at the other end. A }-inch hole 
is then bored to a depth of about 1 in. in the larger end. The 
spike is inserted beneath a strand, and the end of the strand 
to be tucked is inserted in the hole in the spike. It is thus 
easily passed beneath the strand as the spike is forced through. 
  
  
  Fic. 534. Right (at left) and wrong position of strands for splicing 
Begin tucking as shown in Fig. 533, 11. Take any one of the 
three strands — No. 6, for example. Tuck it across the rope at 
right angles to the rope, skipping the strand immediately adja- 
cent (No. 2) and inserting it under the second one from it. Then 
take No. 4 and No. 5 in order, always skipping the strand next 
to the one being tucked. Skip one strand only and tuck each 
strand but once in its turn. Fig. 533, 1v, shows the rope with 
three strands (Nos. 4, 5, and 6) tucked once. 
In the same way tuck the other three strands (Nos. 1, 2, and 3) 
(Fig. 533, v), after removing the cord around them. Draw the 
strands up tight, making sure that there is no looseness in the 
rope where the ends are brought together. Proceeding in a simi- 
lar manner, tuck each strand three times. This completed, divide 
each of the three strands into two equal parts, untwisting the parts 
 
-P-A-G-E-520
  508 EQUIPMENT FOR FARM AND FARMSTEAD 
carefully so as not to disarrange the yarns. The three strands 
  
  Fic. 535. The long splice, initial steps to the right in 
Fig. 533, vi, have 
been thus divided. 
Tuck one of each 
pair of half strands 
exactly as the full 
strands were tucked. 
In choosing the 
half which is to be 
tucked take the half 
which will bind the 
other close to the 
rope. After tuck- 
ing the half strands 
three times each, 
cut off the remain- 
ing halves close to 
the- rope, The 
ends of the tucked 
strands should then 
be cut off about 
one-half inch from 
the rope. ~The 
rope may then be 
smoothed by roll- 
ing it under the 
foot or by pound- 
ing it as it is rolled 
back and forth over 
a floor or block. 
| After the rope has 
been pulled for 
some time the ends 
of the strands may 
be trimmed off fairly 
close to the rope;

mistake of cutting them too close, however, or they are likely to 
pull out. The finished splice is shown in Fig. 533, vil. This has 
not been rolled or pressed down in any way. 
Long splice. The long splice is used where the size of the rope 
must not be increased and where a neater and more satisfactory 
splice than the short splice is desired. The rope is shortened from 
five to six feet by — 
the process.

strands that lie 
adjacent to each 
other, as Nos. 3 
and 5. Unlay 
strand No. 3 and 
lay No. 5 in its 
place as shown in 
Fig. 535, m1. As soon as No. 3 is unlaid one turn the other 
should be immediately laid in place; that is, the one must follow 
the other up closely. The strand being laid should fit perfectly 
without much twisting. Proceed as above to within four turns of 
the end of the strand being laid. 
Next choose two (Nos. 2 and 6) of the remaining four strands, 
taking care that the other two (Nos. 4 and 1) lie adjacent to each 
other, and proceed to the right as with the first pair. This leaves   =

strands Nos. 1 and 4 at the middle, as shown in Fig. 535, 1v. 
Now cut off the ends of the long strands, leaving each strand 
about four turns long, as shown in Fig. 535, v. The pairs are 
now ready to be 
tucked. 
Before _ starting 
to tuck see that 
the strands lie in 
the position shown 
in Fig. 536, 1, and 
not as shown in 
Fig. 536, u. It is 
in the latter position 
that the strands are 
likely to be found 
at the finish of the 
laying process. The 
tucking is done in 
exactly the same 
way as in the short 
splice. Take one 
end as shown in 
Fig. 536, m1, tuck 
it over the other 
end, and draw it 
up as shown in 
Fig. 536, 1v. Next 
tuck the other end 
in a similar manner 
(Fig. 537, 1 and 11). 
Tuck each strand 
Fic. 537. The long splice (continued) three times and cut 
off one-half inch 
from the rope; the finished splice then appears as in Fig. 537, Iv. 
By rolling the tucks under the foot they may be smoothed out so 
that the rope is increased in size very little. 
Long splice for a four-strand rope. It is sometimes necessary 
to splice a 4-strand rope. If such a rope has a cord center, cut

the cord out and proceed exactly as in a 3-strand rope except that 
in starting the splice the strands should be unlaid about 20 turns. 
Then after taking one pair to the left and one to the right as 
before, leave two pairs instead of one at the middle, Fig. 538, 1. 
It is only necessary to take one pair 5 turns to the right and the

Mending broken strand. If one strand in a rope breaks, as in 
Fig. 539, 1, unlay each strand about eight turns and secure a strand 
of sufficient length from the end of the rope or from another rope 
of the same size and lay it in as shown in Fig. 539, 1. Tuck the 
ends, and the finished work will appear as in Fig. 539, 11,

ROPE AND ITS USES 513 
Spliced crown. The spliced crown is used to prevent the end 
of a rope from untwisting. It is to be preferred for this purpose 
to almost any other knot and is particularly desirable where the 
rope is used for a halter. In making the crown, unlay the strands 
about five turns. With the middle strand (No. 1) form a bight be- 
tween the other two as in Fig. 540,1. Lay No.2 across No. 1 
between the bight and No. 3 as shown in Fig. 540, 1. Pass No. 3

Fig. 540, 1v. Tuck the ends three times each, beginning as in- 
dicated in Fig. 540, v, and proceeding as directed for the short 
splice. Always tuck the strands in order; that is, tuck all of 
them once (Fig. 540, v1) before starting on the second tuck. The 
finished crown is shown in Fig. 540, vir. 
If desired after tucking the strands twice, each may be divided 
as in the short splice, the half strands being tucked once or twice,  
-P-A-G-E-526

Spliced eye. The spliced eye is used where a permanent loop 
is wanted in the end of a rope, as in fastening a halter rope to 
the halter. To make the eye, unlay the strands about four turns. 
Hold the end of the rope in the left hand and form a loop as 
shown in Fig. 541, 1, by bending the rope around towards you, and 
laying the three strands across the top of the rope. Tuck strand 
No. 1, which is the strand nearest you, under a strand on top of

the rope as shown in Fig. 541, 111, and draw the three strands 
down, making the work as smooth as possible. The last strand 
tucked will always have a long wrap, but this is not objectionable. 
The three ends are now to be tucked three times each as in 
the case of the spliced crown, the first step being shown in 
Fig. 541,1v. The finished eye is shown in Fig. 541, v, the rope as shown in Fig. 541, 1. Tuck strand No. 2 under the

ROPE AND ITS USES 515 
HALTERS: 
Rope halters as purchased on the market are usually made 
from an inferior grade of rope. A much better halter will be 
secured if a good manila rope is purchased and the halter made 
up in the proper size. As a guide to proper lengths for the 
halter parts Table XX XIII is given. A better plan is to fit the 
halter to the animal for which it is being made.

Nonadjustable halter. This is the type of halter most com- 
monly made. After cutting off the proper length of rope, shape 
the halter as shown in Fig. 542, 1, taking care to make all parts 
the proper length, and mark the points B, Z, D, and C by tying 
cord around the rope. 
Now lift a strand in the rope at D and insert the short end 
of the rope, drawing it through to form the loop as in Fig. 542, 1. 
At point X (Fig. 542, 11) raise a strand and insert the long end, 
drawing it down as shown in Fig. 542, 11. This step fixes the 
size of the loop. 
Next unlay the strands in the short end of the rope back to 
point B (Fig. 542, 1v). Now grasp the rope at B and give it two 
or three reverse twists as indicated by the arrow. This will prevent 
the headpiece from twisting when the halter is finished. Lift a” 
strand at £ and tuck strands No. 1 and No. 2 under it as shown 
in Fig. 542, v. Now pass strand No. 3 under the rope and tuck 
it up between Nos. 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 542, vi. 
Finally tuck strand No. 1 along the nosepiece, No. 2 along 
the long end, and No. 3 up the cheek piece, as shown in

The end of the halter rope may be secured by tying any one of 
the various knots suitable for that purpose, or the spliced crown 
may be used. 
Adjustable halter. The adjustable halter is a very convenient 
kind of halter to have about the barn, particularly for use on 
  
  
  Fic. 543. An adjustable rope halter 
cattle. It is not so satisfactory for a permanent halter, however, 
as the one previously described. In making it, shape the halter 
as indicated in Fig. 543,1. Notice that the nosepiece has been 
formed with the short end and tucked to form a loop on the 
right, as in the first type of halter. Form a spliced eye in the end 
(Fig. 543, 1), making the eye just a little larger than the rope. 
Slip the long end through the two loops as shown in Fig. 543, 1. 
Only the headpiece, of course, is adjustable, the nosepiece being 
fixed in length.

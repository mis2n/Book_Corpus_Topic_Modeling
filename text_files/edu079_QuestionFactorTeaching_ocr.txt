INTRODUCTION 
In college and university instruction the question, 
as a factor in teaching, is of minor importance. The 
method of instruction being largely that of the lecture, 
there is little use for the question, except as a test of 
results, after the learning process is supposed to have 
been completed. In most textbooks for the elementary 
and high schools, it has the same place and rank, fol- 
lowing the work of acquiring knowledge and merely 
testing the degree of understanding and memorization 
reached. In both cases getting knowledge means the 
getting of positive facts, and that is a task in which 
questions are not considered a necessary part. 
The rank of the question in active life is very dif- 
ferent. The situation is typically represented there 
by the arithmetical problem. No builder figures for 
the answer to a question until some situation has arisen 
that requires figuring. Answers alone, without the 
problems that called them forth, would be absurd. So 
in the field of business in general, of politics, and of 
scientific investigation, questions necessarily precede “ 
;_the e_prerequisite to all thinking; they 
supply the motive for the effort as well as the basisfor / 
the selection and-organization.of the-data.. _They-are 
t termining the value that 
shall be attached to the answer itself. —e——— — L
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi INTRODUCTION 
In the light of these facts the usual classroom pro- 
cedure in school and college is strange indeed. The 
positive facts offered there in lectures and textbooks 
are nothing more than answers to questions of some 
sort, data for the solution of problems supposed to be 
worth solving. Yet the questions themselves are over- 
looked; or, if included, they are so tardy in appearance 
that ‘they fail of what ought to be their main purpose, 
i.e., to supply motive for effort, and a basis for the 
selection and organization of data. At the same time 
the method of work in school and college, and the con- 
sequent discipline received, is valuable to the extent 
that it duplicates, and thus prepares for the method 
‘found most successful outside. That has to be the 
final basis for judging its merit. 
Here is a case of extreme misfit therefore. How is it 
explained? There are at least two facts that help to- 
ward an explanation. The truth that all good think- 
ing or studying is necessarily purposive, that it in- 
volves a problem or purpose as well as the facts wanted 
for its solution, has been little understood. Thinking 
has been thought of more as a general faculty, capable 
of application at any time to any kind of matter, with- 
out conditions. In addition, there is doubt whether 
children and even college students are commonly sup- 
posed to think. Their more commonly accepted ob- 
ject, in attending class at least, is to remember; to col- 
lect and retain facts that are answers to questions, 
perhaps, but questions that have not yet arisen; ques-

tions that may arise in some distant future. Their 
present purpose as students, in short, is storage; real 
thinking will come later, as real problems present them- 
selves. This conception of education relieves the 
teacher of any necessity of patterning classroom pro- 
cedure after the practice of the most effective thinking ’ 
outside. i 
So much for the general rank of the question as a 
factor in instruction. (What is a good question? )It is 
unfortunate that this problem has not been far more 
fully discussed. Probably it will receive proper atten- 
tion when the general significance of questions has 
come to be appreciated. Cah cies 
test of any question is found in the extent to which it ,

__ judging the character of a question. Provision for 
—jnotive is the first factor in all instruction, partly be- 
cause motive or purpose is the biggest thing in educa- 
tion, and partly because the provision for motive paves 
the way for independent thinking and exercise of ini- 
tiative on the part of the pupil. He is in a strait-jacket 
as a thinker until the reason for the effort is keenly 
elt by him.

covers, or the issue it raises, may be definite. It should 
usually be broad, too, requiring numerous data; other- 
wise ideas fail to be brought together into sufficiently 
large units, and organization is poor. And for the same 
reason any question_should belong to a series, rather

This brief and ad discussion is, perhaps, long 
and clear enough to suggest that/a large share of the 
problems in education center in the ‘question.\ 
The following work deals with the question, and for- 
tunately from the viewpoint of practice rather than 
theory. It contains such questions as the authors 
believe should be put in the teaching of certain well- 
known topics in various studies. It furnishes a con- 
crete basis for studying the general rank of the question 
in instruction, its peculiar purposes and possibilities, 
and its desirable characteristics. It suggests that lesson 
plans for teachers might consist of a few well-conceived 
questions, and that questions, rather than the answers 
to questions, might well be the first consideration of 
both teachers and pupils. It is a new treatment of 
general method, and of a kind that is very much 
needed.

  THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR 
IN TEACHING 
CHAPTER I 
THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
STORIES 
Tue term “teaching” has come to be used so loosely 
(: ‘as to include almost everything a teacher does in the 
jelassroom<In the following discussions it is used to 
\mean the stimulation of genuine constructive thinking | 
/ directed toward~a definite and desired-end. This is!* 
{ accomplished in the main by thougl{t-provoking 
\ questions. | It is rarely accomplished by telling, by 
memorizing texts, or by lecturing, followed by testing. 
This meaning is in accord with modern educational 
theory but is rarely found in practice. Memory and 
test questions dominate the whole range of classroom 
work. It is not uncommon, indeed, for teachers of 
method, even of special method, to lecture and test, 
thus violating the most fundamental principle in- 
volved. 
Unless general principles are seen in the concrete, 
it is doubtful if they are really comprehended; at least, 
it is difficult to understand how they can be of assis- 
tance to the teacher who, if she is teaching at all, must 
| be teaching something. In this book, therefore, much
-P-A-G-E-10
2 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
space is given to aseries of studies in teaching stories 
in the first five grades. The general principles involved 
in the effective use of the question must necessarily 
be involved in these lessons. It should be kept in 
mind that all statements which seem justifiable to 
make concerning the use of the question in teaching 
stories have this wider significance. 
A very important distinction is made, therefore, 
between telling stories and teaching them. Telling 
stories implies giving them outright, ready-made, to 
the children;‘while teaching a story implies its -presen- 
tation through the consideration of its successive 
problems and their solution by the pupils, the chil- 
dren themselves building the stories. -Such a distine- 
tion is“not-meant to suggest the-elimination of the 
valuable exercise of story-telling from school work, 
but that a larger part of the time now given to it 
should be used for the more stimulating exercise of 
teaching certain stories which may be adapted to this 
form of treatment. 
The difference in the mental attitude of the children 
in the two exercises is quite obvious and significant. 
In the one it is receptive and relatively passive, in 
the other it is aggressive and constructive; in the one 
the children are being entertained, in the other while 
entertaining themselves they are forcing themselves 
into the situations of the story and living it with the 
characters, developing an interest of a more active 
and profound quality. It is not the function of the
-P-A-G-E-11
  
THE QUESTION IN TEACHING STORIES 3 
school merely to entertain or to amuse the pupil. 
Each exercise should make him stronger in ability 
to work, keener in insight, and sounder in feeling. 
Children come to school expecting to work, eager to 
attack problems, and they are most deeply interested 
when doing so at the maximum of their abilities.’ Tell- 
ing the story appeals almost exclusively to the mem- 
ory, while in teaching it the appeal is made to 
comparison, inference, and the constructive powers, 
making at the same time wide drafts on the memory 
to bring to hand all data that may aid in the solution 
of its difficulties or interpretation of its situations. 
The instrument in teaching a story is the thse 
compelling question. The story is not told first and _ 
- then analyzed, dissected, and speculated about, after 
all of the most gripping situations have been nicely 
smoothed out for the child and his interest satisfied. 
good question must be based upon information or 
data that the child has and must require him to use 
the same to answer the question so as to carry for- 
ward the story. The answer to a question furnishes 
additional data for further use. A good question starts 
lines of associations in all promising directions! for 
helpful data which the child rejects or selects until the 
solution seems to him satisfactory. He then offers it 
| tentatively to the class for consideration. It should 
_ be obvious from this that a question should permit

swered. on the instant the chances are against their) 
being the result of much thinking. 
Not all stories can be taught in the sense in which 
the term is here used. It is probable that not all parts 
of any story may be taught. Indeed, it would be a 
more serious defect to question on_trivial _points a 
on points that carry the thought away. from. the main 
thread of the story, than it would be to tell a part of a 
story that Stars. an ‘opportunity for a. strong ques-; 
tion. The stories and parts of stories to be taught 
ought to be selected with some care. To be profitably 
taught the story must be reasonable, natural, or logi- 
cal. No one could with any certainty foretell a fan- 
tastic or purely fanciful sequence to an impossible 
situation. A question on such a point would lead to 
mere guessing, unconsidered answers. However, there 
are relatively few stories that do not have situations 
which suggest problems, and which, so far as using 
stories in school is concerned, might well be discussed 
in a way to carry on the story and add to the interest 
and pleasure of the children. 
After a teacher has developed some judgment and 
skill in conducting such a round-table discussion as 
this implies it will be found that the children antici- 
pate her in raising the questions and problems of the 
story with almost startling insight. The rules of pro- 
cedure and good sense necessary to’ round-table dis- 
cussion in any learned society may suffice here. The 
fact that the teacher knows the story gives rise to the

constant danger that she may dominate the discussion 
unnecessarily, and makes it important that she be on 
her guard against doing this. 
It is quite necessary that the problem or question, 
or difficulty, or thread of development, should be kept 
in mind from the beginning by the children as well 
as by the teacher to insure clean-cut thinking and 
definite progress. } It is quite necessary also that this 
problem or aim shall be recognized by the children 
as their own difficulty and indeed, in good work, will 
often be stated by, _them/ Unless the children do iden- 
(tify the problem with themselves and take a vital b 
interest in it, the statement of an aim by the teacher 
comes an empty and therefore a harmful formality.

Fe is-revieéw is a desirable climax to the dis- 
cussion. Summaries that are made in answer to a new 
problem or to a new statement of the main problem 
or from a desire to assure one’s self of the successful 
solution of the main problem as at first conceived are 
most effective.

  CHAPTER II 
‘SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 
WHENEVER would is used in the questions in these studies, 
it is assumed to mean would be likely to or do you think would. 
The extra words are omitted for the sake of brevity and 
children very quickly understand what is implied. 
Whenever in these studies the direction to read occurs, 
it means that the teacher should read to the children from 
some standard edition of the story, Longfellow’s Hiawatha, 
Stanley Waterloo’s Ab, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, Ballads 
of Robin Hood, Bryant’s translation of The Iliad, and the 
Biblical version of the story of Joseph. The reading should 
follow the children’s discussion of the problems and con- 
firm or alter their decisions. They will then easily under- 
stand the reading and at the same time will gain some appre- 
ciation of the beauty of the literary form and a desire to 
imitate it. Editions written down to the children should 
be avoided. It is very desirable that children should come 
into contact with such literary values as the directness and 
rythm of the ballads of Robin Hood, the quaintness and sim- 
plicity of Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, the spirit and force of 
The Iliad. 
RUMPELSTILTSKIN 
Once there was a miller that was very poor, but who 
had a daughter that was very beautiful. It hap- 
pened one day that he met the king. Wishing to 
make the king think he was of some importance he 
began to boast about his daughter. What would in- 
terest the king? Among other things he said she could 
spin straw into gold. What would the king say to 
that? What would he do? He took the maiden to his

SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 7 
castle, put her into a small room with a spinning 
wheel and plenty of straw, and locked the door. Why 
would he lock the door? Why would he keep the key 
himself? Why do you suppose he told her she should 
die if the straw was not spun into gold by sunrise? 
Who would deserve the punishment if she should 
fail? What would the poor maiden do? 
She was in despair and wept bitterly, when sud- 
denly the door opened and a queer little man entered. 
What would he ask her? When he heard what the 
trouble was, he said he had magic power by which 
he could spin the straw into gold if she would give him 
her bracelet. What would she do? And the dwarf? 
What would the king do the next morning? That 
night he put her into a larger room with more straw. 
What would happen that night? She gave the dwarf 
her ring: The third night the king put her into a still 
larger room and said that, if she spun all that ‘straw 
into gold, she should become his queen. What would 
happen that night? But the maiden had nothing 
more to give. What could she do? Finally the dwarf 
said that he would do the spinning if she would give 
him her first-born child when she became queen. Why 
do you think she might be willing to make such a 
promise? After the promise what would the dwarf do? 
What would happen next day? What would make the 
queen forget the promise? 
One night after a year had passed and a beautiful 
little child had been born to the king and queen, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
dwarf stepped suddenly into the queen’s chamber. 
What would he say to her? What could she do? He 
did not want gold or jewels; he wanted the child; but 
said that she could keep it if she could find out his 
name in three days. He offered her three guesses each 
night. What would she do? When he came the next 
night what would he say? What would the queen say? 
What would she do all the next day? And the next 
night? 
On the third day the queen’s messengers returned. 
One of them had crossed a high mountain and had 
come into a deep wood where the foxes and the hares 
wished themselves good-night. Here he found a tiny 
little house and saw before it a fire burning. Hopping 
round the fire on one leg was a most ridiculous looking 
little creature, who cried: — 
“To-day I brew, to-morrow I bake, 
Next morning I shall the queen’s child take; 
How glad I am that she does not dream 
That Rumpelstiltskin is my name!” 
What did the messenger know? What would he re- 
port when he reached the palace? 
What would the dwarf say the third night? Why 
would the queen ask other names first? What would 
she say for the third guess? What would you expect 
the dwarf to do? Rumpelstiltskin was so very angry 
that he just flared up and went out like a candle. 
Why do you suppose the fairies did not allow Rum- 
pelstiltskin to take the child?

HOW THE MOUSE SAVED THE LION’S LIFE 
Why would a mother mouse want her children to 
stay near the nest? What would she say to them when 
they went out to play? One little mouse kept finding 
such nice seeds and berries that he wandered far into 
the hills. There he ran up on what seemed to be a great 
log to look about him. Alas, the log turned out to be 
a sleeping lion! What would he do? What would the 
mouse say? He did not mean to disturb the lion; had 
never done him any harm and could not do him any 
harm. The mouse even said, “Spare my life, O Lion, 
and the day may come when I may help you out of 
trouble.” What would the lion say to that? Why do 
you suppose the lion let the mouse go free? What 
would the mouse say when he got home? What 
would his mother say to him? 
Some months after this, when the lion was prowl- 
ing about one night, he was caught in a strong net. 
What would he do? What effect would his struggling 
have? He was soon so entangled in the net that he 
could scarcely move. Let the children show by a 
sketch how the lion was fastened. What would he do 
then? , 
The mouse had grown so that he could roam 
through the fields and woods wherever he wished. 
How would he know that the lion was in trouble? 
What would he do? What would he say to the lion? 
Why would the lion not notice the mouse at first?
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Why should the lion keep quiet? His struggles would 
make it difficult for the mouse to work. The roaring 
of the lion might be heard by the men who set the net 
and cause them to come before the mouse could free 
him. Why would this take so much time? What had 
the mouse better do? When some of the ropes were 
gnawed in two, what effect would it have on the lion? 
What would the lion have to say when he was free? 
What had the lion learned? Tell the story that the 
mouse would tell to his grandchildren. 
THE THREE BILLY-GOATS GRUFF 
Once upon a time three billy-goats gruff, Biggest 
Billy-goat Gruff, Middle-sized Billy-goat Gruff, and 
Little Billy-goat Gruff spent their days eating the 
grass that grew on a hill. Let us find out how the 
three billy-goats gruff ran into danger and how they 
got out. 
Just across from this hill was another hill with grass 
on it. What might be between? What would be across 
the deep brook? What would happen to all the grass 
where the three billy-goats were? What would they 
think about the other hill? Which Billy-goat Gruff 
would want most to go? What would he say to the 
others? Now, Biggest Billy-goat Gruff had heard 
that a Terrible Troll lived under the bridge and that 
he would eat an entire goat at a meal. What should 
Biggest Billy-goat Gruff say to Little Billy-goat 
Gruff? 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES ll 
So several days went by until Little Billy-goat 
Gruff grew so very very hungry that he forgot all 
about the Terrible Troll; he could think of nothing but 
the sweet, fresh, green, juicy grass that grew on the 
other hill, and how it would make him so nice and 
round and fat. What would Little Billy-goat Gruff do? 
What do you suppose would happen to him? Pretty 
soon the Terrible Troll heard something going trip- 
trip, trip-trip, trip-trip over his bridge! What would 
the Terrible Troll say? What would Little Billy-goat 
Gruff have to answer? Then the Terrible Troll came 
up and said: “Little Billy-goat Gruff, I am going to 
eat you up!” Little Billy-goat Gruff had heard Mid- 
dle-sized Billy-goat Gruff say that he would have to 
go across soon to eat the sweet, fresh, green, juicy 
grass. What then could Little Billy-goat Gruff say 
to the Terrible Troll? The Terrible Troll was pleased 
at the thought of a larger goat to eat, so what would 
he say? What would Little Billy-goat Gruff then do? 
When Middle-sized Billy-goat Gruff saw Little 
Billy-goat Gruff eating the sweet, fresh, green, juicy 
grass on the other hill, what would he think? What 
would he do? What would the Terrible Troll hear? 
Trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap! What would he want 
to know? What would Middle-sized Billy-goat Gruff 
have to tell him? Then what would the Terrible Troll 
do? Just then Middle-sized Billy-goat Gruff remem- 
bered that he had heard Biggest Billy-goat Gruff say 
that he would have to go over to the other hill soon.

What then would he say to the Terrible Troll? What 
would the greedy old Terrible Troll say? What would 
Middle-sized Billy-goat Gruff do? 
When Biggest Billy-goat Gruff saw Middle-sized 
Billy-goat Gruff, and Little Billy-goat Gruff eating 
the sweet, fresh, green, juicy grass on the other hill, 
what would he think? What would he do? What 
would the Terrrible Troll hear? Trap-trap, trap-trap, 
trap-trap! What would the Terrible Troll want to 
know? What would Biggest Billy-goat Gruff say? 
What would the Terrible Troll do? But when the Ter- 
rible Troll came up, Biggest Billy-goat Gruff saw that 
he was not by any means so big nor so terrible as he 
had heard, so he gave a loud bleat, lowered his head, 
and plunged right against the middle of the Terrible 
Troll — Bim ! — and hurled him into the swift stream 
which carried him away! 
After that when any one was afraid to cross the 
bridge, what would the Biggest Billy-goat Gruff Say? 
Why had they thought the Terrible Troll was so large? 
THE STREET MUSICIANS 
There was once a donkey that, having served his 
master faithfully for many years, grew too old and 
feeble for further work. What should the master do 
about it? But the donkey heard his master say he 
would have to get rid of him. What could the donkey 
do? Thinking that he had a strong and musical voice, 
he decided to become a street-musician and at once
-P-A-G-E-21
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 18 
set out for Bremen, where he hoped to make a 
living. 
The donkey had not traveled far until he saw an old 
dog lying by the roadside and panting with weariness. 
Why would the donkey be sorry for him? What rea- 
son could a dog have for running 4way from the mas- 
ter with whom he had hunted for many years? What 
would he tell the donkey? The donkey asked the dog 
to go with him and play the drum. 
Not long after they saw an old cat sitting by the 
roadside with a face as dismal as three days of rainy 
weather. What would they say to each other? The 
donkey thought the cat would be especially good help 
at night music. 
Very soon the three passed a farmhouse in front of 
which stood a cock perched on the gate and crowing 
with all his might. He said he had overheard the cook 
say that he was to be baked the following day so he 
was crowing while he could. What would the three 
musicians say to each other? Then what would the 
donkey say to the cock? 
As they could not reach Bremen that day, they 
stopped in a wood to spend the night. Where would 
the cat and the cock sleep? The dog and the donkey? 
When the cock flew to the top of the tree he looked 
around and saw a light not far away. What would he 
say? Why would they prefer going to a farmhouse? 
Why would it be important for them to know who 
was inside? How could they find out? Why was the

donkey the first to try to look in at the window? It 
was too high for him alone. How could the dog help? 
When the dog, standing on the donkey’s head, could 
not see, the cat sprang up on the dog’s head. She 
could not quite reach. How could they manage it? 
When the cock looked in, what would the others say? 
He answered that he saw a table laden with good food 
and a band of robbers sitting around it enjoying them- 
selves. What would the musicians think of that? 
They decided to perform their music. The donkey 
brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock 
crowed so that the window rattled with the tremen- 
dous sound. What would the robbers do? When the 
robbers had fled what would the musiciahs do? After 
supper what place would each choose to sleep. The 
donkey went out into the yard, the dog behind the 
door, the cat to the warm hearth by the fireplace, and 
the cock perched himself on a high beam. 
When would the robbers stop running? What would 
they want to know? How would they find out? One 
was sent to investigate. What would he think when 
he found the house dark? He saw the glowing eyes of 
the cat on the hearth and thought they were glowing 
coals of fire. What would he do? The cat did not like 
this and was very angry. What would she do? She 
flew up, spit at him, and scratched his face. What 
would he do? What would the dog do as he passed? 
And the donkey? And the cock? The robber thought 
the cat was a witch, the dog a man with a knife, the
-P-A-G-E-23

donkey a monster with a wooden leg, and the cock a 
judge on the roof who cried, “Bring the scoundrel 
to me!” What made him think these things? What 
would he report to the other robbers? What would 
they do? 
The musicians then found themselves in such good

Hiawatha’s childhood 
His grandmother, old Nokomis, took care of him 
when he was little. Why would the grandmother take 
care of him? What kind of home would she have? 
Read: — 
“By the shores of Gitche Gumee, 
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.” 
What kind of cradle would little Hiawatha have? 
How could Nokomis make it soft and comfortable? 
When would she hang the cradle to the limb of a tree? 
Why would Hiawatha like that? When would Noko- 
mis put the cradle on her back? Why was that a good

way to carry him? What would Hiawatha like about 
it? What would there be to frighten Hiawatha? Why 
would he be afraid to cry? What would Nokomis say? 
How else might she quiet him and put him to sleep? 
Read: — 
“There the wrinkled, old Nokomis 
Ewevealn my little owlet!” 
Why did she call him “little owlet”? Why were his - 
eyes so big now? Let several children sing the lullaby 
as they think Nokomis may have sung it. The teacher 
may give some musical rendering of this. She sang 
another song some evenings. Read: — 
“Wah-wah-taysee, little ae 
Ered in Nees I lise my ry eyelidal’? 
Which is the prettier? Let the children show how it 
should be sung; then the teacher may sing it. 
What are your favorite stories? Who would tell 
Hiawatha stories? When is the best time for stories? 
Where would they spend the evening? How would it 
look all around? What sounds would they hear? The 
wind in the trees, the waves on the shore, katydids, 
frogs, owls, etc. What would Hiawatha say? What 
would Nokomis say? Read: — : 
“At the door on summer evenings, 
*Mudway-aushka!’ said the water.”

Also: — 
“When he heard the owls at — 
Talking, ecoldige at each other.” 
What would Hiawatha see as they sat before the wig- 
-wam in the evening? What would Hiawatha say 
about these things? This is the way old Nokomis 
explained to him. 
Read: — 
“Many things Nokomis taught him, 
Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.” 
Also: — 
“Saw the moon rise from the water, 
°T is her body that you see there.’ ” 
Was that true? Why would Hiawatha be pleased to 
see the rainbow? What stories do you know about the 
rainbow? What would Hiawatha say when he saw 
one? Read: — 
“Saw the rainbow in the heaven, 
Blossom in that heaven above us.” 
Why would Hiawatha learn more about the animals 
than we do? What would he know about the squirrel, 
the reindeer, the rabbit, the beaver? Read: — 
“Then the little Hiawatha 
Called them ‘Hiawatha’s Brothers.’ ” 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
18 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Hiawatha’s hunting 
Why would Hiawatha like to hunt? What animals 
would he hunt? What would he want the different 
ones for? Which would be the most difficult to find? 
Which the most dangerous when found? What ani- 
mal would he have to hunt and kill to prove his skill? 
Why should it be a deer with antlers? What must he 
have learned before he could do this? How had he 
learned it all? How would he prepare for this, his 
greatest hunt? Read: — 
“Then Iagoo, the great boaster, 
And the cord he made of deer-skin.” 
Where would Hiawatha think he could find the deer? 
Why would he need to start before daylight? How 
would the forest look in the early light? What would 
he see and hear? Why were they so bold this morning? 
Why would he not shoot any of them? Read: — 
“Then he said to Hiawatha, 
And as one in slumber walked he.” 
What would Hiawatha be thinking as he walked along? 
Would it be better for him to be at the drinking place 
before or after the deer? As he approached the ford 
would he go slower or faster? What would he do when 
he got there? What would happen if he should go 
home without the deer? What effect would this have 
on him when he saw the deer? Read: —
-P-A-G-E-27

“Hidden in the alder-bushes, 
As the deer came down the pathway.”

and Iagoo do? Read: — 
“But the heart of Hiawatha 
Hailed his ‘coming with aeplance? 
What would Nokomis do with the skin of the deer? 
With its flesh? Why would they want to make a great 
feast? What would the people say to Hiawatha? 
Read: — 
“From the red deer’s hide Nokomis 
Called him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!” 
How would they have to treat Hiawatha now? What 
more would Hiawatha have to do before he could be 
called one of the men? Not long after he had a terrible 
battle with a giant that could not be killed. 
Hiawatha’s fasting 
In what ways had Hiawatha shown that he was 
equal to the best men of his people? As a hunter? As 
a warrior? Before Indian boys were considered men, 
they all had to show that they could endure pain and

hardship by fasting seven whole days. During most 
of this time they prayed to the Great Spirit to guide 
and help them through life. Why would Hiawatha 
want to undertake this fasting now? What would he 
want the Great Spirit to help him to be? Read: — 
“You shall hear how Hiawatha 
Fon aabhilage of the national? 
What does this tell us about Hiawatha? Why should 
he pray for that? Why would the depths of the forest 
be a good place for his fasting and praying? Why 
would he need to think with great care? How would 
he prepare the place? Read: — 
“First he built a lodge for fasting, 
Seven whole days and nights he fasted.” 
What are some of the things that would be good for 
his people? For Hiawatha to be able to keep them in 
good health; for him to keep them at peace; for them 
to have plenty of food all the year. The first day Hia- 
watha walked through the woods. What would he 
see? What might happen if his people depended upon 
hunting for their food? Read: — 
“On the first day of his fasting 
‘Must our lives depend on these things?’”

would he see there? What might happen if his peo- 
ple depended upon the wild berries? Read: —

fishing for food? Read: — 
“On the third day of his fasting

The fourth day a strange young man was sent by 
the Great Spirit to make his trial harder. Why would 
the Great Spirit want to do that? This is how the 
young man looked. Read: — 
“And he saw a youth approaching, 
And his hair was soft and golden.” 
How would Hiawatha look by this time? Why would 
the Great Spirit be especially glad to answer Hia- 
watha’s prayer. Read: — 
“| ..‘O, my Hiawatha! 
For advantage of the nations.” 
Why do you suppose Hiawatha’s people were not so 
well fed in the winter as in the summer? Not so well 
in winter as the white people? Read: — 
“From the Master of Life descending, 
» Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me! 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Why did he say that to Hiawatha? Why was he going 
to make Hiawatha wrestle with him? What do you 
think of Hiawatha wrestling at the end of the fourth 
day of his fast? Why would he feel better after the 
struggle began? How did they wrestle? Read: — 
“So they wrestled there ee 
I will come again to ae you.” 
Why did Mondamin smile upon Hiawatha? What 
would Hiawatha think about before he fell alseep? 
He would wonder who the strange young man was, 
think of his beauty, his skill as a wrestler, his strength, 
and what he had said. How many evenings could 
Mondamin come? Why would the Great Spirit wait 
until the last day before he allowed Hiawatha to win? 
What time on the seventh day would Hiawatha’s fast- 
ing end? What would Nokomis do on the seventh 
day? Why do you suppose she came in the morning? 
What effect would it have on Hiawatha? What would 
he say to her? Read: — 
“On the morrow came Nokomis, 
Fearing lest his strength should fail him.” 
What would happen at sunset on the seventh day? 
Read: — 
“And behold! the young Mondamin, 
Dead he lay there in the sunset.”
-P-A-G-E-31
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 23 
This is the Indian story of the way in which corn 
came to the red man. How was Mondamin like the 
corn? How did they ever happen to make such a 
story? Why was corn a greater blessing than any other 
food they had? What, then, must Hiawatha do with 
Mondamin? Read: — 
“And victorious Hiawatha 
Soft and loose and light above him.” 
What would Hiawatha have to do all summer? 
How could he tell when Mondamin was ripe? What 
would be a good way to introduce him to his people? 
Read: — 
“And still later, when the Autumn 
This new gift of the Great Spirit.” 
In what ways would he prepare the corn for the feast 
of Mondamin? What story would Hiawatha tell his 
people at the feast? Corn was the only grain the 
white people found the Indians using when they 
came. That is the reason we call it Indian Corn. 
Hiawatha’s friends 
What had Hiawatha prayed for during his week of 
fasting? Why should Hiawatha select wise and good 
men for his very best friends? Why should he not 
select warriors for his closest friends? What effect 
would they have on Mondamin? On the happiness of 
his people? On the way other tribes would treat his

people? Among the wisest and truest men were two 
whom Hiawatha selected as friends. Why do you sup- 
pose the path between their wigwams was straight? 
Why did no grass grow upon it? Why could mischief- 
makers cause no trouble between them? What would 
they talk much about? Read: — 
“Two good friends had Hiawatha, 
How the tribes of men might prosper.” 
One friend was a great musician, Chibiabos. What 
would he sing? What effect would his different songs 
have? Of war? Of heroes? Of spring?” Of forests? 
What instruments would he make? What kind of a 
man do you think he was? How do you think he 
looked? Read: — 
“Beautiful and childlike was he, 
Stately as a deer with antlers.” 
This is the song he sang at Hiawatha’s wedding 
feast: — 
“And the gentle Chibiabos 
_ Sang in accents sweet and sie 
Onewa anes beloved! 
Why did he sing that song at the feast? 
Read (from “Hiawatha’s Friends’’): — 
“Most beloved by Hiawatha 
Softly as your orden in singing.”

And the magic of his singing.” 
Another friend was the very strong man, Kwasind. 
Let us see how Kwasind helped the people. Read: — 
“Dear, too, unto Hiawatha 
For his strength allied to goodness.” 
Why was it very important for Kwasind to be good? 
What good things could he do for all the people? For 
Hiawatha’s canoe? Read (from ‘“‘Hiawatha’s Sail- 
ing”): — 
“Then he called aloud to Kwasind 
To the bay of Taquamenaw.” 
How would Kwasind differ from other children? 
“Tdle in his youth was Kwasind, 
Much besought his guardian spirit.” 
What would he do much of his time? Why would he 
wander lonely in the meadows in summer? What 
would he do as he sat by the firebrands in winter? 
What are some of the things he might forget to do for 
his mother? What would she say to him? Read: — 
“ ‘Lazy Kwasind!’ said his mother, 
‘Go and dry them in the sunshine!’ ”

Kwasind caught Ahmeck, the King of Beavers. 
Why do you suppose that would be so very difficult? 
How do you suppose he did it? Read: —

watha like about Kwasind? What did Hiawatha like 
about Chibiabos? What are some of the things they 
would talk about together? Read: —

Some great feat of skill or strength? Some long dive? 
When one told some strange tale of mystery what 
would the old Iagoo do? What would they call him? 
The great story-teller, the great boaster. How did 
he differ from Kwasind? Why do you suppose every 
one liked the old Iagoo? Why was he welcome at 
Hiawatha’s wedding feast? Read (from the “Wed- 
ding Feast”): — 
“And Iagoo, the great boaster, 
From the Evening Star descended.” 
Hiawatha’s sailing 
Why would Hiawatha need a canoe? How could 
he make it light enough for him to carry? He knew 
that the birch bark was the best to use. What would 
be the best way to take the bark off? Hiawatha 
thought the tree could feel and think. What then 
would he say to the birch tree? Why do you think the 
birch tree would give it? Read: — 
“ *Give me of your bark, O Birch Tree’ 
Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.”

Where the Falls of Minnehaha 
Flash and gleam among the oak trees, 
Laugh and leap into the valley.”

AB 
The main parts of this story are taken from Stanley 
Waterloo’s Story of Ab with the kind permission of the pub- 
lishers, Doubleday, Page & Company. The teacher would 
find it of great assistance to have the book for reference. 
Story or THE Cavn-Man An—How 85 LIveED, 
How HE MET Many DANGERS AND OVERCAME 
Many Drericutties 
How men lived in Ab’s time 
Why do you suppose he was called a cave-man? 
What is a cave like? Use sand table with sand, 
stones, or clay; use blackboard. How large would 
the cave have to be? Where could such caves be 
found? What would you think about living in one? 
How would you make it safe? And comfortable? 
Why do you suppose Ab and his people lived in a cave? 
Why did he not live in a wigwam, like the Indians? 
What tools would he need to make a wigwam that he 
would not have to have as a cave-dweller? How long 
ago, then, did Ab live? 2 
Ab’s grandfathers, before his time, were afraid to 
live in caves. Where could they live? They were tree- 
dwellers. Even Ab often found it necessary to be a 
good climber. Why so? Why were the caves better 
than the trees after they were able to drive the wild 
animals out and keep them out? As long as Ab’s fore- 
fathers were afraid of fire and could not make it, they
-P-A-G-E-51
     
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 43 
could not have the caves nor live in them safely. Do 
you know why? All wild animals are afraid of fire. 
How could the cave-man drive the animals out of a 
cave? How could he keep them out at night? Why 
could he not fasten them out before? How have you 
ever built a fire? How did the cave-man have to do 
it? What makes you think a fire can be made that 
way? Rub your hands together. Rub two sticks to- 
gether until they are hot. Why would the cave-man 
be careful always to keep his fire going? How could 
he do this? 
What food would the cave-man have? Berries, nuts, 
roots, carrots, turnips, apples, wild cherries, rabbits, 
birds’ eggs, squirrels, deer, hogs, wild horses, wild 
cattle, etc. When could he have each? How could 
he get each? He had no implements but a few stone 
ones and no weapons but the stone spear and the 
stone axe. He could run very swiftly and throw with 
force and accuracy. What dangers would there be 
when hunting? The cave-bear, the cave-tiger, great 
wolves and hyenas, the rhinoceros and the mastodon 
were in the forests. Which of these would be the most 
numerous? The most dangerous? The cave-bear and 
tiger and the mastodon were less frequent. The others 
were seen very often. How could the cave-man tell 
when one of the fierce ones was about?

44 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
How Ab’s mother saved him from a hyena when 
he was a tiny baby 
How do you know it was not in the cave? Why 
would she take him out with her? What would she 
do with him while she was shaking trees and gathering 
nuts? How would she fix the nest of leaves on the 
ground? Why should he keep very quiet? What 
could she do to keep him quiet? He did not often cry 
as it was so likely that wild animals would hear. Ab’s 
mother fed him, laid him in a nice nest of dry beech 
leaves and gave him some twigs to play with. When 
he grew tired of play he fell asleep. How far away 
would his mother go? After a while he awoke and gave 
a cry. What would his mother do? She ran to him, 
picked him up, and tossed him above her head. Then 
she heard the distant bark of the dreaded hyena that 
was following their trail. What could she do? How 
could she climb a tree with the baby? She took the 
baby under one arm, leaped into the air and caught 
the lowest branch of a beech tree with the other. How 
could she get up the rest of the way? Putting the 
baby Ab between her knees so that she could use both 
hands, she easily drew herself up on the limb, took 
the baby in her arm again, and was out of reach just 
as the hyena dashed under the tree. Why would she 
not be frightened as one of us would be? 
For a while she teased the ugly beast. How would 
she do it? What danger was she still in? How could
-P-A-G-E-53
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 45 
she get help? What would she tell Ab’s father in her 
call? How could he safely reach the tree? You remem- 
ber that the cave-man had to be a very good climber, 
and we have just seen how easily Ab’s mother climbed 
the tree with him. The cave-man could easily go long 
distances in the woods without touching the ground. 
How could he do that? How could Ab’s father help 
free them? How could he get the hyena to come close 
enough to be killed? He broke off a huge limb, tore 
off the small branches and made it about two yards 
long. When the hyena saw him climb down to the 
lowest limb, it thought it was going to have a good 
supper and leaped right at him, but Ab’s father laid 
it low with a lightning blow from his heavy club, 
sprang down and finished it with a swing of his stone 
axe. Then what would they all do? The mother leaped 
lightly down with the child and with it perched on her 
shoulder they hastened home to a supper of wild horse, 
which Ab’s father had killed by rolling a large stone 
over a steep cliff. What had the mother found for the 
supper? How could she carry the nuts and berries? 
What pictures does this story make you see? First 
— The mother leaving the cave with the baby on 
her shoulder or under her arm, some trees. Mother 
is dressed in a skin, the baby not dressed. Second — 
Baby on the bed of leaves, playing with a twig, mother 
in the distance picking up nuts, or in a tree shaking 
the nuts. Third ~— Mother tossing the baby. Many 
other pictures may be described and drawn. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
What they did when they got home 
Where do you think the father had left the haunch 
of wild horse? How large a door do you think the cave 
had? How could he make it so small? How could he 
close it when they left it in the daytime? They were 
glad to find the stone still there. What would they 
find inside besides the meat? How had he kept the 
fire? How could he get it ready for the meat? How 
could he get rid of most of the smoke? The hole in 
the roof had been very hard to make. How do you 
think he had done it? Why would you think that 
was not a very good fireplace? What do you think 
One-Ear, Ab’s father, liked about it? 
Where was the meat in the cave? How would they 
get it ready to cook? From the collection of stones 
the teacher or class may have, children should select 
those that would be best for a stone knife. How would 
they use such a knife? How would they cook the meat? 
How would they prepare the nuts? How would they 
eat? Why would they have good appetites? How 
would they get ready for bed? What kind of a bed 
would they have? Why would they to go bed early? 
What would we not like about living that way? Why 
did One-Ear think he had a very happy home? How 
was Hiawatha’s home better than Ab’s? How would 
the cave-man make the all-night fire? How could they 
be safe on rainy nights? Which would they prefer?
-P-A-G-E-55
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES aT 
Some things Ab had to learn 
Why did cave families probably not live very close 
together? Good caves were rare; most of the hunting 
was better done alone or in pairs; too many people 
hunting in one neighborhood soon spoiled the hunt- 
ing. On what occasions would the cave-men want to 
get together? They probably came together when 
there was great danger from an enemy or to hunt the 
cave-bear, the cave-tiger or the mastodon. How then 
would Ab spend most of his time when a boy of your 
age? He had a younger brother and a baby sister. 
How could they be safe when father and mother were 
away all day? Ab was old enough to keep the outside 
fire going; or if it was a rainy day the door was 
blocked by the large stone. 
Why was there not much work to do? How could 
Ab sharpen his mother’s bone needle? How could she 
sew with a needle that had no eye? How could Ab 
make the thread for his mother? Why would it be 
good for him to do those things? How far away from 
the cave would the children go? Why could Ab go 
farther? Why could he not go very far? What would 
he enjoy about being out in the trees? He found ber- 
ries at times and nuts and eggs; it was fun to sway in 
the treetops and to swing from tree to tree. He en- 
joyed finding that he could do all these things better 
and better. Why could he do them all so much better 
than we can? ,
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
How Ab found a playmate 
One day when he was nine years old and felt that 
he was quite a man, he was swaying in a tall treetop 
near the cave. The other treetops far and near were 
still, when suddenly Ab’s quick, sharp eye saw one of 
them in the distance begin to sway to and fro also. 
What would Ab do? He stopped swaying, climbed 
down a little bit, drew behind the tree stem, and 
watched closely to make out what it was. It turned 
out to be a strange boy of about his own age. Why 
would this interest him? How could he get acquainted 
with the boy? He started swinging from tree to tree 
toward the boy. What would he do when the trees 
were too far apart? When he had gone a little over 
half way, he heard a rustle a few trees ahead of him! 
What would he do? He drew behind the trunk of the 
tree and the noise stopped. He waited for a long time. 
When he peeped out he saw a brown bump on a tree 
a few yards away. When it moved he saw it was the 
boy. They both came out and sat where they could 
see each other. Why do you suppose they watched 
each other for a while before getting closer and speak- 
ing? What would they say to each other? 
Ab said, “Who are you?” 
“T am Oak; who are you?” 
*T am Ab; I am not afraid of you.” 
“T am not afraid of you.” 
** Where do you live?”
-P-A-G-E-57
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 49 
“I live in the cave on the hill; my father is Hill- 
top.” 
“T live in the cave by the river; my father is One- 
Ear.” 
Why was that a good introduction? They went to 
the river, climbed up on a high rock where they 
were safe, and threw stones into the river. 
How Ab and Oak tried to capture a wild horse and 
how they got more than they bargained for 
Why would they be particularly anxious to do this? 
If they succeeded what would their fathers say when 
a big hunt was planned? How had One-Ear killed 
the horse the day he killed that hyena? Why did 
Ab and Oak not plan to do it that way? How do 
you think they might do it? They decided to make 
a trap. What kind of a trap could it be? They de- 
cided to dig a pit into which a wild horse might fall. 
How could they expect a wild horse to be so foolish or 
careless? How strong would the covering have to be? 
What tools could the boys get for the work? They found 
some clam shells that made very good shovels, without 
handles of course, and not so large as we should like. 
How large would they plan to make the pit? 
The next question was where to dig it. Should it 
be in the woods, in an open plain, in the valley by the 
river, or up on the hills? The wild horses did not like 
to feed in the open plain by day, for they could be 
seen for a long distance and their enemies could creep

  50 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
upon them through the tall grass, but at night these 
fields were their favorite feeding places. There were 
several of these grassy plains not far away. The boys 
chose one near the river and about a mile away from 
One-Ear’s cave. Show on a map which should be 
started on the blackboard. Where would it be best to 
have the pit, near the woods or near the center? 
Which would be safer for the boys? About a two-min- 
ute run from the woods was a clump of trees; one was 
quite large. How could that help? How far was it 
from the woods? How would they keep from being 
surprised in such a dangerous place? What would 
have to be done with the dirt from the pit? They had 
great difficulty, very hard work, and a very great 
fright. Teacher should tell or read about the digging 
and the sea serpent. This was enough to discourage 
most ordinary boys and many men, but Ab and Oak 
were not ordinary boys. They went back to work and 
finally finished the trap just as you said it should be. 
What would they do then? Teacher should read or 
tell of the capture of the young rhinoceros and of the 
fight between the mother and Saber-Tooth! What 
reasons have we now for thinking that the boys will 
be treated very much like men? i 
How Ab and Oak captured other animals 
Ab and Oak spent most of their time hunting, but 
they did not often catch a young rhinoceros. One 
day Ab came running home with a gray, fluffy young

wolf cub in each hand! The cave-wolf mother was a 
very fierce animal. How do you suppose he had man- 
aged it? How could he carry them safely? How could 
he keep them from running away? As they grew larger 
they bit Bark and Beechleaf so severely that One-Ear 
made Ab turn them out. Why do you suppose they 
stayed around the cave instead of running away? Why 
do you suppose these two wolves did not like it when 
other wolves came around? How do you suppose Ab 
found that out? One morning Ab found four baby 
wolves with one of them near the cave! Why would 
these be safer for the children than the others had 
been? How could Ab get them to follow him? Why 
would he like to have them do so? How could they 
help him hunt? Why would Ab not want very many 
young wolves? When would they have to be given 
away? How do our dogs differ from Ab’s dogs? 
Ab became very skillful at hunting birds, especially 
the wild ducks. How do you suppose he did it? They 
fed in flocks in the river near the shore or near an 
island. Sometimes he crept up close to them; some- 
times he hid close to the river and waited for them to 
come near. He was quite sure to get one out of the 
flock whenever he threw a stone. How do you sup- 
pose he was able to coax them up close enough for 
him to throw? What kind of a trap could he make to 
catch a wild duck or a grouse? What kind of bait 
would he use? How else could he get these birds? 
How could he hunt the wild hogs, especially the pigs?
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Ab and Oak had less trouble to find those animals 
that were not so good to eat. Which ones were they? 
Why were they easier to find? Which ones would the 
boys flee from? How could they fight the others? It 
should be borne in mind in the foregoing discussion 
that Ab had only a spear with a stone head; a stone 
axe; sinew and strips of skin for string; skill in throw- 
ing, speed in running; knowledge of the food, feeding 
places, calls, and habits of the animals to be hunted; 
and cunning to use all of his resources. After the dis- 
cussion, in which the teacher will correct misunder- 
standings and will give a good deal of information, 
she should read the latter part of chapter ten. 
What old Mok taught Ab 
About that time the crippled old Mok came to live 
in One-Ear’s cave. How do you suppose he became 
crippled? How would it show that he had been one of 
the big men? Why do you suppose any of the cave- 
people would be glad to have old Mok live with them? 
As a great hunter, he must have been learned in all 
the things the cave-people needed to know and 
skilled in all the things in which they needed to be 
skilled. Why would Ab and Mok probably like each 
other very much? Read from chapter ten what they 
did together.

How the first bow and arrow were made 
What weapons and tools had the cave-man learned 
to make? Stone-headed spear, stone axe, flint scraper 
with wood or bone handle, a sort of hatchet, a bone 
needle without an eye. How do you think they used 
the spear in hunting? How did they use the stone axe 
in hunting? Which was the better for hunting? In 
what ways would the bow and arrow be better than 
the spear? Bark, Ab’s little brother, made the first 
bow and arrow. He did it while playing with and 
teasing his sister Beechleaf. How do you think he did 
it? The children can probably tell each step and how 
he played each time. The teacher should then confirm 
what the children have said by telling or reading to 
where Beechleaf screams. What should Ab find out 
before he punishes Bark? How can Bark best tell 
him how it happened? Why is another accident 
likely? How must this bow and arrow be changed to 
make it good to hunt with? Read about his taking it 
to old Mok and about his first hunt. —

ing pot. How could he go about it? What kind of 
stone would he use for the kettle? For digging it out?

water to put into the kettle? How could they heat the 
water? Try this. Read or tell the story. 
How the cave-men killed the mammoth 
Why could the cave-families not live very close to- 
gether? When do you think it would be necessary for 
all of the cave-men to get together? What were the 
animals that had to be hunted that way? How could 
all the cave-men find out when to come? Which would 
disturb the people more, — to know that the great, 
hairy mammoth was in the neighborhood, or Saber- 
Tooth? How would they know about each being there? 
Which one would they be the more anxious to kill? 
Near the cave of Hilltop was a level stretch of wood- 
land, partially open, that ran to the edge of a preci- 
pice of over a hundred feet. One day the good news 
came that the.herd of mammoths was in this wood. 
Why would the cave-men wait until they were there? 
They decided to try to drive one of them over the prec- 
ipice with fire. How would they prepare? How ap- 
proach? What is the danger? How attempt to stam- 
pede the mammoths? Read or tell about the mam- 
moth hunt, and the feast, omitting the love story. 
How Ab killed Saber-Tooth 
The killing of Saber-Tooth was very different. How 
could the cave-people know that he was near? Read 
to where Ab climbed the tree and dropped the peb-

bles. What was he planning to do? How could he 
weight the spear so that it would strike straight? How 
fasten it to the limb? How release it? Read how 
Saber-Tooth came and was killed. Which will cause 
the greater rejoicing, killing the mammoth or killing 
Saber-Tooth? How will they rejoice? What could 
Ab get from this and all the rest of his hunting that 
he might like to hang up in his cave? What could he 
get that he might like to wear? What sort of an orna- 
ment could he make from the tiger’s claws? Why 
would he like to wear this? Who else might properly 
wear it? What would you think of one of the men who 
would not go to help kill Saber-Tooth wearing one of 
his claws in an earring or necklace? What ornaments 
would Red Spot or Beechleaf wear that Ab would not 
care to wear? 
Things for the children to do while studying the 
story of Ab

thought good to eat. 
Collect any trophies, pieces of ivory, carved bones, 
or horn, pretty pebbles, or berries that might have been 
valued as ornaments. Make some necklaces or bracelets. 
Collect pictures of caves, dense forests, cliffs, traps, 
primitive utensils or weapons, which may serve to

Take an excursion to a place where the whole story 
might be imagined to have occurred. Make a fire and 
cook part of the luncheon over it. Boil water and some 
eggs by putting heated stones in the water. Lift the 
hot stones with improvised wooden tongs. 
Collect pictures, cuttings, etc., into booklets with 
very brief compositions supplementing the pictures. 
Bind the books and make an appropriate cover design. 
A final entertainment may well be given at which 
the children could tell the story to the audience as 
they had worked it out in class. Parts could be told, 
parts read from their own booklets, parts dramatized, 
and parts shown by pictures, all culminating in their 
dances and songs. The visitors could examine the 
sand table, maps, tools, implements and weapons. 
The children should explain where the different things 
were found, how they were made, and how the cave- 
people used them. This should not be the result of a 
number of rehearsals with the accompanying danger 
of artificiality and self-consciousness, but the natural 
and childlike culmination of a series of interesting 
studies. 
ROBINSON CRUSOE 
This story offers a surprising number of opportunities 
for children to see the need of, and to gain experience in the 
use of, facts required in other subjects in the third-grade 
curriculum. They will have need to make maps to different 
scales according to definite measurements when they work 
out Crusoe’s habitation. They will acquire some facts

    58 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
about the climate of tropical countries; they will realize 
some of the differences between civilized and uncivilized 
peoples; they will appreciate the relation of the different 
occupations of man and their relation to their own lives. 
In their map and sand table or out-of-door construction 
work, the children must gain a working knowledge of the 
terms: map, continent, mainland, island, hill, mountain, 
slope, bay, creek, inlet, canal, and harbor. The children will 
frequently need to use the facts of linear and dry measure, 
and of the calendar. 
As to the ethical quality of the story, it is too apparent to 
need mention. It probably culminates in the discussion of 
the question on page 83, “In what ways is Robinson Cru- 
soe a better man than when he landed on the island?”

work of farm and dairy, lumbering, work of the minis-

gained from his older brothers? Strange to say these 
were the ideas strongest in Robinson’s mind. Above 
all things else he wanted to go to sea. What would his 
father say to him when he knew this? What tell him 
about his brothers? What advice give him? What 
would his mother say? Read some of the father’s 
counsel. For a time he obeyed his parents and re- 
mained at home, but his thoughts were always on 
going to sea. He lived in York, an inland town 
in England. What would he know about going 
to sea? Nothing very definite; perhaps tales of ad- 
venture and fun; possibly of great riches and treas- 
ure to be gained. What are the things he would not 
know? 
One day as he was visiting in a seaport town, he 
met a friend about to sail for London. On being in- 
vited to go, he accepted at once without ever sending 
word to his parents. What does this tell about him? 
The first night out a heavy wind blew. Robinson 
was scared and seasick. Of what would he think? 
What would he decide? But in the morning his friend 
and the sailors laughed at the light wind and Robin- 
son was soon making merry with the rest. Before 
they reached London, however, a terrible storm arose,
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
such as the sailors had never experienced. The ship 
was wrecked but they all got to shore. What now 
would you expect Robinson to do? What welcome 
could he expect from his parents if he went home 
sorry? What would his young friends and neighbors 
in York say about him? To him? When he thought 
of these things he decided to go to sea again. This is 
what he said later about this decision: “I have since 
often observed how [young people] are not ashamed 
to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed 
of the action for which they might justly be esteemed 
fools, but are ashamed of returning, which only can 
make them be esteemed wise men.” 
After a time he had an opportunity to sail in a ship 
going to a southern coast. When they had been at 
sea for some time, a violent storm came on lasting 
many days. It drove them far from their course so 
that no one on the vessel knew where they were, and 
finally the ship hit upon a sand bar about a mile from 
a strange coast. What would the eleven men on the 
ship fear? What would they do? What would be the 
danger in the small life-boat in such a storm? It was 
overturned in the waves, as they feared, and all the 
men perished except Robinson Crusoe. 
After a terrible struggle with the waves he got to 
shore near nightfall. What would he have with him? 
He had only some clothing, a knife; a pipe, and to- 
bacco. What did he know about this land? What 
dangers might there be? Where could he most safely

SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 61 
spend the night? What kind of a tree choose? “Thick 
bushy fir tree.” How could he make himself com- 
fortable? How safe from falling should he go to sleep? 
What could he take for defense? How did it come 
about then that Robinson Crusoe had to live alone 
on an island? 
How Robinson Crusoe spent his first day alone 
What would he look for first in the morning? He 
saw he was on a sandy plain; an inlet or river, about 
one-half mile broad, at his right; and a high hill about 
a mile inland that shut off further view. The storm 
had abated but in the night had driven the ship further 
on the sand bar and she stood nearly upright not more 
than a quarter of a mile from shore. What would he 
think about their having left the ship? Why not sit 
and grieve over this? Why would he choose to ex 
plore the ship before exploring the island? Ship might 
go to pieces; need of food; might get some weapons 
to make safer an adventure on land. How could he get 
to the ship? How get on board? What look for first? 
He found the ship had bulged and some water was in 
her, but the side that stood highest out of water con- 
tained the ship’s provisions, so they were dry. What 
other things would he look for after eating? He found 
bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses, five pieces of dried 
goat’s flesh, a little corn, and several cases of liquors. 
The barley and wheat on board had been eaten by the 
rats. Then he got together some clothes; found two
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
fowling pieces and two pistols in the cabin, the car- 
penter’s chest and a bag of gold. Why would he con- 
sider the carpenter’s chest more valuable than the 
gold? What would he need for his guns? After much 
search he found a bag of shot and two barrels of dry 
powder. Now what is his problem? How would he 
meet it? Read how he made the raft. Children make 
miniature rafts. The waves were still rolling and 
would wash over the raft. How could he plan to keep 
the things dry? Read what he did. How would he 
propel this raft? What would be his difficulty in land- 
ing? How would the inlet help? What kind of a 
place could he choose to land? How, even there, 
could he keep the raft from tipping and chests from 
sliding off? He guided the raft to a flat piece of ground 
when the tide was highest and propped up the outer 
end with his broken oars. As the tide went out it left 
the raft high and dry on land. 
It was then afternoon. What would he need to 
know next? What kind of land; whether inhabited; 
any wild beasts; where best to live; where to find fresh 
water. How would he prepare for this exploration? 
Where would he go? Read what he saw from the hill. 
As he returned he shot at a great bird. He wrote: “I 
had no sooner fired than out from all parts of the wood 
there arose an innumerable number of fowls of many 
sorts, making a confused screaming, but not one of 
them of any kind that I knew.” What did that tell 
him about the fowls? First gun they had ever heard.
-P-A-G-E-71
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 63 
What about the country? Entirely strange to him; 
probably uninhabited. 
On his return how could he prepare for the night? 
How could he use the chests and boards he had 
brought on the raft? Why was this hut better than a 
tree? What would he eat for supper? What in his past 
life would he have to think over before he went to 
sleep. What would he think about the future? 
How he spent the neat twelve days 
What more did Robinson Crusoe know this second 
night about his condition? How long did it seem 
probable that he would have to remain? What needs 
would arise? How could these best be supplied? What 
harm might come to the ship? So what had he 
better do? He decided to lay aside all else and get 
from the ship everything he could possibly use. What 
things should he select the second day? The third? 
Why would he decide to prepare a new raft each day? 
Less time to make a new one than to propel the old 
one back to the ship; each raft was made of masts, 
boards, and ropes which he would need on shore. 
How could he make himself more comfortable and 
safe the second night? Why was it important to make 
a large shelter at once? What things would he put 
inside? Make sketches showing how you would ar- 
range the tent outside and inside. Read Crusoe’s 
description. 
In these twelve days he made eleven trips to the

ship. On the last trip a storm was rising and he had 
to leave the ship in haste without a raft. Read, “‘Ac- 
cordingly I let myself down —” to end of chapter. 
Let us make a list of all the wealth he had secured. 
Correct and supplement these lists from Crusoe’s own 
list: — 
First Day Second Day 
Rice 1 dog (swam ashore) 
8 Dutch cheeses 8 bags of nails and spikes 
5 pieces dry goat’s flesh 1 great screw jack 
5 gallons liquors 1 dozen or more hatchets

2 barrels dry powder 1 fowling piece with powder 
2 saws 1 large bag small shot 
laxe Some clothes 
1 hammer 1 small sail 
1 hammock

Which of these would be permanent? Which not? 
How long would they last? Why were each of these 
things chosen?

The Tenth Trip The Eleventh and Last Trip 
Ship’s cables 2 razors 
“iron work 1 pr. large scissors 
“big sails 1 doz. knives and forks 
86 pounds in money (about $180) 
How could he bring the great cables? Sails? How 
large pieces would he cut? How would this raft-load 
compare with the others? It did upset when he tried 
to land, and all went into the water. How much of 
it could he get again? Why not the iron? 
Why did he leave the money until last? Why take 
it at all? What are some of the common things he 
lacks? What will be Crusoe’s next problem? 
The teacher would have at this time a fine oppor- 
tunity to correlate by teaching in arithmetic the 
measures and abbreviations used in the above list. 
How Robinson Crusoe prepared a place to live and 
keep safe his possessions 
What would be his first problem? Should he make 
atent or cave? Where should he make it? What would 
he consider in choosing a place? Fresh water; shelter 
from the sun; secure from dangerous men or beasts; 
near the sea so that he could see a passing ship. Read 
about the place he selected. Make a map of the place, 
with accurate scale, 1 inch = 25 yards. 
Why was this northwest exposure good? Of what 
use could the hill be? The small beginning of a cave? 
He decided to make a tent as well as a cave. Where 
should he place it? How could he make his home safe

  66 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
  on the side away from the hill? How far from his tent 
should his fence or fortification be? In what shape? 
How high would it need to be? Of what materials 
could he make it? Stone, earth, board fence, picket 
fence. What would Robinson Crusoe have to con- 
sider in deciding which of these to use? Time it would 
take; difficulty of getting different materials; what he 
had which he could use; what would be the best pro- 
tection from savages or wild animals; which would be 
least conspicuous; his own skill in working with the
-P-A-G-E-75
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 67 
different materials; what tools he had. Plan it as you 
think he would do it. After full discussion read the 
part giving size, shape, material, and construction of 
the fortification. How did his own plan meet his 
needs? His materials? His ability? 
Let us make a map now of this fortified enclosure 
to a larger scale; % inch to 1 yard. How much 
larger is this scale? Compare the two maps. Just 
what part of the first map is the second? What is the 
value of making it on a larger scale? How could 
Robinson Crusoe do his measuring? After the map is

done, have the children represent this on the sand 
table or on a larger scale in the school yard and add 
to it as the work progresses. 
How would he plan to get in and out? Why not a 
gate? Have children make a rope ladder. Where 
would he put his tent? How large would it be? Large 
enough to sleep in and to keep dry all his stores. Of 
what would he make it? How arrange so it would 
keep dry inside? How long a time would all this take? 
What other things would he have to do during this 
work? He wrote: “I began to order my times of work. 
Every morning I walked out with my gun for two or 
three hours, if it did not rain; then employed myself 
to work until eleven o’clock; then eat what I had to 
live on; and from twelve to two I lay down to sleep, 
the weather being excessive hot; and then in the 
evening to work again.” 
Robinson Crusoe knew that in this climate there 
were two rainy seasons a year lasting about two 
months each. One ended shortly after the ship dis- 
appeared in the middle of October. When might he 
expect the next to end? Middle of April. Then when 
would it begin? Middle of February. By the end of 
the second rainy season, he had his wall completed, 
tent made, possessions inside, entrance to wall closed 
and rope ladder made. How would he spend his time 
during the rainy season and very hot days? Make his 
cave; put things in order; make furniture. What 
would he feel to be the greatest need? What imple-
-P-A-G-E-77
  
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 69 
ments would he need for extending this cave that 
were not in his possession? Consult lists. What could 
he use instead of a pickaxe? Iron crowbar. How 
could he make a shovel? Read Crusoe’s description 
of how he made it. How could he carry out the dirt 
and stones? What would be the chief difficulty in 
making a wheelbarrow? A large basket? Read of his 
trials and the making of a hod. Where could he put 
the earth and stones to advantage? He wrote: “TI laid 
them up within my fence in the nature of a terrace 
so that it raised the ground within about a foot and 
a half.” What advantage in this? 
How large would he make this cave? How high? 
He wrote: “I worked to make this room or cave spa- 
cious enough to accommodate me as a warehouse, a 
kitchen, a dining-room and a cellar; as for my lodg- 
ing, I kept to the tent.” Later Crusoe wrote: ‘I 
worked sideways to the right hand into the rock; and 
then, turning to the right again, worked quite out, 
and made me a door to come out on the outside of 
my fortification.” How long must this passage have 
been? What advantage in having this passage? Just 
before he thought the cave was finished, a great por- 
tion of stones and sand fell from the ceiling. Why 
would it frighten him? How could he make it safe? 
Read Crusoe’s description of this. What would he 
still have to do to make the cave orderly and home- 
like? He put up large boards for shelves, drove wooden 
pegs into the sides of the cave, and arranged all his

    70 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
goods in a convenient way. What would he put on 
the different shelves? Look over lists. What hang up? 
Picture to yourself how it all looked when finished. 
Read Crusoe’s description. After living here a year 
“ or more, through two rainy seasons, he found he 
needed greater protection for his tent. How could 
he most easily cover it? Raised rafters from top of 
fortification leaning to the rock. Thatched it over 
with boughs of trees. 
Describe Robinson Crusoe’s house. This may be 
done by use of maps, sand table or out-of-doors con- 
struction, and words. A visitor in the classroom, the 
principal, or a visit from another class, might well 
be the motive for this description. 
Some of the other things Robinson Crusoe did during 
this time to make his life more comfortable 
What was his greatest need all this time? What 
food had he? What other kinds would he need? What 
means had he for getting them? What was his habit 
each day? What difference did it make that he was 
in a strange country? In one of his first trips he recog- 
nized some goats. What food could they give him? 
What difficulty would he have in getting them? Very 
shy, wild, and swift of foot, always in herds. He sent 
his dog after them. Why do you suppose the dog 
failed? What then must Robinson Crusoe do? He 
watched their haunts and habits and discovered that 
if he was on the plain below and they on the rocks

SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES vel 
above they always saw him and ran, but if they were 
feeding on the plain and he could get up on the rocks 
quietly they did not see him. Read about his first 
goat and her kid. How long could he make this meat 
last? Eat some fresh; dry the rest. How could he 
cook it? Later he lamed a young goat and took 
her home. Why would it be a great advantage to 
keep her alive? Give him milk. What could he do 
to keep and tame her? Put her leg into splints, feed 
her, pet her; it would be some time before she could 
run. 
At another time he shot some ducks and one day 
when he was down by the shore he found a great tor- 
toise. How would this give him variety? Fish, flesh, 
and game. On opening the turtle, he found many 
turtle eggs in her. How could he cook these? They 
were a great delicacy as were some young pigeons 
which he found. How could he get these? Watch the 
old pigeons and learn where their nests were. 
Look through your list of his possessions and see 
what other things he must have needed. Why would 
he want a table? A chair? Why not a whole set of 
chairs? Of what could he make them? Why would it 
take him a long time? How could boys taught in 
schools to-day do it better? Why was time not im- 
portant to Robinson Crusoe? Read how he made his 
chairs. Of what could he make dishes? What clay 
choose? How shape them? How bake them? How 
many and what shapes and sizes would he make?
-P-A-G-E-80
72 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Why would n’t they hold the goat’s milk? Read about 
his trials in making a cask. When would he have to 
go to bed? Of what could he make a candle? A candle- 
stick, or something to hold the hardened tallow? How 
often would he burn this? 
How could he tell the time of day? Days? Weeks? 
Months? He wrote: “After I had been there about 
ten or twelve days, it came into my thoughts that 
I should lose my reckoning of time.” Why? What 
could he do to keep track of the days and months? 
Read Crusoe’s plan for a calendar. Children make a 
calendar like Crusoe’s and keep it for a time. In what 
different ways would it help him to keep a journal? 
How long could he keep this? 
How Robinson Crusoe met with new troubles 
Read from Crusoe’s journal about the earthquake, 
its result upon the ship, and his new possessions from 
the ship. Why should he want the boards? Great 
ship’s timbers? Iron? 
What may have been Crusoe’s thought and feeling 
all through the first nine months when he thought 
about himself and his condition? Who was really 
to blame for all his loneliness and trouble? One day 
in June Robinson Crusoe had a severe chill. Why was 
that strange? He was in a climate where weather was 
always warm. This chill was followed by headache 
and fever. What would he know? Why would it be 
very serious for him to be ill? No medicine; no one
-P-A-G-E-81
  
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 73 
to take care of him; no fresh food or water. For six 
days he was very ill. After that he was ill one day and 
fairly well the next and so on for some time. What 
would he do on the days when he was better? What 
would he fear when he was very ill? What would he 
think about? What dream about? Read Crusoe’s 
account of his terrible dream. How would this affect 
him? In this terrible fear and loneliness he wanted to 
pray but he had not done so for so long he had forgot- 
ten how. What could he say? “Lord, look upon me. 
Lord, have pity upon me!” As he thought over all 
his life, what would he wish most? He recalled his 
father’s counsel. What was it? God would not bless 
him; would punish him. How had this been true? 
This made him very sad indeed. 
When he was looking in his chest one day, he found 
the Bible he had brought from the ship. He opened it 
and read, “Call on me in the day of trouble and I will 
deliver you.” What is the promise? What would he 
do? Day after day he prayed and read the Bible and 
thought about it, and as the days went on he found 
the chills less frequent and himself growing stronger. 
What deliverance had he had? How would it make 
him feel? He was too weak for his accustomed work. 
As he sat through the day, what would he see and 
think about? The sea and its power; the earth; the 
animals; himself, his food, and shelter. What ques- 
tions would come to him? How would he answer 
them? How would all this change his feeling? His

thoughts? He said in his journal: “My condition be- 
gan now to be, not less miserable as to my way of living, 
yet much easier to my mind.... I had a great 
deal of comfort within which till now I knew nothing 
8,7) 
Robinson Crusoe had now been ten months on the 
island. How had he provided for his clothing? His 
food? His shelter? Other comforts? What now were 
his thoughts about his condition? What reasons had 
he to believe there were no other people on the island? 
No fierce wild animals? What reasons would he have 
for making some trips of exploration? Wish to know 
more about the other parts of the island; might find 
other foods; little or no fear now, for himself or for 
his home while away. Read about his various trips, 
his making his summer home, the foods found. Why 
would the dried grapes and limes be such a great addi- 
tion to his food supply? They were wholesome; would 
keep well through the year; furnish variety to meat, 
eggs, and bread; healthful. What now would he have 
for breakfast? For dinner? For supper? How would 
he feel about his tent and cave on his return from a 
several days’ trip? 
How Crusoe began to raise grain 
What troubles would you expect him to have? No 
seed; not know when to plant; no suitable tools for 
working the ground or gathering the crop; difficult 
to protect the crop while growing. One day after the
-P-A-G-E-83
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 15 
first rainy season, Crusoe was surprised to find some 
tiny, green shoots growing on the: plain outside his 
fence. As he watched them week after week twenty 
fine heads of European barley and some thirty stray 
stalks of rice developed. How could it have got 
there? He recalled that he had shaken out the sacks 
there that had contained the barley and rice on the 
ship. What had become of the barley? What would 
he do when the grain ripened? He saved it with great 
care that he might plant it to raise more. At what 
time had he better plant it? What did he know now 
about the seasons? Let us make his calendar of 
seasons, from the time he arrived on the island,

He decided to plant early in May. What season 
was this? Where would he plant? How could he pre- 
pare the ground? While working the ground with his 
wooden spade he decided to plant only about two 
thirds of his rice and barley? Why? What do you know 
about the needs of grain that Crusoe did not think 
about? When his grain did not come up he suspected 
it was because of the lack of moisture. When, then, 
should he plant? Early in August he sowed again, 
this time up near his bower because the ground 
seemed better. How much would he plant now? How 
much would he have left? About ten stalks of rice 
and seven of barley. He saved half of this. How large 
a crop would he have? In all he had about half a peck 
of each. The next season with great pains and labor 
he sowed a larger field near his bower. This crop 
seemed most promising until Crusoe discovered two 
serious enemies, hares and fowls. How could he pro- 
tect it from the hares? From the fowls? Read what 
he did. In what will he put his grain when ripe? Read 
about the basket-making. 
When Crusoe had gathered a good crop of grain 
into his baskets, how would he plan to use it? Save 
out a good proportion of seed; eat the rest. What 
new problems now confronted him? How would he 
reap his grain? How thresh it? How grind it into 
meal? What kind of a mill would you suggest? Show 
or have children describe a mortar and pestle used in 
grinding spices. How is it used? Why does the ves-

“SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 7 
sel have to be hard? Why deep? He could find no 
large hollow stone to use. Why not take a large, soft 
stone and hollow it out? Stone would crumble with 
the corn when he began to grind. What then could he 
do? Read what he did. How could he use fire to help 
hollow it out? Why would this make it better? 
Smoother; grind corn more easily; lose less. Why 
would he need to sift it? How could he make a sieve? 
Read. When he had his meal ready, what next? 
How Robinson Crusoe made cooking dishes 
What dishes did he make first? What kind of clay 
did he use? How did he shape them? How harden 
them? Why would he have to be very careful in clean- 
ing or washing them? How has Robinson Crusoe 
cooked his meat up to this time? His flour? What 
kind of cooked meat would he long for? Why would 
the possession of plenty of rice and flour for bread, in- 
crease this need? What was his problem? How to make 
dishes that would hold water and that would withstand 
fire for cooking and baking. How do people do this? 
Robinson Crusoe did not know anything at all 
about burning or glazing pottery. One day, how- 
ever, he discovered some broken pieces of one of his 
plates in the fire. He saw that they got red hot and 
looked hard. What would he do? How test them? 
When he had raked them out and found that they 
were really hard and would not soften in water, he 
was overjoyed. Describe just how you think he made

78 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
his new pots and pipkins. Read the three paragraphs 
of his own description. What do you think he would 
do first with his new cooking utensils? He thought his 
kid broth the best thing he ever tasted. 
He still had several things to do before he could 
bake bread. What were they? How large and what 
shape would the baking-pans be? How would he 
make an oven? Knowing he could get no yeast, he 
decided to make bread without it. Read Crusoe’s 
description of his baking bread, his baking-pans and 
oven. Later he learned to make butter and cheese 
from goats’ milk. How could he do these things? 
What now could he have for breakfast? For dinner? 
For supper? What comforts would he have while 
eating? Table, chair, and dishes, in comfortable and 
safe cave. What companions had he? He had also 
captured a parrot. How could this be more comfort to 
him than goats, cats, or even his dog? What would he 
teach the parrot to say? What real need did Robin- 
son Crusoe still have at the end of his third year? 
Have the children select clay, make dishes, and bake 
them in the sun. Try baking them in an outdoor fire. 
Possibly they can make some baking pans and an 
oven, grind some corn meal, and bake a corn cake. 
How Robinson Crusoe built a boat 
With all the comforts that he had, why should he 
wish to do this? Why did he provide for the other 
things first? From the other side of the island he had t 7 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 79 
seen land about forty miles away. He hoped that this 
was the mainland. Why would that, even though 
strange to him, seem better than an island? What 
dangers were ahead if he did get started? Dangers of 
the sea; of unknown, barren land when he reached it; 
of savages or even cannibals. Robinson Crusoe did 
not seem to think of these things, so anxious was he 
again to reach civilization. 
What kind of a boat would he decide to make? Why 
would a “dug out” or canoe shaped from a log, seem 
best? How large would he wish to make it? Large 
enough to carry all his goods and food and sail over 
forty miles of rough sea. He chose an immense cedar 
tree five feet, ten inches in diameter at the base and 
four feet, eleven inches at the other end, twenty-two 
feet away. Why cedar? Measure this off in the school

tree in the vicinity. Get the diameter of a growing 
tree by taking one third of its circumference. How 
long would it take him to hew this down? What would 
he have to donext? How long would it take him to cut 
off the top and limbs? What next? Next? How long 
for each? Robinson Crusoe wrote that it took: — 
20 days to hew down the tree. 
14 days to cut off the branches. 
1 month to shape the bottom and outside. 
8 months to dig out the inside.

nearly half a year. Why would he be willing to per- 
sist so long? What would he be thinking as he 
worked? 
Where would he have to build this? The place 
where he felled the cedar was about one hundred 
yards from the creek. How many feet? Measure 
the distance in the school yard. There was another 
difficulty. While the land the boat lay on was 
much higher than the surface of the creek, there 
was a hill between it and the creek. Show this by a 
sketch. 
What now was his problem? How could he meet it? 
First he tried to dig through the hill so that it would 
be down hill to the water. How wide a space would he 
need to dig? How long? After this was done he could 
not get his boat into the water. What reason do you 
see for this? What do you think he would try next? 
He thought he might dig a canal up to the boat. 
How would this help? After he had been digging for 
several days he at last began to think how long it 
would take. Let us see. How long must the canal 
be? Three hundred feet, and twenty-two feet, — the 
length of the boat. How wide? How deep? The water 
of the creek was much lower than the level of the land 
the boat was on. It would have to be dug lower than 
the surface of the creek if the water was made to go 
to the boat. Robinson Crusoe figured this out and 
decided that at the rate he could work, it would take 
him ten or twelve years. Why will he give it up? How

much time had he already spent on this? Of what 
worth was it? What must happen to the boat on 
which he had spent all that time and hard labor? As 
he thought it over, what would he say to himself? He 
said: “This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, 
though too late, the folly of beginning a work before 
we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our 
own strength to go through with it.” 
This failure was in Robinson Crusoe’s fifth year on 
the island. What would it decide for him? He began 
to think things over. He was owner and king of the 
whole island. No one would dispute his command. He 
could do what he chose. How should he spend his 
time? How much grain should he raise? How many 
turtles or goats kill? How many trees fell? How many 
grapes pick and dry? How many lemons gather? Why 
was his gold of no avail? He would have given it all for 
sixpennyworth of carrot or turnip seed, a few beans 
or peas, or a bottle of ink. How did his possessions 
compare with his needs? How much of all this could 
he enjoy? In what sense was he as wealthy as any one 
can ever be? He wrote: “The nature and experience 
of things dictated to me .. . that all the good things 
of this world are no farther good to us than they are 
for our use; and that . . . we enjoy just as much as we 
can use and no more.’ What effect would these 
thoughts have upon Robinson Crusoe? How might 
his condition have been worse? How did his condition 
compare with what he originally deserved? Upon

  82 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
what now did it depend? So he decided to work pa- 
tiently to supply his needs and to be contented and 
thankful in his solitary life. 
How Robinson Crusoe provided new clothing 
‘ for himself 
There was little new in the second five years on the 
island except his need for clothes. Why had this need 
not occurred sooner? What was the climate on the 
island? Why would he need clothing in the rainy 
seasons? Why clothing at all in the dry seasons? Why 
had he avoided going out in the middle of the day? 
He found that the hot sun would burn and blister his 
skin, that loose clothes which let the air circulate under 
were much cooler than going without. When all the sea- 
men’s clothes wore out what materials could he use? 
What advantage in clothes of goat skin with hair out- 
side in time of rain? In dry season? How would 
he fashion these garments? What would be his dif- 
ficulties in sewing? Why would he especially need head 
covering? Make a pattern of the hat you think he 
designed. His greatest trouble was in making an um- 
brella. Why would he need this in all seasons? Of what 
could he make it? What difficulties would that pre- 
sent? 
When he traveled abroad for a few days, what 
would he need to take with him? How could he adjust 
his clothes to carry powder, shot, saw, hatchet, etc.?

  84 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
How Robinson Crusoe obtained a human companion 
after he had lived alone for twenty-five years 
One day when Robinson Crusoe was about to re- 
turn from the other side of the island he saw the print 
of a man’s foot on the sand. What would he do? 
After he had looked on every side and listened he re- 
turned to examine it again. It was not his fancy, —the 
plain print of a man’s foot —toes, heel, and all—was 
there. Then he began to be terribly frightened. Why ? 
What would he do? He was so scared and ran so fast 
that he never knew afterward how he got into his 
castle, — whether by the rope ladder or by the hole in 
the rock. Why would he not sleep that night? Of 
what would he be thinking? 
For three days and nights he never left his cave nor 
peeped abroad. Why would he need then to go out? 
How would he go when he went to milk his goats and 
get provisions? Of what would he be afraid? He said, 
“The fear of danger is ten thousand times more terri- 
fying than danger itself when apparent to the eyes.” 
Why did he think this? As nothing new occurred and 
his fear lessened, he began to think it perhaps was his 
own footprint. How could he find out? When he found 
it was made by a much larger foot than his own, what 
conclusion must he draw? Some human being must 
have been on the island. Where could he have come 
from? So far as Robinson Crusoe knew, the main- 
land may have been inhabited by savages and prob-
-P-A-G-E-93
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 85 
ably cannibals,— men who ate their enemies. What 
causes might have brought them to his island? Crusoe 
thought the canoes might have been driven there 
by wind or they might have come over there for a 
feast. 
In either case, what effect would it have on Crusoe’s 
life? On the amount of provisions raised? Kept in 
store? On his use of his muskets? On his traveling 
about? On his equipment when going about? On his 
thoughts? What preparations and plans would he 
make against possible attack? Read extracts giving 
some of his thoughts and plans. 
During the years of these preparations Crusoe sev- 
eral times found places where a number of people had 
been on the other side of his island, found remains of 
fires and human bones scattered about; but not until 
he had been twenty-five years on the island did he see 
any of the people themselves. Read of the rescue of 
Friday up to where Friday buries the dead savages. 
What reasons would there be for the savages not com- 
ing back for some time? They were superstitious; 
thought their men were killed by thunder and light- 
ning; thought the island inhabited by evil and danger- 
ous spirits. 
Why had Crusoe little to fear from this savage? 
Friday owed his life to Crusoe; he was afraid of Crusoe’s 
gun; he gave signs of allegiance. What were the things 
Crusoe would do for his man Friday? How would he 
teach him to eat? How teach him it is horrible to eat

men? Where should he arrange for him to sleep? How 
make him understand this? What words would he 
teach Friday first? How would he teach him these 
words? Why would he load his gun secretly for some 
time? When would he show Friday how to load it? 
In what ways would Friday make more work? What 
work would Crusoe teach him to do? How would he 
do this teaching? So it was that Robinson Crusoe 
gained the last thing he needed, — human compan- 
ionship. j 
He and Friday lived there happily for many years, 
until finally a ship landed at the island and they were 
taken to England. The rest of his adventures you can 
read for yourself. 
‘ROBIN HOOD 
Teachers will probably wish to increase their knowledge 
of these stories by further reading. Material for this is 
abundant. The old ballads themselves which are often 
quoted here may be read, or some of the many books of 
stories based upon them. 
A casual reading of Robin Hood might lead one to think 
the story unethical, teaching children to admire outlaws. 
A thoughtful study, however, must lead to the conviction 
that it is highly ethical. The first story justifies the choice 
of life made by Robin Hood and his band, if indeed there 
was a choice. In the decisions which King Richard reaches 
concerning them in the next to the last story are summar- 
ized the many admirable and desirable qualities which they 
possessed, while few traits can be found to deplore in these 
very human men.

Stories oF THE Famous Arcuer, Rosin Hoop, ann 
His Banp or Merry BowMEN, wHo Lone YEARS 
AGO DWELT DEEP IN THE Forest or SHERWOOD 
How they came to live in the forest 
How do you suppose that happened? They may 
have done it because they loved the life; they may. 
have done something wrong; or they may have had 
enemies, 
The Saxon forefathers of Robin Hood were of noble 
blood and some say his father was Earl of Huntingdon. 
They had long possessed the land in peace and happi- 
ness, but now the Norman conquerors had come. What 
changes would that bring to the Saxons as to their best 
houses and lands? As to their work? Their taxes? How 
would they be treated by the Normans? Where do you 
think people got their meat in those days? What would 
the Normans do about that? How would they try to 
keep the Saxons from killing the deer and other wild 
animals, — from poaching, as they called it? These 
guards or caretakers were called foresters. What kind 
of men would be selected? How would they dress? 
What would they do if they caught a Saxon poacher? 
They were usually rough, cruel men, excellent archers, 
and when on duty were clad in Lincoln green. Poachers 
were punished most harshly, one of the lightest pun- 
ishments being to cut off an ear. 
What parts of the country would be the last con-

quered? Where would the Saxons go who could not 
endure such treatment? How would they get food? 
What right would they have to do that? What danger 
would there be in it? One day the foresters found 
where a deer had just been killed. What would they 
do when they found that the tracks led to the house of 
Robin Hood’s father in the edge of the forest where a 
feast was in progress? In the very midst of the Saxon 
merrymaking an arrow whizzed through the window 
and knocked the harp from the hands of an aged 
minstrel. What would the Saxons do? What wish to 
know? The foresters said they had been shouting for 
food and a resting place, but had received no answer. 
Robin Hood, who was peeping from an upper window, 
saw one of the foresters fit an arrow to his bow. What 
did the forester mean to do? Robin Hood sped an ar- 
row which pinned the forester’s hand to his bow and 
all of the foresters disappeared. What effect would 
that have? Not long after this there was a fight 
and many foresters fell, as well as many of the Saxon 
band including Robin Hood’s father. Robin Hood 
escaped. 
So he came to live in the forest. Why would others 
be likely to come? At times his band numbered upward 
of five score strong men. Why would it change from 
time to time? How could they get food? How get food 
not found in the forest? How get money they needed? 
What would they think about taking money from the 
rich Norman lords, churchmen, magistrates and
-P-A-G-E-97
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 89 
knights? They seldom harmed these people and sel- 
dom lost an opportunity to lighten their purses. Why 
would they be easier on some than on others? Some 
who were kindly and honest they even helped. They 
loved to catch some proud old Norman lord and bring 
him against his will to feast with them in the Green- 
wood. Why would they do this? How keep him from 
knowing the way to their hiding place? How could 
they entertain him while there? What would the Nor- 
mans call Robin Hood and his men? What would they 
try to do? Who would befriend him? The poor who 
dwelt about Sherwood feared him at first when they 
heard of his bold deeds, but when no harm came to 
them, and when in need they often found meat and 
money at their doors, they felt quite differently. 
Moreover most of the poor people were Saxons. 
What sort of place would they select for their forest 
home? It was a remote lovely open spot, an acre or 
more in extent, carpeted with grass and flowers, sur- 
rounded by so dense a growth of interlacing trees that 
it was believed no one else had ever seen it. Standing 
out a few paces from the other trees as if it were their 
leader was a splendid oak. This tree they called the 
Greenwood Tree and many a merry feast was had by 
these bold bowmen seated in safety upon the moss 
within its shade, for they were not at all cast down by 
their cruel treatment. 
What rules would Robin Hood need to make to 
govern his band about the treatment of the poor? Of 
 
-P-A-G-E-98

women? Of children? Of honest yeomen? The old 
ballad says: — 
“But Robin Hood so gentle was, 
And bore so brave a mind, 
If any in distress did pass, 
To them he was so kind, 
“That he would give and lend to them, 
To help them in their need; 
This made all poor men pray for him, 
And wish he well might speed. 
“The widow and the fatherless, 
He would send means unto; 
And those whom famine did oppress 
Found him a friendly foe. 
“Nor would he do a woman wrong, 
But see her safe convey’d: 
He would protect with power strong 
All those who craved his aid.” 
What kind of men would Robin Hood wish to add to 
his band? How could he find out truly whether they 
were brave? Good archers? Good with the broad 
sword? Skillful with the quarter staff? When he heard 
of such a man what would he do? How would he get 
him to like it after he had joined? Many a tale has 
been told of these stirring adventures in Sherwood For- 
est. How did it come about that these men ever lived 
there?

How Robin Hood found his right-hand man 
Up rose Robin Hood one fair morn and said: — 
** ‘We've had no adventure these fourteen long days 
Therefore now abroad will I go.’ ” 
    
     
                         What did he mean to do? What preparation should 
he make? Why disguise himself? 
“Bold Robin Hood said to his jolly bowmen, 
‘Pray tarry you here in this grove; 
And see that you all observe well my call, 
While through the forest I rove. 
“Now should I be beat, and cannot treat, 
My horn I will presently blow.’ ” 
What did he mean? How could he let them know if in 
danger? Why did he not take some of his companions 
along? In what part of Sherwood would he be most 
likely to find adventure? Bidding his men adieu, he 
walked briskly into the leafy forest, taking his way over 
hill and vale, until finally his path dipped down to- 
ward a deep stream spanned by a single log. As Robin 
Hood neared this narrow bridge he saw a lusty stranger 
approaching it from the opposite side, striding along 
like a giant and carrying no weapon but a large stick, 
or quarter staff. Which would give way for the other 
to cross? As Robin Hood still advanced, the stranger 
shouted, “Get thee back, varlet, or I’ll hurl thee into 
the stream!”? What would Robin Hood say to that? 
How could they settle it? Where? Robin Hood was

carrying his long bow. Why was that unfair? What 
would the tall stranger say? 
“They happened to meet on a long narrow bridge, 
And neither of them would give way; 
Quoth bold Robin Hood, and sturdily stood, 
‘I'll show you right Nottingham play.’ 
“ «Thou talk’st like a coward,’ the stranger reply’d; 
‘Well armed with a long bow you stand, 
To shoot at my breast, while I, I protest, 
Have nought but a staff in my hand.’ ” 
What would Robin Hood do? 
“ ©The name of a coward,’ quoth Robin, ‘I scorn, 
Therefore my long bow I’ll lay by; 
And now, for thy sake, a staff will I take, 
The truth of thy manhood to try.’ 
“Then Robin Hood stept to a thicket of trees, 
And chose him a staff of ground oak.” 
Why would the tall stranger not cross while Robin 
Hood was cutting his stout oak staff? How would they 
use these staves in their stout battle? Holding the 
quarter staff near the middle with both hands, one may 
lunge or parry either to the right or left. What now do 
you expect to happen? Robin Hood said: — 
“ Lo, see my staff is lusty and tough, 
Now here on the bridge we will play; 
Whoever falls in, the other shall win 
The battle, and so we’ll away.’ 
“ “With all my whole heart,’ the stranger reply’d, 
‘I scorn in the least to give out’; 
This said they fell to’t without more dispute 
And their staffs they did flourish about.

“‘At first Robin he gave the stranger a bang,, 
So hard that it made his bones ring. 
The stranger he said, ‘This must be repaid, 
I'll give you as good as you bring.’ 
“Then to it each goes, and followed their blows 
As if they’d been threshing of corn. 
“The stranger gave Robin a crack on the crown, 
Which caused the blood to appear; 
; Then Robin enraged, more fiercely engag’d, 
And follow’d his blows more severe. 
“So thick and so fast did he lay it on him. 
With a passionate fury and ire; 
At every stroke he made him to smoke 
As if he had been all on fire. 
“O then into fury the stranger he grew, 
And gave him a terrible look; 
And with it a blow that laid him full low, 
And tumbled him into the brook.” 
What would the tall stranger say to Robin Hood? 
What would Robin Hood answer? What would he do? 
“ *T prithee, good fellow, O where art thou now?’ 
The stranger in laughter he cry’d. 
Quoth bold Robin Hood, ‘Good faith, in the flood, 
And floating along with the tide. 
“ *T needs must acknowledge thou art a brave soul, 
With thee I’ll no longer contend; } 
For needs must I say, thou hast got the day, 
Our battle shall be at an end.’ 
“Then unto the bank he did presently wade, 
And pull’d himself out by a thorn; 
Which done, at the last he blow’d a loud blast 
Straightway on his fine bugle horn.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Why did he do that? What would the men see when 
they came? What want to know? What would Robin 
Hood tell them? When they heard what had hap- 
pened to their master, what would they want to do? 
What would Robin Hood say to their giving the tall 
stranger a drubbing and a ducking? 
. » « “Robin Hood cries, 
“He’s a stout fellow; forbear. 
“*There’s no one shall wrong thee, friend, be not 
afraid; 
These bowmen upon me do wait; 
‘There’s threescore and nine; if thou wilt be mine, 
Thou shalt have my livery straight,

Speak up, jolly blade, never fear. 
T’ll teach you also the use of the bow, 
To shoot at the fat fallow deer.’ 
“*O, here is my hand,’ the stranger reply’d, 
T’ll serve you with all my whole heart.’ ” 
When the men heard Robin Hood’s fair words and 
heard the tall stranger accept Robin Hood’s invita- 
tion to join his band, they shouted their approval. 
What did they know about the tall stranger? What 
else would they want to know? His skill in other sports 
and his name. Why do you think they all laughed

ing of Little John? What sports? What food? What 
songs? Where would Little John sit? What would 
happen if they played roughly with Little John? What 
all would they find out about him? And so it turned 
out that Little John became Robin Hood’s best man 
and always sat at his right hand at their merry

one of these in Lincoln Town. What would his men

The day of the great match dawned clear and bright. 
Who would be coming into Nottingham? Where from? 
How would they look? How would the field of contest 
be arranged for these sight-seers and archers? Let us 
make a diagram of this. Where place the target? How 
large would you expect this target to be? How marked? 
What would the marks mean? It was probably cir- 
cular and about two feet in diameter. In the center 
was a small black circle, the bull’s-eye. Around this a 
white circle, then a black one, then another white one. 
How high would this target be placed? The range was 
to be one hundred fifty paces. Where would the arch- 
ers stand? Behind the archers was a large tent gay 
with flags and streamers. What was this for? The 
range was twenty-five paces broad. Where would be 
the benches for the onlookers? How placed? Where 
would the Sheriff sit with his dame and followers? How 
would this be set apart?

The match had been so widely proclaimed that the 
Sheriff found nearly a hundred archers assembled near 
the tent. What would he look for? What say to his 
companions? How would they explain not seeing Robin 
Hood? Large crowd; people moving about; many for- 
esters dressed in Lincoln green. Soon the herald an- 
nounced the rules for the shooting. What rules would 
you suggest for handling so many archers? The herald 
stood forth and called in a loud voice, “Each man 
shall shoot once from yon mark to the target one hun- 
dred fifty paces distant. From all these the best eight 
shall shoot a second round. The four best of these shall 
shoot a third time and the silver arrow shall belong 
to the winner.”’ Now, let us be sure that we know the 
rules. What were they? 
When would the Sheriff expect to recognize Robin 
Hood? When the eight best were chosen the Sheriff’s 
men reported to him that two were Norman foresters; 
two were well known and famous archers, — Gilbert 
of the White Hand and William of Trent; two of the 
men with peacock’s feathers in their caps said they 
came from London Town and each was too small to be 
Robin Hood; the seventh wore a raven’s feather in his 
cap and refused to tell whence he came; while the 
eighth was dressed wholly in red with a red feather. 
He, however, had gray hair and beard, while every one 
knew well that Robin Hood’s hair was the Saxon yel- 
low. What would the Sheriff say about Robin Hood 
at this report?

“« “Ay,” quoth the Sheriff, and scratched his head, 
‘I thought he would have been here; 
I thought he would, but tho he’s bold 
He durst not now appear.’ ” 
And now began the contest of the best eight, and 
finer shooting was never seen in Nottingham. The 
four winners were proclaimed to be William of Trent, 
a Norman forester, Red-feather and Raven’s-feather. 
For which ones would the people shout? What would 
they cry? “‘ Hey for William!” “My belt on the Red- 
feather!’ “‘Ho, the Raven’s feather wins!” Which 
one would be the Sheriff’s favorite? What could he do 
to get the Norman to shoot better? Why would this 
part of the match be the most exciting? The teacher 
should read, or otherwise give, some vivid description 
of the shooting of the four best archers and the winning 
of the prize by the man wearing the red feather. 
What would the Sheriff say as he presented the 
arrow? How could he use such an excellent archer? 
What then would he ask? What would the gray- 
haired stranger answer as to his name? As to accept- 
ing service with the Sheriff? 
How would the Sheriff feel about the success of his 
shooting match? What are some of the things the 
guests in Nottingham that evening would say about

among the men surrounding the Sheriff. A small scroll 
was removed from the arrow and handed to the 
Sheriff. What do you think was written upon this 
scroll? The Sheriff unrolled it and read: — 
“Now, hearken well, my gentlemen, 
To deeds of Robin Hood: 
The silver arrow hangs to-night 
On a tree in Sweet Sherwood.” 
That night was gathered in Sherwood Forest a 
merry motley band. How do you suppose the others 
had been disguised? When the leader of them all 
threw off his red garments, showing fresh Lincoln 
green beneath, and shook the red feather from his cap, 
he said, “The clothes are easily changed, but powder 
in the hair taketh much trouble to remove.” 
What had been the Sheriff’s plan? How had it 
worked? 
How Robin Hood turned butcher 
Why would Robin Hood have to be especially care- 
ful after the shooting match? Nearly a year passed 
therefore before Robin Hood or any of his band ven- 
tured outside of Sherwood Forest near Nottingham. 
How could they spend this time most profitably? All 
this practice made them wonderfully skilled in arch- 
ery, wrestling, in the use of the quarter-staff, and in all 
feats of skill and strength. 
Why was it important for Robin Hood to know what 
was going on outside the forest? How could he safely

visit Nottingham? So at peep of dawn one fine day in 
June, Robin Hood, disguised as a beggar and with 
cudgel in hand, strode blithely along the highroad at 
the edge of Sherwood where he came upon a young 
butcher driving a new cart all laden with sweet fresh 
meat. How would they greet each other? What 
would Robin Hood want to know? He learned that 
the young butcher was on his way to Nottingham, 
where he hoped to sell his meat in the market. What 
would the butcher want to know? Would Robin 
Hood tell his name? What do you think the butcher 
would say when he heard that it was Robin Hood? 
What would Robin Hood say when he saw how 
frightened the butcher was? The butcher ought to 
know that Robin Hood would not harm an honest 
man. 
It came into Robin Hood’s mind that it would be a 
merry adventure to turn butcher for a day, and per- 
haps that would be even a better disguise than his own. 
What would he enjoy about it? How could he play 
butcher? What then would he say to the young man? 
When the butcher agreed to sell what would they do? 
As the butcher saw Robin Hood drive merrily away 
toward Nottingham Town what would he do? He 
might go home and tell of his unusual experience, or he 
might think it would be fun to go to Nottingham to see 
what happened. What danger would this be to Robin 
Hood? How could he make it safe? With a bugle 
blast he called Will Stutely and gave the butcher over

to him. How long would he be detained? What would 
Robin Hood do upon arriving at the market place? 
When his meat was arranged how could he attract 
customers? How would his prices compare with those 
of the other butchers? Why do you suppose he had 
different prices for different customers? He clanged 
his steel and heavy cleaver and sang out his prices 
most merrily. What would he say in such a song? 
What effect would this have upon the sale of his meat? 
What would the other butchers think? 
All the butchers had to dine at the Guild Hall on 
market days and the Sheriff never failed to charge 
each a round price for the same. Why would this 
new butcher be invited? What do you think about his 
going? What would the Sheriff hear about the new 
butcher as the guests began to arrive? How had this 
stranger injured the business of the butchers that day? 
What would the butchers think about the price of the 
dinner that evening? What reason is there for think- 
ing Robin Hood would be sorry for that? How could 
he make it right? 
** “Come, brothers, be merry,’ said jolly Robin, 
‘Let us eat and never give o’er; 
For the shot I will pay, ere I go my way, 
If it costs five pounds and more.’ ” 
How would the Sheriff think he might use such a 
prodigal butcher to his own advantage? So he had the 
new butcher sit by his side and asked him many ques- 
tions.

“ ‘Hast thou any horn beasts,’ the Sheriff he said, 
‘Good fellow to sell unto me?’ 
“Yes, that I have, good Master Sheriff 
I have hundreds two or three. 
“And a hundred acres of good free land 
If you please it to see; 
And I’ll make you as good assurance of it 
As ever my father made me.’ ” 
What would the Sheriff think the young butcher 
meant? What did he mean? Why would the Sheriff 
offer only a small price for the cattle? What do you 
think Robin Hood then began to plan to do with the 
Sheriff? How could he get the Sheriff to go to Sher- 
wood Forest? What then would he say about the low 
price of two hundred pounds the Sheriff offered? Why 
would the young butcher insist that the Sheriff take 
the money with him? 
Early the next morning the Sheriff, with the two 
hundred gold pieces in his pouch, met the young 
spendthrift outside one of the gates of Nottingham. 
They set off briskly in the direction of Sherwood 
Forest; the young man, riding the butcher’s gray nag, 
had much ado to keep alongside the Sheriff’s mighty 
bay. What thoughts would come into the Sheriff’s 
mind as he followed his guide into Sherwood? 
“‘Away then the Sheriff and Robin did ride, 
To the forest of Merry Sherwood. 
Then the Sheriff did say, ‘God save us this day, 
From a man they call Robin Hood!’ ”

As they made a sharp turn a herd of a hundred red 
deer sped across their path. What would the butcher 
say? What would the Sheriff do? How could Robin 
Hood prevent his escape? Robin Hood blew three 
clear blasts on his bugle. What would happen? What 
would Robin Hood say to the men when they ap- 
peared? How could they entertain the Sheriff while 
the feast was being prepared? What effect would the 
trial at archery, and the sight of the silver arrow hang- 
ing from the Greenwood Tree, have on the Sheriff? 
Why would Robin Hood order the archery to cease? 
Why would the Sheriff enjoy the rest of the entertain- 
ment? Where would he be placed at the feast? What 
would the men sing? Why would the Sheriff begin to 
feel safe about himself and his gold pieces? As evening 
approached, what would the Sheriff want to do? Since 
he had had such a fine time and such a fine dinner, 
what would he say? Robin Hood said it was the cus- 
tom for their wealthy guests to pay. What would the 
Sheriff say? What do you think Robin Hood proposed 
to charge him? What would he say? What effect would 
this have on the Sheriff? What good reason have some 
of the men for not liking the Sheriff? What could 
Robin Hood remind him of that would make him more 
willing to hand out the two hundred gold pieces? 
Would you have the money counted? Which horse 
would the Sheriff ride away? How could they keep 
him from finding the Greenwood Tree again?

could Robin Hood give the Sheriff as he left him at the 
edge of Sherwood? Why would it be some time before 
this story would be known in Nottingham? 
How Robin Hood changed a sad wedding into a 
merry one 
One day Robin Hood was much surprised to find, 
deep in the forest glades, young Allan of the Dale 
walking with downcast eyes, fetching a sigh at every 
step, and playing doleful tunes on his harp. Ordi- 
narily Allan was— 
“A youngster clothed in scarlet red 
As fine as fine might be 
And he did frisk it o’er the plain 
And chant a roun-de-lay.” 
What would Robin Hood say to him? Allan an- 
swered : — 
“Yesterday I should have married a maid 
But she was from me ta’en 
And chosen to be an old knight’s delight 
Whereby my poor heart is slain.’” 
Why would it seem wrong to Robin Hood for an old 
infirm Norman knight to wed fair Ellen the next day? - 
How do you think the knight had won the consent of 
Ellen’s father? Why would Robin Hood wish to help 
Allan? What plan could they make? 
The next day was dark and the church looked 
gloomy enough as the old monk opened the doors for
-P-A-G-E-113
   SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 105 
the wedding. Why would there be few guests? Why 
had the Norman bridegroom few friends around that 
country? Why would Ellen’s friends refuse to attend? 
Soon the old knight appeared, his crutch rapping 
gruesomely on the flags of the church floor as he scolded 
his attendants. With him was Ellen’s father and the 
Bishop of Hereford, who was to marry them. What 
business must be settled between Ellen’s father and 
the bridegroom? They haggled and bargained, but 
finally the bag containing the gold for the purchase of 
Ellen was placed before the altar. 
While they were absorbed in this a gay young man 
all dressed in scarlet, with a harp hanging at his side, 
wandered into the church. What would the Bishop 
ask him? What would the harper answer? 
“What hast thou here?’ the Bishop then said, 
‘I prithee now tell unto me.’ 
‘I am a bold harper,’ quoth Allan-a-Dale, 
‘And the best in the North country.’ 
“<“O welcome, O welcome,’ the Bishop he said, 
“That music best pleaseth me;’ 
*You shall have no music,’ quoth Allan-a-Dale, 
*Till the bride and the bridegroom I see.’” 
Why was the Bishop so glad to have music? Why did 
the harper refuse to play at once? Why did he sit 
down in a dark corner? At the same time at another 
door a man dressed in Lincoln green came in and sat 
quietly down in the back of the church. 
How would Ellen look as she came into the church

106. THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
with her mother? How walk? How would she be 
dressed? Why would she not see the harper? The old 
Norman knight led Ellen to the Bishop, and he began 
the ceremony by saying, “If any here knoweth rea- 
son why this man and maid should not wed, speak 
now.” What do you think would happen? 
“<This is not a fit match,’ quoth bold Robin Hood, 
‘That you do seem to make here, 
For since we are come into the church, 
The bride shall choose her own dear.’ 
“Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth, 
And blew blasts two or three; 
When four and twenty bowmen bold 
Came leaping over the lee.” 
Then the gay young harper stepped to Ellen’s side. 
***This is thy true love,’ Robin Hood said, 
“Young Allan, as I hear say, 
And you shall be married at this same time, 
Before we depart away.’” 
How would the Norman bridegroom’s objection be 
met? What would the Bishop say about it? How 
would Robin Hood compel him to marry them? When 
the Bishop said, ‘‘ Who gives this maid?” what would 
Ellen’s father do? Who would give her away? 
“Who gives this maid?’ said the Bishop then. 
Quoth Robin Hood, ‘That do I; 
And he that takes her from Allan-a-Dale, 
Full dearly he shall her buy.’” 
What did he mean? When the ceremony was over 
what would Robin Hood do with the bag of gold?
-P-A-G-E-115
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 107 
How would the bride look now? Allan-a-Dale? Who 
would not look so happy? What had the knight lost? 
Ellen’s father? Why should the Bishop have a long 
face? What would Robin Hood say about these long 
faces? He decided to have the sour ones dance. How 
could this be done? So Allan struck a merry tune from 
his harp, Robin Hood twirled his quarter staff threat- 
eningly, and the three began to dance. The exercise 
was unaccustomed, the dancers were reluctant, and 
they were quite stiff and awkward at first; but as the 
music grew faster, as they became warmed with the 
exercise, and as they caught the spirit of the general 
merriment, they began to vie with each other to see 
which one could cut the liveliest capers. 
“And thus having ended this merry wedding, 
The bride looked like a queen, 
And so they returned to the merry greenwood 
Amongst the leaves so green.” 
Tell the story of how it came about that Robin Hood 
and his band always had a harper whenever they 
wished to make merry. 
How Robin Hood added a stout tinker to his band 
Why would it be easy to find men willing to join 
Robin Hood’s band? Which ones would he want? 
How could he know? When he heard of a stout Saxon 
yeoman deft with the cudgels, broad sword or long 
bow, what would you expect him to do? Sometimes 
he met them when he least expected and some more

clever than they looked. One of the old songs or bal- 
lads tells us: — 
“How Robin by a wile 
The tinker he did cheat 
But at the length as you shall hear 
The tinker did him beat, 
“Whereby the two did so agree 
They after lived in love and unity.” 
°T was of a summer’s morn that Robin Hood met the 
tinker along the edge of Sherwood and neither knew 
the other. What would they say to each other? Robin 
Hood said: — 
“Sad news I hear there is abroad, 
I fear all is not well.” 
What could the tinker say? Why was a tinker who 
traveled from place to place a good man for Robin 
Hood to meet? When would it be best for Robin Hood 
to tell the tinker the “‘sad news?” Then Robin Hood 
said: — 
“As for the news,’ quoth Robin Hood, 
‘It is but as I hear, 
Two tinkers were set in the stocks, 
For drinking ale and beer.’” 
Why did Robin Hood say that? What would the 
tinker say? But Robin Hood was so merry that the 
tinker could not be angry long and — 
* All the news I have,’ the tinker said, 
‘T hear it is for good, 
It is to seek a bold outlaw, 
Which they call Robin Hood.
-P-A-G-E-117
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STUDIES 109 
“‘T have a warrant from the king, 
To take him when I can.’” 
How do you suppose the Sheriff had been able to get 
the tinker to try to capture Robin Hood single-handed? 
What would the tinker want to know? What could 
Robin Hood tell him about his size and hair and about 
the danger? What would the tinker say about the 
danger? Why would Robin Hood wish very much to 
get the warrant away from the tinker? It would be a 
merry jest to send it back to the Sheriff with a note 
written on it by himself. The tinker was careful not 
to show the warrant. 
“‘Let me see that warrant,’ said Robin Hood, 
‘I'll see if it be right; 
And I will do the best I can 
For to help take him this night.’ 
“¢That will I not,’ the tinker said, 
‘None with it will I trust, 
- And where he is if youll not tell, 
Take him by force I must.’” 
So they walked along right merrily, the tinker carrying 
a good stout crab-tree staff and Robin Hood his trusty 
blade, until they came to a friendly Saxon inn hard 
by Nottingham, much visited by Robin Hood’s band, 
and nothing loath they entered and began to drink so 
lustily — 
“That the tinker he forgot 
What thing he was about to do; 
It fell so to his lot, 
That fast asleep the tinker dropt.”

  110 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
What would the tinker discover upon awakening? 
What would he want to know about the stranger ? 
What would he say when the innkeeper told him that 
the stranger was the bold Robin Hood? Why had he 
not told him before? What would the tinker do? What 
would the innkeeper say about pay when he started 
to leave? What had he probably said about pay when 
Robin Hood left? What would Robin Hood think 
about the innkeeper being paid twice? Would Robin 
Hood take the sleeping tinker’s money too when he 
took the warrant? If he did how could the innkeeper 
get his double pay? The tinker said:— 
“Or else take here my working bag, 
And my good hammer too; 
And if that I light but on the knave, 
I will then soon pay you.’” 
Not long after, the tinker came upon Robin Hood 
a-hunting of the king’s deer. Upon the spot they fell 
to basting each other quite lustily. The woods re- 
sounded with their mighty strokes for a full hour. 
Robin Hood was sorely pressed, cried “’a’ mercy,” and 
begged the tinker give o’er beating him. What would 
the tinker say to that? But the tinker looked away 
a moment and Robin Hood blew his horn. What 
would Little John and Will Stutely want to do when 
they came up ? Why would Robin Hood not want them 
to double on the tinker? Why not baste his sides at 
all? Why would Robin Hood want the tinker in his 
band? What could he offer him? What would the
-P-A-G-E-119
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 111 
tinker enjoy about such a life? Why should the tinker 
join the band? Robin Hood was lame for many a day, 
but he never tired of telling the story of how the jolly 
tinker came to join his band. What was the story? 
How King Richard came to Sherwood Forest 
All these things took many years and Robin Hood 
had grown from a lad of fifteen to a man of maturity. 
A new ruler, King Richard of the Lion’s Heart, had 
come to the throne of England. How do you suppose 
he came to be called “‘the lion-hearted”? Many years 
he had spent in far-away lands. In his strife for good 
he had passed through stirring adventures; he had 
overcome great dangers; he had known many men 
both good and bad. In what way would this fit him 
well for ruling? What knowledge did he lack? How 
would he gain this knowledge of his own country and 
people? How would Nottingham prepare for such a 
visit? Why would Robin Hood and his men wish to be 
there that day? Why would they admire this king? 
What might they hope from him? Why would you not 
expect the Sheriff to try to capture any of the outlaws 
that day? Why do you suppose Robin Hood was anx- 
ious to have no disturbance that day? How could he 
prevent it?

father had been helped by Robin Hood in time of need, 
offered to tell the king of some of Robin Hood’s ad- 
ventures. What ones would he tell? What would the 
king desire? How could the king arrange to see Robin 
Hood and his men? The king dressed himself as an 
abbot, five of his knights put on the garb of monks, 
and they rode along the edge of Sherwood Forest. Why 
would they put money in their purses? What would 
happen? What would Robin Hood say to the supposed 
abbot when he took his horse’s rein? 
“* Abbot,’ says he, ‘abide, 
I am bound to rob such knaves as you, 
That live in pomp and pride.’” 
What would the abbot say? 
“*We are messengers from the king,’ 
The king himself did say.” 
And Robin Hood? 
“God save the king,’ said Robin Hood, 
“And all that wish him well.’” 
Then the abbot accused Robin Hood of being a traitor 
who could not mean what he had just said. How 
would Robin Hood answer? 
“For I never yet hurt any man 
That honest is or true.’” 
What now would Robin Hood wish to do for the 
king’s messenger? During the feast what would the 
abbot and Robin Hood talk about? What would the

abbot wish to see after the dinner? What would 
Robin Hood and his men be able to show him? The 
final contest was in archery. They set up a willow 
wand as a target at the end of a long range and any 
one who missed must stand and take a buffet. How 
would the men take Robin Hood’s buffet when they 
missed? During the finest archery the king had ever 
seen, Robin Hood himself shot a crooked arrow and 
missed the mark. What would the men demand? 
Robin Hood said he deserved his buffet, but it must 
come from his guest, the abbot. Why would he be 
surprised when the abbot’s buffet tumbled him to the 
ground? As Robin Hood and his men looked in as- 
tonishment at this powerful abbot, King Richard 
threw off his disguise and stood before them. What 
would they all do? 
What do you think King Richard would do about 
Robin Hood and his men? Why had he heard about 
them when he was in distant lands? What would he 
know about them from the stories told at the Sheriff’s 
feast? Which would seem to King Richard the shrewder 
man, Robin Hood or the Sheriff of Nottingham? Which 
the better man? Which would be the more valuable 
servant to a good king? What more had he learned 
about Robin Hood and his men in this journey to the 
forest? What then are all the good things he knows 
about them? Strong, fine, healthy men; excelling in 
all outdoor sports and skill; wise in woodcraft; clever 
enough to outwit their enemies; giving and taking fair

loyal to a good king. What are the bad things he knows 
about them? Why had Robin Hood come to Sherwood 
Forest? Why had others joined him? What must be 
the king’s conclusions? 
How can King Richard make good use of these men? 
How would they compare as king’s foresters with 
those the Sheriff of Nottingham engaged? Why would 
the king choose Little John, Allan-a-Dale and Robin 
Hood to go with him? How would the men take leave

thoughts? King Richard of the Lion’s Heart died and 
another came in his place. What effect would that

The king laughed and asked about the fallow deer, but 
Robin Hood did not answer. 
Where would Robin Hood go? How would he find 
things at the Greenwood Tree? He blew three blasts 
upon his bugle. Upon what occasions had he done that 
before? This time forest and hill caught up and re- 
peated the notes until they were lost in the distant 
glades. He blew again but there was no response. A 
third time he blew, and Little John rushed into his 
arms. What would they say to each other? Little 
John had heard of Robin Hood’s return to the forest 
and could not live without his master. What places 
would they visit together? What would these visits 
make them think? What effect would it have on 
Robin Hood’s health?

He set his horn unto his mouth, 
And blew out weak blasts three.” 
What would Little John think at being left at the gate? 
What would the weak blasts make him think? What 
wouldhedo? Nothing could holdhim now; he splintered 
the gate and smashed door after door until he stood at 
Robin Hood’s side. What would he see? What would 
he soon know from Robin Hood? What would he do? 
“© boon, a boon?’ cries Little John, 
“Master I beg of thee, 
It is to burn fair Kirkley-hall, 
And all their nunnery.’” 
What would Robin Hood say to that? 
“Now nay, now nay,’ quoth Robin Hood, 
‘That boon I’ll not grant thee; 
I never hurt woman in all my life, 
Nor at my end shall it be. 
‘But give me my bent bow in my hand, 
And a broad arrow I’ll let flee; 
And where this arrow is taken up, 
There shall my grave digg’d be.

With a green sod under my head; 
That they may say when I am dead, 
Here lies bold Robin Hood.’” 
What then would Little John do? 
“These things he readily promised him, 
Which did bold Robin please; 
And then he buried bold Robin Hood 
Near to the fair Kirkleys.” 
Why do yousuppose no one knows exactly where he was 
buried? Why do you suppose several different places 
are pointed out as his burial place? No one really 
knows where or how he died, but this story is the 
one most frequently told. And no one knows exactly 
what was written on the stone that covered his grave.

All reading references are to Bryant’s translation of The

serious trouble came to the Greeks, and for How Troy was 
finally taken, may be found in Bulfinch’s Age of Fable or 
Guerber’s Myths of Greece and Rome. Those parts have been 
chosen which are most often referred to, which seem to be 
the most vitally interesting to children, and which make a 
continuous story. The part played by the gods has been 
purposely omitted. This makes the story much less compli-

Way trae Great City or Troy was BESIEGED 
AND HOW IT WAS FINALLY TAKEN 
How a wedding among the gods started the trouble 
A long time ago people did not believe in one God 
as we do now. They thought there were many gods: 
one who drove the sun through the sky each day to 
give light and heat; another who lived in the sea and 
caused the great waves to rise and sink; a goddess who 
cared for the trees and flowers and made the grass 
grow. They thought, too, that there was a great father 
god, Jupiter, a goddess, Eris, whose business it was to 
make trouble, and many others. 
At one time a god and goddess were to be married. 
Who would be invited to the wedding? Why not Eris? 
What would Eris do? Just how do you think she would 
make trouble? When the guests were assembled at the 
wedding feast, Eris caused an apple made of gold to be 
thrown into their midst. Upon this apple was written,
-P-A-G-E-127
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 119 
“For the most beautiful.’ How would that make 
trouble? When the confusion had somewhat subsided 
all had given up the claim to the apple except the three 
most powerful goddesses. These were Minerva, the 
goddess who made men wise; Venus, the goddess of 
love; and Juno, who gave men riches and power. How 
could they settle the question? They asked Jupiter to 
decide. What reasons would he have for not wishing to 
do so? He sent them for a decision to Paris, a shepherd, 
who was tending his flocks on a hill not far away. 
What do you think the goddesses would say to Paris? 
Minerva offered to make Paris the wisest man in all 
the world if he would say the apple should be hers; 
Juno promised him wealth and power above all men if 
the apple should be hers; and Venus said he should 
have for his wife the most beautiful woman in the 
world if he would declare that she deserved the golden 
apple. Why was this not right? What do you think 
Paris would decide? How ought he to decide? In- 
stead of trying to discover which one was most beauti- 
ful, Paris thought only of which gift he would prefer, 
and finally gave the apple to Venus. 
How Venus’s promise to Paris was fulfilled 
What was promised to the shepherd boy, Paris? 
Why does this seem strange? What, then, do you need 
to know next? Who the most beautiful woman was, 
and how a poor shepherd boy could win her. The most 
beautiful woman was the Greek, Helen. Her beauty

  120 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
brought many suitors for her hand. While these, the 
greatest of the Greek warriors and chiefs, awaited her 
decision they entered into an agreement suggested by 
Ulysses. They took an oath together that when Helen 
had made her choice from among them, all the others 
would defend Helen and her husband from any injury 
and be ready to avenge their cause if need should arise. 
Helen chose Menelaus, and the other suitors went to 
their homes. 
In order to learn how a poor shepherd boy won 
Helen, we must go back in our story. Many years be- 
fore the decision of Paris, a child was born to the king 
and queen of Troy. How would King Priam feel about 
this son? People believed in prophets in those days. 
One of them prophesied that if this prince lived and 
grew up, he would cause the destruction of Troy. What 
ought Priam to do? When he finally decided to give 
up the child, what directions would he give the servant? 
What ought the servant to do? When the baby smiled 
. at him, what would be the servant’s thoughts? In- 
stead of obeying orders he placed the child under a 
tree in the depths of the forest and ran home. What 
did he think would happen? But a shepherd heard the 
child’s cries, took him to his home, and brought him 
up to help tend his flocks. Who do you suppose this 
was? 
Some time after the decision about the apple, when 
Paris was grown, he learned that he wasa prince. What 
would he do? How would King Priam receive this
-P-A-G-E-129
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 121 
handsome, stalwart son? Many years had passed, the 
child was grown, Troy was safe, so the prophecy was 
thought to have been false. What opportunities have 
his brothers and sisters had which Paris had missed? 
So Paris wished to travel and visit other lands. How 
would King Priam fit him out for the journey? How 
would this prince, traveling in such magnificence, be 
received where he visits? He finally came to the court 
of Menelaus in Greece. After being his guest for some 
time, Paris persuaded Helen to leave Menelaus, go 
with him to Troy, and be his wife. Now what would 
Menelaus wish to do? From whom could he expect 
aid? 
How Menelaus got one of Helen’s former suitors to 
join the expedition against Troy 
Several years had elapsed since the agreement of the 
suitors. What reasons can you see why some of them 
might not wish to go? Ulysses had married, had a 
young son and pleasant home. When he heard the 
messenger was coming to demand that he go to fight 
against Troy what could he do to avoid keeping his 
agreement? Ulysses probably thought of many of the 
plans you have suggested. He finally decided however 
to harness a horse and a cow to a plough, plough up the 
sand on the seashore, and sow salt in the furrow. When 
the messenger saw what Ulysses was doing what 
would he think? How could he find out if he was 
really insane? The messenger put the infant son of

  122 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Ulysses on the sand directly in front of the strange 
team. What would Ulysses do? What would the 
messenger know? What say to Ulysses? So Ulysses 
gathered together his followers and servants and pre- 
pared to join the expedition. The teacher may tell how 
Ulysses got Achilles to go. 
How the prophecy begins to be fulfilled 
What connection is there between these stories and 
the prophecy at the birth of Paris? What prepara- 
tions would the Greeks make? Collect ships, men, 
armor, food, etc., ready to sail for the far-distant Troy. 
What Greeks do you know? Why would they not 
choose Menelaus as leader? Why not Ulysses? 
Achilles? Neither did they choose the mighty Ajax, 
nor wise old Nestor; but Agamemnon, the brother of 
Menelaus, was chosen. 
What Trojans do you know? Priam was an old man 
and his oldest son, Hector, was leader of the Trojans. 
Lead the children to make a mental picture of the 
walled city, great plain in front leading down to the 
sea, Greek ships in harbors, Greek tents on the plain 
near the sea, many small unprotected villages near 
Troy. Make a sketch of this on the blackboard. The 
Greeks fought with the Trojans on this plain for nine 
years. What were the Greeks trying to do? Conquer 
the city and take back Helen. What would the Tro- 
jans try to do? Protect their city and either destroy 
the Greeks or discourage them so that they would re-

turn to Greece. Thus far neither had been successful. 
How would the Greeks get supplies during all this time? 
Conquer small villages and take food, clothes, armor, 
jewels and women as slaves. What would they do with 
these spoils when they went back to their tents? 
Divide among the leaders. So it was at the beginning 
of the tenth year of the war. 
How serious trouble came to the Greeks 
(Book 1, lines 1-436) 
Among other things two beautiful women had been 
taken at the sacking of a village. One of them, Briseis, 
fell to the lot of Achilles, and to Agamemnon was given 
Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo. What 
would the priest do? How do you think Agamemnon 
would answer? Read lines 34-42. What now could 
the priest do? Read lines 46-55. How do you think 
Apollo would avenge him? What would the Greeks do 
when the animals and men were dying? Why would 
Calchas, the soothsayer, be called upon to speak at 
the council? Why would Calchas be afraid to tell what 
the trouble was? Read lines 96-106. What should the 
Greek chiefs do? Read Achilles’ offer of protection, 
lines 107-118. What would Calchas then tell? What 
do you think Agamemnon would say to the other 
Greeks? To Achilles? What could Achilles suggest to 
make it fair? When they next took a city, Agamemnon 
should have double share. Read Agamemnon’s an- 
swer, lines 171-184. What would Achilles now answer?
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Read lines 209-223, Agamemnon’s reply, lines 225- 
243, and Achilles’ final threat, lines 306-312. What 
now will be done by Agamemnon? By Achilles? When 
Chryseis was returned to her father the pestilence 
ceased. Whom do you think most to blame in this 
quarrel? How would it affect the tenth year of the 
war? The Greeks lost the aid of one of their greatest 
warriors with all his men. 
How Hector made a plan to end the war 
(Book m1, lines 1-468; 550-566) 
Even though the loss of Achilles put the Greeks at 
a disadvantage, the contest continued without any 
decisive victory for either side. What would be the 
effect of this long siege on the Trojans? What plan 
could Hector suggest to help matters? Sometimes 
wars were decided by a battle between two champions, 
one from each side. Compare with David and Goliath. 
What Greek and what Trojan should join in this single 
combat? So Hector proposed. Read lines 109-129. 
Just how was this to decide the war if Paris won? If 
Menelaus won? What arrangements must they make 
for the combat? Position of combatants, terms, etc. 
Whom would you choose to measure the space and 
make arrangements? Hector and Ulysses did this. 
Children here picture the position of two armies, of the 
combatants, of Hector and Ulysses making arrange- 
ments. How would they decide who should hurl the 
first spear? How would Paris and Menelaus prepare

for the combat? Read lines 392-425. Who do you 
think would be the conqueror? Read lines 426-456. 
Just then the band that held the helmet to Paris’ chin 
broke. What would happen to Menelaus? The Greeks’ 
and Trojans’ eyes were on him as he fell backward 
heavily to the ground. This, and a sudden fog, 
enabled Paris to steal away unseen through the 
Trojan hosts back within the walls of Troy. What 
will Menelaus do when he recovers from his fall? 
Read lines 550-557. 
While these things were going on, who were left in 
the city? Women and the old men. Which ones would 
be particularly interested in this combat? Where 
would they go to see it? What do you think Priam 
would say when he saw Helen coming toward him on 
the wall? Read lines 204-209. What questions would 
the aged Priam ask Helen about the Greek warriors? 
How could he point out the different ones? Read lines 
209-213. What would Helen answer? Read lines 222- 
227. Which of the other ones would Priam notice? 
Read lines 243-249. What then would Helen answer? 
Read lines 250-254, and Priam’s recollection of them, 
lines 255-280. Read Priam’s question about another, 
lines 282-284, and Helen’s answer, lines 286-287. What 
does this show of Priam’s feeling toward the Greeks? 
Of Helen’s feeling? What does it add to our knowledge 
of the different men? 
What had the Greeks and Trojans agreed about this 
single combat? Who would claim the victory? What

would the Trojans say about it? Menelaus did not 
kill Paris. How would this affect the attitude of the 
Greeks and Trojans toward each other? 
How Hector prepared to meet the anger of the Greeks 
(Book v1, lines 180-150; 312-894; 478-640) 
What kind of battle would result? What should 
Hector do to meet the fierce onslaught of the Greeks? 
Read lines 141-147. How did he think the women and 
old men could aid? As Hector entered the gates of the 
city who would meet him? With what questions? 
What could he say to these anxious women? When he 
reached the palace he met his mother first. What 
would she say to him? Read lines 331-341. What 
would Hector answer? Read lines 342-345. What 
would he ask her to do? Gather together the matrons 
and pray for the Trojan armies. 
Whom would Hector then seek? What would he do 
when he found his infant son with the mother? Why 
would the baby refuse to go to his father? Hector was 
in full armor with plumed helmet. What do you think 
Hector would do? He removed his helmet, tossed and 
played with his son, and prayed for him. What would 
this prayer be? Read the description of this scene, 
lines 597-619. What would Andromache now say to 
Hector? What would Hector answer? Read lines 551- 
555; 564-571; and 620-629.

here read of the single combat between Hector and 
Ajax and its result in Book vu, lines 73-398. 
How the Greeks planned to protect themselves and 
their possessions 
(Book vu; lines 400-600) 
After this battle (or combat, if that is read) the 
Greeks and Trojans each held councils. In the Trojan 
council the wise Antenor said: ‘‘ Now we wage the war 
after our faith is broken, and I deem we cannot prosper 
till we make amends.” In what sense had their faith 
been broken? What amends might be suggested? 
“Send we the Argive Helen back with all her treas- 
ures.” What would be said about this? What would 
Paris say? Read lines 452-460. They also decided to 
ask for a truce to give time to bury their dead. Give 
the speech the Trojan messenger would make to the 
Greek council. What answer would the Greeks make? 
Read lines 484-499; 500-513. How would this affect 
the fighting of the Trojans? 
What plan could the Greeks then make for their 
greater protection? If the Trojans pressed nearer to 
the Greek camp, what would be the danger? Suppose 
they took the camp, where could the Greeks go? How 
could the Trojans harm the Greek ships? By throwing 
firebrands. After discussing these things, they decided 
to build a fortification about the camp. Make a black-

As these watch fires blazed through the night before 
the walls, what would the Greeks do? What different 
plans might be suggested in this council? In what way 
might the Greeks get help? Who was to blame for 
Achilles not being there? Aged Nestor dared to counsel

Agamemnon would take his advice? What must he do 
to act on it? Read his offer, Book rx, lines 136-165.

Achilles refused to return. What would you expect to 
happen? Read parts of the description of the battle,

  180 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
“Such was the struggle.” While this battle was 
raging, what would Achilles and his friend Patroclus 
be doing in their tents apart from the others? What 
now could save the Greeks? Patroclus won the con- 
sent of Achilles to take his men, the Myrmidons, and 
join the Greeks. How could they deceive the Trojans 
into thinking it was Achilles? What advantage in this? 
What advice would Achilles give Patroclus before 
going? Read Book xv1, lines 103-112. What effect 
will the coming of Patroclus and the Myrmidons have? 
Dismay to the Trojans; new courage to the Greeks. 
The Trojans were routed and rushed wildly back to the 
city. What would the Greeks do? Under what leader? 
At the walls Hector turned and slew Patroclus and 
took the armor of Achilles which he wore. How do you

ment of Hector’s body, lines 486-499. How would 
Hector’s death affect his parents and family? The 
Trojan armies? The fate of Troy? 
How the mighty Hector was honored at his death 
(Book xxrv) 
Achilles took the body of Hector back to his own 
tents. How could the Trojans recover this? The aged 
Priam decided to go to the Greek camp with rich gifts 
to ransom the body. Why would all the Trojans ob- 
ject to this? What would he take with him? What do 
you think he would say to Achilles? How would you 
expect Achilles to answer? Read lines 243-266; 276— 
279; 285-305; 608-622; 628-661; 730-761; 836-850.

rite.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  182 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
How Troy was finally taken 
What do we still wish to know? What do you think 
would happen? How do you think it was done? Let 
us first see what resulted when two of the Greeks 
secretly entered Troy. During these ten years Achilles 
had seen and loved Polyxena, a beautiful daughter of 
Priam. During a truce he went into Troy to ask King 
Priam for her hand. What reasons might Priam have 
for listening to his suit? This might be a way of mak- 
ing peace between the Trojans and Greeks. In the 
meantime Paris had learned something which we need 
to know. The teacher or some child may tell the story 
of Thetis making Achilles invulnerable. When Achilles 
was in the city, what would you expect of Paris? The 
teacher may tell of the poisoned arrow and Achilles’ 
death. 
Ulysses, also, decided to go into the city to see if 
there might not be some other way to take the city 
than by fighting. How would he dare to go? He dis- 
guised himself as a beggar. How would he dress? 
Act? To whom would he talk? What would he say? 
What would he wish to find out? Weakness of walls; 
low places in walls; number and habits of soldiers; 
etc. How could he get this information? He met Helen 
and she recognized him. What do you think she would 
do about it? She not only protected him, but told 
him one of the Trojan superstitions. They had in the 
city a statue to Minerva called the Palladium. They
-P-A-G-E-141
   SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 133 
believed that it had fallen from heaven and that Troy 
could not be taken so long as this statue remained 
within her walls. What questions would Ulysses then 
ask? He learned where the Palladium was; at what 
time there were no people near it; how heavy and how 
bulky it was; where and how he and a comrade could 
steal unobserved into the city. The nex! night Diomed 
and Ulysses stole into the city, secured the Palladium, 
and carried it back to the Greek camp. What effect 
would this have on the Trojans? 
Then the Greeks assembled in council and Ulysses 
presented his plan. He proposed that they build a 
huge wooden horse as a pretended peace offering to 
Minerva for having stolen her statue; that they con- 
ceal within this one hundred men; and that the rest of 
the Greeks go aboard their ships and set sail as if bound 
for Greece. He argued that the Trojans would feel 
safe when the Greeks were out of sight and would drag 
the wooden horse into Troy. Then at night the Greeks 
could come out of the horse within the city and open 
the gates for the entrance of the others who would 
return in their ships under cover of darkness. What 
questions and objections would the Greeks raise to this 
plan? 1. Who would take the risk of staying in the 
horse? Ulysses offered to stay as leader and one hun- 
dred others were easily persuaded. 2. How could the 
Trojans know that the horse was intended for a peace 
offering? They decided that one Greek could remain 
and say he was deserted. He could pretend great
-P-A-G-E-142
  184 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
anger at the Greeks and so pretend to reveal their 
secrets; then at the proper time he could signal the 
ships for their return. What characteristics should 
this man have? They chose Sinon, who was fearless 
and a good actor. 3. Suppose the plan should fail? 
How would Ulysses answer that objection? 
The Greeks decided to attempt this plan. How large 
must the horse be built? How arranged within? How 
would the men get in and out? How arrange so they 
could breathe? What else must be inside the horse be- 
sides the hundred men? Where would they store armor 
and provisions? Where would they build the horse? 
At what time of the day would those in the ships set 
sail? What do you think the Trojans would do about 
it? 
Imagine the scene when one morning it was reported 
in Troy that the Greek ships were away out at sea. 
What else would be reported? Why would it be such 
a great treat for all the Trojans to come forth on the 
plain? What would they talk about? What would 
they do? Soon some Trojan guards found Sinon and 
came dragging him toward the crowd. What questions 
would the people ask him? What answers would 
Sinon make? How would he act? When King Priam 
promised him protection what story would he tell? 
What effect would this have on the Trojans? Why 
would some still object to taking the horse into the 
city? Cassandra, a daughter of Priam, was a proph- 
etess — but it was her fate that no one should ever 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 135 
believe what she prophesied. What would be the 
effect of her words as she cried out, ‘If you take the 
horse into the city, Troy is doomed’? Another wise 
Trojan, Laocoén, threw his spear at the horse, saying, 
“T fear the Greeks even when they bring us gifts.” 
What would the men in the horse do? What would 
Ulysses do? When the Trojans heard a hollow groan 
issue from the horse, what effect would it have? As the 
people stood back, fearful and silent, a strange thing 
occurred. Three great serpents came up on the plain, 
caught Laocoén, wound themselves around him and 
his sons, and crushed them. What would the Trojans 
think that meant? What would happen? Wild clamor; 
the mob dragged and pushed the horse to the walls; 
tore down the sides of the gates, and pulled the horse 
into the city. How would they spend the evening? 
The deep sleep following the feast was the opportunity 
for the Greeks within the horse. What would they do? 
What would Sinon do? What would happen? The city 
was easily taken. The Greeks took jewels, rich gar- 
ments, many slaves, and Helen; set fire to the city and 
sailed for their Grecian homes. Such was the fall of 
Troy.

Let us see how Jacob’s property helped to make 
trouble. What property do you think he had? Many 
herds of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, and horses, with

made his brother Esau a present of 220 goats, 220 
sheep, 60 camels, 50 cattle, and 30 asses. How would 
all these be cared for? A large number of shepherds 
would be necessary to control the flocks and herds, 
to keep them moving to the best pastures, to keep

to take care of the products, wool, milk, and cheeses; 
and a large number of trained men of war to protect 
them from attack by hostile tribes or peoples. Jacob’s

grandfather had six hundred trained men of war. How 
would you estimate from this the number of people 
that Jacob controlled? The children should see that 
the trained men would include most of the strong men 
from seventeen or eighteen years of age to thirty or 
thirty-five. This would exclude all the women, the 
children, the men over this age, and the weak ones, 
perhaps about nine tenths of all the people. What 
would be Jacob’s relation to all these people? He was 
the ruler, the king, the chief of the tribe, and was called 
the Patriarch. 
If Jacob should die, how should the property be di- 
vided among the twelve sons? What should become of 
the rulership? The children will see after considera- 
tion that dividing the rulership would not be advisa- 
ble. How should the property of the one who became 
ruler compare with the property received by the other 
sons? As a rule, which one of the sons should become 
the new ruler or chief or patriarch? Where does this 
custom exist to-day? This was called the birthright in 
Jacob’s time and to-day we have the crown prince or 
the heir to the throne. 
This custom had been broken once. Jacob himself 
had an older brother, Esau. The mother, Rebecca, 
loved Jacob most and was very anxious to have Isaac, 
the father, give him the birthright, but as Isaac did not 
wish to do it, Rebecca used deception. Read the story 
or tell the substance graphically to the class. Genesis 
27, 1-29.
-P-A-G-E-147
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 139 
What reason is there for thinking that all of Jacob’s 
sons knew about this? Why would it seem easier for 
Joseph to get the birthright than it was for Jacob? 
Which ones of the sons would think about this most? 
How would their thoughts differ? If the eldest son 
worried about this much, what might happen when he 
went to sleep. What are some of the things Reuben 
might dream? He might dream of Jacob and Esau; he 
might dream that he was Esau and that he was just 
about to kill Joseph, possibly trying to catch Joseph 
who ran away. Reuben may have had such dreams, 
but his dreams have not been preserved. What dreams 
might Joseph have? He too might dream about the 
birthright. How would his dreams differ from Reu- 
ben’s? They would be happy dreams. He would dream 
that the birthright was his. Read or tell the dream 
about the sheaves. What was the dream really about? 
Do you think he would tell this to his brothers? He 
did. What do you think the brothers would say? Read 
the second dream. What was he dreaming about this 
time? Do you think he would tell this second dream? 
He did tell it to his brothers and also to his father. 
Which would be the angrier? His brothers were the 
angrier, but even his father scolded him. Neverthe- 
less, Jacob thought it rather bright in him, he “ob- 
served the saying.” 
What would the brothers now know about Joseph’s 
ambition? He expected to secure the birthright. How 
serious a matter was this? Suppose a younger son of

140 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
an emperor or king wished to supplant the crown 
prince, and told his scheme to his friends who could 
bring their followers to help him. If he were caught, 
how would he be punished? Who would attend to the 
matter? Who should do it in the case of Joseph? Why 
would Jacob not do it? Joseph was his favorite son and 
the son of his favorite wife; he would remember his 
own experience. Who then must, if it is done? 
We started out to find why Joseph’s brothers hated 
him. Point out the steps by which this came about. 
How the brothers came to sell Joseph 
Tell of Joseph’s being sent to learn how the brothers 
and flocks were getting along. When the brothers saw 
him coming over the hill, what would it recall to their 
minds? The unpleasant relationship which had existed 
between them. Joseph’s ambition and his insolence as 
it seemed to them in flaunting it before them. How 
would such a conversation affect their feeling towards 
him? It was suggested that this was a good opportu- 
nity to kill him. What would they talk over before he 
arrived? If they should kill Joseph, upon whom would 
the greatest suspicion rest? What effect would that 
have on Reuben’s eagerness to have him killed? Reu- 
ben decided to back out altogether. What would be 
the best way for him to do this? Suppose he told them 
he would not allow Joseph to be touched, what would 
they say? 
Possibly you know what they did decide to do. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 141 
What was Reuben’s plan? Reuben thought he would 
save Joseph and not let the other brothers know. What 
did he wish the brothers to think? What do you think 
of that plan? What did it show about Reuben? How 
a lack of moral courage? Having this plan, what 
would Reuben say to the brothers as Joseph came 
down the slope? Read Reuben’s words. What reason 
did he give? Why do you think the brothers agreed to 
that? It would be unpleasant to choke, or club, or 
knife him to death. Let him die of hunger and thirst. 
Which way would be the worst? What does this show 
of the brothers? Whom were they considering when 
they consented to change their plans, Joseph or them- 
selves? What was Reuben’s reason for putting Joseph 
into the pit? What was the brothers’ reason? What 
did they think Reuben’s reason was? When Joseph 
came up, how would he greet them? How would 
they receive him? They surrounded him, seized him 
roughly, pinioned his arms behind him and swung 
him down into the pit. 
How do you think all that has happened would 
affect their supper? They might enjoy it for they had 
accomplished what they had long desired. In the 
midst of the meal a caravan appeared in the distance. 
What idea might the sight of the caravan suggest to 
them? What arguments would occur to them for sell- 
ing Joseph? What conversation do you think would 
take place before the matter was settled? Who would 
do the talking? The caravan leader and the brothers,

  142 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR TEACHING 
After greetings what would the brothers say? “We 
see that you have slaves in your caravan; do you want 
another?” What reply would the leader make? “Let 
me see what you have to sell.” How would they get 
Joseph out of the pit? What would they do when he 
stepped on the ground? When Joseph saw what they 
intended, what would he do? How would the struggle 
result? They would bind him and show him to the 
leader. What arguments could the brothers use to 
secure a good price? They could say that his temper 
was pleasant; call attention to his strength and youth; 
speak of his beauty and fine health; of his unusual in- 
telligence. They finally agreed upon twenty pieces of 
silver. Why was this a good bargain? If the caravan 
chief had been clever enough to size up the situation 
and had said, “TI have all the slaves that I can handle 
but I will take him for accommodation,” what would 
the brothers have said? Or suppose the leader had 
said, “I will take him, but you must give me ten shekels 
for doing it.””, What would the brothers have done? 
Reuben was not present when J coh was sold. Why 
would he not return until after dark? What would he 
do? What would be his feelings when he found Joseph 
gone? Read or tell Genesis 37, 29-30. Now what did 
this tell the brothers about Reuben’s plan? From this 
what seems to have been his reason for wishing to save 
Joseph? If Reuben had really been determined to save 
Joseph, what could he have done?

would most benefit? How did they think Reuben 
would feel about it? What would they think about 
having done such a terrible thing when they learned 
that Reuben was not pleased? Suggest all of the things 
that would increase their remorse over what they had 
done. How would it affect their feeling when they 
thought of breaking the news to their father? As they 
worked over the plan for deceiving him? When they 
saw his anguish? When the neighbors would speak of 
the terrible accident? As year after year went by, what 
would be the effect of this remorse on their conduct? 
Toward their father? Toward each other? Toward 
their neighbors? Toward their cattle even?’ What 
would be the effect upon their industry and honesty? 
In what sense did the brothers tell the father a false- 
hood? Why do you suppose that God did not pre- 
vent this crime? Can you see any reasons for thinking 
that it was better as it was? 
How Joseph changed on his journey to Egypt 
Why was Joseph a great prize as a slave? What pre-. 
cautions would the men take to keep him from escap- 
ing? If the caravan leaders were in haste, how would 
Joseph travel? What would they do with him at night? 
Who would be the last to go to sleep? What thoughts 
would Joseph have to keep him awake? Suppose he 
asked himself squarely who was to blame, what would 
he have to answer? What acts of his own must he 
think blameworthy? What must he say to himself

honestly when he thought of the coat of many colors? 
“T should have said, ‘Now, father, never mind about 
that, do not give me finer clothing than my brothers 
have.’” Suppose the first dream came up in his 
thoughts, will he justify or condemn himself? How 
about his telling the second dream? Suppose he now 
asked himself, “‘ Were my brothers justified in think- 
ing I was ambitious for the succession?” How would 
he answer this question? How would he reach that 
conclusion? What would he have to say then about 
his brothers’ conduct that day? Why should his 
thoughts not dwell on the wickedness of his brothers? 
What then would be his answer to the question as to 
who was chiefly to blame? 
Why would Joseph think that God had permitted 
such a calamity? Had God ceased to love him? What 
then did he think God was trying to accomplish in 
him? What resolutions would Joseph make after he 
thought this out? 
What did Joseph have to look forward to? He would 
be sold into slavery. Why would Joseph prefer to be 
sold to a rich man? What could he do to bring this 
about? He must make himself valuable; he must look 
around for things to do and not wait to be told. What 
effect would that have upon the way he would be 
treated? 
Joseph had worked out his own blame in the matter; 
he saw how God could still love him; he saw how he 
could influence his prospects in Egypt. How would all 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 145 
this affect his state of mind? It would calm him and 
he could sleep. Why had he had no pleasure in the 
journey so far? What pleasure would he be able to - 
get out of the rest of the trip? He would be passing 
through new scenes; there would be an interest in 
thinking of the new things he would see in Egypt. 
What part of the road was familiar to him? The cara- 
van probably passed very near his home. The road 
over which they passed, already many centuries old, 
wound along the crest of the ridge between the Dead 
Sea and the Mediterranean, and gave now a glimpse 
of one and now a glimpse of the other in the far dis- 
tance. 
How Joseph prospered in Potiphar’s house 
What would take place when they arrived in Egypt? 
Picture the slave market to which Joseph was taken 
for sale. Give a conversation between Joseph’s owner 
and a wealthy man who looked at him, letting them 
fail to come to terms. Give a conversation between the 
owner and a rude, brutal-looking man who wanted to 
buy; the owner would not sell. Another wealthy man 
came along and put up the price. The owner sold. 
Who bought Joseph? Potiphar was the commander- 
in-chief of the army, holding one of the most distin- 
guished positions in the realm. Why would this be a 
piece of good fortune? Potiphar’s was one of the 
largest households in the kingdom, numbering many 
hundred members. How would such a household be
-P-A-G-E-154
146 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
managed? It would have to be organiged in some such 
way as a large factory is now organized, with super- 
visors, foremen, etc. As a new slave, where would 
Joseph have to begin? 
What difficulties would there be in the way of his 
advancement? He did not know the language; knew 
nothing of the household customs; would meet with 
the jealousy of the other slaves. What could Joseph 
do to guarantee the most rapid promotion? He must 
learn the language; he must be very careful and con- 
scientious in his work, always obedient and cheerful to 
his superiors. As he was promoted from time to time, 
what should be his attitude toward his inferiors? There 
was constant need of using his best judgment in meet- 
ing situations. Step by step he rose to be head of the 
household. As such what would be his duties? Joseph 
had charge of all purchases for the house. He was re- 
sponsible for the care of the horses and other animals. 
He assigned the work to the slaves, and arranged for 
their promotions. He had charge of Potiphar’s coun- 
try house, landed estates, and revenues. He had over- 
sight of the jailor and guards; settled the disputes of 
slaves and meted out punishment to them. What rea- 
son is there for thinking that all these matters were 
well managed? If they had not been wisely and justly 
dealt with, the matter would have been carried to 
Potiphar, to his annoyance, and he would have given 
the position to some one with sufficient insight into 
human nature and affairs to handle the situation  
-P-A-G-E-155
  SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 147 
successfully. What would be the temptations in this 
position? To show favoritism; having charge of large 
funds he might be tempted to dishonesty. What rea- 
son have you for thinking that Joseph did not yield to 
these temptations? He won promotion; Potiphar left 
everything to him. “And Joseph found grace in his 
[master’s] sight and he served him, and he made him 
overseer in his house, and all that he had he put into 
Joseph’s hand... and he knew not aught he had, 
save the bread which he did eat.” 
Is there any one in your acquaintance who has a 
better position, so far as comfort, freedom and re- 
muneration go, than Joseph had? If so, in what re- 
spect better? How would Joseph dress? What living 
quarters would he have? What kind of food? What 
facilities for travel? What funds at his disposal? What 
would be the attitude of the other slaves toward him? 
What would be the attitude of Potiphar’s friends to- 
ward Joseph? What was the one drawback to Joseph’s 
position? What things had Joseph learned in the dif- 
ficult school in which God had placed him? What 
positive evidences had he that God had not forsaken 
him? He had risen from the position of the lowest 
slave to the highest position in the household. He had 
succeeded in winning the respect of Potiphar. He had 
been compelled to use all the powers he had, and had 
learned to use them for good.
-P-A-G-E-156
148 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
How Joseph came to grief 
How had things gone with Joseph in Potiphar’s 
house? What was the principal drawback in his posi- 
tion? What power had Potiphar over him? It was in 
Potiphar’s power to humiliate him, to have him 
whipped, to sell him, even to take his life. Besides 
Potiphar, whom would he have to obey? Potiphar’s 
wife and children. Suppose Potiphar’s wife should 
order him to do something he thought was wrong, what 
would Joseph do? If he refused, what would happen? 
Who would have to administer this punishment? 
What would Potiphar want to know before he did this? 
What would Potiphar’s wife say? What would Joseph 
say? Which statement must Potiphar accept? So Jo- 
seph was thrown into prison. Who knew of Joseph’s 
innocence? Potiphar’s wife, but she lied; Joseph him- 
self, but was not believed; God, but he allowed him to 
suffer. 
Where do you suppose the prison was? In a castle 
under Potiphar’s authority where the king’s prisoners 
were detained. What reason have you for thinking 
that the keeper of the prison knew Joseph? Which had 
probably held the higher position? When Joseph was 
brought to prison what would the keeper want to 
know? What would Joseph tell him? Which story 
would the keeper be likely to believe? As an inferior he 
would be likely to know his superiors well; he knew 
Joseph’s career; he also knew the reputation of Poti-

SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 149 
phar’s wife among the servants. What effect would 
this have on the keeper’s reception and treatment of 
Joseph? How could he make prison life more pleasant 
and easy for Joseph? Picture Joseph’s life; the amount 
of liberty he was allowed; his duties in receiving and 
dismissing the prisoners. What stories would the new 
prisoners tell Joseph when they came in? What would 
they say about being sent to prison? Why would 
Joseph be likely to know whether or not they were 
wrongly sentenced? He was a judge of men. They 
were servants of other prominent families whom 
Joseph had probably known or members of Potiphar’s 
household who had probably been- under his super- 
vision. Let us see how Joseph interpreted the dreams 
of two of the prisoners. It was the custom in Egypt, 
and is still customary in monarchies, for the Pharaoh, 
on his birthday, to settle the cases of certain prisoners, 
freeing some and having others executed. What ef- 
fect would the approach of Pharaoh’s birthday have 
upon the prisoners? What would they think about 
during the day? What effect would this have upon 
their sleep? What kind of dreams would the guilty ones 
probably have? The innocent ones? One prisoner had 
this dream. Read or tell the butler’s dream. How 
would you interpret the dream? One had this dream. 
Read or tell the baker’s dream. Interpret this. Let’ 
us see how Joseph interpreted these dreams. Read or 
tell Joseph’s interpretation. What would he then ask 
of the butler? What advantage did Joseph have over

us in interpreting the dreams? He knew the men and 
their standing in the community. Read or tell the 
fate of the butler and the baker. 
How Joseph was released from prison and became 
Pharaoh’s chief counselor 
How do you think the power wielded by a Pharaoh 
differed from that wielded by our President? What 
effect would that have upon people’s conduct before 
him? How would officials, perhaps even high ones, 
gain audience with him? What things would they talk 
about? How would the conversations begin? Why 
would the butler need to be particularly careful for 
his own sake? For Joseph’s sake? What then would 
he have to do? Why would Joseph nevertheless think 
much about the butler? 
Find from your geographies what the crops of Egypt 
are, and their size. Find the amount of rainfall. How 
do you account for the fertility? After suggestions are 
made, read in the geography. The Nile is sometimes 
pictured as a god with a great horn out of which he 
pours many kinds of fruits. Explain it. In what sense 
does Egypt herself rise out of the Nile? How would 
the crops differ from year to year? What experience 
had Joseph probably had with crop-growing and crop 
failures? How do you suppose Joseph managed so that 
Potiphar was just as happy and prosperous during the 
seasons when crops were lean as when they were fat? 
How could he be even more prosperous during the lean

years? Why were not all estates managed that way? 
Why should such matters as these in Egypt concern 
Pharaoh? 
About two years after Joseph interpreted the but- 
ler’s dream, Pharaoh had two dreams which troubled 
him much. Why would dreams trouble a man more 
then than they would now? This was the first dream. 
Tell or read Genesis 41, 1-4. And the second dream: 
Genesis 41, 5-7. Why would these dreams trouble 
Pharaoh? How would he go about it to have them 
explained? Tell what you think the butler sees, thinks, 
and does. He sees the king’s gayly dressed messengers 
ride forth on their fine steeds; sees the great priests and 
magicians drive up to the palace in their splendid 
equipages, stay a while, and drive away with down- 
cast attitudes; he sees the king’s countenance change 
and all seems to go wrong about the palace; the king 
is sorely troubled. Why could the butler venture to 
speak? How would he do it? What would he tell 
Pharaoh? 
Tell what you think would happen. The messenger 
would hasten; Joseph would be summoned. How 
would Joseph prepare? How would he be taken before 
Pharaoh? What would Pharaoh say to him? Read or 
tell Genesis 41, 15-24. How would you interpret the 
dreams? Read or tell Genesis 41, 25-31. What reason 
would he give Pharaoh for there being two dreams 
about the same thing? What would Pharaoh think of 
the interpretation? What should Pharaoh do about

  152 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
the matter? This is what Joseph said to Pharaoh. 
Read or tell Genesis 41, 32-36. 
Why would this be a very difficult task? It doubled 
the tax; people generally would not believe; they 
would prefer to use their wealth as it came. What ex- 
perience had Joseph had that would make him a good 
man for this position in Potiphar’s house? In the pri- 
son? In what ways might both of these make it dif- 
ficult? Why would no one else be likely to do this 
work so well as Joseph? What did Pharaoh probably 
know about Joseph? What could Potiphar tell him? 
Genesis 39, 5-6. This is what the king said. Read or 
tell Genesis 41, 37-44. / 
Let us think what changes came to Joseph on that 
memorable day: —

Prisoner Prime Minister 
In a bare prison cell In a sumptuous royal chamber 
Poor The richest man in Egypt 
Honored by none All bowed before him 
A slave A ruler next to Pharaoh 
Why might he easily think he was dreaming? What 
were some of the things in Joseph’s life that must have 
troubled him? The enmity of his brothers; his being 
sold; his being falsely accused; his being thrown into 
prison and his being forgotten there. What benefits 
could he now see in all of these? What things did he 
have to be thankful for during all these years? What 
would Joseph have said that day thirteen years before, 
when going over the fields to his brothers, if some
-P-A-G-E-161
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 153 
divine messenger in human form had asked him how 
he would like to become prime minister of Egypt? If 
the messenger had told him all he would have to suffer? 
What would Joseph think about it now? “My ways 
are not thy ways.” What has he learned to help make 
and keep him a great man? To work hard for the 
prosperity and honor of others; to be humble and self- 
sacrificing; to be strictly truthful and honest; to 
know and to be able to manage difficult people and 
properties; to have faith in God. What were the 
dangers in his new position? What were the main 
things that he would say in his evening prayer about 
the past? About the future? What should he do about 
Potiphar and his wife? 
What would be Joseph’s work for the next seven 
years? What assistance would he need? What com- 
plaints would there be? What effect would they have 
on Joseph? Read or tell Genesis 41, 46-49. How 
would Joseph’s work change after the seven years? 
What would he have to know in order to make the 
grain last? What records would have to be kept? 
Read or tell Genesis 41, 538-57. 
How Joseph’s dreams came true 
To what extent had Joseph’s own dreams been 
realized? What then have we still to find out? What 
reason is there for thinking that it would soon be ful- 
filled? Who would go into Egypt for grain? Why not 
all of the brothers? What are the chances that the
-P-A-G-E-162

brothers and Joseph would recognize each other? 
Joseph may have been expecting them; he would know 
the faces, the dress, and the language. They thought 
that Joseph was either dead or a slave; they would not 
suspect that this highest official could be he; his dress 
and language would be strange and the more than 
twenty years would change him much more than it 
would them. What would the brothers do as they were 
brought before the mighty prince? Read or tell Gene- 
sis 42, 1-6. 
How do you think Joseph should act toward the 
brothers? From the discussion that should follow this 
question, it is probable that three lines of action on 
the part of Joseph would be urged by the children with 
arguments for and against each. One way would be 
to say at once that he was Joseph; the brothers would 
be frightened and he could avenge himself and mete 
out the. appropriate punishment of imprisonment and 
slavery. This would be petty, vindictive, and wicked. 
“Vengeance i is mine,” saith the Lord. What does that 
mean? What if the brothers had grown better; had 
become good men? What do you think of Joseph, as 
we now know him, doing that? Another way might 
be for Joseph to tell who he was, assure them of his 
forgiveness, because they probably thought they were 
justified, and because God had prospered him so 
greatly. The brothers might have been so put to 
shame that they would become upright and true. Or, 
Joseph might have waited until he found out what 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
SOME STUDIES IN TEACHING STORIES 155 
kind of men they were and have acted toward them 
accordingly. 
Which of these ways would be the best? Joseph de- 
cided on the last. What then was his problem? What 
was his last experience with them? How could he 
make them think about that? What would they think 
about being suspected, treated harshly, and impris- 
oned, in the land where Joseph was a slave? How 
could he tell what they were thinking? 
Joseph accused them of being spies. Why should 
Egypt be especially particular about spies at that 
time? How would the brothers try to prove they were 
not spies? How could Joseph find out if what they 
said was true? Read or tell Genesis 42, 7-15. How 
could he be sure they would return with Benjamin? 
Read or tell Genesis 42, 16-17. What would the 
brothers think over in prison? What better plan’can 
you suggest for getting Benjamin? Genesis 42, 18-20. 
Why would the brothers feel free to talk among them- 
selves before Joseph? What would they say about 
the reason for all this trouble? What would Reuben 
especially say? What did they have to trouble them 
about Simeon? About Benjamin? About Jacob? 
About themselves? Read or tell Genesis 42, 21-28.

tion in the matter? What all would the brothers take

at the palace why would the brothers be uncomfort- 
able? Read or tell Genesis 43, 18-34, and Genesis 
44, 1-12. Why did the brothers make such a proposi- 
tion? Why had Joseph had such a thing done? Why 
were the servants ordered to begin the search with the 
oldest? What would the brothers do when the cup is 
found? Read or tell Genesis 44, 13-15. Who was Ja- 
cob’s favorite? What was the danger about the birth- 
right? Why, then, did the brothers not consider this 
a good opportunity to get rid of Benjamin? What 
arguments could they have given for forsaking Ben- 
jamin? What good could the brothers do by return- 
ing? What did the return of all the brothers show 
Joseph? Genesis 44, 16. What would Joseph say 
about such a proposition? Genesis 44, 17. What would 
Judah say to the great prince? Read or tell Genesis

Pharaoh say to that? Read or tell what presents and 
messages he sent and how they all came and were cared 
for in a princely way by Joseph.

  CHAPTER III 
PRINCIPLES OF METHOD INVOLVED IN TEACHING 
STORIES 
Ir is impossible for any large body of students of 
education to see a single actual recitation in such a 
way as to have detailed concrete material for discus- 
sion. While the studies in this volume are not steno- 
graphic reports, they are very largely the identical 
questions that have been repeatedly used in actual 
recitations, the responses of the children being omitted. 
Such a rich body of concrete material as this, therefore, 
offers an unusual opportunity for the discussion of the 
specific principles of method involved in teaching stories, 
While it is probably true that all of the theory of 
teaching is involved in some way in every recitation 
in every subject, certain principles may be much more 
obviously involved in teaching stories than in teaching 
arithmetic; and certain principles may be so involved 
in one story lesson as to control the entire discussion of 
it, while another lesson may be controlled by quite 
different principles. 
The questions in this chapter are presented for the 
purpose of centering the attention of students upon 
the principles mainly involved in these studies, and 
for the purpose of increasing the practical efficiency 
and critical powers of such students.

  158 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
How to determine the relative values of teaching and 
‘ of telling stories 
What effects would be lost if a teacher should first 
tell a story, for example, The Three Billy-Goats Gruff, 
and then put the questions indicated in the present 
study? If she wished to tell the story and still get some 
of these effects, what thought questions could she ask? 
If you should choose to tell any of these stories, what 
further instruction would you base on them? Write 
out some of the best questions you would use. What 
thinking do they require? How do your questions 
compare in number and interest with those in the 
study given here? Which treatment seems to “ana- 
lyze the story to death’?? Which seems to build it up 
naturally and with the forward look? What relation to 
teaching and telling have the two forms of questions, 
What did he do? and, What would he [be likely to] do? 
What dangers must a teacher who is an excellent 
story-teller guard against? What opportunities do the 
studies in this volume leave her for the use of this skill? 
What difference would it make in the value of these 
studies to give the information embodied in them be- 
fore the questions, instead of having the questions 
precede the information: as, for example, reading about 
Hiawatha’s cradle before asking the questions? Why 
is it often necessary to give quite a little information 
before asking any questions? For example, the in- 
formation about Robinson Crusoe’s family in the sec-
-P-A-G-E-167
  
METHOD IN TEACHING STORIES 159 
ond paragraph of the first study. Why is this not 
necessary in the first paragraph of the first study in the 
story of Joseph? Select several questions from Robinson 
Crusoe, The Iliad, or Joseph, the children’s answers to 
which furnish the basis for new thought questions. 
Select several places in the story of Ab where chil- 
dren are given opportunity to use their own experi- 
ences and ideas in building up the story. Which, 
teaching or telling, gives the greater usability to the 
children’s ideas? Which involves the consideration of 
the greater number of ideas? Which involves the 
greater number of associations? In which case would 
the story be the better retained? What habits does 
each tend to develop? 
Why would a child have a keener interest in hear- 
ing Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dreams after 
having tried to interpret them himself? What effect 
would such a procedure have upon his memory of 
that part of the story? 
Point out why the story of Joseph, taught as in 
these studies, would make a stronger ethical appeal 
than when told — as is so generally done. Show how 
the teaching of How Robinson Crusoe built a boat would 
give a deeper insight into the story, and result in 
better moral training, than would be the case if the 
story were told or read. 
Why does teaching a story take so much more time 
than telling it? How can you justify such a use of the 
time?

160 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING i 
How determine the value of questions 
How does thinking differ from mere guessing? What 
is the difference between a thought question and a 
question that leads only to guessing? Of which class is 
“ Just how do you think she [Eris] would make trouble?” 
on page 118? Formulate some thought questions that 
might well be used in Cinderella, or some other fanci- 
_ ful story. Give parts that should not be questioned 
about, with your reasons. 
What constitutes the difference in the value of two 
thought questions? Formulate or select four or five 
questions that would give the whole story of Hia- 
watha’s fasting. Of what value are the additional 
questions in this story? Distinguish between large 
and small questions. Which are the large questions 
and what makes them large? Show how the failure to 
distinguish between these might be wasteful. 
The story of Joseph as generally told begins with 
his dreams. In the present study over fifty questions 
precede the dreams while no quéstions at all are put 
on his trip to Dothan. Discuss the wisdom of this. 
In working over a story to teach, what distinction 
would you make between enriching the text and pad- 
ding the story? Give illustrations. Why not ask the 
question, — What are a lion’s enemies? at the begin- 
ning of the second part of How a mouse saved a lion’s life? 
Why omit the story of Agamemnon’s intended sacrifice 
of Iphigenia in the introductory studies of The Iliad?
-P-A-G-E-169
  METHOD IN TEACHING STORIES 161 
Select another fable similar to The Lion and the 
Mouse and make a plan to teach it. Have another 
teacher criticize it. Select a short story not known by 
your fellow teacher and see if you can build it up in 
her mind by thought questions. Do not let her an- 
swer until all your questions are put, then let her tell 
the story as built up in her mind. 
Select from any of the studies several questions 
that seem to you strong thought questions and show 
just what thinking is involved. Show what demands 
each one necessarily makes on the memory. 
How deal with children’s answers 
Give all the reasonable answers you can that might 
be expected to the question, “‘ How could he [Ulysses] 
avoid keeping his agreement?” on page 121. 
The following is a report of a discussion by a group 
of children, of the question, How could he [the messenger] 
find out if he [Ulysses] were really insane? on page 121? 
“He might set fire to Ulysses’ house.” 
“He might ask Penelope.” 
“Penelope would not tell.” 
“Maybe she did not know.” 
“Tf she did know Ulysses was pretending she would not 
tell.” 
“Tf she did not know she also would think him crazy.” 
“He might give Ulysses some medicine.” 
“Why would he do that?” 
‘Some medicine to cure him from being insane.” 
“He might steal Ulysses’ baby and pretend to run away 
with it.”
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN tl ‘EACHING 
Which of these answers are reasonable? How do they 
differ from mere guesses? Not one is the answer given 
in the story; what then constitutes their value? What 
should the teacher do with such incorrect answers? 
Collect answers given by your pupils that are not 
correct according to the story, yet that you consider 
more profitable than correct answers given in response 
to memory questions. Show in what ways these may 
be more creditable to both pupil and teacher. 
How secure effectiveness in aims and summaries 
To what extent can any one work or think profitably 
without a definite aim or problem or purpose? Select 
at least three places in The Iliad, where children state 
their own aims. Indicate places where they could be 
easily led to do this in Joseph; in Robinson Crusoe. 
Why would children be more likely to state the new 
problems themselves, and to raise questions in The 
Iliad or Joseph than in Robin Hood? Formulate aims 
for the various studies in Hiawatha, where no aims are 
stated, that you think would add to their effective- 
ness. Select five or six of the best lesson problems or 
aims in these studies. Select an equal number that do 
not seem so strong. 
To what extent do you think the aims stated are 
not genuine problems of the children? Why is it more 
difficult to discover aims that arise out of the children’s 
immediate needs in story lessons than it is in arith- 
metic or composition lessons? If you believe that chil-
-P-A-G-E-171
  METHOD IN TEACHING STORIES 163 
dren should feel a need for all lessons, how can you 
justify the use of stories in school? 
Find several instances in these studies in which the 
final question is practically the same as the aim, for 
example, in the first study in Joseph. Why is this 
’yaluable? Find several instances in which the final 
question or questions require a retelling of the story 
from a new point of view, for example, the last ques- 
tion in How a mouse saved a lion’s life; or “What pic- 
tures does this story make you see?” in the second study 
in Ab. In what way is this a more valuable kind of 
summary? Find several instances in which the ques- 
tion or questions in summary require a knowledge of 
the facts not only of that study but also of preceding 
studies, for example, How was Hiawatha’s house better 
than Ab’s? in the third study in Ab. Find instances in 
which a question in the first paragraph of a study re- 
quires a review of some previous study, for example, 
To what extent had Joseph’s own dreams been realized ? 
in the last study in Joseph; or, Why did the Sheriff 
wish to capture Robin Hood? in the third study in 
Robin Hood. What additional drill is needed? 
What opportunities are there in other school work 
to use these stories in a natural way? See the sugges- 
tions at the close of the studies in Ab. Why is this 
better than unmotivated repetition? 
~/ Formulate the principles of method involved in 
teaching stories. To what extent does your formula- 
tion agree with that of your colleagues? 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  CHAPTER IV 
THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
OTHER SUBJECTS 
Tr should be evident from the foregoing discussions, 
in so far as the teaching of stories is concerned, that it 
is possible and desirable for pupils to spend their time 
in constructive thinking directed toward a definite and 
desired end; that the chief instrument in accomplish- 
ing this is the problem or thought question; and that 
by this means tremendous improvement in teaching 
is possible. It may be seriously questioned whether 
the telling of stories by teachers at all as generally 
practiced is time most profitably spent; or, indeed, the 
telling of any large amount of material in a single les- 
son or day unless it is for some purpose conscious and 
genuine to the students or pupils and not purely aca- 
demic. It remains to demonstrate the fact that what 
has been urged concerning thought questions in the 
teaching of stories applies with equal force to other 
school subjects. 
The prevalent textbook method of teaching geo- 
graphy, history, arithmetic, art, manual training, and 
domestic science, in fact all school subjects, does not 
differ essentially from telling. The mental attitude is 
relatively passive, receptive, memoriter, rather than 
aggressive, constructive, thoughtful. It is, of course,
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 165 
admitted that children taught by the text-book and 
memory-question method, and students subjected to 
lecture and quiz and formal laboratory exercises, may 
do some thinking; the amount depending upon the nat- 
ural aptitude and bent of the student. He may even 
be told to use his head, to think; but while the teacher 
thus shows his knowledge of what the student should 
do, he does not, as a rule, make it his business to pre- 
sent the material in such a way as to increase the ten- 
dency and tax the power to think. He raises few if 
any thought-provoking questions, does not break the 
subject-matter up into the problems naturally in- 
volved, is even impatient of questions raised by the 
child or student. Too often the child with initiative 
and individuality is considered slow and troublesome, 
while the child that remembers and is able to give back 
the text or lecture is considered the satisfactory pupil. 
In this way the natural curiosity and inquisitiveness 
of the child is deadened in so far as school work is con- 
cerned. 
While the material of other subjects is not a story, 
it is a connected account of facts and inferences that 
are or ought to be natural, reasonable, and logical. It 
should be even more easy to find situations in these 
fields that, would furnish occasions for thinking by 
' children./ It remains only for the teacher to select 
suitable material, see that it is broken up into the 
problems naturally involved, and allow the children to 
consider them.
-P-A-G-E-174
  
166 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
+ These subjects are the very ones that abound in 
causal relationships, are rich in problem situations, 
rich in opportunities for thinking, and yet taught as a 
tule descriptively by textbook and lecture. They are, 
in general practice, considered as composed of so many 
facts to be absorbed, poured in, or hammered in, and 
remembered. If, instead, these facts of history, geo- 
graphy, nature, and the rest were considered as data, 
or surface symptoms, valuable only as they enable one 
to infer and evaluate the motives, aspirations, and 
purposes behind them in history; the causal relations, 
social, commercial, and economic influences growing 
out of them or revealed by them in geography and na- 
ture; it ‘could be easily seen how rich they are in prob- 
lems and opportunities for interesting, profitable, and 
delightful thought work by children: 
As in the case of teaching stories, so it should be in 
the teaching of all subjects that have thought material 
in them. They should:be taught by the use of the 
thought question in proportion to the opportunities 
afforded. The same rules of procedure hold and the 
same dangers exist.. All advance in thought must be-, . 
gin with the experiences and ideas of the thinker: ‘ 
Questions and problems must be based on these. “Many 
possible solutions follow a good problem. Many solu- 
tions exist for most of our own practical problems and 
it is often puzzling to select. Mistakes are often made 
and problems are usually settled by convention rather 
than by reason, because it is not our habit to think.
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 
Children may arrive at a conclusion contrar, 
fact. This would not only serve to impress the fa 
but might easily show the reason or lack of reason bac. 
of it. A fact as such, a date or a boundary for instance, 
can seldom be profitably thought out. It should be 
told when needed, and it will be remembered and will 
be considered important and significant, in propor- 
tion to the number of vital problems it assists in 
solving. * 
In discussing a problem it is the work of the teacher 
{to keep the question before the class and keep the dis- 
cussion to the point. Her work in preparation is to 
select vital, fruitful problems. 
The practical possibility of the use of the thought 
question or problem in leading children to do aggres- 
sive, constructive thinking should be fairly obvious 
from the following studies. In order to emphasize the 
wide discrepancy between such theory and present 
practice several of these studies are contrasted with 
actual lessons, prepared and taught by regular teachers 
on the same topic, which represent ordinary or better 
than ordinary school work. 
It is an easy matter to talk about the importance of 
questioning; it is not an easy matter, however, actu- _ 
ally to formulate good questions. This is obvious to 
any one who seriously undertakes it. It is rarely, if 
ever, well done if left to the inspiration of the moment. 
( Skill in such work is a matter of slow growth. First 
attempts may easily make the whole matter seem
-P-A-G-E-176
       168 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
ridiculous, yet the chances are that, other things being 
equal, a teacher will gain better results through these 
efforts than by routine memory work. She will have 
a task also of ever-increasing interest.(Unless the in- 
struction of the day in the various subjects is domi- 
nated by the thought question or problem, the value 
of the day’s work is certainly open to question. 
HISTORY a 
(Grade IV) 
Subject — The Pilgrims. 
General aim — To learn about the Pilgrims. 
Specific aim — To learn why the Pilgrims left their homes 
and came to America. 
Presentation. : 
Why did the Pilgrims leave England? 
To what place did they go? 
What was the cause of their discontent in this place? 
What good things had they heard about America? 
Now the Pilgrims, with their leader, sailed for England and 
then for America. Who was their leader? 
About how many Pilgrims were there who sailed? In what 
boat did they sail? 
What kind of a journey did they have across the Atlantic? 
Where did they land? Tell me about the harbor. Before 
they landed what did they do that was very important? 
Whom did they choose for governor? 
Why is it necessary to have a governor? 
The above is a lesson plan prepared by a regular 
teacher of the fourth grade, and is typical of the usual 
treatment of history topics. Judging from the ques-

or by the teacher and children, previous to this les-

son? What thinking is demanded by the questions? 
How much teaching is implied in the lesson? 
Let us consider the possibilities of improvement. 
What would be your aim in teaching fourth grade 
children the story of the Pilgrims? How would this 
determine your selection of facts? Why might the facts 
alone as presented by a school text not accomplish this 
aim? What experiences have ten-year-old children had 
which they could use in building up these new and far- 
away ideas? The original trouble which the Pilgrims 
had largely concerned forms of church worship, and the 
obligation to support a church the forms of which they 
did not approve. What church forms would be repre- 
sented in an ordinary class in public school to-day? 
What could the children tell about the differences in 
form between the Catholic and the Friends Church? 
Between the Episcopal, the Hebrew and the Baptist 
or Methodist? Some people to-day prefer one form and 
some another, but what would they say if they were 
compelled to pay a certain amount of money for the 
support of one they did not approve, when they were 
at the same time helping support the church of their 
choice? Suppose they refused to do this and were cast 
into prison? Suppose a religious gathering of your own 
friends in your own home was broken up and some 
sent to prison? 
What ideas have children which would help them 
to understand the sacrifice of leaving one’s own coun- 
try permanently? Imagine a group of people talking  
-P-A-G-E-178
  
  170 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
about doing this, What would they say about home? 
Friends? Relatives? School? Language? Customs? 
Good opportunities to make a living? Dangers and 
discomforts of travel? 
Why, after all, did only a few of those oppressed 
leave England at first? How would the Pilgrims’ dif- 
ficulties compare with those of a Russian or Italian 
family coming to the United States to-day? In what 
ways is the latter much easier? How much could the 
children find out concerning an ocean vessel to-day, 
from descriptive folders, about size, number of pas- 
sengers carried, sleeping quarters, amount and kinds of 
food carried, ice, coal, cooking and heating apparatus, 
length of time for a trip, etc.?_ What conclusions would 
they reach in comparing this with the Mayflower? 
What is the value of discussing such details? How 
does it enrich our ideas about the Pilgrim father and 
mother? How does it make us appreciate even their 
intolerance when they were established in America? 
Why do such details as those suggested above make 
unnecessary such memory questions as: “To what 
place did they go?” “About how many Pilgrims 
sailed?” “In what boat?” ete. How could you justify 
omitting entirely from fourth grade work the trip to 
Holland and the sojourn there? 
Make a complete plan for teaching the history les- 
son as suggested above, formulating all your large 
questions. After teaching the lesson criticize your re- 
sults on the basis of the children’s interest; their desire
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 171 
to know more history; their knowledge of necessary 
historical facts. Criticize your results on the basis of 
the children’s mental activity, whether receptive or 
aggressive; as to the amount and quality of actual 
thinking. To what extent was your success due to 
richer material? To what extent was it due to the use 
of thought questions? 
COMPOSITION 
(Grade IV or V) 
These two lessons are based on the story of the wed- 
ding of Allan-a-Dale in Robin Hood. They assume that 
the story has been taught. 
I 
According to ordinary practice the teacher would 
ask several children to repeat the story, possibly ask- 
ing some memory questions about it and inserting 
omissions; put the title and possibly an outline of the 
story upon the blackboard; give the children paper 
and pens and direct them to write the story. 
# | 
Using thought questions the lesson might proceed 
as follows: — 
Which people in the story might sometime wish to 
tell this tale? To whom would each one tell it? The 
Bishop might report to a higher authority or tell the 
story to some of his brethren; Ellen might explain to 
her friends how she came to marry Allan pier all;
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Robin Hood might entertain King Richard with the 
tale; Allan-a-Dale might put it into a ballad to sing; 
etc. Why would one scarcely recognize the story if the 
old Norman knight had to explain why he had not 
married? 
Suppose the Bishop decides to report the case in 
writing to the Archbishop at once. How do you think 
he would be feeling about it? If he were angry how 
would he wish to influence the Archbishop? What 
points in the story, then, would he emphasize? The 
rights of the Norman knight; Robin Hood’s strength 
and his lack of respect for the law, the church, and the 
Bishop. What parts of the story would he leave out? 
The age and infirmity of the Norman; the youth and 
beauty of Ellen and her promise to Allan. What sort 
of words would the Bishop choose for his report to the 
Archbishop? How might he begin the report? “Most 
Reverend Sir,” or “To His Grace, the Archbishop, 
Greetings!” Why would such a report be brief? Give 
the report as you think he wrote it. 
Suppose, instead, the Bishop told the story to some 
brethren long years afterward when Robin Hood had 
been pardoned by King Richard. Why might his feel- 
ing be different? What would his purpose be then? 
Entertain his friends. Why would this tale be longer 
than his report? In what respects would his language 
be different? What points in the story would he em- 
phasize now? Absurd experience recalled; strangeness 
of the old dark church; his hope for relief through

THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 173 
music when the gay young harper sauntered in; odd 
appearance of the bridal party; Ellen’s downcast looks, 
the quarrelsome old Norman, the few attendants; the 
change when Ellen recognized the harper; his own 
quick recognition of justice that made him marry the 
couple, ete. What points would he omit now? Tell the 
story as you think he told it. (Give opportunity for 
different members of the class to tell parts of this, and 
to discuss the effectiveness and suitability of one an- 
other’s attempts.) 
Let us now take the subject, “Ellen explains to her 
friends how she came to marry Allan.” What parts of 
the story would she tell? Her feelings — great sad- 
ness, surprise, joy. What parts of the story would she 
probably forget? What parts might she never have 
known? Things which happened before she came to 
the church, her father’s bargaining, etc. How would 
her language differ from that of the Bishop? Tell 
-Ellen’s story. (Have discussion as indicated above.) 
This plan is sketchy and incomplete but it is suffi- 
cient to indicate that several valuable and interesting 
oral composition lessons might be based on the story, 
including one on ballad-making. This series of lessons 
could be followed by each child writing one paper, 
choosing his subject from those discussed in class or 
from a still different point of view. 
Compare the two methods of procedure, I and II. 
Which one demands genuine composing? Reproduc-

  174 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
tion? Constructive ideas? Mere memory? Which is 
more interesting? More stimulating? Which set of 
papers would be more interesting reading for the 
pupils? For the teacher? 
Show how the method suggested in II would pro- 
mote growth in composing through growth of vocab- 
ulary; selection of ideas’ for a definite purpose; ideas 
of suitability in speech and writing; ideas of making 
speech and writing effective. To what extent are these 
ideas, — choice of words, selection of ideas, suita- 
bility, and effectiveness, — the important ones in all 
composing? What would be the teacher’s aim in plan 
I? What idea of composing was back of it? 
In what sense was there genuine teaching of com- 
position in II? To what extent was there any teach- 
ing of composition in I? 
MANUAL TRAINING 
(Grade VI) 
The following is the report of the better of two les- 
sons planned and taught for inspection by graduates 
of the teachers’ course in a well-known polytechnic 
school: — 
“We are going to make a post-card rack to-day, similar to ~ 
this model, which I have made,” the teacher said, holding 
the model up to view. “‘ These are the pieces or parts of which 
it is composed,” taking it apart, “and you can see by this 
how it is put together.” The parts were re-assembled and 
the model set out in view of the class. 
“T will make one for you and let you see how every part

THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 175 
is made so that there will be no difficulty. The drawings 
Ihave placed on the blackboard, giving the dimensions, 
You see there are four pieces, — two uprights, front and 
back, and two bases. The front upright is 3” x 5”, the 
back is 33” x 6” and the bases are each 14” X 6” with 2?” 
notches, $’” deep, 1’ from each end. The upper corners are 
all rounded,” and so on to the end, pointing to the working 
drawings on the blackboard, as he explained. 
“This smaller piece is for the front. I place a dot in the 
middle of the top, so, 23”’ from each side; likewise a dot on 
each side 2” from the bottom. These dots on the side I care- 
fully connect with the dot at the top with a light line, so. 
Then I place the piece in the vise, so, and plane off the cor- 
ners down to the line, with this plane,” holding up the plane. 
“Be careful to drive the plane with the grain so as to make 
asmooth edge. It is necessary, therefore, to turn the piece in 
the vise before planing the other corners.” The back and the 
two bases were made in a similar way with running com- 
ments as above. 
“Now in order to make the rack prettier I will round off 
the upper corners. To get a good curve I will place this 
penny, so, and trace the curve. I use the plane as before to 
plane off the corners.” The teacher then marked the ten 
upper corners and planed them all off. The model was then 
put together and held up to view. “Do you understand? 
Are there any questions now before you go to work?” Boy. 
“What is it to be used for?” Teacher. “To hold post cards. 
You will find the materials on your benches. You may go to 
work.” 
The above consumed about forty-five minutes. In 
the remaining forty-five minutes each boy made a 
fairly good rack. The teacher moved about and gave 
individual help. 
It would be profitable at this point for the reader 
to make a note of what he considers the strong and
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
weak points in this lesson and, if he sees any faults, 
to reconstruct the lesson so as to make it more effec- 
tive. 
What mental activity would be stimulated by such 
a question as, — What can we make that would con- 
veniently hold a collection of picture post cards? What 
would the boys suggest? It might be a sort of wall- 
pocket, the boy illustrating with his hands, with pieces 
of wood, or a rough sketch; it might be a box of the 
cigar-box type; it might be a box of the card catalogue 
type; it might be after the style of a desk book-rack, 
only smaller. These suggestions would probably pro- 
voke some intelligent discussion among the boys as to 
their relative appropriateness, attractiveness and dif- 
ficulty in construction. 
Since the last suggestion was the one actually used, 
let it be supposed to be arbitrarily or otherwise 
selected. What problem would follow? Shall it be 
made of a single base board with the uprights set in 
near the ends; with the uprights fastened to the base 
by glue, by hinges, or arranged to slide back and forth 
according to the number of cards; or shall it be with 
two small base pieces with uprights set in-in this or 
that more or less simple way? Other and possibly 
better suggestions might well be expected from the 
boys. 
Let it be supposed that, after discussion, the last 
suggestion has been chosen and the teacher has shown

lem? How long should the bases be? How far apart 
the notches for the uprights? What should be the re- 
lative size of the uprights? How may they be made 
attractive? 
The foregoing are a few of the problems involved in 
the project. How would the use of such questions have 
affected the lesson? What changes in mental attitude 
would they have necessitated? How would the num- 
ber and variety of mental images of card-racks enter- 
tained by the boys in the two lessons differ? What 
would they be doing with the images in the two cases? 
How would the two lessons differ in their effect on 
future taste? On initiative? On resourcefulness? On 
power of independent attack? On actual growth in 
skill in workmanship? . 
What connection can be traced between the type 
of teaching in the lesson reported and the fact that such 
a large proportion of workmen are more lacking in 
judgment than in skill? Which would be the greater 
handicap, lack of judgment or lack of skill? Which one 
is the more often neglected in teaching? How can you 
secure its development without the large use of thought 
questions? In the two methods of treatment here dis-

READING 
(Grade VIII) 
The following is the first part of a plan for teaching 
Julius Cesar, quoted from Parker’s Methods of Teach- 
ing in High Schools, by permission of Ginn & Company, 
publishers. Its purpose is to state, (A) all the impor- 
tant facts of the lesson; and (B) the procedure, giving 
the main questions to be asked: — 
A. I. Time and historical setting. 
1. 44 B.c. Based with remarkable faithfulness 
on Plutarch’s narrative. 
2. The old Roman democracy was hopelessly 
broken down. : 
8. Cesar, the man of the hour, made himself 
master of the army and defeated his great ri- 
val, Pompey, in battle. 
4. Created dictator for life. 
5. Observed lenient policy toward enemies but 
many not grateful. 
B. I. Time and historical setting. 
1. Give the date of the action of the drama. 
2. Describe the political situation at Rome. 
8. In the battle from which Cesar had just re- 
turned, who were the contestants and what 
were the results? 
4, What was Cesar’s position in the states? 
5. What faction was forming against Cesar? 
What kind of questions are asked under B? What 
evidently has been required of the pupils before begin-

ning the reading of the play? What proportion of 
people generally precede the reading of one of Shake- 
speare’s historical plays by reading from Plutarch? 
What proportion of high-school or eighth-grade 
teachers would do that if they were reading for pleas- 
ure rather than for school work? What is the ethical 
effect of telling children they should do what the 
teacher knows not one in twenty does or will do in 
actual life, and what she herself in all probability does 
not do except in preparation for teaching? 
What probably was Shakespeare’s main purpose in 
writing Julius Cesar? Why did he use historical sub- 
jects for some of his plays? Why did he alter historical 
facts and modify old tales? Plays usually give the 
observer or reader a more or less complete story or 
episode. If the understanding of the story depends 
upon an historical setting, it is obvious that these facts 
of setting must be in the play. Does Shakespeare’s 
‘Julius Cesar contain all the historical setting neces- 
sary to an appreciation of the story and an understand- 
ing of the play? Why would it be much better train- 
ing for students to find this setting in the play than to 
read about it or be told it beforehand and recite it from 
memory? Which way would have the better chance of 
being effective in later reading? When might one ex- 
pect a pupil on his own initiative to read Plutarch’s 
Julius Cesar? Why not expect it of a whole class? 
Why not require it? 
Then the teacher’s problem for this part of the work
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
is: Can I direct the pupils’ silent reading of the play 
by thought questions so that they will get the histori- 
cal setting? So that they will feel the need of this as 
a part of the story? Criticize the following plan and 
compare it with the one quoted above, keeping these 
points in mind: — 
A. I. Historical setting, from the first act. 
1. Cesar has succeeded the defeated Pompey as 
hero of the whole populace. 
a. Scene 1. 2nd Citizen. Indeed, sir, we 
make holiday, to see Cesar, and to re- 
joice in his triumph.” 
b. Marullus’s whole speech following, in- 
cluding 
“Knew you not Pompey?” and 
“And do you now cull out a holiday? 
And do you now strew flowers in his way, 
That comes in triumph over Pompey’s 
blood?” 
2. Cesar has become more personally powerful 
than is consistent with old Roman ideals of 
freedom. He looks toward a kingship. 
a. Scene 1. “Flavius. Who else would soar 
above the view of men, 
And keep us all in servile 
fearfulness.” 
b. Scene 2. Manner of addressing Cesar. 
“Here, my lord.” ‘Peace, ho! Caesar 
speaks.”’ “Czesar, my lord.” 
c. The two long speeches of Cassius to 
Brutus including, “I was born free as 
Cesar; so were you”; and the tales of 
companionship. Also— 
“What should be in that Caesar? 
Why should that name be sounded more 
than yours?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 181 
“When could they say, till now, that 
talked of Rome, 
That her wide walks encompassed but 
one man?” 
d. Casca’s tale about the offering of the 
crown. ® 
3. A faction of Ceesar’s former friends did not ap- 
prove and were forming against him. 
a. See Cassius’ speeches above. Also from 
Scene 3. : 
6. “Casca. And I will set this foot of mine 
as far 
As who goes farthest.” 
c. “Cassius. There’s a bargain made. 
Now know you, Casca, I have, moved 
already 
Some certain of the noblest minded 
Romans, 
To undergo with me, an enterprise,” etc. 
B. Questions to get historical setting. 
What reasons have you for thinking that this is an 
historical play from the title? From the list of char- 
acters? What reasons might there be for a conspiracy 
against Ceesar? 
What historical facts are given in the first act? Why 
are the people having holiday? What reason does 
Marullus urge against this? Which stirs your sym- 
pathy, Marullus or the citizens? In what manner in 
scene two do the attendants address Ceesar? What does 
that indicate? Why should Brutus “fear the people 
choose Cesar for their king”? How does the matter 
look to Flavius? What had been the relations between 
Cassius and Czsar? How does Cassius compare 
Cesar with Brutus? Why? Why does Cassius object 
to Cesar being made king? How does Casca’s tale 
about the crown affect the matter? What evidently 
has been the Roman ideal? What do you think Cesar’s 
former friends and companions propose to do about it? 
With what reason?

  182 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
ARITHMETIC 
(Grades VII or VIII) 
An auto-truck factory wished to equip its salesmen 
with arguments that would increase the sales. How 
could a salesman induce merchants to change from 
wagons to auto-trucks? What would he have to know 
about each? Use blackboard and write as given by 
children. 
. The original cost of each. 
The capacity of each. 
Daily mileage. 
Daily mileage loaded. 
Number of ton-miles of work daily. 
Cost of maintenance per day. 
. Cost of carrying one ton one mile. 
The children may not give all of these at first; the others 
may be put on the blackboard as the idea is developed. 
How can approximately reliable information be had 
on the above points, for example, mileage? How many 
days would you need to keep a record of distance 
traveled? How would you use these records to get a 
reliable daily mileage? What would you estimate it to 
be for one of your grocer’s wagons? The following is a 
record of a one-horse wagon for eight days selected at 
random: 18, 24, 24, 26, 20, 23, 23, and 22 miles. 
How would you expect a two-horse wagon to differ 
from that? A three-horse truck? Here are the records 
for a two-horse and a three-horse wagon for the same 
days. Why is it better to select the records at random?

Two-horse wagon: 24, 18, 18, 18, 20, 19, 20, and 23 miles. 
Three-horse wagon: 20, 18, 16, 17, 19, 18, 16, and 20 miles. 
Find the average daily mileage for each. How do you 
account for the difference? How do you think the 
average daily mileage of 1, 3, 5, and 10 ton auto- 
trucks would differ? Let us put them at 80, 60, 50, and 
88 miles respectively. Encourage the children to look 
up the matter of accuracy in each case as a large part 
of our daily thinking is of this approximating type. 
Let us place the capacities of all these different 
vehicles as follows: — 
1 horse wagon, 1 ton. 
2 horse wagon, 3 tons. 
3 horse wagon, 5 tons. 
1 ton truck. 
8 ton truck. 
6 ton truck. 
10 ton truck. 
Let some child look up the accuracy. How would the 
amount hauled vary in different parts of a city? In 
the soft roads of a village? What should we under- 
stand by capacity? Why is it difficult in most of such 
cases as the above to get any but approximate averages? 
How can we get sufficiently reliable data under 
No. 4, the number of daily miles loaded? 
Let us take the following figures: —

Seventh- and eighth-grade pupils may be able to 
attack this problem without the assistance of the ques- 
tions that follow. How much was the load from A to 
B? From B to C? ete. What is the next problem? A 
ton-mile is the amount of work done in carrying one 
ton one mile. How many ton-miles of work was done 
from A to B? From B to C? etc. What was the total 
number of ton-miles done? Keep the answer. How 
could the trip have been planned to require less work? 
Considering its maximum daily capacity at 190 ton- 
miles (verify this estimate later) what per cent of a 
full day’s work was done? What was the cost per ton- 
mile that day? What business would be able to make 
a ton-mileage greater than 50 per cent of the actual 
mileage? For example, would it be above or below 50 
per cent in each of the following cases: U.S. mail 
wagons in collecting mail, in transporting it between . 
central post-office and railroad stations; baggage trans- 
fer wagons? What do you think of taking 50 per cent 
as the percentage to be expected as a rule? 
How does the number of ton-miles compare with the
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE QUESTION IN OTHER SUBJECTS 185 
number of miles actually traveled? Find the percent- 
age. How should this compare with the percentage 
found above? 
Find the number of ton-miles of work a one-horse 
wagon will do a day according to our figures. A two- 
horse wagon. A three-horse wagon. 
Let us make a form for tabulating the facts we are 
getting so as to make them easy to use: — 
  What columns do we need? Make six: 1. cost per 
day; 2. capacity; 3. daily mileage; 4. daily mileage 
loaded; 5. ton-mile; 6. cost per ton per mile. Fill out the 
table as far as we have the figures. (Columns 2, 3, 4, 
and 5 may be filled at once.) What ones remain? 
Which must be filled next? 
What items go to make up the cost per day for 
horse-drawn vehicles? 
First cost of horse. 
First cost of wagon. 
Housing. 
Feed. 
Driver. 
Smithing. 
Repairs. 
Incidentals. 
Depreciation (?).

  186 THE QUESTION AS A FACTOR IN TEACHING 
Interest (?). 
Tax (?). 
Insurance (?). 
Arrange these in the order of their probable amounts 
and for one-, two-, and three-horse wagons. Let the 
children determine the best form of tabulation. 
Take these figures as a record for the month of 
August: —

Have pupils get estimates on these items from five 
or six men who ought to know. How should these 
varying estimates be used to get reliable figures? How 
do they compare with the above? Are the figures here 
given probably genuine? Why is the cost for two horses 
and three horses not twice and three times the cost for 
one? What is the daily cost for each of these wagons? 
Should one consider only the working days of the 
month? What days would the auto-maker consider? 
What difference would it make? How much would 
you add for the fact that the horses originally cost 
$200 each? 
The following questions in this paragraph may be

too difficult for eighth-grade pupils. How would you 
use the fact that the horses were bought when five 
years old and sold for $100 each when fifteen years old? 
How would you find out the chance that one or more of 
them would die in that time? How use this probabil- 
ity? What would the tax and insurance amount to? 
Would you use insurance and probability of sickness 
and death as a part of the daily cost? Find deprecia- 
tion and interest for a month and use it in the above list. 
Using the items so far determined, find the daily cost 
for a one-, two-, and three-horse wagon. How can one 
tell when he has the correct answer? 
Now how can you find the cost of carrying one ton 
one mile, a ton-mile, by each wagon? Why might it be 
necessary for a grocer to have three one-horse wagons 
instead of one three-horse truck? ‘

Let children have these figures checked up by practical 
auto-owners and use them as in the case of wagons. 
From an auto-truck catalogue decide upon the initial 
cost of the above trucks. How much would that add to 
each of the above columns of estimates? It is obvious 
that the capital invested in the trucks ($1000, $2000, 
or $3500) is costing the owners interest at the rate of 
probably six per cent or more. How much would that 
be per month for each of the trucks? What insurance 
would be desirable? How much would the insurance 
amount to per month? How much would the monthly 
depreciation be? How would you find the deprecia- 
tion? There may be other expenses necessary to con- 
sider. When the list is complete finish the table by 
finding the daily cost of each type of truck and the 
cost of carrying one ton one mile in each. 
List the points or arguments that an auto-truck 
salesman could make toward inducing your grocer to 
invest in one or more automobiles of appropriate type.

textbooks? How do these facts affect the value of such 
work as this? What objections would you urge against

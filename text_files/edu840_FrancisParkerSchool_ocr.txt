PREFACE me 
  Some years ago two educated, critical young women visited ae 
our school, They had read our Studies in Education. They... 
went away, they say, thinking that here was the educational L 
heaven—the children keen, alert, happy, friendly, lovable; the .» 
teachers—well, they thought highly of the teachers, too. They -» 
seem to have come on a very auspicious day. However, two or.’* 
three years later these same young women were invited to teach. 
in this school. They say they were disillusioned.- They found: 
that the teachers were interested, doubtless, in their work, and: : 
reasonably intelligent, but certainly not geniuses. “The way “s 
to become a better teacher,” they were told when they were dis-. : 
couraged, “is to teach another year.” These young women -~ 
insist that the Studies in Education are misleading. Reading 
them, one would think that no mistakes were ever made in our 
school; that every pupil is at his best at every moment; that 
the maximum of training of information is attained with every” 
pupil; and that every teacher is always completely prepared 
and in every respect equal to every situation. Teachers of more 
experience know, of course, that there are always difficulties and 
discouragements: That is the reason why thinking people are_ 
constantly making experiments in educational methods and in 
subject-matter; that is the reason for Studies in Education: they 
are not records of perfection attained; they are accounts -of 
attempts to improve on dur own methods and to avoid some of 
our past failures and errors.

INTRODUCTION 
’ History in modern, education is being classified more and 
more as a social science, and since, in our school, history has 
always been essentially a social study, we are publishing our” 
history course at this time for whatever it may contribute to 
the current country-wide movement for a more immediately 
useful and dynamic curriculum. ° 
The ruling idea in the entire course is that of development— 
the idea of the development of mankind upon the earth as a. 
continuous process. We would have the children realize that 
there are in life certain controlling forces, habits, and ideas. 
which throughout the ages have moved civilization forward to 
noble achievement ; and that there are other forces, purposes and 
types of action, which have held it back and led inevitably. to 
its downfall and destruction. 
The basis for the selection of subject-matter for our course 
is found in the varying characteristics, abilities, and stages of 
development of the children. Under this guiding principle, some 
vital period or chapter. in the story of human progress, some 
typical race experience, illuminated with lasting achievement 
and characterized by high heroic action, is chosen for intensive 
study in each grade. The problems in each intensive experi- 
ence demand initiative, invention, creative imagination, and 
contact with beauty in many forms, and give daily opportunity 
for varied and satisfying achievement and self-expression. 
‘Thus the knowledge content of the course performs two 
functions: on the one hand it furnishes an appropriate back- 
ground for the children’s own experiences and activities; on the 
other, it never fails to spur them to further questioning and to 
equip them with stimulating information with which to face new 
obstacles and new difficulties. . : : 
The children acquire this knowledge, the historical data | 
necessary to their purposes, from books and pictures, from 
excursions to museums and libraries, and from the various 
forms of presentation which the teachers use. But the deter- 
mining factor as to the exact knowledge which they shall acquire. 
: 5
-P-A-G-E-6

and the direction which the detailed work shall follow in the 
selected field, centers in the ‘children’s own interests, in their 
questions, in their problems, or in their individual projects which 
are related to the group project. 
' The course provides for each child in the school a limited, 
yet intensive and oft-repeated experience in his early years in 
those elemental occupations through which mankind has sup- 
plied his fundamental needs in whatever environment he has 
lived,—not only his needs for food, shelter, and clothing, but 
those more subtle yet not less necessary ones for self-realization, 
for satisfying his intellectual curiosity, his aesthetic and spiritual 
hungers and-aspirations. The method of study used in this course 
, is that of a social or natural science. It is a method of question- 
ing, of experiment with actual materials, of trial and error, of 
crude classification and simple generalization. 
In experimenting to solve their problems the children are 
led naturally to trace the development of many phases of human 
activity, from more primitive forms to the complex mechanism 
existing today, and they are bound to discover for themselves 
that for those who have the desire and the ability there still 
exists a wide field for experiment, that there are alluring oppor- 
tunities to add some new fragment to the sum of human know!l- 
edge, or some bit of creative imagery in music, art, or literature 
to the enduring beauty of the world. 
The course which our teachers present in detail in this 
pamphlet has been given for many years with few radical 
changes either in principle or in method—-although its content has 
been constantly modified and vivified by individual teachers— 
and it has become, we believe; better and better adapted through 
the years to the growing abilities of the children using it. Twice, 
in past, years, the entire faculty has worked intensively for 
several weeks upon the course, analyzing and criticizing it both 
for the purpose of improving it from the standpoint of its 
response to the needs of children in each’ school year, and to test 
its continuity and progression in knowledge and’experience from 
year to year. Such critical consideration’ has certainly modified 
the original structure of the course as it was used in the Chicago 
_ Normal School, where it originated, but it has not changed it 
fundamentally 3 and this stability implies, we believe, that Emily”

J. Rice and her co-workers in the Normal School, under the 
direction of Colonel Parker, possessed the modern dynamic atti- 
tude toward the study of history, and that they knew children 
and the history of civilization and the objectives of such a course 
so well that they were able to select a permanently valuable plan 
of study and activity to help them in training their children for 
citizenship—for “social service of an effective, self-organizing 
voluntary character, for joyous participation in useful and wholesome 
work and play. , 
Introductory words would not do justice to the work of 
this course if they did not speak of the spontaneity and joy with 
which the children respond to it in all the grades. Indeed, its 
best endorsement lies in the fact that this work seems important 
to the children themselves. We believe that it must be in 
precisely such response and activity as this course arouses in | 
children—in such ‘experience in giving and taking, in appreciat- 
ing and inspiring each other, in learning to lead and to follow, 
in recognizing the rights of others while receiving full justice for 
one’s own endeavor, in respect for each other’s abilities and 
gifts—that we may hope to find the basis for the righteous 
living of the future, may hope that a habit of codperation may : 
be formed which will provide the experience necessary to help 
humanity to live and work together for the benefit of all. It 
must be a slow process, for all forms of evolution are slow, and 
perhaps the child himself may learn patience as he studies the 
steps in the slow development of humanity through:.the ages 
from the savage to the Christ. 
There are indications that people in many nations are dis- 
satisfied with the ideals and methods of traditional education. 
New leaders, men of vision, may arise and vast changes may 
result. A case in point is the great educational conference held 
in July in San Francisco at which the representatives of fifty 
nations met and demanded that the world find a better way than 
war to settle disputes. A Committee was appointed from that 
conference to report in 1925. The task of this committee is to 
present a plan so to change textbooks that war shall not be 
glorified, that youth shall not be inspired and taught to believe 
that a soldier’s bravery ‘is the only high form of heroism, the 
most exalted way-to express supreme love of country. The sense

was that children throughout the worl

We cannot avoid the evidence,—the danger signals are too 
pronounced—that we are living in a period of supreme world 
crisis. We teachers, more than others, have reason to share in 
-the belief that the hope of the future rests in education. But 
it must be a different type of education from: that prevailing in 
the past or actuating the present, different from the traditional | 
education which has been divorced from life-and which has 
recognized as its chief incentives extraneous rewards, prizes, 
and other forms of selfish ambition. Surely any education which 
justifies hope for the future must have for its keynote the principle 
of cooperation. : 
Certain distinguished scientists, with Prince Kropotkin as 
‘the outstanding leader, claim that mutual aid is of even greater 
importance than individual struggle as a factor in the evolution 
of all life, reaching from the lower forms of animals to mankind 
in the twentieth century. And he sees in the wide application — 
of this principle, even at the present time, the best guaranty of 
a still loftier evolution of our race.* 
It is a far cry from the present attitude in the world to the 
.acceptance of the mutual aid idea or of the system of education 
which would teach children from birth, not passively nor 
theoretically, nor on Sundays only, but actively day by day, by 
precept and example, that fear and hate, greed and revenge are — 
not only wrong in principle, but must ever be deemed stupid 
because of the futility of their results. Such a system of educa- 
tion must bring its pupils constantly into contact with existing 
social phenomena wherever there are important happenings, 
whether in our own or other lands, and it must teach them to 
observe fearlessly; to form judgments very slowly and upon 
much data and without undue pressure or influence from their 
schools or homes or national government. The accepted system 
should teach boys and girls that to judge sanely upon any im- 
portant issue demands a body of exact knowledge, and therefore, 
since it is usually difficult, if not impossible, for a young person 
to gather the essential knowledge, an eager, open mind is youth’s 
best tool. They should learn that data should neither be accepted 
nor rejected impulsively, that they owe a debt to the past and a 
duty to the future which should make them appreciate the vast

-P-A-G-E-10
“10 Soctak SCIENCE SERIES 
stores of accumulated wisdom and truth which history and 
science provide. Thus to stimulate in youth a desire for a body 
of thorough knowledge is the duty and privilege of every school 
—to train students’ on the one hand to observe and think inde- 
pendently, to judge and act for themselves; and on the other 
hand to realize that individual judgment should be very humble 
until weighed and tested in the light of accumulated human 
experience. 
History, illuminated with stirring adventure and with 
world-shaping altruistic deeds of great men of all times, is 
better fitted than any other subject in the curriculum to awaken 
in boys and girls a real sense of their responsibility to society. 
Yet the study of history today seemingly leaves American boys 
‘and girls indifferent to the forces and events which are rapidly 
destroying the good will and fellowship of the world. In the 
case of our own school, we believe the fault lies not in any 
inherent weakness in the content of our history course, nor in 
the method used in work, nor in the characteristics and possi- 
bilities of the children themselves. It is, we believe, due to the 
fact that both in the home and in the school we have failed to 
give the children early in their lives sufficient individual and 
community responsibilities, have failed to make these responsi- 
bilities increase naturally with the children’s growth, have failed 
to keep them in constant touch with the most important world 
tendencies and problems; as a result our carefully shielded chil- 
dren have not a conscious realization of their relationship to 
the present world upheaval. We believe it is the duty of schools 
to emphasize, more than ever before, the preparation of youth 
for those demands which our country must soon make upon 
this generation, for definite knowledge of world affairs, and for 
that enlightened leadership, upon which the fate of civilization 
depends. We believe that in the past we have been content to 
have the children busy and happy in an isolated and protected 
area detached from the larger area—the world. / ' 
Yet American children’ given opportunity will prove as 
capable of altruistic acts.as children of other lands. We note 
with deep interest “The Young People’s Movement” in Central 
Europe. This mavement was self-initiated and is self-directed. 
It is an earnest quest of young students for a concrete goal .
-P-A-G-E-11
Tue Course in History il 
which will benefit all. Young as they are, for many of these 
students are not yet eighteen years old, they have the courage 
to suffer and sacrifice physical comforts for an ideal. The 
movement has representatives in ever-increasing numbers from 
at least six of the war stricken countries of Europe. While it 
has a religious and ethical basis, while it is aimed against the 
gross materialism of the age, while it has the earmarks of youth 
with all its egotism, self-righteousness, and intolerance, yet it 
is not fanatical. Those of its members who are not students are 
all doing practical work in some profession, industry, or field 
of art. They are filled with youth’s buoyant hope, faith, and 
courage, and all their keen emotions are directed and controlled 
by a great, inspiring purpose. Adolescent America might well 
be brought into contact with such soul-awakening social action, 
might well be given a chance to ally itself, with some great 
cause, instead of being allowed to drift helplessly in a life which 
smothers social conscience, which fills youth’s leisure with many 
forms of selfish, frivolous amusement, and which drugs the 
senses and dulls intelligence with jazz music and over-stimulat- 
ing cinemas. : 
We look upon our well-nourished, happy children and find 
no cause for discouragement, but we do find grave danger for 
future citizenship in the present formal system of education. 
Our own school, with many others scattered over the country, 
can claim with some degree of fairness that the principle of 
coéperation, rather than that of selfish competition, has been 
stressed for many years, not only in this history course but in 
all study and forms of daily living, and the results have been 
encouraging. . 
The Social Group Project has been the accepted form of 
organization for study in carrying out this principle of codpera- 
tion throughout the grades, and it has proved to be particularly 
well adapted for the work outlined in this history course. | It 
ingrains deep in the child’s experience those habits of thought 
and action, those satisfactions and joys which come naturally 
from working intelligently with one’s fellows to accomplish a 
purpose which seems important to all the workers. Within the 
scope of the social group project there is abundant opportunity 
for original investigation—for individual or small group enter-
-P-A-G-E-12
12 Socrat ScrmNcE SERIES 
  prises. The pupils often elect to work alone or with two or 
three others upon some problem related to the whole. As one 
of our teachers has said, “There are by-paths of delight leading in 
all directions from the main road, which the class is following,” 
and often these individual investigations'develop new interests 
and lead to goals far removed from the original situation _ or 
- question. 
We believe that self-actuated work causes the greatest intel- 
lectual gain to children, and therefore we seek to encourage 
individual projects, to foster special interests, and to allow time 
for such activity on the regular school program; yet it seems to 
many of us a dangerous, even anti-social practice, to use individ- 
ual work exclusively instead of planning for a large measure of 
coéperative work. As was said before, we believe that the 
teacher should select the subject matter of the history course 
and that the children should be educated to hold fast to certain 
traceable threads which run through the entire fabric of the 
development of humanity, especially to those which have ad- ~ 
vanced civilization in many eras under many varying conditions 
and recurring human phenomena. 
We believe sincerely that for purposes of development 
children must be treated as individuals and not as a group, and 
that, in matters requiring formal drill, individual instruction and 
study are more effective and more economical than group in- 
struction and drill, But we contend that if the special function 
of a course in history is to teach children to live and.codperate 
‘successfully with their fellows, the school must be organized to 
establish in them those codperative habits which produce people 
of social conscience and social power. 
Because many schools now are stressing individual work 
in all forms of school activity, history included, we thus outline 
.in some detail our reasons for emphasizing the social group 
project. We would not make the child responsible for the 
‘selection of subject matter nor allow him free choice of activity - 
all day long, because we believe he is not fitted either in experi- 
ence or in knowledge for the task, and because we think his 
intellectual hunger, like his physical appetite, is unsafe as the 
exclusive guide for his daily nourishment and for a balanced 
ration; however, we would give him much freedom and oppor-
-P-A-G-E-13
Tue Course 1n History 13 
tunity for choice and assimilation within the scope of the care- 
fully selected materials which the teacher spreads before him 
and which should contain the various elements necéssary for his 
best development. 
The school is utilizing the results of the scientific testings 
of intelligence and many standard tests for the measurement of 
subject matter skills. It would like to participate in the gaining 
and using of such knowledge for whatever light it may throw 
in any direction; but our teachers will be slow to grant that 
children should be judged and classified as “superior” or “in- 
ferior” upon the basis of any mechanical measurement which 
can be devised, which leaves untouched and uninspired the emo- 
tional and spiritual springs of child nature and unrecognized 
those special gifts which so often offset or compensate for 
apparent defects or deficiencies in children. We welcome 
measurements and scientific data, but we doubt that mankind 
can successfully or rightfully be classified on the. basis of 
intelligence alone, because the nascent possibilities of human 
beings may become suddenly active under the stimulus of an 
inspiring motive, and we all know the influence of improved 
health conditions upon intellectual activity. 
However, we are not contending that we have an ideal 
course of study or that we are necessarily right in our. belief 
that the social group project trains. children directly for good 
citizenship; but only that we have sound reasons-for our -faith 
in the response which our children have given throughout the 
years to this principle of cooperation. 
We realize that as yet we have only glimpsed the possi- - 
bilities of children set free to act under the urge of their own 
» interests, and we have not even.yet grasped fully the idea that 
the teacher’s function is to create a rich environment, suitably 
equipped for the children’s work and play and stimulating to 
their interests. This atmosphere must of course be permeated 
with the influence of real men and women who consider it a 
privilege to work with and for children,—strong, personalities, © 
artigts, lovers of beauty and life, experts in some field of human 
“endeavor. Such leaders educate and train in the true meaning 
of the word; they judge work according to its power to awaken 
real and abiding interests, to spur children to earnest effort, to
-P-A-G-E-14
14 Socrat ScreENcE SERIES 
equip them with habits of industry, to implant in them love-of 
-good workmanship, and above all to cultivate in them a tolerant, 
open-minded love of truth. : 
Such a teacher was Jennie Hall, who so greatly enriched 
this history course, as she did everything which her rare peda- 
gogic vision penetrated. Fortunately, we have in permanent 
form the published contribution of her fine historic sense and 
wide knowledge, crystallized in simple picturesque form in her 
hooks: Weavers. and Other Workers, which our school uses 
in the second grade; The Story of Chicago and Viking Tales, in 
the third: Men of Old Greece, Four Old Greeks, and Buried 
Cities, in the fourth; and Our Ancestors in Europe, in the 
grammar grades, especially in the fifth and seventh. The school 
owes her much, and we would have, if we could, as the out- 
standing intellectual practice of the school, her spirit of courage- 
ous doubt, her sharp questioning habit, her tireless, joyful 
searching for the best conditions for child education. 
We believe that the articles of the teachers make clear this 
sincere belief of the school that not only must the children 
have conditions for free and spontaneous, all-round growth, but 
that the teachers, too, must have the same kind of freedom for 
creative codperation and the same responsibility for good results. 
It is, of course, necessary that the faculty agree upon certain 
fundamental principles, policies, and ideals in order that the 
school as a community may move steadily toward its accepted 
’ goal, which we sum up in the words “ideal citizenship.” To | 
accomplish this end, the teachers must be free to judge and 
choose the means to their ends, subject only to the discriminat- 
ing criticism and judgment of a democratically organized faculty. _ 
As yet, the work in the elementary grades is more charac- 
terized than that in the high school grades by such freedom of. 
choice, by natural incentives to work and freedom, and therefore — 
_is more alive and growing. This is not because of internal 
pressure, but because the overwhelming proportion of children 
in this particular school go to college, and the high school course 
of study therefore has been quite markedly modified by college 
entrance requirements, so that the subject matter of our high 
school course in history conforms very closely to current practice 
in other college preparatory high schools. However, aside from.
-P-A-G-E-15
Tue Course in History * 15 
the college requirements, since the pupils doubtless have a 
background of experience and are‘ready to appreciate a 
chronologically arranged unit of history study, our high school 
history course, though not unusual, seems worthy of taking its 
place in this book. The value of the work which the children 
do in history has been again and again demonstrated in the keen 
interest and questioning attitude of the pupils and the thorough 
mastery of the work presented. Still we hope that in the near 
future the high school teachers may take their place in the 
experimental field and make a contribution to education in the 
secondary school by creating a history course as closely in 
keeping with the avowed purpose of the school as is that of the 
elementary school. : 
Finally, we would have all the work and every method of 
the school-thoroughly tested by the degree in which it enables 
every child daily to take from life his fullest measure of useful 
happy experience, and fo give to life fearlessly and unselfishly his 
fullest measure of effective, soul-satisfying service. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
FIRST GRADE. 
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES 
- The work of this grade is based upon the child’s interests . 
and experiences in his home and his environment. His food, - 
-his clothing, his house are the unquestioned elements of his 
environment.: By reproducing these human essentials in his play 
and school activities he becomes conscious of them, yet they 
are so complex that he cannot realize them in their relations or 
processes. : / . 
As the great source of food supply the farm presents the 
simplest form of present day life. But here too modern methods’ 
have so modified farm labor that the steps of production are dif- 
ficult for a child to follow, even though carried on in a small 
social unit. On the farm the child sees the labor of man replaced 
‘by machinery run by steam or electric power. In his home he 
sees only the results of industry, not its beginnings and proc- 
esses. On the other hand, the simple life of primitive people 
can be readily understood by little children; they can see the 
entire family sharing the work of supplying its needs; they can~ 
see the whole process of production from the gathering of mate- 
rials to the use of the finished product. Therefore, the study 
of certain types of primitive people gives background and unity 
to their own varied experiences, activities and forms of expres- 
sion. The Tree-man, the Cave-man, the Eskimo and the Indian 
are used to throw into conscious contrast and more vivid realiza~ 
tion present day conditions. 
Each year, for instance, the children gather and husk the 
corn from the school garden, and then the entire grade spends 
one day at a farm. The teacher and the farmer here direct 
observation and focus attention, so that all the children get the 
same background.

concerning their sources. The children have these questions in 
mind when they visit the farm. Here they look into the great
-P-A-G-E-18
18 SocraL Scrence SERIES 
bins of wheat, oats, and rye. They climb to the field at the topi 
of the hill, fill their arms with corn, and run down to feed the 
‘cows and the ever-hungry pigs and chickens. 
_ They are interested in the great, towerlike silos, and can’ 
hardly realize that these contain the winter food for the horses 
and cows. The farmer milks one of the cows, and the children 
have a drink of warm milk. A look into the milk house shows 
them where the milk is cooled and the bottles are cleaned. The 
suggestion is made that possibly some of this milk goes to their 
own homes. Here are the gentle sheep covered with soft wool 
that is made into clothing. The tiny calves are always ready 
to put out their moist noses and pink tongues when little hands 
are timidly outstretched to pat their heads. The great bull is 
not so cordial, and is treated with the respect due his size and 
strength. The pigs and their large families of pink-nosed and 
curly-tailed babies are the center of much admiration and 
interest. : 
Last, but not least, comes the climb to the top of the hay loft, 
and then the thrilling adventure of sliding down, down, over 
bumps of baled hay, and then on and on over crackling, slippery 
_hay to the floor. 
In the school room the day. at the farm is thought over, and 
all the most vivid experiences and observations are written on 
the blackboard. Since the children have no writing ability at 
this time of the year, the teacher records their statements. 
These are made into charts which the children read later in the 
term. They are interested in records which other first grade 
children have made after visiting the same farm, and find in- 
centive to organize their observations into similar word pictures. 
The reading is thus meaningful and gives the children great 
pleasure, for through it they are able to re-live the experiences 
of this day on the farm. But they have enough power in draw- 
ing and painting to-express themselves freely, and it is in this 
way. that they reproduce their direct impressions of the farm 
trip. They. not only draw and paint, but they attempt to make 
a scene that is more realistic by modeling in clay, on the sand 
table, animals to stock a farm yard. Finally, the material is 
organized into a morning exercise, each child telling the thing he 
most enjoyed.
-P-A-G-E-19
THE Course 1n History 19 
As an outgrowth of the visit to the farm, the children’ cook 
cereals and make cottage cheese and butter. They dry fruit 
and make jelly as their means of preparation for winter,—an 
idea that grew from the food stored for the animals in the silos, 
and from the bins of grain, the cribs of corn, and the loft full of 
hay. 7 oo 
In dramatic play they are given the Mother Goose rhymes 
of Hey Diddle Diddle, Little Boy Blue, and Tom, Tom, the 
Piper's Son; the fables of The Dog in the Manger, Lark and 
the Young Ones, The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse and 
the story of The Buckwheat, by Anderson, Christina Rossetti’s 
Swallows and her version of The Town Mouse and the Country 
Mouse are used. At Thanksgiving time they learn the following 
passage from the Psalms: 
“The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys 
also are cov ered over with corn; they shout for Joy, 
they also sing.” 
The class learns the songs of The Gentle Cow, Up-in an Apple 
Tree, The Corn Soldiers, The Harvester, The Hay Stack, and Come, 
Ye Thankful People. 
Through this poetry and music the entire experience is 
lifted to a higher plane. 
PART IL—SHELTER 7~ . 
THe TREE DWELLERS 
As the activities centered about the production and prep- 
aration of food in Part I, so the second, step of the work centers 
about the idea of shelter,—the child’s house. : 
The child already knows something of the materials and 
construction of his house for he has seen the building of city 
houses. He has watched with wonder while beams were lifted 
into place by giant cranes and fastened together with red- hot 
bolts. ° 
After finding out the different kinds of materials used in 
the construction of the children’s own homes and in homes seen 
in pictures or observed while on trips, a blackboard sketch is 
made of a tropical forest, a stream, and wild animals. 
This problem is presented: How and where would you 
make a home in this place without tools? The children usually.
-P-A-G-E-20
20 Socrat Scrénce SERIES 
suggest a tree, since the situation is rather evident. Then more 
difficult questions arise as to how the shelter may be made, and 
what materials may be used, and what and how food may be 
_obtained. . 
The problems of construction are made more realistic to 
the children by a day spent in the woods, where they make a 
playhouse of brush, twigs and vines. The children begin to 
build this house as an eagle builds her nest, by gathering sticks 
and twigs and throwing them into a pile. But they soon see 
that a better protéction can be made by weaving together small 
branches and tying them into place with stout weeds and vines. 
When the little hut is finished, they make a carpet of red and 
yellow leaves. 
Some of the children make bows and arrows of twigs and 
vines, with w hich to hunt imaginary lions and tigers; others 
bring in, as their imagination suggests, wild fruits and nuts, 
or small game, such as rabbits or squirrels, caught with their 
hands.. They search the woods to select trees with spreading 
branches, so formed that a shelter might be made among them. 
They choose one that could be quickly climbed when the dweller 
sought refuge from wild animals. : 
The vivid impression of the day in the woods and the 
emotion aroused by it excite creative imagination, and direct it 
toward further activity and learning. In order to provide a 
. house for-more permanent use, the children gather the brush 
which has been left from trimming trees in the school yard, 
and waste shrubbery from the park. Of this material they 
construct a little hut in the playground. 
Other educative experiences come in dramatic play, paint- 
ing, and modeling, each of which is part of the child’s means of 
expressing the ideas he gains as the subject develops. 
This outdoor imaginative play has created an interest in 
people who once lived in trees before men knew how to build 
houses. Stories of the Tree-dwellers are told. Sand models of 
such an environment are made. The class visit the conservatory 
in the park to see the palms and tropical trees. ‘They look at the 
long, heavy, swinging vines resembling those that helped the 
tree boy to swing from branch to branch to escape a wild boar. . 
The imagery built up through these experiences enables the

  THE BRUSH HOUSE 
children to reconstruct the lives of a people who. once had a 
similar environment. They think out how the tree-dweller 
‘ust have clothed himself and how he got his food. 
Tue Cave DwELLers 
Shelter stories of the Cave-man are told, in which life is 
shown under physical conditions different from that of the Tree- 
man. The teacher may now sketch a new énvironment—of rocks, 
caves, a stream of water, a grassy plain or swamp, a forest in 
the temperate zone. In choosing a home in such a region the 
children readily see that a cave would be not only” the easiest 
but also the safest place to live. The playground is again util- 
ized, and every child becomes a cave man, making his own cave.
-P-A-G-E-22
22 Sociat ScrENcE SERIES 
He frequently helps his neighbor, and the shelter whose con- 
struction he began as an individual project becomes a community 
activity. In imagination he sees his cave of sparkling rock. As 
he digs: with his hands, or with a stick or stone, he realizes 
what an advantage it is to have a tool. One day a boy found 
. a pick and the whole class immediately demanded his help. 
The group had quickly gone through a race experience, and 
"through it gained a slight-realization of one step in social 
progress. 
  DIGGING CAVES 
The class visit the Zoo in Lincoln Park to see those animals 
which inhabited the plains and swamps of the Cave-man, such 
as the huge elephant and the ugly hippopotamus. Under. the 
stimulus of interest gained through such avenues as excursions, 
pictures and experiments, the children paint and model different 
phases of the life of. the Cave-man and his surroundings. This 
- experience helps to clarify. and fix the imagery and to satisfy the 
child’s desire for concrete expression. The whole picture of 
the life of these people is put into. art, form with the help of the 
teacher. of eurythmics. Under her guidance the children give
-P-A-G-E-23
Tuer Course 1x History 23 
rhythmic form to some imaginative experience. They have the 
pleasure of interpreting, and at the same time-acquire the ear- 
liest form of rhythmic dance. 
From all these experiences the child gets the impression 
that at one time people lived in a manner differing greatly from 
that of the present, and in that proportion the present day be- 
comes meaningful. This work affords many opportunities for 
both group and individual activities. When the children’s in- 
terests have been broadened through pictures, excursions and 
construction, their desire for more information leads to read- 
ing. No one text book is used, but reading is largely supplied — 
hy school leaflets and supplementary books. The ideas worked 
out by the group are recorded, and these form the basis for 
word recognition and reading. At first only a word or two is 
presented, and the remainder of the thought is expressed orally. 
Later a very simple sentence is written. Questions similar to .~ 
these are asked: In order to see animals a long distance, what 
sort of eyes must a tree boy have? What kind of ears must he 
have to hear an animal coming softly through the forest? What . 
sort of legs and arms must he have to prevent an animal from 
overtaking him? A reading lesson similar to this is constructed: 
The tree boy has keen eyes. 
He has sharp ears, 
He has strong arms. 
He has strong legs. 
Then what the tree boy can do, follows: 
The tree boy can run fast. 
He can jump from rock to rock. 
He can climb quickly. 
He can swing from branch to branch. 
No animal can catch him. : 
The reading lessons are a. record of ideas and feelings ex- 
pressed by the children, or suggested by the teacher, about the 
experiences through which they have been living by means of 
dramatic play, observation, story; and picture. 
PART III—THE ESKIMO 
In Part Il the idea of shelter was thrown into high light 
by the comparison of modern homes with those of.the Tree-man
-P-A-G-E-24

and Cave-man. During the winter and spring the children study 
' the Eskimos and Indians, peoples whose lives are controlled by 
dominant geographical conditions, and the unity and inter-re- 
lations of human necessities rather than any one element is 
emphasized. The natives of Greenland are selected for this 
‘study because information concerning them is easily available. 
The same method of gaining first hand experience precedes 
the study of Eskimos and Indians. For example, children are 
taken to the playground, usually after the first heavy snow 
storm, and asked to construct ‘a house which would protect 
them. : 
The storms. of ice and sleet, the fierce cutting winds, the 
frozen pond, the blocks of ice piled high on the lake shore, the 
ice floes in the open water, all suggest the Arctic region. Mental 
imagery of the surroundings of the Eskimo is built up through 
what the children see around them that corresponds to some- 
thing similar in the Eskimo’s life. That is added to by pictures, 
stories, and lantern slides. : 
A vivid impression of the remoteness of Greenland is gained 
through taking a voyage in play across the ocean. The chil- 
dren construct a train of chairs and tables, and amid the blowing 
of whistles, the ringing of bells, the chug of the engine, and the 
calling of stations, the class arrives at New York. Here a ship 
of similar construction is procured and filled with food, and the 
long voyage begins. During the voyage a boy who has been 
across the Atlantic makes numerous tests of the temperature 
of the water to prevent collisions with unseen icebergs. As the 
boat nears land the children mention what they see in imagina- 
tion: Eskimos, polar bears, seals, walrus, and anything they 
are able to build in through knowledge gained from pictures 
and stories. 
After interest has been aroused in this way, a trip is taken 
to the Field Museum to learn more of the appearance and cus- 
toms of these people from the life-sized models exhibited there. 
The children find that Eskimos wear suits of great beauty and 
value, made of the skins of bear, reindeer, wolf, seal, and birds. 
The daily occupations of the people are learned by studying the 
various illustrative groups. A woman is dressing a skin, a man 
is boring a hole in ivory or bone, and a tiny boy is patiently
-P-A-G-E-25
. Tue Course 1n History 25 
fishing with a pole of wood, a line made of leather, and a hook 
of ivory. The class see a sledge made of small pieces of drift 
wood, and another constructed entirely of bone, and wonder at. 
the Eskimo’s skill and patience in getting what he needs. ‘They 
‘look at the dog team and driver, and imagine what fun an 
Eskimo boy must have guiding his dogs with only a whip. The 
Eskimo in his kayak looks as if he were about to throw his lorig 
harpoon at a fish, or perhaps at a whale. 
The cases of ivory spoons, bird darts, and harpoon and. 
spear heads, suggest the source of the material from which these 
implements and weapons are made. Even needles and combs 
are of ivory. The long ivory tusk of the narwhal suggests a 
visit to see the skeleton of a whale. The children find that it 
takes twenty-eight children, all standing in a row, to make a 
line the length of the whale. Some animals that resemble our 
buffalo are apparently digging moss from under the snow; these 
are musk oxen, which the Eskimo gladly hunts since he finds 
a use for every part. 
At another time we visit the Lincoln Park Zoo to see the- 
live polar bears, the wolves and Eskimo dogs. 
After taking these trips the children become interested in 
books telling of the Eskimo. They look at pictures with more 
interest. They read the school leaflets. The material of these 
leaflets adds to their knowledge of the lives and customs of. 
the Eskimos. Their reading of this material is intelligent and 
purposeful because their visual preparation for it causes their 
“imagery to be pleasing and accurate. In these leaflets much of 
the information that the children have acquired culminates ‘in 
story. An example follows: 
THE ESKIMO AND HIS KAYAK 
The Eskimo in his kayak skims over the water like'a sea bird. 
He rides over the waves. 
He dashes through them. 
He tips his kayak upside down and rides under the waves. 
He is not afraid. 
His kayak is covered with skin. . 
His suit is of skin. ~ 
No water can get in. 
He can play in the sea as easily as you play on land. 
He can throw his spear at a fish.
-P-A-G-E-26

He can throw his harpoon at 4 whale. 
Do you remember. Boas? 
He says:. ' 
“Boas has no fear, 
As he throws his spear. 
His kayak he can guide, 
No seal from him can hide. 
Over the waves he rides, - 
Under the waves he glides, 
Through the foam he splashes, 
After the seal he dashes.” 
The children make large paintings of polar bears, seals and 
Eskimo dogs, using calcimine paints. They learn the Seal 
“Lullaby, by Kipling, and sing, Jf I Were a Little Eskimo. 
  vrs SS 
THE ESKIMO IGLOO ON THE PLAYGROUND 
It is great fun for children to make a more complete and 
' better igloo in the snow after their first experimentation and 
they return to it with added zest. Some children have Eskimo 
costumes which they wear indoors and out. These are made of 
brown, gray or white canton flannel or cambric, and are trimmed 
with fur or canton flannel. . 
All experiences, information, and observations are brought 
together and shared with others in a morning exercise.

READY FOR MORNING EXERCISE ON ESKIMO LIFE 
PART IV--INDIAN 
When the warm days of spring bring a desire for more 
freedom and out-of-door life, the study of the Indian helps to 
satisfy these longings. 
Again the problem is presented of making a home that 
differs in‘type from any préviously studied, and some child al- 
ways suggests a tent. Then the question arises as to,what con- 
ditions are essential for a good camping ground. The class 
now travels, by means of stereopticon pictures, over mountains, 
valleys, plains, rivers, and lakes, in search of a country which 
supplies all the requirements for the sustenance of life. 
Through stories the children see Chicago as it once was, 
an Indian village with wigwams of skin; wild deer running 
through narrow wooded paths; hunters wandering through 
nearby forests; Indian children playing about; squaws ‘carrying 
bundles of wood; and Indians in their canoes: paddling up and 
down the lake. : : . 
Many questions arise concerning Indian life, and ‘a visit 
to the Field Museum is necessary to answer some of thein.
-P-A-G-E-28
28 : Sociat ScrENcE SERIES 
Here we find models*of Indians of the central prairies, of the 
dry lands of the Southwest, and of the wooded lands of the 
_Northwest, all showing the effect of environment upon food, 
shelter and clothing. 
The children study the groups showing home life and ac- 
tivities of the central plains, and some of the ceremonial dances 
and games. Because their attention has previously been called 
to meanings in Indian decoration, they study the designs on 
clothing and tepees, and try to interpret them. They see how 
. flint arrow heads are made. They look at the miniature homes 
of the Pueblos in the rocks and cliffs. They learn how the beau- 
tiful Pueblo rugs are woven, and are interested in the looms. 
The children try to interpret the designs taken from the great 
things in nature which most impressed these Indians, such as 
mountains, clouds, and lightning. The home of a group of cliff 
dwellers. shows women painting pottery, grinding corn, and 
baking bread. The Indians of the wooded Northwest are seen 
in a shelter constructed of bark and slabs of wood. The women 
are dressed in skirts of grass, or strips of bark, or cords of wool. 
‘Here one woman is softening bark for weaving. Another is - 
cooking soup by dropping hot stones in wooden bowls filled with 
water. By studying these various groups an impression is 
gained of the.value of the division of labor. ~ 
_. After observing patterns on baskets, pottery, clothing and 
~ the tepees of the different tribes, the children see that there is 
a desire, not only to construct a necessary article, but to beautify 
it with symbols of story or emotion, and they are led to notice 
how the dominant physical environment modifies that symbol. 
They study the animals which the Indians hunt and which ap- 
pear often in Indian stories. The children visit Lincoln Park 
to see the grizzly bear, the coyote, the deer, the buffalo, and 
other animals of North America. 
It has occasionally been possible to have Indians from the_ 
reservations come to school in native costume to sing and tell 
stories and dance. 
The children model an Indian village showing the people 
and their activities and some of the wild animals of use to the 
red man. To make Indian life more realistic a wigwam is. put 
up in the school room, and animals and trees are painted almost

life-size to make a natural setting. From a background made 
of these sensory and imaginative experiences comes the motive 
for reading. A desire to know more about Indians causes the 
child to master the printed words in the school leaflets. There | 
“are also some simple Indian legends and parts of “Hiawatha” 
that he’ enjoys reading. Other reading lessons are derived 
from blackboard records of ideas which the children gain from 
observation made during field trips and reading. 
  FIRST GRADE AT INDIAN EXHIBIT AT MARSHALL FIELD'S STORE 
They write descriptions of their drawings. Every child 
plays that he is an Indian, and assumes an Indian name. They 
sometimes enter so fully into the spirit of the work that they 
substitute these names for their own. Each child becomes an 
Indian chief and wears a gay. suit beaded and fringed. Fre- 
quently a mother adds a beaded symbol showing that her child 
has been a brave Indian. To this suit is added a head dress, 
wonderful in most primitive coloring of red and yellow feathers.

with.a pride equal to that of a real Indian. brave. 
A fitting culmination to the year’s work, and a keen stim-" _ 
ulus to the best observation and experience of children, lies in 
certain larger social demands which usually come near the end 
of the school year. For example, the physical training depart- 
ment may ask the first grade to wear their Indian costumes 
and give an Indian dance or play an Indian game on Field Day. 
The party which each lower grade gives to its big brothers and 
sisters and other members of the senior class may take the form 
of an Indian party. .Sometimés a camp fire is made around which

the children sit and tell Indian stories and sing Indian songs. 
When the work is finished, the children give a morning exer- 
cise to the other classes, telling what they know and showing 
beautiful rugs and ‘Indian curios which the parents have loaned.

such joyful and intelligent co-operation, they show so convinc- 
ingly their ability to utilize knowledge and power gained and

SECOND GRADE 
INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES—THRESHING, MILLING, 
. AND WEAVING 
In the second grade the story of man’s progress advances 
from hunter life to shepherd life and to early tillers of the’ soil. 
The work is largely a natural outcome of the children’s expe- 
riences: the school garden, which they planted as first-graders, 
must be harvested and used; the bundles of grain, lugged back 
from happy vacations in the country, must surely be threshed 
and milled, since garden crops, straw, and crushed grain are 
products vital to the success of a cherished second-grade 
activity. oe 
Besides, it is great fun to thresh grain and mill it, because 
children are such past-masters at invention. Night and day 
their heads are humming with make-shifts and methods of pro- 
cedure—and what is much to the point, the steps they take in 
these make-shifts often surprisingly resemble the steps taken 
by.the grown-ups of long ago. Therefore, in the carrying on of 
our second grade undertakings, it is easy to see that the failure 
——or, perchance, the success—of one tool or method of procedure _ 
leads onward to new and bolder inventions, until, without re- 
alizing it at all, the children are engaged in a simple study of 
early agricultural peoples. Moreover, a third vivid experience, 
the study of Indian life in the first grade, leads easily to a desire 
to weave, and this weaving experience, like threshing and mill- 
ing, also kindles interest in new types of people, new customs, 
new occupations. 
One other important activity of the grade must be men- 
tioned. It is the caring for a small flock of chickens throughout - 
the school year. This occupation appeals to children’s love of ' 
pets, and at the same time teaches the responsibility that own- 
ership entails. The school sees to the housing of the flock, but 
the children must provide proper food, and pay for it with the 
money obtained from the sale of eggs. This need for poultry 
grain furnishes a real motive for harvesting the corn and sun- 
flowers planted in the school.garden, and for threshing the 
34
-P-A-G-E-35
Tur Course 1n History >) 
bundles of grain brought back from the children’s summer 
‘vacation. 
To permit children to handle such materials as scratch 
grains and egg mash for a whole year without knowing their 
ingredients, or without understanding how they are manu- 
factured, would be a stupid procedure. After their experiences 
in threshing and milling, the children-are able not only to iden- - 
tify different grains, but to recognize such grain products as 
bran, corn meal, wheat middlings, steel-cut oats, etc., the prod- 
ucts found in most commercially- prepared poultry foods. 
The different experiences gained through these activities 
are grouped under the following heads: 
1. Garpen Work: 
Gathering and feeding of sunflower seeds; gathering corn, husking, 
shelling, measuring and storing for winter; cutting corn stalks with 
sickle, tying into bundles, and making into a corn shock; using corn 
stalks, later, to line big holes dug in the garden, where beets and cabbage 
are buried for chickens’ supply of winter green food.

The boy at the right is playing on a fiddle made out of a corn stalk. 
2. TuresHinc Wueat anv Oats: 
Since this work is done before the chickens come from the country, 
the big cement runway floor (about 12 ft. by 30) is used for an outdoor 
threshing floor. The methods tried are as follows: Threshing by rubbing 
grain between hands; by pounding with sticks and flails; by tramping 
with feet, the children pretending they are such animals as ponies, ‘oxen,

or camels; and, lastly, by dragging a heavy log over the grain, the chil- 
dren again pretending they are animals, dragging behind them man’s 
prithitive invention. 
3. Winnxowine GRAIN: . 
This is done by scooping chaff and graii onto trays, or box covers, 
lifting them high over head, and pouring the contents down on news-

primitive threshing machine as it was dragged back 
and forth over the threshing floor. 
While the children are carrying on this work, they are hav-

they are learning beautiful harvest songs and simple folk dances; 
they are painting and illustrating people at work in the harvest 
fields ; they hear stories of Ceres and Ruth; and finally they take

Weaving, our third industrial activity, is such an absorbing 
experience that children love it solely for the sake of the ac- 
tivity, but when weaving is associated with Indian baskets, 
with Navajo blankets, with bold symbolic designs—painted by 
the children in broad sweeps of colors—with such associations 
formed when first graders, weaving in second grade becomes a’ 
subject of fascinating importance. It becomes at once the center 
from which radiate many informational and creative experi- 
ences. Just how these facts and imaginative experiences develop 
in logical sequence may be gathered from the diagram of a 
weaving problem. 
  DIAGRAM OF WEAVING PROBLEM
-P-A-G-E-40
40 SocraAL ScrmNCE SERIES ‘ 
The center of the diagram represents the child's desire or 
aim, enriched by his joyous background and entered iftto with 
enthusiasm, To the right, beginning at No. 1, with mathe- 
matics, and reading downward to the presentation of the gift, 
are indicated the steps taken to acquire knowledge and skill 
preliminary to the completion of his gift. Fact and technique 
are easily mastered, becatise the need for drill originates in - 
“the aim and bears directly upon its completion. 
Though the child is satisfied, and justly so, with the realiza- 
tion of his purpose, the making and presentation of his gift, 
the teacher’s aim must include far more than this, the enrich- 
ment of the child’s imaginative nature. To this end, each 
radiating line on the left, beginning at the top, indicates a step 
toward the proper orientation of the subject-matter. These 
imaginative experiences also culminate in a big social experience, 
the event being either a party or a morning exercise given for 
the school. - 
Thus, from the original conception of the purpose to the 
final giving of a morning exercise, the children’s thoughts have 
been centered upon a succession of interests growing out of a 
simple but purposeful activity. - 
, Usually, the weaving problem is an individual one, but the 
picture shows the result of a group effort. It is a couch cover, 
four feet by six, made for Miss Cooke’s office, to take the place 
of one woven ten yéars ago, when last year’s seniors were in the 
second grade. After being in service nine years, the first rug 
was lost, and it seemed fitting to ask the aid of the seniors in 
. replacing the lost one. Because the seniors gave their aid, the 
designs. in the new rug are somewhat more pretentious than 
are ordinarily attempted by a second grade. The children tell 
the story of the rug in their letters to Miss Cooke. Wherever 
these letters refer to “a big sister or a big brother,” the refer- 
ence indicates help given by a member of the senior class. The 
letters also illustrate the accompanying diagram, since each 
one relates a step in fact, or in imaginative experience, and shows 
power in the use of tools of learning. These letters to Miss 
Cooke are as follows:

2 gallons of water. We put the dye in a big jar and let it stand over night. 
We stirred it and took off the scum. The dye was all ready.. Then we 
dipped the yarn up and down. At first it looked like it was green, but after 
a while it turned blue. .

The historic phase of this activity requires a more detailed 
explanation. The Bible stories are chosen because they give 
an ideal setting to a study of shepherd life. They are told by 
the teacher of English. The head of the grade, however, supplies 
the historic and geographic perspective, so that the children 
may more correctly picture the country, the life, the customs 
and the occupations of these early Semitic patriarchs. Further- 
more, these stories are ideal, because they describe a small 
group of people—the life of one family followed through to the 
third generation. The background is given somewhat as fol- 
lows: Abraham’s call to Canaan is the study of a nomadic 
hero seeking his fortunes in a new land. This Semitic shepherd 
is a man of simple faith and steady purpose—a strong contrast 
to*the ordinary -Bedouin nomad—and when the children, in 
imagination, join his caravan, they enter upon a long and fas- , 
cinating journey. Beginning at Ur, over two thousand years 
ago, in what was doubtless an over-crowded tropic community, 
the journey ends on the Nile, with Joseph, now a great man in 
Egypt, saving his people from utter starvation. It is a journey 
of strong geographic contrasts. A few stories illustrative of this 
point are quoted.

THE MOUNTAINS 
These mountains are in the north. The mountains are high and 
some are low. There is snow on the tops. The snow stays there for a 
long time. Then it melts. It turns into water.. The water rushes down 
the mountain sides. It pushes wood and stones down. 
Mary 
The melting of the snow on the top of the mountains started the 
Euphrates River. The water came down so. fast that it carried big 
boulders to the bottom of the mountain. Then it left the boulders and 
carried good black soil down to Ur. The people planted grain in the 
good black soil. 
John D. , 
Soon many people heard about the rich soil in the river valley. 
They wanted to live there too. Pretty soon it was so crowded that 
Abraham didn’t have enough room for his sheep and goats and camels. 
Abraham said, “I will move away from Ur.” . 
Edward 
COMPOSITE READING LESSON 
Abraham sees Mount Hermon in the distance. “Oh, look, there’s 
a cloud in the sky,” Sarah cries. “Yes, see the pretty white cloud,” shout 
the children. “Watch it,” laughs Abraham. “If it moves it is a cloud. 
If it does not move it is snow on the top of a high mountain.” All day 
the children watch the lovely white spot. It does not move. At sunset 
it is pink. The children say, “We are glad it is a mountain; we shall see 
it in the morning.” They travel toward the mountain. They watch it 
every day. The children say, “The great. mountain is our guide.” One... 
day they camp near it. Sarah says, “How cool it is here. This mountain 
is our friend.” Soon Mount Hermon is left behind, but they: do not 
forget it. They often look back. 
Abraham's first stop after crossing .the Jordan River is at 
Shechem. It is in a tiny valley between two mountains: Ebal, 
3000 feet high on the north, and Gerizim, a few hundred feet 
lower, directly south. A newcomer, a migrating chief, ‘will 
doubtless climb Ebal to view the length and breadth of the land. 
Perhaps Abraham does this! What he sees from the top of 
Ebal is told in the words of the children, as follows: 
Abraham, Lot, and his chief steward climbed Mount Ebal to look 
around. They saw the Jordan River in the east. It was away down low. 
They looked far away to the north, They saw the top of Mount Hermon. 
They thought it was a cloud. They saw the.Lebanon Mountains. They 
saw the Mediterranean Sea in the west. They looked down the moun- 
tains and saw grain fields. Right down below they saw little villages 
and olive orchards. -

Abraham and Lot and his chief servant are looking down into 
Shechem and they see grain fields and Sarah’s black tent. 
Martha 
When Abraham looks south, he sees Mount Gerizim. He is point- 
ing down to the springs and waterfalls. He hears the shepherds calling 
their sheep. 
. Tim 
“READING LESSON—PREPARATION FOR TRIP TO JUDEA 
Abraham looks southward to a high and rugged country—a long 
stretch: of barren table-lands, separated from the plains. To those hills 
he will go when the flocks have rested and when he has bought grain and 
figs and oil. Sarah’s heart is glad. Meanwhile her hands have not been 
idle. All day she and her women. have -been spinning and weaving. 
Tomorrow they will patch the worn spots in the tents. The next day 
they will sit at the hand mills grinding grain, Other women will make 
the dough into thin.cakes and bake them over hot stones. Then, early 
the following day they will fill the water bottles with fresh water, sling 
them over the side of the kneeling camels, and journey southward. 
Additional quotations from the children’s papers are in- 
serted to show how they have followed the Bible stories and 
have pictured the Bible language. 
One day when Abraham was sitting under a tree, three messengers 
‘came. Abraham rose and went out to meet them. He bowed to the 
ground. He invited the three messengers to come under the tree. He 
went to the tent and got a pan of water so they could wash their feet. 
An

Sarah were going to have a baby son, and his name would be Laughter. 
Georgianna 
Abraham was very unhappy when Sarah died. He said to Isaac, 
“J want a place to keep Sarah’s body. We will have to buy a cave to 
bury her in.” When he was walking in the desert he saw a man. That 
man had some land. Abraham asked the man if he would sell his cave. 
The man said, “Oh, yes, you may have it.” Abraham went back and got 
Sarah’s body. He put it in the cave’ It is still there. 
Jeaw Helen 
Abraham loved Isaac. He did not want him to marry a maiden that 
worshipped idols, because he would grow up to be like her people. 
Jeanne . 
One day Abraham asked his chief steward to go across the moun- 
tains and rivers and deserts to get a wife for Isaac. So the next morn- 
ing, on Monday, he started off early. He thought to himself, “Maybe I
-P-A-G-E-47
Tue Course 1n History. 47 
will find’ one.” When the chief steward got to Abraham's old home in 
Mesopotamia, he really found a wife. Who do you think it was? It 
was Rebekah, Abraham's cousin. 
Mary B. 
This is Isaac, running to meet Rebekah, and the chief servant. 
When Rebekah opened her eyes and saw Isaac, she lighted off her camel 
to meet him. . 
Marjorie 
As stated elsewhere, the journey with Abraham begins at 
Ur and ends with Joseph in Egypt. But this great-great grand- 
son is no longer a keeper of sheep. The picture now given to 
the children shows Joseph as the chief overseer of all the king’s 
Jand. On Pharaoh’s boats he travels up and. down the Nile 
River. Without this river Egypt would be a desert. From it all 
the fields are watered. As overseer Joseph must know on what 
date, and how high, the river rises at different places. He there- 
fore visits the irrigating centers. Over all these places he sets. 
a chief. Under the chiefs are many captains. These men re- 
pair the shadoofs and keep them running day and night. They 
also distribute the water to the different farms. To the peasants, 
or farmers of the land, Joseph goes next.. It is his work to help 
them plow more fields and plant better seeds. Over the farmers 
he places one man. To him he gives many helpers. A great 
army of men is soon working under Joseph. Some are buying 
animals for the plows and threshing floors; others are shaping 
wooden plowshares; still others are flailing and winnowing the 
grain; masons are building great storehouses along the river 
banks. To these granaries come camels and asses, laden with 
golden grain. While clerks measure the wheat, scribes writing 
“with reed pens on papyrus rolls make a record which Joseph 
gives to the king. Pharaoh is pleased with Joseph’s work. He 
says, “I will honor your name.” He calls his royal scribes. He 
says, “Write these records on the walls of my palace and-in 
the halls of my temple.” Then Pharaoh calls his artists. He 
says to them, “Paint pictures of me and of Joseph’s work 
on the walls of my tomb, for he has served me well.” Joseph 
bows to the ground. He says, “My work is done; you have 
given my people a home in Egypt. I thank you, O King.” 
Bible literature, however, is not the only literature read. 
Jennie Hall’s book, “Weavers and Other Workers,” gives un-

ending joy to the children. The book contains many charming 
shepherd poems by Christina Rossetti, William Blake, and | 
others. It tells stories of Bedouin nomads, of Greek shepherds, 
of Giotto, the Italian shepherd -boy, of Persian dyers and Per- 
sian weavers, all of which add immeasurably to the pictures of 
primitive shepherd life. But the book also contains descriptions 
of old-fashioned methods of shearing, carding, spinning, and 
weaving. These stories are supplemented by experiments in 
washing, carding, and spinning, and by an excursion to the in- 
dustrial museum at Hull-House, where the children watch Irish 
and. Italian women spin with wheel, spindle, and distaff. In ad- 
dition, they watch women weaving on different types of looms. 
Sometimes they have a chance to watch a blind woman putting 
in a beautiful design. From this excursion the class always 
gather new ideas for their own designs. 
  
    
THE PUPPET PLAY—“THE LOST SHEEP”

share to the building up of the picture. Such close co-operation 
assures opportunity for variety of original expression. The 
children model clay animals and people for sand-table stories,

Posters of caravans are cut from lovely colored papers. Stories 
are illustrated and this year backgrounds were painted for 
puppet plays. For these little plays, gaily dressed clothespins 
make fascinating actors, and the animals used for the play 
may be celluloid, clay or cardboard, or they may be cut from 
folded drawing paper. The picture shows a child giving a 
puppet play called The Lost Sheep. He had read the story once. 
The play is simply the result of interest and vivid imagery. 
Our puppet plays must of necessity be repeated, since only 
half the grade can see the little stage at once. The following is 
a stenographic report of a play caught during the second . 
performance.

No, but maybe I can help you find it. I guess I had better count my

  JOSEPH BEFORE PHARAOH 
This scene was modelled in clay with figures and background decorated in 
bright colors. Joseph is kneeling before the king telling him his 
dream—the servants standing beside the king are 
fanning him with their long fans. 
In this grade bits of voluntary work are called “surprises.” 
As these surprises are always recognized by the teacher, offer- 
ings are received almost daily. Frequently the loveliest picture 
or story is dashed off on the blackboard before school opens. 
Again the doll, poem or whatnot, may be made at home. Fol- 
lowing the lesson on Abraham’s birthplace, at Mesopotamia, the 
following surprise was received: 
Abraham was a brave man. He was a strong man, too. He lived in a 
valley where the people prayed to golden moons and wooden gods. Abraham 
said, “We won't stay here. We will move, because I can’t pray to my God.” 
So they moved. Jean H. 
Flexible group work fosters rather than hinders original 
expression, Our art teacher is always a watchful gleaner of 
spontaneous written work. As everyone knows, children with 
vivid ideas draw or paint very rapidly. When such children 
finish their work, this art teacher encourages them to tell their 
stories in words on the opposite side of their pictures. Several 
descriptions in this outline are products from such art periods. 
Sometimes poems and songs originate best in a group 
lesson. For instance, the teacher writes a simple quotation from 
the Bible on the blackboard. It expresses joy at finding a well 
_ in the desert. The children, after reading it, illustrate it on the
-P-A-G-E-51
Tue Course In History 51 
blackboard. Their attention is called to the difference in their 
pictures—difference in detail, although all expressing the feeling 
of the same quotation. Then the teacher remarks casually, “The 
quotation is a very short one. Perhaps you may wish to add 
something to it.” Those who are interested write their thoughts 
over their pictures, the teacher helping with the spelling. When 
the thoughts are put together, they make the following little 
poems: 
I love you, oh well! 
We will dance, 
And we will sing. | 
We will. drink. 
This well has given us water. 
We will dance and sing around the well,’ 
We will dance and sing around the well, 
For we have found water in dry land. 
Next day the following lovely surprise is received: 
Oh, I love you, weil. 
Oh, I love you, well. 
You bring us sweet water from high, 
You run in underground passages, 
You are the rain that falls on the mountain tops. 
Margaret 
The vocabulary and feeling of these poems result from: 
1, Sand-table experiments; mountains built of stones, gravel, clay, dirt, etc. ; 
a concealed funnel attached to a long rubber tube; a sprinkler full of 
water to precipitate a rain storm. Result: a bubbling spring in a dry land. 
2. Hearing Bible language. 
3. Reading Bible language; short, vivid quotations describing climatic and 
seasonal pictures. 
4, Memorizing Bible language-songs,—For Jo, the winter is past, Twenty- 
third Psalm, etc. 
5. Blackboard illustrations—large, free work. 
The children are so pleased with their poems that the 
teacher says, “Wouldn’t it be fun to make up a tune for these 
words!” She tells them that people often make songs in this 
way. They are so happy that they say their thoughts out loud, 
..and the first thing these people know they are humming a tune 
to their words. The children sit still a few minutes, looking at 
their poems on the blackboard. Presently a hand comes up, 
and a child rises and sings his original tune. The teacher ex- 
claims, “Oh, I wish I could write down music as I can words.”

THIRD GRADE 
THE STORY OF THE GROWTH OF CHICAGO 
A child who has reached the third grade is ready for a ° 
broader conception of home. He breaks the shell of “home” 
and looks out upon the larger life of the community—recogniz- 
ing “home” in this larger sense. It is a big, noisy, bustling, 
- complicated thing, this city in which he lives, and he needs to 
have an intimate connection made with the limited “home” 
he has known. Now it is time to reveal to him the slow but 
thrilling processes by which the great city, with its innumerable 
houses, its huge factories, its markets, streets, water mains, 
sewers, has developed out of the simple but fundamental needs 
of foods, shelter, and clothing with which he has become fa- 
‘miliar in his first and second grade study of primitive peoples. 
To trace, therefore, the growth of Chicago through its va- 
ried changes--from the romantic days of the French explorers, 
trappers, and traders, through the pioneer epoch-with its rug- 
ged hardiness and dangers, into the village period with its 
problems of water supply and sewage disposal; and on to the 
culminating city with its vast needs and its conflicting interests 
—this closer study of environment is the natural and alluring 
work of the third grade. And what adds much to the fascina- 
tion of the study, giving it vividness and reality in a natural 
way, is the fact that men and women are still living who have 
been actors in this drama of American life. It is still possible 
for children to see them face to face, and to hear from their lips 
the story of these pioneer days. Here are our museums, rich 
in relics of those days so near to us in point of time, so remote 
in mode of life, and yet so like our days in fundamental prob- 
lems. Finally, there are the places of “historic interest” all 
about us, easily reached and potent in stimulating the interest 
and imagination of young and old. Here surely is a field for 
sowing seeds of good citizenship in these children who not many 
years hence will be the successors of those who have built up 
the great and still only half-developed Chicago. Here is the op- 
portunity to form the habit of thinking historically as well as 
55
-P-A-G-E-56
56 . SocraL ScrmNce SERIES 
observing intelligently and interestedly the life that now en- 
compasses us. It is only a beginning, to be sure, but if, as a 
child passes from grade to grade, his interest and attention are 
brought to bear upon new and more complex phases of the civic 
problem, “education for citizenship” will mean something real 
and vital. The value of such training lies in the realization that 
much is still to be accomplished before the city fulfills its obli- 
gations to all the men and women and children bound together 
in its life. Lo 
With something of all this in mind we take up the study 
of Chicago chronologically, trying always to make it possible 
for the children to live over again the life of bygone times, 
The stories of Indians, fur trappers, and pioneers, of transporta- 
tion and early industries, various problems that have picturesque 
aspects, do more than appeal to the children—they become a 
vital part of their lives. History, geography, science, all are 
so closely related as almost to merge into a single experience, 
pioneer life in Chicago. The purpose is not so much to teach 
events as to make vivid the conditions under which life was 
lived in the earlier times; to show reasons for the beginning of 
the city; to make clear its connections with prior times, its 
relations geographical and commercial to the surrounding 
country. Just in so far as this experience is real will the child 
become definitely conscious that he is a part of a large whole, 
and that the explanation and meaning of much of his daily life 
extends back into and is revealed by the past. 
No outline of the work can be very satisfactory. It is 
hoped, however, that from the outline here appended, together 
with actual reports written by the children, a fairly clear notion 
may be gained of what is accomplished in the course of the year.

presence was an incentive to the coming of the fur traders. The 
trip to the dunes was made in the fall, and upon our return each 
child wrote a report of it. One was in this form: 
Fort Dearborn was built on a high peak of land 
Which overlooked the dunes and sand. 
There the soldiérs used to stay, 
To protect the traders day by day. 
Chicago was then the Indians’ home. 
The Buffalo o’er the plains did roam. 
The Indians hunted them oft for food, 
With bows and arrows, weapons crude. 
In the swamp the reeds and cattails grew, 
The turnstone and sora rail lived there, too. 
The Indians came in the birch canoe, 
To get the, wild rice, white and new. 
In those days the people in houses were few, 
And the streets were just roads, we are told; 
There were many fields where the wild flowers grow. 
So was Chicago, Chicago of old.

A study was made of game and water birds. An excursion 
to the Lincoln Park Bird House, where the children saw the 
live birds, and a visit to the Academy of Sciences, where are the 
mounted specimens in their natural habitat—together with 
numerous books—-formed the basis of study. A chart was made, 
giving definite references to books, chapters, and pages dealing 
with each bird. Each child chose a bird to report on. When 
the necessary information was obtained as to the habits, food, 
homes, characteristics and economic value, an article was writ- 
ten. Paintings were made from mounted specimens. The 
articles were mimeographed, and, with sketches, were put into 
book form. 
In taking up the study of animals hunted and trapped for 
their furs, after a general discussion each child selected an

animal for intensive study. Charts were used for gathering 
information from books, visits were made to the Lincoln Park 
Zoo, the Field Museum, and the Academy of Sciences, and then 
the children were asked to use the data gathered and to write 
an imaginary study. One of these follows: 
I am a raccoon and live in the woods in a hollow high up in a tree. 
I eat oysters, little animals, insects and corn. I like nuts, too, and when I 
eat I sit up on my hind legs'to do it. My meat is very good to eat, and is 
particularly liked by colored people. They think it great fun to have hunting 
parties at night, and then it is that I must be watchful of my life. I have a 
black and white face and a very bushy tail and am about the size of a cat. My - 
tail has five rings, each of black and white, and my tip is black. My fur 
is valuable. I can swim quite well. Oftentimes, when I am feeling playful, 
_I pretend that I am going on a voyage. I swim until I am tired, and then 
get up on a grassy bank and rest. If J am near a farm I prowl around until 
I find something I like to eat. I am very careful to watch for the farmer’s 
boy, and to avoid any traps he may have set for me. I do not care to spend 
the rest of my life in a cage. When winter comes, I sleep the better part of it, 
I like to prowl by night the same as a fox. I am very paricular about my food, 
and always wash it before eating.

All the children made animal charades: 
My first is in bad and not in good; 
My second is in that but not in this; 
My third is in door and not in roar; 
My fourth is in gnaw but not in saw; 
My fifth is in me but not in you;

And is used for paint brushes here and there. (Badger)

Another helpful feature in the study of animals and furs 
has been the-éxhibit of furs, some skins and some made-up 
pieces, loaned by various fur dealers. The children learn to 
distinguish the different furs and to develop a real interest in 
the study.. The heroic side of the life of the fur traders and
-P-A-G-E-61
Tue Course in History 61 
trappers, their courage and cheerfulness in hardship and danger, 
their resourcefulness in meeting difficulties, furnishes an appeal 
that quickly arouses and holds children’s interest. As a result 
of the work of that period, a group of children wrote this story 
for our school Record (student publication) : 
This is the story of our experience on our first fur-trading trip. 
Our equipment consisted of ammunition, guns, traps, blankets, tents, 
provisions, and canoes. We took six or seven French voyageurs to help . 
us along. They were brave and courageotis men; also jolly and willing 
workers. We left rather late in the autumn, and were very much afraid 
. of the coming snow storms and the cold weather which would freeze 
the river water. The freezing of the river would force us to leave our 
canoes behind. We paddicd along for several weeks’ occasionally sighting 
herds of buffalo in the distance. The sky for days had looked dull 
and gray, and we were expecting a storm. We finally landed and had 
our voyageurs pitch our tents, while we had our supper of pemmican arid 
deer meat. The following day some Indians who had been hunting 
’ buffalo passed. We bought some ponies of them. We left the canoes 
and started for the Indian camp, where we bought meal and other pro- 
visions. As we had been greatly delayed by the. shooting of many 
rapids and the crossing of portages, our supply of provisions had run 
‘low. After traveling for several days, the storm we feared came upon 
us. We woke one morning and found it snowing heavily. .We sent 
some of our men out to get game. After twenty-four hours had elapsed, 
they returned, bearing a few antelopes. We asked the men how it came 
they were so successful. They replied that it was simply luck. When 
the snow began, the antelopes began to tramp down the snow, but all 
the time the storm was raging, so. the snow had formed a wall around 
the antelopes. It was then easy to shoot them im a kind of trap of their 
own making. We were kept in camp for ten or twelve days. As our 
supplies:ran low, we had little food for the ponies and we were forced to 
use some of them for food. We were hoping for a thaw which would be 
followed by a freeze. This would harden the crust of the snow, which 
would enable us to travel more easily. At last we were able to resume 
our journey toward the coast. One day we spied an Indian encampment. 
We approached the Indians, The chief passed us the pipe of peace, 
which we smoked. That evening there was a feast prepared in our 
“honor. Presents were expected from us, so we gave the Indians many 
trinkets. Next day we traded. When we had, finished trading, we had 
about five thousand dollars in beavers. From our own trapping we had 
twenty beavers, twelve foxes, thirteen pine martens, and one silver fox. 
Silver foxes are very rare, so we were lucky to get one. We started once 
more for the Coast, and after several weeks arrived there safely.

The following morning exercise was given on fur-bearing 
animals: 
In early Chicago, many fur-traders came to get furs and to trade 
with the Indians. Mr. Kinzie established a number of fur-trading posts 
all around the country, and the French voyageurs went out to collect 
furs for him. We have been studying about fur-bearing animals and those 
whose pelts were valuable in early days and still are. Each child had’ an 
animal to study. We read from different books. We had note books 
and we took notes as we read. We looked for food, home, habits, and 
“ appearance. We looked for the value of the fur and the value of ‘the 
animal to man. After we had gotten all our material together, we wrote 
a story about our animal. All of our stories will be put together in a 
book on Fur Bearing Animals, and will look something like this. 
Marjorie 
  MORNING EXERCISE ON FUR BEARING ANIMALS 
We made excursions to the Field Museum and to the Academy of 
Sciences, to see the. mounted animals there. We also went to the Lincoln 
Park Zoo to see the North American fur-bearing animals. Most of the 
animals we wanted to see were still hibernating. ‘There were three badgers 
in a hospital, but Mr. Parker said we could not see them, as it was not 
safe for children to go into the hospital. They had a Colorado bob cat 
there but he liked his nice warm box so well that the keeper. had to poke 
him with a stick to get him out to introduce him to us.

We went to Marshall Field’s fur section. We saw a great many 
mounted animals there—beavers, muskrats, fishers, otters, minks, ermines, 
- weasels and animals like that. We then went into their cold-storage 
rooms, and we saw many different kinds of furs there. They gave us 
little souvenirs. They were pen-wipers, with different kinds of fur but- 
tons on them. We then saw them cleaning furs. When they clean furs, 
they use some very fine sawdust, with cleaning fluid of some kind on it, 
and put this over the furs. Then they blow that out of the fur with 
compressed air. We saw them making some neck pieces, and we saw 
them making a coat. They had a large board, and on it was nailed a 
muskrat coat, with the fur inside. And on another board they had nailed 
the collars and cuffs and sleeves. These were dampened and stretched. |

The animals we have been studying about were either meat-eaters 
or gnawers. The meat-eaters, or carnivorous animals, have large canine 
teeth like these (holding up the skull of:a lion). Some of the animals 
with large canine teeth are the wolf, the fox, the dog, the cat, arid the 
lynx. The gnawers have incisors to gnaw with. Some of them are the 
beaver, the muskrat, mice and rats. The "family is called rodentia. 
Otto 
The muskrat lives in a hole in the bank of a stream, or he lives in 
swamps. His house looks like a small haycock. It is made of sticks 
and rushes and grass plastered together with mud. His entrance is under 
water. This is a picture of some of the muskrat houses. His food is 
mussels, and vegetables, and grain and sweet corn. He is a very clean 
animal. When he finds some bread that somebody has put out; he will 
stick the bread in the water before he eats it. He likes to swim around 
in the water, for his home is always near the water, and in winter he cuts 
a hole in the ice so that he can get back and forth to his home. He is 
of little use to farmers, except his pelt. When a trap is set for him, it 
is usually put near the entrance of his home in the water. This is the 
skin of a muskrat my brother had. You can see how it is stretched-over 
this wedge-shaped board. Coats are made of the natural skin of the 
muskrat. When the guard hairs are plucked, and the under fur is + dyed, 
the fur is then sold as Hudson seal. 
Alexander 
The beaver is one of the rodent family. He is a gnawer. He builds 
his home in a stream, where there are trees and branches to make it out 
of. He builds it out of sticks of mud or clay. Here is a picture of a 
beaver at work. In this you can see the beaver’s tail. He uses his tail 
for three things: As a rudder in swimming, as a brace when he is cut- 
ting down a tree, and as a signal to other beavers when there is any 
danger, by clapping it on the water. This picture shows the beaver 
ghawing. You can see his large incisors. He likes to live where there 
are trees, so he can cut them down and float them to his home or 
dam, This picture shows a beaver dam. He makes a dam because he 
wants the water deeper, so he can get away from his enemies by’ swim-
-P-A-G-E-64
64 SocraL ScreENcE SERIEs 
ming under water, and he has his food stored down there in the winter, 
and the water has to be deep enough so that it will not freeze. This 
shows (holding a. piece of a gnawed tree) how the beaver gnaws the 
trees. You can plainly see some of the marks of his teeth. In this pic- 
ture, he is using his tail as a support. Here is another piece of wood 
that a beaver has gnawed. He likes to eat the bark off of the trees. He 
likes poplar trees,. and aspen and birch, and lily roots. 
  
    
There. are two kinds of beaver, the North American and the South 
American. The South American beaver is smaller, and his tail is not so 
wide. This is a picture of the South American beaver. His fur is not 
so long nor so thick. The fur of the South American beaver is called 
nutria. ‘The North American beaver has longer and thicker fur and a 
wider tail. His tail is about eight inches long and four or five inches 
“ wide. The tail of the South American beaver is eight inches long and is 
about an inch and a half wide, and is flat. > Junior 
The‘ badger looks at night like a big black shadow, and in the day 
time when he is lying down, he looks like a big white stone. His food 
is ground squirrels, mice, rats, berries, and all sorts of insects. His 
favorite food is honey. When he gets it, the bees try to sting him, but his 
fur is so thick that they cannot hurt him. His fur looks like silver and 
ebony in the night time. In the day time he is black and white and brown 
and sometimes gray. His home is in the pine forests. He is useful to 
farmers, because he eats so many insects that are injurious to trees, and- 
so many mice. His: fur is used for collars and trimming, and shaving 
brushes are made from badger hairs. Mary

  The wolverine's fur is darkish brown. He has very sharp claws. 
His claws are black, and they are long—over an inch long. The wolverine 
has little ears, and his nose is long. Once a trapper went out of his 
house, and when he came home he found everything was gone. The 
wolverine had taken everything out of his home and left only the walls 
standing. Then the man followed the wolverine’s tracks and got back 
most of his things. The wolverine will follow a trapper, and every trap 
he will unset, and take the food out without getting hurt. He is a great 
nuisance to trappers, because he steals so many animals-that have valuable 
furs. 
Fred 
The fisher is the largest member_of the weasel family. He likes 
frogs and mice and birds. He will also eat porcupines. He tries to 
turn the porcupine over, because underneath it is soft. The porcupine 
sticks him with his quills, but the fisher will not give up until he suc- 
ceeds.. The quills of the porcupine are poisonous to other animals. The 
fisher gets many in his nose and paws, but the quills do not seem to, 
poison him. . 
The fisher lives in the hollow of a tree, and his nest is built with 
sticks and leaves. He can jump very high from the ground, and loves to 
be in the tree tops. Most of the fisher pelts that the trapper gets have 
porcupine quills in them. His fur makes a very valuable and beautiful 
neck searf. ,

The lynx is a great big cat, and his fur is spotted. His food is 
squirrels, rabbits, mice, and he likes larger animals, but he will not .at- 
tack a deer or a large animal unless it is wounded. He is very much of 
a coward. The lynx has four or five babies a year, and the home is jin 
a hollow usually at the bottom of a tree. This picture shows the lynx 
taking some game home to his babies. In this picture you can see how 
the lynx likes to lie out on the limb of a tree and watch for his food. 
Jessamine 
The skunk is an animal about as big as acat. His fur is black, with 
white stripes running from his head to his tail. He eats frogs, mice, 
squirrels, and chickens. Some people think that the skunk is not a clean 
animal, but they are mistaken. Some people visited a fox farm and 
found the. place very unclean, but they visited a skunk farm and they 
said it was a pleasanter place to visit, and that the skunk was a very 
clear animal. He only uses his odor to protect himself. When two 
skunks fight, they fight fairly; and they do not use their odor on one 
another. Skunk fur is sold as marten. 
‘Lydia 
The red fox lives in a hole in the ground. He is a very tricky - 
animal. One of his tricks is to go across very thin ice when dogs are 
following him, and the ‘ice will break with the dogs, and the current 
will draw them under and they will drown. The fox is very sly; When 
there is a fox hunt he will circle around the dogs and hunters and watch 
them, and they will think that he is ahead of them. He eats rabbits, 
mice, poultry, and robs birds’ nests, and he eats woodchucks, frogs and 
beetles, and when he cannot get anything else he will eat fruit. ‘His 
fur is a reddish gray and his skin is not very valuable. It is used for 
scarfs. 
Virginia 
Red fox parents may have babies that are cross foxes, silver foxes, 
or red foxes, but people have found that silver-fox parents always have 
silver fox babies, and so many men have gone into the silver-fox farm 
business. The red fox, the cross fox and silver fox may all be of one 
family. The silver fox fur is very valuable. 
Richard 
The marmot or woodchuck is a very interesting animal. The wood- 
chuck eats vegetables, roots, tender shoots, and all kinds of plants and 
sometimes berries. He is a hibernating animal. Maybe you do not know 
what hibernating means. Hibernating means that the animals will sleep 
all winter long. He eats a,good lot in summer time, and gets fat, and 
then in winter time when. it begins to get cold he will go to his home and 
stay there for six months and maybe seven. Hibernating means that 
when he goes to sleep his heart slows down and his muscles don’t work, 
for the muscles never work without food. If you put your hand on your 
pulse, you will feel your heart beat, but when an animal is hibernating 
the heart seems to stop. In February he wakes up and comes out to see
-P-A-G-E-67
Tue Course ry History 67 
what the weather is. If he sees his shadow, he goes back and sleeps 
again. But he finally comes out in the spring, and gets ready for the next 
winter by getting fat. 
The woodchuck lives inthe ground. He digs his home 25 feet down 
and then goes off in a different direction. He brings up some clay and 
builds a little mound on top of the ground. Then he will stand up on 
the mound on his hind legs and his forepaws up. If the mound is high 
enough he can see if an enemy is coming. If he sees an enemy he will 
drop right down into his burrow. As, soon as the enemy is gone, he 
will come up again.’ The skunk is one of the fiercest enemies that the 
woodchuck has, and the woodchuck will run away from a snake. Most 
of the marmot fur that is used for coats and lining is_made from the 
European marmot. . ’ Ruth 
The otter belongs to the weasel family. He is four or five feet long, 
and his tail is long and round. The otter’s fur is used unplucked, and is 
one of the most durable furs. But sometimes it is plucked and dyed. 
-Then it looks something like a. Hudson seal, but it is heavier. The 
otter is a very playful animal. He will slide down snow banks in winter, 
and in summer he likes to find a clay bank and slide down into the water. 
His food is fish and frogs, and sometimes he will eat water fowls-or rab- 
bits. And if it is impossible to get any of these, he will eat chickens. 
This'is a story I wrote about an otter: . 
One day two little hungry otters-stood on the bank of a stream in 
the woods. Their mother, with her smooth brown coat of fur and her 
short legs, stood on the bank watching the stream. Her sharp eyes soon 
discovered a large salmon gliding lazily through the water. She dived 
like a flash and with one fast bite in the back of the salmon’s neck 
secured a meal for her hungry cubs. The salmon quivered and died in 
the otter’s jaws. The mother quietly swam to shore with her prey. 
The’ hungry cubs lost no time in devouring it.. The mother was still 
hungry, because the cubs had greedily eaten the entire fish. Only the 
bones were left in the soft white sand, so she went in search of her own 
dinner. She left the romping cubs in the grass and quietly slipped away 
through the underbrush to a different pool, where there were some old 
trout which she liked very much. These trout she knew were lazy, and 
she usually found them at the bottom of the pool, where they were 
watching for the chance to feed on their young. Then she returned to 
her cubs, who had not noticed her absence, and headed them for the 
shallowest pool she could find in the forest. Slowly she went in and 
swam to the other side of the pool. But the cubs were afraid to go near 
the water. Their mother then took them on her back and swam out. 
She then dived and the babies had to swim. 
Once the otter was a land animal, but as the hunting was poor on 
land she adapted herself to the water. So she has to teach her cubs to 
swim. The otter is one of the most graceful animals in water. When it dives, there is no ripple to mark its disappearance.

In the study of Indian life, outline A-3, an Indian book by 
Hopkins was used the first part of the year. The book was 
taken apart, and a chapter (a complete story in itself) was 
given to each child, It was the duty of each child to present a 
report to the group. Large paintings were made to illustrate 
‘the subject. Models in clay were used; also twigs and cloths to 
represent the homes. These subjects were covered: An In-, 
dian home, method of traveling, making of pottery, weaving, 
dressing skins, hunting buffalo, hunting antelope, buffalo dance; 
hunting wild horses, making pemmican, storing food, hunting 
prairie dogs, swimming, shooting, games, etc. 
The following plan for a series of lessons on pioneer trans- 
portation, point C-2 in the outline, was worked out by an as- 
sistant under the supervision of the grade teacher. 
Point 1. Why did people come west? 
a. Because soldiers returning from the war of 1812 brought 
news of fertile plains and unwooded prairies to. their 
friends in the East. 
-b. Because of the ever-increasing population that de- 
manded an outlet. 
LESSON I. Why did people come west? 
1. Ask questions and consider each answer carefully. 
2. Show pictures of eastern as contrasted with western farm lands. 
Let children compare what is seen in each picture and draw their 
own conclusions as to which they would prefer, and why.. Which 
would a farmer prefer, and why? (Use pictures of New England 
and Illinois. farms.) 
3. Pass to sand tray to study topographical map. Show New England

The following’ story is the outcome of the preceding work. 
» Parts of it were taken verbatim from the children’s dictation,- 
and parts were rearranged by the practice teacher: 
MR. AND MRS. KINZIE’S TRAVELING EXPERIENCES 
‘The Mr. Kinzie that this story is about is the son of John Kinzie, 
the fur trader. This story is about him when he is married and grown up. 
Mr. and Mrs. Kinzie were in Detroit with some friends and were listening - 
to their stories about men who had been becalmed and other people 
who had been caught in a storm. But they only laughed at these stories. 
They went down to the dock and were glad to see a beautiful boat. 
That is, to. them it was beautiful. Their friends wished them a success- 
ful journey. The boat had two cabins. Its name was the . Henry 
Clay, One of the cabins was for men and the other for women. They 
had a nice journey for a little while, but after a while they struck a storm 
and it began to get dark, and the rain began to come down in little 
streams from the roof in the ladies’ cabin. They had to stand in a 
corner, and then the water began to come down there, too. They had to 
climb in the berths, and for a-while it was safe, but soon it began to 
leak there, too. They at last went into the men’s cabin. They told 
Mr. Kinzie and the other men about the awful time they had had. They had 
to go into the berths again. There they kept dry. The next day they 
went on deck. They saw green shores but no houses. Once in a while 
they saw an Indian tepee. Finally they reached Mackinac Island. They 
were happy to get out of the wet boat. The dock was full of Indians 
who ‘were friendly to Mr. Kinzie. They smiled when they saw them, 
and said: “Bonjour, Monsieur. John.” . - 
The Kinzies went from Mackinac Island to Green Bay in the Henry- 
Clay. It took them several days. : : 
Mr. Kinzie was the agent for the Winnebago Indians. He was_ 
going to stop at Fort Winnebago, to pay them for the land our govern-
-P-A-G-E-73
  Tuer Course in History 73 
ment had bought from them. The Kinzies were going to take a Mack- 
jinaw boat from Green Bay to Fort Winnebago. A Mackinaw boat is 
oblong and thirty feet long and about seven feet wide. In the middle of 
the boat a canvas is stretched over little poles. It looks like a small 
cabin. Mrs. Kinzie’s piano was in a box under the canvas. Mrs. Kinzie 
was a musician, and she wanted to take her piano with her. They put a 
mattress over it and used it as a couch in the afternoons. © ~ oO 
On each, side of the boat there were French voyageurs and soldiers 
rowing, and the voyageurs sang songs to keep time with the oars. Mr. 
Kinzie helped to row. He helped a soldier who seemed very weak and 
Jooked as though he had run away from home. - They came to many 
rapids and the bourgeois would calf “Men overboard.” Then the men 
would have to jump out and pull the boat up the rapids. They were 
going agaist the current all this time and it was very hard to row. 
Sometimes the boat got stuek between. two rocks, and the men had to 
get out and push it through. Sometimes the rapids were so.swift that the 
men had to take everything out of the boat except the piano and carry 
it around. Sometimes they would have to pull the boat along with ropes. 
‘The first night they stayed at Mr. Grignon’s house, at Kakalin; the other 
nights they camped on shore. The Kinzie’s had one tent and the soldiers 
another. This was the first time Mrs. Kinzie had ever been West and 
-camped out-of-doors. They had a fire in front of the camp. Mrs. Kinzie 
thought it was very beautiful. She sketched a picture of the river with 
the sun shining on it. . 
The French voyagéurs cooked ham on sticks over the fire. They. 
ate from tin plates and drank from tin cups. In the morning the bour- 
geois would call, “How, how, how!’ as loud as he could, to wake the 
people for breakfast. After eight days of such traveling, they came to 
Fort Winnebago. Mr. and Mrs. Kinzie lived at Fort Winnebago all 
that winter. In the spring they decided to go to Chicago, to-see their 
mother and father. First they baked biscuits and boiled ham. They 
decided to go by pack horses. They took two men. One was named 
Plante, who was the guide, and the other was named Pierre Roy. Plante 
was supposed to know the way, but he did not. Mr. and Mrs. Kinzie 
each had a horse. They also took one pack horse. To the pack horse 
they tied several bundles of biscuits and their hams. -Each one had a 
tin cup on his saddle bow. The men each had. a piece of flint in his. 
pocket and a piece of steel. They planned to follow some Indian trails. 
They took a tent, so they could camp. Mrs. Kinzie had a hunting 
knife hung around her neck. Behind the Eort was a little creek called 
Duck Creek. They carried their canoe on an ox-cart. When they came 
to the creek, they took the canoe off the cart and put it into the water. 
Then they put’ the trunk into the canoe. Mrs. Kinzie thought it would 
be best to sit on the trunk, but just as she got into the canoe, some dog 
jumped into her lap and upset the canoe. Mrs. Kinzie got all wet. Mr. 
Kinzie had to carry her over on his shoulder. Mr. Kinzie asked her if 
she wanted to go back to the Fort. She would not go. She rode all
-P-A-G-E-74
74 SocraL Scrince SERIES 
day in her wet clothes. It was growing cold, and she had on kid gloves, 
and her hands were swelling from the cold. After they had ridden a 
long way, they found a place to put up their tent. They made a fire 
by striking flint and steel together; they put Mrs. Kinzie’s coat near 
the fire to let it dry. It froze stiff. It looked like Mrs. Kinzie standing 
there. For supper they had ham and biscuits. ‘The biscuits were used 
as plates. They cut the ham on the biscuits. They stirred their coffee 
with their knives. Before they went to bed, they tied their horses’ 
front and back legs together so they could not run away. Then they 
rolled up in their blankets under the tent and were very comfortable. 
While riding, they sometimes saw one or two prairie wolves or 
_deer, and the dogs would chase them away. Once in a while they 
came to an Indian village. The Indians came out and asked Mr. Kinzie 
for bread. But Mr. Kinzie did not dare give them any because they 
hardly had enough for themselves. Mr. Kinzie toid them so in their 
Indian language. 
The second night they reached Mr. Morrison's house. They stayed 
there all night. Before leaving the next morning they asked for more 
biscuits. They were afraid their supply would run out. The next day 
it snowed hard. Mr. and Mrs. Kinzie could hardly see the trail, but 
they went on. They had been told to keep on until they came to another 
trail, but they could not find it. Finally they made camp and had their 
supper aud went to bed. It kept snowing. In the night the tent poles 
broke, and the tent fell in on them from the weight of the snow. Mr. 
Kinzie had to cut new poles. In the morning they went on. Then Mr. 
-Kinzie saw that Plante, the guide, did: not know the way, so he took 
the lead. They did not eat much, because they had not much left. 
Toward night they saw a fence.’ They were very happy, because they 
knew there must be a house near by. They asked what place it was: 
They found out it was. Mr. Hamilton’s house, the very place they had 
meant to reach. This shows what a good woodsman Mr. Kinzie was and 
how well he could tell directions. 
_ When they came to the Rock River, there was a ferry boat. It was 
just a little row boat. A path was cut in the ice so that the boat could 
run. It was sunset as they crossed. The sky was yellow and red; 
so was the streak of water where the ice was cut away. The horses 
swam across the river. That night they stayed at Mr. Dixon’s house. 
The next day they lost their trail, They wandered all day. Toward 
evening of the second day, Mrs. Kinzie’s horse began to kick and jump 
and didn’t want to go any further. Then Mrs. Kinzie knew that_ there 
were Indians near, because her horse did not like them. Just then a 
little Indian dog ran out to meet them. Then they went behind the 
bushes and found two Indian squaws. They were digging Indian 
potatoes. . . 
Mr. Kinzie asked the. squaws where they were, but they did not 
know. Then Mrs. Kinzie asked where the squaws lived, and they said, 
“Across the river.’ Mr. Kinzie was glad, because he knew they must 
have a canoe there. He asked them if they had a canoe, and they said,
-P-A-G-E-75

“Yes, but a very little one.” So the squaws paddled them across, one 
at a time. On the other bank was an Indian village. Here they were 
able to get something to eat.. It was the first time they had eaten for 
two days.. The Master of the lodges guided them to the nearest cabin 
on the following morning. From here they knew the trail to Chicago. 
It took them eight and a half days to make the trip that it takes us only 
five hours to make. -

WATER SUPPLY 
HOW THEY OBTAINED WATER IN EARLY CHICAGO 
In early Chicago the people did not have a water faucet to turn on, 
_ but they had good water to drink. They would go down to the river, 
which had many little piers extending out into it. They would get down 
on their hands and knees and dip water up into wooden pails. The 
water was very pure, sparkling, clean and clear. The banks were very ~ 
pretty. There were flowers and grass on them, and they sloped down 
jo the water's edge. The small piers were built out because in shallow 
places there was earth or sand at the bottom. If they touched the bot- 
tom, the pail would roil the water. If they used the piers the water 
would be clean, clear, and cool. “After a few more settlers had come to 
. Chicago, people became careless and threw all sorts of garbage and dead 
animals which they wanted to get rid of into the river. The water soon - 
became very impure, and sickness came, so they had to find some other 
way to get water. 
R. K, 
    
WELL WATER 
When the river water became impure, people dug wells. The 
people ured the wells for some time, but in the spring when more people 
came to Chicago and Chicago got more and more crowded, people 
began to get careless again. Pretty soon the wells became poisoned, 
and this is how it happened. The people thrgv garbage on the ground 
near the wells. Some of the people were too lazy to make a trough for
-P-A-G-E-77
Tue Course History 77 
    
  their pigs, and threw what the pigs were to eat right on the ground. 
So in the spring the rain water soaked the dish water and some of the 
garbage and other impurities into the wells. The swamp water over- 
flowed into them, too. Chicago was then a funny’ looking town, with 
its well sweeps, twice as high as the log cabins. 
  
   
-P-A-G-E-78
73 *  SocraL Screwce SERIES 
  - . - THE WATER CART 
After the river water became impure, the people had wells; ‘after 
the wells were not a success, people were at a loss to know what to do. 
A man soon had a clever idea. He got a cart and a horse and put a 
large barrel called a hogshead in the cart. He went to the south shore 
of Lake Michigan and dipped up clean water and put it into his hogs- 
head.. He then went around the town, calling at the. top of his voice, 
“Water!” “Water!” Many people got water, and those who did had a 
“hogshead at the back of their cabin. The water man attached his hose 
to their hogshead and filled it. The people that could not afford to buy 
the water cither drew it from the poisoned wells or drank the river water. 
And so this kept up for a long time. 
J.T. 
LOG PIPE SYSTEM 
Some of the people were too poor to buy water from the water 
man. More and more people came to Chicago. Soon. a company of 
men got together. They said, “We can supply water for the people. 
At the same time we can make money for ourselves.” So they made a 
pier on the south side of the river. It reached out 700 feet from the 
shore, Then a log pipe ran along the pier. One end was bent down into 
the water. They also had little log pipes which ran underground to the 
log cabins, People were filled with joy when they saw the fresh clean 
water come out of the faucets. This was a success for some time, but 
soon the company of men were disappointed. Little fish and little pieces 
of wood came through the faucets. This greatly dissatisfied the people 
of Chicago. Many people were too poor to pay for this water, so some 
still bought from the man with the cart, and the poorest people used 
the wells and the river. . 
DK, 
FIRST CITY WATER WORKS 
After the log pipe system had failed, people wanted good drinking 
water, so the city built the water works on Chicago Avenue, north of the 
river. The reason for building the water works was that the poor people 
could not afford to buy the water. If the city built the water works, | 
it would not cost so much, so they put engineers to work. It took 
three years to build it. They planned to dig a trench at the bottom of 
the lake and to drivé piles all around the trench and fill it up with stones. 
An iron pipe was laid at the bottom of the trench instead of wooden 
pipes, and the end. of the pipe bent up instead of down. Around the 
bent-up end they drove piles and filled them in with stones. When the 
storms came this kept the water in a quiet basin. Over the bent-up end 
was a strainer to keep out all impurities.

SECOND CITY WATER WORKS 
The first city water works had been successful for many years, but 
more and more people came, so the old-fashioned pumps could not sup- 
“ply them at all. A man by the name of Mr. Chesborough thought’ of 
a new plan. He was a city engineer. “We can get clean, clear water 
two miles out in Lake Michigan.” The people laughed and said, “How 
can you get water from two miles out?” He said, “We will build a house’ 
out there.” The people said, “You can’t build a house without a founda- 
tion.” So Mr. Chesborough built a house on shore. It had five sides. 
It was called a pentagon. It wasn’t quite as big as the Palmer House 
when it was completed. They caulked it and launched it, as they do 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-80
80 : SocraL Scrince SERIES 
a boat. They had tugs tow the house out to where Mr. Chesborough 
‘ planned to have it. They they opened the doors and let it sink. The 
house was built so high that part of it stuck out of the water. They 
put stones all around it, to make a firm foundation. Then they built a 
house on top.. Through the center was a cylinder. The men went 
down this cylinder and began to dig. When they- got a certain distance, 
they turned towards shore. At the same time the people on shore were 
digging, and when they got down a certain distance, they turned out 
toward the crib. Sometimes, they met a big boulder; sometimes they 
could hear the paddle wheels of boats above their heads. Sometimes 
they met with gas, and_ther they would light it -and run. One day. 
the papers said they had only a little ways to go and that by to-morrow: 
they would meet. Now, what would they do, meet or pass each other? 
It was great luck that they met each other within the space of an inch. 
There was much rejoicing and merry making. Then Chicago had fresh, 
clear, clean water at last. R.G. 
PUMPING RIVER WATER BACKWARDS 
Mr. Cheseborough’s plan was a great success for some time, but 
even two miles out in the lake impurities of the river affected the peo- 
ple’s drinking water. People said, we must do something to turn the 
river backwards. They put pumps in at Bridgeport and tried to pump 
the river backwards. It wasn’t a success at all, because the river would. 
. go backwards and forwards. . Then they even tried to dig the Illinois 
and Michigan Canal deeper, to try to make the Chicago River flow west- 
ward. But that was not a success. New cribs were built three and 
four miles out in the lake. But the sewerage in the river still sent 
impurities out. J.T. 
THE DRAINAGE CANAL 
we. When the pumps at Bridgeport failed to pump the river " water 
backwards, people ® said, “We must dig a drainage canal that will do the 
work.” They began the Canal in 1892, and it was finished in 1900. 
Sometimes they dug through soil; and sometimes through rock and soil. 
And again they had to blast through solid rock. The canal was 28 miles 
long, and from 160 to 290 feet wide, and 35 feet deep. They wanted 
the canal to be a drainage and ship canal. The whole canal was below 
the level of the lake, and it sloped so that the top of the canal was 
six feet higher than the bottom, so that the river would surely flow in 
that direction. When the canal was finished, they let the water in. 
It took thirteen days to fill the canal. They were afraid’ the water 
would overflow some of the towns along the river, so they built a dam 
with large gates in it at Lockport, so they could regulate the flow of 
the water. The river is still used as a sewer. People were complaining 
about. the river water, because it was so black and foul-smelling, but 
after-the lake water began to flow in, it changed from a black to a green 
color” and there wds no odor to the water. 
- : ‘Mary DeT. 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
Tue Course in History - 81 
INTERCEPTING SEWERS — 
After the drainage canal was finished, the sewers on. the South 
Side still flowed into the lake. There was a crib at Hyde Park, and 
the sewerage from the South Side’ of Chicago affected the people’s drink- 
ing water. So the city said, “We must build an intercepting sewer, 
and let all this sewerage from the South Side empty into that.” This 
conriected with the Chicago River and the drainage canal. A great many 
“streets were torn up for a long time, but now all the ‘impurities are 
taken away from Lake Michigan. . 
. Cc. B. 
NORTH SHORE DRAINAGE CANAL’ 
After the drainage canal was finished, the lake water was still 
impure. Then the people said that the sewers at Evanston and other 
towns on the north shore of the lake empty into Lake Michigan, and 
the south current of the lake carries those impurities down to’ our cribs, 
so people said we should build another Drainage Canal. Engineers got 
to work. They dug a canal which connected Lake Michigan with the 
North Branch of the Chicago River. When it was finished, all the sew- 
. erage of the towns north- flowed into that canal instead of into Lake 
Michigan, so this took all impurities away from the lake and from 
our cribs. : -

The following morning exercise on transportation indicates 
the method by which one group objectified in hand work its 
study of transportation and of the importance of Chicago as a 
great railroad center. (Point E-6 of outline.) 
TRANSPORTATION 
Last year the third grade studied about early Chicago, and the 
different ways of traveling in the early days. We decided to make a 
train of cars in the woodshop. . 
  
    
We chose the cars because they are made just outside of the city, 
and because Chicago is such a very large railroad center, and because 
going by train is the most rapid way of traveling. 
The reason that we did not make a passenger traiti is because the 
Passenger cars are too hard to make.
-P-A-G-E-82
82 SoctaL ScrmNCE SERIES 
  We also made plans for the truck, the wheels and the track. We 
thought it would be nice to give the cars to the kindergarten children. 
J.P. 
Two children worked on a car. If each child made one, car, there 
would be too many cars, and we would not get them finished. One 
worked on the sides and floor; the other one made the ends, the top, 
and the running board. We put two coats of paint on them. One child 
put on one coat of paint, and the other put on the other coat. “We” 
grooved the sides and ends with a carving tool to make them look like 
boards funning up and down. We used large staple tacks for the steps. 
We named each car and planned the lettering. We called the cars the 
“E,W. P. Fast Freight.” 
M,Z. 
We wanted to know the capacity of our cars. We used inside 
méasurements. The box car is 18% inches long, 4 inches wide, and 3 
inches high. I made a drawing of the floor of the car. We used 1 inch 
cubes to see how many cubic inches there were in one layer. We found 
- 74 cubic inches. In three layers there were 222 cubic inches. 
I made a drawing of the floor of the coal car, too. In the first 
fayer there were 5814 cubic inches. In two layers there were 116% 
cubic inches. Vo

  Each child used the book and selected the car he liked the best. 
I chose the coal car. It was 34 feet long. We decided upon the scale 
to use in making the cars. We first thought we would make them on 
the scale of one inch to a foot, but 34 inches would be ‘too long. Then 
we thought that 4% inch to a foot would be better. - 
This is the plan of my car.

  When we made the wheels we used the same scale that we did 
in making the cars, only we made the flange bigger. The reason we 
did this is because the little cars are not heavy enough to stay on the 
track. ,

  We wanted to have iron wheels for our cars, but we could not 
make them, We used Frank's wooden model for casting wheels in lead 
because we wanted to know how they cast large wheels. We took a 
flask and pounded molder-sand into it. A molder’s flask is made of two 
‘frames and is held together by wooden pegs. ‘These frames are to hold 
the sand in which the model is imbedded. We took one frame and 
pounded molder’s sand into it and set the wooden wheels into that. 
Then we sprinkled dry sand on so the molder’s sand in the one half 
would not stick to the other when the two were taken apart. We then 
took the two halves apart and took the wooden modél out: We made 
air-holes in the flask on top with a hatpin, and a larger hole to pour the 
molten lead in. We put the flask together again and poured the lead 
in the hole. When cool we took the flask apart and this is the way 
the lead wheels looked. The reason there are these holes in them is 
because there were not enough air-holes in the flask and ‘the ‘melted 
lead couldn't push the air out.

As this outline shows, history cannot be taught alone. All 
the other subjects are interwoven through it. History is net 
science, it is not art, it is not geography; it is all these in one. 
It is a record of life and activity, and for clear imaging in any

    FOURTH GRADE 
THE STUDY OF GREEK LIFE 
Because children of nine are not only susceptible to beauty 
but also fearless in expressing their emotions, we have chosen 
‘for our history work in the Fourth Grade the study of a beauty- 
loving and expressive people—the Greeks. / 
In the commonly accepted use of the word history, as mean- 
ing political history, we may not be said to teach this sub- 
ject at all. Our aim is not to teach all that is known about 
Greece and the Greeks but to re-create to some extent the life 
of the Greeks. We wish the children to think as’ the Greeks 
thought, to feel as the Greeks felt, and to live as the Greeks 
lived. It may seem absurd to expect boys and girls in the year 
1923, in the city of Chicago, to experience the emotions of an 
Athenian living during the time of the Persian War; but, 
after all, are not the issues of the Persian war far more compre- 
hensible to a young child than those of the war through which 
we have just passed? In so far as the Greek civilization is 
simpler than ours, is it not more intelligible to a child? 
It is not nearness in time which makes an epoch actual to 
a child, but his capacity to experience it. It is not only the 
simplicity of the Greek civilization, but also its freshness which 
appeals to a child’s understanding. For in their vitality the 
Greeks have preserved their life in statues, bas relief, painting, 
and most beautifully in The Iliad and The Odyssey. ~ 
Judging by the children’s love of the work and by their 
growth of power in appreciation and expression, the study of 
the Greeks seems admirably suited to children of this age. How 
shall the child, grimy with soft coal and surrounded by sky- 
scrapers, picture those sunny hills, that blue “sea? We read 
about Greece, we look at pictures of Greece, those who have 
been to Greece testify, and somehow a picture of Greece comes 
into the children’s minds. They wish to preserve that picture, 
‘to draw it, and to write about it. This is one child’s description: 
“Greece is a peninsula. The sea is on three sides of it. There are 
many mountains and pretty little valleys. Through the valleys run little 
89
-P-A-G-E-90
90 Socrat ScrENCE SERIES 
streams. Beside the river are green olive groves and wheat fields and 
beautiful gardens, There are sheep on the mowntain’s side. There are 
many vineyards. There are many little islands in the sea.” 
By constant incidental reference, the children learn the 
principal points of the ancient geography of the Mediterranean - 
Sea and gain a general knowledge of the political geography of 
the modern world. . 
The children realize that they will wish to keep a book in- 
which they tell and picture all the most interesting things about 
the Greeks, so they plan the covers for it. On the covers they print - 
in no uncertain letters My Greek Book, and they decorate it. with 
a Greek border, or the picture of a Greek ship, or of a warrior, - 
It is obvious that 1f one lived in such a beautiful country 
one would .wonder about the. things which surrounded one. 
So we tell the stories which the Greeks created to explain 
how the earth was made, why the sea is sometimes rough and 
sometimes smooth, how spiders came to be, and about the cre- 
ation of the first grasshopper,-and the many, many other stories 
which it would be tedious to enumerate, but which it is thrill- 
ing to hear. While these stories are being told them, the chil- 
dren read Men of Old Greeée, from which they learn about the 
lives of Greeks who have actually lived. 
The children take great pleasure in reading aloud, and, the 
desire to read these stories and those in Four Old Grecks to the 
class furnishes a strong motive and stimulus to improve their 
reading, for they know that they must not read to others until 
they can give pleasure by so doing. 
In reading Men of Old Greece, they first learn about the life 
of the Spartan children from the story of Leonidas. The hard 
life of the Spartans, with every emphasis on training for war, forms 
an interesting contrast to’ their own lives. They try to imagine what 
it would be like if their fathers were soldiers and the boys were 
going to be soldiers, and the girls did not go to school with the boys, 
and they are not at all sure that they entirely approve of Spartan 
ways. They are, however, sure that Leonidas was a very brave 
man, whom they admire very much. One child says: 
“Thermopylae was a narrow pass; on one side were mountains and” 
on the other the sea. Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans, with a. 
. few thousand Greeks, met the large army of the Persians. Leonidas felt * 
that they could not win, but he said that if they did not win their brothers
-P-A-G-E-91
Tuer Course in History 91 
would fight the Persians. They held the pass two’days and the Persians 
could not down them; but at last a scout came to Leonidas and said, ‘A 
Greek traitor has told the Persians about a secret pass and they are 
coming up behind the Greeks.’ The Greek army was not half so big as 
the Persian, but they fought and made the Persians fly. But more 
Persians came and at last the Greeks could not drive them away and | they 
were beaten. Leonidas fought until he was killed.” 
In the stories about Themistocles and Socrates they learn 
about the Athenians. Here they are able to give unqualified ap- 
proval, and in fact, when reading of the Persian Wars they 
cease frem judging, and with the Athenians become, in turn, 
alarmed at the approach of the Persians, excited over uniting 
Greece to meet them, and proud at having defeated them. 
The Athenians were against the Persians. They had been fighting 
for. quite a long time. The Persians had many more men and many more 
ships and the Greeks did not have half so many. Then one day Them- 
istocles said to the Athenians, ‘Are ycu going to waste your money this 
way, or are you going to give it to us to build ships with?’ Then they all 
shouted and said, “We will give it to you to build ships with.’ -So Athens 
was a busy little town. There were mules and carts bringing the lumber 
to build ships. Nancy. 
Another child wrote about the battle of Salamis: 
“Now it was time for the battle to begin.- Soon the trumpet blew 
and the ships dashed together. The Persian ships were so erowded that 
they broke their own oars. The water was filled with men and ruins of 
boats. The Persians that could get away” “got away as quickly as they 
could. So King Xerxes went sadly home.” 
In he Four Old Grecks the children: make the acquairitance 
of the mythical characters, Herakles, Dionysos, Alkestis, though 
it must be confessed that they are as real to them as Themis- 
tocles or Phidias, and so were they to the Greeks. The merry. 
Dionysos, the brave Herakles, the gentle Alkestis are all fine 
folk with whom it is well to be acquainted. 
From the Odyssey more than from any other source a child 
is able to picture the Greek life, thought, and emotion. It is an 
invaluable experience for. him to read a poem which is so beau- 
tiful and so’ perfect. As he reads and loves the Odyssey he is 
acquiring a “touch stone for literature,” he is gaining a resource 
for his leisure hours, a life long joy. He understands the 
Odyssey because Homer’s spirit is akin to his, because for both 
of them the world is whole and new.
-P-A-G-E-92
92 Soctat ScreNcE SERIFS 
Here we have the ideal. hero-tale for the children of this 
grade. The theme, the wanderings of Odysseus in his attempt 
to reach home after the ten years’ Trojan war, is simple and © 
well within the sympathetic experience of children from. nine 
to ten years of age. The hero, the ever-ready, royal Odysseus, loyal 
to his friends, brave and daring; Odysseus, the crafty, the wise, 
is a hero after the children’s own hearts. Each adventure makes 
a well unified story, and the home-coming, where all ends well, sat- 
isfies the children’s sense of right and justice. The glow and life 
of Homeric language, the vivid and colorful images become a source 
of conscious delight each day as the story unfolds. 
To associate for months with heedful Penelope, white- 
- armed Nausicaa, with noble King Alcinous, with the kind and 
gentle swineherd Eumeaus, is indeed to be in good company. 
To see King Laertes plant his own fruit trees, Queen Arete 
spin and weave the lustrous cloth for the members of her 
family, to follow Nausicaa while she and her maidens wash their 
linen on the sunny beach, is to learn to place the right value on 
all manual work. And, lastly, to be in an atmosphere of beauty, 
emanating from the very chairs, golden cups, baskets of fruit, 
from high-roofed palaces and well built swine sties, is te be- 
come truly filled with a pure and lasting joy. ‘ 
Palmer’s translation of the Odyssey. may be a difficult book 
for the Fourth Grade, but when ‘one considers what is lost by 
using adaptations in form, style, language, and general crafts- 
manship, one feels that the stories adapted lack that art value for 
which the literature has been chosen. 
The study periods are never considered lessons in reading. 
The children who read fluently and beautifully read aloud; the 
teacher reads and sometimes tells parts of the story. Incidents 
- not suitable for our childrern are omitted. The children are 
encouraged to express their feelings about the events, the per- 
‘sons, the language, about anything to which they respond. 
Palmer’s Odyssey is, fortunately, not illustrated. The children are, 
therefore, free to make their own pictures and usually produce an 
original Odyssey Picture Book, 
Naturally the children compare their own daily experiences 
with those of the Greeks. They read of the training of Leonidas 
of Sparta and note the difference between his and their own 
training. They learn of Socrates’ first school days. Do they

wish themselves in his ‘place? They look at the houses of the _ 
‘Greeks, and their own comfortable sanitary homes please ‘them ~ 
by comparison. . - 
- The girls are on the whole glad that, they were not born 
when women and girls were confined to the home, could not 
appear in public, at the theatre, or in the market place. : 
"Throughout the Odyssey the children notice the Greek -feel- 
ing about the sea. Such phrases as “the fearful hollows of the. 
“barren sea,” “the interminable, terrible sea,” “the toilsome ocean 
ridges,” convince them that the Greeks dreaded the sea. We 
learn that this is due to the Greeks’ lack of knowledge of the 
sea, to their small, unsafe, open ships, to their ignorance: of 
methods of steering. The-sun and stars were their only guides. 
It is pleasant to contemplate. how differently we feel about 
the sea. It has been charted; the compass guides the trained 
sailors over the oceans. There are experienced pilots to steer 
the ship through dangers near the shore. Here. are friendly - 
lighthouses, buoys, signals of all kinds to help the man at the 
wheel to find his way to safe anchorage. 
We choose to study in detail how Chicago has safeguarded 
the ships that enter her harbor. A visit is made to the Masonic 
Temple for a bird’s eye view of the river, the inner and outer 
harbor, the lighthouses, life saving stations, and piers. A com-— 
parison is made between natural and made harbors; an ex- 
cursion to the life saving station and the lighthouse opens up 
the whole interesting subject which then may be studied from 
books and pictures. The joy and love of the modern man for 
the sea is emphasized by such. poems as The Sea, The Sea by Procter 
and A Wet Sheet and a Flowing Sea by Allan Cunningham. 
If the children only read about the Greeks they would 
form no vivid conception; but besides reading they see pictures 
of Greek men and women, Greek furniture and decorations, 
Greek ships and chariots. They study and apply Greek designs. 
They see models of houses and temples, and visit the Art In- 
stitute to see the statues there, besides having smaller statues 
about them in the grade room. After they have studied these 
things they model statues to show how they think the Greeks 
looked. When they model they feel that they are doing the 
very thing the Greeks did. They enjoy this. activity particu-. 
larly because they identify themselves with the Greeks as they 
“do it. :

MODELLING GREEK FIGURES IN CLAY 
Their work in clay is not confined to modeling, but also 
includes a study of pottery. They visit a modern pottery, see 
the potter at his wheel, learn about modern methods of pro- 
ducing-pottery and of firing and glazing. They make vases out 
of red clay, similar to that which the Greeks used and paint de- 
signs in black on the terra cotta vases just as the Greeks did. 
From their reading the children have a rich body of ma- 
terial to illustrate. They write the stories to put in their Greek 
book and paint pictures to illustrate them. These pictures are 
very free, with little emphasis on technique, for with young chil- 
dren a strong desire for expression brings its own technique. 
Incidentally while they are modeling and painting they study 
the human figure and try to make it in its proportions. 
Another experience which makes the child feel that he is 
doing just what the Greeks did, is the making of the costume. 
Each child, boy and girl alike, makes his own chiton, while 
some even make chlamyses to throw over their chitons. They 
not only make but dye their costumes and study Greek designs 
to put on them.’ The costumes are also worn in whatever 
Greek plays the children give, since the children dramatize and
-P-A-G-E-95

act those stories which are fitted for such treatment. They 
weave head bands and from these experiences as a point of de- 
“parture they make original designs to apply to table runners 
and. bags and experiment with further weaving. 
  
  
  PUPILS MAKING THEIR GREEK COSTUMES 
One of the reasons for making the Greek costumes is that 
the children will wear them to dance in on Field Day. . They 
have read about Greek games and dances, so Dalcroze Eury- 
thmics have here a logical and necessary place. The study of 
rhythm continues in exercises of free and controlled movement, 
marching or running according to the tempo and tone quality 
of the music, on command executing a leap, a step backward, 
a lunge, a skip, ete. 
Unusual rhythms of 5/8, 7/8 and 9/8 are studied in ball 
games, discus throwing, spear throwing, as well as polyrhythmic 
studies like “The Horses,” in which horses and drivers march 
in different note values, the horses always twice as fast as the 
drivers, except when they step triplets to the drivers’ eighths, 
Those activities, such as modeling, painting, sewing, danc- 
ing and acting, which make the children feel as if they were 
Greeks, have been emphasized.

  IN COSTUME FOR FIELD DAY 
Aside from the value of these activities to vivify Greek life 
they are intrinsically of value because they help a child to be- 
come articulate: Surely it is obvious that the greater and more - 
varied a person’s powers of expression, the greater is his op- 
‘portunity for happiness. It may be, as Mr. Robinson suggests,. 
that the absence of a dead language accounts for the greatness 
of the Greeks, since it gave them time to think. But it was 
their skill in expressing their thoughts which made them en- 
joy their leisure to the utmost; and we hope that by following 
in the footsteps of the Greeks the children may develop similar 
powers. : 
This play which the group composed after the study of the 
Odyssey shows that they had made not only the experience of 
Odysseus but also some of Homer’s telling language their own.

tending a great loom and loudly singing, some god or woman. The 
others lifted up their voices and called; and suddenly coming forth, she 
opened the shining doors and bade them in. The rest all followed 
heedless, but I remained, suspicious of a snare. They vanished, one and 
all, not-one appeared again, though Jong I sat and watched. 
ODYSSEUS—Then I shall enter the house to find my comrades. Come, 
Eurylochus, help me free them.

this potent herb and go to Circe’s house. This shall protect your life 
against the evil day. And I will tell you all the magic arts of Circe. 
She will prepare for you a potion and cast drugs into your food,” but 
even so she cannot charm you, because the potent herb which I shall

and springs on Circe.) Who are you? Of what people? Where is 
your town and kindred? I marvel much that drinking of these drugs, 
you were not charmed. None, no man else, who tasted them, ever 
withstood these drugs. Surely you are adventurous Odysseus. Then,

turned my comrades into swine within your halls, and here detain me 
with treacherous purpose?

CIRCE—By Zeus and all the other blessed gods, I swear I will not further 
try to harm you. (To her maids.) Go, bring water for Odysseus’ hands, 
and spread the polished table. Bring food and mix the sparkling wine 
that he may eat and drink and be refreshed. (Odysseus: sits, refusing 
food.) Why do you sit, Odysseus, thus like one struck dumb, gnawing 
your heart, and touch no food nor drink? Do you suspect some further 
guile? You have no cause for fear, for even now I swore to you a 
solemn oath. - : 
ODYSSEUS—Ah, Circe, what upright man could bring himself to taste of 
food and drink before he had released his friends and ‘seen them with 
his eyes? But if you in sincerity will _bid me eat and drink, then set 
them free, that I with my own eyes may see my trusty comrades, - 
. CIRCE—I shall do as you wish and free your comrades: (Leaves. Enter 
Circe with the men. Men clasp Odysseus’ knees, kiss his hands, and- 
weep.) High-born son of Laertes,. ready Odysseus, go now to your 
swift ship and to the shore, and first of all draw up your ships upon the 
land, and store within the caves your goods and all your gear, and then 
come back yourself and bring your trusty comrades and stay with me. 
Act III, Phaeacia

Place--On the river’s bank. . 
Persons—Nausicaa, her maids, Odysseus. :

Odysseus awakens and comes forth. - Maidens see him and flee, except 
Nausicad.) - . 
ODYSSEUS—Are you some god or mortal? If one of the gods who hold 
the open sky, to Artemis, daughter of mighty Zeus, in beauty, height and 
bearing I find you likest. But if you are a mortal living on the earth, 
_most happy are your father and your honored mother, most -happy your . 
brothers also. Once, something like you I saw, a. young palm- shoot 
springing up. On that I marveled long, since never before sprang such 
a stalk from earth. So, Lady, I admire and marvel, now at you and 
greatly fear to touch your knees. -Yesterday,- after twenty days I escaped 
from the wine-dark sea. Now some god cast me here, that probably 
here also I may meet with trouble. Princess, have compassion. Show 
me the town and give me a rag to throw around me if you have perhaps 
on coming here some wrapper for your linen. And may the gods grant 
all that in your thoughts you long for. 
NAUSICAA—Stranger, now you -have reached our city and our Jand, you 
shall not lack for clothes nor anything beside which it is fit a hard-pressed 
supplicant should have. JI am the daughter of generous Alcinous on 
whom the might and power of the Phaeacians rest. My women, stay! 
Why do you run because you saw a man? You surely do not think 
him evil-minded. But this poor man has come here, having lost his way, 
and we should give him aid. Then, give, my women, to the stranger- food 
and drink and bathe him in the river,—there is shelter from the breeze,

place robe and tunic for him, give him a golden flask and liquid oil and 
bid him bathe.) (To Odysseus.) Now, Stranger, hasten to the town 
that I may set you on the road to my wise father’s house. Easily it 
is known, a child though young could show the way. There wise Al- 
“cinous and my mother will welcome you.

(Bard telling of the fight over the body of Achilles. Odysscus 
weeps.) 
ALCINOUS-—-Harken, Phaeacian captains and councillors! New, have we 
satisfied desire for the impartial feast and for the lyre which is the 
fellow of the stately feast. Let us then come away and try all kinds of 
games, so that the stranger, going home, niay tell his friends how greatly 
we surpass all other men in boxing, wrestling, leaping and speed of foot. 
(Games and races.) 
ODYSSEUS—Games you should know, there is no greater glory for a man 
in all bis life than that which he wins with his own feet and hands. [ 
am amazed to see. | 
ALCINOUS-—And now, Stranger, tell me the name by which at home your 
father and your mother ‘calfed you, and declare me this and plainly tell 
me where you have wandered and what countries you have seen. And 
tell me why you weep and grieve within your breast on hearing the story 
of the Argive Danzens and of Nios? Had you some relatives at Iios? 
* .One who was dear? - 
ODYSSEUS--Mighty Alcinous, first I will tell my name, that you and all 
your men may know it and that I may be your guest-——friend, and that you 
may help me to reach my home, though far away. I am Odysseus, son 
of Laertes. My home is Ithaca, a rugged land and yet a kindly nurse. 
A sweeter place than my own land J shall not see. Nothing more sweet 
than home and parents can there be, however rich one’s dwelling, far in 
a foreign land, cut off from parents. 
ALCINOUS—Proud are we to have as guest, you, princely Odysseus. And 
you shail be aided home with no more wanderings, long as you have 
suffered. Tomorrow you shall tell us the tale of your many adventures. 
Hearken, Chieftains, let each man here give gifts, garments with rich- 
wrought gold, caldron, and large tripod. Then we will launch into the 
sacred sea a black ship, freshly fitted, and let two and fifty youths be 
chosen who have. proved to be the best. 
ODYSSEUS—Mighty Alcinous, renowned of all, pour a libation and send me 
safely forth. Fare you all well, may you be glad, you and your wives 
and children,

ODYSSEUS—Alas! To what man's land am I come now? Where are the 
Phaeacian captains? They promised they would carry me to far seen 
Ithaca, but that they did not do. Let me count my goods and see that 
the Phaeacians took none away upon their hollow ship. (Athena appears 
disguised as a shepherd.) Friend, tell me truly this that I may know 
full well. What land is this? What people? What sort of men dwell 
here? Is it a far seen island or a tongue of mainland that stretches 
out to sea? 
ATHENA_Y ou are simple, Stranger, or come from far away to ask about 
this land. It is not quite so nameless. Stranger, the name of Ithaca has 
gone as far as Troy, which is, they say, a long way from Achaea. 
ODYSSEUS—Oh, in lowland Crete, I heard of Ithaca, far off beyond the 
sea, and now I reach it. I and these goods of mine. There I slew 
Orislochus, son of Idomencus. After I had slain him with my brazen 
pointed spear I straightway sought a ship, asked aid of the proud Phaea- 
cians and bade them take me in their ship to Pylos, But stress of 
wind turned them aside. Missing our course, here we arrived last night. 
Then, weary as I was, sweet sleep came upon me, and the Phaeacians, 
taking my treasure from the hollow ship, laid it upon the sand where I 
was lying, and they embarked and sailed away to. stately Sidon. So I 
was left behind with aching heart. ‘(Athena smiles and pats him.) 
ATHENA—Prudent and wily must one be, to overreach you in craft of any 
kind. And yet you did not know me,.Palas Athena, daughter of Zeus, 
me, who am ever near to guard you in all toil. Now I am come to tell 
you what griefs you must endure, and I shall give you strength to slay 
the haughty suitors within your stately house. Come, then, and let me 
point out the parts of Ithaca, that so you may believe. Here is the dark- 
some cave, sacred to the nymphs, where oftentimes you made due sacri- 
fice. This is the wood-clad hill of Neriton. (Odysseus kisses the earth.) 
ODYSSEUS—Oh nymphs, daughters of Zeus, I give you greeting, gifts will 
I also give. (Pours libation.)

Place—In the palace. 
Persons—Penelope, Odysseus, the suitors, Telemachus, Eumaeus.

FIRST SUITOR-—This is gay life indeed, eating and drinking from the rich 
store of royal Odysseus. 
SECOND SUITOR—Yes, but one wearies even of feasting. Why does not 
fair Penelope choose one among us? 
THIRD SUITOR—Here we tarry year after year. Penelope ever putting us 
off with crafty plans: 
FOURTH SUITOR—Oh, foolish woman, Odysseus has long been lost either 
on the cruel sea or on some strange shore. (Odysseus, disguised as a 
beggar, and Eumacus have entered during this conversation. Odysseus 
seated by the door, the suitors see the beggar.) 
FIFTH SUITOR—Look at the wretched beggar. Surely he will tell Pene- 
lope idle tales.of her husband, thereby getting himself clothing and food.

Zeus, the friend of strangers, will punish you. 
PENELOPE—Hearken, you haughty suitors who beset this house. I offer 
you the mighty bow of Prince Odysseus and whoever with his hands 
shall bend the bow, him will I follow and forsake this home, a place I 
ever shall remember even in my dreams. (fo Ewmaeus) Deliver to 
the suitors the bow of your master. (Eumacus takes down the bow.) 
ANTILOCHUS—Rise up in order from left to right. 
SECOND SUITOR—(Tries to bend the bow}—No, friends, I cannot bend it. 
Let some other take the bow. _ 
EURYMACHUS—Ah, here is woe for me and woe for all. If in strength 
we fall so short of Princely Odysseus that we cannot bend his bow, oh, 
the disgrace for future times to know. 
ODYSSEUS—Hearken, you suitors of the illustrious queen, and let me tell 
what the heart within -me bids. Give me now the polished bow and let 
me in your presence ‘prove my skill and power and see if I have yet such 
vigor left as once there was within my. supple limbs, or whether wander- 
ings and neglect have ruined all. 
ANTILOCHUS—You: wretchéd stranger, are you not satisfied to eat and 
drink with us? I prophesy great harm to you, if you should bend the 
-bow. Do not presume to vie with younger men. 
PENELOPE—Antilochus, do you suppose’ the stranger, if he bends the great 
bow of Odysseus will lead me home and take me for his wife? » He in 
his inmost soul imagines no such thing. 
EURYLOCHUS—Heedful Penelope, we do not think the man will marry 
you. Of course that could not be, and yet we fear the talk of men and . 
women. ‘Princes of the Achaeans came to woo Penelope and could not 
bend the polished bow, but a wandering beggar comes and bends it’ _ ‘ 
PENELOPE—Eirymachus, the stranger will try to bend the bow for our 
pleasure only, and if Apollo grants his prayer I will clothe him in a coat ~ 
and tunic and.I will send him where his heart and soul may bid him go. 
TELEMACHUS (To Ewmaeus)—Carry on, th€ bow, Good Eumaeus, and 
give it to the stranger. (Eumaeus gives bow to Odysseus. Odysseus 
thrns the bow in his hand, observes it closely, tries the cord, bends the 
bow. Stuitors look frightencd. Sound of thunder is heard. Lets fly 
one shaft which kills Antilochus.) 
ODYSSEUS—Telemachus, the guest within your hall brings you no shame. 
I did not miss my mark, my strength is sound as ever. (Lets fall his 
rags.) . 
SUITORS—Odysseus! It is Odysseus. (Suitors flee. Odysseus, Telemachus 
and Eumacus pursue them.) . . 
. PENELOPE (alone)—It is Odysseus. (Odysseus and Telemachus return.

FIFTH GRADE 
EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY 
. 
Exploration and discovery, the theme of the fifth grade history, 
centers about that exploration of the middle ages which was prompted 
so largely by the need for a new route to the East. The heart of 
the work, apart from the historic link, is the human significance of 
exploration and discovery. The tenacity of purpose, the high 
courage, the thrill of adventure, and the romance of discovery which 
mark it are worth-while emotions to get, even at second hand, and 
the reality of it all is immensely keen to the’ adventure-loving .child 
of ten. He has no geographic conviction so firm that there is 
not still some suspense as to whether daGama could find a way 
around Africa, or Magellan a way through South America. To 
him, moreover, at the beginning of the year the Ptolemy map is 
about as satisfactory as the latest National Geographic publication ; 
and as this new world-knowledge dawns more and more clearly it 
parallels somewhat the medieval dawning of geographic knowledge. 
One of the things which adds charm and value to this work is 
the available first hand material which can be given to the children, 
and in reading excerpts from Marco Polo’s own book, bits from 
the journals of the explorers themselves and Toscanelli’s letter to 
Columbus, the inevitable stimulation of such original material is 
felt, and a right attitude toward authentic, sources is being’ devel- 
oped. 
The work divides itself rather distinctly into three phases, and 
as about a third of the year is given to each, the work is so outlined 
here. : 
Where to begin is a matter which has varied in teaching different 
groups, and depends largely upon where one chooses to put em- 
phasis. To begin with the Viking exploration and discovery opens 
the work with the charm of adventure and the tang of the sea. It 
presents, too, a primitive condition which illustrates well how 
discovery develops among a people. The chain of islands which 
tempted Norsemen further and further to sea, the accidental con- 
.tribution of storms to discovery, are so evident here that they are 
105
-P-A-G-E-106
106 Soctat ScIENCE SERIES 
significant to children in realizing the beginnings of exploration. 
Chronologically, too, this is a satisfactory starting point. Moreover, 
somewhere along the literary highway children need the old Norse 
myths and legends, which are delightfully adapted to this hardy, 
adventure-loving stage of childhood. Should the work begin here, 
_ this period would fill about one-third of the year. 
In Viking Tales by Jennie Hall, how Harold became king over- 
all Norway and the causes of emigration from Norway are splen- 
didly told; the stories of Leif and Ingolf, Eric the Red, and Leif 
Ericsson continue the steps of exploration and the settlement of 
Iceland, Greenland, and Labrador. Miss Hall also gives an excellent 
bibliography and ‘suggestions to teachers. The pamphlet, Norse 
Stories,* gives ample reading lists for the myths and legends. 
' The thrill of this period is very tempting, but for those of us 
who feel that whatever else be our pedagogic responsibility our. first 
obligation is to educate children to a right evaluation of peace, to 
cease to vaunt the false glories of war and the lust of battle, these — 
very thrills give us patise. Are we here, too, building upon false 
stimulation which has remained too long unquestioned? Is it wise 
tc emphasize more modern exploration with its more advanced. social 
- and scientific basis? Perhaps this is a decision which should control ° 
our emphasis rather than our starting point. . 
‘The work will then -either begin or continue with a survey of 
the Mediterranean countries, familiar through the children’s fourth © 
" grade interest in Greece and her colonies. We picture with much 
detail Venice as the center of eastern trade and Constantinople as 
the end of the caravan route. The journey of Marco Polo is fol- 
lowed, to awaken in the children some of the enthusiasm ‘which ~ 
- his writings roused in the Europeans of his own day. There is, 
fortunately, considerable first- hand material accessible in Noah 
Brooks’ Story of Marco Polo. Following this are given the obstacles 
in Western Asia which made a new trade route necessary. These 
phases establish the setting which is needed to make the later dis- 
coverers and their work meaningful. 
If the Norse work is omitted, about a third of the year is given . 
to this material. If used, it seems wise to condense this and include 
it with the medieval explorations which follow as the second third

of the year’s work. This movement westward in Europe is the very . 
heart of the work and must not be curtailed-so as to lose the detail 
and atmosphere which are essential to vivid imagery. 
The significance of the stupendous adventure of Magellan is 
built up through realizing the problems and difficulties encountered in 
lesser discoveries. The dream of Columbus, Balboa’s discovery of 
“the South Sea, Cortez’s effort to cross.Mexico, and Pizarro’s ex- 
plorations on the Isthmus and along the western South Americar 
coast to Peru, prepare for Magellan’s thrilling climax of ‘circum-~ 
navigation, o,

year’s work.

4. France in the new world— 
Newfoundland and the 
St. Lawrence region. 
. Champlain, Cartier, LaSalle, Joliet and Marquette. 
For the last part of the year, effort is made to throw over 
against this survey of medieval exploration with its superstition, 
self aggrandisement, and greed, the picture of modern exploration, 
emphasizing the spirit of exploration which marked the work of 
Livingston and Stanley in Africa, Peary and Nansen in the Arctic, 
and Scott and Amundson in the Antarctic. This phase rounds out 
the fifth grade child’s still vague geographic concept into a more 
complete world knowledge, but what is far more important, it 
substitutes efor the glory of war and the conviction that might is 
right those humanitarian and scientific ends and methods which color 
modern exploration. 
All this period, both medieval and modern, is rich in splendid 
literature to construct and intensify the realization of typical periods, 
men, and incidents. Besides the material in the way of diaries, letters, 
and records which have been made easily access:ble through references 
collected by Jennie Hall and listed in her Teacher’s Manual for Our 
Ancestors in Europe there exists the following bibliography:

  The geographic setting is so great in extent that the danger of 
superficiality is ever present, but on the other hand the history 
motivates vivid imaging of many geographic regions and of typical 
landscapes that establish a splendid basic world-conception on which 
to build later. The outline below will illustrate the point. 
Just to follow intelligently the location of the historic points,

from Messer Marco Polo by Byrne.* The Chinese wall, the location 
of Siberia, and the territory of the Mongols is worked over from’ 
fine material available in recent copies of the National Geographic ©

Venice is studied in minute detail to give vivid pictures, and 
here the description of Venice, also adapted from Messer Marco 
Polo,* is given the children. Italy is then studied as to topography, -

Spain and Portugal are taken up in enough detail for the chil-

After Columbus’ landing in Cuba the regions of the Gulf of 
Mexico, the West Indies, Mexico, Central America, Peru, and the 
Straits of Magellan, are the scenes of Spanish exploration, and as 
such pictured in considerable detail. 
The Panama Canal, the needed link during all of this period 
of exploration, becomes a very real issue at this time, and its con~- 
ception, construction, and present economic and political significance 
are intensely interesting. 
Because the west, east, and south parts of South America have 
a bearing on the history, and because geographically the children 
need the experience of working out one continent to learn how to 
read maps, to gather and organize material, and to cull a scenic unit 
from such material, we take South America to study in detail. This 
year the class began with a study of the physical maps. The moun- 
tains, plateaus, and lowlands were seen in the larger masses; the 
river systems were traced and discussed. This physical map study 
was translated into word pictures, and these in turn were corrected 
by actual pictures, slides, and stereoscopic views. The political © 
divisions were noted and listed. In class, one country was worked out 
as vividly as possible with the help and suggestion of the teacher, 
who furnished also all references and illustrative material. Then the 
children were divided into committees. Each committee studied and 
reported upon a country while the rest of the class, watching the 
map, took notes, questioned the committee, and formulated some 
sort of a report on what they got from the work of the committee. 
The children went to the Field Museum and to the Lincoln Park 
Conservatory to sketch typical South American products and vege- 
tation. 
At the end of the study of South America each child wrote 
questions for the rest of the class, upon the country in which he had 
been especially interested, and questions upon the continent as a 
whole. He chose such questions as he felt would illuminate the 
study. These were edited, each question being typed on a card, and 
they have furnished material for a “Geography Game” which has 
pleasantly reviewed and crystallized our study. 
Trips to the Field Museum, to the Lincoln Park Conservatory, 
to the Dunes, and to a tamarack swamp have helped to build up - 
pictures of some typical geographic areas. Sketches were made by

I have just taken Montezuma, their king, as a hostage, and hold him 
prisoner because we feared an attack from the natives. A messenger told 
Montezuma of the guns and horses which we own and of which these In- 
dians are much afraid. So to make friends they gave us many gold and 
silver articles. They have given me a plate of gold as large as a cart wheel. 
They have great temples covered with gold. I hope to capture the city and

MARCO. POLO 
In Venice there lived‘a man by the name of Niccolo Polo, and his brother 
Maffio Polo. In about the middle of the thirteenth century Niccolo and Maffio 
Polo set sail for the great Khan of China's kingdom, and the palace which 
was'in Pekin. |

On the way they stopped at Constantinople, where they sold their goods. 
Three years later they reached the great Khan's kingdom. The Kublai 
Khan invited them to visit him at his palace, which they did gladly. 
‘After fifteen years the Kublai Khan sent the Polos hack to Venice to 
get some Monks or Friars to teach the Chinese Christianity. 
When Niccolo and Maffio reached home they found out Niccolo’s . 
wife had died after he left for the Khan’s country, and-ghe had left a 
little baby boy, now fifteen years of age, whose name was Marco Polo.
-P-A-G-E-122
122 SocraL ScreNcE SERIES 
“Well, my good son, we are going back to the Kublai Khan with — 
two friars in a few days, and you may go along with your uncle Maffho 
and me,” said Niccolo one day to his son Marco, after he had told him 
of the great Khan. “Gladly I will go to ‘the Khan’s kingdom with you 
and my uncle,” said Marco. 
In a few days they set sail, and when they were half way there the 
friars left them and sailed for Venice. But they reached China safely, and 
when eighteen years later they: wanted to go home the Kublai Khan said, 
“T will behead you if you go!” 
At last one day the chance came, The Chinesé princess was to be married 
to a prince in Persia, and the Kublai Khan would trust no one with the princess 
but the Polos. So they set sail. ~ 
On their way they went, until finally they reached Persia. But 
when they got there the Prince was dead. 
So the father of the prince said, “I needa wife, so I'll marry the 
princess myself.” 
Now, as the princess was going to be married to the king, the 
three Polos left Persia and went straight on to Venice. 
‘When they reached Venice they went to their old home, and 
knocking on the door Niccolo said to the servant who opened it, “Let 
us in, for this is my house. I am Niccolo Polo who went to the great 
Kublai Khan’s kingdom a long time ago.”. The servant said, “No. No, 
you are not the master of this house! Here is the master. I will call 
him. Oh, Master! Master, there is a man at the door that wants to 
see you. He says he is the master of this house!” The master coming 
out of the house said to Niccolo, Maffio, and Marco Polo, “Are you crazy 
men to want to Claim my house and say you are the owners of. this 
house! Don’t you know a long time ago Niccolo and Maffio and Marco 
Polo were all killed! Two friars came back and told us, but you may 
rest for the night here and I will feed you in the morning.”

SIXTH GRADE 
AMERICAN HISTORY—WESTWARD EXPANSION 
AND IMMIGRATION 
The topics for the year’s study cover the territorial growth 
of the United States and the westward trend of its population. 
The acquisition of new lands is not particularly emphasized, 
chief stress being laid upon influences which brought about the 
peopling of newly acquired areas. Prominent among these in- 
fiuences are: (1) events in the life of our nation which set its 
people adrift and directed their movements westward; and, (2) 
world events which set foreign groups in motion and attracted 
them to our shores. . 
A study is made of the major groups of early immigrants, 
i. e., French, Irish, German, and Scandinavian, to learn what 
brought them to America during migration periods, how their 
coming affected the peopling of America, and why they became 
localized in certain areas of this country. The following topics 
- outline the general pian of the year’s work:

production—Westward shifting of business and of certa:r 
industries. : 
The subject matter here outlined forms a transitional body 
of material from the World Expansion idea of grade five to the 
European History of grade. seven. It continues the story of 
the westward trend of world population made familiar to the 
child in his study of early exploration and discovery in grade 
five. Its treatment of the causes of emigration of Old World 
peoples forms an introduction to the study of European History 
in grade seven. Moreover, the social character of history and 
of its related subjects makes an understanding of the composi- 
tion of American society-a desirable preparation for the work 
of the upper grades in civics and. history. 
The course was not originally planned as here outlined. 
It was first given as an outgrowth of the topic of Transporta- 
tion, which once formed the center of the year’s work. It 
‘was then merely a history of westward travel in America, ten- 
tatively planned for experimentation. The material was not in 
printed form, but was worked out with the use of reference 
books, special reports, etc. As the children’s interests were 
neted from year to year, many of the topics originally tried 
were omitted, some were greatly expanded, some were added.. 
At the close of each class discussion as many of the children’s 
questions as could be recalled were recorded. These records 
helped to shape the plan of work for the next year. Thus the 
cutline gradually assumed its present content, the teacher fill- 
ing in whatever topics were necessary to give to the whole the 
ferm of a continuous narrative. 
When the reactions of three successive grades upon the 
subject matter had shaped the plan into something like its 
present form, parts of the material were written by the teacher 
and prepared by the school in the form of mimeographed leaf- 
lets. The topics first put into such form were those on which 
authentic accounts could be found only in original sources. 
Little of the history in old journals, newspapers, diaries, etc.. 
is available to children, and the personal character of such ~ 
material gives it an organization difficult for their use as refer- 
ence matter. From such-sources printed lessons were prepared, 
quotations from the original being used wherever they added
-P-A-G-E-127
THe Course 1n History 127 
clearness and reality. From time to time more of the material 
was put into leaflet form, until at present there is some printed 
matter on each of the topics here outlined. 
As the work progressed the children accumulated the typed 
lessons in loose-leaf notebooks. The advantages of such a plan 
_ are many: , : 
1. No reading is done on a topic until some particular 
piece of information is needed. : 
2. The leaflets are made use of only after some otherwise 
unanswerable questions have arisen. The reading is, therefore, 
always purposeful. 
3. The child cannot use the textbook as a substitute for 
his own thinking. When a topic or problem comes up for class 
discussion it is first thought through with the aid of only 
such resources as are immediately available to children, previ- 
ous knowledge, past experience, maps, and pictures. Then the 
leaflets are used by the children for comparison, and for addi- 
tional “information. But the teacher has an additional purpose, 
to leave the whole in organized form in the child’s mind. 
The following stenographic report of a class discussion 
illustrates the thought given a problem or topic before the 
tmimeographed lessons are used: 
HISTORY DISCUSSION 
At a previous discussion on England’s acquisition of the 
. West the class was speculating as to what the English would 
do with their newly acquired lands. They were then told that 
the English made no attempt to use them, but continued to live 
cn the coast for ten years after they had driven out the French. 
Jane’s “That’s queer! They’d been wanting the lands for so 
‘long I should think they would have rushed right in,” brought 
up the following discussion, of which a stenographic report 
was taken. HISTORY LESSON 
Teacher. What question did’ we leave for discussion to-day? 
Victor, Jane’s. About why the English colonists did not | go into the 
wilderness as soon as the war was over. 
Teacher. Let us see if we can think out the reason, 
Edgar. They were still afraid of the Indians. 
Charlotte. All of the Indians had been on the French side, and if the 
English ventured into the wilderness the Indians would attack them. If they 
waited ten years the Indians would forget.
-P-A-G-E-128
128 SociaL Science SERIES 
Dorothy. 1 think the reason they did not go west was that the Indians 
were allicd to the French. The Indians did not come to the peace treaty, and 
therefore they had the right to fight on. The French made the peace treaty and 
could not fight ‘any more. 
Teacher. Yes, the Indians thought they could, go on fighting. 
Ann. 1 think that because they won so many victories in India and Europe 
and America, probably lots of people stayed over there and not so many came to 
America, . . 
Teacher. Does everybody see Ann’s point? 
Pegyy. 1 don't. 
Ann. After they had won so many victories all over the world, the English - 
people would not want to always come to America; they would go to France 
and to India. Not so many. people would come to America to explore the French 
territory. 
Teacher, Yes, Ann is right. We found yesterday that the English had 
extended their territory. They had gone to India and to Australia and to New 
Zealand, and the English people had some place else to go besides America. 
Were there any*other reasons why they clung to the coast in America? There 
must haye been, or they would have rushed away, as Jane suggested yesterday. 
Jane F. They had signed a peace treaty. They could not fight any more. 
Perhaps they wanted to finish their industries and make them larger, and may- 
be when they were all ready and had food and wagons made and things like 
that, they would go into the land they had just won. 
Maurice. They had been fighting so long they were nearly exhausted. 
They chad suffered so much during all those years, and at last they. had won, 
and they didn't want to move right away. 
Virginia. Yes, the English colonists were exhausted because they had been 
fighting so many years and were just at the last end of the war, and the Indians 
had not ccme into the treaty and they were not sure whether they would fight 
them or be at peace with them and they thought they would wait until they were 
better fitted to fight. 
“George. 1 should think that if they went out into the wilderness it would 
take them a long time to raise crops; it might take them some years. 
Teacher. Yes, they had the same reasons that we would have today for 
not wanting to live in the wilderness. What are some of them? 
Jane. It was usually damp there. We know that there were swamps in 
some places, and they could not live there because they would all be sick.. 
Teacher. Yes, that is right. The forests were so dense in ‘those days that 
the sun’s rays did not penetrate. When the trees were cut away the damp earth 
was exposed to the sun suddenly. That caused a good deal of illness, 
Alice. Lf they were in the wilderness, no food could get to them. There 
would be no way of getting it until they could clear the ground and raise crops. 
Marian. And if the Indians attacked them they would not get help. 
Teacher. J have in mind another reason. How did the English king 
feel about this? 
Charlotte. The English king was afraid if they got so far away he could 
not handle them.
-P-A-G-E-129
Tur Course in History 129 
' Frank. He wanted them to buy all their food from England and send 
everything they raised there. And if they went-into the wilderness they might 
choose another governor and he would not be their ruler. 
Maurice. 1 think another reason is that the English king at that time 
was. much against Catholics; he wanted people only to worship in the English 
church, and that is why so many people left England and came over here. 
The English king was rather imperative about religion. He was afraid they 
would go out there and worship as they pleased, and that he would not beable 
to control them so far away. 
Teacher. Have we had any evidence before this that he did not want his 
people to go west? 
Children. Yes. 
Frank, He didn't send his armies over at first because he wasn’t sure 
he wanted the West. 
Victor. Don’t you think that one reason the colonists didn’t go west was 
because they could not raise crops at first and they would have. to live on game, 
and the game soon went away? 
Teacher. Yes, there was always fear that the new region might not sup- 
port them,- And there is something else.. You know your parents would not 
want to move to a place where there were no schools for you to attend. Many 
people thought that they must stay near the, settlements where there were schools 
for their children, But the colonists would have gone west anyway if there had 
not been other reasons. Turn to page 8 of your geographies, and see if there 
is anything along the eastern coast that would make people want to live there. 
_ John. Ships could reach there, and if they were in the wilderness the 
ships from England could not reach them, 
Teacher. Tf you had lived here (pointing to England and America on wall 
map), could you think of any reason why you would prefer to live here on the 
Atlantic coast rather than out here in the wilderness? 
Narcissa, They were so much nearer to the mother country, that if any- 
thing should happen that they would get into war with France or any other 
European country, they could get to-them quickly. Ii they were on, the other 
side of the mouutains they would be cut off from home, 
Mariana. Also the colonists were. thinking of Spain then too. Spain 
owned, west of the Mississippi River. And if the Spanish got up enough force 
they could come across the Mississippi and fight the English colonists and the 
mother country could not get at them. 
Teacher. How many times had England defeated Spain up to this time? 
Viryinia. Twice. Once at the time of the Spanish Armada and this time 
when she came in to help France. So I don’t believe the English colonists were 
thinking about Spain. 
Jane R: The English were good on the sea, and they controlled the 
coast. In case any other nation came to this country, they would have to come 
to the coast or up the St. Lawrence. Then the English could keep them out, 
George. And they also had the best fishing grounds here around the 
mouth of the St. Lawrence and about Boston, and they wanted to stay near 
them.

“Teacher, What else did these people depend upon besides fishing? There 
must have been something very worth while to hold the people there for such 
a long time. Doesn’t your map suggest anything else to you? Here are rivers 
flowing down to the Atlantic. Do you see that long line? (The fall. line.) 
- What does it suggest? 
Edgar. All the rivers have water falls. 
Teacher. Of what use are they? _ 
Peter. Shey furnish water power for mills. 
Teacher. What other use is there for rivers flowing from mountains down 
to the ocean? 
Amy. They could cut down trees and put the logs in the river and float 
them down. 
Teacher. (Sketching diagram.) They cut the trees here and float them 
until they come to the falls in the river. Then what happens? 
Amy. Oh, I see, they have the mills here and cut them up into lumber, 
and then the lumber could float down the river to the coast. 
Teacher. What would it be used for there? 
Children. Houses, ships. . 
Peter. They needed ships as much as tiiey needed houses. 
Teacher. If you look up here where the coastal plain is very narrow you 
will see that many of the rivers flowing from the upland to the plain have these 
falls. That made ship building an easy industry to begin. Now look at the 
map on page 13 (a product map) and see if it suggests anything else to you. 
Virginia.. They had so many different things that they could ship to 
Europe from there that they liked to live on the coast. (Reading) “Iron and 
steel and cotton and grains and leather goods.” . 
Edgar. Iron and steel, they did not have in the early days, did they? 
Peggy. Didn't they have iron in the very earliest days? We learned last 
year that there was some iron in the coastal plain. 
Teacher. There was iron along the coast, but it was not a very good 
quality. Select from the names on your map just the products which the 
colonists must have had. . 
Claldren. Fish, lumber, hides, wool. 
-llice. There must have been furs too. 
’ Teacher. Yes. You see they had many things to depend upon at home 
and they did not wish to risk a new and uncertain part of the country. 
Edgar. There aré many good harbors on this map too, so they could send 
things away easily. 
Teacher. I think we have answered the question as well as we can from 
the information we now have. These typed sheets contains some additional 
reasons why the English loved the coast. As you read you may number in the 
margin all of the reasons that we did not think of in class today. 
It was soon found that the amount of detail possible in the 
plan, ice, the expansive treatment of a special field, stimulates 
children to do much. related reading. Thus there came a need 
for something more than the printed lesson sheets. The reading
-P-A-G-E-131

shelves in the grade room now contain many books dealing with 
a wide range of related material. These books were supplied by 
the school library and by the mothers of grade children, one book 
of the teacher's choice having been presented to the grade by each 
mother. Two periods per week are devoted to free silent reading, 
and the children are privileged to use the books at any free mo- 
ment during the school day, or to withdraw them for evening use. 
In this way the children acquire a fund of information that can 
be drawn upon to solve class problems, to suppleinent class 
. discussions, and to assist in the carrying forward of special 
enterprises. Pupils who prepared the Morning Exercise that 
appears later on had such help as “Jack can find a picture of 
Boonesborough in Thwaite’s Daniel Boone” ; “Ralph can find a good 
description of the Wilderness Road in Dunbar’s History of Travel.”

_ themselves, and they planned the removable rear wall and the 
furniture.

  AN OHIO RIVER FLAT BOAT—A PROJECT OF TYPE IL 
MY LIFE AS A HUNTER 
The first eleven years of my life I spent with my father, mother, 
brother and sister. We lived in a small log cabin in which I was born. 
It was situated in the wilderness between the Illinois and the Wabash 
Rivers. My brother and sister were born in France and were constantly 
talking about dear old France and their gay. life there. They teased me 
because I had not enjoyed the gay and easy life, but father said that I 
was a lucky boy to be born in America, and that the reason that I was 
as strong as Louis, who was sixteen, was because of the out-door life 
T had fed. , . 
Mother had a small garden in back of our cabin in which she raised 
her. crops. Father was a backwoodsman who used to bring home many 
pelts such as beaver, otter, fox, mink, wolf, bear, and rabbit. He also had 
buck-skin out of which he made leggings and jackets for us. 
After I was eleven years of age, I lived the life of my father, 
hunting, trapping and trading. I soon became perfectly independent and 
wandered about the forests at will. That was ten years ago. Many 
changes have come into our lives since then. My brother has joined 
the army at Kaskaskia, my sister has married a young Captain at Quebec, 
but I am still a hunter, The game is very plentiful and my canoes are 
laden with furs and skins which, with the help of Fighting Bear, who is 
-a young Indian, I occasionally take to Fort Kaskaskia to sell. Once when 
I came in full view of the fort, I found the cannon up, and all around 
and inside the fort were men with guns. That of course meant war, but
-P-A-G-E-136
136 SocraL Scimnce SERIES 
-l was very much astonished for I had heard nothing of the trouble. with 
thé [English colonists. I expected to be drafted, but to my surprise I 
heard that most of- the soldiers would be sent from France and the 
backwoodsmen could go on hunting. 
After a short time, I again returned to Kaskaskia, and when I 
arrived I found the men very light hearted, for General Braddock, with 
one thousand British soldiers, had ,been defeated. “Tf. France can, do 
that,” they said, “she can surely win the war.’ 
A report of fresh hunting grounds now took me away to the. ‘far 
Northwest, so it was many months before I saw Kaskaskia again. At 
the end of the season, with my canoes laden with furs and dried meats, 
I floated down toward Kaskaskia. It was hard work to guide the 
canoes, for there were five of them, all laden with the success of my hunt. 
What was my dismay when my first glimpse of the old fort showed the 
British flag. I looked anxiously about the fort for a friendly face and 
when I was just about to give up, I saw the familiar face and buckskin 
clad figure of my friend, Francois La Cour. We wandered about till we 
found a shady spot, and there he explained to me what had occurred during 
my long absence. The English had captured our two best forts, Montreal 
and Québec, and had won the war. He spoke. of ‘the insolence of the 
British soldiers who’ were now stationed at the fort, and of the great 
fur trade that was now going to England instead of France. ‘That made 
me wonder that if every time I brought in furs I would encounter the 
insolent English soldiers. I knew that the only way to avoid this was 
either to go to France, or to lose myself in the wilderness where I would 
not have to see the hated British. The thought of leaving my pleasant 
and exciting life, I could not bear, so I finally got all the things that I- 
needed, and started to go far into the western wilderness, where I hope 
to spend the rest of my life.

social effort. : 
Not every child in the grade took part in the exercise, but all 
helped plan it, and each contributed an illustration for use in making 
the story interesting to others. The pictures, here greatly reduced, 
were about 24” x 30”, large enough to be seen from any part of the 
school auditorium.

DANIEL BOONE AND THE WILDERNESS ROAD 
In early colonial days all of the land in North America — that. is, 
most of it — was owned by two nations, England and France. England 
claimed, or rather had settled, only the narrow strip along the coast east 
‘of the Alleghanies, while France had all of the region drained by the 
Great Lakes and the Mississippi River.
-P-A-G-E-138
138 SociaL Scrence SERIES 
As more people came to'the English settlements, they began to need 
more land, and at last, after a great war, the French were driven out of 
the interior. But not all of the British generals who fought against the © 
French were victorious. One of the unsuccessful ones was General 
Braddock, who led an army against the French fort where Pittsburgh ~ 
now stands. . 
The southern colonies did not take much part in the war, because the 
French and Indians were so far fram their borders, but North Carolina 
sent two hundred volunteers to join General Braddock's army. They went 
by forced marches all the way to Cumberland on the Potomac River, 
where Braddock was preparing for his expedition. When one of these 
men enlisted, he was asked what he could do. He said that he could 
hunt, farm, trap; that he knew a little of Indian ways; and that he 
had some experience as a blacksmith. Braddock, who was taking a 
wagon train into the wilderness, was glad to put him to work as a 
blacksmith, but if he had known who this man was, he probably would 
have placed him at the head of the army. He was Daniel Boone, the 
famous scout and backwoodsman. . 
But it was not so bad for Boone, after all, that he was kept at the 
rear repairing wagons, for here he met John Finley, a hunter and trapper 
who had been to Kentucky. Finley told Boone all about that region, 
and also told him the best route to reach there. This picture shows 
Boone atid Finley walking behind Braddock’s men. (He pointed out a 
man in a red uniform) This is a British soldier. 
- Edwin R. 
At the close of the French and Indian wars, Daniel Boone went back 
to his home on the Yadkin River, in North Carolina. Here he was mar- 
ried, and his little son James was born. They lived in a very primitive 
cabin made of logs. . 
Daniel Boone had. four occupations. The first one, and the one he 
liked most of all, was hunting. The second was farming, the third was 
being a blacksmith, He could work -as a blacksmith better than his 
neighbors, and they brought their work to him and he did it. His fourth 
occupation was this: Every year a big wagon train went down to the 
coast cities and came back with such implements and supplies as could 
not be had in the wilderness. Daniel Boone always went with this. 
He used to take his little son James with him on his hunts and 
exploring trips, partly for companionship, but mostly for his son's 
education. One time, although they did not know it, they penetrated to 
the eastern part of Kentucky. There a blizzard stopped them, and they 
had. to return. This is a picture of Daniel Boone coming home after he 
had been on a hunt. Here is his little son, playing with the dog. 
The utensils of the house were very crude and primitive. There was 
a large kettle for cooking, and nearly all the dishes were of wood. Boone 
always used his hunting knife, and he despised the ‘crockeryware which 
was just then making its way into the valley, as he thought it was
-P-A-G-E-139
Tue Course 1N History 139 
designed for the sole purpose of dulling a knife. At the further end of 
the cabin was a big fireplace, into whith went logs from five to six feet 
long. This is a spoon (holding it up) that was given to Mary Ann Kerr 
by her father as a wedding gift. She was a niece of Daniel Boone, and 
he was then in the family; he must have used it. It came all the way 
from England. It is engraved, and it has the stamp of the firm that 
made it on the back. .

THE BOONE CABIN ON THE YADKIN FINLEY APPEARS AT THE BOONE HOME 
As the years went by, Daniel Boone thought less and less of the 
beautiful land Finley had told him about. He might never have gone 
there if he had remained contented in his home on the Yadkin, but several 
things were happening that made him become dissatisfied. Mamy strange © 
people were coming into the Yadkin Valley. As they came, they pushed 
the game further and further back into the forest. When the hunters 
went out, they were sometimes gone two weeks, and they would not 
have any game to bring home, while in the other days they could kill 
twenty or thirty deer in one day. Free land, too, was becoming very 
scarce. When the settlers first came, they could clear the land and 
plant crops, and the land was theirs. But now they had to go to the 
farmer who owned the land, and buy as much as they needed from him, 
as every acre had been taken up. When Boone was a little boy, he had 
to take the cattle five miles away from home, and his mother would go 
with him. When he grew to be a man, he had to take the cattle sixty
-P-A-G-E-140
140 SociaL ScrENCE SERIES 
or seventy miles away from home, because there was no free pasture 
near the settlement. All these things made Daniel Boone dissatisfied, 
and he wanted to go’to the beautiful land beyond the mountains. This is 
a picture of Daniel Boone taking the sheep to the mountains for pasture. 
Ruth N. ‘ 
One day, as Boone was working in his garden (for he could seldom 
hunt now, for the game had-been driven back into the interior), he looked 
up from his work and saw a peddler’s wagon drive up to his door. He 
went to see who it was, and was surprised to see his friend John Finley, 
whom he first met in Braddock’s army and whom he had not seen for 
eleven years. Finley was Boone’s guest all winter, and Daniel aid his 
son, were eager listeners to his stories of the land beyond the mountains. 
This inspiréd Boone to go into Kentucky, so when spring came Finley 
and Boone, and Boone’s brother-in-law, John Stewart. got ready to go on 
a hunting’ trip. They took with them. three wood-cutters and camp- 
makers. Each wore a deerskin suit, with a belt which contained a hunting 
knife, ‘a’ powder horn, a pouch of bullets, and a wallet of parched corn. 
They. carried long rifles. They expected to stay in the wilderness many - 
months, as they wanted to hunt throughout the season. This picture 
shows Finley driving up to Boone’s door. 
. John G. 
After careful planning, Boone and Finley decided to go into Ken- 
tucky by way of Cumberland Gap. They chose this route for two reasons: 
Finley had gone into the region once before and knew of the pass here, 
and Boone had found it on one of his hunting trips. Here is Cumberland 
Gap (pointing to the map). 
Both Boone and Finley knew that this region was practically un- 
inhabited by Indians. Finley had found that out during his previous trips, 
and Bcone suspected it from the knowledge he had gained while hunting. 
This was the best hunting ground east of the Mississippi River. The 
Iroquois and other tribes north of the Ohio, hunted there, and so did 
the southern tribes, but no tribes were strong enough to keep it from 
the others. Whenever the tribes met here, terrible battles were fought, 
and for that reason it finally became known as the “Dark and Bloody 
Ground.” It was also Called “No Man's Land,” because it was not owned 
or occupied by any Indian tribe. 
Gordon B. 
Boone and his companions pushed on over Indian paths and buffalo: 
trails until they reached a branch of the Kentucky River. Here they 
made a camp which they called Station Camp, where they expected to 
store their skins and furs. 
They usually went out hunting in pairs, partly for companionship 
but mostly for safety. Boone and Stewart usually hunted together. One 
day they got separated from edch other, and Boone went into camp to 
wait for his friend. But Stewart never came back. His disappearance 
so disturbed the others that they wanted to give up the hunt and return — 
to the settlement. As the returning party was on the way home, they
-P-A-G-E-141
Tue Course 1n History 141 
met Boone’s brother Squire. He was going out to join the party, with 
ammunition and supplies. So Boone and his brother stayed in the wilder- 
ness and hunted all that winter. When. spring came, their aimmunition 
gave out and Squire returned to the settlement to get supplies, and to 
pay their debts. So Boone was left alone in the wilderness for three 
months. He hardly ever cooked anything, for fear the Indians would find 
him by the smoke of his camp fire. He had many narrow escapes. Once 
while walking along the river, Boone saw an Indian calmly fishing. 
~Boone crept up behind the Indian and shot him. The Indian fell down 
into the water. This was lucky for Boone, because if he had escaped 
he would have told the other Indians. 
In July Squire came back again with horses and supplies. They 
‘hunted all that winter and spring, and when they returned home it had 
been two years since Boone left the Yadkin Valley. They had been away 
so long that people had given them up for dead, but Boone and his brother 
ow knew more about the interior than any men living. John G. 
When Boone got home, he found that many of the people were 
dissatisfied along the coast, because they were so greatly in need of land. 
There were two reasons for this; one was that foreigners were coming 
in great numbers. These were the Huguenots from France, the Scotch- 
Irish from Ireland, and Germans from the Rhine lands. The Scotch- 
Irish settled in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. They had to push 
far back into the mountain valleys, because there was no land-to be had 
along the coastal plain. The Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania’ moved 
southward in the mountain valleys, and those in North Carolina pushed 
northward until there was a long line of them between the red men in 
the interior and the settlements on the coast. Virginia needed land more 
than any of the other colonies. One reason for this was that in Virginia 
. tobacco was the chief crop, and it- required very large areas. One year 
they planted crops in one place and the next year the soil there was poor, * 
and so they would plant it in another place, leaving the first laid vacant. 
This caused much vacant land, and the people found it very hard to do 
anything. Boone found the people very much discouraged, and he tried 
to get them to go beyond the mountains. Steewart W. 
After Boone returned bome from his long hunt, he persuaded five 
families to go into the wilderness with him. They made preparations all 
winter and spring, selling their farms and their goods and keeping only, 
what they needed for their trip. Boone. planned their line of march very 
caréfully, so that the Indians could not attack and get the best of them. 
He placed guards all around, so that they could see the Indians if they 
approached. The cattle and pigs traveled slowly, as the surface of the 
ground was very rough, so the front of the procession took a shorter time 
than the rear.” One evening the front went into camp and was waiting 
- for the rear to come up. They did not come, and ‘they did not come. 
They waited all that night. Toward morning a nian from the rear guard 
‘rushed up with the news that ‘the Indians had attacked the party and
-P-A-G-E-142
142 SocraL Scrince SERIES 
killed five men, among them Boone's son James. ‘This discouraged the 
farmers, so'they gave up their plans and started back to the settlement. 
Boone was still determined to make one more attempt to reach Kentucky. 
He accompanied them forty miles on the way home. There he left them 
and followed the Clinch River into Virginia, where he occupied a deserted 
cabin which he had seen on the way out. He stayed in this cabin two 
years, and then made his second attempt to go into the wilderness. 
. Charles A. 
In 1775 Daniel. Boone resumed his journey into the wilderness, — 
this time at the head of a band of picked men who had been chosen to 
cut the road into Kentucky. He was hired to do this by Richard Hen- 
derson, who had bought a large tract of land in Kentucky from the 
Indians and wanted to make a settlement there. Boone took his old 
route through Cumberland Gap. After he had passed that, he came 
to the most difficult part of his trip. First there were twenty miles of 
dead forest, and after that thirty miles of cane brake. They had to chop 
every inch of their way through these fifty miles. Then they came upon 
“ Warrior’s Path, which they followed northward until they came to a 
buffalo trace. They followed this west for a short distance, and then, 
north again until they came to the Kentucky River. Here they built a 
fort. This path, which Boone had cut into Kentucky, was for many years 
the main highway into the interior. This is a picture of Boone and his 
axemen cutting the road. Ralph S. i t 
Daniel Boone chose this site for a settlement because the ground 
was very fertile. The river was on one side and on the other was-a 
lick, where wild animals came. Here is a birdseye view of Booriesborough,

story of the blockhouse projected over the lower, so that Indians could 
be fired upon.if they came too close to the stockade. There were about 
thirty cabins, and the sides of the stockade were made by the backs of 
the cabins. 
Henderson had a store inside the stockade, where the men received 
their pay in gun powder and supplies. A man, if he was not satisfied with 
the fortress, could have two acres of ground just outsde, and if this did 
not suit him, he could have any number of acres a short distance away. 
Most of the cabins had just one room, unless the settler was more pros- 
perous, and then there were two. When the Indians were located any- 
where about, a messenger was sent out to warn the people in the cabins. 
lf it was at night, he would tap softly on the windows. The children 
were in constant fear of Indians, and were always as still as death when 
they knew they were near. Care was always taken not to awaken the 
youngest child for fear it would cry and the Indians would know where 
they were. They would all hurry to the Fort, and the next day the men 
of the family would ‘go back to the cabin and bring their goods. The 
families did not usually occupy the fort except when in danger from 
Indians. They preferred to stay in the wilderness, where they could clear ~ 
their ground and tend their flocks. Jack. C

During the Revolution, the Indians tried to destroy as many of the 
border. towns as they could. They either set fire to the stockades or 
tried to starve out the settlers by driving away the game. Once during 
the Revolution, Boone ran out of both gunpowder and salt. Without gun- 
powder, he was unable to shoot any game, and without salt, he could not 
preserve it. So on the first of January, he set out with a company of men 
to go to lower Blue Lick to make salt. For about a month all went well. 
Some of the men drew water from the springs and evaporated it to get 
the salt, while others went out for game. One day as Boone was re- 
turning to the camp in a blinding snow storm, four Shawnees suddenly 
confronted him. He dropped his horse’s reins and tried to escape, but 
was captured and taken to Detroit. He was held captive there by Black 
-Fish, Chief of the Shawnees. When spring came, the Indians began to 
prepare for a trip to Ohio to hunt and to get salt. Boone was taken with 
them, but when they reached a place neat where the city of Chillicothe 
now is, Boone found out that they intended to cross the Ohio river and 
attack the Kentucky towns. He made his escape, and ran practically all 
the 169 miles back to Boonesborough. Then the people in the garrison there 
prepared for an attack. They were just in time, for soon the Indians 
arrived. There were about four hundred of them. The siege lasted ten

days. Then the Indians pretended to give up and go away. That night 
the men in the garrison heard sounds made by shovels, and they knew 
that the Indians were digging a tunnel under the fort. "But pne night a 
heavy rain came, and the tunnel caved in, and the Indians had to abandon

that plan. In a short time another attack was made. This time the 
Indians sent a few warriors to the fort, while the rest of them hid in the 
woods. They hoped Boone and his friends would be enticed out of the 
fort to pursue the warriors. Boone did just as they wished, and came 
running out. He was shot in the leg, and the leg was broken. An 
Indian was just about to kill him when Simon Kenton rushed out of the 
fort, shot the Indian through the heart, and carried Boone inside the 
stockade. Soon after that reinforcements came to Boonesborough and the 
Indians were driven away. ‘This pieture shows the attack on Boone at 
the Fort. This picture shows the men making salt. _ Howard L. 
After the Revolution, the Treaty of Peace was signed in Paris, but 
news of the’ signing did not reach the coast settlements until two months 
after that, for ships did not travel so fast in those days as they do now. 
It was one month after that before the news drifted into the Kentucky 
settlements. In those days they did not have railroads; they did not 
even have good roads, so news traveled very slowly. One spring day, 
after’ the snow was all melted, a messenger came riding into camp with 
the word “Peace” written on a band on his hat. The people in the stock- 
ade all came together, and big bonfires were built. These bonfires 
celebrated two things—that peace had come again and that there was no 
longer any barrier between the East and the West. Now that, the war 
was over, and Boone was no longer needed at the Fort, he went back to 
his former home to find his wife and child. They had returned to the 
Yadkin River when Boone was taken prisoner to Detroit because they 
had given him up for dead. This is a picture of the messenger bringing 
the news of peace. This is a.man calling the people together, and here is 
a bonfire. Harry B. 
This is another picture of the bonfire made to celebrate the coming 
of peace. After Boone got back to the Yadkin River where his family 
was, he found that there were a great many Virginians who wanted to 
go into the Interior behind the mountains, so Daniel Boone led these 
people over his wilderness road into Kentucky. Among these families was 
the great grandfather of Lincoln, and that is how this famous family.came 
into Kentucky.. After the war had ended, Boone began to grow dissatis- 
fied again, because Kentucky was getting too crowded, so he decided: to 
move west once more. This time he took his family in a boat, and they 
~ went down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and from there to the mouth 
of the Missouri. He lived there until his death, in 1820. So once more

of subject matter. The academic work is not without classification, 
chiefly because of the necessity of having special teachers at stated 
.times. But effort on the part of all teachers handling a group to 
concentrate their work about the central subject, history, tends to’ 
destroy lines of classification and’ to unify the child’s experiences. 
GEOGRAPHY 
Part of the work in geography is an unstressed, purely inci- 
_ dental accompaniment of the history, But. since the child must know 
more of present-day conditions than could be learned through a study 
of geographic influences in history, a fuller treatment of the subject 
matter of geography is given. As many of the topics taken up for 
such special study are approached. through history, the essentials 
of the two subjects are not dissociated in the child’s mind. 
A complete outline of the course in geography need not be given 
here, but its historical connections may be noted. The world-knowl- 
edge acquired in grade five is here used for a new purpose. Com- 
parison is made of the shorelines and hinterlands of the Atlantic and 
the Pacific to show why world population moves westward: the 
Pacific with few rivers, rapid currents, mountainous coasts, a small 
amount of land open to the sea; the Atlantic with its many long 
“ rivers, great plains, ready accessibility, etc. Then the topographic 
divisions of the United States are taken up in the order in which 
population filtered into them. This historical approach unifies the 
subjects, especially as the chief emphasis is placed upon natural con- 
ditions which either promoted rapid and. prosperous settlements or 
acted as hindrances to civilization. Natural lines of communication 
and natural resources are taken up as their presence influenced the 
movement of peoples. 
_ The expanding of these topics into present-day conditions makes 
an association.in the child’s mind between geography and history, 
causing him at the same time to recognize their bearing upon human 
life and action. 
ART 
Besides aiding in the consummation of individual and group. 
projects the art teacher directs the work of illustrating the loose-leaf 
history notebooks, and decorating covers for them. She accompanies 
the class on excursions to the Field Museum, the Lincoln Park Zoo, 
and the Academy of. Sciences, to observe beaver, buffalo, - wild

turkeys, Virginia deer, and other animals of use to pioneer Amer- 
icans.. The information acquired on these trips finds expression in 
art, in composition, and in modeling, 
This putting of ideas into tangible’ form clarifies and intensifies 
them. Children are willing to search books and pictures for the in- 
formation necessary to make their illustrations accurate in detail and 
to lend them the proper atmosphere. , But the information thus 
acquired is less useful for further creative purposes than is the 
emotion aroused when a child paints an historical incident. To illus- 
trate: a child can with more or less effort retain in memory the fact 
that Washington and Gist, bearing Governor Dinwiddie’s message, 
arrived at the hut of French officers at Venango about dusk of 
December fourth. But once he has painted the wintry sky, the 
snowy woods, the log hut in the clearing, and the approaching back- 
woodsmen, he has an emotional reaction toward that situation that 
makes it unforgettable. The chief value, however, of such a piece of 
work lies in its stimulation of the creative impulse, for that. seeks 
satisfaction in further production, 
ENGLISH 
The examples of oral and written composition previously given 
indicate the correlation of that subject with the history. There re- 
mains to be pointed out the additional value of history in vocabulary 
building, Since the reading vocabulary of a sixth grade child far 
exceeds that which he controls for purposes of speaking and writing, 
a conscious effort is made to enlarge his active vocabulary and to 
enable him to give his meanings exact expression. 
Each child keeps an individual list containing the words he has 
misspelled, but he also keeps a class list made up of words: quite 
beyond the usual range of the sixth grade child but for which he now 
has immediate use. This latter list is compiled after certain informa- 
tion has been acquired through readings and class discussions and the 
entire class is ready to assemble that information in written form, 
The teacher suggests a number of words that will make possible 
an adequate expression of the thought to be written. Dictionaries 
are called upon to reveal the meanings of those immediately needed 
words, and their application to the newly acquired subject matter is 
discussed. Use of the new words is not an absolute requirement, 
but children soon become aware of the ease given to written com-

position by the use of proper terms and feel pride in the growing 
power to express themselves effectively, 
- It occasionally happens that a child with a very limited vocab- 
lary makes no use of the new words. He is then asked to write 
at the end of his completed composition sentences that will show 
that he has learned the meanings and use of those terms. It has 
been found that such practice soon carries over into the composition 
and helps the hampered child to a greater freedom of expression. 
Here are sentences chosen at random from a set of papers after the 
children had collected information and put it into written form, The

was attempted. :

LITERATURE 
Apart from Cooper’s Last of the Mohicans and Deerslayer, 
which are on thé grade reading shelf, there is not much literature 
about the pioneer period in America that is especially suited to sixth 
grade children, There do exist, however, a few poems whose spirit 
is in keeping with those times and whose study elevates knowledge 
getting into the realm of the emotional and imaginative. Gould’s

imagination, with such results as appear in the children’s poems 
previously cited.

. SEVENTH GRADE 
_THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEA POWER 
_ The history outline given here is a tentative-selection and 
arrangement of subject matter for grade seven. The material 
does not differ greatly from that which former teachers of the 
seventh grade have found both suitable for children of that 
-school year, and desirable as a background for the work of the 
-eighth grade. There is, however, a new arrangement which 
necessitates the omission of certain topics and the expansion of 
others formerly given in that grade, and the introduction of a 
few new ones. 
The plan was made as here outlined because it seemed 
advisable to try for a second year with the same group. of chil- 
den the scheme of arrangement used in grade six—the contin- 
uous narrative. The wide reading of Wells’ Outlines by the gen- 
-eral public proves the. value of that form of organization for 
adults. Such organization would seem then of infinitely greater 
value to children because to them mere chronology is not an orderly 
atrangement. It is in the continuous narrative they feel logical 
sequence. Through it they get a: long sweep down the ages that 
they ‘are unable to get from a treatment of special nations and 
periods. The result is a feeling of historical unity, a knowledge 
of inter-relations, and the ability to trace relationships. 
It is difficult to choose from the great number of topics that 
suggest themselves the one that best lends itself to such treat- 
ment. After much reading and some experimental planning in 
which the teacher was guided by the interest of her group in 
ships and all things nautical, The Development. of Sea Power 
was chosen as the thread upon which, “like beads on a chain,” 
all the related facts of history are to be hung. Aside from being 
one of the most vital considerations in the lives of peoples and” 
nations today, this subject has the additional advantage for 
historical treatment of a long’ development from primitive be- 
ginnings. It reaches into the hearts of nations, for one cannot 
understand a nation’s place of prominence in the world’s trade” 
without some knowledge of the agriculture, manufacturing, in- . 
ventions, and arts of that nation. In this plan these phases can 
» 149
-P-A-G-E-150
150 SociaL Scrmence SErrms 
be studied, not as isolated developments of individual nations, 
but as the means by which peoples and nations became depend- 
ent upon each other, and as influences that brought about the 
world relationships of today. It is hoped that a study of the 
way in which these relationships came about will give pupils a 
lasting realization of the need for world peace and unity—lasting 
because based upon knowledge, not upon unsubstantiated senti- 
ment. At least, such a plan gives opportunity for children to 
see the forging of a chain that grew, link by link, through many 
ages, binding peoples together and giving them interests and 
sympathies in common. 
As there is no textbook with the plan of treatment above 
described, the work will be carried on with the grade by means of 
reference books. Much help can be counted upon from Miss 
Hall’s. Our Ancestors in Europe, and the grade will be supplied 
with some mimeographed. lessons now in the course of 
preparation.

The work of the other grade subjects will be related to the 
history or will be direct outcomes of that subject. No pre-arranged 
plan has been made for the art and handwork, as those periods 
will be given over, in the main, to free, self-initiated pupil-ac- 
tivities. Periods have been reserved for printing, woodwork, and 
art, and sufficient time has been allowed on the program for the 
carrying forward of large individual and community projects. 
Since the subject-matter of the grade has not been radically 
changed, it is expected that children’s interests. may cause the 
* special subjects to have an outcome not materially different ftom 
that of previous years. Therefore, the outline used in previous 
years is given here, as it suggests some projects that may arise in 
connection with the work of the grade and the needs of the school. 
Art.—The art work centers around two important activities: 
press-printing and the making by hand of an illumination on | 
real parchment. All printed gift cards, booklets, etc. are hand 
decorated, some by free decoration, some by original zinc etch- 
ings, hand colored, making an opportunity for creative art work 
on every impression from the press. Flower, insect, animal 
forms are studied carefully and applied on smaller pieces of 
work, in preparation for the parchment work. Much drawing 
is done in the garden. Some landscape study and simple figure 
drawing are done also. Careful study of the alphabet forms of 
all the important types is made. Labeling of school papers and 
drawings, in single line alphabets, is part of the preparatory. 
drill. The most careful work in design, color and arrangement 
of texts is done on the parchment, which, because of its beauty 
and permanency, provides a deep and earnest motive which is 
intensified by the fact that it is to be a gift to the home. 
Handwork.— 
Printing—Printing is’ the form of handwork chosen for both 
boys and girls in the seventh grade. It requires just the qualities” 
pupils of this age long to express. ‘It necessitates, as no other 
activity could, careful attention to form in composition, and because 
of its great usefulness to the community and the permanency of 
the printed page, supplies a motive which gives a maximum of 
organized knowledge and skill with a minimuni expenditure of 
time. The type of work done progresses from simple name lists 
of grades, used for checking, and small gift cards, to more com- : .

plicated setting of cover pages, catalogues, programs, and busi- 
ness and banking blanks (used in play business and bank). 
Later pamphlets or booklets of some literary text or compila- . 
tion are printed. Color printing, designing and drawing for 
zinc etchings, simple chalk plate work, and binding are included.

EIGHTH GRADE 
ENGLISH HISTORY 
  
The most important principle of teaching is—is it not ?— 
» that we should encourage children in a questioning habit of 
mind; train them not to aecept what the book says, what the 
* teacher says, what the newspaper says, what the herd says, but - 
to think for themselves. ‘Now this is peculiarly difficult in 
history teaching. Even the scholar, using original sources, scans 
‘these sources with suspicion, accepts them with grave reserva- 
tions, recognizes the fact that the contemporary chronicler was 
limited by his prejudices and his ignorance. And all this sus- 
picion and these reservations, as well as the deductions which 
the scholar allows himself to draw from these sources, are of 
course as much the result of the scholar’s own prejudices and 
limitations, as of his trained mind, What defense, then, has 
the child from his textbook, often many times removed from — 
original sources and a crystallization of traditional prejudice 
and ignorance? The conscientious teacher, trying to train chil- 
dren in the questioning habit of mind, in skepticism in its literal 
sense, wonders whether history has a place in the curriculum. 
We must certainly not accept tradition in education and then 
invent or adopt reasons for our practice. We must rather 
steadily question our practice and constantly reject all that is 
merely the result of prejudice or tradition. Unless we do so, 
our-influence upon education is a pernicious one. ‘Shall we 
therefore give up teaching history? Why not teach a child to 
read, and then let him read history if he will? Is it not merely 
a matter of reading? Can a conscientious teacher teach a text- 
book subject such as history? Or, if we justify ourselves by the 
need of feeding the “insatiable desire of the human mind for 
knowledge,” how can we still, while teaching history, train the 
questioning habit? 
One way I find is by beginning with a little elementary 
economics. I should like, therefore, to sketch a piece of work 
that I have found is a valuable basis for history study. I shall 
briefly describe the plan of this economics teaching upon which 
the teaching of English History is partly based, and point out 
some of its possibilities.

ation. “The best plan, perhaps, is for each of you to choose a tax that interests 
yout and report upon it to the class, and show us whether it is'a good t ax. 
For instance, the French Government once put a tax upon windows. What 
is the result of such a tax?

PUPIL’S CHART OF TAXES
-P-A-G-E-158
158 Socrat Science Serres _ 
(NOTE: The teacher takes no responsibility for Stanley’s conclusions 
in regard to some of these taxes. He formed his opinion from the children’s 
reports. All the charts differ somewhat.) 
Teacher. Sometimes the tax has some other purpose than to raise 
money. Does any one here own a dog? What tax-do you pay on it? What is 
the purpose of this tax? 
Rupil. To decrease the number of dogs in the city. 
Teacher. In your report, please inform us whether your tax has -any 
other purpose than the raising of revenue. This dog tax you pay to the city. 
To whom does your father pay his automobile tax? 
“Pupil. To the state and the city. 
Teacher. To whom does yotr father pay his income tax? 
Pupil. To the United States Government. 
Teacher. In your. report, please state to what government the tax is to 
be paid. We must know, also, how the fax is collected, how much revenue 
it produces, and how expensive it is to collect. We need to know when the 
tax was first levied. Do you think a tax should be levied according to a 
man’s ability to pay, or according to the benefit he receives from the 
government? ~ 
William. According to his ability to pay. 
Jack. I don’t think so. That fines a man for industry and intelligence 
and prudence. 
Teacher. How many agree with William? How many agree with Jack? 
William. “Ii Jack is right, the people in the poor house should pay the 
most, because they get the most benefit from the government. (Jack fails to 
see the fallacy of this argument.) . 
Teacher. I shatl not tell you which I agree with, but we shall need to 
know when you make your report on which theory the taxing body was 
proceeding. ° 
Following is a stenographic record of an oral composition on. 
iaxation, prepared by a section of the class: 
Stanley, One of the most important duties of governments, past and 
present, is taxation. Taxation is like fire; when used wisely, it is extremely 
valuable, but when used indiscreetly, it can become equally dangerous. Most 
governments have realized the importance of fair taxation. Some, however, 
have overused their levying power, and the result was a strong feeling in the 
opposition, or even rebellion. An example of the results of unfair taxation is 
the American Revolution. One of the taxes that caused the war was the 
Stamp Act. The tax in itself was a fair one, but the way in which it was 
levied was unfair. The American colonies were taxed without representation 
in England. Many rebellions have had as one of their main roots unfair ‘tax- 
ation. The history of taxation dates back into the days of ancient Egypt, 
when the Pharaoh, as the result of his right to levy taxes, accumulated immense 
wealth and power. Every civilization since then has had taxation as one of the 
functions of its government. In England, when a king had the right to levy’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
Tue Course 1n History 159 
taxes, it was comparatively easy for him to make himself a despot. Ever 
since the beheading of Charles I, however, when Parliament proved itself to 
be the master, the king has had more and more difficulty to gain any power 
whatsoever. Now Parliament controls taxation and all affairs of state, and 
the king is a figure-head. In America, the people, as represented by Congress, 
levy taxes. The House of Representatives proposes the taxes. The house 
has this privilege, because it has a complete change in membership every two 
years. The new members know what the people want, and act accordingly. 
There are four kinds of taxes: Those levied by the federal government, the 
state government, the county goverriment, and the city government. There 
are two theories of taxation: first, according to the ability to pay; and the 
second, according to the benefit received from the government. The income 
tax is operated on. the first theory; the single tax, which is not in operation, 
would operate on the second theory. In America, although unpopular taxes 
have been passed, there are a few good ones. | 
Jack. A good tax has many characteristics. During medieval times, the 
French had a tax on window space. The tax was so high that only the rich 
could pay it; consequently, the poor could not have ‘light or air in their 
homes. It seems that the French idea of a tax was on everything that was a 
necessity among the lower classes. As history shows, this in time led to a 
terrible revolution. Many wars have been caused by taxes on articles people 
~ could not long go without. One of the most important qualities of a good tax is 
its -productiveness. Of course it‘would be foolish to have a tax on green 
horses or pink elephants, for who would own one of these? The English have 
a tax on tea and sugar. Although these dre not absolute necessities, most 
Englishmen drink tea and put sugar in it, so this tax is very productive. 
Some taxes are a great temptation to dishonesty. The personal property tax 
is a very poor tax in this sense. If there was a tremendous tax on building, 
many poor people would be without homes, and many concerns would cease to 
function. A good tax should not be a stop to improvements. The Navigation 
Act caused a revolution, and yet it was only a tax, but it was a tretmendous 
discouragement to business. 
Then there is the tax that is a profit to individuals. Say that the French 
have been manufacturing gloves at one dollar a pair. They have been selling 
: them to American dealers for two dollars, who have been selling them for 
five. A tax of five dollars is now placed on every pair sent to America. 
The gloves are now being sold for ten. An American concern makes American 
gloves for three and sells them for nine and the public is paying four dollars 
more than it did before the tax was levied and paying it to the manufacturer, 
to enrich him. 
Then there is the tax that cat be easily shifted. Say that a tax of three 
cents is put upon every pound of butter made at the concern. This butter 
has been selling for twenty-cents a pound wholesale. The price is now raised 
to thirty. Retail, the butter has been selling for forty-five cents. It now 
sells for sixty. A laborer who has been working for one dollar an hour now 
has his pay raised to two, blaming it on the high cost of living, while if a 
three cent stamp had been placed on every pound package of butter and the 
buyer had paid for it, this would not have happened.

Gebhardt. These facts show what a good tax is. A good tax that has all 
these points is very rarely found, although a good tax is an essential part of 
government. The stamp tax which requires a stamp on legal documents, seems 
to me a good tax. 
The stamp tax is not on necessities, because legal documents are not 
necessities. It is not a temptation to dishonesty, because the fee on the tax 
is so small that it is not worth while to counterfeit it. It is not discouraging 
to business, because it has nothing to do with the running of a business. It 
is very productive, and last year brought in seventy-five million dollars. It 
js not an excessive profit to individuals, because the government and the man 
who buys stamps are the only people concerned. It is a direct tax and cannot 
be shifted, because the government is the only person that has anything to do 
with it. It should not be expensive in collecting, because the stamp is bought 
by the person who wants it. It is not in politics, because it has nothing to do 
with politics. It does not favor one class, because everybody who wants to 
make a document legal -has to pay this tax. Every day, ways are being found 
to dodge bad taxes.’ 
Betty. But dodging bad taxes does not do away with them. The customs 
tax is a bad tax. It is a tax on exported arid imported goods. Germany is the 
only country that I know of now that has the export tax. The import’ duties 
are five kinds; the ad valorem, specific, compound, minimum, and the discrimi- 
nating. The ad valorem duty is placed on the price or value of the mer- 
chandise. The specific is on the quantity, whether the goods come by the 
yard, pound, or any other unit. Compound duty is a mixture of the specific 
and ad valorem, and is placed on, raw materials and manufactured goods. The 
minimum I could not find anything about, so I do not imagine it is of ‘any 
importance. The discriminating duty is a duty in. addition to the usual duties, 
and depends upon which country the goods came from and in what country’s 
ships. This tax is on necessities, but they are trying to put a stop to that. 
It is a temptation to dishonesty, that is, to smuggling. It is discouraging to 
foreign’ business, but very encouraging to American business, for this tax 
besides the purpose of gaining revenue, is for guarding the home manu- 
facturers. It is an excessive profit to the individual as Jack has explained. 
This tax can be shifted, for if a large manufacturer wishes to get some 
goods from a foreign country and he has to pay the customs tax, he can-add 
the tax on to the regular price of the goods and we indirectly pay it. It is 
very expensive in collecting, for they need experienced men to price the. 
valuable goods which come into this country, and they have to have trust- 
worthy men also. This tax is in politics, because a new party will change 
the tariff tax. This tax does favor one class, the manufacturers. This tax 
is very productive, although it is expensive in collection. : 
Joseph, As has been said before, taxation has continued through the long 
ages, ever since the Pharaohs of Egypt levied taxes and accumulated great 
wealth. Government without taxation could not exist. Government without 
taxation is like a fire without fuel. In order for government to be popular, 
it must have a fair system of levying taxes. A fair tax must have all the 
characteristics of a good tax. ‘An exceptional example of good tax is the 
Stamp Act. Taxation is a tool in the hands of the government; if it is used

with discretion the government will survive and flourish. If it is used unwisely | 
the government will meet with disfavor: No matter how poor or rich,a man 
may be, directly or indirectly he pays a share of the taxes. : 
This study, I find, helps one to teach history without aban- 
doning the principle that we must train the children to question 
all things. It will be noted that many of the English history 
‘léssons emphasize the influénce of taxation upon the develop- 
ment of the Constitution, eg., 5,-7, 9, 10, 11, 12. Before un- 
dertaking English history the class had. made a careful study 
of our constitution and its omissions. The teacher then pro- 
pounded the query, “Why, after the European war, when so 
many new states were created, and were adopting their forms of 
government, did all of them adopt the English so-called parlia~ 
“mentary system rather than our own? Can you see any proofs 
that our own is a good one?” 
Pupil. It has lasted for a hundred and thirty-five years. 
Second Pupil. It is very elastic, for it was made for three million people 
and works well for a hundred five million. 
. Third Pupil. It was made for a small seaboard country and works for a 
large one. 
Fourth Pupil. It was made for thirteen states and works for forty-eight. 
Fifth Pupil. It was made for a country where.there were no railroads, 
no telegraphs, no telephones, no radio, in which agriculture was the chief 
industry, yet it works for the modern state. 
Teacher. Why, then, did the new countries. without exception reject 
it and adopt parliamentary government? We will try to find out. 
Following are the lesson sheets given each week to the 
class with references. The lessons’ are intended to arouse questions 
in the children’s minds and help them to the answers; to keep in 
their minds the economic basis of government; and to bring them 
back finally to the original question, “Were the new Européan states 
right in preferring parliamentary to presidential government?” 
The children took a test each week on the week’s lesson. Then 
we had a careful oral review, intended to throw more light on the 
whole subject. Then there was a second test for those who, failed 
in the first. The tests are omitted, with the exception of the first.

LESSON II--PEASANT REVOLT 
Did the Peasant Revolt fail? Seven thousand men perished 
on the gallows.. Parliament declared the king’s pardons null and 
void. They said that their serfs were their goods, and the king 
could not take their goods from them without their consent. 
“And .this consent,” they added, “we have never given, and 
never will give to our dying day.” 
Nevertheless, the aim of the revolt was secured. Serfage 
was henceforth “on the road to ultimate extinction.” A century 
and a half later it had become very rare.

‘LESSON II[—CHARTERS OF LIBERTY 
.Why do Americans study English History?

equality and-brotherhood from French philosophers. Their 
ideas of political rights they got from English History. 
Read: Declaration of Independence, first two sentences and 
last sentence. . 
Learn: Charters of English Liberty. 
On July 4, 1776, the American Colonies declared themselves 
independent of England. They asserted that the English gov- 
ernment had exercised tyrannical power over them; that it had 
attempted to over-ride certain rights to which all Englishmen 
_ were entitled; that these rights were to be found in certain” 
historical documents, which, in both England and America, had 
been revered as Charters of English Liberty. 
These documents were: 
Magna Charta, 1215. 
Petition of Rights, 1628. 
Habeas Corpus Act, 1679. 
Bill of Rights, 1689. 
English common law. 
LESSON IV—MAGNA CHARTA 
In 1215 the nobles tried to take power from an unjust king, 
and succeeded. In 1381 Wat Tyler and sixty thousand peasants” 
tried to take power from the unjust nobles, and failed. What 
remedy for injustice did England finally work out?

touch with our own hands; the Great Charter which, from age 
to age, men have looked back to as the groundwork of English 
liberty.” .

Why did Simon de Montfort call knights and burgesses 
(townsmen) to his parliament? To get money to aid in his 
war against the king. Why did Edward I do the same thing 
on a larger scale? To get money for his war against France. 
Why did Edward I confirm two charters? To get money for his 
wars in France and Scotland. 
So the fight of parliament for power has heen won by means 
_ of taxation. . 
There are two ways in which a king may regain the power 
his ancestors have lost. First, he may avoid war, which is 
expensive, Secondly, he may devise ways of getting money 
without calling Parliament.* =

carried on before the invention, just what the invention was, 
and how it changed the industry and affected the laborers. 
Read Cheyney, pages 578, 597-599. 
In the last part of the 18th century a great change in the 
ways of producing goods occurred, which is known as the in- 
_ dustrial revolution and which was due to the invention of ma- 
-chinery and the application of steam power to machinery. This 
“industrial revolution” changed entirely the social and political 
‘history of England, and it is necessary to study it if we are to 
understand the 19th century in England. 
In medieval tithes ownership of land by a very few men 
resulted in giving the owners large powers over the lives of 
those who needed to use their land to live. When feudalism 
was at its height, in what ways were the serfs dependent on 
their lords? 
Under the factory system machines for producing the neces- 
sities of life were so expensive that only a few people could 
own them, What were the disadvantages of this system to the 
laborers? Compare these with the disadvantages of the laborer 
under the feudal system. 
“The immediate effect of the industrial revolution upon the 
countries to which it came, was to cause a vast, distressful shift- 
ing and stirring of the mute, uneducated, leaderless, and now 
more and more propertyless common population.’ The small 
cultivators and peasants, ruined and dislodged by the Enclosure 
Acts, drifted towards the new manufacturing regions, and there 
they joined the families of the impoverished and degraded crafts- 
men in the factories. Great towns of squalid houses came into 
existence. Nobody seems to have noted clearly what was going 
‘on at the time......... Ugly great factories grew up, built as 
cheaply as possible, to hold as many machines and workers as” 
possible. .Around them gathered the streets of workers’ homes, 
built at the cheapest rate, without space, without privacy, barely 
decent and let at the utmost rent that could be exacted. . These 
néw industrial centers were at first without schools, without 
churches........ ”

PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT 
Government is and has been the main factor of all of the leading 
countries and the guiding influence of all the nations of.-the world. 
Many nations have tried different forms of government, but the parlia- 
mentary form has been the most successful. As a proof of this, the new 
countries which have been originated since the World War, have adopted 
and accepted parliamentary government. Examples of these countries 
are Poland, Jugostavia, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and many other smaller 
nations. . 
Of course English government is backed by nearly 1,000 years of 
experience, while American government has had comparatively little 
experience. Parliamentary government has had a chance to improve 
and profit by its experience while presidential government has not. Be- 
cause parliamentary government is an older institution is probably one 
reason the new countries have adopted it. 
However they have watched the results of both governments and 
have seen the good and bad points of both. 
Many people think that English or parliamentary government is 
better because their constitution is easier to amend. A bill only has to 
be passed through Parliament while our government requires two-thirds 
of Congress and three-fourths of the legislatures of each state. 
A great deal of the English government is run by customs which 
also enables bills to be passed very easily. The only fault with so many 
customs is that some day an influential person like the prime minister
-P-A-G-E-172
172 SocraL Science SERIES 
will disregard these customs and form a despotism. America has- one 
‘bad custom of the choice of nominees being left in the hands of politicians, 
of the various parties. 
Parliamentary government has both legislative and executive powers 
in one hand. America has not, which is better in the respect that a man can 
be a better executive than a legislator. . . 
A very marked advantage of parliamentary government over ours 
is the fact that they cannot have a deadlock. This is because the Prime 
Minister resigns if a bill which he-presents is not passed by Parliament. 
The presence of so many parties is also a warrant against deadlocks. 
The American government works by a check and balance system 
but deadlocks are frequent. If the President and House are Republican and 
the Senate is Democratic, the House will pass no bill the Senate presents, 
the Senate will pass nothing the House presents. The President vetoes 
everything the Senate présents. Parliamentary government has a much 
better check in the House of Lords. Although the House of Lords has 
no real veto power, its refusal to pass a bill three times makes the peopie 
think and a reform may be introduced. At least this check eliminates 
all deadlocks. . 
Representation seems to have been worked out better in England 
than in America because they have representation by population. We 
have two Senators from every state, no matter if some states have ten 
times as many people. 
The English system of government is understood by its people. 
American government is so much in the hands of politics that the people 
do not have nearly so* much control nor as much interest, nor 
understanding. . 
At the change of every administration in America people are made 
jobless. In England this is not half so common. 
Because of the supremacy of the House of Commons the will of 
the people can be more easily brought to bear on the government. As 
‘the people can thus gain more control it is probable that this is the reason 
for parliamentary government being adopted. 
Maybe one of the greatest reasons for parliamentary, government 
being preferred is that the head of the nation, the king, is a mere figure-~ 
head. The President of the United ‘States is a king and prime minister _ 
in one. This gives him immense power. However, his term in office is 
fixed and if he does not please his party another man probably from the 
opposite party will be elected. This revolutionizes the country and keeps 
it in constant turmoil. 
The main reason that comes from a result of all this reasoning and 
that which the nations had in mind when accepting parliamentary gov- 
ernment was that it is a more complete democracy.

Note—The history in this grade varies somewhat from year: 
to year, as the children’s interests and abilities vary, and as 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
Tue Course 1x Hisrory 173 
the demands made by current events vary. Three divisions, 
however, are fairly constant: 
A. The Life of Lincoln. This involves the study of 
American history from 1787 to 1865, with special emphasis upon 
the slavery question and the framing of the constitution, and 
somewhat less emphasis upon the civil service. \ 
B. The Origin of the Earth, The First Appearance of Life, 
The First Appearance of Man on the Earth, Prehistoric Man, 
The Stages of Culture, and an ancient civilization (generally 
Rome). . 
C. The Growth of the English Constitution from Magna 
Charta to the Present Time. 
The work in the social sciences apart from history varies 
still more than the history. It generally includes, however, a 
study of taxation, the problems of immigration, the history and 
government of Chicago, study of the American constitution, 
and comparison with the English constitution. I have already, 
in Vol. VI of the Studies in Education written at some length 
on the study of the Life of Lincoln, endeavoring to illustrate 
by examples of children’s work certain aids to teaching. These 
were in particular a flexible curriculum, which allows the teacher 
to vary her work from year to year, and which predicates free- 
dom from a textbook; a flexible program which permits the 
class to begin the day with the things which seem most press- 
‘ing; and especially freedom from departmental work, so that 
the teacher can intensify the meaning of her subject through 
literature, oral. expression, written expression, drawing, history, 
geography—-in short through every form of expression and 
every avenue of impression. I have not therefore spoken again 
of these matters in this place, nor of our work in American his- 
tory; nor have I written about Section B, the importance of 
which Mr. Wells and Mr, Van Loon have insisted upon so con- 
vincingly. This study of the coming of man upon the earth 
and of prehistoric man comes as a part of our science teaching. | 
It occupies comparatively little time, but it seems essential as a 
foundation for thinking about history. Such a lesson as the one 
which follows, together with a chart of the estimated length of | 
‘geologic ages, helps children. to the right perspective.

The earliest man of whom traces have yet been discovered, 
lived perhaps 500,000 years ago. During those 500,000 years, 
certain inventions and discoveries have been of such importance 
as to mark the beginnings of new eras. We divide the existence 
of mankind on earth into three great periods: Savagery, Bar- 
barism, and Civilization. "We divide each of these into three

° HISTORY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL | 
The course in history in the high school is a survey of the 
.progress of mankind from the days of anciént Egypt and Babylonia 
to the United States of the twentieth century. It provides historical 
study for each of the four grades and follows historical order: 
Ancient History in the ninth grade, Medieval in the tenth, Modern 
Europe in the eleventh, American in the Twelfth. 
The plan is, not to attempt a minutely detailed study, but to 
help the pupil to gain a sympathetic understanding of certain sig- 
nificant periods in the development of mankind. And as the study 
of a period is always richer through a knowledge of its literature 
and art, there has been some correlation of these sub/ects with 
history. There are besides numberless ramifications into the fields of 
economics, civics, and general sociology, but owing to college entrance 
requirements, more time must be spent on details and memory drills 
than appears useful or educational. Moreover, since these require- 
ments call for only one unit of history, not all the pupils go through 
the entire course. As in so many other affairs, it is a condition 
not a theory, that determines the carrying out of the formulated 
plan, 
The study of history is important enough to lead to the expecta- 
tion that it will in time be placed in the same rank as the study of 
English, which runs through the entire high school course of every 
pupil. Recent events have emphasized, unprecedentedly, the oneness 
of mankind in fundamental interests; and, apparently, if we are to 
escape another calamity like the World War we must clarify the 
minds of men by vital instruction in the meaning of civilization. 
That is the task of the schools, for the minds of the young are. 
susceptible as they cannot be in later life to education in toleration, 
right thinking, broad humanitarianism. For the cultivation of such 
mental and moral character the proper study of history is perhaps 
the most direct and effectual means. If the history of mankind is 
a continual struggle between education and catastrophe, education 
must have a genuine moral basis, No one who reads the history of 
the race thoughtfully and with candid mind can fail to see-in it 
clear indications of the folly of injustice, of selfish ambition, of 
national haughtiness, of racial animosity; and he can hardly fail to 
175
-P-A-G-E-176

see, also, that owing to the universality of printing and the almost 
instantaneous communication of knowledge, the rapidity of transpor- 
tation and the financial and industrial interdependence of mankind, 
we are all “bound together in the bundle of life” as never before. 
It.is the function of history-study in the schools to make this doc- 
trine a vital fact in the mental and moral attitude of youth. 
The history curriculum of the high school is as follows: 
NintH GRADE: 
Ancient time to 800 A. D. 
TENTH GRADE: 
European—800 to 1789, or to 1814 
ELEVENTH GRADE: 
-European—nineteenth century 
TWELFTH GRADE: - 
American History 
ANCIENT HISTORY IN THE NINTH GRADE 
Perusal of the Social Science Course, with its emphasis upon 
history. in the elementary grades, reveals the fact that a normal 
pupil should come to the high school with a rich fund of historical 
imagery. Through these experiences and the sharing of labor which 
they have necessitated, the children completing the elementary school 
course have had opportunity to realize something of the effects of 
environment upon mankind ; to see to what extent community life is 
essential in the development of civilization; to become to some 
extent familiar with the economic problems of life and learn the 
value of the division of labor; and to get some view of the simpler 
problems confronting society today. 
. The relation between the historical subjects for the different 
grades is of a most general character, Each is chosen for the variety 
of human experience it may bring to the attention of the pupil; 
also for its suitability in connection with the child’s age and its 
possibilities in arousing certain reactions, For the lower grades 
it has been found that chronology makes little appeal to children; 
for they naturally group their ideas about a vivid personal experi- 
ence, about a great person, a great achievement, or a great event. In 
the early adolescent period the center of interest usually shifts, and 
the pupil begins to give attention to the relationship of events and
-P-A-G-E-177
THe Course in History “177 
to tracing cause and effect in a more logical manner. Because of 
his interest, and because it seems the best possible foundation upon 
which to base all future study, Ancient History is given in the ninth 
grade. 
The course for the year’s work traces the career of man from 
. prehistoric time through the oriental nations, through Greece_and 
Rome, to the rule of Charlemagne, 800 A. D. In. this course the 
chief idea is to give a coherent, comprehensive picture of the past, 
to create a perception of ‘historical perspective, and, through the 
analysis of events, to stimulate the student’s aim and desire for 
justice and right. 
From my own experience I believe that. ninth grade pupils can 
gain more by studying in chronological order the history of the 
nations mentioned than by any other method. They see from day 
to. day how the arts, industries, religious beliefs, and philosophical 
theories grew; how each age influenced the successive civilizations, 
and how different peoples improved what they borrowed, or them- 
selves made distinct and original contributions to progress, In the 
study of these various periods and their many changes, the student— 
however vaguely it may be—senses the marvels of life. He sees 
man blindly working out questions of faith, freedom, industry, art, 
and education; he begins to look at religion, government, and insti- 
tutions as living issues that grow and develop as we do. With 
knowledge he acquires faith in the corner stones on which all civiliza- 
tion rests. 
How deep seated is the instinct thus to link our lives with those 
of times long past, how valuable the possession of accurate knowl- 
edge in the gratification of that instinct, needs no proof. A single 
illustration suffices. No greater interest has been manifested by the 
public in any recent event than in the Egyptian discoveries in the’, 
“Valley of the Kings.” While even the uninitiated are in a position 
through the newspapers and magazines to. marvel and appreciate 
our debt to the past in the works unearthed, how much greater is 
the appreciation of those who have studied the history of the races 
of mankind and who have been trained in historical perspective! 
In connection with the reports of the finding of King Tutankhamen’s 
tomb such headlines as “Robbers of the 14th Century B. C. May 
Have Preceded the Egyptologists” or “Abraham’s Birthplace to be 
Excavated,” deeply stir the imagination and especially: appeal : to. 
those readers who have studied. Ancient History.

‘While the study of history unquestionably thus vivifies the past 
and deepens one’s interest in and insight into the present, it should 
also assist in the cultivation of the beautiful in life; it should-not 
only provide direct acquaintance with those who have played promi- 
nent parts in past ages; but it should—-and, when properly directed, 
it does-—create a desire to form and to struggle toward such ideals 
as those which ruled their lives. Oftentimes we. find that new ideas 
spring into being as the pupil in his historical reading and class 
discussions compares the lives and principles of the great men of the 
time he is studying. For example, the student may he studying 
the characters of Aristides and Themistocles, contemporaries engaged 
in the struggle for power in administering the affairs of a great state. 
For the pupil to prefer a man like Aristides ——-whose devotion to 
his country is proverbial,—-to Themistocles, and at the same time to 
recognize the great services of the latter to his country, is no small 
step in the creation of a standard and of an ideal,   
To realize how public opinion can be swayed by a faithless 
Alcibiades, how the unselfish devotion of a Hannibal may meet with 
only the basest ingratitude from his fellow countrymen, how a 
world conqueror like Alexander implanted a high civilization among 
his subject peoples, are discoveries in those puzzling contradictions 
of human nature that will be of service later on, All this does not 
constitute a mere discovery of some of the many puzzling contra- 
dictions of human nature; it further tends to the building of honest 
and unselfish ideals of service; it is one of the first and longest 
steps toward recognizing the fact.that each of us has opportunity so 
to play his part that the world will be the better for our having lived. 
The people of each age must accept responsibility for the conditions 
under which: they consent to live, and only as a consciousness of 
that responsibility is realized will pupils begin to see how their own 
lives count, not only in their generation, but in the generations yet 
to come. :

held four times a week, one can tealize the possibilities for develop-

One -of the textbooks, Professor Breasted’s Ancient Times—A 
History of the Early World, abounds in pictorial representations of 
monuments and records found in the East, in Europe, and in 
Northern Africa. These daily become of greater interest to the 
pupil when he realizes that the originals of these pictures are most 
important sources of our knowledge and that these copies provide
-P-A-G-E-180
180 SociaL SCIENCE SERIES 
proof that he is reading facts and not fiction. To help in impressing 
the full import of these valuable illustrations the classes are asked, 
on the completion of a given period of history, to make ‘out a table 
showing the salient facts in connection with the subject. 
The following is an example of stich a table:

    Most of these historical objects have been taken over by differ- 
ent governments. They are in the great museums accessible to all. 
By the end of the year the pupil has gained a little knowledge of , 
the historical contents of many of the great museums of the world. 
Furthermore, his interest in the arts has been greatly stimulated, 
and he usually acquires a lively desire ‘to visit not only the scenes 
of great historical happenings but the places that house the relics 
of them, 
Locally the pupils are able to visit the Field Museum and the 
Art Institute, where study of wonderful exhibits familiarizes them 
with original monuments, or their reproductions. They learn prac- 
tically what an important part the modern museum plays in im- 
proving the knowledge, educating the ‘taste; and satisfying the 
esthetic sense of the people. . :

Study of the extant remains also arouses the pupil’s interest 
-in the written documents of the different periods, and it is not - 
difficult to instil admiration and appreciation of. the work of the 
discoverers. The pupils are quick to recognize the debt we owe 
to the scholars who, by translation of the papyri, the clay tablets, 
and other original documents yearly discovered in the Mediterranean 
countries and the East, are making adequate and authentic: our 
knowledge of man’s history from the pre-historic age through the 
great civilizations of Greece and Rome, 
_ When the pupil holds in his hands an actual clay tablet dug up in 
Babylon itself—and realizes that it tells a tale that is even properly 
dated, a date which scholars have deciphered as being on or about 
2350 B. C_—he begins to appreciate what the world owes to men 
like Champollion, Sir Henry Rawlinson, Professor Harper, and 
numerous others who have devoted their lives to archaeology. 
In addition to other aids, periodicals, slides and pictures of - 
historical remains motivate the reading of historical narratives: 
For instance, the picture of the great “Ishtar Gate” erected in the 
6th Century, which. stood before the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, 
makes much keener the interest in William Sterns Davis’ Belshazzar, 
which contains much accurate historical description of Babylon. 
Pictures of the brick chambers of the Colosseum of Rome, in 
which the Christians were imprisoned before being thrown to the 
lions, give a sense of reality to the text of Quo Vadis, in which it 
‘is described. The news of an eruption of Vesuvius may chance to 
appear in our newspapers the very day on which the class is studying 
photographs of Pompeii, with its houses, stores, palaces, and temples, 
and their contents. This gives the very thrill of life to the printed 
page, and many of the pupils become anxious to lose themselves i in 
the romance of history. 
When the pupil begins to see how the world is indebted to the 
past for its knowledge, he is willing to bow in admiration to the 
French for their excavations at Delphi; to praise the Germans for 
their work at Olympia; to honor Champollion for unlocking the 
Egyptian language ; and to hail Sir Henry Rawlinson for deciphering 
the Behistun Rock and thus ‘restoring the languages of ancient 
Persia and Babylonia, At some future date he may be prepared 
to advocate an international understanding for carrying on such 
works, in order to expand our knowledge of civilization.

In the actual teaching of this course little difficulty has been — 
found in thus linking the past with the present, and the newspapers, 
’ the current magazine, the cinema, the play, and the novel are some 
of the agencies of its accomplishment. By these means attention is 
focused upon some selected point of time past, and the life of that 
time is recreated for us. 
The following plan indicates the steps taken in developing a 
topic. Supposing the topic to be The Constitutional Changes in 
Athens from 750 to 520 B. C., the necessary reading is indicated 
and the pupils are asked to come to the class prepared to ask 
questions bearing on the subject. There is then an informal dis- 
cussion of the questions involved, the problems and the topics upon 
which ‘more information is desired by any pupil. Where special 
points are raised, volunteers look up in histories and reference books 
the topics on which the information is desired. In the classes, wall 
maps are constantly in use, routes are traced, places located, and 
the pupils make maps showing the political changes that have taken 
place in certain countries, While the children’s questions are being 
answered, and newly arisen questions are being discussed and con- 
tributions from original sources are being added to the general 
fund of information, no attempt is made by the teacher to direct 
toward a certain end or to hold to a particular arrangement, There- 
fore the final step in the development of a topic is the shaping of the 
whole into condensed, well organized form. With the help of the 
teacher the main points or heads of the subject are set forth in 
orderly arrangement. The burden then falls on the pupil to support 
these headings,—in other words, to write a digest, This method 
helps in the analysing of the important points, in correlating the 
material and in memorizing the salient facts.

Periods of history are reviewed and the work culminates either 
in a written test, a morning exercise, or a theme. The following 
paper, written by one of the pupils after the class had reviewed the 
period covering The Last Days of the Roman Republic, 146-31 B. C., 
illustrates the theme method of rounding out a topic. 
WEALTH AND POVERTY DESTROYED THE ROMAN 
CHARACTER WITHOUT PUTTING ANYTHING 
BETTER IN ITS PLACE 
At the end of the Punic Wars Rome had acquired 4 great deal of 
wealth and territory. Rome was not fit for the gigantic task of governing

THE Course 1n History 183 
these enormous tracts of land and these independent people. Her ancient 
system of the city-kingdom ruling its provinces by appointing governors 
turned out to be a failure. Rome's provincial system was, perhaps, one 
of the greatest causes of the downfall of the Republic and the ruination 
of, the Roman character. Governors were appointed to rule each prov- 
ince. For one year this governor ruled as a king with absolute power. 
Consequently the taxes were usually enormous, for the governor was keen 
to make a huge fortune in one year. There was no check on the power 
ef these governors. The wealth brought into Rome by the returned 
governors and other plunderers of the provinces brought about the form- 
ing of a new wealthy class. They were eager to show off, and extrava- 
gantly lavished money on luxuries, making the poorer classes dissatisfied. 
For who would not be jealous if he saw his formerly humble neighbor, 
returning from some provincial office, erect a magnificent dwelling, with 
running water, steam heat, two floors, and many, many rooms, while he 
himself was forced to continue to live in his one-room house with hot a 
single convenience, not even a chimney! The poorer Romans were 
human and they certainly were jealous. : 
Slavery was comnion at this time. It was the practice of nations to 
make their captives slaves. Ordinarily this would not seem so infuriatingly 
cruel, but can you imagine a former small, ignorant clothing merchant, 
-enriched by the increased commerce, having for his slave an educated 
Greek, possibly ove who had studied. at Alexandria? This, naturally, 
seems ridiculous to us, but it actually happened in hundreds of cases. 
Land was still the most respectable form of wealth, and the newly 
rich were very anxious to acquire it so as to establish their social status. 
Between them and the old aristocrats the small farms were soon all 
bougkt up, and Italy was composed of enormous estates. These estates 
were worked by slaves, who were treated worse than cattle. This was 
very serious to the small farmer. In the first place, much of Italy had 
been devastated by Hannibal. Many men, when they returned from war, 
could not live in a settled way. These men became professional soldiers. 
Others found their farms devastated or bought by some noble. The few 
who returned to the agricultural life were quickly forced to give it up. 
The price of grain was so low because the nobles could grow it so 
cheaply with slaves and because so much was imported that after toiling - 
throughout the year the price given for the crop of grain probably was 
about half of what it had cost the farmer to raise the crop. He would 
sell his farm and go to Rome and depend on the free bread for his food. 
It was wealth which caused all this misery. It was money that 
made the wealthy so extravagant, and it was the lack of it that made the 
poor so unhappy. The buying power of the Romans increased as more 
money came in from the provinces, trade was stimulated, the merchants 
got rich, and all the nobles bought up the land of Italy. What chance 
was lett for the poor man? He could not become a laborer, for all labor 
was done by slaves. Is it any wonder that these wretched people, 
deprived of even work, became desperate? Is it any wonder they became 
 
-P-A-G-E-184

184 Socrat Science SERirs 
corrupt? Is it surprising that they longed for some sort of distraction 
and that they should turn to brutal entertainment? Is -there anything 
strange in the fact that the candidates for office staged gladiatorial com- 
bats and other bloody ‘spectacles to win the popularity of the poor masses? 
Is it peculiar that the office seekers spent entire fortunes bribing the 
unscrupulous throngs? What is there unusual in the fact that the richest 
and most powerful succeeded in getting the offices instead of the ablest? 
Consequently, politics were corrupted. How could ignorant, wretched 
people, desperate because of no work, be- expected to live successfully 
without even a steadying hand to help them? 
Probably you are asking yourself what this had to do with the 
character of the man. The character of the rich was ruined. People 
who can have all that money can buy invariably become proud, selfish, 
oppressive, and unpatriotic. They believe themselves superior to their 
neighbors and are unwilling to assist them. or combine with them for 
anything. In this manner wealth destroys the character of the wealthy. 
How did it destroy the character of the poor? A man who is forced to 
depend on free food for his very life loses all self-respect. If he has no 
self-respect he will in all probability lose his sense of duty. He will 
be jealous of the people who have everything they want, and in faet, 
having lost his sense of duty, he will be jealous enough of them to do 
anything to get in their position or to revenge his own wrongs. So 
wealth destroyed the character of the poor. What was put in place of 
the old honest, brave, patriotic, and unselfish Roman citizen? Nothing. 
Now, you are beginning to wonder how culture could destroy good 
character.. Who do you suppose would be the bravest and most loyal in 
a crisis, a pampered and spoiled child of a wealthy man or a child brought 
up comfortably but who had always helped himself and thought for 1 
deed or say the word or whatever it might be, and if his slave weren’t 
there, he would surely consider himself superior to the latter and leave 
the latter to do it. I believe, howéver, that the latter would unhesi? 
tatingly accomplish whatever-was necessary even though he had the 
opportunity of letting someone else do it.The same comparison may be 
made between the Romans of earlier times and those of the time we are 
speaking. 
The wealthy soon became cultured, that is, as cultured as tutors, 
beautiful works of art, etc., could make them. When they became cul- 
tured they had also become luxury-loving, in most cases. For a man 
who is refined tikes his running water, steam heat, drainage, ete. It was 
~ culture which made the rich love luxury, and it was luxury which destroyed 
the character of the rich. The poor need not be spoken of here as they- 
never became cultured. All that refinement meant to them was more 
luxuries to make life even easier. . . 
This has been a description of how “Wealth and Poverty Destroyed 
the Old Roman Character Without Putting Anything Better in Its Place.” 
There were, however, some advantages from the increased capital-and himself? I believe that the former would wait for his slave to do the _

higher civilization. Briefly, among these advantages were the increased 
commerce and business, the founding of banks, a higher education, the 
beginning of Latin literature and of libraries, the erection of more beau- 
tiful buildings and the improvements in architecture, the early attempts 
of Romans to paint and sculpture, improvements in-the homes. 
Most of these things, with the exception of a higher degree of 
. civilization, are material. How can material improvements. make an age 
progress when character has been destroyed and high morals completely 
disappear? Therefore this age is considered one of corruption even” 
though there were material improvements. Louise M. 
In conclusion, what is desired is that students in the Ancient 
History course shall gain an adequate idea of the beginnings of. 
oriental civilization; and shall be able to trace the thought and 
character of the Greeks and the Romans and link their art, literature, 
and science with the present day. They will be expected-to appre- 
ciate the influence of the older civilization upon later times, and to 
carry with them through life a rich picture, full of meaning, and a 
serise of historical continuity. , : 
CORRELATION OF ANCIENT HISTORY AND ART IN 
THE NINTH GRADE > 
The Art Department codperates with the History Department, 
and a brief statement of some of the topics studied last year under 
the art teacher follows: a , 
The class in Ancient History spent some time studying the art 
of Egypt and Greece, taking up the following points: 
I. The Pyramid Age—Egypt: 
Great Pyramid interior and decoration. . ‘ 
II. The Feudal Age—Egypt: : 
Tombs and temples; obelisks and sculpture. 
II. Ovals—Egypt: 
Containing names of Kings and Queens, 
+ IV. Architecture—Egypt: 
Plans-—-facade-—pillars—decoration—-statuary. 
V. Architecture—Greece : 
Plans——pillars—colonnade—clerestory—statuary—decora- 
tion. . 
VI. Seulpture and Painting—Egypt : 
Proportions and symmetry. 
VII. Sculpture and Painting—Greece : 
Proportions and symmetry.  
-P-A-G-E-186
186 Socrat SCIENCE SERIES 
We were led into Dynamic Symmetry in studying Jay Ham- 
bidge’s book, and found out that the application of proportional 
areas was one of the reasons why Egyptian and Greek architecture 
and sculpture reached such perfection. 
The pupils studied enough to appreciate this. somewhat and to 
understand that symmetry is the quality in art or craft which makes 
it good design. They began to realize that the reason the Egyptian 
and Gréek art has always been so vital and well worth studying 
through all time, is because they built organically, with unity and 
reserve—three qualities of utmost importance, Static symmetry is 
more spontaneously used and easier understood, Dynamic symmetry 
is more consciously used, 
In the architecture of our modern cities the children were 
conscious, even from their own small experience, of a lack of unity 
and symmetry—the reason for this being that the buildings are 
planned by several persons, artists in special lines, the engineer and 
architect being different persons; while in Egypt and Greece the 
engineer and architect and decorator were the same artist. 
“The pupils, during the year, used all their handwork time, four 
forty-minute periods a week, in art study and expression, They 
were much interested in the correlation of art with their history 
study. ‘Examples of their work show much appreciation and some 
knowledge of the outstanding principles in the art of both the 
Egyptian and Greek civilization,

MEDIEVAL HISTORY « 
The course of study in this subject is rather a joyous adventure 
than a strained pursuit of knowledge. This happens for several 
reasons, chief of which is the intellectual quality of the classes. 
Owing to the fact that neither the school nor the colleges require a 
complete survey of world history, most pupils elect Ancient History 
and American History, and studiously avoid the long, unilluminated 
range of the Medieval period and, still more unfortunately, the -
-P-A-G-E-187
THE CouRsE IN Hrstory - 187 
vivid and important Modern epoch. A small group, however, is - 
unsatisfied with the piecemeal “course” that contents the majority. 
Such a group naturally is composed of pupils of more than average 
mentality and intellectual curiosity. It is an easy and exhilarating 
job, therefore, that falls to the lot of the teacher; he needs neither 
lure nor lash in the performance of his work. He has merely to 
lead or follow, to advise and suggest, to admit ignorance and devote 
himself afresh to the pursuit’ of the truth. : 
A textbook is of course the most direct and practical means of 
getting into the Past, as well as an almost indispensable guide and 
friend when the student gets there, (It need hardly be said that 
Professor Robinson’s Medieval History is the book of our choice.) 
But the story as told in the text is merely the highway that leads 
‘through the thousand years we have to travel. We come back to 
the road now and then when we have exhausted the byways; but 
the joyous adventure is off the road rather than on it, Before we 
have spent a day or two on the textbook we are ready for another 
plunge into the topics of interest that have opened about us. _ 
It is generally the pupils themselves who propose these topics. 
Sometimes they receive enthusiastically the teacher’s suggestions as 
to interesting matters for investigation, sometimes they are cold 
toward them. I never insist—not with groups like these. Some- 
times the topics run far afield, so that I can not afterward remember 
what it was that suggested them. Such a topic, for example, as 
heredity. Once in a while a pupil discovers that he has pursued a 
subject that is too subtle and elusive for him, and gives it up. 
That happens rarely, however. More frequently the subject fails 
to prove as productive of interesting matter as the investigator had 
expected, though even this does not often occur. 
Our main difficulty is over-production. Class periods are too 
few and too short to dispose of the accumulation of knowledge the 
pupils bring to class. Another criticism of this sort of work is its 
lack of depth and thoroughness, Whei it is recalled, however, that 
these boys and girls are only fifteen. and sixteen years old, the 
surprise is that they dig as deep as they do, In any case there is no 
need of their becoming too well-satisfied with their acquisitions; a 
sensible teacher can always apply the right amount of corrective, 
In a class of this kind, formality is never thought of. The 
relation of teacher and pupils is of easy-going colloquial friendliness.
-P-A-G-E-188
188 - Socrat Science SERIES 
The pupils themselves have full license of speech, which some of 
them use with manifest. enjoyment in genial banter and .derisory 
criticism of a good-natured sort. In the main, however, the spirit 
of the class is serious; though not too heavily so. For no teacher, 
- -however much he may delight in joyous intellectual adventures, 
can be much of a teacher if he be not a lover of the knowledge of 
the truth? and if he be such, his teaching will always be more or 
less concerned with imparting ways and means of acquiring knowl- 
edge and organizing it and communicating it. Even dull pupils will 
geta glimmer of that spirit, but to the mentally alert it will become 
‘a vital part of their education, : : 
The study of Medieval History, then, is with 4 us an attenipt at 
least to live freely in that “curiously” different epoch of the past, 
to follow the broad -highway of events but to digress far and wide 
from the beaten track as dimly visioned interests lure; to know 
how the men and women of those times worked and played and 
fought and loved and worshiped, The dominance of the church, 
the prevalence of feudalism, the upbuilding of the towns, the evolu- 
tion of nations, the recovery of spiritual freedom—this is the broad 
highway. . From this run the paths in every direction, and it is along 
these paths that we have found our main satisfactions. 
Before we take up the textbook, the pupils are asked to turn 
their minds inward to see what they can find there of knowledge of 
the medieval world which we are about to explore, Usually the 
result is a somewhat meager assortment of information, By working 
this over a little, the class begins to get some general notions of the 
scope of the work before us sufficient to enable them to present on 
the following day a pictorial scheme of the entire subject, after the . 
manner of some of Mr. Van Loon’s whimsical illustrations, It is, 
then the function of the teacher to take the class up on a high 
mountain (so to speak) and give them a “grand view” of the ground 
to be covered. He can do this by means of a*glowing exposition 
or by the more prosaic method of opening the textbook to the table 
of contents. In this way it is possible to make clear the importance 
_ of conditions and institutions in the study of the past, and to explaii, 
the relative unimportance of most of the events that used to he laid 
so heavily on pupils’ memories. 
The approach to the Middle Ages'is of course through the 
erumbling ruins of the Roman Empire. Pupils do not seem to care
-P-A-G-E-189
Tus Course in History 189 
to linger here, except to speculate about the causes of the downfall 
of the once great power and to search for analogies between condi- 
tions in Rome and in present day empires, They are content to 
follow the highway of the textbook all through the Barbarian 
Invasions. It is when they come to the Church that they begin to 
' show eagerness to wander off the road. They want more detailed 
information about monasteries and the mode of life of the monks. 
Mohammedanism exerts a still greater fascination, This year we 
reached the period of Mohammedan conquest just as the Turks 
were winning their remarkable victory over the Greeks; and this 
coincidence inspired the class to give the school the benefit of their 
study in a Morning Exercise. Like all normal boys and girls of 
alert mentality, they were fascinated by the speculation of what 
Europe might have become if the religion of Mohammed had not 
. been stayed in the eighth cetitury’ when it was sweeping northward 
through France. Speculation of this sort seems a fruitful exercise 
of the imagination and the reason, but it must always be kept 
distinct, in the pupil’s mind, as mere guesswork. The most interest- 
~ ing excursion made in connection with Mohammedanism was a study 
of Moorish ‘architecture with which one of the boys diverted himself. 
In his report to the class, he made use of books and photographs. 
- So much for the preliminary period, from 400 to 800, Here 
we pause for a day to survey the four centuries we have passed, and 
to look forward across the seven centuries we are to traverse. A 
review furnishes the opportunity to teach the art of organization of 
material, to turn a solution into crystals. Pupils bring the results 
of their attempts to class and submit them to criticism, and: it is 
then that the teacher has the opportunity of showing how it should 
be done—provided he really knows; if not, he can present his own 
contribution and give the class the fun of discovering defects in it. 
At this point, too, is another opening for a pictorial representation 
of the facts; in nearly every class one or more pupils are ingenious - 
and skillful with the pencil, and the result is always stimulating to 
the rest. 
From the “high ground” of Charlemagne’s Empire the pupil 
can discern pretty clearly the road that lies ahead; the centuries of 
feudalism, the ever increasing power of the Church, the Crusades, 
.the development of the towns and kingdoms and the consequent 
'_ disintegration of the feudal system, the awakening to new life in

the Renaissance. It is a story saturated with human interest and 
replete with dramatic situations, Only a pedantic teacher and a 
class of dullards could quench the spirit of delight in such a tale. 
All along the way it opens upon alluring vistas of investigation which 
the class is given full liberty of following, What intelligent boy or 
girl, for instance, would be content with the brief sketch of the 
Hospitalers and Templars, or the character and fate of the medieval 
heretics, or the life in the Italian cities of the Renaissance, Gothic 
architecture, Medieval universities, and a dozen other matters? In 
one corner of the blackboard we keep a list, which is being constantly 
revised, of the subjects the several pupils are investigating—a sort 
of schedule of excursions. Presently—it may not be for a couple of 
weeks—we all “get back”; and it is then that we resume the high- 
way and cover another stretch of the road; that is to say, we read 
another section of the book, and then are off again on our rambles. 
This, in a general way, outlines our procedure in the study of 
Medieval History. It is hardly necessary to say that we are constant 
in our devotion to maps, and that we try to use all the illustrative 
material that can be obtained without too much difficulty, We 
should make more use of the Academy of Arts and the Field Museum 
than we do, but we lack time, or seem to lack it. 
As to notebooks, pupils are advised to “make their own,” which _ 
shall contain the products of their investigation as well as the 
organized knowledge they have obtained. Maps are not required, but 
no pupil is discouraged from making as many as he wishes. It has 
always seemed to me that a deal of time is wasted in student 
cartography; the purpose of maps is to make geography definite, 
and no intelligent man needs more for this purpose than the habit of 
consulting his atlas. If the pupil gains a broad, intelligent view of 
the past or any part of it, if he has found genuine interest and 
pleasure in delving among the ruins of what was once so living and 
“has been able to make it live again in his thought, he has done well. 
If, besides this, he has been able to see, even dimly, that underlying 
all the differences between those times and his own there is a vital 
similarity, that the life of mankind continues with no ruptures save 
those which are external, he will have found a bit of knowledge which 
is the beginning of wisdom,

THE Course In History 191 
MODERN HISTORY 
The most recent addition to our curriculum in the Social Science 
is a course in Modern European History, offered as an elective in 
the senior year. It would seem that sucli a course needs little justi- 
fication as an integral part of any well considered curriculum in 
the Social Sciences, especially for pupils whose education ends with 
the High School. We hold that the course in Modern History is of 
scarcely less importance than that in American History as a prepara- 
tion for intelligent citizenship, It must be obvious to every thinking 
man that the destinies of our country are no longer separable from 
those of Europe and that, whether or not we enter upon any sort of 
formal compact with the nations of Europe, we are ‘virtually com- 
pelled-to take a more active part in the settlement of world affairs. 
Granting this, it appears to be almost imperative that we give 
students in our high schools a chance to acquire at least a rudi- 
mentary knowledge and understanding of the nations of Europe 
today—their political institutions, characteristics, ideals, and 
problems, 
As the course is in process of being presented for the first 
time, it seems unprofitable to enter very deeply into the question of 
method, which is necessarily merely tentative and as yet. untested by 
results. It may be in order, however, to point out certain objectives 
that are aimed at in the presentation. 
Chief among these, in fact the central topic of the course, is 
the study of the rise of democratic ideas and the reception accorded 
them in the different states. Other objectives aimed at are: 
1. To put the student in touch with world affairs today through 
a study of the individual nations during the past two centuries; 
2. To bring home to the student that it vitally concerns him 
as a. future citizen of a world power to know what the relations of 
the other nations are with one another and with his own country, 
and what factors might bring about a change in those relations. 
3. To point out some of the tremendous social and economic 
problems that originated with the universal introduction of machinery 
and have not yet been solved. 
4. To begin to cultivate in the student the habit of. detached

judgment, that he may be able to discount partisan praise or blame, 
‘and estimate specious propaganda at its true value. 
The members of the class taking the course this year had in 
“general a background of two years of history, Ancient and American, 
only two members having studied Medieval History, It seemed 
advisable, therefore, to devote the first two weeks to a rapid survey 
of Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire to the end of. the 
17th Century. This was done largely through reports on special: 
topics by individual. students, the thread of the narrative being 
supplied by talks connecting the various topics, With this pre- 
liminary survey out of the way, a textbook was taken up (Robinson 
and Beard: History of Europe--Our Own Times), 
The text usually furnishes only enough material on any given 
topic to introduce the subject and leave with the reader some 
unafiswered questions, These form the basis of class discussions, 
or if further information is needed, of collateral readings from- 
various sources. In scope the course covers the period from about 
1660 to the present day. The periods or topics particularly empha- 
.sized are: - 
_ Absolutism in the 18th Century; the Great Powers of Europe, 
their origin and development.   
Conditions of life of the people. 
The Intellectual Revolution, : 
The French Revolution, Beginnings of democracy, 
The Napoleonic Era and its results in Europe.

AMERICAN HISTORY 
In teaching, as in so many other pursuits, it is a condition, not 
a theory, that confronts us. The size of the class, the mental quality 
of the pupils, the number and length of the periods, the pressure of 
other work on the students, these are some of the obstinate facts 
that oppose themselves to the hopes, desires, and aims of the teacher. 
He is obliged to let “J should like to” wait upon “I don’t see how 
it can be done.” Eventually experience teaches the teacher that it 
is best to select among all the things he would like to accomplish 
that course which seems adapted to meet the greatest need of his. 
pupils, or what he conceives to: be such, ‘Fortunately, however, 
most of the pupils, through their study’ of important phases of 
American history in the fifth, sixth, and eighth grades, have con- 
siderable background. Although their factual knowledge has become 
dimmed, their appreciative intelligence remains, so that the study 
of the period of exploration, the colonial period, and the develop- 
ment of slavery is much facilitated. Many considerations have led 
me to concentrate on what I have come to recognize as the chief 
need of the pupils, namely, training in intelligent and effective 
reading of the history textbook. Even high school juniors and 
seniors do not know how to get the pith of what they read; they 
do not discriminate between the important and the incidental; their 
knowledge sprawls. If they are to be equipped, therefore, for 
college work in history and for intelligent acquisition of knowledge 
later in life, they must learn how to read with their minds as well 
as with their eyes. 
So it comes about that the course in American History is not 
a “joyous adventure” but rather a plodding march along the beaten 
road, Every lesson is a lesson in selection and organization, and 
in accuracy of statement. It would not be correct, however, to 
infer that our study is merely a dull routine of logical analysis, No 
visitor to the class would think so, I am sure. For, once the lesson 
has been dissected, so to speak, the work of vivifying begins—and 
it continues to the end of the period, In other words, every lesson 
has its luminous points, its really significant facts, and it is upon 
these that all the emphasis is placed. It is on such portions of the 
lesson that the teacher would like to send his pupils in search of 
193
-P-A-G-E-194
194 Socrat ScreNCE SERIES 
deeper knowledge, and it is just here that the obstinate “conditions” 
. already referred to prevent research, 
The subject matter in most recent high school history texts is 
well organized, so that the pupil has constantly before him a good 
example of thought logically arranged and presented ; and our first 
business is to study the table of contents, not only in order to com- 
prehend the scope of our study but also to get a glimmer of “first 
principles” as to method. It will be quite a while, however, before 
this prefatory gleam becomes bright enough to guide the pupil in 
his daily study. Except for real students, the process of learning 
is a slow one, “0 
After this preliminary view, the pupils are usually permitted 
to decide at what point of the story of American history they will 
begin, There is no compelling reason, in my judgment, for not 
taking up the story at the beginning of our life as a nation, or at . 
the War of Independence, especially as most of the class have had 
‘ elementary school instruction in the colonial period. Generally, the 
class decides to begin at the first page of the book. Of course, 
when they decide otherwise, we eventually * ‘make up” the omitted 
portions of the story. 
From the first lesson, the pupil is taught to ask himself, “What 
is the lesson about?” ‘And to believe that there is a simple, single’ 
answer to that question; that it isn’t about a lot of things; that the 
“lot of things” which he finds in the pages he has read are merely 
contributory to the actual subject of the lesson, just as all the infor- 
mation he finds in the entire textbook is merely facts (or so the 
author judges them-to be) about American History. If the student 
discovers any subject-matter in the lesson that does not contribute 
to the one single simple theme, then he has found a defect in the 
text of his author; for every properly written school book is a piece 
of organized knowledge, and organized knowledge means knowledge 
logically arranged.. The author frankly reveals his own conception 
of what he is writing about by. the captions he gives the several parts, 
chapters, sections of the book; but for the sake of picturesqueness 
or vividness, or some other reason known to himself only, he often 
uses topical expressions instead of plain statements. Our object is 
to find definite, unadorned statements, for much vagueness of knowl- 
edge can be concealed in metaphors. Now it may seem that this 
approach to our subject would be fatal to interest in historical
-P-A-G-E-195
Tue Course in History 195 
knowledge; but the fact is that it usually generates zest for what 
follows. That it is of advantage in compelling the student to bring 
_before his mind every part of the lesson is obvious. : 
When once we have decided what the lesson is about, we set 
about explaining, clarifying, vivifying the main matter. Sometimes 
(not often) we are able to clear this up and “get it out of the way” 
quickly, so that there is time left for minor points of interest. 
Sometimes the class is put to work. writing “the essential facts” 
about the lesson. The reading of these papers frequently leads to 
sharp, not to say violent, differences of opinion as to the “essential” 
naturé of the facts. In general, the “method of instruction” is a 
combination of recitation and open forum, with the forum very 
much on top. As in the Medieval History classes, reviews (looking 
backward) and surveys (views ahead) are frequent; and whenever 
we complete a unit of the story we undergo a written test, which 
usually reveals to the teacher the defects of his method, and to the 
pupils the inadequacy of their attainment. It is therefore good 
discipline for both. 
In regard to subject-matter, our purpose is to put into the minds 
of the pupils a coherent view of the story of our national life without 
emphasizing any particular aspect, unless it be the political. We do 
not disregard the industrial or the social developments, nor do we 
stress them; we leave them for further consideration in the latter 
part of the year when we study civics. So far at least, it has seemed 
more useful to the large majority of pupils that they should have a 
clear picture of the entire course of our history than that they should 
look at it from half a dozen points of view. They are still pretty 
young, and most of them will go to college, where they will be likely 
to gain more intensive knowledge of the different Phases of the 
subject. : 
- The main emphasis of the course is placed on half a dozen or 
more clearly defined “epochs”: The Revolution, its causes, events 
and results ; the “Critical Period,” when the fortunes of the Republic 
were in the balance; the first. quarter-century, when the French 
_Revolution and the subsequent wars were a continual menace to the 
country; the short period of national enthusiasm and harmony that 
were soon followed by the long struggle over slavery, culminating 
‘in the Civil War ; the remarkable social, economic, and political revo- 
lution in the ’30’s; the Civil War-in its political and economic and

social aspects; and finally the great modern period of industrial 
expansion that has involved us in new and difficult and unending 
problems. It is these outstanding features of American progress 
that make up our year’s work, 
Our work in Civics has taken varied forms, no one of which 
has proved satisfactory. The shortness of the time has necessitated 
prudent picking and choosing among the topics before us. The 
character of the class also has had somewhat to do with the selection. 
We have sometimes devoted much of the two months (the average 
time given to the subject) to the federal constitution. Once’ we 
made a study of state and local government. The last two years 
we have been emphasizing the economic aspect of history. All these 
matters are useful, even necessary, parts of a high school student’s 
equipment for citizenship, but no one need be told that a far greater 
allotment of time must be made if the knowledge gained is to sink 
very deep into the student’s mind. The solution of the problem is 
probably a merging of history and civics and economics into one 
course of study, but I believe that such a course should be preceded 
by a rapid, comprehensive view of the entire field, such as can be 
got only by a somewhat old-fashioned study of a good textbook. 
Tn any case, the work cannot be done adequately unless more time is 
given to the subject.

of a Play; Music in the School Community; Original Composition in 
Music; The School Print Shop; Printing in the Seventh Grade; Care

Volume II) The Morning Exercise as a Socializing Influence. . 
In Volume II, the use of the social motive is further illustrated by 
articles describing exercises given in the daily school assemblies. They 
show how classroom work in science, mathematics, geography, literature, 
art, etc,, bas been utilized. Some exercises are reported verbatim, while 
in others the method of preparation is described. A classified list of 
typical morning exercises is given. : 
Volume III. Expression as a Means of Training Motive. . 
This volume deals with the place of. expression in education. It 
contains an article on the theory of expression, and other articles 
as follows: Play as Fundamental in Education; Oral Reading; The 
Value, Place, and Use of -the Dramatic Instinct in the Education of 
Young People; Imaginative Writing; Clay Modeling; Metal Working; 
Making a Rug; The Social Application of Painting and Drawing. 
. Volume IV. Education Through Concrete Expression. 
. The articles in this volume show how the school provides opportunity 
for the pupils to gain adequate mental imagery as a basis of study, 
through individual activity and observation, and through personal contact 
with actual materials. They also show how, through constructive activ- 
ities and projects connected with the school life of the pupil, the applica- 
tion of knowledge gained is demanded. The work of many grades and 
departments is represented, accompanied by many illustrations. 
Volume V. The Course in Science. 
This volume presents the science of both the elementary and high 
school. Following a statement of the general principles controlling: the 
selection .of material and its organization, the work of each grade and 
high school course is presented separately and completely. Subject matter 
is fully outlined, including much experimental work, methods ‘of presenta- 
tation are indicated, and the outcome is made clear by representative pieces 
. of children’s: work. An attempt is made throughout the volume to show 
how the work in science may be based entirely upon the interests, activ- - 
ities, and problems of the pupil. Lists of reference books are included 
and there are numerous illistrations. 
*The first five volumes were published as Year Books.

Volume VI. The Individual and. the Curriculum. . 
An account of a year’s trial of the Individual Project Method 
in the Seventh Grade is given in this book. The basic problems and 
also the detail of the daily work of this radical experiment are 
fully explained. Other articles picture the more usual class group 
doing independent or correlated work in almost every type of subject 
matter, from the freest art expression to the most practical of prob- 
Jems. Still others show the school community organized to ‘meet 
certain social emergencies of its own and of the world at large.

    OST of these stories 
of Paul Binge hae been collected from loggers in Washing- 
ton, Oregon, and British Columbia, many of whom, of course, 
fisne followed the logging industry from the East, and have 
brought with them the stories as they were told in Canada, 
Michigan, and the middle-western logging section. In the 
camps these stories are usually told in competition, and some 
liberties, therefore, have been taken in arranging them in the 
form of a continuous narrative told by one logger;\ but I have 
tried always to keep as close to the originals as possilile and 
substantially the stories are just as the men in the camps tell 
them. 
J he Paul Bunyan legend centers around a mythical hero of 
the woods, a kind of superlumberjack, who is noted for his 
wonderful deeds of cleverness and skill when some quick ex- 
pedient is necessary and for the extraordinary size of his log- ging operations. Paul is never “stumped”? and no job is ever 
too big or too hard for him and his Big Blue Ox to handle. The 
story of his deeds is really epic in its sweep and immensity, 
and his field of action covers practically all of America where 
the great forests have been. 
It is rather difficult to say where these stories of Paul Bun- 
ora
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii ‘ INTRODUCTION 
yan began. Some evidence points to a French-Canadian origin 
among the loggers of Quebec or northern Ontario, who may 
even have brought them from the old country. But other evi- 
dences point just as strongly to an American beginning, possi- 
bly in Michigan or Wisconsin. Certainly the stories resemble 
those other frontier stories which were told in that time, back 
in the 30’s and 40’s, when western humor was at its height 
and when the most extravagant tales circulated, such, for in- 
stance, as those stories which were told of Davy Crockett. It 
is likely that part of this stream of western humor which filled 
such a large part of the literature of those early days, crowded 
out of the main channel by the excitement of the Civil War 
time, may have found its outlet in the logging camps in the 
great Northern Woods and turned itself naturally into the 
Paul Bunyan legends. Many of the tall tales of the early fron- 
tier have been taken over bodily and made into Paul Bunyan 
arns. 
The stories traveled westward as the logging industry trav- 
led westward, and they seem to have been transformed to 
a considerable extent on the way..In the Minnesota camps, 
where the Scandinavian loggers were numerous, they were un- 
doubtedly enriched by Scandinavian myth, and there Paul 
Bunyan assumed some of the characteristics of a modern Thor. 
Farther West the stories seem to have taken on a little coloring 
from local Indian legends. Just within the last few years a 
_ few of them have found their way into print, and advertising 
\ men of the large timber firms have used them in their litera- 
ture with some freedom and often very skillfully. There are 
also some newer stories which branch out into other industries 
than that of logging. 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
INTRODUCTION xiii 
\In the old days when the stories were told around the com- 
boose from the deacon seat there were men who could tell 
Paul Bunyan yarns evening after evening for weeks together 
and never repeat themselves, but now with the new conditions 
in the camps, with the advent of the story magazines and polit- 
ical tracts, and the newly awakened economic consciousness of 
the men, the center of interest has shifted, and the Paul Bun- 
yan legends seem to be going into the discard, and there is some 
danger of their being allowed to die out.\The oldest of the 
stories date back at least to the 1860’s and perhaps even earlier, 
and they seem to have been at their height in the 80’s and go’s.» 
/The name “Paul Bunyan” in the camps (Bunyon it is spelled 
in the East and Bunion the French have it) has several differ- 
ent connotations. Sometimes it is merely a tag on which to hang 
a practical joke, sometimes it is the name of some particularly 
clumsy or awkward fellow among the loggers or some ineffi- 
cient or particularly unpopular boss, and again sometimes it is 
the nickname given to some especially clever or skillful work- 
man; but generally it refers to this mythical figure, Paul, who 
is the hero of the great adventures. 
The teller almost always claims actual acquaintance with 
Paul. He “worked for him on the Big Onion,” or “was with 
him the spring of the Round Drive,” or “had a brother who 
drove the saleratus wagon for Paul,” or “spent a winter in 
Paul’s camp the year he logged three weeks this side of Que- 
bec,” or “used to court Paul’s daughter Teeny,” or “was one 
of the two thousand filers in Paul’s shingle-mill,” or some- 
thing else equally substantiating. The stories are always told 
in perfect seriousness and there is sometimes a regular “code” 
which the narrator has to follow. He must tell the “truth.”
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  xiv INTRODUCTION 
For example: the dog that Paul Bunyan kept in his camp was 
not to feed the swampers to in the spring in order to get out of 
paying them wages, but to feed the watch peddlers, tailors’ 
agents and camp inspectors to. And Paul Bunyan’s Ox did not 
measure 42 axhandles between the eyes, but 42 axhandles and 
a tobacco box—“you could easy fit in a Star tobacco box after 
the last axhandle.” The figures and dimensions given in the 
stories often vary with the audience. Usually the narrator 
“Jays on all the traffic will bear,” and whether a bridge is to be 
14 or 400 feet wide depends somewhat on the character of the 
person to whom the story is told. Very generally the stories 
contain some sly irony or humor at the expense of the “boss.” 
{An obvious use of the stories is, naturally, to string the ten- 
derfoot or to put a smart-Alec in his proper place. If someone 
comes to camp who brags of the big logs they took out in the 
camp where he last worked it is not long before he is “taken 
down a peg” by a Paul Bunyan yarn, and the greenhorn has 
always to be put through a number of practical jokes. The 
logging industry, of course, is not unique in this respect. Al- 
most every industry has its own peculiar trade stories and its 
stock practical jokes to pull off on the uninitiated. If it isn’t 
the hodag and the crosshaul it is the left-handed monkey- 
wrench or the red oil to fill the red lantern on the caboose. . 
The stories in this volume have been selected from a great 
number and do not include stories which are too technical or 
too closely tied up with some small geographic detail to be of 
general interest, and stories which in my opinion seemed to be 
too new or too far outside the pale really to belong to the Paul 
Bunyan cycle. Where there have been several versions of the 
same story the one which seemed the most interesting has been
-P-A-G-E-15

chosen or the one which best fitted into the plan of the book. 
Since the stories are so numerous, I am sure there must be a 
great many that I have not heard, and I should be glad to have 
any such stories sent to me. The Paul Bunyan legend, the 
unique contribution of the American frontier to the world’s 
folk-lore, certainly deserves to be preserved. = Cle)

   PAUL’S CRADLE 
’ ane ~ ee WHAT they say is true 
Paul. Burgen was born Aamo in Maine! And he must of been 
a pretty husky baby too, just like you’d expect him to be, from 
knowin’ him afterwards. 
When he was only three weeks old he rolled around so 
much in his sleep that he knocked down four square miles of 
standin’ timber and the goverment got after his folks and 
told ’em they’d have to move him away. 
So then they got some timbers together and made a floatin’ 
cradle for Paul and anchored it off Eastport, but every time 
Paul rocked in his cradle, if he rocked shoreward, it made 
such a swell it come near drownin’ out all the villages on 
the coast of Maine, and the waves was so high Nova Scotia 
come pretty near becomin’ an island instead of a peninsula. 
And so that wouldn’t do, of course, and the goverment  
-P-A-G-E-18
  2 PAUL BUNYAN 
got after ’em again and told ’em they’d have to do somethin’ 
about it. They’d have to move him out of there and put him 
somewheres else, they was told, and so they figgured they’d 
better take him home again and keep him in the house for a 
spell. 
But it happened Paul was asleep in his cradle when they 
went to get him, and they had to send for the British navy 
and it took seven hours of bombardin’ to wake him up. And 
then when Paul stepped out of his cradle it made such a swell 
it caused a seventy-five foot tide in the Bay of Fundy and 
several villages was swept away and seven of the invincible 
English warships was sunk to the bottom of the sea. 
Well, Paul got out of his cradle then, and that saved Nova 
Scotia from becomin’ an island, but the tides in the Bay of 
Fundy is just as high as they ever was. 
And so I guess the old folks must of had their hands full 
with him all right. And I ought to say, the king of England 
sent over and confiscated the timbers in Paul’s cradle and 
built seven new warships to take the place of the ones he’d 
lost. 
When Paul was only seven months old he sawed off the 
legs from under his dad’s bed one night. 
The old man noticed when he woke up in the mornin’ that 
his bed seemed considerable lower than it used to be, and so 
he got up and investigated, and, sure enough, there was the 
legs all sawed off from under it and the pieces layin’ out 
on the floor. 
And then he remembered he’d felt somethin’ the night 
before, but he’d thought he must be dreamin’—the way you 
do dream that you’re fallin’? down sometimes when you first

go off to sleep. 
And he looked around to see who could of done it and 
there was Paul layin’ there sound asleep with his dad’s cross- 
cut saw still held tight in his fist and smilin’ in his sleep as 
pretty as anythin’. 
And he called his wife and when she come in he says to 
her: 
‘Did you feel anythin’ in the night?” he says. 
“No,”? she says. “Is anythin’ wrong?” 
“Well, just look here,” he says. And he showed her the 
four-by-eights layin’ there on the floor and the saw in the 
kid’s hand. 
“J didn’t light the lamp when I went to get up this 
mornin’,” she says, “and I guess I didn’t notice it.” 
“Well, it’s Paul’s done it,” the old man says. “And [ll 
bet that boy of ourn is goin’ to be a great logger some day. 
If he lives to grow up he’s goin’ to do some great loggin’ by 
and by, you just see—a whole lot bigger than any of the 
men around here has ever done.” 
And they was right, all right. There ain’t never been 
loggin’ before nor since like Paul Bunyan done. 
And then they tell another story about Paul when he was 
a little kid too that’s pretty good, about how he killed some 
wild animals one day. 
Paul was out crawlin’ one time, before he’d learned to 
walk yet, out in his father’s clearin—about forty acres or so 
around the house till you got to the edge of the timber. His 
ma wasn’t watchin’ him very close and it wasn’t long before 
Paul was right up to the edge of them woods. Among other 
things that he’d picked up and was holdin’ in his hand was
-P-A-G-E-22
  6 PAUL BUNYAN 
a long pole that his father’d used for a leever for grubbin’ 
stumps; for Paul’d been crawlin’ around, like babies will, 
pickin’ round in things, and playin’ in the grass and stumps, 
and just pickin’ up and holdin’ onto almost anythin’ that 
happened to come handy. 
And, like I said, he’d got right out to the edge of them 
woods, and was holdin’ onto that pole he had. 
The woods them days was full of all kinds of wild animals 
—bears, wolves, cougars, snakes, coons, moose, and all kinds 
of things, and there was lots of ’em too and they wasn’t, afraid 
of nothin’. With so few people around they wasn’t no more 
afraid of men than they was of anything else. 
And so when Paul was sittin’ there with his pole like that, 
the first thing that come onto him was a big moose that some 
hunter’d taken a shot at and hurt him, but hadn’t killed him, 
but just made him awful mad, and of course he was goin’ to 
go right on the boy, because a moose when he’s been hurt 
that way just tries to kill the first human he sees after that, 
and he was makin’ right straight for Paul with his horns 
down. 
But Paul happened to be holdin’ the pole out and what 
happened was, the moose run right onto that and split him- 
self clean through from stem to stern and stuck on the pole 
so that just his little tail was layin’ out behind along the pole, 
and of course, pinned tight that way, he couldn’t hurt Paul 
none. 
And then next a cougar come along and he was goin’ to 
make a spring for the kid, I guess, but midway he got his 
claws and tail all tangled up in the moose’s horns and was 
held tight in his place. 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  
PAUL’S CRADLE U, 
Well, then comes a timber wolf. He was goin’ to try to 
sneak around the cougar and get at Paul, but the cougar 
wasn’t dead yet and took a bite in his neck and got lock-jaw 
and couldn’t let go, and so the wolf was settled for. 
And then next to come was a coon. 
He must of come paddin’ along the pole expectin’ to jump 
over the heads of the others, I spose, and get at Paul that 
way. He must of had his tail hangin’ down and been just at 
the end of the pole, and the way it looked afterwards Paul 
must of give the pole a poke about that time, for when they 
found ’em [ll be blamed if the pole hadn’t gone through 
every ring of the coon’s tail and hadn’t missed a one and was 
holdin’ him fast, or just about—a bull-snake had got himself 
tied around the end of the pole to keep any of the rings from 
slippin’ off. 
And so when his ma found him, there he was, sittin’ on 
the ground with all them critters squirmin’ on the stick in 
his hand. 
“Goo, goo!” he says, and kind of grunted—like as if he 
was tryin’ to tell her that the mess of em was too heavy for 
him to crawl back to the house and carry it with him, or 
otherwise he would of been in before now to get his supper. 
Course it never occurred to him that he might of let go— 
babies always holds onto things so—and then maybe he was — 
afraid that the snake might get untied again if he let go the 
pole and the coon and the other ones might slip off. 
Anyway he was holdin’ onto it good and tight and had ’em 
all safe. 
Tom Larkin told this story, I remember, one night when 
we was all spinnin’ yarns, just after somebody else had just
-P-A-G-E-24
8 PAUL BUNYAN 
told one about some other kid, and Tom’s story sure made 
the first fellow’s story look pretty sick, I can tell you. And I 
don’t doubt but what Tom had the facts, though he didn’t 
say just where this happened, whether it was in Maine or 
some other place where Paul was livin’ at the time. 
Paul Bunyan always seemed like a real Michigan man to 
me, and I never could get used to his bein’ born back in 
Maine; but it always seemed to me as if he should of been 
born and raised right there in Michigan. But I spose maybe 
that’s because I first went to work for him there, and that’s 
where I knowed him first, and it always seemed to me as if 
he belonged there. But that ain’t nothin’, of course. He’d 
logged for a good many winters before I met him, one season 
on the Porcupine, I know, and the followin’ winter three 
weeks this side of Quebec. And he logged on the Ottawa 
after I went to work for him, and some say he’d been there 
before, when he first started out, and that that’s where he 
come from the very first—started in loggin’ in some French 
settlement up there. I don’t know. The story about that he 
was born down in Maine a man from Maine himself told 
me. McDowell his name was. Him and his son was both of 
em in camp together, same time I was, and same camp for a 
good many years, in the old days. It was the young fellow 
told me the story about Paul. The old man used to wear a 
red check mackinaw, I remember, and had awful heavy eye- 
brows—about the thickest I ever seen—long and bushy, that 
stood straight out, and used to get full of frost in the winter. 
Fine old chap he was, though. 
They used to tell how Paul went to school part of a day 
when he was a kid, back in Maine. His father and mother  
-P-A-G-E-25
  
PAUL’S CRADLE 9 
got him a slate—cleaved out of a mountain-side in Vermont 
—and a pencil imported from Germany that would be big 
enough for him, and then they sent him to school to learn 
to read, and write, and cipher. The schoolmaster was an old 
man whose mother lived to be over a hundred years old. 
Well, the first thing the teacher started Paul in on was to 
write the figgurs, “1, 2, 3, 4,” on his slate, and Paul grabbed 
his slate pencil and went to work. 
He was tryin’ his best to make the curlycues just right, 
but the figgurs was so big that all the lines looked straight to 
the old man, who couldn’t only see but part of ’em at a time. 
And so he got mad at Paul, and I don’t know what he was 
goin’ to try to do to him, but anyway Paul picked him up 
and throwed him in the stove—it was one of them big ones 
they used to have in the middle of the room in them old-time 
schoolhouses. 
And then Paul started for the door. But he tripped on the 
stove and knocked it over, and the stove-door come open, and 
the old man got out, and took after Paul. 
Well, Paul kept a-goin’ up the road as hard as he could 
leg it with his breath comin’ out in puffs like the exhaust of 
an ocean liner and freezin’ all around him—for it was a cold 
November day. He’d left the old schoolmaster miles behind 
at the start, but he was goin’ so hard he couldn’t stop, and 
kept right on goin’ over hill and down dale, like they say 
in the song, till he got pretty near to the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence. 
Then he stopped, and quit puffin’ so hard, but them frost 
breaths of his that froze trailin’ behind him that cold Novem- 
ber day is still hangin’ round the Maine coast. Sometimes
-P-A-G-E-26
10 PAUL BUNYAN 
they get out to sea and then they’re called fog, and they 
hang around the big icebergs, and the big ships get lost in 
?em and get on the rocks and ice, like the Titanic done. 
Of course Paul was big for his age, but he wasn’t clumsy 
like some big boys. He was so quick he could catch a squirrel 
on the frame of a barn, or he could stand in the middle of 
the floor and jump and plant both feet flat on the ceilin’, 
and some of the old Maine loggers tell how he could blow 
out the bunkhouse light and get in his bunk before it was 
dark. 
And at loggin’ he was A-1 right from the start, I guess, for 
they say he cut his teeth on a peavey and drove logs down 
the Kennebec in his first pair of pants. He went to work for 
his uncle up in Ontario when he was still just a kid, and 
because he was so much quicker and bigger and stronger than 
any of the men even then, they used to give him several jobs 
that nobody else in camp could do.'One job he had was day- 
breaker. The cook used to send him up in the Blue Mountains 
with an ax to break day and Paul was so quick he could 
always get his job done and get back to camp and call the 
men to breakfast long before the daylight got there. And 
another job he had was blowin’ the dinnerhorn for the cook. 
When Paul’d blow, the noise was always so loud the men 
could ride in out of the woods on the echo. 
I ain’t never surprised to hear anythin’ like that about 
Paul when he was a kid from them that knowed him then, 
for I know he must of been a great kid to grow to be the kind 
of logger he was. And he was a great logger, that’s sure— 
and I guess there ain’t nobody pretends there ever was any- 
body like him.
-P-A-G-E-27
PAUL’S CRADLE 11 
  I remember in the old time when we used to be gettin’ 
out squared timbers for the British trade how Paul used to 
go out a half mile in the woods and begin squarin’ the 
trees up. 
Four cuts was all Paul ever made to a tree—one on each 
side and it was done. And he’d work a half hour or so, and 
then when he’d get ’em all standin’ like that clean and white, 
he’d get his ax on the wove grass handle and swing it around 
and cut ’em all down, a third of an acre at a time, and hitch 
the Blue Ox to ’em and snake ’em down to the river, and 
they’d float away, a raft fourteen miles long of clean, white 
timbers. Course squared timbers always floats on their edge, 
and that made it a plaguy hard job to stick on em when we
-P-A-G-E-28
  12 PAUL BUNYAN 
had to drive ’em down the river, the way we used to, down 
the Ottawa in the old time. The British buyers was mighty 
partikkelar and didn’t want ’em marked up with shoe calks 
nor nothin’, but Paul knowed what to do about that all right. 
What he done was, he just had the calks took out of the 
men’s shoes and put in the timbers instead, and got wooden 
shoes for the men to wear on the drive, and that way they 
never got ’em cut up so bad. 
I logged for Paul for a good many years, and it was fine 
loggin’ too them old times. Not like it is now. When the 
trees used to be standin’ tall and thick so that the only way 
you could look was straight up, and all you could see was a 
- little patch of blue right above you, and all you could smell 
was the smell of the firs and balsam and pine around you, 
and all you could hear was the squirrels and chickadees, and 
the scrape of the lumberjacks’ saws and the bite of their 
axes. That was fine loggin’. Not like the measly little stump 
tracts we got here now to log, with small scraggly trees and 
lonesome-lookin’ burnt trunks standin’ around. You can’t log 
in that there kind of country.

THE CAMP 
ey ON ES 
THE BIG ONION 
y ASSNHE time I first went to work 
for Paul was aie winter he was loggin’ on the Big Onion. 
I'd been workin’ for old man Gilroy for a good many 
winters and then finally when he went broke, I thought here’s 
my chance to go to work for Paul. I’d been hearin’ about 
him, of course, for he’d been loggin’ on Smith’s Neck, down 
Lake Erie way, a year or two before that and on the Little 
Gimlet where it empties into the Big Auger, and so when 
I heard he was up on the Big Onion that fall I went up 
there to go to work for him—there wasn’t hardly a logger 
in Michigan but what was workin’ for Paul that winter. The 
only job Paul had to give me was helper to the stable-boss 
to start with, for the first couple of months, but then after- 
wards I was one of the regular fallers. 
It was sure a tough job, that first job I had, and I never
-P-A-G-E-30
  14 PAUL BUNYAN 
wanted it again, for Bill, of course, like always, was takin’ 
care of the Blue Ox; and he was an awful animal to take 
care of. It seems sometimes we was out pretty near all night 
workin’ away with that critter, for naturally I was supposed 
to be helpin’ Bill, though he didn’t really want me and kind 
of told Paul so after a while, I guess, and so Paul put me 
on with the woods gang. But then, even if it was tough, bein’ 
out early that way give me the chance to see the men comin’ 
down for their hotcakes in the mornin’, and I guess maybe 
that was worth somethin-—I know I wouldn’t of missed it 
for a good deal. And then it give me the chance to get ac- 
quainted a little bit with Babe too, and kind of give me the 
run of things at camp. 
Paul’s camp was so big it was kind of hard forme to 
get used to it at first—for I hadn’t had no experience with 
loggin’ on that kind of a scale—till after a while I kind of 
learned to find my way around between the buildin’s and 
-teamstéfs and cattle and cooks and everybody. 
The number of men in Paul’s camp was never correctly 
counted that I know of, for there was always too many 
there, and too many goin’ out and comin’ in all the time 
for anyone ever to be able to count ’em. But one time Paul 
made a kind of an estimate for a report he had to make to 
the goverment. They’d asked for figgurs and he said he’d 
try to get ’em for’em. 
So then he told the chief clerk to count ’em up but after 
he’d been tryin’ for a couple of weeks, runnin’ around all 
over, Johnny come back and told him it couldn’t be done. 
“There’s too many goin’ and comin’ all the time,” he says. 
“Well, count the cattle, then,” Paul says. “I know there’s
-P-A-G-E-31
WAT ner eT eA 
THE CAMP ON THE BIG ONION 15 
about five men for every yoke of cattle. That’s what I always 
figgur on anyway. You can give ’em the report on that.” 
And, “Go on,” he says to Windy, who was turnin’ the 
grindstone for him that day, behind the cook-house, where 
he was sharpenin’ up his ax. 
But Johnny didn’t have no better luck countin’ the cattle, 
for they was goin’ and comin’ too, and there was a lot of 
em and some of ’em was always bein’ killed off for the cook 
every meal and new ones comin’ in from the stockyards. 
And so in a couple of days he come up to Paul again 
and he says, “I can’t count ’em, Paul.” 
That time Paul was just startin’ down the road with the 
Blue Ox to take some logs down to the landin’, and I know 
he didn’t like to stop, but he did, though, for just a minute. 
“Whoa, Babe!” he hollers. 
“T tell you what,” he says to Johnny, “pile up the yokes 
and measure ’em, and figgur from that. It won’t be just 
exactly right, but it’l] have to do. We can’t waste any plaguy 
more time with it. We got loggin’ to do.” And he went on 
down the road. 
And so Johnny, the chief clerk, got the straw boss and 
some of the rest of us to help him, and we went out there 
and piled the yokes up, and when we got it done we measured 
em and found we had just exactly three hundred and seventy 
cords. Figgurin’ so many to the cord, and then five men to 
each yoke, like Paul had said, Johnny could make up the 
figgurs that was sent in to the goverment. 
But of course then that was countin’ only about one-third 
of ’em. In Paul’s camp was where the three-shift system was 
invented, and so we always had one shift in camp, one goin’
-P-A-G-E-32
a 16 PAUL BUNYAN 
out to work and one out in the woods, and by measurin’ the 
yokes that way you couldn’t only get but one-third of ’em 
at a time, naturally. 
That first fall I was workin’ for Paul was when he got 
the big hotcake griddle. Always in the woods in them days 
the boys was mighty fond of hotcakes—just like men are 
pretty generally anywheres, I guess—and if there was any- 
thing could be said for Paul it was that he tried to treat 
his men right. And so, naturally, he wanted ’em to have 
hotcakes if there was any way he could fix it, and then besides, 
the way he ate ’em afterwards, he was more’n a little fond 
of ’em himself. 
Well, in camp before that they hadn’t never had hotcakes, 
because they didn’t have no griddle big enough to cook ’em 
on, and no stove they could of put the griddle on if they’d 
of had it anyway, and so what they had for breakfast before 
that and what they was havin’? when I went to work for 
Paul was just sourdough biscuits. And even so the cook used 
to have to get up twenty-six hours before daylight to get the 
biscuits cooked in time because all he had to cook ’em on 
was one of them there drumhead stoves they used to have and 
he couldn’t only cook but sixty-four drippin’ pans full at a 
time. 
But that year Paul made up his mind he was goin’ to have 
hotcakes for the men and he was goin’ to have a griddle big 
enough to cook ’em on. And so he went down to the plow- 
works at Moline, Illinois, and contracted for ’em to make 
him one to suit him. 
The steel that went into this griddle of Paul’s was what 
would of gone into two hundred and sixty breakin’ plows,

  AND HERE SHE COME, ROLLIN’ RIGHT ALONG
-P-A-G-E-34

-P-A-G-E-35
THE CAMP ON THE BIG ONION 19 
and when it was done finally, it measured two hundred and 
thirty-five foot across. 
And then the men at the plow-works, of course, didn’t 
have no way to ship it up to Paul and they was out there in 
the yard at the works figgurin’ on how they could build some 
side-tracks and put several flatcars alongside each other and 
try to ship it up on them, when Paul happened to come along 
to see if his griddle wasn’t finished yet. 
“Never mind that,” he says to the men when he seen ’em 
out there. “Never mind tryin’ to build any extra tracks. We 
couldn’t never get enough cars anyway, I don’t believe. [Il 
just raise ’er up on edge and hitch my Blue Ox to ’er, and 
she’ll roll right along.” 
And so after they’d got out of the way he raised ’er up, 
and hitched on, and started right out for home. 
And when he come to within four or five miles of the 
camp, like he’d calculated it out beforehand, I guess, he just 
unhitched the Blue Ox and let the griddle spin on by itself. 
And here she come, rollin’ right along. And when she got to 
just the right place, where he’d figgured to place her, she 
begun to spin round and round like spin-the-plate at a play- 
party and dug a nice big hole for the fire to go in under it, 
and settled right down and was all ready to go. 
Paul had the bull-cooks pile in an acre or two of brush 
for a good fire, and him and Ole the Blacksmith rigged up 
a tank for the cook to make his batter in and a flume with a 
stop-cock in it, so’s he could run it out onto the griddle and 
then shut it off whenever he had enough. Paul got flunkies 
with slabs of bacon strapped to their feet to skate around on 
the griddle to keep it greased, and a chicken wire fence all
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 PAUL BUNYAN 
around for ’em to climb up on when the batter come in too 
thick. We rigged up a kind of block and tackle arrangement 
to haul the hotcake off with when it was done—that’s on that 
first griddle. Afterwards, like in the camp in North Dakota, 
Paul, of course, always had donkey engines. 
There was four hundred bull-cooks bringin’ in the spruce- 
boughs for the bunks in the big bunkhouse at that first camp 
I was in; it had eighty tiers of bunks, most of ?em muzzle 
loaders but the two bottom layers, they was sidewinders. And 
the men used to go to bed in balloons at night and come down 
in parachutes in the mornin’. 
A pretty sight it used to be to watch ’em comin’ down. 
“R-o-00-00l out! Daylight in the swamp!” one of the 
cookees would yell, and then in a minute or two they'd all 
be rollin’ out of their blankets, and the parachutes would 
open and they’d all come sailin’ down. It sure was a pretty 
sight—about as fine a show as I ever laid eyes on. 
Sometimes in the mornin’ I used to stop at the door of the 
bunkhouse, on my way from the barn, to watch ’em. For Bill 
and I generally used to be on our way in to breakfast about 
that time, and Bill’d sometimes take the time to stop for a 
minute or so. 
“T like to see em,” he’d say to me. “Angus, that’s a mighty 
fine show. They come faster now than they used to when it 
was just for sourdough biscuits. But we’ll have to hustle along 
and get our hotcakes. We got to get back to the Ox.” 
That spring on the Big Onion we had an awful lot of 
trouble with the garlic that growed there where Garlic Crick 
joins the Big Onion River—a kind of V-shaped tract in there 
along the loggin’ road, that was just full of it. The cook tried
-P-A-G-E-37
THE CAMP ON THE BIG ONION ai 
  to use it all up seasonin’ the soup but the Frenchies wouldn’t 
stand for it in their pea-soup after the first week, and even 
with that he only got the top layer off and then there was 
four more layers growin’ under that one. It beats all how 
thick that wild garlic can grow when it gets a good start. 
Everybody that even went by that place was seasoned so strong 
there wasn’t nobody else could live with him and, worst of
-P-A-G-E-38
22 PAUL BUNYAN 
it, he couldn’t stand to live with himself even. And we pretty 
near just had to break up camp, but then Paul heard that the 
Italian garlic crop was goin’ to fail that year and so we 
grubbed up the whole piece, every last layer of it, and shipped 
it all to Italy and that way we got rid of it at last; just in 
time when a good many of us was goin’ on the drive any- 
way, though.
-P-A-G-E-39
  
   ASOME good loggin’ that Paul 
done when I was with him was a couple of years after that 
on the Pyramid Forty, the same year we’d had the Long 
Rain the spring before. There wasn’t only one forty of land 
there—by goverment surveys anyhow—but Paul got over 
246,000,000 feet of timber off that one forty before the 
season was over. And the reason was, it was shaped like a 
pyramid—so high it took a man a week to see the top, or 
seven men could do it in a day if they all looked together. 
That way there was room for a lot of timber on it—a good 
deal more’n the goverment surveyors figgured there would 
be, and a whole lot more’n they ever knowed come off of it, 
that’s sure. 
But of course it was a tough job buildin’ camp so much 
on the slope. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
24 PAUL BUNYAN 
“You can’t build a camp on the level on any such slope 
as that,” Paul says. 
But he figgured around for a while and it wasn’t long till 
he’d got it all calculated out and a lot of new improvements 
along with it that would take advantage of the lay of the 
country. 
What he done was, he built the camp down in a little 
hollow first that had a slope up the other way, and then after- 
wards he turned it around and put it up on the pyramid—kind 
of near the foot—not too far up. The bunkhouse and barns 
was down below and the cook-shack and commissary hung out 
over the top. 
And loggin’ on the side-hill wasn’t so bad neither when 
you got used to it. The way we took the logs out, naturally, 
goin’ up on one side and down on the other, in the long run 
it come to about the same as if we’d been workin’ on level 
ground all the time anyway. 
And it made it pretty handy in a good many ways. For 
one thing, the boys used to keep their axes sharp by goin’ up 
to the top of the pyramid and pressin’ the edge against one 
of the big rocks up there and start it rollin’ downhill and 
keep runnin’ after it, holdin’ onto their ax-handle. That way 
it come in pretty good for ’em, especially after double-jaw 
Murphy’d chawed up the camp grindstone one night walkin’ 
in his sleep, and Paul hadn’t been able to get another one yet. 
In the bunkhouse the bunks was all on swivels, and bein’ 
on a slant like that, they’d get worked round by mornin’, of 
course, so it made ’em pretty handy to roll out of. And in the 
cook-house the grub could always be sent down the tables by 
gravity.

SO HIGH IT TOOK A MAN A WEEK TO SEE THE TOP
-P-A-G-E-42

-P-A-G-E-43
  
THE PYRAMID FORTY 2 
The men that drove the watertanks over the ice-roads at 
night didn’t have to drive all the way but could just let the 
water down from the top. And for helpin’ the knotters to 
trim the branches off the trees, the sawyers’d just fall ?em 
downhill, and they’d stick in the ground and stand up that 
way so you could get at ’em easier. But of course sometimes 
that wasn’t no advantage, because we wouldn’t always know 
it was the same tree, if we was workin’ fast, and that way one 
tree?d maybe get cut down several times before it got to the 
bottom of the forty. 
But it was generally all right though. And I reckon the 
boys would of learned a whole lot more ways of usin’ the 
side-hill methods if we’d of stayed longer, but Paul didn’t 
stay only that one winter. I knowed a man once that logged 
on the same forty for five years runnin’, but that wasn’t Paul, 
not while I was with him anyway, though he might of made 
a long loggin’ like that before my time with him. The old 
lumbermen used to do that. It saved ’em movin’ around, of 
course, or havin’ to buy up any more land from the gover- 
ment. 
There was only one—or, well, yes, two, countin’ one of 
the straw bosses—that really got adopted to side-hill loggin’ 
in that one winter. That was the boss that took his job so hard 
he thought he had to watch everybody at the same time, and 
used to wear out both his shoes on the inside runnin’ about 
such a lot, till he got the idea of takin’ ’em off and changin’ 
em to the other foot at noon every day; and so he saved 
his shoes that way. And then the other one was a little flunky 
we had that used to carry the lunch to the men in the woods 
when they was workin’ too far out to come in to camp at 
   
-P-A-G-E-44
  28 PAUL BUNYAN 
noon. He had to skirt round the side-hill so much that he 
wore off one leg shorter’n the other, but it was a good thing, 
for then when he got it wore down he could get around with- 
out spillin’ the coffee or the soup no more. 
Course he didn’t have to carry no lunch to the Frenchmen. 
If he had of, he’d probly of had two short legs instead of 
one. The Frenchmen, as I suppose everybody knows, always 
carried soup in their peavey handles. All they ever wanted was 
just pea-soup anyway, and they put that in hot every morning 
in holes they’d bored in their peavey handles. The friction of 
their hands workin’ up and down on the handles kept the 
soup nice and hot till noon. Paul always liked the Frenchmen 
on account of that. He used to hire a good many—sometimes 
pretty near all the men in camp was French, and they was 
mighty good loggers, too, and good story tellers, most of ’em. 
In many ways that year on the Pyramid Forty was one of 
the most interestin’ winters I ever put in with Paul. There was 
some mighty queer animal creatures lived there on the forty, 
for one thing. One of ’em was the Pinnacle Grouse, and 
another one was the side-hill dodger, or Side-Hill Gouger— 
they was called that sometimes. They must of lived there a 
good long time, I should say, from the way they’d adopted 
themselves to the lay of the land. 
The Pinnacle Grouse had only one wing—and that was a 
big one, which she always managed to keep on the outside 
when flyin’ around. She frequented the top of the Pyramid 
mostly—you could see ’em almost always on sunny days flyin’ 
in flocks against the sky near the highest point of the Pyra- 
mid. She was a pretty bird—a kind of brown, with yellow 
stripes on her head and breast—three yellow stripes in the
-P-A-G-E-45
  THE PYRAMID FORTY 29 
middle of the forehead, then a blue, and a yellow, and then 
two yellows, and on her breast long yellow ones, on one side 
extendin’ out to the edge of the wing, and little narrow blue 
stripes runnin’ out along the feathers of the big wing and 
back onto the tail. Very pretty markin’s when you saw her 
close, and she was sure pretty off at a distance in flight. With 
one wing big that way she could fly round and round in little 
circles or big circles, which ever she liked, but of course, 
anyone might know, she never could go straight ahead—not 
the way she was built. The one wing was bound to carry 
her round and round. And then of course she could go up 
and down if she wanted, though she didn’t hardly ever want 
to do that. They generally hung around pretty close to the 
top, circlin’ about the very highest tip of the Pyramid, where 
they could take a bath in the clouds if they wanted to, and 
then come down to roost on the telephone poles and other 
trees growin’ up there. 
The side-hill dodger wasn’t a bird like the grouse, he was 
more like a coon or a woodchuck, kind of a cross between a 
coon and a woodchuck, though he didn’t have rings like a 
coon, on his tail—but he was like a bird because they laid 
eggs, something like some of them Australian animals that 
you hear ’em tell about. He was kind of gray and brown, and 
black all over, and had all four feet black, except one gen- 
erally. He was made so he had two long legs on the downhill 
side and two short legs on the uphill side—that’s how well 
he had adopted himself to livin’ on the side-hill. 
And the hen dodgers always laid square eggs to keep ?em 
from rollin’ down out of the nest she made. But one time it 
happened one of the mother dodgers had laid her eggs wrong
-P-A-G-E-46
  30 PAUL BUNYAN 
side to, and then when the little dodgers come out they had 
‘their long legs on the uphill side and their short legs on the 
downhill side, and they all rolled down to the river at the 
bottom of the Forty and was drowned. 
A crowd of us was standin’ right there at the time watchin’ 
em, but they was goin’ so fast there wasn’t nothing we could 
do to stop ’em. That was the only case I ever knowed of 
where the mother dodgers laid ’em wrong, I think. But we 
sure hated to see ’em drowned that time, because we was all 
fond of the little dodgers, and used to like to watch ’em 
playin’ round in the woods when they was little and just 
learnin’ to walk. 
And then—well, then there was the hodag of course—that 
was an animal you found in most any of the camps back there 
and not only on the Pyramid Forty, but most any place. 
The hodag wasn’t so bad, but he could make the most 
awful noise—the worst you ever heard. Something between 
a screech and a growl, that wasn’t neither, but both of ’em 
together at the same time, and a whole lot of other things 
throwed in besides. You’d think a whole woodsfull of wild- 
cats and hyenas was after you when you heard one of ’em. 
And he wasn’t pretty to look at neither when you seen 
him by himself—especially if you was by yourself too. With 
horns on the back of his legs like a rooster’s only twelve 
hundred times as big, and long claws that turned under kind 
of and had big barbs on ’em up a little ways from the points, 
and big spikes all along his back that they said he could 
throw when he got mad like a porcupine throws his quills, 
only much more speed, and then, finally, stiff hair all over 
his body that had somethin’ in it so it burned you when you
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE PYRAMID FORTY 31 
got close to it, like nettles. 
He was sure a bad one, and enough to scare anybody out 
of their skins at first, I should say—specially the greenhorns 
who’d just come to camp. They was generally all awful scared 
of the hodag the first few weeks, but after they’d been in 
camp awhile and hadn’t seen none, only heard ’em, they gen- 
erally got over bein’ scared—most of ’em anyway—the same 
as they did with the traveau too. Everybody but Buttermilk 
Gibson. They had old Gibson sittin’ on the barn roof all night 
with a shotgun, to see that the hodag didn’t carry off the 
straw boss’s cow that he kept in a shed at camp. 
And then there was another animal that lived on the Pyra- 
mid Forty and that was a fierce creature that was called the 
Ring-tailed Bavalorous. 
He wasn’t queer or peculiar like the other ones, but only 
fierce and ornery, and he hung out generally pretty well down 
by the bottom of the Forty, layin’ in wait for the swampers 
or a team of cattle comin’ home late at night. He was a terri- 
ble animal when he got mad, and he was pretty hard to kill. 
Only Paul once in a while would get one, and that wasn’t 
so very many times neither. 
One time it happened that Babe the Blue Ox finished up 
one of ’em all by himself once, and did a pretty good job of 
it too. 
Babe was comin’ along down the loggin’ road one evenin’ 
and the Ring-tailed Bavalorous was sittin’ out on a limb of a 
tree waitin’ for him, ready to spring on him when he’d come 
under the tree. They was so fierce, the bavalorous was, and so 
reckless, they didn’t care who they tackled, even Babe. He 
calculated to jump down on him, I suppose, and scratch his
-P-A-G-E-48
32 PAUL BUNYAN 
eyes out, and blind him. Anyway Babe seen him in time, and 
that stopped it, for just when the bavalorous was comin’ 
sailin’? down through the air ready to land on his nose, Babe 
just turned his head over a little to one side, and he landed 
on his horn and split himself clean through to his back. Then 
pretty soon when he was sure that he’d got him all right, 
Babe swung his head over and shook him off of that horn and 
onto the other horn, so he got another hole through him, and 
then that’s the way he kept it up, until that fierce bavalorous 
looked like a piece of beefsteak that the cook had pounded 
holes through with his meat hammer, and there was nothin’ 
much but his ringed tail left. 
Babe come into camp that night with the remains of the 
bavalorous hangin’ over his left horn that way and the tail 
skewed down over his left eye. And then some of us took the 
carcass off of him, and the bull-cook cut off the tail and used 
it to sweep the ashes out from under the big heatin’ stove that 
winter.

OCG ee AUL BUNYAN couldn’t of done 
all the great loggin’ he did if it hadn’t been for Babe the 
Blue Ox.\I believe I mentioned helpin’ to take care of him 
for a couple of months when I first come to camp, and then 
I helped measure him once afterwards for a new yoke Ole 
had to make for him. He’d broke the one he had when Paul 
was doin’ an extra quick job haulin’ lumber for some mill- 
men down in Muskegon one summer, and Ole had to make 
him a new one right away and so we had to take Babe’s @2) 
measurements. 
DPve forgot most of the other figgurs, but I remember he 
measured forty-two axhandles between the eyes—and a to- 
bacco box—you could easy fit in a Star tobacco box after the 
last axhandle. That tobacco box was lost and we couldn’t 
never take the measurements again, but I remember that’s
-P-A-G-E-50
  34 PAUL BUNYAN 
what it was. And he weighed accordin’. Though he never 
was weighed that I know of, for there never was any scales 
made that would of been big enough. 
Paul told Ole he might as well make him a new log chain 
too while he was at it, for the way Babe pulled on ’em, in 
just about a month or two what had been a chain would be 
pulled out into a solid bar and wouldn’t be any ate And 
so we measured him up for the chain too. 
Babe was so long in the body, Paul used to have to carry 
a pair of field glasses around with him so as he could see 
what he was doin’ with his hind feet. 
One time Babe kicked one of the straw bosses in the head, 
so his brains all run out, but the cook happened to be handy 
and he filled the hole up with hotcake batter and plastered it 
together again and he was just as good as ever. And right 
now, if I’m not mistaken, that boss is runnin’ camp for the 
Bigham Loggin’ Company of Virginia, Minnesota. 
Babe was so big that every time they shod him they had 
to open up a new iron mine on Lake Superior, and one time 
when Ole the Blacksmith carried one of his shoes a mile 
and a half he sunk a foot and a half in solid rock at every step. 
His color was blue—a fine, pretty, deep blue—and that’s 
why he was called the Blue Ox—when you looked up at him 
the air even looked blue all around him. His nose was pretty 
near all black, but red on the inside, of course, and he had 
big white horns, curly on the upper section—about the upper 
third—and kind of darkish brown at the tip, and then the 
rest of him was all that same deep blue. 
He didn’t use to be always that blue color though. He was 
white when he was a calf. But he turned blue standin’ out
-P-A-G-E-51
BABE THE BLUE OX 35 
in the field for six days the: first winter of the Blue Snow, 
and he never got white again. Winter and summer he was 
always the same, except probly in July—somewheres about 
the Fourth—he might maybe’ve been a shade lighter then. 
I’ve heard some of the old loggers say that Paul brought 
him from Canada when he was a little calf a few days old— 
carried him across Lake Champlain in a sack so he wouldn’t 
have to pay duty on him. But I’m thinkin’ he must of been 
a mighty few days old at the time or Paul couldn’t of done 
it, for he must of grown pretty fast when he got started, to 
grow to the size he did. And then besides there’s them that 
says Paul never had him at all when he was a little fellow 
like that, but that he was a pretty fair-sized calf when Paul 
got him. A fellow by the name of O’Regan down near Detroit 
is supposed to of had him first. O'Regan didn’t have no 
more’n about forty acres or so under cultivation cleared on 
his farm and naturally that wasn’t near enough to raise feed 
for Babe, and so he’s supposed to of sold him the year of the 
Short Oats to Paul Bunyan. I don’t know exactly. It’s all 
before my time. When I went to work for Paul, and all the 
time I knowed him, the Ox was full grown. 
Babe was as strong as the breath of a tote-teamster, Paul 
always said, and he could haul a whole section of timber 
with him at a time—Babe’d walk right off with it—the 
entire six hundred forty acres at one drag, and haul it down 
to the landin’ and dump it in. That’s why there ain’t no sec- 
tion thirty-seven no more. Six trips a day six days a week just 
cleaned up a township, and the last load they never bothered 
to haul back Saturday night, but left it lay on the landin’ to 
float away in the spring, and that’s why there quit bein’  
-P-A-G-E-52

section 377s, and you never see em on the maps no more. 
The only time I ever saw Babe on a job that seemed to 
nearly stump him—but that sure did look like it was goin’ 
to for a while, though—durin’ all the time I was with Paul 
was one time in Wisconsin, down on the St. Croix. And 
that was when he used him to pull the crooks out of eighteen 
miles of loggin’ road; that come pretty near bein’? more’n 
the Ox could handle. For generally anything that had two 
ends to it Babe could walk off with like nothin’. 
But that road of all the crooked roads I ever see—and I’ve 
seen a good many in my day—was of all of ’em the crooked- 
est, and it’s no wonder it was pretty near too much for Babe. 
You won’t believe me when I tell you, but it’s the truth, that 
in that stretch of eighteen miles that road doubled back on 
itself no less than sixteen times, and made four figure 87s, 
nine 3’s, and four S’s, yes, and one each of pretty near every 
other letter in the alphabet. 
Of course the trouble with that road was, there was too 
much of it, and it didn’t know what to do with itself, and 
so it’s no wonder it got into mischief. 
You’d be walkin’ along it, all unsuspectin’, and here of a 
sudden you'd see a coil of it layin’ behind a tree, that you 
never know’d was there, and layin’ there lookin’ like it was 
ready to spring at you. The teamsters met themselves comin’ 
back so many times while drivin’ over it, that it begun to get 
on their nerves and we come near havin’ a crazy-house in 
camp there. And so Paul made up his mind that that there 
road was goin’ to be straightened out right then and there, and 
he went after it accordin’. 
What he done was, he went out and told Bill to bring up

  BABE’D WALK RIGHT OFF WITH IT
-P-A-G-E-54
 
-P-A-G-E-55
BABE THE BLUE OX 39 
the Blue Ox right away, and hitch him to the near end of 
the road. 
Then he went up and spoke somethin’ kind of low to Babe, 
and then afterwards he went out kind of to one side himself, 
and Babe laid hold, and then is the time it come pretty near 
breakin’ the Ox in two, like I said. 
“Come on, Babe! Co-ome on, Ba-abe!” says Paul, and the 
Ox lays hold and pulls to the last ounce of him. If I live to 
be a hundred years old I never hope to see an ox pull like 
that again. His hind legs laid straight out behind him nearly, 
and his belly was almost down touchin’ the ground. 
It was one beeg job, as the Frenchmen would of said. And 
when the crooks finally was all out of that there piece of 
road, there was enough of it to lay around a round lake we 
skidded logs into that winter, and then there was enough left 
in the place where it’d been at first to reach from one end 
to the other. 
DPve always been glad I saw Babe on that pull, for it’s the 
greatest thing I ever saw him do—in its way, anyway. 
Bill, that took care of the Blue Ox, generally went by the 
name of Brimstone Bill at camp and the reason was because 
he got to be so awfully red-hot tempered. But I never blamed 
him, though. Havin’ that Ox to take care of was enough to 
make a sinner out of the best fellow that ever lived. Of all 
the scrapin’ and haulin’ you’d have to do to keep him lookin’ 
anywheres near respectable even, no one would ever think. 
And the way he ate—it took two men just to pick the 
balin’ wire out of his teeth at mealtimes. Four ton of grain 
wasn’t nothin’ for Babe to get away with at a single meal, 
and for the hay—I can’t mention quantities, but I know they
-P-A-G-E-56
    40 PAUL BUNYAN 
said at first, before he got Windy Knight onto cuttin’ it up 
for nails to use in puttin’ on the cook-house roof, Paul used 
to have to move the camp every two weeks to get away from 
the mess of haywire that got collected where Babe ate his 
dinner. And as for cleanin’ the barn and haulin’ the manure 
away— 
I remember one night in our bunkhouse as plain as if it’d 
been yesterday. I can see it all again just like it was then. That 
was one time afterwards, when we was loggin’ down in Wis- 
consin. 
There was a new fellow just come to camp that day, a kind 
of college fellow that’d come to the woods for his health, 
and we was all sittin’ around the stove that night spinnin’ 
yarns like we almost always done of an evenin’ while our socks 
was dryin’. I was over on one end, and to each side of me was 
Joe Stiles, and Pat O’Henry—it’s funny how I remember 
it all—and a fellow by the name of Horn, and Big Gus, and 
a number of others that I don’t recollect now, and over on 
the other end opposite me was Brimstone Bill, and up by me 
was this new fellow, but kind of a little to the side. 
Well, quite a number of stories had been told, and some 
of ’em had been about the Blue Ox and different experiences 
men’d had with him different times and how the manure used 
to pile up, and pretty soon that there college chap begun to 
tell a story he said it reminded him of—one of them there 
old ancient Greek stories, he said it was, about Herukles 
cleanin’ the Augaen stables, that was one of twelve other 
hard jobs he’d been set to do by the king he was workin’ for 
at the time, to get his daughter or somethin’ like that. He 
was goin’ at it kind of fancy, describin’ how the stables hadn’t 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  
BABE THE BLUE OX Al 
been cleaned for some time, and what a condition they was 
in as a consequence, and what a strong man Herukles was, 
and how he adopted the plan of turnin’ the river right 
through the stables and so washin’ the manure away that way, 
and goin’ on describin’ how it was all done. And how the 
water come through and floated the manure all up on top 
of the river, and how there was enough of it to spread over 
a whole valley, and then how the manure rolled up in waves 
again in the river when it got to where it was swifter—and 
it was a pretty good story and he was quite a talker too, that 
young fellow was, and he had all the men listenin’ to him. 
Well, all the time old Brimstone Bill he sat there takin’ 
it all in, and I could see by the way his jaw was workin’ on 
his tobacco that he was gettin’ pretty riled. Everythin’ had 
been quiet while the young fellow was tellin’ the story, and 
some of us was smokin’, some of us enjoyin’ a little fresh 
Star or Peerless maybe and spittin’ in the sandbox occasionally 
which was gettin’ pretty wet by this time, and there wasn’t 
no sound at all except the occasional sizzle when somebody 
hit the stove, or the movin’ of a bench when somebody’s foot 
or sock would get too near the fire, and the man’s voice goin’ 
along describin’ about this Herukles and how great he was 
and how fine the stables looked when he got through with 
?em, when all at once Brimstone Bill he busted right into 
him: 
“You shut your blamed mouth about that Herik Lees of 
yourn,” he says. “I guess if your Herik Lees had had the 
job I’ve got for a few days, he wouldn’t of done it so easy 
or talked so smart, you young Smart Alec, you—” and then 
a long string of ’em the way Bill could roll ’em off when he  
-P-A-G-E-58
42 PAUL BUNYAN 
got mad—TI never heard any much better’n him—they said he 
could keep goin’ for a good half hour and never repeat the 
same word twict—but I wouldn’t give much for a lumber- 
jack who couldn’t roll off a few dozen straight—specially if 
he’s worked with cattle—and all the time he was gettin’ 
madder’n madder till he was fairly sizzlin’? he was so mad. 
“T guess if that Mr. Lees had had Babe to take care of he 
wouldn’t of done it so easy. Tell him he can trade jobs with 
me for a spell if he wants to, and see how he likes it. I guess 
if he’d of had to use his back on them one hundred and fifty 
jacks to jack up the barn the way I got to do he wouldn’t of 
had enough strength left in him to brag so much about it. 
-I just got through raisin’ it another sixty foot this afternoon. 
When this job started we was workin’ on the level, and now 
already Babe’s barn is up sixteen hundred foot. I’d like to see 
the river that could wash that pile of manure away, and you 
can just tell that Herik Lees to come on and try it if he wants 
to. And if he can’t, why, then you can just shut up about it. 
Pve walked the old Ox and cleaned ’im and doctored ?im and 
rubbed ’im ever since he was first invented, and I know what 
it is, and I ain’t goin’ to sit here and let you tell me about 
any Mr. Lees or any other blankety blank liar that don’t 
know what he’s talkin’ about tellin’ about cleanin’ barns— 
not if I know it.” And at it he goes again blankety blank blank 
all the way out through the door, and slams it behind him so 
the whole bunkhouse shook, and the stranger he sits there 
and don’t know hardly what to make of it. Till I kind of 
explained to him afterwards before we turned in, and we all, 
the rest of ’em too, told him not to mind about Bill, for he 
couldn’t hardly help it. After he’d been in camp a few days 
   
-P-A-G-E-59
BABE THE BLUE OX 43 
he’d know. You couldn’t hardly blame Bill for bein’ aggra- 
vated—used to be a real good-natured man, and he wasn’t 
so bad even that time I was helpin’ him, but the Ox was too 
much for any man, no matter who. 
And so I never held it against Bill much myself. He was 
fond of Babe too and made quite a pet of him, more so than 
the rest of us even, and we all did. 
“JT been with the beast a good long time,” he used to say, 
“and I know the cantankerous old reptile most the same’s if 
I had been through him with a lantern. I know how to do 
for ’im, and all his little ways and all, and I don’t want any- 
body else botherin’ round and messin’ things up for me. I can 
take care of ’im all right. All I want is to be let alone.” 
Afterwards when Paul got his hay farm down in Wiscon- 
sin it made it easier for Bill. Then we’d just rake the hay 
up in windrows and let it freeze that way layin’ out across 
the fields, and in the winter they’d haul it in one end first 
in the stable and cut it up in chunks for Babe, just pullin’ it 
up a little each time. That way you could get away from the 
nuisance of the haywire, and didn’t have that to bother with. 
In any of his small camps Paul couldn’t never keep Babe 
but a day or so at a time, because it took the tote-teamsters 
a year to haul a day’s feed for him. 
Babe was a kind of playful fellow too. Sometimes he’d step 
in a river and lay down there and so make the water rise and 
leave a boom of logs that was below there up high and dry, 
and again sometimes he’d step on a ridge makin’ a lakeshore 
maybe, and smash it down and let out the water to flood a 
river and drown out some low water drive. 
Around the camp he’d play with almost any of us who was
-P-A-G-E-60
44 PAUL BUNYAN 
willin’ to play with him after the day’s work. We used to 
feed him hotcakes sometimes and he got awful fond of ’em. 
Them big ones we made on the big griddle we used to fold 
up in quarters and put clover hay in between and give it to 
him for a sandwich and he liked that powerful well. But 
we shouldn’t of done it, I know that now. Pve thought many 
times since, it’s too bad, for that’s what got him started, and 
once started he seemed he couldn’t never stop. Poor old Babe. 
It proved to be the death of him at last. It was all wrong of 
us, but of course we didn’t think about it then, and had no 
notion what it would lead to in the end. 
Paul Bunyan was sure fond of his Ox, and mighty proud 
of him too, as he’d a right to be. 
“Be faithful,” he used to say to him low under his breath 
as he walked along beside him. “Be faithful, my Babe. Faith- 
ful.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  3 AUL logged in Michigan 
for SOME five years efter that, ard then we went up into Wis- 
consin, to a new part where we hadn’t never been before. 
One year, I know, up there, we was loggin’ on a river that 
we didn’t even know the name of till we happened to find 
out the next spring when we was pretty near ready to leave 
anyway, 
That spring Shot aeons Joe Murphy, Pete Hackett, 
and myself was goin’ to take the drive down for Paul; and 
then we had a number of others along too—they was most of 
em pretty good rivermen—and then for good luck we had 
Pete Legoux along. I’]l have to stop and tell about Pete some 
time, for he sure was about as fool a Frenchman as you ever 
want to see. One time I remember he made Paul pretty good 
and mad at him.
-P-A-G-E-62
  46 PAUL BUNYAN 
Paul had a raft of logs in the river that he was goin’ to 
take down to the mill afterwards but that he wanted to tie 
up for the time bein’ till he could get another lot out first. 
Well, the way it was, Paul himself was out on the boom 
fastenin’ up the boom chains, and the river was roarin’ along 
pretty fast right there, and he’d left Pete up at the other 
end by the windlass with the anchor, and when he got the 
boom in just the right location to suit him, he yells to Pete, 
“Drop the anchor, Pete!” 
And Pete he looks down at the anchor and he sees there 
ain’t no rope on it, and he yells back to Paul: 
“Hey, Paul, no string on hank’.” 
But course with the roar of the river and all the noise it 
made, Paul didn’t hear, and he yells again, “Drop the anchor, 
Pete. What’s the matter with you? Drop the anchor, I said.” 
And then Pete he drops the anchor. “What Paul say, she 
go,” he says to himself. “Paul, he ees ze boss and he make all 
ze monee from log. When he say, ‘Drop ze hank’, I drop ze 
hank’. By Gar! Eef Paul say drop ze horse, I drop ze horse.” 
And so the minute Paul let go, the boom went spinnin’ 
down the rapids, naturally, and the anchor was safe in the 
mud at the bottom of the river, and Paul would of liked to’ve 
fell in and got drowned if he hadn’t of turned the log he was 
on around and made it float up river so’s he could get to land. 
And he sure was mad at Pete that time. 
But here now [ve been tellin’ all about Pete, when I was 
goin’ to tell about the Round Drive. And for that matter 
that ain’t all about Pete Legoux neither—T1l have to tell the 
rest some other time, I guess. 
Well, there was Shot Gunderson and Joe Murphy, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
THE ROUND DRIVE 47 
Pete Hackett and myself and a number of others and we was 
goin’ to take the drive down that spring. There’d been this 
river close to where we was loggin’ and we’d been puttin’ all 
the logs we got out that winter into this river we was on— 
about twenty-six million feet I reckon there must of been in 
all—and Paul told us to take em down to a mill somewheres 
and sell ’em. 
Well, we didn’t know where we was exactly, but we 
figgured if we followed the “usual plan and drove the way 
the river ran,” like they say in the poetry, we’d come out 
somewheres, and so we started out. 
Hackett was cookin’ for the gang and Joe and me and 
Shot was takin’ turns actin’ as river-boss, and we was movin’ 
along havin’ a gay time, laughin’ and talkin’ and singin’, and 
that’s the way we went on down the river for about two 
weeks or three pretty near, and nothin’ happened all that 
time, and then what did we do one day but run by a camp 
that looked pretty near as big as ours, and we wondered who 
it was that was loggin’ there, naturally. 
But of course we didn’t stop to investigate, because we 
didn’t think so very much about it then, but kept right on 
goin’. 
And then pretty soon, after about another two or three 
weeks or so, we passed another camp that looked even bigger 
than the first one had done. There was the same cook-house 
pretty near like in our own camp, with the stove-pipe and the 
smoke comin’ out of it, and there was the barns for the cattle 
and the manure piles and everythin’, and the stacks of wood 
that the bull-cooks had got in, behind the cook-shanty, and 
the blacksmith shop and all, and all just exactly like we had
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 PAUL BUNYAN 
in our camp—only not quite so big, of course, but pretty 
near—and we wondered who it was that was loggin’ on any- 
thin’ like that scale, almost like Paul, and was apin’ his 
methods like that, and we talked about it almost every day 
after that for the next couple of weeks. And then I'll be 
jiggered if we didn’t run into another camp again, just the 
same as the other two that we’d passed before. 
So that time we thought we’d stop and investigate, and 
we did. 
“[’m goin’ to go ashore,” I says. “I don’t care what the 
rest of you is goin’ to do.” 
And Shot Gunderson, he says, “I’m with you, Angus. Just 
wait a minute. I’1l go up with you.” 
And the two of us went up towards the camp. 
“If we find out who the fellow is, runnin’ this outfit,” says 
Shot, “we'll just tell him Paul’s got all the land in this part 
of the state pre-empted, and he’d better be thinkin’ about 
movin’ out if he knows what’s good for him. 
“And Paul’s got a patent on them there kind of skid sleds,” 
he says, “and this feller’d better not be usin’ ’em, or he’ll 
find out.” 
“Looks like he’s got a blue ox to log with too,” I says. 
“Look at that barn up there.” For there was a big barn just 
like Babe’s up on the hill. 
“Paul will sure be mad when he finds out about this,” 
Shot says. 
And by that time we was pretty near up to the commissary, 
and we was all ready with what we was goin’ to say to that 
boss when we found him, and here if we didn’t run right 
plank, slam into Paul himself as big as you please, sittin’ on
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE ROUND DRIVE 49 
the commissary steps in the sunshine whittlin’ on a jackpine. 
By George, we was some surprised. 
You see the way that was, the river we’d been on was 
round and hadn’t no outlet, and we’d been goin’ round and 
round the same way all them eight weeks we’d been out, and 
them three camps we’d passed had been nothin’ but our own 
camp all the time. 
“Ef we go roun’ an’ roun’ some more, las’ we go to hal,” 
says Pete Legoux. And I guess that time Pete would of been 
about right. 
And so then, when the drive came back that way, Paul 
finally knowed where he’d been loggin’ that winter. 
“We been loggin’ on Round River,” he says. “I kind of 
pretty near thought that from what happened the other 
day.” 
What’d happened the other day was: 
Sam’s supply of meat was gettin’ low and Paul knowed 
there must be some good fish in that river and he figgured 
he’d go out and get a supply of ’em to help out with. 
So he got Ole to make him a water auger, and then, like 
he generally did, he went out and bored holes. That’s the 
way Paul almost always done his fishin’. He’d bore holes in 
the river and then when the fish would come to these holes 
they’d fall down in ’em and break their necks. Dead fish 
always float, of course, and Paul’d get the cook’s coffee- 
strainer and use that for a landin’-net. 
But there was something funny about them fish, though. 
They was curved, and Ole had to make all extra round bot- 
toms for the frying-pans for the cook to fry ’em in. And 
then when the men ate ’em it made their backs get all crooked
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 PAUL BUNYAN 
up so Paul had to put quite a few of ’em in splints to get 
them straightened out again. 
So Paul was pretty near beginning to think that there was 
something queer about that river, and now when we told him 
the luck we’d had he knowed where he was all right. 
“It’s Round River we been loggin’ on,” he says. “No 
wonder them fish was kind of funny.” 
And so that was the end of the Round Drive. Well, that 
is, of course, we had to get the logs out, but Paul fixed that 
up all right. What he done was, he just called Sourdough 
Sam, the cook. 
“Sam,” he says, “make up a good stiff batch of sourdough 
biscuit dough, and when I get ready, you put it in where I 
tell you to.” 
And then he goes out right away and spades out a channel 
through a ridge that’s between the river and a lake over on 
the other side, that’s got an outlet. And next mornin’? Sam 
dumps his sourdough in the big tank and hitches Babe to it 
and hauls it out and dumps it in the river, and it riz right 
up and filled the channel and floated the logs right out into 
the lake. And so then Shot and I and Joe and the rest of 
the men started out again, gay as ever. 
The spring drive, of course, used to always be a great time 
for us lumberjacks. It was a mighty excitin’ time, and then 
besides it was a pretty sight too. Floatin’ down one of them 
rivers on fine balmy spring nights, I tell you it was fine. 
The willows would be hangin’ down to the water on each 
side, swishin’ as we went by, and the pine trees up on the 
hills would be black as pitch against the sky. Oh, it used to 
be a fine sight—would make a mighty fine picture, I’ve
-P-A-G-E-67
  
THE ROUND DRIVE 51 
  always thought. And the water lappin’ against the sides of 
the raft we was on, and against the old rotten logs layin’ out 
along the banks of the stream. Talk about your fine music. 
If that wasn’t fine music for you, I’d like to know. And
-P-A-G-E-68
52 PAUL BUNYAN 
sometimes you’d be passin’ through them cool layers of air 
that made you shiver and turn up your mackinaw around 
your neck, and then again sometimes you’d hit one of them 
warm layers that’s so soft and warm on your face that it near 
puts you to sleep and you feel as if you’d never want to wake 
up no more. Funny how I remember it all, how it used to be 
on them Wisconsin rivers in the spring. I don’t suppose Pd 
thought of it for maybe forty years. 
I never did rightly understand what caused them warm 
layers and them cool layers of air like that. I’ve noticed ’em 
in other places too. Down on the farm where I was a boy, 
along the cricks down there. It’s always puzzled me, and 
though Pve heard it talked about a good deal, I never yet 
met anybody that knowed what made ’em that way. 
Yes, and then always there was the white-water drivin’. 
That used to be a pretty sight too. And Paul was the greatest 
white-water man that ever was. 
There wasn’t nobody could shoot a falls or a rapids like 
him—or anywheres near like him except one man; and that 
was the fellow the St. Lawrence River was named after. It 
was when Paul was bringin’ a raft of logs around Key West 
from his South Dakota camps to take ’em up to Chicago and 
he was on the lookout for some place to take ’em through. 
Well, he found a river and started up it, but pretty soon 
he come to the Niagara Falls and he didn’t know how he 
was goin’ to make the climb. 
“Gee, I guess Pve got to have some help,” he says. 
And then he went up to a farmer’s that lived on the banks 
of the stream, and as luck would have it he was a regular 
old seasoned French-Canadian white-water man, the best of 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE ROUND DRIVE 53 
any, and between the two of ’em they got the raft over the 
falls all right. The man’s name was Lawrence, so Paul Bun- 
yan named the crick the Saint Lawrence in honor of him. 
Well, drivin’ was a fine excitin’ time like I said, most ways 
—course there was some drawbacks—the mosquitoes, for in- 
stance. They was as big as grasshoppers, and no mistake. They 
said some of ’em used to lay in hollow logs and bark at night, 
but it seems to me most of em was out that time of day. 
Paul tried a cure for the mosquitoes once but that’s one 
of the times he didn’t do so good as he thought he was goin’ to. 
He sent East somewhere for a few hives of a special big 
kind of bumblebees, and he figgured it out that the bumble- 
bees would eat the mosquitoes so we'd get rid of ’em, and 
then the bumblebees that was left wouldn’t bother us none 
if we’d only leave ’em alone—and they might make honey 
on the side. Well, what happened was, the bumblebees, in- 
stead of bein’ mortal enemies of the mosquitoes as they should 
of been, made friends with ’em instead and got so thick with 
?em that the two tribes intermarried. The youngsters was 
some terrors, let me tell you. They had the big fat body of 
their bumblebee dads and the longishness and leanness of their 
mosquito mothers, and a sting they come by from each of 
?em, so they had a stinger in each end of ’em. That way they 
got us both goin’ and comin’. 
Well, it was an awful life we led after that. We used to 
have to barricade the doors and windows of the stables so 
that the things wouldn’t get at the cattle, and we had men 
with axes, and peavies, and pike-poles standin’ guard on the 
inside. They got so hungry they tore the shakes off the bunk- 
house roof tryin’ to get in, and they come pretty near carryin’
-P-A-G-E-70
  
  54 PAUL BUNYAN 
off the whole camp. 
Finally, though, the bumblebee blood in ’em got the best 
of ’em. Terrible fond of sweets they was, like their dads, 
only more so, and they couldn’t never get enough. Course 
there was flowers growin’ round the camp, but what’s a flower 
to a bee with a ten gallon stomach? 
And one day they smelled a sugar ship out in the middle 
of Lake Superior comin’ from Hawaii, carryin’ a carload of 
sugar to Paul’s camp, and they all swarmed out to get some. 
They killed off all the crew and got the sugar all right, but 
they got more’n was good for ’em. They was so greedy and 
ate till they got so heavy that when they tried to fly back 
to shore, they sunk in the lake and was never heard of no 
more. Bi 
Only a few of ’em was left and them P. T. Barnum got 
for his circus. Mr. Barnum had wanted Babe if he could of 
got him, but Paul said he couldn’t afford to let him go, and 
he wouldn’t think of it anyway, but he told old P. T. if he 
wanted some of them there mosquitoes, why, he was welcome 
to em. 
Well, when Barnum heard about them mosquitoes and 
what a size they was and some of the things they could do, 
he was just as crazy to get them as he’d been about gettin’ 
Babe—anyway he couldn’t of found tunnels big enough to 
take the Ox through with his circus train but would of had 
to have special men to turn Babe’s head sideways every time 
they was goin’ to go through one—and so then right away 
he sends up one of his best lion-tamers to capture a few of 
them mosquitoes. 
That feller that come up—Henderlee, his name was—was

sure a game young feller all right. First thing one of them 
mosquitoes pretty near killed him—tore a good part of his 
shirt off of him first thing and got a big hunk out of his 
shoulder, just above the left shoulder-blade when he was 
tryin’ to get a half-Nelson on him. 
He might of tried the boiler method of catchin’ ’em, but 
someone told him that wasn’t no good. Don Howard had 
tried that way of doin’ it but found it didn’t work very good 
—Don was that young college chap we had in camp, and he 
was goin’ to get some of them mosquitoes to take back to one 
of his perfessors, he said. Well, he got himself a good heavy 
copper boiler and crawled under that, and used himself as 
bait, and took a good big hammer in with him, and he 
figgured when the mosquitoes would stick their snouts in he’d 
just hammer ’em down and rivet ’em fast to the inside of the 
boiler. But he hadn’t riveted no more’n three of them till they 
got so strong they just flew away, boiler and all, liftin’ it 
right up with ’em. 
Well, one of the men at the camp told Barnum’s man about 
that, so he had sense enough not to try that way. 
“T know what TIl do,” he says. “Pl catch ’em all right. 
I got a way, I think.” 
And what he done was, he got a squirt gun and shot turpen- 
tine up at ’em, and when it landed on their stomachs where 
the hair was thin it hurt ’em and they doubled up with pain. 
Their stingers was made with a kind of crook at the end and 
when they got curled up like that they got their hind stinger 
caught around their front stinger and got held up tight in a 
ring. So then Henderlee clamped a chain on quick and a pad- 
lock and loaded ’em in cars in rings that way and shipped ’em

down to Chicago, where the circus was at the time. 
But he was a game feller all right. For if he hadn’t of had 
good luck the turpentine might of made ’em so mad that they 
would of killed him right off without stoppin’ to sing a 
warnin’. It was good figgurin’ on his part to know they’d catch 
themselves around the stingers that way. 
And that same spring of the mosquitoes was the time the 
bedbugs got so thick in camp too. We’d been so busy fightin’ 
the mosquitoes that we’d kind of let up on the bedbugs for a 
spell and they’d got the run on us. They got so smart that 
when you wrote your name down in the big time-book in the 
office and the clerk put down the number of the bunk you was 
goin’ to sleep in, the bedbugs would crawl along the pen so’s 
to know where to find you afterwards. 
And they always found you, too.

: SSN PAUL’S camp back there 
in Wiss the riaieicencies used to get so thick they had to 
have twenty ox-teams haulin’ ’em away, and they hauled 
em out in the woods, and the chipmunks ate ’em and grew 
so big the people shot ’em for tigers. 
The big scale everythin’ was, of course, like I’ve been 
tellin’ about, you couldn’t hardly help it. Bound to be a mess. 
Paul used to have twenty flunkies sweepin’ the prunestones 
out from under the tables, but even then they’d get so thick 
we had to wade through ’em up over our shoes sometimes 
on our way in to dinner. They’d be all over the floor and in 
behind the stove and piled up against the windows where 
they’d dumped ’em outside so the cook couldn’t see out at all 
hardly. 
We begun to have so many Swedes in camp there always,
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 PAUL BUNYAN 
and of course that was the reason. And Paul just had to have 
the prunes for ’em if he was goin’ to get any work out of 
em at all—prunes and snoos. Paul took to chewin’ snoos him- 
self one winter and it kept two men busy shovelin’ for him 
all the time. 
But generally, though, Paul was satisfied with smokin’ a 
~ pipe—one of them there big corn-cobs, he used to have— 
strong enough to buck a northeast wind. He lost it one time 
and didn’t find it for pretty near a week and then he got so 
grumpy nobody couldn’t hardly get along with him. But one 
of the bull-cooks made him up a kind of cigar out of some 
of the patent tar roofing they was puttin’ on the cook-shanty 
roof at the time and filled it up inside with some of the coffee 
grounds the cook had on hand, and that was strong enough 
to put Paul in good humor again till his pipe could be found 
and hauled back to camp. 
And the eggshells, too, used to be thick—so deep we gen- 
erally had to dig a runway through to get in the cook-house 
door. But even at their worst they wasn’t anywhere near as 
bad as the prunestones of course. Paul raked up eighteen car- 
loads of the prunestones one winter and shipped ’em out and 
Charley Dobey told me he got $40,000 for ’em. I always 
wondered what anybody’d be wantin’ to buy prunestones for 
but afterwards I found out. It seems some Foreign Trade Ex- 
portin’? Company was shippin’ ?em to South America, riveted 
together in long strings, to sell em to the natives for wenie- 
wursts. 
And another winter when he had some extra big prunes 
from California, Paul used a lot of ’em to build a prune- 
stone bridge across Lake Superior.
-P-A-G-E-77
PRUNESTONES 61 
Paul was loggin’ on the south shore of the lake that winter 
near Ashland and had his camp on the north shore. The lake 
was frozen over pretty well, but there was about five miles 
right in the middle that wasn’t froze over, and so Paul didn’t 
have no way of gettin’ the crew across to Wisconsin to work 
unless he built a bridge. He started in to build it just over 
the open place at first, just lettin’ it come out even at the 
end, but then he figgured he might as well have it extend 
over on the ice a little ways too while he was at it so the 
slope would be better, and anyway he had plenty of prune- 
stones to work with and plenty of haywire. He used haywire 
to bale em up with. He’d bale the prunestones together with 
wire and then he’d raise the bales up on end and you’d find 
they wasn’t such poor material for a bridge neither when 
you got a few of ’em put together. 
It came in mighty handy afterwards when Paul started 
his macaroni farm down in Wisconsin. That bridge was 
14,000 feet long, 4,000 feet high on each side, and 4 feet 
wide, and was built far enough out over the ice so it held 
good for many years afterwards. 
And then, besides prunes, another thing we had in camp 
there always was pea-soup—that’s when there was French- 
men around and that was pretty generally all the time, for 
Paul was awfully fond of the Frenchmen for loggers. 
“Nothing like the Frenchmen for loggers,” he used to say, 
“when they have their pea-soup.” And he generally seen to 
it that they had it. 
Breakfast, pea-soup, dinner; pea-soup, supper, pea-soup, 
it didn’t make no difference, the Frenchmen was always just 
as fond of it.

62 PAUL BUNYAN 
We used to have a big dinnerhorn in camp that the cook’d 
send one of the cookees out to blow, whenever dinner was 
ready, and the minute them Frenchmen heard that horn begin 
to toot they’d make a bee-line right off for the cook-shack. 
No matter where they was or what they was doin’ they’d 
be off right away and in a minute or two they’d be settin’ 
down eatin’ their pea-soup. If they was out in the woods and 
choppin’ down a tree, even if their ax was up in the air on the 
stroke they was makin’, they wouldn’t bother to finish it but 
would leave it up there in the air and break for the camp. 
“Come on, boys, good pea-soup on ze tab,” one of ?em 
would yell, and they'd all go helter-skelter, hit-er-miss, as 
fast as they could leg it. 
I remember there was a buyer come out from New York 
once and he was out in the woods with some of the men tryin’ 
to get a line-up on the way loggin’ was done and how the 
logs was first got out that his lumber come from so’s he’d 
know somethin’ about it from the beginnin’. Well, he’d been 
watchin’ the fallers and the buckers and the way the loadin’ 
was done, spendin’ most of the forenoon, and he happened 
to be out there by the road when the dinnerhorn blowed, and 
he was sure surprised at the way the men come out of the 
woods on both sides down the slopes of the hill. I guess he 
thought the woods was a-fire or some terrible animal was 
after ’em, for here they come, runnin’ like mad, as hard as 
they could go. 
They all run past him, of course, and it wasn’t long, run- 
nin’ the way they did, till they was all gone by. All but one, 
that is. The buyer noticed this fellow wasn’t runnin’ no more. 
It seems he’d been knocked down by somebody, and when 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  
PRUNESTONES 63 
he got up again he didn’t try to run no more but just walked 
along slow. 
“Why ain’t you runnin’?” Smith says to him. “You ain’t 
hurt, are you? You ought to be runnin’ like the rest of ’em.” 
“No use run no more,” Frenchie says. ““Pee-soup all gone 
now when I come.” 
You had to be right there always if you was goin’ to get 
any of the pea-soup, for it seems the cook couldn’t never 
make enough to fill up all them Frenchmen, but they always 
had room for more. 
That was before we had the pea-soup spring, of course, 
while they was just cookin’ it in kettles. After we got the 
pea-soup spring it was all right. 
The way Paul happened to get the spring was: One after- 
noon one of the tote-teamsters was comin’ along the road 
from town with a load of peas for the camp. It was in March 
and the road was gettin’ slippery, and there was a hot spring 
alongside the road and the steam from there made it all the 
more slippery right in that spot, and just as the teamster was 
comin’ by that slippery place the sled begun to slide off the 
ice-road and the whole tote-load went right kerplunk into the 
spring, load, teamster, cattle and all—that is, the young team- 
ster managed to keep himself out and most part of the cattle— 
their hind legs was in, that was all—but the load of peas went 
clean to the bottom, and naturally the young feller didn’t 
know what to do. 
Well, about that time Paul come along and the minute he 
seen how it was he knowed what to do, for Paul wasn’t never 
stumped, and this give him one of his bright ideas again. 
“Unyoke the cattle,” he says to the teamster, “and get  
-P-A-G-E-80
64 PAUL BUNYAN 
out of the way yourself. And hand me that ax and peavey 
you got there.” 
And then he takes and butchers the cattle and cuts the 
meat up in hunks and pushes the whole outfit back in the 
spring again. 
“Tet it cook a couple of hours,” he says, “and then you 
can tell the men to come up for their pea-soup. It’ll be fine, 
flavored with oxtail that way.” 
Most loggin’ bosses if they’d of lost a load that way would 
of considered it an entire total loss but that wasn’t Paul. Paul 
always knowed what to do in a case like that. 
And so after that we always cooked the pea-soup in that 
spring. Paul had a splash dam and flume put in after a while 
so he could run a soup splash down to the camps on section 37, 
and out to the men that was workin’ too far out in the woods 
to come in at dinner time. 
Paul used to have the peas shipped in by the trainload 
and the same way with the salt pork and beef, and flour for 
the hotcakes. The prune trains always came in with two en- 
gines on ’em, one before, and one behind, pushing. 
We had spuds in Paul’s camp, too. We didn’t use to at first, 
but the men liked ’em with their salt pork and so Paul thought 
he’d get a supply of ’em. But one spring someone left the 
warehouse door open and the sun came in on the sacks of 
potatoes and turned ’em all green and spoiled ’em all for 
eatin’. Paul was mad, and he said he was goin’ to raise some 
himself. 
“Pm goin’ to have new potatoes by the Fourth of July,” 
he says. 
Course most of us told him it couldn’t be done, but Paul

PRUNESTONES 67 
said he’d show us, and so he went ahead and grubbed up a 
south slope a little ways from the camp and put in his spuds. 
Well, it was a fine spring with plenty of sunshine, and the 
vines was growin’ fine and big, and about the first of July 
Paul went out to see if his bet was goin’ to be good or not. 
He went about a quarter of the way up the hill and made 
a little hole by one of the vines, workin’ pretty carefully, and 
it’s a good thing he did go about it carefully or it might have 
been worse, for thirty-seven bushel run out of that there hole 
before he could get it plugged up again. 
And so we had plenty of spuds that next winter, and after- 
wards that’s the way Paul always done—just planted ’em 
himself. 
Then besides the prunestones and eggshells and potato 
peelin’s there was the coffee grounds that always got col- 
lected around the cook-shanty door and had to be hauled 
away. Till towards spring anyhow, when we could let ’em 
pile up then for a time because we was goin’ to move camp 
soon anyway. One of the cookees was goin’ to try to get away 
from the coffee grounds by not puttin’ any coffee in, but just 
drawin’ his brown shirt through the coffee-pot instead, but 
the men wouldn’t stand for that. Just the same as they 
wouldn’t stand for the religious cook neither. 
Paul hired an awful religious cook that spring by the name 
of Heaven-Help-Us Davis, that was bound that grace was 
goin’ to be said at the table at meal time. Naturally the men 
wouldn’t stand for it—didn’t want several minutes of per- 
fectly good eatin’ time wasted in askin’ grace. So Paul didn’t 
know what to do about the men kickin’, because good cooks 
was awful hard to find, and Heaven-Help-Us was a mighty
-P-A-G-E-84
  
  68 PAUL BUNYAN 
good cook, even if he did mix revival hymns in with the 
onions in the mulligan like they said he did—it don’t cut 
much ice what goes into a mulligan anyway. 
Well, it looked for a while as if there was goin’ to be a 
real row in camp, because the men was all rarin’ mad, and 
Heaven-Help-Us wouldn’t give in on a little grace at meals 
anyway, and then Paul he thought of somethin’, What he 
done was, he hired a tall, lank guy for a cookee to help 
wait on table and so they didn’t have to ask no grace no more 
after that. That feller was so blame tall he could just reach 
up and get one without havin’ to ask for it. 
Now how wide did I put that bridge down for? What 
was it I said, I wonder. Oh, four feet. No, that ain’t right. 
Four feet ain’t wide enough for a bridge. I thought there 
was something wrong there. It was 40,000 feet long, 14,000 
feet high, and 40 feet wide—forty, that’s what it was. Them 
was the exact measurements that was give to me by the engi- 
neer that was puttin’ it up. 
Funny thing when you get something like that wrong, 
how it bothers you afterwards, till you just got to go back 
and fix it up. It might not bother some people, but I always 
want to get everything right if I can. The truth, the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth, is the way I want it should be.

: SSESIDES Paul himself 
bein’? great he had some men workin’ for him that was A-1 
too. I can’t say I ever got to be so much around the camp my- 
self—I wasn’t the size to be a great logger like some of ’em 
was—but there was some, all right, that Paul was mighty 
proud of. Course I was six foot two or three in them days— 
when I was young, that is—and that ain’t so bad—I’ve sunk 
down a good bit since then—you kind of settle down when 
you get old, you'll find—but that wasn’t nothin’ to compare 
with some of ’em—Ole, f’rinstance, that ve mentioned, and 
Batiste Joe, and Windy and Shot and the rest of them. Oh, 
Paul and I always got along all right when it comes to that 
and I guess he liked me all right, but he wasn’t fond of me 
like he was of Ole, and Joe, and them others. 
There was a funny thing about Ole when he first come to
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 PAUL BUNYAN 
camp—Paul come near makin’ a bad mistake about him. You 
see it was like this: Paul’d been needin’ a cook and a black- 
smith both for a long time, and he’d been advertisin’ for em; 
and one mornin’ two men comes up to the camp lookin’ for 
a job, and the ticket says one of ’em is a cook and the other 
is a blacksmith. Well, Paul was mighty glad to get ’em and 
right away he says to the one with the clean shirt on: 
“You get right into that cook-shanty and start the hot- 
cakes. You’re just the man I been lookin’ for.” 
And to the other fellow—the one with the dirty shirt— 
he says: 
“My Ox needs a shoe on his left hind foot. The black- 
smith shop is over there. You’ll find a carload of iron in.” 
And then, naturally, he goes away and leaves ’em, for Paul 
wasn’t the kind that waited for an answer to the orders he 
give. And they just had to make the best of it. 
But it wasn’t long before Paul found out the mistake he’d 
made, though, and the rest of us found out too when we come 
in to breakfast, for Ole tempered the hotcakes so hard they 
was just like iron. And the cook, that was tryin’ to be the 
blacksmith, started to soak off Babe’s hoof with hot oatmeal 
mush instead of parin’ it off, and pretty near got his head 
kicked off in the bargain. 
Well, when Paul took the first bite into one of them hot- 
cakes, he seen what he’d done soon enough, and was pretty 
prompt to make it right. 
“Go out there,” he says to Ole, “and make a left hind shoe 
for that Blue Ox of mine. If you get the iron anywheres 
near as hard as this hotcake, it’11 wear on any ice-road we got, 
I reckon. And tell that partner of yours out there to come in
-P-A-G-E-87
SOME OF PAUL’S MEN 7d: 
and make breakfast for the camp.” 
And so Ole the Blacksmith got his right job all right, and 
the cook got his. But I tell you Ole was mighty careful never 
to wear a clean shirt again—never after that, not even when 
he was courtin’. That breakfast was all he wanted of it. All 
he ever had to do with the cookin’ after that was to punch 
the holes in the doughnuts for Paul—that was a big job, of 
course, but then that come naturally in his line. 
But Slim Mullins didn’t never change his shirt—that 
would of been too much for him, I spose. He’d got so used 
to the one he had on, that he couldn’t never seem to think 
of changin’ it. At least I never knowed of it if he did. So 
long as I knowed him he always wore that same shirt. 
Of course it never wore out, naturally, for he always kept 
gettin’ a new layer of grease on it all the time, and that kept 
it from wearin’ out. It got so slippery at last that they said 
he used to have to sleep between sandpapers to keep from 
slippin’ out of bed. He went away with it on when Johnny 
Inkslinger had to mix him up a walk at last, because he’d 
put dynamite in the biscuits instead of bakin’ powder when 
he was drunk one day, and if that cook is around somewhere 
now I’ll.bet my last dollar he’s wearin’ that shirt yet. 
And another feller that come into camp about the same 
time and afterwards got to be one of the best men there was 
Bud Kangley. He was a green kid when he first come in and 
we used to like to play tricks on him. A big strappin’ young- 
ster just off the farm, with blue eyes and yellow hair and 
pink cheeks—just the kind you like to play a good joke on— 
with big muscles, though soft yet of course, but the makin’s 
of a first-rate logger in him.
-P-A-G-E-88
  72 PAUL BUNYAN 
Well, we all liked to get somethin’ on Bud, he always 
was so good-natured and used to get such a fine big grin on 
when he found out he’d been fooled, but one time one of the 
straw bosses—a kind of smart-Alec, Red Hawley—went a 
little too far, though. He sent Bud to Ashland over forty 
miles away to get a crosshaul, and the kid didn’t know no 
better than to start out to go after it. 
But he caught on, I guess, pretty soon after he got into 
town, and so what he done was, he just kept on lookin’ for 
that crosshaul all winter. And in the spring he got a lawyer 
and the two of em come out to camp and presented Hawley 
with a bill for Bud’s expenses in town that winter and his 
wages, and some entertainment thrown in, and the cost of 
legal services and advice, and Red had to foot the bill. He’d 
sent Bud to town to look for a crosshaul and that’s what Bud 
had been doin’, and so he didn’t have no comeback, but had 
to pay it out of his own pocket. Red didn’t stick around very 
long after that but went off somewhere else to another camp, 
I guess. And Kangley got to be one of the best men in camp, 
just about as good at anything he’d turn his hand to, and big 
and strong like an ox, and equal to about six ordinary loggers. 
And then, Shot Gunderson I mentioned before; he was a 
good friend of mine, but pretty near too fond of hunting for 
a real logger—though he was pretty steady, too. I know one 
time when we was loggin’ up there he went out and caught a 
bear one Sunday and brought him home and trained him for 
a saddle bear. In the fall there for a couple of months, before 
the cold weather set in, he could have pretty good sport with 
him. But one time he went out huntin’ bear with some of the 
other fellows from camp and he was ridin’ this saddle bear—

-P-A-G-E-91
    
SOME OF PAUL’S MEN 75 
Molar is what he had named him—and that time the fight 
got to be pretty fast and furious, I guess. Anyway Shot lost 
his gun and had to get off and find it, and when he got back 
up on Molar’s back he noticed he wasn’t so gentle as he always 
generally was, and Shot didn’t know what had got into him. 
But he toned down after a while, and Shot killed several of 
the other bear, and it wasn’t till the huntin’ party got home 
and Shot went to put Molar up for the night that he noticed 
it wasn’t Molar at all but one of them wild bears that he’d 
rode home. 
Must of in the fight got mixed up someway; and Molar 
must of been mistaken for a wild bear and been killed. I 
know Shot felt pretty blue for a while. 
Of course that’s where Shot Gunderson got his name from, 
that he was such a good shot and such a fine hunter. I don’t 
believe I ever knew what his right name really was. 
And then besides Shot Gunderson and Kangley, there was 
Charley Dobey, and Red Jack, and Blue-Nose Parker, and 
Batiste Joe, and a number of others that was about as good 
loggers as you’d ever want to find. 
Batiste Joe was a Frenchman Paul’d had workin’ for him 
ever since he was loggin’ down around Lake Houghton and 
into the Muskegon River. 
Joe generally took care of takin’ the logs out for Paul, 
and done the scalin’, and he was the best river-boss Paul ever 
had. 
He was good, all right. The inspectors and buyers couldn’t 
get ahead of him. I always wished I’d had a head on me 
like that fellow had. When he was there Paul didn’t have to 
worry but what he’d get the best end of the deal all right.
-P-A-G-E-92
  76 PAUL BUNYAN 
Course the equipment Paul had was A-1—Joe couldn’t of 
done much without good equipment. Like when it come to 
scalin’ logs, f’rinstance. If they was too short, Joe just hitched 
the Blue Ox on ’em and pulled ’em out longer, and if they 
was too small through at the same time, he just had Babe 
pull out the butt end a little, and that made ’em bigger at 
the same time as makin’ ’em longer, naturally. But Joe 
couldn’t of done that without extra good equipment. 
One time Paul had a drive on that he was sendin’? down 
to Bay City. Batiste Joe was river-boss that spring, and on 
the way down he was arrested on a false charge of havin’ 
stolen logs in his raft. Well, they took him into a court and 
the judge and lawyers started in on him, the way they do. 
But don’t you believe them lawyer sharks could put anything 
over on Joe. All he knowed was they was Paul’s logs. You 
might as well try to budge one of the Rocky Mountains as 
get Joe rattled; he’d been drivin’ the white-water too long 
to let their noise bother him any. 
“They is all Paul Bunyan log,” says Joe. “I know ’em by 
ze mark.” 
“What mark?” roars one of the lawyers. “We didn’t see 
no mark on ’em. That’s just what’s the trouble. They ain’t 
got no mark—a lot of ’em hasn’t.” 
“All ze time I know Paul Bunyan log, 
all ze log with ze bark on they is Paul’s—” 
“And what about the ones with the bark off?” yells the 
lawyer, pickin’ him up quick. “What about them, then?” 
“All ze log with ze bark off,” says Joe, “all ze log with 
ze bark off, they is Paul’s too—I have all Paul Bunyan log 
in my boom.” ”? says Joe. “For

So then of course they had to let him go, and he went on 
down and sold the logs for Paul. 
Oh, some of the Frenchmen’s smart all right. Joe sure 
had a good head on him. He wasn’t like the other one we 
had, that Pete Legoux. I told about how he dropped the 
anchor for Paul once in the bottom of the lake, I guess, and 
I sure don’t know why Paul didn’t give him the sack the first 
day. I guess maybe he thought the men would have some fun 
with Pete. They had to have some fun in camp, and Paul 
maybe didn’t care, one more or less on the payroll and to feed 
wouldn’t make much difference. 
But Pete thought he was some guy all right. 
“Paul he should let me drive ze log,” he says. “Paul he 
wer’ queer guy. He say, ‘Drop ze hank’! and I drop ze 
hank’, and then, by Gar, he get mad. Paul Bunyan ought to 
let me drive ze log, yah? Nobody good reever man like me. 
I can run on log and jump on log—fast. Like leetle animal 
wi’ tail over hees head—wha’ you call leetle animal wi’ tail 
over hees head—run up tree so fast?” 
“Cow,” says Charley Nordstrom. ‘“That’s what you’re 
thinkin’ of, Pete, I guess.” 
“Oh, yah, cow. Cow is what I’m like. Pete Legoux he just 
like ze cow on ze log. So fast he can run.” 
Charley Dobey was the one that was generally left in 
charge when Paul had to go in town for a few days or go 
down on the ranch or go and contract for grub or somethin’ 
like that. I guess he knowed more about Paul’s business than 
anyone else around there. Charley and I was mighty good 
friends all the time we was in camp together. 
One reason Paul liked him so well, I know, was because
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  78 PAUL BUNYAN 
of the way he could fiddle. Charley was a fine fiddler. He’d 
sit there in the bunkhouse all evenin’ sometimes and fiddle 
away, and it was mighty fine to listen to the way he’d keep 
time with his foot all the time. Them old tunes used to sound 
mighty nice, and then sometimes Windy would sing some of 
em, and we’d all join in. If Charley happened to get on a 
loose puncheon in the floor so the noise he made with his foot 
would be almost as loud as the fiddlin’ and the singin’, we 
wouldn’t any of us think of quittin’ till the straw boss would 
come in and blow out the lights. Paul used to think Charley 
was just about right—because he knowed if he could keep 
the men contented that way, loggin’? would go much better 
and he wouldn’t ever have no trouble keepin’ his crews. I 
didn’t never understand why Paul didn’t try to get Charley 
for a son-in-law instead of Ole. But then of course Charley 
wasn’t the size Ole was. 
Ole the Blacksmith was the only man in camp that could 
swallow one of Sourdough Sam’s soda biscuits whole, and 
most generally he could do it in one bite, though sometimes 
he’d have to take two or three. He always ate thirty-seven 
eggs for breakfast, and a stack of hotcakes four foot high, 
and bacon that was the lee side of a hog weighin’ six hundred 
pounds, and generally four pails full of coffee. He was the 
nearest to Paul’s size of any of the men, though then he 
didn’t come near bein’ as tall as Paul by about two and a 
half axhandles and wasn’t anywheres near as strong or as 
quick, of course. But I reckon, at that, Ole was the best man 
Paul had, all right. 
   
-P-A-G-E-95
PAUL BUNYAN’S 
WIFE     
: WAS in camp two 
or three years before I ever knowed Paul had a wife but there 
was a Mrs, Paul all right, though I never got to know her so 
very well, for she didn’t use to come out to camp so very 
often after I went to work for Paul. But I guess before that, 
when she was young, she used to come out real often. But 
after she got along a little older she stayed at home pretty 
close and worked on the farm, I guess. 
Blue-Nose Parker told me one day how somebody was 
tellin’ him how Paul first got hold of her. 
It happened when Paul had a small camp on the Coulonge, 
one of his first, I guess. Him and one of the men was out 
gradin’ a new road they was puttin’ in when they heard a lot 
of hollerin’ down by the Big Rapids. 
“Sounds like a woman,” Paul says. “That’s too loud for
-P-A-G-E-96
  80 PAUL BUNYAN 
wildcats. We better see if we can help her.” 
And they both of ’em run over as fast as they could, and 
there was Carrie McIntie runnin’ up and down the bank and 
callin’ for help so you could hear her for ten miles away and 
her sister was just goin’ over the falls and strugglin’ manfully 
to get out, but it wasn’t no use. Paul he didn’t lose no time, 
he’d held onto his shovel and quick as a wink he started 
throwin’ in dirt just above the girl and when Carrie seen his 
idea she pitched in and quit hollerin’ and began throwin’ in 
logs and rocks and anything she could get hold of and before 
you could say Jack Robinson they had a dam there that held 
the water back so’s the girl could wade ashore on dry land. 
You didn’t have to hit Paul on the head with a sledge- 
hammer to make him see how quick Carrie was to get his 
idea, and the way she could handle them rocks and logs he 
knowed she’d make the right kind of a wife for a logger. 
And she’d be big enough too, he figgured, when she got her 
growth, for she was young yet. And so he up and asked her 
right there. 
Carrie came over to the other side of the river, where Paul 
was, and after she kicked the dam out so the boom of logs 
down below wouldn’t go aground, she said, “Sure”; and so 
they were married. And that’s how Paul got his wife. 
And she was of about a size to match himself when she 
finally got growed up. It took thirteen Hudson’s Bay blankets 
to make her a skirt, and the sail of a full-rigged ship to make 
a waist for her. 
And for shoes she’d just step into an extra big moose hide 
with each foot and then the shoemaker would sew it up round 
her ankle. He used to have to set down his box of tools six
-P-A-G-E-97
  PAUL BUNYAN’S WIFE 81 
times on the way round, markin’ with chalk each time, so 
he could know where to begin again after dinner. 
When Paul had his macaroni farm down in Wisconsin, his 
wife split most of the rails for fencin’ it in. 
But she kicked about that, though. She wasn’t no ox, she 
said, and so she wasn’t goin’ to split the rails for that farm— 
not the whole lot of ?em anyway—and she made Paul hire 
three French-Canadians to help her. 
The Canadians contracted to split goo rails a day, but Mrs. 
Paul workin’ alongside of ’em, split 4756 the first day they 
went to work. 
She was goin’ pretty fast and they couldn’t keep her in 
sight at all, but the last rail she split, her ax stuck in a 
splinter and she had to call on one of the Canucks to come 
and get it out for her. 
Well, he worked away for a while and finally he got it 
out all right, but then he noticed there wasn’t no head on the 
ax—only the handle—and he went to look for it and he found 
it in the first rail she’d split that mornin’, so here she’d been 
splittin’ all day without no head on her ax. 
And she could run too. She kept chickens and cows on the 
farm and she had a dog, Quick, that she used to sic after the 
cattle, before Teeny got big enough so she’d always fetch 
?em for her. 
Quick was a good dog and deserved his name all right, but 
he wasn’t so quick but what Mrs. Paul would always be 
ahead of him and show him how to run when he was running 
after the cattle. 
“Come, Quick! Come, Quick!” she’d holler and she’d run 
before him through the meadows and across the ditches and
-P-A-G-E-98
82 PAUL BUNYAN 
alongside the brush-tracts and that way he’d bring the cows 
in for her night and morning. 
She must of been pretty hot-tempered too, when she was 
young. She’d come out to camp sometimes and she’d flirt with 
the men and then she’d get mad at ’em and throw ’em around. 
One time she was kind of sweet on one of the cooks Paul 
had, a man by the name of Chambers, and then I don’t know 
what happened, he kind of quit bein’ sweet on her, and she 
got mad and went in there one evenin’ behind the stove where 
he was workin’, and she give it to him, I can tell you. 
And then after a little when she got tired and let up a bit 
he thought he’d try kindness on her and see what effect gentle 
words would have on her, and so he said: 
“You know, [ve been thinkin’, dearie—” 
And then I tell you she did get mad. There was a frypan 
of potatoes standin’ there on the stove and she grabbed that 
up and went after him with it and give him a swipe over the 
head so the potatoes rained around him like a Nebraska hail- 
storm. 
“Don’t you dare ‘dearie’ me,” she yells. 
And then she give him a few more, and pretty soon the 
bottom had flew out of the frypan and only the rim was 
hangin’ round his neck with the handle of it hangin’? down 
in front. 
“There!” she says, “now you’ve got a standup collar and a 
necktie too, and now are you satisfied, you lyin’ deceiver you?” 
And with that she stalked away and left him. 
But I guess after that she kind of lost the taste for flirtin’ 
with the men, and didn’t use to come around the camp so 
much no more. And she was gettin’ older and got steadied
-P-A-G-E-99
  
PAUL BUNYAN’S WIFE 83 
down a good bit too, I guess. But she used to come out some- 
times, and we was generally glad to see her, and Paul always 
treated her real nice. 
I know one time when I was workin’ for Paul up there in 
Wisconsin she and some lady friends of hers come out to visit 
the camp, and they had dinner with the men in the cook-shack 
and seemed to have a real good time, lookin’ around at things 
and watchin’ the men work, and sittin’ around sewin’ part 
of the time, and they stayed most of the afternoon. And then 
just when they was gettin’ ready to start for home a storm 
come up and it started in to rain, although it had been nice 
the whole afternoon before. 
They had come down on a flatcar on the loggin’ train and 
they was all goin’ to get soakin’ wet, but Paul knowed what 
to do. He uncoupled the engine from the train and hitched 
Babe onto the flatcar and started him down the track on a good 
brisk walk, and naturally they went so fast they missed every 
raindrop and didn’t get wet at all, and so got home dry shod. 
“No sense to lettin’ the ladies get their feet wet,” Paul says, 
“when we can fix it that easy.” 
And Mrs. Paul had a set of false teeth, I remember, that 
she was all-fired proud of, and then she was mighty fond of 
chicken too. Down on the farm she could have all she wanted, 
and she generally used to clean two and a half dozen every 
night, they said, to have ready for breakfast next mornin’. 
But when she come out to camp Paul always had to ship in a 
few hundred dozen to have for her entertainment while she 
was there. 
One time, when she was out one Saturday, she was down 
by the river watchin’ a boom of logs the men was workin’ on,
-P-A-G-E-100
  84 PAUL BUNYAN 
and she wanted to go out on one of the logs just to see if she 
could do it, just for fun, she says. 
And while she was out there on the end of the log, she hap- 
pened to sneeze, and ker-plunk! went both her jaws of false 
teeth in the water. 
Well, there was considerable screamin’ and yellin’, I can 
tell you, and Mrs. Paul was cryin’, for the first time in her 
life, they said, for she didn’t never expect to see her teeth 
again, and they had been made special for her by Krupps’ 
Iron Works, in Germany, and she didn’t know how she’d ever 
get ’em replaced. Nobody couldn’t go out and get them, be- 
cause the men’s boots, though they was high, wasn’t high 
enough for anybody to wade out that far. 
Well, about that time Paul come along, and Mrs. Paul 
was there, wailin’ and screamin’ of course: “Oh, my teeth! 
my teeth!” 
And Paul stood there lookin’ down at the teeth layin’ down 
there at the bottom of the river with the water ripplin’ over 
them, and he stood scratchin’ his head for a while, and then 
finally he goes away without sayin’ a word, and pretty soon 
we seen him comin’ down the road with a piece of cable in 
one hand and somethin’ else in the other, and when he come 
nearer, we seen it was a chicken drumstick. 
Well, everybody was watchin’, and wonderin’ what he 
was goin’ to do, naturally, and listenin’ to Mrs. Paul wailin’ 
around. 
And what Paul done was, he just went ahead and fastened 
that drumstick he’d brought to the piece of cable and then 
went out on the log and lowered it in the water right in front 
of the teeth, and when them teeth sees that drumstick they

PAUL BUNYAN’S WIFE 87 
just naturally snaps right onto it. And Paul hauled ’em up, 
and so then Mrs. Paul was all fixed again. 
Paul had a daughter, Teeny, that maybe I’ve mentioned 
before, and also a son. Mrs. Paul gave the boy an ax to play 
with one day and he cut his teeth on it. Paul told me himself 
that he didn’t hardly dare to look at the boy when he was 
down at the ranch, because every time he looked at him he 
seemed to of growed a foot taller. 
Teeny, the girl, used to be around the camp a good deal 
when she was little, they said, and I guess the men used to like 
her, for she was a mighty cute little thing. And one time she 
saved her father’s life. 
Paul was tryin’ out a new circle saw in his shingle mill one 
forenoon and was so interested he forgot to come in when the 
dinnerhorn blowed, and they sent Teeny out to look for him. 
Well, she found him, but the sawdust was up over his ears 
already, and it was pilin’ up so fast he come pretty near bein’ 
choked to death, and she dug him out all by herself, by tun- 
nelin’ under first and lettin’ in some air, and then diggin’ away 
the tunnel. 
Paul was mighty proud of her for it. “Dug in and had her 
father out in just no time,” he said. 
Once he give her the job of bringin’ home the eggs for the 
camp for a couple of seasons. She generally planted the egg- 
plant on a hill, and then she could roll home on the eggs and 
have ’em all beat up when she got there, ready to go in the 
cake, and then she’d always take the shells back and have ’em 
re-filled again for the next time. 
And she had some hens too, to lay eggs for her. One time 
she got an egg so big they had to flatten it on both ends to get

it through the cook-house door. 
  PAUL BUNYAN

THE BUCKSKIN 
HARNESS 
  = SUPPOSE everybody’s 
seen 1 pictures of the big es loads we used to haul in the woods 
in the old times. Loads piled up, ten or twelve rows of logs 
on top of each other, and the teamster standin’ alongside the 
load, and the top log way up in the air there above his head, 
and I can tell you them pictures ain’t no exaggeration nor 
nothin’ out of the ordinary. Three or four times as high as a 
man’s head Pve seen them loads many times. Naturally you 
had to have a good top-loader to get ’em that high, but that 
was the top-loader’s business to be a good top-loader, and if 
he knowed what he was about he knowed how to build ’em as 
high as you’d a mind to have em, 
In Paul’s camp, though, we had ’em higher’n any you could 
ever of seen in any of the pictures. They used to be so high 
we had to have a telephone to phone up to the loader, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  90 PAUL BUNYAN 
noon-time they always sent his dinner up to him in a balloon. 
Generally he used to write a letter before he went up in the 
mornin’ to send to his mother in case he shouldn’t never come 
down again. 
Course they couldn’t of drawed them big loads if it hadn’t 
of been for the buckskin harness that was invented about that 
time. That come in just before Paul went into Minnesota to 
log in them big white pine woods there. He used to hitch up 
Babe by Lake Vermilion and then the logs would be drawed 
down to Duluth or Two Harbors in one pull. 
Everybody knows how buckskin stretches when it gets wet, 
and then shrinks all up to nothin’ almost when it gets dry and 
warm in the sun. Well, that’s the principle the buckskin har- 
ness was invented on, and the same as with many inventions, 
I guess, it was invented practically by pure accident. Look at 
the way Watt invented the steam engine, just watchin’ an old 
teakettle boil. | 
But I was goin’ to tell about the buckskin harness, and: the 
way that come to be invented was, one of the bull-cooks was 
goin’ to haul the wood in for the cook-house stove. They’d 
used up all the wood that was near by already, and so he had 
to go out a good ways out in the woods to get it. The cook was 
a pretty cranky feller and he’d told him he’d better bring 
home something dry that would bi if he knowed what was 
good for him, and so the bull-cook took his ox and went away 
over to the south of the camp bs the burnt-over land was. 
Figgured some of them burnt tr nks would be dry on the 
inside anyway. It was rainin’ pitchforks that mornin’ and 
nothin’ couldn’t happen to be dry 
or chance. on the outside by any way 
 
-P-A-G-E-107
  
THE BUCKSKIN HARNESS 91 
  Babe, and he had a bran new buckskin harness on him. 
And so when he got there he cut down a couple of dozen 
burnt trees and put the logs on the sled and then he starts out 
for home with ’em, over the trail. First part of it was just 
kind of a narrow sled-track through the woods, but about half 
way that road turned out on one of the big main loggin’ roads. 
He was glad he hit that part of the road and from there on 
he drove a little faster, walkin’ along beside the ox and not 
botherin’ to look back any. And course it was rainin’ all the 
time hard as ever. 
Well, when he got to camp it was about noon, and he drove 
his ox up right close to the door back of the cook-house, and
-P-A-G-E-108
92 PAUL BUNYAN 
then when he turned around he seen he didn’t have no load at 
all, but the harness was stretched out all the way down the 
road to the big tree where the turn was, where the log trail 
went into the woods, and he knowed his load of stove wood 
must be somewheres down there behind the tree standin’ there. 
He was just goin’ to start back and get it when the dinnerhorn 
commenced to toot, and he calculated he might as well go in 
and eat his dinner and go and tend to his load afterwards. 
“That'll be the best thing I can do,” he says. 
And then while he was eatin’ his dinner and while all of 
the rest of us was eatin’ dinner, the sun come out. 
And s0, in about fifteen minutes, when the bull-cook come 
back out again, there was his load of wood standin’ there right 
in front of him, and pretty near climbin’ up on the old ox’s 
back, so he had to holler for help and hurry and cut him loose 
before it went right up on top of him. 
You know, what happened was, when the sun come out, 
that buckskin harness had begun to shrink. And that’s how it 
had pulled the load up by itself, without the ox doin’ no 
pullin’ at all on his part. | 
One of the cookees called Paul to see it, and Paul took out 
a patent on the harness, and the buckskin harness was used 
for all long hauls in Paul’s camp ever since. A fine invention, 
you see, that come about that way, only the sun hadn’t dried 
out the wood enough, and the cook swore at the bull-cook 
just the same, like as if he hadn’t tried to do his best. 
Paul did some great loggin’ in Minnesota. Them forests up 
there was sure fine forests—stretches of pine and spruce and 
hemlock, with sometimes some white birches in between. Get 
up on a rise and you could see them all below you like a great
-P-A-G-E-109
  ocean, big dark waves where the spruce was, and light patches 
of jack pine climbin’ up on the hills, and the red willows that 
used to grow along the cricks. Paul used to climb up on Jasper 
Point sometimes just to enjoy the sight of it, and at the same 
time to make sure that the three rivers that make their start 
there was doin’ their job of keepin’ his three loggin’ operations 
apart—he’d put ’em in on purpose for that, so he wouldn’t get 
?em mixed up. They’re the Nelson-Saskatchewan, you know, 
and the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi. Jasper Point is the 
height of land between ’em. 
Paul always liked it in Minnesota, though. There was plenty 
of Swedes around all the time that he could get hold of to 
work for him whenever he wanted, and then the huntin’ was 
good in them there woods too. 
One time, I know, Paul went huntin’ spruce patridges. And 
he hadn’t got out in the woods very far yet and hadn’t been 
lookin’ around very long till all of a sudden he seen 540 of 
?em sittin’ in a row on a spruce bough, and he begun figgurin’ 
how was the best way to get ’em. 
Course he had his shotgun along and his rifle too, and with
-P-A-G-E-110
94 PAUL BUNYAN 
his shotgun he could of got ’em all, because there was just 
enough shot in the load for one shot for each patridge, but 
he didn’t like to get em that way if he could help, because he 
knowed they would be so much trouble to pick up afterwards 
each one by itself that way. 
So what he done was, he took his rifle and went over to the 
end of the limb and fired and sent the bullet right through 
the length of the limb and split it open all the way to the 
tree, and then, just as he figgured, the patridges all got their 
toes caught in the rebound in the crack he’d made and stuck 
fast. And then he reloaded his rifle, leavin’ the ramrod in, 
and shot that right through all the patridges. That way he got 
all but four that he didn’t get quite big enough a hold on to 
make ’em stick on the rod. 
He’d finished that shot, and had just turned round, when 
he seen a fine big buck standin’ there not so very far away. 
He fired his shotgun at him quick and he seen the buck tumble 
over the ledge just as he fired. 
It was such a fine carcass he couldn’t hardly wait to get 
there to.get hold of it, so he run as fast as he could to the place 
where the buck had been. Well, he run too fast. Result was, 
he run faster than the load, and got ahead of it, and got the 
whole charge of buckshot in his own back. For the buck’d 
got scared to death when he seen Paul, and hadn’t waited for 
_ the shot to reach him. 
Ole the Blacksmith come out and helped Paul back to 
camp and carried the patridges and the buck in for him. The 
buck when dressed weighed nine hundred seventy-five pounds. 
There in Minnesota, the Minneapolis millmen used to want 
peeled logs, and Paul never liked that much. Oh, there was

-P-A-G-E-112

  THE BUCKSKIN HARNESS 97 
some sense to it, I spose—would keep the logs from rottin’ if 
they had to lay in the water a long time—but not much—Paul 
always said it was nothin’ but fol-de-rol, and I think he was 
about right. Anyway, it used to make him all-fired plaguy 
mad. The way he’d peel em when he got mad, he’d just hitch 
the Blue Ox to ’em and jerk ’em out whole. Even, he didn’t 
bother to cut the trees down sometimes but just pulled ’em out 
from the top, so he got the heart out and left the limbs and 
bark standin’. That way a good deal was wasted, of course, 
and it was a lot of trouble, because he couldn’t do but one at 
a time. I don’t know how mad he would of got, but they quit 
askin’ for ?em after a while—maybe the sawmill men heard 
how Paul felt about it, and thought they’d better not ask to 
get peeled logs no more. 
What Paul liked best to do was a whole lot of trees at a 
time. There in Minnesota he got himself a long fallin’ saw 
that would reach across half a mile or more. Of course if the 
country was a little hilly or there was a hollow or rise of 
ground, it didn’t work so good, because they’d just get the 
tops of the trees that growed down in the hollows and up on 
the hills the saw would hit in the ground and get dulled on 
the rocks. Paul had to keep a gang of two hundred filers to 
keep that saw filed. And that was the saw that Paul always 
pulled one end of himself. He didn’t care who pulled the 
other end, and he didn’t care if they’d ride the saw, he said, 
if they felt like it, but what he didn’t want was for ’em to 
drag their feet—he drawed the line on that. 
Paul always liked to do things on a big scale. One of his 
ways was just to hitch Babe onto a whole section of timber at 
a time and haul it into camp and clear it off. If he got one in 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 PAUL BUNYAN 
about sundown, after the day’s work was over, he’d generally 
get it all cleared before supper. 
That was efficient so far as the time it took was concerned 
anyway. But he couldn’t of done it without Babe to haul it 
in for him. 
Like one of these here efficiency experts would say, the 
overhead cost and maintenance for Babe was high, but on 
account of low operatin’ expense and great efficiency, he was 
pretty economical camp equipment. And Paul couldn’t of 
done much without him, I know that. 
Like the time when they drove the wrong logs down the 
river and over the St. Anthony Falls; Babe just drank the 
river dry above the falls and sucked ’em all back again.

  THE WINTER OF THE 
P BLUE SNOW 
    : : a NE of the worst 
winters I ever pued in with Basle anywhere, for that matter 
—was the winter of the Blue Snow. It was so cold that winter 
that the loggers all swore blue streaks, and the snow all turned 
blue—came down blue in the first place, and then turned bluer 
after it touched the ground, too. The women down in the 
settlements used to use a little of it for blue in their blue-water, 
and whenever cows happened to get some of it along with the 
dry grass they was eatin’, they gave blue milk. 
It was sure a pretty sight too, though you couldn’t hardly 
forget the cold long enough to stop and look at it. Blue, blue 
everywhere, as far as the eye could see, stretchin’ along to the 
west in the open places, and in the woods around the trees, a 
little mound around each one with just a little hole in the 
middle around where the tree was.

The two Joe Murphys—brothers—one of ’em named Pete 
—had the job of holdin’ up the skylines in camp that winter, 
and I used to help ’em sometimes—so I seen a good deal of 
the snow—more’n my share, likely. 
It was a hard job we had, for the snow was so nearly the 
same color as the sky, that you couldn’t hardly tell sometimes 
where one left off and the other begun—like the time we was 
layin’ out the ice-road round a big hill in order to get away 
from the grade. We’d been workin’ for about a week or so, 
and then all of a sudden one mornin’ we come out and the hill 
was all gone, and all it?’d been was a big cloud we’d been 
tryin’ to work around. And that way it was hard all right, and 
walkin’ around in it up over our shoes and rubbers every day 
wasn’t what you might call comfortable neither. 
And there was the snow-snakes—that was the worst of it 
that winter. All over the ground, no matter where you went, 
there was them snakes crawlin’ around, and you couldn’t 
hardly get away from them, for they’d coil up and jump at 
you if you wasn’t careful—and a bite was almost always sure 
death. Freeze to death, naturally—and then the only thing 
that could save you was a good drink of whisky if that hap- 
pened to be handy. Otherwise you was done for and you had 
to learn to be more careful another time. 
And the little pesky frost-biters up in the hills was pretty 
bad, too, though not quite so bad as the snakes—but they'd 
worry you a lot more. 
It was sure cold that winter. It was so cold that the words 
froze in our mouths when we tried to talk and Paul had to 
send to England for a frozen word interpreter. Some of the 
combinations that come out that spring when they begun to
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  THE WINTER OF THE BLUE SNOW 101 
thaw out—lI tell you, you’d know then what somebody 
thought of you, all right. 
One fellow that talked an awful lot the words froze so 
thick around him that Paul finally had to get the Blue Ox to 
haul him out at last. And the green bull-cooks froze in their 
tracks every time Paul spoke to em. 
Yes, and it was cold inside, in the cook-shanty and the 
bunkhouse, too. If I had ’em here, I could get twenty men to 
swear if I could get one, that the coffee that was served in 
camp that winter used to be froze stone cold before the 
flunkies could get half way down the tables with it. Though, 
for that matter, that wasn’t no uncommon thing other winters. 
And the icicles on the beards used to be pretty near as long 
some of the other winters, too—it wasn’t so very different in 
that respect. 
One mornin’ Paul was goin’ to town and he went to make 
him some hot coffee before he started out, and I’ll be blamed 
if he didn’t find the coffee-pot froze solid to the back of the 
stove, and even Paul couldn’t budge it. 
Ice froze so fast that winter, it froze warm and was too hot 
to handle. And Lake Superior froze solid to the bottom. In 
the spring Paul had to haul the ice all up on the shore to thaw 
it out, and then he had to re-stock the lake with new fish. 
I know myself—just to show how cold it was—from actual 
experience; I was sittin’ by the stove one evenin’ takin’ off my 
shoes. When I went to get up to hang up my socks, I wasn’t 
able to make it without the bench I had been sittin’ on follerin’ 
me—stuck tight. And what’d happened was, somebody’d 
spilled water on it before I sat down, and it had froze solid 
to the seat of my pants, and stuck there till I could get some  
-P-A-G-E-118
102 PAUL BUNYAN 
of the boys to pry it off of me. That’s how cold it was in the 
bunkhouse actually that winter. 
And all that time Id been sittin’ right up close to the stove 
as close as I could get, and pretty near roastin’ on the front 
of me; for there was a big fire burnin’ so the stove-pipe was 
red up to the roof pretty near. 
We had to have a lot of whisky in camp that winter of the 
Blue Snow, naturally, for, like I said, that was the only 
remedy that would help in case of a bite from the snow- 
snakes. And you’d have to get it quick too—you couldn’t stand 
to stand around and wait for it very long. 
And so Paul—he was pretty nice about anythin’ like that 
and tried to take good care of his men always—had a big 
trough put up, and that was kept full all the time, and a dip- 
per hangin’ by always handy, but even that wasn’t enough. 
There used to be so many around all the time, and then besides 
it was hard to get the supply to fill the barrel, and Paul didn’t 
hardly know what to do. 
“T don’t know where to get any more from,” he says. 
But then finally something happened one day that helped 
him out. 
You see there was a fellow in camp that time called Sour- 
Face Murphy. And he was sour—sour enough to turn anythin’. 
And one day one of the cookees was peelin’ a mess of spuds in 
the sink. 
He was pretty near through and was just goin’ to take ’em 
out, when he seen all of a sudden the whole mess of peelin’s 
turnin’ sour. And he looked up to see what had happened, and 
there was Sour-Face Murphy standin’ in the door, and that’s 
what’d done it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
THE WINTER OF THE BLUE SNOW 103 
Well, he fished the peelin’s all out, and there in the bottom 
of the sink was twenty gallons of whisky as good as you’d ever 
want to get. And so Sam, the cook, went and told Paul about it, 
and Paul, who’d been wantin’ to get some whisky from some- 
wheres, and anyway was always lookin’ for new and better im- 
provements to use in camp, took Sour-Face off the load gang 
right away and turned him into camp distillery, and so we had 
all the whisky we ever wanted or had any kind of use for after 
that. And then the snow-snake trouble was better too, so there 
wasn’t any more casualties that I know of, the last part of the 
winter. 
One way that the men protected themselves from the cold 
was by raisin’ long beards. Good growths of beard was pretty 
generally the style in the loggin’ camps any time, but that win- 
ter of the Blue Snow they was extra long. They was so long 
that they covered the men pretty near all the way from the 
chin to the toes. The ends the men tucked in their boots, one 
half in each felt boot, sittin’ generally on the edge of their 
bunks to do it. Some of ’em got ’em in too tight and then there 
was danger of makin’ themselves humpbacked, but that wasn’t 
dangerous to most, because they was too long, the beards, I 
mean. Out in the woods the wind used to whistle through ’em, 
so you couldn’t hardly tell whether it was the beards or the 
tops of the pine trees that made that singin’ that you heard. 
In the spring when the weather got warm and they didn’t 
need their beards for protection no more, and they was gettin’ 
in the way anyway, the men had ’em all cut off. We used our 
axes for the first few cuts—course they had to be sharpened 
up good—and that way they could do it for each other—and 
then to finish up the job we went at it the reggelar way with
-P-A-G-E-120
    104 PAUL BUNYAN 
razors. Of course that don’t mean Paul. He couldn’t never 
use a common size razor, naturally—a good sharp scythe is 
what he always used. 
The whiskers that was cut off was all stacked up in haystacks, 
and Paul sent down for somebody to come up and make him 
a price, and one of the McAdam Mattress Company’s men 
come up and dickered for and bought the whole lot. 
I don’t know why the whiskers growed so good that winter 
unless it was the cold. Fur animals always has thicker fur in 
cold winters than in mild ones. And then the whisky the men 
drunk might of done somethin’ to it—they naturally always 
spilled a good deal. 
Well, that was the Winter of the Blue Snow, but I mustn’t 
forget the Spring of the Deep Mud that come after it, for 
where the snow’d been six foot deep that winter, the mud, 
that spring, was sixty times six foot, like the Good Book says. 
And the ice-roads stood up twenty foot out of a lake of mud 
on each side. 
That’s the way them ice-roads was, though, generally. 
Built of solid ice that way and packed down good, they 
wouldn’t melt down near so fast as the snow on the sides, and 
in the spring pretty near always they’d be standin’ up high 
that way, long after most of the other snow and sleddin’ was 
all gone. 
A warm day come about the middle of April that year and 
the soft snow melted away in just about a single day. 
There’d been a crust up on top of-it—a January thaw we’d 
had, and then a stiff freeze right after it so the crust’d formed, 
and most of the skiddin’ that winter had been done up on 
that crust. And so when it melted away quick like that in the
-P-A-G-E-121
    WE USED OUR AXES FOR THE FIRST FEW CUTS
-P-A-G-E-122

-P-A-G-E-123
THE WINTER OF THE BLUE SNOW 107 
  spring, in the places where the snow’d been deepest, the skid 
sleds was standin’ right up in the treetops the next mornin’. 
And then it kept right on thawin’ the next few days and 
I tell you the mud there got to be along that loggin’ road was 
somethin’ awful. By one of the crossin’s, especially. 
One of the teamsters was comin’ by there with a load just 
about dark one evenin’ and he slipped in right by the crossin’, 
and it wasn’t but a minute or two till he was all covered over 
way up to the cattle’s noses. 
Another teamster, about two miles further back on the 
road, heard their last bellow that they made, and so hurried 
up to help ’em. 
This teamster pried the cattle’s head out of the mud and 
got a chain around one of ’em’s horns and hitched onto that 
and started to haul. 
“Hold on there, Ed,” he hollered, “I can get you out all 
right.” ‘ 
But of course you might know what happened was, when 
he was tryin’ to haul crosswise that way, and the road slippery 
like it was, he slid off into the mud hole on the other side. But
-P-A-G-E-124
108 PAUL BUNYAN 
that automatically helped the first one out, of course, and he 
started to haul the other fellow out, but then he slipped in 
again a second time, naturally, and I don’t know how long 
that would of kept up and they might be goin’ yet, see-sawin’ 
back and forth that way, but Brimstone Bill happened to come 
along just then leadin’ the Blue Ox, and he hitched onto the 
chain halfway between the two other yokes of cattle, and so 
hauled ’em both down the loggin’ road and into camp. 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  PAUL’S HUNTING    
used to do some © great blade oa of his lueabyrjadi ae ! 
—just kind of as a side line—I think I mentioned once before 
the big gun he had, and huntin’ patridges that day. It wasn’t 
no trouble to him ever. When he went out cruisin’ of a Sunday 
he might as well take a gun along and see what he could get. 
Sort of kill two birds with one stone. He didn’t let it interfere 
with his loggin’ none. And comin’ home along the loggin’ 
road of an evenin’ if he met a pack of wolves he might as 
well get a few of ’em and get the bounty, him as well as any- 
body else. He had the Wisconsin state treasury pretty near 
broke one winter payin’ him bounties. 
The way he got the wolves was, he just scared em to death 
hollerin’ at em. He used to holler so loud when he was a kid, 
he could kill a whole pondful of bullfrogs with one holler. So
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 PAUL BUNYAN 
now when he met them timber wolves on the road he’d just 
catch ’em by the ears and holler down their throats till they 
died of fright, and then he’d tie their ears in a bow knot and 
string the carcasses over his fingers and carry ’*em home to 
camp that way for the bounty. 
For real huntin’ Paul used to load his gun with railroad 
spikes—till Jim Hill got so prosperous he bought ’em all up 
so Paul couldn’t get no more—and for small game like squir- 
rels and rabbits he generally used bits of haywire cut up in 
about inch pieces. The spikes was good because if he shot ’em 
lengthwise like he generally did they made a deep clean hole 
and didn’t cut the meat up none. 
Paul had a big huntin’ dog called Elmer that he took 
along for big game. Elmer had an extra long nose so he could 
get the scent of most anythin’, and short ears that stood 
straight out away from his head so he always could hear good. 
One winter—it was about the third or fourth winter I was 
with Paul and we was loggin’ on the south shore of Lake 
Superior, I remember—some big stories come in to camp 
about a buck that was frequentin’ the woods around there in 
upper Wisconsin and Michigan. Two of the teamsters said 
they saw him one day along the loggin’ road and if what 
they said was true, the stories we was hearin’ about him wasn’t 
exaggerated none. 
Well, Paul didn’t wait to hear the story the teamsters told 
but onct till he made up his mind he’d go out and get that 
buck. And so he loads his gun with a couple of kags of spikes 
and a barrel or so of powder and calls Elmer to follow him 
and away he goes. 
They hunted all the way down to Detroit that mornin’ and
-P-A-G-E-127
  
PAUL’S HUNTING 111 
  around by Flint and up north again, and Paul could see by 
the tracks that it was a big buck. 
About the middle of the afternoon they got hot on the 
buck’s trail and Elmer was already beginnin’ to sniff more 
interested-like and let out a bark or two, and they would of 
had the buck in no time, they was-so close to him, only just 
then an occurrence happened that delayed Paul and give the 
buck a chance to get away, for the time bein’ anyway. 
You see, one of the farmer boys that lived on one of them 
stump ranches in the neighborhood of the camps had been 
roamin’ around in the woods lookin’ for squirrels and he’d 
fell into one of that there buck’s tracks. Paul always had a 
good heart in him and naturally couldn’t leave the boy to 
drown very well there in that hole; so he stopped and fished 
him out. 
“T was just tryin’ to get on the same side of the tree as the 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  112 PAUL BUNYAN 
squirrel,” the kid says. 
And Paul had to stop for a few minutes extra to show the 
kid the proper way to hunt squirrels, and that’s how he used 
up some more time and lost the trail of the buck again for a 
while. 
‘Toward evenin’ though they succeeded in catchin’ up with 
him again and Paul brought him down with his gun with 
one shot. He was mighty proud, for it was the biggest animal 
he’d ever killed yet. About twice as big as the one he’d killed 
down on Maple River that time. 
He was standin’ there lookin’ down at the buck and thinkin’ 
what a fine shot he’d made when all at once he heard Elmer 
makin’ a queer noise, and he turned round and there was his 
faithful hound takin’ his last gasps. Paul noticed that his 
tongue was stickin’ two feet out of his mouth and his sides 
was goin’ up and down like a pair of bellows or like waves 
on the ocean. 
“Poor old dog,” says Paul. 
And he tried to help him up, but it was too late. Elmer had 
been tuckered out by the chase of that day and died of heart 
failure from overexertion. 
So Paul sat down there by Elmer for a spell feelin’ pretty 
bad, when all at once he happened to remember that now he 
was worse off than he’d thought he was before, for he 
wouldn’t know what in the world to do with all that meat, 
and now he had two carcasses on his hands instead of one. 
Just about that time, though, Mr. Armour happened to 
come along from Chicago, and Paul sold the meat to him. 
Armour give a million dollars for the buck carcass and a 
thousand dollars for the dog carcass. That was the beginnin’

HE WAS ALWAYS RUNNIN’ DOWNHILL
-P-A-G-E-130

-P-A-G-E-131
  
PAUL’S HUNTING 115 
of the Armour meat packin’ business. 
Paul hadn’t never knowed that Elmer was troubled with 
heart failure—he’d always seemed alright enough—and he 
was surprised and kind of didn’t know what to think, when 
the meat had been taken away and there wasn’t nothin’ left 
and he knowed he’d lost his huntin’ dog for good. But it had 
been a pretty fast hunt that day—all over Michigan and Wis- 
consin—and even Paul himself was still puffin’ some when 
he come into camp that night. 
Well, a few weeks after that when he’d kind of got over 
Elmer’s loss a little, he started figgurin’ on how he could get 
another dog, one that would be able to stand the pace, for he 
couldn’t afford to slow up his huntin’ none for the sake of a 
dog. Well, he got it figgured out finally. 
What he done was, he made a cross between an extra short- 
legged Dachshund and one of these here Russian wolfhounds, 
that’s got such awful long legs, you know. The pup, when he 
grew up, stood a little over seven axhandles behind and only 
two feet in front. That way, you see, like the way Paul had 
it figgured beforehand, he was always runnin’ downhill and 
didn’t have to get tired, and so it wasn’t hard on his heart. It’s 
a fact, that huntin’ dog of Paul’s could run for a week straight 
and never seem to feel it at all, but turn up fresh and smilin’ 
for his supper at the cook-shanty after the hunt was over, 
waggin’ his tail at the cook. 
Paul accidentally tried another experiment on a dog that 
come pretty near turnin’ out successful, but didn’t quite. 
He had a little terrier, Zip, that he used to take with him 
sometimes when he went out for fun of an afternoon. One 
day he and Zip was followin’ a big he-bear. The bear was 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 PAUL BUNYAN 
amblin’ along pretty fast and Zip was goin’ lickety split after 
him. All of a sudden the bear turned behind a tree, and Zip, 
who was goin’ so fast he couldn’t stop, went slam into an ax 
that Paul had left there standin’ against the tree, and just 
naturally split himself in two down the middle from end to 
end. 
Paul didn’t waste no time, but hurried up and picked up 
the pieces quick and slapped ’em together again before they 
had a chance to get cold or bleed to death, and set the dog 
back on the ground. But it was then he seen that while tryin’ 
to hurry he’d put ’em together wrong, and two of Zip’s legs 
was stickin’ up and two down. Zip started off on his two 
right legs and could run most as fast as he could on four, and 
when those two got tired he turned himself over and run on 
the other two. That way half of him could be restin’ all the 
time, naturally. 
It might of been a very good invention, only Zip’s brains 
and legs didn’t work together as well as they should of, and 
“so sometimes his two left legs would get started runnin’ back- 
wards and would run back as far as the right legs had run 
forward and the poor dog’d be back in the same place from 
where he had started from. 
For to have a big dog to run along beside the Blue Ox when 
he was draggin’ a load down the road and kind of look nice 
and be of a size to match the Ox, Paul figgured to cross a 
Saint Bernard with a Canada moose. The pup was a big one— 
about the size of a good-sized steer when he was born—and 
Paul had him nursed on bear’s milk so he’d grow fast. 
He was a pretty dog, with a broad forehead like a moose, 
and gentle eyes and a blackish-blue nose and long brown hair
-P-A-G-E-133
  
PAUL’S HUNTING 117. 
  and quite a nice round back with a good layer of fat under it. 
He would certainly of looked nice when he’d got a little 
bigger, trottin’? down the ice-roads between the trees behind 
the Blue Ox, or a little in front of him maybe, if he felt like 
it, but Paul had bad luck with that dog. It was too bad. You 
could hardly think it would of happened that way. After an 
extra big dinner of bear’s milk one day that pup was drowned 
fallin’ through six foot of ice on Lake Superior. And Paul 
never felt like tryin’ to get a road dog again after that. 
But the dog of Paul’s that everybody knowed best was 
Nero, the one he kept in camp always, and he was sure a fierce 
brute. Paul had that dog, I know, as long as I knowed him, 
and I don’t know but what he took him to Alaska with him
-P-A-G-E-134
ee re rae ere ne 
118 PAUL BUNYAN 
when he went up there. 
The oldtimers used to scare the young farmer boys and 
student bull-cooks that come to camp by tellin’ them that Paul 
kept that dog to sic on the swampers in the spring when they 
had a winter’s pay comin’, so they wouldn’t dare ask for their 
money, but would be glad enough just to get out of the way 
with their lives. But of course that wasn’t so, anyone might 
know that. 
Paul was a kind-hearted man, and a fair and square boss 
if he was anythin’, and he wouldn’t of held a man’s wages 
back on him, nor he wouldn’t sic a dog onto him neither. What 
Paul kept Nero for was to feed the watch peddlers, and the 
coffee and hardware drummers, and the camp inspectors to 
when they come to camp. Paul kept Nero fierce on purpose so 
he’d have a good appetite for them pests, and he growed 
fiercer because he ate ’em—it worked both ways naturally. 
That other dog, Skookum, that could run downhill, Paul 
took West with him when he come out. I don’t know what 
ever become of him, but you?ll find the loggers all know about 
him. Ask any of ’em if they knowed Paul’s dog Skookum 
and they’ll tell you. He was a great dog all right.
-P-A-G-E-135
LOGGING     
  EL SEITE = AUL had just finished 
loggin’ Minnesota when the letter from the king come. 
The king of Sweden had heard of Paul from some of the 
Swedes that had come back after havin’ been loggin’ with 
him over here, I spose, and that’s how he happened to write 
to Paul, or maybe he had just naturally heard about him any- 
way—I don’t know, but anyway he wrote to him and asked 
him to help him out. 
He’d had a lot of onruly socialists in his country, it seems, 
and about that time they was gettin’ too many for him— 
more’n he could handle. Always wantin’ to improve things, 
he says, and never willin’ to let good enough alone. And now 
it'd got so bad it’d just about got to the point of “Ship or 
Shoot” with him—he just naturally couldn’t do nothin’ with. 
?em no more. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
   
    120 _ PAUL .BUNYAN 
He didn’t like to shoot, because that always looks bad in 
the papers, and so he figgured he’d better ship, and that’s the 
way it come he wrote to Paul. He’d heard what kind of a 
logger Paul was, of course, and his idea was to try to get him 
to clear a piece of land for him where he could send his people 
and where they could settle and be prosperous and never have 
to come back. 
Well, Paul got the letter one afternoon when the tote- 
teamster brought the mail, and I guess he could tell by the size 
and by the gold trimmin’ all around it that it was somethin’ 
important. And so he got the timekeeper to read it to him 
like usual and then when they’d read it they read it through 
again, and then Paul says, “Sure, I guess I can do that all 
right.” 
And then he went over to Charley Dobey and he says to 
Charley: ‘What do you think of that country we seen when 
we was out cruisin’ last Sunday? That ought to suit em, don’t 
you think? Here’s the letter,” he says. “That’s what I’m 
talkin’ about.” 
And when Charley’d got through readin’ it, Paul says to 
him, “I’m goin’ to have you write the answer for me. I ain’t 
goin’ to have Johnny Inkslinger write it. He goes too fast.” 
That chief clerk of Paul’s sure was a fiend for speed and 
economy. One winter he left off dottin’ his i’s and crossin’ 
his t’s and saved nine barrels of ink that way. He wrote with 
a fountain pen that he had connected up with a barrel of ink, 
so he could go right on and never stop till the barrel was 
empty, and then only for a minute or two while he changed 
the hose. And every time he charged the men for tobacco or 
socks from the commissary he used a split pencil to double 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  
LOGGING NORTH DAKOTA 121 
charge their accounts, and so made money for the boss. And 
Johnny was sure the speediest at mixin’ up a walk for a feller 
of anybody I ever saw, and you know, I guess, most of ’em 
was pretty swift at that. 
But Paul didn’t want Johnny to write this letter for him, 
because he was afraid he would go too fast and make a mis- 
take, and so he got Charley to write it for him. Charley could 
write and cipher about the best of anybody in camp, and he 
was always the one that the men used to get to write their let- 
ters for ?em, when they was sick or in trouble or had to write 
to their girls or somethin’. Sometimes he’d be busy all Sunday 
afternoon that way. They could always trust Charley because 
he never had anything to do with the girls and they knowed 
he wouldn’t try to take ’em away from em, like some of them 
that wrote letters for the others always used to try to do. 
Charley was a partikkelar friend of mine and he showed me 
the letter he wrote to the king that time for Paul, and it went 
somethin’ like this if I remember right: 
DEAR KING: 
Answeriw to your letter about a place for them sub- 
jects of yours. Everybody knows the proper place for 
Swedes is North Dakota. I can use ’em in my loggin’. 
If I put Babe on the job it wowt take long. I want 
400,000 more please. Course the logs won?t do you no 
good so Pll keep em. Begin next week. 
Yours truly, 
PAUL BUNYAN.

-P-A-G-E-138
    122 PAUL BUNYAN 
Charley had to write the name in for him, and drawed a 
picture of the Blue Ox for a kind of trade-mark, and Paul 
made just an X under his name, for Paul couldn’t read nor 
write. He hadn’t never learned, for I guess he hadn’t never 
went to school more than that one half day that time. But 
most times it didn’t make no difference anyway—a man can 
be a pretty good lumberjack even if he don’t know how to 
write. For keepin’ his accounts Paul generally made notches 
in a tree outside the cook-shanty door, and when he wanted 
anything he most generally made a picture of it and got it 
that way. 
But one time he made a pretty bad mistake, thongh—that 
was the time when the double-jawed feller had chawed up 
the camp grindstone. Paul was goin’ to send for one and he 
made a picture of it and gave it to the tote-teamster to bring 
out for him. 
Well, when the tote-teamster come back and we went 
through all the things he’d bought there wasn’t no grindstone 
there, but down on the bottom there was a great big cheese, 
that nobody didn’t seem to’ve ordered. And so we knowed 
something was wrong. 
What'd happened was, when Paul made the picture of the 
grindstone he forgot to put in the square hole in the middle 
of it, and so that’s how they’d come to make a mistake and 
thought it was a cheese instead. 
Well, that was one time. But generally it was all right, 
and Paul got what he wanted without no trouble. He wasn’t 
mad, neither, that time. Just laughed, and thought it was a 
pretty good joke on himself. Paul was a pretty good-natured 
man, most times, unless somebody made him mad by not

LOGGING NORTH DAKOTA 123 
knowin’ nothin’, like Pete Legoux. 
Well, Paul didn’t have but the one winter to clear North 
Dakota in, and the loggin’ he did there was as great loggin’ 
as I ever seen him do. Course he used more new-fangled 
methods afterwards and bigger maybe, but never no better; for 
that was a fine camp we had, and some fine loggin’ that was 
done there in North Dakota. 
“Pm goin’ to do a good job,” he says. “Seein’ as how the 
king’s heard I can log, we’re goin’ to do some real loggin’ 
this time, and we’re goin’ to have a camp, too.” 
And we did, all right. The Pyramid Forty’d been great, and 
loggin’ in Minnesota hadn’t been no slouch neither, but it 
wasn’t nothin’ compared to this camp in North Dakota. That 
was ten times bigger’n anything he’d ever done before, and a 
good number of times better. 
The plan for the camp was pretty much the same as he’d 
always used. Nothing much new, or new-fangled, but only 
a good deal bigger. 
The hotcake griddle, f’rinstance, was just like the hotcake 
griddle we’d had in Michigan, and he got it from Moline 
again, but he drove Babe on the run comin’ to camp and so 
got much more speed in it this time, so when it come to spin- 
the-plate it made a much bigger furnace for under itself than 
it had done before, and set itself down in the ground quite a 
good ways too—and that made it better, naturally. 
Paul had six concrete-mixers put up around it and a sixty- 
foot tank for each mixer for a reservoir, and traveling cranes 
to put the batter in with, and he had an engine and a steam 
whistle to give the signal when the flunkies was to get out of 
the way.
-P-A-G-E-140
124 PAUL BUNYAN 
Instead of twenty men with slabs of bacon on their feet 
skatin’ around greasin’ the griddle, Paul had eighty now— 
most of ’em niggers, because bein’ from Africa they could 
stand the heat better. Though a few of ’em wasn’t swift 
enough like they should be. The minute the whistle blowed 
it was up to them flunkies to get out of the way, or, the way 
that batter poured in—well, sometimes we just naturally had 
a raisin in the hotcake, that was all. 
After a while, a little ways along in the winter, they didn’t 
make them big hotcakes no more, but made a whole lot of 
- little fellows instead, and that was better. They was handier 
in a good many ways, too. The cook would string ’em up on 
haywire, f’rinstance, and make ’em up in rings, and then the 
waiters could ride along on horseback and sling a bunch to 
each man as they galloped along. 
That way we could make much better time at breakfast 
and always be out in the woods long before daylight. Some 
of the men used to say Paul thought so much of them, that 
that’s why he had to get ’em up in the middle of the night 
to feed ’em. 
Many’s the time, let me tell you, I’ve seen the stars go down 
and the sun come up out in the woods. That was the regular 
thing in the old camps always. Some of the men tried to get 
Paul to put up another moon so’s they could see to chop on 
both sides of the tree, but they couldn’t never get him to do 
that, though. 
Yes, and then about the hotcakes. Babe used to be fond of 
them little fellers too. Seems like he could get his tongue 
round ’em better and he was gettin’ crazier and crazier for hot- 
cakes all the time. We might of knowed how it would end

up, but naturally we didn’t, then. 
The stove in the cook-house in the camp in North Dakota 
was so big it took three acres of timber every day to keep the 
fire goin’ in it. One day one of the cooks put some bread in 
the oven and went round to the other side to look at it, but it 
was so far around it’d baked and burned to a crisp before he 
could get there. And another time another one of Sam’s help- 
ers got lost between the flour bin and the root cellar and would 
like to of starved to death if somebody hadn’t found him. 
The tables in the dinin’ room was covered with brown oil-
-P-A-G-E-142
  126 PAUL BUNYAN 
cloth, and was so long that Paul had to have waiters on roller- 
skates to get the food down to the lower end before it would 
be all eaten up by them that was lucky enough to be at the 
upper end of the table. They had fish-nets to put the knives 
and spoons in to swab ’em round and wash ’em, and Sam 
always used a pitchfork to feel and see if the spuds was done. 
There was one feller whose job it was to drive the salt and 
pepper wagons around the tables. He’d generally start out in 
the mornin’ and get to the lower end at night, and he’d be 
ready to start back next mornin’ again. That way he could 
make three trips a week. And a brother of his used to drive 
the saleratus wagons—that is one of ’em that did—there was 
four in all drivin’ for Sam—and another brother from the 
same family had the job of pointin’ the toothpicks. 
Paul didn’t find no hot spring handy in Dakota to cook the 
pea-soup in, the way he’d done back in Wisconsin, but there 
was a lake there not so far from the camp and he fired the 
slashin’s around it, after he’d dumped the oxen and peas in, 
and it cooked just about as good—and of course, then there 
was more of it. The cookees sailed Mississippi stern-wheelers 
around in the lake to keep the soup stirred, and Paul had 
pipes put in and piped to different parts of the woods under 
ground so they could have artesian wells almost anywheres 
in the state and get the soup when they wanted it. The 
Standard Oil’s got some of them pipes now. 
So you can see then how everything was bigger in this camp 
than Paul had ever had before. But there was one thing Paul 
tried to have bigger that he got too big, though, so he couldn’t 
use it on account of that—or only once anyway. And that was 
the dinnerhorn. It was so big that the first time Paul blowed
-P-A-G-E-143
  
LOGGING NORTH DAKOTA . 127 
  on it he felled four acres of timber, and afterwards when he 
blowed straight up in the air he filled pretty near the whole 
Mississippi valley with wind and he didn’t dare blow no more. 
It was an entire total loss—and all the tin and all the labor 
Ole had put on it. Paul sent it East, where they used it for a 
tin roof on the railroad depot in Washington. 
Like he had before, Paul had all the flour and beans and 
peas and prunes shipped in to camp by the trainload, but he 
had a cattle ranch up in Alberta himself from where he got 
the steers for the meat. They used to get in about two thousand 
steers at a shipment. That would last the camp a day or two. 
Paul got the water for his ice-roads in North Dakota from 
Lake Superior. Used the Blue Ox always, and a tank. All them 
thousand lakes up in Minnesota is nothin’ but Babe’s foot- 
prints where he used to travel with the tank. One day Babe 
slipped and the tank tipped over and sprung a leak, and that’s 
what started the Mississippi River. Paul dug it out with a 
shovel so he’d have a good route for his log drive. Just went 
down the valley towards the Gulf of Mexico, throwing a 
shovelful of dirt on each side as he went along, and so that 
way he made the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies at 
the same time, just incidentally, as you might say.
-P-A-G-E-144
| 128 PAUL BUNYAN 
They said it was the shovel he used on that Mississippi job 
| that he wore afterwards for a watch charm, but I never be- 
lieved that myself. What I think is that it was the one he 
| used for diggin’ the Little Big Horn, that he wore. Stands 
| to reason, seems to me, it couldn’t of been the one he dug the 
Mississippi with. I spose I could just as well of asked him 
about that watch charm some time—I seen him wearin’ it 
often enough—but I never did. 
That was great loggin’ we done in North Dakota, though, 
like I said. 
Out in the woods before daylight—out among the pines. 
There was skidways all over between the trees and Paul’s 
loggin’ roads cuttin’ up the whole state nearly. And the sound 
of timber fallin’, and the call of the loggers when they’d fall 
a tree: “Tim-m-mber-er! Down the line. Watch out!” I 
can’t help it, but I always thought that a mighty pretty sound, 
and I do yet. “Tim-mm-ber! Dow-n the line!” Yes, and then 
of course, there was other sounds too—the teamsters swearin’ 
and cussin’ at their cattle, for instance—or horses—Paul used 
some horses in loggin’ off North Dakota too. And we used to 
work so fast that often we'd be skiddin’ right in front of the 
buckers, and so the buckers would have to be runnin’ along- 
side the log and it would almost be down to the landin’ before 
they’d get the last cut made. By spring North Dakota was a 
very different-lookin’ country, let me tell you. 
But of course gettin’ the timber off was easy for Paul. It 
- was when he got to thinkin’ about them millions of stumps 
that he begun to worry a little bit. Most generally he’d just 
moved on and left the stumps and manure piles and old camp 
buildin’s standin’ there.
-P-A-G-E-145
ONE BLOW WAS GENERALLY ENOUGH 
 
-P-A-G-E-146

  LOGGING NORTH DAKOTA 131 
Course he could of hitched Babe onto ’em and yanked ’em 
out, but that would be slow work and kind of tedious for the 
Ox. So he’d been figgurin’ on it for a long time, how he could 
do it. And then one day somethin’ happened which give him 
an idea. 
The way that was: Paul had four fellers oilin’ on his watch, 
two hard-grease men and two soft-grease men, and they was 
generally onto their job—I knowed ’em, all four of ’em, 
well, and they was pretty good men too—and was generally 
punctual about havin’ it wound: every Christmas and the 
Fourth of July and keepin’ it oiled up good. But that year 
they got the spring-fever or the cabin-fever or somethin’, and 
got lazy and laid down on their jobs. And the result, you might 
know, was, the watch ran a hot-box on the main bearin’ and 
the babbit melted and run down Paul’s pants leg one day, 
and it made him all-fired plaguy mad. He was standin’ near a 
big stump at the time and he hit the stump an awful blow with 
his fist while he called for them oiler fellers to come up and 
get their time, and afterwards when he’d got over bein’ so 
mad he looked down and he seen he’d knocked the stump six 
foot below the ground; and then that was what give him the 
idea. 
The next day he had one of the biggest trees we’d cut down 
in North Dakota hauled into camp with the Blue Ox and had 
Ole make him a mall, and then after that Paul’d go out for 
a couple of hours every mornin’ and knock down stumps. One 
blow was generally enough to send ’em six or eight feet below 
the surface and then the holes could be filled in afterwards 
with the scrapers, and that way in a couple of weeks he had 
the whole state cleared and smooth and that’s why you don’t
-P-A-G-E-148
  132 PAUL BUNYAN 
find no stumps in North Dakota today anywheres. 
Anywhere you look it’s just as level and fine as a table top. 
Only they say in Devil’s Lake there’s queer things come bob- 
bin’ up sometimes, and some say it’s them old stumps of Paul’s 
that come out there. Naturally, I don’t know. For one thing, 
I ain’t never been back to North Dakota since the winter I 
logged with Paul there, though I always intended to, and I 
may yet some day if things happen to turn out that way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149

STALK     
gat 11, then when Paul 
had logged all site trees off N al Dakota and pounded all 
the stumps down and got the land all cleared and smooth, he 
thought he was done and finished with the job. But then his 
other letter from the king come. The king wrote over and 
wanted to know if the soil was fertile, and he said he wouldn’t 
let the contract be called finished till Paul had proved that 
to his satisfaction. It wouldn’t be no use to send his people 
over, he said, unless the soil was good, so’s they could raise 
enough to eat and not have to starve to death or come back, 
which, like he’d said the other time, of course, he didn’t want 
em to do. 
And so Paul didn’t hardly know what to do. 
Course he himself knowed the soil was fertile—couldn’t 
hardly help but be with a stand of timber on it like that—but
-P-A-G-E-150
  134° PAUL BUNYAN 
how to prove that to the king, that was another kind of a 
job, and he was pretty considerably worried—for Paul, that 
is. And what the king asked was reasonable enough too, Paul 
thought, even though it wasn’t really in the contract, and he 
wanted to do it up right, a little more if anything rather 
than a little less, that was the way with Paul always. And so 
he had to figgur up something else to do about it. 
Course he might of sent Ole over with a sample—he car- 
ried enough around on his shoes generally—and let the king 
try it, but then Ole was needed right where he was. Babe 
might need shoein’ for one thing, and Ole was the only man 
in camp that could shoe him, and then besides there was Teeny 
—Paul didn’t want him to get away from Teeny just then. 
Paul was tryin’ to get Ole for a son-in-law, because Ole was 
about the best man he had, and he figgured if he could get 
him in the family that way he could always be sure of him 
and wouldn’t have to raise his wages none to keep him. And 
so he didn’t care to send him to a foreign country just then, 
where there might be pretty Swede girls around; but he had 
to think up some other way, if he could. 
Well, what he finally figgured out was, he’d get some 
people to swear to affidavits for him. He’d plant something 
and then they’d watch it grow and swear to how far it growed 
the first day, and how far the second day, and how far the 
third day, and so on, all legal, and then they’d send the papers 
and the measurements to the king, and that ought to satisfy 
him. 
So then when he’d got this all planned out and ready, Paul 
took a kernel of corn and went out and planted it. 
Well, Paul, like I said, knowed that the soil there was
-P-A-G-E-151
PAUL BUNYAN’S CORNSTALK : v 135 
  fertile, but not even he had any good idea of how fertile it 
was. And he hadn’t no more’n turned around to go back to 
the camp to get Ole and the other men that was goin’ to watch 
it, till that corn was up out of the ground and higher’n his 
knee already—and Paul’d planted it a good four foot deep 
in the hole he’d made with his little finger. And when him and 
Ole and Charley Nordstrom come runnin’ out there it’d grew 
clean out of sight so you couldn’t see the top at all no more. 
Paul sent Ole up right away to cut the top off so it wouldn’t 
grow no higher but it wasn’t but a minute till Ole was pretty 
near clean out of sight too. 
“Cut the top off so it’ll branch out!” Paul yells up to where 
he thought Ole ought to be by that time. “Hurry up. Be 
quick.” 
“Can’t do it, Paul!” Ole yells back. “Top no bin har. He 
grows so fast I cannint see him.” 
And Paul knowed it wasn’t no use, for pretty soon they 
couldn’t hardly see Ole no more, and Paul yells:
-P-A-G-E-152
    136 PAUL BUNYAN 
“Come on down then, Ole. Come on down!” 
But Ole couldn’t do that neither, because every foot he’d 
try to slide down, the cornstalk would carry him up three, it 
was growin’ so fast, and so he kept goin’ up and up all the 
time—good-by, Ole—and he would of starved to death if 
Paul hadn’t of got his gun and shot him up some doughnuts 
and biscuits after a while. 
And then Paul got his ax and tried to chop it down but he 
couldn’t do that neither, because he couldn’t never chop twice 
in the same place, the cornstalk was growin’ so fast, and so he 
seen that wouldn’t do. 
Charley skooted back to camp and got two of the sawyers 
to come out and bring a saw and a couple of springboards— 
that was the first time springboards was used in the woods— 
but they couldn’t do it with that neither. They got the spring- 
boards in all right, but by the time they got ready to get up 
on ’em they was too high, and they’d forgot to bring the top 
air extensions to their ladders, so that was no good. 
And Paul was sure what you’d call up a tree, only it wasn’t 
him that was up the tree but Ole, and that’s what made Paul 
feel the worst. Teeny would take on pretty hard if she heard 
how Ole was goin’ out of sight. Course he could comfort her 
with that he was goin’ in the right direction anyway, but that 
wouldn’t do her much good, for she’d rather have him on 
earth. And then besides there was his future loggin’ opera- 
tions to take into consideration, for Ole he pretty near had 
to have for his loggin’. I think Paul dropped a tear out of 
the corner of one eye just about then, but it fell near the foot 
of the cornstalk and only made it grow faster. 
So then Paul thought he maybe might get the Blue Ox and

  try to pull the corn out by the roots, but he remembered he’d 
have to put the chain around the stem and it might grow 
tight to the stem, and then when Babe’d begin to pull it might 
carry him up with it, and he’d lose his Ox too, besides his 
blacksmith and maybe son-in-law. And so then he didn’t 
hardly know what to do. 
And just about that time one of them goverment inspectors  
-P-A-G-E-156
  140 PAUL BUNYAN 
happened to come along. 
“This your cornstalk?” he says to Paul. 
“Well, I planted it,” Paul says. 
“You planted it. Well, then.” 
“T planted it,” says Paul, “but I didn’t make it grow.” 
“No matter,” says the inspector. “It’s your cornstalk. You 
will have to remove it.” 
“Uh, huh,” grunted Paul. 
“Law of Public Nuisances,” explains the inspector. “This 
cornstalk of yourn is found to be a Public Nuisance. Agricul- 
tural farmers in lower Illinois and Iowa complains of shortage 
of water for their crops. Something, they say, is sucking away 
the water from under the soil and leaving their wheat crops 
high and dry. Not only that, but steamboat men on the Mis- 
sissippi reports that the river has lowered six foot in the last 
six hours—” 
“Well, Pll be darned,” says Paul. 
“Furthermore,” says the inspector, puttin’ on a legal way, 
like they do, ‘it is my duty to inform you that your cornstalk 
has to be cut down. For investigation has proved that it is that 
same cornstalk that is causing the disturbance complained of.” 
“Yah!” Kind of snappily from Paul. 
“And the said owner of the said cornstalk is therefore di- 
rected to chop it down.” 
But at that Paul gets mad. 
“That’s what I been tryin’ to do for the last six hours, you 
fool,” he says. “Can’t you see nothin’?”” 
“Law of Public Nuisances,” keeps on the inspector. “I be- 
ing the lawfully constituted—” 
But he didn’t get no further, for by the time he got that
-P-A-G-E-157
PAUL BUNYAN’S CORNSTALK 141 
big mouthful out of his mouth he was flyin’ out over the edge 
of the field at the end of Paul’s shoe. And Paul turns back 
to the cornstalk again. 
“T got an idea,” he says after a minute, after he’d been 
lookin’ around for a little while. 
What he done was, the Great Northern had been layin’ a 
railroad through there not so very far away, and Paul got 
some of them railroad rails Jim Hill had left, and that’s what 
he done it with. There was a big pile of them steel rails layin’ 
there alongside the right-of-way and Paul just picks up a 
handful of ’em and brings ’em over to the cornstalk. He ties 
em all together in a long string and then with the help of 
the Blue Ox, that Charley had fetched, he swings ’em round 
the trunk of the.corn and ties ’em in a knot. 
With that, naturally, the corn begins to cut into itself, and 
it wasn’t long before, growin’ so fast, it’d cut itself clean 
through. With that steel rope around its neck, that cornstalk 
just naturally committed suicide, that’s what it done. 
And when it finally fell it took three days fallin’, and made 
such a wind that the Mississippi valley’s been full of wind- 
storms and cyclones ever since. 
Paul grubbed out the main part of the stump and you can 
see the hole standin’ up three thousand feet in the air to this 
day. One of the ears of corn that was pretty near ripe struck 
into the ground when it fell down and they burnt out the cob 
afterwards and had a well two hundred foot down lined on 
all sides with roasted corn, just like they got a corn beef mine 
somewheres over in Montana too, that maybe you’ve heard of. 
Well, Ole, when he seen the cornstalk was beginnin’ to 
fall, climbed out on one of the blades and when he was pretty 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  
  142 PAUL BUNYAN 
near the ground he just swung himself down like little boys 
swing down on saplings and naturally he wasn’t hurt at all. 
He told Teeny afterwards she needn’t to of worried none 
about his goin’ clean through the sky and not bein’ able to get 
back, because he had good suspenders on and they would of 
kept him from goin’ clean through to the other side. 
, And the affidavits, and the king of Sweden. Well, Paul 
didn’t get no affidavits, because nobody’d had time to take 
down any measurements, and there wasn’t none that could be 
took down anyway, but a reporter on a Kansas paper wrote 
up the story, and Paul sent the clipping from the paper to 
the king. The Swede king believed the newspaper story all 
right because it was in print, you know, and so he sent all 
the money that was comin’ to Paul, and then he sent his 
Swedes to North Dakota and.there’s where they are yet, a 
lot of ’em. 
   
-P-A-G-E-159
       a SAUL BUNYAN was mighty proud of the job he’d done loggin’ off North Dakota, and he 
used to like to stand out in front of the camp of a mornin’ and 
admire the work he’d done, and keep jinglin’ the money the 
Swede king had sent him in his pocket. 
And so one Sunday mornin’ he was standin’ like that, lookin’ 
around, and wonderin’? where he’d be loggin’ next, and 
thinkin’ what a fine country it was stretching away out there 
to the west. 
It was still early in the spring and there was a few patches 
of snow left in the low places and under the willows along the 
cricks; and other places the grass was sproutin’ already, and 
the fields just laid there, ready for the plow to come in and 
turn it over and you could plant wheat or spuds or corn or 
anythin’ else under the shinin’ sun you’d a mind to,
-P-A-G-E-160
  144 PAUL BUNYAN 
“There,” he says, “I guess that country is good enough for 
anybody, Swedes or Germans or Dutch or English—I don’t 
care who—even Irish—and I reckon I earned my million dol- 
lars all right.” 
And he was leavin’ the country, sure, as good, or a good deal 
better than he found it, and that’s more than can be said for 
a good deal of loggin’ that’s done. It’s a rotten shame the way 
they leave some of it, as if a cyclone had struck it, and never 
a stick would grow there no more. Just rocks and stumps and 
splinters, and young trees all tore up. Especially this high-lead 
loggin’ that they do out here now. 
Well, before him, like I said, was this fine green country 
he’d cleared, and behind him was the Red River of the North 
and the great broad valley both sides of it. 
The way that river happened to be red, of course, you know, 
was the ketchup Al Peterson spilt in it. Al was one of the 
ketchup-drivers for the camp that winter and he drove his 
wagon over Paul’s pipe one day that he’d laid down by the 
river bank, and so dumped his whole load. And that’s what 
made the river red. 
Brimstone Bill used to have Babe’s barn right on the bank 
of the river too. Moved it every two or three days or so. That 
is, after Paul had put him wise to the trick of doin’ it that way. 
Bill was havin’ the usual trouble, like always, keepin’ the 
old Ox clean, and so Paul says to him one day: 
“Why don’t you move the barn, Bill? It would be cheaper 
and easier than tryin’ to clean it, I’d think.” 
And so Bill did, and by the time we’d finished loggin’ in 
the spring, the Red River valley was covered plum over and 
manured six foot deep, and there ain’t no more fertile land
-P-A-G-E-161
OFF FOR THE WEST 145 
nowhere than the Red River valley of the North. 
Well, the way I was sayin’, Paul had been figgurin’ on 
where he was goin’ to go next, and so then that mornin’ he 
made up his mind. 
“P11 go West,” he says. “Reckon there’ll be loggin’ enough 
for me to do out there for a year or two anyway.” 
He’d heard about the Big Trees they had out there, and 
he’d seen the tops of some of ’em when he’d been out cruisin’ 
one Sunday, and then Ole had told him about ’em too—he’d 
seen some of ’em from the top of the cornstalk the time he 
was up. And some fellows that had come into camp from the 
West told him about some outfit that was loggin’ out there on 
the Coast on a big scale, and Paul, naturally, wanted to come 
out and show that fellow how to log. 
And so he made up his mind to go right away. 
Well, Paul happened to have his snowshoes on that 
mornin’. That may strike some folks as kind of funny, I spose, 
but Paul was always slow in layin’ ’em off in the spring. Just 
the same as he was slow givin’ up all the other things he’d used 
in the winter, too—like the loggin’ road, f’rinstance. He used 
to paint it over with whitewash when Babe objected to pullin’ 
loads over it, so’s to make him think it was still snow. 
And so it come Paul had his snowshoes and his mackinaw 
on when he started for the West that mornin’, and naturally he 
didn’t take the trouble to take ’em off, but hit right out like 
he was. 
Well, it kept gettin’ hotter and hotter, of course, as he went 
along, and he kept sweatin’ and sweatin’, and his shoes was 
gettin’ to feel pretty heavy in the dust, but he didn’t want to 
stop for nothin’. He was in a hurry, because he’d like to get in
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 PAUL BUNYAN 
Seattle for supper that night if he could. 
But there was one thing he hadn’t figgured on, and that was 
that his snowshoes would probly warp in the sun. And the 
south shoe would warp considerable more than the north shoe. 
Swingin’ his foot out that way with his south shoe warped 
the most, instead of makin’ a straight bee line from Fargo to 
Seattle the way he intended to, he went around in a great half- 
circle, so at six o’clock, when he thought he was in Seattle, he 
found he’d landed up in San Francisco instead, and it was 
nearly ten o’clock when he finally got into Seattle that night. 
On the way he’d dragged his peavey behind him awhile to 
ease his shoulder some, and that scratch he made with his 
peavey is now the Grand Canyon. Paul put his peavey back on 
his shoulder quick when he seen the rut he’d made, but it was 
too late and the damage was done already, and there’s the 
Grand Canyon, just like you see it, to this day. 
Well, there was another outfit loggin’ on the Skagit when 
he got there, sure enough, just like he’d heard reports of. 
It was a big outfit, headed by a one-eyed hooktender named 
Joe Maufree. Joe was six foot and thirty-two inches tall, and 
had only one eye, on the right side of his nose, and all he could 
see was saw-logs and choker-hooks. But it wasn’t no wonder he 
hadn’t no eye for nothin’ else when he didn’t have no other 
eye at all. Big Joe never worked with patent chokers or bull- 
hooks, they said. When the riggin’ slinger would get the logs 
hooked on the main line, Big Joe just squeezed the hooks to- 
gether by hand. 
Paul heard that Joe had just put in a yardin’ engine with 
40 inch by 20 inch cylinders, and he knew that was goin’ to 
be pretty stiff competition all right. But of course he didn’t
-P-A-G-E-163
OFF FOR THE WEST 147 
worry none. When he’d get Babe out there and really get 
started, this here Joe wouldn’t have a look-in. 
“P11 beat ?em, new-fangled methods and all,” he says. 
But if Paul was goin’ to do any loggin’ he’d have to get 
some land first because he didn’t have no land claims out here, 
and he’d have to come by it some way, and the way he done 
that was by homesteadin’, and by scrippin’. He could get a 
lot of land by scrippin’. Because he could go ahead and scrip 
some land and then when he’d get all the timber cleared off 
he could explain that he’d made a mistake and scripped the 
wrong land and go ahead and scrip some more. That way he 
could keep right on goin’. And for the homesteadin’, he didn’t 
do that himself, of course—he’d get other men to do it for 
him. He’d get fellers who didn’t care much whether they told 
the truth or not to swear that they was gettin’ timber claims 
for themselves, as homesteaders, and then he’d pay ’em fifty 
dollars for their deed, and get the land that way. Sometimes— 
like some of the other timber men did, too—he could get dead 
men to take up homesteads for him and then he didn’t have to 
pay the fifty dollars. 
Well, I was goin’ on, though. Paul was goin’ to show Joe 
how to log, and he wasn’t goin’ to let him get ahead of him, 
and so, as soon as he got his land staked out, he went back 
East and got the Blue Ox and other camp equipment. Paul 
went back to the Ottawa country where he’d left some of his 
stuff when he’d been loggin’ there a long time ago, and then 
of course the equipment he had to take out of North Dakota, 
and then a lot of new stuff from Chicago, donkey engines, and 
cable, and railroad cars, and what-not, and a lot of other new- 
fangled things he was goin’ to use. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
148 PAUL BUNYAN 
“Pll beat ?em at their own game,” he says. 
And Babe was good for freightin’ too. Just as good as for 
any other kind of woods work. 
Start from Montreal in the mornin’, dinner at Winnipeg, 
supper in Vancouver, every day, if Paul wanted to take that 
many trips, or from Minneapolis to Seattle in an afternoon. 
And when he’d come to a hill or somethin’, Babe would walk 
right through it—up to his knees in solid rock. 
That’s the way all them passes through the Cascades was 
made—Index Pass and the rest of ’em. Index Pass, I know— 
old John Maloney, who was through there freightin’, many 
times, with Paul and the Ox that time, said he told Jim Hill 
about it afterwards and so they put the Great Northern rail- 
road through there, but they never compensated Paul for what 
he’d done, though you’d think they might of. 
When Paul and Babe come to a piece of thick woods, Paul 
generally went ahead of the Ox to make a road for him, where 
the timber was thick, and it was kind of swampy—like in the 
Lake of the Woods country. He’d have his ax in his hnnd—the 
big one with the sixteen-foot cuttin’ surface and the wove 
grass handle—and he’d swing it back and forth in front of 
him as he went along and make a road for the Ox. The trees 
would just fall crosswise across the road as soon as he got past, 
big end for little end and little end for big end, and make as 
fine a corduroy as you’d ever want to see, and then the Ox 
would come along behind. 
I used to like to see *em—Paul comin’ through the woods 
that way slashin’ with his ax, with the clean timber road layin’ 
there behind him, and the streak of light showin’ through the 
dark pine trees, and the big Blue Ox comin’ along there be-

a Pap = : 
    
    hind with the load, chewin’ his cud as easy and peaceful as if 
he’d been goin’ into his barn in Paul’s camp on the Red River. 
That’s the way Paul done most of his freightin’, but some- 
times he went farther south across the plains. 
One of them times when he was crossin’ the plains was 
when the blacksnake whip was invented. 
A snake had caught in a saplin’ that Babe was draggin’ 
along stuck in his shoe, and so Paul just stopped and made a 
whip of it. He cut the snake skin up into several strips so he 
got a nice long lash to it. 
Paul didn’t never use that whip on Babe, though. But he’d 
crack it sometimes just for fun, or make it whistle. If he ever 
happened to hit a tree, that whip would cut a two-foot log 
in two, and he got so expert, he could kill a fly on one of Babe’s 
horns when he was standin’ a hundred and fifty feet away and 
never jar the Ox one bit. 
I remember one time I was with him on one of those trips 
when he was bringin’ some stuff out, and he had a calf that
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 PAUL BUNYAN 
he’d bought from some farmer in Iowa that he was bringin’ 
with him to butcher for his camp on the Skagit, when he’d be 
just about the right size then, and so he took him along on this 
tote-trip he was makin’ across the plains. And after the first 
day we stopped over night at a cabin near Billings, Montana. 
The young fellow who was homesteadin’ there said he’d 
put the calf in the barn for the night, so’s he’d be protected 
from the weather some, and Paul of course was glad at that, 
because he knowed that would keep the meat more tender, and 
he told him, sure, that would be fine, if he had room enough. 
“Well, then I’ll do that,” says the homesteader. 
And so then we put the calf in the barn, and we all put up 
for the night. 
Well, the next mornin’ when we got up and went outside, 
somethin’ about the place looked kind of funny and we didn’t 
hardly know at first what it was, but finally one of ’em says: 
“T know what’s the matter. The barn’s gone.” 
And sure enough when we looked, where it’d been there was 
only a pile of straw now, bein’ blowed about by the wind. 
So then of course we all begun lookin’ around to find out 
what'd become of it, but we couldn’t see it nowheres. It hadn’t 
been burned, we knowed that, because if it had of there would 
of been some ashes, and there wasn’t nothin’, only just straw 
and a few boards of the old floor, just as if it’d been lifted 
right up and carried away by the wind. And then we hap- 
pened to think the calf was in the barn too. 
Well, we didn’t hardly know what it was could of come 
about, and so then Holloway—that’s the young fellow home- 
steadin’—happened to think he had a pair of field glasses 
somewheres about the place. For he’d used to a been a forest 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  OFF FOR THE WEST 151 
ranger before, and so that’s how he happened to have the 
glasses there. Well, he brought ’em out, and we looked around, 
and finally one of us spied the barn way off in the distance 
away off towards the south. 
“And Gee! it’s movin’!” he said. 
“No, sure not. There ain’t wind enough to be movin’ it 
now. There might of been in the night, but there sure ain’t 
now—no wind at all to speak of.” 
“But it’s movin’ just the same. And there’s a kind of funny 
thing on top of it.” 
Well, we got our saddle ponies and rode on out there and 
we found the barn, and Ill be blamed if there inside of it 
wasn’t that calf of Paul’s. 
Or I shouldn’t of said inside it, for he was mostly outside. 
You know he’d growed so fast in the night he’d grown clean 
out of it and here was the four sides of the barn hangin’ around 
his legs. He sure was the limit for growin’ fast. 
The last trip Paul made across the plains when he was 
bringin’ his equipment from North Dakota, Teeny was with 
him. 
She had a bed-tick full of boom chains and dipper teeth 
to take care of for her dad, and she was sittin’ up on a box in 
the wagon holdin’ onto ’em good, but when they come to the 
Missouri it happened to be floodin’ at the time and she floated 
off. 
But Teeny was a good swimmer and she held on tight to the 
tick full of chains and dipper teeth and swum acrost; she run 
after her dad and finally caught up with him and the wagon 
about an hour later over on the Madison. 
“Why didn’t you wait for me, dad?” she says, and then 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  152 PAUL BUNYAN 
Paul looked around and seen her comin’ behind the wagon. 
And the fact is, he hadn’t missed her till then. 
“Well, you could of hustled a little bit,” he says, “It 
wouldn’t of hurt you none.” 
But anyway he was glad she hadn’t lost the dipper teeth 
and chains, I guess. 
Another way Paul had of gettin’ his stuff across was by boat, 
around the Horn. 
He never took that trip himself, though, but sent Red Jack, 
his best faller, to take charge of the fleet they’d got together. 
They started from Chicago, and got through the Great 
Lakes and over the falls and out of the St. Lawrence all right, 
and all the way down the Atlantic, but when they got about 
near the bottom of South America, they begun havin’ bad 
luck, and things begun goin’ against them. 
For one thing a storm had just come off the Horn, and for 
another Jack had just broke the rudder on his main ship. 
Well, the waves big the way they was, Jack couldn’t steer 
acrost them because his rudder was broke, and he got down 
between two of em and got swamped first thing. 
And then the other ships, that’d got so used to followin’, 
all followed the flagship, naturally, and so then here they all 
was, down in the holler of the wave with the water pourin’ 
down over’em on all sides. _ 
And so then there wasn’t nothin’ could be done about it, 
and they was all drowned. 
But Jack, when he seen how the water was pourin’ in, and 
that there wasn’t no way of gettin’ his ship out, he crawled 
out of the holler himself and up on top of the next wave and 
so he saved his own life that way. And then he happened to

  HE CRAWLED OUT OF THE HOLLER HIMSELF’
-P-A-G-E-170

-P-A-G-E-171
OFF FOR THE WEST 155 
think he had a shipment of crowbars on one of the ships and 
he went back and got some of ’em, and made himself a raft, 
and so finally he got to land. 
He had a few ships’ biscuits in his pocket and so he didn’t 
starve to death and he steamed into Seattle a few weeks later 
with his flag a-wavin’—which was his blue handkerchief 
from around his neck, that he’d put up for a flag—and he 
said he hadn’t met up with no more bad weather. Most of it 
is just hangin’ round the Horn there anyway, he said, and 
don’t generally get no further. 
Paul just happened to be comin’ in from one of his overland 
trips East when Red Jack arrived, and naturally he was sur- 
prised to see him—alone that way, and without no ships. 
“Where did you come from?” he says to him. “And what 
did you do with them ships of mine?” 
And then Red Jack begun to tell him about the storm and 
how he’d left all the ships down between two waves just off 
the Horn, and then how he’d salvaged the crowbars and floated 
home on ’em. 
Well, Paul, of course, was mighty glad to have Red Jack 
back safe, but he was sorry about the cargo they’d lost and 
about all the men that had got drowned—said he’d never 
knowed about the Horn that it blowed so hard. 
One thing they’d lost down there was the big hotcake 
griddle. 
Jack said last he seen of it, it was standin’ right straight up 
just south of the Horn, dividin’ the Pacific and Atlantic 
oceans. It wasn’t so bad, he figgured, to’ve lost her right there, 
because the oceans need somethin’ like that to keep ’em apart 
now that they was goin’ to be connected by the Panama Canal 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
156 PAUL BUNYAN 
and might get mixed up together. 
Of course Paul had to get somethin’ else in place of a 
griddle for his camp on the Skagit, to fry hotcakes on, but 
he’d kind of figgured to get somethin’ else anyway, for he 
wanted everythin’ in that new camp to be new and up-to-date, 
so’s he could show Joe what was the proper way of loggin’. 
And so he said when he went back to Minneapolis for his 
mail the next Saturday night he’d look around a bit and see 
if there wasn’t somethin’ else he could find to use in place 
of the griddle.
-P-A-G-E-173
    
   
    NEW METHODS 
= SNS a FTER Paul’d finished 
movin’ the Ox and his other equipment, he set up his new 
camp out here in the Northwest, and it was some camp, let 
me tell you—the finest and biggest he’d ever had. If you 
ever liked to see loggin’ that was loggin’ and a camp outfit 
that was a camp outfit, you should of seen that camp of Paul’s 
that he set up on the Coast here. He’d said he was goin’ to 
show that hooktender, Joe, and he certainly showed him all 
right. 
The kitchens in Paul’s new camp was so big that you 
couldn’t see hardly from one end to the other when the steam 
was thick, and the donkey engines he had here was so big 
every time the bull-wheel turned around it was pay-day. 
Oh, it took Paul some time to get all his camp equipment 
hauled out here, but when he finally got it all together, P’ll  
-P-A-G-E-174
  158 PAUL BUNYAN 
tell you the camp he set up was somethin’ nothin’ in the whole 
world could be compared with. 
The cook-range in Paul’s new cook-house was of blue steel 
and was twenty-four blocks long. That was what Paul’d made 
up his mind to have instead of the old hotcake griddle. It was 
so slick the cook didn’t never have to put grease on it to fry 
hotcakes with. They’d just slide on and slide off just about 
automatically, as you might say, and they’d get up such a 
speed when they come off the stove they’d keep on goin’ right 
on down through the air-shafts and out onto the plates where 
they was to be ate by the men. The flunkies had new roller- 
skates provided ’em every mornin’ to skate on, and the head 
cook, surrounded by four hundred cooks and six hundred 
flunkies, rode up and down in front of the stove on a motor- 
cycle shoutin’ his orders through a megaphone with patent 
amplifiers. The tables down the dinin’ room was so long that 
when the waiters was sent down to the lower end for some- 
thin’, they hardly ever come back. Sometimes their grand- 
children did, though, and then some of ’em would happen to 
be girls, and then, naturally, there was trouble. 
There was a car-track down the middle of the table, so 
part of the food could be sent down by express, but you had 
to grab fast if you was goin’ to get any of it, for the trains 
didn’t hardly ever run slower than eighty-five miles an hour, 
and so it would be all gone before it got in front of you. 
Pipes and sprinklers up in the ceilin’ was turned on after 
each meal to wash off the tables, and pipe lines also led to the 
ketchup and vinegar bottles. It always took one man to keep 
the valves turned on and off, and he’d generally get around 
to all of ’em about once in three days.
-P-A-G-E-175
  
NEW METHODS 159 
Of course a good deal of the food, like the beans and pea- 
soup, come in through tubes in the roof by long distance, like 
I guess I mentioned before. The range was given to the gun- 
ners at the main gun every mornin’ and they’d shoot the car- 
loads of beans and bacon out to the kitchen, one carload of 
bacon and five ton of beans to each shot. The bacon was always 
shot first and that greased the air for the beans to follow, and 
both was cooked thorough by the friction they made on the 
way. 
In the kitchens the cooks was all dressed in white uniforms 
and the flunkies was in blue pants and white coats, and they 
had all the conveniences to work with always—pie-dough 
stretchers, dish-washin’ eliminatin’ machines, cake mixers and 
frosters, biscuit raisers, hotcake slides, and a 60-foot band 
saw to cut the eight ton of bread that was used each meal, and 
four 10-block shingle machines for slicin’ and peelin’ potatoes. 
The bunkhouse was built like a hotel and was so high that 
the last seven stories had to be put on hinges to let the moon 
go by—Paul didn’t have only 14,000 men at this camp, be- 
cause it was his headquarters, and he never liked to have a 
crowd around. Each logger had a room individually by him- 
self with a shower-bath and wash-dish, and the spittoons in 
the reception room was all polished brass. It was kind of hard, 
of course, for the men to get used to ’em, after you’d learned 
to hit in the middle of the acorn on the side of the stove, the 
way we used to in the old camps. 
And Paul’s woods equipment was like his kitchens and his 
bunkhouse—on a scale a good deal similar—bigger and better 
than he’d ever had before. He got a yardin’ engine that was 
so big, the Japs he had workin’ for him used to get in the
-P-A-G-E-176
160 PAUL BUNYAN 
injector and get sucked up in the water-glass and we’d have a 
hard time gettin’ em out. And the cylinder was so long, a man 
could walk inside it for four days and not get to the end. 
Course the reason Paul got it was, he wanted to show Joe. 
Though there wasn’t really no sense to it—Joe couldn’t no 
more compete with Paul than nothin’, though he did try a 
little at first. 
One time, I know, in the spring, Joe imported an ostrich 
from California and challenged Paul to a race with the 
Blue Ox. 
Paul hadn’t never gone in for racin’, and wasn’t at all 
anxious to go, but he kind of pretty near had to, the way 
Joe put it, to save Babe’s reputation, so he said finally, go 
ahead, he’d race him. 
The day they picked out for the race was the 4th of July, 
and the track was laid out as close to the 49th parallel as they 
could without interferin’ with the boundry, from a line 
drawed six miles west of Winnipeg to a point in South Bel- 
lingham where the big hotel stands. 
The parallel was lined on both sides with loggers, and over 
forty-three million dollars changed hands in bets that day. 
First the bettin’ was pretty strong on the ostrich, but that 
changed, naturally, as soon as Paul’s men got to bettin’, and 
by the time the race was goin’ to be pulled off they was goin’ 
straight 16 to 1 on Babe, and they’d take up anyone that 
wanted to put up. 
“Sixteen to one on Babe! Sixteen to one on the Ox!” they 
was yellin’ all along the line. 
Paul Bunyan’s men was all loyal to Babe, of course, and 
they knowed he was goin’ to win, too. It wasn’t that he was

HE WAS A KIND OF A NERVOUS BIRD
-P-A-G-E-178

-P-A-G-E-179
NEW METHODS 163 
so swift, but he was so big that even goin’ slow, or just standin’ 
still even, he covered a good deal of ground, and they didn’t 
think no ostrich was ever goin’ to get ahead of him. 
Paul had Babe’s horns tipped with brass for the occasion, 
and it took nearly four ton of brass to do it, Ole said. He’d 
had the hair along the top of his back trimmed off a little and 
had kept him away strictly from hotcakes for a week, and 
he had a red, white, and blue flag stuck up on a long pole 
standin’ up on his tail, with a Union Jack flyin’ at half mast. 
Nobody’d ever seen Babe look so gay before, but I believe the 
extra weight, and the fol-de-rols, and all, sort of bothered 
him. Anyway that’s the way he acted. They couldn’t hardly 
get him in line at all, or get him to start when he should of. 
And so the ostrich was a little ahead at first. He was kind 
of a nervous bird and got a false start, and Buffalo Bill, who 
acted as starter, didn’t make him go back and do it over again. 
I suppose the ostrich must of been about eight miles off be- 
fore Babe even lifted a foot. 
But when he did, though, there wasn’t much to it. The 
ostrich was left lopin’ miles behind in no time, and Babe ar- 
rived at the corner in South Bellingham, amid the cheerin’, 
six hours before his shadow. 
They found out afterwards the ostrich had lost his breath 
tryin’ to keep up at first, and it took a couple of camp in- 
spectors pretty near a whole month to find it for him. 
That was the only race Babe ever was in, that I know of, 
but Paul had him at a County Fair once to show how he could 
pull a tree out without takin’ the bark and limbs with it, but 
leave them still standin’ on the stump. 
The brass tips on the horns he always kept on afterwards,
-P-A-G-E-180
164 PAUL BUNYAN 
for trimmin’ for Babe. They’d shine pretty out in the woods 
when the sun come in through the tops of the trees around 
noon—like it did occasionally, even in them woods. 
Paul had to change a good many of his methods, loggin’ 
in the West, from what he’d been used to use back in Michigan 
and Dakota, where the winters had been long and cold and 
sometimes there was a year with two winters even, when it was 
winter all summer; and out here it wasn’t so easy for him 
to get ice for his ice-roads like it had been. That was one of the 
worst things Paul had to meet up with when he come out 
here to the Coast. He tried to make some in his ice-plant, but 
he’d no sooner get it run out on the roads than the rain would 
come and melt it. 
So then what he done was, he just built a railroad north 
and south and pulled the logs in from both sides with high- 
lead loggin’, and didn’t try to use ice-roads no more the way 
he’d always done before. 
The engines that Paul used on this railroad was so big that 
the boilers had to be made in sections so’s they could go round 
the curves, and the smokestacks couldn’t never be made of 
anythin’ but tarpaper, because if they was, they’d be so heavy 
they’d sink through and into the ground, and stop the speed 
of the engine. 
Afterwards, when he extended this railroad down into 
Mexico, the Mexicans used to beat their way to Alaska by 
gettin’ into the oilcups, and hidin’ there on the way up. And 
the headlights on the locomotives on this railroad was so big 
they was pretty near strong enough to shine through an Everett 
fog, but not quite. 
Paul built a shingle mill too, along with his camp on the
-P-A-G-E-181
  
  NEW METHODS 165 
Coast, so as to make use of the short logs and stumps, the cedar 
ones, especially. He had fourteen hundred filers for this mill 
and he had nine miles of uprights and at the beginnin’ he did 
all the packin’ himself. 
There was just one packin’ frame and bin and the shingles 
was carried to this bin in conveyors. Paul was such a fast 
packer that it took two men to oil his frames and one to pour 
ice-water on his packin’ hammer to keep it cool, and even 
then it burnt up and Paul had to quit and let some of the other 
men go on with the job. 
Paul was branchin’ out in all kinds of new lines, and he built 
a saw-mill too, though he had kind of bad luck with that at 
first. 
You know, the way that was, he ordered all the parts from 
the East, knocked down, and then he hired an Englishman to 
put it together for him. 
Well, that Englishman was like most of ?em—contrary. Of 
course if Paul had knowed it was an Englishman he wouldn’t 
of hired him, but he didn’t know that, and so he give him the 
contract and let him go ahead. 
Well, when it was done, and Paul come to inspect it, he 
thought it looked kind of funny and he tried to tell Jamison 
so. But, of course, bein’ an Englishman, he just got up on his 
high horse and said he refused to talk about it. 
“T have arranged all the parts as per specifications,” he says, 
or something like that. 
And so then they went ahead and set up the mill the way it 
was. 
Well, I always knowed Englishmen was contrary, but I 
never knowed how contrary they could be, till that time.
-P-A-G-E-182
166 PAUL BUNYAN 
Come to find out, here if that fellow hadn’t set up every 
part of that saw-mill wrong end to, so when we hooked the 
motor on it and started it runnin’, it begun runnin’ backwards, 
turnin’ out saw logs instead of lumber, and wouldn’t take 
nothin’ but sawdust for feed. 
And so then Paul had to take it all apart again and put it to- 
gether himself. 
And of course that Englishman never saw the joke. 
Couldn’t expect him to, though, for that matter, they never 
do. 
I don’t know that I mentioned before, the planin’-mill that 
Paul had connected up with this saw-mill, was so big that the 
men could never keep their hats on, but what they was always 
flyin’ away and gettin’ lost up in the blower, till they got some 
strings on ’em and tied ’em under their chins and so kept their 
hats on that way. 
Oh, there was some inconveniences and some things that 
wasn’t so comfortable in this new-style loggin’ too. I can’t say 
as I liked that new-fangled camp of Paul’s myself so very 
much, and there was some of the oldtimers that just balked 
and wouldn’t take to it at all. 
Old Mack Stiles, I know, who’d worked for Paul for forty- 
five years straight. And Gus Peterson, a friend of his. 
They wouldn’t go into the new bunkhouse at all, on no ac- 
count, but went and built themselves a shack over on the other 
side of the tracks instead, where they could have it the way 
they wanted it. And not have to sleep between sheets and wash 
in marble wash troughs, and spit in brass spittoons, but could 
be comfortable like in the old days. Some of us used to go in 
and visit em sometimes, and it seemed kind of nice, too.
-P-A-G-E-183
  NEW METHODS 167 
It was even kind of hard on a few of the real oldtimers, 
who’d followed loggin’ all their lives and hadn’t never been 
out of the woods. Some of em even died. One took pneumonia 
from takin’ a bath and then changin’ his shirt right after- 
wards. It was only February, and he hadn’t never changed it 
that early before. 
But most of us, myself included, naturally didn’t have no 
objections to the decenter livin’ quarters, and the better con- 
veniences, and all that. It wasn’t that so much, but it was the 
old-time spirit that was gone now, that we objected to. 
You couldn’t get any of the old-time life and fun back into 
the men any more, it looked like. Steam heat ain’t conducive to 
it. It took the old comboose and the deacon-seat we used to 
have, to really bring it out of ’em. 
Them days the men all knowed each other. Used to come 
back to the same camp year after year and when they come in 
the fall they generally stayed all winter, most of ’em anyway, 
especially the Michigan men. Wisconsin quitters, Minnesota 
kickers, Michigan stickers, they used to say. 
And that way we’d sit around the fire in the winter and spin 
yarns and sing some of them fine old shanty songs, or maybe 
listen to one of the men fiddlin’. We had some fine fiddlers in 
camp sometimes, and we used to have some real music. 
But now it ain’t that way no more. Now in the camps the 
men just jump around from one camp to another and don’t 
never stay in the same place very long. And there’s all kinds of 
em. Japs and Hawaiians and Hindoos and Polacks and Bul- 
garians and I don’t know what all, and you never know any of 
em. 
And all they ever think about is to get to town on Saturday

night, and get away, get away all the time. And when you do 
meet one you want to talk to, all they want to talk about is 
politics or capital and labor or economics or something like 
that, or else somethin’ they read in the Argonaut or Windy 
Stories or the Literary Digest. Oh, I ain’t sayin’ it ain’t all 
right. I wouldn’t argue with anybody on that. I know they’ve 
done a lot of good in bringin’ about better workin’ conditions 
and shorter workin’ hours and a lot of things like that that we 
wouldn’t of had without them agitators, but a man who’s 
known the old days, when he goes into a camp, misses the fine 
old spirit we used to have, and can’t help but notice the rest- 
lessness around him. 
Them used to be fine old days, the old days—and I guess 
any old logger would agree with me—even if we did have to 
work from two hours before daylight till two hours after dark 
then, and sleep in spruce bough bunks and carry our own roll 
of blankets.

8 THE INLAND EMPIRE 
   
loggin’ Paul done after he come West was in the Inland Em- 
pire. Course it wasn’t an Inland Empire then but just a big in- 
land sea, and it was around the shores of this lake and on an 
island in the northwest corner of it that Paul Bunyan logged. 
It was pretty near my favorite loggin’ with Paul, that year 
was. The location was mighty fine, for one thing. 
The island was covered all over with Sequoia trees—the 
biggest trees you ever saw—-so tall the tops pretty near touched 
the sky. They took on some of the color from the sky and was 
blue about half way down their branches, and then below that 
they was green, with brown trunks. And the ground was all 
covered with brown needles, pretty near two feet long, and 
layin’ in figgurs, just like the way they had fallen, circles and 
figgurs with kind of points to ’em just like the branches are
-P-A-G-E-186
170 ; ‘ PAUL BUNYAN 
arranged on the trees. And them tall ferns growin’ in places 
and sometimes the sunlight comin’ through and lightin’ ’em 
up in spots, so parts of ’em shine all light green just like they 
do when they first come out in the spring, and the whole air 
between the trees, even where the dark shade is, full of that 
green and white light. It sure is pretty. 
And the old logs layin’ on the ground with moss four inches 
thick, and young, branchy salal bushes and green vines growin’ 
all over ’em. 
And everything so quiet the only thing you can hear is your 
own steps as you walk along, or some little animal skootin’ 
under a log and cracklin’ the twigs or dead ferns, or the trickle 
of water from a little stream comin’ out of a rock wall 
alongside of you, and makin’ a little pool at the bottom and 
a muddy place across the trail. 
And then of course, besides bein’ pretty, it was good loggin’ 
down there, too, with them big trees like that. 
I know when we first come down there Paul went out to cut 
a tree down one day. He cut away for a couple of hours, and 
then he went round to see how much he had left to chop be- 
fore he’d get through, and here if he didn’t find two Irishmen 
choppin’ away on the other side of the tree and they’d been 
choppin’ there for over three years, they said, ever since the 
spring of the Long Rain just about three years before that. It 
seems some boss had sent ’em in there to cut that tree down and 
that’s all the farther they’d got, and I suppose the boss had for- 
got all about ’em a long time ago. 
They was all overgrown with beards and they was lean 
and hungry of course, and kind of wild too and queer from 
havin’ been away from civilization so long and not havin’ seen
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE INLAND EMPIRE f 171 
nobody for such a long time. 
Paul felt mighty sorry for em and so he said he’d see what 
he could do, and he went back to his own side again and got 
his other ax and chopped away a little faster, because the men 
was starvin’ to death, and between ’em in an hour or so they 
got it down. 
And then [’Il be blamed after all that trouble if the old tree 
wasn’t hollow. 
But generally they was pretty sound and in good shape and 
Paul could figgur on a lot of timber in ’em. 
One Sunday down there he went out with a cruisin’ party 
and the rest of the company with the packhorses was up ahead 
and Paul was a little behind the others figgurin’ on some trees 
just then—he generally always wore a mill-scale around on 
his spectacles so’s he could figgur ’em up as he went along— 
and the men that was up ahead come to a river and couldn’t 
get acrost it, and when Paul come up to them, here they all 
was standin’ on the bank and wonderin’ how they was ever 
goin’ to get acrost that river, for it was a deep and wide one 
comin’ down off the big glacier on top of Mt. Pasco. 
But Paul wasn’t stumped for more’n a minute or two. What 
he done was, he just fell one of them there big trees over the 
river, and then when he’d got it down and split it open, he let 
the two sides fall apart, and there you had a bridge wide 
enough so you could of taken an army acrost it, if you’d wanted 
to. And so that way he never had to bother with bridges there. 
About a couple of months after that Paul was walkin’ along 
in the woods one day and he had the Blue Ox along, leadin’ 
him on a rope, and he was lettin’ him wander around some, 
grazin’ on the salal bushes and some of the young pine growth,  
-P-A-G-E-188
  172 PAUL BUNYAN 
because it was kind of hard to find feed for him that he liked 
there on the island. 
Well, they was gettin’ along all right and had walked quitea 
few miles when Babe seen an especially green bunch of young 
spruce trees on the other side of a big brush pile where they’d 
been fallin’ trees, and naturally, like they say, the fodder on 
the other side of the brush pile always looks the greenest, and 
Babe was stretchin’ his neck in that direction and was just 
bound he was goin’ over and get some of it. Well, Paul fig- 
gured around a little bit and then he thought it wouldn’t be no 
harm to let him go, he could easy find him a little further on 
along the trail, and he wouldn’t get lost, he guessed, and if he 
did he’d probly find his way back to camp all right. And so he 
let go of the rope and let Babe go where he pleased, and Paul 
kept on on the way to camp, figgurin’ up the timber both sides 
of the trail as he went along. 
But when the dinnerhorn tooted that night there wasn’t no 
Babe to be seen, and next mornin’ even he hadn’t showed up 
yet. 
And Paul hunted for three whole days for that Ox and 
pretty near the whole camp was out huntin’ for him. We didn’t 
get nothin’ else done all that time, but the swampers, and the 
sawyers, and we buckers, and all of ’em was layin’ off to help 
in that hunt, even half of the bull-cooks and flunkies, though 
they should really of kept on the job. And we just combed that 
island from one side to the other, but no sir, no Babe could be 
found. 
And so Paul was just about goin’ to give up the hunt, 
thinkin’ that spirits must of took him away, or one of them big 
sea birds, when he happened to be walkin’ along in the woods
-P-A-G-E-189
THE INLAND EMPIRE 173 
that day feelin’ pretty blue and he heard a kind of little funny 
noise inside the limb of one of them there old trees layin’ on 
the ground, and he begun to figgur what in the world it could 
be in there. Well, he went into camp and got a couple of the 
sawyers, and they come out there and sawed the limb off, and 
Pll be blamed if there wasn’t Babe, and Paul sure was glad to 
see him. 
And Babe was pretty glad to see Paul, too. Poor fellow! we 
didn’t hardly know where all he’d been wanderin’ around all 
that time. Must of gone from one limb to another and found 
?em all blind alleys, poor old fellow. Charley Granger looked 
around and found the hole in one of the limbs where he must 
of got in and an end of the rope where he had wore it off in 
there, and followed it along and found it tangled up in all 
kinds of places where Babe’d been walkin’, lookin’ for a place 
to get out. 
And as luck would have it, just like it always happens in 
them cases, he’d just missed the main trunk by a hair’s 
breadth. There was a kind of knot stickin’ out just in front of 
the openin’ into the main trunk, and Babe’d followed partly 
around that knot, like Charley said he could tell by the way 
the rope laid afterwards, and then must of walked off into the 
lowest limb on the right and then into the next one where Paul 
found him. 
Must of had a pretty black, dark time of it. He was so glad 
when he got out he frisked around, and jumped, and waved 
his tail so there got to be a pretty considerable breeze all over 
there in the treetops, and Paul give him some hotcakes and 
then he was the same old Babe, but we noticed he was always 
a little shy in the woods after that.
-P-A-G-E-190
174 PAUL BUNYAN 
They organized an explorin’ party to explore the trunk of 
that tree and after about four weeks they come out and built 
up a fire for a signal fire to show they had arrived in daylight 
again, and Paul and some of the rest of us took some grub for 
em and went out there, but then, I tell you, Paul was mad, 
and I don’t blame him. For it was just the same tree he’d 
chopped so long on the time he found the Irishmen, and here 
it was givin’ him more trouble again. The Irishmen recog- 
nized it by the year lines where it showed how far they’d 
chopped each year. 
Them Irishmen was still in camp, for Paul had fed ’em 
up and made ’em look right and told ’em they could stay and 
work for him if they wanted to, and so of course naturally 
they’d stayed. Nobody didn’t want to work for no other log- 
gin’ boss if he got a chance to work for Paul Bunyan, espe- 
cially down there on that island. 
Loggin’ on the island and around the inland sea was sure 
mighty handy. For one thing, there wasn’t no waste. You 
could cut up the main part of the tree into them special lengths 
Paul was gettin’ out that year, and then you could cut up all 
the limbs into just ordinary size logs and that way there wasn’t 
no waste at all. And all them small logs filled up the spaces 
between the big ones and made a nice solid-lookin’ job of it. 
The way Paul done, he just cut the trees around the edge of 
the island first—the first row of em all around—and fell 
them right out into the lake where they’d be all ready for the 
drive, and filled in on top with them smaller logs, and then the 
next row of trees on top of the first ones, and the next row on 
top of that, and so on, one circle layin’ right inside and at the 
same time kind of on top of the next circle, till the whole island

  PAUL . . . PLOWED OUT AN OUTLET FOR IT
-P-A-G-E-192

-P-A-G-E-193
  
THE INLAND EMPIRE 177 
was one solid pile of logs, way till you got to the center, to the 
mountain. Mt. Pasco was right up in the middle of the island 
and that’s where we had the camp of course. Not a very high 
mountain but kind of big and flat, with a crater in the top of 
it, and a hollow where you could cook the soup always by nat- 
ural heat. 
And then the trees from the sides of the lake he cut out in 
the water too, but we finished up the island first. From the 
south shore of the lake when you got away from it far enough 
the island used to look like a great big hotcake layin’ out there, 
all nice and brown, and kind of high in the middle like it had 
plenty of good egg and soda in it, and then kind of a little un- 
even around the edge like a good hotcake always ought to be. 
It was sure as pretty a raft of logs as you’d ever want to see, 
and the biggest one I ever knowed of Paul havin’. The sun- 
shine was mighty bright there in the inland empire and used 
to lay over them brown logs out there so you could almost see 
the air movin’ in heat waves above them, even though every- 
thing else was still, and out over the blue sea too, till you 
couldn’t hardly look at it, it was so bright. Loggin’ there was 
different from most of the loggin’ we'd done, and we liked it. 
And then when we got the raft all ready and everythin’ 
layin’ just the way we wanted it Paul went down to the south- 
west corner of the lake and plowed out an outlet for it. He was 
goin’ to take most of them logs to China, so he figgured from 
that corner would be the best way to get out to the ocean. And 
then when he got the river finished and about half filled up 
with water and slicked out over the top so it would be slippery 
he turned the lake right into it. 
Runnin’ out so fast there, of course, the inland sea right
-P-A-G-E-194
178 PAUL BUNYAN 
away begun to slant from the northeast to the southwest, and 
the whole hotcake of logs just slid right off the island and 
floated right down to the outlet and then pretty soon the logs 
from the sides begun to slide in after it trailin’ along behind, 
till goin’ down the river it looked like a great big sea turtle 
with its hair streamin’ out behind it. And it wasn’t long till 
it was gone and clean out of sight. And so that loggin’ was 
over. 
We was all mighty surprised to find that that lake wasn’t 
near as deep as we’d thought it might be, but real shallow, and 
it wasn’t more’n a couple hours after the raft had gone by, till 
it was all drained out and dry and the sagebrush had begun 
to grow up all over it. The sunshine still lays over it, ‘bright 
and in kind of waves like it did before, and that’s the way you 
see it today, a fine beautiful country, stretchin’ out far and 
wide to the East and West, or rather I should say to the North- 
east and the Southwest, and full of sagebrush and sunshine. 
But the Inland Empire is pretty nice at that, though, if you 
like that kind of country. It’s a fine wheat country, and pretty 
good for fruit, too, and I guess the people there ain’t sorry 
Paul Bunyan logged it off for ’em.
-P-A-G-E-195
  
   3 AHERE’S many conflictin’ stories 
about how Paul dug the Columbia River, but of course there’s 
only one right one and that’s the one I was just tellin’ about 
the Inland Empire. I was right there and I saw how it was 
done. When Paul got his raft of logs finished and was ready 
to take ’em out he just went out there and plowed out the 
river. And there wasn’t nothin’ to it at all. He plowed it out 
first and then filled it up with water and evened it out so it 
would be nice and smooth for his logs to slide over. On a windy 
day in the Gorge when an east wind is blowin’ you can see the 
hole yet in the water where Paul never put in the last bucket- 
ful when he was evenin’ it out. 
But some of them other stories is interestin’ just to show 
how such stories grow up. 
I know there’s some that says it happened just by accident.
-P-A-G-E-196
180 PAUL BUNYAN 
Paul was havin’ Babe pull a big log chain into a solid bar 
that he wanted, and the bar broke before it was finished, and 
Babe’d got such a start he couldn’t stop, but run all the way to 
Astoria pullin’ the piece of chain behind him. It cut up quite 
a scratch as it went along, and that scratch, they say, is the 
Columbia River. 
I was in a little hotel up at Acme once, settin’ at a table 
with some other loggers, and one of them settin’ at the end 
eatin’ pie, started in to tell how Paul dug the Columbia pur- 
posely, and how he used tamed mountain goats to do the work 
with. Proof of that is that there ain’t no mountain goats south 
of the river now. Just at the time the water was turned in the 
teams of goats all happened to be workin’ on the north side 
and that’s why they haven’t never got across. 
It was partikkelarly interestin’ to me, of course, because 
that fellow had the nerve to say that he was on that job—Paul 
had him to trim the beards on his goats to keep ’em from 
gettin’ all galled up. The beards used to grow long and get 
under the breast strap on the harness and rub until there was 
a sore there and then the goats wouldn’t pull good. 
Anyway, no matter what they say about it, the Columbia 
is a fine river to have a highway alongside of, the way they’ve 
got down there. 
When he was loggin’ in Oregon Paul built up Mt. Hood 
for a kind of lookout place, from where to watch his differ- 
ent camps; for he had a lot of foreigners workin’ for him 
that year and they wouldn’t work without somebody havin’ to 
watch ’em all the time. Paul hired a kind of efficiency expert 
to help him on that, and that fellow, Gerber, used to walk 
around among the different camps and keep tab on the men 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  
ON THE COLUMBIA 181 
and count up how they spent their time, and he certainly could 
make up some big figgurs, all right. 
He always put down whenever anybody stopped to borrow 
a chew, and how long it took him, and counted up how long 
it took the men to light their pipes, or ask the time of day, or 
go for a drink, and kept tab on how much time was spent in 
talkin’ baseball, or dodgin’ the straw boss, or gettin’ ready for 
quittin’ time, and it always added up to a pretty considerable 
figgur, especially that last item. He used to try to make his 
accounts balance up with the time in the timekeeper’s book, 
but he couldn’t quite make that, though. 
It was a hard job he had, all right, and he had to keep 
steppin’ all the time. 
He tried to increase his efficiency one time by swallowin’ a 
watch and so makin’ himself work automatic, but that didn’t 
work out good, because the mainspring broke inside him and 
busted him. 
The first watch he had, Paul had imported for him from 
Connecticut. ; 
It was such a good watch it gained enough time in the first 
three days to pretty near pay for itself. 
But when he bragged about it to Paul, Paul said he guessed 
he’d have to sell it. At that rate, he says, it might be Dooms- 
day before he’d get his loggin’ in Oregon done. And so Paul 
sold the watch afterwards to a fellow down in New Mexico. 
On account of the earth bein’ bigger down there the watch 
wouldn’t be able to gain so fast. 
Paul made a good deal of lumber down in Oregon and most 
of it he shipped to Japan. He had a band saw in his mill and 
three different cutting floors, and a carriage on each one. The
-P-A-G-E-198
  182 PAUL BUNYAN 
top band wheel was in the roof and the bottom one below the 
first floor. But when they started this mill runnin’ the sawyer 
on the bottom begun kickin’ because he was cuttin’ with a dull 
saw all the time, and so then Paul punched teeth on the back 
side of the saw and pointed ’em upward and then ran the mill 
backwards every other day and that way they cut a lot of lum- 
ber, and everybody was satisfied. 
Paul built one of the biggest steamships that was ever seen, 
to take his lumber to Japan. All the old steamboat men re- 
member her. I know she had forty-two decks and not a single 
bottom and her boilers was all of rubber. 
The way that happened, Paul wanted to load her mighty 
heavy and at the same time he wanted to make a great speed, 
and the engineer says to him: 
“T can’t go at any such rate as that,” he says. “The boilers 
would bust if I tried to get up a pressure for a speed like that.” 
“Well, I tell you,” says Paul, “make ’em of rubber then. 
That way they’ll give, when we want ’em to, and then we can 
go just as fast as we’ve a mind to.” 
And so they made ’em of rubber, and they never had no ac- 
cident with ’em. But of course the smokestack had to be awful 
big. I know one time Paul sent a man up to paint it, and a long 
time afterwards the man’s grandson come down and asked if 
he could have some more paint. 
Paul kept this lumber ship of his as long as he was loggin’ 
in Oregon, but then he sold her. She was sunk afterwards, and 
the remainder of her is now called Catalina Island. The Wrig- 
ley Chewin? Gum Company salvaged the rubber boilers, and 
they’re usin’ some of the material yet for makin’ their chewin’ 
gum.
-P-A-G-E-199
  ON THE COLUMBIA 183 
  Paul liked Oregon all right, but one thing he sure didn’t 
like and that was the fog. And it made him lose money too 
—the time they shingled the cook-shanty, f’rinstance, they 
shingled forty foot out on the fog before they noticed it, and 
there was all them perfectly good cedar shingles gone to waste, 
for when the fog lifted it was so thick it just took that part 
of the roof up with it. 
Some of the people down in Oregon was always wantin’
-P-A-G-E-200
  184 PAUL BUNYAN 
Paul to make somethin’ for ’em, some place where tourists 
could go to spend their money before goin’ to California, and 
they was after him all the time. And so finally he said he’d 
make Crater Lake for ’em—some of ’em had been sayin’ they 
thought a lake like that would be nice—and he said, all right, 
he’d go ahead with it. 
The snow left from the Winter of the Blue Snow was still 
layin’ about fifty foot thick up on the tops of the Cascades and 
Paul went up with Babe to bring it down to make a lake of. 
Babe got lost a number of times on the way up, by fallin’ 
into drifts, and it made it hard to find him, because he was 
just about exactly the same color as the snow. And another 
thing was, his hoofprints was so heavy—weighed pretty near 
a ton each—and if he got lost they was always so far apart it 
was a hard thing to carry ’em up and get the connection be- 
tween ’em. 
But Paul and Babe finally got there though, and Paul used 
a big scraper to haul out the snow, and he dumped all the loads 
in Crater Lake. Each load was 196 cubic tons, and there was 
465 loads in all. 
The snow meltin’ in the lake the next summer made it blue, 
and it made it awful wintry cold too, at the same time, like it 
is. But it’s a mighty pretty lake, though. 
In fact the only job I ever knowed of Paul doin’ that wasn’t 
just up to snuff was the Palouse job, and that’s one of them he 
done while he was loggin’ in Oregon, too. He shouldn’t of 
tackled it in the first place if he couldn’t do it right, I always 
said. 
The way it was: Old man Palouse hired him to come over 
and clear the Palouse country for him, and so then Paul went

-P-A-G-E-203
  
ON THE COLUMBIA 187 
over there and logged it off and cleared the stumps out and 
scraped it up. But he had somethin’ else on his mind all the 
time—another job he wanted to do—and so he didn’t do a 
good job of it and never leveled it out smooth afterwards, the 
way he should of. Babe never liked that part of the work any- 
way. Always hated to lay on his side so long while Paul hauled 
him around to even out the bumps. 
So Paul got in a hurry and wanted to get away from there, 
and so what he done was, he just got a couple of quarts of sage- 
brush whisky and went up to see old man Palouse, and gave 
him a drink or two, and then in the mornin’ he took the old 
man up to the top of a high hill and showed him the country. 
Old man Palouse was pretty much gone from the drinks he’d 
had and anyway from where they was standin’ the country 
looked real level and nice, so Paul got him to accept the con- 
tract and call it finished. And Paul tore away like a hurricane 
to his next job. He never could wait when he had a new job 
in sight, and so that’s why the Palouse country is so hilly and 
rough like it is. Paul was always ashamed of himself for it, 
and they say he wept the Great Salt Lake full of tears because 
he was sorry, but I don’t believe that. He made the lake, 
partly anyhow, to have salt on hand for Babe. 
The job that Paul was goin’ to when he left the Palouse 
country was one he’d invented himself, and took a notion of— 
not really new, of course, because it was somethin’ the same as 
he’d done the time of the Underground Railroad. 
He dug the Underground Railroad and let ’em use it for 
a time while they needed it, and then, afterwards, he made it 
over for the Standard Oil Company. The tube wasn’t just in 
the right place and was a little too thick for a pipe-line, so he
-P-A-G-E-204
    188 PAUL BUNYAN 
pulled it out long, and stretched it out all the way down to 
their oil fields in Texas for the Standard Oil people, and they 
was very well satisfied with the job he made of it. 
The idea he had down in Oregon was, there was a good 
many holes in different parts of the state—prospectors’ holes, 
where they’d been diggin’ for gold, and oil wells they’d dug 
that hadn’t never given no oil—and Paul thought if you could 
get all them holes together they’d be good to use for post- 
holes when the pioneers and farmers would come along after- 
wards. He could sell ’em at a profit maybe, or he might give 
?em away to them that was needin’ ’em. Anyway it was a 
shame to let ’em all go to waste. 
So Paul took Babe, and they went out through the country 
and pulled up holes. It was light, easy work, because the holes 
didn’t weigh much to speak of, and then Paul tied ’em all to- 
gether in a string and took ’em to a mountain side to cache ’em 
—just made a hole in the mountain and pulled ’em through 
pretty near over to the other side, and then plugged up the 
hole. 
And after he’d got it done he didn’t think no more about 
it, but just went away and left ’em there. 
Well, I don’t know if Paul ever went back to look for them 
post-holes or not, or if he ever means to go back again and try 
to locate em. Anyway, he wasn’t there when they was found. 
For when the Union Pacific was puttin’ their railroad 
through there, the engineers was makin’ surveys and, without 
knowin’ it, they started in to put their tunnel right in the iden- 
tical spot where Paul had hid all the holes. 
The chief engineer set a gang of men to work diggin’, and 
then he went away to tend to some other work, and the very
-P-A-G-E-205

first pick that was put in the mountain, they struck the holes, 
and the air that was in there started to come out. The heat of 
the friction from havin’ been crowded in there so close blowed 
the whole crew of men off to nowheres so’s they was never 
seen again. Just a little boy who they had for water carrier was 
left. He told the chief engineer what had happened, and the 
engineer seen the tunnel was all through and finished up in 
fine shape. So he didn’t have to use no crew of men to dig 
the tunnel, but he collected for full time from the railroad 
company just the same—same as if he’d had a full company 
workin’ all the time. 
One time Paul’d went in for a little minin’ himself. 
The claim Paul staked out—and now I got to be careful, 
for minim’ ain’t in my line neither no more than it was Paul’s 
—was from an old stump that was a landmark in that part of 
the country where he was then, just due southwest of where 
Mars cuts the Milky Way, then north 80 chains, 3 links and 
a swivel, then east 40 paces stepped off with the Blue Ox to 
a blue spot in the sky, then proceedin’ South 38 chains 4 links, 
thence southwest to the stump where was the place of be- 
ginnin’—Paul’d had a lawyer help him make it out in the first 
place. It was a gold mine, and it had started out to be a placer 
deposit but had changed its mind afterwards. But of course on 
the outside it looked the same as it had always done. 
Paul worked the mine for two months, he doin’ all the 
work and furnishin’ the provisions, and the lawyer sellin’ the 
stock and collectin’ the money. Paul said that lawyer wanted 
to borrow the Blue Ox, too, so’s he could water the stock, but 
Paul drawed the line on that. 
After workin’ for a while, Paul took a little of the gravel
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 PAUL BUNYAN 
to an assayer’s office to have it tested—and now let me see if 
I can remember the right words for that. It was—igneous— 
prehistoric—and erroneous, that’s what it was. Paul’s mine 
was reported to be igneous, prehistoric, and erroneous. 
And that was the first and last of Paul’s minin’ experiments, 
for he was sure plum disgusted. And from there he went back 
to his loggin’ again, up near Astoria.
-P-A-G-E-207
  
    DIGGING 
PUGET SOUND 
<@ HAT year Paul was loggin’ down at 
Astoria and he was just finishin’ up his work there the next 
summer when one Saturday night he lost a couple of rafts of 
logs on the Columbia River bar; and that was about the time 
Mr. Rainier come down to see him, about the first part of 
August that year. Paul’d knowed Mr. Rainier when he first 
come out West at the time he was gettin’ ready to scrip his land 
that he had to have, but he’d just about forgot all about him. 
But I guess Mr. Rainier thought the acquaintance was strong 
enough for him to ask a favor of Paul and anyway that’s what 
he come down to see him for. 
Paul went up and got out a raft of logs first and got it down 
in the river to take the place of the ones he’d lost on Saturday, 
and then he come in and sat down and started in to talk to Mr. 
Rainier, who'd been sittin’ there in the office waitin’ for him 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 PAUL BUNYAN 
most of the afternoon, But Paul thought it was kind of funny, 
I guess, for he wasn’t used to havin’ any visitors come to see 
him that way. But anyway they talked about the weather for 
a couple of hours, and then about old times what they could 
remember, and then they didn’t have nothin’ more to talk 
about for a while, and so finally Mr. Rainier come out with 
what he wanted. 
“And so we’d like to have you come up and help us dig the 
Sound,” he says. 
And Paul says: “I guess I can do that. Loggin’s kind of slow 
anyway this time of the year. Though it ain’t hardly in my 
line,” he says. 
The way that was: Mr. Rainier and Mr. Puget of the 
Puget Construction Company, and Old Dad Hood and Mr. 
Elliott was associated together under a contract to dig a Sound 
for Seattle so’s Seattle would have a harbor, and they’d been 
given just two years by the goverment to finish the job, and 
now already twenty-two months was up and they seen they 
wasn’t goin’ to get it done, and so that’s why they sent down 
for Paul to come and help ’em. The Republicans in Congress 
was askin’ the contractors to report progress and the contrac- 
tors naturally didn’t have no progress to report and they fig- 
gured they’d have to hurry up and do somethin’ about it, and 
I guess they was pretty near up a stump. 
“We ain’t gettin’ this Sound dug,” says Old Man Puget. 
“No, we ain’t,” says Dad Hood. 
“Except of course I pretty near got the Bay dug though, 
with my badgers and catapults,” says Mr. Elliott. 
“The bay ain’t half finished,” says Old Man Puget, ‘and 
besides what good’s a bay goin’ to do without a Sound behind 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  
  ' DIGGING PUGET SOUND 193 
it, I'd like to know. We got to do somethin’ different than 
that, I reckon.” 
And so then Mr. Rainier suggested havin’ met Paul Bun- 
yan one time and the Blue Ox, and Old Man Puget says, “As 
chairman, that’s just the point I was comin’ to.” 
And so then he made his proposition in the legal and proper 
form. 
What they proposed to do was that they should send down 
for Paul to come up and dig the Sound for ’em and they’d give 
him part of the money that they was goin’ to get, because 
they’d have to, but keep a good big margin for themselves, 
because they was the ones that was lettin’ the contract and so 
was entitled to it. And they didn’t need to say anythin’ to him 
about the mountain they was goin’ to make of course. 
When they’d took the contract to dig the Sound they 
knowed they was goin’ to have to have some place to dump the 
dirt, and so they’d got their Congressman from Seattle to in- 
troduce a bill in Congress that they should make somethin’ for 
Tacoma too at the same time and a mountain would be just 
the thing, that they could name after their city. And so that 
way the contractors could get paid twice for doin’ the one job 
of course. But now they wouldn’t have to say nothin’ to Paul 
about that, but could just tell him where to dump the dirt. 
And so then they sent Mr. Rainier, the secretary, down to 
see Paul about it, and like I said, Paul promised he’d help ’em 
out. 
“T think I can do it for you all right,” he says. “Ill be up 
tomorrow and look over the job.” 
But when Paul come up and see what a haywire outfit they 
was tryin’ to do the excavatin’ with he was sure pretty near  
-P-A-G-E-210
194 PAUL BUNYAN 
plum digusted. 
“Ajin’t you got a plow and a scraper?” he says. 
“No. Elliott’s badgers and catapults is all we got,” they 
says. “Exceptin’ some mules and single harness—and we got 
a six-tooth harrow.” 
“T got the Bay pretty near dug with my catapults, though,” 
says Mr. Elliott. 
“The Bay ain’t but just big enough for you to put your 
name on it,” says Old Man Puget. 
“Pll send to my friend, Andrew Carnegie, for a plow and 
a scraper for your job,” says Paul. “He can probly make one 
back there in Pittsburgh.” 
It took Carnegie’s whole output of steel for the last year 
and six months to make them implements Paul ordered for 
the company and it took sixteen Mogul engines to ship ’em 
across the country. 
But even after all that bother and after pretty near a per- 
fectly good whole week of waitin’ they wasn’t half or even 
quarter big enough, and Paul couldn’t use em. The plow went 
down only forty foot or so the deepest it could be set, and the 
scraper couldn’t only carry but about 408 ton at a time. 
Paul was thinkin’ for a minute and then, like always, he got 
an idea. 
“What’s the matter with me?” he says. “Why ain’t I 
thought of it before? There’s glaciers up in Alaska that can 
dig lakes and rivers and sounds and valleys and anything else 
you’ve a mind to. I’ll go up and get one of them.” 
And so he gets Babe and goes up there to Alaska and hitches 
onto one of the biggest of them glaciers up there and brings 
it down, and then he goes ahead to plow out the Sound. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  
DIGGING PUGET SOUND 195 
  Naturally he didn’t need no scraper, because that glacier 
hadn’t been used to havin’ a scraper workin’ behind it anyhow 
and could do the whole process in one swipe by itself, the way 
it’d always done up in Alaska all them thousands of years. And 
so it didn’t take Paul long to dig the Sound. 
One day when Paul was plowin’, Babe shied at a school 
teacher with a pink parasol, and started to run away. Paul dug 
his heel into the ground to stop the Ox, and that’s how Hoed’s 
Canal happened to be made. But he got him stopped before he 
got quite through, and he never bothered to go back there 
again, and so it’s never been quite finished. 
Babe shouldn’t of scared that way—it wasn’t nothin’ to be  
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 PAUL BUNYAN 
afraid of—only Old Dad Hood’s daughter on her way home 
from school—but that was the first umbrella he’d ever seen, 
and he never could abide pink anyhow. 
I should of mentioned before now, I guess, that Babe’d 
growed kind of ornery and queer since he’d come out to the 
Coast. It was the feed that didn’t agree with him, I know. 
That was the principal reason, except the hotcakes, of course. 
But Douglas fir tops ain’t exactly the right kind of fare and 
not as good as what he’d always been used to havin’ back in 
Dakota and Wisconsin—clover hay, and baled timothy, and 
redtop. 
The alfalfa that Paul tried to raise for him had all been 
drowned out the fall before by the yellow rain that had come 
up from China—between the two of ’em, the dry Washing- 
ton rain comin’ down from on top and the yellow Chinese rain 
comin’ up from below, it was too much for the alfalfa hay, 
and soaked the roots all out and killed it dead. 
I never understood about that Chinese rain. It don’t seem 
reasonable that rain should come up from down there that 
way, but we couldn’t see how the ground could ever get that 
wet from any ordinary rain from on top, and so we figgured 
it must of been a Reverse rain like that, that done it—or 
helped, anyway. 
Paul thought he’d try to make up to Babe for the hay he 
was missin’ by feedin’ him Shredded Wheat Biscuit baled up 
with haywire, but Babe knowed that he wasn’t gettin’ nothin’ 
but wind and turned it down flat, and I don’t know as I blame 
him any; I know I would of done the same thing if I’d been 
him. 
And all the time, of course, he was gettin’? more and more

  DIGGING PUGET SOUND 199 
vicious, and more and more crazy for them hotcakes, that he’d 
got such a habit for, and you couldn’t hardly keep ’em away 
from him no more. 
He got so ornery he just struck flat one day when Paul was 
plowin’ down near Olympia. 
Paul stopped and fuddled around a while to plant some 
oysters so’s the govenor would always have some fresh for his 
table when he was entertainin’ govenors from other states, and 
I guess maybe the Ox thought he was monkeyin’ around too 
long. Anyway when Paul come back to go on and drive on 
further, Babe wouldn’t move a step. 
I guess you know Paul’d meant to connect up the Sound 
with the Columbia River and so make a complete job of it, 
but on account of that balky streak of Babe’s that day it ain’t 
never got done. Paul was about as mad as he ever was at Babe, 
but no sir, he couldn’t make the Ox move an inch. 
Anyway it was a pretty good Sound, Paul thought, and ful- 
filled all the specifications, except probly it was a little rough 
and uneven around the edges where he’d tried to scratch 
around a little at first with that plow Carnegie’d made for 
him. He could of smoothed that out, I spose, and straightened 
it up, but what’s the use? Seattle real estate men would have 
more frontage on the Sound to sell if he didn’t, he figgured, 
and then besides he had a job at Bellingham too that he wanted 
to start in on as soon as he could. 
The city council of Bellingham had wanted a Bay for Bell- 
ingham for a long time so’s the ships could come closer up to 
the wharves and not have to sail up on dry land, and they sent 
down to Paul and asked him to dig a bay for ’em while he was
-P-A-G-E-216
  
  200 PAUL BUNYAN 
at it, and they’d be willin’ to pay him extra for his trouble, 
they said. 
Well, Paul went up there, but right in the spot where he 
wanted to put the bay, an old homesteader by name of Baker 
had took up a homestead, and he wouldn’t get out of the way 
or sell or do nothin’. 
Paul tried for pretty near two weeks to get the old man to 
change his mind and he even hired one of them there lawyers 
that can talk backwards and forwards at the same time to talk 
to him for him, but he wouldn’t budge, and then one day Paul 
got mad, and they had a real row. 
About two weeks after that when old man Baker got out of 
the hospital, Bellingham Bay was all done. 
Paul just happened to meet the old man on the street one 
day. 
“There’s your farm,” he says to him. “I put the dirt all up 
there on the other side of the town for you. And you can name 
it for yourself if you want to.” 
And so that’s how Mount Baker got its name. 
Old Man Puget and his partners, Elliott, and Rainier, and 
Hood, as soon as they’d collected their money from the gov- 
erment, went up to settle with Paul, but they didn’t like to 
part with the money they’d got very well, and they was goin’ 
to try to jew him down if they could. 
Well, Paul he just stands there with one foot on either side 
of Deception Pass and lets ’em talk for a while, and then after 
a while he just calmly takes up his shovel and picks up a 
shovelful of dirt from the east side of the Sound and throws 
it out in the water, kind of as if he wasn’t thinkin’ about what 
he was doin’. Well, and then as they goes on talkin’ and tryin’  
-P-A-G-E-217
  DIGGING PUGET SOUND 201 
to explain to him that seein’ it didn’t take him as long as they’d 
expected it to take him, they’d rather pay him so much a day, 
and that would be fair, instead of payin’ him for the whole 
job, and goes on that way, all of ’em together, Paul he just 
picks up another shovelful and another shovelful, and another 
shovelful, and without lookin’ at ’em or payin’ no attention to 
em, throws ’em into the Sound. 
Well, when they seen all of a sudden what he was aimin’ 
to do, and if they didn’t pay him right away, he’d soon have 
the whole Sound filled up again, they run right for the money- 
sack and paid him quick, I can tell you. 
You would think they would of learned their lesson the 
other time, when they sent him a carload of cheap tobacco— 
Paul just begun shovelin’ dirt back in the Sound, till some 
clerk reported to ’em what he was doin’ and they sent him a 
carload of good tobacco and an apology quick, I can tell you. 
But they didn’t seem to’ve remembered that till next time. 
Them shovelfuls of dirt that Paul throwed back in the 
Sound is the San Juan Islands now. Since they’ve got over- 
grown with trees and rocks and blackberry vines they’ve come 
to be mighty pretty to look at. But of course they’re in the way 
of the ships a little bit, them that are goin’ to Victoria. 
Some says that a long time ago Paul dug the Pacific Ocean, 
too, the same as he dug the Sound, but that’s just a story that’s 
grown up, I think—the way stories will. A story seems to get 
started and then keeps on goin’ till nobody knows where it first 
come from. 
Old Mr. Pacific’s own grandchildren officially denied the 
rumor here in court a couple of years ago. Paul didn’t have 
nothin’ to do with the Pacific Ocean—not directly anyway.
-P-A-G-E-218
  202 PAUL BUNYAN 
Indirectly, of course—he’s indirectly responsible for its bein’ 
salt. 
The way that was: 
Where they used to soak out the salt pork for the beans in 
the sink in Paul’s camp in Oregon, the drainage from the sink 
where they soaked out the pork run down and made the ocean 
salt. And then you can see the foam on the waves yet too, that 
comes from the soapsuds they used in the big nets in the river 
where they rinsed off the knives and spoons.
-P-A-G-E-219
   a es A UL didn’t get to go 
bark to his jones’ for very long after he’d finished the Puget 
Sound job. In fact, he didn’t hardly get to go back at all. For 
it was just about ‘that time that the Tacoma people begun 
botherin’ the life out of him to move the Mountain for ’em. 
You know the way that was—like I said before—what was 
planned in the first place, before they started diggin’ even 
—that Mountain should of been named for Tacoma. But a 
nephew of Mr. Rainier, that was a lawyer, had drawed up the 
contract, and he’d put it in the contract that the Mountain 
should be named for his uncle, Mr. Rainier, who’d been an 
admiral when he was a young fellow. And so now when they 
wanted to change it, there wasn’t nothin’ the goverment could 
do about it. And that’s why Tacoma wanted Paul to move it 
inside their City Limits. A fellow always wants to watch out 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 PAUL BUNYAN 
for them lawyers, for they’re puttin’ somethin’ over all the 
time. 
Well, and so then, though it wasn’t no use, them Tacoma 
people was fussin’ about it, and they thought Paul ought to 
move it for em. But Paul said he couldn’t do it. He drawed 
the line on that. It’s too bad he put it where he did, he said, 
and he was sorry all right, but it wasn’t no fault of his, he was 
only obeyin’ orders of Messrs. Puget, Hood and Company, 
and them Tacoma fellers should of been on the job at the be- 
ginnin’. No use kickin’ afterwards. If they’d of told him at 
the time where to put it, he would of put it wherever they 
wanted, but he wasn’t goin’ to move it now. But he was willin’ 
to do anythin’ else they wanted him to, he told ’em, to oblige 
em, and that’s how it come they hired him to make the Ta- 
coma Prairies for an airplane base and an automobile race- 
track, just outside the city. 
And another thing he made for ’em, and didn’t charge em 
for, was the Stadium. He built that first for a corral for Babe, 
but it wasn’t anywheres near big enough for the Ox, and so 
he just left it there for the city of Tacoma, and it’s made a 
mighty fine Stadium, and one that’s made Seattle jealous ever 
since. 
Paul come pretty near bein’ arrested when he was on that 
prairie job. And it was like this: seems that part of the land 
they was goin’ to use was reserved and they didn’t have no 
proper kind of permit for clearin’ it. 
But the goverment inspectors didn’t get Paul, though, and 
that’s because of the side-hill fall that him and Red Jack had 
practiced up on back in Michigan. 
You see, trees growin’ on a side-hill is pretty hard to fall, 
 
-P-A-G-E-221
  
CLEARING THE LA CONNER FLATS 205 
because you can’t hardly tell where they’re goin’ to when you 
fall ’em, and so Paul and Red Jack had practiced up a lot on 
em when they was back on the Pyramid, in Michigan. Finally 
they got so they could make ’em go just where they wanted to, 
one on top of the other, or the other on top of the first one, or 
one right on the stump of another, or criss-cross like a ladder, 
a whole lot of ’em together, or anythin’; and so here on the 
level it wasn’t nothin’-—after they’d been used to the side-hill. 
So what they done when they was clearin’ the Tacoma 
Prairies was, they’d always fall one tree on the stump of an- 
other tree and knock it down in the ground, and that way they 
never had but one tree down at a time that could be used as 
evidence against ’em. 
So when the investigation was on and them inspectors come 
along all they found was one tree down, and they reported 
back to the goverment: 
“Said Paul Bunyan ain’t been stealin’ no timber. All he’s 
got is one tree, and everywhere to one side of this tree is nothin’ 
but prairie.” 
So that way Paul could of made the Prairies as big as they’d 
a mind to of had ’em, but the Tacoma people was scrappin’ 
over the Mountain yet, and they thought the Prairie was big 
enough now, and so Paul quit when he’d finished as much 
of it as there is now, and then he went up and helped the La 
Conner people clearin’ their Flats. 
That was kind of a mean job, though, and kind of dirty, be- 
cause they’d had a flood on the Skagit River just before he 
come up, and the mud up there hadn’t no bottom to it. 
Paul sunk in pretty near up over his ears, and Babe sunk 
in so deep Paul was afraid he would go clean through to  
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 PAUL BUNYAN 
China, for only the brass tips on his horns was showin’ above 
the mud sometimes. It was goin’ to be a pretty tough job 
clearin’ land in that there kind of country, and Paul seen he 
was goin’ to have to do somethin’ so they wouldn’t sink in so 
far. 
And so then Paul used his brain, like he generally done. 
Well, I don’t know what I would of done under them cir- 
cumstances, but I can tell you what Paul done, after he’d been 
thinkin’ for a while. 
Remember them snowshoes I mentioned he was wearin’ 
that first time he come out to Seattle, when he made the Grand 
Canyon? Well, that’s what he used. 
He’d cached ’em down in the State Museum when he found 
he couldn’t use ’em no more, and now he went and got ’em 
again. And that give him the idea what to do for Babe too. 
And so he just took a couple of logs and shaped ’em up like 
sled runners and nailed braces across "em, and made mud-shoes 
for Babe, and they worked just fine. Afterwards they’ve used 
em for sleds for donkey engines. A few years ago somebody 
found one of Babe’s shoes in a hole where the mud’d been, and 
picked it out and set his donkey engine on it, and that’s what 
that kind of shoe is used for generally always now. 
I guess it would make Babe pretty good and mad if he was 
here to see it—the way they do now. Them pesky donkey en- 
gines that he always hated so like sin, doin’ all the favorite 
work he used to do, and drinkin’ out of his rivers, and now 
wearin’ his shoes even. 
Paul used to water Babe in the Puyallup River while he was 
on the La Conner job. Babe used to drink the river dry for 
three miles up and down every time he was watered. One time
-P-A-G-E-223
  CLEARING THE LA CONNER FLATS 207 
he tried to drink it dry all the way down to the ocean because 
Paul’d lost his watch somewheres and wanted to know if by 
accident he might of dropped it in the river. 
But he hadn’t, though, as a matter of fact. 
All the time it was in the bottom of Paul’s loggin’ pants, 
where he’d turned ’em up around the leg. 
One time on one of the Oregon jobs Paul had Ole make 
him a donkey engine to use on part of the work. Ole made it 
one day, but the next mornin’ when they got up, the donkey 
engine was gone, and the next mornin’ the one he’d made that 
day was gone too, and so the next day when he made one, him 
and Paul made up their minds they was goin’ to watch and 
see what become of it. 
If there was anythin’ in the world.Paul hated to see it was 
petty thievin’, and he wasn’t goin’ to have no camp thieves 
around his camp carryin’ off any of his stuff—no matter what 
it was, donkey engines or anythin’ else. And so he loaded up 
his gun with buckshot and salt and laid down by Ole behind 
a shed to see what was goin’ to happen. 
“We'll just give him a few where itl] do him the most 
good and I guess hell know enough not to come prowlin’ 
around my stuff any more,” Paul says. 
But nothin’ happened till about midnight, and then they 
seen the door of Babe’s barn come open. 
“T thought the thief must of been hidin’ in there,” Paul 
says. But no thief come out; only the Blue Ox himself. 
Ole and Paul watched to see where he was goin’, and he 
walked right over to the open place where the new donkey 
engine stood, and they couldn’t figgur out for the life of ?em 
what he was goin’ to do there. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
    208 PAUL BUNYAN 
What he done was, he just picked up that there donkey on 
one horn and carried it into the barn, and into his stall. Paul 
and Ole followed after a while, and there under his crib in the 
hay they found all three of them there engines—he was just 
finishin’ scrapin’ a little hay over the one he’d just brought 
in there last to cover it up good. 
Well, Paul he was always soft-hearted where the Ox was 
concerned, and that time his heart was touched if it ever was. 
“Tl bust these donkey engines up and burn ’em tomorrow,” 
he says to Ole. “I ain’t goin’ to use no more of them things, 
not on this job anyway. I guess I can manage with the cattle 
and the horse teams and the goats I got. Babe’s always been a 
faithful Ox to me, and [ ain’t goin’ to hurt his feelin’s now 
at this time of life.” | 
And so they didn’t use the donkey engines on that job, and 
Ole’s work for three days was gone for nothin’, but that just 
shows how Babe felt about the new loggin’ riggin’ that was 
beginnin’ to take his place. Poor old fellow. It was sure kind 
of hard on him. 
Oh, yes, and I come pretty near forgettin’. One day when 
Paul was plowin’ up on the La Conner Flats somethin’ almost 
kind of funny happened. 
I suppose everybody knows what cedar stumps are. And 
how tough they are. Well. 
Well, Paul was plowin’ one day on an afternoon late in the 
fall and he run right square plank into one of them there cedar 
stumps with his breakin’ plow. 
It was near sundown, and we was gettin’ our cattle unyoked 
and gettin’ ready for quittin’ time, when all of a sudden we

heard him holler and what’s more, and certainly pretty funny 
for Paul—he was hollerin’ for help. So we looked, and there 
he was, stuck in one of them cedar stumps. 
And what’d happened was, he’d drove into the stump with 
his plow, and the stump had split down the middle and him 
and the plow had gone through, and then the old stump 
clamped together again, and there he was, stuck fast by the 
seat of his pants in the crack in the stump, and he couldn’t get 
out no way. 
So we went up there and hitched all our teams—about 
twenty of ’em in all—along with the Blue Ox, and pulled him 
out. 
Only it didn’t go as quick as that, because we was all fooled 
at first, and made a bad mistake. 
There was a rise of ground out a ways from the stump, and 
a little hollow, and the way we had the teams yoked up at first, 
with Babe out ahead, we come near stranglin’ all the other 
cattle. 
“Look out! The cattle’s all up in the air!” someone yelled, 
that was standin’ off to the side, and we looked, and here, sure 
enough, they was all suspended up in the air and come pretty 
near havin’ their heads yanked off. 
You know the way it was, Babe was up on a hill, and when 
he give a pull, the others was just naturally lifted right off 
their feet and come pretty near all bein’ strangled. 
Well, then we unhooked ’em again and yoked ’em up the 
other way, Babe next to the plow, Paul hangin’ onto the 
handles of it, and the other smaller cattle up ahead. 
Murphy had ’em all heave together at the same time, and 
so we got Paul out all right, and the old cedar stump come 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 PAUL BUNYAN 
right out with him, roots and all. 
But it was mighty hard on his suspenders, though. Pants 
held good, he said—he wasn’t worried about them none, for 
they was real loggers’ pants—but it was a considerable strain 
on his suspenders—that is why he hadn’t said much durin’ the 
performance, he told us afterwards, because he was worryin’ 
about whether they was goin’ to hold or not. 
Yes, and another time Paul helped one of the ranchers up 
there a little with his house-movin’. 
A fellow was goin’ to build a house up on the hill at La 
Conner and it’s kind of rocky up there and it would be awful 
hard to dig a cellar in the rock. So he asked Paul what he’d 
better do about it and Paul told him to go ahead and build 
the house down on the flats where the cellar would be easy to 
dig, and he’d haul it up for him with the Blue Ox, and that’s 
what he done—hauled the whole nine-room house up first and 
then went back and hauled the cellar up afterwards.

   NTHE DEATH OF THE BLUE Ox 
: BIKE I was sayin’, Babe 
wasn’t rence the same ei he come out here to the Coast. I 
don’t know what all got into him, but he got awful scrawny 
and thin after a while, and so touchy there wasn’t hardly 
no gettin’ along with him at all. And especially any time he 
couldn’t get hotcakes, he was worse then, of course. 
The habit for hotcakes had growed on him more and more 
all them years, and some of us pretty near knowed it was goin’ 
to turn out bad in the end, but of course we didn’t know it was 
goin’ to be as bad as it was. For it’d got so there wasn’t hardly 
no keepin’ him away from ’em no more, and Paul, of course, 
didn’t dare give him all he wanted. 
If Brimstone Bill had only been there it wouldn’t of been 
so bad, but Bill’d wore out at last and’d had to go and spend 
his last days with a sister he had somewheres down in Idaho, 
     
  
-P-A-G-E-230
  214 PAUL BUNYAN 
and the new fellow that was goin’ to take care of Babe didn’t 
use the right methods on him at all. Jake’d used to be a cow- 
puncher and them bronco-bustin’ methods of his didn’t do for 
Babe; and Paul couldn’t hardly take the time to take care of 
him himself no more, with everything else he had to do—I 
don’t really know as he ought to of tried to do all them things. 
And anyway, I guess, maybe Babe got lonesome too—for 
the old Michigan winters and the snow and the sleddin’ and 
all that, and he didn’t like the climate out here very well— 
though it’s supposed to be the best climate on earth. And then, 
like I said, the feed was poor too—Douglas fir tops ain’t much 
to work hard on all day. It seems he was hungry pretty near all 
the time. And then, of course, I spose it was just a good part 
old age. Babe was gettin’ pretty old for an Ox to’ve worked so 
hard all his life, like he’d done. But if Paul’d had good feed 
for him and enough of it, I know it would of been better, but 
he didn’t, and that’s what made Babe so greedy, I think. 
If the boys would of knowed, back in Michigan, when they 
fed him hotcake-and-cloverhay sandwiches just for fun, that 
it was goin’ to turn out like this they sure wouldn’t of done it. 
But you can never tell about anything like that beforehand. 
Nobody couldn’t hardly do anythin’ with him no more. 
One time he got into the honey Paul’d got out of the bee- 
tree that time he was huntin’ bear, and got himself an awful 
toothache again and had to have the very last tooth he had 
left in his lower jaw pulled out and the one on the other side 
filled with copper plate. 
It took an extra good kind of dentist and one trained for 
an acrobat too on account of Babe’s mouth bein’ so high, and 
with a couple of good helpers and some good rope ladders. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
  
THE DEATH OF THE BLUE OX 215 
derrick they used in pullin’ that last tooth was used for a stump 
puller afterwards, and they had to use steam hammers for the 
one they filled, next to it—and that reminds me, there ought 
to be a good copper mine somewheres in this country if any- 
body could only locate it. 
And another time Babe swallowed eight rolls of barb wire 
that Paul was goin’ to build a corral with, and he sure come 
pretty near killin’ himself that time. Paul sent a kid in right 
away to cut up the wire in pieces so it wouldn’t tie up his in- 
sides so bad and so’s the pieces could work themselves out in 
time, but it was pretty near five months afterwards before the 
last of them pieces of wire come out through his hide. The 
last piece come out through a place along the right side of his 
back just back of the shoulder. ‘ 
And once he pretty near killed himself overeatin’ on cow- 
feed. 
We was all in eatin’ dinner that time and there wasn’t no-' 
body out there to watch Babe, and he got into a shed where 
somebody’d stored cowfeed—four whole bins of it—and he 
swallowed it all down at one time. 
And, what always happens in them cases, he naturally 
swelled right up. 
It wouldn’t of been so bad, only Paul wasn’t home at the 
time, and that made everybody all excited. 
One of the buckers was the first to come out, and he seen 
what’d happened and begun hollerin’ around, and run for the 
water bucket that was standin’ by the door of the barn and 
give Babe a big drink of water. And then, naturally, that made 
him swell up all the worse. 
Well, by that time most of the rest of us was out there too,
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 PAUL BUNYAN 
and all excited. 
“Where’s a pitchfork?” hollers somebody. “Stick a pitch- 
fork into ’im. Quick! And let the air out of him.” 
“Get a pitchfork! Get a pitchfork!” everybody begins 
hollerin’. 
But it just seems there wasn’t no pitchfork around the place 
nowheres. 
“Maybe a peavey’d do,” somebody says. 
“No, a peavey’s got a hook on it, you fool,” says somebody 
else. “And you wouldn’t be able to get it out again.” 
And we sure thought we was goin’ to have to stand there 
and look on when poor old Babe would bust right there before 
our eyes. 
But just then somebody noticed one of the cookees with 
the dinnerhorn in his hand—he’d picked it up when he come 
runnin’ out, and he was wavin’ it like a wild man in the air. 
So then Ole the Blacksmith grabs the horn from the flunky 
and sticks it into him, and the wind begun comin’ out. 
But the poor Ox got so scared when he heard the horn 
tootin’, he just started on a run down the hill, and there wasn’t 
no bridge over the river and he run right down into the drink, 
and we was all runnin’ after him and the horn tootin’ all the 
time like a Kansas thunderstorm. And then the water begun 
runnin’ down the horn, and the poor old Ox begun to sink be- 
cause he was bein’ drowned both on the outside and on the 
inside at the same time, and we sure thought he was a goner. 
But just about that time the wind in his stomach must of 
begun comin’ out again, because pretty soon we seen the water 
begin spurtin’ out just like a geyser, and then it wasn’t long till 
Babe floated up high enough so’s we could get a rope around

his horns and get a block and tackle and haul him out. 
But we sure was pretty excited for a while, for we would of 
hated to have somethin’ like that happen to him—and spe- 
cially while Paul was away and wasn’t there to say what to do. 
Then after he got home Paul built a corral for Babe up near 
Snoqualmie, so he’d have a place to keep him, because the 
forest inspector said he was eatin’ up the spruce forest too fast. 
And that way Babe’d have a place to go in at night to lay down 
and rest for a while. 
It was built of Douglas fir posts 70 foot high—raised up on 
end for a kind of stockade. But this corral wasn’t no success, 
though, because the very first night Babe slept in it he busted 
it down—or the mornin’ after the first night, I should of said. 
He must of been sleepin’ with his hind quarters pretty close 
up to the north wall and when he raised up in the mornin’ first 
on his hind legs—like cattle always do, of course—and then 
on his front ones, why, his hind parts went right through the 
stockade and the whole thing fell down—and it wasn’t no use 
tryin’ to put it up again, because Paul knowed then it wouldn’t 
never hold that way. 
So the next time Paul built a corral, he made it of wire— 
because that would give in a similar case like that, he figgured. 
He picked out a place where the tall trees was growin’ 
pretty thick so he could just stretch the wire around from tree 
to tree, and he put them pretty close together up and down 
and around the corral, big enough so Babe would have room 
enough to turn around this time. He hired a telephone crew to 
build it for him, and it took 48 high climbers five weeks to put 
up the wire. 
If Paul could of put up a corral big enough so’s to’ve per-
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 PAUL BUNYAN 
vided enough grazin’ ground inside, he might of saved Babe 
his last final death, I think, but I spose he couldn’t do that. 
What he done was, when his own spruce grazin’ lands was 
pretty well gone, he turned Babe into the goverment forest 
reserves. Of course the forest ranger wouldn’t stand for that, 
because that way they wouldn’t have no forests for our chil- 
dren and grandchildren, he said, and so he ordered Paul to 
take him out and tie him along the outside edge of the forest 
—he could do that with goverment’s permission, if he wanted 
to. 
“He ain’t used to bein’ on a rope, and I don’t know if he’d 
stay or not,” Paul says. 
“He'll just have to get used to it then,” says the ranger, 
“like the rest of ’em.” 
“But I ain’t got no rope strong enough to hold him,” Paul 
says. “My Ox is a pretty strong Ox, you know.” 
“T can tell that by lookin’ at him,” says the ranger. “(Maybe 
you could get a chain in town. I saw one out at the docks one 
day that looked pretty stout. Why don’t you try one of them?” 
Well, that give Paul an idea. 
What he done was, he just went and bought back the big 
anchor chain from that ship he’d had when he carried lumber 
to Japan, and he tied the Ox with that to Mt. Pilchuck. 
But he hadn’t calculated just right anyway. It wasn’t strong 
enough to hold. Well, that is, I guess the chain was strong 
enough all right—I don’t believe that broke ever—but the 
mountain wasn’t, you know. 
One mornin’ Babe got a whiff of hotcakes cookin’ in a camp 
over in Vancouver, and then it was all off. On starvation ra- 
tions like he’d been on for a couple of weeks, the smell of them
-P-A-G-E-237
  
THE DEATH OF THE BLUE OX 221 
hotcakes was too much for him. He just give one lunge and 
was off, and he tore the mountain loose and everythin’, and 
just went likkity-split until he got there, and he didn’t stop 
for nothin’. 
The mountain come up with the chain and dragged along 
behind, but after a while Babe caught it on a stump or some- 
thin’ and it come off and he lost it, and that’s why Mt. Pil- 
chuck today is right where it is, instead of bein’ a hundred or 
a hundred fifty miles further south where it used to be. That 
all come of that run that mornin’. 
Babe got into the camp in Vancouver just as the cook was 
fryin’ the last stove-top-full of hotcakes. It wasn’t a very big 
camp, only about 400 men or so, and there wasn’t an awful lot 
of hotcakes on hand, only about four platters stacked four foot 
high that the flunkies was just goin’ to start down the tables 
with on the run, for the bell for breakfast was ringin’ just 
then, when Babe busts into camp. The store-room back of the 
kitchen he laid out flat, and he took one jump over that, and 
then he made straight for the stove and the hotcake platters. 
He swallowed all that was on the platters in just two swal- 
lows and a half, and then he made for them on the stove and 
he was so greedy he just swallowed the hotcakes, stove, fire, 
cook, hotcake turner and all in one swallow. 
Well, the cook’d just filled the stove up with good dry 
spruce wood so’s to have plenty of fire for the last batch of 
cakes, an’ it had just got goin’ good, and it burned Babe’s in- 
sides out before anybody had time to do anythin’ for him, 
an’ everybody just stood and gawked. The blacksmith there, 
though, was just shoein’ a donkey engine, an’ he brought that 
in to pull the last painful breaths out of Babe’s body, and so
-P-A-G-E-238
a ee pee ne 
222 PAUL BUNYAN 
helped him out some. 
Poor old Babe! Had a hard life the last few years of it, all 
right. And it must of been an awful death for him, too, but 
maybe after all, the way everythin’ was, he was glad to quit. 
They butchered the carcass, and the inside meat that was 
roasted enough by the fire inside him they canned up for 
canned roast beef that you can still see on the market, and the 
rest they packed in 240 refrigerator cars and sold to the differ- 
ent loggin’ and minin’ companies operatin’ on the Sound after- 
wards. 
Most of ’em got some of the Blue Ox meat left yet, I judge 
from the reports that comes in. 
Just the other day a fellow come in here to ask what time 
the stage left and he stopped and talked to me a minute or two 
where I was settin’ on the porch—for I guess he seen I was 
an old logger—and he happened to just mention that he’d 
been workin’ in Lovell’s Upper 7, and so I asked him how 
they was feedin’ up there now. And he says “pretty punk— 
they got too much of that there Paul Bunyan meat on hand for 
good feedin’,” he says. The roast meat they had the day before 
he quit, he said, must of been from the shoulder of the Ox, 
because it was so tough—where the yoke’d rubbed when he 
was haulin’ them big loads back on the Pyramid Forty.

  PAUL'S 
» LAST, STAND 
gee LL, yes, Paul’s 
gone now. And it’s more sees ten years now since I seen him 
last. He was off for Alaska then, he said, and I don’t believe 
he’s ever come back, and so I guess eke up there yet. They 
say he’s loggin’ by airplane now and that he’s gettin’ out tim- 
bers for the Mexican goverment to build their navy off. Some 
say they’ve seen his airplanes goin’ across the sky on the way, 
fetchin’ the timber down to Mexico. I don’t know. I ain’t 
never seen ’em myself. But I mean to watch out, though. 
Whatever he’s doin’, he’s doin’ somethin’ big, you can bet your 
last nickel on that. 
It just happened that I seen Paul the day he pulled off 
finally for Alaska./I happened to be down to the dock that day 
and so I seen hima step aboard and got to say good-by to him. 
He went up on the old steamer Queen that used to run between  
-P-A-G-E-240
  224 PAUL BUNYAN 
here and Juneau in the old days. 
“Well, he’s dead, Angus,” he says to me when I reached 
out my hand to shake hands with him just before he stepped 
aboard. 
“Yes, I heard about it,” I says. 
Naturally, he was talkin’ about the Ox. Paul was all broke 
up about the loss of the Ox, and I knowed that too. I’d heard 
the men talkin’ about it, though I hadn’t been workin’ for him 
for the last couple of months. 
Some of ’em said they didn’t think he could ever get over it, 
and I don’t know but what they was right. 
“He was hungry,” he says. “We ain’t had the right feed for 
Babe for a long time. Babe was hungry, or he wouldn’t of 
done it, I know.” 
“Yes, sure, he was hungry, Paul,” I says, “or I don’t think 
he would of done it.” But I don’t know as I believed that, for 
I’d watched his bad habit for hotcakes grow on him, and I 
pretty near knowed somethin’ would of happened some day 
anyhow. 
“T can’t never do the loggin’ I used to do, again,” Paul says. 
“Not without Babe. He was a faithful Ox to me. I guess I’m 
gettin’ old. I want to see the snow again and try some of the 
old-time loggin’ once more.” 
Paul was feelin’ pretty bad, I guess, about the way his 
loggin’d got broke up out here them last years. 
“Good-by,” I says. And then just to cheer him up a bit: 
“And good luck to you, like old times, Paul,” I says. 
“Same to you, Angus Campbell,” he says, “good luck to 
you too, like old times.” 
And with that he reaches out his hand across the twenty-

eight foot of water between us and gives my hand a hard 
squeeze that I can feel yet sometimes when the wind is from 
the north, and just about that minute the boat whistled, and 
she sailed away, with Paul a-standin’ there on the deck. 
And that’s the last I ever seen of him. 
Oh, there’s reports that’s come through. Some say he’s gone 
up to the North Pole and that he’s helped Santa Claus make 
new sled runners and some other things for his annual business 
trip South once a year, and some says he has the pole all rigged 
up for high-lead loggin’, and that he’s loggin’ off the Arctic 
Circle. And some say that he’s been back to the States a num- 
ber of times, and that he’s tried ranchin’ down in Oregon, 
raisin’ an extra-extra big kind of apple, and that he’s dry- 
farmed over in Nevada, and had a cattle ranch down in Idaho 
once again after that other time. 
I don’t know about cattle ranches. I don’t believe he’d try 
that again after the kind of luck he had the other time. 
You know he did try dairy ranchin’ once, when he thought 
he was goin’ to use cow milk in his camps instead of canned 
cow. He bought a combination popcorn and dairy ranch and it 
was a mighty fine one too. But in the fall when he had his pop- 
corn all put up in granaries and his cattle all out grazin’ on 
the fall clover, somebody’d dropped a cigarette stub out near 
the corncrib and set fire to the whole outfit. The popcorn all 
popped at one time right away, and when the cows seen it 
come spreadin’ out all over the field and gettin’ about three or 
four foot thick they thought it was a Kansas blizzard and they 
every last one of ’em froze to death before Paul had time to 
drive ’em away from there or rake the popcorn out. So after 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  228 PAUL BUNYAN 
that experiment I don’t believe he’d try anythin’ like that 
again—especially after he lost Lucy too—that was Paul’s 
favorite cow—she used to give so much milk it took seven men 
to skim the cream. One winter when the snow was extra deep 
she used to graze on the pine and balsam tops that was the only 
trees that was stickin’ up above the snow and the milk was so 
strong that the men used to use it for cough syrup. And she 
had to roam so far to get enough fodder that Paul had to hang 
a church bell on her to keep her from gettin’ lost. But she was 
with the rest of the herd out there in the popcorn blizzard that 
time and she froze to death just the same as the others. 
Oh, there’s all kinds of stories. There’s one about a thrashin’ 
outfit he had once when he was up in Alberta. I guess that 
must of been the time before he logged North Dakota when 
he used to get some of the supplies for his camp from his farm 
up there. 
An Irishman by the name of Mike Flannery told me this 
story. I don’t know as I can remember it, but I can see if I 
can—just for fun. 
Mike says he and Paul started out together on that thrashin’ 
outfit from Winnipeg, and they sent men ahead on horseback 
and motorcycles to let the farmers know they was comin’, so 
they’d be ready for ’em. 
They had a big Case outfit and the engine was so big it had 
eight fly-wheels and could run on either its bottom, side, or 
top, just as good. The belt was lengthened to four and one- 
fourth miles, because they didn’t want to have no short sets, 
but when they was movin’ they shortened it up a little of 
course, so as to give the quick-movin’ device that Paul had in- 
vented a chanst. The quickest record of movin’ they ever made, 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
PAUL’S LAST STAND 229 
Mike says, was one of thirty-nine miles from set to set, and it 
was done in exactly eleven and five-sixteenths seconds. The 
separator was equipped with automatic feeders and blowers 
that would blow the straw out on the fields again for fertilizer, 
and the engine was rigged up with a patent Bunyan condenser 
on the injector pipe that could take in water from the clouds, 
and also had a smokeless smokestack—improvements that was 
put in by Paul. The engine used 400 gallons of water an hour 
and $51 tons of coal, and could develop a horsepower of over 
forty-two thousand. 
Well, the first thrashin’ they done was for a farmer in Al- 
berta. They’d stopped first in a wheatfield, but Paul wanted to 
thrash oats first, he said, so Ole, who was the champion pitcher 
and was pitchin’ for Paul that fall, had to pitch the oats acrost 
three sections of wheat to toss it into the separator. 
Just when they’d got good and started and before they’d 
thrashed more than about 2000 bushel or so, Howie—that’s 
the farmer—come runnin’ up to Paul and says for him to stop. 
“There’s a hen over on the separator that’s starvin’ to 
death,” he yells. “Stop the machine so we can save her. 
Quick!” 
Well, Paul he knowed what it was all right, but just to 
humor the fellow he stopped, and went over with the farmer 
to look at the hen. 
“The poor thing looks as if she hasn’t had a grain to eat 
since old man Noah let her out of the Ark,” Howie says, and 
Paul he just laughed, because he knowed what it was, all right. 
The hen that Howie was feelin’ sorry for was one that Paul 
and Mike had had painted on the separator for advertisin’ to 
show what would happen to any hen that would try to pick a 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  230 PAUL BUNYAN 
livin’ off of the straw that come out of their machine. 
Well, then Mr. Howie took the hen and fed her a couple of 
sackfuls of wheat and oats and took her in to his wife, and she 
laid three carloads of eggs that week—pretty near enough to 
feed the whole crew. 
Durin’ this trip Paul used to have to get sore at the pitchers 
a good many times because they wouldn’t pitch the right kind 
of grain always—when he’d be callin’ for wheat they’d be 
pitchin’ barley, and when he’d be wantin’ clover they’d be 
givin’ him oats sometimes. And one time he got so mad at 
one of the kids, he threw him in the separator, boy, pitchfork, 
bundle of barley and all. But as luck would have it the blowers 
was pointed east on that set and the boy’s home was in Boston 
and when he come out of the blower he was goin’ at such speed 
that he landed up in Lowell, Massachusetts, where he found 
his brother in business conductin’ a gents’ furnishin’ store. So 
it wasn’t so bad for the kid after all. 
About the end of the week Paul and Mike and the outfit 
caught up with the men on motorcycles that had been sent 
ahead, and waited over Sunday, so’s to let em get ahead again 
and sign up some more contracts. 
Ole took advantage of the Sunday lay-over to get good and 
gloriously drunk like old times. 
It was early in the mornin’ before the rest was up, and he 
went out and happened to run into a box car full of whisky 
standin’ on the side-tracks. He broke into the car and drank 
up all the whisky and then he went to look for another carful 
to really get likkered up on, because the first one had only just 
made his appetite good for more. 
He didn’t find another whisky car, though, but a carload
-P-A-G-E-247
  PAUL'S LAST STAND 231 
of musical instruments instead, cornets and flutes and drums 
and fiddles and other things belongin’ to a travelin’ circus 
band, and Ole was just feelin’ good enough from the little 
snack of whisky he’d had so he wanted to show off how good 
he could play, and he took one of the horns and started in to 
play some tune he’d learned in the old country when he was a 
boy but that he didn’t remember so very well. I think it must 
of been that one about old man Noah they sing. 
Anyway it woke Paul up, and Mike says he jumped out of 
bed right away to go out and see what that racket was, and 
there was Ole a-tootin’ away at the horn as loud as he could— 
it was one of them there cornets he had. 
“JT bat you you cannint play so nice a tune like dat,” says 
Ole. 
And Paul he says, “I bet you I can, Ole.” 
And he takes the horn away from Ole and starts in to play. 
But he didn’t play no tune, though. For the very minute he 
started in, with his first breath of wind, that cornet straight- 
ened right out every last kink and curve in it straight up 
against the sky, and the noise it made was heard for 185 miles 
but it was only the one blast and you couldn’t call that no 
tune, so Ole won the bet that time. 
Paul finished his thrashin’ in Canada just before Christmas 
and he and Mike sold out their outfit to an Italian named Pat 
Mahoney, who is still livin’ on a ranch near Moosejaw, Mike 
says. 
That young fellow Mike was sure a great talker, even for 
an Irishman. 
Well, there’s stories, and stories. I don’t suppose I’ve heard 
?em all. His old friends all remember him, and any of ’em will

tell you about Paul. And some of ’em wishes a good many 
times that he was back here loggin’ again; even the young 
fellows who never knowed him, but have only just heard about 
him, would of liked pretty well to’ve been in on the good old 
times, I guess. 
I remember one young fellow that was caught under a car- 
load of logs up here in the pass a couple of years ago where 
I was workin’, where it’d tipped over against the bank and 
pinned him under and mashed both his legs to a pulp and was 
holdin’ him there tight so he couldn’t move at all. And it was 
a couple of hours before they could get enough men together 
to help him out of there. 
“T bet all the while you was layin’ here,” one of ’em says to 
him afterwards, “you was wishin’ mighty hard that some of 
us would hurry and come along and get this timber off of you.” 
“No,” he says. “That wasn’t what I was wishin’ at all. I 
wasn’t worryin’ about the timber none. What I was wishin’ 
was that Paul Bunyan would come along with his old Blue Ox 
and hitch him onto this mountain and pull it out from under 
me. That’s what I was wishin’ all the time.” 
And it’s times like them, or when a tree is goin’ to be falled 
that’s so crooked no mortal can tell which way it’ll go, or 
maybe when a bragger comes to camp that thinks he knows 
more than the next fellow, and has to be took down a peg, or 
maybe when everythin’ about the whole outfit goes haywire 
all at the same time, it’s then that they remember Paul Bun- 
yan and begin to talk about what he could do if he was there; 
and how he used to hew with that big ax of his, on the wove 
grass handle, and how he could twist the biggest tree around 
and make it fall where he wanted it to, and how in the old
-P-A-G-E-249

days he used to hitch Babe onto anythin’ in sight, a whole sec- 
tion of timber even, and haul it down to the river ready for 
the Big Drive in the spring. And then they talk about North 
Dakota. For North Dakota, of course, was the biggest loggin’ 
Paul ever done. )

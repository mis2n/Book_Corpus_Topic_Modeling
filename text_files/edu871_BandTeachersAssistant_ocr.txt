PREFACE.   
The purpose of this work is to furnish Band Teachers, Bandsmen and others with 
a systematic and graded course of music, Theoretical and Practical. It is not designed 
to supersede the professional teacher—neither can any work written do so—its object is to 
aid him and lessen his labors. However, it is thought it will furnish the means whereby 
an intelligent amateur may instruct a young organization with some success by faith- 
fully following the plan laid down, at such times and places as professional aid cannot 
be obtained, or afforded. With this object in view the ‘‘Rudiments of Music” have 
been written, with special bearing on band work and each paragraph numbered so that 
reference may easily be made thereto, as the different subjects arise, when studying the 
practieal parts. 
I have incorporated with the first part a. number of hints on Expression, Tone, 
Taking Breath, Time, Tune, How to Tune Brass Instruments, Transposition and others: 
of equal importance, not found in any one work hitherto published; also several value 
able charts, such as that showing the Compass of all Instruments, Fingering of Piccolo 
and Clarionet on a new and more logical plan than usually followed, charts for the 
various brass instruments and positions of slide trombones. Further, it is believed the 
leader, or student will find the method employed of treating the terms used in music, 
one possessing advantages over that generally pursued. They are divided and placed 
under headings suitable to their different applications, while at the same time a 
phonetic pronounciation and explanation is given. The subject of Scales, Keys and 
Accidentals is also presented in a manner uncommon to the average textbook. The 
idea throughout this part has been to convey the greatest. amount of information pos. 
sible in a clear and concise manner, and with this object tables have been freely 
employed in order to save lengthy explanations, under the opinion that what is made. 
intelligible to the eye by such means, makes a more lasting impression on the tablets ef 
the memory than any wordy definition can possibly effect, 
Part II. commences the practical instramental work. The examples are presented 
in “Condensed Score,” for B flat, E flat and Buss Instruments and accompanied by running commentary and hints on the lessons under study. This feature has not, so. 
far as I am aware, ever been attempted in works of a similar nature, and must prove 
advantageous to the leader, as it places before him all the parts in a graphic manner 
and enables him to see at once what is required from the variousinstraments, With the- 
scales, exercises and chords are interspersed a uumber of amusements, being generally- 
well known part songs, having similar rhythm in all parts, These amusements are all 
“phrased,” and a diligent study of‘them will school the band in the proper method of breathing, cultivate a perception of form in music and promote a good style ot 
ensemble playing. I have used these part songs with the latter point especially in view,. knowing from an extended acquaintance with bands, both as teacher and in the Capac- 
ity of judge at many band tournaments, how very deficient our bands are in unity of 
style and that sympathy in performance termed ensemble playing. 
The various subjects are introduced gradually and in such a manner as to combine- instruction with amusement and lead by easy steps to a respectable degree of pro-~

4 ficiency. The object has been to have all advance alike. Each one is therefore given 
equal work with the other ; to obtain which, it has been thought necessary to ignore 
effects in instrumentation and be solid, rather than fanciful, in the present stage. 
This part treats of the Key of 0, four flat and two sharp keys, leaving a fuller cone 
sideration of the scales, ete., to Part INI, The time signatures are of the simple order, 
with the exception of 6-8. It is proposed to continue this work in other volumes, 
leading from the elementary stage of band playing up to the highest grade of musi¢ 
and finish in performance. Compound time signatures and much other matter omitted 
from this volume will be taken up in those subsequently issued and in their proper con- 
nection. 
: I take this opportunity to offer the suggestion that the teacher will find it facili+ 
tate his work very much if he adopt the tonic sol-fa method of teaching time by the 
/ use of “ TIMm NAMES,’’ as by them the fractional divisions of the ‘‘measure’’ can | be 
expressed with greater perspicuity than by any other means, 
In Part ILL. seales, chords and exercises only, in all keys, are given with such 
preliminary remarks as, it is hoped, will be profitable and interesting. 
Finally, in an appendix is printed an essay on ‘‘Expression in Music,” and a Proe 
nouncing Dictionary of Musical Terms, both of which, it is believed, will prove 
acceptable and valuable to musicians of all degrees. 
It only remains to add, the various parts for each instrument independently, as well 
as the Rudiments separately. may be had from the publisher. AAG

RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
By Arrnun A. Cuarpz, M. M. C. M., 
Editor of Tax Murronoxn. 
SOUND 
1, Everything we hear is termed Sounp. 
2. Sound is the product of aerial disturbances communicated to the tympanum 
of the ear, in intermittent shocks of such extreme rapidity of recurrence, as to 
produce the effect of a continuous tone. 
8. When the area of disturbance is large, the sound at point of generation is 
loud; but when small, is soft, proportionately with the modified degree of 
commotion. 
4, Sound radiates from a given centre in two manners; that is, one originating 
body may throw off regular shocks, or vibrations, while in another they may be of 
a conflicting or complex nature, owing to the differing structure of the two. 
5, Complex vibrations produce Notsx, regular vibrations result in Mustc. 
MUSIC. 
6. Music is at once a Scrence and an Art. A science, as teaching the origin, 
properties and combination of musical sounds; an art, as appealing to our emo- 
tions and the inherent love of the beautiful in nature, 
PITCH. | 
7. The variation in the altitude of sound is called Prrew. 
8. When the aerial vibrations are very rapid they produce high sounds; when 
slow, low sounds are the result, while the mean between the two creates medium 
sounds, 
9. The pitch of musical sounds is expressed on paper by means of a series of 
parallel lines and spaces, eleven lines and ten spaces, each of which is named by a 
letter of the alphabet, the first seven of which are used, viz., A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
-P-A-G-E-6
8 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
STAFF. 
10. The parallel lines and spaces are termed the Great Srarr, and are named 
as follows, viz. : 
LINES. SPACES.   
    
  
  11. For band or orchestra instruments and voice, also for greater conven= 
ience in reading, the Great Staff is divided into three parts. The bottom section, 
representing low or Bass sounds; middle section, medium or Trnor sounds; top 
section, high or TREBLE sounds. 
CLEFS. 
- 12. To show definitely which division of sounds it isintended to employ, char 
acters termed CLE¥s are used. 
18. There are three clefs in general use, viz.: 
GB F, or Bass Clef ; sg C, TgNox, or ALTO OLEF ; 6 G, TREBLE, or SOPRANO Clef, 
14. The clefs are assigned as follows, five lines to each division: 
  
  
  
  
  —s 15. Each division is termed a Starr.   
ADDED (ledger) LINES, 
16, Frequently it becomes necessary to extend the limits of the staff. In such 
cases, short lines termed Leper (Fr., legeré) lines are added, which, with the 
intervening spaces, are named in progressive order similarly with the staff. 
  
  DURATION, 
17. Duration of musical sounds is computed by Brats. 
18, Beats are those movements of the hand, foot, or mechanism, which, like 
the oscillations of a pendulum of a clock, mark the passage of time. 
19, Duration of sound is expressed by characters termed Nores, each of which 
is equal to one or more beats, or to the fractional part thereof. 
20, The unit of Time is ,} one beat, and termed a QUARTER NOTE 
21. A note double the value is .) two beats, terme. a maLF NOTE. 
22. The simple note of longest duration in modern music is — four beats, 
termed & WHOLE NOTE.
-P-A-G-E-7

23. Fractional parts of the unit of time, or single beat, are, 
a = aa dence eet ee eee pte two EIGHTH Notes. 
: = SS .-four SIXTEENTH NOTES. 
= & z = eight THIRTY-sECOND NoTEs. 
24. Oocasionslly irregular quantities, uneven numbers of notes, are employed 
in beats or measures. When such is the case, these uneven groups are denoted 
by figures written above or below.

25. Cessation of sound in music for definite periods, is indicated by RESTS, 
or silences, as follows: viz.: 
mal iad[aBala- a) a= ai BAR LINES. 
26. Bans are short lines drawn vertically across the = and, are used to — = 2 
define quantity or recurring stress of accent in music. 
27. The DOUBLE BAR SE denotes a complete idea, or close; in other worda, 
a full period in music. 
TIME SIGNATURES. 
28. To assist the eye in calculating at a glance the exact quantity of time, or 
beats, included between two or more bar lines, fractional figures are usuaily 
written after the clef at the beginning of a piece of music: a= 
29. The upper of the two figures expresses simply quantity; the lower, quality. 
80. The lower figures, or denominators, generally employed are 2, 4 and 8, 
though occasionally others are used, as 1, 16 and 82. 
81. 2, as the denominator, means a half notes; 
4, “ “ “ “ a quarter notes; 
8% & & OS eighth notes, 
82. The upper figure or enumerator, tells exactly how many half-quarters of 
eighth notes are used in each bar or measure of the music.

83. The character C equals 3 and is termed common time, while qh equals 5 
and is termed ania BREVE (ahilah bray'vay). 
34. The foregcing figures are termed the TIME SIGNATURE. 
35. Time signatures are said to be duple when expressing two beats to the 
measure ; ¢riple when three, and guadruple when four. 
86. They are again simple and compound, as per EX. : 
  
  TIES, OR DOTS. 
37, At times it is necessary to increase the value of a certain sound beyond the 
duration of the simple note. There are two methods of effecting this: first, by 
a __. termed tie, J_.f, which binds the two notes together; second, by the addi- 
tion of a dot, as J. = dS. 
SCALES. 
38. The distance from one sound to the next immediately above or below, is 
termed a TONE, 
39. There are two kinds of tone steps; viz.: Whole Tones and Half Tones. 
40. Two whole-tone steps and one half-tone form a TETRACHORD (Gr., four 
strings). Two tetrachords in following, joined by a uniting tone, making in all 
five whole-tones and two half-tones, form a Dratontc (Gr., through the tones) 
Scare. (Ivau., Scala, a ladder). Vide ex.: 48. 
41, There are two forms of the diatonic scale, viz.: Mason and Minor. 
42. When the half-tones occur between the 3d and 4th, and 7th and 8th, the 
scale is Mason, but when between the 2d and 3d, and 7th and 8th, the scale is 
Minor. 
43. Another kind of scale is the Caromatic (Gr., chroma, color). This scale 
consists entirely of semitones.

KEYS. 
45. It is frequently necessary to change‘the position of the scale, and begin on 
some other sound than c; when such is the case, in order to preserve the above 
order of full-tones and half-tones, certain characters termed SHaRpPs and Fiats 
are used, and, which placed in the signature, retain their influence throughout 
the composition, unless a contradiction intervene, 
46. A sharp, raises the pitch of a line or space, on which written, a half 
tone. On the contrary, a lat, p, lowers the line or space a half tone. 
47, The following table will show the number of sharps or flats necessary for 
each scale alteration of pitch, either Major or Minor:

48, C major and A minor have neither sharps nor flats in the signature. 
Major keys are said to be related to minor keys in the above order. 
49, The first note of a scale is termed the KEY NOTE, and gives its name to 
the scale. 
ACCIDENTALS. 
50. In order to preserve the proper order of half-tones in the minor scale, the 
fifth and sixth degrees must be raised ; to do this accidentals are employed, that is, 
signs other than in the signature. 
51. For this purpose are used (1) the sharp, #, (2) double sharp, x, 
(8) natural, contradiction, or restorer, }. 
52. The double sharp raisesthe pitch of line or space a full tone higher. 
58, The restores a line or space whereon a flat or sharp has been used to its 
normal pitch, (1), by contradicting within the limit of a bar, or measure, only

the sherp or flat in a signature; (2), by contradicting accidentals previously 
employed in a measure. 
54, The double flat, b, is occasionally used, and lowers a line or epace a full, 
tone, 
55. When it is required to contradict a > or bp, the § must be used double 
g 1) where the sound is to be restored to its normal pitch, as in the key of C; but 
if the restoration involve only a half-tone, then the # must be accompanied by a 
sharp or flat, as the case may be. : 
(Gee ee ee Dx becomes Dg. Dx becomes Dg.  Bhh becomes BY. Bp becomes By. 
56. An accidental has influence, (1), in the measure where it appears; (2), 
when written before the last note of one measure it controls the first note only of 
the next, providing such note be on the same line or space (degree) of the staff. 
1 2 
57. The first note in the second measure, unless contradicted, would infer 
the sound of Df; but the second D, and without contradiction, would be Db. 
DESCENDING MINOR SCALES. 
58. The scale patterns given after paragraph 43 show the major and chromatic 
scales to have the same form—that is, the same relation of whole-tones and haif~ 
tones in both ascending and descending forme, while the pattern of the minor 
scale shows simply the ascending form, inferring that a difference exists between 
that and the descending form. 
59, Such difference really exists, and in two forms common to modern prac- 
tice, the first of which we may term the consuncr and the second the pissunct, 
or harmonic form. 
60. The consunct form of the descending minor scale is controlled by the 
key signature, and has five whole-tones and .two-half-tones; but the pissuncr 
torm has three whole-tones, two half-tones and one step of a whole-tone and half.

RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 1) 
CHORDS. 
61. A common cHorD is composed of several sounds selected from the scale, 
which, when played or sung in unison, will produce a pleasing effect upon the 
ear. 
62. The-sounds or tones selected are 1, 3, 5 and 8. 
63. Common chords are (1) major, when the sounds are selected from the 
aajor scale; (2) minor, when drawn from the minor scale. 
64, A combination of 1, 3 and 5 only is termed a TRIAD. 
INTERVALS, 
65. The distance from one sound to another is termed an INTERVAL. 
66. Intervals may be (1) major, (2) minor, (8) augmented, (4) diminished. 
‘The terms perfect and impenfect are at times applied to 4ths and 5ths. 
4th, 5th, 6th, 7th. 8th, or octave. 
(2 SSS SSS Esl HARMONY,   
  
  
  
  
67. The combination of two or more sounds in a pleasing manner constitutes 
the first principle of HARMONY. 
68. Harmony is that branch of music which treats of the grammatical 
arrangement and progression of chords, 
69. Chords are either CoNcoRDS orDiscorDs. Concords when composed of 1, 
major, or minor 8d, perfect 5th, and octave. Discords when other than the fore- 
going intervals are used, as: Concord. Discord. 
70. The two principal chords are : (1) common chord, based on the keynote 
and termed the CHORD oF THE TONIC; (2) the chord based on the 5th of the scale, 
composed of the intervals 1, 8, 5, minor 7 and 8, named the CHORD oF THE 
DOMINANT. 5 o1 8 : ee

V1. The chord next in importance is that built on the 4th degree of the scale 
and named the sus-pommant. Iu the key of C, for instance, the chord of the sub- 
dominant would be, F, A, C and F. 
72. Each degree of the scale has a specific technical name for purposes of 
harmony, as follows: 
Ist degree 
2d degree. .. Tonic. 
. SuPer Tonic.

2 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
73. A combination of three sounds, each at the interval of a 3d from the 
other, is termed a Trrap. 
74, Triads may be formed on each degree of the scale, major or minor, giving 
rise to major, minor, augmented and diminished triads, as per example: 
¢ Major, TRIADS OF THE MAJOR SCALE. 
Tonic. Supertonic. Mediant. Subdominant, Dominant. Submediant. Leading note.

@ Hinor. TRIADS OF THE MINOR SCALE. 
a a a ee Minor. Diminished. Augmented. Minor. Major. Major. Diminished. 
75. All chords are numbered from their base. 
76. Motion of parts in harmony are: (1) contrary, (2) oblique, (8) similar. 
Contrary, where the notesin one part ascend, while in another they descend ; 
oblique, where one part maintains or reiterates the same note, while the other 
moves up or down; similar, where all parts move in the same direction. 
77. CapENcs is a term applied to the close of a phrase or period, including 
the two final chords. 
78. There are four kinds of cadences: (1) AUTHENTIC, (2) Puagat, (3) Im- 
PERFECT, (4) Deceptive. The authentic cadence is a final close or progression 
from dominant to tonic harmony; the plagal cadence forms also a final close, and 
is a progression of subdominant to tonic. ‘This cadence is used chiefly for sacred. 
compositions, and is very effective. The Imperfect cadence is constructed so as to 
form a half close, leading the ear to expect something to follow. It is the close 
of the antecedent, and requires a consequent to lead to finish. The DECEPTIVE 
cadence is formed of any unexpected following of chords which occur at the end 
of phrase or period. | 
79. Mopu.ation is the regular transition by grammatical flow from one key 
to another. 
80. Modulation is of four kinds: (1) Narurat, (2) GrapuaL, (3) Suppen,, 
(4) Exrrangovus. 
{N. B.—Harmony will be discussed exhaustively in a succeeding portion of this work. It is, there: 
fore, treated most briefly here.] 
MELODY. 
81. Sounds so arranged in order of following as to present a complete musica! 
idea and be at the same time interesting, form a MELODY. 
82. The grammar of melody is (1) the MotrvE :

83. Quantity in music may be composed of sound interspersed with silence, 
or rest, and still the continuity of the idea be uninterrupted. 
84, If a melody commence with one or more preliminary notes, 7. ¢., a part 
of a measure, the value of such must be subtracted from the final measure of the sentence 
or subject (complete melody). 
ACCENT. 
85. The leading or primary accent in a melody :s on the note immedi- 
"ately following the bar line. Duple time has primary and secondary accents. 
he Quadruple time has also primary and secondary au 4 
accents, ‘Triple time has primary, secondary god dd 
and tertiary accents. A= 
86. Irregularities of accent are common in music. They are produced by antici- . 
pating or retarding the regular accent and thus throwing on to otherwise sub- 
ordinate beats the stress properly belonging to those usually more important. 
> >> 
Ex. Anticipated. tddida 
Such irregularities of accent are termed syNCOPATION. 
ARTICULATION. 
87. AntrcuLaTion is as important in music as in elocution. 
The signs of articulation are (1) the legato, (lay-gab-to) connected, flowing + -—~— (2) semt-lega- 
to, Tt; staccato, (sta-kab-to) + + - + detached, short ; (4) puntaio, (pun-tah-toh) ' ' ' ' very 
pointed. 
      Legato. Semi-legato. Staccato. Puntato. 
88. When none of above signs are employed, the notes must be played 
smoothly, neither too long nor too short. 
DYNAMICS. 
89. Diminution, force or stresa is expressed by the following signs and 
words: . . tray: -200-‘tO), «..

14 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
SPEED. 
90. Relative speed or time in music is indicated by (1) Italian terms, (2) by 
an instrument called a ‘‘ Mzrronome,” (Met-ro-nome, time measure). 
91. The metronome is a mechanical instrument of somewhat pyramidal shape, 
used to indicate the relative duration of musical sounds. The contrivance con-. 
tains within works resembling those of a clock, having on its exterior front a 
graded scale similar to that of a thermometer. In front of which, but attached 
to the inner works, is an upright balance rod—pendulum—notched to correspond 
with the marks and numerals on the body of the instrument carrying a movable 
regulator—nut—which may be set opposite any number of the scale. The pendu- 
lum being set in motion sways to and fro at the rate per minute indicated by such 
number, making in its passage a ticking noise resembling that of the clock. 
92. John Maelzel, born 1792, who brought the instrument into public notice, 
based his scale on the division of time into minutes, dividing it into 168 degrees, 
taking 40, te represent the slowest, and 208, the quickest movement. Thus, 
when the speed of a piece of music requires an average rate of sixty quarter-notes. 
per minute, the regulator is set to 60 on the graduated scale, thereby causing the 
pendulum to make that number of strokes in the above time. 
93. When reference is made to the metronome to determine speed, it is usual 
to write above the staff, at the commencement of a composition, some such form 
as the following: M.M. J = 80 — meaning Maelzel’s Metronome, 80 quarters to 
the minute, 
94, This plan of marking speed, presenting, as it does, a concrete idea, ia 
most definite and satisfactory; since it determines the rate with a mathematical 
accuracy and precision, to which words or phrases, however carefully selected, 
cannot possibly attain. 
95. The following table will show the approximation of the leading speed 
terms to the metronomic scale; the quarter note being considered the unit:

  EMBELLISHMENTS. 
98. Composers have from time to time resorted to the aid of ausiliary notes 
to embellish their melodies; such notes are known under the general term of 
G@racgs, or Grace Norss. 
99, All such graces must be played in the smoothest possible manner, and 
should be considered as analogous to those ornaments in architecture which, 
nen-essential to the strength of the fabric, are still of great importance in lending 
beauty to the structure.

  RULES FOR PLAYING THE TORN. 
101, (2) When the note succeeding the turn note is one degree higher, the turn 
is direct and composed of four notes, 7. ¢., the note higher, original 
note, note lower and, again, original note, passing thence to note fol- 
lowing the turn. 
@) Similar to a, only resting longer on first note for dot. 
(@) When the turn note is dotted, rest on that note 3-168 of its value, turn- 
ing three notes; 4. ¢., upper, original and lower, returning to original 
note, giving it the value of the dot before proceeding. 
@) When the note following the turn note is one degree or more below,
-P-A-G-E-17
RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 17 
the turn is inverted. Begin’turn one degree lower, original note one 
degree higher, returning to original note before proceeding. 
Gf) A 4, or, written above the turn indicates that the upper note of the 
turn must be played sharp or flat; when written below, the effect is on 
lowest note. . 
ABBREVIATIONS. 
102. Abbreviations are a kind of musical shorthand, employed to express 
briefly some note or passage previously written. 
Jn fall. oa ee pleas oe 
@ (| (a) | 
Abbreviated. = 
103. Repxats are a species of abbreviation employed to save re-writing one 
or more measures, section, or even a whole melody. 
104. One measure to be re-written may briefly be expressed by an oblique 
stroke and two dots, thus: rad .. , 2 half-measure, the oblique stroke 
without the dots. z ° 
105. Two or more measures to be re-written may be conveniently expressed by 
a repeat, thus: a JT 3 ST 
106. Should the last measure, or more, of a phrase, section or subject vary 
in its second ending, the abbreviating repeat may still be used by employing prone 
parentheses over the differing measures. In the first case, the words Prima 
Vorta (ist time) abbrev. Ima volta; in the second, Smconpa Vora (2d time), 
abbrev: 2d volta, are used to indicate that the measures included under 1st volta 
are to be ommitted on reaching them the second time, and that those marked 2d 
volta are to be substituted therefor, thus: 
ist volta Vea voita t 
a JT 1 tt 
107. The Pausx sign ™ (Ital., pausa, pah-oo-sah), has two significations: (1) if 
written over a note or rest, such may be protracted at pleasure; (2) if written 
over a double bar, jj, it signifies the point of finish. 
108. The words Da Capo (dah kah-po), or D. C., signify a repeat, and mean 
from the beginning. 
109. When the words al jine (ail fee-nay, to the end), are added to the fore- 
going, D. C. al fine, the whole phrase means, return to the commencement and 
play to the sign ~ there finish : 
PIT TT i PT Tt at 
110. The sign ¢ is used at.any point; but if it be required to return to that 
sign instead of to the beginning, the words Dan Seano (dahl say-no, from the 
sign); or, D. 8. are used. Al fine has the same application as in section 96:

18 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
EXPRESSION. 
111. Expression in music is of two kinds: (1) MzcranroaL, (2) ARTISTIC. 
112. Mechanical Hapreasion demands the most rigorous attention to all the 
details entering into the construction of, or form in a melody: as motive, section, 
phrase, sentence, subject, articulation, accentuation and the dynamical effects of 
P; Pp, f, ff, etc.—all of which come under the head of Purasrve. Yet, with all 
this, the performance may be unsatisfactory. It is cold and stiff; displays intelli- 
gence but no feeling, It has the perfection of a beautiful statue, but no life. 
113, Artistic Expression is the vivifying influence which, breathing on 
music, wakens it into life. The possessor of this attribute has genius. Refine- 
ment of taste is natural to him; he has innate the faculty of imbuing the conven- 
tionalities of music with an illuminating intelligence, the radiations of which 
reach deeply into the sympathies of his listeners. 
In point of fact, he identifies himself with the music, his soul absorbs it; it 
permeates his being, his technical skill becomes merely the vehicle by which 
“what he feels is communicated to his hearers. Artistic expression, includes 
mechanical accuracy, but idealizes and lifts it from the region of the mortal inte 
the sphere of the divine. 
Vulgar mannerism is the opposite of artistic expression and should be neither 
encouraged nor applauded. 
TONE. 
114. The power to produce a good tone lies much in the hands ef the per- 
former on any wind instrument. To acquire such demands, (1) a good instrument 
wherein all the essentials exist, as perfect tone, flexible, resonant, brilliant and 
sympathetic tone and ease of blowing; (2) a carefully critical method of practice, 
slow sounds, scales and intervals, subordinating agility for the time being to the 
task of building up the embouchure (lips and muscles thereof); (8) cultivation of 
the aural faculties to a high degree, without which there can be no correct 
intonation; (4) a proper method of inspiration and respiration, breathing freely 
by direct lung action and bringing the whole of those members into play, not 
confining the breathing to the upper part only. . 
. ” TAKING BREATH, 
115. The lungs should be well inflated with air before commencing to play. 
The expenditure should be economical, and the production of the best possible 
result from the smallest amount of exertion always the effort, 
Do not breathe more than is necessary. On the other hand, itis wrong to 
continue playing until the lungs are thoroughly exhausted. Take breath noise- 
lessly at.convenient points in the performance, numbers of which present them- 
selves, if the laws of phrasing be property attended to. Full breath should inva- 
riably be taken during a long silence, or rest; half breath on short rests, and 
quarter breath, if necessary, after motives, sections, phrases, etc. (See par. 82). 
TIME, 
116. Playin time! On all occasions when practicing, the greatest care should 
be taken to conform to a certain standard oftime. Scales and exercises should 
be practiced in strict time throughout, at slow gait until the fingers become
-P-A-G-E-19
RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 19 
accustomed to their work and the physique be formed, more rapidly as the diffi- 
culties are overcome, but always in time, with due regard to evenness and accent. 
Time is a perception that must be cultivated, and which can only be brought to 
perfection by most rigid care. Form the habit of playing in time. The metro- 
nome is a useful guide. 
TUNE. 
117. The perception of tune cannot be too sedulously cultivated. Without 
tune all other efforts are futile. T%me, tone and tune are the leading essentials of 
all musical efforts, but the greatest is tune. Form the habit of judging intervals 
méntally correct, then you can produce them on an instrument; but not otherwise. 
The mind must be educated through the eye and the ear through both. Never 
play with another performer who habitually plays out of tune; his faults may 
affect you and vitiate your powers of aural discrimination. 
HOW TO TUNE BAND INSTRUMENTS, 
118. Band instruments, to obtain perfect balance or equality of tune, should 
be tuned on a similar method with that adopted by the piano tuner; ¢. ¢., by a 
series, or cycle of 5ths, thus: 
3 - 3 3 B13 3 3 } ———— ——. 
f= SSeS 43

The different ways of fingering should nl seated, or compared one with the 
other, and no effort spared to insure the most accurate intonation throughout the 
whole band, The mere effort must undoubtedly have a good effect.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
MUSICAL LIBRARY. 
119, All grades and qualities of music are now published so cheaply that there 
ean possibly be no excuse for a band having a poor repertoire. It-is a fallacy, 
which interested publishers and men of vitiated taste, rampant under the much 
abused titles of composers and arrangers, have an object in perpetuating, to sup- 
- pose that no music is good unless difficult, or that music written down to the 
capacity of the youngest band must necessarily be of inferior musical worth. On 
the contrary, there is much difficult music which is simply atrocious, while at the 
same time many simple melodies are perfect specimens of musicianly writing, and 
truly enchanting. 
Band music should be selected for its educating, esthetic and entertaining 
qualities. It cannot be educative unless it be well written, conforming in all 
particulars to the grammar of music, neither esthetic unless the composer be a 
man of profound feeling and refined susceptibilities, nor entertaining unless the 
pedantic rules, fully availed of, be made by the genius of the writer to subserve 
his purpose of producing music whose parts shall be interesting to all. 
So called popular music is not all bad, though undoubtedly true art would 
have advanced more rapidly had much of it never been written, neither are the
-P-A-G-E-20
200 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
works of the old school of writers uniformly good. There have been good and 
bad at all times, and the present is no exception; but the object should be to 
select the best from all epochs. Gcod music, old or new always wears well; it 
will bear repetition; while the poor, vulgar variety show twaddle, hashed up into 
fantasies, not only becomes wearisome but is positively deleterious. Therefore, 
select only music which will refine the mind and ennoble the feelings, irrespective 
of its age, or nationality, and shun that which administers only to the depraved 
taste of the lower and enervated order of amusement-seekers, Cultivate a taste 
for what is pure and good in art. Do not trust to the representations or remarks 
on a prece of music in any publisher’s catalogue; but rather examine for your- 
selves whether this piece or that, really answers your purpose in being good and 
adaptable to the capacity of the band at large. To do this it is absolutely neces- 
sary to examine the piece in detail and as a whole. Sample parts can give you 
no idea, or at least a very feeble one, of the arrangement, for as every intelligent 
musician knows the finest compositions may be utterly ruined by an incompetent 
transcrib r, while an indifferent theme may be made quite interesting at the hands 
of an efficient arranger.

SCHOOLS, OR METHODS FOR EVERY INSTRUMENT. 
121. For the convenience of those who have the laudable ambition of studying 
their instruments from the stage of the embryo to that of the artist, the following 
list of very excellent methods and schools has been prepared : 
Coxrnet.—Langey, Caussinus, St. Jacome, Kosleck, Arban, Bonnisseau. 
Es ALro.—Langey. 
Frence Horn.—Langey, Franz, Hoffmann, Klotz. 
Sipe Tromponz.—Langey, Dieppo, Wirth, Bonnisseau. 
BanrironE or Tenor.—Langey, Hoffman, Wirth. 
Tusa.—Langey, Hoffman. 
Evupyonton.—Langey, Hamilton (Eb, Bb or C), Bonnisseau. |

CLARIONET.—Langey, Klose, Lazarus, Baermann (the finest work ever 
written). 
Bassoon.—Langey, Jancourt and Bordogny. 
Saxoraonz.—Hoffman, 
The ‘‘Langey” series of methods contain excellent material for. the first 
two years’ study. They embody a fine collection of progressive studies.   
TRANSPOSITION. 
122. The original, or pattern scale is that of C, in major, or A, in minor. 
All other scales, higher or lower, are simply transpositions, each bearing the same 
proportion in its component parts and with respect to the key-note, as is the case 
in the normal scales. Now, it follows from this, that if a scale may be placed at 
a different pitch without injury to the sequence of its tones, so may a melody or 
an entire composition. Transposition is necessary where a composition goes be- 
yond the compass of voice or instrument which it is intended shall perform it. 
The orthodox method of effecting transposition is by use of the various clefs, and 
really, in reading a score containing a number of parts in many keys, is the only 
practical method of rendering the same instantaneously comprehensible to the eye. 
But ordinarily the simpler method is by numbers. This method, necessarily, im- 
plies ® knowledge of all key signatures, and of course, the construction of the 
scale. The first thing to be done is to decide the signature of the key into which 
it is intended to transpose the music under consideration; next, to remember the 
numerical relation of each tone in the scale to the new key note. For instance, the 
scale of C major, without sharps or flats, transposed to the key of, say F major, 
with one flat, would present the following appearance, viz: 
_ lant 
Cc. D. E. F. G. A. B. C. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8 
F. @. A. B(flat) C. D. E. F. a—~ Aw 
It will be noticed that the figures are the same for each scale, and also, that _ 
the semi-tones, indicated by ~~— , occur at similar points in each. From this 
it will be evident, that in transposition of melodies, care must be taken to preserve
-P-A-G-E-22
22 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
the same relation of sounds to the key note in the new key, as appeared in the 
original. In other words, an accidental sharp, flat, or natural in one key, must 
find its equivalent in the other, and the natural order of key tones must coincide 
in the copy with those of the model. The following transpositions of ‘‘'The Last 
Rose of Summer” will serve to show this method of transposition and make the 
subject clear.

THE TONAL SYSTEM. 
123. The entire range of sounds covered by the instruments of band or 
orchestr may be stated at from six to seven octaves. In six octaves the names of 
sounds will repeat themselves six times, and so on. For convenience of reference 
it is usual to name the octaves commencing from the lowest, as Double Great, 
Great, small, once lined, twice lined, three lined, etc., etc. This system was 
introduced in Germany during the sixteenth century. (See table.)

HINTS ON KEEPING AN INSTRUMENT IN ORDER. 
125. More wind instruments are ruined by carelessness as to the first essential, cleanli- 
ness, than by actual wear. The accumulation of dirt on the exterior or the slimy 
deposit of saliva in the interior impairs their musical usefulness by making them diffl- 
cult to operate, hard to blow, throwing them out of tune and injuring the tone. I 
have seen instruments sent to the repairer which were in good order otherwise, but 
positively filthy. This malodorous filth had led the owner to suppose his instrument 
out of order and needing the offices of the repairer, when all it wanted was a thorough 
eleansing, which he might have done for himself and saved a few dollars. The com- 
plaint is often heard, ‘My instrument was formerly easy to blow and well in tune, but 
now it blows hard and is out of tune, ete.”” In nearly every instance the secret of the 
change is, DiRT. 
To keep instruments clean is an easy matter if it be attended to regularly, and is 
economy, as it insures them wearing much longer than if allowed to go dirty. Saliva 
contains actively destructive properties, and if allowed to remain in an instrument, will 
eat its vital parts away with astonishing rapidity. It rots the wood of wooden instru- 
ments and the solder in the joints of brass instruments, It is, therefore, obvious, that 
great care should be taken to keep them clean, and a band leader owes it to himself 
and those under him to frequently caution them on this point. 
WOOD INSTRUMENTS. 
126, Clarionets, flutes, oboes, bassoons and reed instruments generally should never 
be laid aside after using without first drying the instrument thoroughly inside and round 
the joints. This may be effected by use of the silk or woolen swabs usually sold with 
the instrument, or with silk or cotton rag. I prefer a silk rag to anything. The inside 
of wood instruments should be treated to a slight application of salad oil (never water) 
about once a month. This will keep the pores closed and render the interior impervious 
to the moisture of condensed breath or saliva. Asa preventitive against cracking, 
especially in a hot climate, it is advisable to take off all the keys and then immerse the 
instrument in oil for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. This should be done about 
once a year. The instrument should, of course, be quite dry before itis submitted to 
this process, The finger and key holes should be kept free from dirt by use of a piece 
of wood sharpened somewhat resembling the blade of a pen knife. Such an implement 
is all that is needed and preferable to a knife for the purpose, the sharp edge of the 
tatter being apt to injure the holes. It is a good plan to keep @ dry shaving brush or 
feather to use on the instrument to free the keys and spring from dust, after playing 
on the march or in the open air. The faces of the pads should be occasionally wiped 
off with a rag saturated slightly with oil, and which, besides taking off any foreign 
corrosive matter that may be on them, will tend to preserve the leather or skin and” 
keep it soft and pliable. Care should be taken that oil be not applied in sufficient 
quantity to soak through the covering to the material inside, as such would deaden the 
elasticity of the pad. The screws and springs should often be cleaned and oiled, in 
fact every precaution taken to preserve the instrument in as fine state as possible, and 
thus insure its wearing well and affording pleasure in playing thereon, by enabling the 
performer to manipulate it without undue exertion. The joints should be regularly 
greased with a little deer tallow to make them work easy in the sockets. Should 
they become swollen and the instrument impossible to take apart (as is sometimes the 
case in badly fitted joints and where the moisture can lodge), the instrument should be 
aid aside until thoroughly dry, when in most cases it will be easy to operate the parts.

Sometimes, owing to the presence of some adhesive substance, this is not effective 
To such instances the instrument should not be tampered with by inexperienced hands, 
but sent at once to some reputable maker or repairer. 
In spite of the greatest care, wood instruments will crack. Should such occur, 
“a stitch in time saves nine,” to use ahomely aphorism, The moment the crack is 
noticed the instrument should be pegged at the extreme point to which the crack hag 
extended. This prevents its further progress. The split should then be drawn together 
in a vice (protected on its faces) and pinned, so as to prevent its reopening. It is well 
to fill the split while open with softened shellac, any of which remaining when the 
crack is drawn together will harden and prevent any wind escaping, The mouthpiece 
of a clarionet or saxophone is liable to become swollen or warped by absorption of 
moisture after long use. This trouble will aifect the “lay” and cause difficulty, if 
not impossibility, in fitting the “reed.” To correct this evil a man of experience is 
alone competent, a person unaccustomed to such work may, by attempting it, 
irreparably injure the mouthpiece. However, occasions may arise where the deranges 
ment is only temporary, that is, the mouthpiece swollen by moisture may, if laid 
aside for a few days and allowed to dry, resume its original shape. {t should not be 
tampered with until the latter has been tested, as the uneven part, if filed down when 
the mouthpiece is moist, will result in a depression when it becomes dry. Oil should 
be applied to the mouthpiece and permitted to soak in thoroughly before it is again 
used. ao 
BRASS INSTRUMENTS. 
127, The chief trouble with brass instruments is to keep the interior clean and free 
from corrosive sceumulations, as such injure both tone and tune and make them hard. 
to blow. Saliva deposits will collect not only in the tube near the mouthpiece, but in 
the valves and more remote tubes. There are several methods of cleaning the inside 
of brass instruments. ‘The valves being held down some tepid water may be passed 
through, or water and small shot may be used in similar manner, or a small piece of 
wetted sponge may be blown from the mouthpiece joint through the instrument several 
times. . In all cases the instrument should be thoroughly freed from water that may 
have been used. To do this, draw the 3d valve slide, and with valves down blow 
through the instrument vigorously for a few moments. The slides should ve occasion= 
ally drawn and cleaned, after which, a little tallow rubbed lightly on them will ensure 
their working freely. 
If the valves become sluggish in their action they should be withdrawn, and they 
and the valve boxes thoroughly cleansed with soap and warm water. If, after this, 
they still be obstinate, it will be found a good plan to take a little very finely pulverized 
pumice stone mixed with oil to paste-like consistency and apply same to the valves, then 
to work them up and down in their boxes for a few moments. This substance should 
subsequently be thoroughly removed from the parts affected with warm water and 
soap. It should be remembered that tallow >r oil, if allowed to remain on the vaives, 
will impede their free action. If, as is sometimes the case, a slide becomes set, it may 
be loosened by tapping it with a small wooden mallet at the point where the 
trouble is suspected to be; should that fail of effect, the part may be held over a quick, 
hot flame for a few seconds, which causing the ou'er tube to expand while the inner 
one remains at its ordinary dimension, will invariably enable the slide to be drawn, 
Should noither be successful, the only remaining method is to unsolder the joints and 
by force remove the inner tube, When this bee»mes necessary the iustrument 
should be placed in the hands of a maker or repairer.

RUDIMENTS OF MOSIO. 2 
The exterior of a brass or silver plated instrument ‘s easily kept clean if attended 
to regularly. The great desiderata of any composition adapted for cleaning brass ine 
struments is, that it shall have the necessary qualities for removing any corrosions, and 
at same time be free from gritty ingredients. The best of these, and a highly desirable 
and useful article, is the ‘Peerless’? Metal Polish, which may be had from any dealer. 
Among other things used for cleaning brass, may be mentioned the juice of a lemon. 
It may be applied with a piece of woolen cloth, or the lemon itself (cut) may be rubbed 
on the instrament. Afterwards, the parts should be cleaned off with « piece of oiled 
rag and then rubbed over with a clean rag until none of the oil remains, (The contact 
of lemon with brass generates a deadly poison. Care should, therefore, be taken in 
handling it, and what remains of the lemon or juice should be destroyed). 
A silver plated instrument that has become tarnished may be cleaned with warm 
soap and water, or a solution of ammonia or alcohol, applied with soft brush or cloth, 
Chalk should never be used, as it tends to wear the plating. A good article ” r cleane 
ing silver instruments is silver soap. Another thing that may not be out. place to 
mention here, is, the fact that the perspiration of. the hand possesses properties highly 
injurious to plating. It would be a good plan to wear a glove on the hand that grasps 
the instrument, or, after such times as the hand has perspired freely, to wipe off the 
parts with a wet cloth. The former is perhaps the better plan, as it prevents contact, 
and an ounce of prevention, they say, is worth a pound of cure. 
After playing upon wind instruments, and before laying them aside, every dr p 
of water should be removed. . 
DRUMS. . 
128. Drums used in bands are of two kinds, viz.: bass drums and snare, or side 
drums, The principle of construction is in each the same. A circular shell of wood 
or thin metal on which are braced to a suitable degree of tension, two vellum heads, 
the best being that made from calfskin. Combined they form what may technically 
be termed a resonance box, the air in which is set in vibration by concussion—a blow 
from the stick, or sticks. To impart a higher degree of brilliancy to the snare drum, 
from eight to nine or even more sheep-gut strings are strung across the lower, or 
. “snare head,” the upper being termed the beating, or ‘‘ batter head.” The latter 
should be the thicker of the two. The means for bracing the heads toa proper degree 
of tension, by means of counter hoops and cords acted on by leather tugs or braces, 
or the more modern appliances of rods and serews are familiar to everyone. It will 
easily be understood that the tone of drums depends much on keeping the heads in 
good condition, properly mounted on the ‘flesh hoops” and shell and at an even 
tension, 
To mount the heads on the flesh hoops, they should be rendered flexible by soaking 
in water, then laid out on some level surface—a table or something of the kind—after- 
wards placing the flesh hoops on them in such position that the margin of vellum will 
be equal all around. Next, turn the vellum over the hoop at one point, tucking it 
snugly under the same, using some smooth, thin but blunt instrument for so doing, 
then crossing to the opposite side repeat the process, and similarly until the whole re- 
maining margin of the head is ‘‘ lapped’’ around the hoop, care being taken that the 
stretching is even and no wrinkles appear after the operation is completed. Place tht 
heads on the shell and brace moderately tight, by means.of counter hoops, etc.3 
bracing gradually and always from opposite sides, When the heads are dry and the 
drums are needed for use, the bracing process, to obtain the required tension, should 
invariably be performed in the same manner; as uneven bracing will warp the flesh

2b RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
hoops and throw the drums generally out of order. After a drum has been used and 
before putting away, the braces should be slackened. This relaxation of tension tends 
to preserve the heads. The snare bead of a side drum, should it burst, may be 
darned or patched without greatly impairing the tone of the drum, but the batter 
head must at all times preserve its elasticity aud present an unbroken medium for the 
play of the vibratiors. This head should, therefore, be selected with care and for its 
even density. 
Should the wooden shell of a dram crack, it may be remedied by boring a small 
hole at the extremes of same, drawing the edges together, after inserting a little glue, 
and then firmly gluing a piece of canvass on the inner side of the shell. The holes 
bored should be plugged. 
ON INSTRUMENTATION OF BANDS, 
129, There is a noticeable and growing tendency to change entirely, or modify, the 
instrumentation of bands. Formerly it was the exception to find bands possessed of reed 
instruments; now a band exclusively brass is becoming so rare as to be singular. 
Bandsmen are rapidly becoming educated in the matter of “tone color,” and look for 
more variety than hitherto, The monotoacus uniformity of tone of the purely brass 
band is becoming as distasteful as that of the reed organ, and bandsmen are on the 
lookout to introduce such instruments into their organizations as will impart variety 
thereto. They have outgrown the schoolboy stage, where quality is estimated by the 
amount of noise; and, with more cultivated tastes, seek for delicacy of tonal shading, 
contrasts of tone tints, and with a strength of ensemble which, uniting all requisite 
attributes, shall present a homologous tone, where beauty and grace are combined with 
force and character. 
The transition from reed to brass bands is yet in embryo. We may therefore 
naturally expect to find some mistakes made as to what proportion of reed to brass is 
required to establish auu preserve a correct balance. Rules may be laid down and may 
apply well in some cases, while in others the circumstances are such that they avail but 
little, Yet, where the abilities of all performers in a band are about equal, it may be 
accepted as a general rule that a properly constituted reed, or military band, should 
consist of about equal proportions of brass and reed. I say about; but the inelina- 
tion should be to make the reed section somewhat stronger, numerically, than the brass, 
The reason is too obvious to need comment. 
Broadly speaking, there are three varieties of tone in the band, viz.: REED, BRASS 
and PERCUSSION; but more minutely stating it, the possible contrasts, by judicious com- 
binations of the different members of the distinct groups, one with the other, furnish so 
many apparently original qualities of tone as to be almost inexhaustible. In this respect, 
one is somewhat analogous with the seven primary colors, which, by blending one with 
the other, are made to produce an interminable quality of shades, some so remarkable 
as to appear almost like new colors. The brass section of itself inclines to harshness, 
It has strength, but little variety; force, but very limited scope. In the wide range of 
the tonal system, it resembles a man chained to a stake in the midst of a garden, where 
beautiful flowers and delicious fruits surround him on every hand. He has seized those 
within his reach, but sighs in vain for those beyond, So, similarly, the brass band is 
confined in scope; it is chained to the stake of, what may be termed, elementary music, 
while the vast fields of music teeming around and beyond with choice things, lies out of 
its reach. Not so, however, the well-balanced military band, where everything is within 
ita possibility, from the simplest medley to the highest symphonic form. Bandsmen, in 
adding the reed element to their orgcnizations, are, therefore, extending their capabili-
-P-A-G-E-31
RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 2? 
ties, amplifying their resources and increasing the possibilities of extracting pleasure 
from the practice of music, 
And now, a suggestion, culled from experience, as to what combination of wind 
instruments forms an effective instrumentation for all purposes, street and concert. 
The effort should be to introduce as many different shades of tone as possible, un- 
der the proviso, however, that all such (rhythmical instruments excepted) shall be of 
distinctly musical quality. 
In pursuance of this, an organization is built up where strength, united with 
variety, presents in the consummation a powerful body of tone, yet susceptible to mod. 
ifications of extreme beauty in detail. Such, being characterized by symmetry, and 
great homogeneity, is exquisite, possible, and worthy of attainment. 
The following specimen instrumentation will be found to possess many, if not all, 
of the above requisites, viz.:

ON BALANCE OF TUNE, 
180, Balance of tone in band or orchestra is a matter that should claim the attention 
not only of leaders, but also of members of such organizations, By the above term is 
meant that equality of tone which is the result of each member being in full sympatny 
with the other performers, seeking to produce an even and regular tone on his own 
instrument, which shall not over shadow that of others, or ina way mar that homologous 
effect which should be the great aim of the collective performance of a band or orches- 
tra, Yet, how frequently we hear some one man—or perhaps more—ruining the 
snsemble by his very pronounced performance, and—it cannot be characterized otherwise
-P-A-G-E-32
28 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
than—egotistical individualism. Amateur organizations and players of subordinate 
instruments are not alone guilty of this, I have heard professional bands and players 
of leading instruments induiging in the same faulty style of playing—especially is it 
noticeable among cornet and trombone players. 
if performers will remember at all times that pure harmony can only be the result 
pf chords of well balanced constituent tones, they will readily perceive that to exagger~ 
ate one or the other will be to destroy the proportions, and this does not apply to an 
isolated case alone, but throughout an entire composition, 
If any part needs to be more prominent than the other, it is, of course, the leading 
part or melody; but even there the varied rhythm and thematic figures will serve to 
bring that especial part into notice without undue exertion, Thorefore, in pieces 
of very full instrumentation equality should be maintained between the parts, and not, 
as is too frequently heard, a kind of pitched battle waged between them as to who 
shall make the most noise. When soldiers on parade are marching and wish to pre- 
serve a correct alignment, they find it necessary to feel each other by contact of 
shoulder to shoulder and still to be on the alert. Ins:rumentalists should, when play- 
ing in concert, deem it their duty to perform parts allotted them by sympathy one with 
the other, and still be watchful lest some difficulty of technique in an unexpected place 
shall cause them to obtrude an unwarrantable volume of tone and thus destroy the 
smoothness of the piece, Accompanying parts should at all times be subordinate to 
solo, and if that be soft they should be softer; in other words, they should bear the 
relation of about piano to pianissimo, or one degree of tonal force less, and more neces- 
sarily so where tne solo instrument is of weaker tone than those accompanying, as is 
frequently the case in band arrangements wher» a clarinet has the solo. In orchestras 
the brass play almost invariably too loudly, a fact more noticeable in small than in 
large ones. Players on brass instruments never seem to realize that the quantity or 
volume of tone suitable for a very large orchestra is altogether too much for one of 
from five members up to, say, twenty. Thus it comes about that the effects in many 
pieces are entirely destroyed by the too loud accompaniment of the brass, and where 
we should hear a well executed figure from the violins, flute or clarinet, we hear a solo 
bab! t from the cornets or trombones, with an indefinite accompaniment from the other 
instruments. A little thought on the part of players generally would remedy this 
widely distributed fault, as grotesque in effect—if it were not painful to the auditory 
nerves—as would be the work of the painter who should, while striving by an ap- 
pended name to impress the observer with the importance due what should be his chief 
figure, has so amplified some point of detail as to really exalt & to the position which 
attracts the most attention. 
SIMILARITY OF FINGERING BETWEEN FLUTES AND REED INSTRUMENTS. 
181. Probably one of the greatest obstacles which has hitherto existed in the way 
of the more general introduction of reed instruments, flutes and piccolos, in Amer- 
icau hands, is the fallacy that their fingering presents very great difficulties to be 
overcome, Many band teachers to save themselves trouble have for yeara 
preached and upheld this erroneous opinion. That it 1s erroneous, the familar 
example of the ordinary one-keyed flute, or vulgar whistle, on which everyone 
can play a tune, is sufficient to prove. Yet, in truth, no one of the reed instru- 
ments, such as saxophone, sarrusophone, bassoon, or oboe, or the various genus 
of fiute presents so great difficulty to play well as the hackneyed instruments be~ 
fore referred to, (The clarinet has been purposely omitted us it must come in
-P-A-G-E-33
RUDIMENTS OF MUsIC, 
for special consideration later on.) The keys which have so formidable an appear. 
ance, and to the uninitiated seem to involve endless complications, are really so 
many aids, as those can appreciate who have ever been compelled to make shift 
with a keyless instrument. Any man who has mastered the technic of the flute 
has gained a key to the fingering of all wood and reed instruments; many of them 
are almost identical in the fingering, reading from the same notes; take, for 
instance, the oboe, saxophone, sarrusophone and flutes, where at least two octaves 
are fingered almost precisely the same, while among the remaining upper notes 
the-differences are so slight as to cause but little trouble to master, The bas~ 
soon is also very similar in fingering with the above from the moment the front 
holes begin to be used, that is, from F, below the bass staff; so that allowing for 
the different positions of the notes on the two staves (treble and bass), the 
mastery of one,.as before inferred, furnis'es a key to the others. Of course, 
there are notes from F down to BB flat that are peculiar to the basgoon, the 
counterpart in fingering of which can be found on no other instrument. These 
must be specially learned, but when it is known that the keys for the production 
of these notes are controlled with the thumb of the left hand, with one excep- 
tion, and that for the thumb of the right hand, it will be seen the difficulty ia 
not by any means insuperable. Technically, the reason for this similarity of 
Gngering lies in the fact that the harmonics, or overtones, on all the foregoing 
instruments, follow each other in the ratio of 1, 2, 3, 4, ete., the first overtone 
being in the octave; whereas, on the clarinet, the overtones follow in the ratio of 
1, 8, 5, 7, and the first overtone is a twelfth from the lowest sound, This fact 
anderstood explains the difference between the saxophone and clarinet, and fur- 
nishes a key by which to overcome whatever difficulty may appear to lie in that 
difference. In other words, the fingering of the lower octave on flute, saxoe 
phone, oboe, etc., may be considered identical with that of the octave higher; 
but on the clarinet the first nine notes from small e to once-lined J are followed 
by three other notes before the same fingering (thumb key on upper joint exe 
tepted) is resumed at the twelfth—that is, at once-lined % or B on third line 
treble clef, and eo on up to thrice-lined £, Now, this upper octave on the 
¢larinet is identical in fingering with the lower sounds of oboe, saxophone, ete. 
Those not acquainted with any of the above instruments may not see the full 
force of the above; but, no doubt, those who do possess some knowledge of 
them will at once recognize the fact that to become conversant therewith (at 
least sufficient for teaching the fingering) is not a matter of such great difficulty 
as is generally supposed, and certainly not beyond the speedy acquirement of any 
‘man who would be considered a progressive band teacher. The remaining essen 
tials for mastery of the foregoing are the same as required for all wind instru. 
ments, viz.: good ear, flexible lip and perseverance. 
ON FINGERING OF BRASS INSTRUMENTS. 
182, One and the same principle applies to all brass instruments with valves, 
‘and when that is clearly understood, there is no difficulty in formulating a table of fin 
gering for such in any key. 
Given, a tube sounding C as its fundamental to: ‘t tube will be found to give 
also several other tones in a rising series, technivaily termed harmonics, The tones
-P-A-G-E-34
8u RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
may be expressed in figures, as 1, 2, 8, 4, 6, 6, 7 and 8. Number 1 represents the 
** pedal ;”’ two, the sound common to ordinary requirements; three, a bth above the 
latter ; four, an octave; and the others in regular dominant chord order. Thus, a 
cornet, for instance, the nominal “‘ open” tone of which is C, will give fundamental 
© (sounding in second space bass clef), then &, g, £,9, 8, b flat and &. 
Now, as the p.tch of a wind instrament depends on the length of the tubing, it 
follows that any additional tubing will alter the pitch and make it lower. The purpose 
of the valves on a brass instrument is to place the power of increasing the length of 
the primary tube, within certain limits, at the will of the performer. There are come 
monly three of these valves, acting ou threv additional lengths, in a primary sense. 
These valves lower the pitch as follows: 2d valve, one semi-tone; Ist valve, one whole 
tone; 8d valve, one tone and a half, 
By combination of one valve with the other, really adding the two lengths together, 
we get a secondary series, as follows: 
2d and 8d valves, two tones. 
1st and 8d valves, two and a half tones, 
Ast, 2d and 8d valves, three tones. 
and also the duplicate of the 8d valve, in the 1st and 2d. ‘Thus, there are four lengthe 
by primary tubes; and again four by combination of one or more with the others, 
These primary lengths, as well as those effected by combination, have each the power 
of generating a series of sounds similar in ratio with the above. Therefore, reverting 
to the example of the open tube of a cornet, it will be perceived that the vaives may be 
used to produce the following series of sound: (See chart showing fingering of three 
valve brass instruments.)

  This furnishes a clue to the fingering of any brass instrument, no matter in what 
key it may stand. The only question to decide at starting is, “‘ What is the nominal 
open fundamentai sound of the instrument?” This established, all else is easy, as the 
same rule applies everywhere, a fact that is demonstrated in the band itself, where all 
instruments (though in different keys) playing in the treble clef have been taught the 
same method of fingering, while those again playing in the bass clef, where the actual 
sound has been taken into consideration, finger apparently differently. In some bands 
the bass trombone in @ is used. The open tube here gives GG (actual pitch) as the fan-

damental tone, with a rising series of harmonics in similar ratio with those given, G, 
Ast line bass clef, being its first practical sound on the open tube, Proceeding in the 
manner above described, the fingering of this instrument may easily be deduced. 
The 4th valve, with which some instruments are fitted, is a duplicate of the 1st 
and 8d, but may be used in combination with any one or more of the other vaives, 
giving rise to what may be termed a tertiary or third series of sounds. (See chart for 
euphonium.) 
With respect to slide trombones the same rule applies. The first sounding length 
of this instrument is when the slide is in the closed or first position. Whatever funda- 
mental sound may be obtainable in that position is the one from which the instrument 
isnamed, Thus the E flat alto gives E flat; Bb tenor, Bb; G bass,G,andsoon, On 
each the slide is susceptible of seven positions, giving rise to seven series of sounds, in 
descending order by semitones, from that in the closed position. From this the various 
sounds on each of the positions of the several trombones may readily be obtained, and 
tables of fingering constructed. (See ‘* Positions of Slide Trombones.”’) 
THE TEACHER. 
183. The teacher of band, or orchestra, must necessarily be equipped with a good 
musical education. He must be fertile in resource, apt in présenting the same idea in 
different manners, painstaking, patient, persevering and zealous, If he be this, his 
methods will be pleasurable to those whom he teaches, and assure success, But not 
all who have entered the profession as teachers are blessed with a combination of the 
above estimable and desirable qualities. Some have the necessary education, but not 
the patience; others the zeal, but not sufficient knowledge; and again, others who, 
Having zeal and education, lack in the power of persistent effort. Taken all round, I 
believe the man of fair technical knowledge, with the facuity for teaching, who plods 
along and slowly, it may be, but surely, with dogged perseverance, surmounts each 
difficulty, is the better man to engage as a teacher, than the brilliant instrumentalist, 
who is usually too impatient and nervous to stoop te what may be considered the 
drudgery of teaching. It is the fashion with some bands to engage a leader for his 
_ abilities as a soloist, This is all right, if the man selected be known also as a good 
teacher, but, in the majority of cases, he is not. A band in the hands of such a man, 
usually bears the relation of the average ‘‘supe” to the “star,”? and there it continues. 
The brilliaucy of the leader, instead of inciting a spirit of emulation, in many cases 
breeds an inertness that is positively dangerous to the existence of the band. The 
leader absorbs all the solos, plays the difficult parts for alto, tenor or bass, on his own 
instrument, leaving the members of the band to supply only the commonest form of 
accompaniment, I remember hearing a band, some years ago, wiu such a teacher, 
attempting to play Rossini’s Overture, ‘The Italians in Algiers.’’ ‘The teacher (?), or 
Jeader, played E flat clarionet, and, from the opening to the final chord, never tor 
a moment left off playing. Oboe solo, cornet solo, bass,solo, there were none, The 
whole effort of Rossini’s genius was travestied, and became a solo for the E fiat clarioe 
net. The performance was ruinous and ridiculous, but a fact bearing testimony to the 
absurdity of placing the fate of the band in the hands of a man of this type. This 
eourse, giving rise to the feeling that ‘it does not matter; the leader will Play it,”” 
undermines that feeling of self-reliance which exists where the members of a band 
properly trained are made to place full dependence on themselves. If bands 
must have ready-made soloists, it is better to engage tnem as such; but never 
ebanla they dispense with the services of the practical teacher. He may not
-P-A-G-E-36
82 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
be a virtuoso on this instrument or that; but if he can teach, and develop to the 
fullest the capacity of each, his pupils will be interested and advance in musical knowl- 
edge. Such a teacher is worth more to the organization than the soloist who, however 
hard he may work helping out, still leaves the band at the close of his engagement no 
further advanced than when he assumed charge. The good teacher will instruct 
systematically in all that is necessary to the purpose in nand and endeavor by all 
possible means to cultivate the musical ability of each bandsman to the highest state of 
efficiency. Having done this he may look on the result of his labors with complacency 
and take pleasure in watching the growing proficiency of his band, individualiy. and 
collectively. On the other hand, bandsmen under such ateacher will feel with pride 
that they are on the right road, and, as in performance they are thrown upon their own 
resources, will grow stronger and more capable from day to day. Thus encouraged by 
good instruction and the pleasure of overcoming difficulties they will at length realize 
for themszlves the advantages arising from the engagement of a practical and painstak- 
ing teacher, in preference to the man whose sole ability is to play his instrument. 
THE LEADER. 
184, Theleaderin an orchestra is always the leading or solo violinist, while in a milie 
tary band the solo clarinetist or cornetist is usually the leader. He should be aman of su- 
perior ability as a performer upon his instrument, having a clear and decided tone, play- 
ing with a vigor and enthusiasm and with such confidence that all around will unhesitate 
ingly yield to his lead. He should be a perfect master in the technique, understanding 
thoroughly the art of bowing, phrasing, articulation, playing at sight, besides possess- 
ing the faculty of rendering what he plays in perfect style and with good expression, 
dynamical as well as artistic. 
As he is the right hand man, so to speak, of the conductor, he should be next to 
that officer in ability, and competent to assume the directorship on an emergency. It 
is not necessary that the leader be a thoroughly grounded harmonist, or that he under- 
stand the subjects of form, composition and instrumentation, but, of course, such 
acquirements would be of great value to him. It should be one of his great objects: to 
place himseif in sympathy with the conductor—in fact, he should be the transmitter to 
the orchestra or band, as it were, of the electric current emanating from his superior, 
THE BANDMASTER. 
135. The Bandmaster should be a man of the highest ability in his particular branch 
of the profession, Besides having great tact and discretion, it is expected of him to be 
conversant with all pertaining to the theoretical side of the art, such a< harmony, 
counterpoint, ete., composition, forms, instiumentation and the art of con- 
ducting; in fact, be so well posted that he would be able to answer almost any ques- 
tion, make corrections iu, or additions to a score, or be ready and capable of composing 
and arranging, to suit the needs of any special requirements. 
In addition, his knowledge of the various instruments in the organization under his 
contro], should ba such that he will be able to teach them to pupils, explain the theories 
connected with them, and in intricate passaes find a method of simplifying them, by 
his knowledge of exceptional fingerings, The above may be viewed as the mechanical 
side of a Bandmaster’s acquirements, all of which, unless coupled with an artistic tem- 
perament, will be comparatively unavailing in making & man a complte success, 
Much may be gained by cultivation, but not all. There isa height above which 
cultivatioa cannot rise, and beyond that dividing line lie those attributes which make
-P-A-G-E-37
RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 33 
the artist, the genius, The old saying, “poeta nascitur, non fit,” is here in every way 
applicable, and, unless the qualities be born in him, no amount of cultivation can supply 
them. 
‘fhe Bandmaster should have the faculty of placing himself in sympathy with the 
composer, and with ready perception, see behind the notes, the author’s meaning, 
imparting the same to the members of his band, more by the impulse of his own feelings 
than by explanation. His style, which should be refined, onght to pervade every. 
where, and the evidence of his enthusiasm be apparent on every hand. Without these 
qualities a Bandmaster cannot expect to command the respect of hismen. Knowledge 
is power. It is, therefore, incumbent on him to possess knuwledge, as it is by that 
alone he may hope to hold dominion. 
His manners ought to be gentlemanly and courteous at all times, the poorest 
performer in his band being treated with as great consideration as the soloist. It takes 
many bricks to build a house, some occupy less important places than others, but all 
are necessary to the solidity of the structure. Then, again, the Bandmaster coming 
constantly in contact with the public, has to take their opinions, likes and dislikes, 
into his consideration, and while endeavoring to his utmost to advance the cause af the 
higher class of music, should bend with wisdom to their‘tastes. 
CHARACTER OF INSTRUMENTS. 
THE PICCOLO. 
186, Tae Prccoxo, used in our bands, is said to stand in the key of Eb, whereas it 
really is pitched in Db. Its lowest nominal sound, D, giving an actual Eb, concert 
pitch, occasioned the error in naming. From this it is plain that between the standard 
C, and the pitch of the so-called Eb piccolo, there is a difference of only one semitone; 
Hence, the instrument must really be voiced in D. This naming the piccolo has 
occasioned much misconception. 
The piccolo has a shrill, penetrative tone, moderately flexible, and always of a 
bright and joyous nature. 1t is better adapted for the brilliancy of the Scherzo than 
the slower measure of the Andante, yet withal, for reinforcing the leading instruments 
in movements of « broad character its voice is of great service. The compass of the 
piccolo is about two and one-half octaves, or, as written, from 4tog. It must be 
observed, the sound is an octave higher than the written notes. 
The piccolo is well adapted to either legato, staccato or reiterated staccato passages 
in connected following, or broken arpeggio, and is more felicitious in the capability to 
skip from one interval to another than any other band instrument. In the hands of a 
good performer it may be made extremely effective; but in indifferent hands is 
treacherous and revengeful, displaying s tendency to fly off at s tangent from the true 
pitch, that is particularly distressing to the sensitive ears and harrowing to the soul of 
_ &band leader. The piccolo requires considerable “ humoring,” and should therefore 
be placed only where it will he sure of good treatment. 
. THE OLARIONET. 
137. Tae cLartoner bears the same relation to the reed band that the violin does to 
the orchestra, Tt has extensive compass, flexibility and variety of tone, and lends itself 
very readily to brilliancy of execution. The compass extends from e to &, o: even ¢, in 
written notation, or in other words nearly four octaves, and is divided into four regis: 
ters, viz: the chalumeau, from e to f; the intermediate, or throat, from & to bb; the 
elarion, trom » to $, and the altissimo, or high, from ¢ sharp upwards. It is well adapted
-P-A-G-E-38
84 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC.: 
to the legato, and moderatély only to staccato style of execution. Scale passages, chords: 
and intervals are all available. The low sounds of the chalumeau in arpeggio, or othere* 
wise, may be used with excellent effect for accompaniment, The throat register is the 
weakest part of the tone of a clarionet, and, unless care be exercised, will be found gen~ 
erally too sharp in pitch. The clarion register is the clearest aud most beautiful part of : 
the ingtrument and very suitable for movements of either a sympathetic or moderately 
brilliant nature, The Aigh register is brilliant and forcible, and in its upper part must 
be used with great caution, otherwise deviation from correct pitch may be expected. 
The clarionets in Hib and Bb are those most generally used in bands; but no so» 
ealled reed band should be without those supplementary members of the family, i. e., 
alto and bass clarionets. It is quite as essential that the quartet of clarionets be come 
plete in the band, as it is considered desirable that the quartet of strings shall form the 
basis of an orchestra. 
Rewarks.—Other reed, ete., instruments, each as oboe, bassoon, saxophone, eto., 
used in large bands and orchestras, are here omitted mention as not used in ordinary 
bands. 
THE CORNET. 
488. Tan Cornet is the most important instrument in the brass band. It has a 
playing compass of about two and one-fourth octaves, or from f sharp to ¢, the 
lower part of which is apt to be coarse, the medium, from © to & good, and the 
upper from g to ¢, more or less strident and difficult to obtain. Though great 
strides have.been made in the direction of securing perfect intonation throughout. - 
the compass of the cornet, and incidentally, all other valve instruments, it yet 
remains true that none made up to the present time are absolutely correct.in this 
respect.. There are certain physical difficulties impossible to overcome, and that 
must exist until brass instruments are equipped with at least six valves. Apart 
from the truth: that certain sounds on the primary series of tubes, though correct 
according to the ‘“‘true scale,” are incorrect with the “scale of equal temperament,’”* 
stands the fact that the sounds produced on the combination series are, and must 
remain, more: or less defective. This. is the more noticeable in combination of the 
longer. tubes; as.1-aud 8. ‘Makers may. modify, but cannot eradicate. that which 
exists in accordance with the laws of nature. If they remove the evil from one point it 
appears. with more emphasis in some other.* It is, therefore, clear that the skill of 
the mechanic must be, supplemented by the ability of the musician, and it remains with 
the latter to overcome the imperfections natural to his instrument, by careful study 
and what is known as.“humoring.’* 
The Kb cornet has a brilliant, but less sympathetic tone than that in Bo, and is. 
adapted to playing parts beyond the range of the latter. Oa account of the smallness - 
of its bore and length of tubing, it isa somewhat distressing instrument to play contine 
uously; therefore, parts written for it are usually largely interspersed. with rests, 
The Bb cornet is the natural leading and solo instrument of the brass band, Its. 
tone, in the medium register, is round, sympathetic and brilliant, and well calculated 
for effective performance. ‘Though Bb cornets are used as 1st, 3d and 84d, it would be 
advisable to use them only for ist and 2d, and, instead of a third cornet, use the fingei © 
horn, the mézzo-soprano quality of tone of same being much better adapted for the pute 
pose of accompaniment than the “‘reedy’’ low tones of the 8d cornet. 
  ~" «Gee Tum Marnonous for December, 1886, im which this subject is weated of ander heading of 
“A Now: Fangléd dea.” «
-P-A-G-E-39
RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 35 
Scale passages and groups of notes may easily be played legato on the cornet, but 
legato chords and intervals are more difficult, though not insurmountably so. The 
chief forte of the cornet is the staccato, in single, double triple, or what is: known as 
flat: tongueing. The methods of the first three named are familiar to all, the latter: 
being more uncommon is less so. It may, therefore, not be out of place to say that it 
is effected by depressing the point of the tongue and causing the air, on its way to the 
instrument, to vibrate by a rapid pulsation of the back part of the tongue, 
The valves on all brass instruments should be forced down quite straight, and by 
the first joint (not the second) of the fingers. 
THE ALTO. 
189. THE aLto supplies the harmony in the band, and occupies a position somewhat: 
analogous to the French-horn in-orchestra. In tone it should bear the same relation to 
the Bb cornet as does the contralto voice to the soprano. It should have sweetness and 
volume, sympathy and flexibility of tone. The effort to lift it out of its legitimate 
sphere should be discouraged, as it is not adapted to the brilliant work of the cornet. 
In other respects much that has been said of the cornet applies here. The alto is 
usually written for in four parts, as solo, Ist, 2d, and 3d. The object being to 
sustain the current of harmony ‘‘ pure and undefiled,” the greatest attention should. 
be paid to secure accurate intonation and homogeneity of tone. - 
Altos are made in F and Eb, with slides to place them in other keys down to C.. 
In consequence, arrangers of band music may avail theniselves in their works of the 
greater purity that the open, or normal sounds afford. All bands should be supplied 
with these slides. 
TENOR TROMBONE, 
140. Tue rENor TRoMBONE. — This instrument is popularly known as the “ Tenor,” 
and much misapprehension appears to exist as to the correct character of itstone. It is 
the tenor of the trumpet family and derives its name from tromba, the Italian word for 
trumpet. It should, therefore, have a clear, ringing, sonorous, brilliant-tone, from 
which all harshness is eliminated, and not that hybrid quality which is neither baritone 
nor trombone. * 
The trumpet family consists of a complete quartet as follows: Soprano trumpet 
(in almost any key) Eb alto trombone, Bb tenor trombone, and G, F, or Eb bass trom- 
bone, It is to be regretted that this family is not used complete in our bands, since it 
imparts a richness and variety of tonal color, now deficient. 
Trombones are either stipe or vALvs, the former is the more perfect, but at the 
same time the more difficult to play well. The valve trombone can execute with ease 
many passages in legato that are extremely difficult or impossible upon the “slide,” 
but its tone is not so free and is sacrificed more or less to the facilities its valves offer. 
However, the trombone is not adapted to rapid execution, and though the staccato is 
within its legitimate sphere, it is certainly no more fitted for triple tongue effects than 
is a rhinoceros to dance a polka. Both appear sadly out of place, 
THE BARITONE. 
141. Tur Baritone (or euphonion).— This instrument is the baritone voice ‘of the 
band and must possess a rich, full sympathetic tone. It is a noble instrument and in 
possession of a good performer may be made wonderfully effective. Though at many 
times it is used to double the bass parts or supply a lighter one than the ordinary bass 
affords, it is particularly happy as a solo instrument in movements of a broad, or even
-P-A-G-E-40
86 RUDIMENTS OF MUSIC. 
tender character. It has equal range of possibilities with the baritone voice and should 
never exceed it. The staccato and brilliant execution of the cornet are unsuited to the 
baritone, as much so are the light, graceful and sparkling performances of the vocal 
soprano. There is a world of beautiful musie for this instrument that will make the 
fame of any man who will master it, without stepping aside to traverse forbidden 
ground. 
THE BASS. 
142. THe Bass.—Bass instruments are of two kinds, viz., the Eb Bass, or tuba, and 
the BBb Bass. The former possesses the lighter quality of tone and is the better 
adapted to what may be consid+red the ordinary purposes of the band. It supplies a 
good bass of « light quality and is more agile than its neighbor, but cannot fairly be 
considered the foundation of the harmony of a band. The BBb Bass, with its pon- 
derous, rolling tone, is necessary in all bands. It imparts a sense of solidity and finish - 
that no other bass instruments can give and for this reason, where only two basses are 
used, one should be the tuba, the other the BBb bass. 
Remarxs,—In England, what is here known as the baritone, is there termed the 
euphonium. The baritone of that country is an alto horn in Bb and a very useful 
instrament for solos of medium lightness, 
No account has been taken of French Horns, as, though beautifal instruments 
and desirable in professional bands, they are dangerous in amateur organizations, 
RHYTHMICAL INSTRUMENTS. 
148. Devums.—Drums are technically known as instruments of percussion and are of 
three kinds, snare, or side drums, bass drums and kettle drums, or tympanies. The 
two former are used in bands, 
The size of drums, and in side drums the number of snares, has much to do with 
the quality of tone. A 16-inch side drum with 6 to 10 snares, or from 82 to 86-inch 
bass drum are the most desirable. Where two side drums are used, it would be 
advisable to have one of the ordinary shallow pattern and the other of deeper build, 
thus forming a soprano and tenor. Flams, paradiddes and rolls are the characteristics 
of the snare drums, while the simple reinforcement of the primary accents, with an 
occasional roll, is the office of the bass drum, The stroke on the bass drum should be 
oblique, or slanting, and every effort taken to cover the sound of the blow. 
Cympats ano TaiaNeins.—These instruments should be used sparingly and only 
for occasional effects, as their constant employment becomes tedious and positively 
objectionable. The genuine Turkish cymbals of from 19 to 15 inches diameter are the 
most desirable, They should not be beaten squarely together, but with sliding up and 
down stroke. Steel triangles, with 8 to 10 inch sides and pitched about Bb, are the 
best for band purposes. 
Devmmer’s Trars.—Under the heading of ‘‘drummer’s traps’ are arrayed all 
those instruments used for occasional effects, as bells, xylophone, bird whistle, cuckoo, 
pop gun, whip and numerous other and similarly musical, or unmusical sources of 
sound. These instruments, like condiments on the table, are very useful to give 
piquancy and zest to an entertainment, but pall rapidly on the taste if used too freely.

for each eighth note. 
TRIPLE TIME, (simple or compound). ?, 
Three beats, as in 3 32 & % are made by three movements of the E

nine in the measure, 1, 2,8, to the left; 4, 5, 6, tothe right, and 7, 8, 9,

COMPOUND DUPLE TIME, 
In slow movements of compound duple time, with siz beats 
to the measure, there are six movements of the baton, thus:—

and imparting to the movements of the baton as much grace as compatible with 
the above requirements, .

  N.B. When a note changes its staff position, but retains its pitch, such 
change is said to be ENHARMONIC. The small black notes are the enharmonic 
changes of the whole note, and are in sound and fingering identical therewith. 
  The sounds are so much out of tune as to be useless. 
  i ow 
Lately, Messrs. F, Besson and Co., London, Eng., have introduced a eupho- 
nion with 5 valves. With this instrument it is possible to obtain each note, in 
the lower register especially, most accurately in tune. The 5th valve simpli- 
‘ fies the fingering of many awkward passages, and may be used as a transposing 
valve to throw the instrument in another key. Mr. Carl Fischer, 6, 4th Avenue, 
New York, who is sole agent for these instruments for the United States, pre- 
‘gents each purchaser of a 5 valve euphonion with complete scale and instruc- 
tions for same.

BAND INSTRUCTOR, 
CONDENSED SCORE, WITH HINTS TO TEACHERS, 
BY 
ARTHUR A. CLAPPE. 
PART II.   
1 . EXERCISE ON THE WHOLE NOTE. 
The object of this lesson is to teach (1) the relative value of the whole note; 
2) fingering; (3) the art of sustaining sounds with equal power. The teacher 
has therefore the opportunity to speak on attack, breathing, position of the 
mouth-piece on the lips, the importance of cultivating tone, and other such 
points as may occur to him. The exercise should be played at first very slowly, 
and in strict time; afterward the speed may be increased. Explain the key 
signature, clef, time mark, bar lines, etc., at the outset. Caution against over- 
blowing. See J 114, 115, and 116, which should be read to the band.

3 EXERCISE ON THE QUARTER NOTE; 
ALSO ON THE COMMON CHORD, OR CHORD OF THE TONIC. 
Explain the relative value of quarter note ; also that the common chord in 
each key consists of numbers 1, 8, 5 and 8 extracted from the scale. Be careful 
that each performer gives value of one beat, no more nor less, to each quarter 
note. Point out to altos the possibility of playing all notes of this chord with 
ist and 3rd valves down, excepting the lower B, which must be taken in the: 
usual manner, i.e.: 2mo. valve.

Drill the band to breathe at proper points ; by so doing the playing will become 
clear and intelligible. Explain the ‘‘repeat.” See 7 104. Have the parts 
played first independently, then together.

13 EXERCISE ON THE EIGHTH NOTE. (weet 23) 
This exercise presents the opportunity to introduce the staccato (see J 87), 
articulation, and correct any tendency to drawl. It will be well to caution the 
pupils against forming the habit of dwelling upon or accenting the last note in 
the measure; as such, if allowed to grow unchecked, is difficult to eradicate 
later. The habit is a common one, especially in accompanying instruments, 
and always denotes carelessness or bad schooling. It destroys the rhythm by 
weakening the force of the correct accent. Explain the method of counting as 
one and two, etc.

Divide the measure into 8 parts, and show the 16th notes to fall on the 4 
and 8. To do this, sing a measure, or so, while making eight taps with the baton 
on stand or table; the position of 16th notes will then become apparent.

This exercise must be practiced with great diligence, with a view to have 
the entries accurately made. It is always a difficult matter to get several per- 
formers to take up a point at the same moment after silences; but persever- 
ance will crown the effort with success. ‘Call John”—which is a humorous 
part song — affords an excellent opportunity for disciplining the band in this 
direction. Dilate on marks of expression and general character of the piece.

Show, by example, that this order of time may be beaten or counted for slow tempo I, 2, 3—4, 5, 6, that is, one beat for each 8th note, and that it may also, at quicker speed, be beaten or counted as 1-2, or one beat for each three 
8th notes. For these reasons g time is classified as compound duple. 
Explain the change of key signature, referring to 77 46—49. Remark for 
Bb instruments in this key, it will be advisable to draw the 8rd valve slide some-

Take the opportunity to point out the contrasting effect of flats and sharps, 
and show that while the order of succession of flat keys may be discovered by 
counting a fourth upward, from C to F, F to By and so on; the order of sharp 
keys is established by counting a fifth upward from C. Thus C to G, and G to D 
etc: etc: There will possibly be a tendency in cornets, trombones, and bari- 
tones (especially the former), to sharpen on the three highest sounds, resulting 
from too much effort. Caution against it.

PART III. 
ONE HUNDRED SCALES, CHORDS, AND EXERCISES 
ARRANGED FOR FULL BAND. : 
The careful, persistent study of scales, chords and exercises thereon, is of 
all things the most essential to genuine progress and ultimate mastery of the 
technical. difficulties upon any (especially a wind) instrument. From such a 
study springs, (1), digital facility, (2), command of the embouchure, (3), con- 
trol and development of lung power, (4), cultivation of a perception for tune, 
and, (5), formation of a beautiful tone. These objects are most desirable pos- 
sessions and worth striving hard to obtain, and will inevitably result from judi- 
cious and systematic endeavor. To attain the greatest.possible benefit from 
such studies, the various scales and exercises should be practiced slowly, 
evenly, and strictly in tune and time, increasing in speed only after having 
gained full command over the slower tempi. Further, they should be prac- 
ticed in all degrees of dynamic shading, commencing with medium force, and 
working gradually in the opposite direction, that is, toward the faintest pianis- 
simo, and also the loudest fortissimo, as mf, mp, p, pp, ppp, on the other side 
mf, f, ff, and fff. When command over these has been attained, attention 
should next be turned to the development of the crescendo and diminuendo, — = SL - =, and so on. In whatever manner these exercises 
be studied, the four essentials, TONE, TUNE, TIME, and EVENNESS, should ever 
be kept in mind. (Read TY 38 to 48; 58 to 66; 89 to 95, and 114 to 118.) 
A feature sadly neglected by bands and individuals, is the study of articu- 
lation, which, next to the foregoing, is of the highest importance. Imperfect 
articulation in music is quite as deserving of censure as is similar defectiveness 
in speech; and no man can be considered a master of his instrument, or a band- 
leader to have done his duty,if evidence of such be allowed to mar a musical 
erformance. This branch of the subject demands the greatest attention in 
letail, and the diligent student, or leader, will not ignore it because of its 
tediousness. To show what is required in this direction, and also what is pos- 
sible, I here give twenty-one different methods of articulation of the same sub- 
ject; others may still be added. (Read {IJ 85 to 88.) 
TWENTY-ONE STYLES OF ARTICULATION ADMITTING OF EASY 
EXPLANATION BY THE LEADER.

  The key relationship should be clearly explained, as also, the nature ofthe 
various chords; such as Tonic, Dominant (major and minor 5, and Diminished 
Sevenths. In fact no effort should be spared, explaining and catechising, to 
make the subject of scales and chords clearly understood by each member of 
the band. Twenty minutes study of scales and exercises and ten minutes cate- chising at each rehearsal will produce highly beneficial results, not only in the oung band, but also in those more matured. Home or private study should be counselled, and the benefits arising therefrom expatiated upon. The study of scales, as before indicated, should never be discontinued. It is the drill that induces discipline, and no intelligent leader will ever forego that which helps to give him firmer musical command over his bandsmen. 
The scales and exercising here following are for Bb cornet, but so arranged that all instruments of the band may play together. They may be alternat with the studies in Part II. .

AN ESSAY ON EXPRESSION IN MUSIC. 
Br ARTHUR A. CLAPPE. 
{Reprinted from The Metronome of 1886.} \ 
Expression in music may be briefly defined as the art of rendering a composition 
in an intelligent and artistic manner. When the performer displays an understanding 
of 1ts mechanical formation, such rendering is INTELLIGENT; but when in conjunction 
therewith he develops the hidden meaning, imbuing the composition with an ideal life, 
the performance becomes axtistic. . 
A high state of cultivation of mechanical expression, coupled to refinement of 
taste, will in some measure simulate the higher attribute; but such can never rise to 
the altitude of that God-given quality which intuitively recognizes and vivifies that 
warm, rich beauty lying dormant beneath the cold, black notes and conventional signs 
of a composition, awaiting the call of the artist, But the possession of this artistic 
power does not relieve the possessor of the necessity of submitting to the restraint of 
eertain musical laws, neither can he afford to ignore their teachings. To acquire an 
art, the science must be learned; while in order to learn the science, its principles 
must be deduced from existing facts. Artistic expression run wild is like a neglected 
garden, wherein are mary beautiful flowers intertwined with much that is valueless, 
The beauty of the one is almost obscured by the growth of the other—chaos in pro- 
fusion, Under the hand of the careful gardener the useless plants are uprooted, the 
struggling and weakly branches pruned, that which is valuable trained, order reigns, 
and what was before'a tangled, incoherent mass, now becomes a pleasure to the eye, 
So, while the faculty of artistic expression cannot be created, it may, when existing, 
be cultivated and brought to a higher state of perfection by judicious care and study, 
This subject of expression covers a very extended ground in music, and no man 
@an be said to be master of it, from the mechanical aspect alon., who has not some 
knowledge of theory, as applying to scales in various forms, harmony, cadences and 
melody; to dynamics in relation to the usual degrees of soft and loud, nuances, 
emphasis, accents and tempi; also to form, in the construction of compositions, with 
the power to analyze. 
While for ordinary band and orchestra musicians the knowledge of harmony may 
tot be absolutely essential to the mastery of his special instrument, it will be found 
extremely useful; broadening the views with respect to musical theory and begetting # 
eonfidence in reading which nothing else can so well give. If harmony, with its 
ehords, progressions, cadences, inversions and suspensions may be dismissed as belong- 
ing to the art of composition, the same liberty cannot be taken with the seales, 
melody and its component parts, such as motive, section, phrase, sentence and all that

is involved therein, These must be acquired by him who. aspires to intelligently, or 
eorrectly express even the most trivial melody. 
Let us, however, for a brief moment look into some of the requisites of musica] 
expression, and endeavor to glean some idea of the subject in all its bearings. 
The scale is the foundation of all music. There are two forms, diatonic and 
chromatic, which are again subdivided into major and minor, The wide difference in 
the characteristics of these we shall not dwell upon, as they are at once apparent to all 
on first hearing; but as the internal relation of the seven primary sounds of the scale 
has some influence on the subject in hand, it must be glanced at. Each. scale has 
a basis, or keynote, from which all other tones depart and to which they return; this 
keynote is termed the tonic. The tonic ig the pivot round which all other tones 
revolve; its first chief aid is the dominant, or fifth degree of the scale, while second to 
the latter in importance is the fourth degree, or sub-dominant. These three sounds 
will describe the tonality of any scale; they are the powers which bind and make it a 
unit. While the tonic is the attracting magnet of the seven integral parts, the sub. 
dominant and d»minant lend their aid and make deflection impossible. 
There are in all twenty-four diatonic scales, each of which is said to have a special 
characteristic. Some are thought to be of a pleading nature, others again pathetic, 
impetuous, noble or grand, each one expressing some particular phase of the emotions, 
However much of sentiment there may be in this, it is certain that, owing to our scale 
ot equal temperament, some are sweet and subdued; others, again, are haish and 
pronounced, features in themselves lending an aid to the power of expression. When 
to the melodic progression of the scale intervals are added the natural harmonies, the 
foregoing effects are amplified. The attraction of the tonic is felt, the power of the 
sub-lominant and dominant is recognized, and the inherent sweetness of nature's 
own succession of chords becomes at once manifest. But it is sweetness alone; there is 
no contrast. The continuous symmetry of a line of buildings becomes monotonous; 
80 would a sea in which the color was perpetually green, or a sky of unvarying blue. 
It is the change, the constant change, which makes these natural objects so interest- 
ing, so charming, so seductive to the feelings of mankind. In music the eternal use 
of the three foregoing chords, in similar progression or varying only by interchange, 
would eventually become wearisome; we should sigh and long for the expression of 
contrast. Happily, the science of harmony affords ample material to satisfy the 
demands of even the most capricious, Its wealth of contrast is unequaled by any 
other art; the grave, the cheerful, the languishing, the exhilarating, the lowly, the sub- 
missive, the atrogant—all, all can be expressed by the power of harmony at the hands 
of the artist. The emotions may be stirred to their profoundest depths by harmonic 
coloring, aided by the subtle nuance, the delicate emphasis, the forcible accent of the 
performer, as in its changeful character the sound with a soul breathes through his 
cornet, or is drawn from his violin by the eloquent bow. 
But, so far, we have viewed only the scale, melodic in its succession of tones, yet 
devoid of rhythmical life and impulse, while still lying beyond, are many details 
necessary to be considered in connection with this subject. 
Metrical accent is instinctive with man; but only in its elementary forms and 
where the flow of melody is regular or periodic, as in the simple march, waltz, or 
hymn tune. To understand and appreciate the multitudinous designs of elaborated 
rhythm, requires study, education, and it is only by such a course that the art of 
phrasing, or the proper grouping of sounds and figures can be acquired. To play 
with clearness, and express a melody mechanically correct, requires as much care and 
attention to its component parts as does the lucid utterance of a sentence by
-P-A-G-E-100

speaker, The morive or pattern so to speak, the PHRASE, SENTENCE, and finally the 
SUBJECT must all be recognig-d and given that promin-nce, or pronuuciation which 
may be demanded by their nature to give them due force, 
The first principle in such an effort is accent. 
Let us see! 
Supposing, for instance, a cornetist were to play, say, a dozen hal? notes on his 
instrument at the same pitch, holding each two beats duration, laying equal stress on 
each note, the effect on the ear would be analagous with that produced on the eye by 
a straight line. Now let him emphasize the first and each alternate note, then again, 
the first of each three notes. What is the result? He has changed the expression. 
The dead level of sound is broken by the intervention of stress or accent, and what 
formerly appeared a monotonous reiteration, becomes interesting and assumes a more 
lively expression. This periodic or regular flow of stress may be termed metrical 
accent, and is the foundation of those influences which under fuller development, as ip 
the higher rhythmic forms, imparts so much animation and meaning to music. 
The interposition of accent, as above, educes a new feature, quantity. Quantity, 
in music, is shown by the bar lines used to indicate the point of recurring strong 
accent. Now, although, in the former illustration, quantity was made manifest, a 
poverty of design was apparent, each measure was of uniform pattern, and which, 
though enlivened by the introduction of accent, would eventually become tiresome to 
the listener, or performer; but if the half notes be broken up into fractional parts, 
protracted to greater length, or rests be incorporated, always keeping in view the cor. 
rect quantity for each measure, the character is changed avd a new power of 
expression has been added to our example, the tedium has been relieved, and new life 
imparted thereto. 
The rhythmic patterns, or designs into which sounds are, or may be formed, are 
infinite. Music is a mosaic of sound, endless in its variation, in its choice designs and 
tone colors, but amenable tothe laws of symmetry and order. In each composition 
there must be one prevailing figure, woven throughout, stamping its identity, and 
giving coherence to the entire work. This figure is the motive, or theme; it may take 
but two notes to express; it may require more; it is the design for the whole melody. 
The two motives will form what is termed a section, two sections a phrase and two 
phrases a sentence, whila the whole is named the subject. Sometimes sections, phrases 
and sentences include a larger number of constituting elements; when such is the 
ase, they are said to be compound, but as a general rule the foregoing description will 
@ found a correct standard for analytical purposes. 
Before any work can be performed with truly satisfactory mechanical expression it 
ast be resolved into its elements; otherwise, faults of phrasing must inevitably creep 
13 particularly is this the case where a figure commences with initiatory, or starting 
otes. The study of this branch of the subject is especially valuable to players on 
wind instruments, as by it will be clearly shown where, or where not, to take breath 
and other particulars. 
The regular rise and fall of metrical accent, as has been seen, appeals only to 
the instinct, that is, to the common feeling in man for law and order. But after all, 
the view of a stretch of country, prairie-like in its evenness, although possessing an 
. Influence of repose, has not the charm for the eye of a rolling, undulating landscape, 
any more than the latter affects our feelings like, or is comparable with, the boldness 
and grandeur of mountain scenery. It is not the unbroken symmetry of a line of hills 
or mountains that calls forth our admiration so much as those which, standing out in 
wold relief and apparently in defiance of the order of their surroundings, break the
-P-A-G-E-101
APPENDIA. 97 
monotony of the view and forcibly arrest our attention. Here the expression of contrast 
delights us; this feature, or that, viewed separately, may not possess any special 
ciaims to beauty; but even their ruggedness, their disproportion as isolated features, 
are, when viewed in conjunction with the many other details of the landscape, so toned 
and mellowed as to create within us the feeling that such is indispensable, and could 
not be removed without marring the effect with which the scene in its entirety over- 
powers us. Similarly in music, this chord or that may be discordant, harsh, strident, 
as a single circumstance ; or, again, a strong emphasis here, or a sudden nuance there, 
may appear for the moment to destroy the harmony and proportion of a melody, yet, 
when such are considered in connection with the entire composition, it will be at once 
perceived, it is to these very features the work owes its chief claim to expression 
to beauty of coloring, to force of character. 
Irregularities of chord progression and accent are then forces of expression. That 
there may be no doubt of this, examine the fifth and sixth measure of Mendeissohn’s 
‘Wedding March, which, in defiance of all law and precedent, he treats as follows: 
  Had Meidelssohn been more orthodox he would no doubt have written the above 
thus: - ae: a, 
ppt 
r Fe r 
rin some similar manner. But he felt he had something to express, and wrote as in 
the first example. Any person comparing the two will at once be struck by the oppo- 
site effects produced by the differing harmonic colorings, and at once perceive that to 
Mendelssobn’s original harmony is to be attributed the peculiar and striking expression 
of the measures quoted, rather than to the flow of the melody. 
The following, taken from Gounod’s ‘ Faust,” will give an example of irregular 
accent, where the laws of metrical accent have been violated : 
  Compare the above with the method of performance indicated by the law of metri+ 
‘eal accent, which demands that the first beat following the bar line shall be the most 
strongly accented. What is the result of conformity with the law? Loss of character, 
or expression, as will easily be seen by the subjoined : 
  p-5——— —— FS Ae et feta Pay FS ck. 4 te = > >= 
Gounod knew what he wanted to express, and wrote it; the end—good effect— 
Justifying his non-compliance with the elementary law of accent, Hence, it will be 
seen, from the two foregoing examples, that irregularities of coloring and accent sre 
‘express‘onal characteristics of great potency, relieving monotony and giving richness 
-and beanty to melodies otherwise of no special import. 
Having now briefly reviewed the expression of irregularity, we are better prepsred 
to understand what is termed RurvrawicaL Accent, a knowledge of which is indispen-

sable to the instrumentalist who would phrase correctly. Music wedded to words in 
such a manner that one is felt to be the complement of the other, presents very little 
difficulty in phrasing. Therefore, the vocalist has a great advantage over the instru- 
mentalist 3 for if he follow the punctuation, accentuation, and spirit of the verse, he 
woust, at least, approximate to correct phraseological delivery, however much the poetic 
quantities may demand a complexity of musical rhythms; but, where the words are 
disassociated from the music, the case becomes widely different, What was rendered 
elear by association with the words, now becomes ambiguous, and requires the utmost 
eare and attention from the performer to render intelligible. 
Rythmical accent, in the grouping of sounds into definite figures or patterns, 
appeals to the intelligence both for elucidation and appreciation. Music has its points 
of repose, as represented bythe , ; : . in prose, and it is as necessary to attend 
to them faithfully in one asin the other. In instrumental music such signs are not writ- 
ten—knowledge and feeling can alone indicate them ; therefore, how requisite is it to 
have a clear conception of melodic construction, in order to avoid errors in phzasing. 
One cannot listen to the bands of the country without at once feeling that this sub- 
ject is too often imperfectly misunderstood, not by amateurs alone, but by so-called 
professionals, from whom better things should be expected. It is true that composers 
and arrangers do not always write their music, with regard to the rhythmical divisions, 
as carefully as should be ; but this is no justification for bad phrasing on the part of 
the performer, It is his business to supply what negligence has omitted. 
Let us now take a few examples: * 
The rhythmical pattern here, commencing with the initial note, concludes on the 
second note of the second measure, marked *. It would manifestly be incorrect to 
break that design for the purpose of taking breath before the g had been played. Yet 
there is no mark to indicate otherwise, and in nine cases out of ten players would breath 
after the o, grouning the two g’s with the next rhythm, thus destroying the design 
The correct phrasing would be: 
Taetrnyinm. ‘| im. 4 ’ i Ast rhythm. 2d rhythm. t 
oS =e 
So oa eet te 
  Gere the rhythms are so uniform in pattern that a little care renders them clear, , 
The same may be said of the old French air following ; but where the slovenly writivg 
of the composer has destroyed their resemblance : 
  
  The rhythm here is surely 
wd ST 
but, if played according to the above s'urs, the perspicuity of the design is lost. The.
-P-A-G-E-103
APPENDIX. 19 
phrasing is correct as marked underneath, and breath should only be taken at the end 
of each rhythm. ; ; . 
. ‘The next, ‘Il mio tesora,” from Mosart’s “Don Juan,” is a familiar example of 
varying rhythms: 
    SS ee 
Rhythm. Rhythm. 
GaSe eee The breathing points are marked by the comma. Where rhythms correspond 
throughout, they are said to be regular, but where, as in the last quoted example, they 
vary, they are termed irregular. 
Rythmical accent, as will be observed from the foregoing, includes metrical. It 
may not be so apparent on the surface as the latter, yet where a melody is performed 
with due regard to rhythmic design a subtlety of nuance, a refinement of emphasis, 
inevitably becomes manifest, consequent upon the effort to articulate each phrase con 
rectly in accordance with the grammar of melodic construction, 
The following rules, by Mr, Lussy, may serve as a guide in discovering the 
rhythms in music: 
1, ‘* We must find out if the notes are arranged in groups of two and two, three 
and three, four and four bars on similar symmetrical: plan. Each group, distine 
guished by its difference from or resemblance to the preceding group, evidently forms a 
unit, a rhythm or a section, according to its length.” 
2. *‘ We must find out if in these groups of bars the same notes, or notes of the 
same length, are repeated and if they are terminated by a longer note or a rest.”” 
8. “* Above all, we must pay attention to the feeling of repose given to the ear by 
the last note of each group, and distinguish whether it is merely a pause, leaving a 
desire for something to follow or a definite and final close.” 
If the examples previously given be analyzed by the above rules, these latter will 
more easily become intelligible. 
Dynamie charactersand words ast =~ —< p, pp, ff, crescendo, diminuendo, 
ete., require investigation, in order to give that degree of force to a composition which 
their application would seem to demand. A melody may, on the whole, be of a soft or 
subdued nature, varied at times by orescende or diminuendo, p’s or f’e. Where such 
is the case, the greatest discernment is necessary, to ascertain to what extent these 
apply, whether to one or more rhythms. Such can only be decided by the context 
and by careful examination into the expression of sentiment. To continue a orcs ende 
or diminuendo beyond the limit of one rhythm into that following, unless the sense of 
the melody require it, would be to make a grave error, revenging itself by loss of that
-P-A-G-E-104
100 APPENDIX. 
forceful character on which every rhythm must depend, more or less, for its true 
expression. 
The art of phrasing correctly, implies attention to all the details of articulation, 
such as the legato, semi-legato, staccato, puntato, The exact method of applying them 
depends (1) on the nature of the work, (2) on individual taste. There is but little con- 
formity among musicians on these points, as the subject has never been reduced to set 
rules, yet, it will be well, in the absence of such, to remark that a legato passage should 
invariably be commenced with a decided accent, while its close should be correspond- 
ingly weak, and the last note made short, leaving an unmistakable rest between it and 
the note succeeding, This note applies to all legato passages, whether composed of 
two notes or a greater number. It is usual among good performers to emphasize the 
first of a legato group of notes, irrespective of its position with respect to metrical 
accent, 
  
  In such passages the accent is really transposed, the weak becoming the strong 
and vice versa. Syncopated passages are pérformed in 9 similar manner, 
Where the last note of a legato passage is followed by another of the same pitch, 
the former will be weak and short, presenting a good breathing place, and the latter an 
emphasized note. 
  
  A group of rapid legato notes ending on the point of metrical accent do not, asa 
general rule, rob that point of its proper accent, but, at the same time, such being the 
last of a slurred passage, is made shorter than its appearance would infer, 
SS =e 
Limitation of space forbids us treating this subject of phrasing at the length its 
fmportance deserves; but we think sufficient has been said to draw the attention of 
readers of Taz Metronome to the necessity for giving it their deepest study. 
‘Time is another element centering largely into the subject of musical expression. 
‘Time may be considered under the heads of (1) normal, (2) emotional; normal, as 
implied by the structural character of a melody; emotional, as dealing with those slight 
deviations from the normal tempo occasionally occurring either written or felt to be 
needed, in which. most good compositions abound. 
Italian terms, such as adagio, andante, allegro, presto, are most commonly applied 
to indicate the normal speed at which a piece of music should be played in order to 
show off its beauties to the best advantage. 
‘These terms are ambiguous, to say the least of them, and should be discarded for 
the more certain marking of metronomie figures. They are so uncertain in their appli- ‘Would be played:
-P-A-G-E-105
APPENDIX. 161 
cation, and convey so little of the composer’s idea of the rate of speed, as to give rise 
to the greatest difference of opinion between conductors, performers and annotators, 
Nor are they alone in their disagreement as to the true conception of these terms, as 
any one may see by examining the works of even the greatest writers and noting the 
divergence of their views of the same term. For instance, take the following from 
Handel’s ““Messiah:”’ ‘Comfort ye,’ and ‘‘The people that walked in darkness ””—both 
are in C time and the speed is indicated by the term Laryletto, yet the former is usually 
taken at about the rate of MM .) = 40; while the latter moves as about the rate of MM 
2 = 63, or twenty-three degrees to the minute quickert 
Beethoven’s Sonates display similar discrepancies. Take the Finale of the 5th 
Sonate, marked Prestissimo, C, usually played # = 108, and compare it with first 
movement of the 7th Sonate, Presto, ¢f, and which is generally performed at 27 182, 
Surely, this is an inversion of terms with a vengeance! 
Now, one instance of divergent opinions between conduetor and composer. De- 
Kontski has the third movement of his popular ‘‘ Reveil du Lion” marked “ Tempo 
Marcia.” Tempo Marcia may mean anything from 4, or J == 108, to 2-4 Jj =» 120, or 
% 2 = 56. Theodore Thomas interprets the Tempo di Marcé as meaning about J = 
182; while De Kontski himself, on being questioned with respect to his ideas of the 
tempo, states that ,! == 112 was what he had in view. 
Thousands of other examples might be given to prove the absurdity of employing 
the arbitrary Italian speed terms which custom alone sanctions, and common sense 
condemns. Composers, who still persist in using the ordinary words, should net come 
plain if the effect of their work is sacrificed by being performed at a tempo slower, or 
quicker than they conceived requisite. 
That musical expression depends much on the speed at which a piece is played, 
goes without saying. This can readily be tested by playing any genuine Scotch Strath 
spey, or Reel in slow time, when, it will be noticed, that what in one case was the very 
exemplification of jolity, provoking the feet to movement, becomes in the other 
pathetic, or as lugubrious as a funeral march. Yet, what are conductors to do, espect+ 
ally in new compositions, or in old, in absence of tradition or specific speed signatures? 
They can only rely on their own judgment or instinct. The structural elements of the 
work must be carefully investigated, note by note, passage by passage, rhythm by 
rhythm, and from these must be determined the tempo best adapted to bring out its true 
meaning. It is only by such consideration that the normal tempo ean be discovered, 
Compositions with great elaboration of rhythmical accent or harmonic coloring, just as 
surely indicate a slow tempo, as does the more regular rhythm and simpler harmony 
demand one relatively quicker. In polyphonic works full of contrapuntal, canonic and 
fagal devices, the time must not be too quick or the ear cannot follow, nor the mind 
grasp, the intricacies of this style of composition, if the parts follow too rapidly one on. 
the other. Fugue playing is the peuchant of many organists, and nearly all perform 
them too rapidly. What is the result? A chaos of sound, cacophony, where nothing 
but euphony should exist, metrical and rhythmical accent jumbled up in hopeless cone 
fasion, the meaning and expression ruined, Such is the result. 
With such an arraignment of charges against the Italian terms to denote speed, it 
must be self-evident that they are useless and should be abolished in favor of the met» 
ronome indications. The metronomic figures should be the only guide to decide the 
normal tempo, but, at the same time, those words relating to modification and style, as 
eantabile, callando, accellerando, stringendo, rallentando, perdendosi, ete., might still 
be retained to good advantage.
-P-A-G-E-106
102 APPENDI. 
The departure from normal time either indicated or imparted by the performer 
may be termed emotional time. Such a modification of tempo, when introduced at the 
right momeut, adds greatly to the effect of a work. In many instances the composer 
has given guides, but not in all. There are a thousand subtleties aud deviations the 
artist may feel, which the composer has not marked and could not if he tried, Here 
the emotions are called into active operation und the performer becomes the interepter 
of the meaning of a language but half expressed by the conventional signs in music. 
Now to close. Artistic expression is a subject upon which one may speculate, but 
fail to explain. The reason of that power which the artist may exert, through the 
medium of music, over the hearts and minds of others, cannot be analysed, cannot be 
dissected. It is a gift of God, one of His secrets, and defies human power of explana- 
tion. The artist feels and portrays his feelings; here the expression is morose, there 
joyful, here pathetic, there provoking to laughter, here pleading, there impassioned, 
here simpls, there rising to a pinnacle of sublimity and grandeur, which carries hia 
hearers along in spite of themselves, subservient to his genius. He cannot tell you why. 
Sufficient for him Ae feels it, you fee] it and both stand in reverent awe before a power 
which lifts the mortal out of himself for the time being into the regions of the immortal. 
Artistic expression, like the sun, has a life-giving power; where it penetrates it illumi- 
nates, and where its beams fall, there it reveals that which was hidden. 
Manuerism, while it must, as a necessity of individual personality, enter largely 
into expression, cannot be considered the sum total of artistic expression; on the con- 
trary it may descend to positive vulgarity, although coupled with the highest technica) 
abilities. Evidences of this are not wantiog, unfortunately for the amateur musicians 
of the land, Szelf-styled artists tour the country season after season whose exhibitions 
aud performances are a positive disgrace to the musical art. Truly, they astonish their 
audiences; but do they touch their sympathies? Do they appeal to the intelligence or 
tothe heart? They have excited wonderment, but not love. In the persons of such 
men the modest spirit of the true artist has no abode. The I am J protrudes at every 
pore, and music is subordinated to the end of glorifying the man at the expense of 
the art. 
If genius cannot be acquired, many of its traits may be copied. Listen to good 
artists, shun the pyrotechnical musical mouatebank; rather pay ten dollars to hear a 
simple ballad artistically readered, than ten cents to listen to stupid and meaningless 
show pieces of the vulgar virtuosi. The attempt to copy from good models must result 
in the improvement and cultivation of taste and refinement, but to imitate a poor exam- 
ple can only tend to drag one down to a low level of musical morals. Cultivation of 
the imagination, fostering the growth of musical perception, and devoting one’s self to, 
the development of an appreciation for the true and beautiful in art, should be the con. 
stant aim. Good music, old or new, and no other, should be constantly studied, with 
a view to draw forth its meaning, as well as to conquer its technical difficulties. Such 
& course must strengthen, must elevate, and while it cannot give the genius of artistic 
expression, it niust result in producing a degree of musical ability, delightful alike to 
the possessor and to those who may have the pleasure of listening to his efforts. 
The limits of an essay do not admit treating of musical expression as fully as it 
dese: ves and requires; but we think, those who have followed what is here written 
will, if not previously acquainted with the subject, learn much having a practical appli« 
eation to band and orchestra work. . 
If this small contribution shall succeed in inciting one mind to explore more fully 
this single path of the many which lead to the summit of musical excellence, the writer- 
will feel that bis effort has not been in vain,

L’'inpisPensaBLe — A Moprrn Scroou or Perrecrion ror Fiurs 
By Lzonarvo Dr Lorenzo 
This niodern flute method contains 101 extended examples covering every pos- sible branch of flute playing, and the author has spared neither time nor exertion in his compilation of this remarkable work. It has been his special endeavor to com- 
bine the useful with the agreeable, so far as possible, through the preparation of an 
entirely new series of scales, arpeggios, skips, trills, preludes, and three numbers in solo form without piano accompaniment entitled: (No. 97) “Studio Caratteristico,” (No. 98) ‘Lella;” idillio oceanico, (No. 99) “Tl Mulinello,” Capriceio. The com- 
pilation and presentation of the major and minor scales in particular has been done 
in an absolutely novel and original manner. Some of the numbers have been writ- 
ten with a special view towards allowing them to be practiced in several inversions.

‘An elementary method, by Edwin Franko Goldman. .Contains more solid advice 
about the cornet and how to play it than any other book published. 
It is a veritable encyclopsedia for the Cornetist. 
An elementary method for beginners, but even experienced players can derive 
much benefit from this book, as it contains information and advice that has never 
before been obtainable in book form. 
Most methods do not contain exercises that are sufficiently easy for beginners, 
and in many cases the exercises progress too rapidly. This work is entirely new, 
and will prove a blessing not only to the beginner, but to the teacher as well. The 
exercises have been so carefully graded that the student is bound to make rapid 
progress and can be certain that the foundation to his future playing is absolutely 
correct. The book contains nearly one hundred pages, and each exercise is thor- 
oughly explained as though the pupil were taking personal lessons from the author, 
making the work superior to any lessons by mail. There is nothing better for self- 
instruction.

THE TECHNIC OF THE BATON 
By Aupert StorsseL 
Instructor of conducting at the A. E. F. Bandmasters and Musicians 
School, Chaumont, France 
Whoever is called upon to conduct a body of musicians as an orchestra leader, 
bandmaster, or choirmaster, will welcome this book as a teacher and guide in the 
study of the sign language of the baton. It is most significant that the preface was 
written by Walter Damrosch, one of the most eminent of contemporary conductors. 
In quoting from his introductory words, the publishers find the best means to con- 
vey the importance of its contents. . : 
“With the baton and an infinite variety of movements of the hand, wrist and arm, 
the conductor indicates the-tempo and its changes, the dynamics, the expression, and in. 
fact all the inner spirit and the meaning of the music. His (Mr. Stoessel’s) book is 
admirably planned and executed. It is clear, practical and stimulating, and I hope 
it will be generally used throughout the country. 
The lack of routine and the ignorance of even the simplest rudiments of “beating time” 
is appalling among many of our conductors, organists and choirmasters. Mr. Stoessel’s 
book should be of great help to them.”

THE CARL FISCHER COMPLETE INSTRUMENT CHART 
Including a “Table of Keys” for Transposing Instruments and Other 
Indispensable Information for Bands and Orchestras 
Illustrating the Complete Range of Every Instrument and Showing the 
Corresponding Note on the Piano Keyboard, of all Transposing 
and Non-Transposing Instruments 
Price, $2.50 
This chart may justly be described as an encyclopedia of musical knowl- 
edge, containing complete, authoritative and practical information, not 
only for conductors of bands and orchestras, but for individual players as 
well, All instruments used at the present time, in either band or orchestra, 
are mentioned with complete information as to range and notation. The 
chart is so practically arranged as to offer instantaneous advice upon every 
possible or doubtful musical question. 
Among the principal features included will be found invaluable informa- 
tion regarding practical substitution of instruments, describing at the same 
time, and in concise manner, how various band instruments can be Lin 
the orchestra, and what parts they could play to best advantage and how 
same are to be transposed. Then there is a complete ‘‘Table of Keys for 
Transposing Instruments,” practical suggestions about “Pitch,” “the best 
books for band and orchestra players,” “practical and effective band com- 
binations of from eight to fifty players” (which combinations have been en- 
dorsed by the leading bandmasters in America), “average compass of male 
and female voices” and “correct valve combinations and slide divisions of 
the B flat trombone.” . 
The size of this chart is 54 by 45 inches; it is printed on linen with wood 
top and bottom hangers and is to bé hung on the wall like a map, making 
it an indispensable ornament and a constant source of information for every 
- band and orchestra room.

THE PRINCIPLES OF WIND-BAND TRANSCRIPTION 
By ARTHUR A. CLAPPE 
Captain U. S. Army and Director U. S. Army Music School 
In the author's own words, the reason for the publication of this book lies in the fact 
of the small number of similar works and the inadequacy of those which exist in treat- 
ing of transcription for the wind-band upon a plane of musical usefulness, higher than 
that implied by the rendering of a military march, dance tune, or an operatic selection. 
Herein the effort is made to exhibit its more varied possibilities and furnish grounds 
for the claim that, when seriously treated, the wind-band is entitled to be regarded as a 
potential factor in the musical arena.

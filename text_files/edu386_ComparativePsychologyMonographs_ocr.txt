  I. THE RELIABILITY OF THE INCLINED PLANE PROB- 
LEM BOX AS A METHOD OF MEASURING THE 
LEARNING ABILITY OF THE RAT 
WILLIAM T. HERON 
From the Psychology Laboratory of the University of Kansas 
INTRODUCTION 
The data presented in this paper were obtained in the psycho- 
logical laboratory of the University of Kansas during the school 
year 1920-1921. The work was suggested by and done under the 
direction of Professor Walter S. Hunter to whom the writer is 
grateful for advice and criticism. The author wishes also to 
acknowledge his obligation to the Research Committee of the 
Graduate School for their financial aid in the study of the 
problem. A similar study of the reliability of the maze has 
previously been made in this laboratory, initiated by D. G. 
Paterson and continued by Oakland Maupin, but is as yet 
unpublished. 
The problem which forms the basis for the following work is 
one which has received much attention from those who are 
dealing with tests applied to humans. In view of this fact, it is 
rather curious that none who have applied tests of various kinds 
to animals, have seen fit to inquire into the reliability of the 
tests used. Certainly, this question of reliability is one of 
extreme importance, if the results obtained in testing are to be 
considered valid sources from which to draw conclusions. 
The purpose of the present experiment, then, is to determine 
the degree of reliability of the problem box as a test of the learn- 
ing ability of the white rat. A comparison will also be made of 
maze and problem box learning, and other problems essential 
to the study of reliability will be discussed. 
The meaning of reliability may be illustrated by an example 
given by Spearman (1). He says:

Suppose three balls to be rolled along a well-kept lawn; then the 
various distances they go will be almost perfectly correlated to the 
various forces with which they are impelled. But let these balls be 
cast with the same inequalities of force down a rough mountain side; 
then the respective distances eventually attained will have but faint 
correspondence to the respective original momenta. 
  In the first case the distance the balls traveled would be a 
reliable test of the amount of force with which they are impelled 
because the chance factors influencing their progress along the 
lawn would not be sufficient to destroy the correspondence 
between the impelling force and the distance traveled. In 
the second case, however, these factors are so great that they 
destroy the correspondence and thus the distance traveled is 
rendered unreliable as a measure of the forces involved. 
The theoretical application of this illustration to the learning 
process in the problem box is plainly seen. The hypothetical 
capacity, called the learning ability of the rat, would correspond 
to the impelling force. The problem box is represented by the 
lawn or mountainside whichever the case may be. The measure 
which is used to indicate the animal’s progress in learning to 
operate the box is analogous to the distance traveled by the 
balls. In order to test the reliability of the problem box, there- 
fore, the following assumptions must be made: first, that the 
rat is a stable subject, i.e., reasonably free from erratic impulses 
and moods which would cause him to react differently to exactly 
the same situation; second, that his learning ability is a constant 
factor with no essential variations within the experimental 
period; third, that the solution of the problem box involves this 
constant factor to a degree not essentially obscured by other 
factors involved in problem box learning. : 
That these three are reasonable assumptions to make is indi- 
cated by the fact that they have not, up to the present time, been 
questioned by anyone who has used the apparatus and animals 
in question. The present experiment is particularly concerned 
with investigating the validity of the third assumption. The 
first two are assumed to be true although the effect which they 
would have, if untrue, upon the investigation will be discussed.

RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 3 
HISTORICAL SUMMARY 
The problem box, in one form or another, has been in use for 
years. Thus Watson (2) says: 
The problem box method in animal behavior in one form or another 
is as old as Civilization. It remained for Thorndike, in 1899, to perfect 
the method and to make it serviceable for bringing out certain facts 
connected especially with what one roughly calls learning in animals.   
The form of the box necessarily varies greatly because of the 
different animals used. It is obviously impossible for the rat to 
operate the same kind of a box suitable for the monkey, con- 
sequently, each experimenter has varied the boxes which he has 
used to suit his animal’s capabilities. 
The problem box has also been used in human testing. Healy’s 
(3)puzzle boxes are probably the ones in most common use. The 
lid of one of these boxes, taken as a sample, is fastened by a 
combination of strings and catches, and it can only be opened by 
following a definite sequence of five or six steps. The box is 
so constructed that the whole procedure to be learned can be 
studied by direct observation. Healy states the purpose of this 
test as follows: “It may bring out abilities or defects in manipu- 
lative powers, in the ability to analyze a slightly complicated 
physical situation, in powers of attention and continuity of 
effort.” 
The inclined plane box, used in this experiment, has been 
used in its simpler form, by Watson (4), Richardson (5), and 
Ulrich (6). In its improved form it was used by Basset (7) in his 
work on the effect of brain weight upon learning ability. Inas- 
much as it is the purpose of this experiment to investigate the 
apparatus rather than the problems of the above investigators, it 
is not necessary that their papers be reviewed. 
The reliability of the maze used in this experiment is the subject 
of an investigation by Miss Oakland Maupin. Her work was 
begun prior to this experiment in the same laboratory; and the 
approaches to the problem, made in the present study, are 
practically the same as those which she is using.

The methods which have been used by Spearman (8), Burt (9), 
Wyatt (10), Krueger (11), Simpson (12), and others in their 
investigations of the reliability of tests applied to humans are 
outlined by Whipple (13) as follows: 
Let A; = the first series of observations of the trait A. 
Az = the second series of observations of the trait A. 
If the outcome of the test is not disturbed by chance or by constant 
errors, the ranks of the several S’s should be the same at each trial. 
The constant errors must, of course, be avoided by other precautions. 
If, however, chance errors are too obtrusively present, this fact will 
be revealed by a low correlation between A; and Ag. In practise a test 
whose coefficient of reliability is less than 0.60 or 0.70 is in need of 
rectification. . . . . It should be understood that A; and Az need 
not be independent series of tests given by different H’s at different 
sittings, but may be made up from data obtained at a single sitting, 
though, as a rule, two sets of data are secured and the correlation is 
calculated between the first half of the first performance added to the 
last half of the second performance and the last half of the first perfor- 
mance added to the first half of the first performance. 
The point is that, in figuring the coefficient of reliability 
it is essential that the discrepancies between the two series of measure- 
ments of the same trait should really be of a ‘chance’ character. Sup- 
pose, for example, that A represents ‘memory for nonsense syllables’ 
and has been tested by requiring the subjects to memorize a dozen sets 
of syllables. It would be wrong, then, to constitute A, of the first six 
sets and A, of the second six sets, because the latter half-dozen would 
be affected by a constant factor—that of practice—to an extent dif- 
ferent from the first half-dozen. It would be better to constitute Ai 
from the odd- and A: from the even-numbered tests. 
The correlations obtained by either of these two methods are 
known as the coefficients of reliability of the tests to which the 
correlations apply. The first of the two methods, i.e., the 
correlation of the results of the test obtained at two separate 
sittings, is the one most generally used. There are difficulties, 
however, in applying it to tests given to humans. This is 
indicated by Burt (14), in speaking of the calculation of the co- 
efficient of reliability for the ‘dotting test’? which he gave to 
English school boys. In that paper, he says: 
 
-P-A-G-E-5
  RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 5 
It was not possible to obtain the preparatory boys at the laboratory 
(where this particular test was carried out) on more than one occasion, 
but that occasion was the same for every boy, viz., after morning school. 
Hence no reliability coefficient was obtainable for the Preparatory 
School, though the reliability was probably high. Each of the Elemen- 
tary children was able to come twice. The reliability coefficient for 
the two series thus obtained for them was 0.86. Part of the manipula- 
tion of the apparatus while the subject is actually at work devolves,— 
upon the superintendent of the experiment; so that the personal equa- 
tion is in this test likely to be appreciable, though perhaps small; 
accordingly, as the series were all superintended by the same operator, 
the reliability coefficient is probably slightly too high. 
For the sake of comparison a few of the reliability coefficients 
for tests applied to humans are enumerated in table 1.

APPARATUS AND GENERAL METHOD 
The problem box which was used in this experiment is similar 
to that employed by Basset and described by him in his paper 
on “Habit formation in a strain of white rats with less than 
normal brain weight.’”’ The measurements of the box were 
exactly the same as those which he used in constructing his 
apparatus. It was found necessary, however, to make some 
slight modification in the inclined plane and the electro-magnetic 
attachment. The plane which was first constructed according  
-P-A-G-E-6
6 WILLIAM T. HERON 
to Basset’s directions did not appear to be delicate enough in 
action. It would sometimes operate and sometimes not, even 
though the rat appeared to place the same amount of weight 
upon the same point on the plane. Some trouble was also 
encountered in keeping the contact-points clean. To obviate 
these difficulties the plane was reconstructed as shown in the 
accompaning diagram (fig. 1). A shows the support for the 
plane. It is simply a piece of brass bent at right angle at both 
ends, and screwed to the top of the table upon which the box is 
placed. B shows the plane which fits in between the upright 
pieces of A and is attached to them at the pivot C. This plane is 
made of wood with 2 inches below the pivot and 2 inches above. 
  
      
Fie. 1, Tue IncLInED PLANE as IT Was Finatty DEVELOPED 
The details of the plane are described in the text 
Thus the plane has a constant tendency to tip downwards and 
operate the contact apparatus. D is a piece of hard rubber 2 
inches long, 3; inch thick, and 3 inch wide. Z£ is a piece of hard 
spring copper of the same width and slightly longer than D. F is 
a screw with a large head into which a depression is bored for the 
purpose of holding a small amount of mercury. When £ is 
pressed down, it makes contact with the mercury by means of the 
small point at its upper end. G is another screw which holds Z 
to D and to which one wire is attached. The other wire is 
attached to screw Ff’. Since B is not balanced, a certain amount 
of the resilence of # is required to hold up the end of the plane 
resting upon it, but leaving plenty of clearance between the 
mercury and the contact point of Z. This makes the plan2  
-P-A-G-E-7
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 7 
fool-proof so that the proper amount of weight applied above the 
pivot C will invariably make a good contact and thus operate the 
magnet. 
It was found in the operation of the electro-magnetic apparatus 
that the sharp metallic click of the armature against the core of 
the magnet when contact was made would almost invariably 
frighten the animal. This fright was often so great that an 
association would be fixed quickly between the plane and the 
noise. The character of the results on the preliminary group

of animals, as given below, will demonstrate the seriousness of 
this factor. Thus it was found necessary to cover the arma- 
ture with a piece of soft rubber. This did not entirely elim- 
inate the noise, but it deadened the metallic click so that the 
remaining noise did not seem to frighten the animal. 
The control cage placed around the box was was 24 x 281 x 10 
inches. It was always kept in a constant position with regard to 
the box. The animals were allowed to enter the enclosure of 
this cage from a release box in the same manner as usual in a 
maze. The ground-plan (fig. 2) will show the relationship of the

cage, release-box, inclined plane, and problem box. X indicates 
the point over which an electric light was suspended, and W the 
position of the food within the box. 
Total time only was recorded for the problem box. It would be 
almost impossible to record accurately distance traversed in this

R is the release box; F, the food box 
apparatus with a camera lucida attachment unless the animals 
were in some way prevented from climbing up the sides of the box. 
Static time could have been recorded, but it was not thought 
practical to do so because the animal seldom came to rest in the 
problem box (as he would do in the maze).  
-P-A-G-E-9
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 9 
The maze used in the present problem was the Watson circular 
maze with the camera lucida attachment. The arrangement of 
the stops and openings is shown in the accompanying diagram 
(fig. 3). The true path is indicated by the broken line. 
The method of using the maze did not differ from that generally 
used by investigators. Each animal is released from the box R 
and a stop watch is started as soon as his whole body enters the 
first alley. The watch is stopped as soon as he has his entire body 
within the food box F. Static time is kept with a cumulative 
stop-watch. This watch is started each time that the animal 
ceases traversing horizontal distance. The time consumed by the 
animal in rearing up to examine the sides of the maze while 
keeping the hind feet on one spot was considered static time. 
The watch was stopped again as soon as the animal started to 
move in the horizontal plane. The static time was thus accumu- 
lated; and by subtracting it from the total time recorded by the 
first watch, the sum of the net time was calculated. 
The path which the animal traversed is recorded by means of 
the camera lucida attachment. These tracings are later meas- 
ured with a chartometer. The amount of surplus distance tra- 
versed can, if desired, be computed by subtracting the distance 
required for a perfect run from the total amount of distance 
traversed. 
SUBJECTS 
The subjects used in this experiment were eighty white rats of 
laboratory stock. They were divided into four different sets 
according to the training given them. These sets and the training 
given to each are as follows: 
Set I. This set of ten rats will be known as the preliminary 
set because they were used by the experimenter for practicing and 
perfecting his method. They were given completed learning, 
running one trial per day until they had reached the criterion of 
perfection used. (See “data and results” below.) 
Set II. There were 28 animals in this set. They will be known 
as the total learning rats. They were not started in the experi- 
ment until the apparatus and method were perfected, and were 
given completed learning in the same manner as was set I.
-P-A-G-E-10

Set III. This.set, composed of 22 animals, was given six trials 
in the problem box, one trial per day. The animals were then 
allowed to rest for sixty days, at the end of which time they were 
run one trial per day for six days in the maze. 
Set IV. The 20 rats in this set were run for six trials in the 
problem box and then given the same period of rest as set III 
At the close of this period they were again returned to the problem 
box for six more trials. 
The age of the rats when they were started in the experiment 
varied between fifty and seventy days. Previous to being 
started in training all the animals were thoroughly tamed by being 
handled and fed by the experimenter. The animals, previous to 
their use in the problem box, were allowed to eat on the table 
within the control cage for several days. The problem box was 
removed at such times, but the inclined plane was allowed, to 
remain. 
The experimental work was done at night beginning at about 
seven o’clock. In cases where there was an exception to this 
rule, the variation was not more than three hours. No animals 
of any particular set were allowed to feed before the others. 
When an animal had finished his trial, he was placed in a box and 
kept there without food until the others of his set were through 
and then all were fed together. During experimentation all 
animals were fed on a chair and no food was placed in their 
cages. They were allowed to eat to satiety while on the chair. 
With the conditions thus controlled, it is believed that the 
following results are as representative as it would be possible to 
make them. 
DATA AND RESULTS 
Total learning 
The degree of perfection to which the rat must attain before 
he is said to have arrived at completed learning is our first con- 
sideration. Perfection may be estimated in terms either of 
speed or of accuracy. Investigators lay emphasis upon one or the 
other by requiring either that the animal complete the trial in a  
-P-A-G-E-11
  RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 11 
certain amount of time or that he perform the operation without 
making any errors. In the present experiment it was decided to 
use the latter criterion of perfection for the reasons which are 
stated below. The rat was trained, therefore, until he could 
perform the operation of opening the box and entering it without 
making any false movements. Upon repeating such a perfor- 
mance three days in succession it was considered that he had 
completely learned the problem. : 
There were four possible paths which the animal might take in 
an errorless performance. These four are shown in figure 2. 
A record was kept of the path which the animal took in the 
performance of each errorless trial. Although it was not neces- 
sary that the animal take the same path in each of the three 
perfect trials which constituted the criterion of completed learn- 
ing, yet in practice it was found that the animal invariably took 
the same route each time. It was also found that in the great 
majority of cases the animals took the route numbered three in 
the sketch. This is probably due to the fixation of an association 
between food and the position of the door, 
The criterion of accuracy, instead of speed, was chosen, 
first, because when the rat had attained the degree of accuracy 
required, he was performing the problem in a minimum of time. 
Second, this criterion is more comparable to that which is 
generally used in the maze. This reason, however, is not im- 
portant so far as the present work is concerned because the com- 
parison which is here made between the maze and problem box 
did not involve completed learning records in either case. The 
third and last reason for using the criterion of accuracy rather 
than speed is, I believe, the most important of all. The latter 
criterion, as used by Basset, required that the animal complete 
the whole operation of opening the box and entering it within 
a period of four seconds, and, furthermore, did not permit the 
rat to spend more than two seconds in going either from the 
entrance of the control cage to the plane or from the plane to the 
entrance of the problem box. In other words, the rat might per- 
form the operation in the allowed time of four seconds, but if he 
spent two and one-half seconds in going from the entrance of the
-P-A-G-E-12
Oe 
12 P WILLIAM T. HERON 
control cage to the plane and one and one-half seconds in going 
from the plane to the entrance of the problem box, he would not, 
make a perfect trial. Such a criterion seems to depend too much 
upon the physiological capacity of the rat to cover a given 
amount of distance in a given time. One animal may be making 
perfectly accurate movements yet because his rate of locomotion 
is slow, he is not considered to be making perfect trials. At 
- the same time, another animal may be making less accurate 
movements but, because his speed of moving is rapid, he is said 
to be making perfect trials. From this point on the learning of 
the first animal is not concerned with solving the problem of 
accuracy but rather with increasing its rate of travel. 
In the criterion used in the present experiment, the above 
physiological factor is ruled out. When the animal has learned 
to solve the problem, he is done and it is not necessary to give 
him training to increase his speed of locomotion. 
Some difficulties, however, were found in carrying out con- 
sistently the criterion of learning outlined above. Five of the 
28 rats (set II), e.g., formed a position habit of going around the 
box two times before stepping at the proper place on the plane 
and entering the box. These rats would almost invariably run 
too close to the box on the first time around. They would not, 
however, try to enter the door upon making this circle but would 
continue at full speed past it. All of these rats in set II were 
given from 20 to 58 trials more than the average number of 
trials necessary for the rest of the rats to complete their learning 
according to the criterion. The average number of trials given 
to the rats with the position habit is 37 more than the average 
number of trials given to the others. Despite this these rats 
never broke themselves of the habit. They did, however, reduce 
their time until it was on a par with the rats who were making 
perfect trials, although they were, of course, traveling twice as far. 
Some decision must be made concerning the disposal or use of 
the records of these rats in making our calculations. Because of 
the fact above mentioned that the rats reduced their time of 
travel to an equality with that of the other rats, it was decided 
that the criterion, upon the basis of which these records could be
-P-A-G-E-13
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 13 
used in computations, would be three successive trials the average 
time of which did not exceed the average time of the three perfect 
trials of the other rats. Using this as the criterion of completed 
learning with these rats, it is found that the average number of 
trials necessary for them to complete the learning is 56 which 
is 21 more than the average number necessary for the rats using 
the other criterion. This gives some indication of the serious- 
ness of the criticism made of an arbitrary time limit as a criterion, 
if the learning is to consist merely in learning the problem and not 
also in an increase in speed of muscular contraction. 
The following table (table 2) gives a summary of the records 
made by the various animals in learning the problem. It was 
thought preferable not to use the records of the preliminary set, 
because of the change of method and apparatus which was 
made during their learning period. Data for this set are therefore 
not presented. 
Table 3 shows the results of dividing the time for the rats into 
tenths according to the method of division suggested by Miss 
Vincent. This method is as follows: If the rat has required 27 
trials, let us say, to complete the learning, then the first tenth 
will be the time for the first two trials and 0.7 of the time for the 
third; the second tenth will be the remaining 0.3 of the third 
trial plus trials four and five and 0.4 of trial six. This process is 
continued until all of the 27 trials are used. If the rat requires 
only ten trials to complete the learning, then the time for every 
trial would be one-tenth. If he requires seven trials, then one- 
tenth would be constituted from 0.7 of the time of a trial, etc. 
The learning curve for these rats made by plotting minutes 
against trials (fig. 4) does not deviate greatly from the ordinary 
type of learning curve. The only variation noticeable is the 
great rise at the second trial. Such a marked rise does not 
generally occur in learning curves, although there may be a slight 
increase. I believe that this rise may be attributed to the fact 
that the food in the case of the problem box, is always in such a 
position that it may be sensed by the animal. This being the 
case, the first time the animal is placed in the box his timidity 
keeps him from going on any exploratory expeditions to the top

relatively short period of time. On the second trial, however, 
the situation is less fearsome and the rat makes a thorough 
exploration which may lead entirely away from the plane for a 
relatively long period of time. On the third trial, this curiosity 
having been more or less appeased, the main object of the rat is 
to get the food and consequently he again stays close to the sides 
of the box. 
There is practically no difference between the curve excluding 
the rats with the position habit and that including them. The 
only deviation of any note is in the 34th trial where there is a rise 
in the curve including the rats with the position habit due to the 
great amount of time (353 seconds) which it took rat no. 49 to 
work the problem that day. 
The curve plotted on the basis of tenths (figure 5) is naturally 
smoother than the trial curve due to the fact that many of the 
inequalities neutralize each other. It shows, however, that by 
the end of the fifth tenth that the learning is practically com- 
pleted so far as the elimination of time is concerned. The rise 
in time of the second trial was absorbed in the first and second 
tenths in such a way that it does not show on the curve. The 
increase of time in the thirty-fourth trial does, however, cause 
arise in the seventh tenth. The value of such a curve lies in the 
fact that all of the rats are represented in the whole of the curve. 
The smaller the division made, the greater would be the value of 
the curve in showing daily variations. 
On the basis of these total learning records we are able to apply 
one of the methods already enumerated for the determination 
of the question of the reliability of the problem box. These 
calculations are given and discussed in the next division of the 
paper. 
RELIABILITY 
Total learning 
The calculation of the coefficient of reliability from the total 
learning records must be made by the second method described 
by Whipple, i.e., the correlation of the sums of the odd and even 
trials. It is assumed that if chance errors are not operating to 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
    
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 19 
a serious degree to vitiate the practise effects, there should be a 
high correlation between the odd and even trials. Or, stated 
another way, high correlations between odd and even parts of 
learning indicate the activity of common factors. 
The correlation calculated by this method, using the Spear- 
man foot-rule formula, was found to be only 0.17, + 0.081, in- 
cluding the records of the rats with the position habit, and 0.09, 
+ 0.089 when they wereexcluded. These coefficients are insignifi- 
cant, thus indicating that the factors determining performance in 
the odd trials are but slightly in evidence, if at all, in determining 
performance in the even trials. 
In the problem box, as in all other apparatus in which the rat 
is used, the first few trials seem to be occupied largely by explora- 
tory movements, the operation of the apparatus coming as an 
accident during the course of these movements. It is very 
possible then that the factors operating in these trials would be 
sufficient to destroy the correlation between the odd and the 
even trials. In order to test the effect of the early trials upon 
the correlation, the time of the consecutive odd trials to and 
including the seventh was progressively deducted from the total 
time of the odd trials, and the time of the consecutive even trials 
to and including the eighth was progressively deducted from the 
total time of the even trials. After each deduction the correla- 
tion was again made. Table 4 gives these correlations and also 
the ones already mentioned. All coefficients, unless otherwise 
noted, are made from data including the results of the rats 
with the position habit. 
The above results are striking in view of the fact that despite 
the increase in the homogeneity of the data, the highest co- 
efficient (0.63) is obtained when the greatest number of trials is 
eliminated. In other words, the more the chance errors are 
eliminated by deducting early trials, the greater is the con- 
sistency of the results (with the exception of the unexplained 
R of 0.50) in spite of practice effects which have smoothed the 
time records so that only a very slight variation in a single trial 
would destroy the correlation. Disregarding any other implica- 
tions which these coefficients may have, it is at least evident that

the experimenter should disregard the records of the first two 
trials in making computations from his results. This is virtually 
done in much human experimentation when the investigator 
first gives his subjects a trial practice series before beginning the 
actual experiment. 
However, it is difficult to evaluate the correlations obtained 
by progressively deducting trials, because in making such a 
a deduction one is making an artificial division of the rat’s 
learning process. This division is not equal for each rat, because 
the rat that learns the problem in 10 trials, theoretically learns 
more in each trial than does the rat that requires 24 trials to

complete the problem. Thus by the time 8 trials have been 
deducted one has eliminated four-fifths of the former rat’s 
learning and only one-third of the latter’s learning. Another 
factor which if present would affect correlations made on the 
above basis is that of occasional increases or decreases in the 
efficiency of one or several rats. 
In order to obviate, as far as possible, the effect which these 
factors might have upon the correlations, the odd and even 
tenths (method of division given above) of total learning time 
were correlated. These correlations, which include the results 
of the rats with the position habit, are given in table 5.
-P-A-G-E-21
  
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 21 
Although none of the correlations is as high as Whipple’s 
standard, all are reliable save the first one. The increasing 
magnitudes of the R’s indicate clearly that in the later part of 
learning the odd and the even tenths are determined by common 
factors to a degree not true in the first part of learning. So far 
as this method goes, therefore, the implication is that only the 
later portions of the rat’s problem box learning are reliable. 
Other methods of examining the reliability of “the rat in the 
problem box” method are discussed in the following sections.

Correlations from partial learning in the problem box 
The purpose of this section of the experiment is to determine 
whether or not the rats retained their same relative standing in 
the time required to make six trials in the problem box after an 
interval of sixty days had elapsed between the last trial of the 
first six trials and the first trial of the second six. Records 
taken in this manner may be used in the calculation of the 
coefficient of reliability by the first method mentioned above, 
page 4, and quoted from Whipple. The assumption is that if 
the apparatus is reliable, the animals should retain their relative 
ranks in the group when tested under as far as possible the same 
conditions, but at two different times. If there is no such  
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 WILLIAM T. HERON 
correspondence in relative rankings then there must be factors 
inherent in the apparatus or in the animal which destroy the 
consistency of the performance. It would, consequently, be 
impossible to get reliable data in experiments conducted to 
test the effects of extraneous factors upon the learning process. 
The data here presented are based on the records of 20 rats. 
These records are correlated trials against trials and totals 
against totals. Table 6 gives the results of these calculations.

None of the above correlations is significant. The highest 
coefficient is 0.37, which is not quite four times the probable error. 
The correlation of the total time for the two periods of learning is 
only —0.098 which only equals the probable error. This coeffi- 
cient is raised by eliminating the time for the first two trials in 
each period. Even after this rise, however, it still remains 
insignificant. Significant data are also to be found in a study of 
the learning curves, data bearing particularly upon retention. 
The learning curve (fig. 6) for the twelve trials which these 
rats were given is plotted with trials on the X-axis and seconds 
on the Y-axis. It is much more irregular and starts on a lower 
level than the curve for the rats that were given total learning.

There is, however, a gradual drop and the first trial of the second 
period starts on a lower level than the last trial of the preliminary 
six trials. There is a slight rise, however, in the eighth trial 
which brings this point on the curve a little above the corre-

total time required for trial 9 is 1465 seconds as opposed to 1490 
seconds for trial 8. Thus, trial 9 would be on the same level as 
trial 8 if the curve were plotted without the records of these

time for the former for the first six trials was 1238.8 seconds, 
while for the latter it was only 725.7 seconds. The total learning

and the six day rats took 424.4 seconds.

  Tables 7, 8 and 9 present additional data on retention. Atten- 
tion is drawn to the column headed “Savings in per cent.’ It 
will be noticed that the amount of time saved by individual rats 
in the second series over that of the first is in most cases very 
large. In the case where only a single trial is considered there are

only four rats which show a longer time for the first trial of the 
second series than for the last trial of the first series. When two 
trials are considered there are two additional cases of longer time 
in the second series. A comparison of total times (table 9)

shows that there are five rats who took longer for the second 
series than for the first. 
This retention is similar in relative amount to that found by 
Book (15) in his work on typewriting. He found that the average 
number of strokes which the subjects made on the typewriter 
were more after a long period of rest than the average strokes
-P-A-G-E-27
  RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 27 
made during the original practice period. In other words, there 
was a gain in the speed of writing over a long period of no practice 
with the exception of ten days practice about five months after 
the end of the first practice period and one year before the 
final test. The conclusions which he drew are as follows: 
The increase in score shown by our second memory series was owing, 
so far as we could make out, rather to the disappearance, with lapse of 
time, of numerous psycho-physical difficulties, interfering associations, 
bad habits of learning, interfering habits and tendencies, which as they fade, 
left the more firmly established typewriting associations free to act. 
Watson (16) criticises Book’s conclusions as follows: 
The curve of the original learning is not reproduced here, but the 
fact is that he stopped practicing on a spurt. Had he taken the records 
for ten more days his average would probably have been around 1700 
strokes per ten minutes instead of 1503. Furthermore, the practice 
gained from the ten days in June, 1906, was not without marked effect 
upon the succeeding and final memory tests. Hence, it seems that we 
need only to conclude that there is a tremendously great and surprising 
permanence in the functioning of the typewriting habit, but nothing 
super-natural in character. 
This problem is too large for solution in terms of the data 
presented in this paper. The theoretical discussion, also, would 
lead us too far from the proper topic of our study. It may be 
pointed out, however, first, that the curves of figure 6 show no 
particular spurt at the close of the sixth trial, and second, that any 
learning process interrupted in its early stages will be interrupted 
when its curve is descending more or less rapidly and retention 
studies may well yield results different from those for habits 
which are upon a plateau. (This problem is now being studied 
by Professor Hunter.) 
This factor of retention is a troublesome one in estimating the 
validity of the coefficient of reliability obtained by correlating 
the results obtained at different times. Thus, Burt (17) says, 
in speaking of the mirror drawing test:
-P-A-G-E-28
28 WILLIAM T. HERON 
The correlation at the Elementary School between the total results 
of the first series of sittings and those of the second was 0.52. From 
its very nature the mirror drawing experiment cannot strictly be held 
to test quite the same capacity on repetition. The observed figures 
indicate considerable retention by the subjects of the effects of the 
first sitting; and doubtless the degree of retention is not the same for 
all. Indeed, the second series was undertaken partly with hope that it 
might furnish a test of the retentiveness of improvability rather than of 
improvability itself. No method, however, presented itself of isolating 
this second capacity, and of differentiating the subjects accordingly. 
In any case the difference of retentiveness does not seem to have been 
great. And of the various substitutes for a reliability coefficient that 
one might devise, the figure cited above probably gives the best approx- 
imation for these particular experiments. 
Inasmuch as the coefficients of reliability for the problem box, 
as given above, are very low, the conclusion must be forthcoming 
that so far as our results can show, the problem box is an un- 
reliable test when used with the white rat, unless other factors 
can be found which will account for these low coefficients or 
unless it is shown that the factor of retention is sufficient to 
produce this result. And, with reference to this last point, it 
must be remembered that all attempts to calculate the reliability 
of any situation in which the rat is used will undoubtedly en- 
counter this difficulty of retention. 
There is left, however, one more approach to the question of 
reliability, and since we have found factors in both previous 
approaches which may or may not affect our coefficients of 
reliability, as determined by those methods, the problem box 
should be given one more chance to prove itself reliable. This 
approach is made in the following section. 
Correlation of learning in the maze with learning in the problem-box 
The method which has been frequently employed to determine 
the reliability of intelligence tests given to human beings is to 
correlate the standing in the intelligence test with the standing 
in school grades or with the estimation of the subject’s ability by 
a competent judge. In animal behavior, however, it is, of course,  
-P-A-G-E-29
  
  RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 29 
impossible to give the animal an intelligence test or to-estimate its 
ability by observation, but an approximation to the above method 
may be made by correlating ‘the results of two different tests to 
which the animals have been subjected. 
In order to do this, the 22 animals used in this section of the 
experiment were first given six trials in the problem box, then 
allowed to rest sixty days after which they were run for six trials 
in the maze. Six trials were used in order that the problem 
should not be so thoroughly learned that retention would greatly 
affect the results, and also in order that the age factor might be 
more adequately controlled. The fact that the rats were sixty 
days older when they were put in the maze than when they were 
in the problem box should not affect the learning in the maze, 
since Miss Hubbert, granting the truth of her conclusions, 
found no age effects in such a short period of time. 
Correlations were made between the various measures taken 
in the maze (distance, net time, and gross time) and the time 
records from the problem box. These correlations are given in 
tables 10 to 13. The probable error for all coefficients is 0.093. 
A glance at the correlations presented here shows that the 
experimenter has been unable to find a relationship between the 
time required for six trials in the problem box and the various 
measures of the learning for six trials in the maze. The highest 
correlation found was —0.33 which is between the time for the 
fourth trial in the problem box and gross time for the third trial 
in the maze. The coefficient, however, is only three times the 
probable error and therefore cannot be considered highly 
significant. 
It is not possible to Abevanisnet any of the experimental data here 
presented in such a way as to show why there is not a relation- 
ship between the learning process in the maze and that in the 
problem box. From a priori grounds, however, two possible 
reasons may be cited. The first is that in the problem box the 
‘food is always so placed that it may stimulate the olfactory and 
possibly the visual sense organs of the rat. The possible influence 
of this factor has already been discussed on page 16. The second 
is that in the problem box, the rat is not compelled to make so

many choices between the right and the wrong way to go; whereas, 
in the maze, the animal has to make a choice at every doorway 
between the true path and the cul-de-sac. A comparison of the 
performance of my rats in the maze with the performance of Miss 
Maupin’s untrained rats in the same. maze fails to reveal any 
unambiguous signs either of transfer or of interference due to 
training sixty days previously on the problem box. In the event, 
however, that such a relationship did exist, it could not be the - 
cause of an insignificant correlation. 
In the absence of experimental data which could indicate the 
reasons for a lack of correlation between performance in the 
problem box and performance in the maze under the present 
experimental conditions, I would only call attention to the follow- 
ing interpretative points: First, the absence of correlation 
further indicates the unreliability of the “rat in the problem 
box”’ as a source of information concerning the learning process. 
Second, the reader should bear in mind that, in spite of the appar- 
ent absence of correlation, problem box learning has been re- 
garded, at least tacitly, as of the same general character as maze 
learning. And third, the causes of the apparent absence of 
correlation may lie in the nature of the rat as well as in that of 
the apparatus and method. 
Inasmuch as the correlations in this and in the preceding sec- 
tion were made with six trials only, it is necessary to determine 
what the relationship is between six trials and total learning. 
This question is also related to the problem of the existence of 
an adequate criterion of learning which will involve something 
less than completed learning. This problem and its relationship 
to the above correlations is treated in the following section. 
An adequate criterion of learning and tts relation to the problem 
of reliability 
The purpose of the calculations made in this section is to 
determine whether or not there is some part of total learning 
which will place the rat equally well as to his ability in the solu- 
tion of the problem as do the results of total learning. If such a 
part can be found, and if it is a small enough part of total learn-
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 WILLIAM T. HERON 
ing, then a great saving of time to the experimenter will result. 
It is also necessary to treat this problem in the present study in 
order to justify the use of only six trials in the correlations of 
results of the problem box obtained at two different applications, 
and in the correlation of the maze and the problem box. 
Lashley (18) has done some work on the criterion of learning 
in the maze and has correlated the number of trials preceding the 
" first perfect run with the generally used criterion of three perfect 
runs in succession. He found a correlation coefficient of 0.62 
0.063 by use of the Pearson product moment method. He con- 
cludes that if there is found to be a difference in the average 
number of trials required to arrive at one perfect run between 
several groups of animals then these groups of animals will 
show the same relative difference in the average number of trials 
required for completed learning. 
There is a question involved in making such a calculation which 
has not been mentioned by Lashley, viz., the justification of the 
use of trials rather than time or distance as a measure of the 
learning progress of the rat. Trials, it is true, have been more 
generally used for this purpose; but in the case of my own data, 
the correlation between the total trials and the total time is ° 
0.0103 with a probable error of +0.081. This coefficient is 
only one-eighth as large as the probable error. Such a non- 
correspondence of trials and time is also shown if we examine 
some of the individual records. The most striking example of 
this is shown in the case of rats 20 and 38. Thus rat 20 used 43 
trials to complete the problem with a total time of only 771 
seconds, while rat 38 used only 10 trials but a total time of 1010 
seconds. Theoretically, it would seem that time is a more deli- 
cate measure of the rat’s ability than are trials, since it is a 
more or less accurate measure in time units of the effort which the 
rat puts forth in learning the problem. Trials, on the other hand, 
are only arbitrarily fixed units of the distribution of that effort 
without any reference to the amount of such effort. Correlations 
have been made, however, using both measures and these, 
together with the various parts of learning which have been 
correlated, are listed in table 14.  
-P-A-G-E-33
  
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 33 
These correlations indicate that, of the shorter criterions which 
are correlated with total time, the time for the first six trials is the 
best. It gives a correlation of 0.51 while the standard of com- 
parison which Lashley used, except that the data is time instead 
of trials, gives a correlation of 0.44. The difference between 
these two standards, as far as the correlation goes, is not a 
significant one; but there would seem to be no reason for hesitancy 
in choosing which to use inasmuch as the six trials is by far the 
shorter criterion of the two. The next shortest is two perfect 
trials regardless of position. This criterion gives a correlation

of 0.61. Two perfect trials in succession give a high correlation 
0.72, which is to be expected since in a great number of cases 
these two perfect trials are the first and second trials of the 
three perfect trials in succession which is the criterion used for 
completed learning. 
As can be seen from a glance at the table, similar correlations 
made with trials did not give a single significant coefficient. The 
highest one, 0.24, which is for total trials versus trials including 
two perfect runs in succession, is only three times the probable 
error, while the other two are less than the probable error. 
These coefficients would tend to strengthen the supposition that 
trials are not so good a measure of the learning process as is time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 WILLIAM T. HERON 
When it was found that the correlation between the first six 
trials and total time was high, it was thought that by throwing 
out the first two trials a still higher correlation mightbeattained. 
Especially was this thought possible since the disregarding of the 
first two trials gave a much higher correlation between the odds 
and the evens (see above, page 20). Similar results did not 
follow in this case, however, since the correlation falls to 0.46 
when the first two trials only were omitted, and to 0.34 when the 
third and fourth trials only were used. 
The close relationship shown to exist between the time re- 
quired for the first six trials and total learning time justifies our 
use of six trials in the study of reliability as presented previously 
in this paper. A further justification lies in the fact that had 
complete learning and then complete relearning been required 
the measure would have been chiefly one of retention whereas we 
have sought as far as possible to correlate two independent tests 
of performance. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Three different methods have been used in this experiment to 
investigate the reliability of the inclined plane problem box as a< 
method of testing the learning ability of the rat. First, the 
correlation of performances in odd and even portions of total 
learning; second, the correlation of performance in six trials 
with performance in six more trials after a lapse of sixty days: and 
third, the correlation of performance in six trials in the problem 
box with performance in six trials in the maze sixty days later. 
The results of all three methods as used in this experiment were 
consistent in showing the reliability, or consistency, of the prob- 
lem box to be very low. It was possible, however, in the case 
of the odd versus even tenths or trials to get a larger coefficient 
by eliminating the first of the learning process. The results 
suggest that at least the first two trials should be disregarded by 
experimenters when they are investigating the effects of ex- 
traneous factors upon the learning ability of the rat. 
There was found to be a large amount of retention after an 
interval of sixty days. At the beginning of the second series of
-P-A-G-E-35
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 35 
trials, the rats started on a lower level than they had reached at 
the close of the first series. Thus there was a net gain in skill 
over the sixty day interval and this gain was about half as much 
as if the learning had not been interrupted. 
The criterion of learning which would be the best to choose, if 
a shorter criterion than total learning is desired, would be the 
total time for the first six trials. This criterion gave a coefficient 
of 0.51 when correlated with the total time required to arrive at 
the criterion of three perfect trials in succession. 
No correlation was found between maze and problem box 
learning, under the conditions of the present investigation. The 
reason for this may lie in such factors as the difference in the 
position of the food in the two pieces of apparatus, or it may lie 
partly also in the nature of the rat.

II. CORRELATION STUDIES WITH THE MAZE:-IN RATS 
AND HUMANS 
WALTER S. HUNTER 
The University of Kansas 
PROBLEM 
The present study seeks to throw light upon the nature of 
motor learning in the maze through the use of two methods: 
First, the correlation of various records from the maze learning 
of humans with scores on the Otis intelligence test; and, second, 
the inter-correlation of various records secured in the maze 
learning both of humans and of rats. Such a study has the 
possibility of throwing significant light upon a variety of im- 
portant problems among which may be mentioned: the relation- 
ship between a given case of motor learning and general intelli- 
gence as measured by the Otis scale; the relationship between 
performance in one part of the learning process and in other 
parts; the relationship between intelligence and various portions 
of the learning process; the rédle of chance in maze learning; the 
influence of the degree of complexity of the maze upon the 
above problems; and the differences in maze performance between 
rats and humans. 
The present paper! should be read in conjunction with: “Habit 
interference in the white rat and in human subjects” by Hunter 
(1); “The reliability of the inclined plane problem box as a 
measure of learning ability in the white rat” by Heron (2); and 
“The reliability of the maze as a measure of learning ability in 
the white rat” by Maupin (3). These papers all emphasize 
correlation data secured from various learning situations. The 
net result is a very serious critical attack upon the use of the 
customary rat data in the solution of learning problems.

APPARATUS 
Two mazes were used with human subjects. Figure 1 repre- 
sents the simpler one, termed pencil maze A, and figure 2 repre- 
sents the more complex one, termed pencil maze B. A descrip- 
tion of the first maze and of the method used has been published 
in the habit interference study (1). Pencil maze B was con- 
structed of wood with alleys + inch wide. The metal stylus 
used by the subject in tracing was about 33; inch in diameter. 
There was therefore relatively little play of the stylus possible 
from one side of the alley to the other. Each maze was learned 
at.a single sitting. In each case records were taken of total time 
per trial, and with maze B error records were also made. These

latter were taken in place of distance records, the recording of 
which offered more difficulties than it seemed worth while to 
overcome. An error was counted as any retracing along the 
true path, any entrance into a cul-de-sac, and any retracing 
within a cul-de-sac. The unit of error was the distance between 
any two turns in the maze. In each maze learning, the subject 
was blindfolded and given the following instructions: 
Now that you are blind-folded, I shall place a stylus (or pencil) in 
your hand and guide you (so) until the stylus is within the groove of 
the maze. You are to find the shortest way out of this groove by mov- 
ing until I say “‘out.”” Do not lift the stylus up so that it slips out of the 
groove. Work for an early mastery of the problem.

An interval of forty-five seconds was given between trials 
In maze A, 5 correct trials in succession were required for 
mastery. (In this maze the subjects were told that they must 
make 5 trials without error before mastery would be complete.)

Three mazes were used with rats: (A) a unit maze, built on the 
plan of the T-shaped discrimination box, shown in figure 3 and 
previously used in the above mentioned study of habit inter- 
ference; (B) a circular maze of greater complexity shown in 
figure 4 and also used in the habit interference study; and (C) a 
circular maze of still greater complexity, shown in figure 5, used

by Miss Maupin. In the unit maze both time and error records 
were taken, errors being recorded according to the usual custom in 
discrimination experiments. Time and distance (using the 
camera lucida attachment) records were secured with the circu- 
lar mazes. Ten trials daily were given with maze A; two trials 
daily, with maze B; and one trial daily, with maze C. The 
criterion for mastery in maze A was 19 trials correct out of 20 
successive trials. Four successive trials without error were re- 
quired for the learning of maze B, and three correct trials in 
succession for maze C.

Intelligence ratings of the human subjects were secured with 
the Otis intelligence test, 1919 edition, form A. In each case 
the intelligence score used in the present study is for a subject 
who claims never to have taken an intelligence test before. 
Thirty-one human subjects were tested with pencil maze A, 
but Otis scores were available for only 17. All of the 17 sub- 
jects were elementary laboratory people unfamiliar with maze 
work. This was true also of 25 of the total group. The remain- 
ing 6 were either advanced students or instructors and were 
familiar with maze problems, although not with this particular 
one. Forty-two elementary laboratory people, unfamiliar with 
maze work, were examined with pencil maze B. All subjects

were cautioned against imparting information concerning the 
plan of the maze; and no evidence of coaching was secured, 
although each subject was pleasantly quizzed upon the subject 
prior to the maze test. Otis scores were available for all subjects 
in the latter group, making in all 59 available maze and Otis 
records. The intelligence examinations were given at the first 
meeting of the elementary laboratory class when the students 
were presumably in a particularly docile attitude toward the 
instructor. 
All rats were approximately thirty days old at the time experi- 
mentation began and were without previous training of any 
kind. Twenty-five animals were used on the unit maze; 36 on 
circular maze B; and Miss Maupin kindly furnished me the 
records for 24 animals on the circular maze C. 
CURVES AND DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE HABITS STUDIED 
The curves and distributions presented in this section of the 
paper furnish the data necessary for the general understanding 
of the habits studied. 
Table 1 presents the essential facts for the distributions of 
total time with the three rat mazes. An inspection of this data 
shows clearly that the mazes belong to three markedly different 
grades of difficulty. This is further shown in figure 6 which 
presents the Vincent curves of learning for the three mazes. 
These curves also show the average amounts of effort, as meas- 
ured by time, expended in the successive tenths of learning. 
During the first half of learning, the mazes require very signifi- 
cantly different amounts of effort and, in the second halves of 
learning, the amounts of improvement seem still to be inversely 
related to the difficulties of the mazes. On inspection, the 
curve for maze A suggests, by its atypical character, that the 
essential factors in learning are insufficiently indicated by the 
time records. This conclusion, however, cannot be drawn 
without reservation because the correlation data in table 8 show a 
high degree of relationship between the standing of subjects in 
the various tenths of learning. This would seem to mean that 
while the time differences are slight from trial to trial they do 
nevertheless tend to remain constant between individuals.

Table 2 and figure 7 give similar data for the pencil mazes

apparent. 
Table 3 presents distribution data for the Otis scores. Special 
attention is called to the wide range of scores in the 42 subjects 
used with maze B. (It may not be amiss to state that, if possi- 
ble, greater precautions for insuring accuracy of maze records 
were taken with individuals having extremely high or low Otis

THE CORRELATION OF OTIS SCORE AND MAZE PERFORMANCE 
Table 4 shows the Pearson correlations calculated between 
the Otis scores and various items derived from the mastery 
of pencil maze B. Attention should be called first of all to the 
fact that reliable correlations are found in humans between 
performance in the maze and performance in another test of 
adaptive capacity, the Otis. This fact is new only in so far as 
adaptive capacity is correlated in the present instance with the 
complete learning of a pencil maze. The students of intelligence 
tests have demonstrated time after time that adaptive capacity— 
if we may so name the complex of characters rated by the tests— 
correlates with specific performance in a wide range of problems. 
No extended array of these correlations needs to be cited, but 
mention may be made of the following: First, Otis states (4) 
that score on his test has a correlation between 0.50 and 0.80 with 
school marks. Second, the Porteus group maze test (5) correlates 
0.456 with the army intelligence a examination, 0.50 with score 
on the army alpha test, and 0.82 with total score on the army

beta test of which it is a part. The Porteus individual maze 
test correlates with mental age 0.582; and with total score on 
twenty tests of which it is one, the correlation is 0.66. 
The interpretation which I wish to place upon the facts just 
emphasized is twofold: In the first place the human animal does 
show a stability of response which enables us to demonstrate the 
existence of factors common to several behavior situations. In 
the second place, the human animal shows a stability of response 
in the particular situations presented by the total learning of a 
complex pencil maze and by the examination in terms of the Otis 
intelligence test. This stability is evidenced by the correlations

in the tables in this section of the paper. It is possible to charac- 
terize this aspect of human behavior as follows: Normally 
man is not the victim of every passing stimulus. He possesses in 
high degree the capacity to hold himself to a given stimulus- 
problem. This makes it easily possible to set him two or more 
related tasks and to secure data which will enable us to predict 
from performance in the one to performance in the other. The 
capacity underlying stability of response suggests, on the con- 
scious side, ability to concentrate attention. It is opposed to 
flightiness and to chronic indecision. Without wishing to 
prejudice to any degree the case for animals below man, I would 
point out that common opinion regards certain at least of them

(as, e.g., the monkeys) as highly distractible, undependable and 
flighty. Without dwelling longer upon this topic, we shall 
examine certain other phases of the tabular material and return 
in the section on rat responses to the question of stability of 
behavior. 
Table 4 contains the very definite indication that total time is 
a better indication of ability than either total trials or total 
errors. The unreliability of the correlation for trials is in 
harmony with the criticism published in my paper on habit 
interference above referred to and suggested previously by Carr 
in the article discussed in the following paragraphs. Much dis- 
cussion in the past has borne upon the relative values of the 
curves of learning and in general the time curve has been the 
most favored. However, when the question has been not one of 
curves but of the magnitude of effort put forth in the mastery 
of the problem, total trials has been the value stated. Further 
results and criticisms in harmony with this position are presented 
by Maupin (as yet unpublished). 
Hicks and Carr published an important article on “Human 
Reactions in the Maze” in 1912 wherein they discuss various 
criteria of intelligent ability (6). Three groups of subjects were 
employed, rats, children and human adults. These three groups 
are assumed to represent three levels of intelligence. The data 
secured indicate an inverse relation between degree of intelli- 
gence, as shown by the three groups, and surplus time and errors 
eliminated. The suggestion is also made that a relationship 
exists between intelligence and the comparative rate of elimina- 
tion of errors and distance. This group of data, however, is 
more ambiguous than that on surplus values and the relationship 
involved may be due to the similarity of error and distance rec- 
ords. Hicks and Carr bring up the discussion of the relationship 
between slope of the curve and intelligence as originally 
presented by Thorndike, Hobhouse and Watson. However 
they dissent from views previously held as follows: 
Our results indicate that the rational status of a group of animals 
cannot be inferred from the slope of a curve in so far as this slope is 
dependent upon the number of trials or the relative rate of elimination. 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
48 WALTER 8. HUNTER 
They indicate, moreover, that inferences as to intelligent status are 
legitimate in so far as the slope is determined by the factor of total 
values eliminated, but that the relation between the abruptness of 
slope and the degree of rational ability is just the inverse of that assumed 
by Thorndike and Hobhouse (7). 
The correlations of table 4 confirm in part the position defended 
by Carr. The standing of the individuals in surplus times 
eliminated correlates with their Otis score to the extent of 
—0.45 +£0.08. This, however, is identical with the correlation 
for total time and leads to the conclusion that surplus time has no 
practical advantage over total time as an indicator of relative 
intelligence. Total errors are always surplus errors and give a 
correlation of —0.34 +0.087 with intelligence. With reference 
to the slope of the curve as a criterion of intelligent status, we 
are again in partial agreement with Carr. I have attempted to 
rate the slope of the curve partly in terms of the height of the 
first few trials but more significantly in terms of the total drop in 
the curve between the first and the fourth points on the base 
line. Neither the time of the first trial nor the total time of the 
first three trials correlates reliably with the Otis. However, the 
time of the best of the first three trials (a criterion frequently 
used in mental test work) does give a reliable correlation, —0.33 
+0.087, with the Otis. The time of the first trial minus that 
for the fourth trial gives an unreliable coefficient, as might be 
expected from the dubious value to be attached to trial records. 
The total drop in the Vincent curve from the first tenth to the 
fourth tenth shows a reliable correlation with intelligence as 
measured by the Otis, —0.33 +0.087. Our data therefore show 
that the slope of a curve representative of the learning process 
(the Vincent curve) is related to intelligence. To this extent our 
data differ from Carr’s. They agree, however, on this point: 
that the greater the slope, i.e., the greater the difference between 
the first and the fourth tenth, the lower is the Otis score. Before 
leaving this topic, it would be well again to call attention to the 
wide range of Otis scores, 82-202, found among our subjects. 
It seems quite probable that the intelligence differences exceed 
those found in Hicks and Carr’s two human groups. It is   
  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-49
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 49 
further to be noted that our own data apply to a single species 
and not to two as is the case in the other paper. 
Table 4 also contains correlations showing the degree of rela- 
tionship between the Otis score and time spent in each tenth of 
learning. Inspection of this material fails to show any close 
relationship between general intelligence score and either the 
first or the last half of learning. The two halves seem about 
equal from this point of view. The correlations in the middle of 
learning range higher than at either end. This may be due to 
chance, or it may be due to the overshadowing effect of other 
factors at the two ends of the learning process. 
Table 5 shows correlations between Otis scores and perform- 
ance in maze A, the simple pencil maze. Maze A, has the

same pattern as maze A, but with the turns reversed. It was 
learned after maze A in the experiment on habit interference. Al- 
though these correlations are low and have very little if any relia- 
bility, they suggest the same conditionsrevealedintable 4. All are 
negative (where the Otis score is involved). Even the amount of 
time saved in passing from one maze to the other appears to be 
inversely related to Otis score. This, if true, would not neces- 
sarily mean that the most intelligent subjects could profit least 
by training; but would mean, in this experiment, that the most 
intelligent subjects work within the lowest time limits and have 
the least improvement to make. The correlation between the 
total times spent in learning the two mazes is copied here 
from the habit interference paper for comparison. It shows a 
high and reliable relationship between the two performances. 
Even though the factors determining total times are only slightly

different from that fo and are but slightly obscured by the spe- 
i which each maze was mastered. This, 
e paper has shown, is a situation quite 
und in rats. 
THE CORRELATION OF PARTS OF THE LEARNING PROCESS IN THE 
VARIOUS HABITS 
In securing the correlation data presented in tables 6-10, 
the standing of the subjects in each tenth of learning has been 
placed over against their standing in each succeeding tenth. 
The coefficients within each table have been secured by a single 
method, although some tables are based upon the foot-rule 
method and others upon the Pearson. This method of handling 
the parts of the learning processes for the various habits is an 
attempt to unravel the part played in successive portions of 
learning by the various factors which influence it. In the pre- 
ceding section data were given indicating the extent to which the 
factors determining Otis score were present in the various parts 
of the learning curve. No particular portion, unless it was the 
central one, was particularly favored. The total time of learn- 
ing, when correlated with the Otis, did show that common 
factors were significantly at work. The present section seeks to 
gain some light, through the rise and fall of coefficients, upon the 
way that factors rise and fall in their influence throughout the 
learning process. If we knew what each of the factors influenc- 
ing learning was, and if we had in addition reliable measures of 
these factors, the task would be much less difficult. Lacking 
these we can only seek our information by what seem the best 
available means. ‘ 
Progress in the formation of a given habit is determined by: 
First, the general adaptive capacity of the individual, his general 
intelligence, the degree of which is indicated approximately by the 
Otis score; second, the special ability, if this exists, in the field 
from which the particular habit is chosen; and third, by various 
temporary factors such as fatigue, distraction, interest, motives, 
change of cues (often voluntary), fixation of critical errors or 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 51 
critical true responses, application of disadvantageous methods, 
etc. So far as the factors of group 3 are not under control in the 
typical experiment, I prefer to group them together and term 
them chance. In the maze experiment, as in most if not all 
habit experiments, the control exercised over these factors is 
of a very uncertain degree. With all subjects, human or infra- 
human, an attempt is made to keep fatigue, distraction and 
motive constant. But do the various subjects react to the same 
distractions, or experience the effects of fatigue at the same times, 
or work with equivalent motives? Individual records indicate 
that they do not. With human subjects, one attempts a further 
control of offering certain verbal directions by means of which 
motives, cues (plans of action), aufgaben, and other factors may 
be influenced. But do the human subjects work with the same 
willingness from trial to trial or from time to time within the 
same trial? Are the subjects equal or even constantly different 
in the degree to which they meet distractions? Observations 
of one’s subjects must lead to a negative answer to these ques- 
tions. No control seems possible at present over distraction 
from within the subject, or over the fixation of critical responses, 
or over the use of wrong methods.? 
The process of habit formation is extremely complex. Where 
reliable positive or negative correlations are secured between 
two habits under present day conditions of experiment the cause 
would seem to be either happy accident or, if the findings are 
confirmed, to be some stability of response, some tenacity of 
purpose, some ability to stick to the problem, which can to a 
large or small extent nullify the factors of chance which we have 
2 Gould and Perrin (8), writing in 1916, comment upon the factor of chance 
discovery in the maze as an influence in learning and seek to relate this to 
the réle of intelligence. Although they believe that the maze problem places a 
premium upon chance, no data are advanced to show that this is true in man or 
that the maze differs in this respect from all learning problems. All learning 
involves a certain amount of random, undirected movement, during the execution 
of which uncontrolled factors (chance) may make themselves especially effective. 
The question at issue in the reliability of the maze is whether or not the chance 
factors are sufficient to obscure effects of other factors under investigation. 
Gould and Perrin also present data indicating that human adults have an 
average maze record superior to that for children.
-P-A-G-E-52

discussed. As a matter of fact, we have indicated earlier in the 
present paper and also in the habit interference paper that no 
significant correlation is found between performances in two 
succeeding habits with rats whereas a high corelation is evident 
with humans. In addition a reliable correlation of —0.45 was 
found for humans between total time on a complex maze and 
score on the Otis test. At that time also we suggested the 
hypothesis of stability of response in explanation of the data in 
question. 
If our analysis is correct it should receive support from the 
material of tables 6-10. Table 6 is based upon the simple pencil

maze; table 7, upon the complex pencil maze; table 8, upon the 
simplest rat maze; table 9, upon the rat maze of intermediate 
complexity; and table 10, upon the most complex rat maze. 
The coefficients in table 7 were secured by the Pearson product- 
moment method. All other coefficients were secured by the 
foot-rule formula. Inasmuch as Pearson coefficients range much 
higher than foot-rule coefficients, comparisons are only possible 
when corrections have been made. For R values above 0.30, 
the corresponding r values are approximately 0.2 greater. For 
R values from 0.10 to 0.30., the corresponding 7 values excesses 
increase from 0.08 to 0.18.. In the inspection of the tables 
particular attention should be given to the following features:
-P-A-G-E-53
RELIABILITY OF PROBLEM BOX AND MAZE 53 
First, the magnitudes of the coefficients; second, the amount and 
frequency of fluctuations in values; third, the general standard 
of values in the first horizontal line when compared with other 
horizontals; and fourth, the existence of vertical, horizontal or 
diagonal trends in the magnitudes of coefficients. 
The first point that attracts our attention is that the more 
complex habits offer the lower correlations. The values of 
table 6 are much superior not only to those of table 7 but also 
to those of table 8 for the simple rat maze. Table 8 in its turn 
shows values on the average superior to those for the more 
complex rat mazes in tables 9 and 10. Not only do the simpler

mazes show the higher correlations, but they also show no changes 
of sign. The simpler the maze, theoretically, the less oppor- 
tunity there is for chance to affect the records and the greater 
is the amount of control possible over the subject. The tables 
give empirical support to this hypothesis, the only unexplained 
exception being the left diagonal column of table 9. There is 
very little difference between the tables for the two complex 
rat mazes. I should account for this fact by the assumption 
that both mazes offer about as much opportunity for chance 
variations as our method is calculated to reveal. The sugges- 
tion is apparent, therefore, that so far as disturbance by chance 
factors during learning is concerned, the simpler the maze the 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 WALTER S. HUNTER 
more dependable its data. This may be true in spite of the 
previously recorded correlations between the Otis and the two 
pencil mazes. Those correlations considered only the end 
product of learning as represented in the total values involved 
in mastery. The shorter times involved in maze A, by giving 
more homogeneous data, would be expected to give lower cor- 
relations with an outside performance. 
Students of learning have long claimed that the influence of 
chance is peculiarly present in the first few trials of learning. 
Our data do not support this view. Chance is, of course, not a 
factor like fatigue or subjective attitude. It is a term applied, as 
we have already indicated, to the uncontrolled and haphazard 
working of various factors. An inspection of the first horizontal 
in tables 6 and 8 (the two simple mazes) shows that the constella- 
tion of causal factors at work in the first tenth of learning is also 
about equally present in the succeeding tenths. This is also 
true for the complex pencil maze. The two complex rat mazes 
(tables 9 and 10) show no significant correlations between. per- 
formance in the first tenth of learning and subsequent tenths; 
but then neither is there any particular correlation for the other 
tenths and those subsequent to them. Chance is manifest in 
high degree throughout the learning of these two mazes. 
To the extent that the constellation of factors influencing a 
given tenth of learning is uninterfered with in its operation during 
another tenth to that extent will the correlation between per- 
formances be high. Immediately adjacent tenths would be 
expected to show higher correlations than tenths separated by 
one or more intervening tenths. ‘Not only would one assume 
this, but he would also expect closeness of relationship to decrease 
as the temporal interval between tenths increased. The light 
which our tables can throw upon these questions will come from 
an examination of the horizontal, vertical and diagonal columns 
of coefficients. In all tables the correlations of immediately 
adjacent tenths (found in the diagonal column at the left) tend to 
be higher than others in the same table. In tables 9 and 10, 
these adjacent tenth coefficients are practically the only ones 
having any reliability. Even in the simplest rat habit (table 8),

however, the coefficients along the first diagonal are low, with 
the lowest in the middle three tenths. This means that even 
in the best controlled rat habit the constellation of factors 
determining performance in one tenth of learning are not notable 
in determining performance in adjacent tenths. However, these 
constellations are more effective in the first three values than in 
the succeeding three values of the diagonal. This is further 
argument against the hypothesis that chance plays its greatest 
role in the early stages of learning. The values for adjacent 
tenths in the two human habits are lower for the first than for 
the last portion, but the variation is striking only in the simpler 
habit. Here the last part of the learning shows a very great 
stability. This relatively great freedom from chance disturb- 
ances is also evidenced by the tendency, shown both in hori- 
zontal and vertical columns, for the higher coefficients to occur 
between those tenths which are the nearest to each other. 
The data of these tables as they have been examined lend 
further confirmation to the hypothesis stated before that the 
rat even in the simplest habit shows a greater instability of re- 
sponse than does man.

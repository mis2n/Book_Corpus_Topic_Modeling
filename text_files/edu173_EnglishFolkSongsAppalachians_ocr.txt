INTRODUCTION 
| The effort that has been made to collect and preserve in permanent 
rm the folk-songs of England during the last twenty or thirty years 
} jas resulted in the salvage of many thousands of beautiful songs. It 
xs pardonable, therefore, if those who, like myself, had assisted in the 
isk had come to believe that the major part of the work had been 
mpleted. So far as the collection in England itself was concerned, 
this belief was no doubt well founded. Nevertheless, in arriving at this 
ery consolatory conclusion, one important, albeit not very obvious 
onsideration had been overlooked, namely, the possibility that one or 
»ther of those English communities that lie scattered in various parts 
* the woild might provide as good a field for the collector as England 
If, and yield as bountiful and rich a harvest. The investigation 
sich my colleague Mrs. Campbell began, and in which later on I came 
» bear a hand, has proved that at least one such community does in 
ct exist in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North America. 
he region is an extensive one, covering some 110,000 square miles, 
ind is considerably larger than England, Wales, and Scotland com- 
ined. It includes about one third of the total area of the States of 
orth and South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, 
.‘abama, and Georgia.* The total population exceeds five millions, or, 
xuuding city dwellers, about three millions. : 
The Country and its Inhabitants. The reader will, I think, be in a 
etter position to appreciate and assess the value of the songs and ballads 
_ which form the major part of this volume if, by way of preface, I give 
some account of the way in which they were collected and record the 
pression which the inhabitants of this unique country made upon me. 
Sut I must bid him remember that I claim to speak with authority only 
‘with respect to that part of the mountain district into which I penetrated 
und that the statements and opinions which are now to follow must be 
accepted subject to this qualification.

  iv Introduction 
I spent nine weeks only in the mountains, accompanied throughout 
by Miss Maud Karpeles, who took down, usually in shorthand, the words 
of the songs we heard, while I noted the tunes. Mr. John C. Campbell, 
the agent for the Southern Highland Division of the Russell Sage Foun- 
dation, went with us on our first expedition and afterwards directed our 
journeyings and, in general, gave us the benefit of his very full knowledge 
of the country and its people. Our usual procedure was to stay at one 
or cther of the Presbyterian Missionary Settlements and to make it our 
centre for a week or ten days while we visited the singers who lived 
within a walking radius. In this way we successively visited White 
Rock, Allanstand, Alleghany and Carmen, Big Laurel and Hot 
Springs, in North Carolina, and thus succeeded in exploring the 
major portion of what is known as the Laurel Country. Afterwards 
we spent ten days at Rocky Fork, Tenn., and a similar period at 
Charlottesville, Va. I should add that had it not been for the generous 
hospitality extended to us by the heads of the Missionary Settlements 
at which we sojourned, it would have been quite impossible to prosecute 
our work. 
The present inhabitants of the Laurel Country are the direct. de- 
scendants of the original settlers who were emigrants from England and, 
I suspect, the lowlands of Scotland. I was able to ascertain with some 
degree of certainty that the settlement of this particular section began 
about three or four generations ago, 7.e. in the latter part of the eight- 
eenth century or early years of the nineteenth. How many years 
prior to this the original emigration from England had taken place, I 
am unable to say; but it is fairly safe, I think, to conclude that the 
present-day residents of this section of the mountains are the de- 
scendants of those who left the shores of Britain some time in the 
eighteenth century. 
The region is from its inaccessibility a very secluded one. There 
are but few roads—most of them little better than mountain tracks— 
and practically no railroads. Indeed, so remote and shut off from outside 
influence were, until quite recently, these sequestered mountain valleys 
that the inhabitants have for a hundred years or more been completely 
isolated and cut off from all traffic with the rest of the world. Their 
speech is English, not American, and, from the number of expressions, 
they use which have long been obsolete elsewhere, and the old-fashioned 
way in which they pronounce many of their words, it is clear that they 
are talking the language of a past day, though exactly of what period 1 
am not competent to decide. One peculiarity is perhaps worth the 
‘
-P-A-G-E-5
  Introduction v 
noting, namely the pronunciation of the impersonal pronoun with an 
aspirate—‘‘hit”’—a practice that seems to be universal. 
Economically they are independent. As there are practically no 
available markets, little or no surplus produce is grown, each family 
extracting from its holding just what is needed to support life, and no 
more. They have very little money, barter in kind being the customary 
form of exchange. 
Many set the standard of bodily and material comfort perilously 
low, in order, presumably, that they may have the more leisure and 
so extract the maximum enjoyment out of life. The majority live 
in log-cabins, more or less water-tight, usually, but not always, 
lighted with windows; but some have built larger and more comfortable 
homesteads. 
They are a leisurely, cheery people in their quiet way, in whom the 
social instinct is very highly developed. They dispense hospitality with 
an openhanded generosity and are extremely interested in and friendly 
toward strangers, communicative and unsuspicious. “But surely you 
will tarry with us for the night?” was said to us on more than one occasion 
when, after paying an afternoon’s visit, we rose to say good-bye. 
They know their Bible intimately and subscribe to an austere creed, 
charged with Calvinism and the unrelenting doctrines of determinism 
or fatalism. The majority we met were Baptists, but we met Methodists 
also, a few Presbyterians, and some who are attached to what is known 
as the ‘‘Holiness’’ sect, with whom, however, we had but little truck, as 
their creed forbids the singing of secular songs. 
They have an easy unaffected bearing and the unselfconscious 
manners of the well-bred. I have received salutations upon introduction 
or on bidding farewell, dignified and restrained, such as a courtier might 
make to his Sovereign. Our work naturally led to the making of many —— 
acquaintances, and, in not a few cases, to the formation of friendships of 
a more intimate nature, but on no single occasion did we receive anything 
but courteous and friendly treatment. Strangers that we met in the 
course of our long walks would usually bow, doff the hat, and extend the 
hand, saying, ‘‘My name is ; what is yours?” an introduction which 
often led to a pleasant talk and sometimes to singing and the noting of 
interesting ballads. In their general characteristics they reminded me 
of the English peasant, with whom my work in England for the past 
fifteen years or more has brought me into close contact. There are 
differences, however. The mountaineer is freer in his manner, more 
alert, and less inarticulate than his British prototype, and bears no trace  
-P-A-G-E-6
  vi Introduction 
of the obsequiousness of manner which, since the Enclosure Acts robbed 
him of his economic independence and made of him a hired labourer, has 
unhappily characterized the English villager. The difference is seen in 
the way the mountaineer, as I have already said, upon meeting a stranger, 
removes his hat, offers his hand and enters into conversation, where the 
English labourer would touch his cap, or pull his forelock, and pass on. 
A few of those we met were able to read and write, but the majority 
were illiterate. They are, however, good talkers, using an abundant 
vocabulary racily and often picturesquely. Although uneducated, in 
the sense in which that term is usually understood, they possess that 
elemental wisdom, abundant knowledge and intuitive understanding 
which those only who live in constant touch with Nature and face to face 
with reality seem to be able to acquire. It is to be hoped that the 
schools which are beginning to be established in some districts, chiefly 
in the vicinity of the Missionary Settlements, will succeed in giving them 
what they lack without infecting their ideals, or depriving them of the 
charm of manner and the many engaging qualities which so happily 
distinguish them. 
Physically, they are strong and of good stature, though usually 
spare in figure. Their features are clean-cut and often handsome; while 
their complexions testify to wholesome, out-of-door habits. They carry 
themselves superbly, and it was a never-failing delight to note their 
swinging, easy gait and the sureness with which they would negotiate the . 
foot-logs over the creeks, the crossing of which caused us many anxious - 
moments. The children usually go about barefooted, and, on occasion 
their elders too, at any rate in the summer time. Like all primitive 
peoples, or those who live under primitive conditions, they attain to 
physical maturity at a very early age, especially the women, with whom 
marriage at thirteen, or even younger, is not unknown. 
I have been told that in past days there were blood-feuds—a species 
of vendetta—which were pursued for generations between members of, 
certain families or clans; but, whenever circumstances connected with 
these were related to me, I was always given to understand that this 
barbarous custom had long since been discontinued. I have heard, too, 
that there is a good deal of illicit distilling of corn spirit by ‘‘moonshiners”’, 
as they are called, in defiance of the State excise laws; but of this, again, I - 
personally saw nothing and heard but little. Nor did I see any con- 
sumption of alcohol in the houses I visited. On the other hand, the 
chewing or snuffing of tobacco is a common habit amongst young and 
old; but, curiously enough, no one smokes. Indeed, many looked 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
f Introduction vii 
askance at my pipe and I rarely succeeded in extracting more than a half- 
hearted assent to my request for permission to light it. 
That the illiterate may nevertheless reach a high level of culture 
will surprise those only who imagine that education and cultivation are 
convertible terms. The reason, I take it, why these mountain people, 
albeit unlettered, have acquired so many of the essentials of culture is 
partly to be attributed to the large amount of leisure they enjoy, with- 
out which, of course, no cultural development is possible, but chiefly 
to the fact that they have one and all entered at birth into the full 
enjoyment of their racial heritage. Their language, wisdom, man- 
ners, and the many graces of life that are theirs, are merely racial 
attributes which have been gradually acquired and accumulated in 
_ past centuries and handed down generation by generation, each genera- 
tion adding its quotum to that which it received. It must be re- 
membered, also, that in their everyday lives they are immune from 
that continuous, grinding, mental pressure, due to the attempt to “‘make. 
a living,’ from which nearly all of us in the modern world suffer. Here 
no one is ‘fon the make”; commercial competition and social rivalries 
are unknown. In this respect, at any rate, they have the advantage 
over those who habitually spend the greater part of every day in 
preparing to live, in acquiring the technique of life, rather than in its 
enjoyment. 
I have dwelt at considerable length upon this aspect of the mountain 
life because it was the first which struck me and further, because, without 
_atealization of this background, it will be difficult for the reader to follow 
intelligently what I have to say. But before I leave this part of my 
subject I must, in self-justification, add that I am aware that the 
outsider does not always see the whole of the game, and that I am fully 
conscious that there is another and less lovely side of the picture | 
which in my appreciation I have ignored. I have deliberately done so 
because that side has, I believe, already been emphasized, perhaps with ay 
unnecessary insistence, by other observers. 
The Singers and-their Songs. My sole purpose in visiting this 
country was to collect the traditional songs and ballads which I had heard 
from Mrs. Campbell, and knew from other sources, were still being sung 
there. I naturally expected to find conditions very similar to those 
which I had encountered in England when engaged on the same quest. 
But of this I was soon to be agreeably disillusioned. Instead, for instance, 
of having to confine my- attention to the aged, as in England where no 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii Introduction 
one under the age of seventy ordinarily possesses the folk-song tradition, 
I discovered that I could get what I wanted from pretty nearly every one 
I met, young and old. In fact, I found myself for the first time in my 
life in a community in which singing was as common and almost as 
universal a practice as speaking. With us, of course, singing is an 
entertainment, something done by others for our delectation, the cult 
and close preserve of a professional caste of specialists. The fact has 
been forgotten that singing is the one form of artistic expression that 
can be practised without any preliminary study or special training; that 
eyery normal human being can sing just as every one can talk; and 
that it is, consequently, just as ridiculous to restrict the practice of 
singing to a chosen few as it would be to limit the art of speaking to 
orators, professors of elocution and other specialists. In an ideal 
society every child in his earliest years would as a matter of course 
develop this inborn capacity and learn to sing the sorigs of his fore- 
fathers in the same natural and unselfconscious way in which he now 
learns his mother tongue and the elementary literature of the nation to 
which he belongs. 
And it was precisely this ideal state of things that I found existing 
in the mountain communities. So closely, indeed, is the practice of this 
particular art interwoven with the ordinary avocations of everyday life 
that singers, unable to recall a song I had asked for, would often make 
some such remark as, “‘Oh, if only I were driving the cows home I could 
sing it at once!”’. On one occasion, too, I remember that a small boy 
tried to edge himself into my cabin in which a man was singing to me 
and, when I asked him what he wanted, he said, ‘‘I always like to go 
where there is sweet music.” Of course, I let him in and, later 
on, when my singer failed to remember a song I had asked for, my little 
visitor came to the rescue and straightway sang the ballad from beginning 
to end in the true traditional manner, and in a way which would have 
shamed many a professional vocalist (see No. 15, B). I have no doubt 
but that this delightful habit of making beautiful music at all times and 
in all places largely compensates for any deficiencies in the matter of 
reading and writing. 
But, of course, the cultural value of singing must depend upon the. 
kind of songs that are sung. Happily, in this matter the hillsman 
is not called upon to exercise any choice, for the only music, or, at 
any rate, the only secular music, that he hears and has, therefore, any 
opportunity of learning is that which his British forefathers brought with 
them from their native country and has since survived by oral tradition.
-P-A-G-E-9
Introduction ix 
When, by chance, the text of a modern street-song succeeds in 
penetrating into the mountains it is at once mated to a traditional tune 
(e.g. No. 99) and sometimes still further purified by being moulded into 
the form of a traditional ballad (see No. 87). But this happens but rarely, 
for, strange as it may seem, these mountain valleys are in fact far less 
affected by modern musical influences than the most remote and secluded 
English village, where there is always a Parsonage or Manor House, or 
both, to link it to the outside world. 
We found little or no difficulty in persuading those we visited to sing 
tous. To prove our interest in the subject and to arouse their memories, 
we would ourselves sometimes sing folk-songs that I had collected in 
.England, choosing, for preference, those with which they were un- 
acquainted. Very often‘ they misunderstood our requirements and 
would give us hymns instead of the secular songs and ballads which we 
wanted; but that was before we had learned to ask for ‘‘love-songs,”’ 
which is their name for these ditties. It was evident, too, that it was 
often assumed that strangers like ourselves could have but one object 
and that to ‘‘improve’’, and their relief was obvious when they found 
that we came not to give but to receive. 
It is no exaggeration to say that some of the hours I passed sitting 
on the porch (7. e. verandah) of a log-cabin, talking and listening to songs 
were amongst the pleasantest I have ever spent. Very often we would 
call upon some of our friends early in the morning and remain till dusk, 
sharing the mid-day meal with the family, and I would go away in the 
evening with the feeling that I had never before been in a more musical 
atmosphere, nor benefited more greatly by the exchange of musical 
confidences. 
The singers displayed much interest in watching me take down their 
music in my note-book and when at the conclusion of a song I hummed 
over the tune to test the accuracy of my transcription they were as 
delighted as though I had successfully performed a conjuring trick. 
\/ The mountain singers sing in very much the same way as English 
folk-singers, in the same straightforward, direct manner, without any 
conscious effort at expression, and with the even tone and clarity of 
enunciation with which all folk-song collectors are familiar. Perhaps, 
however, they are less unselfconscious and sing rather more freely and 
with somewhat less restraint than the English peasant; I certainly never 
saw any one of them close the eyes when he sang nor assume that rigid, 
passive expression to which collectors in England have so often called 
attention.
-P-A-G-E-10
  x Introduction 
They have one vocal peculiarity, however, which I have never . 
noticed amongst English folk-singers, namely, the habit of dwelling 
arbitrarily upon certain notes of the melody, generally the weaker 
accents. This practice, which is almost universal, by disguising the 
thythm and breaking up the monotonous regularity of the phrases, 
produces an effect of improvisation and freedom from rule which is very 
pleasing. The effect is most characteristic in § tunes, as, for example, 
No. 16 G, in which in the course of the tune pauses are made on each of 
the three notes of the subsidiary triplets. 
The wonderful charm, fascinating and well-nigh magical, which the 
folk-singer produces upon those who are fortunate enough to hear him 
is to be attributed very largely to his method of singing, and this, it 
should be understood, is quite as traditional as the song itself. The 
genuine foll-singer is never conscious of his audience—indeed, as often 
as not, he has none—and he never, therefore, strives after effect, nor - 
endeavours in this or in any other way to attract the attention, much 
less the admiration of his hearers. So far as I have been able to com- 
prehend his mental attitude, I gather that, when singing a ballad, for 
««,instance, he is merely relating a story in a peculiarly effective way which 
he has learned-from his elders, his conscious attention being wholly 
concentrated upon what he is singing and not upon the effect which he 
himself is producing. This is more true, perhaps, of the English than of 
the American-singers, some of whom I found were able mentally to 
separate the tune from the text—which English singers can rarely do— 
and even in some cases to discuss the musical points of the former with 
considerable intelligence. 
I came across but one singer who sang to an instrumental accom- 
paniment, the guitar, and that was in Charlottesville, Va. (No. 11, B). 
Mrs. Campbell, however, tells me that in Kentucky, where I have not 
yet collected, singers occasionally play an instrument called the dulcimer, 
a shallow, wooden box, with four sound-holes, in shape somewhat like a - 
flat, elongated violin, over which are strung three (sometimes four) 
metal strings, the two (or three) lower of which are tonic-drones, the 
‘melody being played upon the remaining and uppermost string which is 
fretted. As the strings are plucked with the fingers and not struck with 
a hammer, the instrument would, I suppose, be more correctly called a 
psaltery. 
The only instrumental music I heard were jig tunes played on the 
fiddle. I took down several of these from the two fiddlers, Mr. Reuben 
Hensley and Mr. Michael Wallin, who were good enough to play to me.
-P-A-G-E-11
  
Introduction xi 
Whenever possible they used the open strings as drones, tuning the 
strings—which, by the way, were of metal—in a particular way for each 
air they were about to perform. I have not included any of these in this 
collection, but I hope, later on, to publish some of them when I have had 
further opportunities of examining this peculiar and unusual method of 
- performance. 
Many of the singers whose songs are recorded in the following pages 
had very large repertories. Mrs. Reuben Hensley, with the assistance 
of her husband and her daughter Emma, sang me thirty-five songs; while 
Mrs. Sands of Allanstand gave me twenty-five; Mr. Jeff Stockton of 
Flag Pond, Tenn., seventeen; Mr. N. B. Chisholm of Woodridge, Va.,_ 
twenty-four; Mrs. Tom Rice of Big Laurel, twenty-six; and Mrs. Jane 
en i no less than sixty-four. Attention has often 
been called to the wonderful and retentive memories of folk-singers in 
England, and I can vouch for it that these American singers are, in this 
respect, in no way inferior to their English contemporaries. 
None of the singers whom I visited possessed any printed song- 
sheets but some of them produced written copies, usually made by 
children, which they called ‘‘ballets”, a term which the English singer 
reserves for the printed broadside. 
It will be seen that in many cases we give several variants or different 
versions of the same song and that we have made no attempt to dis- 
criminate between these. The fact that no two singers ever sing the 
same song in identically the same way is familiar to all collectors, and 
may be interpreted in either of two ways. The upholder of the individ- 
ualistic theory of origin contends that these variants are merely incorrect 
renderings of some original, individual composition which, never having 
been written down, has orally survived in various corrupt forms. On 
the other hand, there are those—and I count myself amongst them—who 
maintain that in these minute differences lie the germs of development; 
that the changes made by individual singers are akin to the ‘‘sports” 
in the flower or animal worlds, which, if perpetuated, lead to further ideal 
development and, perhaps, ultimately to the birth of new varieties and 
species. There is no doubt that if this problem is ever to be solved it 
will be through the examination and analysis of genuine, authentic 
variants, such as we have done our best faithfully to record; and we make 
no apology, therefore, for printing so many of them. 
For very much the same reason, in addition to the variants derived 
from different singers, we have in many cases recorded the changes 
made by the individual singer in the successive repetitions of the tune
-P-A-G-E-12
xii Introduction 
in the course of his song. These are often of great interest and signifi- 
cance and sometimes show an inventiveness on the part of the singer that 
is nothing less than amazing as, for example, in Mr. Jeff Stockton’s 
version of ‘‘Fair Margaret” (No. 17, A). 
Mrs. Campbell and I have together collected 450 tunes. For the 
purposes of this volume, we have selected 325 of these, which are asso- 
ciated with 122 different sets of words—55 ballads and 67 songs. 
The distinction between the ballad and the song is more or less 
  arbitrary and is not easy to define with precision. Broadly speaking, - 
however, the ballad is a narrative song, romantic in character and, above 
all, impersonal, that is to say, the singer is merely the narrator of events 
with which he personally has no connection and for which he has no 
responsibility. The song, on the other hand, is a far more emotional and 
passionate utterance and is usually the record of a personal experience 
—very frequently of an amatory nature. 
The Ballads. The ballads have, probably, the longer history behind 
them; at any rate, they attracted the attention of collectors earlier than 
the songs—the reason, perhaps, why the ballads have suffered, far more 
than the songs, from the unscrupulous editing of literary meddlers. 
The ballad-air is necessarily of a straightforward type, as it is sung 
indifferently to verses often varying very widely in emotional character. 
Nevertheless, many of the ballad tunes are very lovely, as the musician 
who studies the contents of this volume will readily perceive. Such airs, 
for instance, as Nos. 3, 15, 19, 20, 27, 29, 35, 37, 39 and 47 make really 
beautiful music and are fully capable of standing alone, divorced from 
their texts, and of being played or sung as absolute music.. The most 
perfect type of ballad, however, is that in which the tune, whilst serving 
its purpose as an ideal vehicle for the words, is of comparatively little 
value when divorced from its text. ‘The False Knight upon the Road” 
(No. 1) is a good instance of this and, in my opinion, a splendid example 
of the genuine ballad at its highest pitch. 
It is greatly to be deplored that the literature of the ballad has, in 
the past, attracted so much more attention than the music. ~ Properly 
speaking, the two elements should never be dissociated; the music and 
the text are one and indivisible, and to sever one from the other is to 
remove the gem from its setting. Early poetry, to which category the 
traditional ballad belongs, was always sung or chanted; it was addressed 
to the ear, not the eye. While language appeals primarily to the intelli- 
Cae 
eS
-P-A-G-E-13
  Introduction xiii 
gence, its sound acts upon and arouses the Geotons Ye more especially 
when the words have been artfully chosen, into metrical rhythm 
and wedded to beautiful music. Of all human creations, language is 
perhaps the most distinctive and characteristic; its development has 
proceeded step by step with the progress of mankind from the savage to 
the cultivated being of the present day; and in the course of this evolution 
the ballad has played by no means an insignificant part. 
The texts of the first thirty-seven ballads in this book are all recorded; 
most of them 1 in various forms, in the late Professor-Child’s English and_ 
Scottish Ballads, The remaining eighteen ballads were either deliber- 
ately excluded by Child from his collection—no doubt for some very goo 
reason—or were unknown to him. - 
The references in the Notes at the end of this volume show which of 
these ballads have already been found and published in England. Most 
of these English references, however, are to versions recorded many years 
go, when collectors were content with a lower standard of accuracy, 
and cannot, therefore, be regarded as trustworthy as similar transcrip- 
tions of a later date. It will be noticed that twelve of the “Child” 
ballads, Nos. 1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 31 and 35, have not been 
recorded in the Journal of the English Folk-Song Society, nor in any of 
the recent standard publications. I regret that I am unable to give 
similar statistical information with respect to American records, but, 
unfortunately, I am not sufficiently acquainted with the nature of the 
discoveries that have been made, many of which are not yet accessible 
in printed form. I believe, however, that Nos. 25, 30 and 31 have not 
previously been found in any form in America, and that of the remaining 
thirty-four the texts, but not the tunes, have in most cases been alon 
recorded.   
    
    
          
         
The Songs. The song-melodies differ in many respects from those 
of the ballads. Structurally, many of them are built upon larger and 
more elaborate lines, while emotionally, for reasons already given, they 
are far more intense and more heavily charged with sentiment. Several 
of the mountain song-tunes are, in my opinion, very characteristic and 
beautiful; Nos. 56, 57, 58, 61, 62, 65, 69, 83, 88, 104 and 106, for instance, 
will challenge the very finest of the folk-tunes that have been found in 
England. Some of them, too, while conforming in type to the regular 
English folk-tune are yet in a measure so different that they may fairly 
be considered a fresh contribution to the subject. 
Some of the song-texts are quite new to me and are not to be found, 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  xiv Introduction 
so far as I have been able to discover, in any of the standard English 
collections, e.g., Nos. 57, 59, 63, 65, 68, 70, 79, 81, 86, 88, 91, 122 and 123. 
The literature of the traditional song does not, as a whole, compare 
favourably with that of the ballad. Many of the lines printed in this. 
volume are corrupt and unintelligible, while some of them are the merest 
doggerel. Nevertheless, a few of the verses are very beautiful, not merely 
by contrast but intrinsically. Stanzas, for example, such as 
When I see your babe a-laughing, 
It makes me think of your sweet face; 
But when I see your babe a-crying, 
It makes me think of my disgrace. 
and 
When your heart was mine, true love, 
And your head lay on my breast, 
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm 
That the sun rose up in the West. 
There’s many a girl can go all round about 
And hear the small birds sing,

contain all the essentials of genuine poetry and, in their feeling, in their 
artlessness, in the directness and simplicity of their verbal expression and 
the absence of circumlocution, reach a high level of imaginative and 
poetic expression. 
One curious hiatus in the repertories of the mountain-singers struck 
me very forcibly, viz. the total absence of songs of a ritual nature, e.g. 
Harvest-Home songs, Carols (with one notable exception, No. 13), 
May-day songs and others of religious origin, such as those associated 
with the Morris and Sword-dance ceremonies; as well as, for obvious 
reasons, all Cuckoo*, Primrose and other Spring songs. The reason for 
this, I take it, is because ritual observances belong to, and are bound up so 
closely with, the soil of a country that they do not readily survive trans- 
plantation; and partly, too, because the mountain people for the most 
part live in isolated dwellings and at considerable distances from one 
another and do not congregate in villages as in older and more settled 
* This statement must now (i. e. May, 1917) be modified, for I have just noted down in 
Knox Co.,, Ky., a version of ‘‘The Cuckoo is a fine bird,’’ a remarkable example, in the 
circumstances, of the persistence of tradition.

countries like England, a condition that would inevitably lead to the 
discontinuance of seasonal and other communal festivals. This latter 
reason may also account for the decadence of dancing amongst the 
mountaineers, although I have no doubt that religious scruples have 
also been a contributory cause—I noticed that in reply to my enquiries 
on this subject the euphemism ‘‘playing games” was always substituted 
for ‘‘dancing” by my informants. 
Scales and Modes. Very nearly all these Appalachian tunes are 
cast in ‘‘gapped”’ scales, that is to say, scales containing only five, or 
sometimes six, notes to the octave, instead of the seven with which we 
are familiar, a ‘‘hiatus”, or ‘‘gap’’, occurring where a note is omitted. 
To trace the history of this particular scale is to venture upon 
controversial ground. Personally, I believe that it was the first form of 
scale evolved by the folk which was in any way comparable with our 
modern major or minor scale. Originally, as may be gathered from the 
music of primitive tribes, the singer was content to chant his song in 
monotone, varied by occasional excursions to the sounds immediately 
above or below his single tone, or by a leap to the fourth below. Even- 
tually, however, he succeeded in covering the whole octave, but, even so, 
he was satisfied with fewer intermediate sounds than the seven which 
comprise the modern diatonic scale. Indeed, there are many nations at 
the present day which have not yet advanced beyond the two-gapped or 
pentatonic scale, such as, for instance, the Gaels of Highland Scotland; 
and, when we realize the almost infinite melodic possibilities of the 5- 
note scale, as exemplified in Celtic folk-music and, for that matter, in the 
tunes printed in this volume, we can readily understand that singers felt 
no urgent necessity to increase the number of notes in the octave. A 
further development in this direction was, however, eventually achieved 
by the folk-singer, though, for a long while, as was but natural, the 
two medial notes, required to complete the scale, were introduced 
speculatively and with hesitation. There are many instances in Irish 
folk-music, for example, in which the pitch or intonation of these added 
sounds is varied in the course of one and the same tune. This experi- 
mental and transitional period, however, eventually came to a close and the 
final stage was reached, so far as the folk-singer was concerned, when 
the diatonic scale, i.e. the 7-note scale represented by the white notes of 
the pianoforte, became definitely settled. And this is the scale which is 
commonly used by the English folk-singer of the present day. But even 
then, and for a long period after, the mediate sounds remained “ weak”  
-P-A-G-E-16
    xvi Introduction 
and were employed only as auxiliary notes or connecting links, rather 
than structural or cadential notes, so that the gaps, though covered up, 
were not concealed. And it was left to the art-musician to take the final 
step and evolve the 7-note scale of which every note could be used with 
equal freedom and certainty. 
Of the tunes in this volume, some are pentatonic; others belong to 
the transitional period and are hesitatingly hexatonic, or even heptatonic; 
while a few are frankly in the major mode, 7.e. diatonic 7-note tunes in 
which no indication of a pentatonic origin can be traced. For the benefit 
of those interested in this technical question, particulars concerning scale 
and mode are given at the head of every tune in the text. The names 
and characteristics of the 7-note diatonic modes need no explanation; 
but with regard to the pentatonic modes, which are but rarely employed 
by art-musicians, it may be as well, perhaps, to explain the method of 
classification and nomenclature adopted in this volume. This is set out 
in the chart on the opposite page. 
The five pentatonic modes there given have been derived in the 
following way :— 
If from the white-note scale of the pianoforte the two notes E and 
B be eliminated we have the pentatonic scale with its two gaps in every 
octave, between D arid F and between Aand C. As each one of the five 
notes of the system may in turn be chosen as tonic, five modes emerge, 
based, respectively, upon the notesC, D, F,Gand A. The gaps, of course, 
occur at different intervals in each scale and it is this distinguishing feature 
which gives to each mode its individuality and peculiar characteristic. 
The one-gapped or hexatonic scale, and the 7-note or heptatonic 
scale are, as we have already seen, derivates of the original pentatonic, 
obtained by the filling in, respectively, of one or both of the gaps. Miss 
Gilchrist (see Journal of the Folk-Song Society, v., pp. 150-153), whose 
very clear exposition of this matter I am in the main following, allows 
the lower gap, 7.e. between D and F, to be completed by the insertion of 
either E-flat or E-natural, and the upper gap, 7.e. between A and C, by 
the addition of B-flat; and by this method she has succeeded in classifying 
very satisfactorily her material, which consists entirely of Gaelic tunes. 
/ When, however, I came to apply this method to the mountain-tunes I 
found it necessary to make the following modification, viz., to take E- 
natural as the constant and invariable mediate note of the lower gap, and 
either B-flat or B-natural of the upper. The chart, given here, has, 
therefore, been constructed on this plan, z.e. Miss Gilchrist’s, modified 
in the way just explained.

  xviii Introduction 
This description will, it is hoped, enable the reader to understand 
the modal and scale index attached to each of the tunes printed in this 
volume. His attention, however, must still be called to two points. 
In some tunes it has been difficult to decide with certainty upon the 
“ tonic, for in pentatonic airs, or, at any rate, in these mountain melodies, 
the tonic is frequently and patently not the final note of the tune. Airs 
of this kind are called “‘circular,’’ because the final phrase is fashioned so 
that it may lead into the initial phrase without pause or break of con-» 
tinuity and thus complete the melodic circle. Strictly speaking, the 
singer on the final repetition of a circular tune should vary the last 
phrase so as to conclude upon the tonic; but this singers very rarely do— 
No. 25 is the only tune in this Collection in which this is done. 
Again, it will be seen that a heptatonic tune may, so far as its notes 
are concerned, be assigned indifferently to one or other of two modes. 
An ionian air, for instance, may belong to Mode 1, or Mode 3; a dorian to 
Modes 2 or 4, and so forth. The true classification in such cases is 
determined by detecting the “weak” notes, which, by disclosing the 
places in the scale where the gaps originally occurred, will thereby show 
the mode, of which the tune in question is a derivative. An ionian tune, 
for example, will be assigned to Mode 1 if its third be a weak note (as 
well as its seventh), and to Mode 2 if, instead of the third, the fourth be 
the weak one. Similarly a dorian air will be classified second or fourth 
Mode according as the second or third scale-degree be the weak note. 
Ethnological Origin of the Singers. If the prevalence of the gapped 
scale in the mountain tunes is any indication of the ethnological origin of 
the singers, it seems to point to the North of England, or to the Lowlands, 
rather than the Highlands, of Scotland, as the country from which they 
originally migrated. For the Appalachian tunes, notwithstanding their 
“gapped” characteristics, have far more affinity with the normal English 
folk-tune than with that of the Gaelic-speaking Highlander (cf. Journal 
of the Folk-Song Society, v., pp. 157-269), and may, therefore, very well 
have been derived from those who, dwelling on the borders of the High- 
land Kingdom, liad become infected to some extent with the musical 
proclivities of their neighbours. It will be observed, moreover, that the 
Notes contain a large number of references to Dean Christie’s Traditional 
Ballad Airs and to the late Gavin Greig’s Folk-Songs of the North-East, ; 
and both of these are collections of traditional songs from Lowland, not 
Highland, Scotland. 
There is, however, another possible explanation. For all that we 
~
-P-A-G-E-19
Introduction xix 
ee there is really no trustworthy evidence on this point—the 
nglish folk-singer of the eighteenth century may still have been using 
the gapped scale and may not have advanced to the understanding and 
use of the 7-note scale until the following century. And if this supposi- 
Ee be made—and it is at least a possible one—we may argue that the 
ncestors of our mountain singers hailed originally from England and 
hat they sang in the gapped scale because that was the habit which 
then prevailed amongst their contemporaries. An analysis of the names 
f the singers recorded in this volume does not help us very much, but, 
so far as it goes, it seems to support rather than to contradict this latter 
supposition. 
However, it is not a matter of any great importance which of these 
two hypotheses we accept, because, in either event, the tunes in question 
would quite correctly be called English. For, as folk-lorists will, I think, 
lagree, England and the English-speaking parts of Scotland must, so far 
as folk-tales, folk-songs and other folk-products are concerned, be re- 
garded as one homogeneous area. 
The Cultural Significance of Tradition. The words and the tunes 
in this Collection are typical and authentic examples of the beginnings 
and foundations of English literature and music. The history of man 
is the history of his efforts to express himself, and the degree to which 
he has at any given moment succeeded in doing this is the measure of 
the civilization to which he has attained. The method by which he 
has sought to achieve this end has been through the exercise and 
development of certain inborn and basic human faculties; and his 
achievements are concretely to be seen in the literature, music, paint- 
ing, dancing, sculpture and other art-works which each nation 
has created and accumulated and in which it finds reflected its own 
peculiar and distinctive characteristics. The process is a cumulative 
one, the children of each generation receiving from their fathers that 
which, with certain modifications and additions of their own, they be- 
queath to their children. The historian, however, will point out that 
this process is not uniformly progressive; that nations in the course of 
their development pass through different phases, and that, in consonance 
with these, their artistic output varies in character and quality from 
period to period. These variations, however, fluctuate within certain 
clearly defined limits, and are superficial rather than radical; so that, 
while each may reflect with greater or less fidelity the specific outlook of a 
particular epoch, the form of expression remains fundamentally true to |  
-P-A-G-E-20
XX Introduction 
one type, and that the national type. And this national type is always 
to be found in its purest, as well as in its most stable and permanent form, 
in the folk-arts of a nation. 
Although this theory of nationalism in art is now very generally 
accepted, the fact that it is based upon the intimate relationship which 
the art of the folk must always bear to that of the self-conscious, culti- 
vated and trained individual artist is too often overlooked. But, bearing 
this in mind, the significance and value of the contents of such a book 
as this become immediately apparent. We talk glibly of the creative 
musician, but, however clever and inspired he may be, he cannot, magi- 
cian-like, produce music out of nothing; and if he were to make the 
attempt he would only put himself back into the position of the primi- 
tive savage. All that he can do and, as a matter of fact, does, is 
to make use of the material bequeathed to him by his predeces- 
- sors, fashion it anew and in such manner that he can through it, 
and by means of it, express himself. It is my sober belief that if 
a young composer were to master the contents of this book, study 
and assimilate each tune with its variants, he would acquire just the 
kind of education that he needs, and one far better suited to his 
requirements than he would obtain from the ordinary Conservatoire 
or College of Music. 
Again, the value of such songs as these as material for the general 
education of the young cannot be overestimated. For, if education is to 
be cultural and not merely utilitarian, if its aim is to produce men and 
women capable, not only of earning a living, but of holding a dignified 
and worthy position upon an equality with the most cultivated of their 
generation, it will be necessary to pay at least as much attention to the 
training and development of the emotional, spiritual and imaginative 
faculties as to those of the intellect. And this, of course, can be achieved 
only by the early cultivation of some form of artistic expression, such as 
singing, which, for reasons already given, seems of all the arts to be the 
most natural and the most suitable one for the young. Moreover, 
remembering that the primary purpose of education is to place the 
children of the present generation in possession of the cultural achieve- 
ments of the past so that they may as quickly as possible enter into their 
racial inheritance, what better form of music or of literature can we 
give them than the folk-songs and folk-ballads of the race to which 
they belong, or of the nation whose language they speak? To deny 
them these is to cut them off from the past and to rob them of that 
which is theirs by right of birth. To put it another way, the aim of the
-P-A-G-E-21
  Introduction xxi 
educationist should be not to forge the first link of a new chain, but to 
add a fresh link to an old one. 
That culture is primarily a matter of inheritance and not of educa- 
tion is, perhaps, a mere truism, but it is one, nevertheless, which educa- 
tionists often forget. My knowledge of American life may be too slender 
for an opinion of mine to carry much weight, but I cannot withhold the 
criticism—advanced with the greatest diffidence—that the educational 
authorities of some of the larger cities in the United States are too ready 
to ignore the educational and cultural value of that national heritage which 
every immigrant brings with him to his new home, and to rest too con- 
fidently upon their educational system, which is often almost wholly 
utilitarian and vocational, to create the ideal American citizen. I admit 
that the problem which faces the educationist in America is a peculiarly 
difficult one, but it will, I am convinced, never be satisfactorily solved 
until the education given to every foreign colonist is directly based upon, 
and closely related to, his or her national inheritance of culture. 
Of the supreme cultural value of an inherited tradition, even when 
unenforced by any formal school education, our mountain community in 
the Southern Highlands is an outstanding example. Another, though 
negative, instance of the truth of the same principle may be seen in the 
contents of a book which Professor Lomax has recently compiled, con- 
cerning the songs of the cowboys of Texas.* Let me ask the reader to 
compare these with the songs of the Southern Highlanders. The com- 
parison is a fair one, for the cowboys live a communal life almost as 
isolated and shut off from the world as that of the mountaineers, and 
feel, accordingly, the same compelling desire to express themselves in 
song. They are not, or at any rate they would not, I imagine, consider 
themselves, in any way inferior to their neighbours; they are, I take it, 
less illiterate, while the life they lead is more vivid and exciting and far 
richer in incident. Why, then, is it that their songs compare so un- 
favourably with those of the mountain singers? It can only be because 
the cowboy has been despoiled of his inheritance of traditional song; he 
has nothing behind him. When, therefore, he feels the need of self- 
expression, having no inherited fund of poetic literature upon which to 
draw, no imaginative world into which to escape, he has only himself and 
his daily occupations to sing about, and that in a self-centred, self- 
conscious way, ¢g., ‘The cowboy’s life is a dreadful life”; “I’m a poor 
lonesome cowboy”’; “I’m a lonely bull-whacker’”—and so forth. 
Now this, of course, is precisely what the folk-singer never does.

  xxii Introduction 
When he sings his aim is to forget himself and everything that reminds 
him of his everyday life; and so it is that he has come to create an imagin- 
ary world of his own and to people it with characters quite as wonderful, 
in their way, as the elfish creations of Spenser. 
Mrs. Campbell and I realize that we are, of course, only at the 
beginning of our labours and that the contents of this book are but a 
first instalment. Indeed, when we consider into what a very small 
portion of the field we have as yet carried our investigations the magni- 
tude of the task before us seems overwhelming. But this may not in 
reality be so, for it may not, after all, be necessary to pursue our researches 
throughout the whole of the area with the same care that we have already 
given, say, to the Laurel Country. For folk-singing in the mountains is 
so live an art and so general a practice that in all probability by the time 
we have collected a certain number of songs—not necessarily a very 
great number—we shall find that we have exhausted the field. Whether 
or not this comforting supposition proves to be correct, we shall, neither 
of us, rest content until all of this material has been collected, either by 
ourselves or by others, published, and made generally available. 
We have in the following pages printed the songs exactly as we took 
them down from the lips of the singers, without any editing or ‘‘adorn- 
ments’’ whatsoever, and we have done so because we are convinced that 
this is the only way in which work of this kind should be presented, at 
any rate in the first instance. Later on, we may harmonize and publish 
a certain number of the songs and so make a wider and more popular 
appeal. 
But this can be done at leisure. The pressing need of the moment 
is to complete our collection while there is yet the opportunity—and who 
can say how long the present ideal conditions will remain unaltered? 
Already the forests are attracting the attention of the commercial world; 
lumber companies are being formed to cut down and carry off the timber, 
and it is not difficult to foresee the inevitable effect which this will have 
upon the simple, Arcadian life of the mountains. And then, too, there 
are the schools, which, whatever may be said in their favour, will always 
be the sworn enemies of the folk-song collector. 
I cannot allow myself to conclude these remarks without expressing 
my gratitude to the many friends who have assisted me in my investiga- 
tions. There are those in particular, who were kind enough to entertain 
me in their mountain homes:—Dr. and Mrs. Packard of White Rock; 
Miss Edith Fish of Allanstand; Mrs. Hamilton and Miss Bacon of Alle-

ghany; Miss Ollie Henricks of Big Laurel; and Miss Jennie Moor of 
Rocky Fork. Nor can I omit the names of some, at least, of those by 
whose help and advice I have so greatly profited:—Mrs. J. J. Storrow, 
who gave me assistance of a most practical kind; Professor Alphonso 
Smith, and Mr. John M. Glenn of the Russell Sage Foundation.

Six kings’ daughters lie drowned here 
And thou the seventh shall be. 
O turn your back to the billowy waves,

For it ill beseems an outlandish knight

He turned his back to the billowy waves,

Lie there, lie there, thou false young man, 
Lie there instead of me. 
You promised to take me to the North of Scotland, 
And there you would marry me. 
O give me hold of your little finger 
And hold of your lily-white hand, 
And I'll make you the ruler of all my estates 
And the ruler of all my land. ; 
No, I won’t give you hold of my little finger, 
Nor hold of my lily-white hand, 
And I won’t be the mistress of all your estates 
And the ruler of all your land. 
She rode on the milk-white steed, 
And by her went the bay, 
And together they came to her father’s castle 
Three hours before it was day. 
’T was then the pretty parrot spoke 
From his cage upon the wall: 
O what is the matter, my pretty colleen, 
Why did you not answer my call ? 
O hush, O hush, my pretty parrot, 
Don’t tell any tales upon me, 
And your cage shall be of the beaten gold 
And your perch of the almond tree. 
’T was then her father spoke 
From the chamber where he lay: 
O what is the matter, my pretty parrot, 
That you’re calling so long before day ? 
O these rats, these rats are at my cage door; 
They’re trying to take me away, 
So I am just calling my pretty colleen 
To drive these rats away.

He followed me up, he followed me down, 
He followed me in my room. 
I had no wings for to fly away, 
No tongue to say him nay. 
He took part of my father’s gold, 
Half of my mother’s fee ; 
He took two of my father’s stable steeds, 
For there stood thirty and three. 
The lady rode the milk-white steed, 
The gentleman rode the grey. 
They rode all down by the north green land 
All on one summer’s day. 
Light off, light off, my pretty fair miss, 
I tell you now my mind. 
Six pretty fair maids I’ve drownded here, 
The seventh one you shall be. 
Hush up, hush up, you old vilyun, 
That hain’t what you promised me. 
You promised to marry me over the raging sea, 
And then for to marry me. 
Turn your back and trim those nettles 
That grow so near the brim; 
They’ll tangle in my golden hair 
And tear my lily-white skin. 
He turned his back to trim those nettles 
That growed so near the brim; 
This young lady with her skilfulness 
She tripped her false love in. 
Lie there, lie there, you old vilyun, 
Lie there in the place for me. 
You have nothing so fine nor costly 
But to rot in the salt water sea. 
First she rode the milk-white steed 
And then she rode the grey. 
She returned back to her father’s house 
Three long hours before it was day.

He had not gone three mile out of town 
Till he looked back again, 
And saw her father and seven bretherens 
Come trippling over the plain. 
Sit you down, fair Ellender, he said, 
And hold this steed by the rein, 
Till I play awhile with your father 
And your seven bretherens. 
Fair Ellender she sat still. 
It wasn’t long till she saw 
Her own dear seven bretherens 
All wallowing in their blood.

Come tumbling by her foot.

But father you have no more, 
If you’re not satisfied with this, 
I wish you were in some mother’s chamber 
And me in some house or room. ~ 
If I was in my mother’s chamber 
You’d be welcome there.

Tl wind along with you. 
He mound her on a milk-white steed,

He swung a bugle horn all round about his neck 
And so went bleeding away. 
As he rode up to his father’s gate 
He tingled at the ring, 
Saying: O dear father, asleep or awake, 
Arise and let me in. 
O sister, sister, make my bed, 
My wounds are very sore. 
Saying: O dear mother, O bind up my head, 
For me you'll bind no more. 
It was about three hours till day, 
The cock began to crow. 
From every wound that he received 
His heart blood began to flow. 
Sweet William he died like it might be to-day, 
Fair Ellender tomorrow. 
Sweet William he died for the wounds he received, 
Fair Ellen died for sorrow. 
Fair Ellender was buried by the church door, 
Sweet William was buried by her ; 
And out of her breast sprung a blood red rose 
And out of his a briar. 
They growed, they growed to the top of the church 
Till they could grow no higher, 
And there they tied a true love’s knot 
And the rose ran round the briar.

Mode 3. Fair Ellinor died with sorrow; 
Sweet William died with the wounds received 
And Ellinor died with sorrow. 
Sweet William was buried at the upper church yard 
And Ellinor was buried close by. 
Out of William’s grave spring a blood red rose 
And out of hers a briar. 
They grew, they grew to the top of the church 
Where could not grow any higher. 
They wound, they tied in a true love knot, 
The rose wrapped round the briar.

For the water’s drowned a gay lady.

And hooked this fair lady out of the sea.

And he blowed down to the Turkish land. 
The Turks they got him and so sadly used him, 
To love his life he was quite wearied. 
3 They bored a hole in his left shoulder 
And nailed him down unto a tree. 
They gave him nothing but bread and water, 
And bread and water but once a day. 
4 The Turks they had but one fair daughter, 
As fair a one as you should see. 
She stole the keys of the prison strong 
(or, She stole the jail keep from her father) 
And vowed Lord Bacon she would set free. 
5 She said: Have you got any land or living, 
Or have you any dwelling free? 
Would you give it all to a prince’s daughter 
If she would set you free? 
6 Then he says: I’ve got a land and living 
And I have got a dwelling free, 
And I'll give it all to you, (my),pretty creature, 
If you will do that thing for me.

And from her father stole a jail key. 
She opened the dungeon both deep and wide,

Then she took him to her master's (or father’s) cellar 
And drawed some of the best port wine, 
And drink a health, you pretty creature, 
I wish, Lord Bacon, you were mine. 
And then they drawed each other’s notes of love 
And seven years they were to stand. 
He vowed he’d marry no other woman 
Unless(or Until) she married some other man. 
Then she took him on to the sea-side 
And left him sailing over the main: 
Fare-ye-well, fare-ye-well, you pretty creature. 
O when shall I see you again? 
When seven years was passed and gone, 
And seven months and almost three, 
She gathered all her silks and rubies 
And vowed Lord Bacon she’d go and see. 
When she got to Lord Bacon’s hall 
She knocked so far below the ring. 
Who’s there, who’s there (or O yes, O yes), said the bold, proud 
porter, 
Who knock so hard fain would come in? 
Is this Lord Bacon’s hall, she said, 
Or is there any man within? 
O yes, O yes, said the bold, proud porter, 
This day has fetched him a young bride in. 
She says: Now you’ve married some other woman 
And I have married no other man, 
I wish I had my notes of love, 
Straight back I’d go to the Turkish land. 
She’s got a ring on every finger 
And on her middle one she’s got three, 
And gold around her neck a-plenty 
To buy all Cumberland of thee. 
Then up spoke the young bride’s mother, 
An angry spoken old thing was she, 
Saying: Would you quit my own fair daughter 
And take up with a Turkish lady ?

He said; You may take your daughter homé with you, 
For I'm sure she’s none the worse of me, 
For the prettiest thing stands there a-waiting 
That ever my two eyes did see. 
He took her by the lily-white hand 
And took her to her father’s cellar, 
And drawed some of the best port wine, 
Saying: Drink a health, you pretty creature, 
Who freed me from such a prison strong. 
He took her by the lily-white hand 
And gently led her to his hall, 
And changed her name from Pretty Nancy, 
And called her name, it was Noble Jane.

Come down, come down, dear mother they did say, 
Some clothing to put on. 
Saying: All of his merry, merry, merry maids 
Might as well to come as one. 
Fair Annie she had a silken towel 
Hanging on a silver pin, 
And she wiped out her watery eyes 
As she walked out and in. 
The rest of them drunk ale, beer and wine, 
But fair Annie she drunk cold well water 
To keep her spirits alive.

  Fair Annie 
There is a fair lady in our house, 
Before tomorrow morning she’ll be dead, 
We will call to our waiting-maids 
And have her taken out of town, 
A word or two, Lord Thomas, she did say, 
Before I go away. 
I wish my sons was seven greyhounds 
And I was a fox on the hill, 
And they might have longer (or more ) breath than I 
That they might worry me down. 
It’s who is your father dear, 
And who is your mother, 
And who is your brother dear 
And who is your sister? 
It’s King Henry he’s my father dear, 
Queen Chatry’s my own mother, 
Quince Dudley he’s my own brother dear 
And fair Annie she’s my own sister. 
If King Henry he’s your own father dear, 
Queen Chatry she’s your own mother, 
Quince Dudley your brother dear, 
I'll ensure I’m your own sister. 
We have seven ships all on the sea, 
They’re loaded to the brim, 
And five of them I’ll give to you 
And two will carry me home, 
And we’ll have Lord Thomas burned.

He bended over her soft pillow 
And gave her a kiss so sweet, 
But with a penknife in her right hand, 
She wounded him in full deep. 
Woe be, woe be, Lady Marg’ret, he cried, 
Woe be, woe be to thee, 
For don’t you see my own heart’s blood 
Come twinkling down my knee? 
She called unto a maid of hers: 
Keep a secret, keep a secret on me. 
All these fine robes on my body 
Shall always be to thee. 
One takened him by his long yellow hair 
And the other one by his feet, 
And they threw him into the well waters 
Which was so cool and deep. 
Lie there, lie there, love Henery, 
Till the flesh rots off your bones, 
And that pretty girl in Merry Green Lea 
Thinks long of your coming home. 
Up spoke, up spoke a pretty little parrot 
Exceeding on a willow tree: 
There never was a girl in Merry Green Lea 
He loved so well as thee. 
Come down, come down, my pretty little parrot, 
And sit upon my knee, 
And you shall have a cage of a pure, pure gold 
Instead of the willow tree. 
I won’t come down, nor I shan’t come down 
To sit upon your knee, 
For you have murdered your true love Henery, 
More sooner you would kill me. 
If I had my arrow in my hand, 
My bow on tuneful string, 
I'd shoot a dart that would win your heart, 
So you could no longer sing. 
If you had your arrow in your hand, 
Your bow on tuneful string, 
I'd take a flight and fly, fly away 
And tune my voice to sing.

Ir Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor 
It’s, O my son, I’d advise you at your own blessing 
To bring the brown girl home; 
For she has got both house and land 
And fair Ellender she has none. 
He dressed himself in the finest he had, 
His image it was broad ; 
And every town that he rode round 
They took him to be some lord. 
He rode up to fair Ellender’s gate 
And jangled at the ring— 
No one so ready as fair Ellen herself 
To rise and let him come in. 
Lord Thomas, Lord Thomas, she replied, 
What news have you brought for me ? 
I’ve come to ask you to my wedding, 
And that’s bad news for to hear. 
O mother, O mother, go roll a song, 
Go roll a song as one, 
Which had you rather, I’d go to Lord Thomas’ wedding, 
Or stay and tarry at home? 
It’s, O my daughter, I’d advise you at your own blessing 
To stay and tarry at home. 
I know I’ve got a-many a friend, 
Likewise many a foe, 
But if my death coffin was at my door, 
To Lord Thomas’ wedding I’d go. 
She dressed herself in the finest she had, 
Her image it was green ; 
And every town that she rode round 
They took her to be some queen. 
She rode up to Lord Thomas’s gate 
And knocked so clear it rung. 
No one so ready as Lord Thomas hisself 
For to rise and let her come in. 
He took her by her lily-white hand 
And led her in the hall, 
And seated her down by his bright side 
Amongst the ladies all.

12 Lord Thomas, Lord Thomas, is this your bride? 
I think she’s very brown ; 
When: you once might have had as fair a lady 
As ever the sun shined on. 
13 This brown girl she had a knife in her hand, 
And the blade both keen and sharp. 
’Twixt the long ribs and the short 
She pierced it through fair Ellender’s heart. 
14 Fair Ellen, fair Ellen, he replied, 
What makes you look so pale? 
Your cheeks were once the rosy red, 
And all your fine color has failed. 
15 Lord Thomas, Lord Thomas, she replied, 
Are you blind, or cannot you see? 
Or don’t you see my own heart’s blood 
Come twinkling down so free? 
16 Lord Thomas had a sword hung by his side 
With a blade both keen and sharp. 
He cut this brown girl’s head smooth off 
And cleaved the body apart. 
17 And then he pointed toward the floor 
With the point toward his heart. 
Did you ever see three own true loves 
Sudden in death to part? 
18 Go dig my grave both wide and deep 
And paint my coffin black, 
And put fair Ellender in my arms 
And the brown girl at my back.

2 No harm, no harm of Lady Marget, 
Nor she knows none by me, 
But before tomorrow morning at eight o’clock 
Lady Marget a bride shall see. 
3 Lady Marget was a-sitting in her bowing room 
Combing back her yellow hair, 
And she saw Sweet William and his new wedded bride, 
To church they did draw nigh.

And it’s down she stood her ivory comb 
And back she threw her hair. 
And it’s you may suppose and be very well assured 
Lady Marget was heard no more. 
The time has passed away and gone 
For all men to be asleep, 
And something appeared to Sweet William and his new wedded bride 
And stood up at their bed feet. 
Saying: How do you like your bed making ? 
Or how do you like your sheets? 
Or how do you like that new wedded bride 
That lies in your arms and sleeps ? 
Very well do I like my bed making, 
Much better do I like my sheets ; 
But the best of all is the gay lady 
That stands at my bed feet. 
The time was passed away and gone 
For all men to be awake. 
Sweet William he said he was troubled in his head 
By the dreams that he dreamed last night. 
Such dreams, such dreams cannot be true, 
I’m afraid they’re of no good, 
For I dreamed that my chamber was full of wild swine 
And my bride’s bed a-floating in blood. 
He called down his waiting-men, 
One, by two, by three, 
Saying: Go and ask leave of my new wedded bride 
If Lady Marget I mayn’t go and see. 
It’s he rode up to Lady Marget’s own bowing room, 
And he knocked so. clear at the ring ; 
And who was so ready as her own born brother 
For to rise and let him in. 
Is Lady Marget in her own bowing room? 
Or is she in her hall? 
Or is she high in her chambry 
Amongst her merry maids all? 
Lady Marget’s not in her bowing room, 
Nor neither is she in her hall; 
But she is in her long coffin, 
Lies pale against yon wall.

Unroll, unroll the winding-sheets, 
Although they’re very fine, 
And let me kiss them cold pale lips 
Just as often as they’ve kissed mine. 
Three times he kissed her ivory cheeks, 
And then he kissed her chin, 
And when he kissed them cold pale lips 
There was no breath within. 
Lady Marget she died like it might be to-day, 
Sweet William he died on tomorrow; 
Lady Marget she died for pure, true love, 
Sweet William he died for sorrow. 
Lady Marget were buried in yons churchyard, 
Sweet William was buried by her ; 
From her there sprung a red, red rose, 
From his there sprung a briar. 
They both growed up the old church wall 
Till, of course, could grow no higher, 
  And they met and they tied in a true love’s knot, 
For the rose rolled round the briar.

Dressed himself in blue ; 
Asked of his new wedded wife 
To ride one mile or two.

Tingled at the wire; 
There was none so ready to let them in 
But Lady Margret’s mother dear.

He kneeled and kissed her cold clay lips 
And died all at her feet.

And Willy close by her side ; 
And out of her heart sprang a red rose, 
And out of his a green briar.

‘They looped and tied in a true love knot 
The red rose and green briar.

Lady Marget she rose in the dead hour of night 
When they’se all a-lying at sleep, 
Lady Marget she rose in the dead hour of night 
And stood at his bed feet. 
Says, how do you like your bed? she says, 
And how do you like your sheet ? 
Or how do you like your brown broden bride 
That lays in your arms at sleep? 
Very well, very well do I like my bed, 
But better do I like my sheet, 
But better do I like a lady gay 
Who stands at my bed feet. 
Sweet William arose at the dead hour of night 
When they was all a-lying at sleep, 
Sweet William arose at the dead hour of night 
And tingled on the ring. 
‘There was none so ready as her seven brothers 
To rise and let him come in. 
O where is Lady Marget, Lady Marget? he cries, 
O where is Lady Marget? says he; 
For she’s a girl I always did adore 
And she stole my heart from me. 
Is she in her dower room ? 
Or is she in the hall? 
Or is she in her bed chambry 
Along with the merry maids all? 
She is not in her dower room, 
Nor neither in the hall, 
But she is in her cold, cold coffin 
With her pale face toward the wall. 
And when he pulled the milk-white sheets 
That were made of satin so fine: 
Ten thousand times you have kissed my lips 
And now, love, I’ll kiss thine. 
Three times he kissed her snowy white breast, 
Three times he kissed her cheek, 
But when he kissed her cold clay lips 
His heart was broke within.

11 What will you have at Lady Marget’s burying ? 
Will you have bread and wine? 
Tomorrow morning at eight o’clock 
The same shall be had at mine. 
12 They buried Lady Marget in our church-yard, 
And buried Sweet William by her ; 
And out of Sweet William’s breast sprung a blood-red rose, 
And out of Lady Marget’s a briar. 
13 They grew and grew to the top of the church, 
And they could grow no higher, 
And they tied a true love’s knot 
And lived and died together.

True, I am Lord Thomas’s wife 
Lord Thomas is not at home. 
The little foot-page was a-standing by, 
These words heareth he, 
And he licked to his heels and run. - 
He run, he run to the broken-down bridge, 
He bent to his breast and swum ; 
He swum, he swum to the other, other side, 
And he buckled up his shoes and he run. 
He run, he run to Lord Thomas’s gate 
And he dingled at the ring and it rung, 
And he dingled at the ring and it rung. 
What news, what news, my little foot-page? 
What news you’ve brought to me? 
Little Matthy Groves is at your house 
In the bed with the gay lady. 
If that be a lie you’ve brought to me 
And a lie I expect it to be, 
If there is e’er a green tree in these whole worlds 
A hangman you shall be. 
If that be the truth you’ve brought to me, 
And the truth I don’t expect it to be, 
You may wed my youngest daughter 
And you may have all I’ve got. 
Lord Thomas’s wife raised up about half a doze asleep. 
Lay still, lay still, little Matthy Groves says, 
Lay still I tell to thee, 
For it’s nothing, but your father’s little shepherd boy 
A-driving the wolves from the sheep. 
When little Matthy Groves did wake : 
Lord Thomas was at his feet. 
Rise up, rise up, Lord Thomas he says, 
And put your clothing on, 
For it never shall be known in old England 
That I slew a naked man. 
How can I rise up, he says, 
When I am afeard of my life ? 
For you have two good broad-edged swords 
And I have not so much as a knife.

12 True, I have two good broad swords 
They cost me deep in the purse. 
But you may have the very best one 
And you may have the first lick. 
13 The very first lick little Matthy Groves struck, 
He struck him across the head, 
And the very next lick Lord Thomas he struck, 
And it killed little Matthy Groves dead. 
14 He took his gay lady by the hand, 
And he led her up and down. 
He says: How do you like my blankets 
And how do you like my sheets? 
15 Well enough your blankets 
And well enough your sheets, 
But much better do I love little Matthy Groves 
Within my arms asleep. 
16 He took his gay lady by the hand 
And he pulled her on his knee, 
And the very best sword that he did have 
He split her head into twine (twain ).

She stepped up to little Matthy Groves 
And says: Come and go with me. 
I know by the rings that is on your hand 
You are Lord Dannel’s wife, 
That you are Lord Dannel’s wife. 
It makes no difference by the rings on my hand, 
Nor whose wife I am. 
My husband he’s not at home, 
He’s in some foreign land. 
Little foot Dannel (page?) was standing by, 
And he heard every word they were saying. 
If I live till broad daylight 
Lord Dannel shall know of this. 
He had about fifteen miles to go 
And ten of them he run; 
He swum till he came to the river 
And he held his breath and swum. 
He swum till he came to the grassy green grove, 
He sprang to his feet and he run ; 
He run till he came to Lord Dannel’s gate 
And he rang his bells and rung. 
Is my castle burning down, 
Or what is a-going to be done? 
No, your wife’s with anotlier man 
And both of their hearts are one. 
He gathered him up about fifty good men, 
And done it with a good will. 
He put his bugle to his mouth 
And blowed it with a shrill. 
How do you like my pillow, sir, 
How do you like my sheet, 
And how do you like the pretty little girl 
That lies in your arms asleep? 
Very well do I like your pillow, sir, 
Very well do I like your sheet, 
But very much better do I like the pretty little girl 
That lies in my arms asleep. 
Little Matthy Groves struck the very first lick, 
Which made Lord Dannel sore. 
Lord Dannel struck the very next lick 
And killed little Matthy on the floor.

And he led her through the hall.

ly one that I called my own,Hernamewas_ Bar-b’ra_ Al-len. 
I was taken sick, so very sick, 
Death on my brows were dwelling. 
I sent for the only one I loved, 
Her name was Barbara Allen. 
I am sick, so very sick, 
Death on my brows are dwelling, 
And none of the better will I ever be 
Till I get Barbara Allen. 
You remember the day, the bright groom day, 
When you passed your dranks so willing ? 
You gave your dranks to the ladies all, 
But you slighted Barbara Allen. 
I remember the day, the bright groom day, 
When I passed my dranks so willing. 
I gave my dranks to the ladies all, 
And my love to Barbara Allen. 
He turned his pale face to the wall 
And bursted out to crying. 
She turned her back on Sweet Willie’s bed 
And tipped downstairs a-smiling. 
I had not got but a mile from the place 
Till I heard his death-bells ringing, 
And as they rung they seemed to say: 
Hard-hearted Barbara Allen. 
I looked to the East, I looked to the West, 
I saw his coffin coming. 
Lay down, lay down his cold, clay corpse 
And let me gaze upon him.

g I went right home to my mother dear, 
Says: Make my death bed long and narrow. 
Sweet Willie has died for me to-day, 
T’ll die for him tomorrow. 
10 Sweet Willie he died like as to-day, 
And Barbara as tomorrow ; 
Sweet Willie died with the purest love, 
And Barbara died with sorrow. 
11 Sweet Willie was buried in one churchyard, 
And Barbara in another. 
A rose bud sprang from Willie’s grave, 
And a briar from Barbara Allen’s. 
12 They grew and they grew to the tall church door ; 
They could not grow any higher. 
They linked and tied in a true love’s knot 
And the rose wrapped around the briar.

And bursted out a-crying, 
Saying: Adieu to thee, adieu to all, 
Adieu to Barbara Allen. 
She had not more than reached the town, 
She heard the death bells tolling. 
She looked to the east, she looked to the west, 
And saw his pale face coming. 
Hand down, hand down that corpse of clay 
And let me gaze upon him. 
The more she gazed, the more she grieved, 
And she bursted out a-crying. 
Cursed, cursed, be my name, 
And cursed be my nature, 
For this man’s life I might have saved 
If I had done my duty. 
O mother, O mother, go make my bed, 
And make it long and narrow. 
Sweet William died for me to-day, 
And I'll die for him tomorrow. 
Sweet William died on Saturday night, 
Miss Barbara died on Sunday, 
The old lady died for the love of both, 
She died on Easter Monday. 
Sweet William was carried to one churchyard, 
Miss Barbara to another. 
A briar grew out of one of their graves, 
A rose tree out of the other. 
They grew as high as the old church top, 
They could not grow any higher. 
They bound and tied in a true love’s knot, 
For all true lovers to admire.

He sent his servants after her 
And for his sake he sent them: 
My master’s sick and about to die 
And for your sake he’s dying. 
Slowly, slowly, she got up, 
And went away unto him, 
Saying: Kind Sir, 
You are pale looking. 
O yes, my love, I’m mighty sick, 
A kiss or two 
From your sweet lips 
Would save me from this dying. 
He turned his pale cheeks toward the wall; 
She turned her back upon him, 
Saying: Kind sir, you’re none the better of me, 
If your heart’s blood was a-spilling. 
Slowly, slowly she gets up 
And goes away and leaves him. 
She hadn’t rode but a mile in town, 
She heard his death bells ringing. 
They rung so clear unto her ear 
That she commence lamenting. 
She looked to the East and she looked to the West, 
She saw his cold corpse coming. 
Go bring him here as cold as clay 
And let me look upon him. 
Go and tell to my parents most dear, 
Who would not let me have him. 
Go and tell to the rest of my kin folk, 
Who caused me to forsake him. 
Sweet Willie was buried on Saturday night, 
Barbara was buried on Sunday. 
Both of the mothers died for them, 
Was buried on Easter Monday. 
Sweet Willie was buried in the new churchyard, 
Barbara was buried close beside him. 
A red rose grew from sweet Willie’s breast, 
A briar grew from her feet.

And Barbary close by the side of him. 
At the head of Sweet William’s grave there sprung a red rose 
And Barbary Allen’s was a briar. 
14 They grew, they grew to the top of the church 
And they could not grow any higher. 
They leaned and tied in a true lover’s knot 
And the rose hanged on to the briar.

Out of sweet William’s grave grew a green, red rose, 
Out of Barbara Ellen’s a briar.

I’ve come here to win your neck 
From yon high gallows tree.

2 Away to old England I must go, 
King Edwards has sent for me. 
Up spoke young Jimmy Scot himself 
As he sat by his knees : 
Five hundred of my best brave men 
Shall bear you company. 
3 The very first town that they rode through, 
The drums, the fifes, they played ; 
The very next town that they rode through, 
The drums they beat all around. 
4 They rode, they rode to King Edwards’s gate, 
They dingled at the ring ; 
But who did he spy but his own sweetheart 
And her footspade ( footpage ) a-peeping down. 
5 I can’t come down, dear Johnny, she says, 
For Poppy has scolded me. 
I’m forced to wear a ball and chain 
Instead of the ivory. 
6 Is this young Jimmy Scot himself, 
Or Jimmy Scotland’s king ? 
Or is the father of that bastard child 
From Scotland just come in?

  Johnie Scot 
I’m not young Jimmy Scot, 
Nor Jimmy Scotland’s king ; 
But I am young Johnie Scot himself 
From Scotland just come in. 
There is a taveren in our town 
That’s killed more lords than one, 
And before the sun rises tomorrow morning 
A dead man you shall be. 
The taveren flew over young Johnie’s head 
As swift as any bird ; 
He pierced the taveren to the heart 
With the point of his broad sword. 
He whipped King Edwards and all his men, 
And the king he liked to have swung. 
T’ll make your girl my gay lady 
And her child the heir of my land.

And she drug him from wall to wall, 
She drug him to a great, deep well, 
Where none could hear his call. 
She placed a penknife to his heart,

This old man went out to his plough, 
To see the old devil fly over his mow. 
The old man cries out: I am undone, 
For the devil has come for my oldest son. 
It’s not your oldest son I want, 
But your damned old scolding wife I’ll have. 
He took the old woman upon his back, 
And off he went with her packed in a sack. 
He packed her back in one corner of hell, 
Saying: I hope the old devil will use you well. 
Twelve little devils came walking by, 
Then she up with her foot and kicked eleven in the fire. 
The odd little devil peeped over the wall, 
Saying: Take her back, daddy, or she will kill us all. 
She was six months going and eight coming back, 
And she called for the mush she left in the pot, 
The old man lay sick in the bed. 
With an old pewter pipe she battered his head. 
The old man cries out: I am to be cursed, 
She has been to hell and come back worse.

-P-A-G-E-178
Sung by Mrs. Moorz, Rabun Co., Ga. 
May 2, 1909. (Tune not noted.) 
There was a young doctor, from London he came, 
He courted a damsel called Sarah by name. 
Her wealth it was more than the king could possess ; 
Her beauty it was more than her wealth at the best. 
O Sarah, O Sarah, O Sarah, said he, 
I am truly sorry that we can’t agree, 
But if your heart don’t turn unto love, 
I fear that your beauty my ruin will prove. 
O no, I don’t hate you, and no other man, 
But to say that I like you is more than I can. 
So now you may stop with all your discourse, 
For I never ‘low to have you unless I am forced. 
After twenty-eight weeks had done gone and passed, 
The beautiful damsel she fell sick at last. 
She sent for the young man she once did deny, 
For to come and see her before she did die. 
Am I the young man that you sent for here? 
Or am I the young man that you loved so dear? 
You’re the only young doctor can kill or can cure, 
And without your assistance I’m ruined, I’m sure. 
O Sarah, O Sarah, O Sarah, said he, 
Don’t you remember you once slighted me? 
You slighted, deviled me, you slighted me with scorn, 
And now I’ll reward you for things past and gone. 
Forget and forgive, O lover, said she, 
And grant me some longer a time for to live. 
O no, I won’t, Sarah, enduring your breath, 
But I’ll dance on your grave when you lay in cold death. 
Gold rings off her finger ends she pulled three, 
Saying: Take these and wear them when you dance on me. 
Ten thousand times over my folly I see. 
Now pretty Sarah is dead, as we all may suppose. 
To some other rich lady willed all her fine clothes. 
At last she made her bed in the wet and cold clay; 
Her red, rosy cheeks is moulderin’ away.

3 They rose up early the next morning,

And upon this young man they both insisted 
For him to go along with them. 
4 They wandered over the hills and mountains 
And through a many of a place unknown, 
Till at last they came to a lonesome valley 
And there they killed him dead alone.

Their sister ask for the servant man. 
Saying: We lost him on a game of hunting ; 
No more of him it’s could we find.

Saying: Your brother killed me rough and cruel 
All wallowed in a score of blood.

Said: You are the darling bosom friend of mine.

As to force your sweet love away, 
One grave shall preserve us both together, 
As long as I have breath I will stay with you.

Her brothers ask her where she’d been. 
O hold your tongue, you deceitful villains, 
For one alone you both shall hang.

To jump in a boat and a-finally leave. 
The wind did blow and the waves came o’er them;

He pierced her heart and the blood it did flow, 
And into the grave her fair body did throw.

He left nothing but small birds to make their sad mourn. 
6 He entered his ship all upon the salt sea so wide, 
And swore by his Maker he’d sail to the other side. 
Whilst he was sailing on in his full heart’s content, 
The ship sprung a leak and to the bottom she went. 
7 Whilst he was lying there all in his sad surprise, 
He saw pretty Polly all in a gore of blood.

There’s a debt to the devil that you’re bound to pay.

And the blood from her body like a fountain did flow. 
7 He covered her all up, straight home he returned, 
Left no one to mourn but the small birds alone, 
And pled forth the paymount for to plough the whole sea. 
8 The captain then summoned his whole-y ship crew. 
He said: My brave boys, I’m afraid some of you 
Have murdered some damsel before we came away, 
That will cause us to be hate upon the whole sea. 
g And he that did do it the truth he’ll deny. 
We'll hang with God in yon gallows so high; 
But he that confess it his life we’ll not take, 
But we’ll leave him on the very next island we’ll meet.

3 As they had been to church and returning home again, 
Out slipped her cruel old father and seven armed men. 
Saying: Since you are determined to be the soldier’s wife, 
Way down in the valley I will surely take his life. 
4 O, says the little soldier, I have no time to tattle; 
I am here in this world in no fix for battle. 
But he drew his pistol and sword and caused them to rattle, 
And the lady held the horse while the soldier fought the battle. 
5 The first one he come to he run him through the main, 
And the next one he come to he served him the same. 
Let’s run, says the rest, I’ll see we'll all be slain, 
To fight the valiant soldier I see it all in vain. 
6 Up step this old man, speaking mighty bold ; 
You shall have my daughter and a thousand pound of gold. 
Fight on, says the lady, the pile is too small. 
O stop, says the old man, and you shall have it all.

He picked up the chest and he carried it along. 
But he had not got more’n half through the town, 
Till the weight of the little tailor boy made him lie it down. 
6 He opened the lid and says to them all:

And she vowed in a tusk, 
Saying what she had said 
Had been through a joke. 
My green beds they are empty 
And have been all this week, 
Awaiting for you and daughter Polly 
To take a pleasant sleep. 
It’s you and your daughter Polly 
Both deserves to: be burned, 
And before I lodge here 
I would lodge in a barn. 
Be careful of your money, boys, 
And lay it up in store, 
And when you have no money, boys, 
You're turned out of doors.

She step-ped up to him, these words she did say: 
Why wasn’t you at the wedding, the wedding to-day? 
Why wasn’t you at the wedding to wait upon the Squire 
And to give to him his bride? 
3 Back to this lady the farmer replied: 
I will not give her up for I love her too well. 
This pleased this young lady in hearing him so bold. 
She gave to him her glove that was covered in gold. 
4 I picked it up as I came along, 
As I came a-hunting with my dog and my gun; 
Returning back home with her heart all filled with love, 
Put out the new oration that she had lost her glove. 
And if any man will find it and bring it to me,

pre-vent the day Of mar-riage,they sent this poor youngman a - way. 
2 O now he is gone for to serve his king, 
It grieves this lady to think of the thing. 
She dressed herself up in rich merchant’s shape, 
She wandered away her true love for to seek. 
3 As she was a-travelling one day, almost night, 
A couple of Indians appeared in her sight, 
And as they drew nigh her, O this they did say: 
Now we are resolved to take your life away. 
4 She had nothing by her but a sword to defend, 
These barbarous Indians murder intend. 
But in the contest one of them she did kill 
Which caused the other for to leave the hill. 
5 As she was a-sailing over the tide, 
She spied a city down by the sea-side. 
She saw her dear porter a-walking the street, 
She made it her business her true love to meet. 
6 How do you do, sir, where do you belong ? 
I’m a-hunting a diamond and I must be gone. 
He says: I’m no sailor, but if you want a man, 
For my passage over I’ll do all I can. 
7 Then straightway they both went on board. 
Says the captain to the young man: What did you do with 
your sword? 
On account of long travel on him she did gaze. 
Once by my sword my sweet life did save.

Then straightway to London their ship it did steer, 
Such utter destruction to us did appear. 
It was all out on main sea, to our discontent, 
Our ship sprung a leak and to the bottom she went. 
There was four and twenty of us contained in one boat, 
Our provision gave out and our allowance grew short. 
Our provisions gave out and death drawing nigh, 
Says the captain: Let's cast lots for to see who shall die. 
Then down on a paper each man’s name was wrote, 
Each man ran his venture, each man had his note. 
Amongst the whole ship’s crew this maid’s was the least, 
It was her lot to die for to feed all the rest. 
Now, says the captain, let’s cast lots and see 
Amongst the ship’s crew who the butcher will be. 
It’s the hardest of fortune you ever did hear, 
This maid to be killed by the young man, her dear. 
He called for a basin for to catch the blood 
While this fair lady a-trembling stood, 
Saying: Lord, have mercy on me, how my poor heart do bleed 
To think I must die, hungry men for to feed. 
Then he called for a knife his business to do. 
She says: Hold your hand for one minute or two. 
A silk merchant’s daughter in London I be; 
Pray see what I’ve come to by loving of thee. 
Then she showed a ring betwixt them was broke. 
Knowing the ring, with a sigh he spoke: 
For the thoughts of your dying my poor heart will burst, 
For the hopes of your long life, love, I will die first. 
Says the captain: If you love her you'll make amend, 
But the fewest of number will die for a friend, 
So quicken the business and let it be done. 
But while they were speaking they all heard a gun. 
Says the captain: You may now all hold your hand, 
We all hear a gun, we are near ship or land. 
In about half an hour to us did appear 
A ship bound for London which did our hearts cheer. 
It carried us safe over and us safe conveyed, 
And then they got married this young man and maid.

With money in her hand,

To convey herself away. 
9 Before you step on board, sir, 
Your name I’d like to know. 
She smiled all over her countenance: 
They call me Jack Monroe. 
1o Your waist is light and slender, 
Your fingers neat and small, 
Your cheeks too red and rosy 
To face the cannon ball. 
11 I know my waist is light and slender, 
My fingers are neat and small, 
But I never change my countenance 
To face the cannon ball. 
12 The wars being over, 
She hunted all around 
Among the dead and wounded, 
And her darling boy she found. 
13 She picked him all up in her arms 
And carried him to the town, 
And sent for a physician 
Who quickly healed his wounds. 
14 This couple they got married, 
So well did they agree. 
This couple they got married, 
And why not you and me?

5 As he come along his arms were shining bright, 
The most of his thoughts were his own heart’s delight. 
When her old mother saw him she wrung her hands and cried, 
Said her daughter loved him dearly and for his sake she died. - 
6 Where does her grave lie, does this lie here? 
If this does lie here, pray put me by her side. 
Come all you young people and pity poor me, 
Pity my misfortune and sad misery.

Just like a clever fellow, 
I told her that the plums and grapes were ripe, 
Yes, they were fine and mellow. 
There’s something else to betray us, 
My father dear is on his way, 
And he’ll be sure to see us. 
Till he gets out of sight, sir, 
It’s then we'll go to yonders grove 
And spend one happy hour. 
And on the top he stopped, sir, 
And every jerk he tore his shirt, 
And on the top he stopped, sir. 
She looked so neat and active. She says: My dear, my dearest dear, 
The tree was rough, he climbed so tough, 
As she went trippling over the plains, 
And there he sot in the top of the tree 
Almost raving distracted.

Sparking is pleasure, 
Parting is grief, 
And a false-hearted lover 
Is worse than a thief. 
A thief will only rob you, 
Will take what you have, 
And a false-hearted lover 
Will take you to the grave. 
The grave will only decay you, 
Will turn you to the dust. 
There is not one girl out of a hundred 
A poor boy can trust. 
They will tell you they love you 
To give your heart ease, 
And as soon as you back up on them 
They’ll court who they please. 
It’s a-raining, it’s a-hailing, 
The moon it gives no light, 
Your horses can’t travel 
This dark, lonesome night. 
Go put up your horses, 
Feed them some hay ; 
Come sit down here by me, love, 
As long as you stay. : 
My horses are not hungry, 
Won’t eat your hay, 
So farewell, my little darling, 
T’'ll feed on my way.

On the mountain so high, :

Your parents don’t like me because I am poor, 
They say I’m not worthy of entering their door. 
5 Some day they will rue it, but they will rue it in vain, 
For love it is a killing, a tormenting pain. 
I must go and leave you to see you no more. 
I left her a-weeping on the new river shore. 
6 I can love little, or I can love long, 
I can love an old sweetheart till a new one comes on; 
I can hug and I can kiss them and prove to them kind, 
I can turn my back upon them and also my mind.

They'll first appear and then they’re gone. 
3 They'll tell to you some pleasing story, 
They'll declare to you they are your own; 
Straightway they’ll go and court some other 
And leave you here in tears to mourn.

And I had wings and I could fly ; 
Straight after my true love I would follow, 
When they’d be talking I’d be by. 
5 But I am no little swallow, 
I have no wings, nor I can’t fly, 
And after my true love I can’t follow, 
And when they’re talking I’ll set and cry.

Turns out to be a pretty day.

I took the opportunity 
  Of writing of leti ters to my most dear, 
Not an answer could I hear. 
I rode up to her father’s hall, 
Where my true love I did call. 
Her father answered and thus replied: 
My daughter’s married and you must be denied. 
She married to a richer life, 
You’ll have to seek another wife. 
Cruel be all gold and silver 
And all true love that won’t prove true. 
They will occasion you to swear 
And break the heart of a nice young man. 
I'll go where the fife and the drums do play, 
Where the music ceases night or day, 
Live on the sea till the dear day 
And split the waves with bullets fly. 
O Willie dear, lay still on shore 
And don’t go about the rigging o’er. 
There’s girls in the town more fair than I, 
O Willie, don’t go where the bullets fly.

Don’t speak so hard of the female kind. 
O if you had gold you might have part, 
But as I have none you have gained my heart; 
You have gained it all with a free good will, 
So keep my vows and hold them still.

If you go to get married, don’t hasten it on, 
And don’t you get married till you’re full twenty-one ; 
And don’t you get married till you find your love set, 
Then marry some good girl your love won’t forget. 
Come all you young gentlemen who want to be smart, 
Don’t place your affections on a smiling sweetheart. 
She’s dancing before you some favours to gain, 
Then turns her back on you with scorn and disdain. 
When a man’s married he ain’t his own man, 
He must rove through the country and live as he can. 
He’s lost that sweet apparel, the flowers of life, 
For selling his freedom to buy him a wife. 
But when a man’s single he can live at his ease, 
He can rove through the country and do as he please; 
He can rove through the country and live at his will, 
Kiss Polly, kiss Betsy, and he is the same still. 
Just pour out another bowl, boys, we’ll drink bumpers round. 
We'll drink to the poorest, if they’re to be found ; 
We'll drink to the single with the greatest success, 
Likewise to the married and wish them no less.

The answer was: She is not here, 
I’ve no such in my keeping. 
4 Her voice from the roof above 
Came straightway to the window. 
O love, O love, it’s I’d be yours, 
But locks and bolts doth hinder. 
5 O passion flew, my sword I drew, 
All in that room I entered ; 
O passion flew, my sword I drew, 
All in that room I entered. 
6 I took my sword in my right hand, 
And my love all in the other. 
Come all young men that love like me, 
Fight on and take another. 
7 Her uncle and three other men 
Straightway after me did follow, 
Saying: Leave this room, you villain, you, 
Or in your heart’s blood you shall wallow.

Saying: I’ll go to William and give him relief. 
When William saw Nancy standing by his bedside, 
Saying: There is the pretty girl who might have been my bride. 
3 She is lawfully married, I’ll die for her sake. 
She linked her arms round him and felt his heart break. 
Sweet William died love-sick, I hope he’s at rest; 
And Nancy she fainted and died on his breast. 
4 Come all you old and married men, come sit down by me, 
And you that are bachelors, take warning by me. 
When you go a-courting, don’t you court slow, 
Don’t court no other till she tells you No. 
5 I courted handsome Nancy till a fortune I won, 
And to see some other straightway I did run. 
At a chief of my practice, at a doubt of my woe, 
I lost handsome Nancy by courting too slow,

They had no child but me, 
But my mind was bent on roving, 
With them I couldn’t agree. ~ 
3 There was a noble gentleman 
In yonder town drew nigh; 
He had one only daughter, 
On her I cast my eye. 
4 She was young and tall and handsome, 
Most beautiful and fair ; 
There wasn’t a girl in that whole town 
With her I could compare. 
5 I told her my intention ; 
It was to cross the main. 
It’s, love, will you prove faithful 
Till I return again? 
6 She said she would prove faithful 
Till death did prove unkind. 
We kissed, shook hands and parted, 
I left my girl behind. 
7 It’s when I left old Ireland, 
To Scotland I was bound. 
I'll march from Zion to me 
To view the country round. 
8 The girls were fair and plenty there 
And all to me proved kind, 
But the dearest object of my heart 
Was the girl I left behind.

When the post-boy met me there. 
10 He handed me a letter 
That gave me to understand 
That the girl I left behind me 
Had wedded to another man. 
11 I advanced a little further, 
I found the news quite true ; 
I turned myself all round about, 
I knew not what to do.

2 And when I got to London a fair lady met me there 
And offered me in wages to live with her one year; 
And offered me in wages fine house and fine land, 
If I’d give consent and marry her, she’d be at my command. 
3 I said: Dear Miss, excuse me, I cannot wed you both, 
I’m promised to pretty Polly and bounded with an oath. 
Then Miss she grew angry and from me fled away, 
A-swearing by all her vengeance she’d be my overthrow. 
4 I stepped out one evening to take the pleasant air, 
I find Miss in the garden, a-viewing the lilies fair. 
The gold rings on her fingers, as she come past by me, 
She dropped them in my pocket, and for it I must die. 
5 They put me on a east bound train one cold December day, 
And every station I rode through I heard the people say: 
Yonder goes.a young man, in iron chains he’s bound, 
For some crime or other he’s bound for Charlestown.

6 Here is my dear old father, he’s pleading at the bar, 
Likewise my aged mother pulling out grey locks of hair, 
A-pulling out those old grey locks, the tears come trinkling down. 
Son, O son, what have you done? You’re bound for Charlestown. 
7 Then I was executed and on the gallows hung, 
My friends and my relations all round me they did mourn, 
And my father and my mother all round me they did cry. 
Farewell, my dear old parents, now I am bound to die.

He’ll take a strange girl upon his knee, 
And he'll tell her things that he won’t tell me. 
3 It troubles me so, and I’ll tell you for why, 
Because she has more gold than I, 
But it’s gold will melt and silver will fly, 
But mine is love that will never die. 
4 I went upstairs to make my bed, 
To lay me down to rest my head. 
My old mother came to my bedside, 
Saying: What’s the matter with my child? 
5 O mother, O mother, you do not kr.ow 
Of the grief and pain and sorrow. 
Go bring me a chair and I'll sit down, 
With pen and ink I’ll write it down. 
6 At the end of each line I dropped a tear, 
At the end of every word cried: O my dear. 
My old father he came home, saying : 
Where has my daughter gone? 
7 He went upstairs and the door he broke, 
And there he found her hanging to a rope. 
He took his knife and cut her down, 
And on her breast a note he found.

Her old father followed after them with seven armed men. 
Overtaken was poor Riley with his lovely Polly Anne. 
3 And then next morning early the jailor’s son come down, 
Saying: Rise up, William Riley, your trial is at hand. 
Before yon bunch of jurors your trial you must stand. 
I’m afraid you'll suffer sorely by your lovely Polly Anne. 
4 Then up spoke an aged lawyer, these words he did say: 
To hang a man for love, boys, I call it murder-y, 
To hang a man for love, boys, ’tis murder you plainly see. 
O spare the life of Riley, and let him leave his country. 
5 Then up spoke her old father, these words he did say: 
He’s taken from me gold watches, he’s taken from me gold rings, 
He’s took a silver brooch pin, ’twas worth a thousand pounds. 
I'll have the life of Riley, or spend ten thousand pounds. 
6 There is a ring amonst the rest I’ll have you for to wear. 
The ring has forty diamonds and plaited with my hair. 
O when you wear it, Riley, wear it on your right hand, 
And think of my poor broken heart when you’re in foreign land.

They were all seated round the table, 
And every one should sing a song ; 
And the very first one was her old true lover, 
And this is the song that he sung to the bride. 
If any one should ask the reason 
Why I put on my strange attire, 
I’m crossed in love, that is the reason, 
I've lost my only heart’s delight. 
4 But I’ll put on my strange attire, 
And I will wear it for a week or two, 
Till I change my old love for the new. 
But how can you lie with your head on another man’s pillow, 
When you proved your love so late to me? 
To bear it any longer she was not able, 
And down at her bridegroom’s feet she fell. 
There one thing I do desire, 
Perhaps you all will grant me; 
That is this night to lie by my mother, 
And all that love me lie with thee. 
And this request being soon was granted, 
With watery eyes they went to bed. 
So-early, so early, as they rose in the morning, 
They found the young bride lying dead.

And scarcely fifteen years of age.

The Drummer and His Wife 
He went to feed the speckled pig 
That lay up in the sty, sty. 
He hit his head agin’ the beam, 
And the blood came trinkling down. 
He went to churn the churn of cream 
That set up in the frame, frame; 
And he forgot the pot of fat; 
And it went up in the flame. 
He went to feed the speckled hen, 
For fear she would go stray, stray ; 
And he forgot the spool of thread 
She spun was to-day. 
The drummer told his wife that-she could do more in one day 
Than he could do in three, three, 
And if she’d only take her place again, 
He’d never grumble no more.

She’d court all night and sleep next day.

If I was a young man I’d have two; 
If one proved fickle and chanced for to go, 
I'd have a new string to my bow. 
3 Hi, says ‘the little leather-winged bat, 
I will tell you the reason that, 
The reason that I fly in the night 
Is because I lost my heart’s delight,

T’ll tell you how to gain her love. 
Court her night and court her day; 
Never give her time to say ‘O nay’.

She proved fickle and from me fled, 
And ever since then my head’s been red.

If I had a hen I’d feed like a pig; 
But here I sit on a frozen stake, 
Which causes my poor heart to ache. 
7 Hi, says the swallow sitting on a barn, 
Courting, I think, is no harm. 
I pick my wings and sit up straight, 
And hope every young man will choose his mate. 
8 Hi, says the hawk unto the crow, 
If you ain’t black then I don’t know. 
Ever since old Adam was born, 
You've been accused of stealing corn. 
g Hi, says the crow unto the hawk, 
I understand your great big talk. 
You'd like to pounce and catch a hen, 
But I hope the farmer will shoot you then, 
1o Hi, says the robin with a squirm, 
I wish I had a great big worm; 
I would fly away into my nest; 
I have a wife I think is the best.

As he went over to Ben Beard’s 
Expecting her courtship to come on, 
As the courtship it came on, 
Sir Jane says: Harm, have you hoed out your corn? 
Harm he answered with a quick reply: 
Yes, Sir Jane, I’ve laid her by. 
If any more it’s all in vain, 
For I don’t think it will make one grain. 
Sir Jane says: Harm, if you can’t make bread, 
I am very sorry you asked me to wed. 
Single I am, single I’ll remain; 
A lazy man I’ll never maintain. 
He went to the fence and he peeped in, 
The weeds and grass was up to his chin, 
The weeds and grass it grew so high, 
It made poor Harm Link weep and cry. 
In July it was ankle high, 
In September he laid it by, 
In October there came a great frost. 
A sight to see the corn that Harm Link lost.

In a note (Journal of the Folk-Song Society, iv., 106), Miss Barbara M. Cra’ster argues that 
this ballad and Clerk Colvill are complementary or, rather, that they are both descended from 
a more complete form such as that given in Journal of the Folk-Song Society, iii., 299. In the 
usual form in which Giles Collins is sung (e.g. the versions given in the text), no reason is given 
for Giles’s death, and this, of course, robs the song of its point. This omission is supplied in 
the version above cited, but so far has not been found in any other variant.

“Taverin” in the text is “Italian,” “Tailliant,” “Itilian,” or simply “champion” in 
other versions. Child throws light upon the incident by quoting a story (Revd. Andrew 
Hall's Interesting Roman Antiquities recently Discovered in Fife, 1823, p. 216) in which James 
Macgill of Lindores is offered a pardon by Charles II. upon condition of his fighting an Italian 
gladiator or bully. In the contest which ensues, “the Italian actually leaped over his opponent 
as if he would swallow him alive, but in attempting to do this a second time Sir James run his 
sword up through him and then called out, ‘I have spitted him; let them roast him who will.’”” 
A similar story is related of the Breton seigneur Les Aubrays of St. Brieux, who is ordered by 
the French King to undertake a combat with his wild Moor (Luzel’s Poésies populaires de la

Mrs. Sands'’s song is a shortened and condensed version of the broadside ballad—which 
consists of 56 stanzas, i.e. 224 lines! In the original story, Jemmy’s love for Nancy of Yarmouth 
is opposed by her father, who, however, promises his consent to their marriage if Jemmy 
returns safely from an ocean voyage.. Jemmy accordingly sails for the Barbadoes where his 
“comely features” attract the attention, and arouse the love, of the “‘ Perbadus (i.e. Barbadoes) 
lady whose fortune was great.’’ Jemmy is constant to his first love, and the Perbadus lady, 
thwarted in her desires, commits suicide. Nancy’s father, hearing that Jemmy is returning, 
writes to his friend the boatswain and promises him a handsome reward if he ‘‘the life of young 
Jemmy would end.’ The boatswain accepts the bribe and “tumbles” the unfortunate Jemmy 
“into the deep.” The conclusion of the story is correctly given in the text.

In the version given by Logan, the hero is present at the siege of Carthagena. If this is 
the correct reading, the ballad must refer to Admiral Vernon’s expedition to the West Indies 
in 1793.

No. 87. John Hardy. 
American variant:—Journal of American Folk-Lore, vi., 134 (with tune). 
This is clearly a modern production despite the “sequence of relatives” and the employ- 
ment of the two beautiful stanzas (Nos. 7 and 8) from “The Lass of Roch Royal” (see Note to 
No. 61). No better proof could be adduced of the way in which the mountain singers have 
assimilated and acquired the technique-of balladry.

The stanza At, Bq and C2 is evidently a reminiscence of a similar verse of ‘Young Hunt- 
ing,” from which this ballad has probably been derived. Compare the tunes'A, B and E 
with those of “The Daemon Lover’’ (No. 29).- The tune of C and some of its words are 
reminiscent of ‘‘The True Lover’s Farewell’’ (No. 61).

Texts with tunes:—Christie’s Traditional Ballad Airs, i., 277. 
“Pretty Girl of Derby O,” is the name of the air to which Thomas Moore, under the 
mistaken impression that it was an Irish tune, set his “‘Evelyn’s Bower.” In the set given by 
Ford, cited above, the scene is laid in Derby, but in Christie’s version and the two variants 
noted by Gavin Greig Fyvie is substituted for Derby.

  PREFACE 
During the past few months the Office of the Surgeon General 
of the Army and the National Research Council have been be- 
sieged with requests for information concerning the methods 
of psychological examining and for the printed materials used 
in the United States Army. To meet this demand it has seemed 
advisable to prepare this little book, which, in addition to the 
“Examiner’s Guide,” presents information concerning the re- 
sults of psychological examining in the Army and indications of 
the possible uses of similar methods in education and industry. 
The book has been prepared under the editorial direction of 
Majors Clarence S. Yoakum and Robert M. Yerkes, who, in 
codperation with other members of the psychological staff of 
the Surgeon General’s Office, selected the various materials and 
decided about the mode of presentation. The editors are re- 
sponsible for the material of certain of the chapters, and they 
have indicated the responsibility of others wherever possible. 
It has been arranged that the royalty from Army Mental 
Tests shall be paid to the treasurer of the National Research 
Council for the support of psychological research. 
The instructions originally printed in the “ Examiner’s Guide” 
for the Stanford-Binet scale and the Point Scale have been 
omitted from this volume because of copyright restrictions, but 
these materials are available in books previously published. 
A detailed and complete account of the methods and results 
of psychological examining in the Army is in course of publica- 
tion in the Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences, 
Washington.

INTRODUCTION * 
The human factors in most practical situations have been 
neglected largely because of our consciousness of ignorance and 
our inability to control them. Whereas engineers deal con- 
stantly with physical problems of quality, capacity, stress and 
strain, they have tended to think of problems of human conduct 
and experience either as unsolved or as insoluble. At the same 
time there has existed a growing consciousness of the practical 
significance of these human factors and of the importance of 
such systematic research as shall extend our knowledge of them 
and increase our directive power. 
The great war from which we are now emerging into a civil- 
ization in many respects new has already worked marvelous 
changes in our points of view, our expectations and practical 
demands. Relatively early in this supreme struggle, it became 
clear to certain individuals that the proper utilization of man 
power, and more particularly of mind or brain power, would 
assure ultimate victory. The war demanded of us the speedy 
mobilization of our military machine and in addition the or- 
ganization and training of an immense supplementary armed 
force, the manufacture of ordnance and munitions of war in 
well-nigh unimaginable quantities, the construction of ships, 
motor transports, and of varieties of rolling stock in vast num- 
bers. All this had to be done in the least possible time. Never 
Sefore in the history of civilization was brain, as contrasted 
with brawn, so important; never before, the proper placement 
and utilization of brain power so essential to success.

viii INTRODUCTION 
  Our War Department, nerved to exceptional risks by the 
stern necessity for early victory, saw and immediately seized 
its opportunity to develop various new lines of personnel work. 
Among these is numbered the psychological service. Great 
will be our good fortune if the lesson in human engineering 
which the war has taught is carried over directly and effectively 
into our civil institutions and activities. 
Scarcely had war been declared by our country before the 
psychologists were brought together in a plan to make their 
professional knowledge, technique, and experience useful in the 
emergency. In April, 1917, the American Psychological Asso- 
ciation appointed numerous committees to study the situation 
and prepare for action. At the same time a Committee for 
Psychology was organized by the National Research Council. 
Thus it happened that from the outset American psychologists 
acted unitedly, whereas their professional colleagues in France 
and Great Britain served individually wherever they could 
discover opportunity. The Committee for Psychology of the 
National Research Council has continued active over a period 
of nearly two years. Almost all of the psychological contribu- 
tions which the United States has made to the war are either 
directly or indirectly due to the efforts or the support of this 
body, the work of which has been carried on through confer- 
ences, sub-committees, or military appointees in the army and 
the navy. 
In order that the psychological examining of the soldier may 
be seen in its proper setting, the various chiefly significant lines 
of psychological service will be enumerated and briefly char- 
acterized.* 
Under the Adjutant General, the Committee on Classification 
of Personnel in the Army, which was originally organized by a

branches of the service will be found in the “Report of the Psychology 
Committee of the National Research Council,” Psychological Review,

INTRODUCTION ix 
group of psychologists who were at the time serving as members 
of the Committee for Psychology of the National Research 
Council or of committees of the American Psychological Asso- 
ciation for the furtherance of the military service, developed 
and introduced throughout the army methods of classifying 
and assigning enlisted men in accordance with. occupational 
and educational qualifications and also methods of rating officers 
for appointment and promotion. The services of this Commit- 
tee, to the work of which the War Department dedicated nearly 
a million dollars, ultimately touched and more or less pro- 
foundly modified almost every important aspect of military 
personnel. 
To the Signal Corps, and subsequently to the Division of 
Military Aéronautics, psychological service was rendered in 
connection with measurement of the effects of high altitude 
and also in the selection and placement of men. Numerous im- 
portant methods new or adapted, were introduced in this service 
by groups of psychologists whose primary concern was improved 
placement and the proper utilization and protection of the 
flyer. 
The Committee for Psychology promoted effectively interest 
in measures for the control and improvement of both military 
and civilian morale. The interest and persistent activity of its 
members ultimately resulted in the organization of a Morale 
Branch within the General Staff of the Army. At various times 
as many as twenty-five officers and enlisted men trained in 
military psychology were engaged in the conduct of practical 
morale work. 
For the Division of Military Intelligence psychological 
methods were devised or adapted to assist in the selection, 
placement and effective training of scouts and observers and in 
addition service of minor importance was rendered in numerous 
training camps. 
In response to requests from the Chemical Warfare Service, 
psychological problems presented by the gas mask were studied 
Boe a
-P-A-G-E-10
  x INTRODUCTION 
and the major recommendations resulting from these investiga- 
tions were embodied in the latest improved form of mask. 
The psychological problems either partially or completely 
solved for the navy are comprehended in the proper selection, 
placement and training of gunners, listeners and lookouts. 
Numerous situations were carefully analyzed for the navy, and 
methods and mechanical devices which have achieved extensive 
application and appreciation were developed. 
Within the Medical Department of the Army a Division of 
Psychology was organized for the administration of mental 
tests to enlisted men and commissioned officers in accordance 
with plans perfected during the summer of 1917. The history 
of this work will be briefly told as an introduction to the account 
of methods and results. 
The chief purpose of the psychological assistance originally 
offered to the Medical Department was the prompt elimination 
of recruits whose grade of intelligence is too low for satisfactory 
service. It was believed by psychologists assembled in con- 
ference that their profession is better prepared technically and 
by practical experience to measure intelligence than are mem- 
bers of the medical profession and that psychologists therefore 
should be able in the military emergency to render invaluable 
assistance to medical officers by supplying reliable measures of 
intelligence which might be used as partial basis for rejection or 
discharge. Thus, it was thought, the efficiency of the service 
might be considerably increased and the costs materially 
diminished. As it happens, the purposes of this service as 
actually developed differ radically from that originally pro- 
posed; moreover they serve to identify this work even more 
closely with the personnel work of the Adjutant General’s 
Office and of the General Staff than with anything in the Med- 
ical Department of the Army aside from neuro-psychiatrie work. 
To meet the prospective need of psychological assistance a 
committee of seven experts in practical mental measurement 
was organized in the summer of 1917 and called together for

INTRODUCTION xi 
the preparation or selection of suitable methods. This group 
of men worked almost continuously for a month, devising, se- 
lecting and adapting methods. Another month was spent in 
thoroughly testing the methods in military stations in order 
that their value might be definitely established before they 
should be recommended to the Medical Department of the 
Army. The results were gratifying and the methods were ! 
therefore recommended to the Surgeon General of the Army in 7 
August, 1917, and promptly accepted for official trial. During | 
October and November they were applied in four cantonments 
under conditions which could scarcely have been more un- | 
favorable but with results which led the official medical in- 
spector to formulate the following statements and recommenda- 
tions: 
“The purposes of psychological testing are (a) to aid in 
segregating the mentally incompetent, (b) to classify men ac- 
cording to their mental capacity, (c) to assist in selecting com- 
petent men for responsible positions. 
“Tn the opinion of this office these reports (accompanying 
recommendation) indicate very definitely that the desired re- 
sults have been achieved. 
“The success of this work in a large series of observations, 
some five thousand officers and eighty thousand men, makes it 
reasonably certain that similar results may be expected if the 
system be extended to include the entire enlisted and drafted 
personnel and all newly appointed officers. 
“Tn view of these considerations, I recommend that all com- 
pany officers, all candidates for officers’ training camps and all 
drafted and enlisted men be required to take the prescribed 
psychological tests.” 
In January, 1918, this new work of the Medical Department 
was extended in accordance with the above recommendation. 
Placing psychological examining in the Medical Department 
naturally caused certain difficulties of administration. The 
confusion of psychological work with neuropsychiatry was one
-P-A-G-E-12

xii INTRODUCTION 
of the first difficulties met. The administration of psychological 
examining by a medical officer increased the work of this officer 
and at the same time added to his staff a group of psychologists 
with whose work he was unfamiliar and who were perhaps more 
interested in establishing their particular examinations than 
in correlating their work with the work of the Medical Depart- 
ment. Notwithstanding these and many other difficulties 
which the new methods met, official inquiry into the results of 
the examining made in the latter part of November and the 
early part of December, 1917, indicated that seventy-five per 
cent of the officers who had become even slightly acquainted 
with the work favored the continuation of psychological exam- 
ining. 
The original purposes of the committee in the preparation of 
methods for intelligence testing were less important than the 
uses actually made of the results. It was the intention of the 
committee as stated above to prepare an examination that would 
indicate the drafted men who were too low-grade mentally 
to make satisfactory privates in the Army; it was desired also 
to indicate, if possible, those who were mentally unstable or 
who might prove incorrigible so far as army discipline was 
concerned. In addition, the committee hoped to be able to 
pick out exceptional types of men who could be used for special 
tasks that demanded a high degree of intelligence. In interest- 
ing contrast with these original’ purposes of mental examining 
stand the results actually achieved. 4 
1. The assignment of an intelligence rating to every soldier 
on the basis of systematic examination. 
2. The designation and selection of men whose superior in- 
telligence indicates the desirability of advancement or special 
assignment. 
3. The prompt selection and recommendation for develop- 
ment battalions of men who are so inferior intellectually as to 
be unsuited for regular military training. 
4. The provision of measurements of mental ability which 
 
-P-A-G-E-13

INTRODUCTION xiii 
enable assigning officers to build organizations of uniform 
mental strength or in accordance with definite specifications 
concerning intelligence requirements. 
5. The selection of men for various types of military duty 
or for special assignment, as for example, to military training 
schools, colleges, or technical schools. 
6. The provision of data for the formation of special training 
groups within the regiment or battery in order that each man 
may receive instruction suited to his ability to learn. 
7. The early discovery and recommendation for elimination 
of men whose intelligence is so inferior that they cannot be 
used to advantage in any line of military service. 
It is of course unfortunate from the point of view of scientific 
research that many lines of investigation indicated by these 
general results could not be carried out. The psychological 
service existed in the Army for strictly practical purposes. The 
directors of the service emphasized continually the necessity 
for rendering immediate assistance in the organization of the 
Army and the setting aside of all investigations which did not 
‘further this practical end. The results given in the following 
chapter are therefore based almost entirely on military needs 
and indicate the success of this service in the Army. The more 
strictly scientific aspects of this type of examining can be con- 
sidered in future studies when the practical aim is less insistent 
or can more readily be made subservient to scientific standards.

  ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
CHAPTER I 
MAKING THE TESTS 
The origin of general intelligence tests is due to the genius 
of Alfred Binet. His investigations and early publications gave 
the stimulus to the development of mental tests for school 
children. He also did pioneer work in the study of the charac- 
teristics of the feeble-minded. Since his early work appeared in 
1905, the volume of material has become extremely large. Nu- 
merous tests have been used in the schools and in psychological 
laboratories. Many of these have been standardized and have 
proved particularly useful in school and community surveys. 
Noteworthy advances have been made by psychologists in the 
United States. Three of the most important steps in individual 
testing are represented by the Goddard revision of the Binet 
Scale, the Yerkes-Bridges Point Scale and the Stanford revision 
of the Binet Scale. Whipple’s ‘Manual of Mental and Physical 
Tests” conveniently presents the literature of tests and stand- 
ards for many of them. 
Group methods of mental testing were foreshadowed by a 
few studies previous to the development of the army methods. 
These were scattering and had had no extensive use before 1917. 
The idea of examining children and others in groups, however, 
existed and it was on the basis of these preliminary studies and 
the work in individual examining that the committee which 
met at Vineland felt that it could produce a group examination 
which would serviceably classify recruits for army purposes. 
Three or four of the members of this committee had had direct 
experierice with group methods. 
1
-P-A-G-E-16
ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
  The committee consisted of R. M. Yerkes, Chairman; W. V. 
Bingham, Secretary; H. H. Goddard, T. H. Haines, L. M. Ter- 
man, G. M. Whipple, and F. L. Wells. Each of these men 
brought to the work of the committee a large amount of ma- 
terial which was sifted to produce the group test and individual 
examining materials of the first “Examiner’s Guide.” Hun- 
dreds of tests already published were also available. The com- 
mittee drew upon these published tests and upon the materials 
brought together by the members for the group methods and 
for the individual methods devised for the Army. A complete 
group test, the work of A. S. Otis of Leland Stanford University, 
quite similar in form to that finally adopted by the Army was 
in manuscript. It also was drawn upon in making the army 
tests. 
It is not the purpose of this chapter to go into detail concern- 
ing the work of the committee in the preparation of the army 
mental tests. But it does seem worth while to call attention to 
certain principles that underlie the making of general intelli- 
gence tests and to suggest certain cautions in their use. The 
ease with which the army group test can be given and scored 
makes it a dangerous method in the hands of the inexpert. It 
was not prepared for civilian use, and is applicable only within 
certain limits to other uses than that for which it was pre- 
pared. In order to indicate this limited applicability, we shall 
quote here the criteria formulated and accepted by the com- 
mittee before any work on the tests was attempted. 
The test to be devised for army use the committee believed 
should, first, be adaptable for group use for the examining of 
large numbers rapidly. Second, it should have a high degree of 
validity as a measure of intelligence. Third, the range of in- 
telligence measured by the tests should be wide; that is, the 
test should be made difficult enough to measure the higher levels 
of intelligence and at the same time be an adequate measure of 
the extremely low levels that would probably be found in the 
Army. Fourth, as far as possible, it should be arranged for
-P-A-G-E-17
  MAKING THE TESTS 3 
objectivity of scoring and the elimination of personal judgment 
concerning correct answers; thus the results of scoring in one 
camp would be strictly comparable with those obtained in 
another. Fifth, the test should be so arranged that the scoring 
could be done rapidly and with the least chance of error. Also, 
this arrangement should be so simple that relatively inexpert 
assistance could be used in scoring the large numbers of papers. 
Sixth, there must be either different forms or alternative tests 
of equal difficulty to prevent coaching. Seventh, it was neces- 
sary also to obtain clues which would enable examiners to detect 
malingering in connection with the examination. Eighth, cheat- 
ing must also be avoided. Ninth, the test must be made as 
completely independent of schooling and educational advantages 
as possible. Tenth, the arrangement should be such as to allow 
a minimum of writing in recording answers. Eleventh, the tests 
must consist of material which would arouse interest in the 
subjects. Twelfth, the different tests used should be arranged 
to yield an accurate measure of intelligence in a reasonably 
short time. 
* With these criteria in mind the committee set to work on the 
materials available to produce what is now known as the army 
mental test. In the original series there were thirteen different 
tests. These were rated by the psychologists present on the 
basis of their validity as measures of intelligence. All other 
criteria mentioned were also taken into account. These tests 
were then given to selected groups and the results compared 
with the criteria laid down. As a result certain tests were elim- 
inated because they failed to meet the requirements. 
In connection with each of the tests finally selected, certain 
additional cautions are to be noted. In general, the battery of 
tests selected was composed of separate tests no one of which 
exceeded a time limit of approximately five minutes. The num- 
ber of items in each test and the time limits were so fixed that 
five per cent or less in any average group would be able to finish 
the entire series of items in the time allowed. It was deemed
-P-A-G-E-18
      4 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
advisable to have the directions for each test read aloud by the 
examiner and to have the subjects follow the reading of the 
directions. For each test a series of sample items correctly 
answered was given. In order to prevent coaching and cheating, 
alternative forms were prepared. Materials were gathered by 
the committee for ten of these alternative forms, but only five 
were finally printed. In making the alternative forms of the 
tests, approximately equal difficulty for the forms was desired. 
This was obtained by using the principle of random selection 
in preparing the items for each test. For example, if a test 
had forty items, and ten forms were to be made, four hundred 
items of the nature desired in the test were prepared. These 
were printed on separate slips of paper and shuffled. From 
this mass of four hundred items were drawn the items for each 
form alternately. 
The methods of scoring necessary for speed and accuracy 
were determined empirically after the first and second trials of 
the tests. Special methods of selecting the material for the 
items in each of the tests were used and specific cautions were 
observed in the arrangement of the items in each. These need 
not be discussed here. As an example, however, of the care 
with which the tests were made, we may cite the procedure 
used in test seven, known as the analogies test. Here two 
words with a specific relation are given together with a third 
word which bears that same relation to another word in a group 
of four words. This word in the group of four bears, as has 
been stated, the relation to the third word that holds for the 
first two. However, another word in this group of four words 
bears a relationship to the third word commonly known as the 
“free association relationship.” That is to say, if the third word 
is spoken to a listener who is asked to give the first word that 
occurs to him after hearing this word the chances are high that 
he will give this second word as the “free association” word. 
The peculiar nature and difficulty of the test at once becomes 
apparent when this method of making it is known.
-P-A-G-E-19
MAKING THE TESTS 5 
In test five (the disarranged sentence test), as in certain of 
the other tests, the chance order of true and false sentences was 
used. In other words, an equal number of true and false items 
was selected for any one form of this test. The sequence in 
which they appeared on the page was determined by tossing a 
coin. In addition to these special principles in making up the 
tests, the items were arranged as far as possible in the order of 
difficulty, the easier ones being placed first and the more difficult 
ones last. 
As stated above, the preliminary trials gave the basis for the 
revision and modification of the tests originally selected. After 
this revision and modification, ten tests remained. These ten 
tests were then given to approximately five thousand men in 
the Regular Army and National Guard, and in addition, to a 
variety of subjects outside of the Army. This range of subjects 
included inmates of institutions for the feeble-minded, members 
of officers’ training schools, and students in colleges and univer- 
sities. 
The examination papers, just as the examinees had marked 
them, were sent to Columbia University, where a statistical 
group headed by Edward L. Thorndike studied the results of 
the tests to check their validity, reliability and significance. 
The technical methods used cannot be described here. Some 
of the more simple methods and checks, however, may be men- 
tioned. A brief enumeration of these will indicate the laborious 
nature of the task of standardizing a test. Certainly the useful- 
ness of a test requires clear formulation and close study of the 
problem, painstaking “fitting” of the tést to the conditions set, 
correct and proper statistical studies of results and, first and 
last, skill and originality in devising the form and content of 
the test itself. 4 
At the same time that these statistical investigations were 
being carried on, the tests were given to other subjects who had 
previously been examined by established methods of mental 
testing. Other measures of intelligence, sucn as officers’ ratings 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
    6 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
of soldiers of the National Guard and the Regular Army, were 
obtained. Where school children or college students were exam- 
ined, teacher’s estimates of intelligence and college or school 
grades were used. The results of the army intelligence tests 
were then compared with these other measures of intelligence. 
In a group of tests, such as the army group examinations, 
each of which is made up of eight types of test, it is necessary 
to note the relations between the separate tests. If, for example, 
the relationship between two of the tests is very high, it is pos- 
sible that the tests are repetitive and that one of them is un- 
necessary. On the other hand, an extremely low relationship 
between one of the tests and the total score might indicate that 
the test should be omitted because it adds little to the measure 
of intelligence yielded by the group of tests as a whole. The 
caution to be observed in this instance, or where a specific 
testing purpose is in view, is that the test may measure some 
ability of equal importance with the abilities measured by the 
other tests of the group. The relation of the group of tests 
to the independent measure of the trait in question constitutes 
the specific reason for keeping or rejecting a test which shows 
low relationship to the total score. 
Other things to be noted in measuring the usefulness of a 
particular test are the number of zero scores produced by the 
test, the time allowance, and the method of scoring. It is ob- 
vious, for example, that if fifty per cent of the group tested, or 
even twenty per cent, make zero scores, the test is unsatisfactory 
as a measure of a wide range of intelligence. It is also important 
to note whether most of the persons tested are given oppor- 
tunity to exhibit their maximum ability in a test; too short a 
time allowance may prevent some from reaching items of suffi- 
cient difficulty to test their ability. On the other hand, in 
preparing the army tests it was necessary to limit the time al- 
lowance in accordance with the practical situation. 
In scoring the tests certain mathematical precautions are 
necessary. For instance, the test which offers only two alterna-
-P-A-G-E-21
    
MAKING THE TESTS 7 
tives will yield a high percentage of right scores by chance. To 
compensate for this, such a test may be scored “right minus 
wrong.”’ In addition, a considerable list of observations neces- 
sary in finally checking the validity of the army tests might 
be given. 
It was found that on the whole the ten tests which constituted 
the examination known as Examination A, forms A, B, C, D, 
and E of the official army trial in the fall of 1917, were fairly 
satisfactory measures of intelligence. The score distributions 
for each of the tests were good; that is, there were relatively 
few zero scores and a small percentage of the subjects could 
either finish or practically finish the tests in the time allowed. 
A study of the increase in incorrect answers in the upper range 
of items in each test also indicated that the tests approximated 
a measure of actual ability and were not merely testing speed 
in reading or thinking. There proved to be a regular gradation 
of score distributions from the graduate students through the 
officers’ training school men, regular and national guard pri- 
vates, down to the inmates of institutions for the feeble-minded. 
Comparison of the results of the tests with officers’ ratings of 
their own men showed a satisfactory degree of correspondence. 
On the whole, the tests graded the men as the officers estimated 
the value of these same men to the army. Repetition of the 
tests indicated that they had a fairly high degree of reliability. 
If a man did his best, the chances were that he would vary ten 
points or less on a second trial. The statistical results indicated 
further that for the entire group it was fairly safe to say that 
the men’s true scores were not more than fifteen points above 
or below the ones actually recorded. In this connection, it 
may be noted that the alpha examination, which is the one 
given in the Examiner’s Guide included in this volume, shows 
an even higher reliability. The evidence indicates that the 
average scores due to accidental circumstances vary, for this 
examination, not more than five points up or down. 
Comparisons of the results of the tests with schooling as re-  
-P-A-G-E-22
LE eT ee ee ne meray Te 
8 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
ported by the person tested indicate that the tests are not 
merely a measure of schooling or of opportunity to attend school 
but are actually a measure of native ability. All five forms of 
the group examination were used in the pre-official trial of the 
tests. The differences in forms were so slight as to indicate the 
success of the random method of selecting items. Form B 
proved more difficult than the other forms. The order of items 
was changed, as a result of the trial, in a few instances. . 
One further question remained. How should the results of 
widely distributed testing of this sort be interpreted? In this 
connection it may be emphasized again that the group examina- 
tion used in the Army was interpreted entirely in terms of 
military needs. Modifications made in the tests, such as scor- 
ing and weighting, were all intended to make it a better measure 
of ability in the Army. This specialization of the group exam- 
inations for the Army makes them less valuable in other fields. 
We have indicated above that the range of intelligence meas- 
ured by the tests included distinctly feeble-minded persons as 
well as officers and graduate students. The assignment of 
letter grades to the score distributions was based upon this 
range. The scores were designated as A, B, C, D, and E 
ratings. This division into five grades or ratings was con- 
sidered sufficiently fine for the principal army uses. Subdivi- 
sions can be introduced to any extent desired. The alpha 
numerical score ranges from 0 to 212 points. In preparing 
distribution tables, scatter tables, and in all statistical calcu- 
lations 5 and 10 point groups or classes are used. For example, 
all scores of 55 to 59 points (or 70 to 79 points) inclusive form 
one group. 
Officers’ training school candidates and graduate students 
made as a rule A and B scores. Clerical assistants and men in 
the Regular Army who could handle the paper work usually 
made grades in upper C or B. The average private scored C. 
Men who reported themselves as laborers fell in grade D and 
privates who belonged to service organizations or who were

MAKING THE TESTS 9 
relatively ineffective in the Army or men who were inmates of 
institutions for the feeble-minded made scores in low D or E. 
The general intelligence test for literates,. covering a wide 
range of ability, was prepared for its official trial in the manner 
described above. The need for haste in its construction made 
it important that a thorough study of the test in actual camp 
conditions be undertaken. This trial was made in four national 
army cantonments in the fall of 1917. Approximately 80,000 
men were tested in this official trial of the methods. About 
7,000 college, high school and elementary school students were 
also tested in order to check the army results. All of the data 
available from the official trial were then subjected to statistical 
treatment as a basis for revision of the tests. 
Psychologists from the camps and members of the original 
committee spent over two months in the study of results and 
in the revision of methods. From this work and the preliminary 
trials that followed the revision, the present methods were ob- 
tained. The group examination beta was prepared to enable 
examiners to make a rapid survey of the 30 per cent who either 
could not read English or read it so slowly that they could not 
do themselves justice in the test for literates. The Stanford- 
Binet and the Point Scale were adapted for army use at this 
time and the individual examination for foreigners and illiterates 
was prepared. ‘ 
The validity of the tests as measures of intelligence was 
checked against every available criterion, including officer rat- 
ings of men, army rank as an outcome of survival of the fittest, 
other kinds of intelligence scales, professional success, and abil- 
ity to learn as evidenced by school standing. Not only has the 
scale as a whole been thus checked up, but also every one of 
the separate parts making up the scale. The correlations with 
other criteria of known validity were almost invariably high. 
The influence of literacy, repetition of the test, physical con- 
dition of the examinee, and the personal equation of the exam- 
iner have all been carefully considered.

  10 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
The development of the beta test and of the performance test 
for the examination of the foreign speaking and illiterate pre- 
sented special problems. The use of demonstration charts and 
pantomime to convey the instructions to the persons being 
examined proved successful. The new type of test in the beta, 
using geometrical designs, mutilated pictures, etc., required 
different principles in its construction. The individual per- 
formance tests also involved additional and peculiar standards 
of construction and evaluation. 
The important purpose of these supplementary tests was, of 
course, to give to those handicapped by language difficulties 
a real opportunity to show their ability. In addition, two 
definite aims were planned in the use of all forms of testing: 
first, to point out the feeble-minded and those incapable of mili- 
tary service because of mental deficiency and, second, to find 
those of unusual or special ability. The arrangementof each test, 
in both group and individual examinations, was therefore checked 
against the scores of men in institutions for the feeble-minded. 
If no score had meant low mentality the first task would have 
been solved; but we have shown that literacy was an important 
factor in the alpha test. The beta test practically eliminated 
this factor and was thus a step further in selecting those of low 
intelligence. To prove conclusively that a man was weak- 
minded and not merely indifferent or malingering, the per- 
formance test was added. 
The individual examinations as finally used in the Army were, 
therefore, primarily checks on the group examinations. No 
person was reported as feeble-minded until a detailed individual 
psychological examination had been made. Many cases of 
mental disorder were discovered and referred to the psychiatrists 
for examination. Disciplinary cases referred to the psychol- 
ogists were always given individual examinations, as were re- 
ferred cases of men having difficulty with drill or those who 
failed to improve in the Y. M. C. A. schools and elsewhere. 
A detailed statement of how these tests are made is impracti-

cable here. Most of the methods used in the army and given in 
the Examiner’s Guide are described in journals and in the litera- 
ture of mental tests. The results of their use are indicated by 
the numbers of examinations made and by the totals of low-grade 
cases found. The instructions for giving the tests are perhaps 
more essential in individual examination than they are in the 
group examinations. Again, the detailed cautions have been 
presented in the literature of mental tests and need not be 
repeated at this point.

  CHAPTER II 
METHODS AND RESULTS * 
After preliminary trial in four cantonments psychological 
examining was extended by the War Department to the entire 
Army, excepting only field and general officers. To supply the 
requisite personnel a school for training in military psychology 
was established in the Medical Officers’ Training Camp, Fort 
Oglethorpe, Georgia. Approximately one hundred officers and 
more than three hundred enlisted men received training at this 
special school. 
On November 11, 1918, the psychological personnel consisted 
of about one hundred and twenty officers and three hundred and 
fifty enlisted men. Over five hundred additional clerks were 
used in the examining service in the thirty-five different camps 
in which psychological examining had been established. The 
army intelligence examination had been given to 1,726,966 men; 
of these 41,000 were officers. Approximately 83,000 individual 
examinations had been given. Over 7,800 men had been recom- 
mended for immediate discharge; 10,014 had been recommended 
for labor battalions or other service organizations; 9,487 had 
been recommended for development battalions for further ob- 
servation and preliminary training. Nearly 30 per cent of the 
1,556,011 men for whom statistics are available were found to 
be unable to “read and understand newspapers and write 
letters home,’’ and were given a special examination prepared 
for illiterates. 
The general classification of the men proceeded as rapidly as

Council in 1918.

they reported to camp. Men qualified to be non-commissioned 
officers and candidate-officers on the basis of satisfactory intel- 
ligence scores were pointed out within forty-eight hours of their 
arrival. By this time the general usefulness of psychological 
examining was no longer seriously questioned, and it had be- 
come necessary for the psychologists of a camp to emphasize 
continually that the methods were intended as a measure of 
only one of the essential qualities of a soldier. 
A few quotations from the statements of officers will indicate 
their general attitude, and typical ways in which the results 
were used in training men and in selecting candidates for the 
officers’ training schools. 
“Officers and men should be given a psychological examination as a 
matter of routine. 
“The results of the psychological examinations are fully borne out by 
actual observation of the abilities and the capacity of various officers 
in the performance of duties assigned to them. I do not mean by this 
that these tests are an absolute gauge, but I do mean that they are an 
absolute guide, and that given the practical tests we are enabled to 
arrive at the best possible determination of ability to meet the require- 
ments of the service. 
“_ . . This subject of psychology in its relation to military efficiency 
is an entirely new one, and the War College Division approached it with 
a good deal of doubt as to its value. A very thorough study of the re- 
ports submitted, however, has firmly convinced it that this examination 
will be of great value in determining the possibilities of newly drafted 
men and all candidates for officers’ training camps. 
“_. . At first, due to the innate conservatism of line and even of 
medical officers, his (the psychological examiner’s) task was a rather 
uphill one, but now, due to his own energy and tact and to the thor- 
oughness and honesty of his work, practically all officers have been 
convinced of its practical value and unique assistance in rating, sorting 
and disposing of the divers kinds of men as well as officers who pass 
through such a camp. . . . I consider such an expert and his specialty 
among the most useful aids in the scientific and non-wasteful utiliza- 
tion of man power. 
“|. . I consider the Psychological Service of especial value in this 
camp, which is devoted to the elementary training of recruits for field 
artillery... .
-P-A-G-E-28
    14 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
“The forms (filled out by applicants) were arranged in the order of 
the psychological mark, and all applicants of Class A were gone over 
with a view of finding out if there were any who, because of a specific 
statement of the company commander, should be thrown out without 
further examination. There were almost none of these. The same 
thing was done with all of Class B. The Class C applicants were then 
gone over with a view of seeing if there were any who, notwithstanding 
their low psychological mark, should nevertheless be considered be- 
cause of the specific statement of the company commander. There 
were very few of these. i 
“The psychological examination of these men... has been a 
great aid to me as commanding officer of the school, not only in the 
final summing up of their qualifications for an officer’s commission, 
but also during their stay at the school in working out the reasons for 
their apparent deficiency. . . . It is recommended that in the future 
all candidates for Officers’ Training School be sent first before a psycho- 
logical board, and that the results of this examination be a determining 
factor in their entrance to the school.” 
“T consider it highly desirable to use psychological ratings in the 
selection of all applicants for the Officers’ Training Camp. ... It is 
doubtful whether applicants should be admitted to the school who 
have not, according to the psychological examinations, made a score 
equivalent to “high average’”’ intelligence (C+). ... Intelligence 
rating should receive primary consideration, and all other important 
factors secondary consideration. In very exceptional and rare cases 
it is possible that this order of consideration may be reversed. . . . 
We find the psychological ratings more reliable than any other ii 
formation. Above all else, an officer should have a high degree of in- 
telligence, and when this is combined with an excellent physical 
record, leadership, ete., we have the type desired for a commissioned 
officer.” 
“The Board of Officers, charged with the duties of examining can- 
didates for the Officers’ Training School regard the psychological rat- 
ings as the one best factor of the various factors which determine a 
candidate’s qualification for entry to said school. 
“Concurring in the opinion of the Commanding Officer of the Training 
School, this camp, the above board of officers hold that all candidates 
should have not less than a high average intelligence rating (C+) to 
. qualify for entry to training schools, except in rare and exceptional 
cases in which other factors are extremely favorable. It is the unani- 
mous opinion of this Board that the intelligence rating is the most 
reliable index, in that a quantitative statement is available and in that

METHODS AND RESULTS - 15 
rough observation is effectively checked. The psychological rating is, 
therefore, considered of primary importance. 
“., . From my experience in different camps, I am of the opinion 
that enlisted men who rate below the A and B classes (by the psycho- 
logical test) should not be considered as candidates for the Officers’ 
» Training Schools. 
‘All enlisted men sent to Officers’ Training Schools from this camp 
are inspected as to their military appearance and bearing, and their 
knowledge of the elementary duties of a soldier; they are given a 
physical examination, a mental examination, and the psychological 
examination. If they do not rate A or B in this examination they are 
rejected.” 
The methods originally prepared for use in the Army were 
subjected to repeated revisions, in the light of results, for in- 
crease in reliability and military value. The procedure finally 
adopted and used throughout the Army consists of two chief 
types of examination: the group examination and the individual 
examination. The former was necessitated by the demand for 
speed of examination and report, the latter by the desire for 
reliability and fairness to the individual. 
Of group examinations, there are two varieties used in the 
Army; the one for men who can read and write English fairly 
well (literates), known as alpha; the other for men who are 
unable to read and write English well (illiterates), known as 
beta. The individual examination includes three varieties de- 
veloped, as were the group examinations, to suit different types 
of subjects. They are: (1) the Point Scale examination, (2) the 
Stanford-Binet examination, and (3) the Performance Scale 
examination. Both the Point Scale and the Stanford-Binet are 
used in the Army in three forms: (a) as complete scales, for 
literate subjects, (b) as abbreviated scales, for literate subjects, 
(c) as specially adapted scales, for relatively illiterate subjects. 
These two types of examination, the Point Scale and Stanford- 
Binet, are used as alternates, the examiner selecting in accord- 
ance with his preference. . 
For the examination of foreign and illiterate men who can
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
neither read nor write English and of whom many speak and 
understand it very imperfectly, the special form of examination 
known as the performance scale, has been developed and is 
effectively used. 
Examination alpha consists of eight tests, describable by 
title as follows: test 1, directions or commands test; test 2, 
arithmetical problems; test 3, practical judgment; test 4, 
synonym-antonym; test 5, disarranged sentences; test 6, number 
series completion; test 7, analogies; test 8, general information. 
With this method men are examined in groups as large as 
five hundred. Every man is supplied with a pencil and an 
examination blank. He then, under military discipline, follows 
directions to the best of his ability. The examination requires 
approximately fifty minutes. It demands almost no writing 
since responses are indicated by underscoring, crossing out, or 
checking. The examination papers are quickly scored by means 
of stencils, and mental ratings recorded for prompt report. To 
avoid, within reasonable limits, the risk of coaching, several 
duplicate forms of this examination have been made available. 
Each test of examination alpha consists of a number of parts 
arranged in order Of difficulty from low to high. It is therefore 
possible for low-grade subjects to make a start on each test, 
and, at the same time, practically impossible for highly intelli- 
gent subjects to complete the tests within the time allowed. 
The tests are varied in character and undoubtedly sample the 
most important types of intellectual process. 
Examination beta consists of seven tests, listed thus by 
title: test 1, maze test; test 2, cube analysis; test 3, X-O 
series; test 4, digit-symbol; test 5, number checking; test 6, 
pictorial completion; test 7, geometrical construction. 
This examination, which was devised after alpha had been 
put into use to meet an unexpected demand for the examination 
of subjects of low literacy and extreme unfamiliarity with 
English, is in effect, although not in strictness test for test, alpha 
translated into pictorial form so that pantomime and demon-
-P-A-G-E-31
  METHODS AND RESULTS 17 
stration may be substituted for written and oral directions 
Beta may be given successfully to men who neither speak nor 
understand English. 
Examinations alpha and beta are so constructed and admin- 
istered as to minimize the handicap of men who because of for- 
eign birth or lack of education are little skilled in the use of 
English. These group examinations were originally intended, 
‘and are now definitely known, to measure native intellectual 
ability. They are to some extent influenced by educational 
acquirement, but in the main the soldier’s inborn intelligence 
and not the accidents of environment determines his mental 
rating or grade in the army. 
Like alpha, examination beta requires about fifty minutes 
and the papers are scored by the use of stencils. 
Both alpha and beta yield numerical scores or intelligence 
scores which for practical military purposes are translated into 
letter grades. The several letter grades used in the Army, with 
their score-equivalents and appropriate definitions are pre- 
sented in the following table. 
Intelligence 
grade Definition Score (alpha) Score (beta) 
A Very superior 135-212 100-118 
B Superior 105-134 90-99 
C+ High average 75-104 80-89 
Cc Average 45-74 65-79 
Cc- Low average 25-44 - 45-64 
D Inferior 15-24 20-44 
D- Very inferior 0-14 —«. 0-19 
E grade was reserved for men who were recommended for re- 
jection, discharge, development battalion, or service organiza- 
tion. All men deemed satisfactory for regular military duty 
were graded D— or higher.

need be described in detail, since both are widely known and 
adequate descriptions are available. The military adaptations 
of the scales may prove useful in various civil situations, but 
because of copyright restrictions they are not reproduced in 
this volume. 
The several procedures of individual examining have played 
a most important réle in the military service, and the 
examiner who lacks familiarity with them and reasonable skill 
in their application and the interpretation of their results is 
ill-prepared for psychological military service. 
The army performance scale cannot be adequately described 
by reference since it is in the main a product of military expe- 
rience and effort. It consists of ten tests, the titles of which 
fairly well sugges’ their nature: test 1, the ship test; test 2, 
manikin and feature profile; test 3, cube imitation; test 4, cube 
construction; test 5, formboard; test 6, designs; test 7, digit- 
symbol; test 8, maze; test 9, picture arrangement; test 10, 
picture completion. 
As in the case of group examinations alpha and beta, so also 
in that of the several forms of individual examination, numerical 
scores for subjects were secured which could be translated into 
letter grades. 
The general procedure of examining which was developed to 
meet military requirements is briefly describable as follows: 
A group of draftees, the size of which is determined by the 
seating capacity of examining room (it varies from one hundred 
to five hundred men) is reported to the psychological examining 
building for mental test. The first essential step is the segrega- 
tion of the illiterates. This is accomplished by having all men 
who cannot read and write their own letters and those who 
have not proceeded beyond the fifth grade in school step out 
of the original group. The remaining men are sent to the alpha 
room. Naturally, among them there are likely to be several 
who will subsequently have to take the beta examination. The 
illiterates are sent directly to the beta room. 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  METHODS AND RESULTS 19 
Men who fail in alpha are sent to beta in order that injustice 
by reason of relative unfamiliarity with English may be avoided. 
Men who fail in beta are referred for individual examination 
by means of what may appear to be the most suitable and alto- 
gether appropriate procedure among the varied methods avail- 
able. This reference for careful individual examination is yet 
another attempt to avoid injustice either by reason of linguistic 
handicap or accidents incident to group examining. 
It is to be emphasized that the interests of the individual 
who is either in the army or in process of being accepted for 
military service are safeguarded by a system of three types of 
examination which serve as sieves. Every soldier is required 
to take at least one examination. Men who are of low mental- 
ity, those who are of foreign birth or for other reasons illiterate, 
and those who exhibit marked peculiarities of behavior may 
be required to take either two or three examinations before the 
psychological report can be completed. 
Despite the necessity for haste which in some instances com- 
pelled small examining staffs to grade and report on as-many 
as two thousand soldiers per day, the army mental test work 
has been done with an average thoroughness and degree of re- 
liability which would do credit to any school system or other 
civil institution. : 
When psychological examining was originally accepted by 
the Medical Department for official trial, there was extreme 
and widely prevalent skepticism even among. psychologists 
themselves concerning the reliability of the measurements of 
intelligence which could be secured and still more concerning 
their practical value to the Army. The measures of reliability 
or validity of army methods of mental measurement which 
have been obtained during the past eighteen months are there- 
fore quite as important as a partial basis for safe opinion con- 
cerning the significance of this service as are the evidences of 
practical value which have accumulated. Effort will be made 
to present, as adequately as is possible within brief compass, 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  20 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
samples of both kinds of measure. First, reliability may be 
considered. ; 
For examination alpha the probable error of the score is 
approximately 5 points. This is one-eighth of the standard 
deviation of the score distribution for unselected soldiers. The 
reliability coefficient is approximately .95. Alpha yields cor- 
relations with other measures of intelligence as follows: (1) with 
Officers’ ratings of their men .50 to .70; (2) with Stanford-Binet 
measurements, .80 to .90; (3) with Trabue B and C completion 
tests combined, .72; (4) with examination beta, .80; (5) with 
composite of alpha, beta and Stanford-Binet, .94; (6) in the 
ease of school children alpha measurements correlate with 
(a) teachers’ ratings .67 to .82, (b) school marks .50 to .60, 
(c) school grade location of thirteen and fourteen-year-old 
pupils .75 to .91, (d) age of pupils .83.* 
Results for examination beta correlate with alpha, .80; with 
Stanford-Binet, .73; with composite of alpha, beta and Stanford- 
Binet, .91. 
Results of repetition of the Stanford-Binet examination in 
case of school children correlate .94 to .97. The abbreviated 
form of the Stanford-Binet scale consisting of only two tests 
per year, extensively used in the army, correlates .92 with 
results for the entire scale. 
Reliability coefficients for results of point scale examination 
closely approximate those for the Stanford-Binet scale. 
The several tests of the performance scale, taken separately, 
correlate with Stanford-Binet measurements, .48 to .78. Five 
of the ten tests of the performance scale yield a total score 
which correlates .84 with Stanford-Binet results. 
It is definitely established that examination alpha measures 
literate men very satisfactorily, considering the time required, 
for mental ages above eleven years. Examination beta is some- 
what less accurate than alpha for the higher ranges of intelli- 
* Chiefly because of the relatively narrow age range, the correlation of 
alpha score with age of recruits is practically zero,
-P-A-G-E-35
METHODS AND RESULTS 21 
gence. There are convincing evidences that some men are not 
fairly measured by either alpha or beta and that the provision 
of careful individual examination for men who fail in beta is 
therefore of extreme importance. 
There follows a brief statistical summary of results of in- 
dividual examining in the Army, and a discussion of military 
applications and evidences of practical value. 
Between April 27 and November 30, 1918, 7,749 men (0.5 
per cent) were reported for discharge by psychological exam- 
iners because of mental inferiority. The recommendations for 
assignment to labor battalions because of low-grade intelligence, 
number 9,871 (0.6+ per cent). For assignment to development 
battalions, in order that they might be more carefully observed 
and given preliminary training to discover, if possible, ways of 
using them in the Army, 9,432 men (0.6+ per cent) were recom- 
mended. 
During this same six-month interval there were reported 
4,744 men with mental age below seven yeats; 7,762, between 
seven and eight years; 14,566, between eight and nine years; 
18,581, between nine and ten years. This gives a total of 
45,653 men under ten years mental age. It is extremely im- 
probable that many of these individuals were worth what it 
cost the government to maintain, equip and train them for 
military service. 
The psychological rating of a man was reported promptly to 
the personnel adjutant and to the company commander. In 
addition, all low-grade cases and men exhibiting peculiarities of 
behavior were reported also to the medical officer. The mental 
rating was thus made available for use in connection with re- 
jection or discharge, the assignment of men to organizations 
and their selection for special tasks. The mental ratings were 
used in various ways by commanding officers to increase the 
efficiency of training and to strengthen organizations by im- 
proved placement. 
It was repeatedly stated and emphasized by psychological 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  22 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
examiners that a man’s value to the service should not be 
judged by his intelligence alone, but that instead temperamental 
characteristics, reliability, ability to lead and to ‘carry on” 
under varied conditions should be taken into account. Even 
after the feasibility of securing a fairly reliable measure of every 
soldier’s intelligence or mental alertness had been demonstrated, 
it remained uncertain whether these measurements would cor- 
relate positively with military value to a sufficient degree to 
render them useful. Data which have become available during 
the past year settle this question definitely by indicating a rela- 
tively high correlation between officers’ judgments of military 
value and the intelligence rating. 
A description and explanation of the letter ratings used by 
psychological examiners were handed to each officer who received 
the scores of recruits. Directions for the use of the ratings 
were also supplied. Quotations from “Army Mental Tests” 
will indicate the nature of these explanations and directions. 
In explanation of letter ratings:—The rating a man earns 
furnishes a fairly reliable index of his ability to learn, to think 
quickly and accurately, to analyze a situation, to maintain a 
state of mental alertness, and to comprehend and follow in- 
structions. The score is little influenced by schooling. Some 
of the highest records have been made by men who had not 
completed the eighth grade. The meaning of the letter ratings 
is as follows. 
A = Very superior intelligence. This grade is ordinarily 
earned by only four or five per cent of a draft quota. The “A” 
group is composed of men of marked intellectuality. ‘A’ men 
are of high officer type when they are also endowed with leader- 
ship and other necessary qualities. 
B = Superior intelligence. ‘B” intelligence is superior, but 
less exceptional than that represented by “A.” The rating 
“B”’ is obtained by eight to ten soldiers out of a hundred. The 
group contains many men of the commissioned officer type 
and a large amount of non-commissioned officer material.
-P-A-G-E-37
  METHODS AND RESULTS 23 
C += High average intelligence. This group includes fifteen 
to eighteen per cent of all soldiers and contains a large amount 
of non-commissioned officer material with occasionally a man 
whose leadership and power to command fit him for commis- 
sioned rank. 
C = Average intelligence. It includes about twenty-five per 
cent of soldiers. Excellent private type with a certain amount 
of fair non-commissioned officer material. 
C —= Low average intelligence. This group includes about 
twenty per cent. Although below average in intelligence, “C—” 
men are usually good privates and satisfactory in work of a 
routine nature. . 
D = Inferior intelligence. It includes about fifteen per cent 
of soldiers. ‘“D” men are likely to be fair soldiers, but they 
are usually slow in learning and rarely go above the rank of 
private. They are short on initiative and so require more than 
the usual amount of supervision. Many of them are illiterate 
or foreign. 
D-— and E = Very inferior intelligence. This group is di- 
vided into two classes (1) “‘D—” men, who are very inferior 
in intelligence but are considered fit for regular service; and 
(2) “E” men, those whose mental inferiority justifies their 
recommendation for development battalion, special service 
organization, rejection, or discharge. The majority of “D—” 
and “EE” men are below ten years in “mental age.” 
The immense contrast between “A” and “D—” intelligence 
is shown by the fact that men of “A” intelligence have the 
ability to make a superior record in college or university, while 
“D—” men are of such inferior mentality that they are rarely 
able to go beyond the third or fourth grade of the elementary 
school, however long they attend. In fact, many ‘“D—” and

& ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
Concerning directions for the use of intelligence ratings:—In 
using the intelligence ratings the following points should be 
borne in mind. 
1. The mental tests are not intended to replace other methods 
of judging a man’s value to the service. It would be a mistake 
to assume that they tell us infallibly what kind of soldier a man 
will make. They merely help to do this by measuring one im- 
portant element in a soldier’s equipment, namely, intelligence. 
‘They do not measure loyalty, bravery, power to command, or 
the emotional traits that make a man “carry on.” However, 
in the long run these qualities are far more likely to be found 
in men of superior intelligence than in men who are intellectually 
inferior. Intelligence is perhaps the most important single 
factor in military efficiency, apart from physical fitness. 
2. Commissioned officer material is found chiefly in the “A” 
and “B” groups, although of course not all high score men 
have the other qualifications necessary for officers. Men below 
“C-+-” should not be accepted as students in Officers’ Training 
Schools unless they possess exceptional power of leadership 
and ability to command. 
3. Since more than one-fourth of enlisted men rate as high 
as “C+,” there is rarely justification for going below this grade 
in choosing non-commissioned officers. This is especially im- 
portant in view of the likelihood of promotion from non-com- 
missioned to commissioned rank. Even apart from considera- 
tions of promotion, it is desirable to avoid the appointment of 
mentally inferior men (below C) as non-commissioned officers. 
Several careful studies have shown that “C—” and “D” ser- 
geants and corporals are extremely likely to be found unsatis- 
factory. The fact that a few make good does not justify the 
risk taken in their appointment. 
4. Men below “C+” are rarely equal to complicated paper 
work. 
5. In selecting men for tasks of special responsibility the 
preference should be given to those of highest intelligence rating 
   
-P-A-G-E-39
     METHODS AND RESULTS Cs) 
who also have the other necessary qualifications. If they make 
good they should be kept on the work or promoted; if they fail 
they should be replaced by men next on the list. 
To aid in selecting men for occupational assignment, exten- 
sive data have been gathered on the range of intelligence scores 
found in various occupations. This material has been placed 
in the hands of Personnel Officers for use in making assignments. 
It is suggested that those men who have an intelligence rating 
above the average in an occupation should be the first to be 
assigned to meet the needs for that occupation. After that, 
men with lower ratings should be considered. 
6. In making assignments from the Depot Brigade to per- 
manent organizations it is important to give each unit its pro- 
portion of superior, average, and inferior men. If this is left 
to chance there will inevitably be ‘weak links” in the army 
chain. Exception to this rule should be made in favor of certain 
arms of the service which require more than the ordinary number 
of mentally superior men; for example, Signal Corps, Machine 
Gun, Field Artillery and Engineers. These organizations or- 
dinarily have about twice the usual proportion of “A” and 
“B” men and very much less than the usual proportion of 
“TD” and “D—” men. 
The first two columns in the following table illustrate the . 
distribution of intelligence ratings typical of infantry regiments 
and also the extreme differences in the mental strength of or- 
ganizations which are built up without regard to intelligence 
ratings. The last column to the right shows the balanced dis- 
tribution of intellectual strength which might have been at- 
tained in each of these two regiments.

D—- Very inferior 18.0 2.0 10.0 
Unless intelligence is wisely distributed certain regiments and 
companies will take training much more slowly than others 
and thus delay the program of the whole organization. 
7. “D” and “D--” men are rarely suited for tasks which 
require special skill, resourcefulness or sustained alertness. It 
is also unsafe to expect “ D,” “D—” or “E” men to read or un- 
derstand written directions. 
8. Only high-score men should be selected for tasks which 
require quick learning or rapid adjustments. 
9. It should not be supposed that men who receive the same 
mental rating are necessarily of equal military worth. A man’s 
value to the service should not be judged by his intelligence 
alone. 
10. The intelligence rating is one of the most important aids 
. in the rapid sorting of the masses of men in the Depot Brigade. 
In no previous war has so much depended on the prompt and 
complete utilization of the mental ability of the individual 
soldier. It is important, therefore, that the psychological rat- 
ings be regularly used as an aid in the selection, assignment, 
and classification of men. 
The various figures which follow are presented not as a sum- 
mary of the results of psychological examining ‘in the army _ 
but instead as samples of these results, the chief value of 
which is to indicate their principal relationships and practical 
values. 
The sample distribution curves of Figure 1 indicate the value

ferent kinds of military material. The illiterate group of this 
figure was examined by means of beta, all other, eral by 
means of alpha. 
The psychological ratings have proved valuable not so act 
because they make a better classification than would come 
about in the course of time through natural selection but chiefly 
because they greatly abbreviate this process by indicating imme- 
diately the groups in which suitable officer material will be 
found, and at the same time those men whose mental inferiority

warrants their elimination from regular units in order to pre- 
vent the retardation of training. Speed counts in a war that 
costs fifty million dollars per day. 
Comparison of various military groups distinguished from 
one another by actual attainment in the service shows that the 
psychological tests discriminate between these groups with def- 
initeness. This point may be illustrated by reference to the 
percentages of men of different groups making A and B grades 
in examination alpha: officers, 83.0 per cent; officers’ training 
school candidates, 73.2 per cent; sergeants, 53.4 per cent; cor- 
porals, 39.7 per cent; literate privates, 18.8 per cent. The com- 
parison of measures of central tendency reveals equally striking
-P-A-G-E-42
28 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
differences. Moreover, within the officer group itself significant 
differences appear for different branches of the service. 
The relation of success or failure in officers’ training schools 
to intelligence ratings is exhibited by Figure 2, in which it is to 
be noted that elimination through 
failure in the school increases rapidly 
for ratings below C+. Of men rat- 
ae ing above C+, 8.65 per cent were 
mea eliminated; of those below C+, 58.27 
per cent. The data for this figure

figure are important because of their relatively high intelligence 
and the mental initiative demanded for. success, whereas those 
in the lower half of the figure are important because of poor 
intelligence and relative inefficiency or uselessness. 
These results suggest that if military efficiency alone were to

30 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
be considered, the Army would undoubtedly gain largely by re< 
jecting all “D—” and “E” men. This procedure would greatly 
lessen the group of disciplinary cases so troublesome and costly 
in the military organization and also the group which in the 
figure is distributed among “ten poorest privates,” “men of 
low military value” and “unteachable men.” 
- Numerous varieties of evidence indicate the extreme military 
importance of the prompt recognition of low-grade men. The 
percentages of men ranking below the average in psychological 
examinations are notably large for the disciplinary group, men 
having difficulties in drill, men reported as ‘“unteachable” and 
men designated by their officers as “poorest” from the stand- 
point of military usefulness. 
The comparison of negro with white recruits reveals markedly 
lower mental ratings for the former. A further significant dif- 
ference based on geographical classification has been noted in 
that the northern negroes are mentally much superior to the 
southern. 
The relation between officers’ judgments of the value of their 
men and intelligence ratings is exhibited in somewhat different 
ways by Figures 5 to 7. Thus the median scores for five groups 
of privates arranged in order of military value from “very poor” 
to “best” are presented in Figure 5. The total number of in- 
dividuals in the group is 374. 
The men were selected from twelve different companies, ap- 
proximately thirty men in each company being ranked by an 
officer én serial order from “best” to “poorest.” The rank 
order for each company was then correlated by the psychological 
examiner with the rank order supplied by psychological exam- 
ination. In seven of the twelve companies the correlations 
ranged from .64 to .75. The average correlation was .536. 
These correlations are high, considering the large number of 
factors which may influence a man’s value to the service. 
The median score for the ‘‘very poor” group of Figure 5 is 28 
points in an examination whose maximal score is 212 points. By 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
   METHODS AND RESULTS 31 
contrast with this, the median score of the “best” group of 
privates is 99 points. 
The commanding officers of ten different organizations, repre- 
senting various arms of the service, in a certain camp were asked 
to designate (1) the most 
efficient men in their organ- 
izations, (2) the men of 
average ability and (3) men 
so inferior that they are 
“barely able” to perform 
their duties. 
The officers of these or- 
ganizations had been with 
their men from six to twelve 
months and knew them ex- 
ceptionally well. The total 
number of men rated was 
965, about equally divided 
among “best,” ‘“average,” 
and “‘poorest.’’ After the of- 
ficers’ ratings had been made, 
the men were given the usual 
psychological test. Compari- Officers’ Rating Median Score

(e) That the per cent classed as ‘‘best” in the various groups 
increased steadily from 0% in D— to 57.7% in A, while 
the per cent classed as “poorest” decreased steadily from 
80% in D— to 11.5% in A. 
In an infantry regiment of another camp were 765 men (regu- 
lars) who had been with their officers for several months. The 
company commanders were asked to rate these men as 1, 2, 3, 4, 
or 5 according to “practical soldier value,” 1 being highest and 
5 lowest. The men were then tested, with the following results: 
(a) Of 76 men who earned the grade A or B, none was rated 
“5” and only 9 were rated “3” or ‘4.” 
(b) Of 238 D and D— men, only one received the rating “1,” 
and only 7 received a rating of “2.” 
(c) Psychological ratings and ratings of company commanders 
were identical in 49.5 per cent of all cases. There was 
agreement within one step in 88.4 per cent of cases, and 
disagreement of more than two steps in only .7 per cent 
of cases. 
Figure 6 exhibits a striking contrast in the intelligence status 
and distribution of “best” and “poorest” privates. The per- 
sonal judgment data for this figure were obtained from sixty 
company commanders who were requested to designate their 
ten “best” and their ten “poorest” privates. Of the “poorest,” 
57.5 per cent graded D or D—; less than 3 per cent graded A 
or B. The results suggest that intelligence is likely to prove 
the most important single factor in determining a man’s value 
to the military service. 
In one training camp excellent opportunity was offered to 
compare a group of soldiers selected on the basis of low military 
value with a complete draft quota. In the “low value” group 
there were 147 men, in the complete draft quota 12,341 men. 
The distribution of intelligence ratings for these two military 
groups appear as Figure 7, from which it is clear that if all men
-P-A-G-E-47
  METHODS AND RESULTS 33 
with intelligence ratings below C— had been eliminated, the 
“low value” group would have been reduced by at least half. 
In a certain training camp 221 inapt soldiers, belonging to a 
negro regiment of Pioneer Infantry, were referred by their com- 
manding officer for special psychological examination. Nearly 
one-half (109) of these men were found to have mental ages of 
seven years or less. The Army nevertheless had been attempting 
to train these men for military service. In justice to the Psycho-

   logical Service it should be stated that these negroes had been 
transferred from camps where there were no psychological 
examiners; for this reason they had not been examined before 
being assigned to an organization for regular training. 
In another instance some 306 soldiers from organizations 
about to be sent overseas were designated by their commanding 
officers as unfit for foreign service. They were referred for 
psychological examination with the result that 90 per cent were 
discovered to be ten years or less in mental age, and 80 per cent 
nine years or less. 
It has been discovered that when soldiers are assigned to

training units without regard to intelligence, extreme inequal- 
ities in the mental strength of companies and regiments appear. 
This fact is strikingly exhibited by Figures 8 and 9, of which the

ment. Compare, for example, the intelligence status of C and 
E companies. The former happens to have received only 3 
per cent of A and B men along with 38 per cent of illiterates and 
foreigners; the latter received by contrast 29 per cent of high- 
grade men with only 9 per cent of men who are as a rule difficult 
to train. It is needless to attempt to emphasize the military 
importance of this condition. The tasks of the officers of these 
two companies are wholly incomparable. But more serious 
even than the inequalities in response to training are the risks

of weak points in the army chain as a result of such random or 
unintelligent assignment. 
Naturally enough the officers of the Army were quick to 
appreciate the disadvantages of a method of assigning recruits 
which permits such extreme inequalities in mental strength to 
appear and persist. They promptly demanded the reorganiza- 
tion of improperly constituted units and assignment in accord- 
ance with intelligence specifications so that the danger of weak 
links in the chain and of extreme difference in rapidity of train- 
ing should be minimized. 
That serious inequalities existed in regiments as well as in 
smaller units prior to assignment on the basis of intelligence is 
proved by the data of Figure 9, : : : 13

Following the demonstra-

assignment, the experiment or 6 A 
was tried in various training f°" = 8 » a» ¥ 
camps of classifying men in 
accordance with intelligence 
for facilitation of training. To 
this end A and B grade men were placed in one training group, 
C+, C and C— men in another, and D and D— men in a third. 
The three groups were then instructed and drilled in accordance 
with their ability to learn. Thus delay in the progress of high- 
grade men was avoided and the low-grade soldiers were given 
special instruction in accordance with their needs and capacity. 
The marked differences in the mental strength of groups in 
different officers’ training schools are shown by Figure 10. For 
the eighteen schools of this figure, the proportion of A grades 
varies from 16.6 per cent to 62.4 per cent; the proportion of A 27

and B grades combined, from 48.9 per cent to 93.6 per cent; and 
the proportion of grades below C-+-, from 0 to 17.9 per cent. 
Since it is unusual for a man with an intelligence rating below 
C+ to make a satisfactory record in an officers’ training school, 
it is clear that the pedagogic treatment of these several student 
groups should differ more or less 
radically and that elimination 
must vary through a wide range if 
the several schools are to graduate 
equally satisfactory groups of 
officers. 
Far more important than the 
contrast in student officers’ train- 
ing groups noted above are the dif- 
ferences in the intelligence status 
of officers in different arms of the 
service as revealed by psychologi- 
cal examining. Figure 11 exhibits

included in the percentages given. With the medical officers 
omitted practically no correlation with rank appears. The 
medical officers taken alone show a high correlation with rank. 
It has been suggested that this represents the professional 
grading that has already been made in civil life. 
Figure 12 presents the percentages of Table 1 in graphic form. 
The different grades and ranks are shown according to the 
letter grade classification given in the table. The dividing line 
is placed between C+ and B. 
Further evidence indicates that the tests prophesy success 
in field operations. When the classification made by them is 
compared with total value to the service after a year of training 
and actual fighting the correspondence is still positive, and an 
average statistical prophecy of attainment exists. The degree 
of practical success in the application of such a measure may 
well be considered one of the major achievements of the war.

I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
1. PURPOSES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION 
(a) To classify soldiers according to their mental ability, thus 
supplementing personnel records of occupational qualifications 
and assisting with assignment in the Army. 
(b) To supply a mental rating for each soldier which shall 
assist personnel officers in building organizations of equal or of 
appropriate mental strength. 
(c) To assist regimental, company and medical officers by 
careful examination and report on men who are not responding 
satisfactorily to training, or are otherwise troublesome. 
(d) To assist officers of development battalion with classifica- 
tion, grading, training, and ultimate assignment of men. 
(e) To assist in discovering men of superior mental ability 
who should be selected for officers’ training camps, for promo- 
tion or for assignment to special tasks. ’ 
(f) To assist in discovering and properly placing men of 
marked special skill, as for example, observers or scouts for 
intelligence service. 
(g) To assist in discovering men who are mentally inferior 
and who in accordance with degree of defectiveness should be 
recommended for discharge, development battalions, labor or- 
ganizations or regular military training.   2. GENERAL PLAN OF EXAMINATION 
(1) Segregation of men obviously illiterate. 
(2) Group examination alpha (for literates): 
Time, 40 to 50 minutes. 
Number, 100 to 200 men in a group. 
(3) Group examination beta (for illiterates and men failing 
in examination alpha): 
Time, 50 to 60 minutes. 
Number, up to 60 men in a group.
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
(4) Individual examinations (for men failing in beta, or re- 
ferred) : 
Point-scale examination. 
Stanford-Binet examination. 
Performance-scale examination. 
Time, 15 to 60 minutes. 
Mechanical skill examination (supplementary): 
Time, 15 to 30 minutes. 
The order of procedure is as follows: 
(a) A group consisting of 100 to 200 men will report to the 
psychological examiner at designated room for examination 
alpha. 
(6) Men who cannot read and write English at all should 
first be eliminated from this group by directing those who can- 
not read or write to stand, and by observing the manner in 
which the remainder fill out the headings of the examination 
alpha blank. Those who are eliminated should be sent to the 
special beta examining room; the remainder should be given 
examination alpha. 
(c) Men found later to have made scores of less than 15 (raw 
score) in examination alpha should be given examination 
beta. 
(d) Individuals rated D— after beta or after alpha and beta 
will report by appointment for individual examination. It is 
estimated that not over 5 per cent of the strength of an 
organization should require individual psychological examina- 
tion. 
Summary.—All enlisted men take either alpha or beta. Those 
who can read and write English, take alpha immediately. Those 
who cannot, take beta immediately. Those who make scores 
of less than 15 in alpha take beta. All who fail in beta take 
individual examination. The form of individual examination 
given varies with the characteristics of the subject. Point- 
scale or Stanford-Binet examination may be given to subjects 
who are able to understand English fairly well. To all other 
*
-P-A-G-E-59
  EXAMINER’S GUIDE 45 
subjects performance-scale examination should be given either 
alone or in addition to one of the other scales. 
3. ORGANIZATION AND ROUTINE 
The value of these examinations will depend upon the per- 
fection of organization and the efficiency of the routine pro- 
cedure which is developed by the examining staff. The follow- 
ing points are especially important: 
(a) Previous arrangement should insure the prompt reporting 
of men either by groups or individually at a given time and 
place for prescribed examination. Company officers accom- 
panying groups to be examined, should be asked to list men 
who give trouble, or whom they would like to see examined in- 
dividually; reasons and company record should be noted in 
each case. 
(6) Group and individual examination blanks should be scored 
and recorded as promptly as possible, and ratings prepared for 
immediate report. The chief psychological examiner is respon- 
sible for one complete file of all examinations, to be kept in 
easily accessible form by organizations. All available lists of 
names, such as company rosters, personnel officer lists, etc., 
should be used by examiners to simplify and to increase the 
accuracy of the reports. Time will often be saved by typing 
or writing scores directly on such lists, especially if they can 
be obtained in duplicate or triplicate. 
(c) The intelligence rating of every man examined should 
be reported promptly to Personnel Officer, with comment con- 
cerning any special aptitude noted. Company commanders 
should also have all available information as soon as men are 
assigned. 
(d) All cases of mental deficiency, as well as all cases for 
which neuro-psychiatric examination is especially indicated, 
should be referred promptly to the psychiatrist through the 
camp or division surgeon. Complete report of psychological 
examination, on blank furnished for the purpose, must accom-
-P-A-G-E-60
46 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
pany every such case, whether referred for discharge, .assign- 
ment to special organization, or neuro-psychiatric examination. 
(e) Psychological record card, complete with recommendation 
and disposition of case, and report on cases recommended for 
neuro-psychiatric examination should be forwarded to, the 
Surgeon General’s Office, Division of Psychology, after the 
soldier has left camp. 
(f) Weekly statistical sheet should be sent promptly on or 
before Tuesday of each week to Surgeon General’s Office. It 
should be supplemented by such letter statements and special 
reports as seem desirable. ; 
(g) Every effort should be made to codperate as fully and 
effectively as possible with all officers of the camp or division 
for the increased efficiency of the Army. 
February 2, 1918, the following instructions were issued, by 
the divisions concerned, to promote codperation and increase 
the efficiency of the psychological and neuro-psychiatric services: 
PROVISION FOR COORDINATION OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL 
EXAMINATIONS IN DIVISIONAL TRAINING CAMPS 
It is agreed between the Division of Psychology and the Division of 
Neuro-psychiatry: 
(1) That psychiatric survey of organizations shall be made in con- 
junction with psychological survey. 
(2) That for this purpose psychiatric examiners shall be present 
at group psychological examinations, to observe the behavior and ap- 
pearance of soldiers. It is further provided that the work of the 
psychiatrist shall not interfere with the proper conduct of psychological 
examination. 
(3) That rooms numbered 5 and 6 in Psychology Building shall be 
designated for psychiatric examining. 
(4) That the name, rank, and organization of individuals receiving 
grade E in group psychological examination shall be reported promptly 
to the division psychiatrist through the division surgeon. 
(5) That report of individual psychological examination shall be 
accepted by psychiatrist as part of the medical examination and shall

be included in the case record if subject be recommended for discharge 
or for special assignment.

4, UTILIZATION OF RESULTS 
Psychological ratings should be valuable alike to personnel 
officers, line officers, and medical officers. To the first, as 
partial basis for placement of soldiers; to the second, as supple- 
mentary information for guidance in connection with training, 
or special treatment of men who give trouble; and to the third, 
as partial basis for recommendation for discharge, special 
examination, or medical treatment. 
The results of examination should be made available to these 
officers as early as possible. It is therefore the duty of the 
psychological examiner to see that every drafted man is exam- 
ined as promptly as possible after arrival in camp, and that 
report is immediately made to the personnel officer, to the 
medical officer if the case requires it, and subsequently to the 
company commander to whom the man is assigned. 
The draft contains an adequate number of high-grade men 
to fill positions of responsibility. The psychological examina- 
tion helps to reveal non-commissioned officer material and 
suitable candidates for officers’ training camps. It also supplies 
partial basis for assignment of men to specific trades or occu- 
pations in the Army. In making selections for training in any 
specialized branch of military service it will probably be wise 
to select individuals whose intelligence scores are well above 
the lower quartile for the occupation in question. Apart from 
inequalities in experience or special training, the difference in 
the scores of two men will, in a general way, indicate their 
relative value for assignment to a specific trade or occupation. 
Emphasis should be placed upon the desirability of balancing   
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
the special trades and occupations in the various companies and 
regiments. Each unit should have its proper share of high, 
medium, and low-grade men for special assignments as well as 
for the ranks. It is evident that the ultimate value of the 
psychological service in balancing the units will depend very 
largely upon the establishment of proper codperative relations 
with personnel officers. Frequent conferences with the per- 
sonnel officers should be held, and ways and means considered 
for securing effective codrdination of effort. 
To be of the greatest value the psychological examination 
should be given at the earliest possible date after the arrival 
of the men in camp, in order that the personnel officer may 
have the results on the qualification cards when making assign- 
ments. Unless the scores are available and used properly at 
this time, companies will be built up that are very uneven in 
general intelligence. In order to balance companies and regi- 
ments satisfactorily it is necessary to observe not only the special 
requirements laid down in the tables of organization, but also 
the requirement that there shall be equivalent grades of intelli- 
gence in company organizations and in the various trades and 
occupations demanded in each. 
Codperative relations should be established between psychia- 
trists and psychological examiners in order that company com- 
manders and personnel officers may obtain promptly detailed 
information concerning any individual recruit. The lower 
grades of mental capacity are clearly indicated by the alpha 
and beta examinations. The lowest cases should be given 
individual examination with the least possible delay. Com- 
pany commanders should be encouraged to refer for examina- 
tion men whose drill or conduct is unsatisfactory. Where de- 
velopment battalions have been formed special study should 
be made of the results of the development work in the case of. 
men of various grades of intelligence. The psychological service 
should be able to make an effective contribution in the handling 
of development units.

5. CONFERENCES WITH OFFICERS 
In order that the results of examinations may be used effec- 
tively, it is necessary that psychological examiners take pains 
to acquaint all officers in their stations with the nature and 
uses of intelligence ratings. To this end, conferences with 
groups of officers, by regiments or other convenient unit, should 
be arranged by the chief psychological examiner. In these con- 
ferences the methods of examining should be explained clearly 
and simply, and the possible ways of using psychological in- 
formation described and illustrated. The examiner should 
strive especially to take the military point of view. Unwar- 
ranted claims concerning the accuracy of the results should be 
avoided. In general, straightforward common-sense statements 
will be found more convincing than technical descriptions, 
statistical exhibits, or academic arguments. 
In order to make such conferences of the greatest value, the 
views and criticisms of officers should be elicited as fully as 
possible. In this way misunderstandings will be cleared up and 
the way paved for effective codperation. 
The criticisms most likely to arise are the following: (1) That 
the score made is greatly influenced by such accidental factors 
as fatigue, homesickness, illness, time of day, etc. (2) That the 
tests do not measure real ability, but instead merely reflect the 
man’s educational and social advantages. (3) That the score 
may be greatly influenced by coaching or by a repetition of the 
test. 
While it has been well enough established that such factors 
as these are not present in a sufficient degree to invalidate 
seriously the test results, their presence cannot be denied. It 
can hardly be claimed that the mental or physical condition 
of the subject and the circumstances under which the test is 
given have no effect upon the score. Similarly, it would be un- 
reasonable to suppose that the result is wholly uninfluenced by 
educational advantages. While coaching is not likely to in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
50 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
validate the results to any great extent in army testing, it is 
nevertheless a factor whieh should be carefully guarded against 
by measures designed to prevent the dissemination of blanks. 
As regards practice effects, it has been found that the average 
gain in a repeated alpha examination is approximately 8 points 
(raw score). The P. E. of an alpha raw score is approximately 
5 points. While cases will admittedly occur in which men will 
receive a rating on the psychological examination somewhat 
higher or lower than they deserve, this would occur on any 
method of classification that might be used. It may well be 
emphasized that the psychological examination furnishes for 
immediate use a rating of the men which in validity compares 
not unfavorably with ratings furnished by officers after months 
of acquaintance. 
In using the psychological results there is a tendency to over- 
look the fact that they give evidence concerning but one quality 
important in a good soldier. The company commander should 
be cautioned not to neglect the importance of other qualities, 
such as personal appearance, energy, military experience, 
leadership, initiative, tact, etc. It is no criticism of the psycho- 
logical rating that it fails to measure these other qualities of 
the soldier. All it does is to afford a reasonably reliable measure 
of one essential quality—i. e., general intelligence. Although 
there is a fairly high correlation between general intelligence 
and other desirable traits, like character, leadership, etc., the 
fact must not be overlooked that there are individuals of high 
intelligence who are not properly fitted to command. It has 
been proved quite definitely that the results of the psychological 
examinations are valuable when properly used. They cannot, 
however, be made to take the place of all other criteria. Each 
officer should be encouraged to scrutinize the men of his com- 
mand carefully in order to discover their individual differences 
in other traits as well as in intelligence. 
Individual cases will be found in which the information of 
the company commander is greatly at variance with the psycho-
-P-A-G-E-65
  EXAMINER’S GUIDE 51 
logical rating. In such cases one would not be warranted in 
making sweeping claims for the infallibility of the test results. 
It should be pointed out that the discrepancy may be due to 
the presence or absence of important traits not measured by the 
intelligence examination. Such cases, however, afford oppor- 
tunity for the psychological examiner to make clear the value 
of a rating which is absolute rather than relative. The company 
commander will readily appreciate the fact that his own esti- 
mate is relative; that he inevitably judges his men with refer- 
ence to the average in his company. For this reason in the 
company which in general is inferior a high man will be over- 
estimated. Similarly, in a specially high company a low man 
will be underestimated. Company commanders will readily 
appreciate the importance of bringing to light extreme cases 
of unevenness in different organizations in order that such 
inequalities may be remedied. 
II. SEGREGATION OF ILLITERATES 
Subjects reporting for group examination belong in one of 
the following classes: 
(4) Men totally illiterate or unable to understand English; 
(2) Men who read or write English only with difficulty; 
(3) Men who read and write English readily. 
Examination alpha will not measure the intelligence of the 
first group; it may or may not yield a reliable measure for the 
second group; it will measure the intelligence of the third group. 
Group 1 should be given beta only; group 3 should be given 
alpha (but not beta unless the score earned in alpha was below 
D); group 2 should be given both alpha and beta in order that 
men making below D in alpha because of language difficulty 
may have opportunity to improve their scores in examination 
beta. 
Examiners should eliminate at the outset of examination alpha 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
ee ey 
52 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
all total illiterates and men who cannot understand English, 
by ordering these to stand and to leave the alpha room. They 
may then be referred to examination beta. Officers’ statements 
that men cannot read and write may be used to advantage in 
making this separation. i 
After these men have been segregated and the remaining 
group satisfactorily placed, each man is supplied with a pencil. 
Then E. should say: “We are going to pass around some papers 
now; don’t turn any of the pages until I tell you to.” Have 
assistants distribute alpha booklets, face up, making sure that 
only one is handed to each man. As soon as the booklets have 
been distributed E. should continue, slowly and distinctly, 
pausing after each instruction to give subjects time to respond: 
“Now, at the top of the page before you, print your name after 
the word ‘Name.’ Print your first name first, then your middle 
initial, if any, and then your last name. Take time to print 
very plainly.” 
After name has been written, say: “Put your rank in the 
Army after the word ‘Rank,’ such as private, corporal, ser- 
geant, sergeant first class,” etc. “Put your age in years after 
the word ‘Age.’”’ “In the next line write your company, regi- 
ment, arm, and division.” (E. should mention designation of 
these.) 
“Tn the next line write the name of the state or country in 
which you were born.”’ “If you were not born in this country, 
tell next the number of years you have lived in the United 
States.” ‘After ‘Race’ write the word ‘White.’” (In exam- 
ining negro troops substitute the word “Negro.” If there are 
Indians in the group, ask them to write the word “Indian.” 
Similarly for Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, etc.) 
“Tn the next line after ‘Occupation,’ write your usual work, 
trade or business (such as carpenter, grocery clerk, laborer, 
farmer, student).” ‘Next put down how much you earned a 
week before you entered the Army; not how much a day or a 
month, but how much a week.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 53 
“ After ‘Schooling,’ draw a line under the highest grade or 
school you attended. For example, if the highest grade you 
attended was the fifth grade, draw a line under Grade 5; if 
you attended the second year in the high school or preparatory 
school, draw a line under High School, Year 2, etc.” 
After these directions have been given, the orderlies should 
systematically examine the paper of each man to discover his 
ability to carry out the above directions. Those subjects who 
are unable to read and write sufficiently to fill out these headings 
should be commanded to stand, and on completion of prelim- 
inary survey by examiner and his assistants should be ordered 
to enter examining room for examination beta. 
The above direction is based upon the assumption that a man 
who cannot understand the directions given by E., read the 
words “occupation,” “weekly wages,” “schooling,” ete., and 
write the necessary replies, cannot do justice to himself in 
examination alpha. 
Ill. GROUP EXAMINATION ALPHA 
1, PROCEDURE 
Examination alpha is to be given to all subjects who remain 
in the room after the elimination of illiterates. In giving the 
following directions E. should speak rather slowly, distinctly, 
and with proper emphasis. He should expect and demand per- 
fect order and prompt response to, commands. 
When everything is ready E. proceeds as follows: “Attention! 
The purpose of this examination is to see how well you can 
remember, think, and carry out what you are told to do. We 
are not looking for crazy people. The aim is to help find out 
what you are best fitted to do in the Army. The grade you 
make in this examination will be put on your qualification 
card and will also go to your company commander. Some of 
the things you are told to do will be very easy. Some you may 
find hard. You are not expected to make a perfect grade, but 
do the very best you can. :
-P-A-G-E-68
  54 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
_ “Now, in the Army a man often has to listen to commands 
and then carry them out exactly. I am going to give you some 
commands to see how well you can carry them out. Listen 
closely. Ask no questions. Do not watch any other man to 
see what he does. 
“Look at your papers. Just below where you have been 
writing, there are several sets of forms—circles, triangles, and so 
forth. First you will be told to do something with the circles 
at 1, afterwards with the circles at 2, and so on. 
“When I call ‘Attention,’ stop instantly. whatever you are 
doing and hold your pencil up—so. Don’t put your pencil 
down to the paper until I say ‘Go.’ (Examiner lowers his 
pencil.) Listen carefully to what I say. Do just what you are 
told todo. As soon as you are through, pencils up. Remember, 
wait for the word ‘Go.’” 
N. B. Examiner.—Give the following instructions very dis- 
tinctly and at moderate speed. After giving the command 
“Attention,” always notice carefully and have orderlies notice 
whether all pencils are up. Never proceed until they are. 
This is especially important in the beginning. Be careful to 
use the directions that fit the form of alpha booklet distributed. 
Be careful not to pause or to drop the voice in the course of a 
compound direction, e. g., in 3, before the words ‘and also.” 
Raise your pencil whenever you say “Attention.” Lower it 
promptly whenever you say “Go.”

sentence if put in the order all horses have feathers, but this 
statement is false. 
“*Below are 24 mixed-up sentences. Some of them are true

atatime. Think what each would say if the words were straight- 
ened out, but don’t write them yourself. Then, if what it would 
say is true draw a line under the word “‘true;” if what it would

is underlined. Grass is green just as the sky is blue.

“Here the word walks is underlined. A man walks and a 
fish swims. 
“Took at the third sample: Day—night : : white—red, black, 
clear, pure. 
“Here the word black is underlined because black is the op- 
posite of white just as night is the opposite of day. 
“Tn each of the lines below the first two words are related to 
each other in some way. What you are to do in each line is to 
see what the relation is between the first two words, and under- 
line the word in heavy type that is related in the same way to 
the third word. Begin with No. 1 and mark as many sets as 
you can before time is called.—Ready—Go!”’

while I read them.”’ (E. reads slowly.) 
“Notice the sample sentence: People hear with the—eyes 
—ears—nose—mouth. The correct word is ears, because it 
makes the truest sentence. In each of the sentences below 
you have four choices for the last word. Only one of them is 
correct. In each sentence draw a line under the one of these 
four words which makes the truest sentence. If you cannot 
be sure, guess. The two samples are already marked as they 
should be.’—Ready—Go!” 
After 4 minutes, say “STOP! Turn over the page to Test 1 
again. In the upper right hand corner, where it says ‘Group 
No. —,’ put the number 101” (or 102, 108, etc., according 
to the number of this group in the examiner’s series of 
groups). 
Have all examination booklets and pencils collected imme- 
diately and before the men are allowed to leave their seats. 
Before dismissing the group, the number of booklets collected 
should be carefully checked with the number of men present 
and the number of booklets issued. 
2. DIRECTIONS FOR SCORING 
General Rules 
1. Each item is scored either right or wrong. No part credits 
are given. 
2. In general, items evidently corrected stand as corrected. 
8. In tests where the score is “Number Right,” only wrong 
items need be checked in scoring. In Tests 4 and 5, where the 
score is ‘Right minus Wrong,” wrong and omitted items must 
be separately checked. 
4, Indicate the last item attempted by drawing a long line 
under that item and out into the margin. 
5. Enter the score for each test in lower right-hand corner of 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 67 
the test page and encircle it. When the test has been re-scored, 
a check mark may be made beside the circle. 
6. Red or blue pencil increases accuracy of scoring. 
Test 1 
(Score is number right.) 
1. No credit is given for any item in which more is done than 
the instructions require. 
2. In an item where something is to be written “in” a given 
space, give credit if a mark crosses a line from haste or awk- 
wardness; give no credit if the position is really ambiguous. 
3. Where something is to be underlined or crossed out, give 
credit if two or three underlinings are made in the required 
place, and give credit for any method of crossing out. 
4. Item 2.—The pencil line must begin and end either on the 
circumference or within the circles indicated. It may touch 
the intermediate circles, but must not cut through them. 
5. Item 6.—In the circle marked “not 12” there must be 
some number which is not 12, such as 5, 0, 27. 
6. Item 9—The proper numbers must be crossed out to 
receive credit. 
7. Item 10.—In Form 5, ‘‘2” alone and “3” alone, but not 
“2 or 3,” in each of the two largest parts; “5” alone and “6” 
alone, but not “5 or 6,” in the next to the smallest part, are 
correct. Similarly for other forms. 
8. Item 11.—The lines must cross, or at least touch, the 
proper numbers; they may or may not cut the accompanying 
letters. Mere indication of the square, triangle, etc., is not 
sufficient. , 
9. Item 12.—Underlining in place of crossing out is wrong. 
Test 2 
(Score is number right.) 
1. Answer may be written on dotted line or elsewhere near 
its problem. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  68 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
2. If two answers are given to any problem, count as wrong. 
3. If it seems clear that, by a slip, one answer has been put 
in the wrong brackets, and the next answers are all thus mis- 
placed, give credit for the answers that are right even if mis- 
placed. 
4. Omission of dollar sign is permissible. 
5. Omission of decimal point is permissible in items 2, 9, 18, 
and 14. Fraction may be expressed as decimal in item 15. 
Test 3 
(Score is number right.) 
1. Any clear method of indicating answer is given full credit— 
underlining, checking, etc. 
2. If two answers are marked, count as wrong unless one 
is clearly indicated as final. 
Test 4 
(Score is number right minus number wrong.) 
1. Any clear method of indicating answer is given credit. 
2. When both “Same and “Opposite” are underlined, counts 
as omitted, not as wrong. 
3. If only “Same” is underlined right down the column, 
score for the test is zero. Similarly if “Opposite” is under- 
lined right down the column. 
Test 5 
(Score is number right minus number wrong.) 
Same rules as for Test 4. 
Test 6 
(Score is number right.) 
1. If only one number is written, give no credit. 
2. If only one of the numbers is right, give no credit.
-P-A-G-E-83
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 69 
    
    
   
        8. If four numbers are written, as frequently happens with 
certain items (i. e., 38, 11 instead of 3, 3), give full credit. 
Test 7 
(Score is number right.) 
1. Any clear indication other than underlining receives full 
credit. 
2. Underlining of any of the first three words of an item 
does not remove credit. 
8. 1f two or more of the last four words are marked, give no 
credit. 
Test 8 
(Score is number right.) 
Same rules as for Test 7.

IV.—GROUP EXAMINATION BETA 
1. DIRECTIONS FOR SETTING UP APPARATUS 
Beta materials are shipped in three packages. 
1. Blackboard frame. 
2. Blackboard chart. 
3. (a) Cardboard pieces for Test 7; (6) patterns for 
constructing cubes for Test 2. 
The blackboard frame consists of 8 fitted sections, 2 uprights 
which carry 2 rollers and 4 crossbars which are attached to 
the small crosspieces of the uprights. The blackboard should 
be set up so that the ends of the rollers to which the crank may 
be fitted come on the right-hand side. <A piece of beaver board 
30 by 40 inches should be nailed to the crossbars so as to give 
a rigid writing surface. This must be procured in the camps. 
The blackboard chart is a continuous roll 27 feet long. Care 
should be used in attaching chart to rollers so that it will wind 
evenly. The chart must be kept as clean as possible at all 
times. The painting should be gone over from time to time 
with a white gloss paint.* 
The patterns for constructing cubes for test 2 should be drawn 
on heavy cardboard on a scale such that the constructed model 
will appear to be made from 38-inch cubes. All cube edges, 
either real or imaginary, should be bordered in lines 1/8-inch 
thick painted with india ink. The models should be cut on the 
full lines and folded on the dotted lines as indicated in the pat- 
terns furnished. For these cube models a sloping shelf should be 
so arranged that the perspective from the center of the room 
will be the same as that of the models represented on the black- 
board. 
*The demonstration figures for beta are reproduced in Chapter VI, 
page 284 of this book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
Chalk, eraser, pointer, and a curtain for covering beta ap- 
paratus are also necessary. 
2. PROCEDURE 
It is most important that examination beta be given in a 
genial manner. The subjects who take this examination some- 
times sulk and refuse to work. E. and his assistants will find 
it necessary to fill out most of the headings for the men before 
the examination begins. The time required for this preparatory 
. work may be used to advantage in making the men feel at ease. 
As the demonstration preparatory to each test requires some 
time, the “pencils up” command is omitted in examination 
beta. The examiner’s platform should be so high that he 
can readily see whether or not the subjects are working. Great, 
care should be taken to prevent the over-anxious from begin- 
ning work before the command “Go.” 
Seating conditions should be such that subjects cannot copy 
from one another and the rule that copying shall not be allowed 
should be enforced strictly. The blackboard should at all 
times be kept clean so that the visual conditions may be ex- 
cellent and constant. The blackboard figures for Test 1 should 
be exposed when the subjects enter the examining room. As 
soon as a test has been demonstrated and the men have been 
told to go ahead, the blackboard should be covered and kept 
covered until time is called. It should not be turned to the 
next test until the men have been ordered to stop work on a 
given test. Care should be taken to have the physical conditions 
of examination reasonably uniform. 
With the exception of the brief introductory statements and 
a few orders, instructions are to be given throughout by means 
of gestures instead of words. These gestures accompany the 
samples and demonstrations and should be animated and 
emphatic. 
It is absoiutely necessary that directions be followed closely 
and procedure kept uniform and definite. Variations of pro-
-P-A-G-E-95
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 81 
cedure are more likely to occur in beta than in alpha, and there 
is serious risk that if allowed they will lessen the value of results. 
E. should especially guard against using more or fewer gestures 
or words for one group than for another. Oral language should 
be rigidly limited to the words and phrases given in the pro- 
cedure for the different tests. 
Whether the men get the idea of the test and enter into it 
with the proper spirit will depend chiefly on the skill with which 
the examiner, the demonstrator, and the orderlies carry out 
their respective parts. Examiner and demonstrator especially 
should be selected with the greatest care. An examiner who 
succeeds admirably in giving alpha may prove to be entirely 
unadapted for beta. Both examiner and demonstrator must 
be adept in the use of gesture language. In the selection of a 
demonstrator the Personnel Office should be consulted. One 
camp has had great success with a “window seller” as demon- 
strator. Actors should also be considered for the work. The 
orderlies should be able to keep the subjects at work without 
antagonizing them and to keep them encouraged without 
actually helping them. 
The demonstrator should have the single task of doing before the 
group just what the group is later to do with the examination 
blanks. The blackboard is his beta blank. Before examination 
beta can be given satisfactorily the demonstrator must be letter 
perfect in his part. Both E. and demonstrator must be very 
careful to stand at the side of the blackboard in order not to 
hide the drawings. 
As soon as the men of a group have been properly seated, 
pencils should be distributed and also examination blanks with 
Test 8 up.! While this is being done E. should say ‘Here are 
some papers. You must not open them or turn them over 
until you are told to.” Holding up beta blank, E. continues: 
“Tn the place where it says name, write your name; print it if 
you can. (Pause.) Fill out the rest of the blank about your 
1Test 8, although printed on the record blanks, was not used.
-P-A-G-E-96
  82 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
age, schooling, etc., as well as you can. If you have any trouble 
we will help you.” (The instructions given under segregation 
may be used for filling out the beta blank.) E. should announce 
the group number and see that it as well as the other necessary 
information is supplied. Before the examination proceeds each 
paper should be inspected in order to make sure that it is satis- 
factorily completed. 
After the initial information has been obtained, E. makes 
the following introductory remarks: 
“Attention! Watch thig man (pointing to demonstrator). He 
(pointing to demonstrator again) is going to do here (tapping 
blackboard with pointer), what you (pointing to different mem- 
bers of group) are to do on your papers (here E. points to several 
papers that lie before men in the group, picks up one, holds it 
next to the blackboard, returns the paper, points to demon- 
strator and the blackboard in succession, then to the men and 
their papers). Ask no questions. Wait till I say ‘Go ahead!’” 
In general, when instructing the group to turn from test to 
test, E. holds up a beta blank before group and follows his 
own instructions as he gives them. As soon as he has turned 
to desired test or page he says, “This is test X here; look!” 
(pointing to the page). ‘ 
To suggest to the group the necessity of working rapidly the 
demonstrator, after proceeding very deliberately with the early 
samples of each test, hurries, as soon as he has worked out the 
last sample problem    
   
    
         
       
    
         (1) to record his response as fast as he can, 
(2) then to catch E.’s eyes for approval and 
(8) finally, to slip away from blackboard, drawing cur- 
tain as he does so. 
After the personal data called for on page 1 of blank have 
been gathered and recorded, the orderlies’ vocabulary in bet: 
is rigidly restricted to the following words, or their literal equiv- 
alents in Italian, Russian, etc.: Yes, No, Sure, Good, Quick,
-P-A-G-E-97
  EXAMINER’S GUIDE 83 
How many? Same, Fix it. Under no circumstances may sub- 
stitutional explanations or directions be given. 
Test 1.—Maze 
“Now turn your papers over. This is Test 1 here (pointing 
to page of record blank). Look.” After all have found the 
page, E. continues, “Don’t make any marks till I say ‘Go 
ahead.’ Now watch.’ After touching both arrows, E. traces 
through first maze with pointer and then motions the demon- 
strator to go ahead. Demonstrator traces path through first 
maze with crayon, slowly and hesitatingly. E. then traces 
second maze and motions to demonstrator to go ahead. Dem- 
onstrator makes one mistake by going into the blind alley at 
upper left-hand corner of maze. E. apparently does not notice 
what demonstrator is doing until he crosses line at end of alley; 
then E. shakes his head vigorously, says ‘‘No—no,” takes 
demonstrator’s hand and traces back to the place where he 
may start right again. Demonstrator traces rest of maze so 
as to indicate an attempt at haste, hesitating only at ambiguous 
points. E. says “Good.’’ Then, holding up biank, ‘Look 
here,”’ and draws an imaginary line across the page from left 
to right for every maze on the page. Then, “All right. Go 
ahead. Do it (pointing to men and then to books). Hurry up.” 
The idea of working fast must be impressed on the men during 
the maze test. E. and orderlies walk around the room, motion- 
ing to men who are not working, and saying, “Do it, do it, 
hurry up, quick.’’ At the end of 2 minutes E. says, “Stop! 
Turn over the page to Test 2.” 
Test 2.—Cube Analysis 
“This is Test 2 here. Look.” After every one has found the 
page—“ Now watch.” The order of procedure is as follows: 
(1) E. points to the three-cube model on the blackboard, 
making a rotary movement of the pointer to embrace the entire 
picture.  
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
(2) With similar motion he points to the three-cube model 
on shelf. 
(3) E. points next to picture on blackboard and asks, “How 
much?” 
(4) E. turns to cube model and counts aloud, putting up his 
fingers while so doing, and encouraging the men to count with 
him. 
(5) E. taps each cube on the blackboard and motions to 
demonstrator asking him ‘How much?” 
(6) Demonstrator (pointing) counts cubes on blackboard 
silently and writes the figure 3 in proper place. 
In the second sample of this test, when E. counts cubes of 
model he 
(1) counts the three exposed cubes; 
(2) touches the unexposed cube with pointer; and 
(3) without removing pointer turns model, so that hidden 
cube comes into view of group. In other respects 
procedure with second and third samples is the 
same as with first. 
In counting the 12-cube model, E. (1) counts the top row of 
cubes in the model (left to right), (2) counts the exposed bottom 
row (right to left), (3) taps with pointer the end cube of hidden 
row, (4) turns the entire model around and completes his count- 
ing. E. then holds model in same plane as drawing and counts 
(in the same order as above) the cubes on blackboard, counting 
lines between front and top row as representing the hidden row. 
He then asks demonstrator “How much?” Demonstrator 
counts the cubes on blackboard (pointing but not speaking) 
and writes the response. 
Throughout the demonstration the counting is done delib: 
erately, not more rapidly than one cube per second. 
At end of demonstration E. points to page and says, ‘Al 
right. Go ahead.” At the end of 2'/, minutes he says, “Stop 
look at me and don’t turn the page.”
-P-A-G-E-99
  EXAMINER’S GUIDE 85 
Test 3.—X-O Series 
“This is Test 3 here. Look.” After everyone has found the 
page—“ Now watch.” E. first points to the blank rectangles 
at the end, then traces each “O” in chart, then traces outline 
of “O’s” in remaining spaces. Demonstrator, at a gesture, 
draws them in. E. then traces first “X”’ in next sample, moves 
to next “X” by tracing the are of an imaginary semicircle 
joining the two, and in the same mauner traces each “X,” 
moving over an arc to the next. He then traces outlines of 
“X’s”’ in the proper blank spaces, moving over the imaginary 
arc in each case, and motions to demonstrator to draw them in. 
Demonstrator, at a gesture, fills in remaining problems very 
slowly, standing well to the right of the blackboard and writing 
with his left hand. E. points to page and says, “All right. Go 
ahead. Hurry up!” At end of 1°/, minutes he says, “Stop! 
Turn over the page to Test 4.” 
Test 4.—Digit-Symbol 
“This is Test 4 here. Look.’’ After every one has found the 
page—“Now watch.” E. points to first digit of key on black- 
board and then points to the symbol under it. Same for all 
nine digits in key. E. then (1) points to first digit of sample, 
(2) to the empty space below digit, (3) points to corresponding 
digit of key, (4) points to proper symbol under digit in key, 
and (5) traces the outline of the proper symbol in the blank 
space under the digit in the sample. Same for first five samples. 
Demonstrator, at a gesture, fills in all the samples, working as 
follows: (1) Touches the number in first sample with index finger 
of right hand; (2) holding finger there, finds with index finger 
of left hand the ‘corresponding number in key; (3) drops index 
finger of left hand to symbol for number found; (4) holding 
left hand in this position writes appropriate symbol in the lower 
half of sample. 
Similarly with the other samples. While working, demon-
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
strator should stand as far as possible to the left, doing all the 
samples from this side. 
At the end of demonstration E. says, “Look, here” and points 
to key on page, repeating the gestures used in pointing on the 
blackboard at the beginning of the demonstration. Then, “All 
right. Go ahead. Hurry up!” Orderlies point out key to 
men who are at a loss to find it. At the end of 2 minutes, E. 
says, “Stop! But don’t turn the page.” 
Test 5.—Number Checking 
“This is Test 5 here. Look.’”’ After every one has found the 
page. “Now watch.” In this demonstration E. must try to get 
“Yes” or “No” responses from the group. If the wrong re- 
sponse is volunteered by group, E. points to digits again and 
gives right response, “Yes” or “No” as the case may be. E. 
points to first digit of first number in left column, then to first 
digit first number in right column, then to second digit first 
number in left column and second digit first number in right 
column, nods head, says “Yes” and makes an imaginary cross 
at end of number in right column. Motions to demonstrator, 
who makes an “X” there. E. does the same for second line 
of figures, but here he indicates clearly by shaking head and 
saying “No” that certain digits are not identical. E. repeats 
for three more sets and after each, looks at group, says “Yes?” 
in questioning tone and waits for them to say “Yes” or “No.” 
He repeats correct reply with satisfaction. Demonstrator 
checks each after group has responded, or at signal from E. 
if group does not respond. Demonstrator then works out 
remaining items, pointing from column to column and working 
deliberately. E. summarizes demonstrator’s work by pointing 
to the whole numbers in each set and saying ‘‘ Yes” (indicating 
X) or “No;” if “No,” he shows again where the numbers are 
unlike, E. then points to page and says “All right. Go ahead. 
Hurry up!” At the end of 3 minutes, E. says “Stop. Turn 
over the page to Test 6.”

  EXAMINER'S GUIDE 87 
Test 6.—Pictorial Completion 
“This is Test 6 here. Look. A lot of pictures.” After every 
one has found the page, “‘Now watch.”’ E. points to hand and 
says to demonstrator, “Fix it.’ Demonstrator does nothing, 
but looks puzzled. E. points to the picture of the hand, then 
to the place where finger is missing and says to demonstrator, 
“Fix it; Fix it.” Demonstrator then draws in finger. E. says, 
“That’s right.” E. then points to fish and place for eye and 
says, “Fix it.” After demonstrator has drawn missing eye. E. 
points to each of the four remaining drawings and says, “Fix 
them all.” Demonstrator works samples out slowly and with 
apparent effort. When the samples are finished E. says, “All 
right. Go ahead. Hurry up!” During the course of this test 
the orderlies walk around the room and locate individuals 
who are doing nothing, point to their pages, and say, “Fix it. 
Fix them,” trying to set everyone working. At end of 3 min- 
utes, E. says, “Stop! But don’t turn over the page.” 
Test 7.—Geometrical Construction 
“This is Test 7 here. Look.” After every one has found the 
page, “Now watch.” Examiner points to the first figure on 
blackboard: He then takes the two pieces of cardboard, fits 
them on to the similar drawings on blackboard to show that 
they correspond and puts them together in the square on black- 
board to show that they fill it. Then, after running his finger 
over the line of intersection of the parts, E. removes the pieces 
and signals demonstrator, who draws solution in the square on 
blackboard. The same procedure is repeated for the second 
and third sample. Demonstrator works out fourth sample, 
after much study, pointing from the square to the forms. 
Demonstrator first draws the two small squares in the upper 
half of the large square, then the two triangles in the remaining 
rectangle. Each small figure is drawn in by tracing its entire 
circumference, not merely the necessary dividing lines. While  
-P-A-G-E-102
r t 
88 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
drawing each small figure in the large square, demonstrator 
points with index finger of left hand to the corresponding small 
figure at left of square, taking care not to obstruct the view. 
At the end of demonstration E. holds up blank, points to each 
square on the page and says, “All right. Go ahead. Hurry 
up!” At end of 2'/, minutes, “Stop! Turn over the page.” 
Papers are then collected immediately. 
3. DIRECTIONS FOR SCORING 
General Rules 
1. In general, items evidently corrected stand as corrected. 
The only exception to this rule is in the maze test. 
2. In tests where the score is number right, only wrong items 
need be checked in scoring. In Test 5, where the score is right 
minus wrong, wrong and omitted items must be separately 
checked. 
8. Enter the score for each test in lower right-hand corner 
of the test page and encircle it. When the test has been re- 
scored a check may be made beside the circle. 
4, Red or blue pencil increases accuracy of scoring. 
Test 1 
1. One-half point for each correctly completed half of maze. 
A half maze is correct if drawn line does not cross any line of 
maze (except through awkwardness) nor an imaginary straight 
line across the opening of a wrong passage. 
2. Allow much leeway in the cutting of corners. 
8. Spur running into any blind passage counts wrong for 
that half-item, even though erased. 
4, When two lines are drawn, one straight across the page, the 
other correct, full credit is given. 
Test 2 
Score is number right.
-P-A-G-E-103
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 89 
Test 3 
1. Score is number right. 
2. Any incomplete item receives no credit. 
8. Count any item correct if intended plan is carried out. 
Disregard additional unnecessary marks, such as circles be- 
tween the crosses of items 2 and 4 in first part of line, ete. 
Test 4 
1. Score is one-third of number of correct symbols. 
2. Use leniency in judging form of symbol. 
3. Credit symbol for 2 even though reversed. 
Test 5 
1. Score is right minus wrong (number of items checked that 
should be checked minus number of items checked that should 
not be checked). 
2. If other clear indication is used instead of crosses, give 
credit. 
3. If numbers which should not be checked are marked by 
some other sign than is used to check similar pairs, count as 
though not marked. 
4. If all items are checked, the score for the test is zero. 
Test 6 
1. Score is number right. 
2. Allow much awkwardness in drawing. Writing in name 
of missing part or any way of indicating it receives credit, if 
idea is clear. 
8. Additional parts do not make item wrong, if proper missing 
part is also inserted. 
4, Rules for individual items: 
Item 4.—Any spoon at any angle in right hand receives credit. 
Left hand, or unattached spoon, no credit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  90 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
Item §—Chimney must be in right place. No credit for 
smoke. 
Item 6.—Another ear on same side as first receives no credit. 
Item 8.—Plain square, cross, ete., in proper location for stamp, 
receives credit. 
Item 10.—Missing part is the rivet. Line of “ear” may be 
omitted. 
Item 18.—Missing part is leg. 
Item 15.—Ball should be drawn in hand of man. If Tepre- 
sented in hand of woman, or in motion, no credit. 
Item 16.—Single line indicating net receives credit. 
Item 18.—Any representation intended for horn, pointing in 
any direction, receives credit. 
Item 19.—Hand and powder puff must be put on proper side. 
Item 20.—Diamond is the missing part. . Failure to complete 
hilt on sword is not an error. 
Test 7 
1. Score is number right. 
2. Allow considerable awkwardness in drawing. 
3. Extra subdivisions, if not erased, make item wrong. 
4. Rules for individual items: 
Item 1.—Line of division may be slightly distant from true 
center, and need not be straight. 
Item 3.—Lines of semi-circumference must start from or near 
corners of square. 
Item 4.—Line must not start from corner.

V.—INDIVIDUAL EXAMINATIONS 
1. GENERAL DIRECTIONS 
Purpose.—The main purpose of the individual examination 
is to secure a more accurate measurement of the mental ability 
of those who have made D— in alpha or beta, or in both. By 
the personal contact it allows it should also yield valuable sup- 
plementary information of a kind which cannot be brought out 
by a group examination. All the kinds of information secured 
should be considered in connection with recommendation con- 
cerning a man. 
The Subjects—Men who are likely to be summoned for in- 
dividual examination fall into three classes—literates, illiterates, 
and non-English speaking. Since the procedure of examination 
varies importantly with the class, the first task of the examiner 
is to assign the man who has reported for individual examina- 
tion to his proper category. The following definitions will 
assist in the process of classifying: 
Literates.—Those who have been allowed to take alpha may 
ordinarily be considered literate for purpose of individual ex- 
amination. Subjects who have not taken alpha may be con- 
sidered literate if they have completed the third grade (or its 
equivalent) in an American school. E. should question S. 
5 regarding his opportunities for schooling, and if necessary may 
test his ability to read and write English. 
Iiliterates are those who do not meet the above requirements, 
but who understand and speak English fairly well. The sub- 
ject may be highly literate in some language but illiterate in 
English. Such are to be classed as illiterate for the present 
purpose. 
Non-English-speaking subjects are those who, whether foreign
-P-A-G-E-107
LE Te eS ee eT eT eT ee 
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 93 
born or American born, are unable to understand or speak 
English sufficiently well to take an oral examination given in 
English. The majority of such subjects are foreigners, but 
many foreigners belong in either the literate or the illiterate 
class instead of in the non-English speaking. 
Choice of Examination.—Literates should be examined by 
means of the point scale or the Stanford-Binet scale according 
to availability of materials and preference of the examiner. 
Usually it will not be necessary to give a literate subject fur- 
ther examination, but if the examiner is in doubt as to proper 
rating and recommendation concerning subject, he should, after 
completing examination by the one or the other of these scales, 
supplement his observations by giving such performance tests 
as seem desirable. 
Iiliterates should be examined by means of one or more of the 
following systematic procedures: (a) the point scale as adapted 
for illiterates: (b) the Stanford-Binet scale as adapted for 
illiterates; (c) the performance scale with oral instructions. In 
certain instances it may be obviously desirable or necessary to 
use the performance scale in addition to the one or the other 
adapted scale. Asa rule it should be unnecessary to use other 
than either the point scale or Stanford-Binet (complete or 
adapted) in the case of a subject who has attended an American 
school as much as four or five years. Inability to read and 
write after that amount of schooling nearly always indicates 
grave mental inferiority, and should not be considered an excuse 
for failure on such tests as writing from dictation, counting 
backward, making change, etc. Those who are illiterate from 
complete lack of educational opportunity should be given the 
performance scale. 
Non-English-speaking subjects can be examined safely only 
by means of the performance scale with non-verbal instructions, 
Those subjects who understand English slightly may profit by 
the use of such words as “no,” “yes,” ete. For this reason 
words may be used by the examiner to supplement his gestures,  
-P-A-G-E-108
94 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
but they must not be depended upon as a means of conveying 
the idea of what is to be done in a given test. 
The duration and extent of an individual examination should 
depend upon the nature of the case and should vary with the 
information necessary for safe report and recommendation. In 
some instances only a few tests need be given, in others, even 
a prolonged examination may leave the examiner in doubt con- 
cerning suitable recommendation, and may force him to appeal 
to company commander or others for supplementary informa- 
tion. Unless conditions render haste imperative, the examiner 
should obtain a definite intelligence rating for each subject in 
terms of mental age. 
Condensed instructions for administering the point scale and 
the Stanford-Binet scale are printed in this guide for the con- 
venience of examiners, but these instructions can be used safely 
only on the basis of thorough knowledge of the detailed de- 
scriptions of these two scales which are available in book form. 
The performance scale is fully described in this guide, since its 
constituent parts and their standardization are newly chosen 
and especially adapted for army use. 
It is the task of the psychological examiner to obtain reliable 
intelligence ratings and to make recommendations based there- 
upon. Where serious mental peculiarities or psychopathic 
conditions are discovered, full report should be made and the 
subject promptly referred to the psychiatrist with such informa- 
tion as the psychological examination has supplied. 
The Examiner’s Recommendations.—As a result of careful 
psychological examination, the examiner may conclude, (1) that 
the subject should be assigned or returned to appropriate mili- 
tary organization for regular training; (2) that he should be 
assigned or transferred to the Development Battalion or to a 
service organization in which simple forms of manual labor are 
the chief requirement; (3) that he should be recommended to 
the psychiatrist for discharge by reason of intellectual deficiency; 
(4) that he should be referred to the psychiatrist for further   
-P-A-G-E-109
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 95 
examination because of peculiarities of behavior or definite 
psychopathic tendencies. 
It is impossible to state with safety the particular degree of 
intellectual deficiency which justifies recommendation for dis- 
charge. Other factors than intelligence contribute to a man’s 
serviceableness in the Army. These must be taken into account. 
If the officers who are attempting to train a man are satisfied 
with his responses, the indications are that he should not be 
discharged, even if very inferior in intelligence. In general, 
~ subjects whose mental age is below eight should be seriously con- 
sidered for discharge or Development Battalion. Those whose 
mental ages range from eight to ten should be considered for use 
in special service organizations or for assignment to Development 
Battalion. All others, except those whose psychotic symptoms 
would cause their immediate reference to the neuro-psychiatric 
examiner, should be assigned to regular training organizations. 
Grade E shall be given to all men who are recommended by 
the examiner for discharge, Development Battalion, or service 
organizations, and to such men only.. All men whose intelligence 
is deemed satisfactory for regular military duty shall be given 
rating of D — or higher. 
In this connection too great emphasis cannot be laid upon 
the use of common sense as well as technical skill and informa- 
tion by the psychological examiner. While doing his utmost to 
obtain reliable measurement of mental traits, he should be 
quick to observe indications of qualities of physique, tempera- 
ment, and character which are important in the soldier.

66 of the Examiner’s Guide are omitted here because of copy= 
right restrictions. 
(b) ADAPTATION FOR USE WITH ILLITERATES 
In the examination of an illiterate. subject only those tests 
in each year-group which are starred in the record blank

Intelligence,” Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston.

should be given.! When only the starred tests are given, credits 
should be assigned in accordance with the following table: 
Years 3 to 10.......:. 3 points (or months) per test. 
5 points (or months) per test. 
6 points (or months) per test. 
.. 7% points (or months) per test. 
9 points (or months) per test. 
     The probable error of a mental age score derived by the scale 
as thus abbreviated is approximately 714 months, as contrasted 
with a probable error of less than 6 months for the unabbre- 
viated scale as applied to unselected adults. 
(c) EXPRESSING AND INTERPRETING RESULTS 
As this is an age scale, the responses are ordinarily scored in 
terms of months. They may also be scored in terms of points 
by those who prefer this method. When this is done, each test 
is given a point value corresponding to its value in months. A 
subject is credited with the full number of points for each test 
below the year-group actually given, and in addition with 24 
points for years 1 and 2. He is also credited with the actual 
number of points scored in the year-groups given. It is thus 
possible to score as high as 30 points (months) in year XVI 
and 36 in year XVIII, making a total possible score of 234 
points, or a mental age of 19 years, 6 months. If fewer than 
the regular number of tests are uscd from a given year-group, 
each test should be assigned a proportionately higher point 
value. If more than the regular number are used, each test 
should be assigned a proportionately lower value. Where half 
credit is allowed for a response, half the number of points is 
given. ’ 
The results of Stanford-Binet examinations are to be expressed 
in the following ways: (1) Mental age in years and decimal of a 
year; (2) letter rating.

  Subjects obtaining a score of 10 years (120 points) or more 
may ordinarily be recommended for regular military training; 
subjects between 8 and 10 years (96 to 119 points) should be 
considered for assignment to service organization or Develop- 
ment Battalion; subjects below 8 years (96 points) should be 
considered for discharge. 
Grade E should be given to all men who are recommended 
by the examiner for discharge, Development Battalion, or 
service organization, and to such men only. All men whose in- 
telligence is deemed satisfactory for regular military duty shall 
be given rating of D— or higher. 
4, PERFORMANCE SCALE EXAMINATION 
(a) PROCEDURE 
Test 1.—The Ship Test 
Materials——A frame and ten pieces which, when properly 
fitted together, form a ship. 
Directions—E. shows 8. the frame with the pieces properly 
fitted therein, and says: “This is a picture of a ship. Look at it 
carefully.” §. is allowed to look at the picture for 10 seconds; 
then E. withdraws the picture from view, removes the pieces, 
and presents the empty frame and the pieces arranged as in 
Fig. 13 (1).* 
* The figure numbers of the “Guide” appear in parenthesis.
-P-A-G-E-115
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 101 
The pieces may be numbered on the edge toward E. from left 
to right to indicate their positions. The frame is next the sub- 
Ficure 13 (1). 
ject. E. says: “Put these pieces in the frame as quickly as you 
can so as to make the ship you just saw.” 
8. is given five minutes, and is allowed to make any changes 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
he wishes within the time limit; but E. must not suggest the 
changes. 
Scoring.—A score of one is allowed for each of the lower or 
upper pieces, if placed in the lower or upper portion of the frame, 
i. e., the “water” pieces at the bottom and the “sky” pieces 
at the top, except that no credit is given for an inverted piece. 
In addition to this, a score of one is given to each piece that is 
in its correct relative position in the upper or lower row. The 
maximum score for accuracy is thus 20 points. 
If the score for accuracy is 18 or more, additional credit is 
given for time as follows: 
Time Credit 
  The maximum raw score is, therefore, 25 points. 
Test 2.—Manikin and Feature Profile 
1 
Materials.—(a) Six pieces which when put together represent 
the conventional figure of a man. 
(b) Eight pieces which when put together form the figure of 
a human head. 
Directions.—(a) The pieces are placed before S., as in Fig. 
14 (2). Each arm and each leg is placed at the opposite side 
of the body from the place where it fits. E. says, “Put this 
together as quickly as you can.” 
(b) The pieces are placed before S., as in Fig. 14 (2). The 
three pieces forming the face are separated from each other by 
the four pieces forming the ear. E. says, “Put this together as 
quickly as you can.” 
The time limit for (a) is two minutes, for (b) five minutes.

(6) One point for each face piece in correct position, 1 point for a 
partly correct ear—i. e., one, two, or three pieces in the correct 
place—and 2 points for a completely correct ear, making a total 
for accuracy of 5 points. 
Credit is given for time only if the score for accuracy is on 
(a) 4 or 5 points, on (b) 5 points. Then credit as follows:

31- 50 
51-120 
  The maximum raw score is, therefore, 20 points on (a) and 
(b) together. 
Test 3.—Cube Imitation 
Materials——(1) Four 1-inch cubes fastened 2 inches apart to 
a wooden base. Both cubes and base are painted a dark red. 
The cubes are numbered 1 to 4 from right to left. (2) A fifth
-P-A-G-E-119
EXAMINER'S GUIDE 105 
cube of the same size unattached and similarly painted. 
(3) Ten imitation problems (a to 7), as printed on the record 
sheet. 
. Directions —E. places the cube board before 8., with the 
numbered side of the cubes directed away from him, and says: 
“Watch carefully and then do just what I do.” EE. next with the 
fifth cube taps the attached blocks in a predetermined order, 
as, for example, in (a) 1—2—3—4, at the rate of one per second. 
He now lays the tapping cube down before S., midway between 
the second and third cubes, but nearer to S. than the cube 
board, and says: “Do that.” If in the first problem S. taps 
4—3—2—1 instead of the reverse, E. credits the response and 
says: ‘No, begin here” (pointing to 1). 
Parts (6) to (j) are given in order unless S. fails in 5 successive 
parts. In this event the test is discontinued. It is important 
that the rate of tapping should not be faster than one per second. 
Scoring.—The responses are recorded as right (++) or wrong 
(—); and 1 point is given for each success. The maximum raw 
score is 10 points. 
Test 4.—Cube Construction 
Materials.—(1) A block of wood (model 1) 1 by 3 by 3 inches, 
painted a dark red on the four sides, not on the upper or lower 
surfaces, and cut to a depth of 2 mm., so that it closely resembles 
a composite of 9 small cubes. (2) Nine 1-inch cubes necessary 
for the construction of model 1, four painted on two sides, four 
painted on one side, and one not painted. (3) A block of wood 
(model 2), same size as model 1 but painted on the top as well 
as the four sides. (4) Nine l-inch cubes necessary for con- 
struction of model 2. (5) A 2-inch cube (model 3), unpainted 
and cut on the six surfaces so that it looks like a composite of 
eight small cubes. (6) Eight 1-inch cubes painted on three 
sides for the construction of model 3. 
Directions —E. presents model 1, and says: “You see this 
block. Notice that it is painted on the sides but not on the top or   
-P-A-G-E-120
106 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
the bottom; and you see these smaller blocks [E. presents blocks 
described under (2), above] partly painted and partly unpainted. 
These nine blocks can be put together so as to make one just like 
this.’ EE. puts the blocks together, pointing to the painted 
surface or surfaces of each cube as he fits it in position. 
(a) E. then presents the same model and blocks in irregular 
order, and says: “Now, you fit the blocks together so as to make 
one like this.” 
(b) E. now presents model 2 and the blocks for its construc- 
tion and says: “Now, put these blocks together so as to make one 
just like this. Notice that it is painted on the edges and on the 
top but not on the bottom.” 
(c) E. presents model 3 and says: “‘ You see this block; notice 
that it is not painted anywhere; and you see these smaller blocks 
[present blocks described under (6) above] that have three sides 
painted and three not painted. Now, I want you to fit these eight 
blocks together so as to make one just like this. Remember, it is 
not painted on the bottom, top, or sides.” 
With a stop watch E. takes time in seconds for assembling 
the cubes. He also counts the number of moves. A move is 
to be understood as a placement in some position designed ‘to 
complete the structure. If parts of a structure are assembled 
separately, putting such parts together does not count an addi- 
tional move. If the blocks are fitted together in the hand, the 
moves are counted just as they are if assembled on the table. 
Turning a block over or otherwise shifting its position in the 
structure is counted a move, but turning it over in the fingers, 
picking it up, and placing it upon the table are not to be counted 
moves. §. is penalized sufficiently for such behavior by the 
longer time. 
Time for work on each part, two minutes. If S. assembles 
blocks before time is up, allow spontaneous corrections, count- 
ing extra time and additional moves. Each block changed 
counts one move as before. The time should be taken when 
8. indicates verbally or otherwise that he has finished.

  No matter whether S. has finished or not, count each mis- 
placed block as three additional moves and each unassembled 
block as six additional moves, and credit total moves as follows:

Note that the minimum number of moves is nine for (a) and 
(6), and eight for (c); that no credit is given for over 50 moves; 
and that the maximum raw score is 10 points for each part, 
or a total of 30. 
Test 5.—Form Board 
Materials—See illustration of problems, Fig. 15 (8), for 
identification of the materials. ; 
Directions.—E. places the board before S., arranged as shown 
in “demonstration.” ‘EE.’ and “S.” in this figure indicate the 
relative positions of examiner and subject. E. says: “ These 
blocks can be changed around so.as to make room for this extra 
square, like this.” EE. proceeds to solve the problem in the 
minimum number of moves, making sure that 8. is attending.

(b) E. now presents the board arranged for problem B, say-
-P-A-G-E-123
  EXAMINER’S GUIDE 109 
ing: “I want you to change these blocks around so you can find 
places for these two extra squares (pointing to them). Ready— 
go ahead.” 
(c) E. presents the board arranged for problem C, saying: 
“Now I want you to change the blocks around so you can find 
places for these four extra blocks. Ready—go ahead.” 
E. records the time in seconds from start to finish, and counts 
the number of moves. A move is to be understood as placing or 
trying to place a block in some position on the board. Taking a 
block out of position, and placing a block upon the table are 
not counted as moves. 
Time for work on (a) and (6), two minutes each; on (c), three 
minutes. If (a) is not solved in the time allowed, E. demon- 
strates that correct solution before going on to (0). 
Scoring.—If a problem is not solved within the time limit, 
score that part 0; but ¢f @ correct solution has been accomplished, 
give credit for time and for moves as follows:

Note that the minimum number of moves for problems (a), 
(b), and (c) is 8, 5, and 8, respectively, and that the maximum 
raw scores are 8, 8, and 10, or a total of 26 points. 
The examiner will find it advantageous to make a diagram of 
the arrangement of the blocks for each problem, as in Fig. 15 (8), 
and paste it on the screen between him and the subject. He 
can then copy the pattern on the board out of view of the 
subject, and with a little practice, can do it very expeditiously— 
often in less than 30 seconds.

Test 6.—Designs 
Materials.—The five plates of designs on pp. 143 to 152. E. 
provides S. with pencil and paper. 
Directions.—The designs are given in order, (a), (6), (c), (d). 
Formula for (a) and (b): “I am going to show you a drawing. 
You will have just ten seconds to look at it; then I shall take it 
away and let you draw it from memory. Don’t begin to draw till 
I say ‘go.’” 
Formula for (c) and (d): “This time I shall show you two 
drawings. You will have only ten seconds to look at them, then I 
shall ues them away and you are to draw them both from 
memory.” 
Before exposing st designs, E. says: ‘Ready; look closely.” 
When designs are removed, E. says: “Go.” Designs are ex- 
posed with greatest length of page horizontal, and with front 
of Guide toward E. The time limit is 2 minutes, but S. is 
not stopped or penalized if he appears to have the correct plan 
and is carrying it out. If the raw score on (a), (b), and (c) to- 
gether is less than 3, (d) need not be given. 
Scoring.—Emphasis is put upon reproduction of the plan of 
the designs rather than upon the neatness of the drawing.

Test 7.—The Digit Symbol Test 
Materials—See page 3 of record blank. Page 290, this 
book. 
Directions.—The part of the first row marked sample is used 
for demonstration. E. says: ‘You see these numbers and the 
little mark below each number (pointing to the row at the top of 
the page). Now, I want you to put in each one of these squares 
(pointing to the empty squares in the three rows) the little mark 
that ought to go there, like this: Below 2 put this little mark (be- 
ginning at 2 in the sample), below 1, this; below 3, this;” etc.
-P-A-G-E-127
   EXAMINER’S GUIDE 113 
After doing five of the samples E. pauses and asks: “Now, 
what should I put here?” (indicating the next empty square). 
If 8. answers correctly, E. finishes the samples himself; if 8. 
fails, E. tells him and repeats the question with the next sample. 
After finishing the demonstration, E. says: ‘Now, you begin 
here and fill as many squares as you can before I call time.” 
Time, 2 minutes. 
Scoring.—The score is the number of squares filled correctly 
in the time limit. Maximum raw score, 67 points. 
Test 8.—The Maze 
Materials.—The four mazes (a), (b), (c), and (d) on page 4 of 
the record blank and maze (a) on page 3 for demonstration. 
Directions—E. shows S. demonstration maze and says: “ You 
see these lines. Now, I am going to begin here at S and mark 
with my pencil the shortest way out without crossing any lines. 
Watch carefully.” E. places sheet so that the bottom of the 
maze is toward S., and traces the way out, calling attention 
to the possibility of taking the wrong path at one or two of the 
critical points. E. says: “You see, if I should go this way, it 
would not be the shortest way out. I should have to turn back.” 
E. then presents test maze (a) on page 4 and says: “Now, with 
your pencil begin at S and mark the shortest way out as quickly 
as you can. Do not cross any lines and do not turn back unless 
you have to. Ready—Go ahead.” 
If S. crosses a line, not through carelessness, E. says: “ You 
have crossed a line here. You see it is not an open space. Begin 
here (indicating a point on the pencil mark just before it crossed 
the line) and see if you can find a path out without crossing any 
lines.” In scoring, S. is penalized 1 point for each line crossed 
as above. 
Mazes (b), (c), and (d) should be presented in the same way 
as (a) except that no further demonstration is allowed. Time 
limit for each maze, 2 minutes. If the score on (a) and (6) is 0, 
the test may be discontinued.

  Scoring.—Time is recorded in seconds from start signal to 
successful exit. If this occurs within the time limit, credit for 
time is given for each maze as follows: 
Time Credit 
  Whether S. finishes in the time limit or not, credit is given 
for the degree of success he has attained as follows: Each maze

is divided into five successive steps, which are indicated by 
dotted lines crossing the path of the maze in the key maze, 
Fig. 17 (5). A credit of 1 point is given for each step success- 
fully accomplished; i. e., for each imaginary dotted line crossed, 
making a total of 5 points for each maze. The openings of all 
blind alleys are indicated by heavy black lines across the path 
of the maze. A penalty of 1 point is given for each imaginary 
heavy line crossed. Thus the score equals the number of dotted 
lines crossed minus the number of heavy lines crossed, and maze 
lines crossed not through carelessness (see above). Any negative 
score thus obtained counts as zero. (No matter how many 
times any dotted line or heavy line is crossed, only one credit 
or penalty is given therefor.) 
Maximum raw score, 32 points. 
Test 9.—Picture Arrangement 
Materials.—Five sets of ‘Foxy Grandpa” pictures, Figure 18, 
one set for demonstration, and four for actual tests. 
Directions —E. presents demonstrational set (x) in a row in 
the order 4—2—6—3—1—5 and says: “These pictures tell a 
funny story if they are placed in the right order.’ EE. then pro- 
ceeds to arrange the pictures properly, telling the story as he 
does so, and calling subject’s attention to the proper sequence 
of the important details. He next removes this set, and presents 
set (a), saying: “Now see how quickly you can change these pic- 
tures around so as to make them tell a good story.” 8. is not told 
if he is wrong, but E. goes on to the next set. - Sets (b) to (d) 
are presented in the same way. The sets are shown in a row 
in the order 4—2—6—3—1—5 and 5—1—3—6—2—4 alter- 
nately. The time limit for each set is three minutes. 
Scoring.—. records the time and the arrangement for each 
set; and gives a credit of 1 point for each pair of pictures in 
correct juxtaposition, i. e., a maximum of 5 points for accuracy 
for each set. When, however, the error in arrangement con-

  116 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
sists only in the reversal of one, two, or three juxtaposed pairs, 
a penalty of 1 point is given for each such reversal. Thus a 
credit of 4 points is obtained for arrangement 1—2—4—3—5—6,

Materials—Two boards upon which are depicted successive 
scenes from the day’s activity of a boy; and 60 small blocks 
from which are selected the pieces to complete the pictures, 
Figure 19.

box arranged in a predetermined order as indicated in the box. 
In this arrangement ambiguous pieces are located in the same 
area. E. says: “Here is a picture—it begins here (pointing to 
demonstration picture) where the boy is getting dressed. It 
shows the same boy—remember, the very same boy—doing one 
thing after another during the same day. (E. points along first 
row and then along second to indicate the sequence in which 
the pictures come.) You see in each picture a piece is missing.

Here are a lot of small pieces. They go into the empty places. 
You are to pick out the piece that you think is needed, that is best 
to make the picture right. For example, what is gone here?” 
(pointing to demonstration picture). If S. answers correctly, 
E. says “That's fine. Now see if you can find the best piece for 
each of the other places.” If S. does not answer correctly, E. finds 
the piece for him, explains why it is right, and then says: “Now 
see, etc.—” as above. E. gives no help after the first explanation, 
but S. is allowed to change pieces if he wishes. When §. in- 
dicates that he has finished as well as he can, time is recorded. 
The time limit is 10 minutes. 
Scoring.—No credit is given for time, but the very slow are 
indirectly penalized by not finishing in the time limit. The 
scoring of the performance is indicated in the accompanying 
table. When a square is left unfilled, the score for that item 
is 0. Negative score on the entire test counts as zero. 
Maximum raw score, 100. 
(b) PROCEDURE FOR NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING SUBJECTS 
E. should take care that his directions do not appear too 
artificial, For this reason he should not always remain ab- 
solutely silent. He should try to use whatever words are in- 
telligible to his subject. “No,” “Yes,” “Hurry,” etc., can be 
used in most cases; and even when §. does not understand, it 
is often better for E. to speak as well as gesture. The aim here 
is only to make the instructions intelligible apart from the 
language used. 
Test 1.—The Ship Test 
E. shows §. the frame with the pieces properly fitted therein. 
After S. looks at picture for 10 seconds, E. withdraws picture, 
removes pieces and presents the empty frame and the pieces 
arranged as in Fig. 13 (1). E. points in order to S., to the 
pieces, to the frame, and nods affirmatively. If S. does not 
understand, E. repeats.
-P-A-G-E-135
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 121 
Test 2,—Manikin and Feature Profile 
E. places pieces before S. as previously described. Then 
points to S., to pieces, nods affirmatively, and sweeps hands 
together over pieces to indicate that they are to be assembled. 
This may be repeated. If 8. does not understand, or if pieces 
are not properly assembled in the time limit, E. demonstrates 
part (a) and goes on to (6). 
Test 3.—Cube Imitation 
E. places the cube board before S. as previously described; 
then taps the first imitation problem slowly, puts down the 
tapping cube, points to S., and nods affirmatively. If 8. fails 
to understand, E. repeats; if he begins at the wrong end, E. 
shakes head negatively, points to the first cube, and repeats 
the problem. E. should make sure he has subject’s attention 
before tapping any problem. 
Test 4.—Cube Construction 
(a) E. presents model 1 and the corresponding blocks, points 
to bottom, top, and sides of model; then places it upon the table 
and assembles the blocks rather slowly, turning each block over 
in the fingers and pointing to painted and unpainted sides. 
E. now presents the same model and the blocks in irregular 
order, then points in order to 8., to the model, to the blocks, 
and nods affirmatively. E. repeats, if S. does not understand. 
(b) E. presents model 2 with the nine blocks for its construc- 
tion; shows S. bottom, top, and sides of model; then places it 
upon the table, points to §., to the model, to the blocks, and 
nods affirmatively. E. repeats gestures, if 8. does not under- 
stand. 
(c) E. presents model 3, turns it over slowly, showing each 
side, presents blocks, picks up a block, points to painted side, 
shakes head, points to unpainted side, nods, puts down block, 
points to §., to model, and to blocks, nods affirmatively. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
Test 5.—Form Board | 
E. places board before 8. as previously described, points to 
square and to empty spaces, and proceeds slowly to change 
blocks and put in square. E. next removes board, rearranges 
it for problem (a), and again presents it to S. He then points 
to S., to square, and to board, nodding affirmatively. If 8. 
does not understand, E. repeats gestures; and if problem is not 
solved in the time limit he again demonstrates the correct 
solution and passes on to (b). Problems (b) and (c) are pre- 
sented in the same way except that they are not demonstrated 
in case of §.’s failure. 
Test 6.—Designs 
E. shows 8. demonstrational design («) for 10 seconds. Then 
he takes it away and draws it for S. He now shows test design 
(a) for 10 seconds; then takes it away, gives S. pencil and paper, 
points to S., to paper, nods affirmatively. If S. does not re- 
spond, E. draws it for him, then passes on to (b). Designs (0), 
(c), and (d) are presented in the same way except that E. does 
not demonstrate further. 
Test 7.—Digit Symbol 
E. shows &. the record sheet, points to blank below 2 in the 
sample, then to symbol for 2 at top of page, writes in symbol, 
proceeds in the same way with the other parts of the sample, 
then gives S. pencil, points to space below 3 in the test, and 
nods affirmatively. 
Test 8.—The Maze 
E. shows 8. demonstration maze (a), and with his pencil pro- 
ceeds to trace the shortest way out. At critical points he hesi- 
tates, moves pencil in wrong direction without marking, shakes 
his head, and continues to work in the right direction. He 
next presents test maze A, gives S. pencil, points to starting
-P-A-G-E-137
   EXAMINER’S GUIDE 123 
point and to exit of maze, and nods affirmatively. If 8. fails 
to understand, E. demonstrates again with maze A and passes 
on to (b). Mazes (6), (c), and (d) are presented in the same 
way, but no more demonstration is given. 
Test 9.—Picture Arrangement 
E. presents demonstrational set and allows S. to see it for 
about 15 seconds. Then, making sure that S. is attending, he 
slowly rearranges the pictures and points to each one in succes- 
sion, attracting subject’s attention especially to the sequence 
of important details. Next E. removes these pictures and pre- 
sents set (a), points to 8., and moves his hand about the pictures 
to indicate that they are to be arranged. If 8. does not under- 
stand, E. shows him the proper arrangement and then goes on 
to set (b). Sets (b), (c), and (d) are presented in the same way 
as (a), except that no further demonstration is given if S. fails. 
Test 10.—Picture Completion 
E. places material before 8. as previously described. He 
then slowly points to the same boy in each of the pictures in 
succession to indicate the proper sequence of events. He next 
returns to the demonstrational picture, points to dressed and 
undressed foot and to empty space. Next he looks leisurely 
over the small blocks, tries the slipper or the low shoe in the 
space, points to dressed foot, and shakes his head negatively. 
Then he puts in the correct piece showing satisfaction with 
result. Finally, he points in order to picture 1, to S., to small 
blocks, and to the empty space in the picture, and nods affirma- 
tively. If S. does not understand, E. repeats. 
(c) DIRECTIONS FOR USING RECORD BLANK 
In general, the subject is’ given credit for both speed and 
accuracy or degree of success; and the record blank is designed

             to convert time and accuracy measurements into points of 
credit without delay or inconvenience. 
As soon as 8. has completed tests 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, or 9, or any 
part of any one of them, E. checks the space containing the. 
figures which include the subject’s time. In tests 1, 2, and 9, 
he next scores the performance for accuracy; and, if the condi- 
tions for crediting time are fulfilled, he adds the credit below 
the time checked to the credit for accuracy and records the 
sum in the column marked “score.” In tests 4 and 5, E. also 
checks the space which includes the number of moves; and, if 
the conditions for crediting are fulfilled, he adds the credit 
below time checked to the credit below moves checked and 
records the sum in the column marked ‘“‘score,’”’ as above. In 
test 8 time is checked and the credit for time added to the 
credit for success, etc., as before. The abbreviations T. L. in 
these tests means “time limit”; and this space is checked only 
when §. is actually stopped before the test or part of the test 
is completed. 
In test 3, E. records the response only when it is incorrect; 
but always writes + or — in the proper column. In test 10, 
the number on the back of the block selected for a given picture 
is written below the number of the picture, and the credit for 
that part is written in the next space below. If no block is 
selected for any given picture, E. leaves that space blank. Tests 
6 and 7 require no explanation. 
The score for each part of tests 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 are written 
in the column marked “score”; and then these part scores are 
totalled below the heavy line, except in test 2, where the total 
for the two parts is merely written at the foot of the space for 
score. In all other tests only the total score for the test is 
written in the “score” column. 
(d) DIRECTIONS FOR WEIGHTING PERFORMANCE SCALE SCORES 
The raw score for each of the*10 tests is converted into a 
weighted or equalized score, which is entered on the perform-
-P-A-G-E-139
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 125 
ance-scale record blank and on the psychological record card 
in the column headed: ‘‘Wtd. score.” This weighted score is 
obtained by means of the accompanying table. In the table 
all the possible raw scores for each test are listed in columns 
bearing the number of the test. The weighted scores corre- 
sponding are listed in the columus under the letter “W” at 
either side of the page. For example, to convert a raw score, 
in test 1, into a weighted score, look at the column under 
figure 1, find the raw score, and take the score in either column 
W. which is on the same line. 
sponding to the raw score 19, in test 1, is 13. The weighted 
score corresponding to the raw score 35, in test 7, is 15, ete.

(e) AN ABBREVIATED PERFORMANCE SCALE 
If time does not permit the giving of the complete perform- 
ance scale, a short scale selected from tests 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 
8 may be used. These tests must be given in the following 
order: 7, 6, 2, 4, 8, 1, 3 (or 3, 1). After each test is given E. 
should compute the weighted score obtained by 8S. up to that 
point; and he may discontinue the examination after the first 
test, if the score is 14 or more; after the second, if it is 22; after 
the third, if it is 27; and after the fourth, if it is 32. The fifth 
test should be given if the score on four tests is less than 32; 
but only very rarely need more than five tests be used. 
If 8. is absolutely illiterate (whether American or foreign 
born), E. should begin with test 6 instead of 7, and follow the 
same procedure. 
If the examination is discontinued after the first test, 8. 
should be rated D (C —, if the score is 21 or more) and as a 
rule recommended for regular service. If two or more tests 
are given, a final score should be obtained by finding the average 
for the tests actually given and multiplying by 10. The letter 
rating for this score can then be read from the table of norms 
for the short scale. If eight or more tests are given, the norms 
for the long scale should be used

ice organization, and to such men only. All men whose intelli- 
gence is deemed satisfactory for regular military duty shall be 
given rating of D— or higher. : 
Subjects obtaining a score of 100 points or more (short scale) 
may ordinarily be recommended for regular military training; 
subjects obtaining 40 to 99 points should be considered for 
assignment to service organization_or Development Battalion; 
those below 40 points should ordinarily be considered for 
discharge. 
5. MECHANICAL-SKILL TEST 
The mechanical test is intended for use (1) in aiding decision 
in doubtful cases under individual consideration, and (2) as a 
special test of mechanical skill. 
Materials—One set mechanical test (Stenquist), single 
series 1.* 
Instructions.—Place the open box before 8. with the cover 
toward him. Say, “Here are some things that have been taken 
apart. You are to put them together. Begin here [pointing to A]; 
take the parts and put them together so that the thing will work. 
* Consists of ten small mechanical objects taken apart. Each set of 
pieces is placed in a separate compartment. The objects are in order of 
use: wrench, chain, paper clip, bicycle bell, coin holder, clothespin, “shut- 
off,’’ push button, lock, and mousetrap.
-P-A-G-E-143
EXAMINER’S GUIDE 129 
Then go on to this one [pointing to B]; then to the next, and so on. 
If you come to one that seems very hard, go on to the next one, and 
af there is time later try it again. The more things you get done 
the larger your score. Ready—Go.” 
Time for the entire test, 30 minutes. 
Scoring.—Give 10 points for the complete and correct as- 
sembling of each object. Total possible score, 100. 
If the assembling of any object is only partially correct, give 
partial credit, according to the schedule. A list of the possible 
steps in the assembling is given for each object. Note in each 
case of partial solution which steps have been completed, and 
give credit for each step as indicated. The items included in a 
brace are alternative reactions, therefore give credit of only 
one number of points from any brace. 
It will be noted in D, for example, that, failing only to screw 
cover on, 8. gets but 6 points, while screwing the cover on 
counts but 1 point. The additional 3 points of penalty are for 
lack of “workability.” If any step is omitted in the solution 
of any object except E, then item of “workability” is consid- 
ered as lacking. In E, however, credit of 2 points is given for 
workability if the solution is correct except only 2 sides snapped 
or caps out of order, or both. 
In case of the lock, the spring is properly inserted when the 
bend is hooked over the projection in the frame to prevent 
slipping. By “Spring inserted workably”’ is meant one of the 
three other workable positions in which it is possible to place 
the spring, but which make no use of the bend. 
In the case of the mousetrap, by “‘in slot” is meant that the 
long arm of the spring is inserted in the slot of the U-shaped 
band. By “Right way,” reference is made to the direction in 
which the U-shaped band snaps. A “weak snap” is occasioned 
by having the spring or springs inverted. If one spring is more 
nearly correctly inserted than the other, count best one; that 
is, give credit for the best spring, and for that only, except in 
the last case.

APPENDIX C.—BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT 
Following authorization by the Secretary of War for con- 
struction in each camp of special psychology building, it was 
decided to secure, wherever possible, the assignment of small 
barracks building, and to remodel the same for psychological 
use. Suitable building for psychological examining has been 
designated in many of the divisional training camps. In others, 
temporary arrangements have been effected. For the use of 
the school of military psychology, Medical Officers’ Training 
Camp, Fort Oglethorpe, Ga., a special psychology building has 
been constructed. 
In general, it is desirable that building for psychological 
examining be located conveniently near receiving and exam- 
ining station of camp, and if possible also near the personnel 
office and the office of the camp surgeon and psychiatrist. 
Where there is a depot brigade the building should be either 
in or near the same. Since the psychologist will have important 
functions in connection with the development battalion, it also 
should be considered in selecting location for psychological 
work, 
For the information of examiners and their guidance in select- 
ing and planning for the remodeling of such building as they 
may secure for their work, the plans of special psychology 
building are reproduced herewith. 
In planning modifications for any assigned building, it is well 
to keep in mind the fact that other uses than psychological 
examining will be found for the psychological building. In 
the original plan it was intended that the Division of Psychiatry 
should also have an office in the building and, where necessary, 
sufficient examining space for individual examinations and con- 
sultation. In certain of the camps plans are already on foot 
to use this building for medical conferences, for conferences 
between psychiatrists, psychologists, and line officers, for ad- 
dresses to the line officers on morale, and for discussions and
-P-A-G-E-152
  188 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
conferences on methods of instruction, and training of the new 
recruit. 
The first floor of the original building was planned to contain 
alpha and beta examining rooms and a storeroom for heavy 
materials. The alpha examining room was planned to seat on 
the floor 160 to 200 men. This room was without benches, but 
the necessary space for each man is marked out roughly by 
lines running crosswise of the length of the room. These lines 
were spaced 3 feet apart. Since the men were to be seated on 
the floor or on small wicker mats, it was deemed desirable to 
make the floor of this room of double thickness. A small 
reading stand with shelves was planned for the large examining 
room. The small examining room, or beta room, was planned 
to seat between 60 and 100 men. A bench designed for this 
room, with its partitions and other measurements, is shown in 
Fig. 23 (8). It was also deemed desirable to have in this room 
a raised platform, about 18 inches high, from which the demon- 
strations could be more easily seen from the back of the room. 
A bank of lights so arranged as to illuminate the beta black- 
board will be found essential on cloudy days. Cross-lights 
should be avoided. Lights in alpha room should barely clear 
the tallest men. 
The storeroom should have built-in shelves sufficient to enable 
the examiner to unpack at least one week’s supply of the neces- 
sary examining materials. Similar shelves should be planned 
for the scoring room, record room, office, and small storeroom. 
Shelves in the record room can be made wider than usual shelv- 
ing, so that if long, narrow boxes are built to contain the record 
cards they may be placed lengthwise across these shelves. Other 
necessary changes are indicated on the plan. 
A certain amount of furniture, either built by the construc- 
tion quartermaster or supplied through the camp quartermaster 
upon requisition, is indicated in the plan. Examiners should 
have on hand at least 250 strips of beaver board 12 by 18 inches, 
wicker mats for the alpha examining room, if possible, and a

sufficient supply of wall hooks for overcoats and hats of those 
being examined. Each of the individual rooms on the second 
floor should be supplied with small tables. In addition, about 
20 small tables, 3 by 6 feet, 30 inches high, are needed in the 
scoring room. According to the desire of the examiner, these 
tables may be supplied with special scoring tops, as indicated in 
the specifications and plan in Fig. 23 (8). For the regular work 
of the examining staff and scorers at least 75 ordinary chairs 
should be sufficient. 
This is a brief description of the building and equipment as 
originally planned for the psychological examining staff. It is 
obvious that no one of the buildings already constructed can 
be adapted to meet these suggestions exactly. The original 
plan and equipment are presented here as suggestions rather 
than as essential in all details. It is essential that the individual 
examining be done under as uniform conditions as possible. It 
is necessary that the chief examiner have a definite address and 
office within the camp boundaries, and it is further essential 
that proper storage space be furnished and supplied with locks 
or guards to protect against loss of examining materials. It 
is also necessary, for accurate scoring and recording, that per- 
manent and sufficient floor space be supplied for the scoring 
unit. Outside these essential and necessary requirements and 
the expendible equipment necessary to carry on the examining, 
scoring, and recording, physical properties will vary consider- 
ably from camp to camp.

  CHAPTER IV 
ARMY TESTS IN THE STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING 
CORPS AND COLLEGES 
The form of the Examiner’s Guide prepared by Major Lewis 
M. Terman for use in the Students’ Army Training Corps dif- 
fers slightly in directions for its use and in the method of giving 
instructions to the subjects for all separate tests except one. 
The instructions were not read aloud to those taking the tests. 
The time limits, in consequence, were changed slightly to in- 
clude a portion of the reading time. All other cautions and 
directions are identical with those of the regular army guide. 
It was unnecessary to prepare tests for illiterates and defectives 
since the early plans of the corps did not include instruction for 
the non-English reading men of draft age. The form containing 
the essential changes is reproduced here. 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 
The instructions presented herewith are for the conduct of 
examination alpha, the intelligence test prepared especially for 
literate men in the army. With minor exceptions the procedure 
is the same as that used with other literate recruits. 
The purposes of the alpha examination in the Students’ Army 
Training Corps are: 
(a) To secure an objective rating of all students according to 
general intelligence, as an aid in their final classification 
for service; 
(b) To acquaint prospective officers with the nature and value 
of the psychological ratings which are in general use in 
the Army; 
153
-P-A-G-E-168
154 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
(c) To aid in the educational guidance of students; 
(d) Where the examination can be given at the opening of a 
new term, to aid in the selection of candidates for ad- 
mission. 
When the examination cannot be given as part of the en- 
trance requirements, it should be given as early as possible 
after the opening of a new term. The results, if promptly avail- 
able, will be of value both in the educational guidance of the 
students and in the evaluation of their work. 
In order to eliminate all possibility of coaching, the following 
precautions should be taken: 
(1) Different forms of the alpha examination booklet should be 
used in successive terms. In general, it will be advisable 
not to use a given form more than once in a school year 
of four quarters. 
(2) The examinations in a given school should be completed in 
the shortest possible time. In the smaller schools, all the 
students may ordinarily be examined in the same half 
day, and in the larger schools in one, or at most, two days. 
(3) The greatest care should be taken to prevent the dissemina- 
tion of examination booklets. Before the men are allowed 
to leave the room after an examination, the number of 
booklets collected should be carefully checked against 
the number distributed. Used blanks and blanks held 
in reserve should be safeguarded by the examiner accord- 
ing to directions furnished by the Regional Director of 
Psychological Tests. 
The number of men who should be examined in a group will 
be determined largely by the available space. Groups of 100 
to 200 men are preferable, but under suitable conditions groups 
of 300 or 400 are readily handled. Crowding, however, should 
be avoided. When circumstances will permit, the men should 
be assigned to alternate seats.   
-P-A-G-E-169
  TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 155 
It is necessary that some kind of support be provided for the 
booklets. If there is no suitable room which is fitted with desks, 
or with chairs having arm rests, then each student may be 
supplied with a book on which to rest the examination blank 
during the examination. 
While discipline must be preserved throughout the examina- 
tion, it is necessary that the men be made to feel at ease. State- 
ments which might cause apprehension or nervousness should 
be avoided. Generally speaking, little should be said by the 
examiner beyond giving the directions for the separate tests. 
The procedure, as set forth in the following pages, should be 
adhered to rigidly. The directions should be given in the exact 
words indicated. No supplementary instructions of any kind 
are permissible. The rule that no questions shall be asked 
should be strictly enforced. Each test should be timed with a 
stop watch and care should be exercised to avoid error in timing. 
A few extra pencils, sharpened, should be at hand to supply 
men who need a new one during the examination. Pencil, not 
pen, should be used in all cases. 
PROCEDURE 
After the men have been seated, each is given a pencil. Then 
E. (examiner) should say: “We are going to pass around some 
papers now; don’t turn any of the pages until I tell you to.” 
Alpha booklets are then distributed, face up, the greatest care 
being taken to see that no one is given more than one booklet. 
As soon as the booklets have been distributed, E. should con- 
tinue, slowly and distinctly, pausing after each instruction to 
give subjects time to respond: 
“Now, at the top of the page, print your name after the 
word ‘Name.’ Print your last name first, then your first name, 
and then your middle initial, if any.”’ After name has been 
written, say: “Put your age in years after the word ‘Age.’” 
(Pause.) ‘Next, in the third line, write the name of the state 
or country in which you were born. If you were not born in
-P-A-G-E-170
ee TT 
156 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
this country, tell the number of years you have lived in the 
United States.” (Pause.) ‘After the word ‘race’ write 
the word ‘white.’” (In examining negro groups substitute the 
word “Negro.’’) ‘Next go to the line that begins with the word 
‘schooling’ and draw a line under the highest school grade 
you attended before you entered the 8. A. T. C. For example, 
if the last grade you attended before you entered the 8. A. T. C. 
was the fourth year of high school or preparatory school, draw 
a line under High School, Year 4. If you had reached the 
second year of college before entering the 8. A. T. C., draw a 
line under College, Year 2, etc.” 
When everything is ready, E. proceeds as follows: “Atten- 
tion! The purpose of this examination is to see how well you 
can remember, think and carry out what you are told to do. 
It is a test of general mental ability, and will help to find out 
what you are best fitted to do in the army. Such tests are given 
to all enlisted men in the Army. The results have proved to be 
of great value. The grade you make in this examination will 
be put on your Qualification Card and will become a part of 
your permanent record. Some of the things you will be given 
to do are very easy. Some you may find hard. You are not 
expected to make a perfect grade, but do the very best you can. 
“In the Army a man often has to listen to commands and 
then carry them out exactly. I am going to give you some 
commands to see how well you can carry them out. Listen 
closely. Ask no questions. Do not watch any other man to 
see what he does. 
“Look at your papers. Just below where you have been 
writing, there are several sets of forms—circles, triangles, and 
so forth. First you will be told to do something with the circles 
at 1, afterwards with the circles at 2, and so on. 
“When I call ‘Attention,’ stop instantly whatever you are 
doing and hold your pencil up—so. Don’t put your pencil down 
to the paper until I say ‘Go.’ (Examiner lowers his pencil.) 
Listen carefully to what I say. Do just what you are told to
-P-A-G-E-171
  
TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 157 
do. As soon as you are through, pencils up. Remember, wait 
for the word ‘Go.’”’ 
N. B. Examiner.—Give the following instructions very dis- 
tinctly and at moderate speed. After giving the command 
“Attention,” always notice carefully and have orderlies notice 
whether all pencils are up. Never proceed until they are. This 
is especially important in the beginning. Be careful to use the 
directions that fit the form of alpha booklet distributed. Be 
careful not to pause or to drop the voice in the course of a com- 
pound direction, e. g., in 2, before the words “and also.” Raise 
your pencil whenever you say ‘Attention.’ Lower it promptly 
whenever you say “Go.” 
Instructions for test 1, each form, are exactly the same as 
in the original guide. 
When the examiner is through giving the directions for test 1, 
he says: 
“During the rest of this examination don’t turn any page for- 
ward or backward unless you are told to. Now turn over the 
page to test 2.” 
Test 2.—Arithmetical Problems 
“Attention! Read the directions at the top of the page and 
do what they tell you to do. I will say stop at the end of five 
minutes. Do as many as you can in the time allowed.—Ready— 
Go!” 
After 5 minutes, say “STOP! Turn over the page to test 3.” 
Test 3.—Practical Judgment

After 1 minute and 40 seconds, say “STOP! Turn over the

around this way.” (Examiner illustrates the necessary rota- 
tion.) 
Test 56.—Disarranged Sentences

“Attention! Read the samples and the directions at the top

Test 7.—Analogies 
“Attention! Look at the first sample at the top of the page: 
Sky—blue : : grass—table, green, warm, big. 
“Notice the four words in heavy type. One of them—green— 
is underlined. Grass is green just as the sky is blue. 
“Look at the second sample: Fish—swims : : man—paper, 
time, walks, girl. 
“Here the word walks is underlined. A man walks and a 
fish swims. 
“Look at the third sample: Day—night : : white—red, 
black, clear, pure. ' 
“Here the word black is underlined because black is the op- 
posite of white just as night is the opposite of day. 
“Tn each of the lines below, the first two words are related to 
each other in some way. What you are to do in each line is to 
see what the relation is between the first two words and under- _ 
line the word in heavy type that is related in the same way to

the third word. Begin with No. 1 and mark as many sets as 
you can before time is called.—Ready—Go!” 
After 3 minutes, say “STOP! Turn over the page to test 8.” 
Test 8.—Information 
“Attention! Read the directions at the top of the page and 
do what they tell you to do.—Ready—Go!”” 
After 4 minutes, say “STOP! Close your booklets and turn 
them over to test 1. 
Have all examination booklets and pencils collected imme- 
diately and before the men are allowed to leave their seats. Be- 
fore dismissing the group, the number of booklets collected 
should be carefully checked with the number of men present 
and the number of booklets issued. 
DIRECTIONS FOR SCORING * 
The scoring is done by means of stencils, one for each of the 
eight tests. A test is scored by placing the stencil upon the 
appropriate page of the record booklet and comparing the re- 
sponses given with the marks on the stencil. 
The stencils may be made of cardboard suitably marked to 
indicate the correct answer. For tests 4, 5, 7 and 8, stencils 
made of thin, transparent strips of celluloid are preferable. If 
celluloid cannot be obtained, stencils for these tests may be 
made of cardboard. In this case, the scoring of tests 7 and 8 
will be facilitated by perforating the cardboard stencils so as 
to show where the correct responses are located. 
Letter ratings (A, B, C+, etc.) together with total score 
earned in the mental test, should be recorded promptly on each 
student’s qualification card. 
Detailed instructions for the use of mental ratings in the 
S. A. T. C. will be supplied separately. 
* The rules for scoring are given on page 66 and need not be reproduced 
here. The results of the examination as expressed in total score are also 
given in connection with rules for scoring.
-P-A-G-E-174
  160 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
A few days after authority to administer the general intelli- 
gence tests to the 8. A. T. C. was granted, the armistice was 
signed. Personnel plans were delayed until the future status 
of the Students’ Army Training Corps could be determined. 
The general considerations that led the Committee to offer to 
the colleges the opportunity to use the army tests, notwith- 
standing the sudden disappearance of the military necessity, 
are summed up in the following memorandum prepared by 
Major Terman. 
“Tn the first place, the tests will furnish an extremely valuable 
check upon the work of the students. There is no other means 
of ascertaining so definitely whether the student is working up 
to the limits of his abilities. Without a knowledge of the quality 
of the student’s ability there is no means of appraising his 
efforts. Over and over, both in high school and college I have 
seen students of ‘A’ intelligence, but poor performance, stimu- 
lated as a result of the test to improve their work. On the 
other hand, it is by no means uncommon for an unsuccessful 
student to be blamed by his instructor, when in fact the cause 
of his failure is inferior ability, rather than lack of effort. 
Without a knowledge of the quality of its raw material a school 
has to work more or less in the dark. 
“The test would also be valuable as an aid in the educational 
guidance of students. Men will be found attempting work in 
lines for which their native ability does not fit them. Such 
students will be everlastingly benefited by being guided into 
other lines more nearly commensurate with their ability. 
“The experience with the tests in the S. A. T. C. would un- 
doubtedly be of value if the military situation should ever 
again become acute; or if this should not happen they would 
be of value in connection with the future military training, 
wherever this might be given. I believe that the value of the 
tests for military purposes have been sufficiently demonstrated 
and that they will play a part in all future educational institu- 
tions giving military training. 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 161 
“The tests would be a valuable experiment for the colleges, 
apart from present or future military considerations, although 
we should perhaps not be justified in emphasizing this argu- 
ment.” 
The Division of Tests of the Committee on Education and 
Special Training finally decided to offer the materials to the 
colleges. A circular letter was sent to the colleges containing 
this information and they were requested to state in reply 
whether they desired to use the test materials and to designate 
a member of the faculty who would assume responsibility for 
receiving the blanks and instructions and directing the admin- 
istration of the tests. Approximately one hundred favorable 
replies were received almost immediately and instructions and 
materials were sent. Before the order demobilizing the Corps 
was issued two hundred and nine schools and colleges had 
indicated their willingness to codperate in the use of the tests. 
Some of the data thus obtained follow. 
DATA FROM COLLEGES AND THE STUDENTS’ ARMY 
TRAINING CORPS 
Data resulting from giving the alpha examination to the 
Students’ Army Training Corps and to college groups are of 
interest as bearing upon the intelligence of such groups and 
upon the position of these groups on the scale of alpha scores. 
Caution is necessary in the interpretation of the data of the 
tables. It is by no means certain that the values given are * 
typical of the groups which they represent. The institutions 
from which the data were obtained are largely the smaller 
schools and colleges of the west and south. Few data are at 
hand from the larger universities, and the records suggest that 
inclusion of figures from a number of large universities of high 
standing would materially raise the medians and the percentage 
of higher ratings. 
It cannot be stated with certainty that the groups to which
-P-A-G-E-176
    162 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
the examinations were given were truly representative of the 
institutions. There are from Brown University, for instance, 
records of only 210 men. This group is such a small proportion 
of the total registration that the chances are very much against 
its being a representative group. At some of the institutions 
the tests were given only to those who volunteered to take them, 
a procedure which introduces a factor of selection. Sometimes 
the records were obtained from only one class. Such a limitation 
probably gives a selected group; the figures from the University 
of Illinois show distinct class differences. 
A third factor making for variability in the results is the fact 
that tests were given under widely varying conditions and by 
many examiners, most of whom were untrained. While the 
chances of variations from this cause are not large, the possi- 
bility of such variations must be held in mind while examining 
the figures. 
Table 2 shows the distribution of alpha scores in several of 
the larger groups, and Table 3 the median scores, quartiles, and 
percentages of A and B grades for the groups listed in the table. 
There are wide differences between these groups. The medians 
vary from 111 for the normal school women to 130 for the college 
men, and the percentage of A and B grades combined for the 
same groups varies from 57.4 to 75.2. None of the groups makes 
a record as high as that of the army officers chosen for the 
principal sampling for Hollerith analysis, but all groups rate 
higher than the army sergeants, who made 50 per cent of A 
and B grades. The men of the Students’ Army Training Corps 
and the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps seem to offer good 
material for the selection of officers for the army.

made by the women are in every case a few points lower than 
the median scores for the men in similar groups, the differences 
are so small that they may be regarded as insignificant. The 
same statement may be made regarding the percentage of A 
and B grades combined. The men tend toward a higher pro- 
portion of A grades.

As the data sent by the University of Illinois were grouped 
according to the department of study it was possible to investi- 
gate possible intelligence differences between the various de- 
partments. These data are set forth in Table 10. As would be 
expected, the graduate students rate considerably higher than 
the students in the undergraduate departments, but this is the 
only difference of importance. The very slight drop for the 
students of agriculture probably is not significant.

Differences between the men in the four years of college were 
also obtained from the Illinois data. The results are shown 
in Table 11. There is a slight but definite increase in the per- 
centage of higher grades with the longer stay at college, pre- 
sumably as the result of the elimination of poorer men.

The chart reproduced on page 36 (figure 10) is of interest 
in connection with possible uses of such examinations in our 
high schools and higher institutions of learning. All of the 
students had been selected because they were judged by their 
a officers to have the necessary qualifications for 
success as army officers. They were believed to have the neces- 
sary physique, leadership, ability, intelligence, initiative and 
responsibility. 
he following discussion of tests in colleges is quoted from 
an article by Lt. Col. W. V. Bingham in the Proceedings of the 
American Association of College Registrars for 1919. 
‘These men were all given the army intelligence examination. 
The results were grouped according to army standards into 
the grades A, B, C plus, C, C minus, D, D minus and E. But   
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  TESTS IN STUDENT’S ARMY TRAINING CORPS 173 
there was none who scored D minus or E. Of those who scored 
C minus, or D, about seven-eighths failed to get through the 
course of training. Of those who scored C, about one-half suc- 
ceeded and one-half failed. Of those who scored A or B, about 
eight-ninths succeeded. In other words, intelligence, while by 
no means the only factor in determining their success in the 
officers’ training schools, was enough of a factor so that even 
with such a rough tool of measurement as the army intelligence 
examination, it was possible to predicate with some certainty 
that anyone who scored C, C minus or D, was probably wasting 
his time in going to an officers’ training school. 
“Another chart (page 34, figure 8) illustrates the tremen- 
dous inequalities of ability in various companies within a single 
regiment when the men were assigned to the companies ‘hap- 
hazard or by geographical location. The captain in command 
of Company D with a small percentage of A and B men and @ 
large fraction of illiterate and foreign born soldiers was ex- 
pected to train his men and get them ready for France at the 
same time that the captain of Company E got his men ready, 
and yet the captain of Company E had a large percentage of 
men, who, as far as intelligence was concerned, were officer 
material and he had only a small proportion of the illiterate or 
foreign. College instructors sometimes face a similar situation 
of inequality in their classes, having to cover the ground in the 
same length of time that other instructors do who have very 
different material to work with. Among 15,385 officers whose 
intelligence scores are here tabulated, only one made a rating 
as low as D; 84.1% of the 15,385 officers’ sampling made ratings 
of A or B, a proportion quite similar to the proportion of college 
students with A or B mentality as measured by the same tests. 
“During the past four years the Carnegie Institute of Tech- 
nology has been developing and utilizing the group method 
of examining students. There has been a gradual evolution in 
these tests, in which several progressive stages are to be noted. 
“First, a number of different kinds of tests that seem promis-
-P-A-G-E-188
174 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
ing are given to a large group of students, and the results for 
each test are plotted in the form of a percentile graph. In the 
number-completion test, for example, the scores made by the 
repnteie' are plotted against the percentages of students who 
attained each score. Such a graph is very convenient later on 
in making a comparison between the performance of any in- 
dividual student and that of the large group as a whole. Know- 
ing his score in the test, one can say instantly, by reference to 
the chart, that.this student is superior to say 67% of his class. 
“The next stage is to compare these test rankings with 
scholarship records and with estimates of the students’ ability 
oi by their instructors. These statistical comparisons show 
that some tests are much less indicative of success in college 
than others. Such tests are eliminated and the following year 
new tests are tried in their place. 
“When a student’s score is obtained in several tests that 
have proven to be reliable, it is convenient to prepare a diagram 
that may be called his ‘psychological profile.’ One student, 
for example, in the Margaret Morrison Division, the vocational 
college for women, ranked in the lowest 10% of her class in the 
opposites test, in the lowest 8% in the analogies test, in the 
lowest 5% in the completion test, and so on. Her psychological 
profile chart shows at a glance that in only one test did she do 
ier than the lowest 25%. That student was soon dropped 
for poor scholarship. The average faculty estimate of her 
ability placed her very near the bottom. It was 1.67 on a scale 
of ten. The faculty estimate, made after three months’ ac- 
quaintance with tne student, agrees with the psychological test 
made on the day of entrance. 
‘The mental profile of another student, instead of running 
near the bottom of the chart is almost entirely in the upper 
half, showing instantly that in nearly all the tests she excels the 
majority of her classmates. She is, as a matter of fact, a good 
student, the faculty estimate on her ability being 9.8 on a 
scale of 10. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 175 
“By such means as these the Institute has tried to make the 
information regarding the intelligence test records of its students 
conveniently available to the administrative officers: it has also 
endeavored to improve the tests year by year. The work is 
under the immediate direction of Professor L. L. Thurstone. 
He has recently combined the results of previous experience 
into a new group test in two parts. Each part requires less 
than half an hour to give. It is called the “cycle-omnibus 
test’’—‘‘omnibus,”’ because it includes in one test several forms 
of tasks, such as marking true and false statements, analogies, 
opposites, proverbs of similar meaning, etc., and ‘cycle,’ be- 
cause these varied forms of task are presented in succession re- 
peatedly. The forms of task selected for this cycle-omnibus 
test are those which have already proven their worth as in- 
dicators of the ability of students to do college work satis- 
factorily. 
“Tt is interesting to make a comparison between the reliability 
of psychological tests and other means ordinarily employed for 
predicting success or failure of college students, such as college 
entrance examination grades, high school records and the like. 
“Three of the best criteria of success that are employed in 
the college entrance procedure of the engineering school are: 
the entrance examination in algebra, the dean’s interview rating, 
and the rating given by the high school principal based upon 
the boy’s performance in the high school. Combining those 
three criteria and using them for prediction of the students’ 
success, it is found that they correlate about .40 with instructors’ 
estimates made after the students have been known to them 
for one semester. That correlation is somewhat higher than 
college entrance examinations taken alone ordinarily give. I 
do not know just what the results have been with the College 
Entrance Examination Board examinations of the past years. 
When Thorndike some years ago computed the correlation 
between college entrance examinations at Columbia and the 
student’s scholarship standing in the college, he found prac-
-P-A-G-E-190
  ‘ ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
tically zero correlation. In other words, the student’s perform- 
ance in the entrance examination was no prediction whatever 
of the degree of his success with his college studies. 
“When we used last year as a basis of prediction for the en- 
gineering students, three of the dozen or so tests that we had 
been working with at Carnegie, the correlation with instructors’ 
estimates was .48. It was somewhat better than when, the 
combined high school record, algebra examination and Dean’s 
interview rating were used. But here is a significant point. 
If we combine the’ information from those sources with the 
test scores, the coefficient of correlation is raised to nearly .57. 
_ We get a more reliable prediction by using both the old criteria 
and the new criteria in combination. Information obtained by 
such psychological methods will undoubtedly have its value in 
connection with problems of admission to college. This ques- 
tion of admission is one that suggests desirability of making 
improvements in two directions. Is it not possible to admit a 
larger number of students who are now excluded but who could 
profit by the college course? Is it not possible to exclude from 
college a larger proportion of the students who now come to 
college and fail, who leave with the brand of failure upon them, 
having wasted their own time and their fathers’ money? 
“The use of psychological methods ought to help in solving 
both of these problems. It should make possible more elasticity 
in the administration of entrance requirements. 
“Tn the state universities and middle western colleges there 
is an enormous mortality in the freshman year. Perhaps, that 
is the way it ought to be. We ought to give everybody an op- 
portunity who can possibly make good in college. But at the 
same time we ought to make more of an effort to exclude those 
who, even though they may be high school graduates, cannot 
possibly succeed in college, and direct them toward a type of 
training that they could really profit by. How is one to suggest 
wisely the direction in which a student not able to take college 
training should turn? Can mental tests be of any assistance

    TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 177 
whatever in specific vocational guidance? At some far distant 
date psychological methods are going to be a help even in this 
difficult task of guidance. They cannot help to-day. I mean 
that there exist now no adequate psychological tests of special- 
ized vocational talent. One striking exception to that general- 
ization is Seashore’s tests for the measurement of musical 
talent. But in general, psychology has very, very little to offer 
in the way of specialized tests of ability in different vocations. 
“Mental tests are, however, tools of some reliability in deter- ° 
mining general intelligence, in ascertaining the level of a per- 
son’s ability to learn to profit by experience and to adapt himself 
to changing demands. These tests are not 100% perfect, but 
they are reliable up to a certain point; and to that extent I am 
confident they are going to find a useful place in university 
administration, not only with reference to the administration 
of admissions, but also in the guidance of students in the 
problems they face throughout their academic career. 
“Tn conclusion, let me offer one word of caution against en- 
couraging the adoption of psychological methods unless faculty 
and administration are quite ready to codperate in checking 
up the results and in putting them to use. The group exam- 
inations should be followed up by more detailed individual 
examinations of students who make a poor score. Individual 
examinations should also be made of students who are known 
to be on the verge of failure in their work, to ascertain definitely 
whether their poor showing is due to lack of native ability. All 
this work takes a great deal of time and should not be required 
of psychology instructors who already are carrying full schedules 
of teaching. Any thorough-going program for the use of 
psychological methods in university administration should in- 
clude provision of time and funds for an additional specialist 
in individual psychology and mental measurement.” *

178 ARMY MENTAL TESTS : 
The suggestions contained in the above results of mental 
tests are of considerable importance in the systematic study 
of college personnel. The demonstrated value of the work of 
the Committee on Classification of Personnel in the Army 
and of the Division of Psychology of the Surgeon General’s 
Office should not be lost. 
The suggestions for systematic study and coéperation in re- 
search contained in an article recently published by one of the 
editors of this volume seem pertinent here. The dignity of the 
study of human qualities is worthy a still more pretentious 
plan.* 
“Personnel classification in the formation of the United States 
Army brought into high relief certain difficulties that institu- 
tions dealing with the training and education of young men 
and women had vaguely felt. A few institutions had attempted 
to set into operation methods aimed at the solution of these 
questions. The systematic and persistent exploration of the 
difficulties and their solution were forced upon the War Depart- 
ment. Its rapid and unprecedented expansion gave clear def- 
inition to many unsettled personnel problems. It found the 
source of supply unanalyzed and its own needs but vaguely in 
mind. Large numbers of specialists were suddenly demanded. 
Experience quickly demonstrated that personal qualities were 
extremely important assets in war. It became necessary to 
specify in detail the personal, educational and technical re- 
quirements for each important task. To insure proper quali- 
fications, specially devised tests proved necessary. The in- 
creased size of the army forced it to maintain complete and 
detailed systems of personnel records and to devise special 
‘follow-up’ methods. 
“ Army experience can be duplicated in the experience of our 
educational institutions. We believe that the pressure of war

-P-A-G-E-193
  TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING ‘CORPS 179 
has produced a clearer conception of the problems involved in 
training and placement. It has emphasized the advantages of 
carefully systematized procedure in discovering needed qual- 
ities of human nature, and the importance of freeing estimates 
of persons, as much as possible, from the errors of personal bias 
and incidental acquaintance. Vague memories of so-and-so’s 
personality and qualifications broke down utterly as a means 
of building up an army. 
“This article proposes the general outline of a plan for a per- 
sonnel bureau. The principal features of such a bureau can - 
be put into operation in any educational institution, large or 
small. The plan considers the study of student personnel as 
fundamental in any institution that believes its function con- 
nected in any way with the well-being of its patrons and with 
the success of its graduates in their chosen professions. It also 
contains the implication that such an institution must keep 
fuller and more definite records of success and failure, of per- 
sonalities and of the results of its training and teaching. The 
essential functions of such a bureau, or committee, are four. 
Modifications of the plan will emphasize one or the other of 
these functions, according to local conditions, the specific aims 
of the institution or the personnel of the bureau itself; subdivi- 
sion of functions will increase with the growth of the bureau 
and the financial and moral encouragement given it. 
“ The primary functions of the bureau are, to obtain accurate 
data on each student, to codify the requirements of different 
professions, to supervise the use of tests and to provide means 
whereby each student may become acquainted with his abilities 
and the requirements of the occupations in which he is inter- 
ested. Properly to perform these functions as complete an in- 
ventory of the human material passing through the institution as 
is possible must be made in permanent form. Second, the files 
of this bureau must contain a similar inventory of the impor- 
tant vocations. Third, the bureau will provide the responsible 
agencies for bringing to the student seeking a life occupation 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
180 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
all its systematic material on the opportunities and require- 
ments necessary to attain a certain degree of success in those 
vocations open to him. Fourth, the bureau will proceed on the 
assumption that all of these problems can be investigated in a 
scientific manner and will initiate and encourage research in 
this field. 
“ The essentials of the inventory of human material can be 
placed on a single card—the personal history card or qualifica- 
tion card. This qualification card will contain facts concerning 
- the previous history of the individual. This previous history 
should contain items concerning his social and school life per- 
tinent to the purpose of such an inventory. The card will also 
be a permanent record of his educational career. It is not 
necessary to summarize in detail the items involved in such a 
record. Ratings which will consist of elementary school grades, 
marks in college or technical school studies and the results of 
specially devised rating plans will also be recorded on this card. 
It is further expected that on the student’s qualification card 
space be left for recording the results of intelligence tests and 
of other tests important in determining the qualifications of 
the individual. Recent determinations of the usefulness of such 
intelligence ratings and specialized tests‘make it probable that 
in the future no institution will be without such information 
concerning its student body. 
“The information desired as a part of the student’s perma- 
nent record may be obtained in several well-known ways; though 
at present none of these is satisfactory. Extremely valuable 
estimates of the individual’s qualifications and qualities of 
mind and person may nevertheless be obtained by careful inter- 
viewing when he reports for entrance to the college or other 
educational institution. Such estimates as the student himself 
gives at this interview can be supplemented and checked by 
carefully prepared letters of inquiry to persons who have known 
him in his previous school work and outside activities. Addi- 
tional ratings and estimates on personal qualities and on special
-P-A-G-E-195
  TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 181 
aptitudes should be obtained at least yearly from his instructors 
and fellow students. These estimates properly tabulated and 
combined with the objective ratings obtained from the tests 
give the foundation for tentative judgments of the student’s 
ability and probable future career. 
“The second function of this bureau is the collection and 
classification of vocational information. This should include 
carefully obtained opinions on the qualities necessary for success 
in each of the vocations studied. Each vocation should be 
carefully studied from the point of view of the range of mental 
capacity that will stand a satisfactory chance for success. A 
card for a vocation should also indicate minimum and maximum 
educational qualifications so far as they can be returned. Such 
a record must also specify the need for any special ability if 
such is an essential. When properly completed the specifications 
for any vocation will also include a statement of the more essen- 
tial qualities necessary for success in that vocation. It is not 
too much to believe that sometime in the future these may be 
given their proper weighting in a great many vocations. Bib- 
liographies pertaining to special fields can also be made avail- 
able to students through the bureau. 
“ Again much careful investigation is necessary. This part 
of the work of the bureau must begin at the beginning. The 
utter lack of agreement on the qualities that produce success 
and satisfaction in life is easily demonstrated. Whether this 
failure to agree is a matter of permanent differences indicating 
many roads to success or satisfaction, or is rather one in which 
a limited number of qualities receive different weights under 
definitely describable conditions, is surely a problem worth ex- 
perimentation. Minimal requirements of education and train- 
ing can undoubtedly be specified and standardized. 
“The third important function of this personnel bureau will be 
to bring to the student seeking a life vocation all material col- 
lected on vocations. By proper methods of cataloguing this 
material can be readily presented to the student. In this con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
ference section of the bureau, problems concerning his college 
advancement may also be taken up with the student. It is, of 
course, here that the importance of the objective tests can most 
readily be seen. The collection and recording of the information 
as described above will be of extreme advantage to the dean, 
and to others whose duty it is to discuss with the student his 
place in the school work and his success in advanced studies. 
“Properly to develop the fourth function, it is important that 
a single responsible agency have charge of general intelligence 
tests and other forms of testing used. This agency should not 
be within any single school or department of the institution. 
The value of modern group and individual examinations of 
relative intelligence is now thoroughly established. The plan 
proposed aims to make these an integral part of the personnel 
inventory. The satisfactory development of their values rests 
on the scientific care and common-sense skill with which they 
are used. Their proper use is obviously in connection with the 
two inventories above described. So used they will undoubtedly 
prove invaluable aids in personal interviews with students. 
“The importance of following up the use of tests is, of course, 
patent. The correlations desired are essential in estimating the 
significance of tests, the prophetic value of personal data and 
the weightings for vocational qualifications. Constant revision, 
retrial and experimentation are implied in this fourth function 
of the bureau. 
_ “The personnel of such a bureau should be carefully selected. 
During the first years of its operation and in preparing the 
final form of organization, its work should be supervised by a 
general committee. Immediate responsibility for the bureau 
should be in the hands of a smaller group of men who have 
shown themselves to be particularly interested in human quali- 
ties and their development. If properly managed, it will re- 
quire part time from at least three men of professional rank. 
The chairman of this smaller group should be responsible for 
the general organization of the plan and its codrdination with 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
    TESTS IN STUDENTS’ ARMY TRAINING CORPS 183 
other university activities. The second member of the sub- 
committee should be a specialist who is thoroughly acquainted 
with business methods and vocational specifications. The third 
member should have special qualities fitting him for personal 
contact with the student and for the unbiased presentation of 
the requirements of different vocations. The direct manage- 
ment of the affairs of the bureau should be in the hands of a 
secretary, who should have at least the rank of an assistant 
professor. It is probable that practically full time will be 
required of this man, and in the current management of such 
a bureau he doubtless will be the important active member of it. 
“The proposed bureau does not present a scheme for voca- 
tional guidance. If an institution or a dean feels that it or he can 
properly carry the responsibility, the bureau provides the only 
safe procedure for obtaining guidance in passing out such ad- 
vice. We believe rather that an institution owes it to its student- 
body to provide systematically prepared information about life 
and its business. Further, if the study of human qualities is 
to be removed from the realm of palmistry and ‘get rich quick’ 
schemes, systematized research must provide the means. Per- 
sistent and organized research of this type must be done in 
permanent institutions that will provide continuous and ac- 
cessible records. Several years of codperative research among 
widely distributed institutions might even produce principles 
for vocational guidance.”
-P-A-G-E-198
CHAPTER V 
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS * 
“In an address at the Personnel Officers’ School at Camp 
Meigs less than a year ago, Major-General Hutchinson, C. B. D. 
8. O., Director of Organization of the British Army, spoke 
very frankly of the serious mistake of Great Britain in recruiting 
her skilled labor indiscriminately into fighting units. They 
made good soldiers, but the plan seriously interfered with the 
development of technical units and the ‘output of many vital 
things.’ 
“No one has computed the cost of bringing back those skilled 
men from the Western Front after they had been trained as 
soldiers, or of having the vital things made elsewhere that might 
have been made at home. If it had not been for the great 
American reservoir of skilled labor it would probably have cost 
the war. That the United States did not make a similar, and 
with the exhaustion of the reservoir, a disastrous mistake in 
the military distribution of our skilled labor is due primarily 
to the Committee on the Classification of Personnel in the 
Army. 
“The work of this committee is commonly regarded as one 
of the great contributions of civilians to the efficiency of the 
Army. It is probably the greatest single piece of mental en- 
gineering that has ever been attempted in this country. But it 
is by no means the only task of the war that was successfully

met by an application of the principles of the science of human 
behavior to war conditions. 
“Mental engineering as an organized war service of American 
psychologists began at an informal méeting of experimentalists 
in the spring of 1917. They asked themselves the universal 
question, what they could do to help win the war. The answer 
to that question as it finally evolved, has come to be more than 
a matter of historic interest, more than a war measure, more 
than practical applications of a single science. It is a permanent 
contribution to the organization and utilization of human forces. 
It inevitably projects itself into the great reconstruction, and 
supplies at once a prophecy and an obligation. 
“The work of the Committee on the Psychological Examina- 
tion of Recruits was another of the notable mental engineering 
achievements of the war. Its original purpose was to help to 
eliminate from the Army at the earliest possible moment those 
recruits whose defective intelligence would make them a menace 
to the military organization. But the military value of an 
early and reliable estimate of the general intelligence of each 
recruit proved enormously greater than had been anticipated. 
“But in the enormous task of building up an efficient army 
organization it proved important to discover at the earliest 
opportunity those recruits who could learn the new duties that, 
were required of them as soldiers in the shortest time. To train 
the quick learners and the slow learners together in the same 
companies was an intolerably wasteful process. Moreover, the 
army needed an enormous number of men with superior intelli- 
gence for officers. While high general intelligence did not guar- 
antee good officer material it was a conspicuous fact that good 
officers regularly ranked high in the intelligence tests. In the 
selection of men for officer training camps mental tests were ob- 
viously preferable to the importunity of influential friends. 
They proved greatly superior to personal impressions.

NECESSITY OF A SCIENTIFIC BASIS 
“For a variety of reasons mental testing has aroused an un= 
usually widespread popular interest. It was initiated and first 
developed in France as a scientific instrument for educators. 
It has become an important adjunct to the juvenile court, and 
bids fair to become a valuable instrument for social research, 
and a practicable device for solving a considerable number of 
perplexing educational and industrial problems. 
~ “For example, the various trades represented in the draft 
made rather insistent demands not only on physical strength 
and endurance but also on that ability to meet new and complex 
situations which we call general intelligence. We commonly 
deplore spoiling a first-class mechanic to make a poor executive. 
Apparently the scientific measurement of general intelligence 
will go a long way in estimating whether a person has the general 
intelligence that is required for average success in any given 
trade or profession. 
~~ “But it is easily possible to expect too much of mental tests. 
Prophecy of the future is vastly more difficult than a record of 
actual developments even in such relatively simple matters as 
the weather. The only final indicator of the inability of a per- 
son to succeed in a profession is failure; and even a failure may 
be the one factor in the complex conditions of the mental life 
that is necessary for success. In view of the suddenly developed 
popular interest in mental tests, itis necessary to point out 
that no so-called mental test is of the least scientific value unless 
it rests on a scientific analysis of the process to be tested, and 
unless it has been thoroughly systematized and statistically 
evaluated. The preparation of the army tests of general in- 
telligence was a notable technical achievement of far-reaching 
importance” 
Lieut. Commander Dodge gives in a succeeding paragraph 
an illustration of the steps necessary to the analysis of an 
interesting psychological problem and to the preparation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 187 
practical methods of using the solution when obtained. The 
brilliantly successful solution of this problem is due primarily 
to his skill and insight. 
“The first problem that was referred to the sub-committee 
on vision was the question whether we had any way of selecting 
those naval recruits who could be trained most quickly as gun- 
pointers for the armed merchant ships. 
“The first step was to learn exactly what a gun-pointer had 
to do. The next was tio reduce the more or less complicated 
processes of gun-pointing to their simplest neuro-muscular 
terms. It was a definite problem for analysis; and, because of 
the perfect systematization and high specialization of naval 
tasks it was relatively simple. The third step was to adapt ap- 
proved scientific technics to the study of this particular complex 
of neuro-muscular processes. For this purpose an instrument 
was devised that would show all the following facts on a single 
record line: 1, the time that it took a sailor to start his gun- 
pointing reaction after the target at which he was aiming started 
to move; 2, the accuracy with which he was able to ‘keep on’ 
the moving target; 3, the time that it took him to respond to a 
change in the direction of motion of the target; 4, the ability . 
to press the firing key when he was on; 5, the effect of firing 
on his pointing. 
“All these data were so simplified that they could be ac- 
curately estimated from simple measurements of a single line 
without elaborate computations. A succession of records in- 
dicated the probable quickness with ewhich the sailor would 
learn the new codrdinations. The final step was to test the 
probably military value of our instrument and its records by 
performances of expert and inexpert gun-pointers. 
“The first trials proved the usefulness of the device. It 
clearly differentiated between the qualified gun-pointers, the 
partially trained, and the untrained. It picked a number of 
promising novices and indicated the faults of some who were 
slow to improve. Predictions based on the records were uni-
-P-A-G-E-202

formly corroborated by subsequent experience. Somewhat 
later it was possible to construct a robust training instrument 
along similar lines that was rather enthusiastically reported on 
by various Naval officers, and was widely reproduced by the 
Navy for use in the Naval Training Stations. 
“At a time when every available gun was needed for service 
afloat, the utility of our relatively simple and inexpensive train- 
ing instrument that closely reproduced the codrdinations of 
actual service needs no emphasis.” 
The emphasis Lieut. Commander Dodge places on the neces- 
sity for thorough systematization, analysis and statistical 
evaluation is timely. The spread of the use of the army in- 
telligence tests and the numerous requests for data regarding 
them make the emphatic reiteration of this caution extremely 
important. 
Army tests were prepared for a specific purpose. The suc- 
cessful results obtained were due in large measure to the strict 
limitation of use to that purpose. Any educational, social or 
industrial applications the tests may have must necessarily be 
less successful in that degree in which the aim and the groups 
tested differ from the selected group reporting to the great 
cantonments to be trained as soldiers. New standards for 
these tests must be formulated. New tests will need to be de- 
vised in many instances. Especially will it be necessary to 
reinterpret results and establish new critical points in the scale. 
EDUCATIONAL APPLICATIONS 
The group method of examining school schildren for general 
intelligence is already in use. It is proving important as a 
method of making rapid school surveys for states and cities. 
Within these units, it enables school principals to make frequent 
surveys of class rooms in order to discover promptly pupils 
who are retarded or who are being held in grades too easy for 
their ability. These rapid surveys indicate quickly and with 
a high degree of accuracy the students who need special atten:   
-P-A-G-E-203
  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 189 
tion. They point out those cases that need more careful in- 
dividual examination, and give standards of measurement that 
possess a much greater degree of reliability than have those 
used heretofore. 
A very respectable list of group tests for school purposes is 
available to-day. Some of these are adaptations of the army 
tests. One from which extremely interesting results may be 
expected is being used in the Virginia School Survey. School 
surveys are in progress in other states using the army intelli- 
gence test in the form described in this book. Other group 
tests in use are to greater or less degree divergent in content 
but utilize the principles described above in Chapter II. Under 
the direction of the National Research Council, a group test 
especially. planned for school children is now being prepared. 
A study of the army tests in the selection and rating of ele- 
mentary and high school teachers is in progress. 
Correlation coefficients for the army alpha test and other 
measurements of intelligence were presented on page 20. An 
especially severe test of the army intelligence tests is shown 
there in the correlation of school grade location of thirteen and 
fourteen year old pupils. The coefficients of correlation range 
from .75 to .91. Numerous factors work against such high 
correlations, for example, the tendency of schools to try the 
backward pupils in advanced grades regardless of attainment; 
the large numbers of those who, discouraged by being forced to 
remain in classes with pupils much younger than they or by the 
difficulty of the work, drop out of school entirely; and also the 
chance that brighter pupils because of youthfulness are held 
back and forced to go more slowly than their ability warrants. 
Two of these factors tend to displace correct grade location. 
The other materially reduces the probable range and thereby 
tends to lower correlations. In spite of these factors, high 
correlations are shown. 
The following table gives the distribution for 139 school 
children who took Examination A. This is the first army form

The beta test (the army group test for illiterates and for- 
eigners) has also been used in testing school children. Cases 
numbering 597 representing all grades give the correlations 
age with score .76, school grade with score .85. One feature of 
the new tests now being developed is that the characteristics 
of the alpha and beta tests are combined in a single scale. At

   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 191 
the close of active psychological work in the Army, such a com- 
bined test was almost completed for army use. 
A plan for the specific experimental use of intelligence tests 
in the schools was presented by Major Yerkes in his Harvey 
lecture cited above. It is in line with results obtained by sim- 
ilar experiments in the Army. 
“From leaders in our school systems, from administrative 
officers and teachers in colleges and professional schools, and 
from specialists in educational psychology come requests for 
permission to use the army mental tests. It is the hope of 
many of these men that mental ratings, as soon as it is made 
possible to secure them conveniently and reliably, may be used 
in our public schools as partial basis for grading, promotion and 
vocational advice; that they should prove valuable also in in- 
stitutions of higher learning as partial basis for admission, classi- 
fication, grading, promotion, assignment to special work, and 
vocational guidance. Such applications of mental measurement 
would, it is true, radically change our educational system, for 
at present mental achievement, the extent of information or 
the lack of it is virtually the sole basis for admission, classifica- 
tion and promotion. Mental measurement of school pupils, 
college and professional students indicate extreme differences 
in mental ability throughout the educational range as well as 
important differences in the mental constitution. These facts 
must be taken into account if educational procedure is to 
benefit the individual in highest degree. It therefore is pro- 
posed that children should be classified in accordance with 
mental ability either as they enter school or shortly thereafter 
and that mental ability should thereafter be taken into account 
in connection with their educational treatment. 
“The following plan is therefore proposed as a means of 
utilizing mental ratings in the interests alike of education and 
of vocational placement. 
“On the basis of reliable mental ratings, children should be 
classified in one of three intellectual groups, which may be
-P-A-G-E-206
  192 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
designated by the letters A, B, and C. Group A would consist 
of children of superior intelligence, group C, of children pos- 
sessing relatively inferior intelligence; and group B, of those 
of intermediate grade. The three groups would not necessarily 
be of equal size. 
“Mental classification having been effected, educational 
treatment should be adapted to the needs and possibilities of 
the individual. To this end the following facts must be recog- 
nized: (1) that both rate of educational progress and limit of 
educability are conditioned chiefly by degree of native or inborn 
mental ability, (2) that range of vocational choice varies directly 
with mental ability. We have assumed that the children of a 
given grade will be classified in three groups which shall be 
taught either in the same classroom or in different rooms. Each 
section shall be permitted and required to progress in accord- 
ance with its mental ability, thus group A might readily pass 
through the grades at twice the speed of group C. 
“Up to a certain point in the educational development these 
three groups can profitably follow the same course of instruc- 
tion. This point is the completion of the fifth grade of elemen- 
tary school. By the time this stage of educational development 
has been achieved, many individuals of the C group will exhibit 
difficulties in learning and diminution of interest, both of which, 
as a rule, indicate approach to the limit of one particular sort 
of educability. In recognition of the fact that there is a limit 
to the educability of every living being, the diagram indicates 
that after the fifth grade divergent series of courses will be 
followed by the three groups. The A grade pupils may profit- 
ably continue, if they have the will, their primarily intellectual 
course of training toward those vocations or professions which 
require high grade intelligence and excellent educational train- 
ing. The middle grade individuals may more profitably follow 
a course in preparation for highly skilled industrial vocations 
or those lines of professional work which make less exacting 
educational and intellectual requirements than do the learned
-P-A-G-E-207
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 193 
professions, so called. Pupils of grade C should, by contrast, 
follow a manual training course as a means of continuing to 
its limit their intellectual development and simultaneously 
fitting themselves for the most appropriate type of vocational 
activity. 
“Mental classification and educational treatment in accord- 
ance with the same, although seemingly undemocratic, is quite 
the reverse. While boasting of equality of opportunity in our 
national life and particularly in our educational system, we are, 
as a matter of fact, seriously discriminating against individuals 
because of our failure to take their characteristics and needs 
into account. Equality of opportunity in our schools necessi- 
tates classification in accordance with ability, individualized 
treatment, recognition of limitations and of practical limits of 
educability, differentiation of courses, and vocational direction 
and training which shall enable the individual to avoid failure 
by reason of undertaking the impossible or waste because of 
the choice of an occupation which makes slight demand upon 
the ability of the individual.” * 
SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE 
The army data on racial differences are meagre. The intro- 
duction and development of the group tests and the invention 
of successful individual and group methods for testing the il- 
literate and non-English speaking will now make it feasible to 
carry out experiments in mental testing that have previously 
been impossible. It seems within the bounds of reason to 
prophesy the development of methods that will finally aid in 
defining racial and environmental likenesses and differences. 
For the present two or three steps of social significance are 
indicated. 
The problem of illiteracy has been emphasized by the re-

1919, pp. 6-7.
-P-A-G-E-208
  194 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
cruiting of the draft army. Attention has been focussed on this 
great educational problem by the facts brought out by the 
Army’s attempt to instruct the draft. Psychological methods 
have aided in the discovery of those unable to learn and in the 
classification according to literacy. The group method of 
examining, checked up later by individual examination for 
failures, throws each man on his own resources. It establishes a 
check on progress after leaving school and by careful use will 
shortly enable us to standardize a practical definition of illiteracy 
or literacy. 
Many men in the Army reporting fourth and fifth grade 
schooling proved unable to make scores in the army test for 
literates (alpha) because they could no longer read in anything 
but a halting manner and because the simple arithmetic prob- 
lems carried no meaning. Many of these write letters with 
frequent misspelled words and no longer read more than a few 
of the headlines in newspapers. The general intelligence exam- 
ination offers an objective standardized test both in the school- 
room and without, to measure actual ability in mastery of these 
important social tools. The discovery of the semi-literate is a 
secondary use of the group test. Its correlation with school 
grade is high; and the results, in the primary grades, are, there- 
fore, excellent indications of success in the mastery of the neces- 
sary elementary equipment of a citizen. 
The interrelations of illiteracy, crime, prostitution, poverty, 
mental disease and mental deficiency are by no means clear. 
The methods of investigation are in their infancy. Means of 
measuring degrees of importance of this or that factor are still 
primitive. The very definition of the traits that may or may. 
not be responsible for the social results enumerated is still to 
be accomplished. Specific delimitation and formulation of 
these problems are much needed. 
In lieu of something better the army methods of testing in- 
telligence were used to assist if possible in the solution of these 
pressing problems. The question of discipline is extremely im- 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 195 
portant to the morale and efficiency of an Army. It seemed 
probable that one of the causes of crimes in the army is the lack 
of a sense of responsibility due to feeble-mindedness. Many 
summary court cases were first tested by the army psychologists. 
They were called in to testify in numerous other instances. 
Minor breaches of discipline were frequently reported to the 
psychologist for examination and recommendation. It was 
not an unusual sight in the camps to see a soldier under guard 
in the psychological building awaiting mental examination. 
A complete survey of the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort 
Leavenworth was made shortly after the armistice. The details 
of the study cannot be reported here. On the whole the group 
averaged in mental ability the equivalent of the entire draft. 
The range of intelligence was approximately the same. Certain 
differences in mental capacity were apparently related to crimes 
of special sorts. Desertion correlated positively with low men- 
tality though the correspondence was not high. The actual 
percentage of low grade mental cases increased with certain 
other army offenses. The preliminary nature of the study makes 
it unwise to quote extensively from the report. 
The army tests have recently been used in surveys of state 
reformatories and state prisons. The argument states that the 
transfer of the mentally deficient to state institutions for the 
feeble-minded and defectives would relieve the prisons of per- 
sons who do not properly belong there, would reduce the expense 
of their care, and place them where they would not be turned 
loose again in a society where they cannot protect themselves. 
Thus a necessary first step would be taken in the solution of 
causes of crime by the classification of these men and women 
on the basis of intelligence. 
The evidence so far does not indicate that the problem is 
solved by this classification. On the contrary it indicates 
rather definitely that other causes or facilitating conditions 
are largely responsible. The negative character of the evidence 
is important. Where positive correspondence of crime with 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
- 196 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
feeble-mindedness exists we can proceed at once with segrega- 
tion. Classification by such progressive steps becomes easier 
as one after another of the causes are uncovered and removed. 
The significance of mental tests is. greater in the cases of 
prostitution studied. In several hundred cases investigated by 
the psychologists, 53 per cent of the women were ten years 
mental age or less; 10 per cent were so feeble-minded that they 
should have been placed in custodial institutions. These results 
correspond to previous results obtained in many parts of the 
country. A large percentage of those who tested above ten 
mentally showed marked evidence of mental instability and 
in some instances definite mental disease. A relatively small 
number could be said to be mentally normal. 
Studies of conscientious objectors by means of the psycho- 
logical examinations showed that they averaged slightly higher 
as a group than the draft. A few were foreign born, but the 
cause evidently must be sought elsewhere than in either of 
these conditions. The clannish nature of the groups that fur- 
nished the majority of the conscientious objectors has been 
suggested as the condition underlying their failure to appreciate 
the aims and ideals of the great mass of men and women. 
Whatever the cause or condition, it does not seem to lie in any 
difference of general mental ability. Again the evidence is 
negative, but one of the most common explanations, ignorance 
as evidenced in lack of mental capacity, can no longer be offered. 
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS 
The following discussion is quoted in the main, from a manu- 
script by Major Yerkes. 
The convincing demonstration of the practicability of mental 
measurement in connection with placement is one of the con- 
spicuously important contributions of psychological service to 
the Army. It is generally admitted by those who have taken 
the trouble to consider the matter, that the methods prepared 
to meet military needs have wide applicability and possibility
-P-A-G-E-211
  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 197 
of indefinitely increasing value. Within the Army, experienced 
officers as well as men new to the service recognize that the 
utilization of mental ratings has increased efficiency by im- 
proving placement and facilitating elimination. Psychological 
service has suddenly created a large demand for technological 
work. This demand is most insistent from education and in- 
dustry, although the sciences also are making their needs 
known. Before the war mental engineering was a dream; to-day 
it exists, and its effective development is amply assured. 
The relation of intelligence to occupation as studied in the 
Army is of very obvious importance for education and for in- 
dustry. Figure 24 presents the proportion of the three chief 
groups of intelligence ratings for a number of army occupations. 
The data are not comparable with those which would be ob- 
tained from civilian groups because of various selectional factors 
which appear in the Army. i 
In order of diminishing intelligence the occupational groups 
represented in Figure 24 may be classified thus: professions, 
clerical occupations, trades, partially skilled labor and unskilled 
labor. The greatest differences in intelligence required or ex- 
hibited by different occupations appear at the ends of the 
scale, whereas differences in the trained group are relatively 
slight. Further differences in range of intelligence for the va- 
rious occupations are considerable and probably significant. 
The range in general diminishes from unskilled labor to the 
intellectually difficult professions for the obvious reason. that 
whereas any individual may attempt tasks which require rela- 
tively little intelligence or education, only able individuals can 
succeed in the learned professions. It is well worthy of remark 
that whereas the group of army laborers contains few individuals 
of high grade intelligence (A or B ratings), the group of engineer- 
ing officers contains very few except high grade individuals. 
Figure 25 presents the relation of intelligence to occupation 
for a similar group of army occupations but in quite different 
manner.

  factorily prepared, should greatly assist teachers in advising 
and directing pupils in accordance, for example, with some 
such plan of educational organization as has been suggested 
above. They should also prove of value in connection with 
industrial placement. 
Within the industrial sphere, as contrasted with educational, 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
200 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
intelligent employment management requires abundant infor- 
mation and the development and use of scientific methods. 
Individuals, if hired and placed at random, seldom hold their 
jobs for more than a few days. The enormous labor turnover 
of many industrial concerns is due chiefly to three causes: 
(a) the relative unfitness (by nature or training) of the individual 
for the work assigned, (b) unsatisfactory conditions of labor 
and (c) the mechanization and the resulting dehumanizing of 
industrial processes. 
For wise and effective industrial placement and occupational 
guidance, two things at least are absolutely essential: first, 
definite knowledge of the physical and mental requirements 
(specification) of the job, and second, equally definite knowledge 
. of the physical and mental characteristics and capacities of the 
individual to be placed. 
If these requirements are to be met satisfactorily, occupations 
will have to be carefully analyzed in their relations to the in- 
dividual and definite specifications will have to be prepared. 
In addition, individuals will have to be classified in accordance 
with intelligence, temperament, education and occupational 
taste or preference. It is now possible to prepare specifications 
and suitably to classify individuals with reference to intelli- 
gence, education and occupational taste. 
For the present at least it is probable that if three grades of 
intellect were distinguished in industry, as has been suggested 
for the school, a very great gain would be made in degree of 
fitness of the individual for his task, and in his resulting con- 
tent and efficiency. f 
Concerning temperamental measurement and classification, 
there is little to say, for methods at once simple and reliable 
are not yet available. It is nevertheless obvious that tempera- 
ment is as important as intelligence for industrial placement 
and vocational guidance. Despite the seemingly infinite variety 
of temperaments, there are probably just a few classes which 
have great occupational importance. It is possible, indeed,
-P-A-G-E-215
   PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 201 
that even three classes, as in the case of intelligence, might 
suffice for immediate practical requirements, could we but de- 
vise methods of measuring temperamental characteristics as 
satisfactory as those now used for measuring intelligence. 
The concrete significance of general intelligence testing is 
difficult to describe. It is conceivable that some occupation 
will show a perfect degree of correspondence between score and 
success. If such an occupation were ever found the application 
of the test to candidates for positions in that occupation would 
be seen to be the best measure possible. No one expects to find 
such an occupation. That correspondence between school suc- 
cess and the tests is relatively high is shown above. Clerical 
workers succeed in general in proportion to score; but many 
other factors are to be considered even in these cases of positive 
correlation.* 
An illustration of a negative correlation or correspondence is 
given in the following table compiled from records of a 
group of machine operators. Here the correlation between 
production and the army test scores is —.087. 
Distribution tables comparing score and errors and score and 
combined production and errors for this special group of oper- 
ators give similar results. Two things are at once apparent. 
A number of girls are putting in their time on work at which 
they do not excel. Some of these have high intelligence scores, 
some have extremely low scores, but neither group is producing 
results comparable with those of a third group of girls whose 
intelligence is nearer the average for the entire group. In the 
second place the evidence points definitely to other factors than 
intelligence as important in determining the success of an op- 
erator. 
In this instance the intelligence test may be said to have 
shown that certain girls are not doing work in which they excel. 
* See an excellent discussion of the problem in an article by T. L. Kelley 
in The Journal of Applied Psychology, March, 1919, entitled “Principles 
Underlying the Classification of Men.”

    PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 203 
The problem of finding what they would excel in is, of course, 
untouched. The results also indicate the need for a more de- 
tailed analysis of the particular task. 
The list of cautions in the use of tests is already a long one, 
but many more might be added. In this chapter certain fields 
that are open and ready for the intensive labor that accom- 
panies research have been described briefly. The most dan- 
gerous thing that can happen is to have education, economics, 
sociology and industry accept the results of mental tests un- 
critically and with haste for immediate service that does not 
permit careful study and additional research. The army dem- 
onstration has proved conclusively the value of psychological 
investigations. But it established another idea equally im- 
portant—the value of group coéperation. 
The following quotation from Lieut. Commander Dodge em- 
phasizes this point: 
Value of Group Cobperation 
“The list of incompleted services that were cut short of full 
fruition by the signing of the armistice would be too long to 
even mention here, though it would include some of the more 
difficult and important enterprises of psychological service. 
“The most important facts that appeared in the war work ° 
of the psychologists were, first, the value of the applications of 
the principles of psychology to concrete military problems; and, 
second, the importance of codperation in practical scientific 
service. To the military tasks the psychologists brought their 
appreciation of the distinctly human and mental aspects of the 
problems that were involved, their training in the technic of 
mental analysis, their laboratory methods for estimating human 
reactions, and their ingenuity in developing new instruments 
for special purposes. 
“But in no case was the necessary skill and practical expe- 
rience in the possession of any one person. The best work of the 
psychologists was the product of group coéperation for which
-P-A-G-E-218
eT ee ET ee Ee ee ee ae 
204 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
the far-sighted guidance of the chairman, Major R. M. Yerkes, 
and his colleagues of the National Research Council was an 
important condition. Success in our undertakings would have 
been impossible without the will to coéperate with each other, 
with representatives of the other sciences, with employment 
managers, industrial and educational experts, as well as with 
| officers of the Army and Navy. While it was not always easy 
| to convince responsible persons that we could help, when they 
were once convinced the only limit to our service was the limit 
of human endurance. At the end of the war, avenues were 
opening for genuine codperation in scientific matters between 
the various scientific bodies of the Allies. 
“ At the conclusion of our war work two real dangers confront 
us, one military and the other social. The military danger is 
that with the passing of the military crisis we shall stop our 
study of the mental factors in war. If some other country 
with more permanent policies should take up the mental anal- 
yses where we have left them, and develop a real military 
psychology, they would have a military instrument vastly more 
effective than 42-cm. guns. 
“But even if the efforts of our statesmen are successful and 
war is forever abolished, the relative importance of psycholog- 
ical offensives will not be diminished. On the contrary, when 
mental weapons become the only legitimate means for securing 
national ends they will become increasingly more important. 
Whether the reconstruction is military or non-military, the 
need of codperative studies of vital mental problems and of 
coéperative efforts at scientific mental engineering will certainly 
not be less important for society than the scientific and engineer- 
ing problems that concern material things. In view of these 
future needs, our war-time activities, however interesting, and 
however successful they may have been, seem relatively trivial 
and insignificant.”  
-P-A-G-E-219
  CHAPTER VI 
ARMY TEST RECORD BLANKS AND FORMS 
The different forms of the tests and other printed materials 
used in psychological examining in the army are reproduced in 
this chapter. The keys for the alpha forms have been placed 
after the rules for scoring, pp. 70-77. No key is given for test 1, 
since the paper is easily scored by referring to the directions 
or a key can be made on a separate copy of the page for test 1. 
Form 0 of beta, the only form used in the army, is reproduced 
with correct answers indicated where needed. Keys for these 
tests are also easily made. 
Form 5 alpha and form 0 beta are reproduced original size. 
The separate tests in the alpha booklets were arranged so that 
test 1 came on the outside page as shown. Test 2 was on the 
right-hand inside page. Test 8 was placed upside down on the 
second or left-hand page of the booklet. Tests 3 and 4 followed 
test 2 on succeeding right-hand pages. From the back tests 5, 
6, 7 and 8 came in order. This arrangement assisted in keeping 
the subject from looking ahead or correcting the previous test 
after time was called.

TEST 3 © 
This is a test of common sense. Below are sixteen questions. 
Three answers are given to each question. You are to look at 
the answers carefully; then make a cross in the square before 
the best answer to each question, as in the sample: 
Why do we use stoves? Because 
SAMPLE they look well   
  
  
    {x] they keep us warm 
| CJ they are blac! 
Here the second answer is the best one and is marked with 
across. Begin with No. 1 and keep on until time is called. 
  
1 Cats are useful animals, be- 
cause 
jj they catch mice 
they are gentle 
they are afraid of dogs 
2 Why are pencils more com- 
monly carried than foun- 
tain pens? Because 
they are brightly colored 
[Asthey are cheaper 
they are not so heavy 
8 Why is leather used for 
shoes? Because 
it is produced in all 
countries 
lit wears well 
Cit is an animal product 
4 Why judge a man by what, 
he does rather than by 
what he says? Because 
{what a man does shows 
* what he really is 
(1 it is wrong to tell a lie 
a deaf man cannot 
hear what is said 
5 If you were asked what you 
thought of a person whom   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  
  
  
      you didn’t know, what’ 
should you say? 
I will go and get ac- 
quainted 
I think he is all right 
DAN don’t know him and 
can’t say   
  
  
  
6 Streets are sprinkled in 
summer 
to make the air cooler 
Lito keep automobiles 
from skidding 
keep down dust   
    
  7 Why is wheat better for 
food than corn? Because 
Lit is more nutritious 
(Jit is more expensive 
it can be ground finer   
  
8 If a man made a million 
dollars, he ought to 
pay off the national debt 
contribute to various 
“worthy charities 
give it all to some poor 
man

9 Why do many peisons pre- 
fer automobiles to street 
cars? Because 
C an auto is made of higher 
_grade materials 
Zhan automobile is more 
convenient 
street cars are not as safe

sists on it 
it avoids confusion and 
collisions   
  
      
12 Why do inventors patent 
their inventions? Because

TEST 3 
This is a test of common sense. Below are sixteen questions. 
Three answers are given to each question. You are to look at 
the answers carefully; then make a cross in the square before 
the best answer to each question, as in the sample: 
Why do we use stoves? Because 
they look well 
x] they keep us warm 
they are black   
  
SAMPLE   
  
  
      
Here the second answer is the best one and is marked with 
across. Begin with No. 1 and keep on until time is called. 
  
  
1 If plants are dying for lack give it to the first poor   
of rain, you should 
water them 
ask a florist’s advice 
put fertilizer around 
them 
2 A house is better than a 
tent, because 
it costs more 
it is more comfortable 
it is made of wood 
3 Why does it pay to get a 
good education? Because 
it makes a man more 
useful and happy 
it makes work for teach- 
ers 
Dit makes demand for 
buildings for schools 
and colleges 
4 If the grocer should give 
you too much money in 
making change, what is the 
right thing to do?

  man you meet 
tell him of his mistake   
  
5 Why should food be chewed 
before swallowing? 
it is better for the health 
it is bad manners to 
swallow without chew- 
ing 
chewing keeps the teeth 
in condition   
  
  
  
  
  
6 If you saw a train ap- 
proaching a broken track 
you should 
telephone for an am- 
bulance 
signal the engineer to 
stop the train 
look for a piece of rail to 
fit in   
  
  
  
  
  
7 If you are lost in a forest in 
the daytime, what is the 
thing to do?

use the sun or a compass 
for a guide 
8 It is better to fight than to 
run, because 
cowards are shot 
it is more honorable 
if you run you may get 
shot in the back 
9 Why are warships painted 
gray? Because gray paint 
is cheaper than other 
colors 
is more durable than 
other colors 
makes the ships harder 
to see 
10 Why should all parents be 
made to send their children 
0 school? Because 
it prepares them for 
adult life 
it keeps them out of 
mischief 
they are too young to 
work 
11 The reason that many birds 
sing in the spring is 
to let us know spring is 
here 
to attract their mates 
to exercise their voices 
12 Gold is more suitable than 
iron for making money be- 
cause 
gold is pretty 
iron rusts easily   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
  223 
C gold is scarcer and more 
valuable 
13 The cause of echoes is 
the reflection of sound 
waves 
the presence of electric- 
ity in the air 
the presence of moisture 
in the air 
14 We see no stars at noon be- 
cause 
they havemoved around 
to the other side of the 
earth 
they are so much fainter 
than the sun 
they are hidden behind 
the sky 
15 Some men lose their breath 
on high mountains because 
the wind blows their 
breath away 
the air is too rare 
it is always cold there 
16 Why do some men who 
could afford to own a house 
live in a rented one? Be- 
cause 
they don’t have to pay 
taxes 
they don’t have to buy 
a rented house 
they can make more by 
investing the money the 
house would cost

TEST 3 
This is a test of common sense. Below are sixteen questions. 
Three answers are given to each question. You are to look at 
the answers carefully; then make a cross in the square before 
the best answer to each question, as in the sample: 
Why do we use stoves? Because   
  
  
SAMPLE   
  
      they look well 
x] they keep us warm 
they are black 
Here the second answer is the best one and is marked with 
across. Begin with No. 1 and keep on until time is called. 
  
  Why are chairs made of 
wood? Because 
[4 wood is cheap and light 
(J wood burns 
wood is easily broken 
2 If a person asks you for 
something you do not have 
tell him to mind his bus- 
iness 
say you don’t have it 
walk away 
If it rains when you are 
starting to go for the doc- 
tor, what should you do? 
L] stay at home 
J take an umbrella 
wait until it stops rain- 
ing 
4 If you are in danger of sun- 
stroke what should you do? 
take off your shoes 
_] run to the hospital 
(J get in the shade or wet 
your head 
5 If you find a man who has 
hanged himself, you should   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
    
send a notice to the 
paper 
take him home 
x call a doctor or the 
police   
  
  
  
  
6 Why is tennis good exer- 
cise? Because 
it calls for vigorous 
movement 
it demands clear eyes 
it is very exciting   x   
  
  
  
  
7 If while on the march you 
get bitten by a rattlesnake, 
you should 
kill the snake 
suck the poison from 
the wound 
run back to camp and 
get some whiskey   
  
  
F   
  
      
8 If you are hurrying in an 
auto to catch a train and 
come to a broken bridge, 
what should you do? 
go around and try an- 
other road   
      
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  
    
  ARMY TEST RECORD BLANKS AND FORMS 
[ltake off your clothes 
and swim across 
      hire a horse and ride 
across 
9 Why do some people think 
that short men should be 
admitted to the army? 
Because   
[2] usefulness does not de- 
pend on height   
they want to enlist   
  
  
10 If 
sh   
  
  
  
  
    
ll El 
th; they are more intelligent 
than tall men 
you find a lost 2-year-old 
baby on a city street, what 
ould you do? 
ask him where he lives 
and take him there 
if he is a nice child take 
him home and keep 
him 
ask the police to help 
you or leave him with 
them 
ectric lights are better 
an gas lights because

  makes a white light 
is safer and more con- 
venient, 
is cheaper 
hy is a check better than 
real money? Because 
checks are cleaner than 
bills 
      you can have all the a eT ee ee ey ar ee 
237 
money you need by 
writing checks   
checks are safer and   
more convenient 
13 Five P.M. is the rush hour 
on street cars because   
  work people are going 
home at that hour   
so many people live in   
the suburbs   
street cars are the best   
cheap means of trans- 
portation 
14 Why should people not 
waste food in time of war?   
we could eat less and not   
starve   
food is scarce in war-   
time   
food costs money   
15 Y 
to 
because ou should not give money 
beggars on the street 
  
it makes it hard for the   
beggars to get work   
it takes away the work   
of organized charities   
it encourages living off   
16 A others 
country should have 
any railroads, because   
they decrease the price   
of food materials   
they make it easy to   
travel and carry goods   
    they are good for the   
steel business

  276 ARMY MENTAL TESTS 
GROUP EXAMINATION BETA 
On the record blank the tests of Group Examination Beta 
were printed in the order 1 to 8, but the blank form for name, 
rank, age, et cetera, was placed on the last page of the record 
blank above test 8,1 instead of on the first page above test 1, 
as in the case of examination alpha. This was done in order 
to prevent the subject from examining the mazes of test 1 
while awaiting directions for filling in the general information 
blanks. 
The beta tests as reproduced in this book are marked cor- 
rectly (keyed), with the exception of tests 4 and 6. For the 
latter the missing parts are as follows: picture 1, mouth; 2, eye; 
3, nose; 4, spoon; 5, chimney; 6, ear; 7, filament; 8, stamp; 
9, strings; 10, rivet; 11, trigger; 12, tail; 13, leg; 14, shadow; 
15, ball; 16, net; 17, hand; 18, horn; 19, reflection of hand 
holding powder puff; 20, diamond in upper left corner. 
1 Test 8, although printed on the record blank, was not used.

REPORT. 
The accompanying statistics will show what has been done 
in the way of public school education in the State during the 
scholastic year which has just closed. 
It can be readily seen, by comparing the statistics of this re- 
port with those of former years, that the interest in public edu- 
cation is rapidly improving. 
There is practically no opposition to public education in Ten- 
nessee, but the universal sentiment of the people is for longer 
school terms, and better school facilities. 
The County Courts of the various counties of the State are 
realizing more and more the important part they have to per- 
form in building up our public school system. This is shown 
by the increased appropriations made for school purposes. 
The following circular of information was issued from this 
office April 13th, 1887, to wit : 
CIRCULAR OF. INFORMATION TO COUNTY SUPERINTEND- 
ENTS AND DISTRICT DIRECTORS. 
Department or Pusnic InstRucTION, 
Nasuvitiz, Trenn., April 13th, 1887. 
To County Superintendents and District Directors : 
From the numerous letters received at this office it is evident — 
that, in many instances, County Superintendents and District 
Directors do not fully understand their duties— 
First—As to how school districts are formed, and as to what 
constitutes a school-district.
-P-A-G-E-37
38 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
Second—As to the number of pupils necessary to constitue a 
school. 
Third—As to the length of school session. 
Fourth—As to the term of office of District Directors when 
appointed. 
Fifth—As to the adoption of text-books. 
HOW SCHOOL-DISTRICTS ARE FORMED. 
First—The school-district and the civil district are identical, 
except where the County Court, through its Commissioners, 
establish a'school-district regardless of civil district lines. This 
ean be done only by Commissioners appointed by the County 
Court for that purpose. District Directors have no power to 
establish school-districts. District Directors have the right to 
subdivide the school-district—that is, they have the right to 
say what pupils shall attend each school in the school-district. 
This authority was given to District Directors in order to dis- 
tribute the pupils as nearly equal as practicable to the several 
school-houses in the school-district, thus preventing the crowd- 
ing of one school at the expense of the others. The District 
Directors have the right to say what school each pupil shall 
attend. 
NUMBER OF PUPILS. 
Second—The number of pupils necessary to constitute a school 
is left entirely at the discretion of the District Directors. The 
location of school-houses, and the number of pupils to each 
house, must be’ determined by the District Directors, as they 
may deem to the best interests of all concerned. 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL SESSION. 
Third—As to the length of school session: All schools in 
any school-district must be taught the same number of days. 
The last apportionment of money is that made by the County 
Trustee to the school-district, so much per capita, according to 
scholastic population. The pupil does not draw money, but 
draws school days. If the pupils drew money, each one would
-P-A-G-E-38
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 39 
receive the same amount; as they draw school days, each pupil 
must receive the same number of school days. To give more 
school days to one school than to another school in the same 
school-distriet is an unjust discrimination, and a violation of 
law that should not be tolerated. 
TERM OF OFFICE. 
Fourth—As to the term of office of School Directors when 
appointed: When a vacancy occurs among the Directors in 
any school-district during their term of office, the remaining 
Directors shall fill the same by appointment, and the Director 
so appointed holds his office for the unexpired term, whether it 
be one or two years. If fronf any cause Directors shall not be 
elected on the first Thursday in August, the County Superintend- 
ent shall appoint them in districts failing to elect, and Direct- 
ors so appointed hold for three years. But one Director in 
each district can be elected at the annual August election. 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
Fifth—As to the adoption of text-books: District Directors 
alone have the right to adopt text-books for use in the public 
schools. A County Superintendent can suggest to the District 
Directors such changes in text-books as he may deem advisa- 
ble, when changes can be made without increased expense to 
the parent. No County Superintendent can himself adopt text- 
books for his county, nor can he appoint a committee for that 
purpose. Teachers have nothing to do in the adoption of text- 
books for the publie schools. The District Directors of any 
county may meet in convention and adopt text-books for the 
entire county. No district not represented in such convention 
is bound by the adoption, but its own Directors may adopt 
text-books for that district. When an adoption has been made

40 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
This circular has done much good in regulating the school 
term in the districts. 
In many districts in the State the District Directors, in the 
subdivision of the school-districts, have assigned, in some in- 
stances, more children to one house than to another, and would 
have a longer term at those houses where the larger number of 
children were assigned than in those houses where the smaller 
number were assigned. They did not realize that one. child 
should have as many school days as another. 
This unjust discrimination is about broken up, and there are 
but few districts where the Directors have refused to obey my 
instructions. I have ckosen mild means in order to correct this 
evil, and trust that I may be successful without resorting to the 
strong arm of the law. 
INSTITUTES. 
The Institutes for the scholastic year have been very success- 
ful. Besides those held under my special supervision, there 
were Institutes held in a majority of the counties of the State. 
These Institutes are doing much to improve the country school- 
teachers. But few of the country school-teachers have had 
any professional training, and the Institute is an important 
factor in supplying this deficiency. 
The following report was made to the Trustees of the Pea- 
_ body Education Fund, to wit:

STATE NORMAL INSTITUTE. 
A State Normal Institute will be held at Rockwood, Roane 
County, Tenn., beginning July 25th, and continuing one week, 
The Institute is intended specially for the counties of Rhea, 
Roane, Morgan, Scott, Fentress, and Cumberland. 
County Superintendents of said counties will please see that 
the schools of their respective counties are closed during the 
Institute week, so as to give the teachers an opportunity to at- 
tend said Institute. 
Prof. T. C. Karns, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tenn., 
and G. R. R. Stuart, Centenary College, Cleveland, Tenn., have 
been employed to represent the State. 
The evenings will be devoted to popular lectures. 
Citizens and school officers are specially invited to attend.

TI had the pleasure of attending nearly all of these Institutes 
and witnessing the work; but to give a clearer idea of what 
was done, I herewith supreit the written reports of some of 
those who did the work. 
Prof. T. P. Brennan, of this city, who was Principal of the 
Institute at Cookeville, writes thus : 
Superintendent Smith : 
_ Dear Smr—A short report could not do the Cookeville Insti- 
tute full justice, for it was remarkable in many respects. 
From the fear of failure its members soon changed into the 
pride of success, and never did members achieve more growth - 
in love of our grand work in so short a time before I am quite 
certain. 
From the very successful “ start’ you and your most efficient 
co-worker, Professor Abernathy, gave us, we mounted higher 
day by day for three weeks. The first week showed an enroll- 
ment of fifty teachers; the second and third saw the number
-P-A-G-E-42

rise to seventy-five. The closing evening found usin a crowded 
hall receiving every testimonial that a satisfied people could 
give. 
I was alone from the time of your departure, but was so as- 
sisted by a band of earnest workers that my labor was a “ sum- 
mer recreation in Putnam County.” 
We were indebted to the citizens of Cookeville, and all the 
surrounding towns and counties, for a constant stream of vis- 
itors. 
The Normal seeds have been sown in Putnam County by you, 
and you can depend on its growth. 
The organization of a County Association was effected, and 
left in good working order. Most respectfully, 
T. P. Brennan.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—With reference to the Tennessee State Normal 
Institutes which I was employed by you to conduct this year, 
I beg leave to report as follows: 
The first was held at Smithwood, Knox County, Tenn., be- 
ginning July 11th, 1887. Owing to ill-health, I did not arrive 
till the second day, but the Institute was conducted in the 
meantime by County Superintendent J. W. Saylor and other 
assistants. I fail to have at hand the list of teachers attending 
this Institute, but I think the number reached about seventy.
-P-A-G-E-43
44. TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
The visitors were numerous, perhaps altogether reaching about 
three hundred or four hundred. Judge H. H. Ingersoll, Col. 
W. A. Henderson, Hon. W. L. Ledgerwood, Hon. William 
Rule, and yourself delivered popular lectures. The attendance 
was from Knox and adjoining counties. The Institute con- 
tinued for five days, and closed with amass-meeting on Friday. 
On the following Monday I opened the second Institute at 
Newport, Cocke County, Tenn. This was July 18th. 1887. I 
was assisted by Profs. P. R. Driscol, N. E. W. Stokely, J. H. 
Wagner, J. W. Lucas, and others. Prof. M. R. Abernathy was 
special assistant on the part of the State. Popular addresses 
were delivered by Hon. J. B. Stokely, Dr. R. C. Smith, yourself, 
and others. Fifty-four teachers were enrolled. The visitors 
were numerous, perhaps three hundred. This Institute also 
continued five days. 
The next I held at Rockwood, Roane County, Tenn., begin- 
ning July 25th, 1887. In this I was assisted by Prof. M. R. 
Abernathy on the part of the State; also by Prof. W. L. Mor- 
rison, County Superintendent 8. W. Gage, and others. Popu- 
lar addresses were delivered by 8. C. Brown, M. R. Abernathy, 
W. E. Stephens, 8. W. Tindell; and yourself. The number of 
teachers enrolled was seventy-eight; the number of visitors 
probably four hundred. The interest among both teachers and 
citizens was very great. 
My report is purposely brief, and does not include a full 
account of all that was done at these Institutes. As the time 
was short, most of the work was effected through lectures. In 
some cases classes were brought forward and a practical demon- 
stration of methods was given. My work was directed almost 
exclusively to explaining the principles and practice of best 
methods of teaching, and thus to elevate the standard of edu- 
cation. The purpose was to make all instruction as natural 
and practical as possible. The teaching of the various branches 
required by the school law was included. The organization and 
grading of district schools I explained and urged. I think T 
can safely say that good was effected—apparently much good. 
Respectfully submitted, 
T. C. Karns.

SourHwksTeRN Baptist UNIVERSITY, 
Jackson, Tenn., October 14th, 1887. 
Hon. F. M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Herewith I have the honor to submit the report of the Nor- 
mal Institutes held at Troy and Henderson, Tenn. 
During their session we kept steadily in view the necessity 
of strengthening the public school system of the State in every 
possible way, and for that reason urged the grading of the 
schools and the maintenance of a perpetual Institute, with an 
annual Normal of a high grade, held by means of funds appro- 
priated by the County Court. 
State Normal Institute, held at Troy, Obion County, Tenn., 
June 13th to June 17th, inclusive: Number of teachers enrolled, 
46; number of visitors (estimated) daily, 100; number of pop- 
ular lectures, 3. : 
Outline of the course of work: History, J. B. Cummings ; 
School Management, C. S. Enfield; Arithmetic, J. H. Jackson 
and J. P. Strong; Geography, J. L. Lampson; English, A. P. 
Bourland. 
The teachers and citizens in attendance engaged vemy earn- 
estly in the discussion of these subjects, so that a constantly 
growing interest was maintained. 
State Normal Institute, held at Henderson, Chester County, 
Tenn., June 20th to June 24th, inclusive: Number of teachers 
enrolled, 72; number of visitors (estimated) daily, 150; number 
of popular lectures, 3. 
Outline of the course of work: History and Geography, J. 
H. ilieremon; Mathematics, J. B. Inman; Primary Methods, 
M.S. Abernathy; Drawing, Miss Sue Inman; Grading, F. M. 
Smith; English, A. P. Bourland. 
This Institute was of exceedingly great interest and of bene- 
ficial results. 
County Superintendent Stovall, of Obion, and County Super- 
intendent White, of Chester, made most earnest efforts to secure 
the highest success of both meetings, and their labors met fit- 
ting rewards. More interest in the great subject of education
-P-A-G-E-45

was aroused at both places, much of which was due to the 
earnest, powerful addresses of the State Superintendent. All 
of the workers were thoroughly imbued with the importance 
of their subjects, and, being teachers of experience, put great 
power into all that was done. Invariably our audiences grew 
from day to day, testifying of the outreachings of the work. 
At each place it was the policy to train Institute workers to 
keep alive the county organization which was made in both 
counties. 
At Troy active steps were taken to raise a sum to aid in de- 
fraying the traveling expenses of the State Superintendent. It 
was unanimously decided that to do this was nothing but a 
necessary act of justice. The matter was left in the hands of 
the following committee: C. S. Enfield, W. B. Stovall, J. H. 
Brice, and Misses Moore and Marshall. 
Respectfully, 
A. H. Bournanp, Principal. 
REPORT OF CAPT. W. R. GARRETT. 
Nasuvinuz, Tenn., October 20th, 1887. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tione Nashville, Tenn. : F 
Dear Str—In accordance with your request, I submit the 
following report of the Institutes conducted by me during the 
summer of 1887: 
During the two weeks including the last week of June and 
the tirst week of July, I conducted a County Institute at Mun- 
ford, in Tipton County. This Institute was maintained by an 
appropriation of the County Court, and was held under the 
supervision of Prof. George D. Holmes, of Covington. The 
regular instructors were: Prof. James I. Hall in the depart- 
ments of Geography and Geology, Prof. W. R. Sims in the 
department of English, and myself in the departments of His- 
tory and Arithmetic. In addition to the regular instructors, 
several of the resident teachers gave valuable instruction in 
other branches. At the close of the Institute, the County Su- 
perintendent, Prof. Montgomery held an examination. About 
125 teachers were enrolled, and many of the citizens attended.
-P-A-G-E-46
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. AT 
About 300 persons were present during the sessions. This action 
of the County Court of Tipton deserves cordial approval. The 
results were seen in the improved grades of the teachers, as 
shown in the examination which followed, and in the increased 
interest of the teachers and people in the work of education. 
I hope that the example of Tipton County will be followed by 
every county in the State. 
During the month of August I held two State Institutes un- 
der your general supervision, beginning respectively at Spring- 
field, in Robertson County, on August Ist, and at Murfrees- 
boro, in Rutherford County, on August 8th. At both these 
Institutes my associate, Prof. M. R. Abernathy, gave instrue- 
tion in the department of Primary Work, and also delivered 
popular addresses at night. I took the departments of Geog- 
raphy and History, and lectured at night on other educational 
topics. 
At Springfield the Institute was held under the special super- 
vision of County Superintendent J. E. Ruffin, who acted as 
President. Miss Callie Johnson was appointed Secretary. We 
were indebted to the following teachers for efficient professional 
work: Prof. D. B. Bosthick on Arithmetic, Rev. R. W. Hooker 
on School Management, Prof. 8S. M. Griffin on Arithmetic. 
Other teachers gave interesting exercises on miscellaneous sub- 
jects. 
I herewith file the report of Superintendent Ruflin as a part 
of this report:

“ M. Cauiie Jounson, Secretary.” 
_ Thirty-two teachers were enrolled. About one hundred 
persons came in contact with the Institute during its progress. 
County Superintendent Ruffin deserves our thanks for his 
zealous and active efforts to promote the success of the work. 
The schools of the county were in session at the time, and 
many of the teachers were prevented from attending. Those 
in attendance, however, manifested a laudable interest. In view 
of the fact that many of the county schools begin about the 
first of August, I recommend that the summer Institutes should 
hereafter be held in June and July. 
At Murfreesboro we received a cordial welcome from the 
citizens. At the opening meeting, at which many of the lead- 
ing citizens were present, Hon. James D. Richardson delivered 
4

an address of welcome. I regret, however, to report that the 
attendance of teachers was very small. No report or list of 
enrollment having been furnished me by County Superintend- 
ent Nelson, under whose special supervision the Institute was 
held, I am unable to give the number of teachers enrolled. 
About one hundred and fifty of the citizens were present, and 
manifested an interest in our proceedings. 
T cannot close this report without testifying to the valuable 
services of my associate, Prof. M. R. Abernathy. His worl 
was sound, instructive, and interesting, and made a strong im- 
pression on those who heard him. I also return my thanks to 
yourself for the facilities and courtesies extended to me and to 
my associates in the discharge of our duties. As far as I can 
judge of the public sentiment, the people are warmly in favor 
of Institutes, and desire to see them placed on a permanent and 
systematic footing. I think you will be fully sustained by pop- 
ular sentiment in urging upon the Legislature and the County 
Courts to make provision for the permanent establishment of a 
system of State and County Institutes. 
Respectfully submitted, 
W.R. Garrett.

Hon. Frank M. Smith, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State 
of Tennessee : 3 
Str—Permit me to offer the following as a synopsis of In- 
stitutes held during July, 1887 : 
Institute held at Johnson City, Washington County, Tenn., 
under the supervision of Superintendent M. Nead, July 11th to 
15th, 1887: Number of teachers enrolled, 84; visitors, about 
150. 
At a night session of the Institute a lecture was delivered by

school-house was given, and the address closed with a vigorous 
appeal for a better order of things. 
Mr. Abernathy, of Purdy, Tenn., gave a highly enjoyable 
rendition. 
The Institute was Gagauicel Monday, July 11th, and con- 
tinued one week—Mr. D. L. Earnest, Secretary. 
Much valuable instruction in the work was given by my as- 
sistants, Messrs. E. W. Doran and D. L. Earnest. Mr. Doran 
presented the subjects of Arithmetic and Geography in an en- 
tertaining and instructive manner, giving to the teachers the 
very best modern educational methods on these subjects. Such 
instruction was given that the teachers could make practical 
application. 
We are indebted to Mr. Abernathy for an interesting talk 
on The Mother as a Natural Teacher in Reading. On the same 
subject—How to Get the Thoughts from the Printed Page; The 
Value of Poetry to a People. 
A Graded Course of Study for County Schools was presented 
by State Superintendent Smith. 
As a guide to the teachers, Long’s Language Exercises (Teach- 
er’s Edition) and White’s Industrial Drawing (Teacher’s Edi- 
tion) were recommended. 
On Geography, Mr. Doran impressed the necessity of begin- 
ning with the surroundings of the pupils, extending the teach- 
ing to distant countries—“from the known to the unknown.” 
By means of dissected maps was presented a method of awak- 
ening an interest among the pupils. 
Primary Arithmetic, according to the Grude Method, was 
clearly explained by Mr. Doran. 
The following Outline for the County Organization of Teach- 
ers was placed on the board by D. L. Earnest: 1. Benetits of 
Unity; 2. Acquaintance with Subjects Taught—Text Lessons; 
3. Educational Literature, Science, and Art of Teaching—Best 
Methods; 4. Comparison of Personal Experience—On Trouble. 
Mr. Earnest ably discussed Orthography, Advantages of 
Written over Oral Spelling, and Mispronounced Words.

for entertaining instruction in Primary Reading; to Miss Raine, 
ot Memphis, for music; to the following teachers for valuable 
aid during the sessions of the Institute: Messrs. King and Harr, 
of Sullivan County; Superintendent Cox, of Hamblen; J ae 
Watson, of Washington College; J. 8. Wilson, of Johnson 
City; J. Hopwood, of Milligan College; D. A. Bolton, of 
Athens; 8. G. Cartwright, of Bristol; Superintendent Wills, 
of Johnson County, and G. E. Swadley, of Unicoi County; 
and Mrs. Roxie Grisham, of Jonesboro, Tenn. 
Through the influence of Hon. W. P. Brownlow the teachers 
of the Institute enjoyed a free excursion to Cranberry, N. C._ 
The following resolutions were adopted : 
Wuernas, We, a body of teachers, assembled from the vari- 
ous counties of East Tennessee in a State Normal at Johnson 
City for the past week, have been greatly benefited; therefore, 
Resolved, That we, as officers and teachers, will endeavor in 
the future to attend all Normals and Institutes held within our 
reach, and also endeavor to induce others to attend. 
Resolved, That the act of the late Legislature of the State 
refusing to allow the State Superintendent his traveling ex- 
penses deserves to be condemned in unmeasured terms, and we 
regard such act as unwise and utterly unworthy an intelligent 
legislative body. 
Resolved, That we express our grateful appreciation of the 
generous hospitality and kindness of the citizens of Johnson 
City extended to us during the session of the Institute, and we 
tender them our sincere thanks for the same. Also our thanks 
are due Mrs. 1. T. Jobe for granting us the use of her organ, 
and to Miss Raine, of Memphis, and to Mrs. Hunter of John- 
son City, for the excellent music they rendered from time to: 
time for the benefit of the Institute. 
- Resolved, That our grateful thanks are due Hon. W. P. Brown- 
low for his efforts and-influence in securing, and to the Super- 
intendent of the road, Nimson, for granting, the privilege of a 
free excursion to Cranberry. : 
Resolved, That we extend to Professors Mason and Doran our 
thanks for the able manner in which they conducted said In- 
stitute.

July 19th, 1887—Institute met in the Rogersville Female 
Seminary, at Rogersville. 
Explanation of the work given by Mr., Mason; after which 
State Superintendent Frank M. Smith, being introduced, gave 
a talk on the necessity of Normal Schools, because of the infe- 
riority of country schools. 
Mr. Abernathy discussed Primary Reading. 
Through the kindness of Mrs. F. A. Ross the privilege was 
given of holding the sessions of the Institnte in the school- 
room of the Seminary. © 
Our success, judging from the interest manifested, was due to 
the untiring zeal and energy of Superintendent P. L. Cobb, of 
Hawkins County. He did every thing that could be done to 
render the sessions pleasant and interesting to teachers and 
visitors. 
This Institute, being more local in its character than the one 
at Johnson City, enabled us to better systematize our work. 
Mr. E. W. Doran presented the subjects of Arithmetic and 
Geography; Mr. D. L. Earnest, Language and Orthography; 
History and School Government, by Charles Mason. 
The instructors made a specialty of the objective point in 
teaching any branch of study, and then presented methods. 
The attendance was excellent, and an unusual interest taken 
by the teachers in every topic discussed. 
State Superintendent Frank M. Smith addressed the citizens 
of Rogersville on Educational Taxation, followed by entertain- 
ing recitations from Mr. Abernathy, of Purdy, Tenn. 
Miss Ilian Boynton, of Knoxville, Tenn., presented the Word 
Method for Beginners in such a way as to convince evely one 
of its superiority over any other.

REPORT OF PROF. S. A. MYNDERS. 
Lexineton AcaDEMY, 
Lexington, Tenn., October 18th, 1887. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Acting under your instructions, I conducted two Normal In- 
stitutes during the summer of 1887. Each Institute continued 
in session one week. 
At Lexington, June 27th, we enrolled one hundred and five 
teachers, eighteen directors, and had a large attendance of citi- 
zens at each session. 
At Como, Henry County, August 8th, we enrolled thirty- 
three teachers and five directors, and had a good attendance of 
teachers at the day sessions and a crowded house at the evening’ . 
sessions. 
At Lexington I was associated with Prof. M. R. Abernathy, 
of Purdy, Tenn. 
At Como, Prof. Mitchell, of Cottage Grove, rendered valuable 
assistance. 
In all my lectures and talks I endeavored to present the 
work of the public school-teacher in a practical manner. I~ 
gave special attention to the subject of systematizing and grad- 
ing the public schools, and suggested plans for the same, 
I lectured daily on “ School Management,” presenting plans 
for organization, classification, signals, ete., and for dealing 
  
-P-A-G-E-54
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 55 
with the many difficulties with which the district teacher has to ° 
contend. I emphasized the importance of the teacher himself 
being an example of order and system, and of removing all 
causes of disorder. The government of the school should be 
based on sound moral principles, as well as the instruction. 
I lectured daily on the Public School Branches of Study, 
giving very nearly the same methods as presented at our other 
State Institutes. Attention was given to the teaching by means 
of objects, sand-boards, nature, map-drawing, pictures, repro- 
duction of stories, ete. 
At each of these Institutes resolutions were adopted urging 
*an appropriation by the State Legislature; for carrying on In- 
stitute work in the State. I inclose a copy of the resolutions 
adopted at Lexington, which are as follows: 
« WuerEas, Capt. F.M. Smith, State Superintendent of Pub- 
lie Instruction of Tennessee, has honored Henderson County 
‘with one of the State Normal Institutes usually held in the 
State at this period; and in view of the self-sacrificing labors 
of Profs. M. R. Abernathy and 8. A. Mynders for higher and 
more advanced methods of presenting the subjects of element- 
ary education in our public schools, and the very great interest 
manifested by these eminent educators in this Institute, now 
coming to a close; therefore, be it 
“Resolved, That we, the teachers and friends of education, 
desiring to establish a permanent system of free public schools. 
adopting as nearly‘as possible the theories and methods advo- 
“cated by these men, do hereby express, in these resolutions, the 
heartfelt thanks for their labors and unbounded confidence in 
the solution of the mode of conducting and instructing the 
branches taught in them. 
“Be it further resolved, That, inasmuch as we feel unable to. de- 
velop and put into practice fully these principles, we, the teach- 
ers and people of Henderson County, do recommend that our 
representatives, both State and national, use their influence to 
procure the necessary aid to develop the theories and methods 
advocated by the State Superintendent and his employes in the 
educational interests of the State; and,

“Be it further resolved, That we feel a deep sense of gratitude 
to Capt. F. M. Smith, State Superintendent, who, without the 
aid of the State funds, has blessed Henderson County with his 
wide-souled love of education by giving the county a State 
Normal, and attending the same in person.

REPORT OF CAPT. C. 8S. DOUGLASS. 
Prof. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public Instruction : 
Duar S1x—In accordance with your instructions, and under 
your general supervision, I conducted two Normal Institutes 
during the month of July, 1887—one at Lafayette, Macon 
Jounty, beginning July 11th, continuing three days, Superin- 
tendent Houser, President; the other at Carthage, Smith Coun- 
ty, July 27th, lasting also three days, Dr. Crutchfield, Chair- 
man. 
The total attendance of teachers was about thirty, and most: 
of the time a fine audience from the towns and vicinity. 
Of course we had many difticulties to contend with, as this 
plan of operation was comparatively new, and many of the 
teachers hesitated at first to assist or even take part; however, 
when they saw and appreciated the fact that we were there to 
aid and assist them, and that our aims and purposes were 
simply the building up of the educational system, they soon 
put their shoulders like men to the work. 
In accordance with your good advice, I did everything in 
my power to make the work practical, plain, and to the point. _
-P-A-G-E-56
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 57 
A programme for each day was arranged, consisting of routine 
school work, which was not only thoroughly discussed, but, 
when necessary, carefully demonstrated upon a board. 
Especial care was given at both places to the important sub- 
jects of organization and classification, together with that of 
school management in full, at least once a day, and frequently 
twice. I delivered a lecture on Pedagogies, in which there was 
a deep interest manifested. At the Lafayette Institute exercises 
were conducted at night; and witnessed by large audiences. 
Your good judgment in addressing the work to the people, 
as well as to the teachers, was thoroughly vindicated by the in- 
terest manifested on every hand, and a disposition to encourage 
our work, and when necessary, to co-operate heartily with us. 
Among the many obstacles that seriously impede educational 
progress in the localities that I visited, I found none more 
hurtful than the want of a uniform system of text-books. 
They were using every variety, and nearly every teacher had 
his hobby. However, we succeeded in adopting unanimously 
in both counties resolutions looking toward uniformity, and 
naming the day upon which the people should take action in 
the inatter. They became thoroughly aroused to the impor- 
tance of the matter, and seemed determined to prosecute it to 
a grand success. 
Again, good houses and school furniture were made an espe- 
cial theme on our part, as I learned that in these essentials, 
generally, that they were sadly deficient. This part of my 
work I addressed altogether to the citizens. 
I cannot speak too highly of Superintendents Houser and 
Jrutchfield, both energetic, live men, and disposed by energy 
and application to place their counties abreast with the educa- 
tional column. : 
The teachers were‘anxious to learn every new method, seemed 
devoted to their work, and expressed much gratitude that the 
State Superintendent was exerting an especial interest in their 
behalf. 
At both places, as your representative, I was the recipient of 
every courtesy and attention, and feel truly grateful for many 
kindnesses extended. 
_As to the other two counties, Clay and Jackson, to which [
-P-A-G-E-57
58 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
was instructed to go, I will simply say that I did every thing 
possible to induce their Superintendents to name the day and 
call their teachers together, but to no purpose. 
I attribute this lethargy principally to the mere nominal 
salary that is generally paid Superintendents in these counties, 
not enough to encourage them to take an interest in the matter ; 
and, again, the tax is not sufficient to run their schools but a 
few months in the year. 
Could our energetic State Superintendent pay those upper 
counties a short business trip in the spring, and give them the 
advantage of his vim and good judgment, ‘I am satistied that 
much good might be accomplished, and a general improvement 
felt all along the line. 
Tn closing this short report I would state that I am satisfied 
that the Institutes did much good, and that it will only be neces- 
sary to follow them up next summer with live and active work- 
ers, continuing at least a week at each place, developing fully 
the normal methods, and demonstrating the modern system of 
the day, a rich harvest will be the result. 
The public school system never had a deeper hold upon the 
hearts of our people that at present, and our outlook is growing 
more brilliant every year. To your care is committed its prog- 
ress and maintenance, and I feel assured that, with a continuance 
of that zeal and energy already displayed in your arduous work, 
a near future will record a grand and glorious success. 
Respectfully submitted, C. S. Dovatass. 
PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The scholarships to the State Normal College have been much 
sought after thisyear. I adopted the plan of holding an exam- 
ination in each county in the State, having in view a twofold 
object—first, to get the very best material for the College pos- 
sible; second, to advertise the school, and thus have the people 
to inquire into the merits of the institution. I was successful 
on both counts. More than 300 applicants attended the exami- 
nations, and twice as many letters were received at this office 
urging the claims of the different applicants. Circulars were 
sent to newspapers, with request to publish, giving notice of 
 
-P-A-G-E-58

the examination, a copy of which is herewith submitted, and 
marked No. 1. . 
Then another circular was sent to each County Superintend- 
ent in the State, which is also submitted, and marked No. 2. 
A third circular was also prepared and sent to each county 
for general distribution to young men and young women who 
were desirous of becoming teachers. A copy of this circular is 
also submitted, and marked No. 3.

GENERAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STATE NORMAL COLLEGE, 
NASHVILLE, TENN. ‘ 
The State Normal College was opened with appropriate cere- 
monies at the Capitol, in Nashville, Tenn., on Wednesday, the 
ist day of December, 1875, and is designed for the professional 
education and training of teachers, and “ practice in all grades 
of instruction.” 
Apmisston.—Persons applying for admissions (except those 
desiring to obtain scholarships), must not be under “sixteen 
years of age nor over thirty.” Candidates must present a cer- 
tificate of good moral character and presumed good health; must . 
declare their intention to become teachers, and their willingness 
to observe faithfully the regulations and perform the duties 
required while members of the Institution ;.and pass a satisfac- 
tory examination in the ordinary grammar-school studies, viz.: 
Reading, Spelling, Writing, Grammar, Geography, Arithmetic, 
Elementary Geology, and History of the United States. 
The diploma of the College is given to those only who have 
completed the entire course satisfactorily, and on all such the 
degree of “Licentiate of Instruction” is formally conferred. 
A law of the State of Tennessee directs that “the possession of 
such diploma shall exempt the holder thereof from the exami- 
nation prescribed as a condition precedent to employment in 
the public schools of that State, any such graduate being eligi- 
ble as a teacher in any ccunty of the State.” 
Tuition is at present free, as no persons are admitted to the 
privileges of the College except those who wish to prepare 
themselves for the teacher’s profession. 
Expenses.—Gentlemen usually pay from $15 to $18 a month 
‘for board in approved boarding-houses or private families. 
Ladies pay, in best private families, $18 to $20 a month; $6 a 
year is paid for the use of such books, etc., as are furnished by 
the College, and for a portion of the incidental expenses. On 
commencing work in the Chemical Laboratory, each student 
deposits with the professor $5, to cover in part or entirely ex- 
pense of “breakage;” the balance will be returned at the close 
of the year. }

The annual session opens on the first Wednesday in October, 
and closes with the annual commencement on the last Wednes- 
day in May. There is no vacation during the session, except 
the Christmas holidays. 
REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AND HOLDING PEABODY SCHOLARSHIPS 
: AT THE STATE NORMAL COLLEGE, NASHVILLE, TENN. 
The following requirements are taken from the Catalogue of 
the College: 
1. The applicant for a scholarship must be at least 17 years 
of age, present to the President of the College a certificate of 
irreproachable moral character, gentlemanly or ladylilke habits,

of his State, for reasons deemed by him suflicient. This decla- 
ration must be made and signed in good faith in duplicate—one 
to be placed on file in the State Superintendent’s office, and the 
other transmitted by him to the President of the College. It

of Public Instruction for his State a certificate that he has 
passed a satisfactory examination before said Superintendent, or 
other competent person duly authorized, in the studies required

alysis, Rhetoric, Geography, Civil and Physical Arithmetic, 
Algebra, Book-keeping, Physiology, United States History, 
Elements of Geology. No particular text-books are prescribed 
for this examination. The candidate should give evidence of 
such knowledge of the above branches as would justify omitting

3. Gentlemen or ladies thus admitted, who complete the pre-
-P-A-G-E-61
62 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT.

(ary 
4. Persons desiring to enter the Senior Class will be examined 
at the College upon the studies of the middle class in addition

connected, and in good standing, will receive $25 at the close of 
each month during the session. The amount will, in no case, 
exceed $200 per annum for two years. It is expected that this 
money will be appropriated by the student to the payment of 
board and other College expenses first of all, and no certificate 
or diploma will be granted to any student known to be in 
arrears in these respects. 
6. These scholarships will, in no case, be continued to stu-

I cannot submit this report without saying a few words con- 
cerning this noble institution. No institution in the State has 
a firmer hold upon the hearts of our people, because no other 
is so well equipped for the special training of teachers. 
I give the following extract from the message of Gov. Robt. 
LL. Taylor to the last General Assembly, viz. : 
“The State Normal College, situated in the City of Nashville, 
and devoted to the training of young men and women for the 
profession of teaching, is the best of its kind in the South. It 
should be fostered and sustained by the State, because the effi- 
ciency of the publicschools depends upon the training and 
qualifications of the teachers. I recommend that the sum of 
ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the annual appropriation which 
has for some years been given to this institution, be made for 
its support.” * ‘

of $1,200 is given the State Superintendent to defray the ex- 
penses of Institutes. 
How long will it be before we shall have a General Assembly 
that shall fully realize the importance of this work, and make 
liberal appropriations for the same? 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
This institution has taken upon itself new life, and is rapidly 
winning its way into public favor. Dr. Dabney has already 
shown himself a strong man, well fitted for the position he oe- 
cupies. County and City Superintendents should do all they 
ean to encourage young men to attend this institution. 
The following circular was issued from this office: 
DepartMENt or Pusiic Insrrucrion, 
Nasuvittez, Trenn., September 12th, 1887. 
To County and City Superintendents: 
I wish to call your attention to the law requiring an exami- 
nation of applicants for scholarships in the University of Ten-

_nessee. The time is far advanced, but it. is not yet too late to 
transmit to me lists of those qualified to enter. 
The management of the University has lately been wholly 
changed, and the institution now bids fair to soon become all 
that the people of the State teould wish. Dr. C. W. Dabney, 
Jr., late State Chemist of North Carolina, has been elected 
President. He is scholarly and progressive to the highest de- 
gree, and, without doubt, is one of the foremost educators of this 
country. He is now re-organizing the University on an indus- 
trial and technical, as well classical, basis. Improvements of — 
all kinds are being made, and in every respect the new manage- 
ment is such that I can unqualifiedly commend it to the young 
men of the State. 
Dr. Dabney, in his letter of acceptance, makes clear his full 
appreciation of the situation when he says: “There is a de- 
mand for a ‘new education’—the education of the hand and 
heart as well as the head. iy c * Already the de- 
mand is heard in Tennessee. It is in the air; we feel it. A 
day of vast material development is upon us. The watchmen 
upon the walls round about proclaim the dawn. They call 
every man to go to work in the ripened harvest. + 
We propose to educate the whole man; to educate the eye to 
judge and the hand to hew to the line, as well as the brain to 
reason and rémember facts. At the same time we must not be 
understood to depreciate classical education. But your institu- 
tion was established to educate the industrial classes. It is a 
college of agriculture and mechanic arts. It has thus its own 
~peculiar tield, distinct from that of any other institution in the 
State. It shall be our aim to build it to occupy this field.” 
As the highest school authorities in your respective counties 
and cities, you can rest assured that your State University is in 
good hands, and you can make your appointments accordingly. 
Your attention is directed to the law on the subject. By direct- 
ing proper young men to the University you will do both them 
and humanity an everlasting good. : 
For particular information, address Dr. C. W. Dabney, Pres- 
ident, Knoxville, Tenn. Use blank recommendations sent. 
Yours truly, Frank M. Srra, 
Superintendent.

CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPERINTEND- 
ENTS. 
- During the month of November I called a convention of 
County Superintendents to meet in the city of Nashville on 
December 6th. This convention met, and was in session two 
days. I regard this as the most important convention of edu- 
cators ever held in the State. 
A permanent organization was effected, and in the future the 
Jounty and City Superintendents will meet annually in the city 
of Nashville on the second Tuesday of December. A full 
report of the proceedings of said convention is herewith sub- 
mitted, to wit: 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONVENTION OF COUNTY SUPER- 
INTENDENTS, HELD IN THE CITY OF NASHVILLE DE- 
CEMBER 6TH AND 7TH, 1887. 
FIRST DAY—MORNING SESSION. 
On the Ist day of November Prof. Frank M. Smith, State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, issued the following cir- 
cular letter: 
“A convention of County Superintendents of Public Instrue- 
tion is hereby called to meet in mv office, in the city of Nash- 
ville, on Tuesday and Wednesday, December 6th and 7th, 1887,

72 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
“T trust that each County Superintendent will feel in duty 
bound to attend this meeting, as it will be, in many respects, 
the most important educational convention ever held in the 
State.” 
In answer to this call, Superintendent Smith received letters 
from nearly all the County Superintendents and most of the 
City Superintendents in the State, expressing a desire to attend 
the meeting. 
At 10 o’clock on the day appointed the State Superintendent 
called the convention to order, and Rev. Dr. ©. D. Elliott 
offered an appropriate prayer. 
Upon a roll-call of the counties the following County Super- 
intendents answered :

On motion of Mr. Thorne, of Henderson, Capt. C. 8. Doug- 
lass, Superintendent of the Public Schools of Gallatin, was 
elected President, and upon motion of Mr. Saylor, of Knox, 
David G. Ray, of the Nashville Bahner, was elected Secretary. 
Upon taking the chair, Mr. Douglass made a very appropri- 
ate acknowledgment of the honor conferred upon him, and in- 
troduced the Rev. Dr. O. P. Fitzgerald, editor of the Nashville 
Christian Advocate, who delivered the following address of wel- 
, _ come: 
“ Messrs. County Superintendents : 
“In the name of that distinguished member of the Smith 
family who is the official father of all the school children of the 
great Commonwealth of Tennessee; in the name of their hun- 
dreds of thousands of fond mothers who pet, scold, and spoil 
them; in the name of the hundreds of thousands of fathers 
who do the same thing, minus the petting; in the name of the 
great army of school directors who fail to direct, and the few 
who do; in the name of the public school-masters and school- 
ma’ams who wrestle with the stupidity, the waywardness and 
wickedness of the youth of the State between the ages of six 
and twenty-one; in the name of the whole 600,000 boys and 
girls, the hoydens and hobbledehoys, the premature little ciga- 
rette smokers in the cities, and their imitators in the towns and 
villages, the barefooted little rascals who rob birds’ nests and 
throw stones at every thing in the country, the town misses that 
swallow the dictionary figuratively, the country maidens that 
learn the three R’s by pedagogical aid, and all the little arts of 
harmless and fascinating coquetry by instinct; in the name of 
the citizens of this proud Capital, set like a jewel in the basin
-P-A-G-E-73
74 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
of beautiful Middle Tennessee; in the name of the good God, 
who loves his children great and small, I bid you a hearty wel- 
come to the city of Nashville, and extend to you its hospitalities 
while here in the discharge of the important duties for which 
you have met in this State Convention. 
“T welcome you thus heartily because I regard your conven- 
tion as a sign of educational progress. Much has been accom- 
plished by you and your predecessors since the war. Every 
thing was broken to pieces in that great convulsion, and recon- 
struction was no easy task. It would have been an impossible : 
one had you not had the elements of a Christian civilization so 
inwrought into the thought, conscience, and aspirations of the 
people that nothing short of thefr annihilation could destroy 
it. Like the real or fabled jointed snake, every broken frag- 
ment of your organism—religious, educational, political, social 
—was vital, and just as soon as repressing and disturbing in- 
fluences from abroad were withdrawn, these elements came to- 
gether i in a new order and took a new growth. Nothing in all 
the history of this world equals the progress made by the 
South in the two decades extending from 1867 to 1887. Hail 
to this new South! Hail to the old South, its mother! Away 
with the pessimistic croaker, with his eyes in the back of his 
head, who fails to greet the new era and to keep step with its 
procession! And away with the shallow and heartless ingrate 
and braggart who thinks that the glory of to-day can be 
made brighter by heaping dishonor upon the names of the men 
and women from whom we inherit all we possess, save the 
grand opportunity that comes to each generation in the evolu- 
tion of God’s gracious purpose to lead humanity forward in the 
pathway of an eyer-brightening destiny. 
“JT welcome you because you are to be regarded as chief fac- 
tors in producing a State school system worthy of the name. 
A State school system, I say. You are working to that end, 
but you have not reached it fully. The machirery lacks a few 
cogs, and it lacks more lubricating oil to make it run smoothly. 
It cannot be said that we have a State school system when the 
average school year is only four months. That is better than 
nothing, but it is not what you need and must have to put Ten- 
nessee in her proper place in the front ranks of the advancing
-P-A-G-E-74
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. f 75 
column of the mighty commonwealths that compose the Uni- 
ted States of America. You will not be satisfied until some- 
thing is done to insure a more equal distribution of the benefits 
of common school education. If the State is the educational 
unit in a State school system, then all the children of the State 
should be treated as nearly alike as possible. She should not 
make children of some and only step-children of others. She 
should not give university education to a few and deny the rudi- 
ments of English to the many. Let all the children have their 
bread and milk before you give pound-cake and plum-pudding 
to any. Our Tennessce school system has been much improved, 
and its administration has improved in a still more marked de- 
gree, during these last years. But it lacks something. What 
that something is may be illustrated by an incident that took 
place not long ago in Texas. Some gentlemen, traveling on 
one of the railroads, had their attention attracted to the curious 
behavior of a negro who occupied a seat in front of them, and 
who kept his body in constant motion, swaying this way and 
that without a moment’s pause. After watching him curiously 
for some time, one of the gentlemen asked him, ‘What is the 
matter with you? Why do you keep making those motions?’ 
‘T’se got to do it, was the answer. ‘You see, I give Dan 
McGarry $20 fora silver watch, and if I stop goin’ dis way it 
won’t run no mo’’—the proud owner of the peculiar time-piece 
never stopping in his oscillating motion for a second as he gave 
the desired explanation. Now, our school system is tou much 
like the Dan McGarry watch—it lacks that which will keep it 
going for a full school year in the poor and thinly-settled dis- 
tricts, as well as in the rich and populous ones. This noble old 
commonwealth has been trying to keep educational time with a 
Dan McGarry watch long enough. She ought to have a stem- 
winder, of 18-karat gold, with a fair white face, warranted to 
run as long as children shall continue to be born and switches 
grow in Tennessee. I hope, Mr. Superintendent, that your ad- 
ministration may have the high honor of this grand achiey- 
ment. 
“ But it will be asked, What is it that is lacking? As I am 
no politician, and never expect to be a candidate for any civil 
office, I will answer—more money. Does anybody ask where
-P-A-G-E-75
76 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
the money is to come from? I will just say this: That one- 
tenth of the money worse than wasted on whisky, or one-fourth 
of the money spent on the tobacco smoked and chewed up and 
spit out by our people, or what is wasted by them in keeping 
worthless and sheep-killing dogs, would give a.full year of 
common school instruction to every child in Tennessee. Where 
is the citizen who will say that it would not be better for 
us to have less whisky and tobacco, and fewer dogs, and more 
and better schooling for the children of Tennessee? More and 
better schooling, I say. The one result involves the other. 
Longer terms and better pay would surely raise the standard of 
qualification in teachers of the State. You can never obtain 
the permanent services of competent teachers for only a frag- 
ment of the year, and at meager salaries. The best men will 
seek other professions, and the best women.will marry out or 
go out some other way. 
“The best is always the cheapest, and you cannot get the — 
best in any line of service without paying for it—and you 
ought not to wish to do so. To want something for nothing, 
or for less than its real value, is dishonesty, and in this matter 
of education for our children it is also supremely unwise. I 
fecl impelled to add another remark here, namely : That the econ- 
omy which ham-strings a State Superintendent in his work of 
superintendence, by withholding the necessary means to defray 
traveling expenses, is a sort of economy that inflicts a wrong 
on the children of the State, and is out of place in the great 
State of Tennessee in the year of our Lord 1887. Economy! 
It is the economy of the farmer who starves his mules, of the 
merchant who underpays and overworks his transient employes, 
of mechanics who work with inferior tools, of churches that 
doom themselves to mediocrity in their pulpits because they 
starve their preachers. Economy indeed! That is not the 
word for it. I leave you to apply the right term to this inde- 
fensible thing. 
“TI also welcome you cordially, gentlemen, because your pres- 
ence here furnishes a fair presumption that you belong to the 
class of superintendents who do actually superintend public 
school affairs in your respective counties. You do not belong 
to the large class of unfaithful or neglectful functionaries that
-P-A-G-E-76
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. Te 
in this, our day, cause so much trouble—superintendents who 
do not superintend, directors who do not direct, overseers who 
see nothing, trustees who are not to be trusted, and bosses who | 
need to be bossed. You accept the political aphorism, recently 
coined, that a public office is a public trust—and I greet you 
on that platform, upon which I hope the honest patriots of all 
parties will stand during the entire future history of this great 
republic in which the people rule, and in which, therefore, if 
they permit things to go wrong, or stay wrong, it is their own’ 
fault. 
“T greet and welcome you as belonging to the vanguard of 
the organized educational forces that will lead Tennessee to a 
speedy victory over ignorance, prejudice, and penuriousness, 
and make her in the near future as renowned for intelligence, 
and all high intellectual and moral qualities, as her past history 
has been illustrious for the genius of her statesmen, the elo- 
qnence of her orators, the valor, of her soldiers, and the beauty 
and goodness of her women.” 
It was decided, by an almost unanimous vote, to consider all 
educators present members of the convention, and the following 
additional names were enrolled: 
Claude J. Bell, Frank Goodman, Mrs. M. E. Clark, W. T. 
Ownby, John A. Edmondson, J. H. Owney, L. L. Rogers, Dr. 
C. D. Elliott, J. E. Dorland, of Nashville; John W. Paulett, 
Knoxville; John W. Jackson, South Berlin; W. E. Bell, Su- 
perintendent McMinnville City Schools; Isaac Roose, Cincin- 
nati; H. B. Wallace, Superintendent Franklin City Schools, 
and E. C. Taylor, Crockett County. Thomas H. Paine, Super- 
intendent Jackson City Schools, and Z. H. Brown, Superin- 
tendent Nashville City Schools, were present later in the session. _ 
COMMITTEES. 
On motion of Superintendent Smith, a committee was ap- 
pointed to formulate resolutions on each of the subjects pre- 
sented for discussion. 
Following are the Chairmen of the committees: 
School Fund, State and County—White, of Chester.

County Institutes, How to Organize and Manage—Saylor, of

State Normal College—President Payne, Normal School. 
Mode of Examining Teachers, and their Necessary Qualifi- 
eations—Fuqua, of Davidson. 
PERMANENT ORGANIZATION. 
Superintendent Allen, of Bedford, oftered the following, which 
was adopted : 
“ Wueruas, The united co-operation of the County Superin- 
tendents with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
is necessary to the improvement and more effective application 
of the Public School System of the State; therefore, be it 
“ Resolved, That the County Superintendents of the State 
enter into a permanent organization, and that a committee of 
three be appointed to report to this convention a plan for such | 
permanent organization.” 
The following committee was appointed: 
Allen, of Bedford; Haynes, of Sumner; and Goodman, of 
Nashville. 
President Payne, of the State Normal College, was called for 
and said a few words, expressing his desire for co-operation in 
building up a successful Normal College. 
The convention then took a recess until 2 o’clock P. M. 
AFTERNOON SESSION. 
Chairman Douglass called the convention to order at 2:05 
o clock in the afternoon. Only a small number of the members 
were present, but the committees were at work, which accounted 
for the absence of so many. 
On motion of Mr. Stovall, of Obion, a recess was then taken — 
until 2:30 o’elock.
-P-A-G-E-78
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 79 
At the close of the recess Chairman Douglass presented each 
Superintendent present with a steel engraving of Gov. Taylor, 
and one of State Superintendent Smith. 
Mr. Saylor, of Knox, from the Committee on County Insti- 
tutes, read a report which brought out considerable discussion. 
It was taken up item by item. The first clause proposed that 
each teacher should pay to the Superintendent a fee of $1 for 
the issuing of his certificate, and that the fee shall go to the 
support of an Annual Teachers’ Institute. 
This was opposed by several gentlemen. 
Pending discussion, Mr. Allen, of Bedford, offered the follow- 
ing resolution, which was unanimously adopted: 
“ Resolved, That the author of a motion or resolution be 
allowed ten minutes for an opening speech, and five minutes 
for rejoinder, and that other speakers to the question be limited 
to one speech of five minutes.” 
The discussion was resumed, and several speeches were made. 
One point brought out was that there is no statute authorizing 
a County Superintendent to collect a fee for issuing a certificate. 
Mr. Allen, of Bedford County, opposed the plan, “ because,” 
said he, “I favor all teachers’ organizations standing on an 
independent basis. I oppose the support of a County Institute 
by the public school funds.” 
After considerable discussion, taken part in by several gentle- 
men, Mr. Nelson, of Rutherford, called for the question, and 
moved that the vote on the first clause of the report be taken 
by counties, but the motion was lost. 
On motion of Mr. Allen, of Bedford, it was declared that all 
votes be taken standing. 
The first clause of the report was voted down, and the entire 
report then re-referred to the committee. 
Mr. White, of Chester, from the Committee on the State and 
County School Fund, presented a report, which was being dis- 
cussed when the hour for adjournment arrived. 
This committee recommended the collection and distribution 
of all school moneys by the State Comptroller. This elicited. 
the warmest discussion of the day. Mr. White filled his ten

minutes with strong arguments for the uniting of the State and 
County School Funds. 
Messrs. Davis, of Weakley; Wright, of Gibson; and Fuqua, 
of Davidson, spoke in opposition to the resolution, and Mr. 
Thorne, of Henderson, closed with an appeal for the resolution 
as it stood. 
The convention adjourned until 9 o’clock Wednesday morn- 
ing. 
SECOND DAY—MORNING SESSION. 
The convention ‘was called to order Wednesday morning at 
9 o'clock by Chairman Douglass. Only about one-half the 
Superintendents were present, but the discussion of the report 
on School Fund was resumed. 
The first clause of the report, recommending a general dis- 
tribution of all school funds by the State Comptroller, was fur- 
ther discussed by Messrs. Nelson, of Rutherford; Allen, of 
Bedford; and Wright, of Gibson, all opposing the adoption of 
the report. 
When the vote was taken the first resolution was rejected, 
but the second, which read as follows, was adopted : 
“Resolved, That the Trustees of the counties be required to 
make monthly reports to County Superintendents of their dis- 
bursements, and cash on hand, and due each district in the 
county; and that the revenue officers of the State and counties 
be required to make similar accounts and settlements to the 
Trustees on the first Monday in January, April, June, and Oc- 
tober, and that quarterly distributions be made to the districts 
of all undistributed funds by the officers whose duty it shall be 
to make the same.” 
Governor Taylor was here introduced by Chairman Douglass, 
and delivered the following address : a 
“Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention : 
“T congratulate the State of Tennessee upon this happy 
meeting of our County Superintendents, whose object is the

elevation of the standard of education within our borders. 
You are engaged in superintending a work which must bring 
great results—results which will determine our character and 
destiny as a people. 
“Gentlemen of the convention, are you aware that Tennes- 
see occupies the first place among all the Southern States in 
reference to graded schools, high schools, colleges, and univer- 
sities? There are the town and city graded schools of Jack- 
son, Humboldt, Union City, Pulaski, Columbia, Trenton, Gal- 
latin, Tullahoma, Clarksville, Shelbyville, Memphis, Nashville, 
Chattanooga, Cleveland, Knoxville, Morristown, Greeneville, 
Jonesboro. Almost every county in the State has its academy 
or college. There is the Sullins Female College at Bristol, Mil- 
ligan College in Carter County, Tusculum College in Greene, 
Washington College in Washington County, Rogersville Fe- 
male College at Rogersville, King Ccllege, Carson College at 
Mossy Creek, Female College at Sweetwater, Centenary Female 
College at Cleveland, the Mary Sharp College at Winchester, 
Female College at Murfreesboro, Female College at McMinn- 
ville, Hiawassee College in Monroe, Clara Conway High School 
and Higbee Iligh School in Memphis, Webb High School at 
Bell Beckie. Female College at Franklin, Martin College at 
Pulaski, Ward’s Seminary at Nashville, Nashville College for 
Young Ladies at Nashville, the Female Institute at Jackson, 
Howard Female College at Gallatin, the Atheneum and Female — 
Institute at Columbia, and other female institutions which I do 
“not now recall. : 
“All of these institutions are in a highly prosperous and 
flourishing condition. And then we have the Southwestern 
Baptist University at Jackson, the Southwestern Presbyterian 
University at Clarksville, Cumberland University at Lebanon, 
Vanderbilt University at Nashville, Goodman’s Business College 
at Nashville, the University of the South at Sewanee, with its 
_ three hundred students, the University at Chattanooga, the 
Grant Memorial University at Athens, and the University of 
Tennessee at Knoxville. his last named University no longer 
languishes, but under the revivifying touch of its gifted young 
President it has sprung as by magic into full prosperity. And

-P-A-G-E-81
82 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
State is our great Normal College at Nashville, which is an 
nually turning out scores of young men and women thoroughly 
trained and educated in the profession of teaching. We have 
the Fisk University, the Roger Williams University, the Cen- 
tral Tennessee College at Nashville, the Knoxville College, the 
Lemoyne Normal Institute of Memphis, all for the education 
of our colored youth. We have medical colleges at Nashville 
unsurpassed in the United States. Our great Law College at 
Lebanon holds a distinguished place amoug the law colleges of 
the world.. But with all the great institutions which are the 
glory of the State, there is yet a sad deficiency in our educational 
' system. We must have a more extended system of public free 
- schools. There are thousands of children in the State who, by 
reason of poverty, are hopelessly debarred from the advantages 
attorded by the town and city schools and colleges. It is most 
especially for these that I entertain the greatest solicitude. 
“ We are astonished and humiliated when we hear the state- 
ment from the lips of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, that there are now two thousand miser- 
able old log school-houses in the State of Tennessee. I desire 
to see them forever abolished and demolished, and replaced with 
beautiful and comfortable modern buildings, supplied with 
trained and efficient teachers. For this I have labored and 
hoped, and for this I will never cease to work until it is ac- 
complished. There are some of you present who are doubtless 
trembling for fear that I will mention the ‘ Blair Bill’ in con- 
nection with the free schools.. Let me at once remove your 
quaking fears by declaring here and now that I am not, and 
never was, in favor of that terrible Blair Bill. But I said in my 
message to the Legislature, and I repeat it now, that if, after 
the general Government shall have discharged all its current 
obligations and met every demand; if, after this, there still re- 
mains a surplus of money in the treasury not applicable to the 
national debt, because not yet due, then, I said, the appropria- 
tion of such surplus for educational purposes, stripped and freed 
from every possible condition of Federal supervision or control, 
would be an inestimable blessing to the children of the State. 
T said, in substance, and say now, that such a surplus, under 
such circumstances, and unburdened with conditions prejudicial Af etapa
-P-A-G-E-82
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 83 
to the local government of the States, could not flow back to 
the people (to whom it belongs) through a better channel than 
the school-room. I want to be understood. We do not want 
Federal aid to education unless it is appropriated to the State 
of Tennessee, to be used under her own laws, without any 
Federal control whatever. We want it as we received it fifty 
years ago, when ‘Old Hickory’ Jackson was President of the 
United States. I emphasize these remarks on this question 
because I have been so grievously misunderstood. 
“Jn conclusion, gentlemen of the convention, permit me to 
say that my only motive in all that I have said and done has 
been to promote the happiness of the people and the prosperity 
of the State. “ 
‘‘T declare to you that there is a glorious future for Tennessee. 
Her financial condition to-day is better than it has been for thirty 
years. Tennessee banks are sustaining the credit of Tennessee. 
Within the short period of eighteen months to come we will be 
‘able to meet promptly our semi-annual payments of the interest 
on our State debt, and will be accumulating a surplus for the 
liquidation of the debt itself; and we will therefore begin to be

“T thank you for your kind attention, and trust that your 
meeting will be not only pleasant, but profitable.” 
The speech was heartily cheered, and Mr. Goodman, of Da- 
vidson, offered the following, which was unanimously adopted : 
“ Resolved, That this convention heartily appreciate the efforts 
of our worthy Governor, Hon. Robert L. Taylor, in behalf of 
the educational interests of the State.” 
Superintendent Thomas H. Paine, of the Jackson city schools, 
was called to the chair. 
Mr. Saylor, of Knox, from the Committee on County Insti- 
tutes, offered the following report, which was adopted : 
“Your undersigned Committee on County Institutes begs 
leave to submit the following report : °

“Recognizing the importance of a thorough organization, 
and the benefits derived from meeting and discussing the best 
methods of conducting classes in the various branches taught 
in our public schools, and for discussing other questions per- 
taining to the general interest of schools, we recommend: 
“ First—Two county normal institutes, one for the white and 
one for the colored teachers, be organized and conducted by the 
County Superintendent, at some convenient place in the county, 
- from one to three weeks between the middle of June and the 
first of August. 
“ Second—That the Superintendent appoint a corps of ex- 
perienced and efficient téachers to assist him, communicate with 
him, make a programme of the proposed work, and publish the 
same; also to urge the importance of every teacher in the 
county attending and taking part in the institute. 
“ Third—A president, vice-president, secretary, and a com- 
mittee on arrangements shall constitute the executive members 
of the institute, and such questions shall be discussed as will be 
in keeping with the advancement of education. ‘ 
“Fourth—We furthermore recommend that teachers’ institutes 
shall be held by the County Superintendents from time to time 
while the schools are in operation, these meetings to hold from 
one to two days.

“We, your Committee on Permanent Organization, respect- 
fully recommend the following: 
“ Hirst—That the name of this organization shall be known 
as the Tennessee Public School Officers’ Association. 
* Second—All school officers working under the publi¢ school 
laws of the State may become members by reporting their names 
to the Secretary at the opening of each annual meeting. Teach- 
ers of public and private schools may become members by a 
majority vote of the association. :

officers to be combined in one. There shall be an executive 
committee of five, whose duty it shall be to nominate officers, 
subject to the ratification or rejection of the association, and to 
transact such other business as may be required. 
“ Fourth—The election of these officers to be by ballot, at the 
close of each annual session. That the president appoint an 
executive committee to report the nominations of officers for 
the coming year. That the annual meeting shall be held in the 
city of Nashville on the second Tuesday in December.

pointed to draft suitable by-laws and regulations, and report at 
our next annual meeting.

Mr. Billingsly, of White, offered the following as a sugges- 
tion to the next Legislature: 
“Tn case of any vacancy in the office of District School Di-

of the term, in case the Directors do not appoint within fifteen 
days.” 
READING CIRCLE. 
The following report from the Committee on the Teachers’ 
Reading Circle was adopted : 
“Resolved, That the Reading Circle is a fit sequence of our 
sunimer institutes, and, as an educating factor in the teacher's 
professional training, should be second only to the Normal Col- 
lege and Teachers’ Institutes. 
“Resolved, That the County Superintendents present should 
pledge themselves to further the Reading Circle by organizing 
their teachers into one as soon as practicable, thus impressing . 
upon them the importance of professional work, and thus ele- 
vating and improving our teachers and our school system. 
“Resolved, That we heartily indorse the work of the Board 
of Directors of the Tennessee Teachers’ Reading Circle. Their 
plan of organization is simple, their courses of reading for 
1885-6 and 1886-7 are most excellent; and we urge upon them 
the necessity of selecting at once a course of reading for the 
ensuing year, and publishing it, together with their full circular 
of information, in the proceedings of this convention. 
“Resolved, That teachers should read more scholastic litera- 
ture, school journals, etc., than they are now reading, and we

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
The following report was offered by Mr. Thomas: 
“To the Chairman and Members of the Convention: 
“Your Committee on Questions Concerning the University of 
Tennessee and State Agricultural and Mechanical College re- 
ports as follows: 
“ We believe that this institution can be made, by the hearty 
co-operation of the proper officials and of the people, a power 
for great good to the State—a good which can be accomplished 
in no other way. 
“Granting that in the past the University has not accom- 
plished the intent of the law, the institution is founded on 
sound principles, that must in the end predominate. 
“In the election of Dr. C. W. Dabney, Jr., as presieeas a 
new move has been made in the right direction. The position 
he has taken, and the beginning he has made, lead us to believe 
that he will carry out the meaning and intent of the law, and 
make the institution eminently successful and useful. 
“Tf the 475 students contemplated by the law would annually 
avail themselves of the agricultural and mechanical courses of 
the University of Tennessee, we are’ confident the net income 
of the agricultural interests of the State would certainly in a 
few years be vastly increased, as the direct result of such edu- 
cation. a 
“ Aside from the great advantages of higher education as or- _— 
dinarily understood, the result would be widely and unmistak-_ 
- ably felt in their influences upon the publie schools of the 
State. 
“Teachers must be educated in subjects as well as methods. 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
83 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
We fear that while much is being done to educate teachers in 
methods, we do not require in them a proper knowledge of meth- 
ods. No person can be a good public school teacher who has 
nota broad, substantial education. 
“The relation of the college and the university is one of 
paramount importance. No country can have first-class public 
schools which does not first possess the institutions of higher 
education. 
“Tn order that this University shall have the proper support, 
that it may accomplish the objects intended by its founders, we, 
the Convention of County and City Superintendents: of the 
State, adopt the following preamble and resolutions : 
«“ WuerEas, The University of Tennessce and State Agricul- 
tural and Mechanical College is an institution primarily in- 
tended for the industrial education of the sons of the citizens 
of the State; and, 
“ Wuernas, This University offers abundant opportunity for 
the comprehensive and proper training, both practically and 
theoretically, of farmers, mechanics, civil and mechanical en- 
gineers, practical teachers, etc., at free rates of tuition, ° 
“ Resolved, That we, the County and City Superintendents 
of the State, will not only make ourselves familiar with the 
law as regards our duty to the University, and with the facts of 
interest and advantages offered by the institution, but that we 
pledge ourselves to examine and appoint applicants as the law 
requires; to advertise the University in our School Institutes 
and Teachers’ Associations, and use every effort to secure the 
full quota of appointments from our respective counties and 
cities. Respectfully submitted, 
“ Price THomas, 
“J, A! Smrser, 
We LEIGH 
The report was adopted, and, in response to a request, Dr. 
Dabney spoke as follows about the recent progress at the Uni- 
versity : 
«There has been a great revival of interest in this University, 
vas is shown by the large number of: new students who have
-P-A-G-E-88
  TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. BOs 
joined the lower classes this year. There are eighty-eight new 
men in attendance already, and the second term will add sixty 
or seventy-five more. The total enrollment is fifty per cent. 
larger than for a number of years past. 
“ There is thus a splendid foundation here already on which 
to build the future classes. If they continue to increase at this 
rate during the next three years, there will be 400 present in 
the autumn of 1890. Even better things than this can well be 
hoped for. 
“ Only forty-one counties out of the ninety-six in Tennessee 
are now represented. Every county could, and should, have at 
least five students at our University. 
“ Seventeen counties in East Tennessee are represented by 
seventy-four cadets; sixteen in Middle Tennessee have thirty- 
seven; and eight counties in West Tennessee have sixteen at 
the present time. The States represented are: Tennessee, Mis- 
sissippi, North Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and Vir- 
ginia, and China (a son of a missionary). 
« The institution has now thirteen professors and instructors. 
It. is being developed along the line of technical education. 
The leading courses now are those in the general sciences, prac- 
tical chemistry, scientific agriculture, and mechanical and civil 
engineering. Asan index of the interest taken in these lines of 
study in the State, it may be stated that there are forty-two men 
in the technical engineering department, eighteen in the agri- 
cultural, twenty-six in practical chemistry, twenty-six in the 
civil engineering course, and eighteen pursuing the general sci- 
ence course. 
“The buildings have been thoroughly repaired, and the reci- 
tation rooms, lecture rooms, etc., have been neatly furnished 
and equipped. All the public rooms have been put in good or- 
der. The library has been completely overhauled and re-ar- 
ranged, and a splendid readjng-room has been provided with 
all the leading State papers, literary magazines, reviews, and 
a goodly number of art, illustrated, and general papers. This 
is open during afternoons and Saturdays, when the classes are 
not going on, and has become already an attractive feature at 
the University. A course of popular lectures on literary, sci-
-P-A-G-E-89
90 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
entific, and industrial questions by distinguished men from the — 
various professions, has been commenced. 
“ A neat, home-like infirmary, with free medical attention, 
medicine, and nursing, has been provided for those who may 
need it. But there has been no illness of any consequence 
whatever at the University during this session. 
“The University is beautifully and healthfully located, and 
for picturesqueness of situation and purity of air it cannot be 
surpassed anywhere in the country. The buildings of the Uni- 
versity are situated upon a high eminence in the immediate 
vicinity of Knoxville, overlooking the valley. From the top. 
of the University buildings the eye of the visitor can, on a 
clear day, span the whole of the beautiful valley from the Cum- 
berland to the Smoky Mountains. 
“The organization is according to the military plan; students 
live in barracks by companies, and all of the discipline is based 
upon the West Point system. The rules are strict, but reason- 
able. Daily drill affords fine exercise and trains the boys to — 
manly carriage and conduct. Practical manual work is required 
of all, either on the farm, in the mechanical department, chem- 
ical laboratory, drawing departments, the plant house, the 
horticultural department, or somewhere else, according to the- 
stage of advancement and the courses taken by the student. 
“The students have organized a Young Men’s Christiam As- 
sociation, and have arranged a ueat hall, which is very com- 
fortable and attractive, and has its organ and hymn-books for 
religious service, and a large collection of religious and general 
newspapers, which are accessible to all. This organization is 
exerting a very fine influence at the University. There are 
good accommodations at and about the University for 500 stu- 
dents. Applicants for admission should be fifteen years of age, 
and have a good knowledge of arithmetic, elementary algebra, 
English, geography, and United. States history. They must 
produce evidence of a good character. It is expected that the 
standard of admission will be raised somewhat before the be- 
ginning of next session. 
“State Senators and Representatives can appoint young men 
who are qualified to cadetship, and all County Superintendents 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 91 
are required by law to recommend such young persons as apply 
to them and are found to be properly qualified. (Those requir- 
ing detailed information on this subject can address the Presi- 
dent.) Such appointments will secure free tuition at the Uni- 
versity, and then the total expenses for the ten months need 
not exceed $175, or $125 from January Ist to the end of the 
session in June. 
“The working feature is the distinetive one about the Uni- 
versity. Labor is dignified. All students are required to take 
physical training and do manual work. This is limited to just 
what is necessary for their becoming prepared for such work, 
and a good, sufficient amount of exercise. There is an hour’s 
drill four times a week, and exercises in declamation, reading, : 
or speaking once a week, and an average of six or eight hours of 
manual work for each student every week. Many of the stu- 
dents do paid work in addition to this, whereby they reduce 
their expenses considerably. Quite a number of young men at 
the University pay all their expenses by the work they can do 
during the session, and work throughout the vacation. Atleast 
one-half of our students earn something to help them in this 
way. The amounts they earn run from a dollar or two to $12 
- or $15 per month. To show what can be done, we will recite 
the case of one young man: During the month of November 
this young man made $11.52 by farm work, in addition to attend- 
ing college from 8 o’clock in the morning till 4 in the afternoon, 
and kept up with all of his classes besides. This was done by ac- 
tual hard work, and without any favoritism at all. He paid $8 out 
of this for his board, and had $3.52 left for other expenses and 
pocket money. Other students make as much, but we mention 
this because it was done by hard work. Another illustration is 
still more to the point: Two young men, the sons of a delicate 
farmer, within ten miles of Knoxville, find it necessary to econ- 
omize and work all that it is possible. The whole expenses, 
from September 1st to December 25th, will have been: Board- 
ing themselves for four months, at $4, $16; uniform, cap, etc., 
$25; coal, lights, and so on, $3; University fees, $12.50; mak- 
ing a total for one of $56.50, or the total expenses of the two, 
$113; of this they earned by farm and janitor’s work $42, without 
__ having specially good opportunity to do so either, so that their

father has only had to pay out $35.50 foreach one of them. Their 
food, ready prepared, in part was sent them from home every 
Saturday, and their washing was done at home. The cost of 
the food supplied is estimated at market rates, and included in 
the above. These boys.sent $18 home toward paying for these 
things. If these boys continue to do as well as this they will 
not cost their father over $50 a year each while at the Univer- 
sity. The students do janitor’s wark, ring the bell, carry the 
mail, and assist at the steward’s hall, etc. At least forty or fifty. 
young men do this, and aid themselves very materially in this 
way. No young man earnestly seeking an opportunity of get- 
ting an education, and who is prepared, willing, and able to 
' work, has ever been turned away from this institution. 
“Are there not many other young men—several hundred, at 
least—in Tennessee who are this very moment longing for the 
opportunity to secure just such an education, and who would 
be able to do so on these easy terms? It is made your duty, 
Superintendents, to take them the glad news that the generous 
State has provided these things for them, and then to aid them 
in getting them. See the law on the subject and do your duty, 
and you will be the instruments of conferring a great blessing 
upon the young.” 
Superintendent Smith, who had been confined to his room 
most of the day on account of sickness, came into the conven- 
tion by request, and made some suggestions concerning the 
issuing of certificates to teachers. 
A running discussion on this subject brought out many in- 
teresting points. 
THE NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Mr. Ruffin, from the Committee on the State Normal Col- 
lege, offered the following report: 
“ First—We earnestly recommend that the County Superin- 
tendents of the State call attention of young men and women 
who are intending to teach to the advantages offered by the 
State Normal College, and so extend the privileges of this insti- | 
tution to the entire State. Judging by the patronage given to
-P-A-G-E-92
‘ 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 93 
normal schools in other States, the attendance at the Normal 
College from Tennessee ought to exceed three hundred. 
“ Second—We fear that the impression prevails throughout 
the State that none except those who have secured Peabody 
scholarships will be admitted to the college. The probability is 
that three-fourths of those who compete for these scholarships 
are qualified to enter the school, and we recommend that the 
County Superintendents urge those who fail in securing schol- 
arships to apply for admission.” 
In explanation of the report made by the Committee on the 
State Normal College, the Chairman, President Payne, spoke 
as follows: 
“T desire to have the people of Tennessee feel that the State 
Normal College is their own Normal School, open to their sons 
and daughters, and deserving their patronage and support. 
While this institution is designed by its founders to serve the 
entire South as a college for the higher education and training 
of teachers, it is also endowed by the State of Tennessee for 
the training of her own teachers. I fear that the impression 
prevails throughout the State that only a select few—only those 
who secure Peabody scholarships—will be admitted to the col- 
lege. This is an error, and I shall think it a great favor if the 
County Superintendents will cause it to be known that young 
men and women who have the equivalent of a high-school edu- 
cation will be admitted to the middle class of the college, and 
that those who have the equivalent of a grammar-school course, 
who have a fair knowledge of grammar, arithmetic, geography, 
United States history, and physiology, will be admitted to our 
junior, or preparatory, class. 
“Tereafter [ shall ask the privilege of reading the better 
papers of those who compete for the Peabody scholarships, and 
to all whom I find competent for entering our junior or middle 
classes, I shall issue certificates of admission without further exam- 
ination. 
“JT wish to commend to the County Superintendents of Ten- 
nessee an example which has recently been set by Florida, where 
the school authorities of one county have raised a sum sufficient
-P-A-G-E-93
94 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
to support a student for oue year in the Normal College. Are 
there many counties in Tennessee where the same thing might 
not be done? I am glad to know that some of our County 
Superintendents are already thinking of this. With even one 
well-trained and enthusiastic teacher in each county the whole 
state of public instruction might be appreciably raised. 
“Tuition in the Normal College is free to all students. The only 
college charge-is an incidental fee of $6 a year, and the cost of 
actual breakage by students in the chemical laboratory. All 
students have the free use of all text-books used in the college. 
At present the cost of board, room, lights, fuel, and washing 
does not exceed $200 a year; and I hope to perfect arrange- 
ments whereby this expense can be reduced to $125 a year.” 
The report of the committee was then unanimously adopted. 
Mr. Bell offered a series of resolutions on the adoption of a 
uniform system of text-books, but the resolutions were tabled. 
Mr. Thorne, of Henderson, offered the following, which was 
adopted: , 
« Resolved, That the sense of this convention is decidedly in 
favor of continuing the allowance heretofore made to the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction for defraying traveling 
expenses.” 
The Committee on Resolutions, Mr. Ballou, Chairman, pre- 
sented a report tendering thanks to Dr. Fitzgerald for his ad- 
dress of welcome; to Gov. Taylor for his hearty expressions of 
support; to Supt. Z. H. Brown for his common-sense speech 
and invitation to visit the city schools; to President Payne, of 
the State Normal College; to President Dabney, of the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee; to Chairman Douglass and Secretary Ray ; 
to the railroads for their courtesy, and to the Nashville Banner 
and American for reports. The report recommends to favorable 
notice the Southwestern Journal of Education and Good Educa- 
tion, Nashville, and Southern Teacher, Chattanooga. It con- 
tained the following: 
« Resolved, That we feel that Supt. Frank M. Smith, in eall- 
ing this convention of superintendents, and in bringing before 
 
-P-A-G-E-94

it for its consideration questions of practical and pressing im- 
portance, has advanced the cause of education in our State, and 
has set in motion influences which will result in permanent 
good to the school interests.” 
The Committee on Permanent Organization, consisting of J. 
H. Allen, Shelbyville; W. A. Haynes, Gallatin; and Frank 
Goodman, Nashville, was instructed to prepare a constitution 
and by-laws. 
The officers elected for the ensuing year were :

adopted : 
“ Resolved, That at the next meeting of this body we continue 
in session for three days, and ask reduced rates on all railroads 
in the State, with tickets good to return any time within ten 
days.”

CIRCULAR LETTER TO THE COUNTY COURTS 
OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE. 
Feeling that the attention of the County Courts of the State 
should be called to the important part they should perform of 
our complex school system, I issued, on the 15th day of Decem- 
ber, a circular letter, and sent a sufficient number to each county 
to supply the Magistrates thereof.
-P-A-G-E-95
96 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
This letter was read in nearly every county by the Clerks of 
the various counties while the Court was in session, and I am 
glad to be able to report that good has resulted therefrom. 
In many counties in the State the District Directors have 
divided the school-districts, and in some instances more than 
two hundred school districts have been formed where there 
should not have been more than twenty. 
The District Directors were empowered to subdivide their dis- 
tricts, and from this new school districts were formed. 
The County Court is the only body in the county that can 
form a new school-district. 
There are many reasons why the civil district and the school- 
district should be identical. 
The county elections being held on the first Thursday in 
August in each civil district, there is no trouble in the election 
of District Directors, for the election is at the same time. 
Again, better supervision can be had by having three men to 
supervise the entire district, and graded schools can be estab- 
lished—that is, schools can be established where 200 or 300 
children can be assigned to one house, and several teachers em- 
ployed in the same school-bitilding, which will insure better 
work in every respect. 
When the District Directors fully understand the importance 
of graded schools, and begin the establishment of the same, we 
will make a grand advancement in school work. 
One serious drawback to the efliciency of our schools is the 
establishing of too many schools in a district. We should 
have fewer schools, more children to a house, and longer school 
terms. 
A copy of the circular to the County Courts is herewith sub- 
mitted, viz.: 
 
-P-A-G-E-96

CIRCULAR LETTER TO THE COUNTY COURTS OF THE | 
STATE OF TENNESSEE. 
DepARTMENT oF Pusuic INsrRuction, 
Nasuvitir, Tuny., December 15th, 1887. 
To your Honorable Boies, the County Courts of Tennessee : 
I desire to call your attention officially to your important re- 
Jations to the public school system of the State: 
1. It is your duty to elect a County Superintendent of Public 
Instruction. 
2. To levy a school tax. 
3. To lay off the county into suitable school-districts. 
4. To audit the accounts of all county officials who handle 
any part of the school funds. 
In the election of the County Superintendent, who is the 
most important officer connected with the public school system, 
it is your duty, under the law, to choose a man “ of literary and 
scientific attainments; and, when practicable, of skill and ex- 
perience in the art of teaching.” 
Great care should be exercised to secure such a person, and 
he should receive a liberal salary for his services. If you de- 
sire that the public schools of your respective counties shall be 
efficient in every respect, such an end can be attained only by 
efficient supervision. 
A convention of County Superintendents has just been held 
in Nashville, which, in its deliberations, considered many points 
of vital importance to the public school system. A copy. of its 
proceedings will be sent to any Magistrate in the State who may 
request thesame. A permanent organization of County Super- 
intendents was effected, and its annual meeting fixed to be held 
at Nashville on the second Tuesday of December. I consider 
‘this the most important step ever taken by any body of educa- 
tors in the State. In order that your respective counties may 
receive the full benefits resulting from the deliberations of this 
convention, it will be necessary for your County Superintend- 
ents to attend its annual meetings. To this end I therefore 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
98 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
urge you to allow their traveling expenses as a part of their 
salary. It is of incalculable importance that the public schools 
in your respective counties shall cover at least the full time 
prescribed by Section 39, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873, en- 
  titled, “An Act to Establish aad Maintain a Uniform System ~ 
of Public Schools,” viz ; 
“That when the money derived from the school fund, and 
taxes imposed by the State on the counties, shall not be 
sufficient to keep up the public schools for five months in the 
year, in the school-districts of the county, the County Court 
shall levy an additional tax sufficient for this RoaGee, or shall 
submit the proposition to a vote of the people.” 
I am at a loss for words adequate in their strength to impress 
upon you the inestimable importance of your strict compliance 
with the section of the law above quoted. It is the intention 
of the law that the civil district and the school-district shall be — 
identical; but in a few exceptiongl cases it may be necessary to 
form school-districts without regard to civil district lines. But 
this change of district lines must be made by a commission ap- 
pointed by the County Court for that purpose. My attention 
has been called to the fact that in a few instances District ~ 
Directors have formed new school-districts—a duty which be- 
longs to the County Courts, and not to them. It, therefore, 
becomes your duty to either ratify this action of the Directors, 
or to annul the same, and establish such districts according to 
the requirements of the law. 
This error on the part of the Directors originated in a mis- 
apprehension of the meaning of the law. The law says that 
“ District Directors are hereby authorized to subdivide school- 
districts.” 
This simply means that the District Directors shall have™ 
authority to say what children shall attend House No. 1, what 
children shall attend House No. 2, House No. 3, and so on, of 
their respective districts. 
Now, in this connection, I wish to call your especial attention 
to the fact that in all counties where the schools have reached 
the highest standard of efficiency, the school-district and the ~ 
civil district are identical. I would, therefore, earnestly recom-
-P-A-G-E-98
  TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 99 
mend to your honorable bodies that you cause the school-dis- 
tricts to conform as far as possible with the civil districts. 
I wish to urge upon the Chairmen of the respective County 
Courts the importance of requiring the Trustees to make the 
proper financial reports to the County Superintendents and the 
District Directors of the school-districts. To this end I call 
your attention to Section 43, Chapter 25, of the Acts of 1873, 
to wit: “That the County Trustee shall keep separate accounts 
of the State funds and County funds, showing whence, and on 
what account, the moneys were severally derived, and by what 
order, on what account, and to whom they were distributed ; 
and as soon as said moneys are received, he shall report.the sana to, 
the County Superintendent, and to the District Direetius of! nny 
school-district.”’ 
In addition to this, the County Trustee is ceed to joes Me 
an annual report to the County Superintendent, tf) or before 
the 15th day of September, of the amount of money received 
by him for school purposes, and the disbursements of the Bat, 
(See Section 1, Chapter 129, of the Acts of 1879.) 1 A 
In the following counties the County Trustees have failed to”, 
make to the County Superintendents such annual report, for, the 
year ending September 15th, 1887, viz.: Anderson, Claiborne, 
Cocke, Hawkins, Jackson, Wieigs, Maes: Perry, and Van Buren. 
A blank for such report is herewith forwarded to the Chair- 
man of the County Court of each of the above named counties, 
with the request that said Chairman will see that the report is 
made and forwarded at once to this office. 
I earnestly request that the Chairmen of the County Courts 
of the State shall read this circular, or cause it to be read, to 
their respective courts at their January term, 1888. 
Very respectfully, Frank M. Smrru, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
FINANCIAL. 
’ Special attention is hereby called to Exhibit “A,” which gives, 
in tabulated form, the receipts and disbursements of the school 
fund by the various County Trustees from 1879 to 1885, inclu- 
sive.

  100 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
This report will show a very loose and imperfect system of 
book-keeping on the part of many Trustees. Some have abso- 
lutely refused to report to this office, and have wholly ignored 
every request made by me. 
The first column shows the amount the Trustee had on hand 
when the report was made the year before. The second column 
is the same amount, or should be the same amount, for he 
should begin with the amount on hand at last report. The third 
shows deficits, the fourth the excess. 
A Mueh time and labor have been given this subject by me in 
i onder ‘to/asvertain why such irr egular reports have been made, 
>and to secure réports from all the Trustees. 
I have made it my special work to investigate the expendi- 
ture of the school fund, and I do not hesitate to say, from the 
examination I have given the subject, that a thorough investi- 
i OP of the expenditure of the school fund should be had. 
IN CONCLUSION 
I will state a few things necessary to make our schools more 
efficient. 
First—The County Superintendent should be paid a salary 
sufficient to enable him to have head-quarters in the saddle dur- 
ing the entire year. No man who is halt, lame, or blind should 
be selected for that place, but the best man in the county should 
be chosen. 
Second—A more liberal appropriation should be made by the 
County Courts for school purposes, thus giving longer school 
terms and more efficient work. No man can afford to thoroughly 
prepare himself for the profession of teaching unless he has a — 
guarantee of employment for at least eight months of each 
year.

CHATTANOOGA CITY SCHOOLS. 
Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superintendent of Public pa 
Nashville, Tenn. : 
Dear Str—I have the honor to present herewith a summary 
of statistics of the Chattanooga public schools for the year 
ending June 30th, 1887: 
Our Schoo! Board consists of twelve members, and the schools 
are divided into Primary, Grammar, and High School Depart- 
ments. Sixteen graduated May 20th from the Chattanooga 
High School, and there was also one graduate from the Colored 
High School Department. 
In the statistics the pupils of the Colored High School are 
classed with the Gilmer Street School. 
Our schools are prosperous and popular. Another building 
for the colored pupils will be erected during the school year of 
1887-’88, the lot having been already purchased.

Crass Hymn. 
(Selected.) 
This day is one of mingled joy and pain, 
One that shall never from our memories die; 
Our band unbroken shall not meet again 
While months shall vanish and long years go by. 
CHORUS. 
We come to-day, we come to-day to sing our parting song; 
To say farewell, farewell to friends and teachers true, 
Our hands once more to clasp in friendship strong, 
Ere we go forth our chosen work to do. , 
Fondly we have looked for this, the crowning hour ; 
Gladly we greet it, though it brings us pain; 
Oft in the future dim shall memory’s power 
Recall it to our longing hearts again. 
CHORUS. 
We come, ete. 
Father in Heaven, be with our teachers here; 
Long may their noble labors bless the land, 
While we to distant fields a gem shall béar, 
To grow and ripen into harvests grand.

We come, ete.

The foregoing tables show the general condition of our 
schools, and I am glad to add that since their organization they 
have continually grown in popularity. They receive the gen- 
eral indorsement of the people, and are patronized by all classes 
of citizens. One leading reason of their great success lies 
in the fact that our Board of Education is composed of first- 
class business men, who are fully alive to the interest of the 
city and wide awake on educational matters. They employ 
none but good teachers, and as a result of their action in this 
respect we have a corps of teachers that will compare favorably 
with any in the State. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
Tuomas H. Parng, 
Superintendent.

The enrollment of the past year is 147 more than that of last 
year. The scholastic population—6,239—is an increase of 602 
over last year. 
The record of attendance is somewhat below that of last 
year, owing to the prevalence for some time of measles, menin- 
gitis, etc. In some cases the attendance, owing to these causes, 
was reduced nearly 50 per cent. 
In point of discipline the schools have shown a marked im- 
provement. There is a growing desire among teachers to gov- 
ern without resorting to corporal punishment. 
There were constantly employed during the year fifty-five 
teachers, of whom forty-nine were in charge of rooms, and six 
were assistants. 
Examinations are held every ten weeks, the last one being an 
examination on the entire work of the year. The per cent. of 
promotions was 81.93, the largest percentage promoted for nine 
years. 
The High School enrolled 119, and graduated fifteen. The 
cost of the same was $2,150, or $18.07 per pupil enrolled. The 
course of study was somewhat modified to suit the work of the 
"year. 
At the graduating exercises two prizes were presented—one 
to Miss Ethel M. Lyms for the best original composition, and 
one to Walter Carter for the best herbarium of wild flowers.

  KNOXVILLE NEW HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING. 
By the construction of the new High School Building the ac- 
commodations have been somewhat increased, and very mate- 
rially improved. This building was erected at a cost of $40-, 
000; is heated and ventilated by the Ruttau-Smead system. 
During the year Dr. Luther W. Mason spent a week visiting 
the schools and giving instruction in music. His work has — 
been productive of good results. ‘ 
An attempt was made during the year to re-organize an 
~ Alumni Association, in order to secure the interest of graduates
-P-A-G-E-143
CITY SCHOOLS. 145 
in the work of the schools. A complete organization was 
effected, and an Alumni Day established. 
In January, from money raised by an entertainment, a library 
was formally opened for the accommodation of pupils. Start- 
ing with 288 volumes, it reached, by June, 421. By means of 
fees charged for the use of the books, a small revenue is always 
at hand for the purchase of additional reading matter. 
The cost of the schools was $31,865.82. Not having the 
Treasurer’s report, I am unable to specify the amounts of the 
particular disbursements, or the amounts of income from differ- 
ent sources. The cost of the schools is $1,120.96 less than that 
of last year. ‘ 
The industrial work in the colored schools still goes success- 
fully on under the management of Miss Emily L. Austin. She 
began the year in the new building, the Slater [raining School, 
the money for the erection of which she raised by her own ef- 
forts in Knoxville, Boston, and Philadelphia. 
This school is maintained by.the contributions of friends of 
the work, by the Slater fund, and by the Board of Education 
of our schools. The total expense of the school for the year 
was $2,893.41. The industrial work of the school embraces 
carpentry and printing for the boys, sewing, cooking, etc., for 
the girls. The enrollment for the year was 268.

CITY SCHOOLS. 147 
The educational forces are at present being directed towards 
manual training, or industrial education. As is always the case, 
any new departure from that which has been so long established 
is met by strong opposition, and only by slow degrees does this 
opposition lose effectiveness. Any thing so deeply rooted in 
the affections of the people as are the public schools will, when 
in seeming danger, awaken alarm. There are those who are 
unwilling to believe it possible for manual training to be carried 
aloig pari passu with the ordinary school curriculum; others 
claim they go hand in hand, each strengthening the other. 
There is still a third party who think it best to have the boys 
attend the training school in the evening after regular school 
hours. There is a total misapprehension on the part of the 
general public as to what is expected of the manual training 
school, and how it is to be attained. I cannot better give my 
own views than to quote from another: 
“A few centuries ago Greek and Latin were the only impor- 
tant parts of an education, because they were the only tools by 
which we were able to gain access to the buried treasures of a 
departed civilization ; and even now no one questions their right 
to a place on the list of studies, but their pre-eminence is no 
longer acknowledged. In former years the main object of the 
college was to give a classic education, and the course of study 
in all the lower grade schools was arranged to make them feed- 
ers to the higher schools. The demand to-day is not to lessen 
_ the intellectual culture which the schools are giving, but sim- 
ply add to it the culture of the eye and hand; not to fit chil- 
dren for any particular trade, but to qualify them to be intelli- 
gent workmen in any vocation. The idea which prevails that 
‘industrial schools are trade schools is as ridiculous as it is ab- 
surd. What advantage whould there bein teaching a boy to bea 
shoemaker? Would he peg and stitch in competition with the 
steam power that is employed in the manufacture of shoes? 
Why teach a boy to be a blacksmith? Could he shape and 
weld in competition with the steam hammer? ‘he teaching 
of trades is outside of the question of industrial education. 
' The proposition is to amend the curriculum go that the gradu-
-P-A-G-E-146
148 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
ate of our public schools shall not only have a fair literary edu~ 
cation, but that he shall also be able to draw, design, work to 
plans, and handle tools.” 
I most earnestly recommend that you give this subject your 
patient attention, and that steps be immediately taken to open 
a manual training school on the corner of Spruce and Broad in 
conjunction with the High School. A nominal expense will 
make the experiment. 
Tt may not be out of place just here to add that the High 
School, the crowning glory of the system, has been for several 
years sorely tried by reason of a continuous change in teachers. 
The services of most estimable young men have been secured 
as teachers, and, had they remained, they would have been val- 
uuble accessions to the corps, but their term of service has been 
too short. It is unfortunate for the school that these positions 
should be held by young men who are simply preparing them- 
selves for some other profession, rather than that of teaching. 
However promising they may be, and however well they may 
have stood in the college from which they bear a diploma, they 
are but novices in the business of teaching, and the school must 
suffer, at least till they acquire some professional experience. 
Such policy as will secure a greater length of service, and hence 
a greater degree of permanency in these important positions, 
will contribute much to the successful training of the High 
School pupils. 
In conclusion, I may be permitted to say the regular Normal 
meetings have been held during the session, subjects of interest 
and profit to the teacher, from an educational stand-point, 
have been discussed, many taking part not accustomed to do 
so. Teachers have been prompt and regular in attendance, only 
two being tardy at Normal meeting during the entire year. It. 
is due them to say a most praiseworthy spirit to come square 
up to the line of duty has been manifest, and though some un- 
fortunate coincidences haye conspired to affect the smooth run- 
ning of the schools, and prevent the accomplishment of all that 
might be desired, it is hoped that due allowance may be made 
therefor, and that the failures of all be shielded beneath the
-P-A-G-E-147
CITY SCHOOLS. 149 
charity of a generous public. I desire to return my thanks for 
the sympathy and support of principals and teachers. For the 
courtesy and kindness of each individual member of the Board 
Tam profoundly grateful. 
Respectfully, Z. H. Brown, 
Superintendent of Schools. 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, 
STATE AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGE, KNOXVILLE. 
Report or THE PresipeNT ro THE Stare SuperiNTENDENT oF PusBiic InsrRuC- 
vion—Sxgssion 1887-88. 
To the Honorable State Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Sir—I have the honor, in response to your request, to submit 
the following report on the operations of the University of Ten- 
nessee, the State Agricultural and Mechanical College, during 
the session of 1887-88, and on its present condition : 
The connection of the undersigned with the University of 
Tennessee as its President and the Director of its Experiment 
Station commenced the 4th day of August, 1887, and all the 
information contained herein dates from that time. 
In taking charge of matters on that day, I found, naturally 
enough, that the affairs of the University were in a quite un- 
settled condition, and its buildingsin bad repair. The professors 
and instructors for the current session had been elected only a 
short time, and every preparation for the opening of the insti- 
tution on the first of September had still to be made. Exten- 
sive repairs had to be made immediately, and several professors 
and instructors were engaged. 
Although very little advertising was done, the attendance 
increased from the beginning of the session. There was a large
-P-A-G-E-148
150 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
addition at the beginning of the second term, and by the end 
the aggregate attendance was 50 per cent. greater than it was 
the year previous. 
ATTENDANCE. 
The students in the different departments of the University 
- were as follows: 
I. Collegiate Department 
University Department 
  Total in Academic Departments ........:-...::se-esecen eee 174 
II. The Medical and Dental Departments at Nashville..... 223 
III. Legislative appointees .............-eeeceeeeee see ee ese eeeeeenene 29 
  
Total number in all the departments of the Univer- 
Dy i ised ie ae era sess ooo 
There graduated from the Medical Department in February, 
75; from the Dental Department, 8; with the degree of M. D., 
1; with the degree of D. D.S.,1., This makes a total of 85 
diplomas awarded in the Medical and Dental Departments. 
This is gratifying evidence of a renewal of interest in the insti- 
tution. Still, however, only 42 counties out of our 96 are rep- 
resented here. 161 are from Tennessee. ‘Texas sends 3, Missis- 
sippi 2, Alabama 3, North Carolina 1, Virginia 1, Arkansas 1, 
Louisiana 1, and China 1. 17 counties in East Tennessee have 
97, 16 counties in Middle Tennessee have 43, and 9 counties in 
‘West Tennessee have 21. 
CLASSIFICATION, 
On account of the freedom which it has been the custom to” 
give the students here in the past in selecting their studies, we 
are unable to classify them with perfect strictness as Seniors, 
Juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen, but there are six candi- 
dates for graduation this session, six or eight who will rank as 
Juniors, and fifteen or sixteen Sophomores. The great body of © 
our students are, as naturally follows such a marked increase in
-P-A-G-E-149
CITY SCHOOLS. 151 
attendance, in the two lower classes, the Freshman and Sub- 
freshman. Both of these classes were so large that they had 
to be divided into sections. 
PRACTICE WORK AND MANUAL TRAINING. 
Desiring to train our students to habits of observation, and 
believing that the best way to learn to do a thing is by doing it, 
a great deal of time is given in all the courses to practice and 
laboratory work, in which the principles taught are applied, 
and the student is encouraged to discover new facts for himself. 
Students in chemistry begin work in the laboratory soon 
after they begin in the lecture-room, and carry out a course of 
experiments and investigations parallel with the course of in- 
struction. So in botany and biology. 
The classes in agriculture receive practical dustruction i in the 
field, garden, orchards, stables, dairy, ete., and are téqi ined to 
do enough work to familiarize them eth the methods, ‘mat ru- 
ments, and machines used. But the ends of all such worl, 
which are the acquirement of knowledge and@.certain amouht 
of skill, are kept constantly in view;and the tim, or energies 
of the students in this department are’not too much consumed 
with mere drudgery. When the practice work is Géne, and 
the student has acquired the proper skill, additional work may 
-be given him, for which he is paid at a réasondble) rate? 
Students in the Engineering Course begin in the Freshman 
year to learn the use of the chain and the level’ and have regu- 
lar practice, throughout their course, in the use of engineering 
instruments, and in drawing up and tabulating their results. 
All scientific and engineering students are required to take a 
course in mechanical drawing and shop work. Students in the 
Mechanical, Civil and Mining Engineering Courses and the 
Chemical Course have a longer course in drafting, and in forge 
and machine-shop work. Even in the Literary Departments, 
where it is more difficult, this plan of instruction will be fol- 
lowed to a considerable degree. The general plan is to give 
every student in every class and course a minimum of six hours 
a week, in periods of one and a half and two hours each of 
laboratory, shup, farm, surveying, drafting, or other practice 
work. To this an average of four hours a week of military
-P-A-G-E-150
152 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
drill is to be added, making a total average of two hours per 
day for five days in the week of what is broadly called ‘ practi- 
cal exercises.” 
PAID WORK AND SELF-SUPPORT. 
Students are given the preference in the assignment of work 
on the University grounds, buildings, farm, or -Experiment Sta- 
tion, provided they will do the work to be done in as good a 
manner, at a proper time, and at a rate of compensation not 
exceeding that of other workmen. In practice, our students 
do a great deal of such work. They assist the janitor in caring 
for the buildings, do nearly all the work at the Steward’s Hall, 
make repairs, and assist in construction. in the shops, care for 
the stock, attend to experiments, and do much of the ordinary 
work of the farm, “For this they are paid in proportion to the 
characton of the. W6ek, performed. 
This work cannot be. promised in advance to any one un- 
known tous. As akule it is given to students who have been 
here one term orlonger, and have proven their ability to per- 
form it; and\in no case‘will we guarantee a fixed amount for 
this work, which has to be-paid for by the hour. What a stu- 
dent will-earn will depend entirely upon himself after he has 
securéd the opportunity, New students should have the means 
to pay theit’ Wlidle\expenses for at least one term, and not count 
on any earnings at first. After they are known to us, students 
who desire to get it, and can do good work, seldom fail to get 
as much as they have time or it is well for them to do. 
Both unpaid—class or practice—work and paid work are 
encouraged in every way possible. We have found almost no 
difficulty at all in introducing this. Students are very eager to 
get into the workshop, and they execute their practice work in 
agriculture, with rare exceptions, in a cordial spirit and with 
unexpected interest. 
A large number of students are zealous to get paid work, and 
many are willing to do any thing that comes to hand, either on 
the farm, in the shops,,on the grounds, or in attending to the 
buildings. Fully one hundred of our students have done work 
of this kind during this session. This money is paid out on 
various accounts; but I estimate that, including what they
-P-A-G-E-151
CITY SCHOOLS. 1538 
earned at the Steward’s Hall, students now here have earned 
two thousand dollars during this session. It was well earned 
too. This is certainly inside of the correct sum. It may be 
safely said that they earned a thousand dollars a term or half 
session, or an average of ten dollars apiece. 
The chief workers have been very zealous. I have counted 
seventeen students who have earned twenty-tive dollars and 
over during the term past. With some it amounts to only a 
little more “pocket money.”” But I can say that at least one- 
half of our students avail themselves of this means of help- 
ing themselves, and accomplish something of material advan-— 
tage to them. We have five young men who are practically 
making all of their expenses, and eleven or twelve who are 
making over one-half of their expenses. 
AGRICULTURAL APPRENTICESHIPS. 
A limited number of Agricultural Apprenticeships have been 
established in the Agricultural Department of the University. 
They are awarded to meritorious students of the Agricultural 
Course. These students live and board at the farm, and com- 
bine class instruction with farm practice every day. They keep 
the regular study hours, and are on the same footing as other 
students, but have the preference in the assignment of work. 
In farm practice they are graded and remunerated according to 
their skill and capacity for work. An average of. four hours’ 
work per day, according to the season, will be required. Such 
labor is paid for at the market rates, usually from eight to fif- 
teen cents per hour for farm work. 
The farm practice will embrace instruction in the practical. 
details of farm work and assisting in field and feeding experi- 
ments, dairy work, care and management of stock, of farm 
machinery, underdraining, transplanting, pruning, grafting, 
budding, ete. : 
METHODS OF TEACHING. 
A number of changes have been made in the courses of study 
already, which are designed to give a better knowledge of things 
and more training in habits of observation. We propose to 
begin this at the very bottom of the course.
-P-A-G-E-152
154 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
Some illustrations will explain the methods used. The Sub- 
freshman class spent an hour and forty minutes every afternoon 
in studying physical geography. It was an elementary course 
of study of nature, with specimens and practice in map draw- 
ing. The same class are now taking an elementary course in 
natural history, working and making notes from the specimens 
and the instructor’s explanations exclusively, and with very 
little use of books, except for the pictures. Some of the Fresh- 
men are studying botany and practical agriculture in the same 
manner. Freshmen in the Engineering Courses are working 
two hours a day at mechanical drawing or with wood-working 
tools in the shop. Sophomores begin chemistry in the labora- 
tory and work through a course in inorganic chemistry during 
this session. They spend two hours a day five days in the 
week there, and prepare their own notes from the explanations 
made. After they have worked through a subject they recite 
on it. ‘ 
The class in agriculture has had practice in all the different 
kinds of farm work which the season has allowed. These stu- 
dents have charge of the feeding experiments now going on. 
Another is working regularly in the hortigultural department, 
ete. We cannot go into details at present, but these points will 
indicate the character of practical work which is being done. 
I speak of these features because they are comparatively new 
here. Neither the Faculty nor students take any Jess interest 
in the class work or book work on account of these features. 
2 A DAY’S WORK. 
Let us next take a glance at the schedule of a day’s work: 
Reveille call sounds at 6 o’clock; inspection at 6:30; break- 
fast at 7:00; formation and roll-call at 7:55; chapel from 8:00 
to 8:20. We count the hours from 8:20 to 12:20 by the num- 
bers, Ist, 2d, 3d, and 4th. At 12:20 they go to dinner, and ex- 
ercises are resumed at 1:00. The afternoon periods are fifty 
minutes each. From 1:00 to 1:50 is called the 5th hour; 1:50 
to 2:40 the 6th ; 2:40 to 3:40 the 7th. An hour is devoted to 
drill. This makes six hours and forty minutes of regular, hard 
work—not counting the time taken for formations or chapel. 
Next let us see what is done in these hours:
-P-A-G-E-153
CITY SCHOOLS. 155 
During the six scholastic hours, so to speak, fifty classes 
meet, counting each separate section (occupying an hour) as a 
separate class, and each two-hour class as two classes. There 
were twelve teaching men besides the president, who teaches 
one class a day, and the band-master, whose work did not come 
- within these six hours. This is an average, thus, of four and 
one-sixth hours’ teaching work for each of these men. What 
classes are these? Let us glance at the schedule for the second 
term of this session. There are two sections in arithmetic; 
three sections in preparatory algebra, with one in Freshman 
algebra; two sections in natural history; two sections in 
English literature, and one class or section each in English 
composition, general history, analytical geometry, zoology, 
mineralogy, calculus, geology, logic, logic and philology. There 
are four classes in Latin and three in Greek; two classes 
in French, two classes in German, two classes in mechanics, 
two classes in advanced chemistry; one meets each day; there 
are two classes in drawing and shop work each day, which work 
two hours at a time, alternating—drawing one day and shop 
work the next. The class in first chemistry takes two hours: 
each day, and so does the class in engineering and quantitative 
analysis. The class in land surveying will take two hours a 
day, beginning later in the spring. Botany and practical agri- 
culture occupy two hours a day, alternate. 
So much for the work done this session. Systematic courses 
of study have been arranged for next session, and they are 
described below. . 
ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. 
The University of Tennessee is an integral part of the pub- 
lic educational system of the State. As at present organized, 
it forms the cap-stone of this system, and completes the work 
begun in the public schools. Its existence is due chiefly to the 
bounty of the United States, the largest portion of its income 
being derived from the proceeds of the sale of public lands 
granted to the several States by Act of Congress of July 2d, 
1862. This act was designed to provide in each State “at least 
one college where the leading object shall be, without exclud- 
ing other scientific and classical studies, and including military
-P-A-G-E-154
156 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
tacties, to teach such branches of learning as are related to 
agriculture and the mechanic arts.” The General Assembly of 
the State of Tennessee donated the proceeds of the sale of lands 
granted to it to what was then the East Tennessee University, 
upon the condition that its Trustees should establish “an agri- 
cultural college so as to’ strictly conform to the congressional - 
enactment making the appropriation; and the fund hereby ap- 
propriated shall be used only according to the terms of the con- 
gressional enactment making the appropriation to the State.” 
(The Code, Sec. 323.) The East Tennessee University supplied 
the buildings and land, as was required to be supplied by the 
State under the original act of Congress. The foundation was 
thus laid for the State University ; but the University has re- 
ceived no further aid from the State. 
The present organization of the College of Agriculture, Me-. 
chanie Arts and Sciences is designed to meet the requirements 
of the laws which provided this foundation. 
The Departments of Instruction comprise the following: 
A. Acapemic Durarrment—Atv Kwoxvitie. 
I. The College of Agriculture, Mechanic Arts and Sciences, with 
the following Courses of Study: 
(a) General Science Course. 
(0) Latin-Science Course. 
€ (c) Course in Agriculture. 
(d) Course in Civil Engineering. 
(e) Course in Mechanical Engineering. 
(f) Course in Chemistry. 
(g) Course in Mining Engineering. 
IL. University or Post-graduate Department. 
1. With courses for the graduate degrees of M. A., M.S., 
and Ph. D. 
: 2. With professional courses leading to degrees of C. E., 
Min. E., and Mech. E.
-P-A-G-E-155
CITY SCHOOLS. 157 
B. Proressionan Departments—Ar NASHVILLE. 
(1) A course in Medicine, leading to the degree of M. D., and 
(2) A course in Dentistry, leading to the degree of D. D. 8. 
The public funds are devoted exclusively to the maintenance 
of the College of Agriculture, Mechanie Arts and Sciences, 
_ forming the Collegiate Department of the University at Knox- 
ville. When the State provides the means, other university 
departments will be added, and those in existence will be further 
developed. 
The requirement of the Code (Section 339) that “the accom- 
modation and instruction of persons of color shall be separate 
from the whites” is met by providing corresponding “ accom- 
modations and instruction ” at Knoxville College, in Knoxville, 
Tennessee, for colored youths who pass the required examina- 
tions and receive appointments. 
THE FACULTY. 
The Faculty of the Academic Department consists of a Pres- 
ident, Professors, and Associate Professors, and is aided by 
Assistant Professors, Instructors, and Assistants. ‘It comprises 
the following schools : 
I. School of Ancient Languages. 
IT. School of Modern Languages and English. 
III. School of Mathematics and Civil Engineering.

STUDENTS. 
Students are classed as University, or Post-graduate, and Col- 
legiate. 
1. University Students are such graduates of this University, 
or other institution empowered to confer like degrees on an 
equivalent basis, as are in actual residence and pursuing ad- 
vanced or special studies in some one or more Schools of the 
University. Such students are free from military duty and 
from routine regulations, but are subject to the usual rules of 
good conduct and attention to the duty undertaken. They re- 
side outside the College grounds, and only attend such exercises 
as are assigned them by the President, or committee in charge. 
2. The Collegiate Students are organized on the military plan, 
and are required to live in barracks under the care of the pro- 
fessors and officers. From the beginning of next session the 
President and Commandant will each have a residence upon 
the grounds, and three or four other officers will live in the 
University buildings with the students. 
THE MILITARY FEATURE. 
This has been found conducive to discipline, health, and 
scholarship; but the military feature, though kept up to a high 
standard of excellence, is not allowed to interfere with the 
prosecution of study. 
Besides training young men to habits of self-reliance, order, 
neatness, punctuality, and prompt and unquestioning obedience, 
it has been found to be the best machinery for governing them
-P-A-G-E-158

and promoting good scholarship. The drill, which is not per- 
mitted to absorb too much time, affords fine physical training 
at a time when all boys need it, especially those most studiously 
inclined. The drill is made obligatory, therefore, upon all stu- 
dents of the Collegiate Department—that is, all except Post- 
graduate, or University, and professional students. There is no 
“guard duty.” 
The discipline is in the hands of a Governing Board, com- 
posed of the President, Dean, and Commandant of Cadets. 
A residence for the President is being erected on the grounds. 
The Commandant and Dean will reside at the University also, 
and have immediate supervision of the students at all times. 
The following notes on some of the schools which are new 
here are inserted as a means of introducing them to the public: 
SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND PHYSICS. 
In charge of Professor Coon, aided by Instructor Hancock 
and another instructor. 
A special building for the Mechanical School is being erected, 
and will be completed and equipped, by the opening of the ses- 
sion. It will contain the following apartments: 
First Floor—Boiler and forge shop, in a one-story wing; two 
large machine-shops, tool-room, office and wash-room, in the 
main building. 
Second Floor—Two large wood-working and pattern-making 
shops, office, tool, and store-room. 
Third Floor—Two drawing-rooms, with windows and sky- 
lights, laboratory and instrument-room, blue-print room, and 
recitation-room. 
The building will be well equipped with boiler, engine, forges, 
hand and power wood-working and machine tools, apparatus, 
models, ete. 
I. Mecuanican EnGineerine. 
The Freshman and Sophomore Classes will work ten hours a 
week in the carpentering, wood-working, joining, pattern-mak- 
ing, and forge shops. ; 
The Juniors and Seniors will work in the machine-shop, 
‘study theoretical mechanics, and have machine designing, say

four hours; the Juniors kinematics, three hours; and the Sen- 
iors thermodynamics, machine testing, and experiments, say 
four hours. : 
A Post-graduate Course in Mechanics will be arranged, in- 
_ cluding a study of development in mining and railway machin- 
ery, especially pumping engines and locomotives; in the design 
and theoretical investigation of the two systems of air com- 
pressing (wet and dry) for mining purposes; in mining ma- 
chinery for coal, iron, copper, silver, and gold mining; in ma- 
chinery for refining the precious metals; and in appliances for 
smelting and reducing the baser metals. 
In such Post-graduate work the aim will not be merely to 
teach abstract principles, but to give such instruction, by lect- 
ures and the working out of designs, as will enable the student 
to have a thoroughly practical understanding of the subject 
investigated. il. Puystcs. 
A course beginning in the Junior year and extending through 
the Senior, with laboratory practice, ete., will be provided and

SCHOOL OF BOTANY AND HORTICULTURE. 
In charge of Professor Scribuer. 
I. Borayy. 
The aim will be to teach the students habits of close and crit- 
ical,observation, and to fit them to study botany independently 
or conduct original investigations in any department of the 
science. While, in. order to educate the power of observation, 
it is necessary to devote considerable time to technical details 
and work of a purely scientific character, the economic side of 
the question will be kept constantly in view, and all made to 
serve practical ends. 
During the second half of the Freshman year two hours per 
week will be spent in the study of organography, learning the 
nomenclature of the organs and external parts, the determina- 
tion of species of phanerogams, and the preparation of herba- 
rium specimens. 
Beginning with the Sophomore year the laboratory method of 
teaching will be generally adopted. The instruction cf the 
year will embrace the leading morphological facts of an im- 
portant type in each of the chief groups of the vegetable king- 
dom. The students will be taught to observe, study, and draw 
for themselves the objects assigned. The first term will be de- 
voted to the types of the principal groups of the higher plants. 
The minute anatomy or histology will be studied, and to this 
end instruction will be given in the use of the compound mi- 
eroscope and the principal microscopical reagents, as well as in 
the preparation of permanent microscopic mounts. During 
the second term, when types of the thallophytes will be taken 
up, special attention will be given to the groups of fungi of 
economic importance—viz., peronosporee, erysiphes, urediner, 
etc. The student will be taught to identify species in these 
groups. 
During the second half of the Junior year lectures will be 
given in Systematic and Economic Botany, Plant Pathology 
and Teratology, with laboratory work in the investigation of 
the diseases of plants caused by vegetable parasites.
-P-A-G-E-161
  CITY SCHOOLS. i 163 
Post-graduates will be provided with facilities for prosecuting 
advanced work in Systematic Botany, in the study of Grasses, 
in the study of Vegetable Histology, or in Plant Pathology. 
II. Horticunrore. 
Horticulture will begin with the first term of the fourth or 
Senior year. The previous work in Botany will have formed a 
~ good basis for the study of Horticulture. .The principles of the 
science will have been learned, for the most part, and the stu- 
dent can proceed to their direct application. Grafting, bud- 
ding, layering, and other methods of propagation, pollination, 
and hybridizing can be pursued intelligently, and will enter into 
the course. 
Outdoor culture, management of hot-beds, cold frames, and 
culture under glass will be considered. The pinciples of viti- 
culture, and the important points in the culture and manage- 
ment of the leading fruit trees and vegetables, as well as the 
diseases affecting them, will be treated. : 
The fruits and vegetables cultivated on the grounds of the 
University will afford ample material for the practical investi- 
gation of the subject. 
The School of Botany will have two laboratories, a lecture- 
room and museum, space in the building for agriculture and 
natural history, described below. 
THE SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY 
-Is one of the new ones; Associate Professor Summers has 
charge of it. 
I. Presuman Course. 
Introductory Course in Natural History.—This course is de- 
signed to develop the student’s powers of observation, and 
teach him the methods of scientific Natural History work. 
Entomology is chosen as the subject for this course, but while 
something will necessarily be learned of the classification of in- 
sects and their economic importance, and while facts concerning 
the latter will always be introduced when possible, still the 
primary objects of the course will be as above stated; the study

of Entomology proper being reserved fora later year (see Course 
Four). ‘Two exercises of two hours each per week of practical 
work in laboratory and field during the first term. 
Il. Sornomore Courss. 
Zoology.—In this course the chief facts in the anatomy of the 
different groups of animals will be observed, and the resulting 
classification, and the philosophical basis for deriving this 
classification from the observed facts, studied. The comparative 
physiology of the various groups will also be treated of. Part 
of the exercises will be devoted to lectures and the dissection 
and study of representative forms, part to recitations upon. the. 
facts brought out in the lectures and dissections. 
Three exercises per week, through the entire Sophomore 
year. After 1888-9 students must have had Course I. before | 
taking Course II. 
III. Juntor Course. 
First Term. Physiology.—The lectures upon this subject will 
be devoted mostly to the physiology and hygiene of man, with 
occasional reference to that of the domesticated animals. Three 
exercises per week through the First Term of the Junior year. 
After 1888-9 students taking this course must previously have 
had Course IT. 
IV. Course. 
Second Term. Lntomology.—The instruction will be partly 
by lectures and partly by work in field and laboratory upon thé 
structure, classification, and habits of insects, with especial ref- 
erence to their economic importance. Three exercises per week 
during the Second Term of the Junior year. 
Post-graduate Courses.—The advantages of a newly-equipped 
laboratory are offered to Post-graduate students and others pre- 
pared to use them properly. Courses in comparative anatomy, 
microscopical technology and histology, and advanced work in 
entomology are especially to be mentioned. These courses will 
be adapted to the individual needs of each student. Full op- 
“portunity will be offered advanced students of entomology to 
study the experiments carried on in the regular Experiment 
Station work.

    CITY SCHOOLS. 165 
The equipment for the biological and botanical laboratories 
has been ordered from Germany. Microscopes, dissecting in- 
struments, and other apparatus are provided, also the proper 
furniture, etc., and we will have these schools thoroughly well 
equipped by the first of September. The University of Ten- ~ 
nessee will then have the credit of having established the first 
complete laboratories and separate schools of instruction in 
botany and biology south of the Potomac and Ohio Rivers.

THE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE 
Has been separated from the Schools of Botany and Biology, 
and placed upon an independent basis, Professor Plumb is in 
charge, aided by Assistant Professor Newman. 
The course of instruction is both theoretical and practical, 
and follows a system proceeding from the more elementary to 
the higher studies underlying agriculture. 
The following schedule is subject to minor changes only: 
Freshman Year. First Term—The History of Agriculture 
will be briefly considered, to be followed by a study of Chem- 
istry as applied to the farm. Following these will come the 
subjects of Soils, Drainage, Tillage, Fallowing, Manures, and 
Rotation of Crops. 
Sophomore Year. First Term—The Cereals and Grasses will 
first be studied from a purely agricultural stand-point— Weeds 
in relation to the farm, Farm Fences and Architecture, Agri- 
cultural Implements and Road-making. 
Junior Year. One Term or Equivalent—The time of this 
class will be entirely devoted to matters pertaining to live stock, 
as follows: Feeding Stuffs, Live Stock Breeding from a Physi- 
ological Stand-point, the Breeds of Live Stock, the Care and 
_ Management of Domestic Animals. 
Senior Year. One Term or Equivalent—As Dairy Husbandry 
is primarily dependent upon live stock, this subject succeeds 
_ the work of the Junior Class, and is followed by lectures on 
- Rural Law and Farm Hygiene. The College Course in Agri- 
culture is terminated with a review of the importatit points of 
the four years work, known as Senior Review. : 
No text-book will be used, but lectures consisting of the 
most reliable and recent data from the*various agricultural au-

thorities, coupled with the experimental work and observations 
of the professor, will comprise the instructions in the class- 
room. The students are to take notes during the lectures, and 
these are to be written up in record books, giving clearly the 
main points of each lecture. 
In addition to this theoretical teaching, a a certain amount of - 
time will be devoted to class work on the farm or experimental 
grounds, putting into practical application, whenever possible, 
the principles taught in the lecture-room. Pictures and models 
of plants, farm products or museum specimens, ete., will be used 
to illustrate the lectures. As the various subjects are taken up, 
the classes will be referred to standard treatises upon the work 
inhand. During the course of each year, the classes will visit 
certain farms within suitable range of Knoxville, that illustrate 
the most approved methods of practical agriculture, or where 
_ work of: special interest is carried on, as applied to class-room 
studies. 
The University farm is well equipped with thoroughbred and 
native live stock, modern agricultural implements, ete. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  168 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
most profitable and progressive methods of farming are prac- 
ticed, both in breeding live stock, in dairy husbandry, grain and 
grass-growing, and market-gardening. Constant additions are 
being made to the stock of modern agricultural implements. 
In every way the University farm and Experiment Station are 
made to serve as aids in educating the students. 
While instruction in the above one is based upon principles 
and facts as applied to agriculture in general, the point is never 
lost sight of that this work is primarily intended to benefit the 
farmers of Tennessee; hence, whenever possible and advantage- 
ous, the student is referred to object lessons within the State. 
The new building for agricultural and natural history (see 
engraving) will contain the laboratories for botany, biology, and 
zoology, and agricultural chemistry each. It will have, in addi- 
tion, a special library and reading-room for natural history, a 
large lecture-hall, and the offices of the Experiment Station. A 
complete set of the best apparatus, microscopes, books, etc., for 
these schools has just been purchased in Europe by an officer of 
the University. 
The Agricultural Museum, which will in future act as a valu- 
able aid to instruction, is located in the agricultural building. 
THE FARM. 
The Agricultural Department has a beautiful and well-stocked 
~ farm of over two hundred acres, with experimental dairy, sta- 
bles, plant-house, and horticultural grounds. The Agricultural 
Experiment Station established here recently by the United 
States Government affords many advantages to scientific and 
agricultural students. The facilities for instruction in this de- 
partment are better than at any previous time in the history of 
the University, and are being rapidly improved. The Agricult- 
ural Experiment Station is now organized, and much experi- 
mental work will be conducted by experts that will be of signal 
aid to the students. In every direction object lessons will be 
placed before the young men. In addition to the inside work 
of the Station, extensive field experiments will be in operation, 
both on the University grounds and at the farm. Already a 
fruit orchard of over two hundred and fifty varieties has been 
established at the University, adjoining the agricultural building.
-P-A-G-E-167
    CITY SCHOOLS. 169 
The University greenhouse is in an excellent condition. Sev- 
eral hundred varieties of growing plants are always available 
for instruction in botany. 
The College farm, consisting of two hundred and sixty acres, 
is considered one of the best in East Tennessee. The general 
run of farm crops are grown, and in addition a market-garden 
is in operation, where are produced the vegetables adapted to 
the State. 
A first-class working herd of about forty Jersey, Holstein- 
Friesian, and native cattle belong to the farm. Some of these 
represent animals of leading milk and butter strains. A dairy 
is at present in process of construction, where approved proc- 
esses of dairying will be carried on and the most approved 
dairying implements will be used. 
In the winter and spring, feeding experiments are conducted 
upon live stock, in the work of which ambitious agricultural 
students usually have a part. 
THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION. 
A matter of special importance to the University, and to the 
State at large, was the final appropriation, last winter, of funds 
for the Agricultural Experiment Station established here under 
the Hatch Bill. This resulted in the University securing at 
last the promised appropriation of $15,000 per annum. 
The Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station, established 
by the Board of Trustees of the University of Teunessee on 
_ June 8th, 1882, has been re-organized in accordance with this 
act, and the act of the General Assembly of ‘Tennessee of 
March the 28th, 1887, which endow ed this Station with the 
benefits of the said act. 
Its officers are as follows: 
Charles W. Dabney, Jr., Ph. D. (Goettingen), Director. 
Charles 8. Plumb, B. S. (Massachusetts Agricultural College), 
Assistant Director, in charge of Field and Feeding Leta 
ments. 
F. Lamson Scribner, B. 8. (Maine State College), Bowe 
and Horticulturist. 
Winthrop E. Stone, B. 8. (Massachusetts A Rrlolane! Col- 
lege, Goettingen), Chemist. i
-P-A-G-E-168

Henry E. Summers, B. 8. (Cornell University), Entomologist. 
Clifford Lewis Newman, B. 8. (Alabama Agricultural and 
Mechanical College), Assistant in Field and Feeding Experi- _ 
ments. 
The necessary laboratories are being erected, and the Station. 
will be fully prepared on the first of September next to under- — 
take any of the work required of it by the laws under which it 
is established. 
The Station is a bareau of information for farmers, and every 
Tennessee citizen interested in developing our agricultural in- 
dustries or resources has the right to apply to the Station for 
any assistance that comes within its province to render, and the 
Station will respond to all applications as far as lies within its 
power. : 
The Station will have good facilities for analyzing and testing 
fertilizers; cattle foods, milk, and dairy products; seeds, with 
reference to their purity or germinating power; for identifying 
grasses and weeds, and studying forage plants; for investigat- 
ing the diseases of fruits and fruit trees, grains, and other use- 
ful plants; for making reports on injurious insects, and the 
best means of combating them, and for investigating the dis- 
éases of domestic animals. No samples can be received for 
chemical analysis until the new laboratory is completed on the 
first of September. The Station will make such analyses, seed 
tests, reports, etc., for the citizens of ‘Tennessee without charge, 
provided— 
1. That the results are of use to the public, and are free to 
publish. 
2. That the samples are taken from fresh stock now on the 
market and in accordance with the Station directions for taking 
samples. 
3. That the samples or specimens sent are fully described ac- 
cording to directions. In case of fertilizers, a complete tran- 
script of the brand, and the analysis printed on the packages or 
given by the manufacturer, and a statement of the price at 
which it is retailed, must be given. 
All other work proper to the Experiment Station, and com- 
_. ing within the laws under which it is established, that can be 
used for the public benefit will be made without charge. Notes

_ of observations and suggestions of subjects of ivepeeu 
clearly and briefly written, will be welcomed. 
~ The bulletins and reports, giving the results of experiments 
and investigations that are of general interest, will be sent free 
of charge to all persons “actually engaged in farming” who 
request them. : 
Packages by express, to receive attention, should be prepaid. 
_ All communications should be addressed, not to any individual 
officer, but simply to the “Experiment Station,’ Knoxville, 
Tenn. 
THE LOCATION. 
The University is located in the suburban town of West - 
Knoxville, a separate corporation, and one which prohibits the 
sale of spirituous liquors. 
The location of the University is unsurpassed for healthful- 
ness and beauty. It is eleven hundred feet above the sea, in 
the mountains of East Tennessee. Its ten large buildings are 
located in a beautiful campus of fifty acres, covering a high 
hill on the banks of the Tennessee River. They command a 
beautiful view of the valley of the Tennessee River from 
the Smokies to the Cumberland Mountains, and extending for 
a hundred miles. The drainage and all sanitary conditions are 
as nearly perfect as can be. 
It is always a great advantage to boys to spend a portion of 
their period of growth in a higher location than that in which 
they were reared. Thus the location of the University, amidst 
the mountains of East Tennessee, renders it especially adapted 
to the requirements of the young men of the middle and west- 
ern portions of the State. The youths from the latter sections 
generally take a fresh growth, and, if they have been infected 
with malaria, become ruddy and healthy when they have been 
at the University for six months. ae 
ADMISSION. 
Under recently amended rules of the Board of Trustees, all 
candidates for admission must be provided with credentials from 
_ their last school or instructor, giving evidence of good moral 
character, and must be at least fifteen years of ‘age. ® 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
172 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
To enter the Sub-freshman, or lowest class in the University, 
the candidate must show upon examination, held at the Univer- 
sity as provided below, that he possesses a thorough knowledge 
of Arithmetic, English Grammar and Composition, Geography 
and United States History, at least as far as is taught in the 
common schools of this State. : 
Examinations for admission and classification will be held at 
the University according to law, beginning Monday, September 
3d, at 9 o’clock A. M., and continue three days. All recruits 
and unclassified cadets of the Collegiate Department must re- 
port to the President at that time. 
At the opening of the second half session or term another 
opportunity for admission will be given, and the same rules will 
prevail. 
STATE STUDENTS. 
The method of appointment of State students is as follows: 
The State Superintendent of Public Instruction issues notices 
to the County and City Superintendents in the month of May 
of each year, requiring them to hold public examinations of 
candidates for appointments in their respective counties or cities, 
and giving directions as to their examinations, which are de- 
signed to select the best students and to make sure that those 
appointed are prepared to enter at least the lowest class in the 
University. é 
The County and City Superintendents are required to give 
public notice of the examinations and the advantages offered 
by the University, and to hold such examinations as may be 
necessary during the month of June. From the list of candi- 
dates found qualified and numbered in the order of merit, each . 
State Senator can appoint three, and each State Representative 
two, young men to cadetships in the University. State Senators 
and Representatives can appoint other persons not on this list; 
but in doing so they take the responsibility for their prepara- 
tion. The students thus appointed must be at least fifteen 
years of age, and prepared to enter regular collegiate classes as 
described above. (See “Admission.”) Senators and Representa- 
tives are requested, as far as practicable, to make their appoint- 
ments subject to these competitive examinations of applicants 
é e
-P-A-G-E-171
CITY SCHOOLS. - 173 
  by the Courty or City Superintendents of Public Schools. As 
the usefulness of the University is so largely dependent on the 
appointments of members of the Legislature, they are earnestly 
urged to give attention, that its benefits may be secured as 
widely as possible to the youth of the State in their respective 
counties and districts. 
  In order that no worthy and qualified young men shall fail 
to get the advantages of the University, the Board of Trustees 
have authorized the County and City Superintendents to rec- 
ommend to the President such young men as they see fit for 
appointment to cadetships. The President of the University is 
authorized by law to appoint such qualitied candidates to any 
» yacancies which may remain to be filled in any county or dis- 
trict on the 10th of August of each year after the Senators and 
Representatives have completed their appointments. 
BOARD AND EXPENSES, y 
All students, except those who have parents or very near rel- 
_atives in the city, are required to live in the College buildings 
and board at the Steward’s Hali. Some students on the Hill 
board in private messes at $5 per month. Board at the Stew- 
ard’s Hall is $10 per month; fuel, lights, and washing will 
amount to about $10 for the half session or term. Hence, for 
students boarding at the Steward’s Hall, the current expenses 
for a half session will be about $58. The total expenses of a 
student boarding at the Steward’s Hall for a full session of ten 
months need not exceed $186. This includes every thing that 
he needs—board, uniform, books, furniture, fuel, and lights. It 
_ does not, however, include pocket money or traveling expenses. 
For a State student, boarding in the student’s private mess, the 
total expense for ten months will not exceed $136. Students 
from beyond the confines of the State, who pay full tuition and 
fees and board at the Steward’s Hall, can spend a ten ‘months’ 
session at the University, and pay all their expenses, with $246. 
INFIRMARY. 
A neat and comfortable Infirmary is provided for those who 
_ May at any time be sick; this is in a separate building, in a 
quiet place, and is furnished comfortably, and provided with all
-P-A-G-E-172
174 : TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
the necessary conveniences. The sick are taken immediately — 
to the Infirmary, nursed and cared for, medical attention and 
medicines being provided at the expense of the University. 
THE NEXT SESSION 
Begins September 6th, 1888. The entrance examinations for 
the next session will begin at 9 o’clock a. m., Monday, Septem- 
ber 3d. All students must be present, matriculate, and have

In accordance with your request, I have endeavored to pre- 
pare a narrative report, touching on those matters only which 
were likely to be of most interest to the people at large. I have 
not endeavored to make it a complete official report, but rather 
a popular description. 
T hope that I have complied with your wishes in a measure, 
and that this report will serve the purposes for which you de- 
sign it. Respectfully submitted,

ANDERSON COUNTY. 
P. M. Hoskins, SupERINTENDENT, Clinton. 
In making this, my first annual report, I have to say that our 
schools are in a prosperous condition; have more efficient 
teachers than usual. Our Normal lasted two weeks; was well 
attended by teachers and parents, About forty teachers were 
enrolled. 
The trouble with us is, the money is not sufficient to educate 
the children; the parents mainly depend upon it, and conse- 
quently their education is quite limited. Our county has been 
greatly in debt, which is now about paid. We will have more 
money as soon as the people have recovered from the burden- 
_ some taxation that has been upon them. The educational in- 
terest depends upon the teachers, and we are trying to get 
teachers who are in the work heart and soul, and trying to get 
rid of those who are teaching for the money. Several new 
school-houses are being built this year. 
BEDFORD COUNTY.

____ In obedience to the law and your request, ‘submit herewith 
my third annual report of the schools and school-work of this
-P-A-G-E-174

county, which is as nearly correct as patience and diligence, for 
my part, can make it. 
Since the date of my last report, I have visited every public 
school in the county—many of them twice. They are in a 
prosperous condition, doing good work, and giving satisfaction 
generally. The most serious and general complaint originates 
in the comparative shortness of the school term. This com- 
plaint, in a few instances, has led to an error, as the Directors 
have tried to lengthen the term by shortening the teacher’s 
salary. 
The new buildings are judiciously and satisfactorily located, 
neat, comfortable, and well furnished. No more uncouth and 
inferior school-houses will be built in this county. The few 
that we have will soon be gone, for the people are demanding 
better houses as well as better teachers. 
The Reading Circle meets regularly the first Saturday in each 
month, and is doing interesting and valuable work. Quite a 
number of teachers have become thorougly enlisted in the work. 
They are pleased with it. They regard it as a timely, pleasant, 
efficient, and permanent means of professional improvement. 
The last meeting was very interesting and successful; but we 
have injured the Circle some by attempting to carry it to vari- 
ous points in the county. 
The State Teachers’ Reading Circle was well worth keeping 
alive. Shall we hear no more of it? 
The third session of the Normal Institute was held in June, 
and continued ten days. This was as much time as we could 
get without interfering with the opening or closing of sonte of 
the schools. 
Tn addition to the public school branches, classes were organ- 
ized in Book-keeping, Algebra; and Latin. I did not object to 
having these classes organized, as the teachers paid the expenses 
of the Institute, and many of them are required to teach these 
branches; besides, these classes did not interfere with other 
work, as their recitations were in another room. The entire 
session was one of much interest, profit, and satisfaction to all 
concerned, and it has evidently led to many improvements in 
our school work. By actual experience, our teachers have 
learned to place a high estimate on this annual training, and
-P-A-G-E-175
  COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. aT 
have evidently determined to maintain it. Before adjourning, 
complete arrangements were made for a more extensive and, if 
possible, a more successful session next year. 
The colored teachers continued their Institute work fifteen 
days. The attendance was good. They employed one teacher. 
The work was well done and properly appreciated. The col- 
ored teachers of this county are becoming very deeply inter- 
ested in their own improvement and the improvement of their 
schools. 
By referring to my statistical reports, you will see that the 
enrollment and average daily attendance are a fraction less this 
year than last. This looks like failure; but, by taxing your 
time and space, it could be explained to the county’s credit. 
Really the schools of this county, both public and private, were 
never in better condition than they have been during the past 
year. The spirit of progress and improvement was never more 
general nor more effective. Popular education has stronger 
advocates and more of them. Directors, teachers, patrons, and 
pupils are working as if inspired by new life, stronger energies, 
and higher aspirations. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
D. J. Auten, SupERINTENDENT, Benton. 
This is my seventh annual report of the Benton County 
schools, and I am glad to state that there is still some improve- 
ment going on. Some of our teachershave been attending Nor- 
mal Schools, and are consequently better prepared to teach, 
and at the Institute and public examination I find that others 
are falling into line. I think we should have better facilities. 
for more local Normal training in each county, as some are not 
able to bear the expense of attending the Normal if it is at a 
great distance; and I find that the cheap teacher is still looked 
for by some, instead of the good, practical teacher, though our 
Directors are generally our best men—I always appoint that 
he
-P-A-G-E-176
178 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
kind when left to me to make an appointment—and they are 
waking up, as they cannot help seeing that as the teacher, so is 
the school. Then I find the masses are taking more interest in 
the schools, especially where there is a live teacher in the 
school-room. He generally infuses interest among the patrons. 
Our County Court, which is composed mostly of judicious men, 
have levied an additional tax to make the school term longer, 
which was a wise step, though it is not long enough yet, as we 
only have about three and a half months’ school. I think the 
law contemplates a five months’ school in every district, and I 
hope it will not be long until we will have it. 
‘We now have nearer uniformity in text-books than ever be- 
fore, though there are some schools where the books are very 
much mixed up yet. I believe that most of the schools have 
given satisfaction. I have always endeavored to visit as nearly 
all of the schools in the county as possible, and always endeavor 
to give some encouragement to theéstudents, as well as to con- 
fer with the teachers and District Directors. I have given my 
time and best energies to the work. I find the Directors and 
teachers, with but few exceptions, attending to their duties 
right, though I have not got them all to attend the public ex- 
amination. Some do not attend the Institute, and some Di- 
rectors do not visit the schools in their districts. There are 
some teachers who do not read school journals, and still others 
who have not completed the course of study recommended by 
the State Teachers’ Reading Circle, and consequently do not 
grade very high in theory and practice; but still the great ma- 
jority of teachers and Directors are doing better in these par- 
ticulars than the Directors and teachers of five or six years 
ago, which is some encouragement, and causes me to believe 
that the improvement will still go on. 
In conclusion, I yet hope that the time is not far distant when 
all, both rich and poor, will gladly receive the full benefits of a 
_ free school education.

I now have the honor of submitting to you my first annual 
report. 
This report is much behind time on account of teachers, Di- 
rectors, and Trustees not responding to me in time. 
I was compelled to get on my horse and go to the residences 
of some of the Directors in order to get their reports. I hope 
that I will be able to report earlier next time. 
Our schools are doing very well this year considering the 
length that we can run them. 
The County Court is very negligent in regard to our County 
Schools. The thought of levving a higher tax scares them. 
The usual prejudice against female teachers is still kept up 
.in the county, as you can see by our report.

* In making this, my first annual report of the condition of 
the schools of Blount, I find a very great lack of data from 
which to get a correct statistical report; therefore the expendi- 
tures and average attendance are only estimates of what I 
think they should be. This is mainly the result of Directors 
failing to make their reports in full, and in securing abstracts 
from teachers. 
The following is the scholastic population: 
White—Male, 3,200; female, 2,980; total, 6,180. 
 Colored—Male, 299; female, 279; total, 578. Grand total, 
6,758. 
The average daily attendance was: White, 4,875; colored, 
428; total 5,303.
-P-A-G-E-178
  180 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
Our public schools are not what the friends of popular educa- 
tion desire. In many of the districts the schools are taught in 
rented houses, and others in houses fitted for devotional services. 
Nevertheless we have many public school-houses well fitted for 
school purposes, and others in process of erection. 
Many noble men and women are on the teachers’ roll labor- 
ing earnestly for the development of the minds of the youths in 
their charge. 
Our county Normal, held in Maryville College, was well at- 
tended, considering the health of the county at that time. 
Measles visited us early in the spring, and flux, in the form of 
an epidemic, in the months of June and July. The teachers in 
attendance were greatly benetited, and their work is very sat- 
isfactory. The patrons of their schools are ready to exclaim: 
“« Well done, good and faithful servants, come up higher!” and 
receive better pay and more desirable positions. 
We have a uniformity of text-books for the county; and the 
county, with few exceptions, has conformed to it. A prescribed, 
course of study (or graded system) was prepared for the county, 
which is now in the hands of the teachers and many of the 
patrons. We hope thereby to systematize and unify the school 
work, and in the near future be able to report favorable results 
from the prescribed course. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
M. R. M. Burks, Superintenpent, Chatata. 
Inclosed find my third annual report for Bradley County. I 
experienced some difficulty in getting up the necessary papers 
to make up a correct report, because some teachers failed to 
make out abstracts of their schools, and Directors failed to make 
their reports according to law,and also failed in some instances 
to require abstract reports of their teachers before paying them 
their last installment. I shall require of the teachers next year 
to return abstracts direct to me. We are making considerable
-P-A-G-E-179
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 181 
progress in the way of having better qualified teachers and 
more suitable houses. We, as usual, had our County Normal 
of two weeks in July; keld at Chatata. About forty of our 
teachers were in attendance. There are a few of our teachers 
who have not yet awoke to the importance of attending the 
Normals, but the interest is greater year after year. Since the 
institution of our Normal the wages of our teachers have in- 
ereased. I employed the services of Prof. A. D. Cate to con- 
duct a colored Normal at Cleveland during the month of July, 
and, with one or two exceptions, all the colored teachers were 
in attendance. They are making progress in the work. 
I have adopted the plan of holding Institutes each week 
in the different districts. The teachers, patrons, and children 
turn out, and we have a picnic at each meeting, and consider- 
able interest is manifested among the patrons. 
We have built four new houses in one district this year and an 
academy at Red Hill, in the Fifth District, and a comfortable 
house in another district. With two exceptions our districts 
are all supplied with good houses. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
W. L. McGer, Suverinrenpent, Wellspring. 
I forward my third annual report by to-day’s mail, as I want 
to be prompt. 
I will say that in the month of January, 1887,I formed three 
Reading Circles at various points of the county, so that the 
teachers could be at one of these meetings. I soon had a mem- 
bership of forty-five live.teachers. Very soon the books were 
ordered, and each teacher was armed and equipped with his or 
her three books. So the teachers meet every two weeks, and 
read and discuss what has been gone over; and I don’t want to 
forget to say that the Live teachers must have forty copies of 
the Southwestern Journal. So, you see, the teachers of Camp- 
bell County are not behind. I dare say that mo county in the
-P-A-G-E-180
  182 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
ninety-six can boast of a more live set of teachers. It is no 
trouble to get the teachers to attend Institutes or Teachers’ 
Meetings, as I have had teachers to attend Institutes at a dis- 
tance of twenty-five miles, and especially the professors. On 
some of these interesting meetings we were favored with a 
good picnic dinner, and always‘close with the best of feelings. 
I owe much of my success to the good school men of the 
county. Some of the best tax-payers say that the schools are 
fifty per cent. better in this county than ever before. I have 
found only one man in the county opposed to free schools, and 
he won’t send to the free schools. 
I visited all the schools, and made a public address to each 
school. My first year I had some drones trying to teach, or 
only to keep school. I soon got rid of them, by not giving 
certificates to them the next year. My School Directors have 
worked all the time for good schools. Some of our school- 
houses are dilapidated and need attention, but, on the whole, 
we are not far behind in this direction. I will close by express- 
ing my thanks to the State Superintendent for his advice. 
CANNON COUNTY. 
James H. Knox, Superintenpent, Bradyville. 
{ forward my statistical report, which, at this date, appears 
tardy, but this tardiness must not be attributed, as has been 
usual, to the other school officers of the county. The reports 
of the Trustees and Directors, and the abstracts of the teachers, 
were all in on time, and my report was almost complete six 
weeks ago, but sickness and an inability to write at all prevented 
its completion until within the last few days. The report is 
complete of every district and school in the county, and when 
compared with that of last year it shows much that is encour- 
aging. 
The public school system of Tennessee never had a deeper 
hold upon the ghearts of our people than at present, and our
-P-A-G-E-181
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 183 
outlook is growing more brilliant every year. In reporting this 
it is proper to say there is some opposition to our system of 
schools, but by no means is it so glaring as it was a few years 
ago. It is clearly evident that our schools are receiving aid and 
encouragement from all our people. The lamentable ery of the 
old croakers “that public schools are only for poor white trash 
and niggers,” has been drowned in the tide of progress, and 
our schools nurtured and patronized by all. It is pleasant to 
visit our schools and find in the same class, and often on the 
same seat, children of the banker and the mechanie striving 
with as much zeal to excel and with as kind feeling as ever per- 
meated the hearts of pupils. 
It seems that a new era is about to dawn, “ with fairer skies 
and brighter sun,” for education in our county. One omen is, 
to see that our Directors have almost buried into oblivion the 
old favoritism system that has been such a drawback to our 
schools. It is truly encouraging to be able to report that our 
Directors, with few exceptions, are employing the best teachers 
their limited means will afford. Another feature worthy of 
note is the improved condition of our houses. During the past 
year, outside the city, we have seen erected four nice, well ven- 
tilated frame and one cozy log school-house. These and many 
others have been seated with the improved desk. 
The great barrier to progress in our schools is a lack of funds. 
We have an increase of nearly 1,000 in scholastic population 
since 1877, yet our funds for school purposes are only slightly 
increased, and that alone by an increase in value of property, 
the rate being about the same. I am fully satisfied that our 
people will more readily assent to an increase in taxes for 
school purposes than for any other. They feel that taxes for 
educating our girls and boys, like vapors, rise to descend in 
showers to bless and beautify the land. 
I feel that it would be ingratitude of the worst type to close 
this report without many thanks to you. 
We have all been inspired with new life and firm resolutions 
to make this year a most successful one in educational circles.

184 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
J. P. Jounson, Superinrenpent, Huntingdon. 
T have the honor herewith to transmit my first annual report 
for the scholastic year ending June 30th, 1887. Our school 
work has moved smoothly on, with considerable improvement 
in enrollment and average aundshee: I find in most districts 
that patrons are taking a decided stand in favor of the great 
cause of education and its general advancement, but I am sorry 
to say this is not the case in every instance; they want cheap 
teachers, without regard to their proficiency, experience, ete. 
The young teachers of our county deserve much credit for 
the interest and energy displayed in their school work. Most 
of them are spending their leisure time and means in improv- 
ing themselves for the work before them. Some of the old 
teachers of our county are splendid workers i in the school- -room, 
while others are somewhat deficient as to latest methods and 
government. I find some of the best work done in the school- 
room in this county is done by the young ladies. In nearly 
every instance they have given universal satisfaction. 
We have several splendid buildings in the rural districts; in 
fact some of them are superior to those in the towns and vil- 
lages. Directors have come to the conclusion that it is better 
to build good houses, and furnish them with good desks, rather 
than have uncomfortable houses furnished with the antedilu- 
vian bench. We are just completing a splendid brick building 
in the country (the only brick school-house in the county). We 
have several consolidated schools in the county, and the ques- 
tion is being agitated in seven or eight districts. 
I have visited about all the summer schools in the county 
this summer, making it a rule to spend as much as an hour in 
each school. I tried to visit all the schools, consequently could 
not spend as much time in each as I should have done. 
I find the schools, almost without exception, doing well, 
where the teachers have been selected with sole regard to their 
capacity to teach well; but, insome instances, where the teacher
-P-A-G-E-183
    Z 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. coe ABA 
has been selected through personal favoritism, the school lan- 
guishes. 
Our financial condition is splendid. The Directors have, 
generally, managed the school fund of their respective districts 
judiciously, with the exception that they do not grade the sala- 
ries of teachers with enough regard as to their qualifications to 
teach. Our County Trustee has been very judicious in the dis- 
bursement of the school fund. 
I will close this report with the observation that we need 
more money, longer terms, and more interest manifested by 
patrons. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
T. F. M. Smoor; Supertnrenpent, Elizabethton. 
I have the honor herewith to present my annual report of 
the public schools of Carter County. The report is as nearly 
correct as I can make it from the papers at my command. Our 
schools are decidedly improving, our teachers are more efficient, 
and cozy, comfortable school-houses are sufficiently convenient 
to every child in our county. We have adopted a uniform set 
of text-books, and are working them in our schools nicely. 
The prospects for the future are brighter than at any time here- 
tofore. 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
= R.S. Turner, Surpermrenpent, Ashland City. 
My report shows very little change since last year, yet we 
are doing better. We have adopted—or recommended to our 
Directors and teachers—a course of study and system of grad- 
ing schools. This was done by a committee of intelligent and 
public-spirited citizens at the request of our Magistrates, made 
1
-P-A-G-E-184
186 : TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
at their July meeting, 1887. All teachers know the economy 
and general importance of having the same books throughout 
a county, or even a State. 
We have several new school-houses, and I am glad to note 
that every new house is a good one. Common school work is 
popular here. Ido hope our next Legislature will remodel our 
school laws, and put the whole thing on a practical working 
basis. For instance: A County Superintendent now is a mere 
figure-head, and the Directors are so numerous and have so lit- 
tle to do that they cannot keep the thing in mind at all. What 
would I suggest? Well, this for a start: Abolish the office of 
County Superintendent. Establish instead three County School 
Commissioners, who shall examine teachers, hold Institutes, 
decide all disputes about school matters, condemn old houses 
and sell them, build new ones, remove teachers and Directors 
for cause, lay off new districts, change district lines for school 
purposes, ete. Then let us have one Director for two districts. 
Now, if there are three schools in a district, each Director has 
a school. Let his work be prescribed, and compel him to do 
it. Pay him for it when he shows the Commissioners that it is 
done, and presents their order to the Trustee. Let us swap 
geology of Tennessee and elementary agriculture for natural 
philosophy and physiology. 
Pardon me for so much “suggestion,” but somebody ought 
to have power to do something, and then be responsible for not 
doing it. ‘ Business is business.” 
CHESTER COUNTY 
J.S. Wurrs, Superintenpent, Henderson. 
The scholastic year ending on the 30th of June, 1887, has 
been a year of unprecedented improvement in all of our school 
~ work in Chester County. The schools have been kept open 
longer, the teachers have been better and more promptly paid, 
than ever before. The State Teachers’ Institute held here has 
 
-P-A-G-E-185

deepened the interest of the people, and the two other Insti- 
tutes held at other places in the county have well permeated 
the people of the county with a zeal for more thorough and ef- 
fective work. 
Iam safe in saying that fifty per cent. of the teachers of ‘the 
county are now attending the high schools in this place that 
“they may better qualify themselves for the work of teaching. 
Superficial and incompetent teachers find great difficulty in get- 
ting certificates, and greater difficulty in getting contracts to 
teach. The only embarrassment is the want of funds. One- 
half of our districts became involved in debt on account of the 
great unwillingness to stop the schools when the funds were ex- 
hausted, and all of them are handicapped by reason of the 
meagerness of these revenues. May the wisdom of the people 
provide a speedy remedy for this evil. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
Wm. M. Carr, Superintenpent, Sandlick. 
I have the honor of transmitting to you my first annual report. 
The schools are all progressing very well in the educational 
work. ‘ 
My report is very incomplete, as this county has not been 
furnished with Registers. The Trustee has not made his tinan- 
cial report to me. Our County Court should levy an additional 
tax sufficient to run our schools at leust five months. When 
this is accomplished Claiborne will glitter as a bright star in 
the firmament of thought. 
I think it a public necessity that physiology and hygiene be 
taught in our public schools, as physical health is necessary to 
the highest mental and moral culture. 
We contemplate holding a Normal Institute next year, if 
possible, for the mutual benefit and instruction of teachers, sin- 
__ ¢erely hoping that by due care and labor on my part, aided by the
-P-A-G-E-186
188 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORY. 
co-operating work of patrons, teachers, and Directors, | may 
be enabled to report it a success, and that my general report 
may be more correct, encouraging, and complete than this one 
is. Hach scholar is receiving more than seventy cents. 
CLAY COUNTY. 
B. F. Bray, Superintenpent, Clementsville. 
I have the honor herewith to submit my annual report. It 
affords me pleasure to note the many changes for good 
that have been wrought in the schools of this county. A ma- 
jority of our teachers are persons of literary and scientific at- 
tainments, who have enlisted in the work, heart and soul, to 
maintain the dignity of the profession, and to advance the 
cause of education, regardless of, obstacles that may be en- 
countered to retard its progress. 
The people of this county are willing to appropriate their 
own labor and money to erect and furnish school-houses. 
Therefore, let the Directors use all of the public money for the 
exclusive benefit of the scholastic population. 
I have visited all of the schools in my county but three, and 
have been very explicit in explaining the duty of the students, 
Directors, and teachers under the school law, and on all ocea- 
sions insisted that it should be complied with. The people have 
met me at almost every school-house in the county, and well 
patronized our Associations and Institutes. 
T wish to say that I am, one who believes that the County 
Superintendent’s position is one of great importance; and when 
the County Court conferred this honor on me, I forthwith made 
myself well acquainted with the school law and the honorable 
State Superintendent’s instructions, and endeavored to strictly 
obey the same. I urged the importance of County Teachers’ 
Institutes, and held three, which were well attended by the 
teachers, who discussed the living school questions of the day,
-P-A-G-E-187
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. Y 189 
and adopted those modern and progressive methods that the 
welfare of the scholastic population demands. Hence, with a 
continuation of good Directors and efficient County Superin- 
tendents, our public schools will honor our people. , 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
James B. Womack, SuPERINTENDENT, Hillsboro. 
In submitting to you my annual report, it affords me much 
pleasure in stating that the public schools of my county for the 
present year have been a decided success. I have labored 
earnestly and constantly for the upbuilding of our public schools. 
I have met with many hindrances, but meeting every obstacle 
as best I could, I feel assured that. my efforts, supported as they 
have been by the best teachers of my county, will no doubt re- 
dound to the good of the young and rising generation, for our 
public schools are verging nearer and nearer, step by step, to 
that thoroughness and perfection which I hope ere long to see 
characterizing the grand old State of Tennessee. 
I have endeavored to impress upon the minds of the teachers 
of my county the duties and great responsibilities resting upon 
them, in having committed to their care the physical, moral, 
and mental training of their pupils. I think that Coffee County 
has some as wide-awake, working teachers as are anywhere 
to be found. They are adding honor and dignity to their pro- 
» fession and calling. Our school fund is not sufficient to support 
our schools as fully as they ought to be. I hope our County 
Court will supply the deficiency in the future, by levying an 
additional tax. 
I held a Teachers’ Normal at Manchester, opening June 20th, 
which continued two weeks. It was well attended by the ma- 
jority of the teachers of my county and by many visiting teach- 
ers from other counties. It was acknowledged by all to be the 
most interesting educational meeting ever held in the county. 
I am confident that all teachers attending went away feeling
-P-A-G-E-188
  190 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
better qualified for school work. I have been busily engaged 
visiting schools and holding Teachers’ Institutes in various local- 
ities of my county. 
My Institutes have been well attended, patrons, pupils, and 
teachers manifesting « great interest in them. I will be engaged 
for several weeks yet holding Institutes. While most of the. 
teachers of my county attend these Institutes, there are some 
who do not. I predict that in the near future many of those 
not attending will be stricken from the roll of teachers, on ac- 
count of their own neglect in failing to keep pace with the ad- 
vaneement and progress being gained among the teachers of 
my county. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
M. T. Moore, Suprrirenpent, Humboldt. 
In making this, my third annual report, it gives me satisfac- 
tion to say that the schools of Crockett County are at least 
twenty-five per cent. better than ever before, and the attendance 
much better than last year. We have a moderate school tax. 
Nearly all of the tax-payers are in favor of supporting public 
schools. : 
I have subjected the teachers to a rigid public examination, 
and have assured those who barely passed that without im- 
provement they would be denied a certificate next year. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
Sam C. Brown, Superintenvent, Crossville. 
My inclosed annual report for the year ending June 30th, 
1887, is by no means as complete as I desire it to be, owing to 
the fact that my predecessor did not furnish me with the nec- 
essary statistics. ‘

In response to a call for an educational meeting last April, — 
the Directors, teachers, and patrons met and unanimously 
adopted a uniform series of text-books, and 1 am proud to say 
that these books were used in most of the schools in the county. 
About thirty teachers attended a five days’ Institute in Cross- 
_ ville the last week in June. The programme consisted of class 
drills by the most experienced teachers during the day, and . 
public addresses and literary entertainments at night. his In- 
stitute was a decided success, and my visits to the schools this 
fall verify the statement that the best teachers attend and take 
pride in Institute work. 
I have held Teachers’ Institutes, in connection with educa- 
_. tional mass-meetings and basket picnics, every two weeks in — 
different portions of the county, since the beginning of the pres- 
ent scholastic year, and, as a consequence, a healthy educa- 
tional spirit pervades the entire county. 
In visiting the schools this fall I held educational mass-meet- 
ings at most of the school-houses, and endeavored to awaken 
those who send to school to a sense of their duty, as well as 
those who go to school, and I feel that much suecess has been ~ 
attained through this method. 
So far I have traveled four hundred and sixteen miles in the 
educational work this year, and delivered twenty-eight public 
addresses. 
Our schools are gradually growing better, but the want of 
financial aid and better school-houses greatly impedes our prog- 
ress. I would that our legislators, both State and national, 
would consider that the school-room is the nursery of our 
American republic.

DECATUR COUNTY. 
  
, SUPERINTENDENT, Decaturville. 
In making this my annual report, it affords me satisfaction to 
say that I think that the public schools of this county have 
done very well for the past year, considering the limited amount
-P-A-G-E-190

of school funds that we have with which to run so many 
schools. 
We have some live, energetic teachers, who are doing very 
good work, and who would do a great deal more if we had suf- 
ficent means to employ them for longer terms. I believe, as a 
rule, that the teachers who take a lively interest in Institute 
_ work are more progressive than those who do not. The great 
need of the schools is more funds. 
I will close this report with my acknowledgments to our 
County Trustee for his valuable aid, and for the promptness 
with which he furnishes his financial report. 
DeKALB COUNTY. 
A. J. Goopson, SuPERINTENDENT, Smithville. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my report for the year 
ending June the 30th, 1887. The schools of this county, with 
afew exceptions, have been doing good work. The teachers 
have taken greater interest in our Institutes than in any former 
year, and I am satisfied that great good has been accomplished 
by this means. i 
There are some things very detrimental to the cause of edu- 
cation in this county. The meagerness of our school fund 
compels the Directors to pay small salaries, which has caused 
much of our best talent to seek more remunerative fields. The 
lack of a uniform system of text-books is, perhaps, the greatest 
evil we have to contend with, although efforts are being made 
to remedy that evil. Our school facilitiés have been greatly 
improved since the beginning of last year. Our school-houses 
have, many of them, been renovated, and some two or three 
new ones built. Upon the whole, I believe the prospects are 
very good.

Ihave the honor to submit to you my third annual report. 
It is not correct in every particular, but it is as near so as I 
could get it. Our schools are doing very well. The attendance 
has been better this year than for several years. We have quite 
a number of teachers, both ladies and gentlemen, who will _ 
rank with the best teachers in the State, and the majority of 
them have educated themselves at their own expense. There 
has been less dissatisfaction generally this year among the 
patrons of the schools than ever before, and I think it is due to 
our superior grade of teachers. I have visited a great many of 
our schools, and will visit most all of them before they close. 
DYER COUNTY. 
D. E. McCorkun, SupeRiIntENDENT, Dyersburg. 
I have the honor of submitting herewith my statistical re- 
port for the school year ending June 3Uth, 1887. While it is 
not pretended that the report is nicely accurate in every part, 
still it is approximately correct, and shows substantially in all, 
and accurately in most, respects the status of the county schools. 
Until the District Directors become more thoroughly aroused to 
the importance of making prompt and correct reports of their 
respective districts, it cannot be hoped that the County Super- 
intendent will be able to escape the necessity of, in some in- 
stances, making estimates based upon the best data he has be- 
fore him. 
It is with great pride and gratitication that I point to the 
- increased attendance on our public schools of those listed as 
being entitled to the benefit of the public funds. Last year the 
average daily attendance was about twenty-five per cent. of the 
13
-P-A-G-E-192
    194 TENNESSEE SCHOOL ‘REPORT. 
scholastic population of the entire county, and but little over 
half the enrollment; this year the average daily attendance is 
about twenty-six per cent. of the entire population, and largely 
over half the enrollment. This increase has been steadily go- 
ing on ever since I have had the honor to superintend. the 
schools of the county. Iam not vain enough to flatter myself 
that any part of the credit is due to any efforts of mine; in 
fact, I am very certain that such is not the case, but that it is to 
be accredited to a general awakening of the people all over the 
country to the value and importance of education. But enough 
has not been achieved yet. We must never rest until the en- 
tire school population, whom the people pay taxes to educate, 
are enjoying the benefit of the people’s benefactions, and there- 
by give assurance to the tax-payers that their money is not 
thrown away, but will bring them a rich return in the way of 
an enlightened and useful citizenship. This is not the place, 
nor am I the person, to commence the agitation of new reforms, 
but allow me to say that the tax-paying public ought never to 
rest satisfied till the State makes some provision that will in- 
sure that their money is benefiting those they pay it out to 
benefit. : 
Among the most encouraging signs of progress is the fact 
that largely more of our teachers are graduates of first-class 
institutions of learning, and have given more attention to the 
science of pedagogy than formerly. When teachers study 
teaching as a science for the purpose of making it their life- 
work, and work at it for the love of the work, and with the 
view to aiding in the development of a nobler and better race 
of men and women, then will we find efficient and skilled work 
in the school-room. That such is the tendency now no one 
who has watched the trend of public sentiment for the past few 
years can doubt. 
Our people can boast of commendable progress in the way of 
school-buildings, as well asin other respects. Improved houses, 
built on modern plans, with improved methods of heating and 
ventilating, are taking the places of the old rude buildings that 
used to be found in our midst. Within the past two years one 
of the most elegant and complete college buildings in the State 
has been erected at Dyersburg, partly by the public fund and
-P-A-G-E-193
> COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 195 
partly by private subscriptions. It is now nearing completion, 
and will be the most perfectly ventilated building in the entire 
State, and will be heated by the famous Ruttau heating system. 
When finished this admirable structure will challenge compari- 
son with the best buildings to be found, North or South. We 
believe Dyer County to be on the high-road of progress, and it 
is our ambition to make her the banner school county in our 
loved State. 
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
N. 8. Antuony, SuPERINTENDENT. 
Inclosed you will find my partial report. It is my first, and 
Ihave had to learn the geography of the greater part of the 
county. Experience only will acquaint one with the difficul- 
» ties to be met in gathering statistics from which to make a 
report. 
I began.the work this year deeply enthused, and thought that 
success would be an easy task from the knowledge I had of 
some parts of the county; but I met an obstacle in the shape 
of organizing the Directors that I have never been able to sur- 
mount. Our schools have had mumps, whooping-cough, fever, 
ete., from beginning to end of school in a majority of the dis- . 
tricts, and ill-health has interfered with my work to some ex- 
tent; yet we claim success for our teachers and schools, and 
look for prosperity in the future.’ 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
Joun C. Wricut, SuperintenpEnt, Gibson. 
 Herewith I have the honor to transmit to you my first annual 
_ report of the public schools of Gibson County. Entering upon 
%
-P-A-G-E-194
196 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
the work last January, I have not had the opportunity to ac- 
complish as much as my love for the cause prompts me. I 
have been constantly at work, in various ways, to elevate the 
condition of our public schools. In the very beginning, through 
the generous liberality of our county papérs, I secured permis- 
sion to publish in their columns, free of charge, any thing 
which would be of interest or benefit to the public schools, 
such as monthly reports, essays, discussions, reports of Insti- 
tutes, and Institute work. The opportunity has been well im- 
proved, for something of interest has been published in one or 
all of the papers of the county every week. In several cases 
valuable papers read and discussed in our meetings have been 
published in full. 
My visitations to the schools have not been ‘as satisfactory 
as I desired, from the fact that I was compelled to be too hur- 
ried in making them, and then, in spite of my efforts, the schools 
in some of the districts closed before I could reach them. In 
these visits, after having witnessed the method of instruction 
aud the government of the teacher, I have generally taken 
charge of the schools, examined such classes as I saw fit, and, 
by this means, I have obtained a knowledge of the fitness, 
theory, and practice of the teacher. I find this is very popu- 
lar, especially in schools well governed and well taught. I 
have made about fifty such visits as these, and generally before 
leaving have addressed the school in such a way as to give en- 
couragement. About eight-tenths of the teachers of Gibson 
“are live and progressive, and in some instances I have been 
charmed beyond measure with the zeal, order, and work accom- 
plished. 
I commenced my Institute work the first of March, and have 
held about two per month ever since. My method has perhaps 
been a little different from most, Superintendents. JI have made 
out the programmes, assigned to teachers, without consultation, 
such work as I desired them to do, and have published the same 
in the three papers of the county at least one week before the 
Institute was held. -As a rule they have been well attended, 
_ both by the teachers and. people. My aim has been to have 
such work done in these Institutes as will prove beneficial and 
practical; and [I forfeit nothing in saying they have been emi-
-P-A-G-E-195
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 197 
nently successful. The necessity of continued work of this 
kind is apparent, from the fact that a majority of the teachers 
are either young men or young ladies, and need instruction in 
the theory and practice of teaching. Ihave used great exer- 
tion to have these meetings well attended, and they have been; 
but some of the teachers of the county have never attended 
them. What shall I do with them? There is no law to com- 
pel attendance, and, to insure continued success in these meet- 
ings, the law ought to be so amended as to give the County 
Superintendent the power to force attendance. 
Through the efforts of our former Superintendent, Mr. J. R. 
Deason, we adopted, five’ years ago, a uniform series of text- 
pooks. The contract having expired, I called the Directors in 
convention, and we have had a harmonious conclusion in this 
regard. This will save thousands of dollars to the people, out- 
side of enabling our teachers to classify their schools. Outside 
of this convention of Directors, we have four annual meetings 
of this body for the discussion and disposition of questions 
which may arise in the administration of schools. 
The work of grading and classifying the schools has made 
but little progress in this county. I find only three or four 
schools in which there exists any thing like a perfect grade; 
and I cannot see but that this will continue to exist as long as 
our schools are run for two or three months at a time, with a 
continual change of teachers. What Iam endeavoring to do 
is to organize for our teachers schools running eight or ten 
months, so as to give them continued employment, and thereby 
secure professional workers. When this is done we are on the 
road to success in grading our schools. Another thing, in my 
judgment, would aid us in this work—the forming of the 
county into scholastic districts, and allowing each district so 
formed the right to supplement, by taxation, the State and 
county fund. If our county were thrown into such districts, 
and the right of taxation guaranteed, I could easily establish, 
in various parts of it, public high schools running eight or ten 
months in the year. This would stop the multiplication of 
schools, and give more money to each house. We need and 
must have more high schools in our rural districts, and I will 
hail the day when the conditions of the law will be such as to
-P-A-G-E-196
  198 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
favor them. Our incorporated towns have the right to supple- 
ment the State and county funds, and they are doing so. Why 
deny our districts this right simply because they are not incor- 
porated bodies? The fact is, the law ought to make no differ- 
ence between an incorporated town and a scholastic district as 
regards the right of taxation for schools. The same right 
ought to be accorded to both. 
The Directors have, as a general rule, run their schools ac- 
cording to scholastic population. They have in most cases 
divided the civil districts into sub-districts, and kept the enumer- 
ation of each separate; and when an appropriation is declared 
by the Trustee of the county, they divide the money to each 
house according to scholastic population. This carries with it 
the tonviction of fairness and justice, and there is no law which 
I can find which will prevent them from pursuing this course. 
The precedent is given them by the State and county. <A few of 
our districts, however, give all their schools the same time, with- 
out regard to the enumeration of the schools. For myself, I 
cannot see that I can prevent them from pursuing either course; 
but I must confess that I am inclined to the first method, be- 
cause it has a tendency to prevent the multiplication of schools. 
The law ought to be amended so as to place this question be- 
yond dispute. 
Iam glad to report the colored schools on the road to suc- 
cess. Great good is being done. We have many competent 
and successful colored teachers in this county. I have so far 
held several Institutes for them, and with remarkable success. 
One thing I have noticed: they are teaching after the most im- 
proved methods. 
On the whole Iam much gratified with what has been done 
and is doing for the success of public education in Gibson. 
Our Superintendents have been men of intelligence, wide-awake, 
zealous, and progressive. Our County Court has been charac- 
terized by a generous liberality for her children. Many of our 
Directors are men of culture and refinement, and all of them 
about the best men we could secure for the position. Our 
- teachers are generally men and women of scholarly attainments, 
and are making impressions on the human mind more endur- 
_ ing than the monumental shaft. All we need is a good school
-P-A-G-E-197
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 199 
law, and a wise administration of the same, and we will soon 
hail the day when our physical, intellectual, and moral resources 
will be developed. Our hills, slopes, and fertile plains will 
yield bountifully to the hand of labor, directed by skill and 
intelligence; our mountains will empty their hidden treasures 
into the lap of commerce and industry; our school-houses and 
churches will send a stream of knowledge and Christian piety 
from one end of the nation to the other, and we will finally 
become a nation of true nobility, all covered with grandeur and 
glory. S 
GILES COUNTY. 
J. J. ZuccaRELLO, SUPERINTENDENT. 
In submitting my first annual report, I am happy to say that 
our public schools have been well attended this year. Nearly 
all of them received a visit from me, as you will see from my 
official report, and it was these visits which enabled me to get 
so full and accurate report, for our teachers and Directors have 
not yet sent in all their reports. In the annual round of visi- + 
tation, I was forced to visit several schools per day in order to 
get around before the term closed. I talked to most of the 
schools. The children in every school gave me most respectful 
attention, and seemed anxious to profit by any\good advice 
given them. 
Our County Institutes, held in June, were the most interest- 
ing that have been held in this county for several years. Both 
Institutes—white and colored—were well attended. Much of » 
the success of the white Institute is due to the efficiency of the 
President, Prof. Sam Abernathy, Seeretary Joe Roller, and the 
public addresses of Prof. Lampson and our most prominent 
speakers. 
The meagerness of our school fund compels the Directors to 
pay small salaries in many of the districts, consequently the 
good teachers are not found there. 
_ The lack of a uniform system of text-books is one of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
ke 
  200 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
greatest evils with which we have to contend, although efforts — 
are being made to remedy this evil. 
Another, and one of the greatest obstacles in the way, is the 
lack of suitable school-houses and apparatus, but considerable 
improvements have been made this year. Several new school- 
houses have been erected. : 
I will close by expressing my earnest desire that the next 
Legislature will make some important changes in the school 
law. Our Representatives are both school men, and if they can 
have the co-operation of that body they will do something for 
us. 
GRAINGER COUNTY. 
O. L. West, Superinrenpenr, Rutledge. 
I am glad to report our schools as doing well this year. The 
school interest seems to be gaining ground rapidly in this 
county. 
Our Normal Institute was a grand success this year, and 
seemed to infuse new life and energy into our teachers. 
We have adopted a uniform series of text-books in our 
schools, which we expect to be a great advantage. 
Our greatest difficulty is the lack of money. We only have 
money to run our schools on an average of three months each 
year. If our county could be induced to lay a special tax for 
school purposes suflicient to run our schools five months in the 
year at least, our schools would then be a success; yet, as it is, 
we are gaining some ground. 
GREENE COUNTY. 
W. T. Gurarin, SuperiIntenDEent, Greeneville. 
I hereby submit to you this my third annual report. While 
we have had much to encourage us during the past scholastic 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 201 
year there have been very many seeming difficulties with which 
the parents, the children, and the Greene County teachers have 
had to contend. Measles, mumps, and whooping-cough have 
been in many districts. The deep snow of December 4th, 1886, 
broke up many schools that would soon have closed. 
With all these discouragements we have gone bravely on, and 
now we enter upon another scholastic year under much more 
favorable circumstances, and with the determination, Deo volente, 
to do better work than has ever been done by school-teachers 
before in Greene County. The outlook in Greene County was 
never more encouraging. Most of our teachers are well quali- 
fied. We ought to have a better school fund. We need more 
school-houses, more teachers and better ones. It may not be 
out of place to say that, in my opinion, we need Federal aid, 
the passage of the Blair Bill, or some other bill that would 
Meet our wants. We can only patiently wait, and confidently 
expect better times. We will have the State Normal in Greene 
next year. 
HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
J. R. Cox, Superintendent, Morristown. 
_ In submitting my third annual report of the schools of Ham- 
blen County for the year ending June 30th, 1887, I beg to say 
that it is as nearly correct as is possible for me to maior if: Die 
rectors do not return their reports, nor teachers their abstracts. 
It is, therefore, impossible to make a report absolutely correct. 
Owing to changes in schools after the Superintendent’s visits, 
we cannot rely on the County Superintendent’s note-book for 
accuracy. 
Iam not in favor of putting any one to unnecessary trouble, 
but the law presumes and demands accuracy. Directors and 
teachers should, therefore, be forced to perform their respective 
duties. 
‘Though none of our schools are just what we aia most of 
them are in good condition, and the teachers doing good work.
-P-A-G-E-200
  202 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
Public sentiment is yielding to better judgment, and in some 
communities, where hitherto the public school was looked upon 
with contempt, now there are good schools, and the people 
look upon them with pride. 
In every community where there is a good working school 
there is a live, healthy public sentiment sustaining it; but 
where the school is “dead,” the entire school system is con- 
demned. It wants only time and perseverance to make our 
schools what they should be. 
Our Normal Institutes are considered indispensable. Nearly 
all our teachers attend all the better ones. Those who do not 
attend teach after the “twenty-years-ago” style; and it is in 
their communities that public sentiment is against us. 
Every teacher ought to be forced to attend one Normal Insti- 
tute each year, or to “step down and out;” and if he must be 
forced, the latter is preferable. 
An earnest attempt to adopt a uniform series of text-books 
for the county has been made, and, notwithstanding some op- 
position arising from mercenary considerations, we are succeed- 
ing reasonably well in placing them in the schools of the 
county. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
H. D. Hurraker, SuPERINTENDENT, Chattanooga. 
It affords me much pleasure to say that the schools of Ham- 
‘ilton County are steadily pressing their way to the front, and 
we hope ere long to see them take the lead. 
Several important changes have been made during the year, © 
each of which stands as a mile-stone indicating our path of 
progress. 
Directors, teachers, and parents are becoming more and more 
alive to the cause of education. 
_ The Hamilton County Teachers’ Institute, which meets 
_ monthly,has been more largely attended this year than ever be- 
fore. Since its organization in 1883 our schools have increased 
at least fifty per cent.     
   
   
-P-A-G-E-201
ve 
  COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 203 
We consider these educational revivals indispensable in the 
propagation of our common schools. The Institute for colored 
teachers, organized at the close of the State Normal, has also 
been largely attended. Regular attendance, at these meetings 
is a marked characteristic of the true teacher. 
In connection with the school work we publish the Southern 
Teacher, a sixteen-page monthly journal, which is sent to all 
school officers and teachers of the county, besides a general cir- 
culation among parents and students. Our aim in doing this is 
to inspire teachers to better work, encourage all our educational 
enterprises, and secure to our leaders in educational work the 
co-operation of intelligent citizens. 
We believe the following changes should be made in the 
school law: k f 
That Directors be required to report on or before the first of 
September. 
That the scholastic year and the office of County Superin- 
tendent close on the same day. 
That liberal provisions be made for State Normal Institutes 
and County Teachers’ Institutes. 
That teachers be required by law to attend the County Insti- 
tutes.

I hereby transmit my annual report, which is as near correct 
as I can possibly get it. Iam proud to state that the schools 
generally in this county are better than they have been for

think that the progress will be great in the next few years, with 
the interest at present manifested among our teachers and peo- 
_ ple.

204 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
W. B. Surru, Supermnrenpent, Savannah. 
I herewith present my first statistical report. Owing to the 
failure of our County Treasurer in August, 1886, the teachers 
who were engaged in summer schools were forced to hold their 
orders until after the April pro rata this year to get their pay, 
and some of them will have to wait until October. This cir- 
cumstance has greatly crippled our schools, and many districts 
have none this year. Quite a number of our best teachers have 
been forced to seek employment elsewhere. Still, at several 
important points in the county, a commendable zeal is being 
manifested, and the number of first-class private schools is in- 
creasing. In a number of districts the people are improving 
their school-houses and preparing them for winter schools. 
During the year I have formed a colored district at Sibley. They 
have erected an academy at a cost of $1,500, have purchased a 
$200 organ, have fifty patent desks, and are keeping up a _first- 
class school: They are bound to succeed. All honor to “our © 
brother in black!” 
The Directors of this county have adopted a uniform sys- 
tem of text-books for five years. “This will remove one of the 
greatest troubles in our schools. They have also prepared a 
system of grading, which, if carried out, I doubt not will add 
materially to the improvement of our schools and the advance- 
ment of pupils and teachers. 
I tind that heretofore Directors have not usually been quali- 
fied. Hence, many of them have failed to make a report, and 
have thus greatly embarrassed the Superintendent, and increased 
his labors. However, the machinery of our county system is 
becoming better adjusted and “oiled up,” and we hope it will 
run with greater exactness and smoothness in the future.

HENDERSON COUNTY. 
Roranp H. Tuory, Superintenpent, Lexington. 
I transmit herewith my first annual report. It is not as full 
and accurate as I desire it should be, but as nearly so as I can 
make it with the imperfect data at my command. 
Our schools are too short, and the crying need is more money 
and a greater interest in their behalf. ; 
Believing, as I do, that the public schools are the citadels of 
the liberty of a free people and the source of their glory, great- 
ness, and happiness, I earnestly hope that.they will receive 
that generous aid from those in authority commensurate with 
their needs, and that they will be so liberally aided with funds 
from some source, either State or national, that will enable us 
to have a five months’ winter school, and from two to three 
months’ summer sehool in every school-house in the State, and 
nothing short of this can adequately supply the needs and just 
demands of the children of the State, and I hope that every 
friend of education will labor in season and out of season to 
make this end attainable. 
We had a very interesting and profitable State Normal at 
Lexington, commencing June the 27th, and lasting one week. 
-It was conducted by the Hon. Frank M. Smith, State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, who opened the sessions of the 
Institute with an able and instructive address and an eloquent 
plea for national aid to education. As urgent official business 
called him to Nashville, he was forced to leave the following 
day, and left the further management of the Normal in the 
hands of Prof. M. R. Abernathy and Capt. S. A. Mynders, who 
successfully carried on the well-begun work, and -made it quite 
asuccess. There were something over one hundred teachers 
enrolled and in attendance, and the people also showed their 
appreciation of the labors and purposes of the Institute by fill- 
ing the large church-house with their presence. Itwas glad to 
notice Dr. W. H. H. MeMillan in attendance, the efficient County 
Superintendent of Decatur County, and also Professor Johnson, 
the County Superintendent of Carroll County.

  206 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORY. 
I have done my best, since my election as County Superin- 
tendent last January, to promote the cause of education in Hen- 
derson County. I have visited a great many schools during the 
summer, and have addressed hundreds of school children upon 
the importance and advantages of an education ; and in the 
meantime have tried to fit and better qualify myself for the 
work before me. I attended the State Teachers’ Association at 
Jackson this summer, and feel that I was greatly benefited by 
so doing. It was a very pleasant occasion, and I there heard 
discussed by able and experienced educators many subjects that 
are constantly brought to the attention of County Superintend- 
ents, and upon which they are almost daily called upon to pass 
judgment. 
I was somewhat surprised that there was not a larger number 
of County Superintendents present. Surely every one in West 
Tennessee would have attended had they known how helpful 
and pleasant these associations are. 
HENRY COUNTY. 
M. F. Ray, Superintenpent, Paris. 
Inclosed you will find my annual report, ending June 30th, 
1887. It is not as accurate as it should be, owing to the imper- 
fect and meager reports from Directors, and in some instances 
an entire failure to report at all. 
The schools of this county had nearly all closed when I came 
into office, which is another cause of animperfect report. You 
will see from my report that I visited’ only four schools.: I 
shall visit all the schools next year, that my report may be full 
and accurate. 
The State Normal held at Como was not very well attended, 
but all who did attend were delighted and benetited. TI held 
two more Institutes in other parts of the county, but failed to 
get a good attendance. The Reading Circle meets once a month. 
It has not been very successful.
-P-A-G-E-205

I shall do all in my power to arouse the teachers to a fuller 
‘sense of their duty, and also to raise the standard of teachers 
in this county. 
With the assistance of the Directors in the several districts, 
_I have succeeded in securing the adoption of a uniform system 
of text-books, a result which will contribute largely to the suc- 
cess of our schools. 
Henry County has been re-districted, and we now have sev- 
enty-two school-districts, with one school in each district. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
Grorce T. Grecory, SUPERINTENDENT, Hustburg. 
I herewith submit my first annual report to you, believing 
that our county is coming to the front. We have graded the 
public schools this year, and good results are visible. A fine 
college building has been erected in Waverly this year, at a cost 
of seven thousand five hundred dollars. More money is needed 
to make the public schools better. ‘ 
JAMES COUNTY. 
J. D. CAMPBELL, SUPERINTENDENT, Ooltewah. 
I have the honor of transmitting to you my annual report 
of the schools of James County for the scholastic year ending 
June 30th, 1887. 
  My report is as nearly correct as possible for me to make it, 
there being no law to compel teachers to furnish an abstract 
of schools at the time we need to make our report. Owing to 
the tardiness of one Director in making his report to me, I am 
tardy in making my report; and as there is no penalty for not    
    
-P-A-G-E-206

making the report before the 15th of September, they can rest 
easy. The Legislature ought to pass some law by which teach- 
ers and Directors can be forced to make their report at or be- 
fore a specified time, under a penalty sufficiently large that they 
would not forget this duty. This would give us more accurate 
statistics. ‘ 
Schools of this county are doing a splendid work this year. 
There seems to be a streak of public enterprise growing in the 
minds of the children; the teachers are beginning to realize 
more fully the fact that they are molding character for eternity ; 
_ the parents of this county are beginning to realize the great 
need of “higher education ’—not only for the satisfaction of 
knowing, but for the development of the mind—the discipline 
of the mind. We think this is due in part to the enthusiastic 
teachers of the county, who have the educational interest at 
heart, and who have assisted us in the educational enterprise of 
the county. The best help to the public schools I find is a 
“system of grades.” There were but one or two schools in 
the county that used them four months ago. Now there are 
about eighteen using them to good success. I have made this 
grading business a specialty, and must say it is a grand and al- 
most indispensable help in the public school work. 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
G. W. Hoxtsineer, Superintenpent, Dandridge. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my report for the year 
ending June 30th, 1887. This is my first report. I have been 
acting as County Superintendent of my county since last Jan- 
uary. It affords me pleasure to say to you that the schools of 
our county are in a prosperous condition. I held a Normal 
School last June, which was well attended, and I am pleased to 
see that the teachers who attended the Normal are practicing 
the improved methods which they learned there. Our county 
has adopted a uniform series of text-books, and the schools
-P-A-G-E-207
  COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 209 
are being graded in accordance with the graded course 
of study adopted by the Directors and Teachers’ Association of 
the county. There has been a great improvement made in our 
school work, and I hope to be able to show progress in the 
future. 
JOHNSON COUNTY. 
T. A. Wits,’ SupeRIntTENDENT, Mountain City. 
I herewith submit the annual report of the public schools of 
Johnson County for the scholastic year ending June 30th, 1887. 
Iam very much gratified to sdy that our teachers are working 
with zeal, and the schools are in a very prosperous condition. 
Tam also glad to state that the Directors of our county are be- 
coming to take more interest in the schools than formerly, em- 
ploying none but the best and, as far as is practicable, expe- 
rienced teachers. During last year the patrons of the schools 
seemed to be more aroused to their interests in regard to help- 
ing to build up and maintain their schools than at any period 
of the public school’s existence. May the Blair Bill become a 
law, furnishing us money for our impoverished school fund. 
KNOX COUNTY. 
James W. Savior, SuPERINTENDENT, Anoczville. 
I herewith submit my third annual report of the public 
schools of Knox County for the scholastic year ending June 
80th, 1887. Iam very much gratified to report that our schools 
are in a more prosperous condition than ever before in the his- 
tory of Knox County. There is a larger attendance in our 
schools, better order, and more interest than ever before. We 
have nearly $5,000 more than we had last year, by reason of an 
oe 14
-P-A-G-E-208
210 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
additional school tax levied by our honorable County Court; 
and since my last report our scholastic population has increased 
1,641, and the enrollment and daily attendance have likewise 
increased. 
Our public schools are continually growing in favor with pub- 
lic sentiment, and the old prejudicial cry that “ they are a hum- 
bug” has been swept away by the tide of progress. The chil- 
dren of the wealthy and poor classes work side by side with 
the kindest feeling for one another. 
I made one visit to every school in the county, and some I 
visited a second time, and made a talk in each school of fifteen 
or twenty minutes. When I found a school out of line—not 
measuring up to our standard—I spent a longer time in it, as- 
sisting the teacher to re-organize and work in harmony with 
our organized system. We held several Teachers’ Institutes, 
which were well attended, and with very satisfactory results. 
The best methods of conducting classes were practiced, dis- 
cussed, and adopted. The teachers in every instance expressed 
themselves as being benefited by mixing and exchanging ideas, 
and returned to their schools more efficient and enthusiastic. — 
I believe that no adage is truer than “As is the teacher, so will 
be the school.” Hence the importance of having live, compe- 
tent, and energetic teachers. 
In some of our districts, by a judicious expenditure of the 
school fund, the Directors run their schools seven months in 
the year. A few continue only four months. We need a fund 
sufficient to run them all eight or nine months. I have ascer- 
tained, by inquiry, that our people would assent more readily 
to an additional school tax than to a tax levied for any other 
purpose. 
One of the great barriers to our public schools has been the 
election of incompetent Directors, but this is gradually disap- 
pearing. On the first Thursday in last August the term of one 
Director in each civil district expired, and the peuple elected 
well qualified men in nearly every instance. 
Last July we held a very interesting and successful Normal 
School for three weeks. I was assisted by four of our most 
efficient and experienced teachers. The interest was up to a 
white heat from the time we opened until the Normal closed.
-P-A-G-E-209
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. LE 
We raised our standard, and endeavored to bring the teachers 
up to it, rather than bring the standard down to suit the teach- 
. ers. The second week was occupied by the State Normal, and 
our crowd was augmented by teachers coming in from the sur- 
rounding counties. Prof. T. C. Karns, who is well known to 
be one of the best Normal teachers in the State, gave a series 
of lectures on practical teaching, which were interesting and 
profitable beyond description; and I presume it would not be 
out of place to say that the presence and earnest work of our 
honorable State Superintendent fairly electrified the teachers, 
and inspired them with new zeal for their work. 
We have built four handsome frame school-houses during the 
past year, at a cost of $2,600, and furnished them with wall- 
maps, reading charts, grammar charts, improved desks, ete. 
Most all of our school property is in good condition. 
The Knoxville city schools are progressing admirably. With 
an efficient Superintendent and an excellent school board, they 
are making progress, and well merit the confidence the people 
repose in them. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY.. 
Mrs. L. A. Watkins, Supsrintenpent, Ripley. 
I herewith inclose report of Lauderdale County, beginning 
October Ist, 1886, and ending August 31st, 1887. I regret not 
being able to send in a more satisfactory report; also that I 
could not get it in by the first of the month. The time is too 
limited from the 15th of September to the 1st of October to 
have the scholastic census taken where Directors fail to make 
_ returns of the same by the 15th of September, and I therefore 
recommend that the time be changed and limited to the 15th of 
June. I am satisfied that it would greatly facilitate the school 
' interests in this county, from the fact that a majority of the 
public schools are taught here beginning July 1st and lasting 
about fifty days. 
I was only elected to the office of Superintendent on the Ist

  212 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
of April last, and found it impossible to give even an estimate 
of the number of pupils enrolled in the schools, and different 
branches of study, from the fact that some public schools were 
taught during the preceding winter, and the failure of many 
Directors to make reports to me at the close of schools—and 
there is no way to compel them to doso. In visiting the schools, 
I find many taught in meeting-houses or houses belonging to 
neighborhoods, and a few in houses belonging to the districts. 
Owing to illness with fever for five weeks during the last school 
term, I was only able to visit a limited number of schools, and 
those at a distance, which heretofore had received the least at- 
tention. Talso regret to report that many teachers find much 
difficulty in having parents procure suitable books for the ad- 
vancement of their children. I think it would greatly benefit 
the schools should the Directors visit them more frequently, and 
give them more attention than I find has generally been done. 
_ Aside from the cotton interest being a great disadvantage to 
the educational interest, I am under the impression that there 
is not the desired interest on the part of parents. Therefore, I 
am afraid that our county is behind educationally, and think a 
visit from yourself to our county quitedesirable. In the absence 
of specimens to illustrate and assist in the teaching of geol- 
ogy, I recommend that physiology be taught in its stead. Dur- 
ing the summer I held a teachers’ and Directors’ meeting, and 
adopted a series of text-books for use in the public schools. Is 
there any law or way to enforce their use? If there is, it would 
prove a great advantage to both teacher and pupil. In the 
schools I find many children the same degree advanced with 
as many different text-books, therefore it is impossible to class 
them. Should like you to send me full copy of school laws, 
_ since I have only amended school laws in pamphlet form.

LEWIS COUNTY. 
W.-M. Couurer, Superinrenpent, Newburg. 
I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report of 
the schools of Lewis County. The report is as nearly correct 
as I can make it from the papers in my office. The public 
schools in this county for the past year have done exceedingly 
well considering the limited amount of schoolfunds. We have 
live, energetic teachers, but we do not have sufficient funds to 
keep them regularly employed. This, of course, has a tendency 
to crush our teaching interest; our schools though, in the main, 
have been prosperous. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
G. A. Springer, Surerintenpent, Henryville. 
I herewith send you my first annual report as Superintend- 
ent of Lawrence County. Failure on the part of many of the 
teachers to return abstracts, and Directors and Trustees to make 
their reports, has delayed my report to you. This report is de- 
ficient to some extent, for I have not received all of the ab- 
stracts vet; but I think I can do better with my next annual 
report. 
Our schools are in a fair condition. Our teachers are im- 
proving in.their grade every year, and, as a consequence, our 
county is advancing in education. 
LINCOLN COUNTY. 
J. W. McDanigx, SuperintenpENnt, Boon’s Hill. 
    _ After considerable trouble and delay, I transmit my report for 
the year ending June 30th, 1887. It is not as accurate as I

would like to have it, as some of the Directors did not make 
full reports. The schools of the county were about as good as 
they were the previous year. We have a greater number of 
young teachers than were ever in the county at one time, twen- 
_ty-one per cent. of the teachers of the county having begun 
teaching during the year. Some of our best teachers have left 
the county, and others have given up the profession. 
The colored teachers are working hard to advance the cause 
of education, and to elevate the standard of morality of their 
schools. Their work is telling, for even a casual observer can 
see a marked improvement in almost every school. 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
Joun W. Hypen, SuPERINTENDENT,   
It affords me much pleasure to present to you my annual re- 
port of the public schools of Loudon County. Ihave had consid- 
erable trouble to get my statistics together from which to make 
my report. Teachers and Directors were slow about making 
. their reports tome. Ido not claim that my report is entirely 
correct; in fact, I do not think it correct, but it is as near so as 
I can make it under the circumstances. No abstracts of the 
schools taught in the fall of 1886 ever came into my possession, 
hence the schools of 1886 are not reported. My report is made 
only for two months taught this fall (1887)—viz.: For the months 
of August and September—and based solely upon these two 
months. If I understand the teachers abstracts correctly, it 
should be filled out at the close of the term, and filed with the 
County Superintendent, and when he makes his report, Octo- 
ber Ist, 1888, he should report the schools taught in the fall of 
1887. We had an excellent Normal Institute this summer, 
taught at Loudon, Tenn. It was in session for three weeks. 
Fifty-two teachers were in attendance. Prof. George W. Fox, 
of Loudon High School, was one of the teachers, and did much
-P-A-G-E-213
       
      COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 215 
to make the Normal Institute a success. We tried the District 
Institute plan this fall, but our success was not complete. 
I made an effort to raise the standard of scholarship of teach- 
ers this year. Some of my teachers found fault with me, espe- 
cially those who had been receiving the first grade and went 
back into the second grade. ‘ 
Our public schools sare doing a very good work in this 
county, but not the work they ought to do. There is too 
much indifference on the part of teachers, school officers, and 
patrons. We need more enthusiasm and zeal. We need to raise 
the standard of our teachers, and to have a compulsory school 
law. Our next annual Normal Institute is to be held at Phila- 
delphia, Tenn., commencing the first Monday in July, 1888, 
and continue in session four weeks. 
In conclusion, I must say that the school interest in Loudon 
County is slowly increasing. 
MACON COUNTY. 
S. N. Howser, Supertytenpent, Salt Lick. 
I herewith submit to you my first annual report. You will 
see that our enrollment has increased encouragingly; yet owing 
to the fact that the measles were epidemic in several parts of 
the county, the average attendance falls below that of 1885-’86. 
The present outlook is better than for some time before. Onur 
teachers are taking more pride in their profession, and conse- 
quently are trying to post themselves professionally. The work 
of building and furnishing school-houses goes on slowly. Sorry 
houses and short funds are two disadvantages that will be seri- 
ously in the way of the advancement of the public schools of 
_this county toward the usefulness for which they were destined. 
Iam heartily in favor of Federal aid and a compulsory law. IT 
think it would be decidedly to the advantage of the people of 
this county; also am in favor of re-enacting the law making it 
_ necessary for the Superintendent to sign warrants before teach-

ers can draw their pay, as by this means the Superintendents 
ean be able to get up their statistical report more accurately. I 
hope that Congress, at its next session, will see fit to grant us 
the aid so much needed for our public schools. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
Tuos. H. DRaku, SUPERINTENDENT, Jackson. 
Thave already sent you my statistical report, and now take 
‘pleasure in submitting a brief report relative to the general 
condition of the schools in our county. I have made it a point 
in my work to visit every school, and to learn what I could as 
to the manner of organization, character of school government, 
and methods of teaching. Many of our schools are being 
taught by well-qualified, faithful teachers, and in these all the 
requirements are fully met. I have been happily surprised at 
finding so many well-qualified teachers at work in the colored 
schools. Many of these came from Fisk University and other 
schools for the colored people located at Nashville, and they re- 
flect great credit on the institutions that have sent them out. 
Great good must result to the colored race from the salutary in- 
fluence thus created. Some neighborhoods still have very 
primitive teachers, and still more primitive houses in which the 
schools are taught. It is with pleasure, however, that I report 
an upward tendency both in the qualification of teachers and 
in the comfort and convenience of school-houses. 
Lhave made a talk to all the schools visited, offering words 
of encouragement to both teachers and pupils. I give them 
promise of a time when our country districts shall have a popu- 
lation as well educated as that of our towns and cities. I have 
' faith in the promise, if we do our duty, but if it should not be 
realized, the emulation will do us no harm. I recommend all 
our teachers to reject obsolete books and methods, to take the 
new books and apply the new methods. Many are doing this, 
and great improvement will necessarily result.

  COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. : 217 
MAURY COUNTY. 
J. A. Smiser, SuPERINTENDENT, Columbia. 
In assuming the duties of County Superintendent for this 
county I found school matters in rather a disorganized condi- 
tion, and consequently not that amount of efficiency which 
would warrant the best results. Not that we did not have, in a 
great measure, men who are interested in education, and quali- 
fied for the positions they hold, both as teachers and Directors 
of the school-districts, but rather because of a certain lack of 
organization and unity of purpose, which is so necessary to the 
attainment of the best results. And also from a failure on the + 
part of some to appreciate the full scope of their duties. Many 
of these scem to think that their full duty has been performed 
when they have attended to their individual schools or districts, 
and that they owe no allegiance to school organization as a 
whole. They seem to have little or no idea of the necessity 
of school reports, or of the attendance on Teachers’ Institutes, 
or other meetings which stimulate and encourage public educa- 
tion. Ihave found it often the case when there has been a ° 
Teachers’ Institute appointed for a certain place that the ap- 
pointment would have to be altogether withdrawn, on account 
of the lack of interest among the teachers; or I have been 
forced to carry it on with an attendance of some four or five 
teachers from the immediate vicinity, supplemented by a goodly 
supply of country lassies, who came out with many smiles and 
an abundance of white dresses to hear an elegant address which 
the County Superintendent never makes, but with very little 
idea of the true purpose and meaning of such conventions. I 
cannot, therefore, say that our attempts at Teachers’ Institutes 
have been at all successful, and I must therefore resort to some 
means to arouse an interest in these matters in the future. 
In many cases School Directors are strongly of the opinion 
that the full measure of their duties has been performed when 
they have employed teachers, and drawn all necessary warrants 
on the county treasury, with very decided opinions as regards 
the smallness of amounts allowed clerks of districts for taking
-P-A-G-E-216
TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
  the scholastic population. Very few of them send in true and 
perfect reports from their districts, and almost none act with 
the promptness necessary. ‘Yo instill into them somewhat of 
an idea of their duties in this regard, and to stimulate their en- 
ergies a little, we have organized a board, consisting of all the 
School Directors of the county. Each Director is an ex officio 
member of this board. It meets quarterly at the county seat. 
In the meetings we discuss questions relating to school interests, 
soliciting an expression of opinion from each member. We 
endeavor to give them information in regard to the law and the 
manner of conducting such business. We have had three very 
interesting and, I trust, profitable meetings of this board, and 
- will have another in January. We are indabted largely to Mr. 
‘S. M. Arnell for valuable assistance in this as well as other 
school work, he being a man of much experience in such 
things, and having been Superintendent of City Schools at this 
place for some years. We find it alittle hard to get attendance, 
and generally have to content ourselves with an attendance of 
twenty or twenty-five out of a possible seventy-five or eighty. 
I think it would be a wise provision if the Legislature would 
provide a small remuneration to School Directors for time used 
in this manner. 
In order to secure further success and unity of effort, we have 
thought it well to adopt a uniform system of text-books for the 
county. This was done in the Board of Directors. About one- 
third of the schools in the county are already using the books 
which were adopted. We hope to complete the list next year. 
I have found in the case of teachers who have applied for 
~ certificates some whom I did not at all consider competent for 
_ the position sought, and to these I have refused to issue certifi- 
cates. I have found others who did not come up to the full 
standard, whom I have allowed to continue teaching this term, 
but always with the warning that next year they would find it 
more difficult to obtain a certificate. In this promise they shall 
not be disappointed. 
There is needed some healthful legislation in regard to school 
matters, and the people need to be aroused to ihe necessity of 
electing good and efficient men as school officers. We need 
more money. Money! money! is the one thing needful. Not

to be wasted in extravagance, but to secure to each child a com- 
~ mon school education. 
As a whole, I think that we of Maury County are doing fairly 
well in comparison with other counties in the State, but still we 
are not doing what we ought to do. I speak plainly, because I 
think it best to recognize our deficiencies and to correct them. 
There is generally too great a disposition on the part of School 
Superintendents to give glowing reports of work that is being 
done in their counties, and thus create wrong impressions. I 
believe that the public school interest throughout the State is 
on rising ground, and that the time is not tar distant when it 
will prove an entire success. 
The State Conventiou of County Superintendents was a step 
from which much good will spring. I congratulate the State’ 
Superintendent on the amount of work he accomplished, and 
bids fair to accomplish. 
McMINN COUNTY. 
W. M. Tuomas, SuPERINTENDENT, Athens. 
In transmitting to you my annual report, it affords me much 
_ pleasure to note many changes for good that have been wrought. 
ns 
      
  in the schools of this county. The State and County Normal 
Institute, which was held in this county last June, did a great 
deal for our schools. The Normal Institute continued five days. 
It was conducted by Prof. M. R. M. Burke, of Chatata High 
School, and myself. Forty-three of the county teachers were 
in attendance, sixteen from other counties, and six County Su- 
perintendents from adjoining: counties. Many questions and 
theories pertaining to the school work were very ably discussed. 
The teachers’ monthly meetings, which are held in different 
parts of the county, add very materially to our success. An- 
other feature worthy of note is the improved condition of our 
houses. During the past year there have been six new frame 
houses erected and one log, which add greatly to our schools. 
It seems that a new era has dawned, “with fairer skies and 
j j
-P-A-G-E-218
: 220 : TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
brighter sun,” for education in our county. One omen is to see 
that our Directors have almost buried into oblivion the old fa- 
voritism system that has been such a drawback to our schools. 
It is really encouraging to be able to report that our Directors, 
with few exceptions, are employing the best teachers their lim- 
ited means will afford. 
It perhaps would do our colored teachers an injustice not to 
speak of the Institute which was held in Athens in July. The 
Institute continued three days, all of the colored teachers of 
the county being present—being fifteen. The Institute aroused 
new zeal among the colored teachers, and all went to their re- 
spective schools prepared to do better work. 
Now I am in favor of a few changes in the school law: 
First, re-enact the law requiring County Superintendents to ap- 
prove school warrants, ete. Second, enact a law that will give 
County Superintendents well-defined power to cause the school 
laws to be properly executed, leaving, however, his decision 
subject to an appeal to the State Superintendent. Third, enact 
a law fixing the compensation of the County Superintendent 
per capita on the scholastic population of his county. Fourth, 
enact a law having the school year end the 1st of January in- 
stead of June 30th. Fifth, enact a law requiring parents to 
send their children to school. 
McNAIRY COUNTY. 
Linpszy SaunpErs, SuPERINTENDENT, Purdy. 
T herewith submit my annual report of the condition of the 
public schools in McNairy County. Our schools have done well 
here this summer. The school funds were less than usual, caus- 
ing a reduction in teachers’ salaries near ten per cent., but no 
falling off in the work of teachers. A more self-sacrificing, 
noble. enthusiastic, and efficient corps of teachers cannot be 
‘found anywhere than we have. They are doing a noble work, 
and have done much to popularize our free school system in 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 221 
this county. We have several private schools, conducted by 
able teachers, that are doing much to elevate the standard in 
this county. They are a power in the land for good. It is im- 
possible for me to make more than an approximate statistical 
report of the condition of the schools here. Directors, in nearly 
every instance, have failed to report to me; also many teachers 
have failed to send in their abstracts. My report is made mainly 
from the diary I kept while visiting schools. 
Our County Court did a very foolish thing last January. 
The said Court divided the county into over one hundred sub- 
districts, ordering each sub-district to elect thrée Directors, 
making over three hundred in the county, which has been the 
cause of great confusion. I will venture to say twenty-five per 
cent. of this number can neither read nor write. Ithink the 
Court will be forced to rescind this order next January. 
I have begun holding a series of Institutes, which I will con- 
tinue through the fall and winter months. I am holding these 
Institutes monthly. Citizens as well as teachers are taking 
great interest in them. 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
J. L. Buckner, Superintenpent, Decatur. 
I herewith inclose my annual scholastic report for this county. 
Since the last annual report the schools of the county have 
been, in some respects, much improved. The county has 
adopted a uniform series of text-books, with which most of 
the schools have already supplied themselves, and others are 
making exchanges. i 
The County Normal held in July was well attended by the 
teachers of the county, and all seemed to be well satisfied with 
the results. Instructions were principally given by Prof. G. 
G. Williams. Teachers are laboring to improve themselves, 
and better work is expected in the future. We expect to hold 
a County Normal of two weeks next year. We hope our 
County Court will appropriate something for this purpose.

TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
  MONROE COUNTY. 
J. H. Lowry, Superinrenpent, Madisonville. 
I herewith transmit my first annual report. It is somewhat 
difficult to get up the report for the whole year, when my term — 
began in the middle of the year, and have the report perfectly 
correct, as it shouldbe. My schools are progressing very nicely. 
‘We had one house burned in May, with a loss of nearly $250. 
We are now erecting several houses, which will show in the 
next year’s report. 
You will see that our schools ran ninety-one days this year 
against eighty-four last year, an increase of seven days. 
- At a meeting of Directors and teachers on the first Monday 
in July, we appointed the following text-book committee for a 
term of two years: Profs. J. L. Backman, Sweetwater; J. C. 
Hicks, Madisonville; J. M. Maser, Eve Mills; J. M. Hicks, 
Tellico Plains; Teacher 8. B. Rose, Caringer. 
Tam willing to do what work I can for the promotion of the 
schools of Monroe County. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
J. Us Tyee, Supsrintrenpent, Palmyra. 
In compliance with the school law, I herewith submit my 
first annual report, also a copy of the order of the Quarterly 
Court, at its January term, in reference to the election of the 
Gane Superintendent, which will explain why I have not vis- 
ited the schools, and performed Other official work. 
Our Directors and teachers have generally been prompt in 
making their reports, and in the discharge of other duties. 
Not a district clerk failed to make his report, and a majority of 
the teachers returned their abstracts. These reports were, in 
the main, full and correct. Our schools are moving along —
-P-A-G-E-221
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 223 
smoothly and, generally speaking, satisfactorily. The enroll- 
ment is greater than ever before, though the attendance is not 
so good. Our Directors seem desirous of improving the schools 
in their respective districts, and are exercising more caution in 
employing teachers; indeed, some of them refuse to employ 
teachers holding second-grade certificates. I regard this as a 
very favorable omen indeed. While many of our teachers are 
earnest, efficient, and zealous in their work, candor compels 
me to say that there are some who seem contented to drag 
along in the old way, and teach merely for the money they can 
make. I-have been rather strict in my examinations, and 
while I have licensed some whose examinations were not en- 
tirely satisfactory, yet I have rejected many, and assured those ~ 
who barely passed that unless there was improvement. they 
would fail to get a certificate next time. As our examinations, 
as now conducted—one Saturday in every month being ap- 
pointed for this purpose—are often very unsatisfactory, both to 
the applicant and the County Superintendent, I would respect- 
fully recommend that County Superintendents be authorized to 
hold their. examinations during the month of July, and continu- 
ing from day to day, during the entire month if necessary, un- 
til every teacher in the county has been examined. By this 
method, I think, greater accuracy and uniformity in the grading 
of certificates would be secured, and a better knowledge of the 
competency and attainments of the applicant attained. 
I would respectfully recommend the following changes in the 
school law: That the Legislature enact a law adopting a uni- 
form system of text-books for five years; that a law be enacted 
- giving County Superintendents well-defined authority and pow- 
er to execute the school law, and requiring of them the per- 
formance of specific duties; that County Superintendents be 
authorized by statute to charge a fee of one dollar for examin- 
ing teachers. 
The following is a copy of the order of the Quarterly Court, 
at its January term, in reference to the election of County 
Superintendent : 
_ Esquire I. P. Howard moved that the salary of the County 
Superintendent be fixed at $500, and that he be required to de- 
vote his whole time to the duties of the office, and that he be
-P-A-G-E-222
  224 : TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
not allowed to charge any fee for examining and issuing certiti- 
cates to teachers. A vote was taken on this motion and lost. 
Ayes, 15; nays, 18. 
Esq. Finis Ewing then moved that the salary of the County 
Superintendent be fixed at $100, and that he be required to be 
at the court-house in Clarksville not less than one Saturday in 
every month, and that he be not allowed any tee for examining 
and issuing certificates to teachers. A vote by ayes and nays 
on this motion was taken and carried. 
While this last motion, as entered upon the minutes of the 
Court, does not specifically state that the County Superintend- 
ent be relieved from the duty of visiting the schools, yet it was 
so announced and understood that in consideration of the small 
salary fixed as his compensation he be not required to perform 
this duty. 
MORGAN COUNTY. 
J. M. Topp, Superrmrenpenr, Kismet. 
Therewith transmit my third annual report. It is not strictly 
correct, but ws nearly so as I could make it with the imperfect 
_ data at my command. However, I am glad¥to report that our 
schools are in a good, healthy, active condition,s-and seem to be 
doing better than in any previous year. 
OBION COUNTY. 
W. B. Stovatt, SupeRintenpent, Rives. 
I send herewith my third annual statistical report. It is im- 
perfect, much of it being necessarily approximate. It is ut- 
terly impossible to get teachers to return abstracts, the source 
from which I ought to get a large portion of my report.
-P-A-G-E-223
  COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 225 
Our schools are in first-rate condition. The State and County 
Institutes held in this county last summer did much in arousing 
the zeal and enthusiasm of teachers, as well as arming them 
with the latest and best methods. 
The County Teachers’ Association, which convenes monthly, 
has accomplished some good, and its influence is spreading rap- 
idly. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
R. N. Corres, Superinrenpent, Livingston. 
The common schools of this county, with few exceptions, 
have done well. Most of the teachers have had considerable 
experience as instructors. 
I have so far visited fifty-eight schools, and would have vis- 
ited the remaining seventeen but for the reason that they were 
suspended on. account of gathering fodder. I will perhaps visit) 
them yet. In visiting the schools, I have tried very hard to 
make a lodgment in the minds-of the students of the great 
necessity of an education, of honesty, industry, economy, per- 
_ severance, truthfulness, etc. I have tried to show them that it 
is to their interest to abandon the study of nonsense and foolery, 
and devote all their thoughts and ‘ideas to the study of such as 
is calculated to benefit and build them up, make of them good 
and useful citizens, so as to be of some benefit to themselves 
and others. 
I have tried to speak words of kindness and words of en- 
couragement both to students and instructors. 
The great effort, as I believe, to be made in our common 
schools, is to properly train and cultivate the minds of the 
young, not only in the sciences required to be taught in the 
common schools, but in all things that are calculated to carry 
them upward and onward, so as to fit and qualify them fora 
discharge of the many duties of life. 
Many of our school-houses in this county are unfit for school 
purposes. It appears that the people in some localities do not

_ take the interest they should in fitting up the houses and fur- 
_ nishing them so as to make them reasonably comfortable; yet 
I have a hope that there will be a change for the better. It 
usually takes time to accomplish matters of great importance. 
Iam not sure that my report is in all things correct, but be- 
lieve it approximates correctness. But few of the Directors have 
made their report, so I have to rely upon my own knowledge 
of such matters as are contained in my report. In visiting the 
schools and conferring with Directors and teachers, I gathered 
up all information practicable, and upon that information my 
report is mainly based. 
The schools of this county are not what they should be. 
They are not what we would haye them be. However, look- 
ing to all the surroundings, drawbacks, disadvantages, etc., I 
come to the conclusion that our common schools have been, and 
are yet, doing a good work. I have a hope, and believe, that 
many will be prepared for usefulness by the common schools. 
PERRY COUNTY. 
J. K. Hursrepiur, Superintenpent, Linden. 
My report—if report it may be called—is very imperfect in 
many respects. I hope to be pardoned, as I caught the measles 
from one of our teachers when holding examinations, which 
rendered me entirely unable to visit the schools. Teachers, not 
being urged as common to return their abstracts, almost made 
a failure. I have waited and worked to gather what report I 
now make. Our Trustee’s report is also a failure. I think our 
schools did as well as could have been expected, being deprived 
of my assistance, and having only about half enough money to 
continue as they should. I issued certificates to better teachers 
this yearthan common. We need better teachers, more money, 
and longer schools.

COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 227 
POLK COUNTY. 
W. O. Taytor, SupERInTENDENT, Benton. 
I herewith submit my first report—approximately correct— 
for the scholastic year ending June 80th, 1887. From the fail- 
ure of Directors to make full reports, I am forced to say ap- 
proximately correct. I find, upon examination, that the teach- 
ers have not been making full abstract reports, and in some — 
instances have failed to return their registers. The Directors 
have been dead to their duties and to the interest of common 
school work. 
Ithink there is a manifestation of a growing interest in the pub- 
lic schools of our county, not only on the part of the teachers, but 
the Directors and people generally seem to be stirred up con- 
siderably upon the subject of education. 
I held a Normal School of five days in July, in which Prof. 
M. R. M. Burke, principal of the Chatata High School, rendered 
me valuable assistance. The teachers of the county were well 
represented, and the continued good attendance of the town 
and surrounding country showed that the interest extended 
beyond the ranks of teachers. This was the first Normal School 
ever held in Pollx County, and it was a success beyond question. 
The teachers had their energies: greatly aroused, and carried 
this new zeal into their work. The great interest on the part 
of the teachers in this work was manifested by a unanimous 
vote to have a ten days’ Normal next year. 
We now have a uniform series of text-books adopted for the 
_ county for a period of five years, and the people are realizing 
the benefits of the same. 
Now, what we need is more money, so we will be able to run 
our schools longer, and, we might say, some legislation with 
reference to our school law, viz.: The passage of the bill intro- 
duced in the last General Assembly. 
All considered, I think our schools are in a much better con- 
dition than they have been.

    MENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
PUTNAM COUNTY. 
S. D. Upton, Superintenvent, Cookeville. 
I herewith transmit my first annual report of the schools of 
Putnam County. I have long delayed filing my report in order 
to make it as full as possible. I am proud to say that there is 
greater interest in the schools of Putnam County than has ever 
been known before. However, much remains to be done yet, 
and I hope that next year will bring a greater harvest of good 
results. I have at last procured the adoption of a uniform 
series of text-books for a period of five years. I had a three 
weeks’ Normal Institute for the training of teachers; organized- 
a County Educational Association, etc.; held three county teach- 
ers’ meetings. At all of these the teachers and people attend- 
ing were enthusiastically interested. Our teachers are endeav- 
oring to keep up with the advanced methods of instruction, and 
are reading educational journals more than ever before. 
Another sign of improvement is, better and larger houses are 
being built, and better wages being paid teachers. The outlook 
for the future is favorable. The schools have been very pros- 
perous during this year, but contagious diseases (mumps and 
whooping-cough) among children have kept many out of school 
in many sections of the county, so that the average daily attend- 
ance has been greatly reduced. I have run the schools all the 
same number of days inva given school-district. I think they 
should be equalized over the county. Some legislation ought 
to be had to increase the school fund. Want of funds is the 
great hindering cause to the public school system of Tennessee. 
ROANE COUNTY. 
S. W. Gags, Supurintenpent, Morris’ Gap. 
I herewith submit my annual report for this county. I have 
visited nearly all the schools in the county, spent about a half
-P-A-G-E-227

day with each, and done what I could to correct what I consid- 
ered wrong methods of instructing. The teachers who attended 
the State Institute, held at Rockwood, under your supervision, 
are doing much better work, other things being equal, than 
those who did not. The great deficiency in teaching seems to 
be in primary work. Our school-houses, in many parts of the 
county, are not suitable for school purposes. We need more 
school funds, both for building purposes and to lengthen our 
school terms. Our county is progressing both in buildings and 
in school work, but by no means as rapidly as it ought. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
J. E. Rovrin, Superinrenpent, Springfield. 
I have the honor to transmit herewith the annual report of 
our county for the school year ending June 30th, 1887. The 
‘report is as full and accurate as can possibly be made from the 
returns of the District Directors, and from notes taken during 
visitations to every part of the county. 
I conducted a Normal School of four weeks for white teach- 
ers in Springfield in July, in which some of our best teachers 
served gratuitously as instructors, and rendered most efficient 
aid. Fifteen young ladies and nine gentlemen of the class were 
licensed. 
The State Teachers’ Institute, held in Springfield, in which 
Capt. W. R. Garrett represented the State, embraced the first 
week in August. It was a means of much interest and profit 
to our teachers. 
During the remaining three weeks in August I conducted a 
Normal School for colored teachers in Springfield. Out of a 
class of twenty-one eighteen were licensed. 
From visitations to most of the schools of this county since 
the first of September, I find a greater number of pupils en- 
rolled than ever before. Our people appreciate more than ever
-P-A-G-E-228
   230. TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
our public schools. Our teachers are capable, energetic, and 
thoroughly interested in their work. 
The greatest drawbacks to the usefulness of our schools are 
irregular attendance and diversity of text-books. If we could 
have uniformity of text-books some of our schools would double 
the amount of good they are now doing. 
RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
James D. Netson, Superintenpent, Murfreesboro. 
I herewith submit my annual report of the public schools of 
Rutherford County. Jam very much gratified with the schools 
this year. With a few exceptions they are good, and moving 
on nicely. The majority of the Directors are working hard to 
improve and build up their schools, employing the best teachers, 
_ erecting good buildings, and furnishing them with the latest 
improved desks, while others are dragging along in the old chan- 
nel of times gone by some fifty years—dragging along in 
small log-houses, furnished with the slab benches, etc., employ- 
ing favorite teachers, who only want a few dollars to pay for 
some particular contract in regard to some real estate. This 
-elass of teachers is an injury to the progress of our schools. 
They never attend any of the school meetings or Institutes, while 
the up-to-time teachers are co-operating with me in all; among 
whom are Professors Powell, Cox, Overall, Thompson, Misses 
Jones, Dixie Hall, and others, to whom I am greatly indebted 
for my success. I held an Institute in June, continuing five 
days, with an attendance of thirty or forty daily. 
Since then I have had a meeting every two weeks in different 
parts of the county, having good success. I also held an In- 
stitute for the colored teachers of the county, continuing one 
week; the success of which depends greatly upon the work of 
_ Professors Carney, Daniel, McClelland, and Sublet, all colored. 
I trust you will rule in such a manner as to cut out the favor-

ite teachers, by requiring the examinations to be complete in 
all the branches taught in the public schools of this and all the 
other counties of the State. 
| 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
W. F. Les, Superinrenpent, Hughett. 
I have the honor of transmitting my annual report of the 
schools of Scott County for the scholastic, year ending June 
30th, 1887. 
_ It affords me great pleasure to report the improvements 
made, not only in the school-room, but in the erection and im- 
provement of school-houses, there being nearly fifty per cent. 
of enrollment in the county over that of last year. The grade 
of teachers is superior to that of last year. They have made 
a marked improvement in discipline, as well as in scholarship. 
The Directors are becoming more interested in the school 
work. They have.quit paying enormous prices to inferior 
teachers, and are looking up teachers that are posted in mod- 
ern teaching. Some of the Diréctors met last spring and 
adopted a series of text-books, to prevent the schools from be- 
ing thronged by different series of books. 
The majority of the teachers attended the Institutes held 
this summer. I notice the teachers who attend Institutes are 
alive and awake to their duty, while those who do not attend 
are not teaching, but simply keeping school for the money. 
We are calling for teachers who do not fear public and rigid 
examinations, and we hope the day is not far in the future when 
we will have none but the very best of teachers, and who are 
fully competent to discharge every duty enjoined upon them. 
The colored teachers of our county are doing a noble work 
’ for their race. 
The increased per cent. of attendance in the public schools 
over that of last year shows that the patrons have stopped their

  children from strolling over the farms, and put them to a place 
where duty has demanded them. 
T will close by saying that the Legislature should enact some 
law by which teachers, can be forced to return abstracts, so 
County Superintendents can be more accurate in reporting. 
SEVIER COUNTY., 
J. F. Saarp, Supermrenpent, Sevierville. 
I have the honor to submit to you my annual report. While 
we have not seen as much advancement in our schoois as we 
would like, we do insist that they are making a steady progress. 
This is due largely to our energetic teachers, who have the in- 
terest of the rising generation at heart. 
Our fifth annual Summer Normal was better attended this 
year than ever before. It did a great deal of good in awaken- 
ing an interest among our teachers. The Teachers’ Associa- 
tion meets monthly, and is well attended by friends of educa- 
tion. A greater interest has never been manifested in the’ 
schools before. Old Sevier is slowly but steadily coming to the 
front ranks. 
SHELBY COUNTY. 
W. L. Henperson, Superintenpent, Memphis. 
I have the honor of submitting this my annual report of the 
schools of Shelby County, Tennessee. Our financial condition 
is good, as our $8,844.51 balance on hand will show. I have 
steadily advised the Directors not to run in debt. The Direct- 3 
ors are awakening to their duty, husbanding the public school 
funds, and employing, in most instances, the best teachers with

first-grade certificates. The people are more careful to elect 
only thoroughly qualified-men for Directors. In punctuality, 
attendance, deportment, scholarship, enrollment, and the in- 
crease of popular appreciation this year is brighter than any. 
that has preceded it in the history of our Soiree 
Our scholastic population has increased 2,068 since last—en- 
rollment, including Memphis, 3,857—which shows very plainly 
that there is a deep interest felt by all. The people are more 
watchful of their educational interests than ever before, and, by 
-reason of this, have aided materially in pushing forward and — 
building up the educational interests of our county. 
The teachers being the main-spring of the public schools, I 
held two Normals—one at the Le Mayne Institute, in Memphis, 
for the colored teachers, and had advertised and sent out circu- 
lars for a County Normal at Arlington, when I was ordered by 
you to hold at the same time and place a State Normal. The 
colored Normal at Le Mayne was held in the Le Mayne build- 
ing, a very commodious and well-equipped college, with Prof. 
A. J. Steele as conductor, assisted by his corps of well-qualified 
teachers. There were one hundred in attendance. More thor- 
ough and enthusiastic work probably was never done in a col- 
ored Normal, In the name of the colored children of this 
county, [heartily thank Prof. A.J. Steele for the zeal and inter- 
est he exhibited in the Normal. At the close of the Normal I 
held a two days’ examination. 
The State Normal at Arlington was certainly unequaled by 
any Normal I ever attended—such enthusiasm, good feeling, 
earnest and zealous work, and, withal, so popular. Directors 
from all parts of the county were in attendance, and hundreds 
of citizens visited the Normal. At the close of the State Nor- 
mal I held a two days’ examination. 
Inclosed I send you a narrative report of the State Normal, 
also of the County Normal (colored). I take this opportunity 
to thank the Memphis Appeal for the great interest it takes in 
the public schools of the State, and especially for the interest 
- taken in the public schools of Shelby County. I also tender 
my thanks for the thorongh and scholarly reports published of 
the State Normal and the County Normal (colored). I have 
visited the schools throughout the county, and I am proud to

report all doing well. We need, in some districts, better school- 
houses, although we have many fine buildings tor the white 
and the colored, well provided with desks, wall maps, charts 
for different purposes, blackboards, ete.; many are graded 
schools with several rooms. There is a disposition among the 
Directors and teachers to consolidate and grade more of the 
schools. Iam a believer in outline and topic teaching, and for 
that purpose I am having the walls of each school-room fur- 
nished all round with blackboards. In a short time I will have 
in most of the schools charts—reading, writing, physiological, 
geological—wall maps, and outline maps, ete. 
There are teachers in this county who have no peer, gradu- 
ates of fine State Normals, that attend every summer the best 
summer Normals. I wish here to notice a few institutions of 
learning, the Trustees of which have interested or associated 
themselves with the public schools of this county. Bellevue 
Female College, at Collierville, on the Memphis and Charles- 
ton Railroad, twenty-three miles from Memphis. The buiid- 
ings are commodious and well supplied with all the appurten- 
ances from the primary to a complete collegiate course. Many 
of the pupils, after completing the common school curriculum, 
remain and take the college course. 
The Bartlett Normal School, at Bartlett, twelve miles from 
Memphis, on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, is a fine 
prick edifice, well supplied with all that appertains to a finished 
pedagogical training. Several teachers graduated there at the 
close of the last session. 
The Memphis District High School (Methodist), at Arling- 
ton, twenty-six miles from Memphis, on the Louisville & Nash- 
ville Railroad. This, too, is a finely located school, with brick 
buildings and all necessary apparatus. 
Kerrville Academy (Grangers), at Kerrville, twenty miles 
from Memphis, on the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad. 
‘ There are county public schools of high grade at German- 
, town, Brunswick, Raleigh, Chelsea, Caplesville, and Fort Pick- 
ering. “ 
_ Schools not connected with the county schools: Miss Anna 
Holden’s schools (Collierville), non-sectarian, enrollment about 
three hundred; Clara Conway, Institute and Jennie Higbee In- 
. ?
-P-A-G-E-233
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 235 
stitute, both non-sectarian, from five to six hundred each; St. 
Agnes and La Salette (Catholic); St. Mary’s, select (Episcopa- 
lian). There are many excellent private female schools in 
Memphis. Jones’ Memphis Institute and Rolf’s School, both 
male, and schools of high grade and largely patronized. There 
are other private male schools of note: Memphis Medical Col- 
lege, Memphis Law School, and several commercial colleges. 
Then, as to belles-lettres and the fine arts, probably no better or 
more liberal appreciation is to be found than in Memphis. 
Our Memphis city schools, than which none are better, are su- 
pervised by that plucky and indomitable educator, Charles A. 
Collier. 
At the rate we are moving we will soon be the blue-ribbon 
county of the United States. How could it be otherwise with 
such a State Superintendent at the helm to steer the ship of 
education? 
SMITH COUNTY. 
CAMPBELL CRUTCHFIELD, SUPERINTENDENT, Grant. 
Inclosed you will find my annual report. The interest in 
schools in this county is not what it should be, though it is

and hope to have them introduced soon. 
STEWART COUNTY.

time. The report is complete and correct, except as to the re-

ceipts by the County Trustee, who was unable to report “ amount 
on hand July Ist, 1886,” because he was not in office at that 
_ time, and his predecessor failed to make any report at all for 
- last year. 
I have held Teachers’ Institutes once a month during the 
school session, alternating at different points in the county. 
They were, in most instances, well attended, and resulted in 
good. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
8. A. MontcomEry, SUPERINTENDENT, Covington. 
T submit to you my first annual report, for the year 1887. I 
would have forwarded it sooner, but have been compelled to 
wait for reports from some of the district clerks. I think this 
trouble could be avoided if Directors were sufficiently com- 
pensated for their services. 
I am glad to be able to say that the schcols of our couuty 
have been quite prosperous for the last year, and there has been 
more interest manifested generally, than I have ever before 
known. 
I made my annual visitation in August, and found an able 
and energetic corps of teachers, both white and colored; and it 
seemed that all were conscientiously performing their duties. 
We have a Teachers’ Association of several years’ standing, 
and we find as it grows older it also grows better and its work- 
ings more perfect and beneficial. It has become such a factor 
with the teachers of the county that they consider it absolutely 
_ indispensable. 
Our County Court appropriated $100 last January for the 
purpose of holding a County Institute. Accordingly Capt. 
Garrett and Prof. Sims, of Nashville, were engaged to take 
charge of it; and they conducted it in such an able and elegant 
manner as to elicit: the praise and good will of every one. It — 
would be impossible to estimate its value to the teachers of the 
county: ' We hope to have another next year.

The school property of this county is not worth near as much 
as has been reported. There is not a school-house in the 
county that is worth over $50, except where they have been — 
_ built for a chureh and school-house. The one at Erwin, a 
brick, worth $500 or $600, was built for a school and Masonie 
hall. In fact, we have only a few school-houses fit for use.

238 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
M. Neap, Surerinrenpent, Leesburgh. 
The work of superintendence of the schools of my county 
came into my hands about twelve months since, when the regu- 
lar school sessions of the different districts were just opening 
for the autumn and winter’s work. For years previous to this 
time I had, in a general way, given some attention to the school 
interests of the county. So I was not an entire stranger to the 
character of work done in our schools. 
But now, having been brought into an official relation that 
necessitated special observation with regard to the teacher’s 
work in the school-room in different parts of the county, I was 
impressed with the thought that our schools, relatively speak- 
ing—that is, when viewed in relation to what they had 
been in the past—are doing good work. Better methods of 
teaching prevail, better interest among the pupils is visible, and 
better facilities for instruction are at the teacher’s hand. But, 
then, when we look at the same schools, in comparison with our 
own standard of excellence, in comparison with what we would 
‘like to see them become, we cannot fail to see their wants and 
deficiencies, and the need of special effort to elevate their char- 
acter. 
The most efficient means we have so far had for promoting 
the efficiency of the country school is the County Normal In- 
stitute, and the local or district Institutes. These have been 
held in the county for years. The former is held in the summer, 
and has usually continued in session from one to four weeks. 
The latter is held while the schools are in session—at 
different times and in different sections of the county. The 
same continues in session two days. I held five of these local 
Institutes during the last year. The live and most efficient 
teachers of the county were usually in attendance, and the 
work done was of an excellent character, and was attended 
with excellent results. I find, however, that the local Institute 
and the County Normal have, so far, failed to reach the entire 
teaching force of the county; and they will continue to fail to

do so until there is a legal requirement of teachers to attend 
these means and appliances set on foot for their improvement. 
I do not feel like imposing hard conditions upon teachers, 
but, in view of the transcendent importance of the work of 
teaching the young, I certainly think that a requirement of 
special preparation for the performance of such work is but 
reasonable, and a legal requirement or other means that will 
bring every teacher under the teaching and inspiration of the » 
Normal and Institute will be attended with good results. I 
think we are making substantial progress. 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
W. T. Davis, SUPERINTENDENT, Gleeson. 
I am four days late on account of the Trustee. 
Our county is on a boom in the school interest. Our Court 
gave us a 30 cents tax in January, and we will be able to run a 
six-months’ school in each district of the county next year. The 
teachers take more interest in Institute work than ever before, 
and the general school interest is on a steady increase in this 
county. 
WHITE COUNTY. 
W.N. Briuiinestey, SuPERINTENDENT, Cave. 
In compliance with the school law, I herewith submit this, 
my first report of White County schools. I have tried to be as 
accurate as possible in every particular, hence I hope the report 
is complete and satisfactory. Although I have been busily en- 
gaged in teaching for the past fourteen years in this county, 
yet I had visited but few of its schools till this year, conse- 
quently I am not at all prepared to compare their present with
-P-A-G-E-238
    240 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
_ their past ecndition, and say whether they are improving or 
not. I know we have some good schools, and we have others 
that are deficient in many respects. We have several good 
school-houses, but many that are out of repair, too small, need- 
ing better seats, more light and ventilation. School furniture 
is badly needed. Our schools are not well supplied with black- 
boards and globes; maps and charts are quite scarce. In some 
of our schools the worst needed piece of furniture is a better 
teacher; for while we have a few well-qualitied, wide-awake, 
progressive teachers, we have many who are somewhat deficient. 
We are keeping up a County Teachers’ Institute, which meets 
monthly, and is accomplishing much good, but we need a State 
Normal Institute of three or four weeks’ duration, held in our 
county, and are going to try very hard to get one next summer. 
Most of our teachers are reading school journals and works on 
teaching, ete., but some of them are far in the rear and making ~ 
no effort to advance. 
The public mind in our county is gradually developing in fa- 
vor of a higher standard of education. Five new frame school- 
houses have been built in this county during this year. Dibrell 
Normal Institute, a large and well-planned brick building, 
named in honor of Gen. G. G. Dibrell, of whom every White 
Countian is proud, is in process of construction, at Sparta, and 
will soon be finished. The people are beginning to demand 
better teachers; the Directors are taking more interest and giv- 
_ing’more attention to the schools than formerly. Our County 
Court levied some tax, but not enough to run our schools 
as long as they should—seventy-two days being the average 
length this year. Weare badly in need of more money from 
some source. This will make better teachers, better houses, 
desks, and apparatus, and will lead to more intelligent and 
better citizens. 
I have been in the school work until it is a part of my nature 
to feel a deep interest in the future welfare of the citizens of 
our State. 
Although the pay of a County Superintendent in this county 
is rather meager, yet I have visited all of our sixty-eight schools, 
except three that were stopped for “fodder” when I passed 
round. I have ‘talked’ to most of the schools in the county, 
  
-P-A-G-E-239
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 241 
and delivered a few “ public addresses.” The children in most of 
the schools gave me most respectful attention, and seemed anx- 
ious to profit by any good advice given them. <A careful visita- 
tion of the schools, together with the Institutes I have held, 
have been, in my opinion, of great advantage. In these visita- 
tions and Institutes, I have paid special attention to the in- 
struction of Directors and teachers in their various duties. 
I have subjected the teachers to a rigid public examination, 
and have assured those who barely passed that unless they im- 
prove they will be denied a certificate next year. Iam glad to 
report that public sentiment is beginning to demand more effi- 
cient teachers. I have done my very best to enthuse our teach- 
ers with a noble desire for learning and self-improvement, de- 
termined, as far as I was able and had opportunity, to build up 
out of our own county, a band of teachers who will come toa 
_higher standard of qualification, and will carry the people with 
them in perfecting their mutual education. 
I must not close this report without saying something about 
our private schools. Doyle College, Dibrell Normal Institute, 
Onward Seminary, and Shady Grove High School, all have 
good buildings, good facilities, and are doing excellent work in 
the great cause of education. They have ten months’ school in 
the year, and take in the public school in the fall term. 
Our two greatest needs are more money and a State Normal 
Institute. I sincerely hope that our next Legislature will no- 
tice the reports of the various committees at the Jackson State 
Teachers’ Association, and act accordingly. 
Thanking you for your visit to our county during our public 
examination of teachers, and for the very able address delivered 
to our teachers, I will close.

tical report on the public schools of Williamson County.

   242 TENNESSEE SCHOOL REPORT. 
The schools of this county are still improving. Most of 
them have been very well managed, and the results are fairly 
satisfactory. The county has a splendid corps .of teachers, 
_white and colored, who are doing all they possibly can to make 
the schools a success. My report shows an increase in enroll- 
ment and daily attendance, and there is a proportional increase 
in almost every other particular. I have visited most of the 
public schools of the county, and have been well pleased to find 
the school-houses in far better condition than ever before. 
Many of them have been supplied with good desks, black- 
boards, ete., and a‘number are now undergoing repairs. 
As a general thing the Directors of this county have been very 
well chosen, the people taking more interest in their selection 
than ever before; hence the men selected take more interest in 
~ the schools of their district, and are’ more careful in the selec- 
tion of teachers, visit the schools more often, and are trying 
hard to perform their whole duty. 
The Teachers’ Institute meets regularly each month, with a 
fair average of the best teachers of the county in attendance. 
Indeed, the Teachers’ Institute of this county is well established, 
and it is claimed by our best educators that the rapid improve- 
ment of the schools is due, in a great measure, to the influ- 
ence of the Teachers’ Institute. 
I held four days’ annual Institute for white teachers and 
four for colored teachers the first and second weeks in July, 
both of which were well attended by all the friends of public 
schools. 
My report shows more school money collected and disbursed 
than in any past year, also a small increase in the average salary 
of teachers. 
Our County Court stands nobly by our schools, increasing 
the tax from time to time till at present it is quite respectable. 
Every thing considered, the schools are improving much 
faster that the most sanguine had hoped for. : 
I have the following to suggest as changes in the school law: 
That physiology and algebra be taught instead geology and ele- 
ments of agriculture; that the County Court be given power 
to lay off school-districts, or to appoint commissioners to lay 
off the.counties into school-districts; that there be a law requir-
-P-A-G-E-241

ing the County Trustee to make monthly settlements of school 
fund, or that he be compelled by law to prorate the school 
fund at least quarterly. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
J. J. Barry, Superinrenpent, Lebanon. iV) ‘) 
Tam glad to be able to send an accurate us ari report, 
to you this year. 0 My 
Our summer Institute was good; though not so many teach: 24 
ers present, no less interest was taken than’ last year. There 14 
were one hundred teachers present, eighty-five of whom,were | ~ 
from our own county. Our teachers are, ae in their work, 
and are progressing rapidly. s 
The Directors are doing better and mote work. The people 
are taking more interest in education. Our schools opened bet- 
ter this fall than ever before, but the drought damaged them 
considerably. 
I must return my thanks to the ex-Superintendent, R. Me- 
Millan, for his kind assistance and favors tendered me. 
I have held only four Teachers’ Institutes this year. Great 
interest was manifested, both by teachers and patrons. Teach- 
ers attended from all over the county. I will hold other Insti- 
tutes during the season. The future looks flattering for the 
progress of education.

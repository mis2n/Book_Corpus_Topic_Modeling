REPORT 
Department or Pustic Instruction, 
Orricr oF STATE SUPERINTENDENT, 
Nasuvinin, Trenn., Dec. 15, 1892. 
      To His Excellency, John P. Buchanan, Governor of Tennessee: 
S1r—In compliance with the school-law, I have the honor to | 
submit the annual report of the Department of Public In- _ 
struction for the year ending June 30, 1892. : 
In collecting the statistics for the year, I have encountered, 
although to a less degree, the same difficulty which was pointed — 
out in the last annual report, and of which all my predecessors 
have complained—the difficulty of securing prompt and accurate 
reports from the county officers. The county reports of this 
year were more prompt, more complete, and more accurate than 
those of the preceding year; yet, the following quotation from 
the last annual report may be applied to the year just ended: 
“A majority of the County Superintendents have shown com- 
mendable zeal, and have promptly forwarded to this office ac- 
curate and complete reports. From a number of counties the 
reports were inaccurate and defective, and necessitated lengthy 
correspondence in order to procure the necessary corrections » 
and amendments. From some counties no reports at all could 
be obtained until after repeated and urgent appeals.” At length, 
however, after much delay, reports have been obtained from 
every county in the State, and with few exceptions, have been 
finally rendered complete and accurate. 
  The difficulty in the way of gathering prompt and accurate 
statistics is partly due to the defective provisions of the school- — 
law. The law is defective in several respects, but especially in 
permitting too great an interval to elapse between the close of 
the school-year and the time at which the report of the district 
clerix becomes due to the County Superintendent. The school- — 
       
-P-A-G-E-13
i 1 year closes June 30, and the district report is not due until 
September 15. 
There is no good reason for this delay, and it is a source of 
much negligence and inaccuracy. The County Superintendent 
_is not entitled to demand the reports-until the date fixed by law, 
and in the long and unnecessary interval of two and a half 
months, teachers have removed from the district, registers and 
records have been mislaid, and frequently no means are availa- 
_ble for supplying omissions or correcting errors. 
In the original law, the school-year ended August 31.of each 
year, and the report was required, as now, September 15, 
leaving an interval of fifteen days, which is sufficient time. 
‘When the law was amended, in 1881, so as to make the school: 
year end June 30, the date of making the district reports 
cought to have been changed to correspond. This date was, per- 
haps, left unchanged in order to have the scholastic enumeration 
included, which is taken in July. It is much better, however, 
to take the scholastic enumeration in June, not only to avoid 
ae the inconsistency of including an enumeration taken in July in 
an oflicial report for the year which purports to have ended in 
June previous, but also because the month of June affords bet- 
ter opportunities for taking the census, by reason of the fact 
that the schools are then in session. 
As the statutes now stand, the County Superintendents are 
powerless to enforce the law requiring reports from the districts, 
and are compelled to make estimates from the best sources 
within reach, instead of reporting accurate statistics. Unnec- 
_ essary delay and immense labor is thrown on the State officer in 
soliciting past-due reports, and in corresponding in reference to 
      incomplete reports and in correcting errors. 
I recommend that the laws be amended— 
1. To provide for taking the scholastic enumeration in the 
- month of June of each year. 
2. To provide that all district reports shall be made to the 
f County Superiatendents on or before July 15.
-P-A-G-E-14
esigros 
3. To provide that teachers shall make, direct to the County — 
Superintendents, duplicates of all reports required to be made 
to the District Directors. 
4. To provide that County Superintendents and County Trus- — 
tees shall report to the State Superintendent on or before Au- 
gust 1 of each year. 
5. To provide effective penalties for failure to make reports 
complete in all the items required by law—penalties whose.en- 
forcement shal] not depend upon the option of the school-officers, 
but shall be peremptory, and shall take effect by operas of — 
law. 
The operations of the public school system for the year end- 
ing June 30, 1892, are shown in the following summaries. 
‘When compared with the statistics of the year 1890, they show 
the growth of the system during the past two years:

Comparing the above summary with the statistics of the year 
1890, it is found that the scholastie population has changed, 
during the past two years: as follows: 
The white population has increased\14,119, a gain of 2.7 per 
cent.; the colored population has decreased 2,767, a loss of 1.6 
per cent.; the total population has increased 11,352, a gain of 
1.7 per cent.    
 
-P-A-G-E-15
Sas 
It thus appears that the white population is a little more than 
75 per cent. of the total, and the colored population a little less 
than 25 per cent. of the total.

A comparison of the above summary with the statistics of 
the year 1890 shows a marked and gratifying increase in the 
two important items of “enrollment” and “attendance” of 
‘pupils. The increase in the enrollment of white pupils during 
the past two years is 55,301, a gain of 17 per cent.; the increase 
in the enrollment of colored pupils is 12,102, a gain of nearly 
13 per cent.; the total enrollment shows an increase of 67,403, 
a gain of 16 per cent. 
The increase in “average daily attendance” is even more 
marked and gratifying, and is a. better test of the efliciency of 
the schools. The increase in the ‘average daily attendance” i y 
of white pupils is 39,316, a gain of more than 16 per cent.; the 
increase in the “average daily attendance” of colored pupils is 
13,402, a gain of more than 21 per cent.; the total increase in 
“average daily attendance” is 52,718, again of 18 per cent. 
It thus appears, that out of a total population of 1,767,518, 
the State has 487,507 enrolled in the public schools. Thus, the 
- public school enrollment is 28 per cent. of the total population.
-P-A-G-E-16
i 
In addition to this, there are 32,777 pupils in the private schools ; 
so that the entire school enrollment is 520,284, which is nearly 
30'per cent. of the total population. 
No test to which the public schools can be submitted could 
more clearly show their growing popularity and efficiency than 
the test of enrollment and attendance. It is a cause of congrat- 
  Ai 
ulation that the people of Tennessee have, during the past two 
years, enrolled 67,403 more children in the schools than they 
did two years ago, and that the average daily attendance has 
more than kept pace with the increased enrollment. No stronger — 
evidence could be adduced of the value of Teachers’ Institutes 
and Associations and other appliances of the public system. 
Their effect in stimulating teachers and school-officers to judi- 
cious and enlightened efforts, and in creating popular enthusi- 
asm, has had a better effect than the enactment of compulsory 
educational laws.

The above summary shows that of the 487,507 pupils eurolled 
in the schools of Tennessee, 479,066 were engaged in the study 
of orthography, only 8,441 omitting this branch of study. This 
does not. indicate that these pupils are all in primary grades. 
The study of orthography runs through the entire eight grades _ 479,066

In history of Tennessee, vocal music, and all the branches 
which follow these in the above summary, with the exception 
of elements of agriculture and geology of Tennessee, no pre- 
vious statistics have ever been gathered. 
‘These branches of study were added to the course by the last 
Legislature, and were introduced into the schools which began 
in July, 1891. Vocal music and elocution are optional.

The number of school-districts has increased since 1890 from 
2,582 to 2,745—an increase of 163. This increase is attributa- 
ble to the act of 1891; giving power to the County Court to 
create new school-districts, and to change the boundaries of ex-
-P-A-G-E-18
S17 ce 
isting districts. This act has given rise to so many difficult — 
legal questions, and has caused so much complaint, that it will 
be more fully discussed under the head of “School Districts.” 
The total number of public schools has increased from 6,934, 
in 1890, to 7,598, in 1892—a gain of 664. It may be doubted 
whether this is a favorable indication. There is a tendency in — 
many districts to establish too many schools. While it is nec- 
essary to establish a sufficient number of schools in order to 
provide for the convenience of pupils, yet, their unnecessary 
multiplication fritters away the school-fund, shortens the school- 
term, is a serious impediment to the employment of competent 
teachers, and impairs the efliciency of the schools. oi 
  The total number of primary schools in the districts is 6,898, — 
and of secondary schools is 577. Thus, the primary schools 
constitute ninety-two per cent., and the secondary schools eight 
per cent., of the total number of district schools. 
The increase in the number of teachers employed is 701. In 
the employment of white teachers the greater increase is in the 
employment of males, 339 more males being employed and 275 / 
more females. In the employment of colored teachers the main 
increase is in the employment of females, 77 more females being 
employed and 10 more males.

week, or twenty school-days in each school-month. The 
schools of the State lacked, on the average, four days of com- 
gpieting five school-months. 
The average cost of tuition per pupil per month is the same 
_as for the year 1890. 
The average compensation of teachers per month is thirty- 
nine cents less than for 1890. This is a small decrease since 
1890, and would not be, prima facie, a favorable indication. It 
is due, however, to the fact that more schools than ever before 
have employed assistant teachers. This indicates an improve- 
ment in school-organization; but since the assistants are often 
~ paid small salaries, it causes a decrease in the average compen- 
sation of teachers. 
The number of consolidated schools is 64 less than in 1890; 
the places of those discontinued being supplied, for the most 
_ part, by secondary schools. 
The certificates and diplomas were issued to pupils in accord- 
‘ ance with the law of 1891. The County Superintendents have 
been judicious in issuing them. They are serving a useful pur- 
" pose in retaining pupils in school, and in elevating the standard.

tinuance was 354 greater than the aggregate of 1890. Eleven 
counties have established regular courses of reading and study 
in connection with the County Institutes. Twenty-seven teach- 
ers’ circulating libraries have been established in the State, 
mostly during the past year. The work of the County Super- 
- intendents and teachers in making use of these agencies for im- 
provement cannot be too highly commended. The following 
extract from the report of the year ending June 30, 1891, ap- 
_ plies even more strongly to the work of the meat ending Jaue 
380, 1892: 
  “The Institute work of the year is highly creditable ‘to the 
_ County Superintendents and to the teachers, and, especially so, 
_ when it is remembered that this work is mainly voluntary, and, 
except in a few instances, is a tax upon the private incomes of 
_ the Superintendents and teachers, no provision for the expenses 
of County Institutes being made by the State or the county. 
It furnishes an example of enthusiasm and devotion to the pub- 
_ lic service which deserves public recognition and gratitude.” 
  The increased zeal and activity of the County Superintend- 
_ ents is further shown in the fact that 409 more schools were 
visited during the year than in 1890, and 302 more public ad- 
_ dresses were delivered by County Superintendents. The effect 
of the 3,538 addresses delivered by County Superintendents on 
_ educational subjects is a potent factor in increasing public inter- 
est in education. 
  : In studying the three remaining headings of the above sum- 
mary, viz., “Number of Applicants Examined,” “ Number of 
_ Teachers Licensed,’ and “Number of Certificates Issued,” it 
_ should be borne in mind that the ‘totals’? do not necessarily 
correspond. All teachers licensed are not examined—first-- 
grade certificates being renewable without examination, at the 
_ option of the County Superintendent. Many Superintendents 
renew first-grade certificates, upon proof that the holder hes 
been regular in attendance upon the Institutes. 
  The number of certificates issued is 150 greater than the 
_ number of teachers licensed. Many teachers hold two certifi-

ondary certificate. a

show an increase over the expenditures for similar purposes for 
the year 1890. é ~
-P-A-G-E-23

A very gratifying fact disclosed by the above summary is the 
increase in the amount paid to County Superintendents. The 
increase of $7,423.15 in the salaries of these officers, being an 
_ increase of thirty per cent. in two years, indicates unmistakably 
that public sentiment is beginning to place a higher value upon 
their services, and to demand the employment of competent 
officials at fair rates of remuneration. 
Under the head of receipts it will be noticed that an item 
has been introduced into this report showing the errors in the 
county reports. A column headed “To Error in County Re- 
ports” will be found in the statistical tables. This is rendered 
necessary in order to explain the discrepancy between the bal- 
ance which was reported on hand June 30, 1891, in the previous 
~ report, and the amount reported on hand July 1, 1891, in this 
report. Of course the report of the new year should begin 
with the same amount reported on hand at the close of the pre- 
vious year. This result, however, cannot be reached in the 
State report, unless every county reports correctly. The reports 
_ from a number of counties showed a discrepancy between the 
balance on hand at the close of the previous year, and the 
amount on hand at the beginning of the year for which this 
-'report is made. This discrepancy arose, in most instances, from 
an ‘error in the report of the previous year. So great an inter- 
val of time elapses between the close of the school-year, and 
the date at which the County Superintendent is required to 
report, and so much confusion is caused by the fact that the 
school-year and the fiscal year end at different dates, that a 
‘number of counties had been in the habit‘of extending their 
financial reports to include the fiscal year. This discrepancy 
_has been explained and corrected by all except the three counties 
+ shown in the financial tables. The total amount of this dis- 
crepancy is $3,236.10. When deducted from the balance re- 
ported on hand for the year ending June 30, 1891, $701,635.20, 
it shows the amount reported ou hand July 1, 1891, $698,399.10. 
The report of the previous year contained a typographical 
error of ten cents, which escaped notice in time for correction. 
The balance on hand was printed ae 635.30, whereas, it should 
haye been $701,635.20.

The above summary, as compared with the statistics of 1890, 
shows a decrease in the number of private schools of 113, and 
a decrease in the number of teachers employed of 155. There © 
is, however, a decided increase in the attendance—4,745 more 
pupils were enrolled than in 1890, and the average daily attend- 
ance is 2,807 greater. : , 
As pointed out. in previous reports, the statistics of private 
schools are not accurate. No reports can be obtained from 
them except through their courtesy. In cases where they neg- 
lect or refuse to report, the county officers are compelled uo 
make estimates. 
The decrease in the number of private schools, and the in- 
crease in the enrollment and attendance of pupils was alluded 
to in the previous report, and has continued to a more marked 
degree through the year just ended. Under the head of private 
schools are included many classes of schools. <A partial list of | 
them will be found in the appendix to this report. They range : 
from the kindergarten to the university, and include academies, — 
seminaries, colleges, preparatory schools, and special schools of 
various kinds. They were established by religious denomina- 
tions, by social or benevolent orders, by private donations, by — ; 
the combined liberality of communities, or by private enterprise. 
They are maintained partly by endowment funds, and partly by 
tuition fees. They are devoted to primary or secondary or 
higher education, or to female education, or to special educa- © 
tion, or to preparation for college, or to the education of the — 
colored people, ete. The last annual report of this department 
contains sketches descriptive of the character and history of 
these institutions, and their relations to the public school sys- 
tem, which it is unnecessary to repeat. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  as OY eS 
Among these institutions are many of a very high order of 
merit, whose national reputation attracts pupils from distant 
States. The year just ended has been the most prosperous in 
their history, and has brought them an increase in patronage 
even more marked than that noted in the report of the previous 
year.

In addition to the amount of $1,500 expended annually by 
the State for Teachers’ Institutes, the sum of $2,000 per annum 
has been donated to the State by the Peabody Board of Educa- 
tion for the past two years, and its administration has been 
placed in the hands of the State Superintendent, as is more fully 
set forth unfler the head of “ Institutes.” The administration 
of this joint fund of $3,500 per annum is shown in the Institute 
tables in the respective annual reports of 1891 and 1892. 
As will be seen from an analysis of the above summary, the 
main body of the annual expenses of the department, outside 
of salaries, is incurred in printing and distributing the sup- 
plies to the schools of the State. The law jwisely provides that 
all the enumeration blanks for taking the scholastic population, 
all the registers used in the public schools, all forms for reports 
from teachers to Directors, from Directors and County Trustees 
to the County Superintendent, all forms for the various reports 
sent to this office, all forms for contracts with teachers, all forms 
for warrants issued by Directors or County Superintendents, all 
record books used by school-officers throughout the State, in 
short, every species of blank form, record, or report used by 
any school-officer, shall be printed and distributed from this 
office. The law further requires that circulars of information, 
school-regulations, certificates for teachers, certificates and di- 
plomas for. pupils completing the course, compilations of the 
school-laws, reports, ete., shall likewise be printed and distrib- 
uted from this department.
-P-A-G-E-27
1961 
Thus, the expense of providing all the blank forms and 
records for the entire school-system, in all its details, in the 
school, the district, and the county, is borne by this department. 
This provision of law secures economy and uniformity. The 
supplies, being printed in large quantities, are obtained at less 
than half the cost for which they could be obtained in small 
quantities by the several districts and counties. This provision’ 
of law, in fact, is absolutely necessary. . Any attempt to have 
these focus pedal by the several districts or counties, besides 
adding greatly to the expense, would throw the whole school- 
system into utter confusion. It is, therefore, necessary that the 
State should make liberal provisions for the printing and distri-~ 
bution of school-forms and supplies from this office; and it is 
. certain that the cost of these supplies will annually increase 7 with the growth of our school-system. At present, the whole 
matter is left to the discretion of the State Superintendent. 
The nevessary expenses are paid upon his order out of the an- 
nual school-funds of the State and no limitations are placed 
upon his powers. There should be some limitation to this dis- 
cretion. 
No fund has come into the hands of the State Superintendent 
dnring the present term except the Institute Fund, and a small 
contingent fund of $32.50 arising from the sale of office furni- 
ture. The Institute Fund during the present term of office 
consisted of $3,000-appropriated by the State, and $4,000 con- 
tributed by the Peabody Board, making a fund of $7,000. 'The 
law provides no tribunal to audit the accounts for the dis- 
bursement of this fund. I request that this ‘matter be brought 
to the attention of the General Assembly, and that a committee 
be appointed to examine the accounts of this fund. 
I farther recommend that some provision of law be made for 
limiting the amount which may be paid out of the annual State 
school-fund upon the order of the State Superintendent, and 
that some tribunal be designated to whom he shall render an 
account of all public money that may come into his hands. 
I suggest, as a judicious measure of school-legislation, that 
' the powers of the State Board of Education be enlarged; that
-P-A-G-E-28
ees 
said board be authorized and required to audit the accounts of 
the Superintendent, and that all amounts ordered by him out 
‘of the school-funds shall be subject to the approval of the said 
board. i 
I further suggest that said Board be authorized to establish 
and maintain a system of Teachers’ Institutes, and a teachers’: 
course of reading and study, to be directed from the office of 
the State Superintendent, and to grant State diplomas to teach- 
ers completing this course of reading and study on the plan 
more fully set forth under the head of Institutes; and that for 
the purpose of meeting all expenses of the Department of Pub- 
lic Instruction, including salaries, printing, distribution of 
school-supplies, office expenses, and all other expenses of the 
department, and the maintenance of Institutes and teachers’ 
courses of reading and study, the said Board of Education shall 
have power to expend annually such sum as may be necessary 
out of the State annual school-fund. 
Conpitton oF Epuvation. 
In order to arrive at a general expression of sentiment from 
all portions of the State on ‘educational matters, the following 
questions were addressed to the several County Superintend- 
ents, and a blank form was provided for brief replies. ! The 
questions call for the opinions of the County Superintendents 
on the ‘Condition of Education” and for “Suggestions on 
Educational Matters:” 
I— Condition of Education in the County.

“Il.— Suggestions on Educational Matters. 
1. In your opinion, what improvement can be made in the law of 1891 grading 
the schools? 
2. What number of grades should be in the primary school? What number in 
the secondary schools? 
3. What branches of study should be either omitted from or added to the school- 
course? 
4, Please mention briefly any points in which you think the school-law needs 
amendment. 
The replies to the above questions present a picture of the 
opinions of the school-officers on the condition of education in 
the State, and on the reforms which, in their judgment, are 
needed : 
CONDITION OF EDUCATION. 
1. Is the general condition of education favorable? 
In reply to the above question, sixty-five counties answered 
“ Yes;” sixteen counties made replies indicating that the con- 
dition was generally favorable, but not entirely so; eleven coun- 
ties answered that the condition was not favorable. The re- 
maining four counties made no reply. 
2. Is the attendance satisfactory ? 
Forty-one counties replied “ No;” thirty-eight counties made 
conditional replies, indicating that the attendance was improv- 
ing, but not yet satisfactory ; thirteen counties expressed entire 
satisfaction with the attendance; four counties made no reply. 
3. Are the teachers interested in Institutes, reading nee; libra- 
ries, and other means of improvement ? 
2 Forty-two counties replied “ Yes;” eight counties replied 
“No;” forty-one counties made conditional replies, indicating - 
that some of the teachers were interested in such agencies, and 
others were not; five counties made no reply. » 
4. Do the Directors and citizens visit the schools 2 
  .
-P-A-G-E-30
— 29 — ‘ 
Twelve counties replied affirmatively; thirty-six counties 
replied negatively ; forty-two counties made conditional or par- 
tial replies; six counties made no reply. 
5. Do the Directors manifest interest in Institutes and teachers 
meetings ? 
Fifteen counties replied in the affirmative; six counties re- 
plied in the negative; seventy-two counties made conditional 
replies; three counties made no reply. 
6. Is there a teachers’ library and course of reading and study 
connected with the County Institute ? 
Eleven counties replied ‘“‘ Yes;” seventy-six counties replied 
«No;” six counties made replies that such agencies were in 
contemplation; three counties made no reply. 
7. How many teachers in the county have remained more than 
one term in the same school? ; 
To this question sixty-four counties made exact replies. The 
remaining thirty-two counties made approximate estimates or |” 
failed to reply. From the best information attainable, it ap- 
pears that about 2,177 teachers have remained more than one ; 
term in the same school, which is about twenty-five per cent. 
of the 8,612 teachers in the State. 
8. Are all the schools of the county graded according to law? 
Tf not, how many have failed to establish grades, and why? 
Twenty-three counties replied that all the schools are com- 
pletely graded; fifty-six counties replied that some of the 
schools are graded, or that all are partially graded; eleven 
counties replied that none of the schools are graded; six coun- 
ties made no reply. The counties reporting no schools graded, 
or only a portion graded, assigned various reasons for the fail- 
ure. Among these reasons may be noted: “ Lack of power to 
enforce the law,’ “lack of uniformity of text-books,”. “ fail- 
ure of County Court to provide for the publication of the 
grades established by the County Superintendent,” “short 
terms,” “lack of skill on the part of teachers,” etc.
-P-A-G-E-31
lL Oh as 
9. Do you think the instruction in the schools is satisfactory? Is 
it imeproving ? 
Fifteen counties report the instruction , “satisfactory ;”” 
_ twenty-two counties report it unsatisfactory; fifty-five counties 
reply conditionally, indicating that it is satisfactory in some 
schools, and not in others; four counties make no reply. 
In response to the second portion of the above question, the 
statements afford matter of congratulation. Eighty-eight 
counties report “decided improvement;” not a single county 
reports ““no improvement; ” six counties report partial improve- 
ment; two counties make no reply. 
10. Are. the school-funds satisfactorily and economically admin- 4 
istered ? 
Forty-five counties reply in the affirmative; nineteen counties 
reply emphatically “no;’ twenty-seven counties reply that the 
financial administration is faulty in some respects; five counties 
_ make no reply. 
It thus appears that the Superintendents of forty-six counties 
express more or less dissatisfaction with the financial manage- 
ment. 
2 SUGGESTIONS ON EDUCATIONAL MATTERS, 
1. In your opinion, what improvement can be made in the law of 
1891, grading the schools? 
Thirty counties express the opinion that the present law is 
satisfactory and sufficient; thirty-nine counties state that they 
have no suggestionto make; ten counties recommend that the 
law be amended to provide penalties for enforcing the grading ; 
twe counties recommend that a State programme be adopted 
for grading all the schools; one county recommends that sec- 
ondary schools be abolished; one county recommends that the 
law make provision for the publication of the plan of grading 
prescribed ky the County Superintendent; four éounties recom- 
mend that the law provide for county uniformity of text-books; 
seven counties recommend that the number of grades be in- 
‘creased ; one county suggests that the grading be left optional 
with each district; one county suggests that the law regulate
-P-A-G-E-32
Pn 
— 31.— ' 
the number of teachers to correspond with the grading and en- 
rollment of the school. 
2. What number of grades should be in primary schools? What 
number in secondary schools ? 
In the primary schools: Forty-seven counties favor five © 
grades; thirty-four counties make no suggestion; eleven coun- 
ties favor six grades; three counties favor seven grades; one 
county favors four grades. 
In secondary schools: Forty-five counties favor eight grades; 
thirty-four counties make no suggestion; six counties favor 
nine grades; seven counties favor ten grades; one county favors

Directors be paid for their services; three counties, that the 
term of office of County Superintendent be four years; one 
county, that the State Superintendent be appointed by the State 
Board of Education; one county, that second grade primary 
_ certificates for teachers be abolished; two counties, that the 
laws relating to grading schools be amended; five counties, 
that laws be enacted for the compulsory attendance of children ; 
one county, that any school shall be closed when the attendance 
falls below fifteen; one county, that Directors be prohibited 
from employing relatives as teachers; one county, that an age 
_ qualification be prescribed for teachers; three counties, that the 
powers of County Superintendents be increased; one county, 
that the law permitting subdistricts be repealed; one county, 
that the number of secondary schools be limited to one for each 
school-district ; two counties, that secondary schools be abol- 
ished; one county, that the curriculum of primary schools be 
- enlarged; one county, that the term of office of Directors be 
six years; one county, that a County Examining Board be
-P-A-G-E-34

created ; one county, that the powers of Directors be increased ; 
one county, that there be only one Director for each district; 
two counties, that Directors be elected in June, and County 
Superintendents at the July term of the County Courts; one 
county, that the County Superintendent be i hed an office 
in the. court- house. 
The above suggestions cover a wide range. Many of them 
are good, while some will not meet general approval. They 
show the trend of thought among the county officers, and will 
serve to call attention to many reforms that are needed. 
- 
GRADING THE SCHOOLS. 
The work of grading the schools, in accordance with the law 
of 1891, is steadily progressing. Twenty-three County Super- _ 
intendents report the schools of their respective counties com- 
pletely graded; fifty-six County Superintendents report their 
schools partially graded. There are seventeen counties which 
have not reported any effort to comply with the law. 
The schools have not, indeed, been graded in all the counties, 
and the grading has not been complete and thorough in all the 
schools that are reported as graded. Complete grading must 
be the work of time, and must be, to some extent, a growth. 
It is impossible, in one year, to pass from ungraded schools to 
an accurately graded system. The teachers and school-officers 
require time to become accustomed to the work. There are 
many obstacles to be overcome. Yet, under all the cireum- 
stances, the work of grading has progressed favorably. 
The effect thus far has been very beneficial to education. 
The effort at grading has done much to reform the chaotic 
management of the public schools. It has introduced some- 
what of system into the course of instruction, and into the 
classification of pupils. It has demonstrated to school-ofticers, 
to teachers, and to the people the value of a consecutive order 
of studies, and of the economy of time and labor. 
In our ungraded system, each school was a law to itself. The — 
teacher of each district school—frequently an inexperienced 
3 Supt. Pub. Instrue. 
    poke
-P-A-G-E-35
age 
teacher—was suddenly called upon to take charge of fifty or a 
hundred children in a mental relation more intimate than that 
of parent; to mold their characters, and to regulate the light 
which should flow into their minds. His first duty is to arrange 
a course of study, and to classify the pupils. Without knowl- 
. edge of child nature, or the laws of mental growth; without 
previous study of the problem, is he fitted for the task? The 
work must be done at once. There is no chart, compass, or 
precedent, not even a lex non scripta in the school itself, 
because the school has never been organized. What is the 
result? His school begins in chaos. He knows nothing of the 
consecutive order of studies, or of systematic school manage- 
ment. He has no guide, except the mandate of the law that 
certain enumerated branches of study shall be taught in the 
schools. Shall he be left to himself without aid from without, 
when the accumulated experience of all the educators of the 
world is within easy reach ? 
Why leave him to blunder on the threshold in the perform- 
ance of that task which/comes first, and requires the highest 
degree of professional skill and experience? He does not know 
how to prepare a course of study. Then prepare it for him. 
The law of 1891 wisely came to his rescue, and required the 
supervising officers to prepare a graded course of study, and to 
enforce the observance of this course in the public schools. 
The course of study is thus made uniform for all the schools 
of the county, and written regulations and directions are pro- 
vided for the guidance of every teacher in arranging the course 
of study and classifying the pupils. 
The law wisely left the execution of this provision in the 
hands of the County Superintendent, under the general regu- 
lations of the State Superintendent, thus giving the system at 
once stability and flexibility. 
There is nothing in the law that requires the grading to 
be rigid. We learn from the experience of others that the 
grading ought not to be absolutely inflexible. Even when the 
grading shall reach completeness, it should always be sufficiently 
elastic to conform to the dictates of common sense, and to the 
necessities of pupils, whose previous advancement has not been
-P-A-G-E-36
ete 
parallel, whose talents are unequal, and whose tastes are diverse. 
Allowance must also be made for the inequality of school-terms. 
    : 
After the system has been established for a few years, many 
of the difficulties now in the way will disappear. The pupils — 
of a county will grow up under a uniform system of schools, 
their advancement will be parallel, and the task of classifica- 
tion will be rendered much easier. 
The experience of one year has shown that in the counties 
where the schools have been graded, marked improvement has 
been made in the instruction. The graded district school has 
become more systematic, and partakes more of the nature of 
a permanent institution. It has a fixed and consecutive order 
of studies; it has stability within itself, and a change of teach- 
ers does not bring a revolution. The uniformity of the course 
of study throughout the county also enables those pupils who 
change from one school to another to continue their studies 
without a period of “naturalization” in the new school. 
Suconpary ScHoo.s. 
The secondary schools have served a useful purpose. They 
are suited to districts whose school-revenues are sufficient to 
provide for maintaining efficient primary schools for full terms, — 
and also for meeting the additional expense of giving instruc- 
tion in secondary branches, In such districts they have not 
only provided the means of secondary education, but have also 
served to elevate the standard of teaching in the primary 
schools. 
The statistics show that 577 secondary schools have been 
established in the State, which is 8 per cent. of the total num- 
ber of distriet schools. This indicates a healthy condition of 
public sentiment. The Directors and school-officers are wisely ~ 
building from the bottom, and are devoting their attention to 
perfecting the primary schools, as the foundation of education. © 
When the number of days taught in any district reaches an 
average of 150 days, and its primary schools are supplied with 
skillful and competent teachers, then attention should be de-,
-P-A-G-E-37
ones 
voted to building upon such a foundation the superstructure of 
a complete system of secondary education. In districts which 
have not laid such a foundation, the Directors should be 
cautious in establishing secondary schools. They should not 
permit secondary education to undermine primary education. 
The work of a secondary school cannot be performed by one 
teacher. The attempt to impose upon one teacher the task of 
teaching all the branches enumerated in the course of a second- 
ary school, must have the effect of destroying the efficiency of 
the instruction in the primary branches. No secondary school 
should ‘be established with less than two teachers. The best 
interests of education, in districts whose pecuniary resources 
‘are limited, demand that the efforts of school-officers and citi- 
zens shall be directed to increasing the school-term, to perfect- 
ing the primary schools, and to increasing the school-revenues, 
as preparatory steps to entering on the work of secondary 
education.   
Drawine in‘tHe Pusiic Scuoons. 
Although the State is not yet ready to introduce “Manual 
Training” as a compulsory branch, yet an important step may 
now be taken in this direction. Drawing may be added to the 
curriculum as an optional branch. This branch of training 
cannot now be made compulsory, for the reason that many of 
our teachers are not yet qualified to teach it. There is, how- 
ever, no good reason why the useful training which is imparted 
by practice in drawing should be excluded from the schools of 
those teachers who are competent to teach it, or even from the 
schools of those teachers who are not expert in teaching it. 
Even if thé teacher be not accomplished in drawing, many of 
the pupils have a natural talent for it. With a little tact on the 
-part of the teacher, and judicious guidance, a taste for drawing 
may be created and stimulated among the pupils, which will 
lead to good results. Let us make a beginning.

alcoholic stimulants and narcotics, and their effects upon the 
human system. This instruction should be given in connection 
with the study of physiology and hygiene, and should embrace 
not only the effects of alcoholic stimulants and narcotics upon 
the physical system, but also the effects of their intemperate use 
upon the mental and moral faculties. | 
Scuoont Districts. 
The act of 1891, granting power to the several County Courts 
to create new school-districts, and to change the boundaries be- 
tween existing districts, has given rise to many legal questions. 
The law contains no provision for establishing voting-places. 
In districts which do not contain the voting-place of the civil 
district, or in which there may be the voting-places of two civil 
districts, or in which the school-district is not co-extensive with 
the civil district, much confusion has been caused in the election 
of Directors. The difficulty cannot be cured, in many cases, 
by establishing a voting-place, unless the day for electing Di- 
rectors be also changed. When the school-district ceases to be 
identical with the civil district, the voter. may be required to 
vote, on the same day, at one place for School-directors, and at 
another place, several miles distant, for the county officers. 
Besides this, the judges and officers of the school-district elec- 
tion would be practically disfranchised, being compelled to re- 
main the whole day at the voting-place of the school-district. 
If the present law remains in force, it will be necessary to pro- 
vide for holding the elections of the school-districts on a differ- 
ent day from the general elections. The second Friday in June 
would be the most suitable time, so that the newly-elected Di- 
rectors could enter on office July 1, the beginning of the in- 
coming school- Hycals ‘ 
It will also be necessary for the law to be amended, so as to ~ 
make definite provision for the division of the school-funds 
between the old districts and the dissevered -portions. The 
present law is silent on this point, and it is a prolific source of 
controversy, and is likely to lead to much litigation. ¢ 
In addition to this, it would be wise to throw some limita- 
tions around the power of the court. At present, no notice is
-P-A-G-E-39
} 
required to be given to any one. A motion at the quarterly 
term of the court is made, and a new school-district springs 
into life without premonition, and with only one parent—like 
Minerva. The Directors are not safe in making contracts with 
teachers, or for building, or improvements, because they cannot 
know at what moment the district may be changed, and the 
funds on which they rely swept away from them. This law 
offers a serious impediment to the establishment and mainte- 
nance of permanent schools. It should be amended so as to pro- 
vide that any motion to change existing districts should require 
publication and notice, and cannot be acted on at the same 
term of the court at which it is proposed. It should further 
be amended, so as to provide that all changes made in the dis- . 
tricts by order or decree of the court, should go into effect at 
the beginning of the ensuing school-year, July 1st. 
Such limitations and provisions would relieve the present law 
_ of its most:objectionable features. It would, perhaps, be better 
to repeal the law entirely, and to enact that the civil district 
shall be the school-district, with suitable provisions with regard 
to the Directors and funds of districts affected by the change. 
Scnoot Funps. 
The fact that the Superintendents of forty-six counties ex- 
press dissatisfaction with the financial management, should 
_ cause our legislators to give the subject careful consideration. 
The interests of the State require a revision of the laws re- 
lating to the custody and distribution of school-funds. 
The general revenues are protected by the thorough system 
of State inspection and supervision, by means of which the 
Comptroller of the State is enabled to hold to strict account- 
ability all officers who have custody or control of public funds. 
This system of State inspection and supervision, however, does 
not extend to the protection of the school-funds. 
A rigid system of State inspection and supervision is needed 
for the protection of school-revenues. There is no good reason 
_ why it should have been omitted. This omission originated as 
follows:
-P-A-G-E-40
aoe 
The State levies for school-purposes a tax of $1 on each tax- 
able poll, and a tax of 1} mills on each dollar’s worth of prop- 
erty. This tax, however, although levied by the State, and in 
every sense of the word a State tax, does not come into the — 
State Treasury, but is retained in the county where collected, 
and is deposited in the hands of the County Trustee. It thus 
escapes the scrutiny of the State, and is subject to no inspection — 
or protection except such as may be imposed by the County 
Court. : 
The provision of law, requiring all school-funds to be kept 
separate and apart from other funds, was designed to protect 
the school-fund. This separation, while necessary and wise, 
has had the effect to separate it, also, from the general inspec- 
tion and scrutiny which guard other funds. 
The law, indeed, makes provision for reports from the County 
Trustee to the County Superintendent and to the Directors, but 
these provisions are vague, and totally inadequate to accom- 
plish the purpose of giving these officers power to protect the 
school-funds. 
The law does riot empower. or require the County Superin- 
tendent to do more than to receive a report, and transmit it to 
the State Superintendent. Thus, the only information provided 
by law to reach any State authority comes to the office of the — 
State Superintendent in the shape of_a report from the County 
Superintendent, who renders an account of the receipts and 
disbursements of a fund which does not pass through his hands, 
for which he is not responsible, and to inspect or control which 
he has no mandate of law, and no adequate powers. 
The law fails to specify definite dates on which the County 
Trustee shall make distribution of the funds in his hands be- 
tween the several school-districts. Thus, the time of distribu- 
tion is left to the option of the Trustee of each county, and 
there is no uniform rule. In some counties the distribution is 
made monthly, in others at irregular intervals. ‘ 
It is less the fault of school-officers than of the law, that it 
has become the custom for County Superintendents to pay com- 
paratively little attention to the financial management of the 
x
-P-A-G-E-41
40 
schools, regarding the financial management as outside their 
duties, and rather an interference with the officers, to whom the 
law seems to have confided this department of the schools. It 
must also be taken into the account that many of our best 
County Superintendents are not expert accountants, and have 
never devoted their thoughts to financial matters. Their atten- 
_ tion is engaged in scholastic work, in elevating the standard of 
teaching, and in the other professional duties of the office. 
The law prescribes for them no regular financial duties. By 
the time that experience forces upon their minds the necessity 
‘to go beyond the mandates of law to give attention and scrutiny 
to the financial management, the term of office expires, and a 
new Superintendent enters upon the same lessons of experience. 
It need not be a matter of surprise that the annual reports 
received at this office indicate an inaccuracy and vagueness in 
the financial management of many counties, which it is to be 
_ hoped extends no further than inexperience and lack of skill in 
making reports. 
I recommend that this subject be brought to the attention of 
the General Assembly, in order that such remedies may be pro- 
vided as the wisdom of the legislators may devise. 
Srate Instirures ror TeacuErs. 
The last annual report of this department contains a brief 
history of the Teachers’ Institutes of Tennessee since their 
introduction as agencies of the public school system in 1874. 
No agency of the system has done more to improve the schools 
or to develop public sentiment. 
The appropriation of $1,500 per annum made by the last 
General Assembly, aided by an appropriation of $2,000 per 
annum from the Peabody Education Fund, has placed in the 
hands of the State Superintendent a fund of $3,500 per annum 
for the support of Institutes for the years 1891 and 1892. In 
reporting the administration of this fund, it has been found 
best, for reasons previously assigned, to report each calendar 
year separately, instead of dividing the periods to correspond 
with the school-year. Thus, the annual report for the school- 
year ending June 30, 1891, included the report of all Institutes 
held during the calendar year 1891.
-P-A-G-E-42
: abou es 
During the year 1892, thirty-three State Institutes were held, 
covering a period of fifty-five weeks. Twenty-three of these 
Institutes were for white teachers, covering a period of thirty- 
seven weeks. Ten Institutes were held for colored teachers, 
covering a period of eighteen weeks. In many of the coun- 
ties, these Institutes were supplemented by County Institutes, 
continuing the work one or more weeks, and making the total 
period cover more than seventy weeks. 
The enrollment and other statistics are given in detail in the 
table of Institutes. (See Appendix.) ;

The plan of conducting the Institutes was, in general, similar 
to that described in the report of last year. The morning and 
afternoon exercises were devoted strictly to professional work, 
and were especially directed to illustrating methods of teach- 
ing, and to the grading and management of schools. The 
increased length of term of the Institutes, being, in most cases, 
_ two weeks, enabled the conductors to devote more time than 
heretofore to direct instruction in the subject-matter of the 
various branches of study. Especial attention was devoted to 
urging the teachers to form the habit of reading and study, 
with a view to self-improvement. 
The exercises at night were more general and popular in 
character, and were intended to reach public sentiment. Many 
of our most influential and eloquent citizens responded to the 
invitations of the conductors, and addressed the people at night 
_ and on Directors’ and Farmers’ Day on general educational 
topics.. The influence of these night exercises is potent in 
molding public sentiment. 
Hon. D. G. Godwin, Commissioner of Agriculture, and his 
assistants, continued, during the year 1892, to manifest the same 
interest in our Institute work which they showed during the 
previous year, and contributed much to make the exercises of 
Directors’ and Farmer’ Day valuable and interesting. 
During the past and preceding summers State Institutes have 
_ been held in each of the thirty-three Senatorial Districts, and 
in several districts, two Institutes have been held. As far as 
practicable the Institutes have been located at points removed 
from the railroads, and which had previously been neglected. 
At such points the attendance is necessarily local, and the en- 
rollment of teachers not so great as it would have been at more 
_aceessible places. Notwithstanding this fact, however, the en- 
rollment, as shown by the table, is largely in excess of the 
enrollment of any previous year. 
It is more than ever apparent that two classes of Institutes 
are needed. I therefore renew the recommendations made in 
my last report, urging the enactment of a law establishing a 
permanent Institute system, embracing two classes of Institutes,
-P-A-G-E-44
Ay 
  viz: (1) Popular Institutes, to be movable and of one week’s 
duration; (2) Three Central Institutes—one for each grand 
division of the State—to be strictly professional, and to be in~ 
session not less than one month in each year. 
In connection with these Central Institutes there should be 
a course of reading and study, somewhat on the plan of the 
University Extension. This course should be regulated by cor- 
respondence during the year. This correspondence could be 
conducted under the control ‘of one of our excellent universi- 
ties, designated by State authority, or it could be conducted 
directly from this office by employing a competent assistant to 
perform the work in accordance with the regulations of the 4 
faculty of the Central Institutes. 
The Central Institutes should be summer schools for the pur- 
pose of aiding the teachers who have pursued this course of 
study. These Institutes should hold their sessions in the sum- 
mer, and should conduct a course of instruction and reviews, 
‘covering the same ground as the teachers’ course of reading 
and study, and should, after such review, test the knowledge of 
applicants by examination, and should have power to confer 
State life diplomas, which should license the holder to teach 
in any school of the State. 
The sentiment among teachers is now ripe for such a move- 
ment, and it would do more than any plan which could be de- 
vised to elevate the standard among those teachers already in 
the field. : - 
Although it was not possible to put such a system into com- 
plete operation during the last summer, in the absence of proper 
legislation, a step was taken in that direction by locating three - 
Central Institutes—one at the Peabody Normal College, at — 
Nashville; one at the University of Tennessee, at Knoxville; 
and one at the South-western Baptist University, at Jackson. 
Each of these Central Institutes was placed under an able 
faculty, and did excellent work, although the term could not 
be made long enough to accomplish the best results. If these 
Central Institutes could be made permanent summer schools» 
and be supplemented by.a ‘system providing a teachers’ course
-P-A-G-E-45
N 
et ee 
of reading and study, with the power to confer life diplomas, 
they would accomplish the most valuable results. For a more 
detailed discussion of this point, I refer to the annual report for 
the year ending June 380, 1891, pages 61, 62. 
During the past two years, the Institutes have found a 
new field of usefulness, and have done an especially valuable 
work. The General Assembly, at its last session, enacted laws 
which placed in the hands of the supervising officers more 
power than had before been conferred on them, to regulate the 
- course of study in the schools. This law empowers the County 
Superintendents, under the general regulations of the State 
- Superintendent, to grade all the schools of the State. During 
the past school-year the schools have been partially graded, and 
the course of study greatly improved.. The Institutes have 
proved an invaluable aid in disseminating information among 
the teachers and school-officers for putting the system of grad- 
ing into operation. 
In selecting Institute conductors and instructors, those have 
been chosen who had practical experience in the grading of 
town and country schools. It gives me great pleasure to testify 
that the work committed to them was faithfully and skillfully 
performed. It is generally conceded that the Institute work of 
1892 was the most practical, the most technical, and the most 
useful Institute work which has ever been done in the State. 
The character of this work is set forth more fully in the ex- 
tracts from the réports of Institute conductors. (See Appendix.) 
The results attained are largely due to the aid extended by the 
Peabody Education Fund, not only in the liberal appropriation 
of money, but also in the wise suggestions of the general agent 
of the Board. 
The Institutes for the year 1892 were maintained by a joint 
fund, composed of the balance left over from the previous year, 
$1,177.20, the State appropriation for 1892, $1,500, and the ap- 
propriation from the Peabody Education Fund, $2, 000; making 
a total fund of $4,677.20. The disbursement of this fund is 
shown in the financial summary. (See Appendix.)

{ CoMPILATION OF THE SCHOOL-LAWS. 
A pamphlet of 40 pages was issued from this department in — 
August, 1892, entitled “ Public School Laws of Tennessee, — 
together with Leading Decisions’ of the Supreme Court, and 
Explanatory Notes.” The following extract from the preface 
explains its character and purpose: 
“The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is required 
by law ‘to have printed and distributed’ . . . ‘as many 
copies of the school-laws as may be necessary,’ ete. 
“Tn performance of this duty, the following compilation of 
the school-laws has been prepared for the use of school-oflicers, 
teachers, members of the County Court, and others who may 
have official relations with the public school system. 
“This compilation is intended to accomplish two purposes: 
“1. To serve as a manual of school-laws now in force, giving 
the law in its present form, using the language of the statutes 
as amended by legislation, and construed by the Supreme 
Court. ‘ 
“2. To serve as a reference book for tracing, the successive 
changes of school legislation from the enactment of the public 
school law, March 15, 1873, to the present time.

Strate Epucatronan Assocrations. 
The teachers and school-officers of the State have organized 
three State educational associations—viz.: The State Teachers’ 
Association, organized in 1867; The Association of Public 
School Officers, organized in 1888, and The Tennessee Associa- 
tion of Schools and Colleges, organized in 1888. These associ- 
ations are all voluntary, but are largely attended from all por- 
tions of the State, and have done valuable work in the interests 
of education. It has been the custom of this department to 
publish their proceedings in the annual report. These proceed- 
ings, including the reports of committees on important educa- 
tional topics, the papers of specialists, the resolutions of the as- 
sociations, etc., present the current educational thought of the 
State, and are very valuable. It is to be regretted that the full 
report of the proceedings of these associations are excluded 
from this report under the following resolution of the General 
Assembly : 
Be it further resolved, That the above reports [all,State official reports] shall 
consist of thé reports of the office proper to the General Assembly, to be bound in 
paper, and not to exceed in extent three hundred printed pages, and shall be the 
same type as heretofore. 
In obedience to this resolution, the full and detailed reports. 
are omitted from the Appendix. The following brief sketches 
will convey some idea of the work of these associations: 
TENNESSEE ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. 
This association met at the Peabody Normal College, in Nash- 
ville, in 1892. This body is composed of representatives of the 
principal colleges and preparatory schools. Its attention is es- 
pecially devoted to questions connected with higher education, 
yet its discussions cover the whole field of education. Although 
a comparatively small body, the eminence and ability of its 
_ members give weight to its deliberations. The course in En- 
_glish, prepared by a committee of this association, and published

in the last annual report of this department, has been very use- 
ful to the teachers in the public schools. 
THE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICERS. 
The following sketch of the proceedings of this body, 
abridged from the Southern Teacher, conveys some idea of the

C. D. Elliott. Governor Buchanan delivered the address of welcome, and Super- 
intendent Huffaker, of Hamilton County, responded. Next came the annual 
address of the President by Chancellor W. H. Payne. : 
Superintendent Huffaker moved that a Committee on Resolutions be appointed, 
to whom all resolutions be referred. The motion prevailed, and the President 
announced the committee as follows: H. D. Huffaker, Chattanooga; Miss Nellie ~ 
O'Donnell, Memphis; Hon. Thos. H. Paine, Jackson; W. E. Stephens, Spring City; 
and A. S. Abernathy, Pulaski.

Then came the roll-call by counties and three-minute responses by the repre- 
sentatives. 
In the afternoon no regular session was held. = he various committees met and

The report of the Committee on “Should there be a Law Creating County Boards 
of Education? If so, Define their Duties and Powers,” was fully discussed, and 
_ finally adopted, as follows: 
“We do not think that a County Board of Education should be created, and 
offer the following reasons: 
“]. We believe that the present School-officers can carry out the duties that 
would devolve upon this board 
“2. We believe that it would be impracticable, expensive, and .inoperative: 
(a) impracticable, because it would be difficult to get a quorum when needed; (b) 
expensive, because the school-board would prove inefficient unless well paid, and, 
if so paid, would create too much expense; (c) inoperative, because of probable 
disagreement and incompetency, and want of independent, necessary duties.”

State Epucatrronau Insrirvtions. 
The State has two institutions for collegiate instruction, which 
are well equipped and enjoy high reputation. These institu- 
tions are the State University, at Knoxville, and the Peabody 
Normal College, at Nashville. In addition to these, the State 
maintains, in whole or in part, four other institutions, which 
are partly educational and partly charitable, viz.: The “Ten- 
nessee School for the Blind,” at Nashville; the “Institution 
for the Deaf and Dumb,” at Knoxville; the “ Tennessee Indus- 
trial School,” at Nashville; and the “ Watkins Institute,” at 
Nashville. 
The biennial reports of these institutions show that the year 
just ended has been the most prosperous year in their histories.

  It has been the custom to publish these reports in full in the 
Appendix to the report of this department. The above cited — 
resolution of the General Assembly renders it necessary to — 
omit the detailed reports of the several institutions. The fol- 
lowing synopses, however, will convey an idea of their work: 
  UNVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
  The biennial report of the Trustees shows that the State 
University has just completed another prosperous year of its 
history. The past two years have witnessed an addition to the 
income of the University, and an improvement in its buildings _ 
and facilities. 
Among material improvements may be mentioned the com- 
pletion of Science Hall, commenced in 1890; the erection of a 
building for a gymnasium and for the use of the Young Men’s 
Christian Association of the University; the complete remod- 
eling and refurnishing of the academic building known as 
South College, and the erection of two additional houses for 
professors. , 
Science Hall is an imposing structure of brick and stone, four 
stories in height, having an area of 30,000 square feet of floor 
space, besides a large basement. It is provided with all mod- — 
ern appliances for lighting, heating, and ventilation, and with — 
complete and tea apparatus for instruction in the several 2 
departments of science. 
The Young Men’s Christian Association building is a sub- — 
stantial and handsome structure. It is considered by those who - 
have seen many such buildings to be a model of its kind. In ~ 
addition to the usual offices, it contains a parlor, reading-rooms, 
an assembly-room, and a large gymnasium fitted with the best 
- apparatus, in connection with which are baths, lockers, etc.. — 
This building, iu all its departments, is open to all students of 
the university. An instructor is provided by the Association 
to direct the students in physical culture. f 
The attendance of students has béen as follows during the —

“The teachers’ course does not begin until the second term. 
“When we consider that this only represents the attendance for 
the first term of the current session, it will be seen that we may 
expect the catalogue for the whole session to show a consider- 
_ able increase over last year. Before the first term is ended we 
have more students enrolled than we had the whole of last ses- 
sion. The students are distributed through the various schools 
and courses of study in about the usual proportion. The num- 
ber registering for the agricultural course has increased some- 
what, and, while the number of those taking civil engineering 
’ 
  has decreased a little, the number in mechanical and mining 
engineering have increased proportionately. We have about 
equal numbers of old and new students in attendance. One 
hundred and eight new students were admitted in September.

Of this number thirty-four were admitted upon certificates from

  The grand total of permanent improvements added to the 
University during five years, from 1888 to 1893, amounts to 
$149,349.00. When it is considered that the University has 
received no appropriation from the State during this time, this 
will be taken as a very satisfactory exhibition. The improve-" 
ments were made with funds accruing from the sale of Uni- 
versity lands, rents, ete. The larg. additions to the equipment 
for teaching, apparatus, etc., were made out of current Uni- 
versity funds. 
The teachers’ department was established two years ago, 
and has done valuable work. From the report of Hon. F. M. 
Smith, principal of this department, the following quotation is 
given: 
“The courses of study are arranged to suit the demands of 
two distinct classes of students—first, persons desiring to pre- 
pare themselves for the profession of a teacher in the public 
schools; secondly, teachers desiring to prepare themselves to 
take positions in secondary schools, or as principals and super- 
intendents of schools. 
“(1) The regular course for the certiticate will cover two aca- 
demic years, the first or fall term of each year being devoted to 
general academic work, and the second or spring term to include 
work of a professional character. Persons who have never 
taught, or have no certificate, will be required to take this 
course. Their work in the fall term will be assigned them in 
accordance with their needs and preparation. They will be ex- 
     
-P-A-G-E-59
oe 
pected to take regular work as other academic students, and to 
conform to all the rules and requirements of such students. 
For courses of study, see general announcement. 
“(2) A special course of study is arranged to meet the demands 
of actual teachers having some general education. It will be- 
gin with the spring term, so as to accommodate that large class 
who find it necessary to teach during the fall. Those who de- 
sire, may begin their studies immediately after the Christmas 
holidays. 
« Twenty-nine persons attended this department last session 
(1891-2). Nine persons completed the course, and received 
their certificates at last commencement. I am glad to say that 
every one of them is teaching, with excellent prospects of use- 
fulness and success.” 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
From the report of Chancellor W. H. Payne the following 
facts are gathered : 
Attendance.—The entire enrollment for the year closing May 
25, 1892, was four hundred and seventy; and, of this number, 
two hundred and fifty-one were residents of Tennessee. For 
the current year, the registration at date is four hundred and 
ninety-seven ; and, of this number, two hundred and seventy- 
five are residents of Tennessee. Within the last five years the 
number of Tennessee students in the Peabody Normal College 
has risen fromsixty-nine, in 1888-9, to two hundred and seventy- 
tive, in 1892-3. 
Scholarships.—In strict accordance with the stipulations made 
by the last General Assembly, the Peabody Board of Trust-en- 
dowed thirty-three scholarships for Tennessee, each worth $100 
a year, and the student’s railroad fare from his home to Nash- 
ville and return. These scholarships are now held as follows: 
First District, Nannie Emmert; Second, Julia Cloyd; Third, 
W. H. Emert; Fourth, G. W. Cross; Fifth, Vinnie Bishop; 
Sixth, Neva R. Love; Seventh, J. V. Rymer; Highth, Addie 
Dyer; Ninth, W. D. Brown; Tenth, Rk. L. Smithson ; Eleventh, 
J. W. Marshall; Twelfth, T. F. Driver; Thirteenth, Mattie

Jones; Thirty-first, Mabel Owen; Thirty-second, Kate Harris; 
Thirty-third, Mary D. Mathes. 
At the close of the current academic year in May, 1893, there 
will be scholarship vacancies in the following districts, to be 
filled by competitive examination: First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, 
Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Fifteenth, Six- 
teenth, Seventeenth, Twentieth, Twenty-first, Twenty-second, 
Twenty-third, Twenty-fifth, Twenty-seventh, Twenty-eighth, 
Twenty-ninth, Thirty-first, Thirty-second, Thirty-third. 
The Peabody Board.—This Board continues its wonted liberal 
treatment of the College, having contributed during the year 
1891-2, in scholarships and salaries, the sum of $34,794.21. 
Hach year strengthens the conviction that Tennessee will be 
made the permanent home of this institution. The prompt 
and generous response of the General Assembly to the growing 
requirements of the college, raising, by an almost unanimous 
vote, the yearly appropriation from $10,000 to $15,000; the cor- 
dial support of the State Board of Education in raising the 
working efficiency of the college, and the generous hospitality 
of the Trustees of the University of Nashville in the free use 
of their buildings and grounds—these proofs of local sympa- 
thy and aid strengthen the conviction of the Peabody Board of 
Trust that the great school which they propose to endow should 
be placed in a community so kindly disposed toward their 
cherished enterprise. The present history of the school shows 
that Tennessee is now reaping more than a half of its benefits, 
and this board foresees that when its intent to create the lead- 
ing institution of its kind on this continent has been realized, 
it will contribute more than any other public enterprise to the 
honor and prosperity of the commonwealth in which it is lo-
-P-A-G-E-61
res 
cated. The Trustees, therefore, expect the liberal co-operation 
of Tennessee in the future management of the college, feeling 
that far more than an equivalent will be returned for the public 
appropriations that may be required. 
Financial—A. school that has grown so rapidly—from one 
hundred and seventy-nine, in 1888, to four hundred and ninety- 
seven in 1893—necessarily requires larger and larger expendi- 
tures of money, but the actual increase in expense has been 
small in comparison with the increase in numbers. The in- 
crease in the State Appropriation from $10,000 to $15,000 a 
year was a necessity, and this sum will probably suffice to carry 
the school to the close of the fiscal year, March 23, 1893. 
Though it cannot be foreseen what new needs may arise during 
the next two years, it may be assumed that a yearly appropria- 
tion of $15,000 will suffice for the maintenance of the college 
for this period. A smaller sum than this will certainly be in- 
adequate. If Tennessee were to establish and maintain a 
~ school of this character on her own account, the first outlay for 
buildings and grounds could not be less than $100,000, and the 
_ yearly appropriation for current expenses not less than $35,000.

Tennessee students were graduated as follows:

INSTITUTION FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
The following information is gathered from the reperes of 
Principal Thomas L. Moses: 
This institution was established at Knoxville by the General 
Assembly of the State in the, year 1844. The first session of 
the school was held the following year, beginning with six pu- 
pils, and closing with an attendance of nine. Since that time 
the growth of the institution in attendance and in property has 
been gradual but constant—the attendance now numbering one 
hundred and seventy, and the buildings covering perhaps an_ 
acre. At present, sixty-five counties of the State are repre- 
sented. 
The institution has a separate department for colored chil- 
dren, which was established in 1880, and is now conducted upon 
premises containing twenty-seven acres of ground, situated two 
miles east of Knoxville. The main school is within the city, 
and contains only eight acres, but it has ample room for edu- 
cational purposes and for play-grounds, lawns, etc. 
The location is a healthful and pleasant one, and the build- 
ings are substantial and well eaauted to the purposes for which 
they were designed. 
The training of the pupils is intended to be educational, 
moral, and industrial. Schools of this kind have, for many 
years, given special attention to the teaching of some trade 
by which the pupil may, in after life, earn a livelihood, 
and become, as a producer, a contributor to the prosperity 
of the commonwealth. Institutions for the deaf and dumb 
probably did the first work in industrial education in American 
schools. The facilities of the institution in this line are now 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
S560 Ee 
limited to printing and shoe-making for the boys, and to sewing, 
house-work, etc., for the girls; butit is in contemplation to ma- 
terially enlarge this department as soon as possible. 
In the education of the deaf, there are three systems or meth- 
ods in most general use—the manual system, the oral system, 
and the combined system. The manual alphabet, signs or 
gestures, writing, objects, and pictures are used in teaching by 
the manual method, which is used exclusively in some institu- 
tions. The oral system, used exclusively in other schools, elim- 
inates sigus and the manual alphabet,‘and uses, as far as possi- 
ble, speech and lip-reading.. The Tennessee school, in common 
with most of the State institutions, employs both the manual 
and oral methods, or the combined system. 
i To the deaf the acquisition of language is the most difficult 
part of education, and requires much time and patient effort, 
whereas the hearing child acquires a large vocabulary and 
proper forms of construction without conscious effort—almost 
by intuition. ; 
The common school branches are taught, and the text-books 
used are, in the main, such as are used in schools for hearing 
children. 
The institution is-maintained by the State, and is free to all 
the deaf and dumb children of Tennessee who have reached 
the age of admission—eight years—and who are mentally and 
_. physically capable of receiving an education. The character and ‘ 
habits of those who have passed the age of childhood are made 
conditions of admission. 
The school is under the control of a board of trustees, of 
which the State Superintendent. of Public Instruction is, ex 
officio, a member by a recent act of the General Assembly. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
The report of Superintendent S. A. Link furnishes the fol- 
lowing: 7 
In regard to the Tennessee School for the Blind, it may be 
said that the past two years have been, in many respects, the 
_ best in its history. The attendance has been large, the teachers
-P-A-G-E-64
  GR 
have done good work, the classes have advanced rapidly, and 
the work done has been of a high degree of excellence. No 
fatal sickness has marred the interest of the pupils in their 
studies. No dissension has stirred the household. This insti- 
tution is part of the public school system of the State, and is 
intended for such as cannot, on account of deficiency of sight, 
be educated in other schools. It has its own special appliances, 
such as raised or pointed print, writing-boards, and frames for. 
holding the type used in ciphering. The extensive collection 
of books provided by appropriation of Congress brings a good 
range of literature in reach of the blind. The Superintendent, 
as chairman of the Committee on Printing for the Blind of the 
United States, has pressed the matter of getting fuller and 
fresher text-books. We are now much better equipped in that 
direction than we were a few years ago. On many subjects, all 
that is necessary can now be had. ‘or the information of those 
who may know of blind children, the following circular of Su- 
perintendent Link is appended: 
CrrcuLar or IyrorMaTrIon. 
The school is located in the city of Nashville, and is free to all the blind in 
Tennessee between the ages of seven and seventeen, who are capable of receiving 
instruction. This is a school, and not a hospital or asylum, hence for admission 
children must be of sound mind, fair health, free from epilepsy, contagious dis- 
eases, and physical malformation. As this is not a reformatory, they must be free 
from immoral habits. In fact, only those can be admitted here who could be ad- 
mitted to the public schools but for deficiency in sight. 
Those who are of such defective sight as not to be able to attend the public 
schools will be admitted here. When there might be a doubt as to the health or 
degree of blindness, a certificate from the family physician should be sent to the 
superintendent of the school before the child is brought for admission. Instruction 
is given in common school branches, and such higher branches as may be war- 
ranted by the time and ability of the pupil. Every child is given an opportunity 
to learn music, both vocal and instrumental. Boys of sufficient age and strength 
are taught to seat chairs, make mattresses and brooms. 
Girls are instructed inf sewing, knitting, and fancy bead work. There is no 
charge to the parent for board, tuition, and medical attendance of the pupil, but 
the parent or some one must provide the pupil with a sufficiency of clothing, and 
pay the traveling expenses to and_from the school; also must arrange to take the 
child away during vacation, and when its school-life closes. . 
There 1s but one vacatioh. The school opens early in September, and closes 
early in June. No provision is made for the children during vacation; hence) 
they must be taken away as soon as school closes. As extra teachers cannot be 
employed to help on pupils who are irregular in attendance, it must be understood 
that a child in good health is not privileged to be out of school a year, or a part of 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  = 64 
a year, and then return at pleasure; but such regularity of attendance is required 
as shall secure the best results for the pupils, and the least unnecessary expendi- 
ture for the school. Whenever it is evident that the attendance of a pupil is det- 
rimental to the progress and good conduct of other pupils, or that such pupil is 
not benefited by a longer stay in school, an immediate withdrawal is required. 
It is evident that a considerable number of blind children in the State are grow-. 
ing up in ignorance, and the attention of the members of the Legislature, school- 
officers and teachers, ministers, doctors, and other persons of humane feeling and 
extensive acquaintance is most earnestly called to this deplorable fact, and it is 
_hoped that these may exert their influence to have such children sent to school. 
_ Those who know, or may learn of such blind children, will show themselves pos- 
sessed of the highest and best attributes of humanity by such work.

THE LAW CONCERNING THE ADMISSION OF PUPILS. 
That each county in this State, in proportion to its scholastic 
population, shall be entitled to the benefit of said school; and 
the officers of said school shall, from time to time, as vacancies 
occur, notify the County Court of each county of the number 
of places in said school to which it is entitled; that hereafter 
the basis of representation for scholars shall be 1,100 scholastic 
population between six and sixteen years of age, and majority 
fraction thereof, for each scholar; but each county shall be ~ 
entitled to at least one scholar; and that the scholarship in this 
institution shall be governed by the scholastic census of 1890 ; 
Provided, That any county sending more than its pro rata share — 
to said institution shall pay the same amount for each child so 
sent that the State pays, viz.: one hundred dollars per annum. 
The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, at its last 
session, appropriated $1,795 for the purpose of making improve- 
ments, specified as follows: Additional work shops, $500; bath- 
house, $300; tools and implements for laundry, shops, and 
printing-office, $400; seeds and fruit-plants, $200; teams and 
wagon, $395. This amount has been expended in full, together 
with $9,452.80 out of the general fund, making’ the sum-total 
paid out for improvements $11,247.80. 
- In September, 1891, Superintendent Kilvington presented the 
necessity of considering the establishment of « girls’ depart- 
ment. The measure was duly considered, the order given for 
its early inception, and, on the seventh day of October, 1891, 
the institution extended its arms to receive the new-born char- 
ity. There are now in this department thirty-seven girls. 
On the first day of April, 1892, it was found necessary to 
open another department for the small boys. There are now 
fifty pupils in this department. 
The institution has in cultivation about fifty acres of land. 
Highteen acres have been planted in fruits, which have not, 
until the past season, proven of any special benefit to the insti- 
tution. ‘Thirty-two acres are used for farm and garden pur- 
_ poses. From these thirty-two acres the institution has raised 
plenty of vegetables for home consumption, and has sold about
-P-A-G-E-68
oy aE ale 
Oey 
$4,000 worth of produce, and has three hundred barrels of seed- 
potatoes for sale and spring planting. 
The shops have not been as profitable as could be desired. 
The money market has been excessively stringent, and, in con- 
sequence, manufacturers have not been desirous of laying up 
  stock. 
The educational facilities have been much improved. The — 
pupils have taken hold of the superior advantages in a praise- ~_ pu d g x 
worthy manner. The curriculum now includes well managed ry. o 
schools in the English branches, also in Latin, algebra, book- — 
keeping, telegraphy, stenography, type-writing, elocution, brass- 
band music, and singing. 
    The industries now represented have been built up gradually. 
There is great reason to feel pride in the children’s work. 
With improved facilities and an increased demand for manu- 
factures, some revenue can be derived from the shop-work, but 
it must not be forgotten that the interests and the benefits — 
should accrue to the child first; and that as soon as he is able 
to make any thing for the school, he is competent to care for 
himself, and should be released from the school. The children 
are occupied as follows: Chair-making, shoe-making, tailoring, 
printing, carpentry, painting, harness-making, floriculture, 
gardening, fruit-raising, farming, broom-making, cabinet-mak- 
ing, wood turning, wood-carving, blacksmithing, wagon-mak- 
ing, and all sorts of general work. 
The ministers, Bros. Martin, Herndon, Price, Alford, and 
Blair, have labored with us long and faithfully, and have the 
assurance that their labors have not been spent in vain. 
Dr. W. J. McMurray is entitled to much credit for faithful 
services rendered to the sick, and is to be heartily commended 
for his efficiency and tender care of the pupils. / 
\ 
WATKINS INSTITUTE. 
The report of the Commissioners of the Watkins Institute 
shows: 
That by reference to the last report, rendered two, years ago,
-P-A-G-E-69
  OO 
it will be seen that there was a balance of $625.48, since which 
                ~ time rents have been collected to the amount of $12,328.54. 
The disbursements for the same period have amounted to 
~ $12,557.16, leaving cash now on hand, $396.86. The expense 
account was $7,019.91, including all salaries, cost of coal, gas, 
repairs, pay of engineer, servant hire, and various other items 
of necessary expense, of which a minute account is kept by the 
secretary, and is subject to inspection by the Committees on 
Charitable Institutions. The charge for insurance of the 
building, on account of its proximity to the Vendome Theatre, 
amounts to the heavy sum of $2,280.00. The expenses con- 
nected with the night school aggregate $2,375.20. The trustees © 
have, within the last two years, purchased books for the 
Howard Library, the cost being $882.05, and we hope to be able 
to add every year to the library. Such directions are expressly 
authorized by the will of the late Samuel Watkins; in effect, 
the library constitutes a part of the Watkins charity. 
The will gives to the Commissioners almost unlimited dis- 
- eretion as to the mode and manner of carrying out his general 
purpose of providing instruction for those who are without 
the means of otherwise acquiring an education. After the 
experience of a few years, the Commissioners determined 
that most good would be realized by establishing night schools, 
and every day demonstrates the propriety of their action. 
The following is the course of study prescribed Fi 
Class A—Primary Arithmetic, Reading, Spelling, Letter- 
writing, and Penmanship. 
Class B.—Intermediate Arithmetic, Reading, Spelling, Let- 
ter-writing, and Penmanship. 
Class C.—Advanced Arithmetic, Grammar, Civil Govern- 
ment, and Natural Science. 
s Class D.—Commercial Arithmetic, Book-keeping, Sten- 
_ ography, and Type-writing. 
Class H.—Mechanical Drawing. _

Bote Qi: 
The conditions of admission are good moral character and 
regular and prompt attendance. Students are required to take 
all subjects in the classes to which they belong. Tuition is of -

There has been a marked increase in the number of pupils. 
At this time last year the number was 231. The roll now shows — 
370, distributed as follows: ‘

The school is under the management of Prof. I. C. Weber, 
to whose intelligent administration the Commissioners express 
themselves indebted for the success which has attended their 
efforts to bring within reach of the poorest young mam or 
woman in Nashville the opportunity of acquiring a useful edu- 
cation, He is charged with the responsibility of selecting the 
teachers—four in number—and so far perfect satisfaction has 
been rendered to the Trustees. 
The pupils are of varied ages—some ‘old, some young—and 
an application for admission is generally accompanied by a de- 
termination to study. Hence, there are not many calls for the 
exercise of discipline. A pupil is quietly dismissed if he neg- 
lects his duty or violates the rules. 
ConcLuston. 
No report of education in Tennessee would be complete 
which failed to acknowledge the important aid rendered by the 
Peabody and Slater Education Funds. In addition to valuable 
pecuniary contributions made by both these funds, the personal 
presence and wise counsels of Hon. J. L. M. Curry, general 
agent, and of President Rutherford B. Hayes have done much 
to advance the interests of education.

    SOTO 
I cannot conclude the report of another year without repeat- 
ing my thanks to all my associates in the work of education, 
In approaching the close of my term of office, I feel a grateful 
sense of the uniform courtesy and co-operation which has been 
extended to me in official and personal relations by the county 
and city school-ofticers, by the County Courts, by the members 
a of the General Assembly, by the State officials, by the State 
Board of Education, and by the teachers of public and private 
schools. i 
It affords me pleasure, a second time, to acknowledge my 
obligations to my predecessors in office, Hon. Leon Trousdale, 
Hon. Thomas H. Paine, and Hon. F. M. Smith, for the kind 
suggestions and advice. at 
__ My thanks are especially due to the Secretary of the State 
Board of Education, Prof. Frank Goodman, for his unwearied 
and unselfish exertions in behalf of education. 
It is but an act of justice to testify to the zeal and ability 
with which Mr. J. 8. Buchanan has performed the various and 
arduous duties of clerk of this department. 
The interest which Your Excellency has shown in education 
has gained you the esteem of the educators of the State, and 
has contributed much to the advancement of the public school 
system. In closing this report, I cannot refrain from express- 
C ing my personal gratitude for your courtesy and kindness dur- 
ing the entire term of our official connection. 
Ihave the honor to be, 
Your obedient servant, 
We RGARRELT, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

*The large difference between the white male and white female scholastic population is, per-

A full financial report cannot be made, as the mode of keep- 
ing the accounts has been divided between the school board and 
City Council, and no satisfactory statements can be secured from 
the latter. 
The schools experienced a prosperous year, and are popular 
with the people. 
A manual training school was established during the year 
with a regular division, and three other divisions, also connected 
with the regular work, took manual training lessons at ap- 
pointed hours.

“EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORTS 
ORs 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Tn addition to their annual reports, nearly all of the County 
Superintendents, in accordance with law and the regulations 
thereunder, have prescribed regulations for grading the schools, 
for examination and promotion of pupils through the several 
grades for their respective counties, and have sent copies of the 
same to this office. In the majority of cases the County Super- 
intendents, being provided with no fund for printing, have an- 
nounced these regulations at teachers’ meetings and through 
the columns of the county papers. Some County Superintend- 
ents have had their regulations printed in circular or pamphlet 
form, which have been received at this office, and filed as rec- 
ords. 
The activity of the County Superintendents is further shown 
in a number of circular addresses issued to the voters of the © 
county, urging the levy of taxes adequate to place the public 
schools upon efficient footing. 
The address of Superintendent Leslie will be found appended 
to the report of Benton County. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
E. L. Foster, Superintendent. 
The report shows a falling off in enrollment and attendance — 
upon the schools, which is attributed to the fact that a great 
i  
-P-A-G-E-158
  — 167 — 
many schools were not in session. The money in several local- 
ities was used in building new houses. It will be seen that 
there is an advance in prices paid to teachers and in the valua- 
tion of school-property. The most encouraging fact to be 
reported is the establishing of the “Anderson County Teach- 
ers’ Circulating Library.”. Many of the best books published 
on history, philosophy, and theory of education are now in the 
library. ‘ Ys 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
J. H. Auten, Superintendent. 
The general ‘condition of education in this county is not, in 
every respect, satisfactory; yet, comparatively speaking, we 
have little cause to complain. A steady, healthy growth is ap- 
parent in every part of the field, and the general conditions fa- 
yorable. 
The attendance is not all that could be desired, but observa- 
tion teaches me that comparatively few children are kept from 
school, except in cases that are, to some extent, justifiable. 
When we cousider the number of our young people who are in 
other than public schools, and those whom overruling circum- 
stances control and hinder, we have reasons for feeling gratified 
with our enrollment and daily attendance. 
Our teachers are interested in Institutes, reading circles, and 
other means of improvement. My annual reports for several 
years have correctly shown the regular attendance at the annual 
Institutes to be greater than the number employed in our public¢ 
schools. We have no monthly Institutes, but have kept a 
reading circle for seven years, which has been very interesting 
and beneficial to its members. A new course of study is
-P-A-G-E-159
            — 158 — 
adopted at the beginning of each year, and the meetings of the 
circle are monthly. The meetings are not as largely and regu- 
larly attended as they should be. No teachers’ library is con- 
nected with the County Institute, neither is there a course of 
reading and study, excepting such as is required to prepare to 
carry out the programme which is distributed several weeks be- 
fore the annual meeting. We have no teachers’ circulating 
library, but a large per cent. of dur teachers have professional 
libraries at home, and read good educational journals. 
The District Directors generally visit each school in the dis- 
trict one or more times during the term. The citizens visit very 
little on other than special occasions. Most of the better grade 
schools have one or more extra days during the term, and close 
with examination exercises, reviews, etc., in which the citizens, 
‘and especially patrons, manifest much interest. 
It would be difficult to give a fair and definite answer to your 
seventh question. Seventy of our teachers were not changed 
at the close of last term. Some years as many as a hundred are 
not changed; but the official term of the teacher in this county 
may be reckoned anywhere from one short term to twenty long 
years. 
All the schools of the county are not graded according to 
law. A system of grading very similar to that recommended 
by you in your annual report has been distributed, and the work 
. is now in a gratifying stage of progress. We only want time. 
We have an excellent corps of teachers, and a large per cent. 
of them are giving satisfaction, “Haven’t we the best school 
in the county?” is a question that I am frequently foreed to 
dodge in my annual round of visitations. While we have a 
few inferior schools and a few inefficient teachers, it is gratify- 
ing to witness constant growth in educational sentiment among 
the people, and constant improvement in methods of doing on 
the part of teachers, 
The school-funds are economically administered, and, as far 
as I know, satisfactorily. J hear very little complaint om ac- 
count of extravagance in the use of the funds.

  BENTON COUNTY. 
G. M. Lxsurz, Superintendent. 
Serious difficulties present themselves for consideration in 
establishing a graded system for Benton County. First, the 
schools are not of the same length; second, the irregular ad- 
-vancement of pupils in the various studies of our common 
schools. Some are advanced in arithmetic, and know little 
about geography, grammar, ete., while others have given all 
their time and attention to reading or some other pet study, and 
neglected arithmetic and other branches. : 
To Pargnts. 
  I would earnestly recommend that steps be taken to extend | — 
the schools of our county to at least five months in the year. 
Parents should not depend entirely upon the State and county 
to educate their children, but should, if necessary, aid the pub- 
lic-fund with liberal subscriptions. You can also promote the 
interest of our public schools by co-operating with the teachers 
in introducing the graded system. 
To TEACHERS. 
The grades are not to be taken as a “cut and dried” rule, 
but it is expected that in a short time the student will be re- 
quired to study those branches best suited to his advancement. 
It may not be best at present to. have a/class that reads well in 
the fifth reader, but is just beginning grammar or geography, 
to drop back to the third reader in order to take all the studies 
prescribed for that grade. .A compromise may be effected just 
here by taking the course prescribed for the fourth grade, or 
by taking part of the studies prescribed for two grades. The 
difficulty may, however, be better overcome by giving special 
attention to those branches in which the child is most deficient. 
Teachers should be very careful to instruct pupils in all the - 
branches to be taught in first and second grades, so that they
-P-A-G-E-161
        Seo 
may completely master them, and so that the various faculties 
of the mind may be sufliciently developed to take all the stud- 
ies of the higher grade when reached. 
ReGuLations. 
Your attention is now called to the following regulations” 
concerning the promotion of pupils: No student shall be pro- 
moted until his teacher, by careful management and strict at- 
tention; is thoroughly satisfied that he has sufficiently mastered 
the studies of his grade to enable him to successfully enter the 
next higher. While it may be convenient to promote all the 
pupils of the same grade at the same time, yet the teacher 
should be very careful in’ his judgment, and if any one, from 
negligence or irregular attendance, or any other cause, has 
fallen behind his class, he should not be promoted, but should 
be required to review his studies. On the other hand, the 
bright and industrious pupil’should not be chained to ‘his indo- 
lent class-mate, but may be promoted to the next grade as soon 
as he is found competent. - Thus, the progress of the brighter 
and more capable pupil is not hindered and the less capable are 
  \ 
not,unduly hurried. When a pupil is passed to a higher grade, © 
” the teacher shall place the letter “p” in the square opposite his 
name for the day on which he is promoted, and a figure on the 
_ left of the “p” showing the grade from which, and one on the 
right showing the grade to which, he is promoted. At the 
close of school, the teacher shall place a figure opposite each 
pupil’s name, in the column headed “remarks,” showing the 
grade to which he belongs, and a fraction showing what part 
of that grade is completed. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
T. F. Harn, Superintendent. 
IT am proud to say that the cause of education is steadily im- 
proving in our county. Our Teachers’ Institutes have become
-P-A-G-E-162
     
Seagt es 
very interesting and profitable. We have labored earnestly in 
these meetings until we have gotten the greater number of our 
teachers to attend and take especial interest in the same. I 
would earnestly reccommend the Institute work to the school- 
officers and teachers throughout the State, and, to make the 
work as practicable as possible, bringing before the teachers in 
these Institutes their work in the way they have to mectit in the 
school-room; then freely discuss and adopt the best methods. 
Our daily attendance is improving, though by no means what 
it ought to be, yet we hope to continue to improve, 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
J. W. Dueaan, Superintendent. 
We are making progress in the educational work. During 
the last week in Juue, an Institute was held for the benefit of 
colored -teachers. During the first week in July, a County 
Normal was held for the benefit of the white teathers. Both 
Institutes were well attended, and a good interest manifested by 
the teachers. ‘ ( 
In theory, our schools are in good shape. We have a course 
of study and a programme of study and recitation in the hands 
of every teacher. Many of our schools are reasonably well 
graded. Efforts are being made to grade them all. 
We have a teachers’ circulating library association in Blount, 
inaugurated in 1891. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Amon Gross, Superintendent. 
Inclosed herewith please find my second annual report for the — 
year ending June 30,1892. I cannot boast of its correctness or 
11 Supt. Pub. Instrue.
-P-A-G-E-163
  — 162 — 
~ promptness, because it has been quite an endeavor upon my part 
to secure the information contained therein; but it pleases my 
mind to say that the progress has been gleaned in this county 
which has. been prayed for so long. We will have an average 
term of five months for the present year. I have taken special 
care to visit the schools in every neighborhood, both white and 
__ colored, and find most of the teachers doing good work. 
CANNON COUNTY. 
  E. Mears, Superintendent. 
I have the pleasure to report schools much improved, a 
larger enrollment, a better average daily attendance, a higher 
grade of teachers, and a very much increased interest in public 
schools by the teachers, pupils, and patrons, amounting to a 
general waking up of the people on public education. The 
people are finding out that publie schools are the best means by 
which the masses of the people can be educated and society 
improved. I hope that the enemies of popular education will 
finally give way and fall into the great work. Uniformity of 
text-books is more nearly accomplished than any other previous 
_ year. Our Institutes have been well attended, with considerable 
  interest. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
\ 
Mrs. Luza C. Winson, Superintendent. 
I am glad to be able to, report that our schools have been 
such as to give satisfaction. I have used every effort possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  — 163 — 
to advance the schools in Carter County since I was elected to 
the office of County Superintendent, and, as a result Ihave the 
county thoroughly organized. County Court, directors, and 
teachers are co-operating in the work., We have a uniform 
system of books, and a graded course of study. Ihave visited 
all the schools in the county—some of them two and three — 
times—and assisted the teachers in grading them. 
In regard to the teachers, I do not think I can say too much 
in their praise. Nearly all of them have made special prepara- 
tions for school work, and right well are they doing their part. 
Having been in all the schools, I know that earnest work is 
being done. The latest and most approved methods are being 
taught. ; ; 
Our County Institutes are well attended, and the State Insti- — 
_ tute, this summer, was certainly an occasion to be remembered. 
The teachers came in a body, and seemed very much enthused | 
over the prospects for the future. No county is more promis- 
ing of an enlightened and educated citizenship than Carter. 
The County Court made the school-districts and civil districts 
identical at its July term, which places our districts in a better 
condition. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
Junnie C. Rrronrs, Superintendent. 
We are glad to be able to say that the schools of our county 
are improving. The reports this year were much better than 2 
those of last year. ~ 
  The State Normal, which was held in Tazewell last June, con- : 
ducted by Prof. H. C. Weber, assisted by Prof. G. H. Gardner, ae 
was a success. At the close of the State Normal, a County — 
Institute was held, followed by a teachers’ examination. We 
  {
-P-A-G-E-165
  — 164 — 
are indebted to Prof. C. Y. Chapman and Mr. A. N. Greece, of 
Tazewell, and Prof. J. V. Rymer, of Polk County, for their val- 
uable assistance. 
CLAY COUNTY. 
  be M. C. Stpwetr, Superintendent. 
The schools in my county have been more prosperous this 
year than they were last, as you will see by referring to the 
daily attendance of 1892. The people are taking more interest 
jn our common schools than they ever did before, yet they are 
not taking that amount of interest that they should, and that 
we hope to see them do in the “sweet by and by.” . 
    We held two Institutes this year, which were reasonably well 
attended, and, by the assistance of Professor Roberts, of Alpine 
Institute, and Professor McPherson, of Mouth of Wolf Semi- 
nary, we accomplished a good work, which has beén realized 
all over this county during the present year. 
    COFFEE COUNTY. 
: ‘ Mitton Hoover, Superintendent. 
I find it almost impossible to get Directors to send in their re- 
ports in time. The schools of the county will compare favor- 
ably with this time last year, with the exception of attendance, 
which has been light, from the fact our county has been visited 
- by a scourge of sickness of several kinds. ‘ 
   
-P-A-G-E-166
  — 165 — t 
One thing I notice in the way of improvement especially, is 
that a much larger per cent. of the teachers have received first- 
grade certificates, as will be shown in next year’s report. We 
have not issued many second-grade certificates this year. 
While many of our best teachers were opposed to the grad- 
ing system, I find they are coming in all right, and seem to be 
well pleased with it. 
Ihave endeavored to have every school in the county celebrate 
“Columbus Day,” and think most of them will. j 
Upon the whole, I think the interest of education is on rising __ 
ground in Coffee County, but to raise education to the point it 
should be will take a long, hard, and united effort of school- 
officers, teachers, and patrons.

I inclose annual report for our county. It has been delayed 
for the reason it was impossible to get Directors’ reports sooner. 
Our school-districts number forty-nine, when we ought to have 
only fifteen. I believe it would be far better to have the school- 
districts identical with the civil districts. Our schools have 
done reasonably well. We had the best summer County Normal 
sand examination by far we have ever had.

“in school-work, both by teachers and patrons. “Many of the 
teachers have attended school between the terms of their own 
schools, realizing the necessity for keeping up with the times. 
I feel that we fare a field needing State work—one where a 
State Normal Institute would bring forth lasting good. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY.

Lcall your attention to one.item of the report, and that is to 
_ the average daily attendance—it is 780 less than last year. This 
was caused by the extremely bad weather last January, Feb- 
ruary, and March. ‘he country schools were practically broken 
up during January and February. 
Our financial condition is good, very good. Our school-war- 
rants are worth 100 cents in the dollar.

It it gratifying to note the progress of the schools of DeKalb 
since January, 1891, to the present. I do not feel that I stand 
alone when I say her success in the intellectual march has never 
been so gratifying as now. The general summing up of my 
county is far in advance of even our most sanguine expectations. 
The teachers are to day no longer strangers or foreigners, but 
brothers and sisters, going on to victory, and leading our boys 
and girls on to future heights of coming usefulness.

Miss Morire Preren, Superintendent. 
Weare a little in advance of the work of last year. The in- 
creased interest is due to the success of the State Institute you 
saw fit to place here. Prof. J. B. Williams, the conductor, did 
a grand and noble work, the result of which has already been 
seen. He knew just what was needed, and forthwith aroused 
an interest that has since been kept up among the teachers. ~ ” 
We have a live teachers’ association, which meets once a 
month at different places over the county. Our exercises consist® 
principally of lectures and practical work. We have also a 
graded course*of study that has done much toward arousing a ° 
better system of well-regulated and developed work. 
We have not done all we hope to do toward grading our 
schools. The interest though is increasing, and we have reason 
to believe that with continued effort the work, as a whole, will 
soon be placed upon a firm and systematic basis. ae 
It is our purpose now to support a County Normal this com- 
ing term. Every effort is being made to that effect, and, if ac- 
complished, greater things will be heard from the schools of 
Dyer, whose illustrious sons and daughters are true to their 
county and State, and are every day growing more patriotic in 
love for their country. 
  “Columbus Day” was, in a measure, celebrated over the — 
county. Especial mention is due to the exercise held in Dyers- 
-burg. Thessongs sung on that day will, in years to come, find 
an echo in the happy hearts of every child that sung them on 
that day. The memory of the occasion will last for ever. ‘

FAYETTE COUNTY. 
T. T. Harpy, Supérintendent. 
Inclosed you will find my second annual report. It is some- 
what imperfect—necessarily so—but it is, however, approx- 
imately correct. Our schools have improved much in efficiency. 
Our policy has been to have fewer and better schools, and the 
school-directors have heeded my advice and followed my sug- 
gestions, which will prove of decided benefit to the children of 
the county. I will not say more in regard to the work done in 
that line, but will send you a piece published in our county 
paper, and written by its editor, the Hon. J. H. Dortch, the 
father of the “Dortch Law,” who is a strong advocate and 
valuable friend of the public schools: 
_ under competent teachers. 
  “ Nothing is more conducive to the prosperity of a country 
_. than good public schools. The last County Court took this 
view of the subject, and increased the school-tax from 5 cents 
to 15 cents—the limit of the law. This, with the State rate, 
will practically double our school-fund, to which will be added 
the $1 poll, which has hitherto been listed to the general county 
fund. Taking these increases of the tax rate, our people can 
be assured of a sufficient amount of money to keep the schools ~ 
at least ten months of each year, when the management of the | 
same is conducted wisely and well. For years the public school 
system of the county has not been the best for those who pay 
the taxes, but, under the wise management of Prof. T. T. 
Hardy, the County Superintendent, a number of districts are 
now in possession of schools which will compare favorably with 
any in the State. Correspondence with him by the school- © 
‘directors will bring plans for the reorganization of the various 
schools upon the same basis as those in several districts where 
the children are given scholastic advantages for ten months, 
‘ 
“ While it is true the taxes have been raised, yet the tax- 
payers will not ‘kick’ when they know their children are get-

ting the benefit of the fund, and that it is not wasted in un- 
" profitable schools. Mr. Hardy deserves great credit for having 
brought about this change in public sentiment.” 
FENTRESS COUNTY. 
/ 
W. S. Winninenam, Superintendent. 
In making this report I have no desire to. make the impres- 
sion that the schools of Fentress County have attained a es = 
‘of perfection. Such is not the case. 
Our public schools should run six or seven months in the 
year, instead of three months, as they now run on an average. 
Our public schools are the only hope for the education of the 
masses; and how can this be accomplished with only three 
months’ school in a year? Our Teachers’ Institute, held in 
June, with Prof. D. R. Case, of the Rugby High School, as 
instructor, was a complete success. We need more money, 
better school-houses, better appliances, and, above all, better 
teachers. God speed the day when the people of Fentress 
County will look upon this subject in its true light!

rectors knowing that they would not be re-elected, they were 
very careless, and did not demand abstracts of the teachers, so 
Iam unable to give a report of the grades and the number of 
pupils in the various branches taught in the public schools. 
I have been regularly in correspondence with the teachers 
and Directors of the county, and have been able, with the aid 
of your instructions, which were kindly and promptly furnished 
me when asked for, to settle all troubles and determine all 
questions that have arisen, without employing attorneys or re- 
sorting to the courts. 
T held no Institutes this summer, as Professor Terrell held a 
two months’ normal at Terrell College, giving instruction on 
the latest and best methods of teaching and controlling schools, 
which I thought would be much better for the young teachers 
than any Institute that I could hold. 
We have four colleges in our county, and three-fourths of 
our white teachers are young men and women just out of these 
colleges, who are well equipped and fully up with the times 
and the latest methods of teaching. The work and influence 
of these colleges are greatly felt in our public schools. 
Our colored schools are progressing very well. We have 
more money this year than usual, and our schools will run about 
six months. Upon the whole, our schools are slowly but surely 
growing better each year.

While our schools are not perfect, I am glad to be able to say

I held a Teachers’, Institute the last week in June, and over 
five-fifths of the teachers were present. I called a meeting of 
the Directors soon after the election, and a large majority at- 
tended the meeting. Both teachers and Directors manifest 
more interest than ever before. : 
I visited nearly every school in the county this year, and 
every teacher seemed to be doing his best to carry out the law 
and promote the interests of his school. 
There are just two things needed now to make the schools of 
Giles County what they should be—a larger tax levy, and re- 
districting the county into school-districts, with one school in 
each district. I have had the subjects discussed before Direct- 
~ ors’ and teachers’ meetings, and have talked to a number of 
magistrates on the subject, and think prospects very 8 good to 
have this done in January. 
Taking all things into consideration, the sulle for educa- 
tion in Giles eanty is more favorable than ever before.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
C. C. Justus, Superintendent. 
Iam pleased to state that a new interest seems to indicate’ 
that the past year is fraught with better general results than any 
since 1873. My statistics are not based on conjecture, as annual 
_ reports have been received from every District Clerk in the 
county. By comparing the inclosed statistical report with 
former reports from this office, you will see that Grainger 
County is endeavoring to keep pace with the educational ad- 
.vancement of the day, and that our schools are in better condi- 
tion than usual. The enrollment in 1891 increased six hundred 
and ninety, while the scholastic population only increased one 
“hundred and fifty. The amount invested in apparatus this year 
“is greater than any previous year by six hundred dollars. The 
average daily attendance increased ten per cent. 
In my last report I referred to a diversity of text-books. By 
coming in constant contact with the officers and patrons, and by 
calling the patrons together in my visits and addressing them 
on the question in point, I have succeeded in eliciting their co- 
operation, which has resulted in uniformity in almost all the 
schools. “We have graded forty-five schools, and will tinish the 
introduction and purify the minutie of grading next year, as 
the people are already realizing that the system augments the 
interest and result fifty per cent. If any Superintendent makes 
the necessary reforms in our ungraded country schools, he will 
have to make his office in the saddle at least four months in the 
year. 
The throng of visitors each day at our normal indicated new 
- zeal. The mornings were devoted, in the main, to examinations; - 
the afternoons and evenings to Institute work, lectures, popular 
addresses, ete. The interest of Grainger County teachers in 
the normal deserves mention: an average daily attendance of 
-seventy—twelve in excess of the number of white schools in 
the county. Our county was favored with the aid of such dis-

  tinguished educators as M. B. Aston, of Greene; S. J. Ledger- 
-wood, of Union; C. Y. Chapman, of Claiborne, and T. ‘J. 
Cline, of Knox. Also Mr. Wilford Caulkins, principal of the — 
Boys’ and Girls’ High School of Chattanooga, spent one day, 
and gave a lecture which was of real worth to the teachers. 
Five local Institutes and one general association have been 
held to date—October 12. The teachers are glad of the oppor- 
tunity, and the patrons have crowded the seating capacity at 
every meeting. Let the Superintendents appoint times, places, — 
and programmes early; have music and dinner on the ground, 
aud they will have a new order of Institutes in the rural dis-. 
tricts. : 
In June, the Directors adopted rules of order, ete., for the 
government of the schools, and that, together with my system 
of grading, and suggestions in the hands OE officers and patrons, 
has done much to diffuse information and improvement. Later, 
at my suggestion in a circular letter, we organized into a body 
known as the “Grainger County Teachers’ Association,” and 
have just had an interesting session. The association ap- 
‘pointed a committee to devise plans, etc., and we are determined: 
to establish a Grainger County teachers’ circulating library 
this winter. This will educate the association in teaching, and 
will make them purely professional, 
These things I have to complain of: The meager funds— 
that result in short terms—and the Directors receiving no pay 
for time spent at call of Superintendent. The Legislature 
would make a most beneficent provision, and crown the State 
with a most progressive and intelligent. yeomanry, if it would 
require the County Courts to make an additional assessment, 
adequate to a five months’ term, in every school-district in the 
State. 
I cannot complain of my teachers. I have visited every 
school—some twice. I find the latest approved methods, 
thoroughness, order, neatness, and energy. With such a corps 
of teachers and officers, and such a State Superintendent, we 
will ene Grainger County a front rank in the muster of Ten- 
nessee’s counties in 1900.

Our schools are-in good condition. Our teachers did good 
work in every district; hence, an excellent attendance. Our 
Directors visit the schools, encourage the teachers, and thus 
popularize the cause of education. 
A number of good school-houses have been erected within 
the past four years; the school-fund has been increased; the 
‘schools have been graded, and two State Institutes have been 
held in this county—one at Greeneville, July, 1890, the other at 
Tusculum, July, 1892. The latter was one of the most inter- 
esting ever held in East Tennessee. It began Tuesday, July 5, 
and continued until Saturday, July 15. Everybody was de- 
lighted with it. I wish to thank you for locatiag said Institute 
at Tusculum. It was well attended. More than two hundred 
teachers were enrolled. At least six hundred people attended 
_the Institute. Miss Doak did good work. She gave tone and 
character to the Institute. I am indebted to the teachers of 
Greene County. They made the meeting a success. 
As you may know, Greeneville bonded herself for $12,000. 
She now has an excellent Superintendent in the person of Mr. 
W.M. Rogers. She will erect a commodious school-building 
at an early day. She has about seven hundred pupils in school, 
and I am ready to believe that she will enroll one thousand or 
more. “he tide is with us. Your Institutes aided our people 
in various ways. 
On last January, our worthy court voted thirty cents on the 
$100 without a dissenting voice. So much for the cause of 
education. I am happy, my teachers are cheerful, the Directors 
are hopeful. All honor to our generous court ! 
We have some excellent high schools in this county. Tuscu- 
lum may be regarded as the headlight. This institution has 
done a good work. Many of our public school teachers were 
educated within her walls. :

able to gather. I have labored very hard to get our Directors 
and iene to make out their reports at the proper time, but 
~ have not fully succeeded in getting this done yet. Iam proud 
to say, however, that the cause of education is gradually ad- 
  yancing in the County of Grundy, and, while our schools are eS 
very far from, being what I and every true lover of education 
desires, still there is much improvement in every department of: 
our work for the last year. I have visited nearly all of the 
schools of the county, and have tried in the best way I knew 
to encourage them, and to instill into them a new life and a re- 
newed effort in the direction of a more perfect educational 
system. 
I have been holding teachers’ Institutes. They have accom-

We have made some grand improvements in our schools. 
Public sentiment is becoming favorable to public education. 
Our teachers are awake, and doing good work, and the people 
of Hancock County are becoming more thoroughly enthused 
in regard to education. Our County Normal, held last July at 
Sneedville, was a success in every particular—the best ever held 
in the county. A better attendance and greater interest mani- 
fested by all. We have our county divided into four Institute 
districts. The teachers of the different districts attend the 
branch Institutes. ‘Then we have, at the close of the school 
term, a joint Institute of the different districts. We have suc- 
cess in this way, because we have tried it. I think Ican sue- 
ceed in getting every school in the county graded this year— 
something that has never been done before. The new. school-

greets you this year with the most efficient corps of teachers of 
which it has ever been her lot to boast. I have visited every 
school in the county twice, and some more than twice. Ad- 
- dressing the school on every visit seems to inspire the teachers 
and pupils, and the patrons who came out to hear, with new 
zeal. It gratifies me to note the marked improvement. TI have 
exerted myself and done all I could do to get the people to 
feel the great responsibilities resting on them. I can boast that — 
the teachers of my county have gone in a solid phalanx into 
every neighborhood of the county, and instilled into hundreds 
and thousands of hearts, through the Institute work, ideas they 
had never gleaned before. 
HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
I. N. Hotranp, Superintendent. 
I cannot say that this report is correct, and know that it 
should have been made earlier; but the contents therein have 
been quite an endeavor to obtain. I am very proud of one 
feature of my work—twelve goud Institutes. At some of them 
we had as many as forty teachers enrolled. The result of the 
work was not long in developing.. Many parents aroused.from 
their carelessness, aud grasped an opportunity to place a boy or 
girl in some good institution of learning. 
There is another thing which shows improvement—the school- 
houses. Heretofore our houses, many of them, have been very 
uncomfortable, but many frame ones have been built, and are 
well supplied with fixtures.

As to the grade of our teachers, I have tried to hold them up, 
but, owing to the leniency of some of my predecessors, it has 
been very embarrassing at times. About the greatest error in 
the work of our teachers is, so many of them look first to the 
finance, rather than to their quality. Among so many of our 
Directors is the watch-word of “low price,” instead of consid- 
ering the other surroundings. ‘aking it all in a nut-shell, we 
say that there is a great and grand improvement harbored in 
the hearts of our people, besides what has been developed, and 
we hope soon to see a brighter dawn gleam than has yet. been.

Our school-term averages eighty days this year. The attend- 
ance is better than ever before. The compensation of teachers 
remains the same as last year. Our teachers’ associations con- 
tinue to grow in interest. The annual Normal Institutes in 
June were the best in attendance and results that we have ever 
had. 
At the Institute for the white teachers eighty teachers en- 
rolled their names, and when I tell you that our instructor was 
Prof. S. A. Mynders, of Lexington, you will know that the work 
was well done. At the close of the Institute I held my annual 
examination. The results of the Institute I notice in the im- 
proved work in the various schools. I spent six weeks in visit- 
ing the schools of the county. I think my visits do good. I 
desire to do every thing I can to instill a desire for education in 
our boys and girls, for they are the hope of the future. Itisa 
source of regret that our school-tax was decreased last January. 
The work in grading is not entirely satisfactory. Our teachers 
have many obstacles to overcome before correct grading can be

this year to prepare to do better work next year. 
A great improvement in our colored schools is manifest.

HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
W. A. Tanner, Superintendent. “ 
Our schools have made much better progress this year than 
last, chiefly because many of those who taught our schools 
heretofore failed to be licensed ‘the past year for want of quali- 
fication. This has acted as a stimulus to those receiving license, 
and they seem to be ambitious to achieve better success in their 
   
-P-A-G-E-181
      — 180 — 
respective fields. Many of our white and colored teachers are 
attending the normal schools during vacation, thereby qualify- 
‘ing themselves for better and more satisfactory work in the 
future. 
We have organized and put in operationdwo city schools— 
one white and one colored—to run nine or ten months each, 
which is a departure in Haywood County. They have a full 
corps of efficient teachers, one numbering one hundred, and 
twenty-five pupils, the other two hundred and ten. Still we 
are embarrassed for want of funds to make our schools what 
they should be. In the rural districts our school-term lasts but 
Jittle over three months, which is too short to meet the neces- 
sities of the case. The most of our school-houses are inferior, 
and the colored schools are mostly taught in churches. Many 
_ of .our people are beginning to realize the absolute necessity of 
having better houses, though they have to be built by private 
donations. I think, upon the whole, our prospects are bright- 
ening, and our people frequently say “that there is more inter- 
‘est in the education of the children of the county than we have 
ever had before.” The election of new School-directors will 
give an impetus to our public schools, since many of the retir- 
ing Directors took little or no interest in the schools of which 
they were the legal guardians. 
About twelve months ago we organized a monthly teachers’ 
meeting, both for white and colored teachers, at which we have 
examinations, discussions of school-methods, reading essays, etc.

with the educational work in this county the past year, though 
it has been similar to that of last, with a degree of improve- 
ment in the system of classifying and grading the schools. I 
am gratified to report improvement in the teachers of- this

themselves thoroughly or be left behind by others, who are 
more ambitious. 
The State Normal Institute which you held here in Paris 
during the last two weeks of June, I do not hesitate to say was 
a success, and did much and fetes good, both for the coc : 
and people. 
I held an Institute for the colored teachers the second week 
in July, which was well attended, and did much good. 
Our Directors are more careful in regard to those they em-

all in my power to advance the cause of education in my county.

upward and onward. I am sure that the new order blanks sent

schools will run longer, and we are gradually getting a better 
grade of teachers, so that it is very gratifying to me to be able 
to report that our schools, from year to year, are growing

are well qualified, and are doing good work. Text-books have 
been adopted for use in the primary and secondary schools, and 
are being used in all parts of the county. Some new school- 
houses are being built. A few old houses have been furnished 
with improved desks. 
I wish to thank you, in the name of Houston County, for the 
State Institute you gave usin June. The increased interest in 
schools,is largely due to the good, practical work and lectures 
of Capt. C. 8. Douglass, J. 8. Buchanan, Prof. Lyons, and Mr.

to say that, by comparing with last year’s report, you will note — 
progress. Our progress is slow, but steady. We are “making 
haste slowly.” { 
Examinations have been more rigid, and the teachers are 
doing better work than ever before. We have secured a uni- 
form series of texts for both primary and secondary schools. 
Have three secondary schools. We have regular monthly meet- 
ings of Humphreys County Educational Association, with bet- 
ter attendance than heretofore. We feel very grateful to you 
for your presence at our September association, and for the 
much-needed information which you gave us. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
Hyram Puarris, Superintendent. 
_ We have made a great improvement, but there is great room 
formore. We are still in need of more money, for as yet we 
have not been able to run the schools five months throughout 
the county; but how to get it is the trouble, when the County 
Court is so immovable from the old basis, and a few wealthy; 
narrow-hearted men ery, “Away with the public schools!” and 
teach their children to believe that they are too good to mingle 
with the poor children of the county.

  Our present law concerning the Directors is inefficient, for it 
takes grit, grace, greenbacks, and intelligence to run the schools 
successfully; and when the greenback is left out of the Di- 
- rector’s case, it robs the Director of all his school-interest, and 
elects men who know but little and care less, and holds back the 
best.men of the district, and the result is neglect and confusion 
by the electing of kin follxs for selfish purposes. 
Our teachers found themselves very much puzzled to grade 
their schools, notwithstanding I furnished them with a graded 
system. The cause was that the children were so irregular in 
their advancement of the branches belonging to each grade— 
while one was second grade reader he was fifth grade arithmetic, 
etc. I think it will take ten years to completely grade the 
children in the country, for by that time these old irregular 
ones will go out, and the younger ones will follow suit; but not 
so in towns and cities. 
My report concerning the number in each grade, means as 
near as we could come to it. The new law of having all the 
Directors to go out at the same time has not worked well in 
Jackson. It has cost me a great deal of labor, and, -perhaps, 
embraces more mistakes. Better retain one old Director who 
knows where the children and school-houses are. I have tried 
toimpress Jackson Countians of the importance of the secondary 
schools taking the place of the ordinary academy, and of the 
great amount of money saved, with but little success. 
[Superintendent Pharris issued the following circular address, 
and distributed it among the tax-payers of the county.] 
“« Fellow-citizens : 
“T take this method of addressing you, thinking that it will 
be best, and that you will have these words to re-read after hay- 
ing reflected upon the thoughts herein expressed. To be plain, 
we need more school-money, longer and better schools. We 
should endeavor to do away with academic schools by extending 
secondary public schools, because the secondary public schools 
are cheaper, and can be made as good as the academic. For 
instance, we had in Jackson County last year $1.40, the year be- 
fore $1.48.per capita. Now, who would think of sending his_
-P-A-G-E-186
  ae Lagp = 
son or daughter to an academic school with $1.48 to pay his or 
her expenses while there? The answer is, no one would attempt 
it; but you do, and can send your son or daughter to a second- — 
ary public school four months for $1.48. Now, if you send 
your son or daughter to an academy or college tive months, it 
will, in all, cost you $50 pe# session; $50 minus $1.40 equals 
$48.60, difference in cost of the two per session, and this differ- 
ence is over the left. The average number of school-children 
to the family in Jackson County is tive. So, if such a child 
should enter the academic school at the age of fifteen, and ut- 
tend until he is twenty-one, five months each year, the differ- | 
ence being $48.60 per year, then, for six years, it would be 
$291.60 per capita, over the left. Then, we suppose that all in 
the county are able to send to the secondary schools; so, at a 
difference of $291.60 per capita, it would be, on 5,215 children, 
$253,449.00 for every six years, and for twelve years, $506,898.00. 
“So you see, by adopting the right course, we can save $253,- 
449.00 for every six years.. Will you or not fall into the scho- 
lastic ranks, before it is too late for your children or grand chil- 
dren ? 
“Tet us view it from taxable property. The State annually 
levies .015 on the $1, or 15 cents on the $100 worth of taxable 
_ property, and Jackson County (or the County Court) has levied 
the same this year, both of which make our school-tax for the 
present year 30 cents on the $100 worth of taxable property in 
the county. So, the man who owns a thousand dollar farm 
pays $3 into the hands of the Trustee for schools, and he can 
send five children four months for $3, which is 15 cents per 
month per child. Can any man ask tuition cheaper than this? 
The answer is‘ no.’ So, from this basis, we have the following: 
“Wor a two thousand dollar farm, tuition 30 cents per capita 
per month; for a three thousand dollar farm, 45 cents per cap- 
ita per month; for a four thousand dollar farm, 60 cents per 
capita per month; for a five thousand dollar farm, 75 cents per 
capita per month; for a six thousand dollar farm, 90 cents per 
capita per month; fora seven thousand dollar farm, $1.05 per 
capita per month; for an eight thousand dollar farm, $1.20 per 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  — 186 — 
  capita per month; for a nine thousand dollar farm, $1.35 per 
capita per month; and for a ten thousand dollar farm, $1.50 
per capita per month. So,' you see that the tax-payer on a ten 
thousand dollar farm will save at least $1.50 per capita per 
month, for it will cost $3 tuition per month in a school equal 
to the secondary public school, ard board added, will cost $50 
per session, as stated before. 
“You have been paying $2 poll-tax; so the man who only 
pays a poll-tax of $2, and has five children to send to school 
these four months, pays a very small sum. Now then, let us 
come to the point, and to business. It will take .075 on the 
$100 worth of taxable property in Jackson County to the one 
month of schools. We know this because we have tried it. So 
from this we have the following: For 73 cents, one month 
throughout the county; for 15 cents, two months throughout 
the county; for 223 cents, three months throughout the county ; 
for 30 cents, four months throughout the county; for 37% cents, 
five months throughout the county; for 45 cents, six months 
throughout the county, etc. 
“he secondary school brings the academy home to every 
man’s door; both poor and rich can attend it, and for Jackson 
County children, $253,449.00 every six years; educate all who 
ean and will acquire an education; save the youths from crime 
and disgrace; refine society; make the poor rich in both wis- 
dom and property, and develop both the mental and physical 
powers of our children. 
“ Father or mother, art thou a friend to the poor and to your 
children? If nota friend to the poor, God is not a friend to 
you; and if not a friend to your children, it is a strange thing 
to me. Oh, let loose a little of your money scholastically, 
before the Lord visits the sin of ignorance upon your children 
to the third and fourth generation. 
“But alas! you remind me’‘of the old fable which gives an 
account of several women plucking the feathers from the body 
of one gray goose,,at one time and in various directions, 
which had grown feathers for all the family, and at each! 
pluck the old goose says: ‘Quack, quack, and quit, or I can’t
-P-A-G-E-188
  
ete ee ae rn 
— 187 — 
     stand it, for you pull me in so many directions.’ So it is — 
with the public schools. Some pluck at teachers, some at the 
  houses, some at the books, some at the Directors, some at pay- 
ing taxes, some at others, some at the educated, some at the 
illiterate; some are above the public schools, some below them, 
some too near to it, some too far off, some do away with it, some 
favor it; some oppose the Superintendent,,some think he does 
very well if he was not partial; some call it ‘penny royal,’ and 
it may be called ‘dog fennel’ soon. How can she stand it; or 
have you thought of the institution that has done so much for 
us in Jackson County ? 
“So I write you to consider the foregoing facts, and to instruct 
  the justices of your respective districts upon the subject of ‘ 
- school-tax, for they are at a loss to act in these matters without 
your consent, and, instead of pulling all the scholastic feathers: 
off, please let more grow by taking an interest in this course. 
“ Hoping that you will take more.and better interest than you 
have in days past and gone, I close.” 
JAMES COUNTY. 
J. D. Camppein, Superintendent. 
My tardiness is due solely to the tardiness of the County 
Trustee in making his financial report, which came to me last 
week. 
You will observe that there is a balance of $109.35, which, as 
the Trustee says, was carried over from 1890. 
~ You will notice that the grade of our teachers is much better 
than it was last year. Last year only eight first-grade certiti- 
cates were issued. This year there were twenty. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
      — 188 — : 
Last July we held’ a County Normal at Apison for five days. 
Nearly every teacher in the county was present. I considered 
that the topical outlines of the subjects were the only normal 
idea, and therefore we used that system to the exclusion of all 
others. I had the teachers all to take the outlines of the various 
subjects each day for the day following, and appointed one of 
the group to conduet the recitation on one subject that was out- 
lined the day previous. In other words, we had the actual class 
work performed, which tested the ability to teach. The teach- 
ers seemed interested, and are still doing good work in the 
schools. : 
Prof. Loudon, of the Knoxville schools, and Col. Parker, of 
Ooltewah, were with us nearly the whole term, and rendered 
most valuable services, for which we tender our heartfelt thanks. 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
D. C. Hrin, Superintendent. 
I have visited every school in the county, white and colored ; 
made brief talks to each, with few exceptions. Have held five 
Institutes—two for the colored teachers. Total number’ of. 
‘teachers’ meetings, ten. I am glad to note that some of the 
parents are becoming interested in Institutes, and coming out to 
see what the teachers are doing. The annual Normal of one 
week was held at Maury Academy, July 4 to 9, inclusive, con- 
ducted by Prof. J. T. Henderson, president of the Carson & 
Newman College, assisted by Professors Hicks, Garrett, Zirkle, 
and other able instructors. -An examination was held at the 
close of each day of the Normal work in one or two of the 
branches of the public school course, and it proved to be a suc-
-P-A-G-E-190
  — 189 — ; 
cess in every particular. There were fifty-five teachers in at- | 
tendance. I am indebted to the Revs. Carter, Helm, Jones, and 
' Hon. Henry R. Gibson for their excellent and instructive lect- 
ures during the Normal. Nine teachers failed on examination - 
and several others were very much dissatistied with second- 
grade certificates ; said they had always gotten first-grade cer- 
tificates, and were very much disappointed. Considerable in- 
terest was manifested in the Normal. 
I held a one week’s Normal for the colored teachers, and am | 
glad to say that eighty-five per cent. of the teachers were pres- 
ent, and manifested a greater interest in the Normal work than 
the whites. 
JOHNSON COUNTY. 
R. P. Donnutty, Superintendent. 
Tam glad to say that the educational interest of this county 
is gradually improving. The attendance is better, the enroll- 
, ment larger, and the interest greater than was shown last year. 
The graded system is in good working order in the majority 
of the schools of the county. Patrons are beginning to sce its 
advantages, and are creating an interest by the discussion of its 
merits. The majority of our teachers are alive to the work, and 
are trying to do good, honest service. The one thing we lack 
in this county is more school-funds. If we had the money we 
should have, our schools could be worked up to a higher 
standard. Our Justices are beginning to see this, and we hope 
to have an increase soon. 
The future prospects for our schools are brightening, and we 
hope to take advantage of the “light,” and push the work so as 
to accomplish the best results.

KNOX COUNTY. 
J. C. Forp, Superintendent. 
The public schools of Knox County are in great favor with 
our people. I have been especially directing my official atten- 
tion to the patrons of our schools by having educational meet- - 
ings in various parts of the county. In these meetings the 
people are urged to take personal interest in the welfare of 
their individual schools; to join hands with the teachers in 
building up a first-class school. As before stated, there is an 
increased interest manifested by the patrons of our common 
schools. 
We are endeavoring to establish one secondary school for 
each district in the county. Too much care cannot be taken Ss in establishing these schools. Great good can and will be ac- 
complished in the proper establishment of secondary schools, 
and great harm may be done in the improper establishment of, 
the same. 
It is absolutely necessary to keep the two classes of our schools 
—primary and secondary—separate and distinct. If not so kept 
they will be blended together, and the primary school, the most 
important class, will lose its identity, which will prove ruinous 
to our system. It is far better to have a good primary school 
than a poor secondary school. , 
Our County Institute met in connection with the State Teach- 
ers’ Institute, at the University of Tennessee, July 11 to 22, 1892. 
This was one of the largest and most interesting Institutos ever 
had in the State. There was an enrollment of two hundred 
and sixty-five teachers. The teachers manifested more interest 
in the normal training than ever before. This was an Institute 
which both the city schools and those of the county schools at- 
tended en masse.” : 
The colored teachers Courty Institute met in connection with 
the State Normal Institute for colored teachers, on the 6th day
-P-A-G-E-192
  — 191 — 
of June, 1892, in the public hall of the court-house, lasting one 
week. Sixty-five teachers were in attendance, representing 
eight counties of East Tennessee and the State of North Caro- 
lina. The colored teachers of Knox County are doing much 
‘toward the education and elevation of their race. 
The Knox County teachers’ library is in great favor with 
the teachers of the county. This feature of our school-work is 
a source of much information and improvement for the teachers 
and pupils of our schools. The library is being increased with ex- 
cellent books of various kinds. The record shows that there has 
been a monthly average of fifteen thousand pages read from the 
library: It is now established on a permanent basis, and, with 
the proper effort, Knox County will have a library that will stand 
as a monument to the intelligence of her people, and from which 
the people of the county may gain information, without the use 
of which they would never acquire. 
The celebration of “Columbus Day” in our schools on the 
21st day of October, 1892, will be a memorable day in the his- 
tory of our schools. : 
LAKE COUNTY. 
L. Donaupson, Superintendent. 
Tam much pleased with the new amendments of our school- | 
_ law, and fully believe that when it is well understood by Di- 
rectors and teachers it will bring forth an abundant harvest. It 
takes time to change a system, but I have endeavored by all 
means in my power to give emphasis tosame. : ee 
Tn one or two of our best schools, I find that the reward of 
certificates has stimulated the pupils to rapid advancement. I 
have delivered fourteen of these certificates to the pupils of one _ 
secondary school. I find, too, that the system of examinations — 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  — 192 — 
  necessary to obtain these certificates and diplomas make the in- 
struction more thorough. 
There is a great loss to the school-revenue of my county on 
account of the Trustee not having the power to distrain for 
poll-tax as soon as the books come into his hands. _The conse- 
quence is, that transient tax-payers get away before the time 
for such distraint, and we lose much revenue. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
Mrs. L. A. Warkrns, Superintendent. 
Tam pleased to state there has been a gradual and steady im- 
provement, both in interest and attendance, in our public schools 
for the last year. I regret to say that so far I have been un- 
able to grade a single school, owing to such a diversity of text- 
books used in the schools. -Although we have had, for the last 
five years, an adopted series in a number of the districts, yet, 
their use has not been ‘enforced, and we had as well not have 
‘any. Until the school-law is so amended as to require teachers 
and Directors to enforce the use of an adopted series of text- 
hooks, I very much fear that it will be quite awhile before we 
can hope for a regular system of graded schools. 
Another amendment I think decidedly necessary. That is, 
transfer the authority to adopt text-books into other hands. 
Nearly every District Director in this county has expressed 
himself as feeling entirely incompetent to judge of the merits, 
etc., of text-books, from the fact their attention is directed in ~ 
other channels, and they do not have the time to examine said 
books. I am sure that many of our District Directors will 
compare favorably with those of other counties. 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
— 193 — 
  But few teachers take any interest in Institutes or Institute 
work, and I have almost despaired of accomplishing any thing 
in that line. From time to time I have called teachers’ meet- _ 
ings, and only about six or eight of the most progressive teach- 
ers would attend. 
We need a larger school-fund, but fear we are to have less, 
since our County Court has so far failed to levy any tax for 
that purpose for another year. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
J. R. Wiuuramson, Superintendent. 
  
We have held several very successful meetings of teachers 
and officers, which we trust will result in great good to all. 
While our teachers do not take that interest they should, they 
are manifesting more than they ever have in the past. 
Quite a number of our schools observed the 21st with ap- 
propriate exercises, making it a day that will ever remain ver- ~ 
dant on memory’s page. 
We have a number of new School Directors, who have been 
very slow in sending reports, but I think this is nearly correct. 
LEWIS COUNTY. 
J. R. Brown, Superintendent. 
‘ 
I have not succeeded yet in getting teachers and district clerks 
to make their reports on time, but, by visiting the districts, and 
13 Supt. Pub. Instrue.
-P-A-G-E-195
oe 
helping to make out reports, I think I have been able to get up 
all the items that are essential. 5 
Our schools are in better condition than they have been here- 
tofore, and the next annual report, I think, will show quite an 
increase in the attendance. 
Our teachers seem to be alive, and working earnestly. 
MACON COUNTY. 
J. C. Pricz, Superintendent. 
Our schools are doing very well, taking every thing into con- 
sideration; notwithstanding, there is great room for improve- 
ment. But, since I organized a County Teachers’ Association, 
there seems to be new life infused in the teachers of the whole 
county. 
Taking every thing as a whole, I think we can compare fa- 
vorably with any county in the State in education, although 
our resources are limited. One thing we need badly is more 
money to make our school-term longer. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
Tuomas H. Draxn, Superintendent. 
The people depend almost entirely on our public schools for 
the education of their children, and I take this as an evidence 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  — 195 — 
that they are reasonably well conducted, and that they are gen- 
erally satisfactory to patrons. Great improvement can yet be 
made in them, but I do not think it can be reached by any com- 
pulsory radical change. : 
Isend you a circular of grades and text-books prepared by 
me for this county, and which has been placed -in the hands of 
teachers and school-officers throughout the county. 
I think the State Normal, which you so kindly located here 
last June, afforded great pleasure to all who attended, and that 
it gave an inspiration to many country teachers that will result 
in good. 
MAURY COUNTY. 
J. Mituzr, Superintendent. 
I think I may say the majority of our schools are in good 
condition. A great many of our schools are well supplied with 
maps, charts, etc. I am glad to note increased enrollment and 
daily attendance. ; 
The late amendments to the school-law have given eminent 
satisfaction. We have had a uniform series of text-books in 
this county for several years, and at the beginning of last year 
we formulated and published a graded course of study for all 
_ the schools, a copy of which is herewith sent you. Our colored 
schools are improving rapidly. They are striving for an educa- 
tion, and many of their teachers are doing excellent work. 
Many of our older teachers—“old field ‘school-keepers”’—are 
giving place to young men and women, who expect to make 
teaching their profession. While our schools are not yet what 
I would like for them to be, I think we are improving. Many 
‘of our teachers have made special preparation for school-work, 
and they are doing their part well. You will notice I have not
-P-A-G-E-197
  — 196 — 
reported on grades. While many teachers graded, others made 
no effort to grade, and, as I cannot report correctly and fully, I 
prefer to omit it altogether. 
In conclusion, taking it altogether, I think the outlook for 
the schools of Maury is more encouraging. 
McMINN COUNTY. 
Junta A. Smitu, Superintendent. 
I take pleasure in submitting to you my second annual report 
of the schools of McMinn County, and report some improve- 
ment along the line. 
We held our annual Normal at Athens during the last days 
of June; attendance better than has been known for a number 
of years. This was pronounced the best Normal McMinn 
County has ever had. Quite a number of educators were pres- 
ent, and all seemed very much interested. I had worked up 
considerable interest among Directors, but new ones. going in at 
August election has caused some trouble. I find it hard to get 
teachers to take the interest they should in teachers’ meetings. 
We are grading schools this year, though it will be some time 
before we can make a success of the work. 
MONROE COUNTY. 
8. G. Grupreatu, Superintendent. 
We have better schools this year than heretofore—better 
taught, better disciplined, productive of more real benefit to the
-P-A-G-E-198
Be 97 =< 
  children. The adopted series of text-books is being used in all 
‘parts of the county more than in any year previous. 
The teachers are sending in their monthly reports regularly. 
Our County Normal continued seven days; nearly one hun- 
dred teachers in attendance; conducted by Professors Bachman, 
of Sweetwater, and Caulkins, of Chattanooga. Valuable as- 
sistance was rendered by President Pritchett, of Hiwassee; J. 
C. Hicks, W. M. Harrison, E. C. Miller, J. P. Hicks, Misses 
Josie Meek, Sallie. Dyer, and others. The examination was 
rigid. Several failed, and their prospective positions filled with 
good teachers. 
Weare in a more prosperous condition financially than ever — 
before. Our County Court entertains liberal views in regard to 
public education. Therefore, all things considered, we can re- 
port sure and steady progress. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
P. L. Harnep, Superintendent. 
  
I have made an extra effort to get a correct report this year, 
am very well satisfied with the results. The County Court has 
furnished a room in the court-house for the County Superin- 
tendent’s office, and that is now the best-furnished room in the — 
‘ building. 
We have started the Montgomery County Teachers’ Library, 
and about one hundred dollars’ worth of books have already 
been bought. Our teachers meet the first Saturday in each 
month at the Superintendent’s office to discuss school-matters, 
and they seem in earnest about their work. 
Our work is more satisfactory than ever before, and we ex- 
_ pect better results from every district in the county.

MORGAN COUNTY. 
J. N. Nexpuam, Superintendent. 
This report is approximately correct. I say approximately 
correct, because our teachers failed to comply with our system 
of grading. I have been visiting schools for two or three weeks, 
_and, I am proud to say, our teachers are taking a great interest 
in the work. They seem to understand their duty as to grading 
a great deal better this year than last. 
You will see in my report that the average number of days 
taught during the year is given at-ninety-eight. By this I mean 
the average length of our schools in days. 
With few exceptions, our teachers are alive to their duty in 
methods, Institutes, and school-work in general. | \ 
We build a few houses every year, and I am sure Morgan ~ 
County will soon have houses sufficient to accommodate all her 
children. We cannot expect our teachers to do good work un- 
less they are supplied with every thing necessary. 
Our County Institute, held in July, was a success. It was 
conducted by Prof. D. R. Case, and was the best Institute the 
county has ever had. 
We have almost a new Board of Directors, and I am made 
to believe they mean to perform their duty to the best of their 
ability. ‘ 
We have established a colored school, the first that has been 
in the county for seventeen years. 
We need longer schools, and the County Superintendent paid 
a salary that will justify him in devoting his entire time to the 
business.

OBION COUNTY. 
T. H. Jackson, Superintendent. 
I was elected to fill the unexpired term of Superintendent J. 
M. Benton at the April term of the County Court. My first 
work was to secure an appropriation of money with which to 
hold the two Institutes. One of these was $100, the other $50, 
making a total of $150. The Institute for whites was conducted 
by Prof. R. E. Crockett, principal of Elkton Preparatory School, 
Elkton, Ky. He was ably assisted by Mrs. W. R. Duncan, prin- 
cipal of Mason Hall Academy, Mason Hall, Tenn. The num- 
ber in attendance at the Institute for white teachers was not less 
than an average of one hundred. This Institute was the most 
largely attended ever held in the county. This was immediately 
_ followed by the annual examination of teachers. As a result of 
this and subsequent examinations, all the teachers of this county 
have been subjected to rigid tests, the results of which are now 
on file in my office. The colored Institute was conducted by 
Prof. H. 8. H. Boykin, Rives, Tenn. 
In my visitation of schools, I find the teachers progressive in 
their work, clearly showing the beneficial results from Institute 
_and examination work. 
By the co-operation of the leading teachers, I organized an 
association of the teachers, and, by a strong effort, have in- 
duced a majority of the teachers to take an interest in it. 
These meetings are greatly encouraged by the attendance at 
their sittings of the citizens resident at the several appoint-, 
ments. This association is doing a manifest -good by causing — 
the various teachers to become acquainted, and by aiding an 
exchange of ideas. Among the most pleasant and helpful oc- 
-easions of the association work was that at which we attended 
your address delivered in Union City. 
_ Thave encouraged the grading of all schools as provided by 
law. In many cases, teachers are making much more strenuous
-P-A-G-E-201
    900, 
efforts to execute this direction than has been done at any pre- 
vious time. j 
In this connection, 1 want to make favorable mention of the 
efficient service of the local press in furthering the general and 
specific cause of education in this county. Not only with open 
columns have they come to our assistance, but in editorial ca- 
pacity have they assailed the prevailing systems of ‘“ fogyism,” 
that we may obtain competent workers for the many places of 
responsibility. 
___ It is my desire to issue, at an early date, a catalogue of infor- 
" mation for all school-officers in the county. This will contain 
methods for grading, classification, and general school manage- 
ment. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
M. J. Serser, Superintendent. 
I have visited all the schools in my county once, and some 
twice, this year. Have spent all the time that was in my power 
to do lecturing the pupils and assisting; young teachers. Have 
tried to impress upon teachers the importance of carrying 
pupils in all the branches of that grade to which they belong. 
Our schools in this county, with very few exceptions, have 
gone along smoothly this year, and there seems to be a ce 
interest manifested among our people. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the growth in education for — 
the past three years has been good, and we have accomplished 
a great deal in improving the methods of teaching in the public 
schools of our county, there remains a great deal yet to be done 
to make our public schools what they should be, and what is 
f ”
-P-A-G-E-202
  — 201 — 
in the reach of our people to make them. We need a stronger 
school-fund to make our school-term longer, and pay our. 
teachers and County Superintendent better. 
I held a County Normal at Livingston, which commenced 
the 5th of July, and continued ten days. There were ninety 
teachers attended. We held the normal in the court-house, 
and at every meeting the house was crowded with spectators, 
who seemed to manifest great interest in the work that was 
being done, both by the teachers and our principal instructor, 
Prof. A. H. Roberts. So the people begin to see what the 
County Normai has done for education in Overton County. 
_ Our teachers’ association, which meets the first Saturday in 
each month, has been very well attended this year, both by 
teachers and people. 
We have only one secondary school established in this 
county as yet. That one is at Livingston, under the super- 
vision of Prof. A. J. Taylor. 
Teachers are beginning to hold examinations in their schools 
for certificates. I think we have quite a number of students — 
who will pass from the 5th grade this year. 
PERRY COUNTY. , W. R. Tompson, Superintendent. 
‘ % 
Ihave been trying some time to get teachers to grade the 
schools of Perry County. They say it is impossible for them 
to do so with the books they now have. 
’ Education is advancing in this county slowly, but we are get- 
ting better teachers every year, which will some day in the near 
future cause Perry to have a good school in every district in the

county. The greatest drawback to education in this county is 
the unaccountable decrease in attendance. Sometimes I find a 
large school when it first begins, and by the time the school is 
half out the scholars have almost all quit. I hope to see the 
time when we will have a uniform system of books and good 
attendance. It is strange that any civilized people will live 
close to a good school and keep their children at home. Let us 
have longer schools, better teachers, better attendance, and, in 
the near’future, we will have a prosperous people. 
PUTNAM COUNTY. 
  
W. H. Carr, Superintendent. 
  
My report is nearly correct. In some few cases I have had 
_ to approximate. I can say with great pleasure that the educa- 
3 
j tional work in Putnam County is making rapid progress. 
Directors have taken greater interest than any year before. A 
great number of our teachers are doing noble work.this year, 
- and they deserve much credit for the interest and energy they 
have displayed in their schools. 
Our Teachers’ Institute, held in June, and conducted by Prof. 
8. B. Yeargan, was a complete success. 
I visited sixty-three schools during the year, and found them 
nearly all doing good work. The outlook for our schools is en- 
couraging. 
HHEA COUNTY. 
W.E. Srepuens, Superintendent. 
  
The schools of this county are doing well. Many schools 
- have recently been supplied with new desks.

The State Institute you gave us, at Dayton, with Prof. Carnes 
as conductor, and Profs. Weber and Loudon as instructors, has 
done a great good for the school interests of this county. 
ROANE COUNTY. 
Miss Lucy Smrru, Superintendent. 
Tam much pleased with the improvement in our educational 
work. The Directors and teachers are taking an interest in the 
work and the improvement is great, but, owing to the financial 
affairs of our county, the school-term will be short. The 
Trustee was behind $10,762. : 
I have visited all the schools in the county. They are doing 
good work. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
J. E. Rurrin, Superintendent. 
I herewith forward my sixth annual report of the schools of 
Robertson County. It is as nearly correct as I can make it 
from reports of Directors and from memoranda taken when 
visiting. Our Trustee is never able to make a correct itemized 
report of the expenditures, owing to the failure of Directors to 
state for what warrants are drawn.» The amount reported on 
hand at close of last report does not correspond with that on 
hand at the beginning of this, but I think the latter correct. ’ 
I think more schools would have been reported graded, but the

seachers happened to have the old abstracts. The secondary 
seachers, for the same reason, did not report number enrolled 
in the studies of the three higher grades. 
I think most of my teachers are determined to make an 
honest effort to grade their schools this year, and I hope you 
all get a better report from this county next year. 
RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
\ N. D. Overatr, Superintendent. 
Schools are doing well. We have a more enthusiastic, ener- 
 getic list of teachers; hence, more interest in schools. 
My last summer’s Institute was the best attended, most en- 
_thusiastic, and most successfully conducted Institute ever held 
in the county, and for this success I am under especial obliga- 
tions to Prof. R. A. Clark, Winchester; Miss Maud Terrill, 
: Decherd; Prof. A. C. Speer, Feris, Texas, and Prof. A. J. 
Brandon, Jackson, Tenn. j 
_ Weare very proud of a very fine teachers’ circulating library 
_ of about 75 volumes on teaching. We have monthly examina- 
tions of applicants, and monthly teachers’ meetings for both 
"white and colored. . 
SCOTT COUNTY. 
C. C. Cross, Superintendent. 
We have made considerable progress, though our schools are 
not perfect. We are getting the schools graded in very good

shape. I visited all the schools of my county once, and most 
of them twice. I found them generally doing well. It is 
claimed that we have better schools in the county this year 
than ever before. 
We had a splendid normal this year—beginning June 27, 
closed July 7—conducted by Miss Julia A. Doak, of Nashville. 
If asked to define a normal, we would say a normal is Miss 
Doak on the rostrum and an attentive audience before her. 
We had good attendance at Normal Institute—about fifty. 
Held examination at close. Quite a lot failed to obtain certifi- 
eates. Education in old Scott must progress. We think she 
is up with any mountain county in the State, and, erelong, will 
be one of the leading counties in Tennessee in the way of edu- 
cation. 
We are making preparations to celebrate Columbus Day in 
grand style. We expect to have Arbor Day in November, and 
_also to do all we can to advance the cause of education.

SEQUATCHIE COUNTY. 
Mrs. E. J. Tuaxton, Superintendent. 
_ I regret very much that I have been so slow in sending my 
~ second annual report of Sequatchie County schools. Some of 
_ the Directors have failed to give a correct report of finances. 
_ Teould not find the expenses from the Trustee’s books, so am 
forced to send it incomplete in cash expenses. 
Tn some parts of the county the mode of education has im- 
proved, but most of the schools have had only three months’ 
a duration, The present scholastic population is 1,263, an in- 
-erease on last year. The teachers receive ample alae for. 
- the number of students in some schools is small.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
W.S. OatE, Superintendent. 
It affords me great pleasure to be able to report to you that 
within the last year we have made considerable advancement i in 
the educational work on different lines. 
I held the annual Normal Institute in Murphy College, in 
Sevierville, assisted by Profs. L. 8. Fuller and W.S. Bryan. 
_ This was the largest attended and most successful Normal ever 
held in the county, enrolling nearly every teacher in the county, 
and a large number of School-directors and patrons of the public 
schools. 
The plan of holding our local teachers’ meetings has been 
changed, and the new plan is working nicely and giving gen- 
eral satisfaction. 
Our county meetings of School-directors are doing a good 
_ work in systematizing the educational work, and making a noted. 
progress towards efficiency in the management of the public 
“schools on the part of the Directors, The most important 
feature of our last meeting, which was very largely attended 
by both Directors and the people generally, was the adoption 
of a uniform plan or system by which all the schools of the 
county are to be let out each year; also unanimously passing a 
resolution discouraging the employment of second-grade teach- 
ers as far as possible, and favoring the employment of first-grade 
teachers and those who are preparing themselves for the work, 
and paying them what they are worth. 
I am proud to be able to report to you that we have had 
splendid success in grading the schools during the last year. I 
have visited nearly all the schools in the county, and have found 
them very nicely classified and graded, with few exceptions in 
some of the rural districts, which are not making much advance- , 
ment on this line. 
After spending some time at each school, classifying when © 
necessarry, and witnessing the method of instruction and dis- 
\ 
 
-P-A-G-E-208

cipline of the school, have generally, before leaving, made. 
_ short addresses in way of encouragement, ete. 
During the last year I furnished each teacher with blanks 
upon which to make monthly reports to my office, and by this 
means, in addition to visiting the schools in person, I am en- 
abled to note the condition and progress of each school at the 
end of every month. I also furnished all the teachers with a 
printed list of questions and instructions for holding a uniform 
examination in all the different grades in the public schools of 
Sevier County, and tickets of promotion through the several 
grades to be issued to those who pass on the examination. A 
copy of each I inclose herewith. 
Two common school diplomas and eight common school cer- 
_tificates have been issued within the last year. 
By examining my statistical report and comparing it with 
former reports, you will see that there is an increase in the en- 
rollment and daily attendance. It will algo be seen that the 
enrollment and average attendance in our private schools is 
larger than ever before. 
SHELBY COUNTY. 
Miss Nutiie O’Donnett, Superintendent. 
In this, my fourth annual report, it is my pleasure to note 
many improvements made in our schools within the past year. 
With but few exceptions, every school in the county is prop- 
erly graded. Sixteen new houses have been erected during 
the year. Nearly all of our teachers are men and women who 
have made special preparations for school-work. I have visited 
most of the schools of the county, and I know that earnest and 
_ intelligent work is being done. To improve the schools of this 
county is the earnest desire of the patrons, Directors, and 
teachers.

SMITH COUNTY. 
J. G. Brown, Superintendent. 
The schools are not just what they should be, but are still 
improving in many respects. The year, ending June 30, had 
an average term of 105 days, the longest known in the history 
of the county. 
The report by grades is not made this time, because the 
teachers did not have registers and abstracts suitable for keep- 
ing the proper records. The schools, however, are graded, and 
a proper record is being kept, so that every thing desired can 
_ be reported next year. 
The work done by Prof. W. D. Mooney at our summer In- — 
stitute was highly appreciated, and has resulted in much good 
_ forthe schools. Ife was very popular with our people, and they 
  would be glad to have him with them again. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
J. A. Corren, Superintendent. 
I have made every effort to have this report correct. While 
our schools are not what I would have them, there is a kinder 
feeling on the part of the people toward the public school 
system, and I believe, if money matters were not so tight, our 
schools would advance rapidily. I inclose you list of teachers 
in my county. Will send list of Directors and other informa- 
tion desired as soon a8 I can obtain it.

UNICOI COUNTY. 
R. W. H. Gitzert, Superintendent. 
Waele: i ‘ 
There has been a decided improvement in the condition of | 
the schools of Unicoi County since my former report to you. 
In the year ending June 30, 1891, the reports showed less than 
50 per cent. of the scholastic population had been enrolled in 
the schools, while the reports show that for the year ending 
June 80, 1892, there has been over 88 per cent. of the whole 
scholastic population enrolled, showing a gain of over 88 per 
cent. in a single year. I hope this year to be able to still in- 
crease the percentage of enrollment, until every child entitled 
to attend school has been enrolled. 
The academy at Erwin is doing good work, and offering op- 
portunities of education to many youths who are not financially 
able to attend academies or colleges away from home. What 
we need, most of all, is a good college building in Erwin, fur- 
nished with all modern appliances; but we mean to erect sucha 
building next year, and bring to Erwin pupils from a distance, 
instead of our young people leaving Erwin in quest of oppor- _ 
tunities denied them here; for, when we have the building, we 
can support a schoo] that will compare favorably with any in 
_ the land. 
UNION COUNTY.

i T am glad to say that our schools are improving. The teach- 
ers are taking more interest in Institutes than they ever have. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
F. T. Warts, Superintendent. 
I find it very difficult to get the Directors to do their duty. 
Some failed to make a full report and others failed to make it 
on time. Directors should not have longer than the 15th of 
August to make their complete reports. As it is, they have 
until the 15th of September, and this gives the County Super- 
intendent only fifteen days to get up his report, and, probably, 
then he will have to write to one-fourth of them, or ride to see 
them, and it is no little job to ride over a large county to spur 
up the Directors. The law should give the County Superin- 
tendent more power to enforce the school law. The County 
- Superintendent, teachers, and Directors need hustling up. alk 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
— 211 — 
‘along the line. The State Superintendent should furnish the 
examination questions. 
Notwithstanding all of this, Washington County has as good, 
if not better, schools than the majority of the counties in the 
State. We drew $2.50, last year, per scholar, and the money 
was ready any time the teachers called for it. 
~ Our summer Normal was certainly a success—well attended 
and great interest manifested. 
Johnson City has two fine public school buildings. The 
schools there are under the care of Superintendent Freeland. 
He is doing a good work, and is simply the right man in the 
right place. Jonesboro and Fall Branch both have excellent 
graded schools. Washington College, the oldest school in the 
State, is well attended and doing good work. 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
Mrs. L. T. Smyrun, Superintendent. 
  
I think our schools are gradually improving. We have a 
better class of teachers than we had three years ago. Our best 
teachers are remaining, and-good ones coming into our county. 
‘ 
Bo WHITE COUNTY. 
  
R. L. Jonzs, Superintendent. 
  
Our line of work has been pretty much in the same channel 
as last year. We have kept this point constantly in view—a \
-P-A-G-E-213
— 212 —       
   school cannot rise above its teacher—and, in view of this fact, 
we have made our examinations more rigid, and have held 
more Institutes this year than ever before. 
The old “ moss-backs” have almost wholly disappeared, and 
we have, in their stead, a set of energetic young men and 
women, who are aiming to make teaching a profession. We 
_. hold monthly Institutes the entire year for the white teachers, 
and semi-monthly meetings for the colored teachers while their 
_ schools are in progress. 
  We held a two-weeks’ Institute at Doyle College, beginning 
July 4th. Every teacher who taught in the county, with the 
exception of four, was present. Probably the cause of this un- 
usually good attendance is due to the fact that almost all the 
Directors of the county positively refuse to hire a teacher who 
will not attend the Institutes. If all the Directors in the 
State would pass similar resolutions, it would go far toward 
making every Institute a success. 
    We were assisted in our Institute work by the following 
teachers of the county, viz.: SLOSS Ww. H. Taylor, J. W. 
McPeak, T. B. Sparkman, J. F. Taylor, 8S. H. Proffitt, R. L. 
Proffitt, W. F. M. Russell, A. J. Trail, W. W. Young, W. E. 
Shockley, Thos. Finly, D. L. ieagstien: W. F. McManus, and 
E.C. Mason. In addition to the help of our own county teach- 
ers, we were ably assisted by Miss Chloe Dement, Hermitage, 
Prof. W. N. Billingsley, president of Burritt College, and Prof. 
C. J. Denton, president of Pure Fountain College, and several 
others too numerous to mention. Our enrollment of teachers 
at this Institute reached one hundred and fifteen, the largest 
number ever in attendance before. We also held a three-days’ 
Institute for the colored teachers, which was well attended, 
there being more present than could get schools. Taking it as 
a whole, I think our Institutes, both white and abigce bere 
been a success. 
      f We have visited all the schools of the county, with one ex- 
ception, and find most of them in good working.order. Our 
honorable County Court has raised our school.tax from thirty- 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
— 213 — 
   five to forty cents on the hundred dollars, which gives us a per 
capita this year of two dollars, the largest we have ever had. 
White County has built twenty-five framed school-houses in 
_ the past six years, yet we need twenty more. In fact, we need 
more money, better houses, fewer schools, better teachers, and 
a better Superintendent wouldn’t hurt. 
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
Joun A. Minter, Superintendent. 
_ It affords me pleasure to be able to report to you that the 
year ending June 30, 1892, has been one of marked improve- 
ment in our public schools. Williamson County has cause to 
be proud of her schools. In conclusion, I would say that our 
schools are certainly improving, and the outlook for the future 
is indeed promising. 
  
WILSON COUNTY. 
H. R. Birewerr, Superintendent. 
We are proud to state that our county has made reasonable 
progress in the different educational lines. 
The Teachers’ Institute, held at Watertown, July 4 to 16, was 
‘one of the largest and most important meetings ever held in 
the county. The first week was conducted as a county, and 
the second week as a State Institute. Circulars were issued to 
the effect that the entire term would be conducted as a County 
Institute, but, through the efforts of Prof. F. M. Bowling and ; i 
the é Superintendent, arrangements were madé whereby 
ox » y i 
2   ‘
-P-A-G-E-215
  ‘ — 214 — 
the last week was conducted as a State Institute, with Prof. W. 
D. Mooney, of Franklin, as conductor, and Profs. F. M. Bowl- 
ing, J. W. Patton, J. W. Bryan, Miss Lizzie Clark, of Win- 
chester Normal, and Miss Emma Jarrell, as assistants. The at- 
tendance the first week was about sixty, but, at the end of the 
‘second week, it increased until we enrolled eighty-three, just 
double the attendance at the Institute the previous year. Prof. - 
W. D. Mooney, together with his able assistants, did some of 
the best Institute work ever done in Wilson County. 
The people of the community manifested a great interest by 
attending en masse each daily meeting. During the term we 
had many interesting lectures, delivered by prominent citizens 
of Watertown and other noted educators, among them the 
following: Drs. Baker, Blair, Batten, Prof. Washburn, Rev. 
E. S. Bryan, Hon. R. McMillan, and Prof. C. L. Hayes. Two 
of the most -characteristic lectures were delivered by Hon. R. 
McMillan, member of the General Assembly, on the public 
school system, and Prof. C. L. Hayes, principal of the Cooke- 
ville High School, on the subject of grading the schools. The 
: Tngtitute closed with the annual examination. Thus closed the 
most successful Institute Wilson County has ever had. Many 
of the teachers expressed their desire that our worthy State . 
Superintendent grant us another State Institute, with Prof. W. 
D. Mooney as conductor, and the same able assistants, next 
year. — : 
While we have made ‘some progress toward grading the 
schools, it seems (from various reasons) we have not accom- 
plished what we should. 
We have tried to discourage the second-class certificate by 
refusing. to renew any of them at all. In some cases, where the 
qualifications of applicants were personally known to the Su- 
perintendent, we have renewed without. examination the first- 
grade certificates. . 
Saturday is still retained as our office day, on which is trans- 
acted all business connected with the schools. 
While the schools in Wilson County are not what we would 
like to see them, yet we are glad to report that they are taking 
steps toward advancement.

Report of the Board of T rustees 
* UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE 
Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
TWO YEARS ENDING DECEMBER 20, 1892. 
Sir—The Board of Trustees of the University of Tennessee 
respectfully submit this, their biennial report for the two years 
ending December 20, 1892, in accordance with the law (the 
Code, Section 337), which requires that “they shall make a 
report to each biennial session of the’ Legislature, giving the 
number of students, together with a detailed statement of the 
workings of the institution, and of receipts and expenditures.” 
Weare glad to be able to report again that the University 
has continued to prosper, and has extended its influence in 
many new directions. 
Among material improvements, we can mention ‘the comple- 
tion of the Science Hall, commenced in 1890; the erection of a 
building for a gymnasium and the use of the Young Men’s 
Christian Association of the University; the complete re- 
- modeling and refurnishing of the academic building known as 
South College, and the erection of two additional houses for 
professors.
-P-A-G-E-220
  SO Ore 
  The opening of Science Hall was celebrated in due manner 
at commencement, in June, 1892, and it was regularly occupied — 
by the several schools at the opening of the present session. 
The Science Hall is an imposing structure of brick and stone, 
four stories in height, with a slate roof, having an area of about 
30,000 square feet of floor space, besides a large basement. It 
is a simple development of Romanesque architecture. Its chief 
feature is a beautiful tower, rising one hundred and fifty feet 
from foundation to finial, with an open observatory. The south 
wing contains the auditorium and physical laboratory; the large’ 
north wing, the chemical laboratories, library, engineering 
rooms, and the oflices of the President. 
_ Fronting the entrance is the handsome reception-room, and 
to the right is the auditorium. The latter, a spacious room, has 
an inclined floor, set with opera chairs, and a large gallery, set 
with benches. It has a seating capacity of seven hundred. 
Especial attention has been paid to the lighting and ventilation | 
here. The platform is provided with all the conveniences for 
scientific and other lectures, and there is a large projecting 
lantern for purposes of illustration. A grand pipe organ stands 
‘in the gallery. 
The distinctive feature of the building is its system of heat- 
ing and ventilating? The “direct-indirect” system is used, in ~ 
which the radiators are so constructed that fresh, warm airis — 
brought into the building. The foul air is taken out at the — 
floor and ceiling by means of twenty-one stacks, ten of which, 
eighty-five feet high, are in the centre of the building. The 
building is lighted with incandescent electric lights. ly 
On the first floor, south end, are the laboratories of the. 
School of Physics, paved with asphalt, resting upon the 
ground, in order to give a firm foundation for instruments of 
precision. They are splendidly lighted through numerous 
large windows. Two Edison dynamos (one hundred and 
twenty-five volts) furnish the electric current. The gas, 
water, steam, and drain-pipes are in trenches, covered with 
marble slabs. The lecture-room has raised seats; a conveni- | 
ently arranged lecture-table, provided with gas, water, and’
-P-A-G-E-221
    electric current ; windows arranged to be darkened at pleasure- 
for lantern illustrations, ete. 
The assay laboratory is also on the first floor, and is equipped 
with a Blake ore-crusher, a heavy pulverizing plate, a new gold 
and silver smelting furnace, a gold and silver cupelling and 
refining furnace, and many other interesting appliances. 
The chemical laboratories are located on the second or main 
floor, north wing. They are supplied with an abundance of 
light from large windows, and ventilated by ten stacks, and ele- 
gantly furnished with well-contrived desks, hoods, sinks, ete. 
On the second floor from the entrance are the President’s 
handsomely furnished office and reception-room. The re- 
mainder of this floor is devoted to the library. 
The fourth floor (third from entrance) is occupied by the 
School of Civil Engineering. It contains a large draught- 
ing-hall, magnificently lighted and supplied with adjustable 
draughting-stands, etc.; dark-room for making blue prints and 
photographs; laboratory with water-tanks, weighing-scales, 
and testing-machine, with micrometer and other appliances ; 
laboratory and museum for specimens, engineering materials 
and devices; an engineering instrument-room, with lockers for 
the individual instruments; professor’s office, and store-room 
_ for maps, drawings, ete. : 
The building erected by the Young Men’s Christian Associ- 
ation of the University has also been completed and occupied 
since our last report. . It is a substantial structure of pressed 
brick and stone; covered with slate, and was planned with 
special reference to its uses. It is considered by those who 
have seen many such buildings to be the model of its kind. 
The building contains, in addition to the usual offices, a parlor, 
a reading-room, an assembly room, and a large gymnasium 
' fitted with the best apparatus, in connection with which are 
baths, lockers, ete., which is open to all the students of the 
University. An instructor is provided by the Association to — 
- direct the young men in physical culture. 
The finances of the institution continue in a healthy con- 
‘dition. The Board has received all funds due it, and has dis-
-P-A-G-E-222
    — 221 — 
  bursed them in accordance with the laws of the State and the 
statutes of the United States. The biennial report of the 
Treasurer, which is submitted herewith, will show the details * 
of the receipts and disbursements. 
The attendance upon the Academic Department of the Uni- 
versity has been as follows during the last six years:

  The attendance this year to date upon this department is 
two hundred and thirty-eight. This would indicate a still 
larger attendance for the session of 1892-93, as many students 
enter the second term, especially those taking the teachers’ 
course. 
The original charter of this institution provides that, upon 
the death or removal of a Trustee, the vacancy thereby made — 
shall be supplied by the appointment of some other person by 
the remaining Trustees. This appointment shall have force 
until the expiration of the next session of the General As- 
sembly, within which time the General Assembly shall confirm 
the election. (See Section 4 of “An Act to establish a Col- 
lege in East Tennessee,” passed October 26, 1807.) The mem- 
_ bership in the Board has always been filled after this method: 
The Board of the East Tennessee College was selected from 
“East Tennessee alone. When the institution became the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee, in 1879, the General Assembly directed 
“that no further vacancies shall be filled in the Board of Trus- 
tees of the University of Tennessee until the number thereof 
is reduced by death, resignation, or otherwise, below thirty; 
and that, in filling vacancies thdreniter up to the number of 
thirty, a erercnts shall be given to congressional districts not 
represented in the Board, until each congressional district shall 
have, at least, one representative on the Board of Trustees.” 
Desiring to carry out the resolution in its spirit and in its 
fullness, this Board refrained from electing any new Trustees : ; : 
\
-P-A-G-E-223
    — 222 — 
until their number was sufficiently reduced to enable them to: 
give representation, at one time, according to this plan, to all 
* districts in the State. Had elections been held as soon as a few 
‘vacancies occurred, a question would have arisen as to which 
of the unrepresented districts should be given representation. ae 
At the semi-annual meeting in February, 1892, the board 
found its membership reduced to seventeen, and, therefore, pro- 
ceeded, in accordance with the provisions of its charter, and the 
instructions of the General Assembly, to elect the following 
thirteen additional members, to-wit : 
From the First District, Hugh G. Kyle; from the Second 
_ District, Milton P. Jarnagin; from the Third District, James 
B. Frazier and Xenophon Wheeler; from the Fourth District, 
William C. Dismukes; from the Fifth District; W. B. Lamb; 
from the Sixth District, William H. Jackson; from the Seventh 
District, Campbell Brown and Z. W. Ewing; from the Highth 
District, James D. Porter; from the Ninth District, Frank P. 
Bond; from the Tenth District, Marye B. Trezevant and Jo 
W. Allison. 
  These gentlemen having accepted membership, and having 
qualified and acted as members of the Board, under the provis- 
~ ions of the charter, their names are now respectfully submitted 
to the General Assembly for confirmation. 
In order to give the State fuller supervision over the institu- 
tion during the period that must inevitably elapse before the 
death.or resignation of a sufficient number of members to ad- 
mit of the new organization now accomplished, the General 
Assembly of 1879 authorized and requested the Governor-to 
appoint a Board of Visitors, composed of nine members, three 
from each grand division of the State, who should visit and in- 
spect the institution and report to him. So long as it appeared 
necessary, each Governor appointed a Board of ‘Visitors, who 
examined the institution at stated periods and made reports to 
him. His Excellency, Governor Robert lL. Taylor, established 
the custom, in his first.term, of visiting and inspecting the in- 
stitution in person, as Governor of the State and ex officio 
member of the Board of Trustees. He made his report each : ; ‘ {
-P-A-G-E-224
    i 298 = 
time in his message to the General Assembly. The Board of 
Visitors had, therefore, no occasion to make any report during 
his administration. Our present. Governor has, accordingly, 
not seen fit to appoint a Board of Visitors. . 
Since it appears, therefore, that the necessity for this Board 
of Visitors, representing the different divisions of the State, 
_ has been removed, as is evidenced by the action of our last two 
Governors, through the election of Trustees from all the con- 
gressional districts, and through the presence of the Governor, 
the Superintendent of Public Instruction, andthe Secretary of 
State upon the Board itself, we respectfully request that that 
portion of the resolution approved by the General Assembly 
March 26, 1879, which provides for the appointment of a Board 
of Visitors to the University of Tennessee, be declared void. 
We esteem it our duty to acquaint you with the great need 
in which this. institution stands of new and better buildings. 
All of the prominent buildings upon our grounds are very old. 
They were cheaply constructed in the first instance, and are 
_ rapidly approaching that condition in which repairing becomes 
expensive—indeed, impossible. Two new buildings, recently — 
erected for special departments, render the imperfections of the 
old buildings, occupying the prominent position, all he more 
epeatent. 
: The University has a magnificent site, located conveniently, 
in a healthful section. It is generally conceded that it is a 
most desirable situation for an institution of learning. Through 
the bounty of the United States, the institution has a moderate 
‘income with which to pay its teachers and the necessary cur- 
rent expenses. These essentials—a site and income—we have, 
but chief buildings are wholly unworthy of the State and the 
University. They are doing much, as we feel, to prevent the) 4 
institution from exercising the criti in education, and — 
: doing the work for the youth of the State, that it could other- 
wise accomplish. We, therefore, feel u our duty to call your 
attention to the matter, and to petition you to make an appro- 
priation, at your niet session, for the removal of the old 
buildings and the erection, in lace thereof, of a suitable, main
-P-A-G-E-225
  CaN OO Ar ae,

_ academic building, which shall be an honor to the iy a 
‘ and a pride to the State. 
  No one could question the wisdom of providing for the higher 
education of the sons of the people who must seek their train- 
ing at this place. Every State recognizes the obligation to 
maintain a University as the head of its public school system. 
But the State of Tennessee is under special obligation in this 
matter. In accepting the land-grant made by Congress in 1862, 
for the establishment of agricultural and mechanical colleges 
in the various States, and in accepting the several additions 
thereto made since, the State of Tennessee placed itself under 
__asolemn obligation to provide all the buildings, land, and other 
material equipment necessary for the success of the institution. 
The act of Congress, approved July 2, 1862, says: “That any 
State which may take or claim the benefit of the provisions of . 
this act shall provide, within five years at least, not less than 
one college as described in the fourth section of this act, or the 
grant to such State shall cease; and said State shall be bound 
to pay the United States the amount received of any lands pre- 
‘viously sold, and that the title to purchasers under the State 
shall be valid.” Another section provides that “no portion of 
said fund, nor the interest thereon, shall be applied, directly or 
_ indireetly, under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, eree- 
tion; preservation, or repair of any building or buildings.” 
  In other words, the State was to provide the “college,” with 
all that pertained to it, especially the land and buildings, while 
the United States provided a perpetual fund with which to 
carry it on. When the State of Tennessee, through its General 
Assembly, took supervision of the East Tennessee University, 
re-organized its Board of Trustees, and created out of it the 
University of Tennessee, with the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College as a department, it only began the work. It did not 
discharge its entire obligation by that one act. In accepting 
this grand trust, and founding its State University upon it, the 
State undertook a continuing responsibility; one that must — 
grow with the State and the demands of its people. It must 
expect to provide additional new buildings for the University, 
and to repair its old ones, as no other fund is provided for this 
     
-P-A-G-E-226
  — 225 — 
purpose. The Trustees of the old East Tennessee University 
stripped themselves of all the property they had to provide the 
land and buildings turned over to the State. With the excep- 
tion of five per cent. of the experiment station appropriation, 
equal to $750 per annum, we cannot use any portion of the 
principal or interest of the land-grant fund, or any of the later 
national appropriations, for buildings or repairs to buildings. 
Feeling, thus, that the usefulness of the institution is being 
greatly hampered, we come to you with our earnest petition, 
which is, that you make an appropriation of fifty thousand 
dollars for the removal of one or more of the old buildings on 
the top of the University hill, and the erection of a substantial 
and handsome building in place thereof, suitable for general 
academic purposes. If you see fit to grant our petition, we 
pledge ourselves to execute, with all diligence and faithfulness, 
the new trust committed to us. 
_ The original contract between the State of Tennessee and the 
Trustees of the Hast Tennessee University, under which they 
secured the benefits of the income for the Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, provided that the said Trustees should own 
two hundred acres of land for the purposes of an experimental 
farm. A tract of over two hundred acres was accordingly pur- 
chased by them. A portion of this, being about one hundred 
acres in extent, located near to the University, has been used, 
and will always continue to be used, as an experimental -farm. 
About one hundred acres of land, located at a greater distance 
from the University, and separated from the experimental farm, 
has never been used for this purpose, and has never been of any 
material advantage to the institution, but only a burden to it. 
It is the unanimous opinion of the members of this Board, and 
of the officers of the University, including those in charge of 
the Agricultural Department, that one hundred acres will 
answer the purpose of an experimental farm. Neither the 
Experiment Station nor the college has any use, as such, for 
this extra land. It has never been used for experimental farm- 
ing, and probably never will be. 
We therefore respectfully petition you to permit us to sell 
this surplus land, and, to this end, reduce the above requirment 
15 Supt. Pub. Instrue.
-P-A-G-E-227
996 
to one hundred acres. This Board will bind itself to expend 
the whole of the amount so received in improvements upon the 
University property. 
It is the opinion of the State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, and of this Board, that the law of the State with re- 
gard to appointments to free scholarships in the Agricultural 
and Mechanical College needs modification. This law is con- 
tained in Sections 327 to 329 of the Code. The method of 
examining and making appointments to these scholarships is 
an unnecessarily complicated and expensive one. It has been 
found, after thorough testing, during many years and under 
different State Superintendents, almost wholly inefficient. 
It is only necessary to describe the method as briefly as pos- 
sible in order to show how difficult and ineffectual the plam is. 
The State Superintendent is required by law to issue notices, in 
the month of May of each year, to the County and City Super- 
intendents throughout the State, and send them directions and 
questions for the examinations of candidates for appointments 
to free scholarships in their respective counties and cities. 
These Superintendents must give public notice, and hold such 
examinations as may be necessary to accommodate the candi- 
dates offering during the month of June. They report the 
names and addresses of the candidates found qualified, num- 
bered in the order of merit, to the State Superintendent, who, 
in turn, forwards them to the Senators and Representatives 
from their réspective districts and counties. The Senators and 
Representatives can give their appointments to any persons 
they choose whose names are on this list, and can even appoint 
other persons known to them to be qualified, if they see fit to 
do so. - When they make their appointments they are expected 
to notify the State Superintendent of the fact, and give him the 
names and addresses of the persons so appointed. 
The State Superintendent keeps a record of the appoint- 
ments, and, on or before the tenth day of August, notifies the 
President of the University of the number appointed from 
each county, as, after that date the President can appoint any 
other persons, known to him or the faculty of the University
-P-A-G-E-228
— 227 — 
to be qualified, to any vacancies which may remain to be filled 
in any county or district. 
The object of the law is, of course, to secure the appoint- 
ments for qualified persons from the various counties and dis- 
tricts uniformly. The method has always failed to do this, and 
always will, however faithfully administered. The plan re- 
quires the exact co-operation of too many different persons, 
chiefly the poorly paid County Superintendents and members 
of the General Assembly, all of whom have other business and 
can only give the matter incidental attention. We have kepta 
record of the number of appointments made under this method 
for two years past under the efficient supervision of our-present 
State Superintendent. The results are as follows:

+ = 
25 | 52 | Cho 95 17 | 30 | 45 188 
  
Comparatively few of those examined by County Superin- 
tendents and appointed by legislators ever come to the Uni- 
versity. The greatest number are examined at the University 
and appointed by the President. 
We think it is no fault of the State Superintendent, the 
County Superintendents, or the Senators and Representatives 
that this plan does not bring better results. It is the fault of 
the plan itself. It is too complicated and difficult to under- 
stand. The public know that appointments must be obtained 
in order to get free scholarships in the institution, but, not - 
learning how they are obtained, and then failing to get free 
scholarships, many persons are kept away from the institution 
who would come to it if the doors were thrown wide open, and 
it was understood that everybody could enter who had the 
proper preparation. The impression that appointments must 
be secured before students are admitted acts, thus, as a bar, 
rather than as an encouragement, to possible students. The 
plan, which was designed to induce suitable persons from ,the
-P-A-G-E-229
different counties to attend the institution, has been found, 
thus, in practice, to defeat its own object and the main object 
of the institution, namely, the free instruction of a large num- 
ber of Tennessee youths. 
Every thing possible has been done by the President to remedy 
this defect in the plan by using liberally his appointing power. 
The partial success of his efforts teaches us that all of the ap- 
pointments might be made just as efficiently in the same way, 
that is, by examination at the University, or at different points 
in the State, and appointment by one official, either the Presi- 
dent of the University or the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction. When the responsibility is divided out among two 
hundred and thirty-three men, it is not felt, and the law fails 
almost wholly; when the responsibility is placed upon one offi- 
cial, the law will be executed. 
We petition the General Assembly, therefore, to change the 
present law with regard to examinations and appointments to 
free scholarships in the University, so that fewer persons will 
have to do with it, or so that the plan may be more easily 
understood. We respectfully request that this matter be re- 
ferred to the committees on education, and that these com- 
mittees will permit the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion and the President of the University to lay their opinions 
with regard to a new plan before them. 
This Board of Trustees are required to make an annual re- 
port to the Department of Public Instruction, and a biennial, 
report to the General Assembly. The report to the General 
Assembly is transmitted by the Governor, along with his an- 
nual message. ‘The annual report has been published occasion- 
ally with the report of the Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, but no provision has been made in recent years for the 
publication of the more important biennial reports. 
The act of Congress establishing the Agricultural Experi- 
ment Station in connection with the University, which was as- 
sented to by the State, requires that a separate annual report of 
its operations shall be submitted to the Governor of the State 
on.or before the first of February of each year. These reports
-P-A-G-E-230
contain matter of much interest to the farmers of the State. 
There is at present no provision in the law for making the ad- 
vantages offered by the University known to the teachers in the 
public schools and the young persons for whose benefit they are 
provided. We, therefore, petition your honorable body to make 
provisions at this session for the regular publication of the an- 
nual and biennial reports of the University and of the report 
and bulletins of the Agricultural Experiment Station. 
The laws and resolutions of the General Assembly with re- 
gard to the University are scattered through the acts from 1794 
down to the present time. For the information of members of 
the General Assembly and the officers of the University, we 
ask permission to publish these various acts, together with the 
acts of Congress with regard to the agricultural colleges and 
experiment stations, as an appendix to this biennial report. 
Respectfully submitted, by order of the Board of Trustees,

REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT. 
To the Honorable, the Board of Trustees of the University of Ten- 
nessee : 
GrntLemen—In submitting this, my third biennial report as 
President of the University of Tennessee, I am glad to be able 
to state that the last two years have witnessed continued growth 
and prosperity in nearly all the departments of the institution. 
Great improvements have been made in buildings and equip- 
ment. The striking fact of this period was the erection of the 
Science Hall. Material improvement has, in fact, characterized 
the last five years of the history of the institution. A list of 
the chief additions to the permanent equipment of the Uni- 
versity made during this time will be interesting. 
IncrEASE oF Buriprnes ano Equipment Since 1887. 
The value in many cases is only approximate. Many im- 
provements had to be made and paid for little by little, and I 
have only undertaken to collect the largest items from accounts 
extending over so longa period. Much in the way of apparatus 
and equipment has been added that is not listed here. Fully 
two-thirds of these improvements were made during the last 
two years.

Grand total of permanent improvements in five years—1887-1893. $149,349 00 
When we consider that the University has received no State 
appropriation during this time, we believe this will be taken asa 
very satisfactory exhibition. The buildings were erected and 
repairs made with the funds accruing from the sale of land, 
rents, etc. The large additions to equipment for teaching, ap- 
paratus, etc., were made out of current funds. These totals 
illustrate most forcibly the power of littles when saved and 
invested. 
The attendance upon the Academic Department of the Uni- 
versity during the session of 1891-92 was as follows:

The teachers’ course does not begin until the second term. 
When we consider that this only represents the attendance 
for the first term of the current session, it will be seen that we 
may expect the catalogue for the whole session to show a con- 
siderable increase over last year. Before the first term is ended 
we have more students enrolled than we had the whole of last 
session. The students are distributed through the various 
schools and courses of study in about the usual proportion. 
_ The number registering for the agricultural course has in- 
creased somewhat, and, while the number of those taking civil 
engineering has decreased a little, the numbers in mechanical
-P-A-G-E-239
— 238 — 
and mining engineering have increased proportionately. We 
have about equal numbers of old and new students in attend- 
ance. One hundred and eight new students were admitted in 
September. Of this number, thirty-four were admitted upon 
certificates from accredited schools, and others by examination 
at the University, or recommendation from well-known col- 
leges. 
Appointments to free scholarships are held at the present 
time by students from the following counties:

All that I said on the subject of appointments to free schol- 
arships in my last annual report might be repeated here with 
greater emphasis. The present system is a most unsatisfactory : 
one, and should be abolished. It would be much better for the
-P-A-G-E-240
— 239 — 
- young men of the State if all of the appointments were made 
by the State Superintendent or the president of the Univer- 
sity, upon the recommendation of principals of accredited 
schools, or in accordance with the results of special examina- 
tions held in different sections of the State. It is hoped that 
the General Assembly will make this or some other change in 
the system of making appointments. 
I am glad to be able to report marked improvement in the 
spirit and general conduct of the student-body. The students 
are better prepared when they come, and are doing, as a whole, 
better work than has ever been done before within our expe- 
rience. They exhibit more zeal in improving the opportunities 
offered them, and more loyalty to the institution. A manly 
and self-respecting spirit seems to animate them, and there is 
less idleness and more individual and independent work being 
done than I have ever known in an institution of this size and 
character. 
The interest in athletics has increased very much since the 
opening of the gymnasium and the employment of an instructor 
in physical culture, and so far the results are only good. All 
the relations between the faculty and the students are cordial 
and mutually improving. The students are uniformly respect- 
ful to the officers and teachers of the institution, as they are 
courteous and helpful to each other. Iam glad to say that 
there is not a hint of any thing like hazing or rudeness to new 
students. : 
The organization of the University remains practically the 
same as two years ago, with the addition of five new schools, 
as follows: 
School of Greek and French, with Prof. George Frederick Mel- 
len, Ph.D. (Leipsic),in charge; School of History and Philosophy 
(separated from the School of English, ete.), with Associate 
Professor Thomas OC. Karns, A.M. (University of Tennessee), 
in charge; School of Mathematics (separated from the School 
of Mathematics and Civil Engineering), with Associate Profes- 
sor Cooper D. Schmitt, A.M. (University of Virginia), in charge; 
School of Physics and Electrial Engineering (separated from
-P-A-G-E-241
— 240 — 
that of Mechanical Engineering and Physics), with Associate 
Professor Charles A. Perkins, Ph.D. (Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity), in charge; and the School of Mechanic Arts (separated 
from the same school), with Prof. Forrest R. Jones, M.H. (Cor- 
nell University), in charge (until July, 1892). 
All of these new schools commenced work with the session 
of 1891-92, with the exception of the School of Physics and 
Electrical Engineering, which began in September, 1892. 
Proper notice was taken in the annual report for 1891 of the 
great loss suffered in the death of the distinguished jurist and 
late Dean of the Law Department, Judge Thomas J. Freeman. 
His place was filled by the election of Henry H. Ingersoll, 
LL.D., of Knoxville, to be Dean of the Law Department. 
Prof. Theodore F. Burgdorff, Passed Assistant Engineer of 
the United States Navy, detailed by the President of the United 
States to serve as Professor of Mechanical Engineering and 
Drawing in this University, left us under orders from the Navy 
Department at the close of the last session. The pressure of 
business in the navy yards, and the demand for officers in con- 
nection with the equipment of the new war-ships of the Goy- 
ernment, rendered it necessary for the Department to recall 
him. The Board has already, by resolution, expressed its high 
appreciation of the favor shown this institution by the Navy 
Department, and of the admirable services rendered by Prof. 
Burgdorff during his four years’ residence with us. His con- 
nection with the institution will be pleasantly remembered by 
his colleagues and his students. 
Prof. Forrest R. Jones, M.E., two years in charge of the 
School of Mechanic Arts, resigned at the close of last session 
to take the professorship of machine design in the University 
of Wisconsin. Prof. Jones did much during his connection 
with the institution to advance the interests and improve the 
equipment of its Mechanical Department. 
Prof. George E. Beers, M.l., Associate Professor of Law, 
resigned his position in February, 1892, to take a similar posi- 
tion in the Law School of Yale University. Prof. Chas. W. 
Turner, A.M. (Amherst), first appointed in February to take
-P-A-G-E-242
— 241 — 
his place, was duly elected at the annual meeting of the Board 
in June. 
The other vacant positions were filled as follows: Mr. Jay 
R. McColl, B.S. (Michigan Agricultural College), was appointed 
Acting Superintendent of the shops in charge of the School of 
Mechanic Arts. The theoretical instruction in the School of 
Mechanical Engineering and Drawing was divided between 
Prof. Carson, Professor of Civil Engineering,-and Mr. McColl. 
The instruction in drawing was placed in the hands of Mr. 
' Charles Ferris, B.S.,°90 (Michigan Agricultural College). 
The instructorships for the current year were filled as fol- 
lows: E. McM. Davis, A.M., ’92 (University of Tennessee), 
Instructor in English and Latin; Samuel W. McCallie, Ph.B. 
(Johns Hopkins University), instructor in Zoology and Geol- 
ogy; Ralph L. Watts, B.A. (Pennsylvania State College), In- 
structor in Botany and Horticulture. 
The following gentlemen hold fellowships: James D. Hos- 
kins, B.S., 91 (University of Tennessee), Fellow in Modern 
Languages and Literature; William M. Price, B.S., ’91 (Uni- 
versity of Tennessee), Fellow in Languages and Assistant 
Librarian ; and Henry E. Thompson, A.B. (University of North 
Carolina), Fellow in Mathematics and Physics. 
Mr. Edwin Wiley, B.S., ’°91 (University of Tennessee), was 
appointed Librarian. Mr. Albert B. Wegeney, a graduate of the 
Chicago Training School, is Physical Director in charge of the 
gymnasium of the Young Men’s Christian Association. Mr. 
Charles P. Garratt was appointed Organist and Choir-master. 
Mr. Ernest H. Garratt was appointed Band-master in the 
Military Department. 
Capt. W. H. W. James, of the Twenty-fourth Infantry, 
United States Army, volunteered to serve the University as 
Commandant of Cadets for several weeks during the winter of 
1891. He should receive grateful acknowledgments from the 
Board of Trustees for the kind and efficient assistance rendered 
during the temporary absence, while on sick leave, of Lieuten- 
ant L. D. Tyson, Ninth Infantry, United States Army, Profes- 
sor of Military Science and Tactics in the University.

The Dean of the Academic Department and the several pro- 
_fessors in charge of schools submit encouraging reports with re- 
gard to the work being done by the students in that department. 
The literary professors unite in asking for more books, and the 
scientific and engineering professors for more apparatus, ma- 
chinery, ete. This is always to be expected in an institution 
that is growing as steadily as ours, and of ambitious men who 
are rising steadily in their professions. I most earnestly second 
their requests in every case. 
Our library was moved, during the summer, into the new 
quarters provided for it in the Science Hall, and has been largely 
re-arranged and partly recatalogued. All of its best books are 
now easily accessible to professors and students. The seminary- 
room, with its works of reference, is highly appreciated and 
constantly used by the students. The reading-room is supplied 
with all the current periodicals and the best newspapers of the 
day. The excellent arrangements that have been made only 
enable us to see our needs the more plainly. Foran institution 
of this class, the library is a very small one. It numbers now 
about eleven thousand volumes. We have space for forty or 
fifty thousand volumes, and it is eminently desirable that we 
should, at least, double the number of books in our library 
within the next year. The method of accomplishing this is a 
subject for serious reflection. 
The various scientific departments need additions to their 
equipment. The new School of Physics and Electrical En- 
gineering requires many pieces of apparatus, some of which 
we hope may be secured early in the new year; the School of 
Civil Engineering needs more and better instruments, a new 
and more powerful testing-machine, show-cases for specimens, 
and many laboratory instriments; the School of Zoology and 
Geology needs show-cases to contain valuable specimens now 
packed away, additional microscopes, and other apparatus; the 
School of Agriculture needs most imperatively a new barn and 
other farm buildings, better agricultural implements, and more 
stock; the School of Mechanic Arts should have an addition to 
its building for a foundry, two new lathes, more testing appa- 
ratus, and many new pieces of machinery for its shops; the
-P-A-G-E-244
— 243 — 
School of Chemistry has only partially equipped its large new 
laboratories. 
Considerable additional apparatus will be absolutely neces- 
sary in order to carry out the courses of study already planned. 
It is plain, therefore, that the board must expect to invest a 
large amount of money in scientific apparatus for several years 
to come. We have undertaken to provide facilities for labo- 
ratory work in these different sciences and branches of en- 
gineering, and as the classes advance the apparatus must be 
provided. When all of these new schools have been running 
for three or four years, they will have fixed their courses and 
secured a fairly complete outfit. I advise, therefore, most de- 
cidedly, that we do not undertake the establishment of any 
new scientific schools for at least three years, but devote all the 
means at our command to the perfect equipment of those 
already started. 
The college land presents a problem that demands immediate 
solution. As was explained in my last annual report, we have 
at least one hundred acres more than is required for the pur- 
poses of the experimental farm. This land is now unproductive, 
and likely to remain so. I would earnestly recommend that 
you ask permission from thé General Assembly to sell this land 
as soon as a proper price can be gotten for it, and that the funds 
thus accruing be invested in permanent improvements upon the 
college farm and on the University grounds. Looking to this 
disposition of the land, I would recommend that it be surveyed, 
mapped, cleared up, and laid off. * 
The laws of the State with regard to the University are in a 
very scattered condition. After considerable labor, we have 
collected all the acts and resolutions of the General Assembly 
of Tennessee pertaining to this institution from the foundation 
of Blount College, in 1794, down to the present time. 
I would suggest that the General Assembly be requested to 
publish regularly the reports of this Board and the various de- 
partments of the University, including the Experimental Sta- 
tion reports and bulletins, and that permission be obtained for 
publishing all of the important acts and resolutions with regard
-P-A-G-E-245
— 244 — 
to the University, together with the various acts of the Congress 
of the United States with regard to agricultural and mechanical 
colleges and experiment stations, as a supplement to the biennial 
report which is to be submitted by you to the next General As- 
sembly. The various important acts and resolutions will together 
make about thirty printed pages. 
Since our last biennial report, the Industrial Department of 
the University of Tennessee for the instruction of colored 
students appointed to free scholarships under the agricultural 
and mechanical college act, has been placed upon an excellent 
basis. This department is at Knoxville, Tenn., located about a 
mile from the University, in immediate connection with Knox- 
ville College, an excellent institution for the education of colored 
people. 
The statutes of the State of Tennessee (see the Code, Article 
IV., “The Agricultural College,’ Section 339) direct “that no 
citizen of this State, otherwise qualified, shall be excluded from 
the privileges of the University by reason of his race or color, 
but the accommodation of persons of color shall be separate 
from the white.” The Board of Trustees of the University 
have for many years ‘met the requirements of this clause by 
providing similar instruction, modified to suit the requirements 
of the students of this race, in a separate department. 
In order to make better provision for the instruction of these 
students in the sciences pertaining to agriculture and the 
mechanic arts, a special scientific and shop building was erected 
last year, and it is now fairly well furnished. It contains shops 
for work in wood and iron, drawing-rooms, and laboratories for 
work in chemistry and agriculture. It has a boiler and engine, 
and the necessary machinery and tools. The laboratories have 
a good outfit of apparatus. A tract of land immediately ad- 
jacent to the building is provided for work in agriculture and 
horticulture. Two additional instructors have been employed 
for this department. One instructor teaches the classes in 
physi¢s, drawing, and mechanic arts, and the other has charge 
of the classes in.chemistry, botany, and agriculture. 
A contract has been made with the trustees of Knoxville 
College under which the State students get their general lit-
-P-A-G-E-246
— 245 — 
erary instruction in that institution, but this Industrial Depart- 
ment and its whole course of study are under the supervision 
and direction of the Board of Trustees of the University, who 
elect all of its teachers and pay all of its expenses. 
Twenty-seven State appointees were in attendance upon the 
department last session, but a large proportion of the other 
students of Knoxville College get considerable benefit from it. 
Free scholarships in this department are obtained upon exactly 
the same conditions as in the other department of the Agricult- 
ural and Mechanical College. 
In order to further encourage this class of persons in securing 
an industrial education, our Board has established a number of 
apprenticeships in this department, which enable worthy men 
to earn from thirty to fifty dollars per annum while in attend- 
ance there. They are given work in the shops and on the farm 
of the department, the service rendered being paid for at its 
market value. We believe that the facilities for the education 
of colored men have been, thus, made fully. equal to their pres- 
ent requirements. 
The Teachers’ Department has made substantial progress 
during the year. What has been accomplished shows that the 
department was needed, and is designed to do a great deal of 
good in educating young men who haye to teach school as a 
means of advancing themselves. It has attracted to the Uni- 
versity a number of mature young men, who promise to make 
excellent scholars and teachers. It is gratifying to be able to 
report that the young men who have completed the course in 
this department are entering, with promise of success, upon 
the work for which they were trained. Every one of the nine 
students who completed the course last June is now actively 
engaged in teaching. One is the principal of a county acad- 
emy and a County Superintendenf®, one is president of a local 
college, another is the principal of a city graded school, three 
are principals of village schools, and the others have good po- 
sitions in schools of the best class. Nearly all of the other 
students in the department are teaching in the common schools 
at the present time.
-P-A-G-E-247
SE OAG 
It is the opinion of the board of control of the Experiment 
Station, and of all the friends of the University who have in- 
vestigated it, that we are not likely to get a better or more 
convenient location for an experimental farm than the one we 
now have. I recommend, therefore, that we hold the tract of 
land between the Kingston Pike and the Tennessee River, now. 
used for an experimental farm, or as much thereof as may be 
necessary, permanently, for the use of the Agricultural Exper- 
iment Station, and that we seek permission from the General 
Assembly to sell the remainder of their land as soon as we can 
do so to the best advantage. With a portion of the funds so 
accruing, or with any other funds that may become available, 
we should erect a new and model barn and other buildings upon 
the present farm. I would, in this case, advise especially the 
erection upon the farm of a dormitory building for agricultural 
students. The accommodations now provided for them there 
are very limited, and it interferes very much with their work 
and instruction if they have to room on the college hill and 
walk to the farm. If pleasant dormitories were provided at 
the farm for this class of students, it would do much to en- 
courage young men to take the agricultural course. 
One view with regard to the general policy of the Experi- 
ment Station is, that the work should be limited almost 
entirely to scientific laboratories, such as the chemical, botan- 
ical, micrological, and entomological, and such small plots, 
plant-houses, ete., as may be necessary to supply material for 
such investigations. Another view finds something additional 
necessary. It holds that the scientific research to be carried on 
should be of such a character as to bear directly upon the prac- 
tical work of the farmer, and that, in addition to investigation, 
there should be practical illustration and testing of the results 
or suggestions obtained in the laboratory. Scientific investiga- 
tion, such as is best made in the laboratory, or under enyiron- 
ments allowing absolute control of conditions, should be care- 
fully devised, accurately made, and the results definitely stated 
in such manner as to be of use to farmers of average education 
and intelligence. Such pure investigation, as may be pursued 
indifferently in Maine or in Texas, while very properly a part of 
station work, should not be its only, nor even its principal,
-P-A-G-E-248
Soa 
object. The great value of such work is not questioned; but 
I desire to state, freely and plainly, that, in my opinion, the 
objects of this station aré not alone such as may be sought 
along exact scientific lines, but should embrace the test and the 
application of the knowledge so obtained. The Experiment 
Station must, therefore, have in possession, or under control, a 
completely equipped farm, or so much thereof as may be neces- 
sary. for field and feeding experiments, in order that opportunity 
and facilities may be had for the interpretation of the real 
meaning of laboratory work, as applicable to the practice of 
scientific agriculture, horticulture, and the various animal 
industries. For this reason, as well as for those stated in 
my last report, I cannot approve of the plan of confining the 
work of the station to scientific laboratories, or very limited 
plots and plant-houses. It must have land and equipment 
enough to carry out, on a fairly representative scale, all of the 
processes of the ordinary Tennessee farm. For these reasons, 
I would urge you to hold permanently, and to continue to im- 
prove, the present experimental farm. For convenience of 
location, and for beauty and excellence of soil, it cannot be 
surpassed in this section.

REPORT OF THE DEAN OF THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President Universiey of Tennessee: 
Drax Str—In admitting candidates to the University I have 
been guided as to their fitness by the reports of the professors 
appointed to conduct the extrance examination. A number of 
applicants were, as usual, found totally unprepared, and rejected. 
Others were found to be partially prepared, and admitted with 
conditions. 
Again I beg leave to call the attention of any who may be 
preparing students for the University to the fact that the great 
deficiency is found in a lack of thoroughness in the elements of 
an education—spelling, writing, arithmetic, composition, and 
geography. Nothing is gained, but much lost every way, by 
attempts to put men in the higher classes to the neglect of 
these fundamentals, and we shall be more and more rigid in 
excluding applicants deficient therein. It may be well to state 
again the 
‘REQUIREMENTS FoR ENTRANCE TO THE FRESHMAN CLAss. 
In English: A good working knowledge of grammar and 
composition, geography, spelling, and United States history. 
In Mathematics: Avitemetic, algebra (as far as quadratic equa- 
tions), and three books of geometry. 
In Latin (if that is taken): A knowledge of the forms, in- 
flections, ete., with the elementary principles of syntax, and 
ability to read the simpler prose writers. i 
If an applicant succeeds in entering on two or three subjects, 
he is admitted and allowed to make the other up under an in- 
structor provided without additional expense. In no case, how- 
ever, will a person be received who has not a good knowledge 
of English and the elements as above. :
-P-A-G-E-250

Nothing has contributed so much to the improvement in our 
Freshman material as the schools which have been accredited 
and are now sending us their pupils. 
Students recommended by the head masters of such schools 
are allowed to enter the Freshman class without examination. 
Applicants, however, for high standing are subject, as all others, 
to examination for classification. 
I think this movement should be fostered and extended by 
every legitimate means, and the whole public school system 
' would have greatly enhanced usefulness if it were organized 
into one whole from the primary to the University, the comple- 
tion of each lower school being a passport to the next higher. 
Admitted from accredited schools in 1892 ----__---__-_-_-_--__--_--- 34 
Total number of new students admitted to Academic Department since 
eptember, 1892 jo 3 rc eee ee ae as ee ot 8 
Of the courses arranged in the catalogue a student may take 
his choice, but, having decided upon the course, he must take 
the work assigned'to that course and inorder. This is believed 
to be the largest liberty consistent with the interests of those 
entering. Options are allowed in all the departments in the 
work of the advanced classes. 
A further concession to freedom of choice, where it is not 
likely to be abused, is granted to young men over twenty-one 
years of age who have completed the Freshman work in English 
and Mathematics, in allowing them to choose from different 
schools, subject only to their preparation and the schedule of 
lectures. 
This is now the third year since the military government was 
- abolished and the control of the students assigned to me. The 
controlling purpose is to bring every student to such regard for 
himself, the organization, and the purposes for which he came 
here as that he will not need much governing. The appeal is 
made to his sense of propriety and the necessities of such an 
organization, and if he cannot or will not conform to the re- 
quirements, he excludes himself. A vicious, intemperate, im- 
moral, idle, or ungentlemanly boy will not be allowed to remain

here. As little trouble as could have been expected has been 
met with, and I think a spirit of manliness, self-control, and 
~ loyalty to the institution is growing.

REPORTS OF SCHOOLS. 
I.—SCHOOL OF LATIN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Duar Str—I have the honor to submit herewith the report 
of the Department of Latin: 
Number of students enrolled, and the sections and classes to 
which they have been assigned— 
Conditioned Freshman -- --. 
Freshman (first section) - 
Freshman (second section) 
Sophomore ------ ------ 18 
Janior242225 
Senior   
   
       
The three higher classes meet three, the others five times per 
week. Two sections are taught by my efficient assistant, Mr. 
HE. M. Davis. 
The requirements for entrance to the Freshman Class are that 
the candidate have a working familiarity with the forms, gen- 
ders, etc., the simpler laws of syntax, and ability to read the 
easier prose writers. I lay much more stress on the thorough- 
ness than on the extent of this preliminary work, and my 
greatest trouble continues to be at that point. Iam glad to 
note, however, a marked improvement. 
As the work of this school is now made optional in all the 
courses, it was to be expected that the numbers would be cut 
down somewhat; but the increased attendance at the Univer- 
sity leaves the number in Latin ninety-three, just what it was. 
when this report was made before. Of course, this number 
will be materially increased at the beginning of the spring 
term. ¢
-P-A-G-E-253
— 252 — 
TI have every reason to congratulate myself and the young 
men on the character of the work which is now being done, es- 
pecially in the higher classes. I have been enabled to add ma- 
terially to the quantity and quality of the work without driving 
them to the selection of another option. The upper classes 
will read quite twenty-five per cent. more this year than two 
years ago, and most of them with a livelier interest and better 
appreciation of the literature. They will improve more than ~ 
that over the written work of two years ago, finishing a text 
like Gildersleeve’s entirely in the Junior Class, and devoting 
the Senior weekly exercises to original connected work. I 
trust we in this school are contributing to, as I am sure we are 
deriving a full share of benefit from, the general improved con- 
dition in the literary work of the University. 
We are in condition now to begin some seminary work 
proper, and will need some money for the purchase of refer- 
ence books. The rest of our equipment is ample. 
Respectfully submitted,

Professor of Latin Language and Literature. 
II.—_SCHOOL OF GREEK AND FRENCH. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee:

school for the current year:

In 1891-92, the number of students reported in Greek was 
. twenty, in French thirty-five. Comparing the figures of the
-P-A-G-E-254
— 253 — 
two years, it will be noted that there is an increase of thirty 
per cent. in Greek, and of nearly twenty-three per cent. in 
French. On the whole, the classes in both are doing good 
work, the students displaying a commendable zeal in the prep- 
aration of whatever is assigned. 
In the various institutions of the country, with few excep- 
tions, the men electing Greek are representative of the best 
intellect, and acquire a prominent position in collegiate history. 
The latter fact was significant in the award of honors in this 
institution during the collegiate year 1891-92. While only 
about ten per cent. of the matriculates elected Greek in their 
course, sixty-six per cent. of the honors were carried off by 
them. Both representatives of the Sefior Class on commence- 
ment-day, the valedictorian and the class orator, the successful 
competitors for the scholarship in the Sophomore Class and for 
the mathematical medal, were Greek students. These facts are 
cited, not to institute any comparisons and to arrogate any 
preferences over other studies, nor to indicate any superior ex- 
cellence of work, but, as a matter of encouragement, to show 
the representative character of the men that are found in this 
school recently re-established on a separate basis in the Uni- 
versity. 
The instruction, in both Greek and French, is adapted to the 
needs and acquirements of the several classes. Besides ground- 
ing the students in the forms and syntax of the language and 
insisting upon accurate oral and written translations of the 
author read, the effort is also kept constantly in view to train 
them to depend upon their own resources, to give such aid and 
information as will excite interest and increase the desire for 
additional knowledge, and to encourage inquiry into the cus- 
toms, the history, the religion, and the literature of the age in 
which the author under consideration lived, or about which he 
wrote. 
The school is supplied with valuable works of reference, such 
as wall maps, atlases, histories, encyclopedias, classical diction- 
aries, texts, etc. To these constant additions are being made as 
the urgent demand is felt. An outlay of several hundred dol-
-P-A-G-E-255
— 254 — 
lars for additional equipment would go far towards supplying 
all immediate needs of the department. 
I take this occasion to thank you for the generous recognition 
you have accorded to all the needs of my school and for the 
cordial sympathy you have manifested in the promotion of its 
interests. Respectfully, 
[Signed.] ; Gores F. MELien, 
Professor of Greek and French. 
Ill._SCHOOL OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Str—Since the report made in December, 1890, a di- 
vision of the chair of English and modern languages, which I 
then held, has been made. The wisdom of the change has been 
fully justified by the excellent work done in French by my able 
colleague, Dr. George F. Mellen, while my own time has been 
fully occupied with the work left me in English and German. 
The rapid development of the work in both of these schools 
has rendered two assistants necessary, and, even with this heip, 
my own time is too fully occupied in the class-room to suffer 
me to do much literary work that will reflect permanent credit 
on the institution. The rewards found in the appreciation of 
the members of the class, their evident growth, and their abil- 
ity and willingness to do work of a more advanced nature than 
ever before, are certainly not to be counted as slight. 
ENGLISH. 
In the Freshman Class I have had the assistance of Mr. E. 
MeM. Davis, A.M., and Mr. J. D. Hoskins, B.S., who have in- 
variably shown themselves willing and earnest workers, pleas- 
ant and obliging in manner, and deeply interested in the wel- 
fare of the university. 
The purpose of the work of this class is to teach the Fresh- 
men the forms of the language, the general rules of composi-
-P-A-G-E-256
ne eer ee ee Ee SCO ee NR es NMS Teg gy eh gs te

e265 = 
tion, and to give them such practice in writing as to enable 
them to present their thoughts intelligibly and clearly. With 
these ends in view, the course comprises a rapid review of 
grammar, a brief study of the history of the language, and 
longer and closer study of practical rhetoric. 
g SopHomore CLAss. 
This class is under my personal supervision, and is met reg- 
ularly by me, but I have been aided by Mr. Hoskins in the cor- 
rection of the monthly essays. This class presents to the stu- 
dents the only general literary course, and is intended to contain 
an outline discussion of English literature in England and 
America. It is a large class, and meets only twice a week. It 
is, then, of course, not entirely satisfactory, but it is improving 
steadily. Lectures supplement the text-books, and questions 
test the work of the students. 
Junior Crass. 
cee This has always been one of the most beneficial classes in the 
English course. It contains such students as pursue literary 
courses or elect this work, and is generally made up, as it is 
mainly this session, of young men who are anxious to get the 
greatest good out of it. The first half session is given to ad- 
vanced rhetorie and the critical study of written prose. The 
text-book work is supplemented by informal talks on the sub- 
jects in hand, and constant practice in writing is had. The 
latter half of the session is devoted to the study of versification 
and poetry, accompanied by the same critical study of speci- 
mens of poetry and critical essays on related subjects. 
Senror Crass. 
No class has given the instructor more genuine pleasure than 
this, in which, without the formality of regular lectures or the 
restrictions of a single text-book, the instructor and students 
talk over, first, the representative writers of English poetry, 
and then the representative writers of English prose. In no 
class have the good results of our new library, with its reading- 
room, seminary-room, ete., been felt more clearly, for wide
-P-A-G-E-257
reading is encouraged, and the members are required to read 
something from the author under discussion, and to read crit- 
ically about him. Essays are assigned to this class upon sub- 
jects suggested by the class-work, and each essay is read before 
the class by its author. 
Several méfbers of the Senior Class are influenced in the 
selection of their themes for their graduating theses by the 
nature of the work in this class. 
GRADUATE OLAss. 
In the first pride of my studies in English philology in Ger- 
many, upon my election to the English chair here I introduced 
the study of Old English in the Senior Class. My common 
sense soon corrected my enthusiasm, and I omitted Old English 
from the course entirely until this session, when two young 
men, who have been intelligent and interested members of my 
classes for several years, including one year of graduate work, 
have taken it up, and are making slow but promising progress. 
Two other graduate students are working with the Senior Class. 
GERMAN. 
In the first-year class there is a thorough drill in the forms, 
a careful study of the grammar, with exercises in translating 
English into German, and vice versa. The translation begins 
with a reader, and then several connected stories are read. The 
class this year is not only the largest, but the most uniformly 
satisfactory beginning class I have had. 
The second-year class writes exercises weekly, studies Ger- 
man syntax, but devotes more time to translation. The amount 
accomplished depends upon the time available, but it will prob- 
ably fall a little short this session of the amount read last. I 
reiterate my regret, expressed in my last report, that no time 
can be found for any practice in speaking German. 
Graduate Class. —Three students are pursuing with great 
profit and interest a third-year German course, which consists in 
the interpretation of masterpieces. So far this session the class 
has read copious selections from Goethe’s lyric and epic po-
-P-A-G-E-258
— 257 — 
etry, and his prose and introductions to his dramas. It will 
next take up the first part of Faust. 
The second term will be given to Schiller and Lessing.

IvV.—SCHOOL OF HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
+ Dear Str—I have the honor to report, from the School of 
History and Philosophy, as follows: 
The Freshmen take general history three hours a week dur- 
ing the year. So far, I have enrolled seventy students in this 
class. A like number of Freshmen take biblical geography and 
history, one hour a week, during the year. In history, much 
work involving reading and research in the library, outside of 
the regular text-book, has been given. Biblical study was first 
introduced this year and widens the student’s knowledge in a 
very important field. Good progress is being made in both 
branches. 
17 Supt. Pub. Instruc. é
-P-A-G-E-259
— 258 — 
The Sophomores study the history of England for the first 
half year. In this class I have enrolled thirty-eight students. 
The work is carried on through a text-book, supplemented by 
research in the seminary-room attached to the University 
library. Each student has assigned to him certain subjects, 
upon which he prepares theses or lectures to be delivered before 
the class. The plan works well. Civil government in the 
United States will be studied during the second term. 
‘The Juniors take psychology during the first term. The 
class has numbered eighteen. After completing the text-book, 
it is my purpose to have them make special studies in certain 
lines. They will take up logic in the second term. 
The Senior Class, consisting of fourteen members, is studying 
ethics. An interest, which to me is unprecedented, has been 
manifested. The aim has been to develop the fundamental 
principles of the science. The class will take political economy 
in the second term. 
T have three students doing post-graduate work in economics. 
Two are doing advanced work in historical studies, one in psy- 
chology, and two in political science. One of the last is making 
an original study of the history of municipal government in 
Knoxville. 
My work, especially in advanced classes, is much crippled 
from lack of maps, charts, and books for reference and collat- 
eral reading. ‘To do very successful work in advanced classes, 
books are absolutely necessary. Our library is very deficient 
in standard works, and particularly those of recent years. “A 
practical and well-fitted library, which yields to every demand 
of best and highest thought, is indispensable to the very exist- 
ence of a successful institution of learning. It is to be hoped 
that our worthy Trustees will be better prepared to meet our 
recommendations than before. To put it at the very lowest, 
— our university library should have six thousand dollars’ worth 
of new books within the next two years.

vV.—SCHOOL OF MATHEMATIOS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
My Duar Srr—Since the last report made to you from the 
School of Mathematics, this school has been separated from 
that of Civil Engineering, and is now a distinct school, with 
one professor and one instructor. 
A much better recitation-room has been secured, provided 
with excellent tablet-arm chairs, so that students can work at 
their seats. 
The work accomplished during the session 1891-92’ was un- 
usually good, and marked with fewer failures than for former 
years. During that year there were enrolled, in all the classes, 
144, including 19 in the Teachers’ Department. These were 
distributed as follows:

      I regret to have to state that the preparation of the new 
students is inferior to that of past years, as is evidenced by the 
Jarge number in the Sub-Freshman Class. In the higher 
classes, also, the preparation is not so good, and the work being 
done is not up to the standard of other years. One student 
last year, and four this year, of whom it is not required, have 
elected mathematics in the Junior Class, and are doing excel- 
lently. I take this election of mathematics as a hopeful sign, 
as so many students take this subject merely because they have 
to do so.

An entire floor in the recently erected Science Hall has been 
assignéd to this school. It has, therefore, every thing now 
needed, or likely to be needed for a number of years, in the 
way of quarters, viz.: Laboratories, draughting-hall, lecture- 
room, museum for engineering materials, photograph and blue 
' print room, office, store-room, lockers for engineering instru- 
ments, wash-room, closets, ete. These rooms are heated by 
steam and lighted by electricity. The school has a large and 
very complete equipment of engineering instruments, some of 
which are of unusual excellence. It has a 20,000 pounds test- 
ing-machine, but needs another of ten times that capacity. It 
stands in great need of models, specimens, etc., for its museum ; 
of apparatus for its hydraulic laboratories, and of a steam or 
electric motor. Very respectfully,

VII.—_SCHOOL OF PHYSICS AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Str—I have had charge of this school since the open- 
ing of the present session, and would report the following 
number of students in the classes, viz.: A 
  
    Freshman Class --~--- ---- - 87 
Junior and Senior Classes 29 
Special graduate A 
Ese eae ee ee 117 
Qwing to some changes in the course of study and the meth- 
ods of work, it was thought advisable to combine the Junior 
and Senior Classes, and they are accordingly grouped together. ~ 
The Freshman Class recites three times a week from text- 
books, but, in connection with the recitations, ample experi- 
mental illustrations are given of the subjects under discussion. 
Although some students always tind these subjects difficult to 
comprehend, their great value for educational purposes is not 
to be doubted. Not only do they open up a new field of thought, 
but the sharp, logical methods characteristic of all scientitic 
study is nowhere more prominent than here. The union of 
the results of abstract mathematical analysis and the concrete 
facts of observation are to be found in no other department, 
while the fascination of the subjects themselves are for the bet- 
ter students a continual and powerful incentive. 
In the Junior Class fewer lecture experiments are given, but 
all the men are required to work not less than two hours a 
week in the laboratory. The first work here is to familiarize 
themselves with the fundamental facts upon which the science 
is based, then to make careful measurements, at the same time 
acquiring a certain degree of familiarity with the methods of 
investigation and testing. A more advanced course in the 
theory and practice of electrical measurements will be organ- 
ized when the students are prepared for it. 
The school now occupies its new rooms on the ground floor 
of Science Hall. 
The lecture-room is fitted with rising seats, so that the whole 
of the large class can easily see all of the experiments, and is
-P-A-G-E-263
— 262 — 
provided with arrangements for completely darkening the 
room. A screen, on a spring roller, at one end of the room is - 
always in readiness for pictures or experiments, which are pro- 
jected upon it by the stereopticon. The lecture-table is pro- 
vided with water, gas, and electric wires connecting with both 
dynamos at the machine shop. 
The laboratories are fitted up with tables, cases for apparatus, 
water, and gas. The asphalt floors and solid brick walls are 
found to be so steady and free from vibration that it has not 
been found necessary to construct piers for any of the apparatus. 
The location of the rooms is especially fortunate in this respect, 
both because they are removed from the city streets, where 
heavy teams would be felt, and because the part of the build- 
“ing over the laboratory is used for only a few minutes ‘each day. 
Considerable new apparatus, both American and foreign, has 
already been purchased for use in the lecture-room and labora- 
tory. While the equipment is far from complete, a good be- 
ginning has been made. It is hoped to add general physical 
apparatus and special instruments for electrical testing as they 
may be needed. 
In one of the rooms have been placed a small lathe and gen- 
eral tools for wood and metal working, to be used in repairing 
apparatus or for making such pieces as cannot well be bought. 
Several investigations are under way, or are soon to be un- 
dertaken, with a view to test some new piece of apparatus or 
in hopes of a better understanding of the properties of the 
substances to be studied. It is too early at present to speak in 
any detail of these. Respectfully, 
Cuaries A. PERKINS, 
Associate Professor of Physics and Electrical Engineering. 
IX.—SCHOOL OF MECHANIC ARTS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str—I have the honor to submit the following report 
of the School of Mechanic Arts:
-P-A-G-E-264
TO BOM 
Equipment. 
Since the last report, several valuable additions have been 
made to this department, though the accommodations are still 
insufficient to meet the requirements of-the rapidly increasing 
number of students. This is particularly true of the newest 
branch—the machine-shop—which has been improved rapidly, 
especially in the last year. Every new article added, however, 
has been of the best type in the market, a rule which seems to 
have been the motto of the department since its start, and, as a 
result, the whole equipment is first-class in every respect. 
Wood-shop.—This department is well equipped to give in- 
struction to a moderate number of students. The carpenter’s 
shop is supplied with twenty-six sets of tools, each with a good 
bench, bench-stop, and Massey vise. The benches are so placed 
as to economize space, and, at the same time, give good ar- 
rangement for light and convenience. The tools are in cases so 
constructed that when open each tool is in easy reach of the 
student. The power machines of the wood-working depart- 
ment consist of a planer, combination rip and cross-cut saw, 
jointer, shaper, jig-saw, borer, mortiser, roll-turner, and nine 
wood-lathes. Others are available when needed. 
Blacksmith shop.—This shop is furnished with six Buftalo 
forges, each supplied with a complete set of the ordinary black- 
smithing tools, many of which have been made by the students. 
By means of blast and exhaust fans, each forge is given a blast 
from below and a forced draught above. 
Machine-shop.—This branch has an excellent equipment for 
the instruction of a limited number of students. In it are 
found all the tools and machinery essential for the construction 
of a great variety of other articles, tools, and machinery of 
practical and commercial value. The power machines consist 
of a planer, shaper, two lathes, drill press, milling machine, 
universal tool grinder, sensitive drill press, and emery grinder; 
also good sets of reamers, taps, dies, drills, scrapers, surface 
plates, ete. Heavy benches, supplied with good vises, are 
placed in position for light and convenience.
-P-A-G-E-265
— 264 — 
A large new lathe and some additional apparatus for making 
engine tests have just’ been ordered. 
The engine is a 40 horse power Sweet Straight-Line, and, 
with the boiler, of like size, is used for the shops by day, and 
the electric light plant by night. The heating of the building 
can be accomplished either by live steam, direct from the boiler, 
or by the exhaust steam from the engine. 
Instruction. 
Wood-working.—The student starts with a complete exercise 
with each individual tool, and, having become proficient with 
each, he then takes up a complete set of joints, splices, dove- 
tails, etc., such as are met with in actual construction work, 
bringing into constant use many, if not nearly all, of his tools. 
The hand and eye are now trained to undertake more difficult 
work, and he passes to turning, pattern-making, cabinet-work, 
and the polishing of woods, all of which give him a thorough 
familiarity with the power machinery in cutting, dressing, and 
shaping his material. The aim is to make the course as prac- 
tical as possible, in the construction of useful articles, such as 
models for the drawing department, patterns for castings which 
will be actually used in the machine shop, and cabinet pieces 
for this and other departments of the University. 
Blacksmithing.—Starting with the management of his fire, 
the handling of his tools, and the general manipulation of his 
forge, the student takes up various exercises in forging, so 
graded that the more difficult ones follow the simpler, and will 
involve thorough practice in welding the various grades of iron 
and steel. Special attention is paid to the forging of tools and 
tool-dressing. The larger portion of the lathe, planer, and 
shaper tools for the machine-shop have been made by the stu- 
dents in this department. 
Machine-shop Practice.—The student now reaches the last de- 
partment of his manual training, and he finds in entering upon 
his two years here that all the skill which he has acquired in 
the other departments comes into play, and he enters at once 
upon exercises demanding the greatest of accuracy. Commenc-
-P-A-G-E-266
= 965 
ing with thorough practice in vise work, he progresses, step by 
step, from chipping, filing, and scraping to careful and particu- 
lar exercises on each machine tool; and, when he has proved 
himself competent, he enters upon the construction of some 
~ actual tool or machine. Care is taken to so distribute his work 
that he will have a great variety of exercises, involving every 
machine under the different conditions. A great many tools, 
gears, a small engine, and other articles have been made by the 
students in this department. They are now working on a 
working-model engine, both of which were designed in the 
Mechanical Department. They are also building a Mather 
motor, and will soon start on an iron-bed wood-lathe, a twist- 
drill grinder, and a planer tool-testing apparatus. 
The only branch the student does not get instruction in, is 
foundry work; but it is hoped that this department will soon 
be added, so that the transformation of the rough commercial 
material to the finished machine will be placed entirely in his 
hands. 
The complete course of manual training is taken by the 
mechanical and electrical engineering students; but those of 
several other courses take as much as their time will permit. 
The course is not designed to make a tradesman or artisan out 
of the student, though he will be able to take up any of the 
branches with profit ; and whether he be an agriculturist or a 
lawyer, a mining engineer or a business man, the training thus 
acquired will aid him in either doing his own mechanical work 
or knowing that it is correctly and economically done when 
placed in the hands of others. But the main purpose of the 
course is intended, rather, to fit him for designing and oversee- 
ing, for this practical training, taken along parallel with his 
theoretical, has made him capable of putting his ideas into 
practical form, and, having once been through similar work, he 
is equipped to meet intelligently the problems of construction.

X.—_SCHOOL OF GENERAL AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY 
AND METALLURGY. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str—The Science Hall was completed and formally 
opened on June 6, 1892. In this building are located the new 
and elegant chemical laboratories. These laboratories are already 
supplied with all modern conveniences, but there is an urgent 
demand for much modern and newly improved apparatus, such, 
at least, as will enable students, advanced as well as beginners, 
to prosecute their work successfully. 
The assay laboratory is on the first floor and is equipped with 
a Blake ore-crusher, a heavy pulverizing plate, a new gold and 
silver smelting furnace (as used in the United States Mint), a 
gold and silver cupelling and refining furnace, and many other 
interesting appliances. 
The chemical lecture-room is next to the assay laboratory. It 
has supply and store-rooms connected. The inclined floor, set 
with handsome tablet-arm chairs, is an attractive feature. The 
lecture table is equipped with a pneumatic trough, two lead 
lined sinks, down drafts, for removing noxious gases, electric 
wires and switches controlling the electric lights and lantern, 
and an experimental current which comes direct to the lecture 
table from the dynamo. Slate blackboards and hoods are also 
provided. 
The qualitative and quantitative chemical laboratories are lo- 
cated on the second or main floor. They are supplied with an 
abundance of light from large windows, and are ventilated by 
ten stacks ninety feet in height. The system for distributing 
the water and gas to each student’s work-table is worthy of 
careful examination, while the method used to carry off danger- 
ous fumes is ingenious and peculiar to these laboratories. 
These two laboratories are handsomely finished, and are 
spacious, accommodating thirty-six and sixteen men respect- 
ively at any time. 
‘The professor’s private laboratory, adjacent to these two 
large laboratories, is one of the most beautifully arranged any-
-P-A-G-E-268

where to be found. It is the center of the chemical. apart- 
ments, nearly all of which open into it. 
In addition to the above, there is a large store-room, photo- 
graphic room, balance-room, and private library. 
In chemistry, metallurgy, and assaying much work has been 
planned, and it is hoped that with the increased facilities much 
will be accomplished. 
During the present term the distribution of students in the 
Chemical School is as follows:

XI.—SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURAL AND ORGANIC CHEM- 
ISTRY. 
The instruction in these subjects begins in the Junior year in 
the several courses. Students must have had the course in gen- 
eral chemistry before they can take either of the subjects in 
this school. : 
1. Organic Cuumistry. 
Junior Year.—Lectures, a systematic course; reference to 
Richter’s Organische Chemic; readings and explanations of the 
literature of the subject. There were six students in this class 
in 1889-90, and there are three this session.
-P-A-G-E-269

2. AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY 
Begins in the 
Junior Year.—An advanced course of lectures on agricult- 
ural chemistry ; chemistry of plants and plant productions; re- 
lation of soil and air to plants; nutrition of plants from the 
soil and from the air; inorganic ingredients and ash analysis; 
physics of plants, mechanism of nutrition and movement of 
sap; chemistry of the germination and development of plants, 
etc. Physics and chemistry of soils, their origin and classifica- 
tion; movement of water in the soil, soil temperature, chemi- 
cal composition, relation to plant nutrition; soil analysis, meth- 
ods and significations of results; exhaustion of soils, mainte- 
nance and restoration of fertility ; manures, kind, composition ; 
green manuring, farm-yard manures, saving, composting, use 
_ and value; commercial manures, their manufacture, analysis, 
and use. There were four students in this course during 1891- 
92, and six during 1892. 
Senior Year.—A laboratory course in agricultural chemical 
analysis will be given to those who desire to become agricult- 
ural chemists. The estimation of phosphates, potash, and ni- 
trogen compounds by the different methods; the analysis of 
ashes, of soils, and feeding stuffs, etc.; experiment station chem- 
ical methods and calculations; original research.

XII._SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Srr—During the first term of the session of 1891-92 twenty- 
nine students in the agriculture and science course were in- 
structed in this school. 
During the second term the whole number in this school was 
fifty, of whom nineteen were students in the Teachers’ Depart- 
ment. These nineteen received instruction in the elements of 
scientific agriculture, a course specially designed for teachers 
in the secondary common schools of the State.
-P-A-G-E-270
— 269 — 
No regular class-work has been done in this school during 
the first term of the current session, 189293. This is because 
of the arrangement of the general schedule of studies in the 
several departments of the University. Students in the agri- 
culture and science course will take their work in this school 
during the second term under conditions certainly favoring the 
best results. The natural sciences, mathematics, and general 
literary studies of equal importance, are thoroughly taught in 
the schools to which the several specialties belong. The course 
in this school, as now determined, is intended to furnish an 
education, broad, complete, and accurate, in the science and 
practice of agriculture, to which end it seems best that instruc- 
tion shall be given in such way as to utilize to the fullest extent 
the work of the other schools. Practical agriculture demands 
for its perfection the knowledge of how to apply many sciences. 
So far, therefore, as there can be special endeavor in this school 
this will be the design kept steadily in view. 
On the Ist of October, 1891, that portion of the University 
farm south of the Kingston road was placed under control of 
the Experiment Station, under an agreement which reserved 
to the professor of agriculture certain rights and privileges. 
The work on the station farm, conducted for the purposes of 
investigation and experiment in the interest of the agriculture 
of the State, has been, and will continue to be, an indispensable 
help to this school. Every facility has been given by the sta- 
tion staff, as far as means and opportunity would allow, for 
practical illustration of both scientific and technical instruc- 
tion. Very much more could be done, not only for purposes 
of instruction, but for scientific experiment, if the buildings and 
outfit of the farm were such as are absolutely necessary for 
economical, as well as accurate work. 
Usually four—sometimes five—students have resided on the 
farm since October 1, 1891, and have taken active part in the 
practical work, the hours of labor and character of work being 
as nearly as possible adjusted so as not to interfere with their 
class work in the Academic Department of the University. 
Very respectfully, 
[Signed.] Cuas. F. Vanperrorp, 
Professor of Agriculture.

XII. SCHOOL OF BOTANY AND HORTICULTURE. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Smr—-The following report is respectfully submitted for this 
school : 
Borany. 
The course in botany begins with the second session of the 
Sophomore year with a general study of the morphology and 
classification of plants. The determination of species of phane- 
rogams from the local flora, and the collection and preparation 
of specimens for the herbarium are taken up. Text-books: 
Gray’s Lessons and Manual, and Chapman’s Southern Flora. 
Continuing the course in the Junior year, types are selected 
from the chief groups of the vegetable kingdom, beginning 
with the lowest forms, and their development and minute anat- 
omy, carefully studied. Some time is given to the identification 
of species of thallophytes, especially in the important groups of 
parasitic fungi. This work will necessitate the use of the com- 
pound microscope, and instruction in handling this instrument 
and in the use of microscopical reagents is given. 
Physiological botany is studied during the second half of the 
Junior year, and the laboratory work in the investigation of 
the fungous diseases of plants is carried on as time permits. 
Special students and post-graduates are provided with facili- 
ties for prosecuting advanced work in systematic botany, in the 
study of grasses, vegetable history, or plant pathology. 
Those in the agricultural course will be taught to recognize 
the useful plants, and to distinguish these from plants that are 
injurious, and to intelligently care for, in health and disease, 
the various field and garden crops. They will receive special 
instruction in grasses, and the investigation of field and garden 
seeds. 
The students in mechanical and mining engineering, who so 
desire, will be taught how to examine the minute structure of 
various woods, and investigate the decay of timber arising from ~ 
the attacks of fungi.
-P-A-G-E-272
— 271 — 
During the course special subjects for research will be assigned 
to individual students, to be prosecuted under the direction of 
the professor. This will give the student a feeling of responsi- 
bility, and an independence of thought and action that will in- 
spire interest and lead to practical methods of original work. 
Lecture-rooms are provided, and a well-lighted room, thirty 
by nineteen feet, supplied with gas and water, is now furnished 
for a working laboratory. 
The large and exceedingly valuable collection of native 
plants made during many years by Dr. Gattinger, of Nash- 
ville, was purchased by the Experiment Station, and is avail- 
able to students. This collection numbers over five thousand 
species, represented by more than twelve thousand specimens. 
These are all mounted and arranged in a neatly-constructed 
case, each genus cover being numbered in accordance with 
Durand’s Index, thus enabling one to find in a moment any 
species in the collection. Considerable additions have been 
made to this collection by donations, purchases, exchanges, and 
by plants collected in various parts of the State by the profes- 
sor. The herbarium also contains a named collection of 
plant seeds, embracing nearly one thousand varieties. As this 
collection contains the majority of our grass and weed seed, its 
educational value to the student of agriculture is apparent. 
In order to properly study and identify the numerous species 
of fungi—plants familiarly known as rust, smut, blight, mildew, 
mould, rot, ete.—it is of great importance to have at hand named 
collections for comparison, and several small collections of this 
class of plants purchased by the Experiment Station are avail- 
able for the use of students. ‘ 
The laboratory is equipped with simple dissecting micro- 
scopes and instruments necessary for the beginning classes, and 
compound microscopes and accessories for the more advanced 
students. 
A small but excellent working botanical library, belonging 
to the University Experiment Station, in charge of the profes- 
sor, will be opened to consultation by special and advanced
-P-A-G-E-273
e : / 
students. A number of leading botanical journals are now 
being received or on file. 
Horricutture. 
Horticulture is required in the Agricultural Course in the 
Senior year. It is one of the branches of applied botany, and 
the previous work in the course forms a basis for, and greatly 
facilitates, an intelligent understanding of this subject. Graft- 
ing, budding, layering, and other methods of propagation, and 
studies in pollination and hybridizing, enter into the course. 
Attention is given to out-door culture, culture under glass, the 
management of hot-beds, cold-frames, etc., as well as the man- 
agement of vines and fruit trees. © 
Respectfully, 
[Signed.] F. Lamson-Scrrpyer, 
Professor of Botany and Horticulture. 
XIV._SCHOOL OF ZOOLOGY. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee: 
Dear Sirn—I have the honor to submit the following report 
of the School of Zoology: 
The following courses of study are now offered: (1) Ele- 
mentary Zoology; (2) Physiology and Hygiene; (3) Zoological 
Methods; (4) Systematic Zoology; (5) Histology; (6) Ento- 
mology; (7) Human Physiology. 
The zoological laboratory is supplied with simple and com- 
pound microscopes, with accessories for measuring and drawing 
objects; microtones and other apparatus, and also reagents for 
preserving material for the microscopic work; apparatus for 
collecting and preserving insects, dissecting instruments, ete: 
The school is at present fairly well equipped with alcoholic 
specimens for illustratitig the different classes of the animal 
kingdom, although there are some important gaps that should 
be filled. The following collections are considered worthy of 
note:
-P-A-G-E-274
— 273 — 4 : 
Four hundred specimens of named fishes from the United 
States Fish Commission, collected mostly from the Southern 
States. 
A large collection of named shells from all parts of the world, 
presented by the Smithsonian Institution. 
A collection of insects from East Tennessee, the property of 
the Agricultural Experiment Station, but available for illus- 
tration in a class-room. The collection is estimated to contain 
twenty thousand specimens. 
A collection of anatomical models and charts, including a life- 
sized manilkin with detached parts, ete.

  Both classes are doing satisfactory work—much better a 
was done by the same classes last year. 
GroLoey AND MINERALOGY. 
Since the last biennial report the work done in geology and 
mineralogy has been of the most satisfactory character. The 
instructor, aided by the members of the class, has made a com- 
plete geological map of Knoxville and vicinity, containing 
twenty-four square miles. This map gives much reliable infor- 
mation concerning our marbles and other valuable building — 
stone. It is hoped that the University will see fit to have this 
map published, at an early date, together with other valuable 
information that is now. being collected with reference to the 
durability of our building stone. 
A summer excursion extending through July and August was. 
made into Knox and the adjoining -counties to obtain a more 
accurate knowledge of our natural resources. Much was learned 
concerning our minerals, building stones, clays, etc. A report 
of this was made to the chamber of commerce of this city, and 
published in the daily papers. A number of interesting fossils 
of the mastodon and other animals have been secured; also a

          : ee ak 
collection of rocks, together with a number of microscopic 
sections of the most important rock forming minerals. 
The museum is fairly well supplied with fossils, minerals, 
charts, etc., but all of the material should be worked over as - 
soon as possible, re-arranged, and classified. 
  The greatest need in this department at present is more time 
_ for practical field-work, there being only two hours per week 
throughout the year. Respectfully submitted, 
[Signed.] 8. W. McCatuiz, 
Instructor in Zoology, in charge. 
      XV.—SCHOOL OF MILITARY SCIENCE AND TACTICS. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Duar Sir—I have the honor to submit the following report 
of the condition, ete., of the Military Department of the Uni- 
. versity of Tennessee: 
As at present organized, military instruction is confined to 
the Freshman and Sophomore Classes, and such other students 
as may voluntarily tale it. 
The battalion of cadets consists of one hundred and thirty- 
eight men, and is organized into a band and three companies, 
with a full complement of officers. Of this number six are 
volunteers from the upper classes. 
Practical instruction—drill—is given one hour a day for four 
_ days in the week, and theoretical instruction one hour each week. 
Since the beginning of the term the battalion has been drilled 
in the school of the soldier (squad drill and setting up exercises) 
_ and the school of the company. 
_. The Sophomore Class, and such of the Freshman Class as 
__ have been appointed non-commissioned officers, are required to 
study and recite the Tactics. Fair progress has been made in
-P-A-G-E-276
— 275 — 
this, as well as in the drill, considering the limited time. There 
are fifty in this class. At the end of the term they are required 
to pass an examination in the Tactics (something not done 
before last year, I believe). 
I have mapped out a course of lectures on military subjects 
to be delivered to this class duting the winter months when the 
weather will not permit of drill. These subjects are general, 
and are intended to cover as much ground in military science as 
the limited time will admit. 
During the remainder of the school-year both practical and 
theoretical instruction will be pushed, and will include in the 
new drill regulations for infantry, the bayonet exercise, bat- 
talion drill, extended order for skirmishers, and the various - 
battalion ceremonies, and in May a week’s encampment, if 
possible. 4 ° 
From a military stand-point, the conditions under which the 
Military Department exists are very defective, owing to the 
' youth and inexperience of the cadets whom the Commandant 
is compelled to make cadet officers.. These men have to be 
taken from the two newest classes of the University, unless 
there are volunteers from the upper classes, and this is a very

It thus happens that, at the beginning of each school year, 
privates, who have had no experience whatever in commanding 
even asmall squad, have to be made commissioned officers. On 
taking charge of this department, at the beginning of last year, 
I found it at a low ebb, without enthusiasm or interest. Since — 
that time interest has steadily increased, and now as good work © 
is being done as is possible under existing conditions. : 
       
      
   There is a complete armament for one hundred and fifty men, 
two field-pieces and the necessary accoutrements, all in good

larger drill ground are much needed. ‘

  REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report: 
When it was first proposed thatethe Library be moved from 
its crowded and inconvenient quarters, in Old College, to the 
second floor of Science Hall, plans were obtained from the Li- 
brary Bureau, of Boston, for the atrangement of the Library 
and furniture in the rooms assigned to it. These plans have, in 
the main, been followed in the arrangement of the Library, the 
most important deviation from them being in the method of 
placing the stacks in the delivery-room. 
The plans divided the Library into the following separate 
departments: ‘The stack and delivery-room, the reading-room, 
the seminary-room, and the office of the Librarian. : 
The delivery-room and the room for the storage of books for 
general circulation is, of course, the largest, and contains the 
bulk of the books. In it are fourteen large, double stacks, 
each capable of holding about one thousand volumes. These 
» stacks are so arranged that the books most called for shall come 
nearest the delivery-desk, while those least used are in the more 
remote stacks. A majority of the books here are allowed to be 
taken out by the students, and also may be transferred to the 
reading and seminary-rooms, when needed by classes or several 
persons at a time for reference. ‘The stacks are placed inside of 
_ arailing, which prevents unnecessary handling and misplace-_ 
ment of the volumes. The delivery-desk is situated in the’cen- 
ter of the room, opposite the double doors, and placed with re- 
_ gard to the best light and facility in handling the books. This 
room also contains the card-catalogue, and charging tray. 
       
         
        The (adie. coon contains a well-selected list of standard 
periodicals, and has, in addition to magazines and publications — 
of general interest, a large number of technical periodicals not 
_ to be found in popular libraries. A few of the rarer and hand- 
   
-P-A-G-E-279
  : Ceo 
       
     
    
       
   
   
     mer illustrated books are placed in a wall stack with glass 
oors. Three oak racks of special design provide space for the 
newspapers and magazines. Atlases are placed in a large case 
with roller-shelves, which allow the heavy books to slide in and 
out with ease. A folding case containing seven large display 
maps has been placed upon the wall, and is exceedingly useful. 
hree show-cases have been provided for the exhibition of rare 
 manusctipts, old volumes, autographs, and other things of gen- 
eral interest. Through the*kindness of Dr. J. H. Frazee, of 
Knoxville, President Dabney, and others, some very interesting 
collections have been placed in them. The lot loaned by Dr. 
Frazee consisted of letters written by literary celebrities, while 
those loaned by President Dabney had’ most to do chiefly with 
the civil war and the southern leaders therein. 
The seminary-room, one of the latest products of library evo- 
lution, has done much good in supplying students with material, 
- easily accessible, beyond that found in the text-books. In it are 
placed—on shelves set apart for departments—the books neces- 
sary for outside or parallel reading in the several courses. 
Books of general reference and bound volumes of the maga- 
_ zines and periodicals are also placed in the seminary-room. < 
    , 
- The Librarian’s office is used for storing unclassified books, 
and for the cataloguing of new books. It contains one wall 
‘stack, the lower part having locked doors for the disposal of 
magazines, etc.     
              
         
   
   The furniture has been satisfactory in every respect, and unites 
solidity with excellent taste. The wall stacks, tables, etc., are 
all of antique oak, and are finished in the best he 
The Dewey system, with some modifications, is the method 
of classification used in the library. It is admirable for the 
shelving of books, and, with a subject and author catalogue, 
can hardly be improved upon. The system of charging the 
ooks loaned combines the good qualities of two methods, for 
ch volume is charged first under its class number, and then 
er the name of the borrower; hence, there are two ways for 
iscovering the whereabouts of the book, and the danger of 
losing track of it is largely removed.

The library contains, approximately, the following number 
of books: : 
In delivery-room.----- ---------- -------- ------------ ------ 5,807

In seminary-room- 700 
        
  Pnclassiiied: anes. se ee 700 
Pamphlets and duplicates ---- ---- ------- 
About four hundred new books have been purchased since 
the beginning of the present session; the largest number of 
them being works of general interest. A large number of tech- 
nical works have also been obtained.. These were ordered from 
lists handed in by different professors. Several valuable books 
have been presented to the library, and especial thanks are due 
Prof. Chas. W. Turner, President Dabney, Dr. J. H. Frazee, 
and Major H. H. Nicholson for various contributions. 
It is the desire of the University to build up a special collec- 
tion of books and publications relating to the South and by 
Southern authors, and important advances have been made in 
this direction. Many rare pamphlets and volumes, including 
bound volumes of The Southern Literary Messenger and The 
Southern Monthly have been obtained. We.earnestly solicit the _ 
assistance of our alumni and friends, in collecting such things 
as will make material for the history of our State and section. 
Those having possession of, or knowing of the existence of val- 
uable documents of any kind, are invited to address us. 
It is the desire of those who have it in charge to make the 
_ library a thing of the utmost utility, a complement to all of the 
courses, and aid in their work. The library is kept open from 
8 a.m. until 5 p.m. daily, and the librarian or assistant is always 
present to assist in selecting books and in hunting up references. 
The library is becoming very popular with the students, and — 
they indicate their approval of its plans and privileges by their — 
respect of its rules. 
Respectfully submitted,

Librarian.

AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Str—I have the honor to submit the following report 
for this department: 
This is a department of the Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of the University of Tennessee, and is designed to con- 
duct research in the sciences connected with agriculture, while 
*the college gives the instruction in the same subjects. It is or- 
ganized with a Director and three Chiefs of Divisions. The 
divisions are as follows: 
1. Division of Chemistry, in charge of Dr. Charles W. Dab- 
ney, Jr., with one assistant. 
2. Division of Botany and Horticulture, in charge of the Di- 
rector, with one assistant. 
3. Division of Field and Feeding Experiments, in charge of 
Charles F'. Vanderford, professor of agriculture in the College. 
Under the present arrangement, the Experiment Station has 
entire charge and direction of the College farm, the green-house, _ 
and the horticultural grounds. It has its own laboratories for : 
each of the divisions in a separate building on the University 
grounds. It is believed that the Station is now in better condi- 
tion than ever to advance agricultural science, and to serve the 
farmers of the State. Its report will be submitted to the Gov- 
ernor separately, but some idea of the important’ work done — 
may be gathered from the following publications made dures 
the two years ending July 1, 1893: 
Buuerinys ror 1891—Vot. IV. 
No. 1—January: “Crab-grass Hay, Sorghum as a Forage —

    TEACHERS’. DEPARTMENT. 
Dr. Charles W. Dabney, Jr., President University of Tennessee : 
Dear Srr—I have the honor to submit the following report 
on the arrangement of the instruction and other matters of in- 
terest in connection with the Teachers’ Department of the 
University : - 
This department is intimately connected with the Academic 
_ Department, three-fourths of the work being doue in that de- 
partment. 
The courses of study are arranged to suit the demands of two 
distinct classes of students; first, persons desiring to prepare 
themselves for the profession of teacher in the public schools ; secondly, teachers desiring to prepare themselves to take posi- 
tions in secondary schools, or as principals and superintendents 
_ of schools. 
(1) The regular course for the certificate will cover two aca- 
demic years—the first, or fall term of each year, being devoted 
to general academie work, and the second, or spring term; to 
include work of a professional character. Persons who have 
never taught, or have no certificate, will be required to take this “course. Their work in the fall term will be assigned them in 
accordance with their needs and preparations. They will be 
_ expected to take regular work as other academic students, and to conform to all the rules and requirements of such students. — For courses of study, see general announcement. 
— (2) A special course of study is arranged to meet the demands of actual teachers having some general education. It will be- gin with the spring term, so as to accommodate that large class who find it necessary to-teach during the fall. Those who de- sire may begin their studies immediately after the Christmas 
holidays.

Persons having a good common school education, and of 
proper character, will be admitted, upon examination, as other 
cademic students, to the regular course (1). Tennessee stu- 
dents get free scholarships. 
Actual teachers from all States, holding certificates from 
‘county or city superintendents that they have taught at least 
ne session, will be admitted to either the regular (1) or special 
course (2) and will receive free instruction. 
Men and women are admitted to the teachers’ special course 
on equal terms. 
_ Teachers can enter, thus, either at the opening of the session, 
in September, on the first of January, or at the opening of the 
second term, in January of each year. The teachers’ special 
course (2) begins in 1893, on Thursday, the 19th of January, 
and continues until commencement, the 7th of June. The 
complete special course extends over two such terms, the second 
term beginning in January, 1894. 
Canilidates for teachers’ certificates must complete the courses 
prescribed, or pass satisfactory examinations in the following 
subjects: 
Mathematics: Higher arithmetic, book-keeping, algebra, and 
geometry. 
  English: Composition, rhetoric, general history, Biblical lit- 
erature, and government.      
    
   
      
    
   Latin: Grammar, Crsar, Cicero, and Virgil. 
Pedagogics: The whole course below, which must be taken 
here. 
Science: Botany or zoology, agriculture and geology of Ten- 
nessee. : 
_ Those completing this course will receive certificates which 
ill entitle them to teach in any public school in Tennessee 
vithout examination. Candidates for certificates must, in all ie 
cases, have spent at least two terms at this University.

VI. Pedagogics; elements of psychology; science and art of 
teaching; school law; organization and management of schools; 
courses of study; grading schools; supervision, etc.; Prof. 
_ Smith, three hours a week. All students are required to take 
the full course of two terms in pedagogies. 
Those who can pass examinations on the other studies in the 
“courses Can take, in lieu thereof, any classes in the Academic 
department for which they are prepared. Such students can 
find in the courses there offered ample provision for studying 
Greek, the modern languages, philosophy, history, literature, 
and the natural sciences. In addition to their teachers’ certifi- 
cate, they will receive certificates of proficiency in any of these 
subjects which they may complete and pass examinations upon. 
Post-graduate and special students will have advanced vourses 
of study arranged for them. 
Students in the Teachers’ Department have all the privileges 
of the University, with the use of the reading-room, library, 
literary societies, Young Men’s Christian Association building, 
etc., under the regulations that govern them. For physical 
culture a fine gymnasium and military drill are provided, which 
are, however, optional. 
Tuition is free to actual teachers from all States. 
Small fees are collected in the laboratories to cover cost of 
- material used. 
Students can occupy rooms in the University buildings, or 
board with families in the immediate vicinity. Room rent at 
the University, including electric light, is $7.50 per term of five 
“months, when two or three occupy a room together, payable at 
entrance. Simple room furniture can be purchased or rented 
on the spot. Students should bring their own bed-clothes, 
towels, ete. 
Board may be obtained in the students’ boarding club for $2 
_ per week; at the Steward’s Hall at $2.50 to $3.50, paid in ad- 
_ vance, or in private families at from $3 per week up. 
The necessary expenses of a student in this department, liv-
-P-A-G-E-288

ing at the University on the most economical plan, for one term 
of twenty weeks, amounts to about $75. 
Twenty-nine persons attended this department last session 
(1891-92). Nine persons completed the course and received 
their certificates at last commencement. Iam glad to say that 
every one of them is teaching, with excellent prospects of useful- 
ness and success. Respectfully submitted,
